"The flavor complexity really sets this beer apart, I enjoy New Glarus brews when Im able to enjoy in SF, this exceeded expectations, Cheers!"
"Cherries, red wine, tobacco, vanilla, leather, and vinegar.  Everything I want in the style.  Tannic as all hell.  Maybe slightly under carbonated but a fantastic flanders.  Really everything I want in the style and impossible to beat for the price.  New glarus continues to impress."
"Exactly what I have been looking for! At $10 a 4 pack, this is a steel. New Glarus nails it again...."

"Smells a bit sour and like the filling from a McDonalds apple pie. Tastes a bit tart, maybe some cherry and spices. Interesting to say the least. Not sure I could drink more than 8oz of this."
""

"A nice Flanders.  I enjoy the wood and plum flavors.  Decent amount of tart but not over the top."

"O: I really like this beer, New Glarus continues to impress, but this is so different than the rest of their sours.  INCREDIBLY complex.  All kinds of flavors and smells in every sip keep you coming back for more.  I'll be asking my buddy in WI for a few more 6ers of this."

"A nicely well done and highly enjoyable sour. My first New Glarus beer and it was a treat. Still feeling out sours . . . I've had some good ones and some mediocre ones. I think this is a good one."

"The name 'Enigma' describes this beer nicely. There are things I like about it, and things I don't like. It toes a good balance between sweet and sour and has lots of nice fruity notes, but I'm not crazy about the way the acidity gets all goofy and yogurt-like on the back of the palate. Still, highly enjoyable stuff that is definitely worth a visit."

"best new glarus I've had in a while. really tasty."
""
""
""
"Pretty damn spectacular, I'd be buying cases of this beer to cellar if I had access."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decidedly tasty. Would repeat frequently, if I were nearer the Wisconsin border. Which I may be fairly soon, so I've things to look forward to!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the bottle a dark red with a minimal head that fades fast. It smells of red fruit, tannins and vanilla. The taste is similar: tart cherries, strawberries, vanilla. It's slightly sour, but the caramel malts provide an excellent balance. Medium light mouth with a touch of carbonation. I've never tried any of the earlier editions of Enigma, but this is very tasty."
"This was fantastic. Really drinkable, especially for the style. Very tart and crisp. If available, I would drink this often."
"I liked this a lot better than their Ohd Bruin."

"Sorry, not my kind of beer. I tried it two different times...just not for me."
""

"An excellent brew! The sour leans towards puckering but a sweet malt backing adds sweetness and complexity. Very well-balanced robust and delicious!"
""
"Not that sour, lots of cherries and some vanilla."

"Smells like a musty dusty room. Flavor doesn't follow.  It's tart but not too tart and delish. Drank 16 oz on tap. Some cherry oak and vanilla."
"Great beer Telma taste like a sour Belgian red"
""
""
""
""
"I don't normally like cherry-flavored things, but this has a really nice taste to it. Refreshing and fruity, like their fruit beers tend to be, but with a subtle bit of sour as well. I felt like I got some hop flavor in the beer too, but I wasn't sure. Either way, the beer is certainly an enigma, as the overall profile is interesting and complex. As usual, great job by Dan and co.!"
"Pours a ruby red with lacing head. Smell is red wine vinegar with sharp cherry notes. Taste is lighter than expected when compared to the strong nose. Cherry, vanilla up front, with rhubarb tart finish. Carbonation lasts throughout. Very well balanced, a nice bruin style from New Glarus."
""
"Wow, this is a looot different than the last batch; this one has WAY stronger notes of oak; the complexity is absolutely stunning.  It's like Wisconsin Red at one point, but then it's like I'm chewing on a piece of oak, and the brown ale still peaks through from time to time.  Just an absolute joy and pleasure to experience."
""
""
""
"Oak, Vanilla, Cherry. Red sour"
"Delicious. Yes..I know that's not scientific enough but sometimes you just drink a beer and say that was fucking awesome! This is one of those beers"
""
""
"If you don't at least love this beer, your tongue is missing."
""
"Strong vinegar notes in the taste and aroma.  Cherry cider vinegar to be more specific.  I expect some vinegar characteristics in a sour, but this is beyond that."
""
"Overall: A very good take on a Sour. Good mix of tart fruit and oaky notes with a nice smokey edge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is excellent. Incredibly tasty. I am biased because I enjoy sour things, but it is definitely not too sour to turn off the uninitiated. Incredible balance and flavor"
""
""
""
""
"Another stellar sour from NG. The hype is definitely worth it. Proud to have it only here and happy to send it out elsewhere so you can see what we're taking about."
"O: Very one of a kind flavored beer. The funky character was a hard one to describe because it didn’t fall in the normal flavor spectrum as the brett funk descriptors or the sour bacteria descriptors. Overall Enigma is very enjoyable but between this and NG Oud Bruin i think i prefer Oud Bruin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quick intense flavor followed by tart aftertast"
""
""
""
""
""
"Holy hell is this good. Fell in love with Cran-bic, but I might just like this better. Poured dark brown with a red hue. Bready sour cherry aroma. Has that light ""musty"" lambic note. Taste is huge cherry, with hints of vanilla and caramel. Good sour bite, but balanced well by the sweet bread yeast taste. Amazing!"
""
"This is a good sour.  I like the separation from the Flanders Red, but enjoy that other style a little  more."
""
""
""

"Thumbprint Enigma, which I believe was 2012. Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, slightly hazed, blood amber coloring, with a sparse film of head on the pour that quickly clears up. Aromas of tart cherry and grape, chardonnay notes, rose petals, subtle vanilla cream, berry sweet, woody spice, and some earthy highlights. Very well balanced nose. Flavors are a blast of tart and sour fruit forward, with cherry, grape must, and a berry blend, with white wine dryness and bite, some woody notes, subtle char, and hints of crème. Extremely smooth, dry bodied throughout, with a tart, slightly sour cherry and berry blend aftertaste. The finish is crisp, clean, and dry. This is a tremendous beer!"
""
""
""
"I love this beer!  New Glarus makes wicked good beer in particular sour ales!  When in WI, drink Indigenous, drink New Glarus!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice blend of cherry and oak. Almost more Kriek charachter than Flanders but the beer I tried had about 2+ years of age on it so may be some development at play there. New Glarus rarely disappoints!"
"O-very enjoyable, easy drinking and quite flavorful"

"Overall I found this beer new and exciting and very tasty, making me want to explore more in the Flanders Oud Bruin style as this might be one of the best beers that I’ve had all year. I don’t know much about this style and hope that this is not the apex since this New Glarus brew was so damn enjoyable that I will seek out more like this. An outstanding beer drinking experience, this was a fantastic beer to drink and see and hear (yes hear!)."
"o - another great beer from new glarus."

"A amazing beer, never understood why this was not more sought after with all the craziness with Wild Sour Ale... I have been doing my best to keep my last couple bottles out of the case I had until Dan brewed it again.... God I hope that is soon, I also hope it sticks around longer then WSA.... It is better and I hope I am the only one who knows it!"

"O-Another fruity sour treasure from New Glarus. Flavorful, easy to drink and well crafted."
""
"Bottle from trade. Thanks! My first New Glarus. Pours a deep clear reddish pink with a small head that recedes quickly. Aroma is light cherries, some sour vinegar, and a bit of caramel vanilla. Slick mouthfeel and tastes like cherries, vanilla, wood, and some apple. Maybe a hint of ginger and cinnamon but not ""spice"" by any means. Thr vanilla in the sour makes this one somewhat sweet. High carbonation keeps it very drinkable. Very unique brew, and a winner for sure!"

"The beer is interesting and complex yet not so sour that it is undrinkable. I find it to be a great example of the style. I would definitely drink this again if I found any bottles of it floating around."

"Overall: Sour cherry pie is the best descriptor I can come up with. I love cherry pie and krieks, so you shouldn't be surprised that I always have enjoyed this beer. That being said, I would like this to be more sour, but luckily NG has the Wild Sour Ale to satisfy that particular craving. So Enigma definitely holds up well even a year later. Highly recommend to anyone who likes sours AND fruit beers because this is an awesome combination of both. I wish I had bought even more of this beer when it came out. I will have to await the next release of this beer, if there is indeed one."

"Another great beer from New Glarus, and something that I could probably drink gallons of without getting sick of it (or too inebriated, for that matter). It's not quite as tart and layered as some of my favorite Flanders' sours, like the ones previously mentioned; rather it comes across as a mildly-tart fruit beer. No matter, though, as it's still a well executed and tasty beer nonetheless."
"Overall, super impressed with this beer. Would absolutely seek this out and would love to drink this regularly."
""
""

"Mouthfeel is good, decent carbonation, dry finish."

"an interesting Americanized version of this style. it pours a bright shining orange amber color with a milkshake head in khaki hue. the nose is a lot of fruit for the genre, dried cranberries, cherries, figs, pears, very strange. the sweetness from that runs into a sour wall of yeasty and bacterial fermentation which is almost sharp in the nose. flavor wise, the first thing I detect is the ridiculously high sugar content here. this beer is downright sweet. its a funny trait to have in a sour beer, but its there alright. the sour is a hyper acidic, peroxide feeling, intense front of tongue type that is not entirely compatible with the fruit flavors. everyone in our crowd thought this beer was incredible, I wasn't quite so compelled for that reason. in terms of mouthfeel, the sugar content is cloying, and frustratingly sickening. even half a bottle of this is too much for me. the sour leaves a sour patch kids burn on the tastebuds and roof of my mouth, and its just out of sync somehow. good carbonation though, and a body that would be right on if not for the sugar. overall its a challenging brew for me, a staple characteristic of this whole series from new glarus, and although its well made, its not something I intend to revisit. more of a personal thing though, and I suggest this to any sour fan, or new glarus fan more generally. on a side note, this reminds me of the flanders fred, which was a much anticipated but underwhelming brew. similar flavor profile and storyline here."

"Overall - Absolutely floored by this one. One of the best sours I have ever had. This has to be the best beer I have ever had from New Glarus and that is saying a lot because Dan Carey really brews up some masterpieces. If you are a fan of sours do what you can to get your hands on this one. Amazing stuff"
""
""
"Share out of a 12 oz bottle. Color is amber red, filtered and clear. Smell is of apples, slight oak. I was expecting more cherries. Mouthfeel was good, clean, acidic, almost a sweet apple cider vinegar. Above average overall, I would try it again, but would not seek it out."
""
"O - i like it, its a bit sweet for me, not a light sour summer drink, great autumn beer. Had some mulling spice on hand to compare and its definitely hidden in there between the sweet apple and sour finish. I like it, my GF loves it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"B+"
""
"D - Though I actually prefer a more sour beer, this is still a good offering. Definitely would be a good introduction to sours. It lacks the depth and complexity to make it truly great but it's another high quality beer from New Glarus."
""
""
"O - Overall, a damn tasty beer. Glad I have a few more of these. I would LOVE to try and make a dessert with this; maybe some mochi filling."
""
""
""
"I love these fresh, I love them with some age on them. It is so hard to age these though, you always find an excuse, ""hey we've been replacing a sewer line, this calls for an Enigma."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"it's really a glowing ruby-copper, just a hint of light orange around the edges. smells of mulled cherry cider - cinnamon stick, clove, cherry, baked apple, acetic acid, and cranberry. a hint of brown sugar. the flavor is a bit less complex - cherry pie and a slight malt vinegar bite; it'd be a perfect combination with a rich sausage dish or a cream-based dessert. i wouldn't mind if it was a bit more sour or picked up some funkiness (time will tell), as it feels like it doesn't really get the back of the tongue quite how i'd want it to. the mouthfeel is pretty spot-on for a nice, light fruited sour. overall it's quite nice - not mind-blowing for the style, but just what i would expect from NG: an incredibly approachable beer that hits the style with all the right notes while still keeping it accessible by striving for balance."

"O: Really nice beer that I am enjoying all the way through. Well done New Glarus."
""
"O- This is a dam nice beer treat. I wish I had about another dozen of these."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really surprisingly complex and refreshing sour ale that does an outstanding job of showcasing the cherry notes. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this beer but it does a great job of taking a really nice fruit and using it to enhance an already tasty sour brown. Definitely would love to try this again. Hard to believe they sell this in four packs considering the quality."
""
""
"O - Very solid. The base beer was definitely evident, which I appreciated. Also enjoyed the complexity of the fruit basket that they packed in. Definitely not just boozy fruit juice, but a well-crafted fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very enjoyable and well made. Im not a huge fan of cherry beers, but this very nice."

"This is one of my absolute favorites from New Glarus and probably one of my favorite beers in the big picture. I am often tempted to buy a case of this one when New Glarus releases it. Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the beer was a pinkish red color. It reminded me a little of Cherry 7Up in appearance. The smell was tart cherries and vanilla, almost smelling like desert. While the aroma might make a drinker think of a sour, this is not classified as a sour. Tart cherries dominate the initial taste with vanilla in the background. The cherries dominate the taste in this one, but that is a good thing. This is not an artificial or candy-like cherry, but a pleasant tart cherry. The wood aging lends itself nicely to the vanilla notes in the background. The mouthfeel shows a modest level of carbonation, as one might expect from a fruit beer. The unique characteristics of this beer truly make it an enigma. The cherries coupled with the wood casks make for a unique beer that can be enjoyed by even non-craft beer drinkers."
""
"O: A great fruit beer. Lots of tart and some sour. The fresh oak casks really pull everything together and makes it more complex."
""
""
""
"A good fruit beer, though nothing particularly mind blowing."
"Pours a deep crystal clear reddish brown color with a good sized off white head that quickly dissipates to a ring on the top. Smells of light caramel and brown sugar with a cherry fruity tartness underneath. The flavor is mildly tart with a hint of funk, cherries and bits of lemons. There's a solid base of sweet and brown sugar that provides a great balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet tart lightly tongue piercing mouthfeel. This one leans a bit towards the sweet side of sour ale, but I think its a really well made beer, I enjoyed it."

"O: I'm really enjoying this beer, especially as it warms up. I've had a few beers from New Glarus now and they've all been stellar, but this one just might be the best I've had. So complex,what a beautiful beer. I highly recommend this brew to any fan of sours, superb stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty tasty beer. Probably not something I would buy a lot of if I had access to it but rather good and I'm certainly glad I was able to try it."
""
""
""
"I give this 4 Red Lightsabers and 2 Green Lightsabers."
""
""
"all in all, enjoyable and drinkable. This one crosses some borders, with distinct sour notes, distinct woodsy funk, and some definite fruit. I like it. do I love it? not really. Would I drink another bottle? definitely."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Drink- This was tasty and very flavorful. Again NG does some amazing things with fruit beers and this was no exception. Id love to take down a few of these in a sitting if I could."
"A very mellow, mildly sour fruit beer. I like this - it's more to the wild side than their normal fruit beers, but short of a full-on sour. I'd like it better without that syrupy sweetness, which would let the two main components come through more clearly."
"Overall. Sour brown with a little spice, no complaints here. Nice stuff and quite aproachable. I would love to try more from these guys."
"Poured from a bottle to a glass. It pours a copper color with little to no head. It smells of cherry and sweet fruits with a slight oak scent coming through. It tastes tart yet sweet almost like a dry wine or cider. The beer maintains a nice carbonation all the way through but still leaves a little to be desired in terms of mouthfeel. Overall, another fantastic product from New Glarus! Easily drinkable and a must have."
""
"Serving type: Bottle bought from the New Glarus bottle shop attached to the brewery"

"Overall, outstanding, and very impressive. Another great offering from New Glarus."

"O: Good"

"Riddle me this, Batman: How does a brewery make consistently delicious fruit beers? (Seriously, this isn't even a riddle. I just don't know the answer.)"
""
""
""
"I'd highly recommend searching for this if you are into sours or fruit beers. New Glarus has once again worked magic in this style. Makes me glad I still have 2 more (shared these 2), and a bottle of Serendipity to get into. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After this and every other beer I have sampled so far from New Glarus, it looks like I will be driving back to Wisconsin sooner than later!"
"O: Tastes like a slightly tart version of Belgian Red, which I'm not a huge fan of. Meh."
"Still, delicious competence is both competent and delicious, and I cannot in good conscious give this anything less than a good score."
"O - Very complex and layered. hard to pin down everything that is going on here."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like this more than Belgian Red or Rasp Tart :eek!: Cheers guys!"
""
"o: me likey, wish i had more."
""
""

"Beer is medium-light in body, with low to medium-low levels of carbonation. Could be more carbonated without ill-effect. The result is a beer with fairly placid tendencies that are relieved by the tartness, which moves this along the palate quite nicely in the end. Closes dry, with lingering acidity in the back of the throat."
"This beer poured out as a vibrant red color, beautiful clarity also. The head was white and fizzy. No lacing or retention. The smell reminds me of cola, with hints of cherry on the nose too. The smell is just very impressive to me. The taste is also impressive, it's got a blast of tart cherry and citrus upfront that fades into vanilla and some smokey oak flavors. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, it's thin like wine, but also dry. Overall... I'm really impressed, this is a very nice beer. Lots of great aromas and flavors in this beer and its not insanely sour which I love. This a gem in my opinion, never expected to like this as much as I did."
"O- I had mixed feelings about this beer. It was very interesting and definitely big on aroma and flavor, however I felt like the cherries were a little bit too overpowering and the more I drank it the more I disliked it. I would recommend trying it out, but personally it's not something that I would drink all the time."
"O: this is a very interesting brew and one a highly recommend. Its very complex, easy to drink and very tasty. Despite it being a fruit beer and primarily dominated by cherries, you could have a couple."
""
"Very interesting sour. the slight sweet vanilla notes are nice and interesting. Note expected at all but they compliment the tartness very well. Nice and dry finish."
"O- its a very unique beer and another great fruit beer from New Glarus. Glad I picked up this growler. I love these tart sour beers and the creativity going into them."
"O: Overlal, I really enjoy this beer. I would order it again and will be sad when I finish this Growler."
"Overall a very interesting I am enjoying. Fruit, vanilla and sour all meld together to form something unusual and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one impressed me. Nicely done."
""
""
"O - As someone who is lukewarm on wild ales but loves Wisconsin Belgian Red, this one was a perfect balance of the base beer flavours witih the wild yeast. A truly unique and amazing beer."
"4, 4, 4, 4, 4"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A wonderful sour brown that I'm glad I got the opportunity to try."
""
""
"This one pours a light bodied cherries amber in color with a light lacing that quickly disappeared. The nose is very sweet and lightly tart. It has a lot of fruit character and having had a lot of their other fruit beers, smells like a cuvée. The flavors are of sweet cranberry, sweet apple, slight fruity tartness, light buttered apple, and light acidity. It's a lot sweeter than I thought it would be, going into this one blind. It really does taste like a blend of Cranbic, Apple Ale, and Raspberry Tart. It drinks light and has plenty of flavor. Overall this is a nice fruit beer once again by New Glarus but I think I prefer the aforementioned beers more."
"Picked this up in a four-pack during there annual Oktoberfest celebrations. Reddish-brown ruby hues sink deep in my brandy snifter. Immediately I'm hit with a sour oak flavor leading into a deep, warm burn on the back of my tongue. This beer tastes wonderful, unlike anything I've ever tried before. Enigma is carbonated--almost champagne- in mouthfeel."
"Overall: While the appearance is not overwhelming and the aroma is simple, the flavors and drinkability of Enigma more than make up for these slight shortcomings. This has all the great qualities New Glarus has conditioned us drinkers to expect from their forays into fruit beer brewing. Distilled down to simplest terms, this beer’s finest quality is a very personal one: everything about it evokes memories of autumns past. This was truly the perfect time to release this delicious beer, and it would make an excellent addition to both the New Glarus seasonal release calendar and a refrigerator near you. 17/20"
"O) This beer is likely a lot more complex than I've been able to convey in this review. What I do know, is that it was really friggin good. Glad to recommend this brew."
""
""
"O - For being such a young beer, this beer really had a zip to its sourness. I loved the chocolate malts hiding within its aroma. Good feel to it but flavor wise it was already one-sided. Very red color looks appealing but lacked a substantial head."
""
"O: I love this beer. It's sweet and sour and refreshing. I'd love to have this beer any day of the week, any week of the year."
"Another fruit beer hit from New Glarus. Thank goodness I work for a beer restaurant that has access to multiple cases of this because I will be drinking it many more times. Will also set aside a few bottles to experiment with aging."
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty decent beer, but I could skip it in the future. Still very glad I tried it, and $10 per 4-pack in Madison is not a bad price at all for this. If you like fruit beers, it's great."
""
"Edit: Tried a much fresher bottle and this tasted like a different beer. More like a slightly sour Belgian Red. Enjoyed this much more, and updated score to reflect the newer vintage."
"Thanks for bringing this one back! I might be fighting my wife for the last two bottles."
""

"Yeah, it’s pretty awesome guys! The Sour Ale is not a widely made beer, but when it’s done well it’s delicious. Overall this is good beginner level Sour Ale as there are far stronger sours on the market. Being a 90’s kid, sours always have a place in my heart as they remind me of a Sour Apple Warhead that was so popular when I was a kid. Smooth, refreshing, and delicious makes this beer a must try before it’s gone."
"O: Another great beer in the NG fruit beer lineup. Great nuances of flavor really bring home a full experience of eating a piece of cherry pie."

"#BOTG 155! Many thanks to Tim and David for muling this one back from Wisconsin for me. Poured from bottle into Boulevard Farmhouse/Flute glass. Pours a crystal clear raspberry red color, with absolutely no head. A little odd appearance- I can tell that this is carbonated though, bubbles are coming up from the bottom. Not giving it a great grade for appearance. Smell- leathery and rosy, I also get cinnamon in the nose. A little unexpected. I like the aroma though. Taste- tart cherries, strawberry secondary, cinnamon on the front of the palate, finished by a nice sweet strawberry finish. The play between the fruit and the spice is very subtle, works great together. The carbonation is nice and tight, the finish is dry. This is a very unique and interesting sour ale, I am looking forward to seeing how this one develops over time."
"Overall: New Glarus has mastered the art of brewing world-class fruit ales. From the apple beer to their Raspberry, and finally the top ranked Begian red. These are all treats to seek out and savor."
""
""
"O - Another fantastic brew by New Glarus. This is a great late night fall drink to have around a fire. Just fantastic."
""
"O - Great fruit in this one with tons of apples. The funkiness is quite good and well rounded. I don't think I could drink too much of this, but could see it being a hit with those that 'don't like beer.'"
""
""
""
"An incredible and damn near perfect beer. I'm rarely this excited about a beer. Bravo to New Glarus."
"O: This beer is delicious - tastes just cherry pie. I could drink it all day long."
"Need I say any more? This beer is off the charts."
""
"overall: just flat out fantastic! prolly as good as belgian red, and definitely one of the best thumbprint beers NG has offered yet. IIPA might be my only one i like better, but its because im a hop head who loves ipa's. this is definitely more unique, more robust, and a fantastic late-summer/fall offering. i plan on picking up a 4-pack of this just about every time i make a beer run. great job Dan/Deb!"
"Cost: $9.99 for a four pack."

"Overall: I love the sweet and sour contrast of this beer. Its properly named as an ""Enigma"" because this is a really unique beer that dan has brewed twice now. I have had a bottle of both vintages and I remember this beer to be as good the first go around as it is right now!"
"Overall, I enjoyed it but I think it could use some tweaking. I'm hoping the newest batch that is coming out soon will be a little better. Definately not a bad beer, but could be improved."
"Courtesy of daniloknezic. Pours a cloudy orange with almost zero head. Smells strongly of cherries with some vanilla. Slight sourness and pleasant acidity with a lot of complexity. Great mouthfeel, crisp and easy drinking. Another very solid offering in the unplugged series."
"Overall: very tasty! The only slight knocks I have are because New Glarus terms it a sour brown ale: it's a little light in color and lacks the malty sweetness that is appropriate for the style. That said, Enigma is a great beer!"

"Pours out a brownish-amber with a flash-fizzy head and no real lacing, but the body is slightly more hefty than a typical wild ale, although the carbonation level is fizzy enough to pass for a wild."

"D/O- My idea of a good dessert beer. Every category about this beer is outstanding besides ""appearance", and that's only due to this beer age at review time. Oxidation is minimal but starting to show. One of my favorite beers from my favorite brewery. Brew this one again Dan!"
"O - Excellent smoothness, balance and complexity. Shade sweet for some palates"

"Light to medium body, mild carbonation that barely hits the tongue. Pretty easy to drink beer, though it's not overly complex or flavorful, nor does it have enough acidity. Very similar in flavor the Old English Porter from the Unplugged series."

"Poured a clear maroon color, with a quickly-dissipating foamy cap of pinkish-white head. Aroma of cherries and booze-soaked wood, notes of spice and grassy funk. Nice cherry flavor, tart, wood and wet cardboard, a dash of vanilla and cinnamon, and a chewy earthiness. Medium-bodied, a bit syrupy, moderately carbonated, and nicely drinkable overall."

"Reminds me a bit of the Apple Ale only more muddied flavors. Not bad, but probably not something I'd go back to."
""
"I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer. The bottle provided no information as to what the contents were. All I knew is that the name was Enigma. I poured it out into a snifter and it poured a cloudy brown. The smell really didn't give me much of a clue as to what it was but it smelled good. Up until now, I didn't have high hopes for this beer. The taste was of slightly sour cherries and butter. I know this sounds strange but it really is good. The sourness is not overdone. I can't think of any beer that I've had that is similar. The name is very appropriate for this beer and I would love to try this one again."

"I got this as an extra from Mrkanable I think, thanks man. Hazy amber-orange, almost brown. Smells like cherries, sour, mmm. Taste is good as well, sour, funky, cherries, like a really good oud bruin almost. I'd like to get a couple more bottles, this was surprisingly good."
"Overall, I love this ride from sweet to sour, it's just phenomenal, what a great beer."
"This is great stuff and another example of an American brewery proving it can be as funky as the Belgians."
"D - very easy to drink, very enjoyable, it has a nice bit of tartness but not overwhelming"
"Medium body, high carbonation, a bit prickly and lingering on the palate. This was definitely more sour than I expected, which was a nice surprise. I also liked the oak/vanilla tones that came through, which added a nice complexity to this sour brown."
"Pours a very nice clear medium brown, with a frothy two fingers of head in my sam adams pint glass. The nose brings a sweet sour citrus, red fruits and the slightest touch of sour funk. The taste is strawberry balsamic ice cream, meyer lemon and a touch of sweetness to wipe away the pleasant sourness. A very refreshing intro to sour beer - very approachable, simplistic but well done."
"It's about time. MY FIRST NEW GLARUS. Got this as an extra in a trade with Thickfreakness. Thanks a ton boss man. 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours to a one finger thick fizzy head that hangs around for a bit. Very effervescent and bubbly nose. Smell's a bit like carbonated cherries and grapes. The taste...is sublime. There's a slight sour to this, but it's a wonderful fruit beer. The carbonation and slight sour makes your tongue curl. After swallowing, this beer is all smiles. What a fabulous surprise for a person that isn't huge on sour, or huge on fruit. Can't wait to try other New Glarus offerings."
"O: Another great fruit beer from NG. Too bad this is not distributed to MI."
"O- another great beer from New Glarus. I wish I had drank this sooner instead of waiting this long!"
"o - i rather liked this beer. doubtful that i'd want a 6'er of this beer, but as a one off, fantastic and well worth the taste. it is enjoyable, but it is filling and rich. many new glarus brews are great as dessert options for dinner parties or tastings...and i find that they will almost always leave a positive impression, but if it was regularly available, i don't think i'd drink all that much of this one."
"Poured from bottle into green flash tulip. Small head which disappeared just as quickly as it came. Cloudy dark amber with a tad bit of grapefruit pink hue. Sour apples and peary vinegar allures the nasal. On the tongue I find peach, raspberry, green apples. Mouthfeel is full and reasonably carbonated. This is a great beer, I would like to try out more from the new glarus guys."
"O: Plenty fruity, but pretty much ends up tasting mulled wine. Probably would be good served warm."
"O - Great pull in a great trade! Thanks for sharing, this one will go down in memory as an awesome brew!"
"O: It held up great for it's age and low ABV. Really tasty and hope New Glarus brews this again."
"O- Great beer. Would love to pick up a case of this if I could find it. Would be a great beer over the 4th weekend here. This is what I want sours to taste like. Reminds me a little of Hanssens Oude Kriek."
"Flanders red ale and oud bruin. Two of its three parts are fruit ale and one part is a Flanders style.  Interesting beer, although the copper note is very distracting. "
"Nothing about this beer was memorable, but enjoyable."
"Overall: I was really expecting a little more sour, especially since NG does great things with cherries. It's a very drinkable beer, but I don't think I would seek it out on a regular basis. It's a nice change of pace and perfect for an after dinner quaff."
"O: Pretty tasty and easy drinking. A nice fruit beer, that isn't overly sweet."
"Pours a semi-clear honey orange color with a 1 inch light orange-brown head that fades to an oily cap. Thin and ragged rings of lace form on the drink down. The first smell I am getting from this beer is cranberry along with sour cherries and vanilla. There is also a slight funky vinegar aroma. Taste is slightly sour with cranberry/cherry flavors along with some funk and wood. I see this was fermented with a wild yeast and put in oak casks so that makes sense. A higher level of carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer from New Glarus. Bottle calls this a sour brown ale, but whatever style this may be it is very tasty."
"Overall a really nice sour ale that is pretty unique."
"Overall - the barrel adds a good twist to it like a creme soda. I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"O - A decent sour that was not too hard to drink. It was just pretty average and I rated it that way. I would drink again though."
"Pour yields a brew with a dark bronze color and a really good white head. Moderate lacing as it goes down. The nose is smells of slight oxidation, though it fits with the cherry. There's also some mild oak and some lightly-sweet bready malt. Cherry comes back through, especially as it warms. The flavor hits notes of cherry with a bit of oak and light vanilla. A light touch of acid, though not much. The sourness is mostly confined to the finish. Pretty good, though not as good as their standard fruit offerings."
"Up for review is a bottle of Enigma from New Glarus. Poured into a pint glass at cellar temp. Nice Flanders Red. Sour yet sweet and oaky with fresh cherries. Medium body well carbonated. Nice finish. It has an acidic dryness that really creats a crisp and refreshing drinking experience."
"The CPJ"
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very glad I got to try this one."
"Massive thanks goes out to sproser (Secret Santa '10 BIF) and t0rin0 for giving me the chance to have multiple bottles of this one! Served from bottle into a Warstiner mug. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, strawberry, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, sour, strawberry, and slight funk. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. It was really well balanced and enjoyable. Definitely was really nice in both the flavor and aroma here. Really happy that I have multiple bottles of this one! A definite must try!"
"O - This is not my style of beer at all, yet, I find this sampling to be a great example of the style. I could certainly drink this again, or would surely recommend it to anyone that enjoys fruit beers, or sweet beer."
"Poured a cloudy orangish brown color with quite a bit of light beige head. Smell is a light cherry/fruit smell - fairly pleasant. Taste is fruity but not overpowering. Very smooth drinking beer. Doesn't taste acidic. I could see myself having a few of these. Very good beer overall for the style."
"Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. This is quite an interesting beer - recommended!"
"O: Good, not great... it is kind of like a soda, but more interesting."
"Very drinkable, interesting beer. This is very nice. I would love to pair this with a big piece of grilled salmon. Very complex, mixes well."
"D: Very flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, because of its complexity this is a good beer to drink for a while if you're looking for something different."
"Drink is off the charts. I could drink this all the time. Great job on this one guys!"
"Pours dark and cloudy with a fluffy head that slowly dissipates. Smells juicy, fruity and sweet - like fresh, ripe apples. Enigma is a deep and complex cider, tart and sweet with a hint of cinnamon and spices. The use of cherries becomes apparent as Enigma makes its way around one's mouth; their tartness is surprisingly refreshing. Dan Carey has somehow captured autumn and bottled it."
"Pours to an enormous head over a rich amber hue; taste is dominated by sour and tart, with hints of apple, giving it a sweetness that's both enjoyable and refreshing; heavy carbonation gives this beer a satisfying palete with its above-average fizziness. This would be a great summertime brew to enjoy after mowing the lawn - I'll definitely be revisiting this as the weather warms."
"The reveal: New Glarus Unplugged Enigma. Nice, this was a want but its not what I thought it would be like. For some reason I expected Enigma to be a darker, richer beer."
"D: Interesting flavor profile and low ABV. I know I called this a liquid desert, but it doesn't come off cloyingly sweet as some beers may. Drinkability is great."
"Drinkability: Ridiculously drinkable. This would work in the middle of summer or the rare warm winter day. The low ABV and amazing amount of character in both the nose and mouth bring this beer to new levels. For my first NG beer, I can't say I'm disappointed."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Although the sweet fruitiness doesn't lend well to drinking many per night, I'd say it's very drinkable. The mild ABV is nice, and I am very impressed with this Unplugged Enigma. New Glarus did a great job here."
"D: I enjoyed this one a lot, but I'm not sure I could drink more than a bottle in a sitting. Its certainly interesting, a standout amongst most fruit beers. I definitely preferred this to the Raspberry Tart. There's just a little more going on to keep you coming back for more."
"D: Excellent drinkability. ABV lends well to session, but the sweetness could limit going too far with this. Still, excellent beer!"
"Drinkability: Another good Unplugged, the drinkability is excellent all of the flavors don't cause any problems and its an easy drink."
"Poured chilled into a shaped pint glass with a hazy brown body that has red tints. Peanut colored head, not very dense or tall and disappears quickly. Smells like cherries and vanilla with an oak background. Also smells funky/musty and a little like vinegar. Taste isn't as tart as I expected based on the nose, but everything else from the nose pulls through alright. Sweet and slightly syrupy, but not cloying. Very highly carbonated and thin in body. Tasty beer that smells great and looks nice, too. Enjoyable and complex, but not exactly what I had expected."
"Pours a pretty clear ruby/garnet red color with a thin tan head and a little lacing. Smells of tart cherries, hay, and funk. Tastes of tart cherries, biscuit, and some of that crazy funk flavor. Mouthfeel is medium and there is a little carbonation. Drinkability is fair."
"drinkability - if the flavor is not there then how can the drinkability be - poured out more then half"
"D: As most fruit beers go, it's pretty good at first and gets a little taxing as you go. Nice beer overall."
"D: very different take on the fruit beer style that is borderline wild ale due to the brettty funky character. ovreall it was tasty and was drinkin great."
"Medium bodied and sweet with lots of dark fruit complimeted by slightly toasted caramel malt and sweet rye. Hints of caramel, toffee, biscuit and rye provide complexity and balance to the sweet vinous dark fruit notes. The most prominent fruit flavor is tart dark cherry but there is also subtle grape and plum but this beer is not cloying or too sweet. The malt backbone is stronger than expected and really helps this beer from becoming a cloying mess. Well balanced and easy to drink with a lingering dry, tart finish."
"D: Drinkable wild ale/sour. If you are in the mood for a sour this one is a good choice."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, cherries are one of my favorite additions in anything. This one did the cherry thing very nicely and balanced the sweetness with some nice tart and sour flavors. Very flavorful and delicious beer overall."
"d- This is an overall good beer. The guys at New Glarus impress me everytime I have one of their beers. There is no brewery on the planet that does better fruit beer than these guys."
"D: excellent, sessionable, I wish I had a six pack or easy access to this delicious brew. The bottle says it was a one time release, but maybe if we beg..."
"Drinkability - If I've said it once I've said it a million times, New Glarus knows how to do fruit style beers. This was yet another treat and the combination of spices (nutmeg/cinnamon?) and the tart/sweet cherries is a treat. Damn good."
"D: There are only a few fruit beers that I thought were amazing. This one hits it dead on with a straight forward & balanced flavor. I could probably drink 2-3 of these in one sitting, but that's it because it is so sweet."
"D: Very high. The alcohol is unnoticeable and the beer is complex and tastes quite good. I wish I had more of this."
"4.0/4.5/4.0/4.5/4.0"
"D- Its... okay. Not the best beer I've had. Oddly similar to other offerings by New Glarus. I find the flavors distracting. It presents a challenge to finish twelve ounces. Six is probably my limit on enjoyability."
"For the record, I opened a bottle of this about two months back, and didn't like it much. I thought I would give it another try, and tonight I have been enjoying it much more. I don't think the beer has changed at all, but either my taste has, or this beer just takes a while to get used to."
"D - Because of the strange flavors in this beer, and because of the tartness of it, its not terribly drinkable, but its still pretty good."
"I finally get to try something from the heralded Unplugged series. This appearance is as you would expect with any fruit beer there is a slight haze to the pinkish body. The smell is mainly of raspberries with a hint of sour in the background. The taste has the fruit characteristics that were seen in the nose but there is a heaving spicing of what appears to be ginger with the strong tart flavor of the fruit. I'm really not a fan of how this beer tastes. The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth, but in all honesty I really can't get past how this beer tastes as far as the drinkability goes."
"D: This was a very well balanced sweet and sour beer, with nice body and no noticeable alcohol. So it was easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"D: Reasonably drinkable. Very good overall balance, but lack of depth. Moderate ABV helps put it over the top."
"D. Drinkable for sure. This is a very interesting beer. How many of these I would have in a row might be in question, however there is no doubt that this is one that I would come back to. Nice work of blending the already sour/tart flavors of cherries with a sour style beer."
"D- Quite tasty, and easy to drink. It's a nice light sour, and an all around interesting beer."
"Enigma is an apt name for this delightful beer from New Glarus Brewing Co. So many interesting flavors and aromas dance throughout this beer that it's difficult to to shy away from."
"D - Drinkability is great. Kind of like a sour cherry coke. Tarty, funky and refreshing. Its not boozy or hot and im not feeling the alcohol."
"d-One of these goes a long way but it went down fairly easy."
"This one gives Cran-bic a run for it's money as my favorite Unplugged. This beer alone made the trip to Wisconsin worth it."
"One of my favorites from the unplugged line following only the Eisbock and Cranbic. I've been sending this out as extras for the last few months and I hope others shared my thoughts."
"Mouth feel is great, lots of bite and decent amount of alcohol makes this a very refreshing drink."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 12oz. bottle served in a Portsmouth tulip. Pours a semi-hazy claret with a frothy band around the edges. Nose is incredible - malty sweet, oaky, buttery, tart citrus. Taste reveals sour butterscotch, toffee and coconut reminiscent of tropical fruit lifesavers. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and some astringency. Wow - this was an exceptional beer I have to say. Great flavor and complexity. Wish it wasn't a one off."
"Overall- I am almost suprised at how much I like this! Very good."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation, good mouthfeel and is quite drinkable. Again, a very unusual beer but I'm digging it."
"D: Complex, complex, complex! This is the most unusual brew I've tasted from New Glarus. Wow, what an amazing brewery!"
"D: This was a lot easier to drink than the Belgian Red. Not so overwhelmingly sweet and much more complex."
"Beer is light in body and sweet with a woodsy funk that goes along with it. The carbonation pops on the palate and finishes a little dry. Its an odd beer but I'm glad I got to try it for sure. I would cautiously recommend it. Its one of the sillier beers from the NG unplugged series."
"This is polished, velvety, and not too sticky, tingly, or sour. A good offering."
"Review #900! Honestly, during the pre-interview extravaganza, I did not expect to see this gem come through on-tap. I'm glad it did. It pours a mostly clear russet-copper topped by nearly a finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose comprises black cherries, cinnamon, nutmeg, dank raspberries, and a kick of oak. The taste is definitely something: raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, red apples, cherries, black grapes, sourdough, rye bread, oak, tobacco, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Whew. It all melds together so nicely that it takes a while to really deconstruct it (and I'm pretty sure I missed something). The body is a hefty medium, with a very-light moderate carbonation and a slightly thick feel. Damn, was this an interesting brew! So many fruits and berries, with some nice spicing as well...it's all quite the adventure. Get some!"
"While I certainly like this beer, I wish it were a bit more complex. The balance of cherries and oak is exquisite, but it lacks the interplay of sourness and the other fruit flavors (citrus, passionfruit, apricot) that can appear in this type of beer. A novel beer, and a good one, but not the best."
"Fun beer, loved it. Would happily drink 4 or 5 at a time."
"D - A very nice Unplugged. Though it is (currently) classified as a fruit beer on this site, it is so similar in flavor to the paradigm examples of the Flanders Red style that I cannot resist comparison."
"D - pretty drinkable enjoyable beer. I can't think of anything I could pick up at the store near me that would compare to this. Nice sweet notes blend with a pleasant tartness. Like every other New Glarus beer I've had before I wish I could get this near me."
"D: Not bad but a little too sweet for my tastes. Apparently I should have cellared this beer, but I guess I found out too late. Still, fairly tasty and complex, just a little sweet."
"The taste is subtly acidic, really great mouthfeel. Surprising balance between the acidity and fruity, brown sugar sweetness. It's got a great full, creaminess to the mouthfeel. Medium bodied, without being too syrupy like the belgian red or raspberry tart tend to waver toward. For a beer with considerable sweetness and fruitiness initially, it manages to finish a good bit drier. Really surprised by this one, good brew!"
"D - All I can say this was a great beer. It could be a little on the too fruity side for some, but I know I could definitely go through a few of this in one night."
"D - I wish I had a case of this stuff, goes down so damn smooth I could drink a boatload of this"
"Very nice example of an American made sour brown, would be a decent introduction to the style for an unitiated."
"Unplugged Enigma is a bit of a mystery wrapped in an enigma wrapped in bacon... or something like that. I have no idea the proper category to judge this other than good. This is a good beer. Bright and flavorful and a bit too easy to enjoy. Try it if you can, a work of art indeed."
"Very easy drinking, the 12oz bottle went surprisingly quickly considering what this it is. Not exactly what I was expecting and not terribly complex but altogether a pleasant beer and a very nice entry in the style."
"D: Even one small bottle was plenty for me. Thanks, but no thanks."
"Reddish brown color with one finger of head that slowly settled to a thick cap. A little lacing is left on the glass. Interesting aroma of tart cherries, vanilla, and some sour, funkiness. Already I can tell this is not going to be just another fruity beer. The flavor is complex. Starts off with some sourness but it is not lip puckering tartness. Hints of cherries and vanilla. Acidity is moderately low. This is how I think Wisconsin Belgian Red should taste. Light body and slightly effervescent. Almost has a ginger ale finish. Seems quite suitable for a beer like this. New Glarus unleashed a very interesting, well made beer with Enigma. Glad I had a chance to drink a few bottles."
"Drinkability - New Glarus sure does make a lot of cherry beers. It might get old if they weren't all so good. I was a little skeptical that this beer would have much new to offer, but it certainly does."
"D: not one to slam."
"This is a sweet, after dinner beer. Almost dessert-esque. This is a good fall beer in my opinion. Something you can sip around an early evening campfire."
"Drinks: like a thinking-man's beer. Rarely do I enjoy contemplating a beer so much. Enigma pushes boundaries while at the same time offering balance, complexity, and a nice bit of booze. Bravo, New Glarus."
"D - Kinda sweet, more like a Lindeman's version of a fruit flavored lambic. A little too sweet to put more than a glass of this down."
"D- easy to finish. almost sessionable in strength. i could polish off a four pack in a single night with ease."
"D - At first I thought this beer was not for me. However, the more I drank this, the more and more I liked it. I am glad I have a couple more bottles of this laying around. Another success with New Glarus Unplugged."
"quite different and well worth trying, thanks MasterSki for the chance to try this one"
"The mouth is firm, slightly wet, but filling enough. Carbonation level is spot on for a fruit beer. Lightly spritzy, but not overly so. Smooth flavors of cherry, cranberry, wood notes, and faint funk on the back end. The finish is a little tamer than some of his other fruit beers, but it's got a pleasantly tart aftetaste. Wow. This was everything I was hoping it was going to be. Again, I am amazed at Dan's work. The man knows his way around fruit beers for sure. Thanks again, Scott, for the opportunity."
"Taste has alot of granny smith apples, cherries, with a complementary woodsy note of bitter greens, and some damp oak. The finish is mostly dry and makes this one as easy to drink as they come."
"Another winner from New Glarus !!!"
"Mind-blowing? Not quite. Very interesting, though, and really drinkable. A solid beer that will appeal to many. A lot going on, for a low-ABV fruity sour beer, which is unusual. Hard to review this beer ""to style," of course, but it's definitely good."
"Thanks to two of the finest gents on BA for the continuing supply of classic NG beers."
"D- YES. Almost like tart fruit juice, which is my absolute favorite non-alcoholic beverage. Drank Enigma after eating Sausalito cookies (macadamia nuts, milk chocolate). I definitely recommend this pairing!"
"M/D: It has a slight syrupy quality, it isn't detracting at all, but adds for an interesting texture. It does have a rich mouthfeel and carbonation balances the flavors really well. I am enjoying their beers a lot, it is a nice change of pace with lower ABV beers. It is just as complex and drinkable without being 8-12%."
"D: Goes down easily, not filling, not very tasty - far too artificial flavoring in this beer. This is a one and done for me."
"Overall, another beer from ng that I enjoy a lot. The cherries are spot on and provide a bit of tartness to this refreshing beer. I am really glad NG brought this one back. Very drinkable."
"New Glarus makes great fruit beers (surprise, surprise), and this is no exception. I'm not sure if I like the taste of this better than the WI Belgian Red, but if not, it's not far behind. And for a cheapskate like me, buying this (when available) is a no-brainer - it's 40% cheaper on a $/oz. basis."
"Poured with a medium sized, light tan head that settled out and a little lace. Color is a clear copper amber. Aroma is tart, malt, yeast, and a bit of fruit. Flavor's the same plus a bit of cookie dough. Body is excellent and ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, has long length. Session beer in the summer and right mood."
"D: I would seek out more to see how it ages, but not a sour that I would frequent."
"D-I actually really enjoy this beer, quite a sessionable brew! plenty of sweet cherries with a very light addition of barrel aging. the sourness is quite low, which allows this to be extremely drinkable. not the most interesting of beers, but so tasty."
"D: Good drinkability. Went down easily. A little less cherry and a little more acidity would make this fantastic."
"Light-bodied with less carbonation than I'd like. Finishes semi-dry with an acidic blast of vinegar. Surprisingly refreshing and highly drinkable, Enigma lives up to its name in terms of intriguing complexity. Quite an original."
"Drinkability -- There's a lot of commonality between this and Wisconsin Belgian Red, but there's an extra layer of depth to it from the oak barrel and the spontaneous fermentation. Personally, I would've preferred more tart/sour/wild elements, but for what it is, it's quite good."
"Pours a dark, clear mahogany/ruby red color with a thin light tan head that leaves minimal lacing and is unretentive. Aroma is dominated by sweet oak and cherries, but overall fairly light. Flavor and body reminds me of Cranbic, but with sour cherries and is the exceptional high point of the beer (as hoped for). Body has a pleasant vanilla, pumpkin, sugary spice, tart fruit blend of flavors and a rather thick, full body with sharp carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer despite some of my friends not being a big fan of it; however this isn't anywhere near the level of awesome as Rasp Tart or Belgian Red."
"D: A interesting beer with a good balance of sweet, sour, and bitter. However, I just can't get into these damn fruited beers. Glad to have tried it, but I'll stick with the malts and hops."
"Flavor is nice. It's definitely tasty, just a little light. Therefore, drinkability is excelent. Mouthfeel is a light body and high carbonation. Fruit flavors are pleasant. A mild salad dressing like flavor resides...but ironically, it's not a bad thing. Overall, a tasty beer."
"I'll definitely revisit this one if I can. It's extremely interesting and unique, yet maintains a ""user-friendly"" aspect about it. Great beer."
"This review was quick and brief.... but I have another bottle of Enigma that I will use to expand this review."
"Drinkability is phenomenal. I had maybe 7 ounces of this beer, and I could have downed an entire growler effortlessly, savoring every beautiful sip. Fantastic beer, and another huge thank you, Jeff. You outdid yourself with this one. This one only reinforces what I already believed: Dan Carey is the best brewer in the country. There are some very close competitors (Vinnie @ RR, Patrick @ the Bruery comes very close, a few others) but no one I know can produce the variety of styles Dan has in such a masterful fashion, from German wheats to unbelievable lagers to fruit beers and sours. A tip of the hat, from me to Dan."
"Clear, dark honeyed amber with a creamy sand colored head that leaves sheets of fine lace on the glass. Tart cherry and oak with a little bit of wild funk in the aroma. Tart, lactic cherry flavors up front are balanced nicely with sweet malt and toasted oak. Vanilla bean, charred, caramelized sugar and ripe apple flavors come to life as the beer warms up a bit. The complex flavors of this beer are certainly Oud Bruin and a damn fine one at that. Full bodied and lightly syrupy with perfect mild carbonation. A really nicely made beer."
"D: A refreshing but not over the top sour beer. Enjoyable, but towards the end the sweetness got a little too much for me so I'd stop after one in a sitting. Would buy and recommend this"
"The taste lingers after drinking, but it's just not like a beer that I would drink all the time to me. Very smooth drink, but not my classic beer."
"This brew makes me salivate and go back time and time again for more sips which makes it fairly drinkable despite a sharpness about it in the back of the throat. For less than 6% the alcohol is more evident than I was expecting. Overall not bad, glad I had a chance to try it and big thanks to younger35 for making that happen."
"Drinkability: I would definitely drink this again, if I can trade for it. A very nice, complex drinkable tart beer. Kudos to New Glarus!"
"*2nd half of the bottle update* the acetic character seems to have increased when the beer warmed toward room temperature, and the burn is somewhat oppressive."
"Drinkability: A bit too sweet for me to want several of these in a row... While I'm drinking it, my mouth feels as if it's been broken and I've been tasting this for a while now and just want it to go away. But then it does, after a couple of seconds, and I want some more."
"New Glarus is now in my top three American breweries. Not a bad beer to be seen anywhere. Enigma is another great example of how masterful they are at barrel aging."
"Drinkability: I was lucky enough to try a 4 year old bottle of Enigma at a beer tasting last week. There is quite a difference between that version of Enigma and the current one. The new version is much more tart, more emphasis on the sour characteristics and the cherry flavor. I think the older version was more balanced. Not balanced in the sense that the new version doesn't have a nice blend of flavors, but it lends itself more towards the sour side. I liked both versions to be honest, though I do like the sourness that shines through on the new one a bit more."
"d - Another solid fruity beer from New Glarus. Glad I got to try it and would like to have again"
"D - Highly drinkable, good balance of sour and sweetness, big flavor too. Just another great one from New Glarus."
"Drinkability is good, this is a really nice sour."
"D: another winner from New Glarus. Somehow they manage to highlight the best fruit flavors in a beer and bring them all center stage. I am consistently impressed with the fruit beers that NG puts out (excluding the cherry stout). And not to mention, this beer is a great value. Probably the cheapest Flanders style ale that is out there."
"Enigma drinks like a cider; prickly with some carbonation, but not thick in body. Definitely an interesting beer, and very easy to drink."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Thin head, low retention, oily clear lacing on the glass. Aroma is of sour cherries, peppermint, with cinnamon standing out. Interesting. Taste is mouthpuckeringly sour with a pleasant sour cherry taste, slightly peppery burn, and warming on the throat. Tart. Interesting. Unique. Style points. Not picking up too much oak or vanilla, but what an interesting beer none the less."
"D- A little less cherry would give this very high drinkability, but might disturb that nice balance of styles that this beer has going for it. Multiple servings would be welcomed; neither the acidity nor the fruit are overwhelming. Not exactly an enigma, but definitely thought provoking."
"D- This is a very good, rich fruit beer. The balance between the cherry and barrel chracteristics is wonderful. Much better than wisconsin belgian red and more tame as well. I would like this to be a bit wilder but its very good as is! Another great job by NG!"
"M/D - Mouthfeel is light and enjoyable with a pleasant tick on the tongue at the end. Very drinkable but certainly a siper that should be concentrated on when drinking."
"D - a bit unique, yummy, and refreshing. leave it to New Glarus for another wonderfully executed yet no-thrills beer."
"D: Subtlety is the trend in this meticulously-crafted beer. Highly-nuanced, this is one to ponder."
"Drinkability:This is a delicious fruit beer that gives you a lot of cherry flavor. While you drink this beer, complex flavors arise on every sip."
"D - This is a pretty easy drinking beer. Light enough and refreshing enough for a summer day. The subtle tartness propels this one forward. Very smooth without any overpowering flavors - could easily put down a few of these sitting on the back deck."
"My compliments to the brewery."
"Cheers!"
"D: I liked it, but I prefer Olde English Porter to this one. That beer has more going on, and the flavors contrast more, giving it more depth. This beer smells awesome, but taste-wise it falls a bit short."
"This, like the Olde English is a flanders more, fruit beer less."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Not much special going on here. Might be a good conversion sour for beer lovers looking to get into sours. Not a heavy sour taste. Not worth hunting, but good to try if you're in the distribution area."
"D- Very drinkable beer, the sourness gives it easy drinkability and as most sours become tiresome on the taste buds this beer begins to shine."
"drinkability is good other than the whiskey aftertaste detracting."
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, tart, and has a sticky aftertaste. Overall pretty decent."
"D= A really unique beer. Tart and sweet at the same time. Really resembles a jelly covered biscuit to me. I look forward to drinkin a few more of these."
"Review from some short, scrawled notes. Dark amber color with no head or lacing. Aroma is of brown sugar, cherries, light funk, spice and leather. Flavor has a crazy cinnamon thing going on which I thought was interesting, some cherry, and light vanilla. Nice tartness but not overly sour, spicy, and delicious. Am I crazy with this idea of cinnamon being present?? Body is full side of medium, low carbonation. Light alcohol heat on the finish, so I'm not sure of the ABV on this one, but thought it was delicious."
"Poured into a normal water glass. Was a deep mahogany color with a fairly light 2 finger head. Aroma was of dark fruits and malt with some sourness added. Initial taste was of sourness, although less than I expected, followed by chocolate and cherries. Slightly sweet, slightly sour, a good combination."
"D-A very easy drinking, good introductory beer for people interested in sour beers."
"D: Enigma: a mystery or something that can't be figured out. An aptly named beer in this case. There's so much going on in this brew yet not one dominates. The flavor experience is different every time. Great complexity and a mouthfeel that really separates out all the flavors. Magnificent brew all around!"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and slightly syrupy with a good nip of carbonation, refreshing."
"These NG beers would be off the charts if more funky and sour, but then they'd lose some of their easy drinking and ""accessible to most palates"" charm."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy. The fruity and sweet aftertaste, along with a light puckering sourness helps to prepare me for the next sip."
"D - The nice, interesting aspects of this taste fade as you drink, and then it just becomes sweet and tart, not so great. This is an above average brew to begin, but kind of descends as you go."
"This is a VERY interesting beer - one that certainly lives up to its name - quite the Enigma indeed. Glad I was able to try it and will likely drink it again if I get the chance."
"Overall a light boring fruit beer."
"I really feel like this is a sour and should be categorized as an american wild ale, but whatever."
"Very good beer. Anyone who likes fruits beers or sours should get hold of this. Wonderful gateway into the world of sour-heads, should any wish to utilize it in such a manner."
"Overall a very interesting and approachable brew - I'm glad I have a couple more - thanks again Scot!!"
"D. Goes down the hatch way too quickly. I could put away of few of these at a time. This is an enjoyable beer that I am glad NG brought back given I missed it the first time around."
"Great job, again, New Glarus. I'll be heading over the boarder to WI soon to grab another pack of this."
"pours a garnet color with very little head but has tan fresh ring til the end..i smell cherries and sour yeast.some rich malt vanilla and musty oak..the taste is sour cherries first with wild funky yeast it mixes with vanilla and almond then some earthy peat taste just a twinge of sour vinegar round this sour brown out ..it was excellent..the mouth feel is medium with tart cherries and vanilla and malt with a little wood and smoke..this is not as sour as i would have liked it to be.. but it sure did have plenty of flavors going on ... just another outstanding brew from NG..very highly recommended"
"I got this in a trade with Jojomonda, poured from a 12 ounce bottle into an SA perfect pint glass. It pours a light, clear mauve with a very fizzy white 2 finger head. The head leaves instantly and leaves no lacing. Tart cherries and acetic acid are both very strong. Sweet and sour cherries are the first taste, followed by lots of vinegary tartness. It is very drying. This brew is very light, and highly carbonated. IMO more of a flanders style ale than a fruit ale, in any event very enjoyable."
"I headed into this with some trepidation after my experience with the Old English Porter, which I found to be foul. This was a completely different beast, with a variety of complex flavors that merged nicely."
"This beer is a freakin' Enigma. Don't know what to think of it."
"I'll be getting more of this before it disappears, no doubt. A very impressive outing, one that has expanded my appreciation for this style."
"Drinks well enough for me to put down a few of these. I don't quite see a big difference between this and their Cherry Stout however. This is a bit more sour and a bit less malty, but not much of a difference in my opinion. Still a good beer."
"This is just further proof that New Glarus knows their fruits!"
"Drink this is a sour I could drink many of in a sitting. Perfect for a hot day like yesterday and today."
"This really reminds me of Monk's cafe which I find a terrible representation of the style, this one like that one is just too sweet and the oak just doesn't meld properly."
"Pours a nice medium-brown color, with just a tinge of red. A good, frothy ecru head rapidly dissipates and retreats to the sides of the glass. Good cherry aroma is immediately noticeable, along with some spice and a little wood. This one is just a little bit sour, with tart pie cherries and vanilla. I have enjoyed all of the Unplugged beers I have tried, and this one is no exception."
"I was so hoping for much more tartness and sour beer character like Lost Abbey's Red Poppy, but this beer leans too much towards the fruit beer which NG tends to do. I agree with other reviewers when I say that I hope Dan is just gearing up the palate of Wisconsin beer drinkers for a real sour beer. Either that or bring back the sour brown ale. That was a very well crafted oude bruin."
"Better drinkability than the other fruit beers from New Glarus that I've had. I still think I would only have one in an evening though."
"Drinkability is very high, probably the most drinkable New Glarus fruit beer I've had yet. I know this is labeled as a sour brown, but it really doesn't have the characteristics of that style. Overall this is a fine beer and I can see why it is a cult classic."
"2007: Audible fizz, nice head on a year-aged bottle. Spice, woody barn funk, and celery oddly enough. Still at the same level of tartness, medium carbonation. Still funky and complex as well, maybe not as distinct as it was fresh. Looking forward to finishing off the stash."
"Pretty good one by New Glarus, not the greatest but a solid offering..."
"Drinkability is good. Very good beer overall."
"D- This beer is sweet but not overly so and not as sour as anticipated. A lot of the same characteristics of the Cranbic. I was telling another BA, Dan might be training our palates for when he pulls out the big guns."
"3.5/3.5/4.5/3.5/4"
"Overall a damn good beer, and one that I wish was a year round offering. But I'll take it when I can get it, and I'm getting a lot of it this year. The only thing that I can say would benefit from improvement is the thinnish appearance. And that's something that I personally don't care too much about anyway. Keep on making hits Dan and Randy, this one's damn dandy! Cheers!"
"Overall this will be a staple in my fridge until they stop making it. I'm a huge sour fan and this has just enough sour to keep me coming back for more. No sipping this beer for me. Big gulps and it's gone."
"overall - very good beer. i'm new to sours and this is a great experience."
"This beer is nice and lively, refreshing and thirst quenching. Very easy drinking and overall delicious. To me it was reminiscent of Monk's Café Flemish Sour Red Ale, albeit with more fruity character."
"I only bought a 4 pack and I am regretting the decision already. I am tempted to open another but...I...must...resist. From the other reviews I read, it seems as though it only gets better with age."
"Tartness and sourness are muzzled here. The cherry presence reminds me more of cherry pie filling than of fresh cherry. There is a cleanness in both the mouthfeel and finish of this beer that leaves me wanting more. While quite enjoyable, I expected a slightly more bruising sour experience. Oh, what could have been with this beer. A local sour would be a real treat. Having said that, this beer drinks so smoothly and easily. That, coupled with the lack of crushing experience, make this a breeze to drink."
"Poured an amber brown/red color with close to no head, just a ring around my glass. The nose was pungent with a salty, sweet aroma, initially likened to potato chips. When examined closer, I found it to be more smoky cherry and vanilla. The taste was very smooth vanilla creamy with soft cherry notes. Just the right amount of bourbon appears here, too. If I had to lay criticism, I would say it was a bit too salty-flavored. This beer really reminded me of soft, cooked, mushy cherries. Delicious and I will seek this one out again."
"O - Very much a classic Oud Bruin, New Glarus' Enigma captures what so many of the classics to time and again; tart, earthy nose with sweeter bready malts that linger on the finish providing nice balance for an easy drinking training wheel sour."
"D: Really enjoyable beer."
"Nickd717 shared this one. This is the original batch, '03 I believe. Thanks a bunch, Nick. Turbid and murky, brown in color with a thin off-white collar. The aroma is complex and inviting, smelling intensely of funk and sherry-like oxidation with a backbone of cherries and bourbon. There's a bit of toffee and faint buttery oak as it warms. Tart cherries are surprisingly up-front on the palate for such an old beer. Caramel, bourbon and sherry are equally prominent, leading into a lightly acetic mid-palate with more sweet and tart cherry flavor and a touch of balsamic vinegar. Finishes sweet and tart with lingering cherry and bourbon flavors. Delicious."
"This is just excellent overall. I hope New Glarus brews this again, and from what I hear, it looks like they might."
"Mouth: Tastes like cherry sauerkraut, sweet & sour, cider vinegar, mulling spices. Puckeringly sour, complex, enjoyable. Quite lovely. Very sour."
"fantastic... would love to see this one come back. big thank you for new glarus."
"D: Good, I really liked this beer."
"D: It's not quite clear what this 'enigma' is, was, or was supposed to be...maybe something akin to a Flanders Red...Oud Bruin? It sure as hell is a curious thing; best way I can describe is like a 'Suicide' (you know after Little League? the Coke/Sprite/Dr Pepper/Orange Crush combo?). I was never really a big fan of that concoction; not loving this either. Glad to have tried, but thinking I'm OK with this one being 'retired'...and that's from someone who likes the 'funky' Belgian styles."
"12 ounce acquired in a trade with iowaherkeye, thanks again man for a chance to try this one, drank tonight from a pint glass, color is a dark red with brownish tone, one inch frothy light tan head that lasts a little while, some lacing at first, aroma consists of sweet malts, raspberries, cherries, yeast, vanilla, oak, and earthiness, flavor starts off with red apples and cherries, sweetness in the middle with a big berry flavor, earthy and sweet in the finish, lots of berry flavors with a little tart all the way through but more sweet than sour, definitely wild yeast in there, like how it warms up with lots of oaky barrel characteristics, sweet, fruity, and softly sour mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate level of carbonation, taste lingers for a few minutes, could drink more of this quite easily, do not know have any idea of the alcohol content but it seemed light and this drank smoothly, not heavy or overly sweet, one of the more interesting Unplugged brews, have not had a bad New Glarus fruit beer yet, it seems like it is what they do best, hopefully this one is rebrewed, this seems to have aged very well, hope to drink it again, recommended"
"If you like Belgian Red and Brett this may just be the perfect beer for you. I'd be more interested in checking out a fresh batch that still has the sour and woody flavors going on."
"Wasn't what I was expecting, but still very nice. Get one while you still can!"
"D - The weird flavors of cherry and tobacco with some sour and vinegar make this a difficult beer to enjoy much of. Definitely a one-bottle max on this one and I'm glad I'm sharing with my wife (LightTreason). That being said, it's still a damn-fine tasting beer, just not one I could enjoy a LOT of."
"New Glarus, please make more like this."
"D: The complexity of the ale is stunning. Age seems to have assisted the flavors in blending together. The ale blurs the lines, coming close to crossing into oud bruin territory."
"Drinking this right after the Phoenix Kriek might have been a bad idea, but, this is still an excellent beer. The nose is more muted, maybe a touch sulfur-like? No spice character is present. The cherry character is mild, but deep.The palate is a blend of fresh tart cherries, a little oak, brown sugar and vanilla. No oxidation is present. There's a touch of vinegar as well. This is more beer-like than the Phoenix Kriek. Excellent stuff. 4/4.5/4/4/4.5"
"Another wonderful creation from New Glarus who really knows how to mix fruit and beer. It's big and complex but also very drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a clouded red tinted brown. Nose is a vanilla wood thing. Flavor is crrrazy good. Amazing combination of vanilla, very dark cherries, wood, and cream. Cherries and cream! There's also a touch of what seems like cinammon. Really nice collaboration of flavors. Feel is smooth on liquid and low on carbonation. This is one tasty fruit beer. A bit high in the lactic content, but it's pretty nice."
"D: The alcohol seems non-existant and coupled with the delicious components of the taste, this makes for an incredibly easy and refreshing beer."
"Very drinkable beer with some great unique qualities. Its a shame you wont ever be seeing this one again."
"D : Wish I could have more. It's a shame that it's not produced anymore."
"Mouthfeel has an exceptional smoothness to it. Steady mellow carbonation with a medium body. Almost has a silkiness to it that makes it incredibly enjoyable to sip. Overall, just a solid, intense and flavorful brew. Whether you like sour beers or not you should be able to enjoy this. Glad I have another bottle sitting around, darn good stuff."
"Notes: Mad thanks to TheBlackMallard for giving me a bottle of this. It lived up to it's expectations and thensome. Isn't this inexpensive? You Wisconsin folks are lucky dogs."
"Great beer, amazing what Dan does with fruit."
"Poured into a pint glass, formed a minimal 1/8"" beige head above the slightly cloudy reddish amber brew. Head is quickly down to swirls and rim coverage, with average lacing. Aroma is tart with some sweet funk. Taste makes me think cherries and apples. Wonder if this a mixture of one of their berry brews and their vaunted Apple Ale? Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, especially for a sour beer, and drinkability is quite nice, with the tartness cutting the sweet easily. I'll add my lament to the previous that this brew is no longer."
"Thanks, ThomasHardy, for the opportunity to revisit"
"Taste: Tart, Fruity, Apple Cider, Cherries, Grapes, Leather, and a bit of Oak. Full body, medium carbonation. I would drink this all day if I could."
"this beer is much better warm than cold, however it wasn't my favorite."
"Drinkability - I think I'd enjoy this again if it were available. A fine brew in a style I don't often lean towards."
"Very interesting brew and far from unpleasant. I would definitely snatch it up again if I could get my hands on it."
"D: This is one of the easiest to drink sour beers that I've tried. It might be a good starting point to the world of more sour brews."
"Thanks to mmmmBEEEER for sharing a bottle. This beer is a lightly hazed reddish brown-amber with a thin and filmy off-white head that diminishes to nothing fairly soon. Minimal lacing. Cider-like aroma with touches of yeast and spice. Medium-bodied with a tart fruity character and malt, nut and spice flavors. The finish is sour cherries with a lingering tart fruit aftertaste. Overall a unique and interesting beer that I would try again."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"Enigma isn't an enigma at all. It's what results when a talented brewer at the top of his game is unleashed (Unplugged) and lets his imagination run wild. If brewed on a regular basis, this would be one of the best Flanders oud bruins in America. Maybe *the* best."
"This was a fantastic beer and I was glad to be able to sample one. Not that typical, not something that I ordinarily would drink, but it was a good change of pace. Nice work once again from Dan Carey!"
"D- I could have a bottle or maybe two of this but it is a bit too sweet for my palate."
"Overall, I was very impressed. I don't remember seeing this one on the shelves the last time I there so I think they have been keeping some in the basement aging. I didn't try this when it came out, but it currently is great. Grab one if you see it."
"D: truly an enigma just deciding what it is--and failing. It's sour and big, and fun. Riddle solved."
"Overall this was a very fine example of the style, tasted very unique and really was quite a pleasant surprise for me. I really liked this and would love to have some more. Seems everything coming out of here is a winner and this was no exception. Go and try it if you can."
"D - Lots of complex flavors and smells that I can't quite put my finger on. I'd try it again if I could."
"I realize that this is listed on BA as a fruit/vegetable beer, but this is one of tne of the best oud brune/sour Flemish brown ales in the world!!! Absolutely worth seeking out!!!"
"Overall, I like this beer. I wouldnt rush out to get another (I know its only brewed once too) but its a well done beer."
"I've sat on this for a while hoping for something, anything...as I did with Cherry Stout...and once again I received nothing in return. What was once fresh when Sour Brown arrived is now tired. I'm hoping the Rauch (the next unplugged) has nothing to do with Brett or oak barrels."
"The body is awesome, thick and syrupy, clinging to your mouth and lingering on long after you've swallowed. There is some noticeable carbonation running through your mouth and a wonderful alcohol warming feel. I like this beer a lot, I need to get more of this stuff before it disappears."
"Drinkability: Too bad this was a one shot beer. Very tasty and very drinkable. This is a drink I would like to have several of. One note, this beer is one of the few that I believe was better while it was colder. It seemed to lose a bit of it's complexity as it warmed. Still a very good beer."
"Pours a murky ruby red with a nice brown tint. Head is a good two fingers that quickly dies down to just about nothing. Stickiness is non-existant. Smell has a big cherry character with a bit of chocolate malt, almost seems like it's their Belgian Red mixed with their Uff-Da. Some sour smell in the nose too, very unique smelling to say the least. Taste starts off with a great cherry sweetness followed by a sour cherry aftertaste. A bit of bready flavors appear, but are dominated by the cherry. Not a whole lot other than cherries going on in terms of flavor, but I love it. This basically tastes like my grandma's cherry pie. Tongue tingles from start to finish. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. I really like this brew, not as sour as the Belgian Red but at the same time not as sweet. Maybe someday they'll brew this one again."
"Its appearance is a deep choclate brown with an ever so tinge of pink to it. The head is light tan and has that slight pinkness to it as well. Strong aromas of tobacco, oak, chocolate malt, sour cherries and some sweet molasses dominate the nose. Such a complex bouquet of aromas that it is really something that is hard to pin down. The taste is strong sour cherries and back grounds of chocolate malt. The oak definitely comes out and adds a sense of sweetness to it. The mouth feel is light and smooth almost cloying. Very easy going down. If I wasn't so partial to the Belgian Red I would say that this is the best thing out of New Glarus ever."
" ~ To me this is a good after dinner drink or desert type beer. Even for breakfast perhaps? Not the type I look forward to indulging in again."
"Surprisingly it also matches quite well with a mild baby swiss."
"Pretty drinkable. I doubt I'll have another tonite, but it won't be long before I get an urge to taste this interesting brew again. Really well done."
"I love the New Glarus Brewery, but Enigma was not to my liking. I still suggest you go to the (impeccably clean) brewery and take the tour."
"Drinkability - Where can I get more?"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating system into a pint glass. The color was a cloudy reddish brown. It had almost no head and what was there quickly disappeared. The aroma was sour cherries with an oaky vanilla backbone. This age has aged a bit so the aroma was toned down. The taste also seemed mellowed out by time. It was good but missing the sour cherry bite that I love in these beers. Overall, glad I got to try it but wish I could've tied it when it was new. (3.5, RB, T, Y)"
"Pours a cloudy dark amber/brownish color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy off-white head, not much sticky lacing at all. The nose is tangy, mostly cherries, spices, and some caramel. The taste is very nice though, mostly malts, cherries/dark fruit, there's some bourbon going on as well, and some caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice little brew, would definitely drink another, glad to have had a chance to try it out."
"D - So different it has to be tried if you can still get your hands on it. Still, its a sipper and not exactly mouth watering."
"D- the beer has a balance which makes it a pretty drinkable beer"
"I like most of New Glarus's beers, but thier fruit beers, while great, always toe the line to being too fruity for me. I like that enigma has the raspberry notes, but then is layered with the brett yeast, and the alcohol, and the bourbon notes. I think this beer is a very interesting experiment and is a nice break from the ordinary."
"Another highly recommended brew from New Glarus."
"This beer is not exceptional, but OK."
"Hazy and muddy-river brown. Almost no head. Very sour lambic and cherry odor. Some hints of vanilla. When cold, very sour cherry like Belgian Red but with more malt backbone and a little less sweet. As it warms, sourness becomes more lambic-like and horsey. Nicely tart and malty. Medium to full bodied. A very well-made beer, as should come as no surprize. I think they should have this one and their sour brown as regulars in their lineup."
"A very nice surprise. i didn''t know what to expect with this one but came away impressed. I think it's more of a Flanders Oud Bruin than a fruit/vege beer though. Recommended"
"A fine beer, an honor to drink."
"It reminds me very much of Belgian Red on tap."
"I'm pretty sure this is my first from New Glarus's Unplugged series and it's definately a winner. Unique in every aspect and a great sipper."
"drinkability: Rates high on the fun to drink scale. It is sweet but Id say very blanced."
"Like a lot of other lighter sour beers, there's nothing in this beer to stop you from drinking ten of them (other than the availability)-- drinkability is awesome."
"A wonderfully zingy, fruity, earthy little brew the Enigma is. New Glarus has taken the Belgian Red And Raspberry Tart and turned that style into another snappy, fun drink to behold. Yum!"
"Overall: This is a very nice offering from one of my most sought after breweries. I'd love to try this next to some of the Jolly Pumpkin and Rodenbach beers. Hopefully New Glarus will make this again, and more importantly start distributing to MI. Since either of these will unlikely happen anytime soon, La Roja from JP will hold me over. I can't see this getting much better over time....just maybe more tart."
"The ugliest beer I've ever drank, but as far as sour beers go, this has to be my personal favourite. Everything is kept in check (sweetness, sourness, acidity), but still remains complex. Thanks Demcorhip!"
"Overall, a very tasty beer. I like this beer because it doesn't hit you over the head with fruit as much as the brewery's Belgian Red or Raspberry Tart. The finish is somewhat dry and tart which makes you want more...wow...this is a great beer and the best of brewer Dan Carey's Unplugged Series yet."
"Tart and tangy, this is one wild brew with funky aftertaste."
"Overall: truly is quite an enigma to drink. I liked sipping it and contemplating what I tasted. As a good comparison I came up with the sugar covered tart/sour gummy candies. I liked it a lot, New Glarus does good things with these funky yeast strains."
"Thanks for sharing this Viggo!"
"Pours a very hazy reddish brown, thick off white head, some lace spots, decent retention, neat colour. Smell is sweet/sour, very malty, some chocolate notes, toffee, some fruits, but dont really get the cherry, nice sour aroma though. Taste is caramel, sour and vinegar through the middle, sweet fruits and brown sugar in the finish, bit more sourness, bit light on flavour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth but not enough flavour. Enjoyable though, and definately a treat, thanks Scott!"
"This is quite a distinctive brew. I wonder if it is the cherries that add that sort of oatmeal raisin cookie flavor. This beer is really nice; I really like the interplay of fruit, malt and fermentation character. Really the best way I can describe it is that this beer tastes like a beery version of an oaky oatmeal raisin cookie. I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I am certainly digging this beer. If I lived in Wisconsin, I would beg for this to be a year round beer as this would be a perfect staple in the beer fridge."
"SECOND TRIAL: I like sour. I like sour a lot, so it's not surprising that I enjoy this beer. That being said, I don't think it's best sour I've had, but it is very good. It pours a very cloudy, dense brownish-red. The aroma is sour cherries, apples, and a little alcohol. The taste is quite similar and the finish is slightly dry. Although, my second tasting (which came quite a while after the first) seemed slightly less sour and slightly more alcohol-y. Overall a very interesting beer, I'm glad that the Unplugged line seems to take real chances. Good... bad... it doesn't really matter as long as it's something different (although this one does happen to be delicious)."
"That sweet luscious tang of pomegranate and sour coconut juice rise from the glass. Lubricious and sassy, with faint pine fusels, nips of higher alcohols, rising warmth and glowing brett. Great Stuff. Lighter on the apple skins and edging more towards acetone, yet with a pleasing grape must edge. Pours a murky ruddy amber, hazed and rimmed with off-white. On the tongue, a potent kick of sweet acidity. Rich, warm and mouth filling with a Christmas potpourri of tangled florals and perfumes. Lots of fermenting pale fruits over a luscious creamy malt base. The sour notes and wild funk are beautifully blended into the malt character here. First with the bold flow of oaked farm fields and cheese must, then into a creamy grain of roasted caramel and toasted almonds. Sweet and silky. Then out the back door with fading hop presence, maybe more than the style typically brings. On the palate, so airy and mystifying with gentle breezes of sweetness and acidity. Not scorching, yet gentle and calm, with a deft use of wildness to make a very peaceful and enjoyable version."
"Big thanks Sammy!"
"D: Quite a pleasure to drink. Utterly smooth and surprisingly well balanced between the tart and the sweetness. Highly recommended as it will change your stance on fruit style beers. Truly an enigma and very complex."
"Poured a reddish gold into a sample glass. Significant pinkish head that fades fast. Strong cherry and caramel malt aroma. Slick, oily mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Cherry with hints of coffee beans and molasses, and an acidic apple-juice aftertaste."
"Thanks for the sample Sammy!"
"Thanks jpm30 for this unexpected bonus, you are generous to a fault."
"drinkability is good. alcohol is balanced fairly well against the fruity and sour/tart flavours, especially as it warmed and had time to breathe. nice and enjoyable."
"thanks to JD!"
"D- This beer has a nice complexity but it is very well blended. There is a cherry coconut flavor that has an interesting fruit punch flavor but also a hint of wild ale to it. This is a very smooth drinkable beer with lots of good character."
"Into a tulip glass, poured a good brown color, cloudy, a decent starting head that shrinks to a swirly film, a little lacing, pretty nice lookin. Aroma is prominently sour toned, oaky hints from conditioning, vanilla, some fruits in there, hard to distinguish, but I want to say rasberries. Taste is along the same lines, sour, sweet fruits, tart rasberry, the oaks line the edges of this delicious brew. The mouth is crisp and dry, sour, well bodied, and overall, its just a finely crafted piece of work. Makes me with I got the 4-pack."
"Kinda like an Oud Bruin and Kriek blend, however the emphasis is on the sweet, allowing a tart counterpart for balance. The beer shows a pleasent malt sweetness (Brown Ale), but with a tart, candy-like sourness. A cherry aroma helps to solidify the tartness, while adding an added fruit sweetness. An earthy, aged-hop character adds balance to the sweetness and contribues an earthy, dirty complexity. With all this going on, the flavors are well melded and properly aged. A solid malt sweetness wants to play heavy to the mouth, but with the tarness acting as a thinning agent to make the beer very drinkable while adding a mild dryness and astringency late. A cherry flavor persists even after the remaining flavors subside. Unusual flavors, but likable nevertheless."
"Pours an off whie head, cloudy with a red caramel body. Smell is funky. Carbonation is medium to high- very sour ale. The cherries are present, but not the main act like the Belgian Red. The brown ale aspect is more evident in the after taste. I actually enjoyed this more than Belgian Red which I'm sure is sacrilege of some sort. Glad I had a chance to try this unique offering."
"Pulled this bottle out of the fridge and poured it into my favorite glass. Color was brownish orange and cloudy. Head was tan and dissipated almost immediately. Very disappointed in the lack of head retention. Smell was somewhat sweet/malty. First taste was a surprise. My first reaction was that it tasted a little like a wine cooler, but I've always thought that about the fruity beers. It's actually pretty good, bot nothing I'll drink very regularly. I don't think I'd even want to drink two in a row, so the drinkability would be considered low for me."
"Bottle courtesy of Monger: Poured a dirty brown/reddish color ale with a medium light foamy head with average retention and good lacing. Aroma consists of oak with some tart notes and some red wine characteristics. Taste is a very well balance mix of oak with some tartness and some acidic notes well balance by light cherries and some dry red wine. Body is above average with some low filtration and medium carbonation. Very well done and definitely something that I would like to try again."
"Drinkability is through the fricking roof. I know where there is more and I am going to clean them out. I will not say where."
"Pours out a goodsized head with an almost buttery smell in the backround. It's almost lambic-like with just a faint hint of horse blanket. The taste isn't quite as sour as the lambic and it's more bitter, the flavor isn't as smooth with bitter flavors it has. It still has a malty buttery flavor in it's backround. The mouthfeel is very carbonated giving it a bite. Overall I started out loving it, but I don't think I'd reach into my cellar for a while for this one."
"Good stuff!"
"After reading the label, I figured I would review this with kreik guidlines in mind, and, although there are similarities, the name of this beer definately fits. I'm off to email the brewery to reconsider this for another run."
"Drinkability: Good lord, I just wish I had stocked up on more of these when I was in Wisconsin. I could drink this all the time. Complex yet mellow, big and creative yet affordable, sour but not too sour. Way up there on my list, for sure, and definitely the best I've had from New Glarus."
"The sales clerk at Riley's said it all: ""This beer changes every time you drink it."""
"I do love the red/brown murky appearance though."
"Bottle via trevorwideman. Consumed with rudge75 after drinking the Belgian Red. Dark red in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of cherries, a hint of vinegar, and vanilla. In the mouth a great balance is struck between the cherry, oak (vanilla), nutty almond, and gentle sourness. A cleamer finishing than expected, but thats not neessarily a bad thing. Complex and flavorful, yet very easy to drink. Good stuff and it made an interesting counterpoint to the sweeter and more straightforward Belgian Red."
"Edit: See Bighuge's review below, I think he picks this brew apart pretty well."
" New Glarus is the undisputed king of fruit beers in America."
"I'm not the biggest fan of the Belgian Red but really liked the Sour Brown so I guess I'm a little different than most reviewers. On pouring it has a muddy brown color with a minimal head. Doesn't look the most appealing but I guess it's about like what I expected. Smells woody with apples. Some sweet apples and some earthy notes. Taste begins sweeter with more cherry than the nose would let on. Some vanilla with some more sweet notes, almost a chocolate flavor but not quite. Slightly sour but the sour brown never truly shows itself. Smoother than expected but I almost want a bit more acidity in the finish. The flavors blend but don't come out fully. Still, its nice and somewhat crisp. There's a solid flavor overall but its nothing great."
"Murky looking brown appearance. Thin, bubbly beige head. Lacing is spotty in nature and low in quantity. Aroma has a little dusty, cellar-like feel to it. Also some sweet and sour aspects to the nose. Cherry and brown sugar. And a little bit of barrel character. Oaky. The flavor follows suit with some of that sweet and sour character. More sweet than sour though. Vanilla and cherry are present. Brown sugar like sweetness. Maybe a little molasses. Moderately carbonated and medium bodied. Finish is a little dry. Good rendition here."
"Speaking of which, thanks to kmpitz2 for the taste!"
"Murky, wortish, red brown fluid fills the Rodenbach flute. Red-tinted cream khaki head recedes to a clingy film. Light vinegar, flint, and horse blanket cut through rummy cherries and whiff of smoky sugar. Palate reveals moderately sweet cherries and cherry sorbet/juice up front. Whaa? Where's the sour vinegar funk? Oh, there it is; better late than never. The back of the palate brings out more complexity, with whiskeyish malt, vanilla, oak, toffee, before sourness and acidic flavors takeover the dry finish. There is a little residual vanilla and cherry leftover though. Spritzy, adventurous carbonation. Medium body. All in all, I really like the sweet and sour interplay, especially with the oaky vanilla mixed in. Very well done."
"Overall impression: Enjoyable but not for me. I'm not a huge fan of fruit in beer. Especially if it masks the typical qualities of beer (barley, hops, yeast, etc). You can't get past the sour cheeries in this one. It's well made but I wouldn't want another. Probably would pair well with dark chocolate. Worth a shot."
"1/4 12oz. bottles shipped down from dirtylou"
"Thank god New Glarus is in Wisconsin!"
"Drinkability? Heck no. No desire to have this beer again."
"Many, many thanks to nflmvp for this golden opportunity."
"An Uncensored, Uncut and Unplugged Thanks for yet another New Glarus winner shipped West by my mate BigHuge. Recommended."
"Not my cup of tea. Because it kinda tastes like flavored tea. Spices might make it a good holiday choice."
"This is another great fruit beer from New Glarus...certainly more complex and better suited for the beer geeks than the Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart....feels more like a Belgian beer than those....well done"
"I was honestly a little let down by this one. I was under the impression it was going to have a much more ""wild"" taste to it. Of course we shouldn't go into a beer expecting much of anything, but sometimes it's unavoidable. It was enjoyable for a one time thing, but I won't go out of my way to try and get another one."
"Taste is just plain unusual, yet wow. All the fruits I mentioned before make an appearance, but the straight-up farmhouse funkiness absolutely smashes the palate when this beer hits the tongue. Yes sir, there's a little Belgian trickery in here. There's nothing bitter about this beer at all, just lots of sweet and tart flavour to make you salivate for more. My only complaint is that the carbonation is a little too fizzy and rather siezes the tongue on first sip. Other than that this is a real sipper that is really very unique and pleasant, I'm very glad to have the opportunity to try it."
"Smells like an apple orchard on a warm day, with some blackberry. Pours a murky rust with a fast diminishing head. Very different if you drink it without making an effort to smell it at the same time. The tast and aroma mix to complement each other, with some of the mustiness of fermenting fruit enhancing the sweet/sour taste. Very drinkable in that it gets better with each sip. This is a very aptly named beer in that it seems to mysteriously change from a forceful cacophony of flavors at first to a subtle, floral, easy drinking beer at the last. Yea, I haven't used the word ""cacophony"" for a while."
"Later, while on the brewery a the brewer hinted that they pasteurize this beer by pumping it into the boiled kettle and heating it to 140F. I get the feeling they do this or something to stop the brett. action on all their fruit beers. No of them seem very hard or lambic like, to me, give the fermentation process they described on the tour."
"D: This beer would scare the bejesus out of non seasoned beer drinkers. It could have gone either way...but too much cheese and it could be a serious turn off. Personally, I think its brilliant. Another feather in the cap for New Glarus, one of the finest breweries in the world."
"Very Good."
"I didn't enjoy this as much as I hoped. I didn't really know what to expect, and I'm still not sure I fully understand this beer after trying it. I suspect this might be why it's labeled a fruit/vegetable beer as opposed to a sour brown or other style. The flavors are interesting, but don't add up to a winner in my book. I would have enjoyed more tartness and more carbonation on the palate. I have a few bottles and I will be revisiting this one again..."
"This is odd. Very sour, brown, wood tasting. Cherries, citrus, bitterness. Very weird. Good, but weird. Brown and red colored. Hazy. Hard to drink. Very aquired taste. Like a young, super oaky, oxidized Bordeaux. Good, but too strange to ever buy again, unless I acquire a taste for this. I've had Duchesse du Bourgogne, and it's sort of like this."
"What a rich and decadent session one could have with this brew. The depth and complexity have me sipping this creation in blissfull amazement. This is a very serious beer and is definately created for the serious beer drinker, and isnt something that would go over well with a typical macro drinker. A great beer to treat onself with when looking for quality over quantity (although it would be a pleasure to enjoy a few of these in a sitting)."
"D: Absolutely addictive, the only the thing that could possibly turn you off is the price. Worth every drop, every penny."
"Note to self - slowly going downhill with time."
"Poured a murky reddish brown color, with a good off white colored head with surprisingly, good retention. Smell is of oak, vanilla, subdued cherries, sour apples, and a hint of bourbon. Taste starts off sour, but slowly and seamlessly transfers into an oaky, vanilla, boubon finish. There is tartness throughout the taste, but everything is blended together so nicely that there didn't seem to be an overpowering flavor, all parts were seemingly equal. Medium bodied, lower carbonation, little bit of a dry oaky finish. Drinkability is good in the sense that it's a pleasure to drink, but I felt this one is a sipper. Try it before it runs out again."
"I didn't think too much of this following my initial first few sips but Enigma definitely grew on me and by the end of the glass I was enjoying it quite a bit. Not something I'd probably want more than one of in a sitting, but it's good regardless."
"Although perhaps brewed as a one-time offering, it's the first I saw it on the shelf . Looks like it was retired after one review in 2005, and now it has been offered again, or maybe just old stuff is reaching the shelves in my part of Wisconsin,"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet & mild tart mix, along with a gentle oaky dryness. Pretty nice."
"drinkability: a joy"
"12 oz bottle. This brew pours a deep amber color with a half finger of head that falls to a nice film over top of the beer. It has a moderate amount of haze. and there is no carbonation visable. In the light, there are some nice ruby highlites in the beer as well. The nose is nice sour cherry, with a very solid oak tannin and a light tartness that adds a nice character to it. The flavor is definately reminding me of the sour brown they made a year or so ago. It has a nice creamy character along with a solid sour cherry in there. It finishes with a very solid tannin character from the oak. It is tasty. The feel is very creamy with moderate body and a light carbonation. It is really smooth. This is a really tasty beer. I think the oak character really sets this one apart from the other NG beers that it is similar to. I will be interested to see if time makes any difference in what this one becomes. I think it is tasty now, and could get even better in time."
"Enigma is not the explosively big beer that I expected but it makes up for it with interesting subtlety and by simply being pleasurable. Its quite the hybrid stylistically and goes highly recommended to fans of fruit beers, Flemish reds, sour browns, and barrel aged beers alike."
"Carbonation was perfect, allowing the finish to fade out into a warm oaky aftertaste. A fascinating type, and definitely worth trying out again. I think I'll try to pair it with a juicy grilled steak next time."
"Drinkability/Overall: the oak aging has done well to smooth out and mellow this beer. Refined, and tight as a knot. This is one to drink AT room temperature as it retains a distracting metallic bite when chilled. Another great cherry beer from the guy who does it best."
"We need a BA Wood and Barrel Aged beer style!"
