"Excellent beer. Complex but no bad taste at all"

"I dunno. It's not an Oud bruin. Tastes like a stale amber. I still absolutely love the label."
"Er, bacteria, where?, not awful but old-feeling, kinda reminds me of a 5-year old Belgian tripel. Plenty of better (and actual) oud bruins out there."

"Amazing !   Dark in color, a deep copper with reddish hues.  Clear, yet thick.  No haze, no floaties, just deep rich color.  A decent foam head that fades a little quickly, but leaves a trace of lacing.  The malt aroma is great, sweet, with very mild hops aroma.  Flavor is rich and malty, some darker grain, good hop balance - more would destroy this beer.  Almost has a creamy element to it.  Mouthfeel is smooth with good texture.  No bite, carbonation is perfect.  I love this beer !  This brewery never fails to impress.  The beer has a good alc content without any of the ""winey"" off flavors, twang or sourness.   I could drink this all night -might regret it later with the 6% and 22oz bottles, but damn it is good !"

"Looks hazy,medium-dark brown close to a amber yet more tones walnut..smell is subdued malt and some fruity essence such as strawberry, raspberry and lil chocolate in there too..taste is much more complex than the smell. Taste is funky, and definate complex malt profile, medium sour notes, light, refreshing..some carmel and chocolate undertoneszzvery low hop character, yet slight presence. Funky, yet not too spicy..pair great with pizza, brie in puff- pastry, and this beer shall compliment dishes that are bready (pizza, pasta).. This beer needs a heavier or chewy-er food to compliment it's lightness and juicy/funky character..muscles with this beer in the stock..butter, cheese, or bread with this one should do.."

"the worst grand teton beer out there, at least the 2013 batch, that ive had, and its not close. this is not an oud bruin, a far cry from it really. no sourness whatsoever, no lactic tartness or even funk. i dont know what went wrong here, and if it didnt taste okay, i would score it far lower. as a belgian brown, its okay, as an oud bruin its an utter embarrassment. hazy light brown amber liquid with some density and a patchy airy half inch of tan head. it smells fruity like apples, esters from a funny belgian yeast dominate, stale brown ale malts, a touch of chocolate, and caramel grains all bounce around. nowhere is wild fermentation, nowhere is funky yeast, and nowhere is any sign of the beer this claims to be. grand teton is an awesome brewery, they make nothing but unique and well crafted beers, all of them, but this is an abomination. sweet fruit, rotting apples, caramel malt, and stale belgian yeast all collide in a beer i dont care to ever taste again. ive heard a lot of different takes on what the deal is with this, but i can only gather its a mistake that should have never been released. an okay brown ale, not an oud bruin, avoid this one at all cost."
"Home tasting, 22oz into Tulip. 2/20/14."

"I am really impressed with the appearance on this beer. A moderately aggressive pour down the middle of the glass produced a three finger fluffy off white head. It has slowly dissipated leaving half a finger of tight bubbles. Carbonation is streaming off the bottom of the glass. Color is a cloudy burnt orange at the edges of the glass becoming a deeper amber in the center. The nose is a little bland with Belgian yeast esters taking over most of the aroma. A slight caramel malty sweetness is detected as well as a mineral earthyness. There is maybe a tiny hint of funk. Taste is much better than the aroma. Up front I get caramel sweetness and a traditional Belgian ale yeast taste. In the middle of the palate I start to get the slightly sour notes. My mouth puckers for a moment, but on the back end it is taken over by an earthy bitterness that is a little overwhelming. Dry finish. I get where other reviewers have been coming from. I would have really liked the earthy bitterness to at the back end to have been replaced by a puckering sourness to complement the caramel sweetness. That said, a highly enjoyable and drinkable ale and perhaps serves as a good ""introduction"" to sour beers."
"Overall: Meh, wouldnâ€™t seek it out. Really sort of tastes like it is too young. Needs time to develop character."

"Medium bodied with light carbonation, smooth and easy to drink. Has both a sweet and slightly tart aftertaste. This is a different type of Flanders Oud Bruin than I am used to, but I like it."
"O: A great representation of the style, and I'm happy to see that an American brewery is pulling it off so well. Recommended, even if it's just to use the bottle's artwork in your interior decorating."
"Final thoughts...an average representation of the style. None of the slightly sour notes I'd hoped for or anticipated. I disliked the beer and was somewhat underwhelmed and confused. Almost seemed like Grand Teton should have allowed the Lacto and Brett to age out a few more months. That would have provided for a more sour and less sweet beer. Would not buy again or recommend. Sorry guys."

"O- Not a great beer. I don't enjoy this very much."
""
"O-I was very disappointed in this beer. It lacked many of the sour, acidic, vinous characteristics that make an oud bruin an oud bruin. Instead, there is a mildly sweet prune flavor; some bitter, metallic tastes; and an earthiness that literally tastes like mud. I'm not sure if this batch was off or if I got a bad bottle, but I will not be looking for this brew again."
""
""
"O: Malty without any acidity really. Grand Teton seems to have some major problems whenever they use souring yeast/bacteria, as the beers I've tried that are advertised as sour never are."
""
"I don't taste much Brett or any hint of sourness. Bottled on date is not quite legible, but 2013 sometime. A hint of fruit that makes me think of the cheap passion fruit juice in the supermarket cooler. A touch of butter. Just enough bitterness and dark nastiness to keep it from being a good soda pop. This just seems like a lot of trouble for a sweet, soupy brew. From the 22 oz bottle bought for $10.25 at Bottlecraft in San Diego. At least they had the decency to put a cap on it instead of the cork nonsense."

"Oud Bruin pours a reddish color with no head. Their is a nice mellow fruity and sour aroma. The taste is slightly fruity and sweet, a bit sour, and has a nice yeasty undertone. Full flavor, but the carbonation is a too light. Overall its an enjoyable beer, and a rather average one at that."

"Taste is similarly ill-defined, and more in line with a Dubbel or BSDA. Not sour, not even tart. Unfortunately 6 months of cellar conditioning has done very little. A vague tangy bitterness and some nutmeg, toasted malt. A little sweet at first then dry and oddly bitter in the aftertaste. Definitely hasn't seen a barrel or even oak chips. This beer was a waste of money and a sad, distant facsimile of an otherwise unique style. Out of my 40 Oud Bruin reviews, this appears to be the third worst (after Bourgone des Flanders and Rivertown Pestilence)."

"Taste is sweet malted yeast. No acidity or sourness whatsoever. Way too sweet for an oud bruin. Taste like a brown ale brewed with Belgian yeast, which is not a good combination. I had a few gulps at this and poured the rest down the sink. Sorry, Grand Teton, love your beers but this one is a total misfire."
"This is not bad. Just fairly tame. I like in your face vinegary, acidity. Probably the only style that I enjoy over balance. I don't want to say disappointed, but not exactly what I look for in the style."
""

"D - This isn't a bad beer, but it thoroughly fails to live up to its stylistic description. There is almost no acidity and while there is a little funk in the aroma it tastes like a sort of imperial brown ale. Not something I would drink again and a bit ofa disappointment."
"Overall: fairly boozy and sour with a nice belgian yeast presence. I havent had too many of these but this one seems to have many elements making it complex."
""
"Pours a murky dark orange-red with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour and tart with malt, grain, and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with slight sour fruit and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is pretty disappointing for the style."

"Maybe I will buy a bottle and let it age for awhile to let the various cultures work their souring magic on this beer."

"Kinda of disappointing, hard to review... Far from fitting the style, not sure if it just needs more time or what, but it doesn't fit the category, much more of a Belgian... A good brew, but just not close to what I was expecting."
"Pours a hazy, brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, alcohol, sourness, slight pale malt, and dark citrus. It smells more like slightly sour Belgian Tripel than a Flanders Oud Bruin. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is a moderate level of sourness. Tastes of sourness (grapes?), alcohol, sweet malt, slight hops, yeast, and slight pale malt. Overall, while this is a tasty beer it is not my favorite example of the style. I prefer FOB's to be more sour, though the blend in this beer is quite good."

"But overall it's sweet, fresh and complex, especially when you drink it to enjoy it and not overthink it. With a little more time to mellow (I drank this one about 2 months after it was bottled), it'd likely be great in both worlds."

"We really dig how the tartness is mellow and not in-your-face like other Oud Bruins we've tried. This beer is proof that some American brewers can brew just as well as their Belgian counterparts. A plate of beer-braised spareribs would do the trick for a pairing."
"Especially as it warmed some, became a more drinkable beer, but that does not take away from its deficits."
"Pours a hazy brown with a short head. The aroma has a bit of band-aid to it, and then transitions into some acetic sour and funky barnyard smells. Right on the edge of being too much, and the band-aid is already pushing it over the brink. Thankfully, all of this mellows a bit in the mouth. The taste has some nice, more restrained barnyard elements and there is a touch of sweetness. A bit of rubberband creeps in, but its not overbearing and doesn't detract as much as it distracts. A bit much overall and a little rough in the mouth. I wouldn't say they have this style down pat, but I love the fact that more breweries are producing beers like this and taking up the challenge."
"Pretty tasty and highly drinkable regardless."
"Light and refreshing, it is one tasty brew, but it is hard to take as an oud bruin; yes, there is some tartness and funkiness, but very little. It is somewhat acidic, but mostly fruity and malty, with a nice dry finish. It does not really fit the expected profile, but it is still a good brew."
"Thanks, brewjones, for the opportunity."
"The drinkability was unique. I drank it, and I kept coming back for more, not so much because I loved it but because I kept wanting to figure it out. My brain and tongue were confused. It is a cross between two styles I like, so I finished off the bottle, but I am not so sure I would rush to drink more."
"Aging this has done wonders for it.. only similar to the original and 10x the complexity.. much much better with some time in the bottle... I have a couple more in the cellar, and am going to try and find the last couple that may be in town."
"GT's a fine brewer, but this one's a miss for me. It feels like we missed out on something because it's not flavorful enough...yet there's a good flavor buried in there."
"Pours a dark murky ruby hue with a big two finger khaki colored head that dies down to a thin bubble filled layer. Stickiness is pretty damn good, lacing all over the place. Smell is, well, different. Almost like a wild ale with sour fruits and an apple cider like aroma. Some wood like smells tingle the nose as well. Taste is weak, but some fruit like flavors are mostly present; apples, cherries, grapes. Aftertaste is a woody vanilla flavor. Not a whole lot more in terms of flavor, a bit one dimensional. Mouthfeel is a light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is a bit tough for me because of the watery sugar flavors. This beer is just about all over the place, could use some balance. Maybe I just don't understand the style, but I didn't enjoy this beer. Gald I had the opportunity though."
"Poured into a chalice a beautiful clean/clear light red/mahongy color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head, some nice little islands and sticy lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, slightly sour/tangy, yeasty, some spices, and some nice caramel tones. The taste is a little sour/tangy, enough for the tongue to know it's there, malty, yeasty, there are some spice's in there, and a nice touch of caramel. The finish is alittle dry. Medium body, well-rounded brew. Very drinkable, a nice and easy brew to drink. Glad to have had a chance to try it, thanks Bill."
"Overall, it's a very washed out and watery flemish. Even if the flavors were bolder, I think they would not compare well to other sour beers. definitely not worth the $12. It's not offensive, there's just not much there."
"12 ounce bottle, not for retail sale sample. Very light in color, with a filmy head. Sweet fruits and pumpkin spice aroma, seems way off for the style. Flavor is absolutely nothing like an oud bruin. Where do I begin? Sweet beyond belief, not sour at all, no barrel characterÂ….was this even aged in wood?. The bacteria cultures just didnÂ’t seem to work any magic. Really, really just awful and a drain pour for me. I sampled this next to Russian River Supplication and this beer absolutely tasted and smelled like nothing, when compared to the Supplication. I sampled what I believe was a non bottle conditioned sample, so if my score ends up being against that grain, IÂ’ll pony up and by a Liter."
"Further sips in and the sourness is still there but the malt presence balances out the brew nicely. I think Grand Teton has done a nice job within the style. I'm glad I bought 2 botttles for myself and 1 for a trade to another fan of the Grand Teton's Cellar Reserve series. This one is, imho, another well crafted brew. Thanks Grand Teton!"
"Thanks to jcwattsrugger for bringing this back for me."
