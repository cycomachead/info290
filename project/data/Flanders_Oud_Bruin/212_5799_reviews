"Fruit, malt, tartness and spice on the nose. Pours dar brown with a thin film of a cap. The palate is sour and fruity over rich malt sweetness. The balance is tilted slightly to the sweet."
""
"Only mildly tart with hints of fruit, mostly apples. Subtle spices blended in. Medium bodied with ample amount of fine bubbles.  Neither dry nor moist nor slick in the finish. Lingering fruit flavor in the end."
""
"Really comes off as a session like oud bruin and dumbed down.  Easy drinking, but really nothing exciting."
""
"Pours a cloudy and darker honey brown. Has hues in it and a fat enough head of tan foam that fell slowly enough to leave lace.    Nose is vibrant with black cherry and dark fruits.  Some treacle and a good little hint of something sour.  Taste is rich and crisp malt.  Lots of layers to this one.  Dark fruits, a touch of spice and that treacle.  This has a slight hop bitter that comes to the tongue just as the small pucker from sour kicks in and your mouth starts to really water.  This finishes dry and with a big juiciness. Medium mouthfeel."
""
"Love it. Surprisingly delicious. The sour taste is slight, but enjoyable."
"Not my style of beer, and an average sour in comparison."
"Simply not what I like in a beer, its way to sweet with a sluggish body. The bottle with paper wrapping looks very attractive though."
""
""
"It's a damn good oud bruin, accessible for someone new to sours while still holding up several years later."
""

"From green 12.7oz bottle, pours a perfectly clear red-tinted dark brown, one finger thick creamy but fast fading pink-khaki colored head. Sheet of lace sticks for a few inches down. Smell: raspberry, sour peach note, leather, barnyard note. Sparse... fruit and not much behind it. Taste: cranberry-raspberry blend, brown sugar, herbal with woody and green apple candy notes in the finish. Light bodied with fizzy carb and a fast finish... seeing the abv online this makes sense, but makes the beer come off as underpowered. Tasty and refreshing at least. Bottled 5/2014."
"I really enjoyed this one. I need to drink more sours. Fantastic job!"
"Appearance is between bordeaux-red and brown, with a white head that rapidly vanishes. Aroma of red fruits, which also reappears in the taste. This, in combination with a medium sour taste, gives the beer a winey taste. Love the beer, love the style of beer."
""
"After visiting Russian River and loving their sours I now find myself gravitating in that direction. Seeking out sours I am even more convinced that RR does them right, having said that this is a pretty decent sour, abiet quite different but still darn tasty."

"I actually don't usually like sours, but this one was pretty good. More drinkable than I expected it to be and didn't completely destroy the palate. Malt brings some sweetness and the sour taste that is there is more of a citruc sour and not a vinegar one that I expected."

"Pours out a deep brown with red hues.  Smells of caramel malts with a very subdued barrel/sour nose.  Flavor has a sour twang, but not a very strong vinegar/barrel character as one would expect from this style.  A bit one note.  Malt tastes of general ""sweet.""  Mouthfeel is light and prickly.  This isn't bad, but really lacking in many ways."

"O: I really liked this one. The mix of slight sour, dark fruit and rich earthiness really worked well together. This beer had a lot of flavor, but in a well rounded way unlike other beers that just try to be the most sour or the most roasty."
""

"Very nice polite likable brown, perhaps a nice mild springboard if you were introducing someone to belgian sours. For my own purposes, there are some better examples I'd reach for over Bacchus"
""

"The palate is kind of the same way- needs a little zip. There is a definite sour presence, but it only goes to 7. The flavors are more earthy, and the dark sugar dominates. The balance and mouthfeel are right where they should be, and it's quite easy to drink, but would be helped by some more complexity of flavors. The key word seems to be 'pleasant', where 'memorable' is unfortunately what the price commands. Under the right circumstances I could see knocking a few back, though."

"O: The bottle recommends a temperature of 41Â°F, a temperature some might think is too cold for a specialty beer. Absolutely sample it at this flavor, as it really allows the tartness of this beer to shine. It is funky in flavor, but this is part of the character, and actually quite enjoyable."
"I recently bought several different Belgians to try out after a trip to Brussels. This one is good quality Belgian Dark Ale. Has subtle tastes of spices with minor after taste. It works well with charcuterie and cheeses. It's a good overall beer but I wish it had more flavor. But does not stand out and for the price you can find better brews."
""
"O- Lacks character. Needs to be more sour or at least have more fruit flavor."
"Heavily oxidized and not very tasty when cold but has good tartness when warmed up. Do not drink this cold! It transforms from tasting like a mistake to a snappy, apple cider vinegar sourness that bites with sharpness and still has sweetness to round it out. Glad I let it warm up."
"Nicely executed and easy to drink. We'll meet again..."
"A beer I've been meaning to try on my last three or four visits to Belgium, glad I made the effort to finally buy one."
"12.7oz bottle $6.99"

""
"The beer is a rusty brown hue. Initially, there is a small head but this quickly fades to nil, giving a still appearance. The aroma brings sweet and sour cherry, musty basement, vinegar. Tart fruit, cranberry, raisins. Perhaps more sweet than sour. Apple juice and maraschino cherries. Low carbonation with a sugary finish. This was just ok."
""

"Bottom Line: I won't be buying again, but you might like it if you enjoy krieks, frambois, any sort of fruited lambic or oud bruin. I'm not entirely sure what I paid, but I'm sure it'd covered the cost of a 750ml of Rodenbach Grand Cru or a 4pk of Festina Peche. Rather have either of those."
""

"A very refreshing and balanced but lacks depth."

"- Overall a decent oud bruin, nothing offensive and nothing too special. Lacking complexity and I was hoping for more of a sour punch, as the nose was hinting it could have. At the price of $7/375mL, I would choose Rodenbach Grand Cru instead, everytime."
""
""
""
"Overall: Is Bacchus a watered down version of what a true flanders oud bruin should be? Possibly, but it works here, especially for a beer at 4.5% ABV."
"In comparison, the Grand Cru seems sweeter and fruitier and brighter in terms of flavor -- it just seems to have more going on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Definitely not the best sour, but the taste is quite nice. Appearance and smell are both disappointing."
"Poured into a pint glass."

"This dark brown beer has a poorly retained neck (the style expects more retention). The aroma brings cherries, peppery tones, and molasses - and wood-like tones. The malt, both in aroma and taste, should be more pronounced, here expressed as toffee. The aroma expressed well the acidity, and, despite the aging of 2.5 years, no vinegar notes. The cheeriness is expressed both in aroma and taste, and is very pleasant. The body is medium, super carbonated, oily, and smooth. The end is acid, pleasant, but brief."

"I really liked this beer. It is a little on the pricey side but makes for a nice sour."

"I like certain aspects of this beer a lot, but feels a bit thin where it counts, smell & taste. Still, its not to bad."
""
""
""

""

"Overall: this is one tasty and refreshing beer. Granted, I like the style in general; still, I would gladly have this again and gladly recommend it."

"Overall another good Flanders. Slightly more focused on the cherry as opposed to other malts or funkiness. Good for those who have had a lot of Lambics and are looking to expand."

"D - Not my favorite, but glad to try."
""
"Sour predominant aroma. Also, as expected a sour taste and vinegar, fruity, specially citric lemon. Great beer to drink as a bridge to the most lambic sour beers. Great drinkability, good surprise."
""
""
""
"O - disappointing, because it lacks flavours and body"
""
"Dark reddish brown with a thin tan head with tiny Don Ho-like bubbles. Smells like oak, cherries, and leather. Sounds like an ad for 70's aftershave, somehow. The taste is very mild, with prominent sour cherries and some of that leather. Did I mention that its mild? I think my 70's aftershave model has mellowed in his old age. The mouthfeel is very slightly carbonated, not much to write about. Overall its lighter than I expected. Its not nearly as intense as some in the style, maybe this is the beginner version."
""

"Only big downside, $6.00-plus for a 12.7oz bottle...I'd give this an 84-85, B."
""
""
""
""
""
"M- Light bodied, lively carbonation."
""
""
"O- This has some nice classic Flanders character but it is a bit one-dimensional with not much depth. It is smooth and soft and grows a bit as it opens but never gets much character."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is strong, yeasty and fruity. Pours a dark, slightly hazy brown with a thick, fine-bubbled, persistent light tan head. Rich and fruit flavor is more like a cider than a beer, with a firm apply tone and hints of malt and yeast. Hmmm - donât believe Iâve ever had a Flanders Oude Bruin before! Smooth texture has good fizz, firm body, and an interesting nip to it. A refreshing and distinctive beer."
"Overall- This is one of the best beers I have ever had. Period. Amazingly complex, a million flavors, but I could suck it back without a thought if I wanted to."
"A very balanced and humble version of the style. Hits all necessary points but doesn't excel at anything in particular."
""
""
"This is the first self-proclaimed ""sour ale"" I've had. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but can't give it higher scores without knowing the style better."
""
""
""
"pours brownish mahogany in color, with a very small just off white head. smells like a sour beer, with some notes of cherries and toffee in the shadows. flavor is brett like sour at first, but in a slightly sweet tempered way, relaxed compared to others. notes of sugary dried fruit come into play as well. feel is a bit sticky in the mouth, not as crisp as i like these beers to be, i feel it detracts from the overall experience, turning into a rather funky aftertaste in time. still, good carbonation and medium body, i would have another. i need to experiment more in this style."
""

"Pours a dark burgundy amber brown color with a fine khaki tan head, highly carbonated fine bubbles. Minimal lacing speckled in even patterns forms with each sip. Aroma a hint of dark roasted malt character with underlying sliced apple fruit notes, with a lingering acidity noted in each sip. Flavor is outstanding absolutely nice and refreshing oud bruin, not up to the level of Goudenband but damn tasty. Roasted malts come across initially followed by a light acidity and tart apple and pear combob, minimal yogurt zing to it. Not as wild or barnyard as some of the Belgian wild ales I've come across. Mouthfeel finishes dry nicely acidic clean fruitiness enough sweetness to balance it out, carbonation is bubbly cleanses the palate with each sip. Overall a rock solid oud bruin that stands up with some of the best versions out there."
""
"D - This is a solid Flanders Oud Bruin. I sometimes find this style to have too much vinegar. but this one has a nice combination of fruits, vinegar, and funk. I would recommend trying this if you get a chance!"
""
"Review from 1/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours deep brownish red amber. Virtually no head and no lacing. Sour fruit aroma. Sour cherry, slight vanilla and a touch of wood. Subdued flavors. A bit thin and lightly flavored. Clearly well made, but flavors are not appealing to me. Interesting to try, but probably not again."
""
"This is a very light Oud Bruin. To my tastes its a little subdued, but I can see how this is a great introduction to the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Good sour. I am glad to have had it. A bit pricier than some, but better tasting than some. I liked the heavier mouthfeel it has."
"Overall: cutting flavour; would be great as a dessert beer and the tartness is just right"
""
"Consumed from a Dogfish Head snifter, this is better paired with fatty, strong flavored foods. However, the green bottle may have done an injustice and I will have to try it another time."
"O: I enjoyed this beer and would gladly have it again. Pretty easy to drink and I could definitely enjoy a few of these in an evening. The only bad thing I would say about this beer is that the smell and taste were not as intense as others in the style so it did not live up to my expectations."
"Pours a deep amber to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sour and faint white grape. In the taste, sour white grapes and pears, with a nice dry end. A sour bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry sour white grape in the aftertaste. A nice sour, with a touch of fruit and a nice dry end."
""
""
"O: worthy of a buy, even at the price...if you like oud bruin, buy this beer."
""
"I'm so glad to have finally tried this. My first bottle happens to be a vintage one. From what I understand, this is a classic to the style. I pay my respects. Would pick up again. Love the 'Burgundies of Belgium'!"
""
"Pours a brownish red, clear and little head retention. Aromas of red wine vinegar, sugary malts and a belgian yeast fruityness. In the taste, a nice lactic sour, candi sugar sweetness, and a touch of wood tone tannins. Nice tartness and light to medium bodied feel. Overall, a solid Oud Bruin with a good deal of funk. I can dig it."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Very easy for the style... I've had this on-tap before but this time didn't go over so well with the palate. Sweet and citrus tasting but not much body or anything else. Would like to try many other brews in this style but am going to look out for bigger and better ones."
"Dark red nearing brown hue. Small wisp of head. Nose is mostly tart cherry and vinegar. A bit of bready malt as well. Flavors are lightly sour cherry, vinegar and toffee. Medium body with very mild carbonation. Not a big sour blast but it gets the job done. I like this much more than Monks or Duchess in the bottle."
"Overall - Just slightly better than average oud bruin. Not something I'd drink again, but not something I'm having difficulty drinking right now."
""
"Not as complex as some other examples of the style, but no real flaws or turn-offs. Pretty tasty brew, I really enjoyed this."

"Solid solid beer...def different and really for the beer geek IMO. You would be hard pressed trying this out on a macro friend(and it might be a waste)"
"M - Medium body, moderate carbonation."
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a massively dark red brown with a two finger light tan head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart cherry, cream, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour cherry, cream, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I am a decent fan of this style and this one really didn't disappoint me too much. I like the fact that I was able to pick up on the cream aspect I mentioned in the flavor as it helped to balance out the tart flavors going on. This made the brew much more enjoyable for me. Worth trying if you get the opportunity on tap."
"Pours light mahogany in color.Beige crown with large bubbles.Good retention.Flowers,green wood & mildy toasted malt aromas.Citric sourness upfront followed by sweet malt flavor.Light body & gentle high carbonation.Grapefruit finish.Lemony malty aftertaste.Refreshing & drinkable."
"O- I will buy this one again."
"Pours a dark maroon, with some mahogany highlights. Light offwhite head, moderate density but soon fades to some bubbles and a thing head. Almost zero retention. Nose has some light sourness, grapes and berries, light metallic and woody notes. Some acetic qualities. Taste is drying right off the bat, some lightly acetic berries with some wood. Becomes a bit grape-ier near the end. Bittersweet finish with a pucker. Pretty high carbonation, but avoids being fizzy. Dry enough to encourage constant sipping. A nice little sour that could be a lot nicer with a bit more depth and complexity."
"Bacchus is just the thing to serve those people who think of beer as nothing but bland, yellow soda-water. It showcases that the complexities in flavour, smell and texture achieved from malted grain can rival (even somewhat mimic) every bit those of fermented grapes. It should also greatly appeal to those like whiskey sours and similar cocktails."
"Overall a real interesting and rewarding brew"
"a great sour beer."
"Overall â This would be a good stater beer for someone new to the style. The flavours are there, but they aren't too over the top and in your face. It's actually pretty drinkable, I could have a few. I also really like the bottle and the packaging. Worth buying."
"Very pleasant introduction to the style, really reminds me of a lambic or gueze minus the strong fruit tastes/smells. Will seek this beer/style out again for sure."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown colour with thick off-white head. Not too much lacing on the glass, but nice head retention. Smells of vinegar and cherries. Somewhat tart/sour type flavour, some more sweetness in the aftertaste. Not as intense flavour as many other beers of this style, but it is still nice. A bit thin for the mouthfeel. I'll probably pick up a few of these since we don't have many of this style coming into Ontario."
"Overall a nice beer but not as good as the best mentioned above."
"O: Good but not necessarily great. More of a dynamic taste would probably put this into the next level, however, still a decent flanders red ale."
"Light vinegar and oak in the nose, some caramel and bread from the malt. Light. Flavor follows suit, more sweetness than is accustomed to in the style, sweet and a little too fizzy. Light red wine vinegar, cherry, caramel, earth, lemon like tartness lightly in the finish, sweetness comes across as a little artificial. A training wheel sour that doesn't really resemble the complexities of the real deal, simple and easy to drink. Not a bad beer and I would drink it again, just don't expect a proper Flanders ale."
"It's good, but not nearly sour enough."
"Brown with ruby highlights, one finger of off white head, no lace to speak of. Smell is yeasty, funky wild notes, some cherry and other berry aromas present, lightly oaky at points. Taste is tart and yeasty, lots of fruit, cherry and red grape, vinous, some dark fruit, in finish with some malt, nice sourness. High prickly carbonation, light to medium body, nice feel. Solid stuff, very drinkable, on the more approachable part of the spectrum for the style."
"A good introductory Flemish red, but not nearly as bold and puckery as I would have liked."
"This is not a style that I have a tonne of experience with, but this beer didn't impress me that much. Happy to finish it, but it certainly was not particularly exciting."
"This one won't win accolades from the soreheads among the beer geek crowd, but it'll hit a sweet note with a wider public."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Closer to brown than red with a tight and creamy light tan head. Aroma's a delicate and complex mix of acetic sourness with some mustiness and cherry fruit... some oak comes out as it warms. Taste is light vinegar/sourness up front with definite cherry and tannic undertones. All of the flavours quickly vanish, leaving a finish that is very crisp, with little aftertaste aside from something that hints at red wine. Light body that is accentuated with solid, tingly carbonation. A nice Flanders red with a great flavour profile, just comes off a bit too watered down."
"Pours a deep nut brown color, almost auburn, with foamy, tan head. Active carbonation and good head retention. All yeast in the aroma. Lots of spicy funk up front balanced with fruity esters. Flavor is fruity and malty; very tart at first. As the palate adjusts, the beer gets pretty sweet and quite fruity with raspberry and cherry flavors coming out. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy from the sweetness at first but the carbonation helps to lighten it up and thin it out a bit."
"Bottle at Sin and Redemption. More or less balanced flemish red, actually good for the style, and a gateway sour. Dark grape juice colour with thin white head. Very pleasant smell, cherry. Cherry taste, also grape juice from the sugars. Above average mouthfeel. somewhat palate eraser, not bad for me.Good drinkability."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink but the sourness and flavors seem to be somewhat muted compared to other beers in the style."
"This falls a bit short for me. I don't really care for the cola flavor, and the tartness seems like an afterthought. The most appealing part is the aroma, though it is one dimensional."
"Overall: Very nice and balanced. Much better than the fresh one, although still a bit too sweet for the style"
"12.7 ounce bottle, label says bottled on 090414. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a murky brown color with a half inch cola-like tan head. Head retention is very good, and there's a small amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is tart cherries, green grapes and some vinegar. It tastes like tart cherries, oak, plums and a bit of brown sugar. Nice balance between the sweet and tart flavors, but I think it's more sweet than tart. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with good carbonation. I think it's a decent brew."
"O: This is one of those beers that has some OK qualities, but is too uneven to wholly recommend."
"D - Worst mouthfeel (aside from curdy, perhaps) I can imagine."
"Just tried this brew. I have to say I like it better than Lindemans. A good Flemish sour but not the greatest. A bit tangy, oak aged, fruity and floral aromas make for a delightful experience but I am just not ready for it yet. I do believe this is an up and comer in the Flemish sours worth a double take and try."
"Not bad but lacks the depth and complexity I expect from a Flanders red."
"Pours a moderate reddish-brown with a thin off-white head. Some spotted lacing on the way down. The nose carries some light malt and a bit of sweetness and a very faint presence of cherries and light sourness. The flavor has mostly light malt with a touch of sweetness. Very, very light cherry and acidity. Not much of a Flanders. Medium body and slightly creamy. Decent enough, but not a good example of the style."
"This brew pours out as a bubbly reddish brown color with a fizzy light brown head. The head vanishes very quickly and doesn't leave any lacing. The smell of the beer has a fermented cherry aroma with some oaky aromas too. The taste is slightly tart with some soft cherry flavors in the aftertaste. There is a bitter vinegar flavor in there too. The mouthfeel has a generous amount of carbonation. Overall it's a decent Flanders Red. Not overly thrilled with some of the flavors."
"(D)- Too straightforward and mild. Not a whole lot going on here to mention much at all."
"O/D - Not too bad but the finish was a little disapointing. Definately a starter for the style."
"otherwise -- note to self: avoid Flanders Red Ale"
"D: This was not nearly as sour or tart as expected, with nice sweet balance. Decent body and low alcohol made it easy to drink. I would consider this a gateway beer into the sour ales, but it's a bit bland if you're already used to lambics or more tart beers."
"Below average flanders red for me. Should have been less sweet, the sweetness should have been tastier and a tad more sour wouldn't hurt."
"There was a lot of things i liked about this particular beer, but none of them took over and made the beer amazing. I feel its kind of stuck in the middle area between not bad, but not great, just ok. Nice sour notes on the palate, but not much nose to it. Its a well rounded beer, but nothing that makes me seek this out again, just another beer on the craft beer journey."
"The taste isn't bad, but it's not much. I'd go for lots of other Flanders beers over this, and they don't cost any more."
"O- This is a good beer, it just seems as though it has been watered down in a lot of ways. Definitely check it out if you're new to the style, but there are better out there."
"Opinion: This really is a pretty good beer. I prefer my Flanders to be MUCH more bold, like Rodanbach, but this is still a good representation of the style and as they Hop City guy stated, it would be good for someone new to Flanders. It is actually easier to try than the Duchesse. All this said, I will stick to other examples, but I am glad that I tried this one and would definitely recommend it if you 9or your girlfriend) wanted to try something different and you aren't familiar with the Flanders styles. This would be a very good introduction to the style."
"D- its a sour flanders but pretty easy to drink a 12.7 oz was enough for me..i will drink this one again but wont be seeking it out"
"Brown with a ruby tinge, the beer is clear enough to see the carbonation that sustains the foamy ring around the top, but you can't see through it. The smell is sour, of course, and sweet with stone fruit and grape The fruits and sourness carry over into the taste, but the sweetness is knocked back a bit and it's surprisingly drier than the nose led me to believe. There is a tingle from the carbonation and the sour notes play on the tongue adding to the tingling sensation. Light to medium-bodied this is a beer for you sour beer lovers out there, but if you're looking for major pucker this one won't supply it. It's a little fruity, not overly sweet and moderately sour."
"This beer pours a dark amber almost brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of sour cherries, raspberries, and a hint of caramel. The is full of sour cherries, with a nice tartness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer. I think this would pair beautifully with brunch. I will certainly drink it again."
"375ml bottle thanks to brewerdan, appreciate it! Dark red-brown like you would expect with minimal head. Smells a little bit like vinegar but not enough for my liking. Taste is mildly sour, mellow, almost too mellow. I honestly have a hard time finding Flanders reds that I like. Duchesse and Zoetzuur are probably the only ones I really, really like."
"Pours a dark iced tea color with a 1 inch tan head that fades to a miniscule layer of foam. Lacing is minimal and patchy on the glass. Smell is of mild vinegar, sour cherries, and some woody notes. Taste is mildly sour cherry with a vinegar zing that is somewhat subdued. No bitterness to speak of. Beer has a very lively carbonation that is refreshing but it leaves a sticky coating in the mouth like soda will do. Drinkability is good but I have had better examples of this style, so I probably wouldn't get this beer again."
"D: Surprising that I've never really even heard this beer mentioned. It's a pretty decent Flanders Red and a good price."
"The beer looks good and has the nose characteristic of the style with maybe a touch too much vinegar. That by the way is the story with this beer. There are too many wild yeast flavors, some moldy cheese notes, with too much vinegar that really detracts from the characteristic sours and sweets of the style. The beer is decent but why settle for second best. There isn't enough tart cherry, not enough complexity, not enough wood barrel notes, and just too much of the wild yeasty vinegars. It's okay, but I'll stick with Rodenbach and Duchesse any day."
"Bottle. Poured into a Duvel tulip a clear deep copper reddish orange color with a light tan 1 finger head. Lots of flavors in the nose; apple, cinnamon, and banana all with an underlying sour grape aroma. Light mouthfeel with a decent amount of carbonation. Starts with a dark fruit like sweetness with a tinge of sourness like lemon that slowly fades and ends rather cleanly. I don't pick up too much oak in this except maybe at the end but ever so slightly. Complex? No, not really but its pretty easy drinking and has a mild sourness that I find nice."
"D - This is a very nice Flanders Red Ale but there are better out there."
"This Vlaams Oud Bruin comes in a 375 mL green champagne bottle with a crown cap and foil seal; bottled 090414, which could actually be the best-by date. Pours with filtered clarity the color of cherrywood, highly-carbonated, with a moussy head that climbs out of the glass and has great retention. The aroma is light, but it's enough to kick in the saliva glands. Nice sweet/sour balance, with stonefruits, toasted/caramel malts, and a light, but surprising green hop flavor on top of a light and dry, almost tannic body, with a nice carbonic tingle. Very easy to drink, and would make a painless introduction for those leery of sour reds, but I don't feel it is to style - it almost tastes like a red ale that has had lactic acid added to it or has been mildly soured and then pasteurized. Either way, it's not too shabby, but perhaps not worth going out of your way to find it."
"My bottle says it's an Oude Brune but seems to be the same beer though. Nothing overly special about this one but certainly a nice drink."
"Love it."
"D- This is a classy classic example of this style. Its not a vinegar mess like the most well known example of this style-and its not anywhere near as tart or extreme as the American examples. Its simply flanders red-with a lot of oak barrel flavor and some vanilla, some charry, and some tarness. My only complaint about this is that the body is slightly thin. If the flavor were a bit fuller this would be world class."
"This is a good, but not great, Flanders Red. Not as tasty as Rodenbach Red or Duchesse, but still decent."
"Overall this Flanders ale is a bit more mild and straight forward than others I have had, but it is refreshing and tasty as well. Very drinkable! I would have this again."
"My bottle got froze. So. Pours with I think is a damaged by freezing weird looking head, but still not bad: foamy, frothy, fluffy, sudsy and clumpy, that lasts forever and lots of lace. Color is a cloudy medium brown. Aroma is a bit fruity, tart, malt, and actually fresh. Flavor is malty, tart, fruity. Body still has some ice in it, so there you go. Finish is like flavor and not bad. Kind of tasty actually."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a solid pale and crystal malt scent along with a mild sourness. It doesn't appear to be too complex, but it's refreshing nonetheless. The taste is decent as well. It has a very thin crystal malt flavor along with a crisp, refreshing sourness. It's incredibly simplistic with little malt complexity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a forgettable Flanders ale. I'm not a fan of the malt profile. It's too light and devoid of complexity."
"This beer is really juicy and sweet. It has apples and a bit of raspberry and mango. Its hard to nail down exactly all of the esters in here, it's really got a nice bouqet. The woodiness in here is a bit chalky and musty upfront. It almost tastes as if the wood was practically rotting. But as far as I know most barrels used in this kind of procedure are up to 100 years old. The sore thumb that this shows actually winds up blending in quite nicely a ways into the bottle. It turns out to be quite a nice example of this style. The bottle was over a year a half old. I might try a fresh pressed one to see what kind of differences were made if any."
"Nice balance of sweet and sour with a cherry-like fruitiness. Sourness is pretty mild and keeps the vinegar aspect low. A bit like the Duchesse, but not nearly as sweet. Carbonation is soft and fine and has a nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is uber-high as the sourness is not too acidic, ABV is moderate and malts are soft and tame. Very good, I will surely buy this again next time I see it."
"Pours very dark amber, almost chestnut brown. White head is creamy smooth and leaves a nice rim layer. Aroma is fairly full with some ripe fruits. On the palate is a pleasant sweet/sour that is awfully similar to what I get with Duchesse du Bourgogne. Passion fruit, light vinegar (good way), and amazing carbonation to help give it a stellar mouthfeel. Finishes smooth on the palate with the above flavors mingling nicely."
"I enjoyed this beer, not as sour as expected, but very drinkable for me. Will pick up a few more bottles of this..."
"Definitely an interesting brew... not what I was expecting at all, but I'm happy to have tried it."
"Poured a faded red body w/ a minimal pinkish head that died quick but left some lace patches. Mostly a faint cherry and tart fruit aroma, but also a minimal amount of oakiness and sweet malt. Taste is same as this is a simple but enjoyable red ale as the tart cherry taste is minor and the thin body passes smooth and clean over tongue. Has a touch of sweetness in there as well for balance and the carbonation leads to a crisp but not cutting backbite. Simple and not best representation of style but enjoyable w/ a meal."
"Drinkability: A rather unchallenging Flanders Red though pleasant enough to drink"
"DB- Very interesting. Best described as Monks Cafe light. Very subdued and well balanced flavor. I love interesting beer."
"Drinkability: This isn't a bad beer but the best thing I can say about it is that the color, when held to a light, is very pretty. It just doesn't compete well with any number of other Flanders Red beers. Many will find it OK and comfortable if they have no expectations for it being a good beer for the style."
"D - This is a wonderful sour beer thats easy to drink this is a beer that I could drink all night long this is a beer that when you see it you should pick it up"
"D - Tart/sour with high carbonation combined with the low ABV makes this a really pleasantly drinkable flanders. Like others have said, this would be a great entryway beer to the world of sours."
"Clapton's ""The Shape You're In"" just makes me wanna drink something. If only 'twere about beer... This guy pours a dark ruby-tinted brown topped by finger or so of dark-ish ecru foam. The nose comprises red grapes, watered-down vinegar, a light must, black cherries, and a hint of raspberries. The taste tones the vinegar down to a nice degree, adding only a subtle twang of acidity. The fruits and berries remain, with the must being toned down a notch as well, with some figs, nutmeg, and mandarin oranges thrown in for good measure. The body is a stalwart medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly sticky finish. Overall, a nice Flanders Brown, not the most characteristic of the style, but tasty and enjoyable nonetheless."
"D - Well, it was decent, but probably nothing worth seeking out. I enjoyed the glass I had and ordered something else."
"I tried it anyway and I'm glad I did. She was dead on. Not as sour, but still good and refreshing. It was nice given that I was sitting outside in 90 degree heat."
"D) Worthwhile, smooth darker/amber ale"
"Pours a coppery red with a half inch of khaki head that recedes quickly. Very little tartness in the nose. Mild sweetness,a grainy something or other. Honestly, there is so little going on in the nose it's almost not worth mentioning. Thin, soft mouthfeel. Not nearly enough sharpness or acidity for the style. A delicately tart cherry sweetness with a grainy finish that fades almost instantly. This beer was a tease. It did not satisfy my craving for a Flemish sour."
"This beer is definitely growing on me as I'm drinking the glass. Not the best representation of this style, but it is a good and tasty beer. Perhaps a good introduction to this style for some."
"D= Though this is not what I expected from the brewer's description, it was a damned easy drinking ale that I would have again with pleasure. Could be a great gateway beer to introduce someone to sours."
"D - Although it is smooth, I feel I have to deduct based on style. What makes a Flander's Red so drinkable for me is that more acidic, sour taste which this does not deliver. It doesn't capture my palate's attention for that long"
"Medium mouthfeel and a strong carbonation. Very impressive for a beer of 4.5% abv. One would think this is a much stronger beer and is amazing at that low of an abv"
"Drinkability: I like this style and would choose this beer over several styles. That being said, this one is very light, and the sourness that I usually get is quite subdued. If I was looking for a beer, I would pick this up. If I was looking for a Flanders Red, I would see if there was something else on the shelf."
"A good Flander's but lacks the intensity of flavors found in Duchesse du Burgogne or Rodenbach."
"Drinkability is okay, in that it's bland and light (my palate adjusted to the iron and I was able to easily forget about it about a 1/3rd of the way through. However, it doesn't have the tartness or complexity that I look for in the style, and therefore was not worth the $7 it cost me to ever revisit. I can get a 750 of Rodenbach Grand Cru for only a little bit more!"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is oak, tannins and red wine. The flavor is similar to red wine with some oak notes and caramel malt. Mild tartness and very dry. The beer has a somewhat watery mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"This might be the best of this style that I have had, a solid beer."
"Decent, unexceptional example of the style - it might make a good introduction to sours, but there are more interesting variants out there..."
"pours a vinegar brown with no head. This beer smells pleasantly of vinegar/ketchup. There have been a few other's in this style, namely the Duchess, that have a similar smell, but this has more a vinegar aroma. Medium carbination, the sweet flavors kick through the bubbles the most. If this beer was ketchup it would be the best ketchup ever. I'm not well versed on Flanders Red Ales, but i'm a huge fan nonetheless. This combines a hint of sour with a nice sweet flavor found in bruins. The bottle tells you nothing of the beer's style and I was pleasantly surprised to pour this beer to find out its style. To be honest, there's nothing super special about his beer other than it's very tasty. It's less intense than the Duchess which is good for people interested in the style. CHECK THIS SHIT OUT!"
"A decent sour, though a bit mild. This one is mostly acidic, but the beer is rather light in flavor and feel, at least relatively fresh, so it's still fairly easy to drink. Bacchus pours a deep red with a shade or two of brown, small ecru head. Aroma is too mild but there are some nice sweet and sour cherry notes and hints of grain. Flavor is a bit better with more acidity, a light funk and mild malt. Feel is a bit thin, which isn't really a big surprise, but it's still a fairly easy beer to drink."
"D: Easy to drink. Not the best, but solid as a whole."
"12.7 ounce green bottle, black foil over the cap, no bargain at $5.99 @ DeCicco market in Ardsley, NY. Bottled on 4-14-09. Dark brown with a burnt red hue. Thick light mocha head, that stays and stays, then goes to a thick film, collar, and respectable if not amazing strands of lace. I get a healthy load of must and tart fruit in the nose. Ah Flanders Red, what a wonderful style and this one was not bad, moderatly tart, no real sour bite, some tart cherry notes. A bit more musty character midway and in the finish. Not bad, I think some stinky cheese and crusty bread would compliment this selection well. Worth a try. Good gateway sour/Belgian red."
"There is quite a nice mix of flavors to this beer, but it really has just been watered down too much. A more concentrated version would likely be phenomenal & for this reason I find this beer quite disappointing."
"I think this is a great little beer. I would recommend this to any one getting into sours."
"Overall, quite a disappointment. There are far better examples of the style for a similar price, notably ""Duchesse"" and Rodenbach. Extraordinarily boring in most every way."
"Overall: A not bad, refreshing oud bruin. I found it in a Michael Jackson's beers of the world book. Would be a good intro to the style."
"Overall, I thought this was a pretty good beer. My first introduction to sours and I can say that I'd like to try a few more. Would probably even pick this up again if it were a little cheaper around here."
"Worth a try, though. Maybe it's someone else's thing."
"D- Despite its downfalls, this beer is very drinkable... sessionable even. I might even go so far as to call it a thirst quencher."
"I could drink these all day any season of the year!"
"Notes: This is a classic Belgian brewery's Flemish Red Ale which was solid. It was great to find it on tap at HopCat, a world class Beer Advocate place."
"D: It's not jaw-droppingly complex, but it is incredibly refreshing. I wish I had tried this in the summer. Recommended for fans of sour ales."
"On tap at the Cheeky Monk in Denver. Clear dark red color with a small off-white head. Aroma is both sweet and sour with cherry, apple, oak, and mild funk. Flavor is a tiny bit tart but mostly just sweet, with cherry, apple, sweet malt, and a metallic, acidic finish. The description calls this ""wine-like?"" Not very accurate. Body is medium-light with moderately high carbonation. Drinkability average-plus, but the metallic flavor hurts it here. Not a huge fan overall."
"D = This is a very good drinkable beer, sour, but not so much as to be astringent, with good fruitiness of character."
"D- This would be more drinkable if it had a little more carbonation to it. Overall not the worst beer in this style but far from the best."
"Re-reviewed this, and not nearly as impressed this time."
"It's quite drinkable with the lower abv%, but I'm not sure if I'd want a ton of this."
"Light body, smooth and easy to drink. Overall, an average beer, but I have had better and I expected a lot more from this beer. I would probably give it a shot if I found in a bottle."
"This is a less intense version of a sour red. It has a brownish amber color to it, a sweet berry maltiness, and carmelized malts. Like drinking caramel strawberries. The intensity of the sourness is low on this one, but it's there. A good beer of its style for the beginner, but still solid for the veteran to appreciate."
"Overall this is a drinkable beer but it about ends there."
"Drinkability: I haven't purchased a snow cone in maybe 17 years, but I can't imagine they cost more than $2 today and that's certainly cheaper than a $6 beer, plus, with the snow cone, you get to enjoy the icy flavorful part first."
"On tap at Hamilton's Tavern in San Diego during the RBSG 08 pubcrawl. Dark orange bronze with a tan head. Aroma is acidic with tart cherries and a slight metallic character. Flavor is berries with an acetic sharpness. Fairly tart but a little too sweet. Poor man's Duchesse du Bourgogne. Still not bad."
"This goes down pretty easily. Although the the sweetness dominates the brew it is not sickening or off-putting. I could see this as a nice brew on a hot day."
"D - Tastes artificially sweetened with either juice or sugar. Refreshing, just not as tart or sour as I had expected."
"At 4.5% it's actually pretty drinkable, if not one-dimensional. It paired pretty well with a roast beef sandwich."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with tartness leading to a dry, thin finish."
"Eric"
"D; Not a bad Red by any means, not up to par with Rodenbach, but a good sour ale in its own right, I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability- Perfectly fine Flanders. Wish it was a bit more sour, but it does work nice the way it is."
"On tap at Stone World Bistro & Gardens. I had this back to back with a Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour. Both had about the same fruitiness to them, but this Bacchus had a slightly more sharp sourness whereas the Monk's Cafe was more muted in that respect. I think the Bacchus also had a somewhat lighter body and the Monk's felt a bit more soft."
"I like it OK but not super impressed. I would have it again but I can think of several that I would prefer over this one."
"Review added 12-08-2007, translated from french 1-20-2008."
"Overall the sourness is mild and refreshing, and the beer is decent enough. Many afficionados of the style will want something with more punch (panil bariquee or rodenbach, for example) but this is pleasant enough and a nice thirst-quencher."
"25 cl bottle. 05-2006 on label."
"nice tartness but not overly tasteful. little fruitniness. i'm a sucker for the style, so i liked it, but it's no rodenbach"
"Bottle: Poured a clear red colored beer with a small head that quickly disappeared. Aroma of oak is clearly present thought not has much as in other example such as Rodenbach. Taste is slightly tart with some nice touch of oak and very subtle cheery. Probably of the best effort from this brewery."
"Interestingly, the Russian translation of the label declares this a ""pale"" beer. Not likely. Deep mahogany red that is remarkably clear for an unfiltered beer. The head was very fizzy and so short lived I didn't even get a chance to notice the color. My guess, based on the collar that still sits above the liquid, would be reddish tan. The nose is full of cherry. The mouth is very carbonated and heavy with fruit sweetness. The cherry attacks the tastebuds immediately, hitting with both sweet and sour. Malt lurks somewhere in the background, but never overcomes the fruit. The aftertaste is clearly sour cherry. Not bad, if this is what you like. I don't, particularly."
"Quite a refreshing ale, sweetish start, with a tart sourness towards the finish, as always a cherry-ish flavour and slight caramel maltyness, enjoyable flanders red, even though its not the best."
