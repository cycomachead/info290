"This is a good beer, but the cough medicine flavor kinda lingers. Wish it had a little more sour"
""
""
"Great sour beer! Amazing cherry flavors! Extremely easy to drink, can't wait to enjoy this beer again!"
""
""
"Interesting beer.  Taste more like a Lambic than an Oud Bruin to me."
""
""
""
""
"Flavours include more cherry, marzipan and a very slight acidity. Pretty cloyingly sweet."
"O - well priced sour, easy drinking for a palate used to intense sours. Nice."
""
""
"If you love cherries, you will LOVE this beer. If you are a normal person and think cherries are decently tasty, you will like this beer, but perhaps get tired of it quick. It tastes like cherries, but not much else. A tasty beer, just not super complex, and one that I wouldn't want much more than one glass of."

"O: Not as impressed as with the aged Pale ale, this is still a good beer with lots of cherry, would like to get some more sour tart flavors and maybe some oak, but if you're looking for a cherry bomb, this is your beer. At 8.5% ABV the alcohol is well hidden."
"I'm partial to Flanders red"
""
""
"I love this here beer"
""
"Way too much cherry. Not nearly enough sour. Tastes like cherry cough syrup"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little too much cherry for me."
""
"If you like the taste of cherries you should enjoy this ale."
""
""
""
"Not too sour, overly sweet.  Not quite what I was expecting."
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is good. Thick and leaves a bit of bitterness at the back of the tongue."
"I was expecting a sour but still pretty impressed"
""
""
"O - I would not purchase a bottle"

"This is one of my favorite beers.  Very strong sour flavor will give you a taste bud orgasm.  A bit on the pricey side, but it's worth it for a occasional celebration."
"Beautiful deep red pour. Very cherry. Amazing beer!! Do want!"

"Cherries at the forefront, a cross between a kriek and a sour. Pours out a deep ruby brown with minimal tightly beaded head. Aroma of cough medicine, taste a bit smoother with some elements of chocolate. Cherry tootsie pop, as mentioned by an earlier rater. Pure sour finish."
""
""
""
"Nice cherry flavor and aroma which is not overpowering. Mostly sweet character with a mild tartness. Robitussin-like flavor in the finish is slightly off set. Harsh carbonation when first opened. I recorked the bottle and drank the rest the next day and the carbonation was perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste:  Raspberry cranberry mix perfectly with the mildly syrupy texture and sweetness.  Cherry in the middle which opens to nice carbonation and a faint lingering mouthfeel."
"Very nice sour with light cherry on the back.  Draft in glass goblet."
""
""
""
""
""
"The cherries were a bit over powering for me."
""
""
"Great tasting sour!"

"A dark chocolate praline filled with cherry liquor. Bing cherries and caramel. A touch of bitterness in the finish, perhaps from alcohol. Lightly sweet, medium acidity for a sour. Candy like yet not too artificial. Not as authentic as Rodenbach, but has some soul to it and succeeds as a balanced fruity treat."

"Pour from a 330 into a tulip. I have nothing to add to other reviews regarding appearance of color, head, retention. I will say that the cherry, sour, and any malty sweetness are more subtle compared to other red flemmish. The sweet seems to have more of a fruit genesis than malt.  I prefer a sharper, more sour beer from this category."
""
"Overall: Not really what I was expecting, but still very solid.  I think I changed my mind on this beer with every waft and sip.  Certainly only an every once in a while beer, but something that keeps the palate on its toes."
""
""
"The chaliced beer arrived a dark mahogany color with a thin layer of bubbles exuding fumes of soured fruits. Difficult to identify any particulars. Strong sour notes on the palate, however it was void of complexity and balance. Drinkable, OK I suppose, but could use a little TLC."
"Interesting but not really complex enough as a Belgian red."
"O- very enjoyable cherry ale would definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- very refreshing brew that hides the alcohol brilliantly, big cherry notes take center stage"
"Don't drink it without some assertive tastes to oppose it."

"O: Certainly not the best example of this style, it should be known that it is full of cherry in the smell and taste. Goudenband, La Folie, and Monk’s Café’s versions for example are neither cherry nor sweet forward as this is. Still its nice to try the style, and it makes me realize the boundaries of the style extends further than I’d realized. Bought at Bruisin Ales in Asheville."

"Looks nice, poured a clear but deep ruby red with big, dense pink-tinged head, lots of lace on the glass. Smell: tons of cherry, mildly tart, brown sugar sweetness. Taste: cherry, peaches in brown sugar, mild herbal and oak notes. Seems like a Kriek to me, not much else going on."
""
""
"My wife really likes this beer, and would have rated it a 4.5. She liked it so much that we want the the liquor store and bought both the beer and the ""glass"" ware that went with this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Dark malt start (without any toasted or chocolate note) and an overpowering fruit punch flavor--a bit artificial. Leans to the rich side with light carbonation. In a word. Sweet. Probably good with cheese."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I find it hard to fault this beer, but if one might I'd imagine that they's say it needs more complexity, or more 'real' fruitiness. I, however, would beg to differ. It's rich and just complex enough. I find it malty, fruity, and well-rounded with 'spiky' accents of character just as an Oud Bruin should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Based on the overpowering aroma and flavor from the cherries, I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did. The parts come together very well. Worth trying, for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I got no idea why this isn't more revered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very sweet beer, almost like a hard cherry root beer. It has a nice deep ruby red color, a nice carbonation that creates small bubbles and leaves some foam. It will do as a great dessert beer due to the sweetness. I was not able to finish the bottle myself. If I had thought of it as a soda, I may have finished it, but under the stigma of a sweet beer, I had a hard time emptying the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While the nose hinted at an overly sweet fruit-forward beer, the flavor proved to be quite interesting. A good cherry Flemish ale that's enjoyable, if not earth-shattering."
""
""
""
"This is a great beer. I can see why it's so expensive because it requires a ton of fruit to make. Goes down way to easy. Liquid candy. I could easily throw 3 of these back no problem. Highly recommended."

"Overall a surprisingly different take on a Flanders oud bruin. Not my favorite, but I enjoyed trying it."

"Taste- Starts with cherries and moves slightly floral then finishes with a complex cherry vanilla note. An excellent sour. Would make a good ""transitional"" brew for people that don't love sours yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Favorite of the Petrus bunch. Would like a bit more tart, but more substantive than some of the soda-like sours I've had. Will order whenever I see it."

"O- This beer was okay but the fruit quality is too sweet and too artificial for me to want it again."
"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, 41347 bottle code. Pours fairly crystal clear dark ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart cherry, black cherry, cherry skin, brown sugar, oak, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with big authentic cherry presence; and good strength. Taste of big tart cherry, black cherry, cherry skin, oak, clove, pepper, brown sugar, toast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart/black cherry, cherry skin, oak, pepper, clove, brown sugar, toast, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of cherry flavors with moderate malt/oak/yeast flavor balance; with a good tartness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and moderately syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian fruit beer. Plenty of great authentic cherry flavor with moderate malt/oak/yeast balance; and extremely smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"A miss here. Not enough balance, and the complexities clash. Fruit overkill. Drinkable, but hard to return to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - not great. The aroma and taste are just unbearable. The medicinal taste and aroma really ruin the beautiful looking beer."
"Maybe it was the way my bartender poured the beer, but it was presented to me with no head, no lacing. The color was a hazy amber brown with ruby red shining through in the light. The nose did not have much to it: a faint vinous quality and the smell of cherry Kool-Aid, but I could smell the alcohol, so it was all too reminiscent of a Four Loko. It tasted like a red wine with Kool-Aid overtones along with a faint wood characteristic. The finish brought a moderate sour yeast taste. Mouthfeel was watery with medium carbonation. I didn't enjoy this one very much and I definitely won't seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a beer I'm not likely to order again, and while one might be tempted to recommend it as an entry-level sour beer, I don't think you get enough tartness to really acclimate a new drinker to the sour flavor profiles. I would certainly recommend it for someone who was trying to transition from mixed drinks to beer, but I think there are much better takes on the Flanders Oud Bruin style. It's times like this that I love being able to try a beer on tap instead of shelling out the full bottle price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M- It coats the tongue and leaves a slippery, sweet residue. Not pleasant at all."
""
"This creature is one-dimensional, and very short on the qualities that balance out a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was wildly surprised by this beer, pleased with the complexity of the layering in flavors and will definitely enjoy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, I like this a lot. drink these all night!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Anyways if you like sweet, not sour fruit beers this is the one for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the face of the potential for making a cough syrup beer, the brewers in this case have pulled off a successful blending of a fruit beer and an oud bruin. The cherry flavor could probably stand to be a little more restrained, but I'm not complaining."
""
""
"O: I like it, even if it's not a Flanders Red and/or Oude outright. Really reminds me of what Adult Cherry Coke would be. I wouldn't recommend it as a first venture into new styles, but a nice segue into these styles from an intermediate saison drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best served cold; it actually gets worse as it warms."
""
"Its the dark maltiness and earthen qualities that makes the beer an similar to Oude Bruin. But its sour cherry character speaks Flanders Red Ale. The culmination causes it to become either a well balanced Red or a more sour Brown."
""
"O: man this was great, sweet, tart, not too pricey. i really liked it. try it."
"Do yourself a favor and get a Lindemens Goudenband (spelling?) instead of this mediciney beer."
""
""
"Overall interesting, cherry is good but way too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad brew, per se, but really not what most people will be looking for. You probably expect a highly oaky, dry, and tart beer with sour cherries and tons of vinous grape. Not exactly the case here. This is more of a sweet, cherry fruit beer. In that regard, it can be enjoyed more thoroughly. Looking at it that way, I much prefer this to, say, Founder's Cerise. As far as Oud Bruins go, though, it's not as hot. Still a decent thing to try for the cherry lovers out there."

"overall a good flemish red. can't complain here."
""
""
""
""
"The body is very much on the light edge of medium but reaching. Carbonation is light and crispness adds bite. It does go a touch flat, though, at which point it relies too heavily on carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"deep red, hint of pink. maintains a ring of foam, a smidge of lacing along the top. smell reminds me of my mom's cherry pie, not really mediciny as i'd read - only reason i took the time to write a review - taste is tart sweet cherries, not much else. a minor booziness highlights the cough syrup qualities, would be nice to taste some malt in there. interesting. glad i tried it, but prob won't check it out any more."
""
"Overall: It's a great looking beer, but other than that I wasn't much of a fan. The cherry flavors are pleasant, but there's also some medicinal notes that accompany it and make it feel a little bit like drinking a cherry cough drop."
""
"O: Not a bad beer but for the price I would have gotten something more true to style, or in other words, I would not have bought this if I knew it was sweetened. Doesn't say it on the bottle but its obvious while drinking."
""
""
"This pours a reddish brown color with a very thin head of carbonation. The aroma is sweet with cherries and hints of oak. The taste is rather interest as it’s not quite a sour ale and not quite a lambic either. Taste fairly good with a touch of carbonation. Still kind of a desert beer though. Not bad, I would recommend trying it."
""
""
""
""
"O-I have a hard time calling this brew an oud bruin because it drinks more like a high-powered kriek. The flavors are quite sweet and cherry-forward and once you get over the massive sweetness, there is a little bit of enjoyment to be had. This beer might work for dessert, but unless you want sweetness, be wary. Side note, I feel like this brew is very comparable to Delirium Red."
"O: This beer focus on fruit, sweet-tart and light spice. If you don't like sweet beer you might want to avoid this one, I think it has a decent sweet-tart balance but the sugar is winning here"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good ale that really highlights the cherry. I didn't even realize until now that there are cherries on the label. I'm a little dense sometimes. If you lean towards fruit beers or sours you should give this a try."
"Overall, I give it 3.5 for the cherrific fun of drinking it, and the ample buzz provided by the alcohol content. But if you don't really, really like cherries, don't buy this. You'll be disappointed"
""
""
""
"Pours a deep plum color with faint ruby highlights and a handsome cap of pink-tinged foam. The aroma consists most prominently of sour cherry. The flavor has a puckering sourness up front, accompanied by a strong cherry flavor reminiscent of cough syrup. There is also a slight oaken flavor that appears to struggle some against the cherry backbone. I'm a fan of Petrus, and of sour ales in general, but not so much of cherry. In this case, the cherry flavor is so predominant that it overrides my affinity for the style. Cherry lovers will doubtless enjoy this brew, but it's a bit too one-dimensional for my tastes."
""
""
""
"O: Not even close to the beer that Petrus Aged Pale is, though I admire the ingenuity. I expected a sour beer, I didn’t get it, and now I’m left with cherry syrup in a glass…despite all that, I did enjoy this drink. Strange beer, for sure."

"Pours a clear dark red with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is very cherry forward with cherry cola, cherry syrup, and dark cherry aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and medicinal cherry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice cherry smell but the flavors are just a bit too much like cough medicine in my opinion."
"Taste starts out initially quite sweet and is met with a good tart cherry note with some dryness, as if it has been aged (which it is). I won't say that it is extremely complex or even that interesting but it's pretty drinkable. Seems to draw a line between a sweet fruit beer and the beginnings of a Flanders red sour. More on the sweet, probably."

"on draught at the yard house in west nyack, ny. Has a great, deep red color with no real head. From the glass, smells like cherry syrup. No real tart at all, very sweet with a sticky feel left on the roof of my mouth. Would pair well with the right foods, buttoo sweet for a pint"
""
"D- hey you're not a fruit beer are you! I like you."
""
"The aroma had me nervous but this turned out well enough in the end. I'm glad I opted for the small bottle though."
"O: It's not bad, but I had really hoped for more. The sour and tart character I expected was mostly lacking. I'm wondering now if this should have been cellared for a period of time - but I don't expect that I'll be trying it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A very mainstream, middle of the road offering in the Petrus line here. Its OK fruit beer, nothing special or something I'd look for again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep ruby red like color with a skim white head and leaves very little lace. The aroma is of cherries. The taste starts out with a sweet cherry flavor and then gives way to a tart okay cherry flavor. The mouth feel is moderately carbonated and sticky. Overall its a very good tasting beer but not very complex. Its an easy drink and one I will have again."
""
"This beer was recommended to me by where I buy my beer sometimes after he saw I bought a 4 pack of Petrus's Goulden Tripel. I shall return there to thank him."
"Overall: Really leaves an impression so points for that but also somewhat dissapointing. Not what I expected from Petrus. An 11oz. bottle seemed like too much. Would drink it again in a smaller portion. Possibly with a dessert/cheeses or by itself after dinner. Could also be interesting mixed with a wheat beer or stout."
"O: This almost seems more like a Flanders Red than an Oud Bruin. But it is enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is deep red with nice clarity and splotchy head. Nose is full of candied cherry with mild tart notes throughout. The fruit definitely tames the sour of the base and adds a great deal of sweetness. Taste is sweet up front and still sweet at the end with a slight tartness. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Overall, the fruit is too artificial and sweet for my liking. It makes an otherwise delicious beer run of the mill."
""
""
""
""
"Petrus Aged Red is a really strange beer to add to the Petrus line up. It's a good beer for sure. Not great, but certainly tasty. The problem is that it is not sour at all. Petrus Aged Red is a sweet, cherry forward beer. There's almost no hint of tartness at all in there. I enjoyed it, but couldn't help but think about how much better it would be if it were just a little tart as I drank it."
""
""
""
""
"A decent kriek. An okay oud bruin. I wanted to judge the cherry character, but it's somewhat legit. A little too sweet, but the maltiness is nice."
""
""
"I mixed a little bit in a separate glass with some Voodoo Cowbell, and it was quite dandy."
""
""
"This was a really nice beer. The cherries were intense and tart and added a great compliment to this sour ale. I was really impressed. This is definitely worth a try."
""
"O - A great beer for tasting and sharing, but I'm not sure I'd purchase for a casual, laid back beer. Overall, a really sweet, creamy body with delicious tart, cherry notes at the back."
"O- A disappointment compared to Petrus Aged Pale, but still a drinkable beer. I was hoping that is was going to be sour and great, but it isn't even that dart. I probable won't get this again since Petrus Aged Pale is a little cheaper."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - nice beer and very good example of the style. I was really looking forward to this beer and had big expectations."
""
"A nice blend of vaguely tart with oak and earth and a boat load of cherry skin and flesh. Solid with some bonus points for not being a cloyingly sweet cherry mess."
"O - it's 8.5% and drinks like semi-malty cherry soda with less sugar. I enjoyed it for what it is, a dangerously quaffable cherry beer."
""
""
""
"Overall consider me a fanboy but I can't bash any beer with such great cherry flavor. It doesn't taste artificial to boot so I am not sure why the hate. One of the best fruit based beers I had in a while. If it wasn't for the 10 dollar price tag I would have a bottle in my fridge every week."
""
""
""
""
"O: An OK Flanders Red, but at this price point, I'd much rather go with Rodenbach Red. The Aged Pale is much better and traditional."
"Drain poured."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A tasty beer overall. Not as good as Petrus Aged Pale and lacking some complexity, but if you want a nice, simple, tart, and fruity beer, this is a good option and reasonably priced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A beautiful glass of beer. Sweeter than expected. Could show more sour to balance the sweetness for my tastes."
