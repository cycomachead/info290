"D - A solid cherry sour brown that I enjoyed a fair bit. Well-crafted with a solid integration of flavors. I'd happily drink this again, although I probably wouldn't actively try to trade for it considering the rarity factor."

"This beer pours a light to medium bodied cherry polished wood in color with slight lacing around the glass. The nose features a really nice amount of tart cherries to pair with dark malt and a nice acidic tartness. The nose is great for the style, pungent. The flavors are off dry and well balanced. You get slightly sweet cherry, tart cherry, sweet brown malts, and and an acetic acidity. The vinegar however is tame, just the way that I would prefer. It has a nice bite too, from the carbonation more than anything. This drinks very, very well. It is more complex than you would imagine and the cherry really does separate itself from the the base sour brown. Overall this is a really nice beer, and a standout for the style."

"Overall: Glad to finally try this. The fruit is very nice, but I think I prefer the regular version."

"Overall, this was a fun beer to try-- and I'm glad Frank made me take a pour."
"O: This was good, but I liked the regular one better. It was a lot more complex and more pleasant to drink."
