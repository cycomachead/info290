3.88,0,4,3.5,4.5,4,3,"This is a ruby-red/dark brown beer. Its aroma is misleading: It prepares you for something else, but the real taste is exceptional. I especially like the strong aftertaste. Its is a strong beer, both in taste and in alcohol, so I wouldn't drink many of these in one session. It's more like a delicacy rather than a beer. I would suggest you have this one with food. It will go well with red meat and chocolate.","dbek","Oct 03, 2008"

3.68,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Very assuring pour. Nice head which would desist into a fine lacing as it warmed. Cloudy brown. Aroma pairs up pretty well with the style, but not as 'authentic' I didn't think. Stronger as it warmed, that's a good thing. Took a little longer to get a feel for, not as distinct or confident as others in this unique style. Mouthfeel is a little too carbonated for a Flemish sour. Nowhere near as complex or wine-like as others. No alcohol , flavours not as pronouced. Flavours disapear quickly, don't stick around. They don't seem to stand out as they should with what this style permits. I liked this beer, but there is so much more to this style","biegaman","Mar 31, 2006"

3.48,-10.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Tightest cork I've run across, and the first where I had to use a corkscrew. Poured a ruddy amber-walnut with a quick, fizzy head. Well carbonated. Some mildly sweet caramel apple flavor up front on the first sip, with alcohol rising sharply. After a few sips, however, caramel and alcohol both receded. Aged orchard fruit and some hints of oak tannin. Not as tart or acidic as other oud bruins I've had. For the high abv and the initial alcohol pungency, the alcohol did mute and this was surprisingly drinkable.","Brent","Aug 15, 2005"
3.75,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The cork popped violently from the black 750ml Vondel bottle, and the ruby brown beer poured with crisp carbonation into my chalice. The cork has the year "2003" printed on it. The head was extremely frothy initially, and then it calmed and formed a steady light brown covering, with a mix of some big and small bubbles. The lacing was a little fizzy, but then turned creamy and moved slowly down the glass. The beer possesses deep reds and rich dark browns; rosewood or even cherry. Aroma is of the dusty yeast, raisins, faint, old maltiness with only a small hint of sourness in the background. The malt shares the spotlight with astringent alcohol. Leather and strong licorice in the smell too, giving some barley-wine aromas. Other notes of brown sugar, horehound, and blackberry. I expected some tartness to the aroma, this being a Flemish brown ale. To me the smell is more like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale; not to say at all that the aroma is bad. Despite the violence with which this ale poured, the taste is actually quite low in carbonation: almost milky and even a little flat. Again I get licorice up front in the mouth, strong dusty malt, and very little alcohol in the taste, though Vondel sends some pleasant coatings of warmth to the stomach rather quickly and deceptively. The taste is well enough, albeit slight on complexity, and the beer is in desparate need of carbonation(though I am not sure if this was a result of storage--this bottle is over 2 years old). There is some lactaid sourness, but nothing very tart or fruity about this beer at all. Now this is odd: the second glass poured from the bottle is actually very carbonated. Indeed, as for carbonation, the first and second pours from this bottle could be two different beers. The finish is mostly malt with some dryness left in the corners of the mouth. The taste also gives some plum or prunes, mixed with the dominant yeast flavour of the beer. Mouthfeel is fickle, as I mentioned, but the beer is definitely full-bodied. Little phenolic presence makes it easy to drink as well. I was expecting more complexity, but taken by itself, this is still a very good beer.","Cwrw","Jun 07, 2005"
3.7,-4.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"330ml bottle: the pour put a ruby high lighted cloudy chestnut ale in my tulip..1 finger rocky tan cap does not last long goes to a surface lace that stays. Aroma is nice like a sour cider with cocoa undertones. Peppery mouth feel from carbonation but once this breaks away you get a rush of flavors..pear cider with chocolate some treacle and toast...marvelous drawn finish that turns syrupy with a rush of sweet licorice and then some warming. Nice brown...a pleasant surprise","pootz","Apr 08, 2005"
4.28,10.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Very balanced and complex, though lacking the sourness/barnyard flavors I would expect from an oud bruin. Regardless, an excellent beer.","Tim2000","Mar 15, 2005"
3.76,-3.1,4,3,4,4,4,"I was very excited to try a flanders oud bruin and this was the only one I could find in my area. I think the store was clearing them out. I have seem quite a bit of this in the area and it doesn't seem to be moving too quick. The head on this was massive in my duvel glass without any aggression in the pour. The color of the body was a raison brown. The head was very fluffy and light and eventually settled down to a thin film that concentrated itself to the middle of the glass. The aroma was filled with raison, malt, and small amounts of alcohol esters. There was also a cocoa and cherry backbone. The taste was sweet and tart at the beggining and finished a little dry and malty. The alcohol was very well hidden in the taste, but it hit me hard midway through the bottle. This is a very nice beer that would be enjoyable for a late night drink.","ALESwhatCURESya","Dec 21, 2004"
3.8,-2.1,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"pours a nice copper color, accompanied with a large frothy carbonation. The smell is different kind of tart, definitely sweet. Taste is definitely malty sweet. Chocolate, caramel, plums, and yet a tartness sneaks through from the bacteria. Definitely sweet, a little more tartness would have been appreciated, but overall not a bad brew, would drink it again.","bnuttz","Oct 27, 2004"

3.14,-19.1,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,"On tap in Quebec city. rusty, muddy brown with a small, almost non-existant head. The aromas are of sweet malts, sugar, and a bit of oud bruin lactic funk. The taste is way too sweet up front, and not funky enough for an oud bruin. Their are also some slight fruit flavors in this brew making it seem like an oud bruin flemish red hybrid. The mouthfeel was sugary and sticky, and the drinkability was blah. Why even try this if you can have Goudenband?","francisweizen","Sep 14, 2004"
3.61,-7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"75 cl bottle with a cork dating of 3/2001. Pours a cloudy reddish chestnut with a big, fluffy beige head that lasts for a good while and laces decently. Yeasty, cinammony, cocoa, obviously malty, red appley and earthy aromas. Slight suggestion of red wine in the aroma, too. Faint, chalk-like mouthfeel, indicating a modest body. Malty and sweet, but overly so. The maltiness comes across sometimes as being cardboardy. It's not as sour as I seem to remember, or maybe the aging subdued those qualities that I seem to foggily remember. There is a slight woody-like shallow tartness. The taste is pretty bland when compared to other beers of the style. I like it, but I'm not really enthralled with the beer's lack of character. It's just lacking some gusto as well as some tartness. If a malty brown is what you're looking for, go for it. If you want a world class oud bruin, I could make better suggestions.","crookedhalo","Sep 11, 2004"

4.15,7,4,4,4,3.5,5,"Lightly turbid deep crimson hue. Frothy, pitted beige head leaves rough lace. Mellow balsamic tartness and leather upfront in aroma. Sweet cocoa, carob and black licorice hints are secondary. Well rounded aromawise. In flavor, incipient is a gentle combination of notes of black currant and lactic, fermented plum. Soft dark toffee tones ensue and provide lightly sweet contrast. Herbal phenols surface as the beer warms and meld well with the persistent woody, oak presence. Stately baker's chocolate hints and slightly roasty, dark kilned malt notions arise as well. Static, mildly musty yeast undertone. Initially spritzy and carbonic, eventually settling into a lightly viscous, well attenuated mouthfeel. A touch on the thin side. Finishes with hints of sherry and diluted chocolate buttermilk. A well crafted Old Brown that exhibits fine balance of acidity and its chocolate themed malt backbone. Quite tasty, indeed. Ethanol content is discernible only due to benign throat coating warmth. Definitely recommended.","marc77","Jun 17, 2004"
4.35,12.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours with a three-finger, bubbly light brown head that fades quickly and leaves a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation. Nose is sweet malt/alcohol.

4.55,17.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"This stuff was awesome! I gotta give much thanks to my bro Spyridon for hookin' me up at the Super Bowl party. It came in a huge bottle, so we could both enjoy our equal share of the bounty. It was a cloudy brownish/amber color, with a creamy tan head. The head stayed around for a while. The smell had many different angles to it. At first smell, it was a sweet, brown sugary smell, but then gave way to a semi-strong grapeish smell. The fruity smell carried over to the taste, but also had the token belgian taste to it, ie the malty body w/ a tinge of alcohol and dark fruits. The alcohol was hardly present and made it even more enjoyable. I really do think that I could drink this stuff all night/day. Ofcourse, my liver wouldn't thank me for that, so it would be impossible.","JISurfer","Feb 01, 2004"
4.23,9,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This is the 1999 vintage from a 750ml corked bottle. Definately a great beer, maybe because of the vintage, I don't know. First off, I was under the impression that a Flemish Brown was supposed to be sour, i.e. with some bacteria...maybe that's oud bruin. Anyway, the beer looks so pretty, especially when swirled about in a tulip glass. It swirls around and around with the head forming and mixing with the uppermost layer of reddish brown beer....oh its pretty! The nose is nice, very caramel/toffee, maybe some raisons with definately some alcohol there. The taste is very rich. very nice soft fruit flavors, mostly raison with some caramel and the alcohol is quite prominent which is the only reason I didn't give this beer a 4.5 in the taste category.","cerevisiaephilus","Oct 31, 2003"

3.55,-8.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a very rich and dark ale and not a flander red per say in my opinion. Large head when pourred into glass but it did disapear a little bit too quickly.

3.99,2.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"A very good beer to say the least. The spices were noticed when I smelled the beer.

3.83,-1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Green bottle definitely left me worried about reviewing this one, but there was no need a well taken care of sample from Sharp Edge Creekhouse. Pours a deep amber mahogany with a beige toned nicely developed head leaving a thin collar of lacing around my snifter. Aroma has a wine like vinous character to it mixed with an underlying spiced up sweet aroma. Taste is sweet and tangy shimmering malt and fruit tones along with a very nice dry finish completing this beer. Mouthfeel has a healthy amount of carbonation with a light medium bodied beer nice full body from the darker roasts this beer works very well for my tastes and dances along my palate. Drinkability is definitely good especially for a flemish brown ale, just the high abv holds it back from becoming a true session beer in my eyes.","WVbeergeek","Jun 28, 2003"

Finish is bittersweet, pungently acidic, hops are pleasant in their spiciness, quite dry and somewhat alcohol bitter aftertaste.
