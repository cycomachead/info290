Just a light brown skim around the edges.  Body is a murky brown pond of mystery.  Nose is beautiful and packed with tons of dark fruit and dusty sour notes.  This subtle sour feel is soft but full and wonderful.  Abruptly sour at first with the initial sip.  Dry and sharp with lemon zest and cherry skins all over the tongue.  There is a nice consistent robust feel that mixes with the sour to crate an incredible sour beer drinking experience here.  Really spot on for the style and unique at the same time.","SPLITGRIN","Feb 14, 2015"

Still, there are some pleasant vinous, oak, and oxidation notes. Firmly sour but tending too far toward the acetic end of the spectrum, even for the style. The beer was nearly still and I think some carbonation would have livened things up. I was told this bottle was a few years old.","HopHead84","Nov 27, 2014"

4,-3.8,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 2/10/2011. Pours slightly hazy very dark reddish brown color with a small light khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of blackberry, cranberry, cherry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, pepper, hay, straw, brown bread, leather, herbal, musty funk, and oak/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt, yeast ester, and wine barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of blackberry, cranberry, cherry, green apple, red grape, clove, oak, red wine vinegar, brown bread, light chocolate, leather, herbal, pepper, musty funk, and oak/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy/spicy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of blackberry, cherry, cranberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, red wine vinegar, brown bread, light chocolate, pepper, herbal, leather, musty funk, and oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of malt, wine barrel, and fruity/acidic yeast flavors; with a nice malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with lightly slick and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Flanders brown ale. All around good balance and complexity of malt, fruity/acidic yeast, and wine barrel flavors; and nicely smooth to sip on with the moderate level of acidity. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 09, 2014"

Pours slightly darker than mahogany with a loose, off-white head that immediately disperses into a soapy swirl - no lacing on this one. Nose is quite characteristic of the style - cherry Sucrets, tannins and perhaps the faintest trace of vanilla. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also some leather and tobacco notes in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a light, even carbonation. Additionally, the inherent acidity of this beer stimulates the sides of the cheeks and leaves a residual burn at the back of the throat between quaffs. Overall, a solid example of the style. I really can't find any fault with this beer; however, there are other Flanders Oud Bruins that I feel are more nuanced.","Jwale73","Aug 25, 2013"

Quite extreme though acidity level is balanced. Not something I would have everyday bit interesting nonetheless.","Phyl21ca","Nov 28, 2012"

It is as interesting as can be for the style and has a nice, although moderate, level of sourness. The least impressive part of this beer are the body and mouthfeel. It poured almost flat and drinks flat, almost like a still lambic. Tis definitely takes away from the drinkability and desirability of this beer, good flavor or not.

Looks similar to a wine. The smell of wood, cherries, and plenty of funk on the nose. The taste right from the fridge was sour and gave off some elements of fresh tobacco and tart cherry in the aftertaste. As the beer warmed I feel that it started to become a little more balanced. The flavors didn't transition as much as when it was colder. The funk became less dominant as it warmed also.

Cherries, grapes, red wine, vinegar, oak, vanilla, barnyard funk, loam, after reading the label I thought I could pick out something akin to rhubarb.

Aromas of bran muffins, cherry cola, milk chocolate, light vinegar and alcohol. Second pour has a bit of ferrous character to the nose. Flavor is interesting, to say the least. The aroma suggests a malty oud bruin style beer but it tastes like an intentionally soured stout. Big helpings of roasty and toasty malts, a firm acetic sourness, and notes of dried fruit. A nice surprise since I can't stand oud bruins that taste like rotten Dr. Pepper. Dry but not astringent on the palate, lengthy finish, sorta thin.

Small spots of lace slide back down into the beer on the drink down. Smells of red wine vinegar, oak, and funk/must. Taste is exactly the same with the red wine/balsalmic vinegar, oak wood, and funk/must. The oak flavors are very noticeable on the aftertaste. There is a sour and acidic twang that lingers on the tongue after each sip. Mouthfeel is pretty flat which makes this beer a bit of a chore to drink. The sourness level would be better with more carbonation present. Overall, this is a good beer with nice oak notes in the taste but the carbonation issue leaves something to be desired.","UCLABrewN84","May 10, 2011"

4.28,2.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured into a Duvel tulip, dark brown with ruby edges, a finger of off-white/tan head that left some minute lacing on the glass. Nice aroma on this one, with the wood notes coming out first, followed up by a pleasant sour and earthiness with maybe a touch of lemon and cherry. Taste is very nice. A good dose of sourness is there, but it's not bracing or overbearing, with a solidly sweet and bready malt backing. There's even an underlying chocolate taste that keeps things very interesting, which melds nicely with the oak and sour. Not much in the way of funk in this brew, but I like that in a Flanders style ale. Light lemon and cherry that were in the nose can be found in the taste, as well as a dash of vinegar. Somewhat sweet at first, but a dry, and sour finish. This is a great starter sour, much akin to the likes of Rodenbach Grand Cru. Medium-full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Not too light, and not too prickly. Overall, this is a solid Flanders Oud Bruin and definitely a great place to start if you're new to sours. Not overly tart and tongue-trashing, but still sour and incredibly drinkable for the high ABV.","KeefD","Apr 15, 2010"

3.3,-20.7,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours blood red, with a thin tan head. Looks pretty normal for an Oud Bruin. A little clearer than I expected, but, looks alright. The smell has old strawberries, which I've come to know in wild bacteria, but isn't exactly my favorite smell in these, with eggs and vinegar, not quite as vinegary as some in the class. Again, doesn't stand out, isn't particularly bad, and it has the right kind of characteristics, but not my favorite. The taste has oranges, the acidic, very citric part, with a slight bready toastiness, which is slightly unexpected, and nice. It's still very sour, very acidic, but not very tart - if that makes sense, maybe not enough sweetness. The old strawberries come back, which remind me of old food, old fruit, a bit of old cherries. And surprisingly, I can taste a bit of wood. I expected a little more of that pleasant tartness, like young/ripe cherries and strawberries (this tastes overripe, to reiterate), blended with a pleasant sweetness. This kind of works towards what I want, then kind of falls short in taste. Finishes very acidic, it's actually hard to tell whether it's sweet or dry, and that may be the main problem. The body is nice, medium-full, fuller than I expected, moderate carbonation, pleasant for the style. Overall, it's decent, I would maybe have it again, definitely wouldn't pay for it. It's not the most impressive, which means that if I were going to this style, I would probably go to something new, or something else that I like better. I think it may have been a little young, or could've used some blending with an older version.","taylorhamrick","Mar 02, 2010"

4.77,14.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"500ml bottle, Batch 49, Brewed Oct 10, 2006. Best by date of April 30, 2011. Wow! What a fantastic beer. I love the all the nuances here and the deft use of oak. Pours a slightly murky brown with a fair head of very tight bubbles. Very nice combo of tannic oak and sour fruit in the nose. The bottle says it was aged in oak barrels previously used for Sherry and Rhubarb wine. You can definitely pick up some Sherry notes, and the use of oak that still carries some Rhubarb is brilliant- the vegetal sourness of the Rhubarb marries beautifully with the sourness of the beer and the tannins from the barrel. The taste is even more complex and intense. Starts out fairly soft and lightly sour, and then the tannins from the oak build into a spicy, woody, crescendo followed by a blast of Rhubarb, some acetic notes, and late barnyard laced with more wood tang. Just superb. The mouthfeel is quite oaky, but softer than you might think with the oak and the sourness in balance and a touch of creaminess to offset the woody blast. As intense as this beer is, I found the flavors so well developed, if not subtle, that I could keep on drinking this for a while. The 8.5% abv is extremely well hidden as well. Extremely well done this one, no shortcuts here. 3 years of aging in barrels with character shows through beautifully. Bravo.","Georgiabeer","Jul 01, 2009"

Taste is just as good, sour cherries up front, very tart, nice malty middle, rhubarb, lemon acidity, fruit, oak, very earthy and woody, cherry pit bitterness, very sour finish, awesome.

Honestly, for the money, this is as good as Concecration or even Cuvee de Tomme.

High strength prevents this from the drinkability it might have were it in the 6% ballpark, but it's still so enjoyable...just requires more time (or sipping partners) to consume. Definitely recommended! (Great beer to bring along, Bryce!)","msubulldog25","May 17, 2009"

The major comparison I have thus far is that it's very close to the Jolly Pumpkin La Roja I had a few weeks back. It's fairly easy to drink, but is probably more suitable for sharing. The next time I drink this one I'd definitely love to pair it with some good soft cheese.","amneziak","Mar 22, 2009"

It smells like wood, cherries, malts, hint of rubber cement, smells about on par for the style. It tastes like an oud bruin but very subtle. Slight bit of sour, slight bit of wood and and it seems a little harsh to my tongue. I am a sucker for sour beers at this point so I buckled and paid the high price tag, I should have bought a La Folie instead.","ArrogantB","Mar 10, 2009"
4.3,3.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"A nice sour ale from HaandBryggeriet. Pours a redwood color with a thin tan head. The nose has tart fruits, sweet malts, oak and a subtle musty funk. Tatse is a nice balance of the sweet malts and tart fruity flavors. Could use more of a manure/famyard presence. Crisp body feels full on the palate and has an acidic finish. Good stuff.","rye726","Mar 07, 2009"

Served chilled in a tulip this one was consumed on 03/05/2009. The pour was very nice with a rich medium brown color and a nice light tan head on top. Nearly opaque with some light reddish touches to the sides and bottom. Deep horse funk on the nose with apple vinegar and ripe sour apples dominating the aroma with some light oak notes as it warmed. The flavor was crisp tart and very full. Ripe apples and sour fruits just ripping through the mouth. Puckeringly good here with a great carbonation level and really solid body all around. Some nice notes of oak as it warms and a rich sour ale really comes to life. Overall a fantastic beer I will gladly buy again.","mikesgroove","Feb 25, 2009"
4.27,2.6,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: with it's masked alcohol (not tasted at all) this scores incredibly high with the drinkability, with it's only retraction being the lack of balance between the tart and the body.","murrayswine","Feb 21, 2009"

4.26,2.4,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability - I could drink this all the time, the flavor is awesome. The only place I fault this beer is consistency. Everytime I have this brew, it always tastes slightly different. I figure this is brew is done in small batches using multiple barrels, and each of those barrels have their own character, but this beer is all over the place. Some bottles - all from the same batch - have been more sweet and fruity, more sour, or more oaky. Overall, very tasty.","MiguelMandingo","Beers"

It is a very interesting sour and I really enjoy what the oak-aging does for it. It's a little spendy but definitely worth it, my only regret is not sharing this with anyone.","optiontwo","0"
4.37,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours an opaque dark brown with gorgeous red highlights. Thick lacing clings tightly to the glass. Smells of green apples, sour cherries, and juicy natural funk make for an amazing nose. First sip is puckering tart. The green apples and sour cherries combine with the wild yeast to create an incredible taste. Sherry and oak flavors support this beer and enhance the flavor. As it warms the sourness increases. The mouthfeel really stands out as the beer treats my tongue like a dance floor. I'm guessing this is bottled conditioned. I am grateful Norway's beer is better than her politics. Haandbakk is among my favorite sour ales.","ATLbeerDog","Jan 19, 2009"

The sour, spicy aroma is spot on and the flavor is complex and satisfying in a way that makes me truly sorry I did not get another bottle of this when I had the chance.","nickfl","Dec 27, 2008"
4.52,8.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Batch 49. Brewed 10/10/06. Without a doubt, this is exceptional beer that has been brewed with the utmost care and skill. It is also seems like a fairly unique flavor even among sours, not that I've been lucky enough to have sampled too many. The beer tastes strongly of oak and is very tart. The tartness is sour cherry with a vinous character. I had a small glass of champagne earlier, and the flavor of this beer is closer to that than to a lot of other beers. You can just really taste the oak barrel, and that oak makes things quite dry. The pucker is much more complex than I'm used to. I imagine the beer would age incredibly well. The alcohol isn't felt in the least behind the enormous tart flavor. It's definitely a sipping beer. I have no idea what it could possibly be paired with, food-wise. I can barely taste anything but the beer after that pucker. It could be good as an ingredient in a dish rather than a pairing. It's an expensive beer, but it's good enough to justify the price. I mean I'm not going to go out and buy a case, but I definitely want to try as many different beers from this brewery as possible and it would be a great gift to any fan of sours.","popery","Dec 25, 2008"

It poured a dark brown with purple highlights and a small tan head that quickly turned into a ring. The nose has plums, a load of sour cherry, and I think there is some vanilla. The taste has a nice tartness without being puckering, there is a lactic twinge had a sweetness hidden in between the cherry tart start and finish. The finish is real dry with a hint of lingering cherry. Overall very tasty.","orsulacp","Dec 18, 2008"

This beer poured a dark mahogany hue with a two-finger thick head of tan foam that lingered for a bit. Some slippery lacing was left behind. The aroma of the beer included cherry pits, wet oak, fermented fruits, cider vinegar, and also a touch of alcohol. The flavor consisted of caramel, rasins, sour cherries, and oak. While moderately sweet, there is a nice sourness that helps even things out. Slightly puckering. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had light carbonation.

4.38,5.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It's funny, I'd forgotten this was aged in rhubarb wine casks. The first thing that popped to my mind was a rhubarb tart! Moderately acetic with plenty of fruit, some red wine, a little bit of sherry, and a rather rotten meat-like character I've found in some Flemish reds. I don't typically care for this character, but in this minimal amount, it is compelling and enjoyable. The palate is a lot sourer than I'd like, with a clean red wine vinegar character, almost enough to clean the sinuses. The problem with some of these overly acetic beers is that a little bit of oxidation makes them feel flabby on the palate, as well as a little soapy. Sherry and rhubarb are noticeable, especially on the mid-palate. Drying, acetic on the finish with some strong lactic character as well, this beer is moderately carbonated. Too acetic for my palate, I wish I'd drunk this a while back. 4.5/4/3/3/3.5","DefenCorps","Nov 22, 2008"
