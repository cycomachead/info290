"The taste is build up around the yeast, there is nice, complex and mild lactic acid taste that plays together well with the light dark malt taste. The malts add a nice caramellic and molasses taste, without giving a malt bitterness. The yeast appears to be more complex than just yeast. It is lactic and adds vineous tastes. The mouthfeel is light and thin, but the alcohol and tart flavors makes the beer a full-bodied beer, instead of empty."

"Hmmmm - not the best effort and hard to place. The aroma suggests old wood-aged beer with a pleasant acidity, but the flavour is an indistinct mess. I was hoping for a more clearly defined character; perhaps more wood and less yeast. The body also leaves you wanting more. Interesting and quite complex, but not the best drinking experience. Pick one up if you come across it but no need to seek it out."
"The pour is a murky brown color with an off-white head. Grass, leather, and vinegar to open things up. A bit of sweet dark fruits such as raisins and plums. A hint of metal is present on the nose as well. The flavor is fairly acetic with balsamic vinegar aromas. Lots of leather, grass, and dark fruit. A touch of sweetness gives it a little balance. High carbonation adds to drying feeling on the finish."
"O: An all-around terrible beer. Really a bummer because I was expecting this to be better. Can't win them all though."

"Overall a solid Flemish red."
"Overall I wasn’t a big fan of this beer, though it has one of the larger differences between aroma and flavor I’ve come across in a while. The tartness is hardly noticeable in the aroma but is huge in the flavor. An interesting beer that isn’t worth seeking but is worth a try if you come across it."
"Pours deep black with dark brown on sides & ruby reflects to the light. Crown is dense & brief so lacing does. Floral & citric aromas. Intense sourness on palate. Light body. Thankfully the aftertaste is sweety fruit.Drinkable if comes along with food. Balanced flavors & aromas associated with wood aged Oud Bruins are missed."
"Overall a very ordinary, not a lot happening flavour or aroma wise and nothing much else there to improve it."
"Overall:It's got some complex flavors, but the copper flavors were really not to my taste. I'm hoping that this was just a tap line problem."
"Purchased at Bier Temple in Brussels and it survived the trip home. Pours dark mahagony with plenty of carbonation. Taste is bright and tart with some residual sweetness in the aftertaste. Definitely fuller bodied than other oud bruins I've had. In short, very delicious."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of dark fruit - mainly cherries - as well as a lot of caramel and toffee malt. The flavor is toffee and caramel malt, which are complimented by some lightly tart cherries and some dry cocoa. A very nice mix that goes very well. The beer is very dry and is slightly sour. Easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and even some lacing. Aroma of brown sugar malt with medium lactic acid notes. Taste is also a mix between some tart and light acid notes with a solid malt backbone with notes of brown sugar. Body is more full then I was expecting with a very solid malt backbone and caramelized notes with good carbonation. Well done and more complex then a straightforward Flanders red or oud bruin."
