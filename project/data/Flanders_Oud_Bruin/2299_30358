I haven't had much in the way of beers from Flanders or in a Flanders Oud Bruin style but this was much easier than I was led to have guessed and proof that more breweries should give something like this a go. The subtle complexity made me want more and if it was just a tad less potent, this would make for a fabulous session beer.","JerzDevl2000","Mar 17, 2015"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The nose hints of wet horse blanket, light tartness, a blend of fresh and over ripe fruit. Pours reddish brown with a slight haze under a tan tinted finely bubbled 1” white foam cap. This is not as intensely sour on the palate as other Flemish Red Ales coming across a little sweeter and tamer with fruit, plums, cherries, and malt but no chocolate or roast and just a little tang with a sweet tart finish. It has a medium body and low medium carbonation.","pat61","Mar 11, 2015"

3.76,-0.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"a little steep i think at ten bucks a go, but pretty cool beer here. is a flanders red type through and through, with its vinegar sour profile and sweet malt middle. this is interesting to looks at, not much head, very syrupy texture, and a lot of haze, even for the style. it smells nice, rich and fruity, almost gummy on the malt body, red malt transcends the caramel realm for dark ripe fruit, apple, and bread pudding. the flavor matches the nose, with moderate acidity balanced out by dried fruity sweetness. cherry and raisin come to mind, brown sugar, lemon. the sweetness and the vinegar are weird, and i am glad i am sharing the bottle, but the beer does appear to be quite traditional. have not seen this in out market here until recently. more body than the style calls for makes it linger a little too long and lose some of its refreshing qualities, but its mature beer, far out, and tasty on the whole, especially if you like the traditional belgian sour red types. Lots and lots of barrel here, if that's your thing","StonedTrippin","Mar 07, 2015"

There is big perfume, funk, and sweetness from the aroma, hitting most of the necessary notes quite nicely. The taste, however, was a bit curious as none of the tartness (or substantial oak) lingers through the sip. It hits hard at the front of your teeth, but is all but indiscernible through the end and aftertaste, where basic cooked brown maltiness predominates. This is partially rectified by the soft, creamy slurp of the feel. In conclusions we did not feel that our bottle was infected. This beer marks a good representation of the style, but lacked enough jazz or cohesion to pull it to the next level.","TheBrewo","Apr 23, 2013"

Musty, mixed with a tangy sweet scent. Lots of yeast scent as well. The taste is both sweet and sour, with a little slant to the tangy side. Not quite mouth puckering, but rather cleansing. Fuller in body than I expected. This is a nice beer, on style, and very approachable.","Suds","Feb 14, 2013"

Taste is sweet over sour and it's very apparent. Vinegar, cherry, cola, sweet malt, you get the picture. Very reminiscent of Duchesses.

Still, the taste just didn't do it for me. I was expecting a little more sour and not so much sweetness. I'm not saying it was very sweet, but it did have that slight doppelbock caramel note I was not expecting in a flemish sour. I would try again if offered but Im not going to go out of my way to seek it out.

I can taste tart apples and cherries and vinegar, but there's also a lot of caramel malt and sweet dark fruit noticable. Don't get me wrong, I like the taste of this beer but the tartness isn't even close to what I expected. The taste is sweeter than the aroma would lead you to believe.

Smells fairly sour, with some fruit notes coming through. Sweet malt in the background, along with some woody earthiness. The taste echoes this, with a sharp, though not overpowering, sourness at first. As the palate gets accustomed to this, some vinous notes become evident and the crystal malt comes through. Finishes dry and oaky. Smooth feel thanks to the medium body and low carbonation. A pretty decent oud bruin.","philipquarles","Jan 08, 2009"

Light tartness in the aroma, berries and unripe fruits, a little earthy, very slightly acetic. Mild sourness with a bit of toffee amid the berry, cherry and red grape fruit flavours and the leafy earthiness. A bit more acidic in the finish as the other flavours faded. Medium to light bodied with lowish carbonation, a bit viscous. Easy drinking and probably a good introduction to the style for those not already into sour beers.","DrJay","Nov 29, 2008"

3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark, clear brown with a ruby hue and a thin creme head. Nose is mildly funky, fruity, and sour. Flavor is smooth but almost mild in a way.

Nose only starts to come through once the beer warms up. Mildly sour, with salty malt. Light toffee sweetness, and lightly vinous. Not bad, but certainly not overpowering nor overly complex. Flavor is nice. Dry swarthy spiced sour malt up front. That sourness heats up as the beer goes on. Dirty, lightly roasted feel shows up as well. Light toffee sweetness. Mostly sour overall. Body is solid, appropriate to the style, and the carbonation works well with the sourness. Overall, I was in the mood for a sour brew, and this one hit the spot. It's not really blowing my mind- and I could do with some more complexity - but its a solid beer, if it fits what you're looking for.","soupyman10","Apr 20, 2008"

4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a subtle sourness that yields to the oak barrel aroma. It's well rounded with crystal and roasted malts; very nice. The taste is good. It has a subdued sour flavor that really works well with the oak aging. It's mellowed out and thus increases the drinkability. The malt content consists of some pale and roasted malts. It's doesn't appear to be too sweet. On the contrary, it's dry and quite light in the mouthfeel. It's a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer. I love the oak contribution. It tames the sourness to a level that most would enjoy.","WesWes","Jan 29, 2008"

There is also a slight vegetal aroma and some dusty smelling fruit. The taste is a little light, and once again more on the sweet than the sour side. Still, none of the unpleasant vegetal odors manifest in th taste at all. Mouthfeel is very fizzy, a little too much so. Overall, this beer is a little too sweet for the style for my taste and a bit out of balance. Not bad, but there are a number of better options.","Georgiabeer","Jan 04, 2008"

The brew was poured to a dark reddish color with a creamy head that was medium in size and left nice sheets of lacing down the side of the glass. Nice berry aroma, mostly cherry I believe along with a slight vinegar sourness that is subtle but noticeable. The taste is very smooth with a tart berry flavor, to me the berries come out more clearly here with raspberries, cherries, and maybe plum? Has a sourness to it but does not seem to be a pronounced as in some other Flanders red offerings. Over all I think that this is a nice offering, very tame beer based on the style which has its good points. I would get this brew again in the future.","Stimack","May 07, 2006"
