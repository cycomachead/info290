"Cherry and vinegar in the aroma; very unpleasant metallic taste"
""
""
"Sweet, crisp, tart, and slightly bready. A good sour for a cool fall night. Body was a little heavy, but flavor profile was ll there."
"This is drinking SO much better than at release. A bit more tartness and a hit of an acetic cherry flavor. I can't be sure the metallic flavor has completely fallen off (hard to be objective when I know how pronounced that flavor was when the beer was fresh) but at a minimum, it's dramatically reduced. This is starting to feel more like a good example of the style rather than an average-to-mediocre one."
"Absolutely terrible.  Tasted like a mouthful of pennies and rust.  This one did not age gracefully."
""

"2/21...pours reddish amber, white foam, that settles down with some lacing. Sour malty nose. Taste is a subtle sour, somewhat watery. Tart and sweet. Some oak. Woodsy sour, simple. Light carbonation. Citrus pokes through."
""
""
"O: Good beer, not great, but well above average.  Would have liked more of the sour characters from the aroma to come out in the taste.  Enjoyable though, and definitely worth a try.  4"
""
"Overall not bad, nice sourness and malt, nice acidity, bit too sticky, nice buttery oak but gets too buttery and slimy perhaps diacetyl but that's weird for this style do probably just the lacto and oak."
"Low B- (3.32)"
""
"Very metallic.  Not the best representation of the style."
""
""
"Perfectly balanced sour, smells delicious. Color is murky, but still appealing."
""
"O-This is my second Flanders and I like this one much more. Complex taste and not overpoweringly sour. Pretty creamy but also refreshing."

"Overall: This is a very nice offering. I would drink it again and if it were available where I live I would probably try to pick up some, I am not sure how it is packaged. Nevertheless, it is solid and enjoyable, especially one to end the night on."

"Overall, this isn't a bad beer but it doesn't match up to really great Belgian Oud Bruins. The balance in the nose is good, but the sourness (subdued as it may be) is more acetic and doesn't quite match the malty sweetness. I'm not terribly impressed with the beer overall  or as an example of the style."
""
""
"A decent beer. Clean and somewhat refreshing, as most tart, sour beers are. I liked it but since sours type beers aren't a style to which I gravitate, I wouldn't have this again (mostly because of costs)."
""
""
""
""
"Disappointed overall, but I'm compring against their other sour efforts, which are some of my favorites. (Wild ale, cran bic)"

"very nice.... a new style for me, sour and sweet.  complex."
"i was the only one in my group impressed by this, and i have to explain it like this. if you are looking for a belgian type old world oud briun, this is not your beer. this is uniquely american, more than that, uniquely wisconsin, and i dug it a whole lot. lighter in color, beige and brown together with a caramel tint and a tall fizzy off white head. it smells like a funked out raw apple cider, tart enough, but thats only one element among several. the apple fruitiness is really cool, the grain isnt the least bit sweet, and the yeast profile is a nice mix of acidity building bacteria and classic farmhouse tang. lighter in body and feel than any belgian take ive had, with some of the most intensely effervescent carbonation out there and only a medium body at the most. the beer finishes forever, its like a musty old decaying wooden cider press, the kind of thing you appreciate and revere, even if its less useful than it once was, or usurped by some more modern technology in the name of efficiency or profit or labor reduction. i for one love what i get here, a nice slice of vintage americana in a belgian style ale, unlike any other out there."
""
"Sours aren't usually my thing. This one was good. nice tart and sweet at the same time. Very malty in the aftertaste. The nose was full of oak and whisky. Smell had more alcohol than did taste. Much more drinkable than a lot of this style (for me...)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this one good potential, but the mid-palate was just to watery to match the tart finish.  Perhaps some age will help"
""
"O- Though the flavors marry well together, I was looking for both a tad more sweetness and a tad more sourness.  Still, a pretty easygoing sour that I would recommend to someone trying to break in to the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is good right now, but not quite as flavorful as it could be. All the flavors I want are there; I just believe some age or maybe some slight alterations in the recipe or process could really bring out some strong and tasty characteristics. Luckily I have some more to see how it develops overtime. (4/5)"
""
"O- Well balanced, I typically expect Flanders styles to have less carbonation and more of that ""old"" aroma and flavor, however this would be very good in the summer."
""
""
""
"Watery light body."
""
""
""
"I'm not usually a fan of overly acidic Oud Bruins so this is right up my alley. Nice sweetness balanced by just a hint of tart and vinegar. Definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Too me it was more of a quad than a sour, the tartness needed to be kicked up to where it was at least rather noticeable."
""
""
""
"Has a distinctive malt foundation which goes side by side with slightly sour, fermented grapes. Acidity remains restrained, adding a gentle, tingling bite to the fruit, while a dry citraic note enhances the brews complexity. Then, earthy, musty malts take over, while a sweet note of fruit sugar and toffee gets introduced. This maltiness overpowers the much more interesting sour aspect of the beer, leading to a smooth mouthfeel, which finishes very soft, with an underlying earthy sweetness. Nose basically reflects the taste, this is a little too honest for a Flanders Red Ale. While the heavy malts focus by itself could actually lead to an interesting new interpretation of this style, it has to interact properly with the sour, fruity ingredients to create an exiting complexity."

"Bottle as an extra in trade. Thanks! Pours murky amber orange with a big fluffy off white head. Aroma of fresh red apples, a bit of cherry, very sweet, a bit of barnyard funk. Flavor is super metallic, some lightly tart apples in the backdrop with some sweetness from the malts. But good lord this is like chewing on aluminum foil. Medium bodied, medium plus carbonation. A rare miss from New Glarus on this one. Bad bottle maybe?"

"Well, New Glarus has made sours & fruit beers (sometimes both at once) that are vastly superior to this beer. Kind of like trying in vain to watch the remake of Footlooseâ€¦no, I take that back, & issue a public apology to New Glarus for that horrid insult. Still, pretty good."
""
""
""
"O - I believe this is my first of this style (at least a full beer) Not my favorite but enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the first shot at the Oud Bruin style and I have to say I think I picked a great sample."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"t/m/o - follows the nose with an overripe dark cherry. Sour and gushing.  Soft odd metallic thing on the finish, but other than that a very sour cherry soda type of a beer. A bit fizzy, but enjoyable. Happy to have a bottle vs a 6er, but wouldn't mind another or two."
""
""
""
""
"Hazy copper brown body with a soapy, off-white head. Aromas of sweet fruit, malt, vanilla, cherry. Silky smooth and mildly sweet. Cherry and vanilla flavors with distant notes of vanilla, apple and oak. An interesting and unorthodox take on the oud bruin style."
""
"O: I like acid so this went down way too quickly. I look forward to trying my additional bottles with a bit of cellar age"
"Great sour taste to start. I would rate this higher if not for the metallic aftertaste. I will admit this is the first beer of this style I have tried so maybe I am just being naive here."
""
""
"Medium amber brown body with a generous lasting head. Aroma is sour fruitiness with a hint of spice. Mmm, tastes good. Nice tart flavor with some toffee hints. Little zip of salt like feeling on my tongue. Very delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Poured with a nice cream colored long-lasting foamy head with plenty of lace and a slightly hazy dark amber color. Aroma is a nice heady mix of tart fruit spice malt Caramel. Flavor is not quite as rich as the aroma and is dominated by the tartness of both the wild yeast and carbonic tang. I wouldn't think that it has a high alcohol but it does have a pronounced boozy warmth. Nice beer & would be great to cook with too."

"O) This beer has steadily grown on me since my first bottle back in July. Not in the same class as the Wild Sour Ale from last summer, but still really good. I think a little age will help too. In any case, I'm pretty stoked about what's in the works in that Wild Fruit Cave."

"Billowing head, one of the creamiest, most dense I've seen. Aroma is surprisingly floral and herbal, with a promise of sourness. Flavor delivers on that promise, with sharp acetic notes, puckering, and a lactic bite, carrying into a dry, oaky, lightly bitter finish. Very complex character that is still developing. Should age well. Develops a soft cherry character as it warms."
""
""
""
"Pour is cloudy dark brown with a tight tan head and solid lacing.  Nose is dry oak up front with a hint of vanilla.  Faint toffee, some fleshy tart cherry, hints of vinegar, not super bright.  Taste is a bit vinegary, oak is muted, more tart cherries, vinegar in the back.  Flavors are a bit muted and not pulled together all to well.  Well carbonated and a lighter body.  At least it isn't really acetic which a lot of flanders red's get to be."

"O-this is a thumbprint series and I always search for new ones on my beer adventures. Despite the price of a four pack. I will buy this one again. I like the tartness and dryness. It has a sweetness to it.  Drink fresh. Support your local breweries ."
""
""
"Creamy throughout, the finish comes way of malt richness that imposes over that of dryness or souring agents. Even for the reserved brown ale, the tang found here is incredibly soft- an unfailing choice for those seeking favor in the sour ale families."

"Overall - For all the hype, I am a little disappointed. The metallic taste keeps this from being a really good beer."
""
"Overall: A very good take on a Bruin. Good mix of fruit notes and spices. Kind of like a cross between a Dubbel and Sour Ale."
""

"O~ I love it! Super excited this is going to be the base of most fruit beers! The slight sweetness will blend great with any added fruit! Being a home brewer myself I wish I could come up with such a great ""base"" beer to add all kinds of goodies to! Great Job Dan!"

"Overall - I can't claim to know much about sour ales, but this one doesn't seem to hit the categorical marks. It any event, the flavor's a little one-note and a little thin."
""
""
""
"Overall - I was the only person in the group who really liked this. Light, flavorful, and drinkable sour beer."
""
""
""
"O. Not one of NG's better sour efforts but still drinkable and refreshing. I will likely be buying Berliner Weisse until it is gone instead of Oud Bruin if I am looking for a NG sour fix."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely on the milder side acidity-wise for an Oud Bruin, which makes it very drinkable. I would prefer a little more acetic action here but this is pretty nice."
"O - Glad to see the wild fruit cave making an appearance in New Glarus! I enjoyed this beer and thought it was very drinkable, but I didn't taste or smell the complexity yet. I'll wait a few months before I try my next one and see how it's evolving. Glad I bought enough of these to try one every few months over the next couple of years. Prost!"

"Pours a deep brown with decent clarity and generous whitish tan head. Plenty of lacing involved. The nose starts with some green apple and some wild components. Some tangy lacto character along with rich malts which bring on some mild woodiness and a hint of caramel. Some faint cherry in the background as well. This brew isn't very aromatic, the nose is quite delicate. Taste is fruity up front with more green apple and cherry with hints towards tartness but no real sour bite. The fruit character gives way to a pretty complex malt bill. The finish throws me off a bit. I don't want to call it metallic but it seems to head in that direction. Something just isn't jiving on the finish. Hopefully this is something that could develop with age into a cleaner finish. Mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation for the style. Overall, I was really hoping for better things with this brew. This beer is still a great value, but it just is a little on the mild side."

"Pours a deep unfiltered brownish copper hue with a fat tan head that lingers with massive amounts of lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, fruity and slightly acetic. Flavor is rich and malty up front , giving way to tart grapes and wonderful woody flavors that linger on the palate with nice mouth puckering sourness on the finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, extremely dry and effervescent. Overall delicious summer time beer and a great representation of the style. Definitely better as it warms and opens up a bit. Could see this cellaring well."

"This pours a dark amber color with a fizzy beige head. The aroma is malty and slightly sour. The taste is slightly sour and complex with flavors. The after taste leaves a lingering sour apple flavor. A rather tasty and unique brew as is everything that New Glarus makes."

"I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed in this newest offering from New Glarus. It's in no way bad. As a matter of fact, the flavors that are there are good, just mild beyond recognition. The finish is nearly nonexistent. I had very high hopes for this beer, especially considering it's the first release from their fruit cave. I assume they're just working out the kinks. Into the basement the rest of these go for sometime down the line."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very complex beer, both tart and sweet, it starts out with soft toffee notes and finishes with a malty backbone which includes wisconsin, british, and German malts. It is spontaneously fermented on oak in the cave and contains Hallertau hops. The hops and malts elegantly support sparkling fruit notes that end with a smooth oaky finish."
""

""

"I do prefer both Enigma and Wild Sour Ale, but beating those two would be damn near impossible!"
""
""

""

""
"O: The beer is full of subtle nuances and great flavors and still very refreshing. Not super sour so it may not get the fan fair, but this is a great beer."
""
"Overall: I like it, but I'm curious how it'll taste with a little age to it."
"O - A very nice Oud Bruin style that I will have difficulty in not consuming my entire case as I want to see how these develop in the bottle."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer. Based on what I read in the OCtB, this beer seems to have been brewed exactly to style. However, I would really have loved for this to be a bit more sour. I was hoping it would evolve into a more sour brew over time, but that hope was dashed when I learned the beer had been flash pasteurized. Although this beer is certainly decent, it makes me a bit nervous to think that this may be the base for all the fruited sours coming out of the wild sour cave. I was expecting another home run, and instead I would say this is a solid double."
""
""
"This is very interesting. I was sort of expecting a crisp, refreshing, bright sour like Wild Sour, but this is different; this isn't mostly tart sourness delight, it's sourness on top of malt on top of floral hops, blended with oak. This is masterfully done and to say it's ""complex"" is an understatement. I can't wait to see how this one ages."
"Overall: another outstanding example from New Glarus. Love how an outstanding beer like this is easily accessible in Wisconsin."

"Oud Bruin #49"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Kind of a precious beer. Sour on the nose, sweet, sour, and bitter on the palate. The process for making this amazes me- open resting in the coolship followed by spontaneous fermentation in oak barrels. An amazing array of flavors from such a simple process. Does mellow as it warms. Will definitely buy more to both enjoy fresh on cool summer nights and age for a few years. This will probably taste great around Christmas time."
""
""
"O- Pretty good. Complex on the nose and palate, but the finish leaves a bit to be desired. I'd say it's kind of what I'd imagine a sweeter Rodenbach to taste like though I can't say for sure since I don't have a bottle to open side-by-side right now. Still, I'd have to say I definitely prefer Enigma and Wild Sour Ale to this one."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great job, Dan Carey and team, congratulations on making yet another great beer, and on the great addition to your brewery."
""
"O - New Glarus continues to impress with it's sour program, creating a Belgian-style Oud Bruin that mimics some of the classics almost to a T. Malt forward, this brew has a light sweetness carrying through the whole flavor profile that's perfectly cut by the delicate tartness this style is known for. Dark fruits, oak barrel, and distressed leather give the beer deep complexity while it's lighter body makes for an easily drinkable brew that can be explored pint after pint."
