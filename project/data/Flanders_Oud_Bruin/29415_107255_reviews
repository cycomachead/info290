"Altogether an interesting and fruity beer that gets lost in the cloying sweet flavors."

"Good beer, but I don't think I could drink very much. Kinda like burnt cherries"
"I'd had this beer a couple of times on tap and not been very impressed.  It is a ""project"" beer.  You need to sit down with it and give it an hour or two.  Do that, and you won't be disappointed."
"375ml bottle shared during #bottlecherwednesday at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Poured into tulip. Beer is clear dark amber with a tall khaki head that quickly collapses to nothing. Aroma is citrus, oak, spice, dried fruit, and brett funk. Taste is tart/sweet citrus and dried fruit, woody/nutty bitterness, and just a touch of bourbon heat. Medium bodied, creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a long drying, warming finish."
"The complexity of this beer is amazing"

"O- This just did not come together for me. The booziness was a little harsh and the astringency was too much for me. I was able to finish my glass, but nothing I would get again."
