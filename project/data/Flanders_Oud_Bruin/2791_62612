4.52,35.7,3.75,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,"The reviews are low from others, probably due to them not aging this beer. Age it! If I had this beer without the age, I'd probably be with the 2.9 score crowd.

In the taste, malty, slightly sweet, with a veritable underground of sourness. Brown sugar like sweetness, mildly tart, and somewhat malty. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety. Overall, a nice flanders brown ale and a solid session change of pace brew.","Stinkypuss","Sep 11, 2011"
3.53,6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: This is not a bad beer but not what I would hope for in this style. There are enough other, better and available beers in this style that are more satisfying. I wouldn't buy it again.","meatyard","Sep 10, 2011"
3.78,13.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"750ml bottle, no cork, just an usual cap. Dark brwon colour, with beatiful reddish hints to the light. Good beige creamy head with lace.

3.58,7.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer was cola colored with a bubbly tan head. It smells like sour cherry cola with just a hint of sweet malt and oak. The taste is a little more complex with sweet cola, black cherry, molasses and a tart finish. The beer is lighter than it looks with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. I thought this was a good and interesting beer, proof that you can't trust all overall ratings on here.","JMad","Jul 14, 2011"
3.36,0.9,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Not bad for the style, but certainly not anything to write home about. While the malts are nicely balanced with the tartness (lots of prune and grape right up front with sour cherry and sweet malty backbone) the flavor overall is a little thin. That's really the only major complaint--the sweetness and maltiness seem so balanced because there's really no dominant flavor in the beer. Similar to a slightly watery Petrus Oud Bruin, but with dissipated complexity. Nevertheless, it's always nice to be drinking a barrel-aged Belgian.","TheNapkin","Jun 26, 2011"

3.06,-8.1,4,3,3,3,3,"I bought this because it was a ""brown ale"" and english and/or american brown ales I typically like. However this is hardly a brown ale in either of the sense of those two types. It says ""belgian"" brown ale on the bottle, and it's clasified aas flanders oud bruin....not sure on all these other names- I am from the united states. Just didn't taste good to me, tasted sour and there was little other flavor to it. Very one note on this one, which was a bad note unless you like sour though I think this might be because of the style...however I still believe they should have labeled this something else which is why I am writing a review...if you like browns...you probably wont like this.","liveandletdie","Apr 24, 2011"
3.98,19.5,4,3.5,4,5,4,"P.S. reading up, I see that this is a unique beer produced by mixing a lambic with a ""high fermentation brown ale"" (""infusion of Lambic"") which is then aged for 6 months in oak barrels","chinchill","Apr 23, 2011"
3.46,3.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Nothing spectacular, but certainly something I'd get again when I have a sweet tooth or need something mild. Plus, because of the fairly low octane, it's a nice item at Belgian restaurants when you're driving, too.","Domingo","Apr 15, 2011"
3,-9.9,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer pours a dark brown color with a cream-colored head. The aroma consists of some toffee malt but nothing else. The flavor is toffee malt with some light cherry notes and some brown sugar. I get no sourness or not tartness. Disappointing. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing really interesting with this beer and not really worth seeking out unless you just need the tick.","Mora2000","Mar 04, 2011"
2.46,-26.1,4,3,2,2,2.5,"The appearance of this beer is a deep brown color with a very slight white head. The smell is of a candied sour cherry...it's not exactly a beer smell. The taste is similar...the sourness is there, but a little muted, and the sweetness seems to take a lot more from sugar than from malt. Thin and a little watery in body, with a decent bitterness and sour pucker at the finish. All in all, this is a real dismantlement for the style.","Suds","Feb 28, 2011"
2.61,-21.6,4,3,2.5,2.5,2,"D- This is a interesting take on the style. A little more carbonated than what I am use to.

Average at best...well maybe a little under average.","alleykatking","Feb 12, 2011"

2.98,-10.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"This beer pours a nice deep reddish to cedar colour. Off white head with decent lacing. The smell is of cherries and some bready malt, noticeable Belgian yeast. The taste starts off sour cherries to me and finishes with a sweet candied sugar malt. I pick up a metallic like taste about mid palate, not sure what that's about. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and semi dry. This would be a good introductory sour.","OakedCanuck","Jan 16, 2011"
2.9,-12.9,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"11.2 ounce bottle, bottled on 05/10/10. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with some hints of ruby red, and has about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is cherries (both sweet and tart), oak, and some vinegar. The taste is kinda like the aroma, but the taste is more sweet than tart (and not a good sweet taste), and there's also a weird off-flavor that I can't tell exactly what it is. It's not awful, but it's not exactly good, either. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's watery and has decent carbonation. Drinkability is average. Didn't really care for this brew, it's just not for me I guess.","bluejacket74","Jan 15, 2011"
3.11,-6.6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"12oz bottle that I believe was $3.79. Dark brown color, a little head. This smelled a little sweet and tasted slightly sweet as well. One dimensional and honestly the most boring oud bruin that I have had the misfortune of purchasing. I will not be buying any of the timmerman's lambics as I assume I will be equally disappointed.","ArrogantB","Jan 01, 2011"
3.33,0,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"M + D: I didn't find this to be all that bad, but I would probably be more likely to reach for Monk's Cafe, Duchesse, Rodenbach, etc... if I were looking for the style. I would be very open to trying another in regards to the flavour profile, though, as it seems very unusual.","Proteus93","Dec 20, 2010"
3.6,8.1,3.5,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,"D: The beer is rather easy to drink and goes down smoothly. I would consider it to be sessionable if it had a little more sourness to balance out the sweet flavors.","metter98","Nov 26, 2010"
3.05,-8.4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Notes - When I first saw this beer, I was hoping I finally found a replacement for Goudenband. It's no Goudenband, though. Though reasonably tasty, it isn't very complex, and in my opinion isn't sour enough. It may be useful for someone who's trying to ease into sours, but I can't recommend it otherwise.","Fnord","Nov 14, 2010"
1.77,-46.8,4,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,"The flavor is sweet, no sign of funk, rather pedestrian. This is a beginners bruin, as a seasoned drinker, I don't even recognize this as an Oud Bruin, more like a Belgian amber ala Biere du Boucaneer.","crossovert","Nov 06, 2010"
2.43,-27,4,3.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,"We feel the Oud bruin nose, that is to say, tannins and fruit with a touch more style caramelized cinnamon biscuit. The problem is that the mouth is too yeasted and that input is far too timid and unobtrusive compared to its big sisters like Goudenband, especially acidity here is far from sharp, almost to the limit the non-existent. Looks like a mix between a beast and a brown Belgian oud bruin low quality. The taste of tannin is also rejected by the addition of a dye unpleasant. In the end, even the finish is below with a taste between toasted malt and the dye. What a shame.","ThaCreep","Nov 05, 2010"
