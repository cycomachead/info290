Taste has more black cherry, light medicinal notes, chocolate covered cranberries, light tartness but a sweet Flanders Red-esque like malting. Sweet and sour, with a fuller thicker feel that appears less than 12.0%. A very drinkable Flanders Red/Oud Bruin.","liamt07","Oct 17, 2012"

Smell is sour and tart with some nice cherry and malt aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic quality on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

4.3,8.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Slick on the palate, but light enough in texture from the low residual sugars, this is pretty much spot on in my eyes. While it could use more carbonation, the lack thereof does not really detract from the feel, though I do wonder if there wouldn't be a bit more complexity with some carbonation to open it up a little.

4.09,3.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D - I'm glad this is in a 12oz serving because I don't think I could drink much more. It's certainly a solid beer and provides some nice cherry notes but it's pretty thick and the finish leaves a flavor that I still can't decide if I like or not. I might pick more of this up if I had the chance so I could see how it ages.","jpmclaug","Nov 16, 2010"
3.15,-20.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Drinkability is average. There is sour cherry in this beer, so Kuhnhenn does deliver that, but in a very one dimensional way. The high ABV is somewhat noticeable and the thickness for this style also cuts down on drinkability. Not necessarily a bad beer, but with beers like Rosso E Marrone in this category, this one doesn't come close.","sisuspeed","Nov 01, 2010"

Although i must say it is a bit elixer like when it comes to the feel. For some the abv and the intense cherry richness may come off as tussin like. But its more meaty than that.

Very sweet and intense, almost thick smell. Mindblowingly intense cherry, alternating between sweet and sour on the palate, with the sweetness eventually getting the upper hand and winning out. There's also an interesting fruit vinegar quality to this beer, along with a slight funk and touch of caramel. Slightly boozy.

4.34,9.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured right down into the center of the glass from six inches above and still no head, no lacing either. Deep muddy brown colored liquid, like you'd expect to find catfish swimming around the bottom of the glass, sort of yellows around the rims, curiously lots of visible bubbles inside yet no head. Sour pie of wild cherries, not the type of sweeter cherries you get in the store, you even get the flakes of hard crust, baking spices and a light blood orange infusion, before it's gone you get a damp kind of forest floor vegetation, that said, it's all about the cherries. Very full-bodied, dense and muscular mouth presence, the carbonation adds a tight tickle to stir the pot ever so slowly. Comes close to identically replicating the nose, those sour cherries have a golden honey dappled flakiness, haphazard flourishes of vanilla bean, ginger and chamomile. Here you get more white grapefruit than orange, takes the pucker factor to "eleven." Not as earthy or green as in the nose. Most effective when warmed up some, gains staying power in both the nose and palate. Admirable clarity of purpose here.","farrago","Apr 20, 2010"

Some tart cherry and raspberry in the background, providing nice contrast to the sweeter flavors (sugary cherries and strawberries). Slightly medicinal and warming. Nice bite of tartness near the finish. Finish dries out a bit (woody), with the lingering tartness. Some fruitiness sweetness also sticks around. Warming and strong, but drinks more like 8-9%.
