"Ive been lucky enough to have 2008, 10 and 12 and this is beer is perfect."
"It was okay .But for the style it fell short."
"Probably works for most...just not in my wheel house."
""
""
""
""
"Go Deschutes."
""

"O:  A solid beer, overall.  I'd like a bit more carbonation and balance, but overall is enjoyable."
""
"Abyss had recently disappointed me, so I was a bit skeptical about this beer, but it exceeded my expectations and then some. It's fantastic. An excellent---to my thinking and tastes--- oud bruin-style beer."
""
""
""
""
"2014 reserve version.  Great sour brown with red fruit, biscuit, yeast, leather and earthy notes.  Somewhat dry finish from the oak.  Will benefit from another year."
""
""
"A rather pleasant and engaging wood-treated version of the style - it's not going to challenge Rodenbach or the Duchesse, but instead sit next to them in the limited pantheon of sour Flemish ales available around here.  Fruity, certainly, and yet balanced, especially when it comes to addressing that elephant kicking back in the middle of the room (no, I'm not seeing things) - yeah, the 21+ proof booze is really hard to come by, it would seem."

"2012 vintage. Nice cherry and acidic fruit notes. Deep and complex. Glad I waited a couple of years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't see this as the style it's described as.  More pinot flavor than anything, not much acidity or tartness. I'll revisit this again after the best after date."
"2012 vintage aged at 53 F since purchase. Consumed 2/21/15. Sublime."
"Looks and smells the part but boozy/bitter city with slight tart and slight cherry. Nothing to write home over.  2014 vintage but didn't wait until ""enjoy after date."" compared to befuddlement this is literally bland and more like a red ale. Not a sour..."
""
""
""
""
"So glad this will be an annual release now. Opened a 2014 bottle and it was everything I remember from 5 years ago, and more. Truly special beer."
""
""
"Finally after years on my wants list,got one in shoprite fairless hills."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice tart beer with notable wine characteristics.  A bit of diacetyl on the flavor was slightly off-putting but it had plenty of other positive notes to offset that.  This had a best after date of about 9 months in the future so I'm looking forward to cracking open my 2 other bottles down the road."

"So close to being so awesome. Needs a little more pucker, more...something. I liked it, but I think it needs more, I don;t know, time? Sourness? I really like the cherry flavor. I enjoyed this beer but I think it needs something more to make it memorable."
"Golden Amber beer with thin soapy head and great clarity.  Some burnt sugars, sour cherry, fruit salad, pineapple, tangerine with a slick oily mouthfeel."
""
"For the price I paid, and the ABV, and the style... this beer, ale, sour, wine like drink.. is surprisingly... quaffable. Yet, the next time you bring it to your lips, you want to savor it. Worth the price? Depends on your curiosity. I'm not a rich man and I can say I'm happy I bought this."
""
""
""
"O: This is my favorite Descutes beer and consistent at that. I can see gains with age but it's not hot now like a fresh abyss. Way better than abyss and not carrying that hype. Its a great take on a flanders oude bruin"
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly phenolic flavor. Wish it were more sour."
""
"Really enjoyable interesting beer. Not overly sour and alot going on with aroma and on the palate. Drinks just about as easy as the lower ABV brothers of this style. I'll drink this over Abyss any day. A great beer from Deschutes!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2014. Maybe it needs some age. No real tartness for me on this. Cherries come through nice as does the wine barrel. Just not my style at this point"
""
""
""
""
""
"Big wine character in the taste. The aroma leads with big cherry notes, and in the taste you  get some cherry in the front, and a slight puckering effect at the end. I know this gets better with age.."
""
""
"This has a complex yet cohesive profile. The wild blend opens the pallet to the tart, fruit cherry and closes with a suddle, dry flavor of the oak barrels. I enjoyed the 2014 reserve and would gladly buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A whole lot of wine shines here even though on 35% of it sits in pinot noir barrels. Not enough cherry as expected. Beautiful deep red and brown with a very light cream color head. A bit heavy in the nought and lingers forever in the back. Very good but was hoping for something more from the barrel and the cherries."
"Shared (2) bottles of 2012 vintage at a local pub."
""
""
"If you like the more fruity element drink fresh. If you don't mind losing a little fresh fruit to get some more flavors and rounded out beer go for 2 years. I had the 2010 reserve when buying the 2014 and thought it had fallen off considerably."

"Overall (4.25), a really nice take on the style, with the cherries giving it a bit of a kriek feel, but a bit sweeter from the base beer than you'd get from a kriek. Probably my favorite individual beer of the group of beers that make up Collage."
""

"O: An excellent sour, recommended to any fans of any of the sour beer styles. One of Deschutes best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good sour beer. Not lip-puckering sour but very drinkable. The aroma gives off a bourbon hint but the beer was not aged in bourbon barrels and each taste is a little surprise with the different flavors in the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an incredible beer. Highly recommended. Want to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The more I drink this, the more I like it. The level of complexity in the flavor is impressive, and the feel is a perfect complement. An excellent, robust sour."

"O - This was good, but I didn't like as much as most. A bit too much red wine and the cherry flavor was medicinal for me. Good, but not exceptional."
""
""
"Russian River Supplication has been surpassed. This is masterful. Will have to grab more than one bottle the next time they release."
""
""
""

"I've really been looking forward to trying this beer and it didn't disappoint! Super complex and balanced. Very well done, Deschutes. 4 years has done wonders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol is decently hidden, but still shines through as something that is quite big. 11% is not a huge surprise however. I prefer the beers in the style to be less alcoholic and more refreshing. Still a wonderfully complex and delicious beer."

"Hazed red colour, ring of off white head, not much in the way of lace either. Smell is full of cherry and oak, vinious and fruity, red berry, alcohol at points and some malt/wheat as well. Taste is of cherry but also fairly malty before getting to oak and tart fruits, drying sour berry with a bit of alcohol flavours on the back end. Medium drying carbonation, medium body. Quite good, but I feel this would benefit from a bit more time but would have it again gladly anytime."

"O-A nice effort. This brew is quite drinkable for 11.4% ABV. I originally was hoping for more tart flavors, but after about two sips, I started to really enjoy the less sweet (for the style) malt-forward character. It is complex and balanced and the taste really grew on me. I'm not sure what food this would pair with, but it drank well on its own after dinner. This is a great (and powerful) take on the style."
""
"Like The Abyss, this is a testament to making a complex 11% beer very subtle. Low-end sourness and acidity sets this apart some for the style and lets the wine barrel show through a bit more."
""
"Authentic Flanders fruit vinegar feel mixed with nice Belgian yeast spice and some good darker sugar flavors. Like the wine grape and oak complexity. ABV is also non-existent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I rather liked this brew and would love to try an aged bottle or other vintages, in all honesty the only reason this one made it past its best after date is I forgot I had one"
""
""
"O- Apart from the feel, which was just above average, this was an outstanding beer. Glad I waited to drink it. ...although I wonder what it would be like fresh."
""
""
"Overall: Better color, development of legs, oak and wine coming through much stronger on nose and taste, sweeter finish, better feel. Has definitely improved through the aging and very nicely, can't wait to get more this year, I'll re review a third time when I open the third"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Incredibly flavourful with a high voltage ABV that goes completely undetected. A true privilege to have had the chance to enjoy it, and an even more stoked to share it with my BA bro in crime."
""
""
"O - a true original, so tasty and easy drinking, a must try for any beer advocate"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really good if not a little overly acidic for me. I find it so powerful that it has to be a special occasion beer - it lacks the accessibility of some of the less potent sour cherry ales, but accessible is not something it's going for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is one knockout of a sour but it's so subtle in its execution. A slow sipper but every one is a delight."
"O: awesome appearance and awesome aroma. But it immensely lacks in balance, taste and mouthfeel. Very happy to split this bottle with one other person."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty tasty brew, and getting better as it warms. Sweet, but not overdone. Much lighter tasting than the alcohol would lead you to believe. Since I'm completely dumfounded here, I'll guess its so sort of American Barleywine, but I don't feel confident about it."
""
""
"A very enjoyable beer, even if its a month before its ""best after"" date."

""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but nothing to recommend this."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a cloudy, syrupy looking auburn with no head or carbonation. The nose is a tad tart, sweet with notes of raisin and candi sugar, masked booze, and no bitterness. The taste is definitely modestly tart, sweet, a touch of cherry and raisin in the finish, no bitterness. The mouthfeel is sweet upfront, slightly tart, no bitterness, and only very slightly dry finish. This beer is excellent and almost like a rodenbach on steroids..."
"O: This is a darn good boozy, oaky, and tart beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, bubbly and dry on the tongue. A top tier Flanders Oud Bruin with a decent balance between the higher abv and fairly aggressive dark sourness."

"This poured out as a brownish red color with a white head on top. The soapy looking head fades and leaves a ring of foam around the edge. The smell of the beer is tart on the nose some really nice cherry aromas. The taste of the beer is tart and sour. There is some sweetness in tere as well that is a little on the syrupy side. The mouthfeel of the beer is nicely carbonated with a medium body to it. Overall this beer is pretty good. I feel it could be a little more sour. It's still a pretty good brew."

"There's some interesting things going on here, but first sip was a bit of a strange shock and quite odd. It does have some good qualities to it and a future visit might be in the cards, but by no means my favorite bruin at all. Strange aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Obviously I'm in a festive mood. Happy 500 everybody!"
"This is definitely a nice treat, and at 11% it should be treated as such. It's not as sour as the aroma would suggest, which makes me want to age the second bottle for a couple years."
""
"O - Overall, this was a tasty beer from Deschutes. Wish it was more sour but it was still worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall while I thought that this was a pretty good beer, to me it seemed like a lesser version of Supplication by RR. Still good just not great."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A decent Flander’s Red from Deschutes, lacking in complexity and subtlety as the harsh sour and vinegar qualities really dominate this beer at times. I’m left wishing the cherry flavors came across as fresh fruit rather than dried as they never really pop. My one praise is that you would never know it’s 11.4% as the alcohol is artfully hidden."

"From notes, 12/9/10. Pours a brownish red color with a somewhat fizzy head, beige. Head dissipates quickly. It might be starting to thin out a bit, but this beer is still quite good. Lots of fruit - sour cherries and berries. Some vinegar and acid. Medium sour. Soft feel. A very good beer, though not quite up to the best of this wonderful style. Edit: 2010 version. Draft. Very good, again. Much more funky oak flavor than I remember from the last batch. Very woody dry. Sort of a cheesy flavor. Sour cherries are delicious and don’t overwhelm. Refined and complex. Full mouthfeel. The mouthfeel of Dissident is noticeably best from a fresh keg, in my opinion. Not too sour yet. Edit 2012: My opinion on Dissident has gone done somewhat. It seems a bit too sweet and the flavor is muddier than I remember. I'll revisit this review again at some point, but I'm lowering my scores for now."

"Got a bottle at Tacoma Boys. Says 2012 on the label. Cool packaging with the Makers Mark style wax covering, but was kind of a pain in the ass to open. Aromas of vinegar. Very sharp and sour fragrance. Amber orange in color with a tan head that doesn't sustain very long, but leaves nice lace on top. Can tell it's highly carbonated as it look and sounds explosive. Wow. This is a bomb to the palate. Heavy alcohol notes. Very tart and light sourness. The alcohol has an immediate warming effect. Fruity, sour apple and cherry flavors. Alot of red wine in the mix as well. I don't care for the aftertaste. It's very metallic and just off somehow. Too bad. Maybe not as carbonated as it looks at first but I think it lost alot of it sitting in the glass. Very interesting beer and I love the primary flavor, just don't like the finish."

"O: This was very enjoyable, but I can't wait to see what happens over the next year or so. At present it just doesn't have the depth of flavor I'm looking for and expecting, but I was so far before the ""best after"" date...I have high hopes."
""
""
"O: I've never had a beer like this and I don't know if I ever will again. I only had enough money for one bottle, and I may let that stand as the greatest beer where I've only had money for 1 bottle."
""
"O: Another A grade beer from Deschutes. Fire."
"M - Medium body; creamy. Light carbonation."
"Lovely stuff."
"O: this bottle is 9months shy of its best after date so it needs a little age. It is kinda harsh but where it is going is fantastic. Can mostly taste the sour not much maltyness."
"Overall. Nice (and big) Flanders style sour with a good amount of fruit flavour. Anxious to try the 3 bi-year vertical in the cellar now."
"High B"
"Great beer."

"O: Pretty good, not a sour as I'd hoped, but really like how the oak comes through and how forward the vanilla is. Excited to give it a try after the best by date."
"Overall: This is the best American take on the Oud Bruin style I've had. It is delicious and well balanced at this age, though I wonder how it was after a year. I enjoy the prominent acidity, so I definitely want to hold onto a 2012 or two to have in 2016."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass, 2012 version, best after 8/20/13. This pours a slightly cloudy reddish brown color with a fizzy tan head which fizzes away to a little film. The smells are great, you get some obvious sour notes, vinegar, a load of cherries, some barnyard funk, some white grape, some obvious alcohol. The feel is medium. The taste is amazing, Deschutes knows how to make a beer, you get some bitterness, a little brett, some sour notes, vinegar, some cherries, the alcohol is also present though and a little age wouldn't hurt this."
"O: Deschutes does it again! Man this is one bad ass beer that instantly becomes one of my favorites of all time. I can't wait to try this beer after the ""Best After"" date"
""
"Cheers."
""
"Overall, a damn fine sour beer. A couple years back I took a chance on this when I saw it on tap and I was both surprised by and impressed with this beer. This beer certainly opened my eyes to a portion of the beer world I had been missing out on and it remains my favorite Oud Bruin of those that I've tried."
""
""
"Overall: Such a well balanced Flanders Oud Bruin, especially for its strength. I could drink this one all night. The cherries used in brewing definitely come out and add to this beer. This is definitely a beer to savor, it is delicious and gets even better as it warms, after opening."
"O- wish I would have had this a year or so ago. Not sure how this is fresh but I think this beer is well past it's peak."
"Wow. This is one amazing beer. The taste is so far from what a typical beer is, but at the same time there is no doubt that this is a beer. There are so many tastes and flavors that I can't pick anything out to describe. I drank from a bottle so I don't know what it's appearance is like. This is not just another craft beer that tastes like just hops. This is beer art. Conceptual art applied to beer. Beer taken to an extreme that makes it something else but still keeping with the primacy of what beer is. This is my favorite beer. Sadly, I have moved from the west coast and I can't find anything from Oregon. I even love the packaging, it's art also."
""
"Overall: A really great Belgian style sour. Big fruity wine like flavors while the acidity and sourness is kept in check. Very complex and good tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It was decent, but I was a little bit dissapointed by this beer. I think I need to try a fresh bottle to give it a fair shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer that I suspect will improve with some age. I have a feeling Deschute's ""best after date"" is really appropriate for this one."
"Pours caramel with a slight amber hue and a small khaki head. Smells lacto sour, brown sugar, cherries and apples, a slight hint of some vanilla and the wine barrels. Some alcohol in the finish. Amazing flavor and quite complex. Some sour lacto, tart cherries, apple, a little funky, the barrels, and some leather. I expected more alcohol to be noticeable than there actually was which was a nice surprise. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, a really nice beer even 11 months prior to its best after date, I can only imagine how good it will be then."
"Pours amber with a cherry hue, etched surface with a rim of light cream foam. The smell was evident from a couple feet upon pouring - really richly cherry this year. There are notes of lacto, breat and oak with plenty of the wine character coming through and lots of nice, tart cherries. The flavor is tart up front with a bit of heat and plenty of cherry flavor. This is really remarkable in that it is very, very fruit forward and most in the style that I've had are more oak balanced. I think I prefer this approach. The tartness is not quite sour per se, but is richly enhancing the overall tone of the beer. There is much, much less wood and grain perceived this year than 2010 when fresh. Medium on light syrup body with limited, soft and fine carb with a watering finish. Nice beer. I am really glad I got a good stash of this vintage."
""
""
""
"Overall: A great beer to be sure, but I'm not blown away by it like I was hoping to be. Perhaps is as good as it's supposed to be and I've only grown as an Advocate. I would love to have it again and again. I almost wish I would have drank it fresher to see if there would have been a difference, but I don't feel that it lost too much based upon reviews I've read."
""
"O: Definitely a good beer and well worth the $13. Hopefully some age will bring out some more sour notes. It smells great, but the taste was not as puckering as I'd hoped it would be. Still an excellent beer!"
"I have a lot of mixed emotions about this beer. Its smells wonderfully of cherry, and the nose on it is very complex. Whispers of alcohol permeate from the snifter I am using. The faint foamy head dissipates quickly. My first drink into this beer tells me this moment is going to be quite awkward. My palate has cherry, oak, sweet caramel and a flush of acidity almost like a deep red wine such as a shiraz. It seems to be lacking of carbonation and has almost medicinal qualities. While I am not found of this beer I can appreciate the creativity and artistry it takes to develop a product such as this."
""
"Best After 8/20/13. Pours a hazy reddish amber with a red tinged bubbly head that dissipates quickly. Nose is tart cherries, pinot noir, woody, slight vanilla, French oak (you can actually smell the difference between French and American oak), black plums, dark fruit and some spice notes. Taste is cherries, grapes, green apples, oak, plums, red wine, booze and a bit of some kind of spice, maybe cinnamon or clove. Something with a kick. This was the first sour ale I ever tried (the 2010 vintage) and it blew my mind. Its just as good as I remember. I'm psyched about the two I have put away til after 8/30/13. Its a long wait but it'll be worth it. I can definitely taste the parts of this that were in that Collage I had last night. Deschutes rules."
"M: Medium bodied. But feels fuller because of slight lack of carbonation. Maybe some time in bottle with help that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a fantastic sour filled with vinous and berry notes with some citric notes creeping in. Big and just a little oaky, this one will age with the best of them. Can't wait to see how it develops after a year or two. Buy several. Drink one and cellar the rest."
"just one of those classics for me. it looks a little thin, light brown color with a red hue to it. good carbonation is obvious, as a fizzy white head rises up. the nose is intense. lots of red wine vibes, although this isnt barrel aged in vino. also lots of sour in the aroma. brett and lacto at least, but this isnt acidic. there is some sweetness in the flavor from the malt, and that red fruit tone again. maybe something tart in fruit, like cranberries or something. more red wine tannins in the finish, and a puckery sour. the alcohol is well hidden, a superbly dirnkable bottle. medium body in the end, and bold carbonation just short of pop like. its expensive and rare, but it is just a beer that you need to seek out. its hard to describe because it stands alone. a sour yes, but its so much more than that. one of the more complex bottles of beer around."
"Awesome, awesome, awesome. I love this beer, a huge fan of wild ales and this is a wild ale that got dressed up and headed out to a formal affair. Deschutes caudled this beer and it shows. Can't wait to see how this develops with age. I have a 2010 yet to be cracked and will be laying a few of the 2012 down to try annually."
""
""
""
"O: I liked it quite a bit although not my favorite Flanders ale. I had several bottles of Collage this year and now I can see that Dissident is the most dominant smell and taste in that beer. I have another bottle to age. I will revisit after a year or so."
"O: I feel like the 2008 is a vintage not to be matched ever again. Hoping the yeast eats some of the sugars and gives this more depth. And a big warning about drinking this less than cool."

"O: very tasty and intresting beer that was very elusive for me but very happy to finally try. I definitely would love to try the 2010 version."
""
""
""
""
"I was pleasantly surprised by this. So glad it wasn't a big sour beer like I was expecting. This is actually quite drinkable, especially given the ABV. A wine-like brew. A nice change from what I usually drink and a solid overall beer."
""
"O: REALLY enjoyable beer now, beautifully aged! Still a bit bitter and 'rooty', with nice cherry tartness and spicing. Glad to have more of these in the cellar, will try not to wait too much longer before having another."
""
""
""
"Overall: Starts out challenging, but ends up very pleasing. Worth taking the trouble to seek out (though I got it more from KevSal's generosity than any effort on my part)."
""

"Fantastic. The benchmark of the style for me. Could not get enough of this."

"Dissident 2010 vintage, labeled best after 11/01/11 - reddish brown, very transparent, pretty bad head retention, but the beer glows. Big, huge cherry in the nose. Light, light funk with some faint lactic sour hints. No acetic acid. Little bit of sweet and sour candy, and a hint of oak. A fantastic smelling ale. Big sour cherry flavor hits you over the head, kinda of a rough biting sourness. Faintly reminding me of cough syrup on the finish. Very low in the funk department. Really no vinegary sourness to speak of it is more of a lactic / natural fruity sourness. A bit of a bitter quality that is off putting. But show cases a nice oud bruin charecter. Surprisingly not thin on the mouthfeel, but it is dry and vinous which is nice. Altogether while this is not my favorite take on the style it is a good interpretation. I get it, I just don't know if I'm a huge fan. I repeat though I feel Deschutes carried through on this well."
""
""
""
"Overall: If the first bottle release is better than the second, I don't think my brain could handle it. So much flavor and just enough sour and funk to keep things exciting. Loads of flavor and a great balance. Seriously Deschutes, stop being so good at things. It makes me sad that I can't get it..."

"Deschutes has an immaculate track record with me, and this is no exception. The Dissident is nicely sour and nicely balanced. I really don't understand how it was 10.50%. It could be a bit more complex, but it's still great. Nice label art, too!"
""
""
"Overall-- this is waaaay better than the 2010... This is quite a tasty beer here, I'm sad to say this is my last bottle."
"This beer pours a stained cherry wood red in color with a soapy off white lacing around the glass. The nose consists of band aids and cranberries. Despite the adjectives, it's not over the top or off putting. The flavors consist of dry, bretty, band aids with an array of pomegranate and cranberry, pretty interesting. The brett is strong in this one. It goes in between fruit and yeasty dryness. I don't think I've had this style this big and this dry before. It's an interesting drink. The alcohol is well hidden and I consider this a sipper for the style. It makes me wonder what the more recent batches are like."

"pours a copper red with a minimal head. aroma is beast, typical flanders with a strong sour cherry note. taste isnt as good, medicinal notes overpower flanders taste and sour cherries fade to the finish, i am a bit disappointed, this is not as good as i expected. off tastes effect the mouthfeel, almost puts the brakes on my tastebuds, ill take a red poppy any day over this"
"I had real high expectations for this beer. I love Deschutes, and I love sours - this HAD to be good. My expectations were probably unrealistic, but I look forward to trying the next Dissident release (early 2013 I'm hearing). I will say that RR's Consecration has spoiled me."

"O- I very much enjoyed this beer. Not overly sour, but with the right balance of sour and fruit. Wish I had another one of these to drink! Thanks Scott for this way back when."
"Love the cabernet and pinot wine flavors with very nice oak presence."
"(D)- A decent flanders, though I think it still possibly needs more time to develop better. The medicinal note became more and more prevalent as it warmed."
"O - Enjoyed this beer but I don't think it's amazing. I've had plenty of sours that bring a lot more to the table than this beer. Definitely worth a try though. If I wasn't used to drinking Russian River and Cascade sours on a semi-regular basis, I'd probably rate this beer much higher."

"Overall: This is a really good sour that could have been fantastic but there was a mild metallic note in the taste. The alcohol was almost nowhere to be found. Not sure if I would hunt down another one given the rarity."
"O: Really an enjoyable tart/sour brown."

"Taste is rich orange, cherries, flowers, and sugar sprinkled red grapefruit with a little sherry like oxidation. So very balanced. Simple and fantastic."

"Overall I wasn't sure what to expect with this one and I'm a little disappointed. It's good, and different to be sure - I'm just not blown away. Still, as always I feel fortunate to have a chance to try a fine beer from one of America's best breweries."
"O-I liked this more than I expected. Perhaps, it is not a traditional Flanders sour. IDGARA. This is brewed in America. Beer is better here. Belgium can have their classic bicycle races. But, I am all for improving Belgian beer styles and Deschutes has gone against the grain in a way that harmonizes with my soul. Well done Deschutes. Very well done."

"O- Nothing pisses me off more than putting a beer up on a pedestal and having it not live up to your expectations. This is the first time i have not liked a sour beer OR a beer by Deschutes. Tragic. FT: The Dissident ISO: Better sours"
""
"O: The Flanders Oud Bruin is quickly becoming my favorite style and this is ranked up there here on BA amongst the best of them (presently #6 in its style class here on BA). ""The Dissident"" did NOT ""Dissapoint."" [I spelled that wrong intentionally..."

"O - Not a great beer, merely okay. Had some moderately decent tastes but there was some unpleasantness on the end I didn't care for. Not super easy to drink either."
"O- I like different, but this was too different. Not the typical Oud Bruin. It did get better as it warmed, but all in all I didn't feel crazy about this. I appreciate it, but didn't really enjoy it..."

"O: good beer, I'd have it again. It's really one of my first sours, so I'm likely not capturing the intricacies of the beer."
"D - Masks the ABV pretty well. Tasty."
"Drink- Well I did it. I sat on it for 9 months and I appreciate the flavor profile in this one. It was a good sour but wasnt the most earth shattering but I am glad I waited on this one. Made it that much more enjoyable. According to Stormking47 who told me an 08 is much better. Quess I need to trade for one....damnit."
"Overall - Not as good as I was hoping. Still a good Oud Bruin, but not anywhere near as exciting as some of its counterparts."
"Deschutes The Dissident pours an opaque mahogany, and proper backlighting lightens the edges to more of a red-orange. The two pours churned up one and two fingers of very light tan foam serving as a head. Retention is minimal and lacing nonexistent, but I guess that's somewhat to be expected.The nose is heavy on cherry and dark fruits from the wine barrel aging. There's a bit of funk and a bit of tartness, but the aforementioned cherry/fruit really form the center of the aroma. The flavor allows the supporting notes to shine through a bit more. An acidity/tartness leads off and immediately grabs my tastebuds' attention. The cherry and red wine that so dominated the nose slide in and occupy things mid palate. The brett flavors finish the beer off, and it's nicely nuanced. Notes of leather and tobacco are a great way to close the beer. The mouthfeel is solid, yet unspectacular. It's not as dry as I would have expected, but still fairly well attenuated. The carbonation's not as expansive as is usually found in some other Belgian styles, but it's still active enough to let you know its there. 3 years later and this vintage of The Dissident is drinking very nicely. Another great offering from the brewery that's brought me The Abyss and Mirror Mirror."
"Overall this was a very enjoyable experience. I think the 2008 still has a way to go, so there is no need to open it any time soon. If you have access to one, have fun. I opened this with a group of friends, some of whom had never had sour beer before, and everyone had good things to say. After Abyss, this is Deschutes best bottled brew I've had."
"Not my favorite within the style. A sweet Flanders Oud Bruin, though there's also an unappealing wet cardboard flavor throughout."
"Overall: just an excellent beer. I imagine, maybe, that having a bottle with a little more carbonation might work some good here, but I'm quite satisfied indeed with my Dissident growler experience."
"O: I'm thinking this has some potential to age into something nice but I think it will take 3-5 years to do so."
"Overall: This is a very good beer, exceptional comes to mind. I'm not that experienced with the style, but I enjoyed it very much."
"2010 On-tap at Beachwood BBQ. Pours a very murky brown with a golden red tint. The head is about a finger high of off white foam with exploding pin bubbles. Pretty attractive brew. The nose is instant sour tartness up front with cherry, banana and oak aroma's following. The taste has a very pleasant slight smokiness to it and is dominated but tart fruits, mainly cherry. It has very good carbonation with a medium body, tart tingle and some heat from the alcohol. Been searching this out for awhile and I'm glad I got some."
"D - I would love to have this again and hopefully I can come across another bottle soon."
"A very nice sour, easy drinking and tart yet not over bearing. The flavors are nothing too complex, but still interesting and enjoyable."
"Had this at a tasting at Jakes 5th anneversary. Nice hazy copper color capped with a beige head that quickly fades. Smells of sour cherries and funk still after these few years. Tastes of cherries up front followed by musty horse and a barely perceptable alcohol burn. Light body and very drinkable."
"2008 bottle. Pours a clear dark cherry red with a thick head. Nose is fairly sharp, sour, citric. Pretty balanced and enjoyable, and bright. Mouth is soft, flavor profile opens with a fair amount of wine barrel and sour cherries. Sweet, sour, much darker than the nose, not as bright or citric. Acidity on the back end. Really wet and wine barrel-heavy, a quality that I don't really dig in sours. Reminds me of some 2009-2010 era McKenzie stuff. Still, this is a bit more refined, interesting, and has some nice aromatic qualities. Pretty nice."
"I still wake up from dreams prominently featuring this beer and cursing myself for not buying more!"
"O-Not the most flavorful or most sour beer out there, however the flavors mesh well and their nuanced balance is wonderful."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy sincereNC for sharing this one with the table at the ORF '11 release. 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a sampler snifter. Poured bright red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and funk. The flavor was of sweet amlt, sour, funk, tart, and dark fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor and aroma on this one were quite good despite the fact that neither was very complex. With that, it must be known that I am a big sour head, so this was right up my alley. I think this one could have benefited from a small amount of acetic acid in the flavor and aroma, but that is about it. Definitely worth trying or trading for if you haven't had it already."
"2010 Vintage... Couldn't pass this up when I saw it on the bottle list at Toronado's 24th Anniversary party. Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a medium off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is just how I like my Flanders-style beers. Nice tart cherry aromas with oak and vanilla. There are also some lovely Brett aromas. Smells like Supplication...lets see if it tastes as good as the RR classic... interesting... quite different. There are definitely aspects that are much like Supplication. The cherry and oak flavors are spot-on. TONS of oak, which I love. This beer is sweeter than I was expecting though. It is much sweeter than Supplication... quite a bit boozier too. That can be expected at being over 10%ABV though. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a dry, tart finish. Drinkability is high, as long as the booze doesn't become overwhelming. Overall, I'm glad I got to try this one, and I would definitely purchase it again. It's a bit more sweet and boozy than I would like it to be though. More time would definitely do this beer some good."
"I was quite disappointed with this amongst the star sour beers I have had recently and just the good beers I have had from Deschutes. Overall this is not a winner for me especially with so many rock stars in this style/category these days. Apparently there have been some quality and varying bottle issues with this batch so I will refrain from totally discounting this beer in the future."
"O: Time to get some November 2010 releases. Not the best Flanders I have had, but it is definitely good."
"-Cheers"
"D: Alright, if we're going by style here then it gets low marks, Dissident is a hybrid style that's difficult to grade as there isn't too many ""Imperial"" versions of the style out there. It's a one-and-done beer for me. Unique and delicious but if you're looking for a proper Oud Bruin, this isn't it."
"O - A great sour, nice balance."
"O: I'm not sure what's going on here. 6 months ago, on release, it was drinking really nicely. Now it's practically flat and sweeter and less bretty. I bought one bottle of this vintage separately from the others, a couple weeks after the release. I wonder if perhaps this is that bottle and it was mishandled."
"Overall- its very easy to drink and crisp. The tastebuds beg for more. No hint of any alcohol. My fav sour."
" hooked me up with the bottle. Thanks man."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper orange color with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small random spots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour cherries, wine grapes, wood, and funk/must/vinegar. Taste is of bitter sour cherries, sour grapes, wood from the barrels, and funk/must/vinegar. This beer has a good carbonation with a crisp and slightly dry finish. Overall, this is a good flanders oud bruin with some nice sour cherry flavors. I am glad I got to acquire 2 bottles of this. I am going to hold onto the other bottle for a while to see how it ages."
"4.5 D: Really tasty and certainly good with some age on it. I went back for another glass."
"O - Quite delicious and complex brew. Very well crafted beer with a myriad of flavors that are all well represented."
"O- Was excited to try this one on tap at the Happy Gnome for MN Craft Beer Week, very good, complex, delicious, very nice funky sour beer, was a bit of a sipper for me, alcohol was present but did not take away from the experience. Solid offering from Deschutes."
"As far as sours go, this probably is one of the easiest to stomach for the masses. All and all, a very enjoyable beer with cheese or berries."
"A little bit heavy of body for the style, but nice carbonation. A very approachable sour."
"Finish: Tart and long. Full of an array of flavors and craftmanship. The alcohol is so well masked in this beer that you can barely notice it on the finish. An excellent example of this style of brewing by the folks at Deschutes. Well done!"
"After missing this one in bottles (didn't have the right connections at the time) I finally got to try it on tap. Poured a reddish-amber color with a moderately full light brown head. Very funky, sour and tart, with aromas of juicy cherries and brett. On the palate, light bodied, with flavors of tart cherries, red wine, brett and a little caramel. Very tart and acidic."
"It poured a hazy golden dark orange color, with little to no head. Looked like a darker flanders oude bruin. It smelled like it was going to taste extremely sour. You could smell the bacteria that was used to sour the brew. Once I tasted it, I was completely dissappointed. It tasted bitter and undrinkable. (did I have an infected bottle? I've opened 3 and they've all tasted the same) Mouthfeel was mediocre, effervescent but not bubbly enough. Overall, I didn't enjoy this brew at all."
"Beer was an amazing experience that was subtle sour cherries hints of other berries, and then some funk. A very light beer that reminded me almost of Sour Apple Juice. Good…DAMN STRAIGHT IT WAS! I would buy a few bottles to maybe drink after the date suggested on the bottle. Sadly, we don’t get this beer in Florida and it is a pretty hard bottle to come by otherwise. Regardless this was a class act beer! Great entry level sour."
"Ah, I think this 2010 vintage is still slightly hot, it was worth buying but not a beer that I thoroughly enjoyed, appreciated the cherries and complexity of the flavors. Would've liked either a greater malt or brett presence, either would've taken this offering to new heights."
"Overall, one of the most unique tasting brews I have had in awhile! Unique and different, but not really my thing. Would have liked some sour to go with my funk, but that never happened. Not a big fan and will not be seeking any more of this brew out."
"Overall I was excited to try this beer big time. I've got a Mirror, Mirror, Jubel, and Abyss in the cellar but this had to come first for my introduction to Deschutes. This beer missed the mark just a bit with my expectations/preference but overall is a solid offering. I would not seek this out again in trade but would gladly share a bottle with someone in the future."
"I'm glad I gave it a go and look forward to the next release (looks like an every two year deal). Being that the reviews for the last release were a bit more positive, I have no doubt that the next one will be fun to try as well."
"Serving Type- Bottle"
"O- Overall a truly nice beer. I'm going to have to hold onto my last 2010 for a few years to see how this one hadles a bit of age."
"What really stands out with the Dissident, is the smooth but yet dry mouthfeel. My first review of this style. Love it."
"O: This is kind of like cherries and blue cheese mix. Pretty good."
"Highly recommended."
"o - Overall, Deschutes RULES! Another fine fine beer from the masters. The nose kills it, the flavor is a bit too tart and took some time to get adjusted to. Very enjoyable beer."
"This is a medium bodied offering with modest carbonation. Quite bold with the abv not really hidden much however it is easy drinking. It has quite a clingy wild character that lasts inside the mouth. A good representation of the style but a little young tasting. Enjoyable all around, it's my fault for opening this prior to the best after date, I'm anxious to see how this one developes and enjoy again in a few months."
"Overall this beer is very drinkable and good, but not amazing. There is a bit too much hops bitterness and body, not enough sour for my taste. I know the high ABV makes it hard for bugs to sour this beer but lower ABV and more sourness would have been a plus to me."
"On draft at Beer Revolution. 2010 batch. Pours a reddish amber with a ring of white head around the outside of the glass. Leaves some small spots of lacing when swirled. The aroma is very oaky with strong cherries. A decent amount of vinegar comes through as well as a little bit of red wine, a little bit of mineralness and just a hint of alcohol. I don't really get any of the funk usually associated with brett. The initial taste is sweet with some lactic acid which goes into strong oak and cherries, as well as some tannic, red wine. The finish is very acetic. Not much alcohol in the taste. Light bodied. Medium-low carbonation. Pretty astringent. Overall, I was a little disappointed in this beer. It is really dominated by oak and vinegar."
"This is excellent, pretty much like everything else fro this brewery. Fresh this is not over the top sour, which I like. Lots of nuance, and something I would highly recommend."
"Nice Flemish sour, but I'd rather have Red Poppy or several Belgians any day."
"Drier and more developed than I remember, more complex. Definitely recomend a few years of age!"
"It is a nice sipper, something that goes down pretty easily. Its just the right amount of sour and challenges the palate. I was hoping for something mind blowing and was a bit let down. I would trade this for last years Black Butte XXII."
"D. Very drinkable. It's hard to believe this is a 10.5%."
"Pours a crisp orangish red with a bit of nice head. No real lacing but a beautiful rim of head left. Smells strongly of oak and cherry. Subtle vanilla and tart sourness. Tastes sweet and tart. Lots of oak on the tongue. So much oak. The cherry is pretty strong but there is a nice vanilla and sour kick. Solid mouthfeel and very drinkable for such a sour beer. Really impressive!"
"D - Drinkability is moderate. Not a bad beer and the flavors are good, and the alcohol is absurdly masked, but the acidity is just a bit too much."
"D: Not bad for a sour. I've had some 4oz samples I couldn't even finish. Not completely into sours yet!"
"Very nice beer"
"D: Well I know Deschutes has a best after date so I guess I can't be too surprised. Luckily I have a bottle in the cellar. I will adjust my score once I sample that one in a year."
"Would love to try this again, had a bit of a stomach virus when I had this, and it took away from the overall enjoyment I suspect. A little pricey."
"I was lucky enough to grab 4 of these this year and can't wait to see how they develop through the years."
"Drinkability - While I did open this beer before its ""enjoy after"" date, I felt the need to try it now. The alcohol is a bit too noticeable, granted, it is 10.5%. In addition, it is not as tart/acidic as I was hoping. I really feel some age on this will really let the alcohol mellow, and the Brett pick up a bit more. Can't wait to try this in about a year or so. Have four more left (may trade a couple) but I will keep at least two to see how this ages. Glad I was able to try this and get my hands on it."
"Video review up here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_TuZTHGxRI"
"D-its not a bad drinker but I just had a small glass of this and I'm not sure I could've finished an entire bottle"
"Drinkability is not the highest due to the high abv. Great sour though."
"D - Extremely Drinkable for a sour, but I wouldn't want to drink more than a bottle if you plan on using your taste buds for something afterwards."
"The beer is smooth with a light finish; not a heavy mouth feel at all, but the sourness definitely helps you enjoy this one a bit slower, like you would with a tart lemonade. Very impressive!"
"D- I don't really know what I was expecting of this but this wasn't it. The abv is fairly well hidden and has a nice balance. I am going to lay one down and see how it fairs."
"This is a pretty nice beer for it being as young as it is and coming from a brewery that does not specialize in sours. The beer actually reminds me a lot of Russian River's Sanctification, their brett only beer, which is why at this young age it doesn't get a better score from me. Pure Brett, especially this young, is kind of harsh. It lacks the nuance I've experienced with RR's sours that make use of all three strands of sour yeasts- a bit of lactic acid would tame the tartness add a creamy mouthfeel. Still, I'm eager to try this again in a year or two."
"Drinkability- Alcohol is barely noticeable among the riot of flavor."
"Had an average palate feel. Will re-rate if get a chance to taste an aged bottle."
"HIGHLY refreshing and drinkable even though I'm drinking it at room temperature. This is some really interesting stuff!"
"Medium bodied with slightly funky tartness. Puckering but not too much so with no acidity. It's more sweet really with lots of vinous dark fruit. Hints of grape, dark cherry, raisin and plum. Well balanced with earthy oak and a prominent vanilla character. Complex, well balanced and very quaffable."
"I have had the pleasure of tasting an '08 vintage and it is mind blowing. This was a shell of what it can be, a good beer, but definitely LET IT AGE!!!!"
"Not as intense as I expected (or as some may have hoped) but it's a very drinkable 10.5% sour ale. One worth having now and saving away for years to come."
"Pours slightly hazy amber with very thin head. Barnyard on the nose, maybe a resemblance to some funky cheese. Big sweet and sour on the palate with cherry qualities but also wild with all those yeast influences. Long sour finish. Again, more cherry."
"Because it strikes a balance between the overtly-sour and the atypically-sweet, it is easily drinkable and suitable for either a warm summer's day or a frigid winter's night. A very solid sour, especially for the price, though, for the moment, lacking a bit in complexity. I expect great things from the Dissident with a couple of years on it."
"I'm happy with the bomber, can't say i'd drink 2 of these one right behind the other but it's certainly not a chore to drink. Alcohol heat is nonexistant."
"Edit 1/19/11: Just tried this on tap and it was a bit more sour than the bottle, but I still found this years version to not be up to level established by the first release."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a lot. Sad that I don't have much left but looking forward to trying it again in a year."
"Medium bodied, creamy, medium carbonation, and finishes dry. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. This is a wonderful and complex beer. I am glad I have one more bottle to age. I recommend this beer highly."
"Overall, it's a solid fruity sour. I'd prefer a little more sour or brett and less of the weird aftertaste."
"D: I would love this brew. I cannot wait to open a bottle next year."
"I can see why people like this beer, I didnt like it when it first came out and this version isnt much better."
"Drinkability - I haven't had the 2008 version of The Dissident, so I can only rate this against other Oud Bruins. Outstanding. I personally enjoyed the depth, yet mellow, contribution the brett provided this presentation. The cherry provide a surprising balance with its sweet contribution. An outstanding beer."
"Ill be seeking this again for future experimentation."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied with quite a bit of carbonation. It drinks pretty smoothly overall, and the tartness hides the alcohol. I'd absolutely recommend this beer to anyone looking to get into sours. Or even to anyone that doesn't like them much. The sweetness of the cherries really offsets the sour."
"D: More of a sipper and you definitely gotta be in the mood for this one. A 10 ounce pour was enough for me."
"D: Less drinkable than I remember, though still very good. I definitely recommend The Dissident, especially if you have the opportunity to sample the first release."
"I'm a newbie to the world of sour beer and I loved The Dissident. I wish I picked up an extra bottle to cellar when I had the chance. I wonder how this will taste after aging for a year or two. Hopefully, we won't have to wait two years for the next release of The Dissident. But if we do, I'm sure it will be worth the wait!"
"Conclusion: This beer is easy drinking and complex, interesting and subtle. I love it, and I am looking forward to the other 5 bottles that are waiting in my cellar. If this gets more sour and funky as it ages I think it will only get better. This beer is outstanding and is surely one of the best I have ever tasted, and the best part is that it is still young. I look forward to tasting another next year with anticipation. If I had only three beers to drink for the rest of my life, this would be one of them."
"D= I like this one a lot. It is almost exactly what I expected from it however so it didn't blow me away. I'm extremely happy I got to try it and really wish it I was able to find another bottle to sit down with for a little while but maybe next time. A wonderful beer that is worth seeking out."
"Definitely not a session beer, but very pleasing on a stand-alone basis. This would probably make a good counterpoint to an overly sweet dessert. If you dig tart, Belgian-style beers, this is a good choice."
"Overall: I used to think this had too much cherry. After more experience with sours and cherry flavors, I can emphatically state that this is an exceptional beer. Not the epitome of the style, but the barrel aging is great."
"d - I thought this was a really good flanders. Some people thought the first batch was more sour and had mroe oak; I've never had that batch but still really enjoyed this one. Would like to get a bottle of this to compare."
"Very drinkable, especially considering the ABV."
"A very drinkable beer. The light carbonation and sweeter taste blending with the tart bite makes this a beer that could easily cause you to enjoy a little too much at 9.00%."
"Beer is medium to light in body and sweeter than I expected. The lead off character is strongly malty and pretty sweet, this immediately gives way to a strong funky sourness, mostly lactic with an acetic and mildly citric brightness to it. The finish is clean and mildly tart in the corners of my mouth. A very good bruin."
"I don't get the hype. Hugely underwhelming. I will not part with anything that I can't get off the shelves for this beer."
"I also sampled a few other Deschutes creations while at Pracna, Obsidian, Jubelale. I must say this is definitely the most original beer I ever tasted, and the most standout I tasted that night. I will be back next week to sample it yet again and The Abyss they are tapping Thursday (12/16/10)."
"The Dissident is crazy drinkable. If I have any criticism, it's that the tartness doesn't seem as if it's fully come into its own yet. While the beer's great now, I think a year or two in the cellar could make it outrageous."
"The Dissident is simply spectacular. Balanced but assertive, the alcohol heat is remarkably well-hidden behind a wall of flavors. The sour, wild nature is readily apparent, but the massive flavors from the malt and cherries, rounded out by barrel aging, come together so nicely. This is presumably from the brand-new, November 2010 release, so this keg was less than a month old and snappier than hell. If you find a bottle, buy it; if you see it on draft, order two. Silly-drinkable for this style, and silky smooth all around."
"The beer came out more amber than brown and looked a bit like a double IPA, though it certainly didn't taste like one. There's a lightly fruity tart bite like you'd expect from a wild ale, and really this reminds me of an American wild ale like the Odell's Woodcut Series. You can taste a little of the cherries and they're matched with a lemon peel bite. The sour character is relatively clean considering how earthy and funky some Belgian get. Still, it's a tasty beer and I'd expect it to develop nicely over time. Even at 9%, it's relatively drinkable for the strength and I wouldn't have minded a few more glasses."
"D - Quite nice...very enjoyable. Funk is prominant and welcome...a bit of malt presence. Could savor this one for a long time, but it is going down a bit too quick. Excellent...hoping to be able to try a bottle from the new release to compare..."
"Overall this is a great drinkable sour ale. I think this would be a good a sour ale for someone who has not had a sour ale before because it is well balanced but true to the sour style."
"Medium bodied beer with just a gentle carbonation, slippery and slightly syrupy. Fairly drinkable glass of beer as the sour is not too strong, not lingering too long on the tongue, making it very easy to drink, but better to sip slowly."
"Draft. Sampled on 12/10/10 at Pracna on Main. Had 2 glass, the first poured into a tall pils glass a clear copper amber color with very little head. The second pour was into a snifter and did have a slight tan head. Aroma is that of sour cherries and slight acidic notes, very minimal aroma with some sweetness. Medium/light mouthfeel with slight carbonation. Slightly boozy. Cherry taste with white wine characteristics. Woody. The Brett is pretty subdued, may be interesting how time treats this. Easy drinking but with all the craziness over this in MN, I'm really note sure if it deserves the hype."
"This is one of the best sour beers I've ever had...right up there with Russian River Consecration. So good that I went back to Bevmo later that night to buy more."
"D- it's amazing how a beer with so many wine-like qualities can be this enjoyable, since i've never been a big wine drinker"
"D: Doesn't stand up to the hype ... but it's real real good anyway."
"drinkability: good"
"Not the most complex of sour brews, but really delicious and very drinkable. I bought several bottles to age, but was lucky enough to find this on tap at the Parkway in Tacoma. Already a great beer, and I can't wait to see how it develops."
"The way I see it there are two possibilities. Either the name doesn't fit the beer (assuming this is what the brewer was going for) or the beer didn't quiet fit the brewer's vision. I know it doesn't sound like it, but I am enjoying this beer. Not the most notable release from Deschuttes but certainly not the worst. A good, solid brew."
"2010 version. Split with the wife - who picked it up for me at $10.99 at local beerstore (all sold out in a day). Wine like nose, Golden amber color with minimal head. Softly tart with oaky wine barrel, sour cherries, and a bit of brett funkiness on the palate. Similar in taste to the Deschutes St Ryan's - which had some extra brett flavors. Fruits come out as it warms up.. Can't say that it is as tart as the previous version or as sour to me. So, while muted, still a very nice cherry flavored finish. Well done and refreshing. Even the wife liked it, - so that is saying something...."
"What a beer! I loved it... a very nice sour brown, a bit fruitier and more sour than other browns I've had. Very pretty orange copper color, I like it a lot. Tart on the nose, but also prominently acetic as well, nice interplay between the two ""sour"" notes. A bit of cherries, some oak. Flavors work together really nicely, some vinegar, tart cherries, apples, light brown malts. They all come together well while still showcasing their individual lights. Dry finish, medium to full body for a sour. Overall a great drink, crisp, refreshing, sad to see it go."
"D: Good for the style and easy to drink."
"This is one of the best domestically brewed barrel aged sours! It is not quite as fruity as the Flanders beers but this is the closest thing I have tasted to a true Flanders that wasn't. The nose and the palate are loaded with red and dark fruit flavors with some slight spice malts that blance out the fruity flavors. The carbonation is just perfect with a thin fizzy head and really fine bubbles that are almost champagne like. I always look forward to the release of this beer."
" Body is a pretty reddish amber color, toped by a small, creamy, off-white head. Aroma is mostly tart cherries, with some lactic acid, astringency, and sour notes. Palate is deliciously complex - balanced between the sweetness of the fruit and light, airy malt and just a hint of sourness up front. The lactic sourness builds before the swallow, then takes over completely on the finish. Lively carbonation keeps the cherries dancing around the acidity. This has aged very well. I'm not a zealot for sour beer, but time has been kind to this one and it's a pleasure to drink."
"- Yes, I am aging it rather fresh, but it took Deschutes some time to finally release this too... I am thinking it just wasn't ready enough then.... and it's still not ready now. For those that were blessed enough to have other vintages.. I am guessing this one will fall short.... The hype machine worked its magic... and I will go back to Cascade and have a better sour again."
"drinkability - flavorful but seems flat, not too sour, not ready for prime consumption yet, eager to see how the bottles do in the recommended 18 mos of aging"
"Was really looking forward to finally trying this beer, while it was still pretty good, I was a little let down by the somewhat muted flavor and lack of sour..."
"All in all, this is a good brew. I am not a sour fan, so I might not be the best judge of the style, but, this seems like a moderately sour brew. Not intense, but still very noticeably sour. Good to try at least once if you like the style."
"A Back Log Rating... From a tap handle, this poured into a snifter looking foggy, reddish with an off white head that created a ring around the glass throughout the whole brew. Aroma of wine-like characters and almost lambic in nature. Really thick palate that filled and expanded nicely in the mouth. This brown style had a little more bitterness and darker malt notes than its Red counterpart, and it seemed the wild yeast really did a nice job. You could taste a hint of barley-grains in the finish."
"The beer manages to come off as rich in my mouth, but the carbonation is a touch heavy. Still, its medium body and lack of any perceivable alcohol make it a winner. At 9%, this beer has brought a ton of vast flavors that make it rich and delicate, while the prominent sourness, wood and wild edges make it brash and bold. That duality makes the Dissident something every sour beer fan should try."
"An epic beer for the sour beer lover, between the level of sourness and light yeast funk, this beer has found a perfect balance. Way too drinkable for its size: Sip and savor with care. A bottle full of beer geek joy."
"D: Probably the best offering from Deschute I've had to date. This is one of the most complex and balanced flanders that I've come across in a long while and the age has done wonders to it. Definitely worth seeking out and truly a great beer."
"Even though I had the foresight to buy several bottles of The Dissident back in '08, I was stupid enough to trade away all but this bottle. If I'm lucky enough to have access to the second release (scheduled for next month), that mistake will not be repeated. Bottom line: one of the best of 2010."
"Drinkability was very good. No signs of abv"
"Pours a golden amber, with tannish head, good lacing. Smell some funk, malt and yeast. Taste sour @ the front, then gone! Followed by alcohol, some funk, malt with a sweet finish. Mouthfeel is very good, great amount of carb and a touch of dryness. Drinkability is very good, I could drink this all night, perfectly balanced, IMHO."
"D. I could sip this one all day long. Of course I would be slammed after 405 glasses. No notice of the alcohol until the glass is empty. Super balanced and easy to down. Can't wait for the next release."
"Taste is of raspberry, straberry, sweet wine and a good amount of sour. Some funk, just enough to balance the sweetness. Very well rounded, one of the few high abv beers I would describe as refreshing."
"Overall, a solid American shot at an Oud Bruin. I liked this beer, though it is not my favorite example of the style by a stretch."
"D- This is drinking very well right now. I would love to score another bottle of this and just let it set another year or so. Have a feeling some of the cherry flavor died down reading past reviews. Overall, I could drink a lot of this the way it is now."
"Note: I've had this beer younger and I think this age (approximately 2 years) is pretty perfect."
"D: Not sure if sitting for over a year has helped this but The Dissident is an excellent Flanders. Very rich, spicy and fruity with a layer of maltiness that keeps things very interesting."
"D: Not my favorite Flemish sour, but a decent representation. Only lightly sour, but a decent balance of sweetness and tartness."
"Deschutes' reserve series continues to kick so much ass."
"D - a very subtle and complex Oud Bruin, not flashy by any means (maybe the age had something to do with this?). quite drinkable, would go great with some earthy or slightly funky cheese. at and ABV of 9%, a bit dangerous as it is completely undetectable. really impressed with how much it is changing over the past 15 minutes, opening up and growing. fantastic beer."
"D - Oh quite drinkable. Someone please send me another bottle! 4.0"
"D - As a fairly recent n00b to sours, this could easily be a gateway beer to the style. Very mild, yet intriguing with every sip. I'd like to have this again...and again"
"D - These kinds of beers are definitely hit or miss with me, but I found this one to be quite enjoyable. All of the components worked really well together to create a balanced and drinkable brew. Thanks for sharing, Chris!"
"D - A great wild ale, it has a nice balance of brett, fruit and subtle bitterness w/ the malt not being forgotten and making the experience pleasurable"
"I recently had a bottle of this which I found at a store this past January (2010) in Anchorage, AK when I was attending the GABBWF. I was quite surprised to find it as I haven't seen it in my native Oregon since it was released! The colour was a ruby-amber with no head. The aroma was both funky and fruity and nicely balanced between the two. On the palate it was quite tart, dry and musty with plenty of stone fruit flavours and a bit of horse blanket to round it all out."
"Pretty authentic flanders here, Deschutes has done a great job as usual. Sourness and vinegar aspect of the beer is pretty sharp and has a nice bite. Sour cherry and cranberry fruitiness is well done and does not go overboard. I could see this one would not age well over extended periods of time as the vinegar aspect of the beer would start to overwhelm. From the taste of it, seems 2 years is just about right. There is even a touch of hop presence, giving it a little North American feel. The rotting wood character that was prevalent in the nose is more in the background on the palate. The ABV is ridiculously well hidden, cant even taste it. I could easily drink a whole bomber to myself and still might crave some more. Excellent beer, I really dig it. Goes well with Craisins and soft chevre goat cheese."
"Poured into a Harpoon tulip, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the cloudy reddish copper brew. Head continues to grow for awhile before slowly starting to fade, with chunky lacing. Aroma is bubblegum and tart cherries. Taste starts sweet, has a powerful tartness in the middle, and a lightly smoky clean close. Mouthfeel is effervescent, and drinkability is good also. Very impressed with how the sour stays in the middle, and doesn't dominate the entire flavor experience."
"D - Very easy to drink despite high abv. The sourness is assertive, but not overbearing. This would be a great starter beer for someone who's new to sours/wilds. Overall, a very enjoyable and well-done beer."
"Drinkability: A very well crafted brew, complex, and surprisingly balanced. I know (despite not having too many examples of it) that this is a style that's hard to pull off, and so I have to give kudos to Deschutes for putting together a great brew. 9.0% is high, but not astronomically so, and though this one came at the end of the evening for us - this was a fairly epic tasting - it was still drinkable enough that I neglected to leave any in the snifter."
"M + D: Medium bodied, well carbonated and semi-dry. The carbonation takes from the dryness on the palate, and it could help to be a little dryer in that sense. Overall, a well-balanced brew.. sour, rich, and intense.. Very well done."
"Pours brown with an off-white head. The aroma is a mix of vinegar and very tart cherries. Definitely a very good aroma. The flavor is also heavy on the cherries with some funk as well. It is definitely a sour beer, but not as sour as the aroma led me to believe it would be. You also get some oak and vanilla in the flavor. Medium to high carbonation and very drinkable."
"too good and too easy to drink. not hint at all of the 9% ABV. hands down the best cherry flavor i have ever had."
"As noted above, this beer has begun to lose some of its initial cherry flavor and has balanced out nicely. Really looking forward to the next batch in 2010."
"Slow and long sippper...as good as it gets."
"Note: I preferred the 2008 to the much boozier 2010, which was a bit overwhelming"
"Prickly medium-high carbonation, starts sour and finishes with a spicy bite. Great drinkability considering its ABV and high acidity, although I'm a bit biased for beers of this style. I liked this better fresh because the fruitiness of the cherries helped to balance out some of the acidity."
"Great beer. So glad I started trying sours beers."
"Overall, I am glad I saved a bottle this long, and wish I had another. I really did not enjoy the last bottle I cracked, so if you've been holding on to these and have a few, now is a great time to break that wax."
"This is not very drinkable. I could probably drink a bottle if I split it with someone but this would be the last time I'd drink this. I would not search this out or recommend getting it unless your a big time sour fan and just want to try it."
"D: A fairly good attempt at a style that seems hard to master outside of the boarders of Belgium. It's slightly too heavy and big to be really good. The additions from the cherries are really nice though."
"D: Awesome. Nice light tartness, tanic wine qualites with a touch of oak and sweetness. Now sure how this one was when it was released, but it is drinking world class right now."
"Drinkablity: Very drinkable brew that creeps up with its potency. Fits the style well, but has something indescribable that makes it unique. I enjoyed the bitter finish."
"It takes a beer like this to remind us that brewing can be a ritual suffused with beauty and spirituality. I suppose anything inoculated with wild yeasts, infused with cherries for a year and then aged in pinot and cabernet barrels is expected to be unique but Deschutes not only pulled off the traditional Belgian style extraordinarily, they also added their own trademark American stamp that made this something much more than a mere replication."
"D: This beer is damned drinkable. The flavors are very tasty and refreshing. This beer cools, rather than warms. Refreshes and tests the palate. I suppose it could be more dynamic, but it has a beautiful subtlty. Sadly this beer has gone much quicker than expected and remains my only bottle. Will absolutely have to track down some more bottles of this. Fantastic brew."
"Pours a dark ruby with a large white head. The smell is one of sweetness with a little bit of tart fruit coming in, mostly cherries. Hints of wood. Some slightly-roasted malt and accompanying sweetness. The taste is most prominent in the tart fruit department, with a bit of an alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of carbonation."
"Overall, this beer seems to have a little too much vinegar to it. It is good and represents the style pretty well, but I would like to try this one fresh and reevaluate."
"D - VERY balanced, not too sour, not too funky"
"2008 bottle thanks to paytoplay. Pours a really hazy red-brown with a small light tan head. Vinous and woody, with some light spice notes in the background. Smells somewhat tart with lactic notes and quite a bit of mustiness. Taste is a bit sour, again with lactic notes. Heavy oak with a lot of earthiness. Definite Brett notes. Lots of cherry and fruit. Very intense. Nice full body. Really impressive effort from Deschutes."
"I wonder where this beer will go next. It was drinking great for me when it was first bottled, and even better after six months. Now it is getting more funk in the complexity arena. It is a bottle I would recommend sharing, but I am enjoying the ride."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation."
"D--Not something I would go for again, I think I still need to get worked into these sour beers slower. Not sure my palate is ready. I did enjoy this more than others I have tried though."
"D- This is a very good beer. Much milder than other sours I have experienced recently. The oak and cherry are really the main characters for this brew. A well done brew by Deschutes and I look forward to trying others (have the Abyss 08 in my cellar)."
"What a treat to find a Flanders Brown Ale! I was shocked when I heard about it and of course rushed to our local beer shop and picked it up. The aroma was full of complex dark fruits and malt character with sour notes. When pouring, the aromas waft up out of the billows of frothy off-white head. The color is a pleasant medium brown with a few garnet highlights. Brilliant clarity and the head persists while drinking -slight lacing. I was impressed with the balance of flavors in this beer. It begins with toasty malt character and deep fruitiness thatlayers into the sour semi-dry finish. The hops are really not noticeable but there may be a touch of bitterness to counter point the sour and fruit character. The sourness of the beer is prominent but balanced with the other components of the beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slight drying, and the sourness has that to-style touch of astringency. Overall, the beer is very well-balanced and drinkable once your palate adjusts for the sourness. A beer well worth the purchase particularly for such a hard-to-find style."
"Drinkability: All in all, that was awesome. I definitely had my doubts about this one, but it pulled through and was downright delicious toward the end. Maybe the sourness is on the tame side? I'm not sure. No stinging carbonation, which is something that's always bugged me about wild ales and lambics. This may be my gateway beer into sours. I'll be buying a couple bottles next time I see this."
"D - Drinkability is very good. Not the best example of the style but a remarkable beer in it's own right. It is a stronger brew but the abv does not seem to hinder how easy it goes down. One bomber in a session is enough for me but I would love to visit this brew again. Smooth + balanced = winning beverage in my book."
"The aroma was pruney & tangy, the taste was complex with what appeared to be strong cherry & malt. The tartness was perfect and the alcohol well masked. I did however find a less than wonderful after taste that really effected the drinkability, I can't put my finger on it but it really lingered way too long."
"This beer has mellowed out a bit since the first time I had it when it was released. I have a couple more bottles cellaring and can't wait to see how it develops the next time I pop one!"
"The Dissident is very good beer. I like it quite a bit. It's really grown on me with each passing sip. I really like its subtle and deceptive approach. The flavor is somewhat tame for a sour, funky Flanders Oud Bruin, but it's a big time beer that will creep up on you. The flavor is nicely refined and enjoyable. It's rather artful (if that makes any sense). Overall, it's a very nice success and proves once again how talented the fine folks at Deschutes are. Nice job guys."
"Nice and solid, pleasant and refreshing, but short of great."
"Blipped ""Dissident Aggressor"" by Judas Priest"
"The color is an brownish red with a very light head. The lacing that this beer leaves on the glass is just amazing... It smells of very sweet fruits and slight sourness. The taste is extremely tart raspberries and sour apple. Dissident has a very thin light body which makes it extremely easy to drink. I truly enjoyed this gem."
"M/D: this beer is exceptional good in my opinion i was surprised in a good way, never had the style and now ill seek it out. its a bit sweet but good."
"D: The funk is deliciously intense."
"Reddish brown color, very small head. Smells like sour fruit, with a bit of malt. I'm not really sure what to compare this too... But i was pleasantly surprised. slight vinegar taste, not too sour. just enough to give it a nice twang. slightly spicy and peppery. Medium carbonation level. the sourness does a nice job of scrubbing the palate. I like this beer. i haven't had too many sours before, so i don't have much to compare it too... but i like it."
"d: Big thanks to stellar JohnGalt1 for this gem. What an extraordinary beauty form the PNW. Thanks again Toby!"
"D - This is a pretty good brew. I've never had this style, but I've enjoyed it."
"Overall, one of the most interesting beers I've had in awhile."
"Dark mahogany body sits regal in the glass. Hosts a bread crust colored speckled deep tan head that stands at an inch and fades in a minute. Nose is very attractive with tones of sweet, tart cherries, doughy yeast and dark fruit resins. Keeps with that yeasty feel as you take first sip followed by an initial sweet tart tingle on the tongue. The tart feel turns slightly vinegary but still nice. The sour feel stays on the back of the tongue and creates a mouthfeel of sour dry bitter. Almost turns to a citrus bitter on the back of the tongue. Drinkability is good."
"It's relatively clean (for a funky beer), properly built, gorgeous to look at and inhale, with no significant flaws... but it's in need of refinement. That said, considering the exploding price points of American Wild Ales, it's nice to see a brewer not start ramping up to the 15-30 dollar range before they've mastered the art (in that price range I still only trust Russian River, domestically, for wild ales... although I still end up buying others). Here's hoping each subsequent release pushes this beer from simply good to the realm of the truly great."
"2008 vintage tasted at 58F. Pours into my wine tasting glass a beautiful red copper with a nice foamy head. Mild funky sour malt aroma. Delicate body is appropriate to style, but surprising to me, as I usually prefer more 'extreme,' big-bodied beers. Flavor is sour, malty and mildly funky, all three harmoniously merging together. Finishes dry, but no hops bitterness, flavor or aroma are detectable. There is a slight weird smoky or chocolate flavor towards the end. Overall, a sipping beer with the complexity and interest of a fine wine."
"Thanks Toby!"
"poured reddish, not too thick. An aroma of spit and bacteria. Initially, the sourness well controlled by malt. Decent mouthfeel for a sour. Drinkable over a meal, tastes somewhat of a wild ale that builds up in the mouth over repeated sips.Intersting and worth seeking out."
"Deschutes this far."
"My first Flanders Oud Bruin, not bad, but not great. Especially compared to lambics and Flanders reds. There is nice flavor up front, but not much on the back end. Maybe thats par for the style. Still, a decent beer."
"Bottle: Poured a deep reddish color ale with large foamy head with great retention and great lacing. Aroma of oak and tart notes are clearly dominant with some light funk also discernable. Taste is also dominated by some oak notes with a tart taste with some lactic funky sour notes also noticeable. Good body with great carbonation with no apparent alcohol. While I really enjoyed the sourness and the oak notes I thought the funky yeast didn't integrated that well with the rest of the flavors. Still very good nonetheless."
"Deschuttes keepes bringing out amazing brews. Keep up the good work."
"I found the 2010 edition to much less flavorful and more watery than the 2008 edition and my score has decreased from 4.25 to 4.0"
"Overall, the oak flavor dominated and the sour, acidic profiles did not match the strength the nose led on to believe. The mellow flavors were just too weak and easily masked by the wood, oak flavors."
"D:Very cool beer. The sweet and sour continue ever after not having a sip for a few minutes. Very long lasting and memorable"
"Delicious. Simply Delicious."
"D - this is a fantastic sour. I only hold Consecration higher than this. Really worth seeking out."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Tasty, sour, and balanced. Not as good as Red Poopy, but still a damn good oud bruin."
"D: The alcohol in this beer creeps up from behind. There are zero hop characteristics in this beer, which is an interesting change of pace. If you dislike lambics, you'll probably dislike this one. A very good and surprising beer for me."
"Tartness and sweetness towards the very impacts drinkability to the minus."
"Overall: This is the first Flanders style beer I have tried. The beer has a pleasant sourness to the beer, but it is not vinegary. The mouth feel is a medium body with some sweetness and some tartness to the beer. The finish lingers on the palate and is surprisingly refreshing and tasty. The first sip of the beer I kinda puckered my face but it was only for a moment. I like this beer it is like a breath of fresh air."
"A great take on the style and i am interested to see how this one progresses."
"This beer pours an orangy brown with a 1 fingered head and a decent amount of lacing. The smell is huge of sour. The taste has alot of sour mixed with a nice borwn ale. This was strange due to tasting the Russian river earlier where the oak flavor was nearly nonexistant, but this one you have a big brown ale flavor, must be tons of dark malts in this brew. A nice mouthfeel with a good carbonation level and a nicely drinkable brew."
"A nice take on the style. Very drinkable. Enjoyable without being overpowering. Unique, yet ""in-style""."
"Overall, a good beer that just misses on being great. Would like to try another as other reviews mention a good sour bite so possibly mine is off. Recommend but do go crazy getting it."
"4/3.5/3.5/4/3.5"
"not at the top of my list but i would try it again. nice hustle deschutes"
"Drinkability- I really liked this brew quite a bit. I'm not a huge style guideline dude and I think plenty of people have knocked the score down a bit but I love what's going on here. The fruit plays a nice roll and adds that tart fleshy bitter like aspect that I enjoy. Tasty ass shit here, thanks again Matt!"
"D - Ah!!! Oud Bruin - one of my favorite styles that I've rarely had. I wish more American Breweries would try their hand at this one. A wonderful brew from a wonderful brewery. I love Deschutes! Keep 'em coming, I'll keep drinking."
"Vinous mouthfeel with a dry and sticky effect on the palate. This is a really enjoyable beer. It's not overly sour or funky so I think it could possibly appeal to people who don't like sours."
"Poured a dark red/copper color with small white head that vanished almost instantly. The aroma was that of brett - sour/funk - with cherry and fruity smells that permeated the tartness. The taste was exactly that of the aroma with a lingering harsh fruit flavor typical of the style. The mouthfeel was smooth while going down and the drinkability was easy due to the medium-full creamy body. Overall, enjoyed this beer due to my love for brett and fruity funk."
"I dont know that I could, or would want to, drink this beer every night, but it it is a very enjoyable experience. Great nose and complex, sour taste. A fantastic beer and worth checking out."
"D - This beer is damn enjoyable but I think the funk could have been pushed down some and it would have been more more enjoyable."
"Drinkability, poured into my Gulden Draak chalice it let's itself work well upon the overall experience...very tart and dry apple cider notes, I can't express enough fine resilient notes our drying characteristics that offer up one exemplary flavor profile, continue to watch for updates...thanks again Geof, you're the man I'm glad I had a hand in your craft brew love affair."
"d= This is a great beer. More tart than the leifmans oud bruin but right on par with the oerbier reservas and other world class examples of this style."
"Tasted and contemplated with m83's saturday=youth"
"Thanks to inflatablechair for this one. 22oz. wax sealed bottle. Served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a reddish copper with a thin off white head. Nice lacing. Great sour fruit aroma. Not quite as sour as the aroma might suggest, but the yeasty tang is there. Medium bodied with a spritzy mouthfeel. Sour cherry flavor develops, as well as a little wood in the finish. Very refreshing and drinkable. Alcohol is not evident. Very enjoyable."
"Absolutely disgusting stuff.... Deschutes should be ashamed of themselves for making something like this. Very, very impressive...."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Bottle. Pours a clear dark reddish brown with an average, off-white head, somewhat lasting with good lacing. Aroma is mainly funky, like horse blanket and farmhouse, with notes of cherry and wood. Taste started sour and funky at first and ended on a sweeter note, not so overly sour that it can only be enjoyed by those that love the style, but not so sweet that the flavor gets wrecked. I'd say a great first try at the style by Deschutes."
"I freakin hate wax capped bottles. I have said it before and will say it again. That being said...Pours a very nice coppery/chestnut color. Decent sized head. Great cherry/fruit aroma with a touch of woody and earthiness to it. Flavor is a pleasant mix of sour fruit with some oak or general wood like flavors. Rather tart/sour but not overly so. Retains some sweetness thoughout. Decent mouthfeel-slight puckering in the finish. Great beer overall. Fantastic US version for sure. Decent beer to cellar I would think. Thanks to jtrockchalk for the Secret Santa sample."
"Remarkable beer."
"Smells of sweet and tart fruit with granny smith apples, cranberry, cherry and raspberries. The taste starts very tart and follows with flavors of cherries, cranberries and other tart fruits. The mouthfeel has medium body and has carbonation that tickles the tongue. Drinkability is high. I could not put this down and had no trouble finishing the bottle. This was my first sour beer and it leaves me wanting to try more. Highly recommended to those who want to try something different."
"This is absolutely wonderful. Should be sought out by any fan of Belgian sour sales, Belgian wild ales, Belgian ales in general, and just damn great beer. The Belgians better watch their back--the Dissident is a bad-ass mutha of an Oud Bruin. There are actually Belgians who think no U.S. brewer could possibly brew a Belgian-style ale with any integrity (I won't name names). The Dissident smashes that notion once and for all."
"D. Not overly puckering and sour, but nice and complex. Great representation of style in all aspects and a beer that I hold high on my all time list."
"Poured into a Cabernet glass. Appears a beautiful amber hue, with a creamy head that dissipated quickly into spotty lacing. Smells of oak, funk and fruit. The cherries really show through on this beer, as well as the pinot noir from the barrels. 18 months did this beer justice. Mouthfeel is thin and dry and dissipates rather fast coaxing me into drinking it faster. Very drinkable, but be cautious, if it warms up to much, the funk becomes a little challenging."
"drinkability is good. restrained sourness and funk. good balance. hides the 9% alcohol fairly well. good stuff!"
"Big thanks to Djeucalyptus for this baby! Poured into a tulip. Nice dark auburn/brown with a thin, wispy off white head. First pour (mine) seemed to dissapate quickly. Smell was divine. Lots of sour apple, vinegar and dark sour fruit. Taste was similar. Got the sour fruit, cherries, apple, etc. Also got a phenolic, medicinal tone. Interesting. Good, full mouthfeel. Served barely chilled, this one was good, not great."
"I had no idea of what to expect with this style so I cannot speak to how true to the style it stays, but pretty tasty no less. I enjoyed this beer to the full extent and recommend that if you haven't yet tried it you want to. I will be again."
"Drinkability is quite good. Not a big sour beast like a lot of the sours I have tried. This one is thick feeling, but the sourness provides a nice tart back drop instead of being in your face. Very nicely done Deschutes."
"Deep tawny amber, clear, with a bit of a reddish hue. It had a sticky beige cap that left some spotty lacing on the glass. A bit sharp on the nose, mildly acetic but quite tart overall. Slightly earthy with some cinnamon spiciness and light horsey funk. The flavour was full of tart fruit and berry, some earthy brett and dried fruit towards the end. Oak and vanilla, plus a bit of molasses appeared as it warmed. Medium to light bodied with average carbonation. The bubbles were quite light on the palate though, giving it a smooth texture. Nicely balanced, quite a mellow sour (at least after the other monsters we imbibed)."
"Pours a clear reddish orange, light brown hues, eggshell head forms, thin ring around the glass, some lace spots stick around. Smell is neat, brown sugar, sour fruit, oak, vanilla, alcohol, cherries and strawberries, cinnamon spice and some raisins, pretty cool, nice sourness. Taste is very fruity, oak, brown sugar and vanilla, honey, sour fruit, cinnamon and a neat spiciness, sour fruit in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Very nice stuff, need to have it again though, it was in some tough competition that night. Thanks Russ!"
"I enjoyed The Dissident quite a bit even though it didn't come together like I hoped it would. It did go down super easy and I'd like more of it now that my glass is empty. I don't know what some time will do but I doubt it will do much. Hopefully things get a little better here."
"Drinkability is OK here but it is so hard to find a bottle around here in KY."
"Pours hazy auburn with a short off-white head. I agree with Ernest, the wax cap nearly drove me insane trying to carve off enough to open the bottle. Aroma is malty, with funky cherries and earthy wood. Not like other sours. Smooth and warm cherry, malt, oak, and vanilla. When the sour comes, it is mellow. Mostly brett and cherries, but in a vinuous/sherry way. Drinks more like a liquer than a funky, sour pucker-bomb. Excellent beer."
"Edit: Just noticed the alcohol content is 9%?? Drinks like a 5.5% abv beer (uh oh, I thought it was!)"
"8/3/8/5/16/4.0 we'll see..."
"So, does approachable equal good? Well, it has the characteristics of a sour ale and yet remains well balanced and easily drinkable - even on this a wicked bitterly cold night. So, yeah. I'd have to say that it does equal good."
"Beautiful on the whole, and an amazing brew considering the relatively mainstream nature of Deschutes. A valiant effort that produced decent results. Not necessarily world class, and it tastes and feels like it could use a touch of work, but on the whole, it's impressive and I definitely look forward to cracking the other bottles."
"Darn. I paid a lot for this ($10) and was really hoping for something really special. From the 22 oz bottle this poured a cloudy dark orange with a small off-white head and very little lacing. Nose was of sour cherry and vanilla. Mouthfeel medium and somewhat fizzy from what I assume is the carbonation. Flavor is of sour fruit and the finish is a bit acrid. Overall it was interesting, but I had a little trouble getting it all down. For me a bit of a disappointmentt. Maybe aged it would get better, but this is the only bottle I had and at this price probably the last."
"The taste smooth and tart to the heart of the buds then softly dissipated. You really get the fruity esters and the taste of sour cherries in the drink. It is not abrasive at all which I thought it might be due to the funk-ness. It seems lightly bittered. You also get a tad bit of a beer that has been oak conditioned. A little bit of wood with this one. Overall a interesting beer that was worth the money."
"This is a very drinkable Flanders and one that is not overpoweringly tart or funky. That makes it a very good beer in my book. I'll definitely revisit this one over time and see how it ages."
"Pours a hazy reddish-brown with a lackluster tan head. Sharp aromas of sour cherry and yeast; vibrant and fruity. Starts off tart and fizzy, with bouncy apple and sour cherry flavors. Needs to warm up significantly from refrigerator temps to show all its complexity. As it warms, the tight sour notes open up to more vinous dark fruit and wood. Some toasty oak/vanilla notes, almost like a rich California chard, come through in the nose, and again in the finish, at warmer temps. By the end it is supple and soft, with some black fruit and red grape skin flavors, but it becomes a little watery. It has some fleeting moments where it could pass for an Oregon pinot noir from a very rainy year. Interesting beer, but seems to come out of the gate too fast and then fades at the finish. Nonetheless, a treat from one of my favorite breweries."
"D - Very interesting. A nice combo of flanders and red wine qualities although the flanders qualities disipate as it warms. This one would be great with a little more funkiness."
"This is a very nice beer, not quite as sour and funky as the classic Belgian versions, but sharp enough and full bodied, creamy and delcious without being hot despite its 9% abv. The beer pours a classic reddish brown with a fair head that settles to a ring. The aromas are fairly light, but with some nice sour and creamy notes and a light metallic tang. Little spice. The taste exhibits some funk and tannins along with the sour tang and creaminess. Some slight spiciness throughout the taste. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel but with that sour tang and some firm tannins. Lovely to drink, this should age nicely. An impressive effort at a sour style by a brewery not known for them."
"Pours a mid to dark copper, i want to say peach as well. Light head, heavy fizzing upon pouring. Smells of sweet citrus. You can slightly smell the sour, but not enough to give it away. This is definitely a sour. This hits the pallet with an intense grapefruit taste. Subtle malty notes hiding in the back to bring you down. It leaves a lemonade sweet flavor on my lips after each sip. This is one of the first sours I've really enjoyed. I can see this one getting good with age as well. Really different from the douches, but I get that's flemmish. Definitely a good beer for those who want to step up a level with sours."
"D: I wouldn't call this highly drinkable. The alcohol is strong and I've had a lot more enjoyable sours. It's more acidic than sour."
"Poured into a tulip a very nice ruby red color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some nice small islands/sticky lacing. The nose is malty, yeasty, some raspberry, cheeries. The taste is malty, yeasty, sour, with some berries in there. Medium body, highly carbonated, the alcohol is hidden very well with this one. Very drinkable, this is a very nice brew, highly recommended, thanks Toby."
"D- This one needs to be sipped. The initial aroma is quite foul, but once you get beyond that, the beer is pretty enjoyable."
"22oz Bottle: Pours a reddish copper with a fine small tan head. I get tart.sour cherry on the nose with a hint of barrel notes. The taste is balanced for a Flanders which is why I think I like it so much. It has the sour acid characteristic with a very subtle hint of sweet. The mouth feel is fantastic with a nice weight, medium, that suits this very well. I rated the drink ability higher than I expected and it is good but not something I would want every day."
"Notes from Keg are very similiar to the bottle. Another sign of across the board quality."
"This is a unique stab at the Flemish red style, full in body and high in ABV. Rodenbach on steroids. Very tasty."
"Overall, still good, I might give it slightly better scores in some areas and slightly worse in others. I think I like the 2012 better, but maybe letting the 2010 settle on the palate a little more will reduce the impression of bitterness."
"Nice reddish color, not too much head and it fades fairly quickly. Smells nice, but not overly sour. Taste is a little different than I expected. Definite sour aftertaste, but a nice earthy/farmy taste through the middle. A fellow BA says it tastes like a ""creature of the farm," but he means that in the best way possible. A solid effort from a great brewery, I can't wait to try it with a little age on it."
"Excellent!"
"Pours cola amber,pretty clear. Nice merangue creamy head piles up and falls to an offwhite cap. Smell is full. Dark cherries, fig, bready malt, leather, raspberry, some nice tropical bouquet, pineappley brett notes. Taste begins with a bit of malt character, followed up with pineapple, orange, cherries. Very tart, not overly sour as some wild ales can be. Brett offers a very nice tropical fruity flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy, a bit heavy, lightly carbonated. Solid beer."
"Pours a murky reddish/brownish/mahogany color, foamy tan head fades quickly into a nice layer on top of the beer, nice spotty lacing, tiny bubbles rising single-file along the side of the glass. Lots of sour cherry on the nose, slightly vinegary, some sugary sweetness under it all really rounds things out. Great sour cherry flavors, brown sugar, slight alcohol flavors, some apple, and some darker fruits. Very actively carbonated, little bubbles zinging every which way, lingering tartness and some nice burn on the lips. This is wonderful."
"The body is dry and lasts into the finish. Very nice. Carbonation is light even for style and could use some more. Overall this is a decent sour. Really reminds me of a cheap La Folie. I really enjoyed some of the fruiter notes but there are some noticeable off flavors that really distract from this to be a great sour."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into a New Belgian globe glass. This beer pours a reddish mahogany that really shows its red highlights when held up to the light. The head started out as a pillow-y 2 inch beige head that left no lacing what so ever and melted into a lily pad. The aroma is woody up front, with sour pie cherries, and apple cider vinegar. The taste follows suit with sour cherries, oak, and raisins. The mouthfeel is light and crisp leaving a slight dryness. This is a great first attempt at a sour from Deschuttes and I for one, would love to see this as a continual effort from them."
"Thanks to Brad at Mile High wine and spirits for holding a bottle for me. Served in an old new belgium snifter. Once you get through the many layers of goddamn wax, this unique brew pours a reddish brown almost treated wood looking color. Good carbonation for such an aged beer. Smells of cherries and dark fruits are immediate followed by figs and some subtle yeast notes. Being such a big fan of flanders style ales, I was expecting a much more sour/tart taste with a fruity finish. I got the finish and most of the heavy fruit pickups but I just didn't get that tartness that I was craving. Still...much respect for this wild ale and for the dedication it took to brew this. If I only had the self control to age a few bottles of this for a few years. Could only imagine how this beer would come into its own given time. Another solid release from my favorite brewery in the US"
"I liked this better than Black Butte XX but not as much as Abyss, even though they are totally different styles, those are the other two in Deschutes reserve series as of now for those of you who do not know, first experience with this new brew, this a damn good Flanders and glad to see this brewery branching out, wish more of this came down into our area, do not know how this will age but it should hold up for a year or two, would like to drink again, recommended"
"D-Working as I taste this but I would love to drink it all night long!!"
"Pours a dark ruby, very similar to the color of the wax, with a one finger light tan colored head that quickly falls to a thin layer of bubbles. A fair amount of lacing clings to the sides of the glass after a good swirl. Smell consists of tart cherries, leather, and wood. A moist grassy aroma and strawberry/rhubarb sprinkled with brown sugar in the nose as well. Taste starts off with Sweedish Fish and crab apples followed by caramel and oak. Midway some vinegar and weak brett battle each other on the tongue. The bland aftertaste is a bit of a disappointment, artificial candy cherry flavors and hay. Light body with an interesting creamy feel and a powerful carbonation. I was very surprised to see this at 9% abv, the alcohol is hidden quite well throughout. Not a bad brew, but nothing mind-blowing."
"D: Awesome, and I hope to get more of this beer to be able to try and experiment with food pairings on this one."
"Overall I'm impressed with this. The beer certainly lives up to the hype, and it's definitely worth a shot. Thanks again to ampzilla for passing this along."
"Drinkability- This is my fourth go round with this beer out of the bottle, and again, I'm disappointed. It goes down easy, but the flavors get a bit obnoxious at points.The combination of flavors just don't get along as well as they could have. I credit Deschutes for trying one of my favorite styles, but I think the hype machine will sell much more of this beer than quality will (and that's coming from a guy who plans to trade his last bottle). I think some age will reform this beers taste a great deal, but unfortunately, I'm far too broke to wait it out. I get to have it on tap in a few weeks. I hope it right some of its wrongs."
"D- Easy to drink, definitely worth sipping. Its fun to see how this beer changes as the beer warms."
"This beer was delicious. I haven't had a great deal of sours to compare it to but I highly enjoyed this beer. Many thanks to Randy for giving me the chance to try this wonderful concoction."
"The ABV is well disguised, but the tartness & dryness do slow me down a bit. I have a love/hate relationship with this style, this certainly skews more towards of the love side of the beer spectrum. Well done, deschutes! sour beer freaks may find this wanting, but I enjoyed this quite a bit"
"Tastes lactic and acetic sour balanced by a prominent sweet. The malt carries a cherry, crabapple, and raspberry flavor that is delectible. Oak is much milder in the flavor than the aroma. Bit of a tart circusy finish that leaves the tongue clingy dry and almost makes the teeth sticky dry. Actually, a bit merlot wine-like. Medium body likely helps this beer, as a light body wouldn't be able to hold flvaors on the tongue and a heavier beer would be sticky. Medium carbonation fights the stickiness, while allowing the malt sweet to persist long enough to nearly balance."
"Overall I would say this was a very solid beer. Not the best sour I have had recently,. But very well balanced and nicely put together. Rich enough to be an all-night sipper for sure. Not a bad release here and I would not be opposed to trying it out again."
"D: As others have said not as sour as I would have liked. That being said this is a nice beer. Totally american. A barrel aged Flanders? Why not. Definitely glad I got the chance to try this. Thanks again."
"D: This is a very well made beer; I'm not surprised as this is Deschutes we're talking about here. This'll be probably the only bottle I'll have of this unless it gets released again. A very tasty Western sour, I'm glad I bought the bottle."
"Overall impression: Hmm .. I like sour beers, but something about this doesn't sit too well. The tartness is puckering in the finish, but there isn't enouhg body or flavor to back it up. It's still interesting, but definitely not one of my favorite Flanders'"
"I'ld like to get my hands on another bottle of this but I think my chances of that are rather bleak."
"Overall, a really tasty brew. I'm no expert on the style, and I'm not a huge fan of the sour type beers, but I think this one is pretty darn good. I hope they make more beers in this style."
"Mouthfeel is on the low end of medium, the carbonation is light, and it finishes with the cherry sourness and some light funk. Yum. I haven't had a lot of experience with Oud Bruins but Deschutes definitely made this one to my liking. Well done."
"Mouthfeel is a little astringent from the wine aging. Good carbonation, very short finish. A very good beer, but not quite a great beer."
"Drinkability- One I would buy again, but probably not worth the double digit price tag due due to the hype. Still, a really good job by Dechutes. Almost a great beer."
"Overall a good beer, & I appreciate Deschutes continually pushing the boundaries of what they're doing, in addition to their excellent standard lineup. Props on them."
"This flanders ale was not as complex as some other beers I've tried but was a welcome treat to have with my meal. Once again Deschutes comes thru with a tasty brew!"
"I was amazed to find this at the local grocery store right when we moved to Davis, Ca...now i've found it everywhere and im not so amazed, but whatever, its still cool. Pours a deep blood red with a nice white head that settles to a thin film while drinking. Smells of tart cherries, sour malt, a Bretty-funkiness, inviting. Taste is subtle, fruity but with a hint of chocolate malt. Not as tart as the odor suggests, but still a touch. Alcohol present but not overwhelming. A nice mouthfeel, approaching full-bodied, at least in so far as the style allows. A syrupy quality, though not too thick. A well-crafted foray into wild ales for Deschutes. Maybe a beer worth aging too."
"Rodenbach Grand Cru is still the benchmark to me, although this is in the ballpark. Actually it bears more resemblance to JP La Roja. The potential is there...it just seems to lack an extra degree of complexity that would make it exceptional. Still a successful experiment that I was happy to enjoy."
"Big ups to BA Urwatuh8 for answering the call once more!"
"The mouthfeel is light and creamy. Drinkability is pretty high. The 11% is well hidden. If I didn't know better, I'd open another bottle."
"D: Pretty easy to drink. The tart and sourness definitely gets up there toward the end but still easy enough to drink."
"D- As I said earlier, The 9% ABV is well-hidden amongst the myriad of flavors contained within this beer. This sits pretty heavy in the stomach, but I enjoyed every drop."
"Pours a dark burgundy, maroon in color. No head forms on the pour. Smell is dark fruit and some tartness. Smell is very nice. Taste is very dark, ripe fruit. There is a good amount of carbonation and a nice tartness as well. This is a surprisingly very good beer. I went in with a bit of reluctance due to the Abyss, but this is a very solid beer. Very nice and well done."
"Crisp burgundy pour with a small tan head. Smell is nice and tart with cherries and granny smith apples, followed by more funk than i expected. Dark fruit and horse blanket finish the complex nose. By far the funkiest flemish red i have ever encountered, and i love it! The taste follows the nose for the most part: Sour cherries and apples, pears, followed by darker, over-ripe berries and plums, finishing with plenty of Brett funk, nicely balancing the sourness up front. More fruit emerges when it warms as the funk slightly subsides. there's some good body to this one with all the funk clinging to the sides of my mouth, but the sour fruit keeps me constantly sipping. this is by far the most complex flemish red ive had so far, and with all the Brett funk, my favorite at this point."
"A clear red tinged mahogony / tawny port appearance. Slight dusting of cream colored head that did not last. Smell and taste are both very reminiscent of Rodenbach Grand Cru and, to a lesser degree, Duchesse. Best descriptor I can give is an Imperial Rodenbach Grand Cru. The aspect of this beer that is most amazing to me, would have to be the ABV. How on earth can this be 11%? The strength of this beer is simply buried by the craftsmanship involved. Quite drinkable, limited only by your tolerance for sweet sours. Most enjoyable."
"fucking awful drainpour."
"Thanks to urwatuh8 for a sweet Deschutes hook up."
"I believe this is a better Flander's ale than Rodenbauchs and it should be served cold."
"Label says best after 11.1.11 and I should have listened to it."
"Truly an awesome beer. I'd put it up against the best Belgians out there."
"Cheers"
"Pours a dark mahogany color and has a thin tan head. The nose is tart up front followed by some sweet malts and a bit of musty funk. The taste is similar. A good amount of sour fruits and big candy malts. I would like to see some more funk in both areas, however there is a unique sweetness that makes up for any loss in funk. Medium body is well carbonated. For a 9% sour, this is quite drinkable. Probably closer to a red than bruin, but still quite good. One of the better American versions of this style I've had. Probably could have used more time in the barrels"
"P.S. this beer is great."
"I liked this beer, not one I would drink on a normal occasion, but it was enjoyable."
"D: This is kind of similar to a Lambic in that it uses wild yeast, but the degree of sourness is VERY mild compared to beers such as Rodenbach and Cantillon. This is a very easy drinking tart beer that sweetens quickly and flows across the palate leaving you completely satisfied. All I can say is I'm glad I bought 6 bottles of this the day it was released. $60 well spent!"
"Rusted brick colored brew with a well lasting white head. Really poor nose. Main complaint is the poor concentration and vibrancy and the aromatic elements that are present are mostly unpleasant, brash and unauthentic. Notes of sweet cherries, vanilla and oak are present in the nose, but mostly covered by the unpleasant aromas. Flavor is initially sweet in the front and mid-palate and then fades into a sour harshness towards the finish. Really poorly balanced and brash. Unauthentic and very hard to drink. Some serious problems with this beer: Sterile filtered and force carbonated, aging a portion in wood for only 3 months (not long enough and age the whole beer.) But the bottom line is the flavor and aroma suck. Blah."
"4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"the 11 percent alcohol doesn't come through that strong for me. delicious and deceptive."
"Can't taste the alcohol. Mouthfeel is decent. The vinegariness so prevalent in this style of beer is very, very muted."
"D: This beer does not hold back any punches. Maybe a good night cap or after dinner beer. I'm not that bright so it took me a little time to get this bottle open though that is pretty irrelevant. This is the first time I have tried this style and it was a welcome change from my norm. I will probably pick up another for long term storage."
"D: Damn. I could throw this down easily. Anytime, anywhere. It drinks smooth, and it drinks way easy. It's delicious, and were it readily available, I would be stocked up on it."
"Might be the first beer from Deschutes I did not enjoy, but I do not seem to have a pallate for sour ales, so I've based my scores on my wife's impressions, as she prefers these types of offerings more than I do."
"Drinkability: For a sour beer, pretty drinkable. BA claims Dissident is 11% ABV. The bottle says 9%. 9 sounds more accurate, based on the drinkability. Regardless, at a minimum, this should be sold in a smaller bottle in addition to the bomber."
"D: If it were cheaper and more available, I would drink it all the time. Highly reccomended."
"One of the best beers I've ever had."
"NOTE: ABV was 9% on the bottle"
"Not a very drinkable beer in my opinion."
"taste is tart, raspberry, sour malt, oak, ends dry and bitter, leaves the mouth tart."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Pours a beautiful deep amber color, with a thin white head that settles fairly quickly, leaving some light lacing. Aroma is an amazing cider vinegar sour, with a hint of a cinnamon. Sour beers can be hit or miss. This one hits it out of the park. I love the sour cider flavor, but the fact that it has some depth to it is what does it for me. Mouthfeel is very crisp, maybe a little thin. Very drinkable, as far as sour beers go. DEFINITELY worth a try."
"Bought from Roths Vista Market,Salem,OR Bright brown beer with a tan head, thats pretty small and bubbly,leaves goodly lace. Marvelous aroma to this one: malty,spicy, fruity( green apple and sour plooms),sour..like fresh lemon juice or good vinegar.Lovelly stuff. Tartness,semi-sweet malts compete..with a building yet gracious sourness building to coat the tongue, soor plooms aagain , and a bite of cooking apple/crab apple.Slight ""barnyard"" and oaky residue . Lovelly and lively on the tongue..great long lasting sourness. Overall a very nice beer. I m far from being even competent in this style..but this was most enjoyable."
"Overall, I like it. It is not the most amazing oud bruin in the world, and the bottles (to be reviewed later) are quite spendy. What is most exciting about this oud bruin to me, is that it is a very fine representation of the style, (despite the high abv) and it is brewed in america. I am glad we are starting to see some breweries getting some good flemish style ales on the market. It shows much promise for the future of american brewing, as far as the somewhat more obscure belgian styles. A good beer, and a solid representation of the style (aside from the beefed up abv!) haha."
"Boozy and astringent, though still decently complex and fruity. Not as enjoyable as the previous release."
"I think this one will hold up well, and even improve, with some time in the cellar. definitely worth seeking out and trying."
"D - For the style this is pretty drinkable. The alcohol content will prevent you from drinking a large volume of this stuff and the flavor doesn't seem to fade too much with the quantity consumed. A bomber is about perfect."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer that will undoubtedly get better and better as the years pass."
"I had a bottle with a steak (Flanders style beers are my favorite pairing with steak), and it fared rather well, but still needed more acidity to match the fat."
"As a sour beer fan, this really hits the spot. I will be promptly acquiring a case of this and visiting the brewpub as frequently as possible. I assure you of that!"
"Good enough that shell out more than few greenbacks for a case of bottles."
"D - This would be an excellent dessert beer to pair with a hearty cheese or a nut based dessert (walnuts or cashew). A solid effort and a great beer by Deschutes, though I felt they went a little nuts on the yeast and could have left more of a cherry flavor."
