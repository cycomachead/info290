"Much better options out there, this one fell flat for me."
""
""
""
"o: not as fruity as i would like, but still an excellent sour beer"
""
""
"sour lemon/apple  aroma.   Light refreshing base with  good acidity level. tart green apple flavor"
""
""
"I later found this brew at a local store and it beckons me from time to time. A mistress in a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wanted to like it due to all the great reviews it has, however i personally found it rather unpalatable. Slightly sweet, mostly bitter, odd fizz, tart smell (similar to Prosecco or Champagne)"
"Taste caught me off guard, it's definitely an acquired one. Personally not for me but glad I tried it."
""
""
"Mouthfeel somewhat light, but really nice drinking al in all."
""
""
""
"Starts with a lemony, citrusy tart nose with traces of vinegar. It pours a rich gold, sour on the nose, 1” head dissipates to a film, leaves fine lace. Big lemony palate supported by traces of light fruit sweetness balancing between plum and cherry and a hint of vanilla. Slight oak astringency and a hop accent on the finish."
""
""
"Overall - A great little beer, that probably serves as a nice gateway to sours, the smell and taste profile on this are awesome, and I'm wishing I had picked up a couple more. In fact this is good enough to warrant a beer run all on its own."

"Final Grade: 4.39, a very solid A grade. I do not have any previous experience with this specific style of beer, nor would I consider myself a big fan of sours in general - but Petrus Aged Pale is quite possibly my favourite sour so far. The funky acidity and the tannins from the barrel result in an eminently quaffable, unique little brew that has gone a long way towards changing my opinion of sours. A good 'gateway sour', due to the affordable price point and approachable flavour profile - I will definitely make sure to procure a few more bottles of this for the cellar, since I don't expect this to remain available in Ontario indefinitely."
""
"I'm burping acid a little bit."
""
"O - Very reminiscent of well made, acidic white wine.  Can't say whether or not the oak aging did much for the flavor, but I would certainly purchase this again regardless.   Enjoyable to sip on and appreciate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A great beer.for those who like complex white wines. A solid mix of sour, oak barrel, fruit, and funk."
""
""
""
"Tart Apple goodness with a bit of oak. Dry as hell and keeps you wanting more. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
"One of only a couple of beers that was poured down the drain."
"Overall this was a good beer, but it wasn't everything I was hoping for. The taste was good, but I would tweak it a bit as described above. Also, I would like more of a pale ale aspect to this beer.  If you want a sour pale ale, get Jolly Pumpkin's Luciernaga instead of this. If you don't care about the pale ale aspect, this beer will be cheaper than Luciernaga. Also, after looking it up, this beer is classified by BA as a Flanders Oud Bruin, whereas Luciernaga is a Belgian Pale. I guess that explains the differences."

"Really good, but not sure if champaign or beer lol"
"Great sour beer that's easy to get."
""
""
""
"Flowery with a hint of apple.  Sour apple maybe?  Very sour with a slight lingering tartness."
"Very good, delicious, sour beer"
"Golden pour with moderate head. A fruity sour with slight citrusy tart aftertaste with hints of apple."
""
""
""
""
"Was too tiring to drink. Not a bad beer but not my thing. Had a touch of woody taste after getting past the sour acidity."

"Very Brett foward. It's not my favorite because I like my sours to be a little more tart but I can appreciate this one."

"Petrus Aged Pale is in a league of it's own.  It's a perfect sour ale retaining the quality flavors of a pale ale while still having the great sour flavors.  It I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life this one might be it."
"Food Pairings: Dirty grapes and chicken. WhamBam!"

"75ml corked bottle. Exceptionally smooth and drinkable for a sour ale. Lightly hazy, medium golden with light airy head. Soft, but full, fruity, cider aroma. Taste is fizzy, light, mildly acidic, malt, cider, wood. This one has me rethinking sour ales, most of which are too tart for my palate."
""
"Overall, I'd highly recommend whether or not you are just interested in trying new styles of beer, or are already a sour fan."
"Great sour. Lots of wood character"
""
""

"My wallet is going to hate me soon trying more sours."
""
"Overall is tasty, complex, refreshing. Keeps me coming back for more. Wish there were other notes than the apple, kind of dominates the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is interesting, keeps the beer from being too easy drinking. Will have to try more sours."

""
""

"When I want sour, this would be a great go-to beer.  Perfect on a hot summers day.  A little too sour for me to drink in large quantities, but so refreshing.  I think that this is a great representative of the style."

"O- Very nice sour.  Much better than the rest in the ""sour power"" sixer."

"Poured from a 330 into a standard pint (the tulip was dirty and I was lazy). The light haze in the gold was lovely. The aroma offered a hint of the sour to come with some citrussy character from a hoppy beer. But the taste was just a wonderful level tartness that was like nothing I had encountered. This is the beer that set me off on a long run of sours. It is therefore my benchmark since it was my first sour. I may revise once I have had more from this style, but this will be a repeat purchase."

"Bright and tart.  Undecided if this is likable and need to consider others in the same style.   Certainly drinkable and with the bracing acidity would work well with food."
""
""
""
"Beautiful. Tart yet immensely drinkable. Great with all types of food. I keep coming back to this beer time after time and it never disappoints. In fact, as I'm writing this my mouth is water just thinking about this golden brew. Give this classic a try if you haven't already."

"On draft at Monk's Cafe in Philly. I tried this head-to-head with the Monk's Flemish Sour Ale. Although this was a very good Oud Bruin, it paled in comparison the the Monk's version. Very session able and may have received a higher rating if I had it on a different session but much weaker in taste and higher in alcohol. Basically the light version of the Monk's Flemish with higher ABV. Personally, I rate based on flavor, not for speed of inebriation."

"O: 4.25 This beer is easy to get and very pleasing if you’re looking to satisfy a sour craving. There are a lot of really nice flavors and a good tartness level. Not quite up there with some of the popular gueuze offerings, but a solid alternative."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And that's where the ale fleets the palate with abrupt dryness- clean, crisp and sudden. Far sooner than the palate would prefer, the taste evaporates in a whimsical cloud that overs above the tongue. Much of its wonderment is better appreciated in a wheaty, vinous aftertaste, full of oak tanning than it is in actual time."
""
"O - This is an affordable and remarkable sour beer. It is a great example of the style. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."

"Overall my go to sour. Always delivers and always available at a decent price. A little skunkiness with this bottle I haven't had on the others. Been sitting on the shelf a little too long"

""
""
"O- a refreshing beer with some nice clean sourness and just a touch of funk. Not overly complex but an enjoyable summer sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Petrus Aged Pale poured into a pint glass. A lighter looking sour that could pass for many types of good ales.  Smell is fantastic as the tart sour really comes through.  A lighter sour, oaky taste that is very quenchable. Great for a summer day.  Great beer though I prefer something a bit bolder.  But for what it is and what it is trying to be it is very good."

"I have had this beer several times before and I would consider it a classic at this point. It has a great reputation in the Belgian beer world and it truly deserves it. Kind of like a Belgian Berliner in a way but much more than that at the same time. Lactic acid brilliance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with thin white head; quarter inch sticks around with spotty lacing. Smell: barnyard, apricot, majorly acetic, grainy, vinous. Taste: white grape, white peach, all tart, mild pale malt sweetness, herbal finish with plenty of drying oak character. Body is a little thin, but nice flavors though a bit one-note on the tartness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Very dry and sour beer that may reind you more of a wine than a beer. I think it comes together well and would recommend it."

"Perhaps a perfect introduction to sour beers?"
""
""
"Little to no head and slight lacing on this well carbonated brew, smelling a bit of vinegar and wood. Wonderful vinegar tartness. Easily one of the better sour brews I've had - it's well balanced. Great introductory tart brew for newbies. Dangerously drinkable for 7.3%."
""
"O: great sour. Very sour. Acidic. Great representation of style. Will purchase again."
""
"Overall, I wouldn't need to revisit this offering very often."

"Overall- Good to really good, but mostly really good. Isn't the most complex sour I've ever had but I do enjoy that this is rather smooth for a sour. This worth a try and I could see myself drinking this in the future. I probably won't buy it anytime soon but I would drink this again in the right setting."

"330ml bottle. Wide Flute glass. Gold color, crystal clear appearance. White froth creates a close crown & leaves a wide ring on sides. Well balanced aroma profile displays sour citric & wood notes, spices & sugary hues on the backside. Gentle malty upfront is blowed up by sharp & intense tartar flavor. Light body. Soft carbonation. Spiced, dense & sour palate. Fruity touches in the middle resolve in a kind astringency from lemon & grapefruit rounded by memories of grape tannins. Long sour finish yields to a fruity & spiced aftertaste. ABV is just felt as a gentle heat through the throat. Refreshing & flavorful."

"O - 4.25 - It's good. Nice and sour. The cool thing about this beer is it's a basic, sour beer, without added fruit and without being a darker beer, so you really get the sour characteristics by themselves. The downside is basically the same thing - it's just sour, and perfectly sour, but not that complex."
"O: A very good sour pale ale. This is one that I will regularly reach for when I'm looking for a cheap and relatively available sour beer."
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a Belgian goblet. My first crack at this style, which is rather difficult to find in these parts. Hoping that more examples turn up. This sour is a golden orange amber hue with ample beige foam; features larger bubbles than the Flanders reds from Rodenbach I have sampled. Smells very carbolic, like white wine vinegar, along with zesty lemon juice and a tannic woodiness. Taste is a fascinating blend of aggressive sour and caramel sweetness ... There's a gentle sweet backbone of vanilla nougat, dairy-based confectionery, carob, and raisins with a hint of dried banana chip, with all this lurking beneath another tart factor that recalls sour gummy candies, unripe cherry, pomegranate molasses, green apple, tangerine peel, and grainy vinegar. To my palate the sourness is about on par with Rodenbach Grand Cru, maybe even a hair more, with a thin body and rather prickly carbonation. Finishes dry, acidic, and woody. A tasty introduction to the style and to sours more generally."

"N: You couldn't session this beer, but why would you? Its something you bring out to change things up. It is so tart to start, but then it mellows. Would go well with a tangy cheese and some classical music. This is a beer to be sipped and savored."
""
""
"O – Complexity may not be the central characteristic of this beer, but the tanginess, tartness and white wine flavours imparted to this beer from its oak aging are clean, crisp and neatly done. This is a beer elegant and assured in its simplicity, and one which I hope will serve as an excellent launch point for exploring sour and wild ales moving forward."

"Beer is gold/yellow-orange with a slightly orange tinted white head about 1.75 girl fingers high. Lace is patchy around the edges. Aroma is tangy and sweet. Lemon, tart cherries and stinky fermented red cherries, white wine, tea, raspberries, green grapes, and a clean light malt sweetness. Taste is tart throughout. Puckering to an extent but not more tart than other sour beers. Very light sweetness underneath flavors of musky berries, white wine, and green grape skins. Very dry, almost chalky mouthfeel. It makes your mouth water. Drinkability is solid. Goes down easy but you're compelled to space sips out because of the entertaining tartness."

"A very good sour and I’m glad I finally tried it. Would be interested in trying some other Petrus beers."
""
""
""
"Bottled dated 2011. Pours golden blonde with a decent amount of bubbly head that's there and gone in a heartbeat. Sour citrus burns a hole through my mucus membranes; not particularly what I'd expect from an oud bruin. Deep whiffs draw out barrel-tinged malts and grapefruit. On the tongue it's sharp, sour and acidic with a wonderful finish. A fine brew for heartburn enthusiasts. Sour grapefruit, juicy apples, lemon peel and a hint of cherry. It's heavily carbonated and goes down easy, though ""smooth"" is the last adjective I'd attach to this one. I think this beverage is doing serious damage to my stomach lining. Otherwise, sure, it's a good sour. Nothing out of this world, but a very drinkable brew."

"O- a puckering sipper that has some nice fruity flavors, complimented by some nice barrel notes. My favorite from Petrus"
""

"O: Very enjoyable but probably too sour to enjoy more than one of these in a session. Nice flavors and acidic prickliness."
""
""
""

"A surprisingly incredible beer."
"O. A great sour. Easy to come by, the apple taste overall not as great as the wine barrel aged sours but good. Price, availability makes it a winner."

"Petrus Aged Pale ---4/5."
"A nice offering for a 12 ounce tart brew. Pours a crystal clear straw with little head. Smells of tart apples. Dominant flavors are tart apple with some lemon zest. Crisp dry mouthfeel keeps me coming back for more. A bit expensive, but worthy of trying and fairly accessible to the masses."
""
""
""
""
"O- Great for building the palate up to more complexed sours but more easily attainable than others. This is a beer that helped introduce me to a style I'd otherwise ignore. Thank you Petrus and may I somehow receive one of your wooden casks."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm basically a sour noob but for what it's worth I really liked this one. The amount of tartness in the flavor was higher than I've had recently and it made for an enjoyable drinking experience. I got Petrus Aged Pale as part of the sour power mixed pack and it was a worthwhile purchase that I'd recommend to anyone interested in the experimenting with the style for the first time. Would I drink it again? Yes."

"Great beer!"

"Overall a very tasty sour. It lacks a lot of complexity but the beer is so crisp and bright on the tongue that it more than makes up for it. It is also refreshing that the beer is not overly barnyard or funky."

"-Overall a very decent sour. It is able to satisfy a sour craving, but does lack complexity. This is a great introductory sour as there is nothing too offense or bold or funky. Also, it is readily available and affordable at $4/bottle, I like to keep a few of these around for a refreshing weeknight delight."

"Petrus pours a primarily clear golden color, with some hints of bronze. There's a thin ring of pure white sitting on top. The aroma was an excellent bouquet of floral and fruit scents, with a slight suggestion of funky yeast as well. The taste revealed the benefits of aging with a pleasant earthiness, and a tasty cider sourness. Very tart and wine-like. Moderate body with a dry mouth feel. I would have loved to have a nice cheese plate with this... maybe next time. Order this when you can fully appreciate it's delicate beauty... this is one fine sour."

"Excellent stuff - perhaps the best offering from this brewery. Despite not seeming too bottle-conditioned, I feel this would develop very well in the bottle over time. It's interesting to see a Belgian pale turned upside down and becoming a refreshing and complex offering as a sour beer. The oak and yeast are the stars here, but that Belgian sweetness (which can get grating) is far different here, and resembling actual off-dry fruit rather than something more mundane. Recommended, but don't go out of your way to get the Sour Power pack just to get 2 bottles. At $4 a bottle elsewhere, however, this is a good bargain indeed."

"Overall, a very tasty beer that's lighter in character than most oud bruins that I've had the pleasure to sample. It makes it a little more refreshing, but also a little bit one-note in my opinion."

"11.2oz bottle. Pours a golden yellow, sparkling almost champagne like with a small white head. Aroma is of Belgian yeast, biscuit malt with ripe fruity notes. Taste is mildly tart and sour with some Belgian yeast, has a kind of sour fruit slightly vinegary white wine. Palate is a medium body with mild carbonation and sweet tart sourness on the tongue. Finish same as taste with some faint notes of malt on the end gives it slight balance. Overall a bit on the sour side yet a drinkable brew none the less."
""
""
"Finally getting to try this old acquaintance from back east once again. It pours a clear lemon-straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises tart lemon zest, a pinch of coriander, and some rather light and demure cracked wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, with the even tarter lemon dominating all else in a pleasant WarHeads type of way. The body is a rather light medium, with a light carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a tasty sour treat, something you don't necessarily come across every day, but something you wouldn't mind indulging in that often."

"O: A nice acetic-focused pale ale. Hits the spot when I'm in the mood."

"Poured from a bottle into a tulip, the beer is an extremely bright, straw gold coloring with a thin, filmy white head that starts around half an inch, but settles into a ring on the surface. Aromas are tart and sweet, robust and forward, with notes of apple, toasted grains, and subtle woody highlights. Mouth watering nose. Flavors are bold and tart, with an underlying roasted character, almost char-like. Toasty grain/bread notes noticeable initially, but they are quickly swallowed up by the sour characteristics, with a tangy sweetness that keeps the drinkability high. The aftertaste is more of the woody and char characteristics, but with a solid ribbon of tart still present. Clean, smooth finish with a slight puckering. Very drinkable throughout. Solid brew."

"The taste is most definitely a sour ale. Alcohol is well integrated, Don't try to sugar-coat it or anything it will come up just the same. So as far as sour ales go this really meets or exceeds to style. It really is not my favorite style so it is difficult to review. Sour ale fans will like this one."
""
""
"Overall: Fairly new to the style but I like this as an introduction. I don't know if I'm getting acid reflux or if it's just the beer in my throat. Excellent on the first day of summer. Not overly complex but being fairly new I'm still getting used to the sour. You know you always seem them on the shelf, pick one up already."

"Poured from the 11.2 ounce bottle into a Petrus chalice. Cider-like aroma; one finger of foam, quickly dissipates; golden color; super dry and definitely more tart than the Oud Bruin? I swear this reminds me of my homemade cider (which I wish were this good); bet this would be grand with brunch; i definitely like it; what other treasures does this brewery have?"

"Awesome beer here, and what's even better is that you can easily pick this stuff off of most shelves around town. Definitely a brew that's sour and funky enough to please long-time fans of the style, while remaining mild and tame enough to not scare newcomers away. Reasonably priced for the quality and amount as well; one of the better examples of blonde Belgian sours that are easy to obtain."
""
""
"O: If this is what I can expect from a strong/good ""sour"" then they might not be my favorite. I prefer kind of a sweet tartness or a very carbonated one like a kombucha. I like stuff closer to Rodenbach Classic. Not for me and I love apple cider."

"This is probably one of the most unique beers I've had. It's a pale yellow, not unlike Hoegaarden. The taste comes on strong and kicks you in the tongue with sourness, but it's not unpleasant. As you drink more the sourness subsides and flavors of orange and tang are left. Is a beer that appeals to different areas of the tongue. It also displays flavors of oak due to the aging. So we have flavors of oak, orange, sour, green wood, and hops to bring it all together. And it's tame enough to drink non-stop. Fantastic"
""
""

"Overall: will revisit this after I gain a bit more experience with the style. Very interesting."

"Overall: A very puckering, sour ale that certainly scratches that sour itch, if you're having a craving. Unfortunately the sourness is a bit one note and doesn't have a big funky brett presence to embellish it. It is a solid, somewhat easily attainable sour that doesn't necessarily ""wow"" a seasoned sour drinker."

"Poured one finger of head on a clear, golden colored body. The smell is all sour, but in a nice way. The taste has moderate bitterness followed by a strong sour flavor; good balance. The texture is crisp with moderate carbonation. Quite an interesting ale with some great flavors that you don't see much of. It was cider-like in texture and taste but less sweet."

"O:The appearance and smell for this beer are good but not great the taste and feel however do achieve greatness. It is very drinkable for its higherish abv and maintains a great sour flavor I could drink these for days and normally I reach a limit with sour beers this I wish came by the six pack. I highly recommend you try this especially if you like sours."

"As much as I appreciate the artistry and craft involved in making this beer, it was hard to drink. A sour beer of this caliber is no easier to drink than a fine scotch; sipping is the best way to approach. The color is a dull without being hazy, the nose a tart lactic, acidic burn. The taste followed the nose with a sour, acidic bile flavor masking the taste of malts and hops. Hints of vanilla, ""greenness"" and wood are undetectable under the acid burn. Sweet caramel and grain show up in the aftertaste and comes on after the sour acid fades away. The mouthfeel is as thin as would be expected, with a carbonated bite that helps the flavor along. All in all, this is a beer that I highly appreciate, and have no desire to drink again."

"Purchased on-tap at HotShots Family Entertainment Center in beautiful downtown Pismo Beach CA on a rainy Thursday evening. This selection was a fine nightcap, a palette cleanser after an evening of drinking heavy, syrupy beers (Parobla, Ovila Quad, Black Marlin Porter). This sour was simple and sufficient - a pleasure to be what ended our drinking evening."
""
""
"O: This one definitely delivers the sour, puckering bite to it - and at a decent price, to boot! I really wish it was fruitier, but that's just nitpicking. I'd definitely consider making this one a go-to sour for me."
""
""
"A good easy drinking beer."
""
"Nectar of the gods. Amazingly balanced sour beer! Will grab many more for aging and drinking!"
"Poured from tap into tulip at 1702 in Tucson. Pours a straw color with nice fizzy head that lasts. Lots of funk and tart Belgian aromas. Same for taste...nicely tart fruity Belgian yeast and grape like. Super refreshing and nicely drinkable. Nice brew...good amount of sour/tart."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"I poured a golden-looking beer, which, unfortunately, had a poor retention in my example here. The aroma is intriguing: apricots and barnyard-like tones associated with brettanomyces, as well as other acid-producing bacteria. The light, crisp body leaves a relatively long aftertaste showcasing, of course, the tartness and the wood-aged taste that this beer conveyed during the whole sampling."
""
"Again, not sure if it was the beer or the pourer."

"330 ml bottle, the last one in a box of six different Petrus beers. Poured into a snifter. ABV 7,3%. Colour is deep copper, with quite an activity in the glass. On top of the beer sits a big white head, almost three fingers, soapy and thick, with good retention.Aroma is of grapes, sweet-sour, some citrus notes in it. Very high acidity on the taste, this one screams sour! Again, lots of white grapes on the taste. After my initial big gulp, where I almost choke from the acidity, I started drinking it with slow small sips and it’s quite good. Full body and average carbonation. A combination of dryness and tartness on the palate. Still not very experienced on this style, but I liked this one. Reminded me of a homemade wine an uncle of mine was making, so maybe it’s also the memories, but this beer was quite enjoyable and I guess it would be even better with a meal."

"o: This stuff was so sour it gave me a stomach ache. Threw the last 1/4 of it out. I hated it that much. It tasted like sparkling grape juice that had gone bad. Paid $4 for a bottle would have rather thrown it in the street."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This was by far the most sour beer I’ve ever tasted – including lambics. It made my taste buds cry. This is a sipping beer – it took me and hour to drink it. At first I was overwhelmed by the sour tartness – but every sip was more pleasurable and by the end I realize how complex this brew was. Could I drink this every night – no way – but this is a beer to be savored."
""
"Do not buy this"
"Taste is nicely soured, with green apple tones most prominent. I get no trace of the oak barrels that this was aged in. Instead, it's a wild and tangy tart fruit vibe with a slight warming finish. A delicious treat."

"Overall, a really affordable and light sour that offers a lot of flavor. Nothing about it stands out particularly and it is definitely not that complex. Really nice starter sour with some nice flavors. Would drink again, but not really that memorable."
""
""
"O/D-I sat looking at their Petrus Oud Bruin and this beer side by side in the store. I picked the Petrus Oud Bruin before this...bad choice bro! This is a far superior brew. Sour, complex and relatively easy on the wallet. ..wait this is the same style of beer as their Oud Brune? This one is better, guy."

"The balance here is absolutely outstanding, as two rather bold and disparate elements meld almost seamlessly. I had a difficult time dissecting this beer because the flavor is so cohesive. The fact that an oak-aged sour ale can be so eminently drinkable is impressive. This Aged Pale is flavorful, balanced, and has an admirable staying power, all of which have earned this beer a place among my all time favorites. It's also the first great beer I can remember trying, long before I knew anything about what great beer really is."
"O - Decent Flanders Brown, not overly impressed, but not bad."
"M: Medium bodied. Lots of carbonation. Lightness from wood aging."
""
""
""
"O: This tastes like how the style is described but it just isn't for me. I'll give another one a try at some point but I won't be seeking one of these out again soon."
"O - A nice beer, but not what I was expecting. From the description, I thought this would be a hoppy pale ale with some ""aged beer"" characteristics. In reality I got no hint of wood aging, and no malt to balance the wild yeast fermentation flavors. It is much more sour than I was expecting, but now that I know, I can appreciate its oud gueuze-like character."
"O: This is a pretty good sour, but its for sure not overwhelming like I was hoping. I prefer my sours to be pretty intense, but this is nice for just sitting around and not getting that intenseness."

"Overall: As an introductory sour beer, this is one of the best, and I should know, I am a beginner to the style. It is not so sour as to render it undrinkable or to shock the taster, but it is sour enough to recall what is so appealing about sourness in the first place. As the beer warms, the oak comes out a lot more and adds some much needed complexity that I noted as lacking. I would not say I am hooked on sours yet, but this definitely intrigued me further. A word of warning (probably regarding all sours): though the ABV is relatively low and the drinkability is high, this is probably still a sipper, as the sour flavors can be overpowering both to the palate and the stomach if ingested too quickly. 15.5/20"
""
""
""
""
"Champagne mouthfeel everyone keeps mentioning is VERY evident. Lacked a real malt character though. Quite sour, but in a pleasant way. Lots of sour fruit: apples, cherries, bananas. Some clove also evident. Great Brett/pedio nose. Can't beat the price either. If you're just starting out with sour beers, this is a great one to check out."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottle code 40266. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy white head with nice retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass; good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge sour cherry, apple, lemon zest, hay, grass, earth, pepper, clove, light vinegar, leather, funk, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance. Taste of tart green apple, lemon zest, cherry, earth, hay, grass, funk, pepper, oak, light vinegar, and yeast spiciness. Good amount of tartness present on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, hay, grass, earth, pepper, funk, vinegar, oak, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Excellent balance and complexity of flavors; nice tartness/sweetness balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a crisp and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent sour ale! Great balance and complexity of flavors; very smooth and crisp to drink. Highly enjoyable offering I will definitely have again."

"Poured from an 11.2oz glass into a goblet. The pour is lively, with plenty of carbonation, almost champagne-like. Aroma is of unripe fruits, cherry, apple, some grape. Not much in the aroma in terms of the oak casks, although I did get some vanilla in there. Taste is quite sour, particularly on the front end. Some more balanced sweetness comes out in the finish. Light mouthfeel, really like a sparkling wine almost. Overall, I really enjoyed it!"
""
"It's worth a try."
""
"Clear golden color with some scant wisps of cream above. Acidic, sour fruity aromas...notes of apple, grape, citrus, and some of that barnyard funk. Flavors of sour, tart fruit met with a gentle sweetness, lactic acid, grape, cherry, and light citrus. Not much character from the wood, from what I can tell. Dry, medium-light bodied. Not sure about the Oud Bruin classification, though I understand this is the ""mother beer"" used to blend other Petrus beers. Regardless, this is tasty, sour stuff."
""
""
"Poor Petrus Aged Pale. This beer resides in a sad equilibrium - not extreme enough for the hardcore sour lovers, but far too sour for the casual beer fan looking for something new. Those of us looking for a great, expertly crafted sour will find plenty of to love here. Petrus Aged Pale pours out a golden color with a small head. The aroma is tart and vinous, with some oak and cherry rounding everything out. The taste is excellent. It's tart and sharp at first, with a great apple and cherry bite. It's very acidic for sure, but doesn't come off as being too far down that line. I'd like to credit that to the oak-aging, taking a bit of the bite off with just a small contribution to flavor. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is excellent. Overall, a superb sour beer that's readily available and accessible."

"This is a decent beer, but comes across more as a tart white wine than a beer. I enjoyed it, but in the end the flavor left me wanting something more. It’s definitely worth a try nonetheless."

""
"Possibly one of the best sour beers I've tried. Beautiful color and carbination. For such an easy to drink sour excited it's about 7.5%. For being labeled oak aged I didn't pick up that note..perhaps because of the sourness being so powerful. I do wish this beer was more accessible to get."
""
"O: nice sourness, good flavor, and not as overly sweet as some examples. Excellent balance of sourness in place of bitterness with the residual sweetness. An excellent example of the style."

"Overall, I like it and would get it again possibly, although I prefer Rodenbach Grand Cru and there are a ton of other sours I want to try before I will feel a need to revisit."
""
"Poured a day after its best-by date (sorry, but it does purport to be aged) into a tulip glass, which turned into a gorgeous amber globe unsedimented, translucent liquid under just a scrim of ivory lace. The smell reached me immediately, well before lifting glass to nose: sawdust, as if from sandalwood or some other aromatic specimen, (and on further study) spice aromas, orange blossom, vegetal-chocolate notes, some toast. (It would be top score if only if it were a bit stronger.) Dryness and astringency rush in with the taste, giving much more feel before flavors emerge. Those are of a subtle sweetness of citrus and yellow fruits, a bit of cinnamon toast. I'd love to try this with some spicy food, a soft cheese -- lots of different possibilities."
""
"O: Sour fan Nirvana, this is a clean and intense sour beer with an awesome aroma. I haven't had a more sour beer that this and I'm loving it."

"O-I enjoyed this quite a bit. This was a unique, complex, and drinkable sour beer that didn't just pucker up with the usual cherry flavors. Ask me after I have another bottle if I still enjoy the strange, buttery finish, but for now, bravo."
""
""
"Happy to bring one of these home from DeCicco's in Brewster, NY, this sour brew is a pale golden yellow color with a decent white film on top and nice, random lacing. The aroma brings granny apple sweet and sour with slight fermentation and juniper evident. The flavor pretty much zeros out with sour apple and lemon lime bite over a struggling biscuit. There’s some doughy yeast of course, over thin sharp carbonation in this light bodied, tingly brew. Beautiful."
""
"O= This is actually a nice brew. I usually don't care for Oud Bruins because they are to acetic for me. This is an exception. A nice mix of Acetic and Lactic to make a balanced tasty sour."

"Overall- I'm not sorry I tried it (well, maybe sausage for dinner a few hours ago was a bad pairing, I deserve the heartburn), but I probably won't be picking it up again. It's certainly complex, and I enjoy the bold flavor, but it's simply too acidic and (somehow) cloying at the same time for me to want to spend over $.25/oz. On the other hand, it kind of reminds me of warhead sour candy, which is... something?"
""
"O - A pretty good sour. It was a tad too acidic for me. But the flavor of the cherries and woody ale like finish were a delight to drink. Not for everyone, but a must for those that like sours or like to try various types."
"O - Good example of the style and farily easy to get."
"D - Extremely drinkable!"
"O:  Tart and crisp. One beer that I prefer to have cold to reduce the puckering tartness. A enjoyable sipper that I wouldn't wan to have too many of.  Due to the price and availability I probably will not have this too often. A nice change of pace from the normal beer that I drink. Cheers! "

"Overall - Really overboard sour, to the point to were only sour fans should try. The oak flavor sneaks in at the finish but relaly, this is striaght up vinegar sour. No balance, no spices or sweet fruits. Only for sour fans."

"O: I rarely associate a beer's smell with a place or event but this one does it spot on for me. I am not a big fan of the ""sour-styles", but even I think this one is pretty daggum good. This one will definitely be enjoyed again."
""
"Overall, I think I've found a new go-to beer. A solid, interesting Belgian ale."
"Overall. Nice beer that's complex and sour enough to keep me interested through the 750, but easy drinking enough to polish it off a bit too fast ;-)"
""
"On first taste, you get a bit of the wood flavor from the cask along with a nice sour citrus tang and biscuit malt. The aftertaste leaves a muted sour tang and a little of the wood flavor.

""
""
""
"Pours a hazy shimmering gold with a one and half finger clean white head. The mildly pungent nose is dominated by oak. Mildly tart and slightly sour throughout, oaky up front, mildly fruity and juicy with a touch of balancing sweetness midpalate, and finishes dry with more oak. This brew is incredibly refreshing and extremely well balanced. A true classic!"
""
"Overall: The first beer in a while that made me say, ""wow."" Really spectacular. Utterly drinkable and refreshing."

"O: Admittedly this is my first experience with the Flanders Oud Bruin style, and I am relatively new to the sours genre, but wow was I impressed by this.  I'm very glad this was recommended to me.  I would certainly buy this again and I look forward to trying more of the style."

"Overall: Nice beer just wasnt a fan of the aftertaste. Everything else with this beer was pretty solid."

""
""
""
"O: A very unique beer and one that couldn't be had in a session environment. Palate and tartness aside, the ABV is rather high, but well-masked at 7.3% ABV, and the yeast would likely wreak havoc with your gut flora after a while. I'm not racing to have it again, but it was a different nightcap that usual."
""
"Taste is also a lot like apple cider, but a very sour one. And a bit bitter. I can't really pick up the oak or earthy characters over the sour, fruitiness of it. Guess cuz I'm a noob to this style. Delicious for something so sour and appley, though. It would make an excellent cider."
""
"I can't believe I've not tried this beer before, I either didn't notice it, or it just wasn't available for a long period. This is a fine Flanders style ale, with a clean, focused sourness, and drinkablility through the roof. I would have to say it looks to be quite underrated."
""
""
""
"Overall very nice. The high alcohol really takes away from a otherwise near perfect beer. The oak is a little odd. It has some complimentary notes but is also a little off. Overall a rather nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5/5): Petrus Aged Pale is simply an excellent sour ale. I was not sure how it would distinguish itself from a Flanders Red like Rodenbach Grand Cru. Most notably, Aged Pale has a lot less of the red wine-like character Rodenbach possesses. It separates itself with its evident wood notes and tart fruit flavors, matched with an excellent effervescence. Go out and buy this beer."
"O- would it be out of bounds for me to say this reminds me of a good, tart cider? Because it does, in color, aroma, and flavor. Excellent beer, and at five bucks a bottle (at a Philly bottle shop, nonetheless), it's affordable too"
""

"O. This is a nice summer morning beer. Almost like a mimosa. The lemon is very strong. No more than a 6 oz pour is necessary, else it's simply too much. Has some good qualities, but only in moderation."

"O- A bit too sour for my blood."
"It may be felt that I'm being harsh with my rating but it needs to be taken into account that even fans of the style are calling this one amazingly sour, and that if it's sent to mass market with that level of acidity it's not going to appeal to everyone. I consider myself adventurous but this wasn't for me at all."
""
"kind of a weird sour ale, because it is quite hoppy as well. thats a combination i havnt seen a lot of. pours a hazy pale color equal parts orange and yellow. average size white head. smells like a mix between a hoppe american pale ale and a flemish sour without any of the cherry or other fruit flavors. flavor is really potent and different. english style bitter hops and a malt vinegar sour finish, some woody notes carrying all the way through. feel is good, light on the body but heavy on the flavor. medium carbonation works well. overall a pretty cool beer, not at all conventional, quite drinkable, and worthy of special occasions. nice one!"
"Overall opinion is that this was a great example of a sour and does offer some complexity, however there are better sours for your investment and enjoyment."

"O: Holy cow. This stuff will put hair on your chest. This was my first sour, and I'm pretty sure I'm not going to venture into this realm. I was hoping to get hooked on sours since I'm getting sick of big stouts and hop bombs, but I guess not. I can see why people would like this, but it's not my cup of beer."

"O: Wow, this bottle took me by surprise! First of all it's only $3.99 for an 11.2 oz bottle, which is incredibly cheap for a sour. Secondly it's so sour! That automatically makes it good in my book. There is some sweetness to be sure though to balance."

"This beer pours a light bodied slightly cloudy unpolished gold in color with a slight and quickly dissipating half finger bright white head. The nose is both slightly sweet and slightly tart. It's kind of difficult to describe. It's almost slightly lactic and slightly citric. It has a touch of granny smith apple as well as a touch of lemon and moderate funk. It's not too sour or tart for beginners and is very approachable, like most blonde sours. It has a moderate amount of carbonation and leaves a nice acidic tartness behind in the aftertaste. I like it. I'm especially glad that it's both available and affordable. I would recommend trying this if you haven't already."

"Having learned my lesson with their Blonde, I used a VERY gentle pour so as not to disturb any lees that may have settled to the bottom. As a result, I got no head, but I ended up with a very clear, deep-golden beer, much like filtered apple juice. The nose had a tartness like sour cherries and my mouth puckered and my tongue began to water. I am not a fan of sour beers, but I can appreciate them and this seemed like it was going to be good. My first sip gave off a vinegar tartness initially, then kicked in with green apples, wood and finally sour cherries. Wow! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a good bit of effervescence present. I can promise you that I would not enjoy a steady diet of this, but as an occasional foray into something other than AIPAs, this was nice. Finish was gaspingly dry, vinous, really. My my my."
"Overall, this is a nice treat, but for the price, there's some more similar options I think I'd opt for. I wouldn't mind getting this again by any means though."

"Maybe it's the beer, or maybe it's the style..but theres not much to this one. And not to look down on it for not being complex, it's just that nothing stands out. It's a sipper of a sour, alcohol is hidden well and has a good amount of sour notes. The lack of anything exciting in this beer will prevent me from picking up another bottle any time soon."

"O: a real nice ale - tart and tight, crisp and refreshing"
"Could be a good intro to wild ales. It's ""not complex enough," but this is in comparison to other really deep and amazing wild ales. It's a satisfying beer."
"Mouthfeel is good- medium light body and moderately carbonated. Because of the complexity of the smell and flavor, and the tartness, this is a beer to drink slowly for sure. I might buy one to see how it ages..."

"One finger white head, pretty quick dissipation resulting in thin broken layer with ring around edge of glass, opening resulted in numerous streams of uprising carbonation that quickly subsided resulting in medium amber hazy body and several streams rising up near sides of glass. IMO a bit light colorwise for style, not sure this fits into Oud Bruin category, more of a gone to funk Belgian Pale. Funky nose, certainly indicative of the sourness to come.a bit of light horseblanket and some grassiness. Taste is sour forward balanced by some tartness on the backend, peach sweet tarts, floral hops on the back end. . Mouthfeel a bit on the light side, thinnish, decent effervescence, finsih is not too astringent. Interesting, wonder how this would stand up to some cellaring. Interesting, but certainly not for the sour mewbie, pretty aggressive sour-wise."

"overall ok, ill try anything but will stick with the monks for now."
"I was at The Trappist and my friend wanted to try Petrus, which I hadn't heard of before. When the bartender said that the Petrus Aged Pale was made for Michael Jackson, I stopped him in his tracks and asked him to retrieve a bottle for us. While he was pouring it for us he explained that Bavik approached MJ himself to ask what type of beer he would like them to make. When he asked for a Flanders Pale, Petrus was confused. How would one make such a thing? They put their heads together and made it happen. The back story surely changed my expectations of the beer, but despite this, I feel I can look past it and say with certainty that this is a great beer. The only flaw I feel worth mentioning is that the taste profile is a bit thin and fleeting. Still, this is a complex beer showing all the colors in the thin spectrum of flavors it illuminates. Not something you'd want any given day of the week, this is a special beer for a special occasion. Our occasion was a Saturday night. When you find your occasion, seek this beer out and enjoy."

"Poured into Jolly Pumpkin snifter. Thin head, copperish amber color. Smells like whaaaa. Sour funk, amazingly complex. Taste - oh the taste! Lots and lots of Warhead-esque lemonadey citrusy mouthpuckering action. Carbonation is light to moderate and fitting. Not a strong malt or hops profile - this beer is very complex without it. Is this the most sour beer that I've had? Maybe."

"A nice golden color with light fingers and a low head. Citrus aroma with hints of green apples, tangerine. Pleasant to smell. Tart and sour at first but thins out to slightly sour pale which is enjoyable. Spritzy on the tongue at first bouncing around the cheek and mouth. A good beer overall."

"Popped this lively corked and caged bottle with a bit of an expectation, that was met. On those its all funky, making me think it wouldn't be as sour as it is. The nose did not prepapre for the lock jaw sour from the beginning of the sip to well past the finish. I don't pick up any vanilla or even that much sweetness. This almost perfect the way it is. Its a very light gold in appearance with very minimal head, the clarity on this beer is amazing. The mouthfeel is full of vibrant acidity and carbonantion, it has a very dry finish and strong pucker. Overall this is a very well done beer and a very affordable price( $9 for 750ml). I can see this becoming a regular beer in my lineup."

"This is my first 'sour' and I'm not sure it's really for me. It's not bad and it's certainly drinkable but it's maybe just a little bit too much on the sour side for my taste buds. It would probably be exceptional to me with just a touch more balancing sweetness."

"Pours a hazy light honey orange with a large 3 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a thin cap. Random chunks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is tart, sour, and funky with a slight metallic aroma. Taste is of sour/tart fruit up front with a malt aftertaste. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and slightly acidic mouthfeel. Very bubbly but it works with the flavors. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice tart flavors but it's a bit pricey at $4.50 for less than 12 ounces."
""

"Pours a translucent gold with about an inch of foamy, pure white head. The bubbles dissipate quickly, leaving small patches of lacing. The aroma is of tart fruits, specifically apple, lending a cider-like scent. A bit of funky yeast is mixed in with light grains (straw, hay, some wheat), and it finishes with a vague hint of wood. It tastes of tart apple, some pear, the muddled grains, some lemon citrus, and a dry oaken finish. The barrel makes is presence known towards the end. Mouthfeel is crisp, but finishes rather dry from the acidity and seemingly the barrel treatment. Overall, an enjoyable offering, but not one I'm too likely to pick up again at $4/11.2 oz."

"O: Though not overwhelming in its tartness, this is definitely a sipper. Overall its not bad, begs (in my opinion) to be paired with a creamy Brie cheese. Not my favorite style."

"O: Nice overall, easy drinkability, good price point, lacks the complexity of the top examples of the style."

"Note: This beer is even better in the 750 corked and caged format I find. The dryness, sourness, and lactic close tend to be much stronger in that format. Or...on tap if you ever see it, it can be super biting when fresh on tap!"

"I really like it. It's dry and unrelenting, but balanced and somehow subtle in the flavor and aroma. Not a single thing bad with this one. Will be buying again, and soon."
"overall, a solid flanders that really showcases the sour, not so much the rich malt. a pale flanders, i like it. not really for the beginer sour drinker, i think most would be turned off. but intense sour and nice levels of funk make this a winner for me."
"I think the sour quality of this beer will blow a lot of people away if they just buy this cold off the shelf. Give this one some thought and really put yourself to task when drinking this beer. It is very complex and subtle. If you don't sip this one, you're missing out."
"Very interesting, not as oaky as expected. A definite sipper."
"Overall: Wow the flavor on this monster is insanely overpowering"
"A solid beer overall. Much more toned down with less vinegar and acidity than a lot of other beers of the same style. Worth a try."
"MF- Nice moderate body. A nice dry finish."
"O: This is a very good beer that I could drink almost everyday."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium to mild carbonation. Solid overall."
"I have a bit of a soft spot for this beer as it's the one that first got me into sours. Still very good and I'll pick it up when I see it."
"This beer is an awesome sour fix at a reasonable price, it isn't my favorite, but it is a very solid beer. I try to keep one around at all times."
"A good take on the style, not quite a puckery or deep as others of this ilk, but still a recommended Ould Bruin to me..."
"Pours an awesome gold color w/ an amazing two finger eggshell colored head. Fantastic carbonation and lacing. Slightly cloudy looking beer. Nose is funk, apple, pear, other fruit, vinegar in the background, oak. Not super smooth or balanced, but very nice. Just don't get your nose too close.... Taste is really good... funk, some fruit, vinegar, oak. Nice tart aftertaste that sticks around for a while. Definitely has an acidity to it on the initial taste- quickly disappears in the aftertaste. Light to medium feel with high carbonation and some tartness. Overall, this is a good solid brew- I will definitely have this again."
" ~ I would really like to get a few more and age the brews 1 or 2 years. This is a great beverage and I look forward to getting my hands on a few more. Thank you Bottle Stop."
"I definitely enjoyed this beer, but its not the best sour I've ever had as the balance just felt a bit off for me. Then again, I don't have a lot of experience with this style of beer, so be sure to go grab one to try for yourself, Cheers!"
"Pours a golden orange with bright carbonation that slowly settles. The aroma is very funky of sour fruit, yeast and a light vinegar at the end. Ah the taste. The sour apple is very forward in the beginning then just a touch of sweetness but mostly sour. There is a bit of that aged flavor in there that gives a bit of that musty flavor and the carbonation really opens this up. This is way to drinkable and very, very enjoyable. Not sure why it took me so long to pick one of these up. Very good, love the sour and the overall balance of this one."
"Champagne like character, present with a high dose of carbonation, mild hops & huge oaked pinot grigio. After 20 months in oak barrels, that is what I expect though - fucking smooth! Prickly on the tongue & sour in the jaws. Light body, refreshing, different & i really like it. This is my first Flanders Oud Bruin, so I dont know how it stacks up to the style - but it works on my palate. $3.99 for a 11.2 oz bottle from Total Wine & More. Was it worth the money? Yeah - to try once & have every now and then."
"O: Very, very well crafted, but to meet the middle of the road. this is my second time reviewing this beer and I held off inscribing this because it wasn't up to the standard indicated by previous reviews. Now I can say I gave some extra time to this one."
"Overall: Close to really excellent. The flavor is just too much of sourness and tannins, without enough else happening. Tasty and refreshing though-- I quite like it."
"Enjoy every sip. This is one superb beer. Will be going back for more of this one."
"--Overall a very nice surprise. Did not expect the complexity on the finish and the substantial sour notes are quite appealing."
"O: overall this was a very enjoyable brew, with a great sourness level, but a bit more non sour characters to balance would have made it better."
"The body is medium with strong acidic tones. Overall, this is an extremely solid beer that deserves a chance in everyone's glass."
"Overall - fantastic value. Tasty sour beer at a great price."
"It's difficult to review a beer when the style itself is unappealing to you but you still recognize fine attributes in the beer. To me I'm believing the look and smell beat average for a sour beer but the taste primarily just brought sour and also the barrel aging didn't contribute much."
"Moderate citrus and funk with some sticky sweetness. An okay mass produced sour ale that is a good table beer for a meal. Cheap and readily available but not too authentic or sophisticated."
"O - Loved this beer and will definitely have again. The tartness is great and the sugars are not too present, which really gives this brew something special."
"Pours a bright golden color with a small white head. Aroma of sour musty funk and horse blanket. In the taste, a sharp sour bite like a more characterful lemon rind. Wild yeasts doing their job well. Bitter, sour, and funky. Small touch of oak but mainly a dry sour. Mouthfeel is light, well carbonated and dry. Overall, this is an intense brew that I quite enjoyed."
"O- Really nice beer, good price for a sour fix."
"The beer is bright golden yellow with a a big foamy white head. The smell is mostly white grape and green apple skin and it has just a slight funk. When you take a sip you first experience a mouth puckering tartness similar to a sour white wine, you can also taste fresh apple and vinegar. The beer is medium bodied with soft carbonation and a very dry finish. I really enjoyed this sour beer, it kind of reminded me of New Belgium's Le Terroir."
"O: Good beer, complex, very refreshing, enough alcohol, but not too much. I'll have this one again"
"This is one my favorite underrated beers out there. It satisfies my craving for a complex, funky beer without being prohibitively expensive."
"Overall: I really liked it; it wasn't bang-you-over-the-head sour, but well balanced. I'd definitely drink it again if I see it. It tastes quite a bit like Duchesse de Bourgone, but looks nothing like it. It has more oak to it, and is a little less sweet."
"Unless you've had sour ales and have gotten used to their taste, I don't recommend this one; it would prove unpalatable to the novice. Enthusiasts, however, will no doubt find this a stellar example of the style."
"clear golden amber hue with foamy white head. Light bodied with good upfront sour taste but quick dissipation into a faintly sweet aftertaste. A good beginning beer for those not too immersed in the world of sour beers. It has good mouth-pucker but nothing too offensive."
"Overall: I do like this beer, but I think it could be better. For me, the flavor doesn't quite live up to my expectation."
"O- I surprised myself in the fact that I really enjoyed having this! It really hits the spot when sitting on the patio during a very warm afternoon! I also find that as it warms up a couple degrees from when first taken out of the fridge, it mellows out further....add to this the fact that the funk really hides the alcohol well, I'd never know that this was 7.5%!! Still not a beer for just anyone to try, if this is what a true Oud Bruin is supposed to be, I'm sold. I'll buy this again for sure!"
"I had this one on tap yesterday evening at Uptown Brothers Brewing on Colfax. Poured a medium golden color with a fluffy white head. Funky on the nose, with aromas of vinuous wood, apples and pears. On the palate, this one was light bodied, with flavors of wine, oak, apples and pears."
"This is an excellent beer. If this is your style, it's a must-try for sure."
"Apparently this is what ""pale"" ales tasted like centuries ago. While I can only speculate on the validity of that claim I can assure you that's is what more beers made in this century *should* be tasting like. The combination of tart and sweet is delightful and, while others have likened it a wine, I say it's definitively beer. And really good beer at that."
"I found this to be a very good beer, but if you don't like sour stay away. This is the first I've reviewed this, but not the first I've had it. I'll have many more of these in the future."
"O - A very enjoyable brew that was personally recommended by Chris Lively. My experience with Petrus isn't so good, so I wouldn't have ordered this otherwise. Much better on-tap then out of the bottle, by a long shot. Enjoyable, thanks Chris!"
"Transparent color as a pilsener, and with oxidation as powerful and strong. Small clouds of white wine and reminiscence of caves. Mouth tastes like sherry and muscatel dry but still with the force of an Oud Bruin and sharp acidity. With small hints of oak that adds complexity to the mix without making excessive acid. Is fleetingly think of a good lambic. The ABV is not readily detectable. Excellent to quench his thirst and to get unique flavors. Certainly, both of oud bruin Bavik products are good, not perfect but certainly very significant."
"*Beware… this beer is VERY sour. If you don’t like sour stuff, stay away!"
"O - AWESOME! Buy it if you can find it. Highly recommended."
"Petrus Aged Pale pours a mildly hazy tangerine. Nearly two fingers of cream colored head sprout up initially, but soon fizz away without putting up much of a fight. The smell is fairly tart, but with a sweet, pale fruit component to it as well. The flavor adds more layers to that base, giving the beer more of a refined edge. A sharp tartness is definitely what jumps out right from the first sip. Once my palate was acclimated to the acidity though, the rest of the beer began to really shine through. Green apple skin and peaches provide a sweetness that helps counteract the beer's dominant sour characteristic. The back end of each sip highlights a delicate oak/cherry pit note that really elevates the beer. The body is appropriately light for a relatively small sour beer, and the carbonation serves its purpose of preventing the beer from turning into a syrup, and nothing more. I haven't had Petrus Oude Bruin, but if the final beer is as good as this thread that goes into it is, I'll be in for a hell of a brew."
"Since my beer no head with minimal lacing, I will try another once I have the chance...but taste wise, my beer tasted fresh."
"o - not too bad. i only say that cause it takes a little more character and definition for a sour to really wow me. it would be a great start to someone who has never ventured into this type of brew, at least to get an idea of what a sour be is like."
"Pours a clear golden-apricot color with a short white head and some nice spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward a bit of green apple and hay, along with a good amount of funk. Light funk, but good in terms of how forward the beer was with it. The flavor brought some acidity and apple skin. Golden color was the first hint that this isn't really an Oud Bruin, and the flavor is another. Bright acidity and some light stone fruits. This was a really interesting beer and I'd certainly have it again."
"Mouthfeel - light body, good carbonation, sessionable"
"O - Excellent beer. This is my first sour beer, but I loved it, and I will be back for more."
"Overall - I don't think this is an Oud Bruin at all. I'm no expert, but this is too light and has a different sort of sour to it. I really like it, but I don't know about the category."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a tight soapy head and a little bit of lacing. The aroma is of sour cherries oak notes and some green apples. The taste has a big sour apple flavor with hints of sour cherries and a hint of citrus. The oakiness of the barrels is presebt throughout. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall very good beer, a light very easy drink. The flavor is nice and smooth and makes you want more."
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden yellow with a small bubbly white head. Some phenols in the aroma, along with sour apple and citrus. Light toasted malts in the taste, quickly overcome by sour apple, lemonade, orange zest and sour cherries. Finishes with a bitter, funky dryness. Medium mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable, unless you don't like sour ales."
"10 oz pour at Malt and Vine, Redmond, WA on 5/9/13. No haziness with a bit of alcohol at the finish. Band-Aid and bubblegum flavor characteristics."
"Overall: I think this is a very enjoyable beer that flies under the radar since it is readily available, but it is really damn good. Definitely going to have to pick up some more."
"O- At the pricepoint, it is hard to beat. Nice everyday Oud Bruin."
"it is delicious... And cheap. That's win/win!"
"I think this would be a really good beer for friends that are really into wine."
"While a bit of a palate gobsmack up front, this settles nicely into a pleasantly sour, fruity, and proper wood-aged Belgian ale, the elevated booze playing nicely in the corner, and most memories of sidelong vinegar references cast away. Sorry mom...welcome to the new world of old world brewing techniques."
"A nice, refreshing, mildly sour beer. Everything about it is good; no real downsides in my opinion. But nothing really amazing about it either. A tasty, enjoyable beer."
"Overall, I was impressed with this one, especially at the cost. Really easy to drink and quite tasty. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Really loving this beer right now. Great easy drinking sour. I could see myself going through a case of this during the summer. Well done."
"Only had a 2 or 3oz. sample of this one but that was plenty for me to get the point. This beer pours out as a pleasing looking pale ale with a nice looking head on it. The beer smells so strong with sour aromas rising. I was pretty surprised. This beers flavor could make just about anyone pucker I think. I was still trying to figure out how this was still considered a Pale Ale and not something else. The mouthfeel was pretty smooth but also dry and tart. An interesting ride for someone who wants to try it."
"A great sour beer for the price."
"For such a sour, complex beer it is amazingly drinkable."
"Drink and overall: Really tasty. Not my favorite of the style, but very enjoyable. The ABV is well hidden."
"Medium body, a little slick with a dry cidery finish. Shades of a prosecco, nice and easy to drink. Loved it."
"Overall, outstanding beer. Very drinkable, the sourness is not at all overpowering and you get a very nice fruit flavor."
"About the beer. Very interesting sour beer.the smell is almost funky lemon. The look is rather plain and you wouldn't know it is different from a glass of pilsner except for some soapy head that dissipates. Seems to be right for the aged style. The taste is funky vinegar lemonade with overtones of grain and sweetness. If you like sour beers this is a nice subtle one."
"Amazingly drinkable for its size and heft, and really nicely balanced. This showcases some of the magnificent things that the Belgians do, and that the rest of the world only dabbles with."
"Very drinkable. This isn't my favorite style but this one is done right."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The nose is very tart, vinegar and green apple notes. The first sip is almost puckering, then there are sweet citrus, and apple notes. The oak lends an interesting note also. The finish is lingering tart. The beer is light and very acidic, good carbonation. An enjoyable sour."
"O - Just a wacky beer all over. Aroma is simply amazing. Overall though probably a little bit hardcore given the exceptionally high levels of carbonation and peculiar combination of tastes."
"Overall: I was surprised by how peppery this is, but that seems to make it more refreshing and appealing. Also, despite the onslaught on the taste buds, there is still a nice, soft character beneath that really makes this a fantastic sipper."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer. Not super complex, but the flavors that are there are clean, clear and well balanced."
"The taste is a smooth, sour that isn't overwhelming and is quite refreshing. There's some citrus there and maybe some hay. Not the most complex, but it is refreshing and inviting. I'll definitely have another and these are quite affordable for decent sours!"
"Drinkability: Beyond the crackling acidity running its course, there's really not too terribly much to this one. It's fine, but not a favorite."
"M/D: It poured with a lot of carbonation, but the beer lost it pretty quickly and made for a pretty bland beer on my tongue. The tartness and sourness didn't last long enough to save this beer. On a positive note, this beer is worth a try simply for its nose. That is the shinning aspect of this beer."
"D: love it one bottle and done type of beer, but have had this more than once, and is a go to sour ale. that I enjoy."
"Interesting beer. Pale color, with you golden haze. Smelled of citris and apples. Taste, sour, but not vinegary. Reminded me of Granny Smith apples, without the sweetness. Not my preference. Drinkability, unlike some ""sour"" beers, I actually was able to drink it down. For some this will be a hit. Wasn't for me."
"I really like the nose on this one. The taste is not bad but IMO it could be a little less tart and more oaky/complex."
"Drinkability - I'm always amazed by the diversity present in the differing style offerings. To enjoy an Oud Bruin or a lambic is to very much appreciate the many facets of both beer-making and the enjoyment of variety. This offering is indeed in the upper strata of find offerings in the style."
"Very drinkable for the style.. Doesn't fatigue the palate like some do with overwhelming tartness... This would be a good brew to introduce someone to sours... Very quality beer..."
"Delicious and highly recommended. I've only had a few beers of the style, but this is tasty no matter what style you call it."
"Flavorful and intense, but not so crazy that it turns me off."
"Overall, a very nice brew. In th erealm of sours, this isn't the most over powering, and as such might be a good beer woth which to expand your experience. Worth trying if you see it."
"I find this concept pretty interesting and if i really think about it i havnt had too many beers like this before anyway it pours a golden pale hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head that slowly recedes to a rim,the smells are mustiness,white grapes,a abit of oak and some fruit punch aswell,it has a rather sour puckering mouthfeel which is quite light bodied and feels like a nice wine with tastes of sour white grapes,fruit punch,goosberries,herbal hops and finishes with a ever so smooth tart champagne finish and overall this brew is quite unique and even though this one would do me nicely for tonight i will buy it again without doubt as there aint too many brews that taste like this cheers."
"The subdued flavor makes this quite drinkable, but I'm not personally in love with the taste (or lack thereof) enough to want to drink a bunch of it. In fairness, it's a departure from my personal favorite styles, but for what it is, it's not exceptional compared to similar brews."
"Notes: I'm pleasantly surprised by this beer as I hadn't been overly impressed by other Petrus offerings and this is very cheap for a sour imported from Belgium. I ended up enjoying this quite a bit though. Great balance between the tart/sour fruit and woodiness. Really pretty enjoyable and given the price I could definitely see myself getting this again. Not the best sour, but for the cost it is definitely worth a look."
"I don't really see how this is categorized an oude brun, oh well I'm gonna review it as one. Poured into a tulip, hazy amber with some deep honey color sits under a two finger rocky head. This beer leaves behind some nice lacing. Vinegar and lemon up front, following underneath there is some horsey brett charecter and damp old wood. Aside from the apperance the taste is where I find the greatest departure from the said style. Fairly zingy beer with a real basement quality, citrus, earthy hay, and a plan round malt body. The beer feels well balanced on my tongue, and surprisingly has a long finish for a beer of the type. I believe this beer is delicious, I truly enjoyed it, but an oude brun, no."
"D- is very good i found it just right with it sourness and just right with malt/hops and wood flavors...11.2 oz was just the right serving"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light but never thin. The carbonation is active and really works well with the beers overall character. As far as drinkability you have got to be kidding me. This has beer pure beer drinking pleasure."
"D: Pretty interesting. Not familiar with this type of beer but it's interesting."
"Served in a tulip. Pours a translucent, straw gold with no head and minimal lacing. Nose expresses citrus, french oak, and some toasty notes - perhaps a trace of caramel. Taste is salty, citrusy and mellow wood notes with a slightly tart finish. Mouthfeel is light and lively with an astringency that keeps the salivary glands stimulated. A solid example of the style - very pleasant and easy drinking with a well-hidden abv. Especially nice in that it is fairly easy to obtain."
"Drinkability:This is a quite refreshing sour beer. It's not the most sour beer in the world, but it's got some great flavors."
"I can't believe it's taken this long to try this beer, I'll certainly need to get this more often now."
"A very nice, interesting beer. The appearance is a nice straw/gold color, finger thick fizzy off white head. The smell is lemons, vinegar, and a bit tropical. The taste is tart, woody, earthy, sweet and fruity. The mouthfeel is decent, and the drinkability is quite high. Nice sour for someone who is a bit new to the style."
"Nicely drinkable overall. I want another, but lack of balance and body detract."
"Notes: thanks to the guys at Greenville Beer Exchange for the advice"
"definitely the appearance of a pale, but the aroma and flavors of a flanders oud bruin. overall, really fun beer."
"An awesome beer. Though easily available I just never seemed to find it anywhere even in a bottle. Good stuff."
"d - A very enjoyable sour. Lots of tart apples in the nose and taste. Would like to have again."
"Cheers"
"D: one of the most drinkable beers I've had. Refreshing and delicious. I will always have at least 3 bottles in my house at all times."
"Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, though I was in the mood for something very tart and this beer is just that."
"D: This might be my new go to sour beer. It is not to hard on the wallet and it is a sensational drink."
"Well aged, infected and brewed. The balance is struck well to make a tasty funky beer."
"D - This is one of the more ""sour"" Flanders, being more sour that vinegar IMO. Great flavor, drinkable body, and inviting aroma. One of the better sours available in my area. Will definitely buy again!"
"D: This tastes wonderful, I wish I had another in the fridge! It's not too strong, so it'd be easy to knock back a few. I don't think the dryness would get to me at all."
"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and slight funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, sour, and slight wood. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is quite an excellent brew for the style. I have had this more times than I care to remember, and will be having again in the future I'm sure. Just an all-around great representation of the style. Has a nice flavor and aroma here and is a must try for any sour fan out there or a fan of the style."
"The acidity level of this beer is on the higher side which is the only thing hampering it's drinkability. Overall I really love this beer and for $6.99 a 750mL it's a better bargain than Rodenbach Grand Cru, my benchmark beer in price/availability/taste."
"Very drinkable with a crisp sour finish."
"Golden brown in color with patches of white or off-white head. No head retention or lacing. Smells of apple cider vinegar, fresh granny smith apple, and a touch of earthy malt. The taste comes on quite tart with more apple flavor. Lots of sweetness comes through as well; very fruity and mostly clean tasting. Earthy, funky flavors are there but are definitely in the background, mostly covered up by the sweetness and tartness."
"From a bottle, pours a clear medium gold with a large head. Nose is acidic, light fruits, sour, oaky, and sharp. Really reminds me of Cable Car 09 in the nose. Quite acidic from start to finish. Good lemon and oak notes to this, but I find the acidity distracting. Straight and sharp without a ton of complexity but the flavor is pretty nice. Sweaty sock brett rounds it out. Acidity is really quite high, I think even the 12oz bottle might be tough to finish. Although I'm actually impressed with how fully sour and acidic this is, I was expecting something much more mellow."
"Had this on tap at FFF, followed by a scotch egg, and a brisket sandwich. First scent was full of sourness and lemon. Upon the first sip, it simply exploded in my mouth with a sour lemon peel flavor. Continued taste of lemon lingers throughout the taste. Could drink this for days. Really enjoyed this one. and would suggest trying it. FIRST REVIEW...Need to do more work."
"Mouthfeel is nice. Medium texture, and lightly carbonated. Sticky sweets coat the palette. Do not expect to drink this fast, rather, sip and enjoy the sour fruity flavors!"
"The body is medium light and carbonation is a bit stinging. Overall I enjoyed this beer but there was that one off flavor that brought the whole package down from stellar to meehhhh"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, nice sour beer worth sipping on for a while."
"very strong sourness in the flavor, as well. some sweetness to balance, as well as a touch of bitterness but, really, it's super funky. lemon and minimal bitterness. almond"
"Pretty crisp mouthfeel with a stingy carbonation that well fits the tartness of the beer."
"Poured a golden brown, with a hint of orange. Bubbly head, falling to a thin layer. Nose is vinous, vingear, green apple and some pear. Taste is quite sour, less vinegar than the nose and the green apple is more evident here. Very drying mouthfeel, with a definite 'pucker.' High carbonation. An introduction to the style for me, and I can definitely say that one was enough. Interesting to say the least, although I don't know how often I'll pursue this style."
"I had this down at the Falling Rock Taphouse in Downtown Denver last weekend and I have been wanting more ever since. Served in a wine glass, this beer poured a light golden color with a small fizzy white head. Aromas of wheat, sweet malts, light citrus and subtrle hops. Taste wise this might be one of the best sours I have had. NOt overly sour but definitely noticable, and not as sweet and fruity as most. Instead I found it very well balanced between the sour and the bitterness of the hops."
"Very nice balance of sour, tart and citrus fruits. If you're looking for a pucker-worthy sour that's actually sessionable, Petrus Aged Pale is for you. Highly recommended."
"Great moderately high carbonation and light body. Spot on."
"Estery fruit smells with some winey notes. The fruit up front gives way to some oaky vinous flavours. The fairly high carbonation melds nicely with the sweet tart middle. Sparkling. Wonderfully light, well balanced and complex. The sourness draws you in. An incredably drinkable sour. Top shelf."
"Conclusion: This style intrigues me greatly, and I feel that there is no way that I can really understand the intricacies of the style from my limited exposure to it. This (as far as I can tell) is a very good example, as it is complex and pleasing."
"D: Very smooth and refreshing."
"Overall this was just as good as I remembered. A solid beer that doesn't fit well into any category but is well worth a shot."
"Big complaint....$9.00 a draft!!!!"
"D: This is an intriguing beer, pretty much a pale Oud Bruin, I expected more lactic acid but instead got CH3COOH which is fine, I like them both in their own ways, what they can bring to a beer. Really good like the regular Oud Bruin."
"mouthfeel is dry and puckering, sweet dry and bubbly, finish leaves your mouth like you've been sucking on pennies - wouldn't drink often but still nice"
"I don't think I'd have too many glasses of this beer in a row--but I feel that way about a lot of sours. In this single glass, I find it to be very drinkable. I won't tire of it before I finish."
"D: Very drinkable - hard to believe the abv is 7.3%. Really good stuff - definitely worth trying and probably something I'll come back to for a sour fix."
"D- this is one really good sour pale, up there with the best, yet its super accessible and really easy to drink. Not to mention its fucking everywhere in philly right now and has been for awhile."
"D: this is an Oud Bruin worth checking out. I wasn't expecting big things after being disappointed by their Winter Ale, but this one is a winner."
"On tap at Trappeze in Athens. Poured into a Dupont tulip. White head, golden body, aroma of intense sour apple and grapes. Extreme tartness, mouth puckering intensity, champagne notes. Wild yeasty funk and sour apples dominate the taste. I usually don't seek out the funk but this is a rare draft treat."
"This beer was very tasty and complex, but way too tart/sour to drink all night. Interesting, but low drinkability and certainly not a pale ale. Great beer for a cider fan, but this is not a typical beer yet still worth trying because of the nice fruit taste combination."
"D. I believe this is the first beer of this style that I have had. Easy drinking enough if you are into sours. Im not sure how many I would want to have in a sitting, but this is good."
"Pours a very nice golden color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is lightly tart, reminiscent of sour apples. Taste is lightly sour, not overpowering at all. That's not to say this is a wimpy beer. It has plenty of complex flavor to offer. Nice mouthfeel, very crisp. This is a sour style beer that does its thing elegantly. I love all manner of sour beers, and I think those who enjoy the style will be satisfied by this one."
"D: Great for imbibing with food. Cleansing acidity makes you want more. Great stuff!"
"Overall, this is an excellent Belgian pale. The tartness is quite forward, but not out of balance."
"Acidic and tart, the first taste is like a punch in the mouth. Once you are past the initial sour shock, and your palate is coated, the complex flavors start to emerge. Lots of tart (and slightly sweet) citrus fruits, maybe a hint of tart apple. As the beer warms the woody flavors start to emerge, maybe a hint of vanilla. Light bodied and very dry. Once you get past the initial sour/tart shock, the beer becomes quite drinkable. I could see myself drinking a few of these."
"Bottle. Best before19/05/11. Matured in oak barrels for 20 months. Pours a clear golden color with a fluffy 1 1/2 finger white head. Slight sour fruit aroma in the nose along with a touch of oak . Sour tart taste that transitions to sweet and then a slight bitter end. Subtle aftertaste of alcohol. Slight acidity to this one. Light/medium mouthfeel. A little pricey at $4.39/33cl bottle but pretty satisfied with this one."
"D: It's pretty tasty, but not the smoothest ride."
"Really smooth, with a perfectly carbonated light to medium textured body, yielding a great texture. I will definitely be heading back for more bottles of this. This is a great sour, and to be able to buy it at $4/bottle is a great treat."
"D - Suprisingly high given it's pucker-factor. I do think the Pale Ale name on the bottle is a bit of a misnomer and may do it a disservice."
"Lightly malted, gripping sourness on the flavor with some tannic wood and tart fruit coming out. I wish the malts were a bit more assertive and maybe some darker fruit would be nice. It does have a nice level of sourness, especially for the price (about $3.50), it can fix a sour craving at the very least. Pretty tasty, but lacks the depth behind the sourness to really keep things moving. That said, I will most definitely buy a few more of these for the cellar, it's a great value."
"notes: this is a beer you hate or love, and its a acquired taste, but to us sour lovers its heaven, enjoy."
"Served in a sort of stubby champagne glass, it appears a clear golden orange color with less than a finger of creamy head. Lace clings all about the glass. The aroma of this brew has all the indications of this being a funky brew. Slight fruity tones with an indication of sourness. The flavor of this brew has a tartness upfront with fruity hints and vinegar character. Quite a bit of puckering power with it's sourness level. Light bodied with a modest level of carbonation that is prickly on the tongue. Lingering flavor of funk and an oaky woodsiness left in the mouth that exaggerates the dryness of this beer along with an ever increasing amount of alcohol. As it warms there is a mild amount of orange rind flavor."
"Pours a slightly hazed dulled gold color, quickly diminishing cap of wwhite froth leaving small touches of lacing. Scent is of tart and acidic wine grapes backed by hints of apple, soapy lemon, musty straw and vinegar. Taste is a little smoother than the muddled and bold scent dictates but brings the qualitites of tart and acidic wine grapes and musty hay to the front, apple and vinegar in the middle and finishes with the soapy lemon. Very little oak charachter. Lighter side of medium bodied, slightly below average level of carbonation, tingly and prickly on the palate though, slight lingering tartness. A good beer that could perhaps use a touch of mellowing."
"I would consider it a successful introduction from an enjoyability standpoint but it being my first,I can't comment on it's trueness to the Oud Bruin style.I was actually kind of discouraged from trying this by my bartender but I found it delightful and my wife(who isn't really a fan of micro's much less strange ""sour"" beers)enjoyed it also.I could definitely drink a few of these."
"D - I could enjoy another one of these for sure. Glad I stumbled upon it. Just completely not what I was expecting, in a good way!"
"Pours a bright clear golden color with a smaller than average head that lasts as a film for most of the beer. The lacing is very nice and sticky as it clings to the glass. Great funky, tart, sour fruit aroma. First sip hits you with that same sour funk, and then mellows out quite a bit. I got a lot of sour apple/grapes mixed in with a musty funk and acidity. There is a slight sweetness to balance it all through the beer and a very pleasant dryness at the end. There is a medium to light body which is a bit thin for an Oud Bruin, however this one is a ""Pale"" ale. . . either way I would have preferred more body. Very refreshing and so easy to drink, could drink it all day."
"Pours a hazy dark gold with a two finger white head and a swirl of bubbles. The smell is all sour. Apples, lemons and funk. The taste is again, all sour. Not sure this really qualifies as a pale ale, but I'm not complaining. This really reminds me of Rodenbach Grand Cru with less fruit and more dry in the taste. Yum! This is going to leave you puckering but if you like sour beer then this is one to try."
"Taste is very tart and sour. It's rich and malty, for being funky but quite smooth and drinkable for what it is, light malt and light carb is nice."
"Pours a clean, pale yellow-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, well, like sticking your head in a package of sweet tarts. In the taste, sugary and liquid sweet tarts, yet more tart than sweet. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry sourness in the aftertaste. Super sour, a bit sweet, but delicious all day long!"
"D: An awesome brew with great flavor and an intense mouthfeel. Could go back to back with this sipper."
"D Definitely a beer worth trying, perhaps not for the novice, but certainly the more adventurous BA. There is some interesting flavors in this beer, and not quite like any other beer I've tried. I will have another. I wish I knew more about wine so that I could more easily distinguish the characteristic flavors that come as a result of the oak barrel aging."
"Beer is thin and has a slightly metallic tinge to it. Strong acetic acid note, almost cherry like at times. Pretty bright flavors, good drinkability and nice mouthfeel."
"D - If this is a style you really enjoy, then more than one makes sense. For me, one is enough as a real, taste treat like a Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"Overall, very well made and an outstanding example of the style. I will be getting this again."
"Drinkability -- This beer is very dynamic with the flavors quickly evolving throughout the taste. Exceptional to say the least. I feel foolish for putting this back on the shelf so many times before."
"D- Not for everybody, but if you can hang with it, this is a really great summertime refresher. Like a light Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"I tried this beer on September 2, 2009 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a hazy golden brown with a thin white head that lasted. The aroma is musty bread and wood chips. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with light carbonation. The taste was SOUR! Moreso than the Petrus Oud Bruin in my opinion. Very yeasty in the taste."
"D - Quite drinkable."
"This brewery and brand have been known to produce some clunkers, not this fine brew."
"D: Goes down very smooth and with the tartness being kept to a restrained level, it would be easy to put down quite a few of these."
"The beer pours a light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very tart with vanilla and oak notes. The flavor is tart lemons with some oak. The beer is extremely dry and makes you keep drinking it. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An excellent, budget sour."
"That said, and despite the many likable qualities of this ale, it just doesn't float my boat. Seems lacking in character, or at least the kind of character I'd like to send past my gums. I probably won't buy one again any time soon, but you probably should."
"D - Pretty easy drinking Oud Bruin. I prefer sour beers that really make my mouth pucker but this one is pretty good. It is real nice to find a beer that gives you a nice sour taste in a smaller bottle. While not an amazing beer this one is pretty good and really good considering the difficulty to find beers of this style at this price point. I would drink it again."
"I love me some sour beers. Though this is a little one dimensional. Basically just tart and sour lemons. Not much is going on. Not something I am going to get again."
"Pours a golden light brown color with a tight white head that dissipates into a solid ring. The aroma is of the oak cask, tart and sour. There is also a sugary aroma that pops through. Clearly oaked aged. A big lemony tart/sour flavor. Perhaps too lemony as you don't really pick up any actual oak flavors. There is a seltzer water type flavor as well. I guess what is disappointing is that the rest of the beer doesn't show up. I would like to see hints of malt and yeast but all I really pick up is the sour. There is a very very very light cider like flavor. There is a bitter aspect towards the finish, kind of woody. The feel is light, fizzy and puckering which is what I would expect from a sour. Again some bitterness in the finish. I'm not an expert on this style so not too much to base this beer on. The sour flavors are nice but, to me, needs to have a touch of other flavors as well."
"Medium mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. A great sour in a standard 12 oz bottle. Recommended"
"D - As a person that likes tart and sour beer this was a pleasnt surprise after the first sniff and beyond if sour beers are your thing it's worth picking some of this up to try"
"Drinks very well- wild taste is well managed and close to being able to drink more than one."
"Pours a light brown with about a finger of head. The aroma is a slightly acrid vinegar-like smell. The taste is an amazing sour funky goodness. It's not the best sour I'v ever had, but its very close. Tomorrow I'm going to go back to my local beer shop and buy them out of this. I've wanted to taste Petrus for a really long time. Apparently I've been missing out. This stuff is great."
"M/D - Mouthfeel was smooth for a sour and went down well. This is incredibly drinkable and I may have to hit the store and pick up the west."
"this is not a beer I would buy again"
"It has an ok drinkability, but I couldn't possibly session this one."
"taste is very sour with a touch of apple tartness. very dry body as well. very appropriate levels of sourness with some interesting fruit complexity."
"Edit (2009-2010)- Damn, Bavik, I know Philly is mad lucrative for breweries, but you guys must of sent at least 150 kegs of this stuff over here. It's on at at least 25 bars that I know of right now. Im bombared by this goodness and im becoming broke because of it, please stop!"
"Quite a nice sour, sweetness is low, but still has a hint. Very unbeer-like, which to me is an indication of a good sour, if that makes sense. I'd love to pair this with some stinky cheeses (unfortunately, I'm all out at the moment). Very solid, I would never turn down the chance to have some."
"D: It's relatively easy to drink (particularly if you like sourness) but I can't see myself having more than one of these in a single sitting."
"D: I would think it's best served perhaps as an apertif before a meal. I wouldn't think it would go well with most foods. Not my favorite, but it's interesting to try."
"Edit: Lots of sour yeast."
"overall too tart for my liking, the petrus oud bruin is better."
"mouthfeel: expect dry cheeks constantly being washed by a salivating throat. exactly what i was looking for. although it is somewhat sour it is still refereshing, crisp and easy to drink."
"Disappointing body--too light and thin."
"D- For the ABV and strong flavors, I notice my glass emptying faster than expected. Very tasty. Worth seeking out if you need to get your sour fix."
"The beer is on the more acidic side and has a tongue drying quality to it. As far as feel goes it certainly does a good job of blanketing mouth. Throughout the experience the beer maintains its character and the mouth drying aspect I believe adds to its drinkability."
"Overall very solid. Was not expecting it to be as light and drinkable as it was. Would have no issue with this one again."
"D: very refreshing and drinkable, definitely a sip and savor brew but great flavors and mouthfeel"
"Verdict: Nicely complex and tasty throughout Aged Pale is a friendly and solid little brew. If you've only tried a few sweet sours and are looking to branch out into the more vinegary side, this would be a perfect place to start."
"Not the complex sour I've had but still very interesting. More of a fruity sour than vinegary, while still not really being a ""fruity"" beer, helps the drinkability. Still, this is meant to be savored & not drunk serially."
"D-Nice tart beer. A little bit much of the fake sugar sweetness. Would be good for a hot day."
"Taste is effervescent with a spritzy champagne like carbonation. Bit of orange citrus conveys to a textured malty finish. Quite enjoyable."
"D - This is an incredibly delicious beer. I cannot believe I have passed this thing up at the beer store so many times."
"D - My favorite beer ever. No question about it. Not hyped; I don't care. It is the deal. It has all of the characteristics that I prize in a beer."
"D: this is very drinkable for me I freaking love this beer.... sour and complex without the sweet... long finishing but not long enough to keep me from having another sip."
"D: Crisp, refreshing, and flavorful."
"M - Pretty decent, a bit oily."
"D - exceedingly drinkable if sourness is not a turn-off. Almost too drinkable; as mentioned, this would be a near perfect venture into new (to me) territory if the flavors had been a little more daring."
"Lovely golden honey colour, with a big fluffy white head and a copious amount of fine carbonation. The aroma has a sour edge to it with apples, grapes and a hint of cherries. There are slightly sweeter tone under this with a light toffee and some vanilla. The taste starts off very sharp and sour, with lots of apples, vinegar, and a very piercing sherbet. The finish is dry and tangy but I was left with a slightly buttery aftertaste. Very active in the palete, lots of carbonation, and a very sharp, dry feel. This isn't my style but it is a very crafted flanders, definitely worth a try if you are into them."
"Poured a clear golden red body with lively carbonation for a frothy one finger head and a lace ring. A funky yeast smell with some sour grape/dark fruit tart smell along hints of some oakiness. Light bodied and smooth, this beer flows easily over the tongue and is real sharp thanks to lively carbonation. The beer gives off sour fruitness like grape and cherry along with something like figs and berries. Has a good amount of sweetness as well and then finishes dry thanks to some woodiness. A little livelier than expected but a great beer to sip on."
"Petrus Golden Ale claims to be the key to heaven. Jesus did give the keys of heaven to Peter, so perhaps this ale represents salvationI am in liquid form."
"First off, this is no oud bruin, look at it, its yellow for God's sake! The beer is a beautiful pale yellow and looks like a gueuze. It smells quite enticingly sour, a little brett funkiness and a little cereal? The flavor is nice and sour but not abrasive. tart and lemony this is a good sour and I can't believe I've passed it up so many times in the past. the price wasn't too bad for a sour at $5 for a 330ml."
"This is a great beer that deserves alot more attention. A pleasant suprise for any sour lover. Think RR Temptation with a little less dryness."
"When I saw pale on this bottle I was a little wary, expecting it to be hoppy brew. I was wrong. It has a sweet alcoholic aroma, almost like a fine bourbon. Taste has some apple notes and some other sweet fruits. Looks actually like apple juice, and it doesn't have an alcoholic taste despite the 7.3 ABV"
"D: Tough to drink many of them. 1-2 beers at the most. Otherwise, it can upset your stomach."
"D: Not my taste, but a decent example of the style."
"D: very, very drinkable"
"D - this was the first sour beer i ever had, about a year ago...and for a sour patch kid junkie, i fell in love with the style. since then i've had more robust and puckering beers, but love the drinkability, price, and availability of this one."
"D: Ehhh, well, like Black Cherry Warheads...you can't have too much."
"Pours a light orange gold with a fluffy white head that leaves some scattered lace. Aroma is tart but perfumey once you're acclimated to the sour aspect. Lemons and bruised apples come through in the aroma as well as the flavor. The oak is subtle, as is the alcohol, but they're apparent if you look hard enough. Fleeting licorice accents, also some pepperiness. Interesting and fairly complex, but a little thin in body."
"D - This is a pretty good sour beer. I can't imagine having more than one in a session, though."
"This poured a clear light gold with some white head. It smelled like white wine and vinegar, with sour yeast and green apples and a bit of grassy hops and oak. It tasted like champagne grapes and sour yeast and some green apple, with a bit of grassy hops and oak. It was watery with a lot of carbonation, and had a lasting dry sour aftertaste. Overall this seemed more like champagne than beer, but it had an interesting and decent flavor. The sour and bubbly character made this a definite sipping beer, but the alcohol was pretty well hidden. I don't have a lot of experience with sour beers, so this was challenging for me to drink. But it seemed generally enjoyable, even though it's not necessarily refined or delicious."
"Overall I give it a good grade. I will have to try this again solo, without the influence of spinach on my palate, but I can imagine the flavors and consistency improving. I will give this one an update."
"Drinkability - Drinks very nicely, but I think one or two would be enough."
"I've got two bottles of this. the second one, I think, might be a good candidate for cooking. The bright acidity and slight fruitiness might really add some nice character to a stew, tomato sauce, or something else."
"At 3.50ish not a great price point, but definitely adding it to my sour rotation."
"D - A sipper for sure. Very pleasant on a warm afternoon. Goes down easily but makes your lips pucker as you drink, but not in a harsh, uncomfortable way. Could maybe drink two in a sitting but it took more more than an hour to sip one."
"Quite refreshing and drinkable, I was surprised to find this up above 7%. Like most dry sours/wilds, it isn't a bad one for hot weather. I could definitely get used to having this around."
"This murky brown beer was poured into a pint glass. The smell of slight bitterness with tones of sweetness in the after aroma. The taste is that of a granny apple. The tartness that it gives but the sweetness of the aftertaste. Overall a great beer to enjoy."
"D - For a fairly intense brew with a lot of funk and sourness going on, this is definitely more drinkable than others I've had. The mild sweetness tempers some of the sourness and the light body helps everything go down as well. Not something I'd have more than one of, but a bit easier to drink than I was expecting after reading others' comments about the levels of funk and dryness."
"The beer poured out a nice pale gold with a few fingers of foamy head, not a lot going on the nose some fruit, some yeast but the taste is amazing, lots of sour tang. It tastes more like a Basque cider than a belgian beer. There is fruit and citrus. Unlike a lot of the sour red there is no ketchupy or bandaid taste, to distract from the funky sourness. It's a great beer with a light mouth feel. One of the few sours I have had, where i could drink more than one in a night."
"Thin head which quickly dissolves down almost nothing, the lacing is made of very minute bubbles but lacks stickiness. Burnt orange to copper in color, good clarity yet the intensity of the coloration gives it additional visual solidity. Sour lemon and orange citrus build first in the nose, cocktail bitters, sharp rye notes, the brown sugar nuances aren't very sweet, same good be said for the terse apricot, peach fruit scents, more pit than pulp, overall has directness and force. Medium-bodied, here too retains a military erectness and compactness, this in spite of a strong prickly carbonation to it. The inherent acidity to it heightens the sourness of the lemon, orange citrus, touches on white grapefruit. There's a raw yeasty quality next to the rustic rye bread element. Apple, apricot, peach, cherry fruit more present here, but not by much. The oak comes across as sour too, like dill herb. Keeps you mouth clenching, close to full-on pucker. Can't fault its energy level and has above average length and tenacity. Just a question of being ""in the mood"" for this style of beer."
"I am not sure if Flanders Oud Bruin is the right style for this one though. It reminds me more of a Belgium Strong Pale, Golden Ale/Biere de Garde, than it does a Oud Bruin. Plus Petrus makes another beer that is actually labeled as Oud Bruin, while this beer is labeled as Aged Pale Grand Reserve."
"Body is on the lighter side of medium, prickly carbonation. There's absolutely no hint of any alcohol. This beer becomes very drinkable after the initial sour shock."
"Surprisingly drinkable and tasty once you get over the initial surprise of how sour this starts. Maybe if I had known this coming in, would have adapted more quickly."
"Good beer. Not one to seek out actively, but never one to turn down. Everything seems good but one notch too low."
"As i begin to adventure more into sours, this was a great start. There was plenty of funk in there, but not an overpowering amount that would scare me away."
"D: Delicious and refeshing on a hot summer day. This is really a wonderfully unique Belgian!"
"Interesting to say the least. Not really someting I'd go searching for again...but from what I researched on the style this one is well crafted."
"awesome oak afed sour beer - this was one of the most complex aged sours i've had - i'm not an expert in these beers and am just getting into them, but this kicked the crap out of the 9 or so others that i've had."
"light, almost watery, but smooth, finishing with tart acidity. spritzy carbonation gives flavor lift and helps with refreshing character."
"I love this beer and think all wild beer fans should give it a try. It is way cheaper than most wild brews, but does not lack the flavor or complexity."
"A decent sour beer here. You should give it a shot."
"4/4/4.5/4/3.5"
"D - Overall great. One of the few sours I could drink all day. The oak isn't present, but the sourness of the brett and lacto make this a more appreciable beer than Supplication or Ommegeddon."
"Woo-hoo! mmm, mm, good beer! Very interesting. Big tropical fruit nose with a lilttle malt and a hint of the flavor to come: sour. Poured with a small head that quickly fades to almost none and a tiny bit of lace. Very clear rich gold color. Flavor is much more dry and much less fruity than the nose would suggest. Very nice carbonation. Tartness lingers on the tip of the tongue. Finish is clean leaves good memories. Not sure if it'd be a session beer."
"Notes: Talk about a complex beer! Wow, totally blow away by this one. I love the interplay between the nutty/oxidized sub-notes and the full-on sour apricot body. Highly recommend for fans of sour beers."
"D: A great sour beer and one of my favorite go to's. I like knowing what I'm going to get with this one."
"D - one of those Belgian beers were you can really only have one at a time because of the unique taste, maybe could have a second if it was paired with some food"
"Purchased a 11.2 fl oz bottle that produced a hazy, golden colored body with almost no head whatsoever and no lace. The immediate taste that came to my mind when first trying this beer was a resemblance to grains with some sourness. Like some of the other Petrus beers, it has some taste, but eventually fades into something that can only be defined as watery. I wouldn't buy this beer again, but I'm not disappointed that I bought it. It lacks character, but it isn't offensive."
"An interesting brew, sours still are a mystery to me, but this is a brew an lovers of sour beers should grab."
"Poured into a basic snifter glass, this ale appears a mildly cloudy golden straw color with about a finger of bone white foam. The foam ebbs quickly down to a thin layer. Nose and flavors are tart, sour lemons, orange zest, fruity green apples, a hint of cider vinegar, funky. A little too much carbonation in this particular bottle for my tastes with a medium body. This unique ale is certainly worth a try."
"Poured a clear golden color with thin white head that dissolves quickly. Nose has a funky aroma of sour, tart light fruit, sugar, oak and champagne. Taste has sour earthy oak taste with hints of light crisp fruit. Very carbonated with nice dry finish. It was ok but not something I would seek out again for sure."
"I sort of didn't realize that this was a sour beer when I bought it. I had my suspicions, but I wasn't sure. Those suspicions were confirmed upon the first whiff. Heavy hints of oak and slight vinegar. I'm not a huge sour beer drinker, but this was actually pretty good. It had that nice malt backbone that tends to distinguish Oud Bruins from, say, a gueze. This went surprisingly well with the berry pie that I was eating at the time. The mouth feel was sort of thin and resiny. This was good, not my favorite style, but one that I'm learning to appreciate. It'd probably drink one again with a dessert sometime."
"Wowsers, I've never tasted anything even close to this before. This is a tart ale. Color was light coper with a thin beige head. The taste was like cider only more intense. It was sooo overwhelming it hurt drinkability IT felt like having lemonade in the mouth it was so strong. The smell was alot like a lemon. This was a unique beer."
"exceptional beer, and unique to say the least. the sourness in this might not be for everyone, but there is an awesome complexity to this that readily presents itself-- especially how well the oak flavor comes through and balances out. A great beer; crisp, refreshing, robust."
"11.2 ounce bottle, with 39681 stamped on the bottle. Served in a Gulden Draak tulip, the beer pours a hazy pale gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention is good, lacing is decent. It smells tart/sour, like sour apples, funk, and some vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, but stronger in the sourness. In this case it's a good thing. I can taste sour apple, vinegar, sour cherries, and a bit of oak and funk. The sourness does die down a little bit after the beer warms up some. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's crisp, dry and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good too, if you like sour style beers, then you would enjoy this one. If you don't like sour beers, then you should probably stay away from this. If in the mood, I'd buy this again. I enjoyed it."
"Pours a hazy yellow with an orange tinge and a short, bright white head that fades quickly to a nice lacing. Smell is tart with lemon-orange zest and Brett. Taste is more biting sour than others of the style. Loads of carbonation at first mask the lemon peel flavor. It's almost hard to taste with so much carbonation. Once your mouth gets used to it the real taste starts to come out. Unripe fruits, granny smith apples and orange rhine. This fades to a sharp lactic acid and a lingering Brett aftertaste. Gods beer but I don't think it fits the style."
"Drinkability- As a neophyte to the sour genre, one is enough. This beer does provide an inviting introduction to the style."
"Overall: I've just started my foray into sours and this is my second favorite behind haanbryggeriet's oak aged sour. Definitely worth a try. Also, this is a great sour that won't break the bank."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Terrible and terrible. Until I can get a new sample it shall remain here. Seriously, any beer that is above 7% should be able to age for a couple of years, especially a Belgian!"
"D - I haven't seen many pale Oud Bruins. A nice blend of flavors that seem to work really well together. One of the best Oud Bruins I have had yet and not a bad price at 3.99."
"d: great balance on a tasty funked-up belgian pale. 7.3% ABV is hidden very well."
"D- Not really a session beer, but upon finishing my glass I'm wanting another... ABV could be dangerous."
"This is the best beer I've had in a while. I'm just getting into the sour beers so I know I cant pick out all the nuances but this is a great beer. Pours slightly hazy golden orange with a nice two finger head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is of some fruit (green apple, pear, and even some grape) with some dry malt and yeast. Overall I'd say the smell is ""funky earthy," whatever the hell that is. Taste is pure tart. The instant it hit my tounge I was immediatly reminded of Sweet Tarts (the candy). I hate to compare beer to a candy, but there was a sweet and funky sour taste to it. I really didnt notice any ""wood"" or ""oak"" taste intially, but there was a distinct flavor on the back of the tounge that had that feeling to it. Mouthfeel was fine, lighter and somewhat crisp, slightly dry and definitely tart after taste. Overall a great beer and an easy drinker. The slightly higher ABV is very well hidden."
"Impressive. This isn't a session brew, but the qualities blend together to create an incredibly enjoyable brew that doesn't show its alcohol at all. I could drink one or two more... and am still craving more. definitely worth trying if sours and funky stuff is up your alley. I'll definitely have to track down a few more."
"D Better than average but this beer demands one's attention. I do not see it as a session beer."
"Bottle: Poured a yellow color ale with an average pure white foamy head with some retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of Brett and oak notes with some barnyard funky notes. Taste is also dominated by some Brett notes with distinctive notes of barnyard and funk. Oak is also present but no vinous notes could be detected. Full body with good carbonation. Very well done and easily drinkable."
"Pours out a hazy gold beer with a one finger head. Moderately carbonated.Sweet /yeasty smell,, different cant quite pinpoint it. WHOA,,the taste. Nothing like ive ever had before. Ive never had this style and i dont really like this taste. Very tart,,nothing i recognize. Dont rely on my opinion,,this could be a style you like,,but its not for me."
"This brew puurs a clear dark golden color with a medium and fizzy white head that burns away steadily. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of sour fruit and Brut champagne. Medium-bodied and dry with a tart fruit character that is mouth-puckering on the first drink. Flavors of sour apple, grapefruit and light yeast in the background. The finish is fruity and leaves a long tart apple aftertaste with a hint of earthy malt. Pretty good overall."
"7/3/8/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"Pours a clear golden color with thin white head that dissolves quickly, leaving little if no lacing. Funky aroma of sour/ tart light fruit, sugar, oak and champagne. Tart earthy oak taste with hints of light crisp fruit. Very carbonated with nice dry finish."
"A yellow color with nice activity and a good white head. The nose is a great sour smell. Very nice. The flavors are sour with some grain in the background. It's a nice sourness not really fruity. The thickness and activity go well with the flavors. This is a rather nice sour beer. Probably one of the best of the Petrus line up."
"Not a bad beer overall. Won't be a favorite of mine, but it is well worth trying."
"Well, this bottle held up well. A distinct treat for sure, and the most affordable sour I have come across."
"this is a great gateway beer for those wanting to dig into the realms of sours, guezes,and other funky and off the radar beers"
"This style isn`t particularily my regular bag, but it`s done well for the style, that tart and sour flavour follows you long into the aftertaste and well after the glass is emptied."
"Leaving sediment in bottle, this brew pours a chilled light amber with a negligible head. Sour, acetic aroma with fruit notes. Taste is quite tart with some residual sourness. Not so sour as to hamper drinkability. Overall flavor is not bad. The most obvious comparison is sour green apples, but some other nuances are perceived (oak). Light body and minimal carbonation. Not well versed in the style, but I did enjoy it. An interesting brew that is a good change of pace from my fresh hop binge I'm currently on. Cheers."
"This beer is Excellent. It is Crisp and refreshing. It has Nice tartness without too much funk. Aroma has hints of green apple and citrus with that classic Flanders back bone. The Aroma does not completely prepare you for the amazing taste and mouthfeel which is reminiscent of champagne but with an additional slightly bitter aftertaste. Would probably pair nicely with green apple and brie like semisoft cheese."
"A really well-crafted beer all around. Highly recommended."
"Oak aged adds a lot to this brew. Maybe too much. Vanilla and oak tannin dominate along with a woody flavor. Some malt and light complexity fill out the mid. Enjoyable brew. Almost refreshing when served cold on a hot day. Very drinkable. Tough to pick out what type of beer it actually is as it just seems like the oak dominates. Not sure I'd buy again, maybe try it from keg or even better an aged version. I just don't see much upside."
"Drinkabiltiy is very good, tasty and highly digestible, sessionable sour. Wow. I forgot how much I love this beer! I used to drink it fairly regularly before I really got into BA, and now with the never ending rotation of near beers, I don't revisit old favorites often enough. I hadn't reviewed this one, and glad I came back to it. This would be an excellent transition beer for white wine lovers. It's also one of the best values in sour beers, about $4.50 for this bottle."
"This is something I could drink a ton of if the price tag would allow me."
"A fine brew, that tickles and revives the taste buds. I love the crisp tartness that comes from the flavor and mouthfeel. There is a nice carbonation and a slight alcohol twinge that all build on the other flavor and scents to yield one helluva beer."
"This one isn't for everyone but it's very well-made and, to me, enjoyable. I have limited exposure to this style but appreciate the great complexity of the offering. With the sour pucker tamed by all other elements, with a little warmth this is quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability is good, a nice beer to enjoy slowly and appreciate all of its character as it opens up."
"Pours a clear tan and has a creamy beige head. The nose really opens up as this reaches cellar temp. There is a base of mild malts and grains followed by tart fruits, musky oak and light funk. The taste has a strong sour/bitter aspect up front followed by musky wood and barnyard funk. Firly light body was a crisp dry finish. Great brew from Bavik. Much better than their Oud Bruin."
"Medium body, crisp, slighty dry finish, medium effervescence. Expected a mellower brew but it was nice stuff."
"Into a wide mouthed chalice, this beer pours a pale gold, a little hazy. Head retention is poor, as it quickly fades to a mere bit of film across the top. Nice aroma though, fruity, with a sour musty overlay. Swirled around in the glass, there are some woody notes as well. The flavor is wonderful, with a lot of tangy fruitiness, dry notes of oak, light phenols... it finishes faintly tannic with lingering sourness. Not funky the way lambics are--think Rodenbach. This is just as good."
"Poured a dirty golden color with minimal head which quickly resolved. Smelled of cherries, apricot, apples, vinegar, and slightly of cinnamon. Doesn't have a very full flavor but tastes almost entirely of mild sour apples Finishes tart and sour. Overall light mouthfeel with good carbonation and leaves the palate fairly quickly leaving a trace of alcohol warmth in its wake. Also singes the top portion of the back of my mouth a bit. A very good example of this style."
"i could go on and on about this very cool and unique beer but im gonna drink instead."
"This beer tasted essentially like an extremely tart white wine. I don't know if my bottle was improperly stored or what but I could barely finish this. All I could taste was sour acid, all traces of 'pale ale' i guess were overtaken by the ageing process."
"Good carbonation, not too aggressive but enough effervescence on the tongue to push they sweetness and give you a crisp finish. Slightly dry finsh. This beer would work as an introductory sour."
"d: Good stuff. Strikes an excellent balances. Most of the sour offerings tend to lean either sour or sweet, but this walks the line right down the middle. I would love to age one of these."
"D: Oh man, this is entirely too drinkable! The 7.3% alcohol doesn't do a thing to me. I can honestly say that this is one of the top 20 summer beers out there for me. It was gone way too quick...damn those 11.2 oz bottles!"
"Mouthfeel is light with higher carbonation. A very drinkable beer."
"This was a good beer, and perhaps my expectations were a bit high, but the flavor was just a little too obvious and left something to be desired. Given the opportunity, I would definitely enjoy this again, but rarely more than one at a time."
"D: A nice crisp, dry tart drinking aged pale that was unique with just enough to keep it interesting and one you could easily drink in multiples due to is smooth and eloquent sourness."
"M + D: Easy to drink, has a little expressiveness, and ultimately rather mild. Maybe a little boring, but not a bad beer by any means."
"Sweet and sour combo that that area is known for works well, with a nice oakiness as well. A sipper to be savored."
"I really dug (digged?) this at a home-tasting. Fantastic find from an unknown (to me, at the time) entity. Brut-ish, bone dry, reminiscent of an unfruited lambic. Pleasantly sour and oaky. Id be curious to try this with a Thanksgiving turkey or some artisan cheeses. A good find!"
"Drinkability: This beer made a great start for the new year! Although there weren't that many different flavors in this beer, the oak and sour fruits filled in the blanks where the other flavors were suppose to be. If you're looking for a great oaky sour beer, then you have to pick this one up ASAP."
"D = Definitely would drink this if offered. Very occasional beer though, not for everyday drinking. Might go well with spicy foods because of an affinity or may complement staple fares because it adds spice. In any event an excellent choice for food"
"Edit: After tasting everything from the six pack, this one is by far the best. In a class of it's own."
"Overall, I think that Oud Bruin has a lot more going on than this one does, but I appreciate the sourness of this one precisely because it is so sour. That said, I think that a Berliner Weiss accomplishes much the same as what this beer is trying to, but better. Granted, if I sessioned this beer I could get wrecked in a way I couldn't with Berliner Weisses, so there is that going for it."
"It's quite sour on the tongue, enough so that the oak is more of an after thought. Hop taste is muted. Sour definitely characterizes the overall taste. Not recommended."
"Pours a very clean medium amber color with virtually no head. What there is is slightly off-white and leaves a couple of random spots of Belgian lace in the tulip glass. The nose is of fermented fruit, vinegar, some earthy hay-like notes, and possibly sour apple. Smells slightly sweet as well. The palate is really very tart up front and hardly yields to a nice woody character. This ale is very tart and leaves the mouth watering. Mouth feel is on the light side, but very crisp and clean like sucking on a sour apple. The woody, earthy mustiness comes through too, lingering in the mouth. Tart and sharply acidic. Oddly, my bottle reads that this ale is only 5.8% alcohol by volume, although it's listed at 7.3% here. I tend to believe my bottle, and my palate, on this one - unless the alcohol is just that well hidden. A true treat and a great example of the oud bruin style, albeit a bit lighter in color. Beers like these are a wonder - I can't stop sniffing and sipping. The tart character of this beer literally makes the mouth water for more. If only I had more ... Superb!"
"Aroma is strong, very malty with a considerable fruity overtone, like apple or pear. Color is a clear golden. Flavor is crisp, strongly fruity - very much like a cider rather than an ale - with a good bitter bite and a hint of sour apple taste. It is fairly smooth but does have an edge to it, and leaves a sour but not unpleasant aftertaste."
"Decent mouthfeel, but the sour, uncharacteristic flavour hamper the drinkability of this a bit."
"Went great with dinner."
"Overall: Beer Advocate lists this as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but I (and other beer sites) beg to differ. To me, its more of a Flanders Pale Ale, in that it tastes a heckuvalot like a Flanders red or brown, only its pale, get it? But, potato, potahto, still and all its a tasty brew if you can handle the tartness. However, whatever characters this beer possesses cannot possibly justify the price. This is one and done for me; Im glad I purchased it as part of a sampler."
"Interesting beer; just not my cup of tea I'm afraid."
"If you do not like sour beers then you will not like this. If I had known that this was a sour beer I would not have bought it so buyer beware. This is basically a training lambic for those that wish to develop a taste for them. I will not be buying this beer again I did not like it."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a bright fizzy gold, with a quickly dissappearing short white head. Aroma is kind of a sweet and sour vinegar - not a balsamic sweetness like you find in the Duchesse. Taste is intensely sour. Not offputting like a certain geuze I could not choke down, but defiantely tart enough to make you take notice. Some sweetnes in there too. Maybe like a granny smith apple. Nothing cloying, but enough to give your taste buds a bit of a repreive. Smooth body, mild carbonation, no trace of alcohol. Drinkability is lower for me becouse of the extreme sourness. This is a dry sipper for sure. Will buy this again."
"D - For a beer that's over 7%, I never noticed it. If you can stand the initial tartness this beer should be quite drinkable for you."
" Judging from the ratings others have given other people got some decent bottles. I didnt. My guess is that air came into the barrel (although there is no hint that this has touched any wood) and turned the beer to vinegar."
"Highly carbonated and light-bodied, sort of like a champagne in a way. I liked the taste of this beer a lot, but due to the high acidity and sourness, I wouldn't be able to drink another in succession. I would try it again sometime."
"Very drinkable. Highly interesting mouthfeel does the trick. Lambic/geuze lovers should find this very appealing. I have to imagine that the age played a large roll in the development of this deeply crafted and almost intimidating level of character."
"really need to try at least once or for very special occasions."
"Summary: First beer I've dumped down the drain. This is the first of a 6 beer Petrus sampler box. I hope the rest are better, aka drinkable."
"M&D - lively and light on the tongue, but again, too sour to be even moderately drinkable, not a fan"
"I've got another '03 bottle cellared indefinitely, i'm curious to try one that has more of age on it. Edit: it doesn't seem to change much over time, wondering if it's pasteurized."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades to a ring leaving a good lace. Pale, cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Sour apple nose. Flavor is sour apples from start to finish, hops and malts stay hidden. True to Flemish sour ale style, drinkable but not my favorite. $4.90 for a 330ml bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The constantly responsive effervescence in the mouth is very nice here... it keeps the flavors alive and moving, with perfect weight and rolling quality. More drinkable than many of the better gueuzes and BSPAs that fit this profile, and certainly more approachable for the beginner. A great aperitif that could easily substatute for champagne before the first course is served."
"Drinkability - a great example of the style I bet, but not to my tastes."
"A review long overdue, right Darren ;>) Thanks for the brew."
"This is a crazy fellow with some serious funk. I found the oak character to be a bit overpowering out of the starting gate, but things tend to meld a bit better as it warmed. I don't usually mind a tart and funky brew, but I guess I just couldnt get over the lingering tequila character (Im not a fan of the spirit). Definitely worth a try--- at least once."
"Most definitely drinkable, but if your tastes don't usually sit on the sour end of things, this will be more of an occasional indulgence. But there's no doubting its quality and depth. Good stuff."
"Pours a light gold color with a head that builds and dissipates quickly. Has a sour smell that is a surprise upon tasting. I wasn't prepared for this, taste is almost wine-like. Has nice carbonation and it sort of grows on you. Yet I don't think this will be the one beer to have when I'm having more than one."
"Notes: I enjoy a tart brew. This is just overbearing and one dimensional."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, small head quickly disapates, some lacing afterwards. Scents of yeast, grapefruit, citrus, and spices. The taste is tangy and slightly bitter, very citrusy, and slightly spicy, the finish is pretty dry. Medium body, very carbonated mouth feel. Alcohol hidden very well. Drinkable, not a bad brew, but most likely will not buy again."
"This brew is a light golden color with a slight haze and a substantial white head. The head leaves a pretty lace. The aroma is interesting and somewhat complextheres a little fruit and a vinous character, brettanomyces is notable, theres some grain and grass smells as well. Yeast and just a touch of alcohol round out the smell. The taste is a dry and a little tart, but backed with a lot of ripe fruit and yeast. The brew is quite carbonated, and leaves a spicy, prickly sensation on the tongue. This is an interesting brew, but not one that Id have all the time."
"Being a recent fan of sour beers I decided to pick this up for tonight. As soon as I opened it I could smell the brett funk which had me salivating. Pour was a pale golden color with a 1 inch head that laced up nicely. Smell is almost entirely brett funk with a hint of yeast and spice on the end. Taste is once again, fairly sour due to the Brett and a bit peppery, really nice once it warmed up a bit. Mouthfeel is tart and acidic. Drinkability is pretty good, i love sour beers so it was a real treat to get again for me."
"Taste however is alot more complex, and I think I have found another favorite being a flemish sour fan. Very tart at first. Almost makes your lips burn for some reason. This was very easy to drink as the alcohol didnt seem present at all. The aftertaste was mild and pleasant."
"A nice experience of a tart, Oak barrel brew."
"Overall: This beer is pretty good. I think I like most sour beers. I will buy it again sometime."
"Only moderately carbonated with a rather thin texture. This isnt all that great a drinking experience, probably would stop at one."
"33 cL Belgian bottle with 2003 on the back label and it looks like there might be some oxidation where the cap met the bottle. It pours a mildly-hazed deep gold, almost amber, with fairly active carbonation and a 1 finger, bone-white, almost frothy head that leaves some nice Belgian lacing. It vinous, musty, and tart with some lactic acidity, dung/barnyard notes, grapes?, wild/funky yeast aromas, and hints of wood. The first sip is unexpectedly tart, with lemony acidic flavors that pinch my salivary glands. In addition, there are vinous malts, very faint hops, a low bitterness, dung, and a lactic acidity. The body is light with medium carbonation and a tannin-like dryness in its medium finish. The beer isn't as tart as the first sip indicated - it's actually pretty mild compared to the Rene Cuvee I had the other day - but there isn't too much going on besides the sour flavors. This is definitely an interesting beer, bordering on gueuze, but I have a hard time drinking sour/acidic beers if there aren't more flavors there to back them up."
"interesting beer to taste. was not really expecting the tartness to be there, so was a surprise to everyone. I can appreciate the beer, but a lot of people in the tasting felt the beer is too sour and don't like the style at all."
"A bit slow to get through. A sipper of a sour Belgain Pale if there ever was one. Hold on to your taste buds with this one is Lambic-like."
"This was only my second Flemish sour, and I was not nearly as impressed with this as my first--Verhaeghe Duchesse De Bourgogne. Poured to a golden pale vcolor wityh medium fluffy, head, decent lacing and lots of carbonation. But whereas the Duchesse was a nice mix of sour early, and sweet later on, this was strictly sour, from start to finish. Aroma of sour green apples and vinegar, carried over into the taste and finally the finish. I actually like Flemish Sours, but this one is not my favorite."
"M&D: the whole structure falls a bit thin for the overall short palate, but the mouthfeel retains a refreshing state, albeit slightly sharp at first--definitely having room for improvement as this old beer is still pretty young in the bottle~~ The well hidden alc. plus a dryish finish ensure pretty good ""quaffability", though. All in all, an interesting beer in need of time to bring more depth and complexity--is it possible for a filtered bottled beer like this?"
"cloudy grapefruit colour with noticeable white crown, generous lace left in glass. Sour flemish aroma, sour apple, somewhat like a wild ale. Numbing sour mouthfeel,with significant carbonation, refreshing. Not for a newbie. Sour apple cider in taste."
"This one is not for a newbie! Also, I fully agree that this is a sour ale and should be labeled as such. However, it is a Belgian and it is strong. Also, I found this beer to be very tasty. The appearance was clear, gold with high carbonation and a nice but short lived head. The aroma and flavor are very acidic and sour from the lactobacillus (I think) with low malt sweetness and some citrus flavors. The hops are subdued. The mouthfeel is light and crisp and finishes very dry. After some thinking, my wife and I think this would go nicely with a lemon cheesecake or something like that. The sourness and acidity would cut through the fat of the dessert but not overpower the sugary goodness. I want 57 more. If you like sour ales, run, I tell ya, run to get some of this."
"Too sour for me right now."
"I think i needed another bottle of this for my review to do it justice. not sure if i liked it or not, to be honest. it was a unique taste and style, and i wouldnt mind having another to think about it further."
"Puckeringly tart beyond anything I've experienced. Tarter than a flanders red, and bone dry to boot. All moisture is instantly sucked back into whatever pore it emerged from when this hits your palate. After the taste buds get a chance to recuperate and realize they are not being attacked, notes of pear and cherry appear with mild notes of rotten wood. I wouldn't classify this as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, or pay $4 again for a small bottle, but worth experiencing once."
"Hazy orange  stark white head  nose cinnamon bread, salt, sour cherries  taste sour bread, acid, red fruit, orange peel, and apricot  dry body- short fresh aftertaste Hazy orange  stark white head  nose cinnamon bread, salt, sour cherries  taste sour bread, acid, red fruit, orange peel, and apricot  dry body- short fresh aftertaste"
"Good overall, but I would not consider this a belgian pale. Way too sour for that category, and I really think it tastes more like a flemish red... reminds me a lot of Rodenbach Grand Cru. A good beer, but should be labeled for what it is...."
"D: Decent sour. Fairly common as far as sours go, but that still means its pretty good. Not as complex as it could be but very refreshing."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are slightly above average. Overall this beer is far too expensive for its return"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It certainly is no pale ale. I've never had a flanders red, but from what I can gather, this is what they taste like. I really enjoyed the distinctness of the flavor. Recommended, but beware, this is not a pale ale."
"All things aside, this is a great beer, and a very refreshing change of pace from my usual flanders red. Highly recommended for sour beer lovers, perhaps a bit much for those just crossing over."
"Beer poured a golden color with a well sustaining head. Nose is of sour apples. Taste is of sour apples and a dry very light hop finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Kind of reminds me of some white wines i have had. Drinkability is OK. This is a beer that is worth a try for the Flanders Red fans!"
"Pours ancient, tarnished, gold lace with a crest of powdered wig. Lace in the withdrawal. Aroma is nasal scorching vinegar and wet saddle leather, perhaps from a French dragoon or the Scots Greys in Flanders. Taste is sour tincture of lime or a similar anti-scorbutic with sharp acidic notes cresting like a wave in the throat and sinuses. A rare blonde sour treat...awesome. A must try for fans of all things sour and funky... or should I say a musty try..."
"Worth a try -- you'll love it or hate it."
"This is a very refreshing beer, and the 7.3% is invisible. I think it is finally beginning to turn (possibly 3 years old now) but has been excellent up until now."
"Not one that I would drink a 6pack of in a night. If your turned off by the sourness then your just a wimp."
"Pours out a small head that goes away and leaves a lacing that's kinda weak. The color is golden like champagne. Smell is sour, so is the taste. It's very fruity and sour at the same time. Mouthfeel is very good and I wouldn't mind having another one of these."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow color with a small head that fades fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very sour with some apples and cherry notes on top of some band-aid. The flavor is puckeringly sour. Lots of sour apples and cherries. Seems very thin and one-sided. The sourness sticks to the palate. The drinkability is a little rough due to the extreme sourness."
"Pours clear golden yellow with lots of fizz, but little head or lace. Smells quite oaky and winey, lots of vanilla and nose-tingling alcohol spice. Aggressive sour flanders red-like attack, building a slightly sweet roundness in the middle before finishing super dry, spicy and creamy. Moderately light and slightly over-sparkly body. A tasty and unusual beer. Looks like a pale ale, but tastes like a hybrid strong golden ale and sour red ale."
"Drinkability: At around $4 a bottle, this is a good treat, especially if you're sick of the same old beer styles. I've become a huge fan recently of the sour side of brewing, and this is no exception. And the alcohol is hidden extremely well and is hardly discernible."
"Drinkability: Lovely to sip on and spread across the tongue as it plays upon the different taste receptors"
"The mouth is medium with good carbonation and lots of pucker. I really enjoy this beer and could have several more before the abv gets me."
"this beer is meant for pairing with food imo, in all seriousness I just ran around the homestead tasting this with all sorts of stuff, it really brings out salinity in things.. even no salt added pretzels. I would bet this would kick ass with some chowdah! damn !"
"This is a unique beer that just clicks with me. Quite tasty. It kicks the shit out of you and leaves you wanting more--zaps you in the chest."
"Aroma is very sour with hints of wood, sour cherries and faint floral notes. Slightly cloudy yellow/gold color with a fast fading pale white head. Fore is woody and sour..slighty thin. Hints of rosehips, herbs and other floral flavors. There are also crisp sour apple notes with a bit of acidic citrus tang in the finish. Pretty nice and lighter and crisper than most I have had of this style."
"Kind of addictive taste once you get over the shock. Like sour candy."
"This is quite a nice beer to drink, but in the end it is not nearly as complex as I would like it to be. Without the malt character of a sour brown or red, it really needs some more funkiness to it to strike a balance with the dominant acidity."
"-UF"
"This is an infinitely complex beer that oozes Old World quality and charm. It's obvious that great care has been taken in its creation. So too should great care be taken in its consumption. Petrus Aged Pale is, quite simply, beautiful beer."
"The alcohol is never noticeable; and for those that enjoy/accept/can get past the brazen acidity this is a superbly refreshing and remarkably palate-cleansing and invigorating beer! Magnificent!!!!"
"A great beer that completely caught me off guard."
"11.2 ounce bottle, no freshness dating."
"Drinkability- Reminds me of a red flanders more than anything. Kind of like a Duchesse. Just as good also if not better. This is no session beer. A sipper to be sure."
"Drinkability: For someone that doesn't drink many Belgian ale's I don't recoment this beer. It's not a good start into the belgian world, just a little rough, unless you like the sour. I feel that I failed this beer. It's much too good for my non-sophisticated pallet. :( I'll work on it."
"D- Very interesting pale ale. It has some sour notes and hints of lemon but its not a bad lemon, very crisp and clean."
"now we'll never know."
"Sorry, but that is where the good times ended. The smell and flavor were sour, earthy, and animal in nature. It was painful to drink and I didn't finish it. I was making faces and gutteral noises like the losers on Fear Factor. Without a few grand sitting in the wings, I won't be tackling this brew again."
"On the nose are layers of soda, including, but not limited to: vanilla, lime, cola, peach and cherry, the whole Towne Club line it seems. Remarkable flavors ride a wave of fat fizz starting with something similar to licking sap directly off the bark of a sugar maple then rapidly narrowing into an acidic flume of limeade. I'll drink more."
"No dating. Was gifted this one, so who knows the age. A few yeasty chunks floating around up to the white frothy head that sat in a ring and dusting. Lemon juice scented, cellard, bit vineous, slightly musty. The carbonation is so mellow, but the gentle bubbles just slightly bite your lips when the glass comes to your lips. The carb is nice and tight. Bitey and shap, pungent flavors, almost hars, but sooo good. Very aged tasting, cellared and lovely. Bit bitter, sharp at the edges and back of your tongue, and then the top of your mouth. Not too sharp that it locks you up like a guezuze, nice. Good as a sipper, the flavors are there to be experienced and thought about."
"Aromas of mountain honey and whole grain biscuits are carried on a wave of briny, barrel-aged applesauce. The flavors are very sour. Acidity interlaces with melting fruit, nuts and buttery crust flavors. Notes of vanilla are beaten down by crabapple and lime sourness. The gas is lively. Extremely refreshing. Finishing aromatics of lemon flesh, fino sherry, wild grasses and blooms make it hard to stop drinking this beer. The texture is not without seams though. A little more extract and this would be a perfect beer. It's an albino Rodenbach Grand Cru of old. Amazing."
"I was very highly disappointed with this beer. There is not really anything good that I can say about it. It poured to a clear strawberry blonde color with very little head that faded to absolutely nothing. The smell and taste were horrid, like drinking vinegar straight. I ended up pouring this out less than half way through. I never thought I would see the day where I wasn't even able to finish a beer. As bad as they are, I've always been able to finish a cheap macro lager, but not this, which was unfortunately rather costly as it is a belgian import. I would definitely not recommend it."
"This brew is a lighter-orange, hazy body, fairly small white head on the top. Great scent, mixture of bubbly gum sweetness, fruity tones, and malts. Intense rush of flavors for generous carbonation. Smooth malt, somewhat sour, lemon zest, bread, some bitter hop, and a slight hint of alcohol. This is a pretty solid beer id say"
"This is a wonderful beer, but candi sugar and more malt sweetness would make it absolutely delicious. If only it tasted as good as it smelled. Still, this is great stuff and I would gladly drink it again."
"Poured the bulk of this one out."
"33 cl bottle. Pours a clear straw pale gold colored with a fizzy white head. Streaming carbonation after head settles. Honey and sour, flowery nose, earthy and oaky. Tastes like honey at first and then gets gripping sour and dry notes in the finish. Oak aging is present throughout. Healthy carbonation keeps it crisp on the palate. This is a very nice beer for many reasons. It drinks like a Flemish red or brown except it has pale characteristics. Like a Chardonnay versus a Cabernet in the sense that they're both dry, but are essentially different. I don't even drink wine."
"Bottled, thanks to mat. This was so good, just amazingly sour and tart, really wild oaky character, so well balanced, juicy and refreshing, lemony and some funky earthy barnyard stuff going on, i justed wanted to drink more and more and more. great beer. yum."
"Complex, refined and great for the style but beyond the sourness, there isn't much flavor here, nor body. Lemon, grapefruit and green apple are present in the back of the palate. Totally different from red ales and oud bruins I have had in the past."
"Clear, peachy-gold in hue with just a tickle of amber interwoven. There is no animation yet a bubbly white head of one finger in height formed. Not surprisingly the head retention was fair, at best. Before long the head fizzled to a loose cap, soapy with naked pockets. Subsequent lacing was spotty. The appearance is pleasant but dull. The nose is vibrantly acidic, awesome! Sharp lemony notes dominant, hints of wood at the back. There is some distant spice and alcohol. Peppery. Minty. Light yeasty funk. Everything aside from the acidity is light to faint in potency. While I cant call the nose complex, I cant call it simplistic either. It is very inviting with enough layers to damn near force me to drink. Well, the nose didnt lie. The palate is very acidic. My first sip shocked me a bit. I got over it, needless to say. Lemony flavors developed, dry in the middle, woody too with faint hints of pepper and mint. Right before the finish there is a juicy burst but the finish is dry and quick to end. Overall the palate is lackluster as there isnt much going on. Sure I like what I taste but I want more of it and more complementary flavors as well. I must complement the fact that I cant taste the alcohol. The very light carbonation is noticeable and more is needed. Medium in body but it feels a bit too light. Empty. Also the aftertaste is too clean, did I just sip a Belgium ale? My mouth says no. Overall, this beer doesnt impress me at all. I dont think Ill bother with this one again as there are many better beers akin to this one. For some unknown reason I put off sampling this beer since February. I bought my bottle in Iowa City. Disappointing."
"Once I got past that weird smell this was rather enjoyable. Light, crisp and refreshing."
"This beer poured a golden color and formed a small, bubbly white head that left circular lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of cherry, vinous quality with some wood aspects. A flavor of cherry vinous with some lemon present with a touch of grain. A sourness/tartness one would expect in this type with a slight astrigent aspect."
"Thanks Rodolito for a rare and marvellous example Appearance is first a surprise, but you get to love it like a child who's the smallest of his class by a head. This can't be clearer, I see my finger prints through it, but the head my friends is the perfect white, sticky as if it weren't enough. The body is pure liquid gold, very shining, spectacular one may say. Very effervescent from the outside look. Aroma of wet hay, apple cider, grass (saison anyone?), a bit of funk, a definite sour touch, dry, not unlike a good champaign, grassy. Isn't this well structured and beautiful? In mouth, this is also reminiscent of champaign, very white wine alike in the dryness. Lightly bitter finish which adds a new complexity. Moderately malty with peaches and pears flavors. It's mostly about the delicate dryness though, puckering and hayish. Mouthfeel is quite biting, thin-medium and a nice fit. I feel I don't have the words to do it justice though, there'd be a lot more to say, but it's hard to be put in words. Very complex for sure and rather tart with gueuze character. Lovely dry aftertaste. I think this would be hard to drink in any kind of large quantities though, just like champaign once again. Truly in a class of its own and worth seeking out."
"It pours a dark gold with a slight haze and a thin white head. It is musty smelling and I can tell it is going to be sour. I like it already. The body is lean with some wood barrel notes. The sourness hits up front, but it is malty enough to keep it from being too puckering. There are some honey and floral flavors. It finishes with some oak and warming alcohol."
"From the typical 11.2 oz brown bottle, it pours a slightly hazy golden-orange with a frothy white head. The smell is tart with some citrus notes, but the smell doesn't really prepare you for the taste. This stuff is t-a-r-t, tart: almost gueuze-like in its ability to pucker every orifice in the body. Although it's a bit of a shock at first-even for the normally tart style-it seems to mellow after a few sips and a bit of warming. It's certainly not an all-day beer, but it's another nice example of one of my favorite styles."
"& Mouthfeel: Lip smacking tartness upfront subsides as soon as the palate becomes accustom to the level of acidity. Oak flavours draw the mouth towards dry yet there is just enough sweetness from the grain to meld with the tartness for a sweet-tart juicy middle. Hints of earthiness show a complex yeast. Faint sherry character as the warmth of the alcohol becomes more apparent with its slightly ester profile. Finishes with more wood on a dry note."
"Petrus Aged Pale Grand Reserve was served from a 330 ml bottle depicting a pair of rugged Belgian men handling an oak barrel suspended from a chain. The beer was poured into a chalice style glass, with a fizzy head rising and quickly falling to become a ring and scattered spots of foam, leaving fine persistent lacing. The murky glowing pale peach liquid was alive with fizzy vigor, like a magical potion. The aged pale was also alive in the nose, spewing out potent clouds of tart fruit candy powder, late harvest grapes, and acidic, oaky pinot noir. The taste was crisp and dry, with a moderately acidic peachy tartness held up by an excellent body...full, smooth, and perfectly carbonated. It finished with a quickly diminishing dry acidity, leaving only faint traces of tart essence on the palate. Good, but a little short on the finish. This was an enjoyable sour beer that I would recommend to fellow fans of sour/tart beers."
"Finish is actually smoothly acidic disappearing off the palate yet leaving a bit of sweetness on the lips."
"Appearance: Golden amber with a nice sized frothy white head leaves more than abundant lacing, I'm happy so let's move on. Aroma: Very tart to the nose with a cidery dry finish to the nose here not much hop profile apparent but the tartness sure sticks out like a sore thumb. Taste: Coats the palate with a balanced tart sensation letting out a meaty malt profile with sweet flavor that came with the aging and the oak barrel definitely shines it's light through in the flavor of this aged ale. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied ale with a puckering effect on the palate that gives my taste buds a craving for more of the same. Drinkability: In closing all hail the flemish style pale ale from Petrus it brings joy to I this fine evening."
"A MUST TRY if you see it. Excellent!"
"Notes: A beautiful beer, as the beer caresses the mouth the tartness awakens the taste buds. Very refreshing and a perfect pair to a simple goat cheese. This beer is not for quaffing, sip and savour every drop."

"Turbid dark golden hue. Lean, but steadfast white head yields sparse lace. Pungent, barbed waft of acetic acid hits the nose upfront. Fruit, of a woefully underripe green apple nature, ensues along with understated notes of soured, tannic oak. Quite enticing aromawise. Cuspate lactic tartness is incipient in flavor, but is softened promptly by suggestions of crab apple and sourdough. Rounded enteric horse and hay notes emerge mid palate, but are subdued enough not to perturb the simple tart apple character. Very well attenuated, with an initially prickly, lanky mouthfeel softened by suspended yeast. Imperceptible dextrins or residual protein. Notes of oak augment as the brew warms and add depth to the pervasive tartness. Finishes bone dry and abrupt, with a snap of sour currant and ethanol warmth. An intense, yet balanced brew. Very much like an aged Gueuze in its mixed acid character, although obviously richer in ethanol. Very tasty, and most worthy of a larger, 750 ml portion. 11.2 oz is insufficient."
"Pours a pale golden hue with a light foamy head. Smells like it tastes: very acidic, with some citrusy notes. Very gueuze-like. Best served somewhere between room and fridge temperature, the flavor blooms as it warms. I don't know, I'm not really a fan of this one. It did pair well with some fresh mozzerella, with the acidity contrasting nicely with the softness of the cheese. Still, there's not much there, just a mouthfull of bitterness."
"Overall Impression: A neutral beer Petrus makes to blend with their regional offerings. It is also intended for export to the US, though it is not for sale here commercially. That's OK because I'd rather spend my time with a good gueuze instead of this stuff. I ordered this one based on my server's recommendation, but I wished that I had disregarded him instead."

"Drinkability  Ill give my bottom dollar to the guy that can chug this bottle. This is a sipping wine (I like it before dinner or late at night). It doesnt really go good with any foods, IMO. My penchant is to take this style on an empty stomach, preferably while sitting in front of the tube watching the Ms play ball."
"Ok. I'll admit this beer is way over my head as far as my experience with a with a wide range of beers. I had never had anything quite like this. the yeast yields a near cider fruit flavor. the mouthfeel is still full and the finish is fruity and light with a citric aftertaste. The whole flavor is absolutely out of this world and the drinkability is second to none."
"I like the sourness with alomost a vinegary flavour. Very drinakable and recomeneded."

"I'm a BIG fan of all things Belgian (beer that is). I received this as part of the Belgian Beer of the month club, and thought it was the most disgusting thing I have ever drank in my life (even worse than a Caribe Shandy). I can't believe that others have rated it so highly. The beer was so sour that I thought it had gone bad. Apparently I am not a fan of sour beers. I will definitely avoid any others I come across. The Petrus looked halfway decent in the glass, but thats the only positive thing I can say about it."
"The pour is a lightly foggy gold or straw color, the head is massive, and the lace in firm sheets that clings to the glass till the very end. both a brilliant white, but alas they do desiccates to quickly for my liking. Nose is has an unmistakable tartness that borders on being astringent, also there is malt, citrus, and Oak undertones, an interesting nose to be sure. Front is malt, but the massive sourness hits you immediately, the top skimpy, the finish is devastatingly acidic, pertinently hopped, dry as a bone aftertaste. One damn fine beer, I've not sampled a great number of ""Red/Sour"" beers, but I do like this beer."
"This is a very unique beer in my experience. It's strong, has a musty (but pleasant) smell. It's sweet with a bite. It's very different and at first sip most people are a bit taken back. Try try again."
"This beer you definatly have to go in with a clear mind,knowing that this beer is like nothing you have ever had before.Rustic nose and you can smell the tartness.First thought was this taste like Rodenbach Grand Cru,and I thought that bottle was bad,come to find out that is the style,who would have thought.So please go in to these beer with the knowledge that they are different."
"But I've got to back up for a moment.  Initially, the smell intrigued me.  Very sweet and spicy, with a mix of fruits and a touch of honey and yeast thrown in.  I knew this was going to be something different.  I loved this beer at the first sip.  It has a sour tartness, along with with a fair malt sweetness.  The sweet and sour flavors causes a pleasantly bizarre blend that I honestly cannot explain fully.  I'll just have to stick with my original, though not very eloquent, statement that Petrus Aged Pale 'kicks ass!!'"
"The first sip I had of this beer instantly reminded me of Rodenbach (for very good reasons).  Nicely complex, sweet sour beer in the flanders style.  Definitely requires some getting used to, but most people I have shared the beers with ended up enjoying after the initial shock :)  As you move the beer around your mouth (as is common with this style), the flavor profile will change fairly dramatically.  Drinks almost like a good wine.  Petrus Aged Pale is a very refreshing wine-like beer, great for summers spent lounging in a deck chair."
"Man oh man, what a beer.  First of all, if you're new to the Flanders' style ""sour"" beers, be prepared for your next beer epiphany.  The first sip puckers your face inside out.  Don't judge the beer yet, keep going and you'll become hooked.  The intermingling of sweet/sour is simply amazing.  Extremely complex yet refreshing.  Seek it out."
