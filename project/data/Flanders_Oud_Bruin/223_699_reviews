"Cloudy brown with an off white head.  Sweet and sour smell with some ripe fruit notes.  Taste is  sour with fruit notes like cherry and prune.  Also some nice wood undertones.   Medium mouthfeel with a dry finish.  I'd recommend this to a wine drinker as an avenue into the beer world.  Very good!"

"Really starting to dig this style. Poured a dark brown (hint of ruby at the edges), thin ring of off-white head. Classic light vinegar, cherry, sour/lactic undertone, tempting nose... evolved as the bottle warmed up. Tart cherry, fresh but slightly acidic vinegar note, hint of oak. Delicious. Dry finish. Tingly tart small bubbles. Reminiscent of Duchesse or CdJR, but a good deal less intense. Good intro bruin, IMO. Fully enjoyable diversion from the norm. Maybe this will become the new norm."

"This beer is an old style mash beer. Sour taste but not to heavy!"

"Overall- The most sour beer I have ever tasted to date.  I enjoyed it, but this is a beer I would only drink one at per sitting."
"Refreshing. Like a sour cranberry and vodka. From 12 oz bottle 3/14"
"Good. Like a lot. Early sips I thought it wasn't a that good, but as I kept drinking it felt like a smooth cranberry sour drink. Smooth and enjoyable. I need to try again early in my session to really appreciate."

"Tangy and tart but with an undertone of sweetness, like Rodenbach. Woody notes and a little dark fruit. Dry, yeasty finish. Really a pleasant sipping brew and not at all like the American extreme sour style. On tap at Fathom on the pier on Shelter Island, San Diego."

"It was ok but not my favorite. I had two others in similar style. I prefer the lighter colored Flemish ales. Birthday gift from garys in basking ridge"
""
""
"I expected a more tart beer from what I read in these reviews.  In that respect I was disappointed, but if I ignore this it was a solid beer.  There are apple cider vinegar notes here and there, so beware of that.  Otherwise, this is a beer if grab on occasion if the price or mood is right."
""

"Wonderful taste of cherries and smooth finish. Could drink this forever."
"This one isn't for me.   Had about a half glass and dumped the rest.  Too sour, kinda nasty."
"O - I really like this one. Very well done sour beer."

"Was curious about this beer and I'd definitely order it again. Subtlety tart and fruity, it's a nice compliment to your meal."
""
""
"For the style this beer really left me wanting more. Not nearly as tart and funky and many other Oud Bruins I've tried. I suppose it's a great starter for someone not as adventurous to try and get into this style."
""
""
""
"Overall: very tasty Our Bruin. Some of the cherry syrup aromas had me worried this would come off overly sweet but this plays well. Surprisingly drinkable, a nice treat."
"A different beer than the Bellegems, as far as I can tell, or perhaps this is an older vintage?  Pours a medium amber color with a white head and really no sediment.  Aroma is wine like, with sweet and sour characteristics.   This brew is sweet, to sour, with toffee and tartness rounding out the flavor profile.  There is a pleasant malt flavor throughout, and tartness follows.  The beer finishes clean and mild, easily drank and quite enticing.  Would certainly recommend this beer for personal use or to share with a special someone."

"O- Not the best Oud Bruin but a good starter beer for people not used to sours. Tasted like a light Belgian dubbel that was slightly tart."
""

"Pours a hazy, brown color.  1/4 inch head of an off-white color.  Decent retention and slight lacing.  Smells of tartness, cherries, hint of roasted malt, sweet malt, and yeast.  Fits the style of a Flanders Oud Bruin.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with average carbonation level.  Tastes of hint of roasted malt, sweet malt, yeast, hint of caramel malt, and tart cherries.  Overall, decent aroma, good blend, but a little weak body."

"Clear mahogany beer with scanty tan head, vanishing in seconds. Aroma is sour, red berries, vinegar, caramel. Taste is tart, more malty, than flanders red, some oak notes, cherry, lambic feel on a palate. Medium body and moderate carbonation."

"It's great to be finding another great oud bruin for a change, I'll be remembering this one for sure."
""
"O: 3.75 This is a fine beer and a decent example of an oud bruin. It’s not quite sour enough and there’s not a lot of complexity, however this is an easy drinking beer and maybe a good intro to sours (if you don’t want to try Rodenbach for some reason)."
""
""

""
""
"25 cl bottle (10 12 14) into a tulip. Clear amber brown body, small light tan head, little lacing. Sweet and sour smell of brown sugar, dark fruits, sour cherry and oak. The taste starts with tart vinegar, sweet and sour cherry and raspberry in the middle and dry sour vinegar in the end. Light body, medium carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. An interesting sour beer with flavor. Sour but not overwhelming. The first oud bruin I've had and I liked it."

"O: I tend to love any beer in this style, and this one leans towards how I love it. Unsweetened, apparently not fruited, traditional."

"Probably one of my favorite sours, sour but not super sour. On par with price with most sours (5 bucks for 11.2 oz)"
""
""
""
"O: The oak was very heavy (relatively speaking) in this beer and took away from the overall flavor profile for me. The classic cherry pie flavor was there with good complexity but the balance was thrown off with the oak. That being said, I would get this beer again because it was an interesting take on the style – over oaking that is."
"Good drinkable, different change from a traditional beer. Malts with a gentle sour taste."

"Very drinkable and no doubt quite refreshing in the heat; save your session IPAs, pilsners, blondes and shandys for yourself. I'd much rather have one of these or a proper Bavarian hef."

"Poured from a corked 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted on 11/8/2014."

"Nice reddish copper appearance. Aroma is slightly metallic? That seems a bit odd. Taste is very nice up front with a tart sourness of grapes and some slight cherry, but peters out too quickly. If this had a better finish (like the Cuvee Jacobins) this would be an awesome beer."
""
""
""
"O: pretty good, pretty dry... fruity, but not sweet... bright flares jostling the palate, but not quite refreshing... can say it does seem to ignite the appetite"
"really well balanced sour with notes of spice, pepper, and lot of cherry, raspberry, strawberry, sourness is nice. carbonation is a little heavy, kind of distracting on certain sips, still its almost up with jacobins, as far as what I can get my hands on in this same category of beers"

"A very nice sour, one of the better ones I can think of, and well worth trying for fans of the style and newcomers alike. Very nice balance and flavor."
""
""
"Overall: I highly recommend this beer for spring/fall. Personally, I find the fruit notes far to prominent for summer, but for late spring and all throughout fall, this one is ideal."
"OVERALL- A disarmingly spritely oud bruin, that is lighter, more quenching and refreshing than richer examples. I get the impression that this is either a very young beer or chemically synthesized lactic acid has been introduced. It lacks the charisma of better examples but still makes for an interesting glass and at 5.5 abv this would be great bottle to bring out to parties, picnics, etc... would revisit this but would not pay much for it. Just read on the label that it is actually a blend of brune and lambic, which explains a lot, and makes me appreciate it a little more. Odd product."

""
""
"Poured a brownish body (light brown - muddy brown - not to great with describing the color) with decent head and lace on top of an aroma that has some sour and sweet patches intertwining with each other, but mostly am getting some dark fruit like plums and figs. Taste/mouthfeel more of the same as light to medium bodied, smooth, easy to drink, not too familiar with this style but have a had a few and this one is real good. There is a balance and mix of sweet and dark fruits with a spicy edge and at times a little tart/sour cherry flavor."
""
""
""
"Really not much to say except this is really good. Oud Bruins, for me, always seem classy and sophisticated and this fits the bill. Not very tart or sour if you will. Easy drinker."
""
"Taste is sweet and sour dried fruits up front, turned and slightly vinegary, metal, hints of steak sauce and tamarind, hint of wet wood., with some toasty bread crust in the finish. It is full bodied, fairly complex, lively, engaging, and zesty, fairly dry with a light leaning to the sweet and sour."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather tasty and easy drinking sour. Not the best out there, but very enjoyable."
""
"Overall- This is a beer I see on the shelves all the time, and I decided to buy one yesterday. Similar to a not nearly sour Cuvee Jacobins. Nice beer that would be a great foray into sours for someone."
""
"O: real tasty, a little sweet but a great example of a flemish bier."
""
"a very cool version of the style here, not as sour as many of them. its a blend of a flemish red ale and a young lambic, giving this beer a rounded flavor and tartness, without the caustic acidity of other oud bruin types. more brown than red on the pour, hazy and dense, with a deep mahogany glow and less than an inch of cream colored foam. the nose is fruity as they come, tart cherries and maybe even raisins give an orchard sort of sweetness to this, and chocolate and dark amber malts unite in a rich lathery body with a bit of sweetness as well as a lactic tartness from the lambic. the wheat malt there doesnt add much, but the mild acidity is a nice contrast to the red fruit finish. complex and drinkable, more so than a lot of these. well carbonated, but i notice the lushness of the feel before the bubbles. its expanding on the palate and creamy too, down easy. a very impressive offering, especially at around 5 bucks a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Great head, yet little lacing. Nose is woody and fruity. Bready with a little fermented fruit. Crisp, fruity, with a little body; well-balanced. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle, into a Petrus chalice."
"A delicious Oud Bruin. I wish it had a bit more body and a longer finish, but it's still heavenly. Perhaps not as complex as Goudenband or Duchesse but still highly recommended."
""
""
"Had from a bottle. Poured into a tulip glass. It pours brown with a tan head. On the aroma I picked up the lactic sour with a little bit of vinegar. Has a little fruit nose to it, not that noticeable. You taste the sour right away but it quickly fades. It has a distinct malt taste at the back of the palate. I also get hints of cherries. It is definitely medium bodied, not as much carbonation. Overall this is an amazing sour. It is not expensive and very palatable."
""
""
"Bottom Line: If you like sours or reds, must buy. Fruit beer loves should give it a shot too. It's not all that expensive either, so it might be a good transitory beer for folks not used to the style or sours in general."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste is very good with semi dry malt flavor with fruity tangy and almost sour/sweet flavor from yeast with slight malt sweetness with a light raisiny accent and mild caramel toward the middle with minimal spice in the finish and mild alcohol in the taste. This is a very good example of an Oud bruin, I would drink this again without hesitation."
""
"Random pick off the shelf this week. Pours a tan, less than average head. About 25 on the SRM scale. Nice color! The lace stuck to the side of the glass like glue, very impressive. The label claimed aroma of cherry and raisins, honestly I didn't pick up the raisins but I don't have the best trained nose. Earthy and tart to me. Those same aromas were reflected in the taste. I like sour beers so I may be partial to this one. It was pretty good. Mouthfeel was smooth, lingering tartness that makes the back of your mouth pucker. I would recommend and think it would pair well with grilled pork chops."

"O: The label on this beer describes everything I could ever say about it – two guys, happily smiling, toasting with simple glasses full of fizzy beer. With a profile that’s light, approachable, and refreshing, this sour ale is the epitome of a no-frills, drinkable delight."
""
"One of my two or three favorite examples of this classic Flemish style. Such a rounded flavor and an excellent body. Complex yet so refreshing you could guzzle it if you are not careful."
"Overall, this is tasty stuff. It's perhaps a little bit sweet, but it's well crafted with plenty of classic characters. Very tasty stuff."
""
""
""
"O - A solid sour. I would recommend this to just about anyone that appreciates a high-quality sour. I really want to give this one another shot. I am tasting it as I write this review, and I can tell that my opinion of it may change with my mood or state of my palate."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-amber coloring with a thin, filmy, off-white ring of surface head. Nose of fruit tart, with a blend of apple, cherry, and raisin with an earthy undertone. Flavors are tart and earthy forward, providing a very smooth blend of flavors. Tart cherry and apple lead the charge, with an earthy and woody backbone and some old world fruit rich and sweet to follow. Very well balanced, and the tart flavors are in the spotlight, but the beer remains drinkable and dynamic. The aftertaste is rich and tart, with a light, smooth, crisp feel and a slight effervescence into the finish. Very balanced and palatable for the style. Tasty brew."

"Gotta be the only place in the area I can get this stuff on tap (unless Firkin wants to throw me for a loop some day). It pours a deep ruby-sienna topped by a half-finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises spicy red wine grapes (I'm thinking a particularly peppery Tempranillo here), rich caramel, a hint of graham cracker, light plum, mild black cherry, and a feathers' touch of red wine vinegar. The taste brings in more of the same, but whatever tartness was present before has been sanded down to a strong occasional stab adrift in a sea of sweet malts, mild peppery spices, and oxidized sherry. The blend, though, seems to work, leading to a pleasant, easygoing drink that may have been less likely had the tartness retained its former strength. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, a nice bruin, something that doesn't wow or overwhelm, but something that delivers some interesting and unique flavor combinations and an enjoyable time."
"O-I am pretty disappointed in this beer. Complexity is lacking and I could not get over the oxidized, saccharine flavors. Perhaps I got an old bottle? On the plus side, it is pretty good-looking for the style and the feel is well-suited for the style, too."

"Disappointingly bland. I had higher expectations having enjoyed Cuvee des Jacobins. I didn't get much tart or sour taste out of this. Fairly refreshing on this hot day, so I can't complain entirely. But I'd definitely rather be drinking something else."
""
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/11/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of sour cherry, raspberry, cranberry, raisin, red wine vinegar, funk, light clove, oak, herbal, caramel, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, raspberry, cranberry, red wine vinegar, oak, clove, light pepper, caramel, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, raspberry, cranberry, red wine vinegar, clove, herbal, pepper, caramel, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Flanders brown ale. All around nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with moderate oak presence; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"An attractive, deep coppery red colored body with a small, short-lived head. Sour dark fruit aromas give way to a rich, toasted caramel maltiness. Berries, cherries, and raisins...just a bit acetic. Full, smooth, tart fruity flavor - black cherry and grape - less malt, more vinous notes, and some very light sherry. Some breadiness is perceptible underneath. Medium bodied and tart. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"and i love the laurel and hardy characters on the front label..."
"This is a sophisticated beer, suitable for conversation with friends. Despite strong sourness and flavor in the aroma, the various interrelationships within this beer are quite delicate. Warmth brings out a contemplative character."
""
""
""
"O: A very good, mild sour. Not near as tart as others, and for that reason, this ale could be recommended to folks who do not like extremely tart sours. This was a gift, so I'm not sure of the price, but I would likely buy this in replace of other Belgian Flanders."
""
""
""
"O- My first flanders ale, I have mixed feelings on this one. On one side, it's better than I expected. On the other, it's like drinking sour wine."
"Pair this beer with BBQ or, some Mexican street tacos with extra grease, cilantro, onion, and jalapeño. And if your feeling especially adventurous, pair this beer with vanilla bean ice cream and boysenberry pie"
"A nice beer my 500th review too."
""
"O: A superior example of a Bruin. Very much a drinkable beer."
""
""
"very enjoyable and a great sipper"
"Overall: I dig. Very refreshing with good fruit flavors. Their is good tartness to it that doesn't yell at you at ever sip but move it across the palate and it shows up. Very enjoyable beer."
"Final Thoughts: I've only had a handful of sour ales but Bellegems Bruin will definitely stick out in my mind as one of the most drinker-friendly. While it's not quite as tart as I had hoped for, its smooth and mellow nature makes up for that. Would I drink it again? Yes, especially if sharing with someone who is curious to try the style."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
"T: Really well made. The sweetness and tartness are very well balanced, leaving a beer that sour and non-sour fans alike should really like. A nice mix of red grapes, slightly tart cherries, velvety smooth malt, red and green apple and some raisin. Tart but not overly sour. Very nice."
""
"Overall: Like a wild ale, I would love to try more of this style."

"M - Beautiful! I think the age has eliminated some of the carbonation, but beautiful feel. I'd really like to see how this is fresh."
""
""
""
"Described as a blend of a brown ale & an 18 month old lambic. A nice refreshing sour. Good carbonation and assertive tartness at first but then drops off quickly. Thin mouthfeel... leaves you wanting more. Successive sips build the mouthfeel. Nice almost sour cherry taste without being mediciny at all. A bit pricey but a very nice flanders brown. I will buy this again, but probably for special occasions."
"Will buy again."

"Drinkability is phenomenal, this is a close to perfect as it gets, a benchmark example of the style."
"The beer pours a dark candy brown, with a lovely creamy white head that sits at a finger’s width above the beer. In the light and in the glass, though, the beer is beautifully dark ruby in color, with some slight muddling in the color to suggest brown maple syrup. Lacing is thin and tendril like along the walls of the glass. The body appears to be clean and free of particles, but is really quite opaque to the eye. On the nose, the beer smells strongly of cherry leather and funk, with big fruity waftings and a light barnyard funk lying beneath everything that just barely touches upon less appealing smells. The smell actually begins with a nice malty base, but that is swiftly washed away by the funk and fruit. On the tongue, the beer tastes tart with wonderfully fruity notes that move mostly in the tart cherry range, but do hint slightly at other fruits. The funk detected in the nose is lighter in the taste, but still present in the background of flavor. The beer begins with light funk before quickly opening into sweet fruity cherry notes with some mild leather to suggest the funkier side of the beer. The finish mingles light funk and fruit beautifully, and the aftertaste rings with a surprisingly salty sour funk, while still hinting at the cool fruity cherry. In the mouth, the beer feels light to medium in body, with some fierce prickling from the carbonation, though it remains smooth other than that. The mouth is left neutral, with only the slightest watering at the sides of the tongue. Overall, this is a lovely light wild beer. It tends more towards the fruity side of the road, but suggests some nice funk notes while still holding onto the fruit. The beer is a terrific introduction beer for wild ales, and a nice fruity beverage overall. I like this beer."

"Overall a very sessionable flanders that I wish I could have every day. Doesn't blow you away but is still a good representation of the style."
""
"O: I love how this tastes but it’s the mouthfeel that dominates. I enjoyed this a ton."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a Belgian goblet, batch 01. This pours a slightly hazy dark brown with a small but bubbly head. The nose is tart, and funky, a little cherry, maybe brett and some vinegar. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good, about Dutchess level quality, you get a nice tart load of fruity malts. Nice."
""
""
""
"I like this but don't love it. I really appreciate the light flavors and fruitiness in this beer, but I want a contrast. It needs some more roastiness or earthiness. Give this a little more complexity and I'd love it."
""
"This would be an excellent beer for someone new to sours. It's not too intense, but anyone can taste the quality. It is balanced, interesting, tasty, and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would love to see this beer in the bottle conditioned form considering the classics of this style contain yeast. Great price of 2.99 a bottle can't go wrong, I will be buying more in the near future."
"Pours the color of molasses with ruby highlights and a meager head that is soon nonexistent. Tartness is noticeable in the aroma, which smells of weak apple cider vinegar. I actually wish it was a bit bolder; as is, it's just ok. The sourness is immediately present on the front end, though it is not terribly strong in and of itself. There simply isn't much else present for it to contest with, outside of the carbonation and some mild yeastiness. Some malt sweetness finally makes its way through in the finish, well after the tartness has subsided. Grapefruit and apple notes lurk somewhere in the transition between the two. All in all, this is a fairly mild and drinkable bruin that doesn't stand out in any particular aspect."
""
"It reminds me mostly of a flanders red; assuming these styles are almost the same."
""
""
""
"Oh Flanders ales, how I just don't get enough of you. This beer is pretty straight forward and direct.I mean that in as good a way as possible. It doesn't really step out and try to be anything beyond a good beer. Straight forward. Fits to style. I like it, but it is pretty pure to the style parameters, which might be a lot for some people to deal with."
""
""
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - This beer really nails the sweetness right. Not overdone or underdeveloped. Light-bodied and easy to drink. The sourness is tamed back, and the intensity of the cherries is perfect. The carbonation is neither apparent nor bothersome."
""
""
"I don't have a lot of experience with lambic/oud bruin style ales, but this is rather intriguing. I doubt this will become a regular style of beer that I partake in, but for something tasty and different, this seems well worth it."
"Overall a pretty solid Flanders oud bruin. Sourness isn't overdone."
""
"Pleasing beer, traditionally meant as thirst quencher. Fresh and drinkable. Decent example of the style."
"Flavor is a little lighter and less sweet than a Duchesse. Jammy, tart fruit with plenty of caramel maltiness. Id like to see a bit more sourness, but overall it is pretty good. I am always down for a good Flanders and while this one is not great, it'll scratch that itch."
""
""
"Poured into a chalice. Pours dark brown with a finger length off-white head that dissipates quickly. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of sour apples, sweet cherries, and yeast. The taste is tart with flavors of apple, cherry, and mildly sweet roasted malts. The flavors are well balanced. The body is light to medium with lots of carbonation. The beer is smooth and the drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer."

"Overall: a very nice oud bruin. On the tart side but relatively balanced with sweetness. I like it."
""
""
""
"Dark reddish brown with scarlet edges and a beige head. Smells tart but also like roasted sugar. The taste is fabulous... all of the sour complexity--cherry, apple, and funk--but with this amazing balance of roasted malts, dark raisins, brown sugar. It's highly drinkable, crisper than most sours I've had (I think this is my first Oud Bruin, though!) and I would seek it out again."
""
""
""
"Dark cherry hued brown body with a light tan head, fine bubled lacing with speckled patterns left on my chalice. Aroma has tart cherries hints of tart sliced apples. Earthy note with lactic yogurt, hints of dark roasted malts. Flavor will satisfy your sour ale side with tart cherries, sliced green apples, hints of yogurt and dark roasted malts. Excellent version of a classic style, I've never heard of the brewer the label is a bit generic but the beer is high quality Bellegems bruin West Flanders Ale. Mouthfeel has a dry finish with fruity balance to make everybody happy, even sturdy flowing carbonation a bit effervescent and bubbly like. Overall high drinkable and enjoyable version of a hard to find style, glad I picked it up definitely worth it at around 4 bucks a bottle."
""
"Low B"
"Overall, a nice but mild Oude Bruin w/ good flavor. This is a perfect starter sour for anyone trying to ease into the sour categories. This beer is no Cuvee Des Jacobins, but I would drink this again in a heartbeat. Another nice job from Bockor!"
""
"(D)- Decent, but a bit of a letdown especially when their Cuvee de Jacobins is top notch."

"This beer pours out a deep red color with a finger of head. The aroma is tart and sour, with cherries and vinegar being the dominant aromas. The taste is pretty strong on the cherries at the start and the finish, with some of the sour and vinegar notes coming in in the midpoint to linger just a little into the finish. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, and the drinkability is good. This is my first Flanders Oud Bruin, and I can't help but feel it's a good, but not outstanding representation of the style. I'm more than willing to find out if my hunch is accurate."

"Fun looking bottle, but can't quite hang out with the upper class of this style."
"O- This is a good beer. I've never had a beer in this style before and it was a great first example."
""
"Pours a slightly murky dark crimson brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of tart and sour cherries, slight vinegar, and slight funk. There is a slight grape aroma that comes out as the beer warms. Taste is of the cherries up front with some slight vinegar flavors, but the taste is only mildly tart and funky. There is a grape-like aftertaste on this one. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice fruity presence in the aroma and flavor."
""
""
"Overall if it's still around at that bar I will have to pick up another a great Flanders ale brewed with cherries. Also a very affordable one at $4.50 a pop. Try it if you find it!"
"O: A nice change of pace for me. What I appreciate most about this is its (delicious) contrast to what I enjoy most often: hoppy and citric American ales. Worth picking up a loose bottle or having a glass."
""
"Nearly clear mahogany with a small fizzy head that dissipates immediately. Almost no lacing. Fruity aroma and taste; berries and cherries; lightly tart and acidic. Subtle vinegar. Just a bit puckering in the finish. Medium light bodied with solid carbonation. Clean and crisp, easy drinking, tasty but not exactly outstanding or particularly memorable for the style. Sourness and funk are very restrained; unintimidating."
"Decent, needs better balance."
""
"Was hoping this would be as impressive as the Jacobins Rouge, but this one left me disappointed."
"This is a reddish brown beer. After a fizzy head, the beer lacks foam, although it's very carbonated. The aroma is great...funky, fresh apple peal, sweet amber malt, apricot and sour cherry. The taste is initially tart, followed by a little sweetness on the front of the tongue. It's fruity, flavorful, and lightly spritzy. Not as sour as expected, it's a relatively balanced beer. Medium to light in body. Very carbonated. Nice."
"Recommended. First time I saw it in PGH (at the recently opened 99 Bottles in Carnegie Twp.), and I picked one up to try it out. Will be back for more!"
""
""
""
"Pour a deep amber to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, it smells of sweet tarts. In the taste, sour dark cherries, the taste grows with time. A small sour bite with a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small sour cherry in the aftertaste. Sour cherries all day, but not overly acidic."

"D - Very nice and drinkable with a sweeter than average character that would make it a good introduction to sour beers. It has the classic sweet and sour profile with little funk and a nicely balanced finish."
""
""
"O: Very good drinkability and a great representative of the style. Great flavors but not overpowering making it quite approachable."
""
""
"O- i 'm obviously not a sour enthusiast I can't describe very well the taste of this. New to sours but I love it. Forgive me"
"O: Very nice. Pretty good drinkability as well. Not really familiar with this style, but I would get it again for sure."
"Excellent Flanders Oud Bruin, very subdued but full of good flavor. A nice entry to the style, and also a nice one for those familiar who prefer less puckering offerings."
"Overall- Good beer. I am still just getting into this style and am liking my journey so far. I would get this again. Seems like this is a good style for summer or winter when you want something different. 4/5"
""
"Pours a deep brown color with a tight one finger slightly off white head which stays around for most of the drink. There is also sticky gobs of lace on the glass. The aroma is of grapes and vinegar. The aroma is well rounded and very inviting. The taste starts with a vinager tartness and gives way to a grape and slight tart cherry taste. The backend has a malt taste. The mouthfeel is carbonated and acidic. Overall a very solid beer, nice sour taste and aroma."
""
""

"M-nice mouthfeel, light feeling and great carbonation."
"Overall, this is damn good. Again, nothing out of the ordinary for the style, but really hits the sweet spot with the tartness. Definitely have it again."
""

""
"D - Probably on the lighter side of sour for the style but I enjoy it."
"An excellent accompaniment to pancakes."
""
""
"This poured out as a deep brownish red color with a fluffy tan colored head on top. The head settles and leaves a a light amount of scattered lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is tart and wooden smelling, there is also some cherry I'm picking up also. The taste is actually much better than I expected. It's a much more muted sour that some of the Flanders Reds out there. The mouthfeel was lightly carbonated and pretty smooth. Overall it was a pretty tasty brew even though I'm not a big fan of the style."
""
""
"The sour notes are right there when it first hits the pallate and stays throughout. I can taste raisins and some subtle dark fruit that I can't quite pull. Good if you like sours, but I do not so just so so for me."
"I was surprised with this beer, it was my first of a style I didn't suppose I'd like, but it was good!"
"Aroma is dark fruits, ripe plums, figs, pears, anything dark is a winner here. Really just nicely done. Sweet with raisins and touches of spice coming into the fold, beyond well put together. Each sip is like thanksgiving dinner with the flavors. A tremendous range here with huge swings from sugary dark fruits to light spice and hints of tart cherries"
"O: B+. I wish there was more funk and tart, but solid brew."
"A real quality flemish sour. Very good aromatics with even better flavors. Excellent feel and a real good beer overall"
"Notes: Very drinkable and refreshing. I wish there were more availability of this excellent style."
"O: At $3.50 a bottle, this may just be my goto fruited ""sour."" While it's not quite Marron Acidifie or Oerbier, the price to performance ratio is staggering."
"A very drinkable and sessionable lighter sour style, I would suggest this as a great beer vs. wine pairing as it can easilly outdo most red wines."
"O: This beer is quite easy to drink for the style because the sourness isn’t that strong."
"Overall I really liked this beer. I will be looking to buy more ASAP!"
"Served in a tulip, this beer had a brownish-red color with a thin head. Enjoyable sour aroma; always the first hint that I'll enjoy this style of brew. Taste was consistent with the nose; a pleasant, tart sensation without being overwhelmingly sour, a touch of fruitiness, and really no sense of bitterness. You have to enjoy the sour flavor to enjoy this mouthfeel, which thankfully I do. Not a style I pick up too often, but when I do I enjoy it and this is a good example."
"One finger light tan head, quick dissipation with minimal retention, mahogany copper clear body, fairly dark, no visible carbonation. A bit of barnyard funk in the nose balanced with dark stonefruit esters, plums, a bit of floral hops and a healthy dose of caramel malt sweetness. Taste mirrors nose, but the blending leads me to believe this is far more lager than lambic,, not exactly what I was looking for but certainly a good idea from a business perspective. Mild tartness and even milder sourness due to caramel malt. Mouthfeel is medium, low effervescence, a bit of stickiness. This take on West Flanders beers is different from what I'm used to, so I will try others within this style, but not sure this made a big enough impression where I'd choose this again."
"Overall, its really good, much better than a B+"
"O- This beer is a nice classic flanders red with some soft depth of other flavors, like a nice blended brown malt and a good amount of tartness."
"Whether you like Oud Bruins, or are just interested, this is an ideal introduction to the style. I recommend."
"11.2 ounce bottle, Batch Code of 01 stamped on the back label. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a clear ruby red/brown color with about an inch and a half light tan head. Lacing and head retention are both pretty good. Aroma is vinegar, cherries, sweet grapes, plums and some oak. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some caramel malt, brown sugar and more dark fruit. Great balance between the sweet and tart flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with moderate/high carbonation. It's smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good brew, at $3.99 a bottle I'd definitely buy this again."
"overall: good"
"Dark copper brown, ruby glint when held to the light. Aroma is minerally like well water, some light grape or cherry skins. Tangy tart grapes in the taste, some light cherry tartness. A little maltiness underneath, not much sweetness at all. Seems like a return to a more traditional recipe possibly. Renamed after the Bockor brewery founder."
"From the 11.2 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on May 2, 2011. The pour is dark ruby red to brown with little to no head. The aroma exhibits characteristics of champagne, vinegar, and overripe fruit. The body is thin to medium as the style should be. The taste was full of tart fruit akin to cherry or melon. A slight malt character lingers."
"Might be my favorite of the style."
"Very decent, but not the best of the style. I'm glad I tried it and would have it again."
"O: Pretty quintessential. If anything, it's a very drinkable, inoffensive bruin. Some in this style clock in at very funky or sour, but this is a pretty great balance. Sure it's tangy, but not unpleasantly so. Very well executed."
"All in all, this is a great oud bruin. The aroma is fantastic and the flavor is quite good, although not quite as complex as the aroma and it finishes a bit sweet. The mouthfeel throws me a little because it's a bit thin, but on the whole, it's a tasty and quite drinkable bruin."
"Kris"
"Pours a very deep red with a nice big well retained head. The aroma is very interesting, plenty of wet grain and a bit of brown sugar. There is certainly some hay in the aroma as well. The flavor is similarly earthy however this is no where near as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe, nor was it as sweet as the Monk's Cafe I just drank before it. This beer isn't particularly ""bracingly"" sour but it is certainly tart & the tartness is most defiantly the dominant character of the beer. There is a fair amount of sour cherry in there as well, but the beer is certainly malty in a sort of dusty earthy and cocoa kind of way. Overall this is an enjoyable beer."
"Bottle received in a trade with Brewerdan, thanks! Nice brown color and at first a big head, then a wispy ring of bubbles around the rim of the glass. The smell is a decent sweet sour almost glue, vinegar, oud bruin for sure. The taste starts out matching the smell but the back end has a strange graininess to it that I can't get past."
"Taste is very nice, a very balanced mixture of flavours, not too sour, not too malty - very mild and highly drinkable. this would be a good sour for those who don't like sours."
"Notes - I was a huge fan of this beer and I had ordered it by chamce, with no research prior. I was satisfied and I would order this again and again."
"D- decent beginner sour. As I said one dimensional and uninteresting. Tastes artificial the whole way. More of a red then a bruin really."
"Final word? It tastes good."
"First try with this style, and surprisingly drinkable. Seems to juggle crisp, dry and tart for a cumulative effect rather than just being straight up sour. Impressive."
"drinks very well. a nice introduction. not over-the-top sour, but there is definitely some pleasing puckering going on."
"Not bad, but nothing exceptional"
"Cheers..."
"pours a dark red brown mostly clear color with a smallish head some lacing and a beige collar..smell is funky ,sour,currant fruits..a dash of vinegar..taste is great is funky barnyard,,with sour fruit with just the right amount of vinegar..its tart with a kiss of sweetness...mouth fell is medium with tartness and sour notes,,nothing overpowers.. a great oud bruin at a super price on the 11.2 oz bottle ..will go back to my bottle shop to buy a couple more"
"D: A gem at $4 a bottle. Simply delicious, like the session beer version of an Oud Bruin, a great everyday drink, a must have from Belgium. Too easy to drink, refereshing to a T, simply an exceptionally well made beer. A classic acidic country ale."
"Bottle. Batch Code 01, no other date that I could find on the bottle. Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a clear dark reddish brown rust color with an offwhite head that settles to form a nice coaster, nice lace left as it settled. Aroma is a mix of grape, cherry, some metallic, and some swet malt aromas. Some sour/tart notes in the nose as well. Light mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Sweet fruit like start with hints of grape and cherry similiar to the nose. Underlying caramel flavor. Some sourness but nothing mouthpuckering. This to me ends semi flat and dry with no real flavors sticking out too much. Easy drinking."
"Glad to finally try it at last, after seeing it in my old, dusty Michael Jackson tomes of yore!"
"O: highly drinkable, well balanced (not too tart or sweet) with the dark fruity flavors that I love. The most satisfying sour ale I've had so far."
"Had a chalice at the Blue Nile. Thanks to Al for bringing in the sours. I'd say this is on the more drinkable end o the spectrum for the style. Of course, it also lacks some of the deeper complexity of the style you might find in Goudenband, but is still a step ahead of Petrus Oud Bruin. There's a sweet, lightly fruity caramel and light cocoa malt flavor with tart candy bite at the finish. I was eating a plate of spicy beef sambussas and this beer went surprisingly well with the fat and spice."
"The feel of this beer is pretty smooth. I hardly noticed it go down but it did have a nice aftertaste that made sure I remembered the experience."
"T: Very sweet, slightly tangy. Slight geuze-like funk. Berries and raspberries. Fleeting sugary cherry note. Finishes slightly sour with cranberry notes. A bit sweet in the finish as well."
"D-Solid. At only $4.99, this is worth drinking again."
"The palate opens with a pleasant tartness that's a blend of lactic and acetic in nature. The tartness is moderately fruity as well with some dark cherries. Very clean, the complexity of the nose follows the opening flavors, with a blend of cola, oak-derived vanilla and dark brown sugar. Drying on the finish with some tannins, lactic sourness and a little balsalmic vinegar, this beer also has characteristics of oxidized malt, with a little must. The cocoa I picked out on the nose isn't really noticeable. Not unlike some of the Flemish Oude Bruins I've had, this has a mildly meaty, salty, gamey character as well (I distinctly remember the Ichtegems Bruin having this characteristic), but it's very enjoyable unlike in some other cases. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this beer has an enjoyable finish. A little dusty, I really like this. Still, though, Goudenband (and the regular Liefmans Oud Bruin) are superior for the style."
"25 cl bottle BBE 8/10. Pours clear, dark red-brown with a small pale beige head. A bit of lacing. Lactic sourness on the nose with some sour cherry. Woody. Acidity in the taste as well, but it's cut by a lot of sugary sweetness. A bit of dark roasty malt. Sweet finish. Not super complex. Medium body with high carbonation. Too sweet to be a decent sour."
"M&D: not extremely refreshing as the carbonation is slightly artificial and yet also flat-ish (coz it's ""expired"" by 6 months??). I can't help thinking if the expiry issue really has something to do with the underperformance of this bottle, but, if not, I would have to say this thin-ish beer is at best a mediocre example of the classic style. I might have to try the tap version to change my mind, or find a bottle within the BB date."
"D- Very drinkable I just love this beer and I hope I can find it again out side of Belgium."
"D: Nice Flanders Bruin with decent complexity, smoothness and easy light ABV. Not my normal style but one that could grow on you. For not its a one and out drink that I work to appreciate as I expand my palate."
"Bellegems Bruin is my second Flanders oud bruin and I like it just fine. I see some room for improvement though. Given the basic elements of the style, I'm certain there's a version out there that will blow me away, I just need to find it. This wasn't it, but I still could have used a bigger bottle."
"Teasing aromas of sweetly caramelish malt and a sour cherry-like fruitiness greet you in the nose of this beautiful oud bruin. As it crosses your lips and tongue you find it's quite smooth and lightly creamy with an exceptionally fine-bubbled natural carbonation and medium body. The flavor, however, is distracting with its beautiful juxtaposition of sour apple/mild citrus-like tartness and lightly sweet, caramelish, and toasty malt. Raisins and brown sugar appear along the way; and a thin spritz of lemon juice hits you at the finish, drying it nicely! It lingers in the mouth though, with a film of dry maltiness that makes you want to take another sip! Quite nice. And although it's not complex, the combination of the sourness and sweetness is interesting enough to keep you coming back for more! This is a superb rendition of the style that doesn't rely on added sweetness to overcome its sourness; and isn't too sour over all - just perfectly balanced!"
"Rodenbach aroma, winey, fruity. thin body, long cherry finish. Dark brown/mahogony color, thin head throughout, weak taste. Beer was slightly oxidized. My friend got this in 03' from Michael Jackson Belgium beer club and the best before date was 12/21/02."
"I thought I had finished all of my bottles of this beer off a year ago. I seem to remember it tasting better than this. Foamy head that died quickly. Kind of a sour smell. Kind of tastes like a burgundy wine. Maybe this one has sat too long.The date on the bottle is 12/20/02 and today is 8/15/04. So its quite possible that this beer has not improved with age. I will have to pick up another bottle sometime and edit htis review if my impressions change."
"I love the way a good Flemish Ale looks. This is ruby brown in color, though it does not have much head. There is no hop aroma to speak. The aroma is not much, but you can tell that it is sweet and tart. It tastes fruity and winey and is acidic and sour with a slight bitter finish. There is plenty of carbonation I guess I just poured it bad."
"I will have to say that I wasn't very impressed with this beer. It poured nice and dark brown but had almost know head at all. Very little carbonation at all. It has a nice aroma that is malty and smells of plums. But the taste was extremely sweet. It had a big plum taste with very little bitterness at all. The big turn off was the residual sweetness which overpowered everything else. Overall I think that it may have not have finished fermenting, but otherwise was interesting."
"This brown has an absolutely exceptional aroma. Its complex fruity sourness is interesting and refreshing, and evolves nicely as it warms. It's refreshing, fruity, and complexly delicious, and I'll definitely be picking up more bottles of this."
"Hazy deep garnet in hue. Lanky, yet persistent tan head yields sparse lace. Candied green apple upfront in aroma is complemented by slightly sour, oaky balsamic notes. Tartness dissapates rapidly as the brew breathes, and is replaced by a static, sweet raisin and caramel presence. Brusque snap of toffee like, dark candi sugar sweetness initially in flavor is quickly offset by a melange of stately acetic tartness, earthy tones of hay, and mellow yeast must. Fruitiness is of an underripe, slightly astringent plum like nature. Appropriately lightly bodied and thus conducive to quaffability, with a agreeable dextrinous kiss in mouthfeel. Notes of grape skin emerge late, thoroughly drying the palate, yet a smidgen of molasses like residual sweetness remains. Finishes softly bready, with a sourdough like lactic mirk. Quite an enjoyable, whimsical brew. Superbly refreshing and certainly quite a tease in its eight ounce portion. This is what Liefman's Oud Bruin failed to be. ""Best before 12/20/2002"""
"Drinkability  This is great to drink on an empty stomach. The smallish bottle reflects the sipping nature of this brew. A nice example."

"Notes: A good beer, if you like the style. The taster needs to have an awareness of the sourness of this style, or else weird faces will appear. It's hard to believe how refreshing something sour can actually be. Very appropriate for it's style."
"Dark brown in color with a bit of sediment and a thin, light tan head. The aroma is appropriately sour, with some sugary malty notes undrelying and a bit of a nutty scent. The taste is tart but not overwhelmingly so. The tartness starts of gently, gives way to a malty sweetness, reasserts itself in a finish reminiscent of raisins and green apples and finally yields to a mildly sweet aftertaste. Medium-bodied, much lighter than it looks, with a gently dry finish. Very drinkable -- a good introduction to the world of sour beers."
"There are not too many accomplished Flemish Brown Ales knocking around these days. And this offering, whilst not the best, is a good example worth seeking out."
"This beer pours a clear dark red/brown with a smallish off white head. It has a slightly malty somewhat citrusy smell that gives the perception of sweet and sour. The taste was of a sweet flowery front, diminishing sour mid with a dry slightly yogurty end and a slightly thin mouthfeel. Overall it was a very nice sweet and sour type beer which I really wish I could drink on a more regular basis."
"(source: Great Beers of Belgium)"
"The beer pours a dark garnet color with a pertinent head and the lace formed is a fine sheet to coat the glass. The aroma of fresh ripe plums, malt and somewhat musty, light nut sweetness also present a pleasure to sniff. Start is sweet and malt laden, the top is a bit thin, and the finish nicely carbonated and the hops apropos for the style. The aftertaste dry and somewhat sour, good drinkable beer and well worth the sample."
"Notes: A happy brew in my mouth, back and forth complexities of tartness and carob or dark malt. Pleasing to the palate and refreshed my mind."
