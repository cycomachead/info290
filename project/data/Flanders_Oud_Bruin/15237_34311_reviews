"The beer is dark mahogany and pretty clear with a broke tan head. Aromas of oak, cherry, funk, vanilla, prune. The flavor is sweet and sour cherry, vinegar, oak, dark fruit finishing with a lactic punch. Acetic and sharp, yet not harsh, per se. Certainly puckering. Complex and intriguing. A unique beer for sure. I'd happily try this again."

"A very interesting and intriguing beer from De Struise. Not sure how much or how often I could drink this, but I was very glad to be able to finally try this well regarded beer at long last."
""
""
"Rating is for the 2007 Vintage."
"O - Would have liked to have seen more carbonation in this, but does resemble a good example of the style."
""
""
""
"O: Seems over the hill based on the oxidation and flatness. Initially thought it might be infected, but it isn't. I'd suggest these be consumed rather than cellared any longer."
""
""
"O-As a fan of De Struise and of sours, I was excited to try this beer and it did not let me down. The flavors are typically Belgian in their subtlety but part of that subtlety might have been the age of this bottle. Regardless, this beer was a great example of the style and it proves that huge fruit or acidity aren't always necessary to make a good sour beer."

"O - Overall this is tasty. Held up well to age. Very glad I got to try this vintage!"
"Overall. A nice tasting Oud Bruin but some more carbonation would be nice ...maybe a bit past it's prime."
""
""
""
"Overall pretty nice. A nicely aged oud bruin, great flavors, although the lack of carbonation and slight oxidation take away a bit. Still a decent beer but not among the greats."
"Overall - Reminds me of a BFM beer. Incredibly complex with blatant flaws. Not something I could drink regularly, but this was a nice treat this afternoon."
"Wow - what a beer. The complexity and range of flavours are incredible, even though I find it quite a challenging brew. The sour, vinegar character is nicely balanced by sweetness and fruity notes. The glaring flaw is the lack of carbonation, which detracts from the mouthfeel but also affects the flavour. I'm sure that the experience on the palate would be different with greater CO2 presence. Nonetheless, this is an impressive effort from de Struise and one that I'm happy to have tried. Probably not everyone's cup of tea, but well worth sampling if you have the opportunity."
"Overall, while lacking the mouthfeel and head retention that would bump this one up a few notches, really very satisfying."
""
""
"D - Plenty of punch and interest here, although I think I would prefer it with some years on it to smooth the currently aggressive edges."
""
""
""
"A vinegar and wine grape bomb, awesome non-lambic sour IMO. I really don't know anything about the background of this beer but I certainly enjoyed whatever it is."
"OVERALL: Like I said above, I'm not sure if I love this or hate it. It's probably somewhere in between. It's flavorful, interesting, and complex enough to make it enjoayable, but I'm not sure if this is really my style. In any case, the carbonation needs to be figured out, as this is a little too flat even for this style. Either way, this is a quality beer by a quality brewer, so if you're a fan of the style, this will probably be your thing."
""
"2.5 D: This is wholely unrefined. I'm okay with the sourness and the balsalmic flavors. Hell, sometimes I'll pour a quarter ounce of balsalmic vinegar into a snifter just to sip on. But, the acetone is really offputting. I guess a few too many bug species got in there. This would be a lot better if a few things were different, but such it is as it is. Super complex and powerful, but just not that good."
""
""
"The lack of carbonation holds this back from being significantly better."

"Overall: Smells fantastic but the rest doesn't measure up. Approach with caution."
""
"o - overall, this is a super in your face flanders. kind of weird, but definitely different. puckeringly sour and drinkable in a weird way (in the way you have to look at a car accident when passing...something weird about it that keeps bringing you back...not that the beer is an accident, just interesting). i wonder what time has done to this fresh. i find 2008 to be a sweet spot on barrel aged brews and big stouts right now, but flanders?"
"O: A very good Flanders oud Bruin, deep, intriguing. Would be curious to see how it ages."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer even though it smells very unique. With a bit of age, I think it will balance out nicely and drink amazingly well. Time to toss it deep in the cellar and forget about it!"
"A good but not great flemish red."
""
"Overall, pretty good but not a standout for me. Happy to have had it."
""
""
""
"Poured burgundy with some light brown brown highlights. Bubbles serve as head, and once they disappear, nothing remains - no head or retention. Legs are pretty decent though. Nose has some black cherry, balsamic vinegar, currant, light vinous notes and a sense of sourness. There is a substantial sweet component to this as well. Taste has dark cherries and berries, light acetic tartness produced by similar balsamic notes and a gentle earthy maltiness. Light pucker in the finish, but again the sweet and sticky components of this beer make themselves well known. No alcohol on the palate and low carbonation, somewhere between still and gentle 'prickliness.' A nice semi-tart yet sweet Flemish Red, glad to have seen and had this."
""

""
"(quick edit: this beer is 8% ABV. Now bumping the mouthfeel up to a 4 from 3.5. no heat whatsoever on this bad boy.)"
"o - Overall I thought this was a very good beer. It's not super sour but a very nice mix of sour fruit/vinegar with sweet fruits. Interested to see what my fresh bottle tastes like."
""
"O - This is not my beer, but I am glad that I have tried it once.It is to sour and fruity to my liking. Don't get my wrong I still find it pretty good."
""
"Drinkability- Overall this is pretty decent. I’d like a touch more carbonation but the beer smells awesome and tastes great. Definitely more important than a few extra bubbles. One of the better Flanders Oud Bruin I’ve had (which admittedly isn’t a ton). Thanks much Jeff!"
""
""
""
"O: this is certainly a new take on a Flanders Red, however, the flavors never quite balance each other out"
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Thin, flat, and tepid on the tongue. Lingering acidic vinegar ruined my palate for at least an hour after this. Apparently there's some variation between vintages, but this one was awful. Avoid."
""
""
""
""
"Additional Note: many of my friends have mentioned that this vintage tates like Cool Whip. I'm almost mad that there's nothing reminding me of fake whipped cream..."
""
"O: As soon as I smelt this beer, the only thing I could think of is mat vinegar and fish and chips. But, then again, I admittedly prefer tartar sauce on my fish and ketchup on my chips. And I can't think of a time when I'd ever drink a glass of malt vinegar. While some people might find this beer drinkable, I didn't. A few ounces was all I could handle."
"I've heard so many interesting things about this beer that I had no problem when it was chosen to be cracked first tonight. It pours a murky ruby-brown with no real head of any kind to speak of. The nose comprises tomato, light tart black cherry, light raspberry vinaigrette, caramel, and teriyaki sauce. I'm actually a little surprised that I like what I'm smelling, given what I just wrote. The taste holds notes of soy sauce (including a pinch of salt), light cocoa, cherry tomatoes, red grapes, and red apple skin. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a slick, fluid feel. Overall, an interesting beer, indeed, one I'm not entirely sure if I liked or disliked..."

"D - This didn't seem to age well - perhaps I should have gotten to it a bit sooner. I'll have to revisit the new batch, although I didn't care for it either if I recall correctly. The most enjoyable time I had this beer was when I had it straight for the barrels."

"11.2oz. bottle procured from the Struise webshop. Vintage 2008 (EM No. 7) served at 52 degrees in a tulip. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a bubbly, loose, tan-colored froth around the shoulders which continues to dissipate into an oily skim and a thin, tight bubbly band. I love the nose on this beer - vinous, oaky, vanilla notes, dark fruits (plum, figs, prunes) and a suggestion of grape bubblegum. Taste is a bit more muddled. Vinous quality still presents itself, as well as some citric acid; however, there's also a bit of chocolate as well as more grape notes, a slight earthiness and prunes. Tannins are present, but the acidity pretty much buries the vanilla and oak expressed in the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency with a mild carbonation which is almost still. Acidity lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks and lingers along the glands at the back of the throat between quaffs. Overall - I really enjoyed this complexity of this beer and plan on cellaring a couple bottles to see how it changes over time. A slightly tart and vinegary FOB without being overly sour. I wish there were more efforts at this style readily available."
"And always with this mixture of styles between Brussels Champagne and Flemish Burgundy that makes the complex beer, tasty and also easy to drink."
"Overall: So sour and vinegary. Very interesting and I'm so glad I got to try it. I don't know that I would have another."
"I would however highly recommend this beer to anyone who is a fan of the style and I will be trying to get more."
"The carbonation is low here. Bordering on flat and the body is some what light. Overall, simply terrible. De Struise should be ashamed."
"Truly terrible."
"Drink- This was a very good beer. Again, this is polarizing and it was quite different from the Oude Tart or Marron Acidife I have had for this style."
"Overall: This was different, smooth, and enjoyable."
"O: This one was a huge let down for me. I was expecting something more from this brewer. Glad I never plunked down the coin to have some shipped to me."
"O: Quite an interesting beer, but some carbonation would help and just a touch more sour would really bring this one into line. It is fairly enjoyable, but just seems a bit lacking. Will revisit again."
"Thanks to the boys of Oostvleteren!"
"D - Creative and wild to say the least, I give this an A+ for style and presentation although it would be tough to drink a lot of this."
"Age has really done wonders for this beer. Really smooth with flavors that are well balanced but still distinct and prominent at the same time. A solid representation of the style."
"Thanks to Chris - Knifestyles - for this one. Appears as you would expect; deep chocolate brown with a fast fading head and a light tan ring around the glass. Lots of prune, fig, and raisin aroma. A deep vinous nose laced with earthiness and brown sugar + molasses. Also a good amount of vinegar here. There is a clear sharp lactic sourness coupled with grape skins. Very deep and complex flavor. Opens tart with lactic sourness. Sun dried fruits, prune, fig and grape. Distinct Struise yeast quality mid-palate. Sharp bitting sour note on the finish. A real balance of sweet and tart here. However there is some interesting hot-ness on the back end. Great palate feel, not thin, well balanced and slightly prickly. True to form this beer is a real gem."
"Thanks to phishisphunk for the opportunity!"
"Not a huge fan of flanders style but pretty enjoyable. The low carb (really non-existant) makes this very wine like so someone who enjoys both wine and beer would be a fan. Sourness is definitely mellow while the woodiness of it really elevated. Maybe a little too sweet, but not like a sucking on a penny like some beers of this style."
"Pours a dark brown color with some reddish-mahogany highlights. A few light tan bubbles to start and then it falls completely flat, which is then echoed in the flavor and feel. The nose brings a bit of light soy sauce and mild sweetness, which, oddly enough, reminds me a bit of 2009 Dark Lord. Slight cherry cherry along with lactic acid and a bit of vinegar. The flavor goes straight from the nose bringing through cherry, soy sauce, vinegar, and some very mild sweetness. Light body with very low carbonation and a pretty heavy acetic acid presence. Definitely not for everyone, but I quite enjoyed this."
"Overall I thought the cherry flavors were a bit too heavy for this to be anything more than a good beer. Still, interesting and worth a shot."
"Wow."
"Overall: What a fantastic taste, pity the carbonation is too low."
"O - This was horrible and hard to drink. Bad bottles? Bad batch? Whatever it is, I'm going to use a taster to screen all bottles of this for me from now on, as I have no desire to be subjected to this again."
"Not perfect, but the complex flavor makes this a keeper for me. It's surprisingly drinkable, too."
"O: I really don't like Struise, and this is another great example why. Unremarkable, boring... bleh."
"Overall, this is not the beer for me. I would have loved a mouth puckering taste that was reminiscent in the aroma, but all I got was metal. It reminded me of when I was a kid and had a mouth full of pennies. Only this time, I didn't get any money after the experience."
"Big thanks to AuroraCrisis for this one. Dark brown color, almost looks burgundy. Smell is complex oud bruin, a little sourness, spices. The flavor is very good but not your typical oud bruin, this seems more spicy and nuanced and has a sourness on the finish that really pulls at your cheeks like a lemon does. This is a nice beer but a little bit pricey and not easy to get a hold of."
"O: a very good beer, that i would gladly drink again."
"I like this beer - it is unique and has a depth and complexity most beers lack, should be interesting to age."
"Earthmonk is an extremely well crafted Oud Bruin. I normally find the style to be a bit sweet and off-putting but this feels like a balanced Oud Bruin with some of the great tartness of a mild Flanders Red."
"(D)- This is a great flanders, maybe even a bit unique than most. Very mild in carbonation, but the sour profile and oak really carries this beer through to the end. I look forward to seeing how this ages."
"Overall an interesting beer. Ultimately though I come up disappointed. For a beer in one of my favorite styles this one is a bit too vinegary and not enough funk or cherry flavor. That said this beer is still enjoyable."
"Edit: just opened another bottle of this, and it is vastly improved compared to my last review. Carbonation is better, and a bit more tartness seems to have developed. Very interesting yeast character as well. Glad to have a few bottles left."
"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one during one of our weekly tastings! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a reddish brown with a very minimal light tan head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pure acetic acid, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, balsamic vinegar, fruit, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with very low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. For some odd reason, I know I shouldn't, but I really liked this one. I'm a chemist for a living and work with pure acetic acid sometimes and I just LOVE the smell of it. This brew reminds me of said smell. During the tasting I even joked about pouring this over a salad to make the best salad ever... But anyways, if you do not like vinegar flavors in your brew, avoid this one AT ALL COSTS! If you do, get this on your palate ASAP! This is what I would define as a love or hate beer, I loved it!"
"Woah, this stuff is weird. I'm not sure that this one is for me. But I would wager that this is closer to a real Oud Bruin than some of the miscategorized brown American wilds. The beer is heavy on the palate, with its full body and low carbonation. It also has some very unusual flavors and aromas."
"Earthmonk is unlike any oud bruin I've ever had before. A very unique flavor that was unfortunately hurt by the lack of bubbles."
"SkÅL!"
"O - I'm not all that happy about this one. I was really looking forward to it, but I really had to struggle to get through the (small, expensive) bottle. The flavors just aren't good enough to overcome the lack of carbonation."
"The nose is utterly complex with interplay of sour, sweet, fruity and sherry aromas. The sourness takes after balsamic vinegar which is quite intense denoting an aged example, as do the obvious sherry-notes. The malt is quite rich with caramel and slight chocolaty character while fruity esters are reminiscent of raisins, plum and black cherries. Some brown sugar is noticeable as is the mild alcohol in the background. The malts, balsamic vinegar and black cherry produce rich tart-sweet flavor with intensity of a soy sauce. A very faint mushroom-like bitterness indicates that Brettanomyces has been used to add sourness to this one. The beer is said to be oak-aged and that's welcomed as it gives balsamic character to the vinegar, but unexpected because maturation on oak is typical to Flanders Red, not Bruin. Body is medium-full and smooth due to nearly absent carbonation and besides the poor appearance flat mouthfeel is the major flaw of otherwise excellent beer."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a very light level of carbonation. The alcohol is very well integrated in this brew. This is a very complex offering that I have a hard time fully wrapping myself around but it is uniquely enjoyable and it really warmed up to me and I started to dig it more as the glass emptied. It is balanced very well with a mix of flavors that seemingly evolve into something different with every sip. The biggest disappointment here is the complete lack of carbonation that would really drive this one home as a standout winning brew. While this isn't the best offering I have had from Struise, it most certainly is among the most complex and interesting. I intend to get some more of this and see what some age does."
"Body is medium with a very slight carbonation. Being that Flanders Oud Bruin's are typically similar to this, I have to think that this is done right and give more points to De Struisse. I have no idea where the 8% is hidden, but this comes together like a masterpiece and I can really enjoy sipping on it."
"Overall: I heard this beer was one of a kind, and it certainly lived up to that billing. It is not for everybody, as is indicative from the reviews all over the place. But, it is well worth seeking out, as you won't know if you like it until you try it. It's drinking good now (fresh), but the inherent complexity makes me glad I have a few to lay down to see how this tasty beer evolves over time."
"O- Meh. Will prob. pass along my other bottles. Too much going on- and it doesn't really come together."
"Overall, a very interesting take on the style. Lots of rustic, true to form flavors in there that I can honestly say I have never experienced in an oud bruin. But it seems to be missing a little bit of approachability due to the earthyness and complex character of the beverage. A must try for any fan of the style, but be forewarned that this beast is not tame."
"O- Best Flemish Red I've ever tried. Period. Duchesse on crack..."
"I love this beer, it's a shame I only bought 6. Will have to buy some more when more is released."
"I've tried several Struise beers now and I believe this is my new favorite. Looking forward to letting some of my bottles age for awhile to see how this evolves."
"This beer has an earthy taste, light sour and also sweetness. Cherrie well hidden but also very in front some times. Let the beer swirl into the glass and you will have a great time!"
"Overall I really dig this. It's a sour but not overwhelming. I'm a huge fan of De Struise and this one stands out as a favorite of mine. I first had this several years ago and have been waiting patiently for it's next release."
"O: I'm between and betwixt on this one. Nothing really stands out on it. I'm lead to believe that A. this beer is past its prime secondary to the oxidized flavors and aromas, or B. I'm consuming a bad batch. The 8% ABV is evidently noticeable on the finish and lends a warming feeling long after. I would really like to try a fresh batch as I'm lead to an inclination that at some point in the lifespan of this beer is a world class Flanders Oud Bruin. Will certainly seek out again."
"Overall: When I had the beer, it was still very young. So nice and soft, with all flavors coming out very balanced. Probably overtime the sourness will get a bit more pronounced, but for me, this beer is close to perfect now!"
"Overall, this brew boggled my mind, as I had never tasted an Oude Bruin quite like this one. Throughout the sampling I kept wanting more and more of this unique brew, needless to say I will be looking to acquire more bottles. In the end, another winner from Struise."
"Wish I could get more of this, simply wonderful! I am wondering, due to the mixed reviews, if there were some bad bottles or if a certain year was better than another. 2008 was exceptional on tap!"
"D - Drinkability is not bad. Lack of carbonation does hurt this brew but it is still drinkable nonetheless. It's big. It's bold. Frankly, there is just quite a bit to take in. As it warms and after a few sips, it really mellows out. Not sure I could take more than one though. Maybe on another day but definitely not in the same session. I heard good things and had high hopes for this one but unfortunately it fell short."
"The beer pours a hazy brown with an espresso swirl head. The aroma is some vinegar and farmyard-ish (namely horse blanket) aroma with just a mild roastiness in there as well. The flavor is sour and mildly sweet with lots of sour cherry and plenty of lactic acidity. All this pairs oddly well with a malty and chocolaty flavor that lurks in the background. Pretty damn nice."
"The aging is mellowing it out and rounding it so that it has much the same character as a (not-hoppy) aged barleywine, or perhaps a Thomas Hardy, with the added dimension of a sour backbone and perhaps a little less body. Very, very good, but not world class in my opinion and relative to other Flemmish sours not really to style."
"Awesome beer !!"
"Another great De Struise, worth trying!"
"Medium bodied and slightly puckering with a great balance of sweet dark fruit notes, earthy oak and tart funk. Vinous with hints of grape, dark cherry and plum as well as hints of oak and vanilla. Not too sour/puckering but slightly funky with a sweet yet dry finish. Not as extreme or complex as other Belgians of the style but very flavorful, nicely balanced and extremely quaffable."
"I've learned since that a run of these bottles were apparently pretty bad. That's the batch I got, not sure where this went wrong, but it was way off."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice overall."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I like the dark fruit aspect of the beer and the sourness is well balanced. That being said, this beer doesn't quite have enough going on for me to seek it out again, but if I could buy it off the shelf I would."
"Overall, a pretty solid beer. I like how tart it is, but yet it still provides oak and malt flavors. Pretty drinkable. The cherries were excellent. I'd easily have more of this one."
"Bottle. Opens with the tiniest mouse fart of a ""pfftt"" then pours a really dark brown color with very minimal head which I expected after the description. The aroma is actually very nondescript with notes of fruit, sourness, oak, and some mild acetone. The taste is much better than the nose with a very robust flavor profile. Some mineral type earth notes in the taste as well. Some acetone present as is some sour/tart cherries. Not as fruitful or sweet as other sours/wilds that I have had. I think I get a touch of leather as well. Overall, I really like this beer for its authenticity and complexity. Far from being the best in this class but a good beer nonetheless. I wish the nose had a more pronounced smell and there was a little carbonation."
"Drinkability is amazing, because somehow this sour beer is smooth, you aren't left mouth puckering."
"Pours black, opaque, with frothy, light brown foam that persists a while. The smell is nicely sour and tart with notes of cherries, plums, wood, and acetic acid. Lightly sweet up front, though not overly so, but fades to a tart finish. Flavors of cherry and wood with a kiss of spice. Lightly tart flavors linger briefly. Smooth with medium body and low carbonation feel. Almost creamy up front with a tart finish. A very nice beer."
"This is a solid Flanders which straddles the line between wine and beer. Lots of oak, tart fruit and underlying sugar, coming together in a nice little package."
"For some reason, it escaped my notice until this moment, but De Struise Brouwers brews damn good beer. Black Albert, Struise Tsjeeses and Pannepot Old Fisherman's Ale (in all its various guises) are great examples of their respective styles. Looks like we can add Earthmonk to the list."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a fairly complex oud bruin, but the $20 price tag is just silly."
"D - Phenomenal, except for the price tag and availability... Still, this is probably worth the $2-3 per ounce."
"From the bottle...2008 tasting of many Struise in Loveland, CO...minimal head, rich brown. Big sour, funky bruin, slightly vinegar aroma. Flavor is a mix of sweet and sour...with rich malts, sour funk, astringent notes, crazy! Unique and tasty and weird and fun...ayieee!!"
"D: Needless to say I was very disappointed by this beer. I was hoping that it would be as enjoyable as most of the other Struise beers are, but this one is just not good."
"Tough to finish even half a bottle. Completely flat. For a beer with this low of an ABV and a lighter, more moderate mouthfeel, unforgivable."
"A very nice flanders oud bruin. Probably the best one i've tried to date."
"Beer is biting sour, strong almost wine like flavors with the fruits. Finishes dry, which was a surprise. There are late acetic / vinegar acidicity that adds to the palate connectivity. Even though there was no visible carbonation in the glass, on the palate there is plenty of carbonation that helps to activate the sourness of the late flavors. The sweetness is still there as well. Beer is well balanced between these two flavors. Drinkability is not as high as I would have hoped but it was also getting quite late. I would drink it again and seek it out again. A great great beer."
"drinkability is great. not overly acidic or vinegary, with an interesting balanced sour edge to it. this is a damn tasty flanders brown."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, quite slick, low carbonation. This is pretty solid, but the crazy sour fruit character in the taste is a little too much. Still I dig this, thanks Dan!"
"T: Flavor starts with port wine and progresses to a rick sourness and very high acidity. A unique brew, something to be sought after."
"Taste was not as intense as the aroma. Tart cherries maybe some plum in there as well. Little oakiness blends nicely. Again little funky."
"Overall, a very interesting beer that I am glad I got the opportunity to try."
"The taste is equally odd, but only semi-enjoyable. Slight roasts matched with an overly sourly vinegar flavor which is overpowering. The mouthfeel lacks any form of life, which adds to my disappointment. All in all, it is drinkable but it wouldn't draw my attention if faced with options."
"D-I can't do 8% sour beers all night, but if i could I would be doing this one."
"M/D - Rather flat but still very full bodied. Finishes very dry leaving the mouth almost chalky. Surprisingly sippable given the tartness and drynes."
"This was one strange brew. In every aspect, it definitely seemed more like a wine (a cheap, young merlot mixed with a bit of sherry, to be exact) than a beer. This may not have been my cup of tea, but I would love to give it to my wine loving friends who have yet to try a beer they like."
"D - Average to a little better. It's a sipper, sort of like a medium-bodied red wine."
"D: Not really digging this one. This was split with beachbun1975 and it was a bit hard to finish my sample."
"The mouthfeel is medum bodied with a GREAT mouthfeel."
"a most intriguing experience."
"A bit disappointed in this one, perhaps my expectations were too high."
"11.2oz bottle from batch 7. Pours a surprisingly dark, opaque brown/black with little to no head. Quite a bit of sediment. Smells quite acidic, with plenty of lactic and acetic character. Slight mineral and sulfur. Sour cherries and a bit of brown sugar. Taste is again acidic with strong mineral notes. Sour, though not strongly so. Ferric. Cherry flavors come through before a dry finish. Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Had higher expectations for this one, though this bottle was slightly oxidized."
"I was perplexed when I poured this super dark brown beer into a tulip because it produced no head and no lacing, huh weird? My nose was met with Brett up front, with some background aromas of stale coffee, sweet dark fruit, and horse blanket. There was a pleasant amount of pucker with a dark roasty background. Thick and a tad chewy with a clean finish, tart doesn't linger. I would like to have this again but the price tag is a little shocking at close to $20 for a small bottle."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a basic snifter glass. The ale appears a cloudy copper color with red hues and barely a finger of light tan foam. Aromas and flavors are of fruity vinegar, tart apples, sour cherries, figs, raisins, oak tannins akin to those present in red wines, medium funk. Nice balance of sweet, sour, and funk. Right around medium bodied with light carbonation, which works well here. Very decent drinkability. The sweet/sour flavors leave me craving more after each sip."
"Pours a murky dark brown with no head whatsoever. Smells of heavy red wine or red wine vinegar to be more precise. Tastes like a mixture of a full bodied red wine with some vinegar and some more over-ripe dark fruit. Leaves a slightly bitter, sour aftertaste. Very warming in the mouth, it has a full,rich body with a creamy mouthfeel. Definitely not my fave from this great brewery, but a good beer and something great to try, nonetheless."
"This beer pours a dark brown with no head or lacing. The smell is very nice of sour cherries and oranges. The flavor has a nice balance between the sour and the malt flavors, big in both, not too big with the sour. The mouthfeel is nice, but the carb level is way low. Very drinkable brew for 8%"
"D - I enjoyed this beer a lot I wish it was more readily available and easier to get my hands on an excellent sour beer that very enjoyable worth the effort to get to try"
"Excellent overall experience."
"get this is you can, it's worth it."
"Drinkability- One of the deepest and most complex beers I have had the fortune of trying. A slight bit too much vinegar flavor for me, but otherwise an outstanding beer."
"I have one more bottle that I have been aging for 6 months now and will continue to age for at least another year."
"D: Glad I got to try this, I'll give my other bottle another year and see what comes of it"
"Pours a murky brownish red with no head. Complex nose. Acetic and oaky with dark macerated cherries, sherry vinegar, and brown sugar. The cherries smell deep and dark with wonderful nuances. The taste is also complex with more of that wonderful cherry flavor. Winey and sour but with a rich but light cherry liquor sweetness lurking in the background, and some very complex funky earthiness with a bit of horseblanket, but not so far as barnyard. Wondefully sweet/tart but with great depth. Very smooth and even a bit creamy, though tart. A very nice version and definitely a bit less acetic than most. Highly recommended."
"good night ;-)"
"Taste is actually quite nice, saving this beer. Carbonation would make it a stellar beer, but its absolute lack of it makes it barely above the average. Lots of highs and lows here."
"This is not for everyone but I loved it. Another great beer by DeStruise. I have a feeling that I'm gonna try to score a few more of this one."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very consistent and slightly thickened, but I am not particularly liking the lack of carbonation."
"4/4.5/4/4/4 A-"
"Overall, a very good sour ale. Very tasty and a pleasure to drink. Very expensive though (~$15 for 330ml). If you like sour ales give it a shot."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Fruity with fig and date flavors most prevalent, undertones of chocolate and grape skin. Medium-full mouthfeel with low carbonation. Semi-dry finish, very acetic. Sourness is moderate and acidity is restrained. Very drinkable stuff, good example of the style."
"Pours a nice cloudy brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, soury, with some plums/cherries. The taste is malty, with some sour plums/cherries. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew."
"The body is vinuous an carbonation is very low."
"D: Not one you would pound, but a nice drink to sit back and enjoy with some fine cheese, which myself, Tony, and Sea Bass did."
"Huge thanks to ygtbsm94 for sending me this, and to tyee for sharing it awhile back. This is really exceptional stuff!"
"Not like any other beer I've ever had, but it shows some characteristics shared with l'Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien 2005. This beer is very drinkable but unfortunately quite rare. Well, well worth seeking out if this sounds like something you'd enjoy. I now consider it one of the great soured ales in the world."
"D: All day in the summer. When pouring, make sure to include the yeast in the glass to add GREAT flavor."
"D : I was extremely disappointed with this one. I've got no plans to seek this one out again."
"D: Amazing drinkability. This is super rare but damn good. The best example of the style I have ever had but the rarity cuts it down a bit. Grab of rodenbach until then."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with a thin tan head. The nose has a good amount of cherries along with oak, tart fruit and some musky funk. The taste is a very nice balance between the sweet and tart flavors. There is a very subtle manure presence. Clean, crisp body suits the style well. Dry, acidic finish. Another delicious brew from Struise. Near perfect."
"D- This one goes down smooth, although it should be sipped like a fine wine."
"Pours dark reddish brown, with no head. Smells sour, alcoholic, and of dark fruits. Lots of yeast in the bottom. Taste is not as sour as the smell. It's sweet, with lots of plum and dark berry, maybe a little cherry. Alcohol is only barely prevalent, but still more than I'd have expected. The more I drink it the more I taste plum, maybe even plum wine. I can't pinpoint what, but this beer really does make me love it with every sip."
"Overall not bad, seriously not the best of the style that I have ever had, but none the less it was still very solid. I would have no issue with trying this one again any day, and I am glad I have a few left."
"I had a bottle of this at the Kulminator in Antwerp, served in a de Struise goblet. The beer was murky brown-red color with a thin wet head. The smell was very good for a Flanders wild ale, lots of vinegary sourness but complemented by sweet cherry and wood. The taste was sour to the point of lip pucker, but you could imagine quite a bit of fruit flavors, maybe apple cider as well. I liked this a lot, but the drinkability score has to be average at best as the acidity keeps you from drinking too fast. Very recommended."
"Drinkability: Oh so drinkable. I was thinking about cracking bottle after bottle..."
"This beer was sampled at the Kulminator in Antwerp, in a Struise tulip. Beer poured a deep brown, iced tea like color with a decent head that receeded quickly. Nose had some definite sour cherry notes and a tart character. Taste was wonderful. Cherry taste was fresh but yet there was a wood character from the aging. Nice sour tone all through the beer made this one hard to put down."
"D: I have limited experience with this style and I wasn't expecting much beside something very sour and tart. The complexities of this blew me away. Very refreshing."
"This pours a nice brown with a red hue to it. There is no head what so ever. The smell to me is of sour cherries but with a sweet smell mixed in there. The taste is surprisingly sour and yet creamy. The sourness isn't over powering at all. I've certainly had more tart/sour beers than what this offers. I also get hints of citrus, grapefruit taste in there. It's really crisp and doesn't much of an after taste. In terms of a Flemish sour beer this is definitely a drinkable beer."
"Pours a cloudy brown with dark ruby highlights when held close to the light. No head whatsoever even when coaxed while pouring. Smells of sour cherries, prunes, slight fusel alcohol in the background and maybe some phenolic in there as well. Tastes incredible! Lots of sour cherries, but not over the top lactic like some others. A bit of caramel malt midway through, some more sour then a bit of alcohol then some more sour leaving a slight puckering in the finish. Vinous flavors throughout. Medium in body with a sticky mouth. Carbonation is just about non existent, still almost. This might need some age to develop some carbonation. I do have time as the bottle says it is best before 7/2011. Great brew, I wish it was more readily available."
"Bottle courtesy of Fonefan: Poured a deep cloudy red color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of oak with some sour cherries and some cloves and some very subtle light black chocolate notes. Taste is also a mix between some black chocolate covered black cherry with some clearly identifiable oak with a sour finish. A lot more complex then most traditional Flemish sours out there. This is definitely a beer I would like to try more often in order to try and decipher all of the characteristics."
"Thanks to iowaherkeye. Murky brown color with a white head; interesting retention to it. Smell was mostly sour, but some sweet caramel and cherry seemed to come in as well. Sourness and oak in the taste, but unfortunately there was also some metallic flavors too. Maybe I'm missing the big deal with this one, but it just wasn't that great to me."
"I had the good fortune to try one of these recently, and was just overwhelmed. This might be the best beer I've ever had; wish I could get my hands on some more. It was served in a wine glass, and had a hazy red/brown color. The thin head was a light brown. Incredible aroma. An extremely earthy, barnyard aroma, intense but pleasant. Somewhat vinous nose also. It had a sour, dark fruit taste. The earthiness translated into a yeast taste. The flavors intensified as the beer warmed. This was a deep, richly rewarding beer."
"Bottle, Stockholm, Sweden. Very dark, almost appears black in the glass, but pours a rustic brown. Full, very light brown head. Vinous nose with a variety of dark sour fruits. Flavor is very sour and acidic, with hints of wild red grapes, blackberry and hints of dried chocolate on the finish. A rich, flavorful beer, with an authentic character, a clean sourness and nice balance. Clearly immensely high in quality."
"Either way, this is the best beer I have every had, and most likely will keep that title after I crack my Westlevteren 12, 8 and blonde. Chris is an amazing man, and anyone that has not made it up there is missing an experience that every beer drinker should have."
"Drinkability: It's certainly different, I'll give it that."
"33cl bottles courtesy of Kulminator - one of the few beer brought home from Belgium."
"Incredibly drinkable and smooth for this style. Brownish red with some alcohol and woodiness in the scent. Medium mouthfeel, soft carbonation, wonderful cherry and lemon and winey and balsamic vinegar malted down - with anything,little head , thanks Hopdog."
"Pours a muddy dark brown with extremely minimal cinnimon head. Smells of sour cherries and black licorice, fig and earthy. Taste is very tart and mildly fruity and a lot of vinegar. This is extremely complex though I must admit my limited knowledge of the style takes away from me knowing them. Medium in the mouth and a dry finish. Sips and drinks like a wine."
"This sour beer pours a brown color with an off white, slight brown head that is rocky and creamy leaving some good lacing along the glass. Smell is of apples, and somewhat a meat broth as well. I can also sense cherries and raspberry in the aroma. Taste is also pungent with cherry and apple with some sour, tart vinegar in the finish. Almost too sour for me, and I didn't find it very enjoyable. I guess I know now to stay away from this style. It is really not for me."
"Despite being flat, this beer is rich & tasty; I am actually quite surprise how good this beer is with the lack of carbonation (the rich mouthfeel really helps here). Hopefully I can get a hold of a carbonated sample of this brew as I have a feeling the carbonation would make this beer quite stellar. I certainly got hung up on the lack of carbonation at first, but the more I taste this beer the more impressed I am by its complexity and balance; I still think some noticeable if not effervescent carbonation would put this over the top though. I actually was a bit disappointed in this beer at first, but it has really grown on me, and in fact really needs to breath a bit before it comes into its own."
" 	The first thought that popped into my head when I tasted it was how rich it was. It started with a toffee like malt flavor. Not overly sweet or cloying but just enough young beer in the blend to balance the sourness or acetic character of the older portion. The fruit profile also changed from that of the aroma. It had more of a spiced citrus and raisins flavor. The finish seemed to last forever. It consisted of vanilla, woodsy phenols, wild bliss and a sweet and sour tug of war that made me want more and more."
"I think this beer will age to 20 years like the old Rodenbach."
"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Bottle. Aroma sizzles with excitement in the forum of cherried smoke, glowing peach esters, and fragrant spice stores of Marrakesh. Pours in drawn earth brown. Flavor incredible. Blows me away with sweet and sour cherry vinous complexity. A world of different and indecent cherry characters explode in a room filled with cork, toasted sesame and a lot of blistering sour orange peel and popping coriander seeds. Acidity is sharp, highlighting the drumming complexity of the fruit, earth and spice that dance forth from the glass. More strong cherries before settling to sleep in the grass with kaffir and coconut. Aged balsamic drizzle over a grilled piece of pineapple, cresting the oaken delivery on the smack. Astonishing unique complexity and character. Too be savored for sure."
"I'm looking forward to the U.S. release."
