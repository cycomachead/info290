"A wonderful Belgian Flanders sour ale. I wish I had the larger portion of the bottle I shared. Pours a lovely dark burgundy color, minimal head. Cherry notes and a slightly woody/barrel quality in the aroma and flavor. Slightly tart and appropriately lactic finish accentuated by the carbonation. Very nice, and don't be afraid of the yeast sediment in the dregs if you're into that sort of thing."

"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a stemless snifter. Smells like I combined my trip to Cantillon with that to Neuhaus. Tastes like a great young gueze with a drop of old Rasputin. Great find for $5 at new beer distributors in NYC."

"O: Did not like on the first sip or two. I think that was just shock as I now think it was quite delicious. This thing needed to warm up a few degrees from fridge temps like most Belgians. This beer has just a crazy amount of flavor, and not just a one trick pony of just sour as it is nicely rounded by the earthy notes."
"Interesting beer. I like the dark ale component and the sweetness can work as a dessert beer. Otherwise, the sweetness, chemical fruitiness, acetic acid, astringent bitterness and lack of carbonation make this one I will avoid in the future."
"O: A very interesting beer - some aspects of a BSDA but more of a Flanders Oud Bruin. Very enjoyable but not for the person that does not enjoy a good tart/sour beer."

"This is a beer that won't overpower you, but has enough sour bite up front to be worthy of another try (although it was on the expensive side)."

"O - Nice interesting flanders. The red wine barrel is nice, the stout notes are on the fainter end but also add a nice touch."
"Lots of nice flavors bouncing off of each other. The wine is probably most prevalent overall for me but the cocoa roast malts, sour ale and Belgian yeast balance out nicely to make a interesting, unique brew."
""
""
"O: Overall a well crafted brew. The natural mustiness was welcoming but I think it may have overpowered the base concoction. The acidity and definitely the tartness was muted and the flavors were not masterfully blended. Good but not in the top five."

"Very dark brown color topped with a moderate frothy tan head. Fruity balsamic-like aroma...sherry, cherries, grapes, blackberries, and raisins. Just a bit of chocolate, but otherwise not much from the malt. Increasing dry oaky notes as it warms. Big time tart fruity flavor, very silky, and delightfully sweet and sour. Black cherries, berries, oak barrel, and a little red wine. Very soft, ""floaty"" mouthfeel with a solid lingering tartness, finishing dry. Sticks to the teeth. Excellent."
"Always wanted to give this one a shot, and really love Flanders beers but even this one from the area really does not do it for me."
""
"O: This is definitely a quality beer, and quite unique in approach. I can imagine that there is a fair amount of batch to batch variation based on the aging and blending methodology. If you like Flemish Reds, Oud Bruins and have an open mind, I think you will appreciate this beer. I'm a bit underwhelmed by the complex barrel aging protocol, which I imagined would be more apparent; I guess it's overshadowed by the tartness. I would definitely buy it again, and I would love to see how this ages."

"O- Intensely sour, but luckily there's enough fruit and malt to keep it within the bounds of drinkability."
"This stuff pours a murky brown little head but you can see bubbles present...smells of oak and something funky.... the first sip is mouthwatering unexpectedly really fruity and sour... superb sour flemish ale.... Lovely acidic tarness with lots of cherry tones... not overly sour but well balaced with oak and aCIdity... wow superb!!!! It is sour though dont get me wrong prob most sour flanders ive tried...Great Stuff!!!"
"overall better than i was expecting. i really enjoyed the taste on this one!"
"Overall I do like this beer. I'm wondering if it's a little past its prime, given the sediment around the top of the bottle rather than on the bottom, as well as the lack of ""oomph"" the cap had once I popped it. The good thing about this style, though: it can be past its prime and still quite tasty and interesting."

"Man....first smelling this beer I knew it was a great Our Bruin Flemish Sour. Smells of sour cherry with a mild barrel funk ending. Very dark mahogany in appearance. Nice white head with a light purple hue...stayed around awhile to a thin lacy head. A small swear brought a little 1/4 finger head back. The taste was what I was hoping for. Sour cherries up front that hits your back sides of your toungue. Then the tart barrel funky sour hits the middle of the tongue to finish...hanging on at the end is a dry almost earthy after taste. This was a great beer. A must have if you like this style."
"Prost!"

"O: In my opinion, this one is super tasty. I tried it on tap at a little event hosted by K&L at Gourmet Haus Staud, and then noticed that K&L had it in bottles. I can see how some people may be offended by the mix of flavors, or maybe they don't like sour and/or smoky beers, to begin with, but I really enjoy both of those flavors, and this beer really puts the two of them together in a great way."
"OV: It is tasty, especially on the finish, but a bit out of balance for my liking. Just a tad too sour/tart to receive a higher rating. Still totally drinkable, just not outstanding."
"Poured a brown body with minimal head and had a tart cherry aroma as well as some oakiness. Medium-bodied, smooth thanks to oak, slight sweetness on backend as well as some woodiness, dominant profile is tartness of the cherry and apple variety (mostly cherry). I like this beer as the sour/tartness is the dominant taste profile but by no means the only profile as there are some malts poking around in this beer."

"Bottle from Freebridge Wine & Spirits in Phillipsburg, NJ, purchased sometime around May 2013."

"O - I'd like it better with some carbonation, but found it to be a very nice example of an Oud Bruin. Similar to Rodenbach Vintage. Better in some ways and not as good in others. A pleasure to drink!"

"I can honestly say I love this beer. It is one of the most unique beers one can experience. It pours a dark dark red which one might mistake for a stout in the right lighting. Cuvee Freddy has little to no carbonation which gives it an interesting mouthfeel. The taste is reminiscent of lambic, wine, and whiskey due to the oak barrels in which it was aged. Friends of mine who like even the most bland of beers were blown away by the flavor. Its a shame I cannot find it at any local liquor store and have to pay $12 a bottle at the Ginger Man bar here in town. I hope they never stop carrying it!"

"O: This beer tastes more like a sour and tart version of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale compared to a Flanders Oud Bruin but is very complex and interesting."

"a curious brew here, pouring a really dark red, almost brown color, with a minimal white head. oddly dark for the style. the nose is lightly sour, but more vinegar than anything. tart cherries and yeasty must also resonate. the flavor is sugary and fruity, with the cherry becoming sort of artificial. the funk to this is really nice. its only minimally sour, and the darker malts give it some sweetness that is a really nice contrast. the alcohol is very well hidden, and if it wasn't so acidic, this would be relatively drinkable. I like the bigger malt bill, but this beer needs a lot more carbonation to keep up with it. it comes across thin and watery as a result of inferior bubbles. overall not a beer I will race to drink again, but an intriguing take on a style that really doesn't make it to America in much variety. I appreciate the effort, and am sure this is much better live at the source. thanks also to claystation for bringing this one over."

"Reading other reviews, it is clear both that (a) this beer is not meant to be as flat as it is, and (b) this is a not uncommon problem with this beer. In the state that I got it, it is not particuarly good, with the body really being a problem. Properly bottled, this might be much better."

"Overall: One of the more interesting beers I've ever had. The lack of carbonation hurt this one big time in my opinion. Still a very good brew, but if carbonated, could have been excellent."
"Cuvee Freddy is an exquisite ale that seems to carry the fundamental complexities of Flanders Red Ales and Oude Bruins but with the aged, earthen maturity of unblended 3-year Lambics. Its a refined taste that deserves a sophisticated palate for true appreciation."

"Overall- I'm torn on this beer. I don't know whether I love it or hate it."
""
"(O)- I can see why not many would like this one, but I certainly do. Like I mentioned before, this is the darkest/deepest take on the style I have had with it being almost so earthy, I do get essences of actual dirt; strange but enjoyable somehow. It is really not much to look at, but the rest of this beer shines."

"Overall an awesome beer."

"For a Flanders old brown, this is decent since it scratches on the surface of what the style could be. But unfortunately, there is really no longevity to the ride, at least not as much as I would think is appropriate. Sure, it hits on the chracteristics of the style very well, but it's gone before you know it and just too thin overall. Don't get me wrong, I like this beer, and it's nice. But if only it could have been just a little bit more, we'd be looking at an amazing beer."

"The flavor of this reminds one of a whiskey sour mixed drink. Just with a touch of carbonation."
"Overall, I was a little disappointed with this brew. It had so much potential, but really slammed it hard with the acidity, steamrolling any true complexity or subtlety that might be there. While the elements themselves might be very pleasant, it fails somewhat as an overall package."

"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy burgundy color ale with a medium size foamy head with average retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of sour and tart notes mix in with light sweet notes and some sherry. Taste is also a nice mix between some tart notes which are well balanced with some notes of sherry and port with a subtle vinous character. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very nice and not too one-dimensional on the sour side of things."

"O: This is a decent enough Flemish brown, but I would have liked to see an even more intense, assertive flavor profile and a bit more chewiness in the mouth. Though it's a little too slick in my opinion, this is an above-average take on the style."
"Eh. Could wear it as a cologne (not really) but I guess I'll just drink and enjoy it (also not really)."
"SkÃ…L!"
"D: All day long easily. I ran 16 miles before I went to Ebenezers and I wish this was at the finish line ready for some thirst quenching."
"Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit stemmed snifter. Poured a massively dark brown (basically black) with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart cherry, acetic acid, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart cherry, caramel, wood, and subtle sour. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This brew really threw me off as it smelled as if it would be much more sour/tart than it actually was. This one did have the tart/sour aspect going on, but it was not the dominant flavor in it at all. The flavors that were present really did a nice job of working together and enhancing one another. Just wish there would have been a little bit of the acetic acid present that I picked up on in the aroma. Defintely worth trying if you get the opportunity."
"Overall this was a very interesting beer and the most wine influenced beer I have ever sampled. I wish I got more of the base beer here but I enjoyed how the sour beer flavors worked with the wine barrel aging. Would have liked more body/carbonation but the wine mouthfeel is appropriate I guess for a red vinous tasting beer."
"Smells really good, but the flavor is a bit sloppy; it starts to be all-over-the-place. This is still a good surprise since this is certainly a beer I'd pass on if I saw it on shelves; actually I'd probably never notice it on shelves."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a low level of carbonation. The alcohol is hidden very well, it never once felt even near 8%. It has decent drinkability and a fair blend of flavors, overall not bad."
"Overall â€“ A good flanders, and one Iâ€™d honestly pick up in the future to see what age would do to it. Iâ€™m in the process of trying to find RR replacements now that Iâ€™m back in IL, and this one may have to do for a Consecration Also wish there was a bit more carbonation."
"Overall -- This is really quite nice. Great roast malt base compliments the tart components. Well-balanced, no elements outpacing the others. I have a sneaking suspicion that I got an undercarbed bottle - will have to try this again. Definitely worth seeking out."
"O: reminds me a lot of Orval, which I love, light bodied but complex and surprisingly strong for an 8%er"
"Its drinkability is enhanced by the softening of the sour flavor in the drying finish. Let it linger on your tongue and you'll also notice hints of leather and dark skinned fruit. Overall, this is an aggressive and slightly acidic beer that serves as a noteworthy example of its style."
"D: In spite of some rough spots, this is a drinkable beer."
"Pour is a very dark brown with minimal head, though there is a thin collar throughout, and some spots form after a good swirl. The nose brings some slight roast along with a good cherry presence, some lactic acid, and a moderate amount of oak. The flavor is fairly acidic with a good oak and tannin presence. The darker portion of the blend is noticeable with some roast. The finish is fairly sour, but also has some good roast. A bit of acetone, though only in the finish. Not more than is worth docking .5 points for. Overall, really solid. Glad to see this on tap two blocks from home."
"A pretty solid beer. I wish I got more cherry flavor and a bit more tartness. That said it has some nice funky notes. I'm glad I tried this one and wouldn't mind revisiting it in the future."
"Cheers!"
"Really nice stuff. Wish I had more."
"d - I liked this flanders a lot> i really enjoy tart cherries and sour dark fruits, so the smell was great to me. Would like to try again."
"The beer pours a dark brownish-red color with a tan head. The aroma is toffee, lightly tart cherries and oak. Very inviting. The flavor is tart cherries, oak and vanilla. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice, lightly sour beer that is very drinkable."
"D- I think I might could drink a whole bottle of this if I tried, and I might one day. I gotta try that oak podge and the one brewed with mustard seed now."
"D- lovely stuff mildly sour and rich. With a nice complex depth."
"D: A quality sour beer here from Alvinne. Never thought I'd get to try it. Good drinkablity, I never knew it was 8%."
"Flavor is really strange. Not bad at all, infact...it's definitely tasty! With that said, not great either. Theres a solid sour taste, which was expected from the aroma, but the coffee is combatting the flavor adding a strange characteristic. Medium body, medium carbonation...booze isn't really noticed. An interesting and tasty beer...grab a bottle if you see it just to taste it for yourself!"
