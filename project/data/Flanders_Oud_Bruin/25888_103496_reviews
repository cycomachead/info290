"Overall:  A decent Flanders but not one that has tremendous complexity or staying power, I would suspect"

"Huge initial punch of sourness that fades rather quickly. Not a large cherry or wine flavor. Has a Flanders Red tannic quality to it."

"Pours a murky honey brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with malt, fruit, funk, and vinegar aromas. Taste is much the same with sour malt, fruit, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Deep tawny pour with fine head that dissipates to fine lacing around edge of glass.. Lots of oak and sweet/sour cherries on the nose. Taste is perfect combination of sweet oaky flavors and sour tartness. Really a nice long finish as well. Doesn't overwhelm with sour and can really tell the cherries are there. Really enjoyed this much more than I expected too. Would highly recommend."

"Very tart and cherry forward, verging on sour. Drying oak in the finish, sour cherries linger long in the aftertaste. Easy to drink with a very light acetic presence that's perfectly acceptable for the style. Sour cherry for days. If you like La Folie, this is even more interesting."

"a very elegant beer, not quite what i would call an oud bruin, but much to appreciate in this brew as far as style fusions are concerned. it has a faded dark red look to it, auburn maybe, without much head at all, just some light khaki fizz around the edges of my wine glass. not overly appealing, it looks like one of those fruited lambics, almost still and cloudy. the nose is great though, tons of tartness, and its sour before it is cherry, although the fruit in this is right up front too. sweet and then tart are the cherries, like pie cherries, they are carries on by a really funky yeast which is a cool combination, a little familiar, but also unique to this beer alone. perennial does a lot of that, and its always appreciated. the base beer itself is a bit confusing, not quite dark or sour enough to be an oud bruin, maybe closer to a flanders red ale, but again, that lactic sourness is too subtle in this beer. it almost tastes like a blend, but i dont think its that either. very enjoyable whatever it is, with the cherries drying up in the finish. hard to tell if its sour from a bacterial sort of fermentation or if its just from cherry juice alone, it could almost be either. the red wine barrel aging likely also muddles just exactly gives it its tartness and moderate acidity. puzzling but wonderfully crafted. a little expensive at over 20 bucks on the shelf, but a very cool beer to try. thanks to drlovemd87 for bringing this one over. it was my girlfriends favorite beer in a night that featured many greats."

"750ml bottle poured into a tulip. Aroma of funk, sour cherry, wine. Hazy reddish brown pour with a beige head that faded quickly, minimal lacing. Flavor of tart sour cherry, red wine, wood, subtle chocolate. Sourness lessened as it warmed in the glass. Finish is a touch hot. Nicely done."

"Overall, this is a fantastic beer and one that I wish was more readily available. As a Flanders Oud Bruin, it's not the best I've ever had, but I've seen it listed as a fruit lambic (kriek), a Flanders red an Oud Bruin and even an American Wild. There seems to be so much grey area between those styles. Either way, it's a beer that I will make a point to drink anytime I come across it. Just outstanding stuff from Perennial."

"Pour is brown with red edges and a tight light brown head. Nose is strange, bready and dough malts abound, a bit musky. Some sour cherry behind but light. Taste is more tart cherry than the nose, the musky bread is there, very strange. Light leathery brett mid palate. Rather full bodied with a strong carbonation."

"The flavor is incredible. Such a well crafted brew. Starts off with tight and noticeable notes of balsamic vinegar tartness; this tartness is quickly followed by some tartness imparted by the cherries. Oh, the cherries, what and amazing facet of this brew.They are tart and puckering but at the same time have a sugary jam quality to them that balances out the tartness that could potentially overwhelm this brew. There are some nice buttery pie crust notes that are perceived as well. Potentially from the yeast notes and the grains. Soo delicious. There are some nice dry vinous notes that work so well with the tartness and lend the beer some more MILD dark fruit sweetness as well as some dryness. The body is perfectly light and dry with lower levels of carbonation that let the flavors shine through. Solid brew in my book."
"Hunt this beer down."
"The beer pours a clear/slightly hazy dark rusty brown with a thin white head that fizzles into an even thinner white halo shortly after pouring. The nose is a mild acetone, cherries, caramel sweetness, and bread. However, upon tasting the beer the flavor is more reminiscent of tart cranberry and pear upfront which transitions into a deeper berry/ester sweetness, and finishes dry with a hint of cherry. I'm really digging the modest, drinkable sour mouthfeel with a fruity, bready, tart finish that doesn't get tired or overwhelming. It's a bit more sour than most flanders, but it doesn't lay down the heavy acetone or slap you in the face with cherries. This is a blatantly delicious beer, one of the best flanders I've had."
