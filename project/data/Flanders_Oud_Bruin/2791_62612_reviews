"A bit weak, no complexity to enjoy but a decent sour fruit wine flavor to enjoy."
"Review acoording to BJCP2008 (style 17C). Bottle 75cl - batch unknown. AROMA: complex malt and esters aroma with notes of caramel, black cherries, some chocolate and dry figs. a low sour aroma is present. APPEARANCE: dark reddish-brown and very clear. slightly tanned head with good retention. TASTE: malty flavour with notes of cherries, caramel, raisins and a sweet-and-sour profile more to the sweet side. low bitterness. PALATE: medium body. moderate carbonation. finishes sweet and tart. OVERALL: a very interesting belgian Brown ale with a nice cherry like profile."

"Yellow coloured and hazy. Has a white head, medium duration. Crisp, malty aroma, yeasty too. And some spice. Coriander and faint citrus, orange. Flavor starts sweet and has a nice hoppy note, faint metallic, finish moderate bitter. Creamy texture and soft carbonation."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Decent head, fair lacing. Nose has some slightly roasted grain, but mostly overpowered by some candied sweetness and fruit. Mostly fruits and syrup in the flavor. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"The reviews are low from others, probably due to them not aging this beer. Age it! If I had this beer without the age, I'd probably be with the 2.9 score crowd. Once aged, however, you have to PAIR this with French toast and vanilla bean ice cream or baby back ribs and a lot of garlic mashed potatoes and bread sticks"
"Out of balance and not enough bitter, tart, or transitional complexity. Just ok."

"Overall: Sweet enough to make one shudder in revulsion (I know I did). Like cherry cola dosed with stray Pixy Stix. Oooh, you see? I shuddered again. I'll likely shudder again when I see how much I wasted on this thing."

"O - Very nice appearance, the ruby color is mouthwatering. Smell has good complexity, no brett smells, no big fruitiness. In the taste it has a helping of malt that is rare to find, sourness is pleasant to hide but lacking a flavor complexity. Carbonation seemed a little on the low side for the style."
"Iâ€™m glad to have shared this one."

"O: not bad but there's better out there, pretty low on the sourness but not bad for somebody that doesn't want to jump in all the way quite yet."
"O: too sweet, no subtlety"
"pours clear mahogany to transparent brown, fizzling white head, soda-like bubbles. smells like grainy belgian malt, medium roast, with dried cherries, raisins, and toffee. flavor is less fruity than the nose, more malty than anything, with a definite alcohol flavor, which is odd in a beer with such a low abv. its earthy and a little sweet. muthfeel has a sort of winey vibe to it, not acidic at all, but the same sort of groove and texture, add carbonation. overall not my favorite beer, certainly not my favorite belgian, but a servicable belgian brown. was expecting a bit more sour to it, but really there is very little of that happening here."
"Overall, I'm a little disappointed. I was ready for a really good Oud Bruin after the nose, and it pretty much fell flat on its face."

"M. Thin watery body, medium carbonation, at least the carbonation isn't super-charged and distracting like the other Timmermans in this session."
"Body seems a bit watery."
"A session brune, if that's what you're after."

"overall - is this the bmc of flanders oud bruin? not sure, but enjoying the cherry coke. would pick this up again if it was a buck a piece. great intro for people not into beers, especially if they like sodas."
"Taste similar. Some tartness from berries and cherries, and roasted malts sweetness."
"Pours a rich brown color, nice sized head and some lace sticking. Aroma of sour cherries and vinegar. In the taste, malty, slightly sweet, with a veritable underground of sourness. Brown sugar like sweetness, mildly tart, and somewhat malty. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety. Overall, a nice flanders brown ale and a solid session change of pace brew."
"Overall: This is not a bad beer but not what I would hope for in this style. There are enough other, better and available beers in this style that are more satisfying. I wouldn't buy it again."
"750ml bottle, no cork, just an usual cap. Dark brwon colour, with beatiful reddish hints to the light. Good beige creamy head with lace. Aroma is very acidic, with fruits (cherry specially), wood, caramel and brettanomyces. It feels good on the tongue, although a bit light. Taste is acidic, fruity, sherry wine and brattanomyces are there."
"If this beer had more of the expected sourness I would have given much higher marks on taste and overall. I really like the style, this one just falls short."
"Overall: This is kind of a weird beer."
"Overall: Not really one I'd seek out again."
"A poor example of a Flanders, but if you're looking for a good cherry beer, this is fine. Not a problem to drink, but I'd like some complexity and at least some sort of tart/sour bite."
"The beer was cola colored with a bubbly tan head. It smells like sour cherry cola with just a hint of sweet malt and oak. The taste is a little more complex with sweet cola, black cherry, molasses and a tart finish. The beer is lighter than it looks with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. I thought this was a good and interesting beer, proof that you can't trust all overall ratings on here."
"Not bad for the style, but certainly not anything to write home about. While the malts are nicely balanced with the tartness (lots of prune and grape right up front with sour cherry and sweet malty backbone) the flavor overall is a little thin. That's really the only major complaint--the sweetness and maltiness seem so balanced because there's really no dominant flavor in the beer. Similar to a slightly watery Petrus Oud Bruin, but with dissipated complexity. Nevertheless, it's always nice to be drinking a barrel-aged Belgian."
"Future outlook: This wasn't a ""bad"" beer by any means, but there's no real reason to purchase again."
"O- i regret spending $10 on this. never again. the real bruin brewers in belgium would roll their eyes at this. typical brown ale (thats that the back says)? my ass."
"Overall this beer was unpleasantly sweet. I repeat: odd..."
"I bought this because it was a ""brown ale"" and english and/or american brown ales I typically like. However this is hardly a brown ale in either of the sense of those two types. It says ""belgian"" brown ale on the bottle, and it's clasified aas flanders oud bruin....not sure on all these other names- I am from the united states. Just didn't taste good to me, tasted sour and there was little other flavor to it. Very one note on this one, which was a bad note unless you like sour though I think this might be because of the style...however I still believe they should have labeled this something else which is why I am writing a review...if you like browns...you probably wont like this."
"P.S. reading up, I see that this is a unique beer produced by mixing a lambic with a ""high fermentation brown ale"" (""infusion of Lambic"") which is then aged for 6 months in oak barrels"
"Nothing spectacular, but certainly something I'd get again when I have a sweet tooth or need something mild. Plus, because of the fairly low octane, it's a nice item at Belgian restaurants when you're driving, too."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a cream-colored head. The aroma consists of some toffee malt but nothing else. The flavor is toffee malt with some light cherry notes and some brown sugar. I get no sourness or not tartness. Disappointing. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Nothing really interesting with this beer and not really worth seeking out unless you just need the tick."
"The appearance of this beer is a deep brown color with a very slight white head. The smell is of a candied sour cherry...it's not exactly a beer smell. The taste is similar...the sourness is there, but a little muted, and the sweetness seems to take a lot more from sugar than from malt. Thin and a little watery in body, with a decent bitterness and sour pucker at the finish. All in all, this is a real dismantlement for the style."
"D- This is a interesting take on the style. A little more carbonated than what I am use to. There is a over the top sweetness that destroys any of the sourness that could be in this beer. Overall a lackluster beer in the style. Average at best...well maybe a little under average."
"I liked it, not bad at all, but I'm going back to my cask Elissa after this."
"Good velvety mouthfeel and medium bodied."
"Mouthfeel is pleasant, however, I believe this could have a bit more discernible carbonation. Not a bad example of the style, but there certainly *are* better choices out there."
"This beer pours a nice deep reddish to cedar colour. Off white head with decent lacing. The smell is of cherries and some bready malt, noticeable Belgian yeast. The taste starts off sour cherries to me and finishes with a sweet candied sugar malt. I pick up a metallic like taste about mid palate, not sure what that's about. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and semi dry. This would be a good introductory sour."
"11.2 ounce bottle, bottled on 05/10/10. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with some hints of ruby red, and has about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is cherries (both sweet and tart), oak, and some vinegar. The taste is kinda like the aroma, but the taste is more sweet than tart (and not a good sweet taste), and there's also a weird off-flavor that I can't tell exactly what it is. It's not awful, but it's not exactly good, either. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's watery and has decent carbonation. Drinkability is average. Didn't really care for this brew, it's just not for me I guess."
"12oz bottle that I believe was $3.79. Dark brown color, a little head. This smelled a little sweet and tasted slightly sweet as well. One dimensional and honestly the most boring oud bruin that I have had the misfortune of purchasing. I will not be buying any of the timmerman's lambics as I assume I will be equally disappointed."
"M + D: I didn't find this to be all that bad, but I would probably be more likely to reach for Monk's Cafe, Duchesse, Rodenbach, etc... if I were looking for the style. I would be very open to trying another in regards to the flavour profile, though, as it seems very unusual."
"D: The beer is rather easy to drink and goes down smoothly. I would consider it to be sessionable if it had a little more sourness to balance out the sweet flavors."
"Notes - When I first saw this beer, I was hoping I finally found a replacement for Goudenband. It's no Goudenband, though. Though reasonably tasty, it isn't very complex, and in my opinion isn't sour enough. It may be useful for someone who's trying to ease into sours, but I can't recommend it otherwise."
"The flavor is sweet, no sign of funk, rather pedestrian. This is a beginners bruin, as a seasoned drinker, I don't even recognize this as an Oud Bruin, more like a Belgian amber ala Biere du Boucaneer."
"We feel the Oud bruin nose, that is to say, tannins and fruit with a touch more style caramelized cinnamon biscuit. The problem is that the mouth is too yeasted and that input is far too timid and unobtrusive compared to its big sisters like Goudenband, especially acidity here is far from sharp, almost to the limit the non-existent. Looks like a mix between a beast and a brown Belgian oud bruin low quality. The taste of tannin is also rejected by the addition of a dye unpleasant. In the end, even the finish is below with a taste between toasted malt and the dye. What a shame."
"Overall: Tasted like if they made a flanders version of coke. And I mean that in worst possible way."
"This is my first example of this style and it strikes me as somewhere between a French Biere De Garde and a Belgian bruin. Strange drink, probably not as beer-like as others but enjoyable."
"Overall, an average Oud Bruin. It was hurt by the watery aspects in it. Avail here in TX. Not many Oud Bruins available here so would get the rare bottle if all I can find. [R;O]"
"A boring oud bruin that should not be drank if your expecting a typical sour."
"D: Fine, Kriek/sodaish."
"ran into a lot of this type of oud bruin in poland. A darker ester enhanced by heavy handed sugaring that has an alternative fruity flavor. This poured amber cherry clear. Makes me think this was a brown with a ton of sugar brought to a heavy boil. The only flavor this beer has is in the unfermentables, the rest is candy. A dark fruit synthetic amalgamation. A hint of tang. Predominately blackberry, some malt...but guilded in sugar."
"This is garbage, and I don't say that easily. It's an insult to traditional Flanders Ale, and represents the sugary, watered down ""wine cooler-ification"" of traditionally sour Belgian styles. Out of 40 Oud Bruin reviews, this was the worst."
"D - it was ok as a novelty but I wouldn't drink this regularly."
