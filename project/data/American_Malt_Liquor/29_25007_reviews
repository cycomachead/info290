"its ok, i likw the higher alcohol. seems a bit sweet."
"$1.49. Was not too bad. Cheap"
"Gets you buzzed fast, so that's not that bad. Not good for much else."

"I have to agree with many of the reviews here, for a bottom of the barrel, bargain basement brew it's not half bad."
""
"It looks like apple juice.  There's odd golden brown color to it with excellent clarity and vibrant carbonation bubbles.  No head whatsoever.  Faint cereal grain lager yeast aroma.  The taste is a mix of cereal grains.  Like a sweeter version of honey nut Cheerios.  The mouth is moderately carbonated and yet designed to be quite smooth."
""

"Overall: this is just an unfortunate beer.  Its flavor is bad *for the style*, which is really saying something."
""
"Better than expected, smooth flavor, amber color.  This is meant to do one thing and it does it well.  Drink one of these and you will feel it.  Weak aroma but that isn't unusual for malt liquors."

"Hurricane is a surprisingly solid malt liquor, arguably my favorite of the ones I've tried. Many of them are either far too thin to be enjoyed, suffer from a pungent taste if their temperature drops just a few degrees, or shamelessly bear their alcohol in the taste, making for an unappetizing experience (I'm looking at you, Camo Silver Ice and sighing whenever I see the Camo Black Extra 24oz can in my fridge). Hurricane doesn't provide an overcompensating palette of flavors nor does it find itself being too thin and basic to really be enjoyed on a level other than a dirt-cheap malt liquor. It's genuinely pleasing, packs a simple but refreshing taste to it, and provides a nice buzz if the can is drank fast enough. It's a marginally-winning combination."

"Clear, gold appearance. If poured aggressively, a head will appear, but then vanish almost instantly. Fruity aroma with the corn. Again, the fruitiness shows up in the taste, and the alcohol can also be detected. It sorta coats the mouth with an oiliness. Medium body. Fairly dry finish and kinda sour. Overall, it is what it is, and that is all that it is."
"Overall: This 40 surprised me in both its alcohol content and its lack of residual sh*ttiness. Dare I say that this malt liquor is even refreshing? That remains to be seen, one can not know its true nature until he ingests one in its entirety; another property that 40's share with sex toys. I recommend this beer be paired with a Burger King Angry Whopper™ on an overcast spring day in order to allow the flavours of both to fully develop. This beer is not recommended for extended cellaring, unless ABV exceeds average range. Enjoy."

"I copped a buzz off of half a 25 ouncer and I'm likely to either drink the rest or cook with it. Think about it… the time wasted on a bad review could be spent drinking Bass, Guiness or Fosters. I mean, really, you like their Super Bowl commercials, right? They always make me smile and sometimes even bring a tear to my eye. OMG…this site is for connossieurs, right? If you don't like it why don't you drink a glass of water instead."

"Uninspired, but not offensive. Good buzz factor at +8% if that is your mission."

"To $5.00 on steel reserves and 4loko, I can get piss drunk off three cans for less than four bucks and still afford a couple mcChickens and a hit of dope. God bless America. ""Hurricane, the homeless' Heady Toper"""
"Hurricane High Gravity Malt Liquor aslo known as Hurricane High Gravity Lager. I got a 25 oz of this to do a review. Poured this into a glass. The Color is a drak amber. Small white head after the first pour. Smell was ok nothing to bad ...The tease was not the greatest but not the worst. You can tell the 8.1 abv in this brew. I will say this the can says be bold and it is bold be smooth and it is smooth going down. Mouthfeel was ok. Overall this brew is a 3 nothing good but nothing bad. I good brew if you want one or you are low on cash. I will take you where you want to go."
"Note: my review stats might seem high here, but I'm judging the beer on what it is- cheap, strong lager beer for those times when you just want something light in body yet high in alcohol...or when you're broke. Cheers!"

"O - To me this is one of if not the best in this class (high ABV/low cost). You really need to drink this one cold. The 8.1 % ABV is not all that evident and this one can sneak up on you fast. There are some really bad HGs out there and this isn't one of them."
"BETTTER THAN 4 LOKO ,TILT ,JOOSE ,MIKES HARDER LEMONADE OR ANOTHER FAKE ASS SUGARY SWILL"

"Our corner shop doesn't have much variety, so I tend to try anything new that they get in. Dark gold-brown beer with not much head but lots of carbonation. Smells of musty corn and metal. It tastes, well, bad. Like watery, stale ginger ale with a hint of copper. I'm not picky at all when it comes to beer (you'll often find Natty Light or PBR in my fridge), but this is one that I won't ever be drinking again."

"The alcohol is not hidden in the slightest, it sits overtop of a big corny sweet and slightly syrupy body. Very grainy and husky, and just not tasty at all."
"Hi well my old rating was 2.5 without the whole review and after closely inspecting this beer and drinking more and more of it and others my score has increased. I just drank one of these and honestly this is an amazing beer. I just bought a 16 oz for $1.06 some places they might be about $1.25 or so well anyways the beer tastes really good for 8.1 % alc and the buzz you get is very nice waaayyy better than 211 thats all i got to say. have a nice day"
""
"O - If drinking a 24 ounce can on the way home from work were legal, I would do it. It is cheap and gives some bang for the buck."
""
""
"O- Overall, I feel this is just a high abv% corn based beer with no malt in it. I thought it would be a nice malty malt liquor, but this was not the case. I'm pretty disappointed in this."
"O:For the style it's a decent malt liquor, pretty darn drinkable for the ABV. If your a malt liqour fan you would most likely enjoy this very much so."
""
""

"better than I expected but I probably won't buy again"

"Overall, it's shit."

"Overall - I'll never try this again. I didn't even drink half of a beer and I'm feeling sick to my stomach."

"This is by no means a great beer, but when viewed by style it's not bad. It has some drinkability despite its off flavors. It's dirt cheap. If money's tight (like maybe you're a teacher and it's summer like me) then these are the kind of beers you look for."
""
""
"O: If one's strapped for booze-cash, this here is the way to go. There aren't many US malt liquors that are good at all when enjoyed warm (as is my preference) -- this is one of them. That's a high accolade for such a cheap brew; AB has done something very right with this mass-market product, though I have a feeling the name might not be such a good thing down along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts!"
"Aroma is - hello? Aroma! I don’t get a whiff of anything that resembles beer. It pours a clear yellow with a fairly thick and fluffy white head, but this is the brew’s strongest point. Flavor is at least present, but it is just malty, no complexity or depth, and leaves a tinny aftertaste. Texture is smooth, a bit thin, and barely fizzy at all. I bought it just to try something different. At least it helps me appreciate craft brews."
"O - Pretty standard malt liquor flavor that gets pretty boozy in the end. Not a great beverage, but damn this packs a punch."
""
"Surprisingly good compared to most of the other malt liquors I have tasted lately. And that oddball honeydew melon smell was actually quite nice."
"Overall – What can I say, kind of a standard malt liquor in flavor only a bit lighter in sweetness and body. It is very easy to drink due to its lighter qualities (sweetness body), although that may not be a good thing due to its heavier qualities (abv.)"
"From Fred Meyer, S.Salem store. $1.19..yeah its been a bad day and i am broke. Cant believe i actually poured this into a mug!! But its bright,clear pale yellow with a artificial looking impressive creamy ,thick head. paper,corn and alcohol aroma Taste sweet malts but actually not as sickeningly sweet as expected..its a rather soft sweetness, some apples in there too.. Actually surprisingly OK in the mouthfeel..slight alcohol"

"Malty sweet malt bomb. Very thin mouthful. For 8.1 cant taste the booze. Malt covers the booze. Serve ice cold makes a difference. Can't beat the price $2.99 for a 4 pack of 16oz cans! This beer is a proper sessional beer when kicking back and hanging out with friends."
""
"For the price I feel as if I had this coming to me, 2 beers worth for a buck what did I expect?"
"Flavors of apple and wet manila folders. Ritz crackers and vague sweetness. Light body and easygoing feel when cold. Dry and surprisingly clean aftertaste. Maybe not all that surprising, coming from AB: King of (consistently bland) Beers. Wonder what kind of adjuncts they threw in here to jack up the ABV. The cleanliness of this malt liquor is it's best asset, and it never becomes harsh like so many others. One thumb halfway up."

"OK, the first sip of this beer was torture. But it got a bit better as my tastebuds got used to the idea. In this small window this beer needs to be finished quickly, because as it warms it becomes awful again. It makes me feel young again, holding my nose to drink the first few."
"Bought this at a ""quick stop"" convenience store in Festus, MO on my way to Bonne Terre. When I got to my destination, I pulled out my Hurricane High Gravity Lager and poured it. Appearance was average, it looked like a typical malt liquor. Smell was grainy. Taste was smooth, smoother than Steel Reserve. No alcohol burn like the reserve. It was slick and coated my tougnue perfectly. I'd have this again in a heartbeat."
"no need to give details just because of the style but this ML by AB is one of the best to pick up for the price and ABV. at only $1.29 a tallboy. this is the cheap way to party! the taste is cleaner than most ML and a slight note of real hops is tasteable! does not give the after alcohol burn that most ML do."
"The taste is pretty much all sweet and lemony with a alcohol backbone. This light bodied beers' aftertaste is also lemon filled and leaves your mouth with this moist wetness."
"D - Surprisingly decent, although it'd still be a challenge to put down a 24oz can. I don't understand these 8% malt liquors either - you have to suffer 50% more to achieve the same level of inebriation. Still, this would be in the upper quarter of gas station offerings."
"This is the best beer in its category. Far superior to other cheap 8.1% abv beers. If you're broke or homeless, this will do the trick."
"Final thought - if you need to get drunk get simpler times lager. You get a six pack for 1 more dollar"
"Overall Drinkability - Not too bad for an American Malt Liquor. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink this for tasting purposes, but if catching a quick buzz on the cheap is your goal, then it's an interesting beer."
"Not horrible, but I can't imagine a locale that doesn't have something better to drink. And if you're poor, get a better job."
"Also worthy of noting, the main label advertises this as a lager, but on the side of the can it claims the beverage to be an ale. Anyone else curious?"
"I think this beer is ok for those that want a great buzz in a short amount of time without having to hold your nose while shotgunning it."
"This doesn't have much flavour at all. It's got a little bit of a bitter, metallic taste. It has a slight ""bad beer"" taste. There's some corn flavour in there, but somehow the corn flavour is far worse than that in other corny malt liquors. The aftertaste of this beer is really terrible. It tastes sort of like metal and terrible cheap cereal grains. This is far better than its primary competitor, Steel Reserve, because it doesn't taste like a fly-by-night operation at a dirty chemical plant. But it's certainly not good. It tastes like maybe they put too much effort into not making it overly sweet, but forgot to not make it gross."
"Overall - not interesting at all, but ok in taste. I tastes more than nothing, but tastes less than foul."
"Could be a repeat buy for the warmer months to come..I'm finding that the big breweries' malt liquor offerings are better beers than their big selling mainstream name brews."
"good bang for you buck as far as alcohol goes (24oz can cost me $2) but I think I'd rather have a 40 of old english. i guess you get what you pay for."
"Notes: Pretty much what you expect from a mass produced malt liquor. A bit less fruitiness than others. It taste slightly different from the others, but it is really better or worse than other similar malt liquors."
"Pours a pale golden color with a thick white head and a little lacing. Smells of sweetness like creamed corn and a little grass. Tastes a lot like corn and booze mixed together like ethanol or something would. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Drinkability is well below average."
"D/N- I think a 24oz can will be enough. I guess this beer is ok. A friend of mine left a can at my house. I wouldn't buy it unless all I had in my wallet was 1.49."
"My roommate brought this to me. What a guy! Poured into a pint glass and reluctantly consumed. The body pours a transparent yellow body with lots of visible carbonation and a small fizzy white head. The aroma is grainy, kind of wheaty and a bid medicinal. Something about a cough syrup aroma that doesn't sit well with me in beer. The taste and the smell may as well just be one in the same. Just grainy and medicinal. Bleh. This is kind of light and over carbonated and really boozy in the mouth. My roommate brought this to me and called it ""the cheapest swill on the market."" It's clear why. However, it does go down pretty easy, just as long as you close your eyes and open your gullet."
"I don't recommend this at all."
"I am guessing at BA, we are all pretty much beer lovers who are supposed to appreciate beer because of the taste. I don't make a regular habit of drinking this stuff, but I am not going to lie---there is a time and a place for drinking a cheap, very high ABV, no-brainer brew that will make you feel good and fuzzy inside, and is ridiculously cheap. Honestly, of all the AB products, I actually consider this to be one of the best ones----decent taste (none of that terrible sour rice flavor of Budweiser), cheap price, great buzz, and overall easy drinking."
"overall, you get what you pay for. if youre looking to get a buzz, this is fast and cheap. If youre looking for taste I would recommend leaving this one at the store"
"D- For a malt liquor not to bad but for only light drinking occasions."
"Not too terrible. This was my divorce beer, but it's been a while since I re-tried it (as a refined drinker). Not too disappointed, it's worth the $1.09 it costs."
"Worst.Beer.Ever"
" quantity not quality."
"D- prob. the most alcohol you can get for 5 quarters, wish i could give it a 0, esp. as it warms, if you're hard up enough to drink this do yourself a favor, dig up the other 3 quarters and get youself a vicodin"
"Can poured into a pilsner glass. Pours a deep dark gold with a thick white head on top. Good sticky lace left behind. Scents of cheap husk, dry grains, and lemon. The body is pretty full for the style and brewer. Pretty crisp as well. Flavors of heavy grains, corn, honey, light booze. Bitterness is low. This wasn't all that bad. Pretty good beer for campfires, tailgates, cookouts, etc. When cheap beer is in need, it's Hurricane indeed."
"Would pair horribly with everything."
"M/D: thick carbonated water. drinks better than others ive had so far, but it could be the fact that its the first cold drink after work."
"The best malt liquor I have had. Despite its high ABV, it's better tasting than many other A-B products I have sampled. And it's cheap. Give it a shot. See what you think. It may not suit you. But if so, ask: Is it really worse than some other (non-malt) macros you have drunk recently? If not, why shouldn't you keep it in your (occasional) rotation?"
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is strong corn. No doubt what this beer is brewed with. The flavor is very sweet corn with the slightest hint of orange citrus. Light mouthfeel and medium carbonation. For a macro-produced malt liquor this is not terrible, but compared to regular beers, this is one to avoid."
"Sweet, but not as much as I had feared and the alcohol is a bit more tame...still looms large, but not unbearable. Fruity alcohol and the honeyed adjuncts with zero hop presence make for an interesting beverage indeed. The mouthfeel is actually pretty creamy and full bodied for a malt licka. Not bad, but is far from my favorite version of the style. Many of the ""High Gravity"" offerings are tough to choke down, unsurprisingly."
"From 24 fl. oz. can no. 10055-NB64. Sampled on May 30, 2010. The pour is a highly carbonated golden yellow with a fizzy white head that shrinks quickly. The aroma has a tolerable malty note with a vague hoppiness too. The alcohol taste is better masked than I expected on this particular can. It really had a malted but corny flavor and left no aftertaste. Actually this was smoother than others I have had and I feel I should rate it higher than previous raters."
"I actually do drink some malt liquors, but this smelled and tasted like fuel, less calories, but a really strong alcohol aftertaste-pass on this one..."
"RJT"
"Uhhh....'surprised' is definitely the word of choice. I thought this would be poor at best. It's actually good for the style and would not even rank in the worst 25% beers I've had. Everything about this beer at first appearance indicates it will be mass-produced swill with only the bottom line considered. Not sure that some of that isn't true, but it might be the best cheap high-gravity malt liquor I've had. Further proof that AB has the capability to brew good beer (if that ever becomes their goal)."
"d: Surprisingly an enjoyable drink, but be warned it isn't for the faint of heart, and is not for someone who doesn't enjoy malts, otherwise it is a great brew, that has a decent flavor and a good alcohol content. Try it, and choose your side."
"D: This is not really any worse than other malt liquors I have had, but I would say there are better options out there in this category. The booze is a bit too noticeable for me."
"Poured in a glass it is a darker yellow expected from malt liquor. The smell not so great I expected it to be a little stronger. The taste is rather decent considering the abv%. It is rather smooth with a light mouthfeel that finishes suprising clean with a hint of alcohol taste. For the price and abv% it works out nicely when you can't afford your favorite!"
"Faint spice and sweet malt aroma. It's exactly the same color as your piss when you're dehydrated. Head disappears immediately. Flavor of sweet malt and skunky medicine. Hides the alcohol pretty well. It's just plain awful but if you need to get drunk with the change in your couch this is the one for you."
"Poured from a tall can into a glass, with born on date on bottom of the can. Pours out with little head and minimal carbonation. Bold yellow color, creamy film on top of the glass. Faint banana, smell along with extra sweetness. Flavor is not to complex, sweet flavor. Tastes of sugar and corn. Mouthfeel is pretty bland. Drinkable nature is okay. Paired okay with a cheese burger."
"Over the years this has become my favorite high gravity malt liquor.  It's not easy to call a beer of this style refreshing, but I'd almost go that far with this one.  A great high gravity to introduce friends to the style.  Easy to drink, easy to find, easy on the wallet."
"Poured from a clear 40 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a small head. Smell is mostly of alcohol, some malts. Taste is alcohol, a hint of malts and just a touch of sweetness. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall not terrible but nothing special here."
"The bad thing is after i drinked the half of the can, this beer bored me and didn't finished."
"Cheers!"
"It began with a finger of bone-white head, but it quickly reduced to mere wisps. The color was a deep golden amber with NE-quality clarity. Bubbles were evident in the beer due to his high clarity. It had a real BUPGOO look to it. Nose had a definite lager sweetness along with a fruity quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a berry-like sweetness - strawberry, red raspberry (along those lines) on the tongue. Finish was somewhat dry with that berry quality lingering well after the swallow. Frankly, not bad for a CANned malt liquor."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - First off let me say that if your drinking this brew, you must be looking for a good buzz. Assuming that's the case, I think this is one of the smoothest HG Malts out there, at times it got a little offensive, but nothing near other HG Malts with around the same ABV. I could easily drink as many as I wanted with this beer, knowing that I'm getting the most for my money, flavor & ABV wise. This one was pretty smooth considering how much alcohol was in it, I definitely recommend this for someone that's low on cash, looking for a good buzz, and not wanting to settle for Steel Reserve or worse. Cheers!"
"Poured from a 40 ounce bottle that cost less than $2.00 plus tax. Head was so small or unimportant or of so little consequence as to warrant little or no attention. Smell was grainy. Color was yellow. Taste was awful, typical of adjunct type lagers. Mouthfeel was average. Drinkability, you got to be kidding. If you like hiigh ABV and a cheap price and you are real thristy, this brew is for you."
"Pale golden with a rocky white head that fades quickly, large bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Steely grits, soft citrus and alcohol all mingle in the nose. Corn sugar and a slightly metallic graininess with a dry, clean finish. Alcoholic heat is felt, but it's not overpowering. Medium light bodied with massive, gassy carbonation. An above average malt liquor... if you can like the style for what it is."
"What was I thinking?"
"Overall: Daddy out."
"I only put serving type as bottle because a 40 was not an option. I've actually had this a few times but that is probably because I'm in college and because I'm cheap. It pours a light yellow with almost not head. The taste is like licking a metal fence. It really does not go down well and the 8.10% can really put you on your ass. I'm still hungover and its 7pm. Thanks High Grav."
"Inoffensive for the style. Very easy to drink for the ABV."
"Not as bad as I would have guessed, but still not something I would set out to drink."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick fizzy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a faint pilsner malt scent with loads of adjuncts and a dry lager yeast aroma. There is little to no hop aroma present. The taste is below average. It has an extremely dry taste that barely resembles beer. It's crisp and clean, but it's devoid of any malt character. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is poor tasting beer. I'm not a big fan of malt liquors in general, but this one just isn't very good. It's one and done for me."
"I bought it expecting it to be your ordinary, run of the mill flavorless cheap malt liquor. Boy was I wrong! The moment I got this stuff in my mouth I wished I had just left it in the cooler. One of my buddies described it as ""liquid ass," and I don't think he was far off."
"D - At first I wasn't a huge fan of this any more than any other malt liquor, but it's grown on me a little bit. The sweetness is toned down and the alcohol is hidden a bit better than other malt liquors. Lighter body lowers the cloying factor of this, and lowered sweetness keeps it easy to drink. Not too bad for what it is."
"That's right katz & kittenz, I am not below reviewing a canned malt liquor. You have to try everything once, right? Out of the 24 fl oz can this beer was a bright straw gold color with an eggshell white head that at first was huge and billowing. It died back to a thin layer of white bubbles that actually retained itself pretty well and left good lacing. The aroma was standard macro sh--, corn mash and metallic notes on top of alcohol. The flavors were actually not bad, a generally inoffensive macro lager that displayed elements of fruit sweetness and mash-grain sourness in equal parts. The mouthfeel was average and a little prickly, the body medium but the finish was slick and cheap like a carnie. All-in-all I expected to fail this one but for the malt liquor style I had to give it decent marks."
"The taste is at first primarily meaty, musty fruity alcohol. It's a cheap fortified sweet white wine quality. This settles down a bit, but becomes thinner and weaker. Although a faint hint of grain is noticeable, it ends up being rather bland. The feel is fairly full, almost oily. That said, it's fairly drinkable."
"Poured a 24oz, big mouth can into my oversized Triple Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a darker then normal, straw yellow with a big fish eyed bubbly head. About the head, it was there for about 5 seconds. That surprised me a bit. It was huge for a bit and then gone, like it was never really there. The aroma is very straightforward. Diesel fuel and bananas. Wow, its like I pumping diesel into my wife's Jetta TDI using a banana as a spigot. Horrible stuff. Nothing else. The taste isn't as ""bad"" as I thought it was going to be. But bad really is a subjective word. The taste is very fusel, up front with bananas, corn, and a bit of heat. The mouthfeel is really spicy and acidic. Overall, this beer is bad. Not worth buying. But if you ever intend to join the GBU BIF, this is something to really consider sending as the Ugly."
"wtf...got a bunch of friends who don't ""respect beer"" bring this to beer pong and watch as they are caught by it's potency...pleasure guaranteed:)"
"D: Very drinkable. This was actually not that bad. I would drink another and many more. If I am in a bind I will go pick up a 24 oz of this baby. Can't beat it for the price."
"D- This beer can bring the fury, and I'm not doubting the hurt too. I hope Fema can come rescue me after this one. I'm a trooper and I'm just going to have to chug this. Shutter."
"Poured a light golden yellow with a thick white head that stayed. Aroma was malty cereal grains. Taste was very metallic with cereal grains and a sour aftertaste. Texture was thin and watery. This beer is about what I expected, not much. The taste was not good, even on a hot day. Due to higher alcohol content I would use as a way to get slammed quick."
""
"D: 3 because it's a decent malt liquor. Still, there's zero flavor or character to this beverage, so I won't be buying again."
"Goldish color with a white head. A bitter grassy nose makes me quiver. The taste is no better. Alcohol and old feed corn. The body is light and has enough carbonation for 80 ounces of liquor. And yes, this is liquor, not beer. It drinks like liquor as well."
"I paid $1 for this 24oz. can that is 2.5 months past the born on date. Appearance is a light golden with a thick crisp head that dissapates rather quickly. Smell is not much other than light grains and alchohol. Taste is slightly sweet, grainy and alchohol. Mouthfeel is light with some body there and a good spike of carbonation. For a lager it does have that ""brewed for a distictive bold taste"" but nothing complex, but still better than originally expected."
"Prost!"
"Drinkability: This is an alright drink, but I'd limit myself on it, mostly because of the aftertaste."
"Drinkability: It's just barely tolerable, I think that's the nicest thing to be said of it. Paired well enough with a handful of salted pretzels."
"This beer is golden in color and pours with a nice white head. I actually prefer this over bud or bud light. I made the mistake of drinking three of these in one night and woke up with a pretty bad hangover. Not bad for the price, gets the job done well."
"drinkability is ok,but a little rough, and I'm sure a headache will follow, however I DID find this rather interesting for this type of beer..worth a try maybe?..if your budget is really, really tight. :P"
"This ""High Gravity Lager"" AKA Malt Liquor is great if you want a cheap drunk but not very satisfactory as a beer. It pours a reddish brown like amber with a head and lave that disapear quickly. The smell is faint but metallic. The taste or lack of there of is very sweet but sour and corn like. There a mild hint of some type of almost fruity flavor to it. It is fizzy and burns just a little bit as it goes down."
"d- With less carbonation and less alcohol and a smaller container, this might be a Bud-Lite weak beer that at least serves as summer refreshment. Here, we have a not-very-enjoyable beer, whose primary mission seems to be intoxication for 99 cents."
"Stay away from this even if it is high gravity"
"Thanks to Pegasus for the sample."
"Ok seriously I had to. There was a forty of this on sale at the local gas sattion for a buck, cmon how can you pass that up, espeially when you have already had a long night. This review is gonna be messy I know it but what the hell right. Poured a dull orange straw color with no head and no lace. A decenr amount of of caronation coming up from the bottom. Smell was light grain and cornwith a touh of alcohol, not impressed, but was I expecting to be. Taste was rather bland as well, just a grainey malty cheap mess. Overall cmon man what do you expext. This was prety mch a forty, funny."
"D: Not a bad macro, this will get you drunk in a hurry, but try to keep it cold, opposite of what I would say about most high alcohol brews."
"Pours a medium yellow color with a nice amount of carbonation. Smells of corn adjunct with alcohol mixed in. Nothing impressive there. Typical malt liquor. Sweet smell by the way. Taste is much of the same except that it feels too thin to be good. Also, the sweetness is almost too much"
"Drinkability is smooth, not to hindering. Easy to drink with a meal but watch thisone. The can is big & as is the abv. The price is good and easy to go to far to quickly."
"Malt liquors like this really make me question why they put them in 16, 24, & 40 oz containers.. this would be absolutely awful if not ice cold. Thank God there's Alpha King in my fridge that can help me remove this vile taste from my mouth."
"D - Pretty damn good. My favorite ""high gravity malt liqour so far."""
"I first tried this beer out of curiosity. I was pleasantly surprised. For the money, it is probably one of the best cans of beer you can buy. I usually go for the ICE beers, and this is considerably better than those. I recommend that you give it a try, and the quick buzz never hurt either!!!"
"I wont be drinking this one again."
"Bought this can at the local gas station. This beer poured fairly well with a nice amber orange hue. For a cheap lager it looked good. Smell was corn with a bit of pepper. The taste was as it smelled, lot's of corn. I could not finish this beer and as it got warmer drinkability got worse."
" Bottom Line, if you need a bit of a pick me up, had a bad day at work, and/or low on cash, this is your beer of choice. Although it's it's not much for taste."
"When you're broke and need to get pissed, grab a hurricane!"
"So, I rate it high among beers meant to do what beers are really meant to do."
"Can't beat $1.25 for 24oz can. Pours an orange color different from your usual lager. Smells like cheap lager. Tastes like crappy malt liquor, grainy, corn like, corn syrup and fusel alcohol. Mouthfeel is like water. If you need a buzz go for it, or if your poor sure why not. Otherwise it's not worth your time or attention."
"D - Not too bad. There are better malt liquor options, but the high gravity world require a less descerning palate. Not good for food. This is a crunk beer and nothing more."
"I haven't yet granted the scores, but it's apparent that Hurricane High Gravity has blown itself out in trying to topple Four O. The direction that A-B chose to take with this particular malt liquor is not the direction that I prefer my malt liquors to take. This one is best avoided."
"Golden color, nice white head, actually leaves some lacing. Some corn and grain noticed in the smell, even some banana maybe, and a small hop presence. Taste starts out fairly clean but has a grainy and floral finish. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. I really expected this to suck, but I'm glad I tried it, it's actually alright. This could get dangerous considering what you get for the price."
"As easy as Hurricane H-G drinks I can see how it could create some serious problems for those who don't respect alcohol."
"Hurrican High Gravity Lager came in a sixteen ounce can, it pours a clear orange with a white head. Smell is okay, particularly for a malt liquor. Mild, maybe a little sweetness in the aroma. Taste is definitely sweet, much more so than I expected. Finish is inoffensive, some corn, some alcohol. Better than many malt liquors."
"Overall: A purty strong malt liquor plenty of bang for the buck. Unfortunately, I believe it is the worst ""beer"" I've ever tasted. Avoid."
"Appearance: 24oz can High Gravity another malt liquor during our sampling of varietal malt liquors, appears pale golden white head dwindles quickly leaves specks of lacing not too apetizing. Aroma: Chemical mix of alcohol corn and rice adjunct ridden tones with some creamed corn sweetness and evident alcohol at 8.1%. Taste: Cleaner in flavor than the last Camo consumed flows down with a touch of bitterness and corn and rice sweetness with alcohol being a dominant component of the flavor profile. Mouthfeel: Carbonation is a bit high body light-medium coats the palate with a layer of chemical lacquer. Drinkability: Well, not as bad as the worst malt liquor goes down with somewhat of a rough viscosity."
"Bought this and a King Cobra at a little convenience store in NC (hey, popping the cap meant this stuff would be available, too) on the way home from spring break. I think the bill with tax was $2.20."
"It is what it is."
"It's a lot better than the standard ""Hurricane", but I still feel it falls short of the mark. It seems AB is going for a sharper, less 'flabby' malt character, but without that overly sweet maltiness the alcohol is just a little too apparent."
"Not really that bad for the style. Worth the money in my opinion."
"for malt liquors, i prefer mickey's...but in the HG category, this one has become probably the best i've tried....too bad for me. ;)"
"The mouthfeel was about the only thing that was decent about this malt beverage...kind of creamy with a fair bit of body, the sweet after taste made me NOT enjoy this brew. One's too much for my likes, can't recommend..."
"D- Perhaps one of the best malt liquors out there, no real astringent qualities to this at all ... certainly the cleanest malt liquor I have ever tasted. Went great with some homemade spinach dip and ritz crackers."
"The little lady is always complaining about how much I spend on beer. And to be honest, some of the beers I buy are $10 for the 750 ml corked bottle. So, quite often, I'll bring home a case of this beer in 24 oz. cans, total cost, $16.50 for 15 cans. At 8.1% abv. thats a lotta bang for the buck. Sure it reeks of corn, but it is surprisingly drinkable, especially if you finish it before it gets warm. I think of it as Bud squared. No really, it is a ton better than the malt liquour we grew up with."
"This beer pours a darkish, clear yellow color, with a 1 inch head that dissipates quickly. It looks like the urine of a person who is sick with hepatitis or cirrhosis(I used to work in a hospital). The smell is awful, like chemicals, corn and adjuncts. The taste is actually not too bad, sweet with a very slight malt taste and alcohol burn going down the throat. It tastes basically like a souped up macro lager. The reason I'm reviewing this malt liquor is because they recently started showing up in stores here in NC and I wanted to try a few just for the hell of it. I think my money would be better spent on some craft beer instead. I'll leave this stuff to the dudes hanging out on the street corner."
"Drink the worst beers first just to get them out of the way. It pours okay, light piss yellow with a fair head that doesn't die. The smell is, oh my god, sweet like Camo tastes, so gross. The taste is bad at best, sorta, not really sweet with a strong bitter taste that rounds it out, but try chugging and that old sweet taste rears its head. BARF! The mouthfeel is terrible- watery with carbonation that coats your mouth. With this taste and mouthfeel you know the drinkability is going to be shitty. There are much better malt liquors out there. Best case scenario this is an alternative to the Camos."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a thick white head that dissipates to nothing in a hurry. It smells of corn and other sweet, crappy adjuncts. The taste is sweet and malty, also kind of corny. Overall its pretty crappy tasting, but compared to a lot of other malt liquors, this one is part of the better half. Mouthfeel is thin and easy, Drinkability is decent, better than a lot of other crappy cheap beers."
"As for drinkability: for what it is, which is a cheap malt liquor, it's good. If you aren't already a malt liquor fan then I'd say go elsewhere, but if you are then this could displace something already in your rotation. I'm serious."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Benji wrinkled his nose and took off after one taste. Peaches wouldn't touch it. Good call on their part."
"Oddly enoughm probably the best brew I have had from Anheuser-Busch. And I definitely felt the power."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-four ounce aluminum can, served in a Pilsener glass. Born on date is August 6, 2005."
"OK in the drinkability department. I can't say I would seek this out but if the choice is this or Budweiser I would pick this."
"Hurricane High Gravity Lager with its eye pleasing colour and a good head of foam complete with lacing plus the 8.1% alcohol by volume will win some beer drinkers over to the HGL side... but its once around the block for me."
"Wow, this one caught me off guard. I thought it was going to be another awfull malt liquor but it turned out to be not half bad. The pour was decent with a nice frothy white head that lasted till the end and the beer had a decent light amber color. The smell was pure grain and dingy malt as to be expected. But the taste was decent for a malt liquor....it had a very sweet malty front then it moved into a slightly grainy middle and finished with lingering sweetness that was quite agreeable for a malt liquor. If you want a smoothe malt liquor that is not half bad, take a stab at this one."
