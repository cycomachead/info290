"O: I'm cracking up as I write this, but this, behind Old E, has gotta be my 2nd favorite malt liquor... dude, it's really not that bad if you pour it into a fat-bottomed glass - it's the can or the bottle that makes it nasty, no?... the high alcohol content lends some 'complexity' to the flavor, but the balance here is sick"

"O - The 22 has the same alcohol as three regular beers and gets the job done. Frankly there are times I'd rather have a DD of this than 3 crummy AAL's. A 40 of this stuff is a ticket to a quick night. Still, for what it is it isn't ""bad"" but don't get me wrong; it's still a long way from ""good"" too. This stuff is only for the experienced and the adventurous."

"I won't go into a thorough review here.. keep it cold and drink it fast and be prepared to get messed up lol.. in a league of other Malt Liquors the Ides will hold it down as they say lol.. not the worst tasting brew out there but far from good.. if your trying to get a nice buzz or kick going for the cheap and want something ok tasting for the power behind it and dollar value then it's St Ides.. Been drinking it on and off for over 10 years now.. it never fails to get me messed for the price tag and hell remember it's got a following behind it too in the celebrity world like 2 Pac, Ice Cube, Snoop Dog, Mike Tyson lol..."
"Overall – A rather average but drinkable malt that gets the job done. Cheap it is, strong it is, and rather fast drinking it is. If this is what you want then I say go for it, but if looking for something with a bit more flavor/complexity then this may not be your choice."

"My second favorite AML behind Steel reserve. Heavy corn adjunct smell and taste, yet very palatable for a cheap high gravity malt liquor as long as you don't let it get too warm. Actually a nice hops balance and not overly sweet. Did a 40 hands with this and forgot what planet i was on, all for less that $5."

"Overall, I would highly recommend this brew to anyone who needs to get a great buzz going on a budget. It is by far the most economical beverage I have seen (although Big Bear and Natty Daddy are close up there.) The taste is pretty decent. I suggest drinking this outside in the winter for premium flavor."

"O- it lives up to the hype, but only if you can find it extremely unfresh"

"O - I have to Bow Down to this malt liquor. It'll make you Check Yo Self. You don't have to be Men of Steel or Natural Born Killaz to enjoy this beer. Stay True to the Game and You Can Do It. All you have to do is Do Ya Thang. Really Doe."

"I'm sure I've said it before but this is levels above the mainstream macro lagers in refinement and drinkability. Cheers!"
""
"Ides does it right, however. At 8.2%, you get feeling good quickly and at a budget price!"
"I didn't look much at this since I really didn't care what it looked like, as most would agree. It's beer-colored. It smelled like sweet bad strong beer, which can be o.k. Sometimes. I must say the flavor forced me to end the experience quickly, which was also a o.k. Overall it gets you drunk, and quick. Don't worry, nobody takes it seriously."

"Overall Drinkability - Even for someone looking for a nice small buzz, this has a chance of being a drain pour. Definitely not a tasting or session beer. Avoid."

"Well, beer doesnt' taste great but there is no aftertaste, tastes almost like nothing, mildly dry finish. Lead off is a mild sweetness, some alcohol, but the finish is nice actually. I don't hate it, I doubt I'd have it again but it is not poison, which is pretty good for the style. Nice."
"Sweetened corn syrup like taste, mixed with solvent or industrial cleaner/fluid. Gasoline breath afterwards. Plenty of carbonation in the mouthfeel. Not watery, but bad tasting. Like they put a shot of vodka & a shot of gasoline together with sugar packets."
"Considering it is a cheap malt liquor, I would give the appearance and aroma of this a 9 out of 10. However, I would give the taste a 3 out of 10."
"The pour was better then I thought with a medium amber color and a head of about two inches that stuck around for a few moments before falling into the same path as the others with a crystal clear, dark color with tiny strings of bubbles that were coming up through the glass. Aroma is of corn, alcohol, wet hay, and just a mess. Really just astringent and not very appetizing at all. Every sip seemed to bring a similar reaction from me as I struggled to get this one down before finally pouring the rest out. Just not a redeeming quality as far as taste, and I generally do not mind the style terribly, but this was atrocious."
"D: This was just awful. This one, I am glad I cannot purchase readily in California. Just to reiterate: awful."
"RJT"
"Having consumed Natural Light before, as well as Miller and Bud, and even OE and Colt 45, this is by far the worst beer I have ever tried. Probably also the quickest way to get drunk on beer."
"When I drink this it makes me feel weird. For around 3 dollars a bottle, St. Ides HG malt liquor gives perhaps the best bang for its buck as far as experience. Interesting label; no smell; good taste; excellent drinkability; and the most unique feeling from ghetto swill you will ever experience."
"Taste is most certainly alcoholic fruitiness, but there is a pretty stable backbone of cereal grains in there. Not as bad as I had feared. Clean finish with not alot of sweetness that lingers. Pretty good job of making a high ABV, light bodied lager and still be drinkable. I dont exactly like it, but I think I will be able to finish this can...barely."
"i used to drink this beer all the time when i was young LoL and have friends that still do.i think this beer is good if you need alittle liqiud courage or for a poor mans viagra.i dont know what they put in this stuff but if you just want to get drunk its cheap and works."
"From a clear 22 oz. bottle. Pours a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malt and corn. Taste is rather yucky. Flavors of corn and alcohol. Not very pleasent in the mouth either. Drinkability is also low. Not much to recomend about this beer."
"Ah St. Ides High Gravity Malt Liquor; the last beer that did me in...made me hug the toilet...and caused me to pass out. And that was ages ago. I have not touched it since but I figured it was time to rate it so I had to twist off the top and dive in. It was unimpressive then and it is unimpressive now. It pours yellow with about two fingers of bubbly, white head and decent clarity. It looks like it is supposed to so I rate it average. The aroma emits a scent of corn, malts, and strong alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit better than water but still pretty weak. It tastes like a sour, metallic shot of alcohol and leaves a bad aftertaste. It is a cheap way to get a buzz if that is what you are in the mood to do."
"Drain poured most of it."
"Taste: Imagine dropping a shot or two of everclear into a Busch Beer. Adjuncts and alcohol. Nothing repulsive in my opinion, but theres nothing good to talk about either."
"For me, there has to be some kind of pleasure in drinking the beer. Serving it nearly frozen to mask flavor and smell, then shotgunning it, doesn't cut it for me. Id like to know the beer I'm drinking is actually reasonable, and drinkable. Not recommended, try another Malt Liquor to get messed up on."
"Overall, the beer was about as error-free as can be expected from a malt liquor. But the beer has a lot of voids where the characterful flavors should be. Not a particularly recommended beer, but servicable in a pinch... a seriously bad pinch."
"Not the greatest tasting malt beverage but it can surely deal you a quick buzz. Tastes like rubbing alcohol with a slight hint of grain. Pours out in a slick pale amber color, mild carbonation and little taste of good old American hops. Slides down the throat easy enough, as do most malt liquors, but the lack of good beer taste damages this one's appeal"
"The taste is alcohol, sweet, cheap white wine, with ghosty elements of white grape juice and stale corn, with a brief, alcoholic finish and almost no aftertaste. It is very bland after the first sip"
"For whatever reason, I am partial to malt liquor. St. Ides is defintely not one of my favorites. It should be, I like high gravity malts from time to time, but this malt makes me feel weird when I drink it. It starts off with a pungent first sip, and by the time I reach the label on the 40 I think 'hey, this stuff is not so bad, but the minute this brew warms up it takes on a harsh-metallic character. This beer makes me feel nauseated... no thanks St. Ides"
"The nice thing about these macros is their head. I produced a solid two fingers' worth of dense, bone-white head with excellent retention off of the pour. The nose, on the other hand, smelled like liquid death. It smelled like a can of gasoline left out to near its flash point. Fusel alcohol to the max! Oof. The color was another winner. It had a beautiful shade of golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel reminded me of the last scene in ""What We Do Is Secret"" when Darby Crash realizes that he's gone a bit too far, but there is no turning back from the inevitable. His was a heroin overdose, mine was a stomach-wrenching sensation followed by a strange mellowness and a desire for another hit, I mean, swig. Powerful stuff. This was no playing around, certainly not meant for amateurs, and even I as a seasoned veteran could not wrap my liver around this beast. Avoid, boy! Avoid ... Aaarrrggh."
"Pretty standard for a malt liquor..."
"This is a drink that surely thrives on underage drinkers getting dumb adults to purchase it with the last 20$ they had. It is a harsh raunchy smell, with a fizzy spoiled fruit flavor. they taste is no improvement this is no beer and if you cant count hard ciders malt beverages should be no different. its a wine cooler after it went on a bender and got hung over."
"D-This beer is not as wretched as I had suspected,I guess it is what it is, a powerful swill at a low price.Not completely devoid of flavor but bland."
"Presentation, 40 oz. bottle, little foam in the bottle. Typical 40 oz. malt liquor. Smell metalic, alcohol, and sugary. It takes like a normal malt liquor, full of alcohol and various other flavors such as numerous grains. St. Ides has a little sugary tastes, makes it sweeter than others. Mouthfeel not that bad and not that good either. Drinkability, nothing that horrible about St. Ides, but mine tasted a little od. Other than that nothing that special and nothing that bad."
"A reminder of what some companies/Brewers will produce and call a beer."
"Nasty yellowish color with a bubbly tan head. Looks to have a higher carbonation than average. Smells like alcohol and bad malt. The taste is badly bitter with some old cut grass in there. It has a syrupy yet heavily carbonated body. Perhaps drinkable if you are too drunk to taste anything."
"I can't fully give this malt liquor it justice because this review is on VIVID memory. I can't even bring myself to spend the buck to sample it and throw it away. I drank A LOT of these in college, and it is also my wife's first memory of me. She walked into the house (w/ her friends at a house party) and saw me sitting on the couch drinking a St Ides (she always tells the story that I was holding it at my crotch like some giant phallic symbol). I remember this being really sweet compared to other malt liquors; real sugary. I also remember the dark gold hue in the bottle let you know that this wasn't watered down. There were also hints of fruit or berries, and I use to be able to down these with the best of them. Not anymore."
"D- I can drink one of these, anymore than that would probably be overkill for me but then again I am a lightweight."
"To its credit, it hides the alcohol extremely well. It has an impressive head considering the majority of its audience will not see it. The body is slightly sticky but is probably at the optimal point for the style. Serves its purpose but not much else."
"and your brain be sizzlin'"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a thin body and is super carbonated. The beer is not gag inducing but it isnt good. This is an acceptable vehicle to deliver 8% alcohol. This beer should be served cold and from the can. Drink this one fast."
"so um ok...appearance was semi nothing...it poured a very light clear color and the can it came in looked like the cover for some lame japanese cartoon...the smell was not apparent at all i tried so hard that i managed to inhale some of it through my nose...i wouldnt recomend that...it stings...so yea moving on the taste was not very apparent either, carbination and a water-esque taste with a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel wasnt much better than the rest of it. The mouthfell was very watery and carbonated. Drinkability was a 2 and thats only if you wanna get smashed on a low budget."
"For the amount of alcohol in this, it is quite easy to drink. Classic malt liquor flavor (probably my idea of the perfect malt flavor) combined with excellent carbonation. Superior holding strength on the flavor. Even when it warms up it is drinkable. Nothing offensive at all about this high gravity. In fact, you'll be more offensive after finishing a 40 of this. Quite possibly the best high gravity malt liquor out there."
"next day - my stomach feels like there's a knot inside it - i had the worst craps ever - no mas... ever!"
"D - Poor. The little that I had was hard to handle."
"Overall it's not a bad malt liquor - it's clean and somewhat balanced with a big maltiness upfront; and then a lot of kick behind. Not great, but OK."
"Drinkabilty...no thank-you, definitely not for me !"
"The can depicts a pretty effin' viscious wrotweiller biting into a 24oz. can of this stuff, you'd think he'd know better. Well, I can't lie early on in my drinking days I used to imbibe on the St. Ides Special Brews (original alcohol pops) leave me the hell alone Snoop used to sing in their commercials what do you expect from a thug rap loving eighth grader. Anyways on to the high gravity version of this malt liquor it appears a bright golden yellow hue with a vibrant white head leaves fine even lacing as the thick head dwindles pretty quickly. Aromatics...well I can't say this is any type of a beer delicacy very heavy on corn and rice along with alcohol in the aroma not good at all sweet smelling overall I guess. Taste...wow possibly the worst beer or malt liquor I've ever tasted I compare this one to paint thinner toned flavors with very sweet and alcoholic tones hitting you at once seems chemical as a whole no hop profile to be had just pure shit, awwgh cloyingly sweet with a slight metallic layer on the tongue and alcohol remains horrible. Mouthfeel fizzy textured heavy carbonation definitely could cause a gag reflex to occur on the typical drinker. Drinkability don't even rate this brew as an option to grab onto I was in a ghetto liquor malt and grabbed one for fun 99cents well the experiment is over this shit is horrible."
"I don't think I've ever had this stuff before, may never again, but supposidly this is the king of ghetto juice. Pours a brownish golden color, no head. Smells a bit sweet, like corn syrup. Taste is quite skunky, high alcohol, like paint thinner and corn syrup. Mouthfeel sucks. Overall it's what you expect, and worse. I've had better 40's before, this ain't one of them. I will now attempt to finish it."
"Cheers!"
"Tastes sweet malty to start, then funky (funk gives me the willies). It's not a phenoilic belgian funk, it's more like a strong version of the hint of funk I find in Oktoberfests. The beer is dry and there is a bit of sweet fruity ester in there. Canned pear syrup, I guess. Md light body and highly carbonated. No thanks."
"This beer poured a golden straw color that was crystal clear and very well carbonated. The head that was produced was very large and pure white in color, very think in appearance somewhat sticky and pillowy, it fell rather quick and left a ring around the edges and some light tiny carbonation bubbles on the surface. There was a sticky lace on the sides of the glass. The aroma was simple, cooked corn, grains, some hints of malt and alcohol. The taste had a carbonation bite to it, hints of light malts, some bitterness, lots of cooked watery corn, waves of alcohol were all through the taste, sometimes bitter, sometimes semi sweet, but the constant was alcohol. The body was medium. This beer has lots of alcohol, and once you get by the first few swallows and that corn taste, it is not a bad beer. A good beer if you want a good buzz - cheap. Not to shabby for its style."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 40 ounce clear glass bottle with a screw cap, served in a Pilsener glass."
"For a 40, it could be worse. Your typical malt beverage orange color, not much head to speak of. Smells a little rancid but you can tell there's actually some toasted malt in there, or some sort of cheap immitaion malt or someting, I don't know how they do it and I don't really care. Taste is a little less pukey than the smell, but really isn't appetizing. My friends convinced me to pound this big boy last night and on one other occasion this summer, and both times I've woken up extremely hung over. This stuff is bad for you. Only drink it if you're in 9th grade. Word."
"Pours gold with a thick 3 finger head that slowly evaporates with little to no lacing. The only thing to say about taste and smell is overpowering cider. If not for the that, it might have a decent mouthfeel and drinkabilty, suprisingly smooth for the high gravity. If you like your cheap buzz drowned in ester, this is the best $1.79 you can spend."
"taste was grainy with a lemon hint. the alcohol was present and left a slight burn in the throat and chest. problem is at first tase it wasn;t bad but as you drink this beer it seems to get worse. It was creamy and light in the mouth and fairly drinkable."
"Clear 40 oz. bottle. Straw yellow in color, with lots of visible carbonation when opened. Smell is of Corny skunk and a large dose of alcohol. Taste is really dominated by the high amount of alcohol and the cheap ingredients that were used to brew this swill (That is actually kind of insulting to swine). A cheap buzz, for sure, but will leave you hungover without fail."
"Overall-Quite possibly the worst malt liquor I've ever had. Although 2Pac was a great artist he could have had better choice in beer, even malt liquor for that matter."
"Picked this up in New Orleans just to try something new. As with any malt liquor worth it's salt this was consumed in a clear 40 oz. Color is macro yellow with a medium fizzy head. Appearance is a little better than some of the malt liquors I've had. Smell is a sweeter variation of what is usually expected from adjuncts. This is the sweetest tasting malt liquor I've had. The taste is okay at first, but the sweetness becomes a little too much after a while. Overall, I consider this average for a malt liquor, it could be better or a lot worse."
" Basically, if you're in the market for malt liquor, this is one of the better ones. If you're in the market for actual beer, you wouldn't have read this review. Now spill some for the homies that aint with us no mo' ..."
"Good Lord, this stuff is something else. Poured out with little head, and had a strong scent of alcohol and sugar. The brew was far too sweet for me and left me hung over less than an hour and a half later. I would go with any other malt liquor unless you are looking for a reason to get a headache."
"Pretty darn good for a malt liqour. It has a straw color that pours with a nice creamy head that has decent staying power. It smells of mostly corn and adjuncts. The taste is initially good and smooth but quickly has some bite to it. The mouthfeel is slightly over carbonated but its nothing to be concerned about. It has good drinkability and is great for getting drunk on due to the high alcohol content. I don't care for many malt liqours but I will probably get this one again for when I want to get drunk."
"I have a 40 sitting here in front of me and it has a mediocre taste and I doubt very much that I will finish it...but not because of the taste, which is passable...for me, its the ABV that kills this product( I can feel the headache starting already)...Bottom line is nice buzz for the price...but no thanks..."
"I have no need to drink it again."
"Starts with a soft malt then changes to a not too unpleasant sweet corn that is just a bit sticky. Aftertaste is mostly silky alcohol overtones. I have been through some real brewing alchemists nightmares, thankfully St. Ides was not one of them."
"as far as malt liquors go, this one is not too bad.  poured in a glass, it looks great... dark gold, nice big foamy head.  it doesn't have too much of the obnoxious adjunct aroma that other high gravity brews have either.  it tasted pretty sweet also,  which makes it slide down rather smoothly.  there is nothing too harsh about this malt liquor other than the alcohol presence, but what the hell do you drink malt liquors for anyway?   if you like your buzzmaker sweet and smooth, st. ides is the ticket.  otherwise drink at your own discretion, and give your car keys to someone sane."
"Golden straw, almost no head. Moderate carbonation.  Smells sweet with hint of alcohol and cooked corn.  Somewhat malty with weak hop bitterness that doesn't take your attention away from the fact that this beer tastes like stale corn on the cob.  Spicy alochol quality.  Decent to get drunk, not a good sippin brew."
"Not the best malt liquor, but does the trick...will eventually throw you on the ground, kick you a few times, then pee all over you. Exactly what a good malt liquor should do."
"Notes: High octane brew, aimed for people that want a quick and ugly buzz. Pretty damn good for what you would expect in a Malt Liquor. Not bad at $1.25 a pop … but remember you get what you pay for."
