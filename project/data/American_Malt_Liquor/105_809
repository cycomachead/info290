It is just as a malt liquor should be; cheap, adjunct to hell and with just enough hops to provide a level of bitterness and contrast to the beer that its noticeable but definitely not enough to break the brewers bank. The overall result is a very sweet and enjoyable malt liquor that really finishes clean and has an enjoyable taste but really is nothing special for the price but will definitely quench your thirst and give you the budget buzz you were looking for. Wish I could rate it higher but Country Club XXX and King Cobra had more going on then this malt liquor. Would recommend if you cant afford Old E 800 or if your store doesn't have Genesee at the very least, but not bad for the price and much better then Hurricane or Steel Reserve!","MRHviolin16","Oct 01, 2013"

HAHA”. Keeping it classy. Served from 24 oz can into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass (have to try to class it up some). Poured a golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, corn, grain, and sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, corn, sugar, alcohol, and water. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty bad brew. I have to say that this was a pretty nice looking brew. But I knew not to judge a book by its cover here as this brew likely had a hidden side. Boy was I right on that one…. The aroma was not that great on this one as there was a fairly large sugary aspect going on with it. The flavor was more of the same with more dilution. As a previous review said this was very mild and it being in a can format would make it fun to shotgun at a college frat party (believe me, I was there once). Another tick from the Bottom of the Barrel list with plenty more to go.","thagr81us","Sep 15, 2012"

Danger, Woody Robinson, danger! Warning, warning! One sniff and I was pulled out of my afternoon reverie. A bag of Fritos smells less like corn than this gem. Holy awful, Batman! Mouthfeel was medium with a heat on the tongue that full-on got my attention. Oh me, oh my, oh shit, oh dear. My brain felt like it was being cooked in the shell and my eyes were beginning to alternately bug out and roll back. No wonder the down-and-out crowd looks the way that they do, if this is a standard on the menu. Jesus, but I want to ram my head through a wall just to make the voices shut up for a f**king millisecond! I hear them all the time, but never as loudly or as clearly as I do with this winner. A previous reviewer mentioned giving money to the unfortunates who may be drinking this on the street. Hell, this makes me want to tithe. Woody at Lee Ermey the therapist's office: ""Magnum 40 really makes me sad."" L. E.: ""That's very interesting. You know what makes me sad, you squiddly diddly piece of dung?!? This beer! Let's go get a craft beer and tell some sea stories."" Yeah, man, after this, I was ready for a beer.

Because of the lack of taste, I guess it could go with anything, but would not add to the dining experience or enhance any other flavors. It is wet, and will quench your thirst when coming in from heavy yard work, and yes it will give you a buzz, but if you are looking for flavor, look somewhere else.

3,52.3,2,2,3,4,4,"Magnum really isn't that bad, because it really doesn't have that much flavor. Smell and taste are fleeting, and the color is about what you would expect out of a beer called Magnum 40. The mouth feel is pretty good and when ice cold very easy to drink.","jose","Nov 24, 2006"
2.85,44.7,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Poured a pale yellow color with a puffy white head that was quickly vanished. Smell is very minimal with only a generic sweetish beer aroma. Taste is also sweet, but very restrained. Finishes refreshing when ice cold, but starts to lose its acceptance as it slowly warms. The 40 ounce bottle is best to share with friends so that it stays cold before being finished. Drinkable.","tgbljb","Feb 24, 2006"
2.57,30.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Magnum 40 is a prototypical malt liquor. Venomous reptile or firearm reference? Check. Bad ass bottle/can with a predominantly black color scheme? Check. Lightly sweet and high enough in alcohol to get you reelin' with the feelin' in no time at all? Check mate. I kinda like it though. If you're in the mood or if you're tight on cash, you could do much worse than this.","BuckeyeNation","Mar 19, 2005"

2.68,36,2.5,2,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Honestly, I didn't mind this 40 oz. too much, it isn't a good beer, but it could have been a lot worse. Appearance is fairly dark for a malt liquor, not great looking, but usually they appear a little more watery. Smell is adjunct, same as about all other macros. Taste is smooth, with a nice, mildly sweet finish. Never did I taste the alcohol in this one. Overall, this is a fairly drinkable beer, and above average for a macro malt liquor. Not something I'd buy for a craft session, but occaisionally a malt liquor feels right.","Gagnonsux","Jul 21, 2004"
2.11,7.1,3,2,2,2.5,2,"Drinkability/notes: Its hard to be disappointed with this beer, because it is so inexpensive. I paid $1.59 plus tax for a 40-ounce bottle. Even as a poor quality beer, it is a good value for the money and a better value than many of the American macros. If you invest $2.00 in this beer and have reasonable expectations, it is at least decent, although there are far better malt liquors to be had.","Pegasus","Apr 03, 2004"

2,1.5,2,2,2,2,2,"I think the only reason that I am even rating this beer slightly high for a malt liquor is due primarily to the fact that it is extremely cheap, and actually isn't too bad.

2.76,40.1,3,2,3,3,3,"Clear yellow hue. Minimal animation. Smallish brilliant white head, bubbly and underdeveloped. Fair retention. The nose is strongly sweet and alcoholic definitely polluted with adjuncts. Not inviting. The palate is surprisingly clean slightly sweet, kind of creamy similar to creamed corn. The alcohol is a lot less noticeable in the taste, a major plus. The finish is short and sweet (pun intended). The complexity is minimal but the simplicity works well with this malt liquor. The carbonation is moderate, medium-light mouthfeel  very easy to drink. A solid beverage for they style, I still doubt Id drink it again. Its very cheap.","bditty187","Jul 14, 2003"
