"Pours a golden yellow with a head that falls flat almost immediately, the smell is very sharp and metallic, tangy with no aroma of hops whatsoever. The first sip was tart and crisp, almost cider-like, but this quickly turned into a sweet, cloying, sharp and metallic flavor that was almost unbearable by the end of my glass. Very cheap and adjuncty, most likely sugar with rice, no taste of corn detected and certainly no hop flavor to be found. Mouthfeel was medium thin and highly carbonated. This tasted cheap, tacky and unfortunate. Very similar in flavor to Steel Reserve or another budget American Malt Liqour. Shall not be drinking again."

"One thing: don't let this sit in your fridge for months or you'll only get the bad."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with a thin white head that is active during the pour and then dissipated quickly to a film and ring around the glass. Aroma of sweet malt and undentifiable light estery bandaid or exotic fruit, hints of banana. Flavor is almost uncategorizable, starting off all right with sweet malt, lightly grainy, but developing odd fruit and medicinal flavors. Finishes with sweet malt, with sweet adjunt components and the closest I've had to genuine bandaid in a beer. I've only had hints of this before, so it's almost endearing. Light bodied. The flavors are low key, which actually is a plus, because some of these would not be an asset in higher concentration. As it is, it kind of a very oddly flavored, amped up adjunct beer, so the malt liquor style is the best fit; American malt liquor meets odd, exotic fruits and friends. It was intriguing enough to keep me interested for a whole glass, but probably not a repeat performance."
"Overall, I enjoyed this. It was the perfect complement to the meal. I look forward to drinking this again."

"Late note: poured the last 2/3 of the bottle down the drain. Nasty stuff..."
"I have fairly low expectations of malt liquor and this strange bottle with its smiling, jowly monk on the label more or less passed them."

"Drinkability: For what it is, and I'm not really sure what it is, it's O.K. Is this really a malt liquor made in India for export to the U.S. market? How bizarre is that? And why the Belgian character? But on the other hand, if it is - it kind of works! I like it better than quite a few malt liquors out there. Technically it could be better, but so could most malt liquors."
"Poured from a brown 24 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. This was the high point for this beer. Smell had notes of plastic. Taste is very bad, plastics,sour, is that nyquil, maybe cough syrup, yuck. Feels light and blech in the mouth and is not drinkable. I was able to get through about 16 ounces of this, the rest went down the drain."
"Notes: As an Indian beer I'd say this was pretty good. As a beer in comparison to most other beers. Not very good, but still drinkable. Not the hellish experience most here made it out to be. It washed down my Indian food pretty well..."
"D- Easy drinkin'. I like it, and I'd buy one every once in a while. Nice to see malt liquor in a 22oz bottle as it's a pain in the ass to get OE in 22s around here."
"D: About as drinkable as a 211 Steele Reserve. Having a hard time putting it down, but since my brother bought it, I'm gonna finish it."
"Although not entirely unpleasant, it's difficult to finish the entire bottle of this one. Not going to be buying this again. This beer shouldn't be allowed to have a monk on it; Belgian monks would rather drink their own... well you know, than drink this beer."
"D: By style, drinkability was below average, there just enough reason to drink this in multiples and have to say I struggled through half a bomber before I threw in the towel. This actually made me respect their other beer ""Golden Eagle"" a bit more, and isn't an easy thing to do. Epic fail."
"After drinking this beer, I'm pretty sure I bought the Indian equivalent of Hurricane high gravity malt liquor. The beer is generally as per usual for the style, but there is some really odd aftertaste. I'm hoping that it is the attempt to have a belgian-y yeast flavor, though I can imagine it may be worse things. Not a beverage I would procure again"
"Any thing that says it is a super beer gets a try, i mean seriously ""Super Beer", that is so tough and mean sounding that I need it. But back to reality, this beer poured and looked good, but like most well traveled beers, it ended up tangy and pooh'ey. It has an odd fruity tangy taste to it that could either be honey or ""super"" juice. I can't say I could finish it, it was odd, at 8% and living in oakland I have better choices and maybe a hooker will hit on me when I buy one of them. Sorry India, next time I go and grab some roti, i'm going with something else."
"Who can resist a beer with 10,000 SUPER BEER on the label."
"Visually it is very nice. A clear golden amber with a thick head. But it fizzes out quickly. It smells like a copper penny. Oh, god. The flavor. A copper penny soaked in some sort of medicine. Or maybe floor cleaner. It leaves a fantastic metallic taste on the tongue. And alcohol. 8% never tastes so strong. Reading a couple of other reviews, I figured out what it tastes like. A wet band aid. Seriously. It's a very cheap malt liquor. I guess I'll have to try Old English and compare. But right now I'm pouring this out."
"Appearance pours a light golden with a quick dissipating crisp head. Smell of sweet grains. Taste is like a smoked malt liquor with sweet grainy adjuncts and mild hops. Mouthfeel is light, but with some body to it and good carbonation. It's kind of a unigue twist on a malt liquor, not good, not bad, just different."
"Avoid this and in general, avoid Indian lagers over 5% abv. Skip this and grab a Kingfisher or Dansberg instead. While nothing special, they're much better than this stuff."
"The aroma is terrible, some malts in the background, but it's mostly a band-aid medicinal taste. The flavor isn't much better. The malts come through a little more, but the medicinal taste is overpowering. The mouthfeel is dry and pleasant. I could only drink enough to complete this review. The rest of the 22oz bottle is going down the drain."
"Drink: If you can enjoy the strange but different burnt flavors, it's no hassle to drink it. High alcohol and a lack of complexity would make it hard to down more than one I imagine."
"My gut reaction is that this must be India's answer to OE800. It pours golden-yellow with adequate clarity and a bubbly, short-lived head. Its appearance was probably its best feature. The aroma is a somewhat offensive burnt bread and stale malts mixture. The taste also has a kind of stale malts flavor and it almost tastes like it was there to cover up the obvious alcohol content. This was a difficult beer to finish but I did because I am too much of a cheapskate to pour it down the drain."
"""For sale in U.S.A. country only."" This has got to be some cruel joke..."
"Drinkability? I poured it after half a glass. It really doesn't taste much like a beer, more like a soda. And at 8% I fell like this beer's only purpose is to get drunk. Strong and sweet and so goes down pretty easy, but I don't want it."
"I had from bottle at Flavor of India in Santa Barb CA. Poured a yellow fizzy like an lager does, head was thin and bubbly and dissipated quickly. Nice ABV that wa snot overpowering and right for the beer. It has some fruit flavors to it. Most complex ""macro"" I have had in a long time if not ever."
"Pours a three finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Maybe a sweet nose. Flavor is sweet but hops are trying to balance, menthol in the background. $3.45 for a 650ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"The taste is similarly strong in sweet, fermented fruit and vegetable, a faintly smokey, meaty, spicy alcoholic quality similar to Steel Reserve. It's fairly drinkable and interesting."
"D- Poor. The only way to salvage the rest of the bottle is to pair it with something very, very spicy that will numb my taste buds. I'm making some spicy Mexican rice that should do the trick."
"Overall, I would say that this is not a beer that is best drank on its own. With the savory nature of Indian food, it seems to be a bit nicer. The sweetness is balanced out better in conjunction with a nice curry."
"Whatever."
" Mouthfeel isn't too bad for this style of beer, but still isn't exactly a particularly pleasant experience. A bit creamy, but more foamy if you aren't careful. Although not entirely unpleasant, it's difficult to finish the entire bottle of this one. Not going to be buying this again."
"I know I'll never be able to repay Genaro for this ""gift", so I'll just set his car on fire."
"Computer Says No!"
"The bar tender at an Indian restaurant recommended this when I asked if they had any dark beers. They didn't, but he seemed to think this came closest. In fact it was just yellow. I poured the beer myself. The head was thin and bubbly and dissipated quickly. There looked to be lots of carbonation, but the mouthfeel was not fizzy. The smell was strong alcohol and very sweet. The taste was also very sweet and strong alcohol. The bottle says 8% but the alcohol taste was even stronger. After drinking a pint, I also felt like I had had more than one pint of 8% beer. The bottle says it is a beer for beer-lovers. I don't know about that, but it is for those who want a strong beer. I probably wouldn't order this beer again, but it is worth trying once for variety's sake."
"Looks a lot like an American Macro. Pale yellow with no head....very bubbly. Smells like sweet rice and corn. Tatse is not good...not sure where the whole ""super beer"" on the label comes from. Sweet and sour at the same time. I actually drank this with a friend of mine from India. He said this is what they would drink if they wanted to drunk off of beer not liquor. Take that for what it's worth. Crisp, highly carbonated mouthfeel."
"How to rate the drinkability of this is hard. Budweiser is better. I can say with confidence that this won't make you puke! Unless you were queasy before you try this and then well, you will be screwed!"
