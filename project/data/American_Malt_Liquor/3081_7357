This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger-and-a-half of white foam that dissipates rather quickly. The nose comprises bushels of corn atop a small pile of wheat and grass. It's not bad, but certainly nothing I can call "good". The taste is of perfume-y rubber (walk down the tire aisle some day...), diseased corn, and lead. Wow, I did not expect such a foul taste, especially given my sick predilection toward most malts. Damn, this is some intensely godawful shit right here. It physically hurts during and well after the stuff rampages across my tongue. Damn. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily feel. Overall, this has got to be one of the worst beers I've had in a long time.

Raw grainy nose, like unshucked corn, metal, iron notes without mineral water foundation to fall back on, some fuller bread notes, sour grapefruit rind, has a saline quality as well, nothing about it that jumps out as fruit, overall the smells don't piss you off, it just smells like generic "beer." Medium-bodied, broad-shouldered carbonation which lasts easily through the finish. Pretzels, sourdough, rye, more cooked than raw, if indistinguishable as elements, certainly makes it evident that this is a straight down the middle of the plate lager beer. Sour mixed white citrus, more iron flecks, an uptick in apricot to peach fruit, pits and skins, maybe fig. Due to the carbonation doesn't lose weight/palate presence through the finish. Old coriander powder. Without faulting it, or its place of origin, too much it falls exactly into line with expectations. You're in a cheap Indian restaurant scarfing down some vindaloo chicken and nan and this is the beer you drink there. No mystery, no failure to meet a certain threshold of quality.

Still, it's a kind of Indian equivalent to Eurolager- perhaps Hindulager?, and it's definately functional. It smells sweet and the hal finger of foam disappears quickly. The taste is malty/bready with a distinct alcohol breath lingering in the mouth. I often wonder over Indian beer names. Haywards is obviously meant to give the beer a heritage feel.

The nose displays some higher alcohols and acetaldehdye. It's not quite off-putting, but it's certainly not pleasant either. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth due to the combination of its medium/full body and fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation.

Not a very well-made beer by any means.","NeroFiddled","Beers"
2.99,8.7,2,3,3,3.5,3,"It has a negligable head, and a pale, golden color. It's not particularly carbonated, and has a sweet, alcolol smell. The taste is initially malty, and well balanced with a bitter hop finish. Soft, pleasant mouthfeel...at times grainy. Very slight warming, but the alcohol herecould be dangerous.","Suds","0"
