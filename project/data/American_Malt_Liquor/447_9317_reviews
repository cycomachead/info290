"My only advice is drink it cold, drink it fast."

"Wow, a blast from my teenage years in Florida.  I bought this on the wrong side of the tracks at a gas station in southern Virginia.  When I cracked this quart bottle the first thing I noticed was the skunky aroma.  the flavor was traditional ghetto malt liquor.  which I grew up on.  with that said, the brew was ok, but lacked carbonation to match the flavor.  not completely horrible; but you get what you expected with this beer.  A cheap buzz with little complexity."
"Could be way worse but at 2 bucks this swill is actually drinkable .. It's not a cloying malt bomb like Mickeys"
"Think of it as a palate cleanser"
"very malty taste. taste almost like a soggy paper bag or cherrios.  i miss this brew, one of my favorite 40 oz.'s   Great memories of being 21 and reckless. This has been hard to find in northern cali, but a must try, much more pleasant than the traditional 40 oz. out there."

"What can you say, if you have $1.39 and want to catch a buzz you can. It is strong and nasty at best. I once slammed 1 1/2~40oz and was wrecked, laying on across train tracks. It's nasty tasting. Very watery flavour. It gave me a hang over the next day. The beer does not stay cold on top of it."

"Cheap, moderately harsh, and associated with certain reviled demographics, this is everything I seek in a beer. Livin' high with Country Club! Pouring a pale yellow with plenty of carbonation, it comes out of the can the same way it comes out of me. The aroma is of a fine industrial quality. I take a draught and immediately notice that unnamed, cryptic harshness of mysterious origins common to all malt liquors. Not much else hits me. Are hops used in this? I don't know. Are lawn trimmings used in this? Not sure, but if so, they are used stingily so as not to impart much flavor. As I swirl it around in my facial beer receptacle, pondering on the vagaries of brewing this fine beverage, I wonder if I am tasting a faint hint of malt. But malted what? Can sorrow be malted? Perhaps not. Perhaps it was just my imagination. But the harshness returns in the finish. That much I am not imagining. Ahh, good stuff! (But seriously, if the alternative is Leffe Blonde or some such rotten skunk, I will happily drink Country Club all day.)"

"The taste is malt forward but not sharp or biting like so many malt liquors can be. It does not make me grit my teeth when I drink it. Actually it is smooth and on the sweet side. Not really dry at the end but a vague lingering bitterness. I find it to be a decent malt liquor and nowhere near as gut-clearing as others I have had."

"Hmmm, not bad. Clean and fairly crisp. It is not as sweet as most Malt Liquors and there is actually a little bit of dryness on the finish. Its on the low side ABV-wise and that probably is why it feels lighter than most of this style. I actually prefer mine in the 6-7% range, otherwise I just feel like I might as well be drinking a Coors. But I must say that of all the Malt Liquors I have had, this one tastes the lightest, most crisp and is probably the least offensive. Dare I say that I wont have much trouble finishing the bottle? Something about drinking out of a 40 oz bottle soothes the soul!"
"O: Not sure where to place this on the scale of the style. Certainly not the best. Maybe not the most offensive, but I can't think of an example that's rougher at the moment. Carbonation is too thin and not nearly sweet enough to cover-up the rough alcohol taste that is ever-more apparent as it warms up."

"O: Well, it is a typical American malt liquor, which is to say that this beer was probably never intended to be all that great. Compared to other examples of the style, it's not absolutely wretched, but it is extremely close. Actually, scratch that. It's wretched."

"Wasn't bad to have before lunch. Poured a tad of it out for Macho Man, who died the day before."
"O: It's a malt, not great, not terrible, it's cheap and efficient. Have one, it's fairly rare, but there is much better things out there."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of corn and malts. Taste is like the smell, malts with some corn and a touch of alcohol. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall not bad as far as malt liquors go."
"M/D - Mouthfeel worked, until the alcohol burn hit. Blech. Drinkability? You have to be kidding. If you want to imagine Popov vodka and bad beer, that's how drinkable it is."
"The pour produced two rocky, bone-white fingers' worth of head that fell like yesterday's snow but actually left some lacing in its wake. Color was a golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose really left something to be desired - it was at once metallic, fusel, grapey, cereal sweet, like the worst of everything blended together into a hot mess. Yow! Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was not as unpleasant as the nose led me to expect. It was sweet, sure, but the alcohol was not up front making it bearable. Finish was also slightly sweet but not unbearable. I was left bemused by the whole thing. If this is what I missed out on in my youth, I did not miss much."
"An interesting buy, but I'll stick to OE when I'm in the mood for a 40."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - In a way this Malt was very easy to drink, but the flavors and aroma quickly get old, if not sickening, as they did with me. To me, it tasted like a really bad American Adjunct Lager, and there wasn't even any classic Malt Liquor flavors. I enjoy Malt Liquor, but this was just tiring to me, way to corny! I don't recommend this Malt at all, if your looking for something easy to drink and with a lower ABV, than Id say go with Mickeys, or King Cobra. Just not this stuff, not a fan."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The carbonation is high. The drinkability is ok as long as the beer is ice cold and drank fast."
"Ultimately a tolerable beer if you like most ice-beers. I was able to finish the foudy, but barely."
"The taste is much better, similar to a pleasant basic pale lager but with good sweet-bitter balance, decent fullness, well-rounded grain, a faint nuty hint and a light, crisp, spicey finish of apple cider, with a light alcoholic warmth and spice. It's light and smooth, but still tasty and interesting without being unpleasant."
"Cool name, and that's about it."
"Drinkability here is a bit above average. In the event that I ever want a cheap ( and seriously, it's only a damn dollar) malt beverage, this is a viable option. I'll probably get a few more."
"D: For what it is not too bad. Had not drank a 40 in a long time. I did feel dirty buying it and it was the first time I got carded in a while."
"D- Review's done. The remainder's going down the drain unless aerozeppl wants to finish it."
"ABV is unknown, but sucking down 40 ounces of this beer in 15 minutes or less gets you 'nice'."
"I remember this brew had a too-sweet taste compared to the macro-brews of the time but was satifying on a hot day as long as it remained cold."
"D- I probably will not buy this again, I might drink a glass if someone had some that was cold."
"This gave me a headache. Even for novelty's sake I won't be drinking this again."
"Could drink a lot of this if you wanted to"
"Mouthfeel is like water, and there is simply nothing to like about this. I simply amazed at how many good ratings this swill gets, but many of them seem to be drinking it from the can so maybe that is better. I supposed if you chill it down to 33 degrees so the flavor is mostly lost you could choke this down, but to me this is one of the poorest beers on the market. Good for nothing but a cheap drunk. This may be the lowest rating I have ever given. Can you get a bad bottle of a bad beer? There must be some reason why my rating is so low compared to everyone else."
"But enough history and value considerations. Onto the beer. I chose a single cold 12oz. can for this review. Unlike some other malt liquors, the Club is best in the can. You want it to be cold, very cold while you drink it, and I find the cans have a crisper taste. Has a sort of strange, corny, medichemical(?) stale beer smell. I'm finding this sample to be not nearly cold enough, as sour, off flavors invade immediately as it cools. At this point, one must go for broke and pound the fucker. It ain't going to get any better. The mouthfeel is OK, too 'fizzy' and scalds the throat like most lower-end malt liquors (yes, there is a lower end to the lower end of this beverage we call 'beer'). Tastes like cheap, folks."
"Presentation: Packaged in a forty ounce clear glass bottle with a screwtop crown, served in a Pilsener glass."
"It sure left a good headache, though."
"Overall-by far the best malt liquor I've had, even better than Colt 45, tastes like a normal lager but higher alcohol and insanely poundable. Don't drink too many of these, but at least I've finally found a decent malt liquor."
"More drinkable than you would think, flavor is mild and the adjunct flavors subdued. This is no good German Lager but it is better than a Budweiser flavor wise. If you want to try this brew DEFINATELY get the cans, the clear bottle version will be skunked like crazy."
"This has got to be one of the worst beers I have ever had. It poured a straw color yellow with a small fizzy white head that lasted a couple seconds and left no lace. The smell was just nasty and was 100% adjunct with a hint of alchohol. The flavor was about the same and was tollerable when it was super cold but once it warmed up it lost all hope. This is a beer to avoid for sure, go with Mickey's or Icehouse if you must get a beer like this."
"This is one cheap brew that shames the big macro types, ie Bud, Coors, and Miller. It's just another good product pumped out by the guys and gals at PBR. Since this is Country Club, I guess this is what the rich folk drink."
"A brilliant, golden body sparkles with hundreds of fast-rising, tiny bubbles. It's frothy bright-white head holds surprisingly well for the style, and it maintains a thin but solid cap of creamy foam throughout the entire serving. Surprisingly for a malt liquor, it also leaves some sheets of lace that stand a half-inch or so above the level of the beer as it drops with each sip. The nose is limited, offering only alcohol over a note of sweet malt. The body is medium and it's gently crisp in the mouth. Not unlike the aroma, the flavor delivers a dull, semi-dry malt that expresses very little grain flavor and a noticeable amount of alcohol. Still, it's well balanced by an underlying bitterness and it's not as sickly sweet as some examples of the style tend to be. It finishes clean and dry with just a mild note of residual, lightly sweet malt, a touch of fruitiness that's not really noticeable while in the mouth, and a gentle wash of drying alcohol. Well-balanced and clean; but I'd expect a little more character in a beer that displays its alcohol content so readily."
"Overall, not too bad. If I had to pick a 40, I'd choose Colt 45 over this. I'm not sure of the abv, but my head was slightly humming about halfway through the bottle (I gave the other half to my bro)."
