"O - This beer starts out a little harsh. Once the 8% numbs my tongue it becomes rather easy to drink. It is an exemplary example of an underappreciated style."
""
""
"A little too sweet, good price for the quality. Anything is better than Bud or Coors, right? The aroma isn't bad. The name is catchy and reminiscent of upstate New York. I usually drink lager or ale warm, but this was ice cold. No way can I drink more than 4 oz. Just a bit too flavorful and I might gain weight. Italians make their beer and wines too sweet."

"A golden color similar to miller, It doesn't look bad, with a one finger head but man does it smell awful. It smells like a bottle return. And it tastes like old ""morning after party"" kind of beer I don't like it I'm struggling trying to finish this glass so I can review my fat tire but I would not recommend this beer. It feels under carbonated in under 10 minutes and it makes me gag. Spend the extra 10 cents on something better."

"Your best bet with this is just to shotgun it, or have it after you've had a few. The flavor is bad."

"its isnt the easiest to drink but its 8% and its cheap but i wont buy it for a long time"
"To the brewer: Know your customers."
"like i said, good for what it is. outclasses most others on the same shelf."
"notes: not much to say"

"Overall its a good value if you're looking to get drunk and willing to sacrifice some flavor. Don't think I'll be going back for another round though."
"Mouthfeel- I personally don't like very carbonated beers and this one very much that."
""
"Notes: Overall I am not a fan."
""
"I saw this one next to the other regular low-cost, cheaply made beers near the checkout line. For a $1.59, I thought I'd give it a whirl. It didn't turn out as bad as I thought. Not great by any means, but sure as hell beats the crap out of something like Olde English 800."

"Overall if you like Genny lager you should give this a try. If only for a rating."
""
""
"A hugely carbonated, light golden-colored high-gravity lager. This can presents everything you hoped and feared it would be. Corn, miscellaneous grain, alcohol presence, and some aluminum combine to make...something hardly drinkable. A tick is a tick, but this won't be seeing my lips again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Even judging to style, this is on the low end of things. If you really want to punish your taste buds, let it warm up on a sunny day. Starts to drink like its 80 proof stuff."

"Cheap, but you'd be better to put the money to bus fare or something. Drain pour. You've been warned."
"This is the first time that I've drunk Dog Bite since the alcohol content dropped from 10% to 8%. Quite frankly, I can't see why Genesee would do that. The taste is somewhat different now. Whereas the former (and in my opinion, better) version of Dog Bite was very sweet tasting, the new formula is more run-of-the-mill as far as an HG beer goes. I also don't get the grape-ish smell of old. It's still good, and well worth whatever small amount you'll pay, but it isn't the AxeHead type of skullcrusher it once was. R.I.P. to a great beer, and hello to a decent one."
""
"Overall- This beer surprised me. I was expecting it to be a lot worse than it was. Genesee brewing co. did a pretty good job with this for the style of this beer."
""
""
""
"Smells like rotting honey and tastes like a machine shop floor drain. Drink it ice cold and DO NOT let it get warm. It gets much worse."
""
""
""
""
"Yes, it's 10%...but if you want to get a cheap buzz on quickly without suffering, I suggest you skip this and stick to shots of vodka."
"It doesn't get much swankier than this. Every once in awhile, I just want to get trashy for cheap, and that's exactly what this is designed for. It pours yellow with a foamy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells sickly sweet, like a bar bathroom that has been vomited in. The taste isn't as horrible as the smell, and I can get acclimated to it. There is a boozy aftertaste, but what would you expect for a 10% tall boy for less than $1.50."
"Fucking disgusting, horrible shit. I never waste beer and this got poured down the drain. There are many more cheap, strong/special brews that taste much better. Avoid."
""
""
"Overall – Nothing I would do again. If you feel like a malt (which sometimes I do) I would not take this one. Go with something else."
""
""
"This was an interesting tasting experience. This beer starts strong--nice appearance, acceptable aroma--and then it all falls apart."
""
""
""
"This is one of the better of this genre based on it's drink-ability and, at a buck fifty for a 24oz can, even if it sucked it wouldn't hurt my conscience too much."
"O - Eh. Whatever. I guess its alright.if you only have 5 dollars and want to get smashed then this is your beer. Other than that stay away."
""
""
""
"Overall- Keep it in the can, if you must drink it. All I can really say is that it's incredibly cheap and will probably get you fairly intoxicated for less than the cost of lunch. Other than that, it's not a particularly pleasurable experience. +.5 to the brewers for hiding the alcohol."
""
"Overall it isn't good. I was able to get down 1/4 of a glass of this stuff. It is only recommended as an exploration of bad beer."
"Taste is also very sweet, some apple and pear notes, envelope glue, isopropryl sharpness. Messy and slick on the tongue. Astringency in this beer is awful. Gag inducing and foul, can't help but pull a face when drinking it. Trying to drink more that a third of the can is proving to be a real chore. A novelty beer for the can, the beer inside is cheap swill (not that it's advertised as anything but). $1.09 can."
""
"I rate it as being ""good"" in all respects."
"Picked a bright orange can of this garbage up while cruising back from NY. It poured a clear yellow color with one finger of white head that left scant lacing. The aroma was super boozy with adjuncts and pale malt behind that. The flavors were similar. I started it near ice cold and despite getting intoxicated it got worse as I drank it and it warmed up. Boozy, cheap and dangerous. Feels like a fistfight in a can. The body was medium, carbonation high and mouthfeel prickly."
"1.5, overall, and i'm being 'generous' - as generous i can be considering that i got 'suckered' by the artsy graphics by the corporate brewer 'cloaked' by Rock Wall Brewing attribution v Genesee / North American Brewing actual'. 'Gravity' overcame my 50's era 'big family imprinting (finish everything you take) and this High Gravity 'craft cloaked' factory trash went in the toilet and DOWN the drain. Suckered by factory trash that SUCKS. Won't happen again, and, trust me on this, and don't let it happen to you. Na zdravi!"
"RJT"
"Overall it's a high gravity lager, which isn't saying much. For the style it's average but still not very good."
"+1 to this. And it is gotten over with quick. Nice yellow color, nice white head that leaves nice lacing down the sides of my nice glass. This is where the nice ends. Smells like an adjunct lager, tastes like an adjunct lager mixed with grain alcohol and sterno. Overly boozy and sweet. I drank more of the Jeremiah Weed Tea than I could of this three headed bitch. I spent more time reviewing it than drinking it. Good bye cruel world..."
"O - Not bad for a high gravity lager, but still tastes like it could take the paint off your car."
"O- Is this 24oz can worth the $1.20 I paid for it? I'm going to have to go with no."
"O: Not very flavorful, does not go down very easily, not too filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, I understand that this is a beer designed to pack a big punch, but even for the style this beer overdoes it since there doesn’t seem to be anything at all to balance out the alcohol."
"Note: 24 hour terrible hangover the next day is not worth it. I have never had a worse hangover than after this beer."
"I am a believer in the mantra 'You have to experience the bad to appreciate the good'. This is a perfect example of it...stale grains soaked in watered down vodka with a few sour apple Jolly Ranchers thrown in for good measure. The taste is actually not quite as bad as the nose, which is horrendous, but half this 2x4 will probably go down the drain anyway. The alcohol is too big for its britches and the apple and acetone notes are very distracting. I will admit that it is decently drinkable for a 10% malt liquor...there are worse variants out there. Id still much prefer a 40 of OE to this, if I was fiendin for some malt licka."
"Overall Drinkability - For it's style, really good. Doesn't even taste like a malt liquor. More an Abbey Lager, if there was a term for that. This review is probably my biggest rating deviation of any review I've made."
"This being my millennial review on BeerAdvocate, Dog Bite High Gravity Lager somehow seems appropriate."
"The aroma is a bit fruity, sweet, candy-like, cotton candy and a bit of circus peanuts candy. There is a slight bit of green apple. Now that is not a great aroma, but it is actually better than I expected. The taste is sweet and sour at the same time, reminiscent of the aroma, but does not cause one to gag. Seriously, for a cheap 10% beer, this is about as good as you can hope. Its praise is that it is not nauseating and remains barely drinkable."
"Doesn't have that look of brown, soapy water that most malt liquor seems to have. Other than that, it's unremarkable in appearance. Smells extremely sweet and fruity, with some tart graininess also. Also very sweet and fruity upon tasting. Tastes a little like apple cider. A hint of the tart, earthy flavor associated with malt liquor is there. The slogan for this beer is something about it being a strong beer without a strong bite, and they nailed that. If I'm ever in a situation where I'm forced to drink malt liquor (or just want to get drunk really quick) I'll probably grab a few cans of this stuff."
"O: The nose was just atrocious, but the flavor was actually pretty decent. If you're just looking for a buzz, this could work."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. So far so good. Then as soon as you smell the beer you realize things are taking a turn for the worse. I get a lot of grain and grass notes with a little bit of orange mixed in. The flavor is more of the same with some grain and orange. Actually not bad for a malt liquor, but certainly not a good beer. The alcohol is very well hidden. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
" Endnote: this is a American malt liquor and I judged it as so per style. Considering the competition and others per style this was fair to manage and not as bad as its overall rating may make it appear. Overall I feel this is worthy by style."
"The reason I reviewed this beer is to disagree with the ""Avoid"" rating. There is no reason to avoid it unless you are expecting more than you should from this beer. Come on, it's Genesee. Get real."
"O - If i was still in college I'd go for this but it's been about 4 years... r. For $1.49 it's a cheap drunk, come to think about it... nope, still tastes like crap! If only the beer tasted as good as the can looks cool."
"Even after everything above has been stated... I've had worse."
"Almost a finger of head, and no lace to speak good things about. The color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells like boiled corn and some roasted malt, sweet malt. Taste is just this side of purgatory. Flavors of boiled sweet corn and malt. Mouthfeel is just this side of water, but leaves a parched feeling on my tongue and the back of my throat. One is more than enough for me. I would give it to a person who thinks he knows about good beer and watch his lip curl up."
"I have drank enough of this style to know an ""F" and this was not it, boys and girls. This was not totally unpleasant, Minhas-style, nor was it at the upper-end, like Double Colt 45, which I actually like and have shared in the alley behind my house with some of the night crawling denizens. This was somewhere in the middle, the Twilight Zone of AMLs, where dogs bark in the night but leave you semi-conscious to come back for another go-'round. Go ahead, bite me again, you beast! I dare you."
"I would not recommend this to my worst enemy."
"D- As a malt liquor it's not that bad, but there's just not enough to merit multiple purchases of this. Definitely does not hide the alcohol well."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hints of corn. Taste is not very good, alcohol, plastic, a bit sweet, in a word, yuck. Feels light in the mouth with a slight alcohol burn and is not very drinkable. Overall this is a beer to be avoided."
"Dog Bite High Gravity Lager is a bright yellow beer that's very clear and very sparkling. The thin white head fades to a blotch. It has a grain alcohol aroma, slightly sweet and corny. It smells like a drunk guy. It has a prickly medium body with a pretty dry finish. It leaves the tongue a touch syrupy. It tastes quite sweet and very corny. It tastes like corn on the cob dipped in paint thinner. It tastes much stronger than 10% ABV. There is a fusel aftertaste. Yow. This is like brawling fuel. I feel like I'm being hazed by drinking this. This could use some powdered koolaid and crushed caffeine pills to really show of the class of this fine beverage."

"The body is thicker and not as light as I expected. Could be due to the high abv but it certainly isn't as light as most macros. Actually got a really nice head to boot. Still your expected light watery yellow. Smell is extremely sweet. I actually kind of like it. Very sweet candied pineapple. Think DIPA that has lost it's hops. Eh. A bit too sweet for my tastes. A tad cloying. Reminds me a bit of Fruity Pebbles. Seems the best description. But hey at least it has flavor. Can't say the same for the aftertaste. It fades fast as hell. Mouthfeel is pretty week. Some hard carbonation up front then turns to water. Also it is hot as hell. For what it is it isn't terrible. Just a good cheap drunk. And it will surely do it more than any of malt liquor."
"Seems to be all about the money shot: plenty of alcohol. Makes you appreciate a good barley wine for all the malt, happy hops and complexity. Who knew? Thanks to Riverside Beverages in Chattanooga for bringing in this fine selection."
