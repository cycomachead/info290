Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with sugary, chlorine, and vegetal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with a decent aroma but it's not very drinkable with the odd flavors I am getting.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 01, 2013"

3.32,41.3,4,2,3.5,4,4,"D: $6.79 for a 6-pack of pint cans, a de facto 8-pack, so around a fiver for a sixer. A hell of a lot better than Bud in this price range, not too bad at all. I'd probably put this more in the Cream Ale category than malt liquor, as macro as it is it does show a bit of an ale yeast character, think Genesee, but a little worse, but cheaper.","Halcyondays","Jun 07, 2010"

3.03,28.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"The body was typically thin. Drinkability is dependent on your taste for this style. Overall, for a cheap, strong fizzy yellow beer, this isn't totally terrible and pretty average for the style.","beertunes","Aug 02, 2009"
1.84,-21.7,3,1.5,1.5,3,2,"Bought the sixer while drunk, only because it looked comically bad. The can says copyright Rainier Brewing Company, Irwindale, CA, but I'm 0% surprised to discover an association to G. Heileman. It looks ok in a glass, but smells like my grandparents' old recycle bin, full of Special Export empties. Or a derivative of any of their other swills. It claims to be an ale, but definitely has a malt liquor taste and feel. If you really like Mickey's or Steel Reserve, but are on a budget, grab yourself an ice cold Rainier. Otherwise, stay away.","andyfrancis","Dec 10, 2008"

And when I say rotten wood, I can only imagine it is that log you see lying in the mud that breaks apart when you touch it. Ugh.","magictrokini","Aug 10, 2008"
3,27.7,3,3,3,3,3,"White head, golden ale, cut grass, sweet, thin taste. All delectable adjectives when describing this watered down pabst. I enjoyed it and felt deliciously white trash drink it. Also, for 1.39 it's hard to beat the price. So put on your mesh beer drinking hat, bust out your skoal, and throw down a tall can.","Murchmac","Apr 23, 2008"

3.65,55.3,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"The taste is lightly but consistently malty with a lot of grain, a hint of pine, light fruitiness, a warm pungency, and a spicey grain finish. It is lightly sweet with faint bitterness, while the alcohol mostly adds to the body and spicy warmth without any off-putting odd, moldy fruit or vinegary wine qualities that such beers sometimes have. It's very smooth and satisyfing in its pungency.","Offa","Jul 15, 2007"

2.18,-7.2,3,2.5,2,2,2,"Either the formula has changed, which I do believe based upon the color, or my taste buds have grown immensely. I used to hold this beer in such high esteem, I no longer do. This is pretty much easy to drink Hooch at this point.","Zorro","May 03, 2006"
3.03,28.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"I've got to say this is more of a malt liquor than a cream ale. Anyhow, it pours out to a medium yellow color with a small head of white foam that held up pretty well. Aromas of fresh, young hops and mild adjunct and malts. Taste was fair for a brew with such a high ABV; Medium bodied malts and sharp grains, with corn and hops blending in to give the notion of "malt liquor". Alcohol is noted. Mouthfeel is slighlty smooth, and has some consistancy. Drinkability is average at best. Special thanks goes out to dubbercody for the 40 oz sample.","Frozensoul327","Apr 07, 2006"
2.48,5.5,2,1.5,2,4,4,"Do not mistake this for a decent beer, it is simply something that is easily inhaled quickly when in need of a quick bout of blacking out. It beats the pants off of malt liquor 40oz beers and should be heralded as king of 40'z!","idResponse","Jan 10, 2006"
1.03,-56.2,1.5,1,1,1,1,"Like no other "ale" I've ever tasted. This is even a poor attempt at a brown bag park bench buzz bomb...no ale character at all... no head to speak of...corney...boiled corn in the aroma, sweet corn dextrose and alcohol in the taste....weak pale gold color, no aroma of grain to speak of...just a sweet vegetal taste (filled with adjuncts) and a half hearted attempt at an astringic hop flavor. I got stuck buying a sixpack to sample this and I feel cheated.","pootz","Sep 17, 2005"
1.5,-36.2,2.5,2.5,1,1.5,1,"Rainier Ale is not for the faint of heart, the beer geek or someone that isn't in the mood for a challenge. So, if you find yourself in the great Northwest grab this NW classic that is now brewed in TX.","sockeye101","Aug 26, 2005"

1.03,-56.2,1.5,1,1,1,1,"Dumped from a twelve ounce can into a standard beer mug, the head rises assertively and has the color and consistency of Cool Whip. The body is straw yellow, translucent. Smell: Opens with a wad of cotton candy that has perhaps been mysteriously lingering in a corpulent person's back pocket for an afternoon -- a musty sweetness. The middle pulls out some wacked weed earthiness, some hints of hop activity, and finishes with a waft of water-logged garbage: dank, sickly sweet. Taste: Cheek-clenching (all four of them) at first, due to an extreme pinch of spoiled powder sugar sweetness, worse than that, it's like taking a shot of Equal straight on the tongue. The middle has an old orange pulp bite, like sucking a wedge that has already been sucked and left to sit for at least an entire day, not that I've ever done that! Towards the end, the alcohol heat takes over, warming the throat to the point where I think "yes, yes, warmth! take over the taste!" However, the alcohol heat has the reverse effect of reinforcing the saccharine sweetness and the painfully thin and rusty hop presence, if you can even call it a "presence." Mouthfeel: Well, imagine having a cold, a sinus drip...","RootedFool","Beers"
2.01,-14.5,3,2,2,1.5,2,"At 3.99 a six-pack and 7.3% abv I'm sure it is easy to imagine what this will taste like. Imagine a weaker Steel Reserve, that's basically all Rainier Ale is. Starts off tasting sweet like your normal macro, but as it goes down you taste the extra alcohol on the back of your tongue. Not as evident as in Steel Reserve but it tastes as if they just poured some everclear into the batch to raise the ABV. Not bad if you're going for a hobo brew but stick to normal Rainier if you're looking for a cheap, decent tasting beer.","chrisms86","0"
1.88,-20,3,2.5,2,1,1,"The cream of the crop (pun intended) among the constituents of the BIF 13  From Hell package from BeerAdvocate drewbage, this baby came in a green 16 oz. can that broke the record for overuse of a word by mentioning that this Quality Brewed Rainier Ale is a Mountain Fresh Ale and that the can holds One Pint Ale, and then repeating this on the other side of the can just for good measure. Pouring it in a standard Pilsner glass revealed an ultra pale straw colored body with a fizzy artificial head. The aroma was sugary sweet, and the taste confirmed the adjunct laden origin of the alcohol here. Taste was basically fermented sickly sweetened water passed over corn flakes. This thin and mineralized tasting malt liquor had a mouthfeel like a bad headache waiting to happen. Thank God, the old college days of drinks like this are a distant foggy memory thanks to the blackouts induced by the alcohol. THIS IS NOT AN ALE.","rajendra82","Sep 24, 2003"
2.26,-3.8,3.5,2.5,2,1.5,2.5,"Overall.. meh.. way way too sweet to my taste without anything to balance, but it's cheap if that's where your thrill lies. As for it being a cream ale, not quite. Much too big, too much alcohol burn and too much residual sweetness to match the likes of Little Kings or Genesee in that style.","drewbage","Aug 21, 2003"
