This proves beer doesn't have to be expensive, or craft, just has to be good. This is Beer Advocate, not Craft Beer Advocate, after all.","RacerX5k","May 12, 2014"

1.9,-27.8,3,3,1,3,1.5,"Overall, it's just too alcoholic for my preference for beer. I don't mind the alcohol taste at all, but it's almost just that, and no beer aspects whatsoever. There is no skunkiness or fowl aromas or tastes to it, but it's just too unbalanced for me.","JoLight","Jun 19, 2011"

3.45,31.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Golden beer with a thick, foamy head that dissipates quickly. Smells very sweet and of fermented fruit. Tangy fermented fruit flavor as well, with some burnt grain aftertaste. Pretty drinkable for a malt liquor, especially a higher ABV variety. No musty, offensive flavors present.","keeganfrank","Dec 08, 2010"
3.17,20.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"For the most part, the best you can say about a malt liquor is if it's close to a traditional beer taste and feel -- "this doesn't taste like a malt liquor" is a high mark, in other words. Well...this comes oddly close to not tasting like a malt liquor. High gravity Colt is within inches of bumping SR off its throne.","longbongsilver","Nov 30, 2010"

3.61,37.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"flows down smooth, could drink a few of these in a session, but there are better cheap macros. too bad they don't make 40's of these, as a 40 could make you feel good quick.","7beerphil","Sep 26, 2010"
1.96,-25.5,3,2,1.5,2,2.5,"Beer #9 during Swill Tour 2010. Somehow this one came out rather short and to-the-point. It looks just as pale yellow as pretty much everything else today, with the same kind of ADD froth on top. The nose is soapy, with a hint of burning flowers. The taste is of calcified rice syrup. The body is overtly light, with a hint of heft, a light carbonation, and a sweetly stale feel. Nothing else to say for something so crappy.","TMoney2591","Aug 28, 2010"
2.22,-15.6,2.5,3,2,1.5,2,"The appearance is of a golden clear color with a light lacy head. The aroma is of not much other than a slight corn syrup and malty sugar on the back. The taste is of alcohol most prominently. The flavors are of corn syrup and indigestion...caused by the thick alcohol. There is almost an effervescent flavor that is countered by the extreme syrup flavor. This shouldn't have a medium body, but it does. The drinkability is lacking. I don't like this...at all. Some malt liquors are drinkable, this one...not so much.","Vdubb86","Aug 23, 2010"
2.73,3.8,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of mild malts and alcohol. Taste is alcohol with some hints of malts. Not terrible but a tad unpleasant. Feels light in the mouth and is slightly below average drinkability. Overall this is a mediocre beer.","tone77","Aug 02, 2010"
2.81,6.8,3.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,"From the 710 ml. can marked OCT0410-D07021828. Sampled on Aug. 23, 2010. It pours a bright pale yellow with a good inch of fizzy white head that stays around for the entire time along with decent lacing on the glass. Malts, corn, and other adjuncts greet the nose with, dare I say it, a thin hoppiness around the edges. The taste is mainly grains and malts with a light hoppy bite at the end. But the 8.5% ABV is reasonably masked. But your head reminds you that it is there when all is said and done. This is very much like any macro high gravity malt liquor. Tons of punch but little in the way of character or taste.","puboflyons","Jul 10, 2010"
3.15,19.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"The colt 45 beers are probably the best adjunct lagers, but then again, only if your in a pinch would i recommend this.","crossovert","Jun 23, 2010"
3.31,25.9,3,2,3.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability is high until the ABV hits you. At $1.29 for 24 oz. you don't have to stop until it makes you. I don't think Colt 45 High Gravity is close to overthrowing Hurricane High Gravity as the king of high gravities, but it deserves an honorable mention, especially at 8.5%.","troobie","Jun 11, 2010"
3.08,17.1,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"D: Good, I wouldn't buy all the time, but it's def. something to try if you haven't already, one of the better high gravitys on the market.","Lacesoutcody","May 09, 2010"

3.38,28.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"I had about a finger of bone-white head and while I was typing the proceeding, it evaporated. Whoops! Color was a beautiful sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was slightly fusel, but not overwhelming. This was actually drinkable. Mouthfeel was medium with a taste of berries, sugar, and simple starch carbohydrates (think licking a raw potato). Not my favorite set of flavors in combination, especially where beer is concerned, but deadly, or drain pour-like? Hardly. This will get its users where they are going, but with minimal damage incurred on the trip. Just don't drive and/or operate heavy machinery afterward, babies! You'll be fine. Trust the monk. Finish? Dry. Like the Zephyr winds blowing across the Sahara. That is what happens when you suck all of the sugar away. Boo hoo. You want sweet, drink some white wine. This is unapologetic and so am I!","woodychandler","Apr 09, 2010"

3.33,26.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"As much as you hear about Colt 45, this HG masterpiece somehow flew under the radar. The fabled story of HG malt liquor continues to prove they are better than their counterparts. Pours a glowing golden with a gloriously thick white head that left fair lacing. Smells of grain mostly with a bit of honey sweetness. The taste is grainy malts and plastic, the plastic carries through into the finish alongside some cookielike malt. Feels fairly normal with the typical higher carbonation. Not a bad malt liquor actually.","vacax","0"
3.19,21.3,4.5,3,3,3,3.5,"D: This is one of the best malt liquors out there. I was expecting this to be terrible considering the regular Colt 45, but I found this to be quite decent.","womencantsail","Dec 25, 2009"
2.27,-13.7,2,2.5,2.5,1.5,2,"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is medium. A bit of alchol peaks out in the mouth. The beer isnt bad for what it is no gag inducing flavors noted. This is an ok buzz beer.","nlmartin","Dec 16, 2009"
2.73,3.8,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Clear pale golden with a fizzy white head. The smell is creamed corn and trace floral hops. Green apple skin, sweet grits and untoasted grain with a touch of grain alcohol in the finish. Medium bodied and super carbonated. This is not bad for the style but not really good either. Good bang for the buck if you want a cheap and drinkable high octane beer.","biggred1","Nov 07, 2009"
2.78,5.7,3,2.5,3,3,2.5,"D: A little flavorful for the style, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, overall it might not be pretty bad but within the context of what this beer is meant for it could be considered fairly good. The regular Colt 45 might taste a little better but that's the price you pay for "high gravity".","TheManiacalOne","Sep 26, 2009"
