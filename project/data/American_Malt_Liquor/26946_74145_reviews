"Had to throw away"

"Gaaah! While the booze doesn't really cause any problems here, it's about the only thing that doesn't (double negatives for the win!). Minhas' inbred, insidious, and apparently thorough industrial effluent house character in on full display here, for, well, for worse only, I don't think I really gotta say. This is the brewer's best-suited 'style', and yet, this offering is nothing less than a fucking hurtful (hey - truth in advertising!) mess."

"Another beer from the creator of the canquest, woodychandler. Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a bright yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has some sweetness, malts, a bit of plastics. Taste is malts, alcohol, a touch of sweetness, some green apples, not very good but certainly drinkable. Feels light in the mouth and overall is not a bad beer, about average for this style."

"O: For an American Malt Liquor, this beer is pretty good. No alcohol flavors are present and the taste isn't really dominated by flavors of adjunct malts."

"The Crack was good, but the Glug was a stop 'n' go affair as it simply wanted to foam up and be a general pain in the ass. The smell really activated my gag reflex with its combination of cotton CANdy, plastics factory and dry cleaning plant odors. Upon settling, I ended up with two rocky fingers of bone-white head with marginal retention. Loads of lacing in its wake as it fell. Color was a pale straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity and loads of CO2 bubbles in evidence. It was as effervescent as Alka-Seltzer, which I may need after I am done with this. Bringing it up to my mouth, I caught a whiff of what smelled like hydrogen peroxide and I began to sweat. Suddenly, the heavy tramp of Cybermen could be heard in the alley behind my gate. I was once again going to be subsumed by dint of drinking a CANcoction unfit for humans. Curse you, Minhas, for being a front for these unfeeling aliens! My first sip was initially decent, with a full, creamy mouthfeel and an initial taste of vanilla, Twinkie-like, until I got hit with the rest of it. Let me now turn to Jeremy Gordon of TheClassical.org for his take: ""two flavors stood out for me in Big Hurt: 1) sour and 2) gross, with an aftertaste that felt like I’d just spit out a mouthful of shaving cream. Other taste impressions written down: “sawdust pie”; “boiled down baby bottle nipples”; “burp-flavored Sour Patch Kids”; “Drano martini.” Ha! I would find that even more humorous were it not for the fact that my bodily functions were beginning to cease and my joints were turning into aluminum. You know, I always wondered what became of all of those CANs that I recycled, but now it dawns on me that they are made into Cybermen suits into which our brains are transferred. ALCOA is a shill for the Cybermen! I am selling my stock ASAP. Quiet! The Cyberleader is giving us our orders. I now love the taste of this beverage. It smells perfect. I really like the bone-dry aspect of the finish which renders it very refreshing inside of this metallic suit. I must buy more and pass it out to all of my acquaintances. The Cyberleader has spoken and I hear and obey."
"At first I was surprised at it's clarity and crisp smell. It has a nice head to it, nothing too overboard. The taste is mostly clean with bit of a back tongue grab. It's finish is clean and non lingering, and that's what I like in a lager. Overall it was somewhat better than what I was expecting."

"Harsh astringency, numbing alcohol. Flaccid without any flavor. Grain husks and wet paper, cheap wine with club soda carbonation. People think this is actually decent? Lol..."
""
"This beer was better than I expected. If this is a malt liquor then its the best malt liquor I've ever had...I I had plenty in college. The beer pours a clear yellow with thin white head that initially fizzes then dissapates. The scent is sweet with presence of saaz hops. The taste is sweet with effervesance of grain and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium body with good carbonation. Overall its ok...if the abv was dialed back to 5-5.5% it would be better."

"Holy, what the... This is insane. Such an obnoxiously sweet nose on this thing. Flavor is, just gross. This is really atrocious, and I can't believe that it was in the craft beer section of where I bought it. I mean, come on. For beers like this, we shouldn't need 250 words."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is fairly drinkable and not all that bad for the style."

"Overall Drinkability: As a refreshing light beer, this doesn't work. As a malt liquor, this kicks ass."
""
"Notes: Surprisingly decent, especially for a cheap malt liquor. Not a good beer, but for what it is, it is good. No off-flavors or grape drank flavor for a malt liquor is nice. I can't really see getting this another time but I might if I want a malt liquor."
"And, this makes me feel like I'm back in college. So it has that going for it."

"Drink- The big hurt put a big hurt on my feelings. Man great ball player. Shit beer. Oh well its a $1.50 what did I expect?"
""
"Ehh, it is what it is. This is fine if your looking to get sauced before a game and looking for a high abv malt."
"Poured a 24 oz can into a masskrug. The white head stands about 1/2 inch pouring. Pale yellow body shows visible rising carbonation. Aroma is rather plain, light malt with a sweetness I can't exactly place, I want to say apple but that's not right. The taste comes in with a slight smoothness, I get some light sweetness as well as a odd funk like flavor. Mouthfeel is thicker than I expected, medium body with pretty good carbonation. Overall, not a beer I'd drink again, it's about what I expected from a malt liquor."
"Overall-- yikes. I won't get this again... It isn't terrible, but I prefer a thousand other options... The other can I bought will be headed out in my box for the disc golf BIF, but that was my intention anyway!"
"Better than Colt 45, but that's about all I can give it."

"Sweet, syrupy, and boozy warmth on teh palate. Best if you drink this fast before it warms up too much."
"Pretty much like every other cheap malt liquor that I've had except this one has a funky corn and sweet band-aid flavor. I'm not going to say it's terrible because it's Frank Thomas but it's not very good, haha."
""
"O- This beer is pretty clean but it has some odd flavors and to much alcohol to make it refreshing."
"And the reveal is…Big Hurt Beer….awesome! When I was a kid I was a huge Frank Thomas fan, and when I read about this swore I'd get a can at some point, so killing 2 birds with one stone. It's actually not that bad (for Malt liquor), and better than most....I liked it better than the Super 15!"
"D - It's absolutely better than I hoped it would be, but that's not quite enough to say it was truly enjoyable."
"O- Actually better than i was expecting. Would not buy it again, but would drink it over almost any macro."

"Frank Thomas played baseball about eleventy-billon times beer then this beer tasted. He's a HOFer, but this beer, is not."
"O - This is highly drinkable, and doesn't taste bad. I'm not saying it's good, but I didn't mind it at all."
"Light yellow, 1/8th in snow white head that stuck around for a bit. Smells like old rusty water, you know when you turn on the hose form sitting all winter? The taste reminds me of a quieter Steel Reserve, the sweetness to be exact. I like everything dry so that off the bat is not appealing. The alcohol is there and abundant, might have been smoother if it was on tap. I think I would have been better off slinging $1.69 for a 24oz of PBR instead of 2 buck for this."
"D-Not as terrible as I imagined, but nothing mind-blowing either. One plus is that the alcohol is not noticeable at all for 7%, which I thought would be very present in a beer this light bodied/colored/flavored."
"D - One of the better tasting malt liquors I've had, although I suspect the lower ABV is a huge advantage. If this was 12% and tasted the same it'd be seriously impressive; as is, it's merely an above average higher-ABV adjunct lager. Would consider purchasing this at a ballgame over many of the other horrendous options (although US Cellular actually offers some good beers)."
"I'm a ChiSox fan and quite the ticker. This is not a necessarily good combination when random, new, Sox-themed beers come about. This one arrived in my area a couple days ago. $1.79 for a 24oz can. Based on experience, this is not a good start. It pours a clear pale-ish golden straw topped by a finger of white, craggy foam. The nose comprises corn, flour, corn syrup, light biscuit, semi-sweet flowers, and grass. It's not too bad, so far. The taste, though, finally brings the quasi-expected storm: notes of corn syrup, sweetgrass, flowers, rice cake, honey, hard water, and fresh-from-the-cob corn. Wow, this stuff is somehow both sickly sweet and mineral-laden-ly vegetative. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat syrupy feel. Just like the taste, the feel is kinda oxymoronic, feeling both smoothly flowing and thickly stiff. I'm definitely not smiling with this stuff on my tongue. Overall, Big Frank said he wouldn't put his name on a bad beer. Looks like he was right: This is a downright crappy beer. Of course, with that ABV and the other options around, I'd probably still drink this at The Cell if the Sox don't start improving soon: Something's gotta take my mind off of the sadness on the field. Definitely sadness here in this can..."
