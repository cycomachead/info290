APPEARANCE: brassy golden body that matches the translucence of water; snow-white sudsy head fizzles to a sickly residual; vibrant bubbles at the pour evaporate immediately... AROMA: pitchy, astringent malts; its appeal is purely in the twist cap nostalgia.. PALATE: fizzy, rather oily and sift; gassy, beefy aftertaste; thin and drinkable....TASTE: puckerishly sweet, with a water hose copper coupling overbearing flavor;; some champagne (!) notes; simply not flavorful ...

A fly! Got it! Extremely pale (just barely yellow) and uber-carbonated malt liquor with a sweet dank malt aroma like an old grainery full of corn husks. Ample corn on the nose is followed by the same on the palate, very sweet like old corn or corn syrup. A little fruity as well, maybe some almost vanilla-like floral notes. Extremely thin bodied and recalls soda water in this regard. Finish also pretty sweet with no discernible hop presence and a few fusel aromatics ... Not as much of the latter as higher ABV malt liquors. In all honesty this is not horrible if you realize beforehand what this beer style is supposed to embody: A sweet alcoholic tasting fizz bomb for mass consumption. I am tempted to try a Colt .45 now.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 02, 2013"

The taste is malty and thick and hits you like a brick. Couldn't drink more than 3 at a time, but looked forward to an inexpensive, cold beer at the end of a hard day's work.

Malt Liquor is not for everyone, but when I drink these beers from the widemouth “Green Grenade"" I tend to lose count. Overall Mickey's has a mild sweet taste, some mild hops, low bitterness, high carbonation, and there’s a slight graininess to the palate that lingers into the finish. On football nights when friends come over they tend to pick out these beers over the higher rated ones.","smokinyodas","Feb 17, 2013"

1.95,-21.4,2,2,1.5,3.5,2,"O: Mickey's is best out of glass: 12 oz. or 40 oz. I don't know what it is about cans but it seems to ruin what flavor and characteristic there is. I've had some amazing tasting Mickey's before, but not this one. Considering how mass produced this is and how cheap it is there may be some variation from batch to batch as well. Mickey's is available pretty much everywhere making it an inoffensive choice when nothing else seems appealing. In the malt liquor world the low 5.6% ABV and higher than average price make this an amateur's choice.","troobie","Jul 20, 2012"

The color was quite normal to any other malt liquor of its category as well as the smell. The taste how ever was very yeasty which I didn't really prefer. I don't recall any terrible after tastes.

One minute one finger head, notable amt. of rising bubbles. Avg appearance for the style. Sweet smelling, malt and a hint of alcohol. Not much to say taste wise but at least it isn't unpleasing. Tastes like the first beer I sipped from my dad's can as a child. It's refreshing, and a little sharp. I'll probably make this a regular when I buy forties since it actually resembles what beer is supposed to taste like, as opposed to 90% of the bottled garbage juice in that same cooler.","J23hc","Dec 19, 2011"

Streams up tiny bubble can be seen. Corn and other grains are present in the nose. Also there is a mix of lemon and grass through the middle that is not half bad. Finish is clean with little lingering smells. Sweet corn and grains mainly with grassy undertones. Fairly simple. Taste a lot better cold. I'm noticing as its warming the low quality ingredients become apparent. Mouth feel is smooth enough although carbonation is lacking some. Could use a bit more bubbles.

It’s got a pleasant pungent quality I like too. Still, it’s no OE. OE brings malt liquor to a whole new lever of flavor and this one is really lacking in comparison. It’s far more interesting and enjoyable than a King Cobra, though. As simple as it is, it’s got enough of that pungent cheap grain malt liquor taste to pull it a bit ahead of some other malt liquors. It’s dry enough. Really wondering why I always thought it was sweet. It’s just sorta boring. Mouthfeel is very dry and crisp for a malt liquor.

Anyway it pours just like any other American adjunct lager I've had with a yellow body and A white head. The head fades and leaves us with sweet smelling brew.

The body is completely yellow, so much carbonation I can't even think strait; completely see through as well. The head looks frothy and nice, but it's already disappearing, it is leaving nice lacing though. Confusing look overall, because all the aspects are horrible accept for the lacing and the head are pretty damn nice. I don't detect too much skunk on this beer, which is good considering it's out of a green bottle, but then again I don't smell much period. There is a gross sour, adjunct malt smell, and maybe the slightest hint of hop in there somewhere. It just smells boring, it smells boring and watery. Wow, that's a pretty horrible taste, I get this huge gross malt taste, just full of adjuncts and other crap, that is mixed in with water, and with a slight alcohol taste. One thing that surprises me about this is how not crisp it is, that's usually one redeeming factor for these adjunct beers, but this isn't even crisp or that refreshing. The only thing I can really say that is good about the taste is that all the flavors are blended well together, but none of them are good flavors, so...yeah. It gets easier to drink as you get closer to the bottom of the glass, but that's not going to save this beer from a bad rating. The mouthfeel is ok for a malt liquor, but pretty damn light overall, not too impressive there. One thing I can say is that this beer is incredibly easy to drink, I don't know what it is but it just goes down and before you know it the glass is gone.

The nose comprises wheat, corn, and hay wet with the runoff from some dark, murky bog in the old English countryside, the kind of thing you'd see in some rustic Gothic throwback tale. The taste holds notes of corn, corn syrup, and a heaping helping of bad apple juice. Up until now, I was unaware that apple juice could go bad in this manner. now I think it could be a possibility. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel.

Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, allowing me to look through the walls into the neighbor's doings. Nose was comparably sweet with some of the high ABV offerings of today, but with a none-too-subtle cereal quality mixed in. Mouthfeel was effervescent and scrubbing to the point that I felt like I had a new palate. I kid you not, this was a very pleasant diversion after today's skull-ripping. It was plenty sweet with a lot of adjunct characteristics, but it was also a beer that I felt comfortable sitting with in front of the TV. There was nothing off about it, despite its being in a GREEN (oh, no!) bottle, but either pasteurization or good handling or both kept it that way. YMMV. Finish left me simply craving a Hammond's-brand hard pretzel to cut some of the cloying sweetness. Would I drink this again? Heck, yes! Would it be my first choice? Heck, no! Was it cost-effective/worthy? Yep. What would my back alley homies say? Hey, I've hung out and imbibed with them enough to the point that they call me ""Pittsburgh"" and don't throw their empties in my yard, instead leaving them hanging in a bag on the fence for me to collect and recycle.

Smells like malt..really, and yeast, with a little wet corn. The taste is a bland mixture of wheat, barley, corn and yeast that dries out my mouth. Most of the zing went into the head, so there is not much mouthfeel but that of flat soda water.

So, with protest, I poured this tall boy into my Smokestack goblet and it came gushing out as a straw yellow with a big, fizzy white head. The aroma is sweet corn. The taste is a generic mild sweetness that sits easy on your tongue. I have always wished that Mickeys would come out with 12oz cans or at least 4 packs but alas, I don't think its going to happen. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, to the point where it tickles your tongue. I think this is a very drinkable malt liquor.

Light gold color that you can see thru, the smell is not like paint thinner like an Old E or a Hurricane (yech!) but of a watery hop-substance, and the taste is somewhat foul but smooth. The other advantage that Mickey's has over the other malt liquors (and I am not talking about the goofy sayings on the cap) is the grenade bottle. For those who don't know, rather than the normal bottle which, on a guess, is 6 inches from bottom to start of neck and holds about 2 oz. each, this bat boy is 3 inches tall and there's 4 oz per inch.

This one has a head of fine white bubbles and just a little lacing with carbonated bubbles rising up the side of the glass. I can spell BURP already! It smells like puck (spelling?) Highly carbonated taste, but not as bad as it smells, BURP! Bubly flavor with a mild aftertatse, BURP. It's a typical malt liquor with nothing special about it, BURP, BURP, BURP.","TheDM","Apr 15, 2003"
2.8,12.9,2,2,3,3,3.5,"Just the odd ""Bigmouth"" bottles put you into a humorous mood. The pale gold color with the little fizzy bubbles traveling though the body up to the thin head is misleading. This beer has more substance than you might expect. There's a round and smooth sweet malt foundation in which some metallic hop and alcohol reside alongside some cornmeal-like flavor. In large gulps, which the brewer intended with the wide mouth bottle, an astringent medicinal taste is noticed. The aroma reminds me of wet rye bread. All in all, in the cheap Malt Liquor for the huddled masses-type beer category, not bad...not good either.","BeerResearcher","Mar 15, 2003"
2.23,-10.1,2.5,2,2.5,2,2,"BRAIN GRENADES! That sums it up! These short fat green bottles pack a helluva punch. Strong flavor of alcohol and a bit lower than normal carbonation.

1,-59.7,1,1,1,1,1,"This has to be one of the worst beers I have tasted. I think they created the wide mouth so you could chug it down like a shot and get it over with as quickly as possible. The color of the beer was like a faded yellow color and had absolutely no head. The aroma just reeked of corn or whatever odor creates that effect. The flavor was just hard to get a hold of because the finish is just so harsh with a lot of bit to make it impossible to really discern any. My roommate's exchange for drinking my Sierra Nevada Pale. Hardly a fair trade.","Wildman","May 20, 2002"

My first experience with Mickey's was the stumpy  wide mouth bottles, and they seem easy to chug. I think that's the whole point. Anyway, as far as malt liquor goes, this is probably the best tasting, but it also has the lowest alcohol content of a malt that I have seen.","IrishRedRock","Apr 17, 2002"
