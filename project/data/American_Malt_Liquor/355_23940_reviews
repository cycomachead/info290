"Again: it doesn't rank up with the greatest beers, but self-described ""malt liquors"" rarely do (shout-out to Three Floyds' Region Riot).  This is imminently drinkable, however, which is more than can be said for Naty Ice or, say, Steel Reserve."

"Strong as per local standards"

"O - my first Malt Liqour, and maybe I will not be chasing one again... Just not very drinkable all in all."
""

""
"It is what it is."

"Thin and watery as well as fizzy in the feel, this light-bodied beer is sweet in the feel but goes extremely dry into the finish. Still, it's surprisingly clean and, when the fizziness fades, somewhat crisp before it falls off."

"I also hope this is the correct beer. Mine was in a 1 liter bottle and came from the Philippines. It was labeled as Extra Strong Beer and was 8% so I'm assuming it is right. Anyway, I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice straw colored brew with a nice big white head. However that did not last very long. Lacing was decent. The beer smelled kinda yeasty, but good. The taste was good. Very fresh very un-shocking, pretty normal. Seemed to be highly carbonated and did not taste strong like the 8% would have made me think it would be. No burn, great taste. I would buy again."
"The official beer of Filipino galivanting and camaraderie, the 8% ABV makes Red Horse an excellent choice for those seeking a cheap buzz. The 1 in 6 crazy horse bottle is stuff of legend. Actually not terrible, tastes like a bunch of cereal grains processed industrially. Metallic aftertaste and bone dry going down. Quite filling, but a good time."

"Pours a clean and clear golden straw color, quite bubbly but no retention. When cold, scent was muted cereal grains with a splash of floral hops, but as it warms a slight but unpleasent chemical, rubbery smell comes through with industrial alcohol. Taste starts clean when cold, sweet cereal, light flowers and faint fruit water, but chemicals and alcohol come through increasingly as it warms. Bad lingering aftertaste, bubbly and very light. Less body and flavor than most malt liqours, but some unpleasant notes creap in."
""
"O: Goes down easy, not overly tasty, not filling, decent kick, ok representation of style. This is a so-so beer. Larger ABV but not a lot of body and flavoring to it."
""
""
"D: wish the body, as well as the nose, had some more grain in it. for a 7%ABV brew im surprised at such a light body. another boring rice brew from Asia in my book. (2)"
""
"O: Just a so so brew. Nothing special or anything I would remember."
""
"Aroma is crisp and malty, rather strong, nothing to Tweet about but still promising. It pours a clear straw yellow with a fluffy and not very persistent white head, about what one expects from beer of this type. Flavor is - well, there is a hint of malt, but not much to it. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy, but body is below average. Well, the Philippines are not renowned for beer. Maybe we should send some craft brewers over there - or some Trappist monks. ;)"

"Not a beer I'd revisit by choice, though if you're stuck with a selection of rice lagers and looking something with a non-offensive alcohol kick Red Horse isn't too bad."
""
"D: Little different... fruity, corny sweet, sharp crisp and watery... Nothing harsh but nothing crazy great... the ABV is there and you can taste it... 1 will do you.... Is it great, no... is it bad, no."
"Overall: Red Horse is harsh, but it was expectedly harsh. Even among its pernicious brethren, it's pretty low on the totem pole."
"This beer has danger written all over it. High alcohol beer that can easily be chugged without being to heavy or sugary. The taste is very dulled down with no distinguishable features, but for malt liquor, that may be a good thing."
"Overall the beer is ok if that's all you got left in your fridge. Burping up this beer is as bad as it smells. The only reason I'd ever buy this again is to get another confirmation from a fellow beer drinker that this beer smells like Vomit."
"Overall, not much to recommend from this one."
"This one was kind of strange. It was nothing impressive, which is obvious by my review numbers, but it was fairly drinkable. Granted, I had just came in from doing yard work in the hot southern sun, but this was easy on the tastebuds and not offensive in any way. It was fairly watery tasting, which was hard to believe since it was supposed to be over 7%. Smell and taste were much the same, water. Ok, maybe a little hint of adjunct, but not much. This could easily replace Bud Light or Miller Light and it's stronger. How'd they do that? I was impressed, because most malt liquors I have, had a funky alcoholy taste, especially when you start to get over 6%. This one didn't."
"D: This beer is not as bad as the ratings would suggest. It's definitely not the greatest beer I've tasted, but it's certainly not the worst. It seems that it would be a refreshing and a quite strong beer for a nice summer day."
"Really not the best beer out there, not even close to a decent brew really. This beer is a plain yellow with a white head that fades quickly. It's got a sweet smell which is ok but the taste it just a mix of sweetness and metal. Not very pleasent at all. I can't believe that poeple brew this with the intent to sell."
"Medium body and carbonation. Drinkability is low due to the rather unpleasant taste. It's not the worst beer in the world, but it is is a contender."
"I had to ask if this was actually made with hours urine, because it smells like it. It is sharp with a bad taste just bitter and super carbonated at first then went flat in a few seconds. Thankfully I was eating food to get the taste out. It was almost like sucking on a penny."
"Other than the novelty of trying a beer from this country, I can't think of a good reason to have one of these. Poured a gold tinged with amber. Aroma was slightly medicinal. Sweet malt with a slightly rough grain edge was pretty much the extent of the entire flavor roster for this beer. Not undrinkable, but hardly enjoyable."
"I don't think I will go into the whole process on this one. It, for me, pretty much taste like Old English 800, or something similar. Adjunct city, very light and clear, near white thin head, not great taste nor mouthfeel. Very disappointing at the $7.99 price tag per sixer."
"This malt liquor we're talking about, don't expect some amazingly complex flavor. It is what it is."
"Edit as it warms things get worse, I poured the last half"
"Undercarbonated. Slick and watery. Taste is not really there. Not unpalatable, but not that great either."
"I had this beer quite a few times while I was back home, in Philippines. It's a 21 y.o. crowd fav since it was cheap and got you a good buzz."
"As far as malt liquors go, this ain't half bad, but I guess I mean that in the literal sense, like half of zero is still zero...swish! Yeah, imbibe this only if your taste buds, humility, and bank card are all taking the day off - or have for some time, my condolences."
"Overall if I was served one around here I wouldn't refuse."
"A hint of sweet malt and an alcohol bite are present atop a foundation of less noble grains. A brief grassy, cidery flavor is present at the back of the palate at the finish. Alcohol taste dominates throughout."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Very mild malt and corn aroma. Taste is crisp with some malt and corn flavors. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. I drank a lot of this in the Philippines and was happy to see it here in the USA for the first time. One of my favorite malt liquors."
"(D)- Taste-wise, there is really nothing that excites or appeals to me. Its got basic, cheap flavors. But at 7% abv, it can get ya drunk easy enough after a few (if thats your goal). It actually started to taste worse and worse the more I had of it."
"Well then, better than I expected in some aspects, even more palatable than most domestic malt liquors and many domestic macros, yet isn't really what I'm itching for most days. However for those of you in the crowd out for a fairly smooth and drinkable cheap buzz, this is your stuff. If Mountain Crest catches wind of this stuff it'll sink their ship."

"This was brought to a party by my friend who, bless him, got it instead of a wheat beer because they store worker said it was, ""fantastic"". I need to ask him what store it was and slap that person."
"D: Nothing harsh about this beer. Very light body and flavor. Nothing I would seek out in the future, but it was given to me so I drank it."
"Taste: It doesn't taste as good as it smells but it's still really good for a malt liquor."
"Overall- For a Malt Liquor this isn't too bad. The smell and aftertaste knock this 1 down a notch."
"This one is a drinking paradox, no problem enjoying the 500ml glass of it, but would I want it another? If free, OK. I won't buy another import bottle, but would drink it locally."
"Very quick, bright white, spongey head. No lacing, or bubbling. Bright yellow with maybe a dull brass. Sweet pilsnery malt aroma with maybe a touch of herbal grassy hops. Malty swet whn its cold and maybe some herbal hop notes. Very simpe tasting beer. Wasn't expecting much. Mild sweetness on the palate tha lingers a bit. Can't really notice the 7% abv. But I recommend finishing this bere before it gets warm. Tastes good cold, so you have to drink a 7% beer prety fast. Sounds like a recipe to drunk really fast. You can't really savor this beer in any decent time span."
"For a malt licquor this one is a good bet"
"I'm no expert on this style but this can't be a good example surely?"
"Pale yellow colored beer with a very rapid fading head.Aroma is almost nothing.Taste is macro like but with a sourness I can't quite identify.This beer is by no means terrible but I can't imagine paying again for this when there are some many other choices out there.I would drink again if offered to me but it is just too boring of a beer to seek out."
"The aroma is corn malt, grassy hops, and funky BO. The appearance is pale gold with a fizzy head like the kind on a soda. The taste is like the aroma with a touch of medicinal qualities. The palate is super thin. I can't see drinking this for any reason."
"D: Unimpressed all around, drinks quite easy for its 7.0%abv but still not enough reason to do so."
"Received as gift first of all. Poured from 40, cant remember the last time I had one of these, into pint glass. Clear, light yellow, with some fluffy head. Smell is poor, I think the first ""1" I've given yet, just smells terrible. Taste isnt awful but not quite ok. Mainly malt, some alcohol, and some earthy tastes. Mouthfeel actually isnt terrible. Its light and crisp and easy going down. This is a bad beer but its better than nothing I guess...maybe."
"Dont bother with this one."
"This is possible the worst beer I have ever had. I am so glad I split this bottle three ways, because drinking four ounces was a bit of a struggle."
"Next time , I'll pass. This stuff is horribly horrid."
"Drinkability: Great Philippine party beer. I have heard rumor from the locals that Gin is added to give it an extra punch."
"In the USA this beer is listed as a Malt Liquor, here in the Philippines it's sold as a Strong Beer. It's definately not a Malt Liquor like others I've had in the states. Has more characteristics of beer in it such as a good crisp citrus taste and a hop bitterness that you just don't find in steel reserve. This stuff just must taste better in the Philippines because it's fresher and definately has a fast sell through in the local sari-sari. I can get it where it was brewed only days ago. Cost in the Philippines is 46 pesos for a 1L bottle ($1) with a 6 Peso deposit (about 14 cents). Definately good for a sesh with friends in the warm, muggy Philippine evenings."
"D: 7% ABV is the last nail in this beverage's coffin. Easily one of the lowest of the low. Thank you World Market."
"Served chilled, in a 250 ml pilsener glass."
"Mouthfeel was thin with a peppery carbonation texture."
"Overall: The fifth and final San Miguel offering dragged back all the way from the Philippines by a work colleague who knows that I like to try new brews. The offerings from San Miguel are certainly that and some of them werent too bad. However, this, the (allegedly) strongest one of the SM bunch is harsh and unrefined, the Philippines version of that cheap Supermarket own-brand Super-Strength Lager that the local Down and Outs drink no doubt. Given the earlier description, this is more of a Red Herring than a Red Horse."
"Don't let this bitch warm up as it gets downright nasty. It becomes thicker and sweeter creating a schwillish finish. Not for me and the FDA should open an investigation as to how this is determined safe for consumption. Still this is not the worst beer in the world and when Ice cold (i.e. the first drink) was tolerable."
"Picked up this beer upon a recommendation by a (so called) friend. Though decent for it's style, the style is horrible. Expectably a syrupy yellow look with fizziness. Grain aromas all over the place. Tastes a mix of grain and malt with a table sugar sweetness added. A little too hot and numbing for good drinkability. Mildly fruity, like bruized peaches, pears, and apples, but not enough to establish a meaningful character. Finishes with a light astringent graininess, thin texture, and fusal alcohols. The only reason that I can imagine someone would drink this is if they want to get drunk and only have $3.50 to do it with."
"Wow. Even fancy malt liquor still sucks."
"Pours out to a solid yellowish straw color with a nice head that subsides slowly. Nice faint smell of malt. Very faint. The taste isn't very well balanced at it is rather sweet. Could use some more hops, though I can feel the bitterness bite through in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is alright, with a decent amount of carbonation to keep things interesting. This is a fairly drinkable beer that I will drink again sometime soon."
"As far as malt liquors go, it's pretty well done. It's more restrained with a thinner body than usual, less alcohol than some examples, and less adjunct sweetness than is normally found. However, the floral character can become a bit cloying as it warms."
"A first round loser in our Malt Liquorpalooza 2006, Red Horse did not impress me. It poured almost clear, like diluted sparkling apple cider. smell was a cloying alcohol and corn mix. Taste was terrible, some malt liqor flavor for about a half second and then just a harsh isopropanol taste that burned and set off my gag reflex. totally watery and gross. Surprisingly to me, this was only beaten out by its competition (Crazy horse) in a tiebreaking vote."
"First beer to start the day off with. A very clear light yellow pour. Fizzy moutain dew like head emerges then reduces. Aroma is basically nothing except maybe some alcohol. Taste is very sugary to begin with then bitter, but there's not really any malt or hops in here. No base to this beer. Alcohol is strong but not over the top at all. A bit of a chemical flavor in here, almost medicinal. I'd pass on this one, go get some real malt liquor if you want to get drunk."
"Golden color with a well retaining white head, gigantic bubbles rising from bottom to top to keep the head alive. Adjunct malt and fusel alcohol in the nose. Slightly sweet initially, with decent malty undertones, but other than that there's not a lot going on here. Warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is spritzy and spirited but not overpoweringly carbonated. As someone else may have said, this is an alcohol delivery vehicle...not much flavor here. And as it warms, it gets worse..."
"Pours a dark straw color with a large head, that recedes to a thin, but nice head for a malt liquor. Smells of corn and other adjuncts. Taste is very sweet and moderately carbonated. I was surprised to be able to actually taste some malts and not just solvent flavor. It goes down quite smooth and has a small hop aftertaste. Drinkability is a tad higher than most malt liquors, but not something to brag about."
"One of the worst beers from this philippine´s brewery (SAN MIGUEL) its poor smell and taste, made good for drink with chinese cuisine, for the mexican and american is not recommended, mouthfeel , like a malt in its more pure style; how ever, is a popular beer in southeastern asia and india; not recommended beer."
" About on par with Corona, but beefier. Better than Bud. But, hey, it's beer...hooray, beer!"
"1000 ml brown glass bottle with painted label and date stamped on the cap, direct from the Philipines. Pours into the glass with a yellow golden color, a large white foamy head that sticks around the edge of the glass. Foam doesn't last, no lace. Appears pretty much flat, no carbonation. Not much aroma, just some sour ""euro skunk"" smell. The taste is of some grain and bitters, but more of that same slight skunkyness. Somewhat watery mouthfeel, with and ending of sour/acidity. Red Horse Extra Strong - the Beer that kicks you back. Thanks to Fele for bringing this back. I prefer the Gold Eagle from last time."
"Smooth a crisp with a mild acrid twang from the fermentation. Cereal grain and mild malt with little hop character ... just bitterness to balance. A little too wet on the palate ... watery IMO. Usually there is more of a definitive corn flavor to malt liquors. Clean finish with some residual dextrin like sweetness."
