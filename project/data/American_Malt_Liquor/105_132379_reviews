"My wife's family came in to town and I found myself cooking Sunday brunch for 'em all.  My Brother In Law brought an ice cold 12 pack of these and we just sort of started drinking them.  There is a slight metallic or artificial taste that sort of hinders the ""apple-y-ness"" of this beer (Is it really beer?) but... on the plus side, they go down pretty fast & after a two or three of them in the morning, who cares?"
"However, after giving it our hardest and deciding to dump it down our semi-clogged drain, the drain is no longer clogged! I suppose it does have some use after all."
"Found this in my local store's bargain cart (no bins, only carts...yes, shopping carts), so I figured I'd give it a shot for the hell of it.  It pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of short-lived dirty-white foam.  The nose comprises bushels of apples: some of them seemingly artificial, some seemingly genuine; some sweet, some sour-leaning.  Cider style, baby.  The taste brings in more of the same, a hint of booze occasionally making itself evident.  There's a bit of corn syrup foundation-ing the situation as well, if you catch my drift.  The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slick feel.  Overall, not a bad vehicle for booze delivery, really; thoroughly reminiscent of a thicker-than-usual cider and totally drinkable."

"And NO, I've got no remote fucking affiliation with the company... I know what you cock suckers are like so don't even think you can dismiss my review that way - fuckin' shaft swallowers!"
"Overall: Again, not the worst thing ever. It's just not beer by any stretch."
"I'm very picky with my beer. I do not like most hoppy flavors of beer that fills you up quick. Also many beer makes me burp real bad. My usual staple is Yuengling, but for a beer that's nothing like a beer, I absolutely love redds wicked."

"I live in delaware and this stuff sells out all the time. This is the best stuff around.my friends and i all love it."
"Nasty just plain nasty. Taste like perfume. Don't buy"
"People that rate it poorly are snobs. It's darn refreshing. (This coming from a craft beer snob - I make an exception for Redd's)"
"Poured from a 10 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of apple juice. Taste is apples, sweet, some alcohol is present. Feels light in the mouth and overall I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. A notch of other Redd's beers I have had."
"High alcohol content is the only thing going in here. Gross."
"O: eh....."
"Refreshingly Hard!  No surprises here."

"Overall this is pretty much apple juice and Everclear."
"It's not a bad summer beer, even if the fruitiness makes it seem a lot more like a cider."

"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-four ounce aluminum can, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Overall (3.18) : This is proof a beer doesn't have to be world class in every category (or even one) to be enjoyable. This is an example of a beer that I enjoy that is absolutely mediocre (or less) in every category. It's very sweet and sour at the same time, while maintaining an alcoholic burn. It's better than A/B's Lime-A-Ritas."

"Pours a pretty amber in color with no head but does have some spotty lacing. The aroma is of fresh apples and lots of them with some malt liquor as well. Pretty much same for the taste ,nice and crisp. Not as sweet as you might think, but good. Lighter bodied with good carbonation. Goes down way to easy Overall, it was tasty and sometimes you are in the mood for a cider. :D"
"I like to change it up now and then with some low brow brew.  I also enjoy cider, which this is meant to mimic.  Okay plus, for what it is.  I would pick this over regular Redd's Apple ""ale""."

"So, all that being said, it actually is somewhat enjoyable.  It's definitely more of a hard cider than an ale like it claims to be, and I'd prefer Angry Orchard or original Redd's, but it's not that bad.  The taste is actually very good; sour and crisp, the aftertaste is just a bit much.  It's like they injected extra alcohol into each can just for the sake of high schoolers who want something cheap to get drunk on.  But I'd buy it again if it was on sale."
"I wanted to write a review for this because I felt that many people prior had the assumption that this drink is something that it is not. Clearly, we cannot compare this Redd's to Heady Topper or any other traditionally brewed beer for that matter, but it really succeeds at doing what it has attempted to do. Plainly, this is an unoffensive and easy drinking alternative to traditional beer. I really can't get over the fact that people keep deriding this due to the fact that it is too ""sweet"" since it actually has the same or less calories per abv than other options in its alcohol class. Consequently, I would categorize this ""sweetness"" as more of a sour taste, and I think it is much more comparable to a granny smith apple taste than a traditional red. In the end, when I want to switch things up from drinking multiple craft beers, this Redd's provides great taste while very effectively masking its high alcohol content. It is by no means perfect, but I would certainly reach for a Redd's over any of the myriad of competing adjunct lagers considering that it effectively brings a unique change of pace to the table."

"Poured into a fancy tulip glass. Clear light amber color. No head at all. Smells like apples soaked in everclear. Taste like apples. I actually enjoy this. Not kidding. Perfect getting drunk drink. Don’t really consider it a beer though."

"Not much ""ale"" to it - a candy apple malt liquor character is pretty much what it is.  I scored with ""what it is"" in mind, and still was less than impressed.  It's more of a sweet malt beverage than a beer, in my opinion."

"Really not too bad at all. 8% abv but I can barely taste the alcohol. Color is a pretty nice light gold with some tannish/light brown hues. No head or lacing. Smell is of straight apple cider. Taste is bold and hits you quickly with a crisp apple cider / sweet apple juice flavor. As I said, can barely taste the alcohol. The carbonation is a bit high and the MF is a bit thin,l other than that it's pretty decent. Probably will buy again."

"Tastes like a tasteful orchard of tasty Appleness. I am no drinker of apple brews as of the late trend to be that has revived the lost apple cider trend that has died and rotted away, seemingly in a deserving fashion. I am just not. But this. This affordable concoction delicious perfection. It is good...As the drinker of ailments that I am, I've offered a little of my time to this ""trend of sorts"" to see what these ciders and ales bring to the table. Most have disappointed and sickened me, including wasted my time and money that could've been merely doubled for a hopsy I.P.A. Then I picked this one up at a gas station. 2.37$. It was warm. Put it on ice. It tastes like a tangy Apple Cider. That is what it should taste like. If you drink Apple Cider, do you feel anything but loneliness and high blood sugar?? Then don't expect much more with this witchly brew of high. It is cheap apple couch syrup that is satisfying to anyone who is sick minded enough to try it and even sicker to complain about it."
"Not likely to be purchasing again."

"Overall – A super sweet (on the somewhat cloying side) hard cider with the lightest touch of ale (and I mean very light).  Just a sweeter, boozier and more cidery version of the original Redd’s.  Redd’s x 1.5."

"Overall, why is there a market for this why wouldn't Miller just make a real cider...the apple ale craze will be short lived like hard lemonade and spiked tea."

"Redd's Wicked ale pours an off red color with no head, and a lot of bubbles. There is a mellow apple like aroma. The taste is very sweet, with a very candy like a fake apple flavor. Nicely carbonated but awful flavors come through. Overall it has a lot of fake flavors, and is more offensive then anything."
"Redd's Wicked Ale will inevitably have its haters, but frankly, this is an appetizing offering, far more successful at delivering what you'd expect than the new Bud Light Lime Apple-Ahhh-Rita. While its thickness and high-sugar content may hinder ones choice in a second or third beverage, unlike with the brand's traditional line, there's little to complain about here. A solid offering and a respectable contributor to a brand I hope continues to grow with the promise it bears early on."
"Publix had 2 24 oz cans for 3 bucks. How can you pass that up? I didn't see the 8% ABV till I got home, so I let them chill for 2 days. I poured half a can into a Samuel Adams glass, it looked dark amber and smelled like sweet apples. Taste was like a thickish apple juice. A little too sweet and thick for me. I guess that masks the alcohol. One can was enough. I won't be buying any more as I like a lighter, less sweet apple cider or ale. This would go with spicy Szechuan or Mexican food."
