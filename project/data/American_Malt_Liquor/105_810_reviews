"Very light in color definitely cheap by its taste but not as bad as some other malts that I've had. Very good if you want something cheap to take on a fishing or camping for the week end but is also not bad for the price"
"Not as bad as I thought going in. No reall offensiveness and the booze is hidden, it doesn't taste like much at all, but that gets boring real quick. I can see why people buy these i wonder if the others will have more flavor for better or worse, can't be as bad as stone 11/11/11."

"Get Stung! Drank a couple pints today for old times sake. Still does the job and I feel is one of the tastier Malt Liquors. First time I had it in a 16 oz. can so that was cool."

"DAFUQ! WHY? Once the alcohol destroys your palate, it allows you to get past the chemicals used to make this atrocity. Once the alcohol hits your brain you tend not to give a shit. Low 5.6% abv? I had two 8%ers yeasterday and i didntmfeel this buzzed. Must be the impurities giving me instant hangover? I Hate You Miller!"

"I don't know why Mickeys has such a low rating. I like it."

"A lot of low ratings but I like this one once in awhile"

"Nice change of pace (from time-to-time) away from the IPA's and spiced-up stuff.  I lived off Two Dolla' Foties of St. Ides, back in college, for f**** sake!!!! So Mickey's is like--Dom Perignone for me!!!"

"I feel like Mickey's fools me twice when I drink it. I get fooled once by getting tricked into those dumbass riddles they put on the caps. I get fooled twice because I end up drinking the malt sludge in the grenade because I feel stupid for not figuring out the phrase ""butter face.""

"DATE TASTED: October 10, 2014... GLASSWARE: Ommegang pokal... OCCASION: O's in the ALCS for the first time since 1997--probably the last time I drank Mickey's... APPEARANCE: brassy golden body that matches the translucence of water; snow-white sudsy head fizzles to a sickly residual; vibrant bubbles at the pour evaporate immediately... AROMA: pitchy, astringent malts; its appeal is purely in the twist cap nostalgia.. PALATE: fizzy, rather oily and sift; gassy, beefy aftertaste; thin and drinkable....TASTE: puckerishly sweet, with a water hose copper coupling overbearing flavor;; some champagne (!) notes; simply not flavorful ... OVERALL: Mickey's will always have a place in my heart--and on our college pong table--but this is a rough one to sip with any sustained interest..."

"I'm Irish   but find not Celtic  about this hot mess in college I drank this because it was cheap and I like to crunch beer cans"
"Surprisingly tasty for a malt liquor."

"This pours a clear, yellow color with a slight foamy head. The aroma is mild with cheap grains and yeast. The taste is smooth, flat and surprisingly flavorful for a cheap malt liquor. There’s weak grains throughout and finishes fairly crisp and clean. After a while the aftertaste takes on a bit of an awkward finish but overall fairly decent for its style."
"Rating is propbably higher than it deserves but I have fond memories of sitting in a boat on the lake sipping Mickeys out of their old big mouth bottles. Ah memories.."
""
""
"Best enjoyed with the brown bag from the liquor store still wrapped around it... Ah high school memories... I am not drinking one now as I review it, nor would I ever again, because I learned my lesson all those years ago - cheap, foul tasting, and guaranteed to get you from zero to wasted in no time flat... Though it might be considered by many King of malt liquor, that is not exactly a title to be proud of... That's like being crowned King Turd of Poopopolis on the planet Craptune... Congrats I guess...?"

"I first had this about 1970. It had an aluminum flat cap with a pull tab on the green grenade bottle. I had to bump the rating especially for the appearance. The lacing is very impressive."

"Mickey's brewed by Miller Brewing Co. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. This brew has some small lace on the side of the glass. Overall, this this not a bad brew for being a malt liquor. The beer goes down smooth , nothing bad about this brew. This brew is more like a American Lager than a Malt Liquor. This brew also has a different after taste- it reminds me of jalapeno pepper juice. I'm not saying that is a bad thing; that is what makes this brew different from the rest."

"O-A refreshing malt liquor with enough booze packed in at 5.6%. Purchase level is on a blue moon basis, once a year if that. Beer that can't be paired with food and isn't interesting or tasty enough to sit down and consume on its own. Just chug it away."
""
""
""
""
"Now this is a good go to malt liquor even though its on the low end of the ABV comparing it to the new high gravity/malt liquors such as hurricane and the steel brewing company.. This is one of a kind and Its a winner all around for a decent price. 7 dollars for a 12 pack after tax, so what if your friends drink that fancy stuff like MGD or High Life, Budweiser, Coors! Dont let it bother you if you want to bring it to a party and dig in! Keep it real! with Mickeys Malt Liquor!"
""
"Final Thoughts: With a slogan like ""Mickey's - Get Stung"" I was really expecting this to be an awful, high ABV solvent, get you drunk as cheaply and quickly as possible beer. However, what I found was really a cream of the crop stronger, adjuct lager that was done exceptionally well. There's honestly not a lot I can find fault with on this one."

"As you can see from the label, Mickey’s is “Fine Malt Liquor”. So imagine a scenario where your buddy offers you a beer, while apologizing, saying something like, “Sorry. All I got is Mickey’s”. You might hesitate, knowing full well it isn’t the best tasting beer around and it will probably give you a headache before the night is over. But then, remembering the label, you can shrug your shoulders, extend your arm to grab yours and say, “It’s fine.”"
""
"Enjoyed in the iconic wide-mouthed green bottle with riddle: ""2 + picture of a hen + a picture of two animals that look like either cats or pigs + a picture of a winged insect"" ... A fly! Got it! Extremely pale (just barely yellow) and uber-carbonated malt liquor with a sweet dank malt aroma like an old grainery full of corn husks. Ample corn on the nose is followed by the same on the palate, very sweet like old corn or corn syrup. A little fruity as well, maybe some almost vanilla-like floral notes. Extremely thin bodied and recalls soda water in this regard. Finish also pretty sweet with no discernible hop presence and a few fusel aromatics ... Not as much of the latter as higher ABV malt liquors. In all honesty this is not horrible if you realize beforehand what this beer style is supposed to embody: A sweet alcoholic tasting fizz bomb for mass consumption. I am tempted to try a Colt .45 now."

" Pours a clear golden-yellow with a 2+-finger white foamy head. Left lots of lacing when sipped. Good carbonation. The aroma was of grains with a light 'skunky' smell. The taste was better than the smell and wasn't as harsh I thought it might be for a 'malt liquor."

"Every now and then at a summer bbq, someone pulls out a Mickey's Big Mouth from the way back machine. Had a lot of these in the 80's and have always been impressed with their ""ahead of their time"" innovated bigger mouth format. Hard to session this but always fun to drink and hey, @ $4 a 6pk who could go wrong."

"Mickey's grenade was my first beer, ever. To this day, my pals and I call this ""skunk beer"". The smell is awful; I guess that's what makes it unique. The taste is malty and thick and hits you like a brick. Couldn't drink more than 3 at a time, but looked forward to an inexpensive, cold beer at the end of a hard day's work. If you're looking for a unique, cheap beer that has it's own smell and flavor... look no further."

"Mickey's ---1.5/5"
""
""
"In my opinion, this is the smoothest and most flavorful malt liquor available in my area. I like to carry one of these around uptown Butte on St. Patrick's Day, or pick up a tall boy at my local convenience store on a hot day, while painting or mowing the lawn."
""
""
"Really liked this beer. Very flavorable I can appreciate. Not like other high rated beers that have a very tart taste. Bought the 40oz bottle just to try. Thought I'd taste then throw it out. The price was so low. Wrong!!! Just the right amount @ 40 oz. and a flavor I enjoy."

"Probably one of my favorite Miller beers that was a popular and inexpensive drink choice back in our college days. Malt Liquor is not for everyone, but when I drink these beers from the widemouth “Green Grenade"" I tend to lose count. Overall Mickey's has a mild sweet taste, some mild hops, low bitterness, high carbonation, and there’s a slight graininess to the palate that lingers into the finish. On football nights when friends come over they tend to pick out these beers over the higher rated ones."

"Above average head retention for a malt liquor, its still yellow and clear but almost looks like a real beer. bit of corn in the nose but pretty faint. Pretty modest taste with no hop presence ( as expected). Easy to drink as long as its cold. Not sure who would drink this all the time."
""
"The best thing about Mickey's is its cool shaped, green bottle with the wide mouth. As for the beer ... meh. It's harmless, virtually tasteless American beer. Refreshing and light. Certainly nothing fancy. If offered one, I'd take it. Put it in a blind taste test with PBR, Coors, Red Stripe, or a half a million other similar beers, and I could not pick it out."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a great beer by any means but one of the best malt liquors out there. More flavor than many macros and cheap to boot. Worth picking up if you are drinking on a budget."

"O - Overall, This beer was completely one dimensional. One smell, One flavor, And a mouthfeel that follows. Oh well, I only paid $1.25 for a 24oz can and I had to eventually review such terrible brews so that I can give even greater appreciation to the better beers out there. Will I buy it again? Absolutely not. i dreaded finishing this stuff so much that I actually elected to pour the remaining 18 ounces down the sink."
""
"Note: I review for the style. I refuse to let my prejudices slant any review. Nothing worse than the typical beer snob reviewing a Malt Liquor, same for your Malt Liquor drinker reviewing a craft brew."
""
""
"I'm finishing off a Mickey's 40 as we speak. It's just what I needed after a long day at work. The last few sips are still ice cold...and it doesn't disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- okay heres the kicker with this Mickeys. It's actually not bad for the price. If you want to get loaded for not a lot of money I'd probably go Mickeys. Beer pong yes. Drink with a fine meal, no. In its price bracket, this is a personal favorite. I would take this over ice house, natty, Coors, miller or any other low priced beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours rather pale golden with thin white head of bubbles. Nose is light, clean, with a hint of citrus. More noticeable when drinking from widemouth bottle, oddly enough. Light cereal grain on nose too. On the palate there's a spritzer/sparkling water character to it with light malt flavors and slightly herbal to metallic hops. Some bitterness. Thin bodied. Goes down easier than water."

"Rating 3.5 as a Malt Liquor. Mickey's is the way to go for cheap."

"tastes more like a Heineken than a malt liquor...if Heineken is your bag...you may want to give Mickey's a try...just dont let it get too warm. If youre new to or want to try your first malt liquor....i definitely recommend Mickey's"
"O: Mickey's is best out of glass: 12 oz. or 40 oz. I don't know what it is about cans but it seems to ruin what flavor and characteristic there is. I've had some amazing tasting Mickey's before, but not this one. Considering how mass produced this is and how cheap it is there may be some variation from batch to batch as well. Mickey's is available pretty much everywhere making it an inoffensive choice when nothing else seems appealing. In the malt liquor world the low 5.6% ABV and higher than average price make this an amateur's choice."
""

"Overall – This is a rather middle ground malt. It doesn’t have the bad aftertaste that many malts have, but it is also lacking in some of the warming and more heavy malt liquor corn and boozy tastes that you would expect with a malt. When I am looking for a malt, I likely would not take this one, but it may be for some."

"I just recently purchased a 12- pack of mickeys just for the hell of it. I had never had it before so I figured I would give it a try since im a big fan of malt liquor. I was relatively please with it especially for the price. I paid about 10.99 + tax for a 12- pack so its a cheapy. The color was quite normal to any other malt liquor of its category as well as the smell. The taste how ever was very yeasty which I didn't really prefer. I don't recall any terrible after tastes. My only complaint is the over whelming flavor of yeast."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is actually pretty easy to drink. Though I don't really care for it, it's not as bad as I was expecting. If you want to have a cheap easy beer to drink, I for sure recommend this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – There is a lot of taste going on here, unfortunately that's not a good thing in this case. It's very malt heavy and comes across as harsh. I actually got the bottle from a few girls at at a Christmas party who were all drinking this. They said they liked the bottle and the riddles under the cap."

"Picked up a forty of this, my usual budget savers, bud and yuengling, needed a rest. So here it is, poured into a pilsner glass, very pale with pee color tint. One minute one finger head, notable amt. of rising bubbles. Avg appearance for the style. Sweet smelling, malt and a hint of alcohol. Not much to say taste wise but at least it isn't unpleasing. Tastes like the first beer I sipped from my dad's can as a child. It's refreshing, and a little sharp. I'll probably make this a regular when I buy forties since it actually resembles what beer is supposed to taste like, as opposed to 90% of the bottled garbage juice in that same cooler."

"I was kind of afraid of this beer. But I was pleasantly surprised. I might actally get this one again."
"Overall: Probably the best malt liquor available. If you're looking to get messed up cheap, buy this. It also isn't half bad just to drink!"
"bought these because of the hand gernade style bottle and the riddles under the caps. that's the only unique thing about this beer and probably the most enjoyable. poured these into a pint glass and got what was expected. clear golden in color with a tiny white head that recedes into a cap rather quickly. tastes and smells like sweet malts and grains. no hops presence is in either. the second best part of this beer is the mouthfeel with a medium to full body and a sweet creamy feel. overall not impresed but not totally turnrd off either."
"So the taste, it's a regular beer taste. It's enjoyable and doesn't over power with a liquor sting. It's the indulgence you have to hold on to. The six pack is affordable but willing grants access to inebriation. If you're going to ""roll"" with a malt liquor, this is the selection for that night."
"T: If I had to describe the taste of this in two words, those two words would probably be ""lime"" and ""metal."" It's actually better than most malt liquors out there, but as it warms, it just starts to taste like piss that's been aged in a rusty metal tank."
"Very light for a malt liquor in both taste and Alchohol, This was the go to beer in College, Try if you want a lighter, drinkable malt liquor In a cool green barrel bottle. Love the Big Mouth"
"O: This is a smooth drinking, decent flavored product for a great price. This has to be one of the best things Miller makes, and the puzzles under the caps are always entertaining."
"Pours out clear medium yellow. Head is white and foamy and stays around for a long time. Seeing a bit of lacing as well. Carbonation is also evident. Streams up tiny bubble can be seen. Corn and other grains are present in the nose. Also there is a mix of lemon and grass through the middle that is not half bad. Finish is clean with little lingering smells. Sweet corn and grains mainly with grassy undertones. Fairly simple. Taste a lot better cold. I'm noticing as its warming the low quality ingredients become apparent. Mouth feel is smooth enough although carbonation is lacking some. Could use a bit more bubbles. All in all this probably one of the better malt liquors Ive come across. Not offensive at all and a good representation of the style."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 2 inch stark white head that fades to a small cap. Random streaks of lace form here and there on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains and corn flakes. There is a slight buttery smell to this beer as it warms. Taste is of grains and corn flakes. Very crisp and clean with a good level of carbonation. Overall, a pretty average beer but not bad for what it is."
"The taste is not at all bad. It has a good, clean, classic malt liquor taste. I don’t know why I used to think this was overly sweet. It’s really not. It’s plenty dry. It’s got a pleasant pungent quality I like too. Still, it’s no OE. OE brings malt liquor to a whole new lever of flavor and this one is really lacking in comparison. It’s far more interesting and enjoyable than a King Cobra, though. As simple as it is, it’s got enough of that pungent cheap grain malt liquor taste to pull it a bit ahead of some other malt liquors. It’s dry enough. Really wondering why I always thought it was sweet. It’s just sorta boring. Mouthfeel is very dry and crisp for a malt liquor. Pleasant if you like that, but I’m usually looking for something danker in my malt liquor."
"Very light for a malt liquor in both taste and ABV; I think of this more as a macro lager. Anyways, it's an okay beer, no outstanding features but not offensive either. Only try if you want a lighter, drinkable malt liquor."
"Final verdict: meh. Starts off merely inoffensive and goes downhill from there. I'm not sure whose tastes this is made for, tbh, since it appears to be a malt liquor that doesn't even signify itself as such in terms of character."
"Really for a very, very cheep malt liquor, this stuff ain't half bad. I haven't noticed a big difference between bottles and cans, the quality control is obviously good. An excellent beer for drunken frat boys or for when you're scrounging for quarters in the seats of your car."
"D - This stuff has one purpose and one purpose only: to destroy brain cells and get you trashed. Terrible stuff, yet highly effective. Actually probably the best of the major malt liquors."
"O=I enjoyed this glass, but don't really see this as a session beer...just too sweet in my estimation."
"Drinkability overall its a step above your common domestics so about an average beer"
"Final thought - For the genre I like this beer, outside of the genre, this beer is for bums"
"Overall I think this tastes better than a lot of premium American Lagers I'd probably choose this for a hot muggy night on the deck."
"My uncle introduced me to Mickey's a few years ago. One new years eve he got a case and we sat around drinking them trying to figure out the guessing game on the bottle caps. The beer might not be the greatest but at least they give you something to do while drinking it. Anyway it pours just like any other American adjunct lager I've had with a yellow body and A white head. The head fades and leaves us with sweet smelling brew. The beer tastes alright and doesn't have a bad aftertaste at all. It was a drinkable brew thankfully and it helped bring in the new year!"
"Served in the quintessential 40 oz bottle, Mickey's is still one of my favorite malt liquors. Pale in color and sweet corn in taste, I still drink it(once in a great while) on hot New England Nights, because it drinks better than bud light, and bud light sucks and its cheaper than Brooklyn summer or sierra nevada summerfest"
"O - It goes down like water, with a buzz."
"One of the best malt liquors out there. In short, House of Pain was right. But only for real men. Beer snobs need not apply here."
"Pours an atrociously huge head, completely white, three fingers in length. The body is completely yellow, so much carbonation I can't even think strait; completely see through as well. The head looks frothy and nice, but it's already disappearing, it is leaving nice lacing though. Confusing look overall, because all the aspects are horrible accept for the lacing and the head are pretty damn nice. I don't detect too much skunk on this beer, which is good considering it's out of a green bottle, but then again I don't smell much period. There is a gross sour, adjunct malt smell, and maybe the slightest hint of hop in there somewhere. It just smells boring, it smells boring and watery. Wow, that's a pretty horrible taste, I get this huge gross malt taste, just full of adjuncts and other crap, that is mixed in with water, and with a slight alcohol taste. One thing that surprises me about this is how not crisp it is, that's usually one redeeming factor for these adjunct beers, but this isn't even crisp or that refreshing. The only thing I can really say that is good about the taste is that all the flavors are blended well together, but none of them are good flavors, so...yeah. It gets easier to drink as you get closer to the bottom of the glass, but that's not going to save this beer from a bad rating. The mouthfeel is ok for a malt liquor, but pretty damn light overall, not too impressive there. One thing I can say is that this beer is incredibly easy to drink, I don't know what it is but it just goes down and before you know it the glass is gone. Overall, not a horrible beer in terms of adjunct lagers, but there are some areas that are god awful."
"O - pretty good for the style."
"Overall - definitely not the worst malt liquor I've had, but not interesting at all in taste."
"Overall this beer is good because it tastes good and you only need 2 or 3 to feel a buzz."
"As impressive a malt liquor as this is, I still don't give a Schlitz for Mickey's."
"Overall not too bad as far as malt liquors go. Again, I'm sure not many could tell the difference between this and a Euro Pale Lager in a blind lineup. Decent and a good surprise."
"O/A- Damn good ""For the style"""
"If you can get past the stigma attached to malt liquors in general, and give this an honest go...you may find you like it...or love it!"
"Taste is similar with some citric sweetness attached to a bready malt base. Fair amount of texture to the feel, and again lacking any obvious adjunct notes. Not all that bad but not quite Old English either."
"Watery yellow color. Sweet smell of corn and hops. Flavor is not too awful, watery and slightly bitter. Felt ok in the mouth, respectable. Slightly drinkable, and refreshing in a strange way. If you must drink malt liquor, make yours a Mickey's grenade. It's by far the best one out there. Just be careful how many you have, it's a doozy."
"Drinkability - Pretty drinkable for a malt liquor. Then again malt liquors probably aren't exactly the drink of choice of beer sophisticates. Keep in mind I am grading within style. Not bad, not good - unless you plan on getting drunk."
"Beer is medium in body and has an odd bitterness at the finish...and here comes the boiled corn aftertaste. Bummer, you really let me down Mickeys. I was hoping for so much more. At least the aftertaste is short lived. I can say that much for it. It's drinkable, more so than the others, just not very good tasting."
"Taste is fairly smooth for what is is. Pretty drinakable. I'm ready to crown this the best cheap non-craft malt liquor."
"And, thus, following the good stuff, Swill Fest 1.5 kicks off, complete with a viewing of Human Centipede. This offering pours a clear straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, corn, and hay wet with the runoff from some dark, murky bog in the old English countryside, the kind of thing you'd see in some rustic Gothic throwback tale. The taste holds notes of corn, corn syrup, and a heaping helping of bad apple juice. Up until now, I was unaware that apple juice could go bad in this manner. now I think it could be a possibility. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I think this gives yet another reason for why malt liquors don't get any real respect: They don't really deserve much."
"This beer pours a clear golden orange with a white foam that doesn't last long. The smell is pretty mellow, some concentrated malt notes of course. I really don't mind the smell it's sweet on the nostrils. The taste is bitter and rancid. Though it's not so much horrid as just not really that pleasant. The mouthfeel is decent as is the drinkability of this beer. For an AML it's pretty darn good, otherwise I wouldn't choose to drink it."
"It's chuggable...and I may just do that with the rest of the can."
"The best of all American malt liquors, being perhaps the only drinkable 40 oz bottle in the United States. The beer is skunky, high carbonation, has a great taste for being so skunky, and is very cheap. I think almost everyone on this site has had this beer at least once, probably as a teen or college kid."
"Pretty poor quality malt liquor, nothing I would drink again."
"Overall: An improvement of King Cobra, but it's still not enjoyable. This was an old bottle though."
"Poured out of ""grenade"" bottle with a yellow-gold body, and ~3/4 inch head which dwindles to almost no head. Smells of slightly metallic, cooked vegetable with a trace of ethanol. Tastes not too special, kind of creamy in a wierd way. I pick up flavours of adjunct, corn and an alcohol. Has a dry finish. Overall, not a spectacular beer. It is kind of fun because of the bottles but really nothing special."
"A foamy finger of bone-white head with decent retention, initially. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity, allowing me to look through the walls into the neighbor's doings. Nose was comparably sweet with some of the high ABV offerings of today, but with a none-too-subtle cereal quality mixed in. Mouthfeel was effervescent and scrubbing to the point that I felt like I had a new palate. I kid you not, this was a very pleasant diversion after today's skull-ripping. It was plenty sweet with a lot of adjunct characteristics, but it was also a beer that I felt comfortable sitting with in front of the TV. There was nothing off about it, despite its being in a GREEN (oh, no!) bottle, but either pasteurization or good handling or both kept it that way. YMMV. Finish left me simply craving a Hammond's-brand hard pretzel to cut some of the cloying sweetness. Would I drink this again? Heck, yes! Would it be my first choice? Heck, no! Was it cost-effective/worthy? Yep. What would my back alley homies say? Hey, I've hung out and imbibed with them enough to the point that they call me ""Pittsburgh"" and don't throw their empties in my yard, instead leaving them hanging in a bag on the fence for me to collect and recycle. They'd applaud me. I applaud you."
"D: Tried it in college, didn't like beer back then, and now that I love beer, this is awful. Can't believe I went back and retried this beer from the past."
"D: Hey it's bad, but it's not the worst. A little hard to drink, but what do you expect. This was a once in a lifetime purchase. I'd always rather spend more money or drink water."
"D: Eh, not as easy to drink as it used to be (""back in the day""). Still, there are definitely worse malt liquors out there."
"I am growing old waiting for this head to dissipate. Huge white head of ice cream like bubbles that about filled up my pub glass. Lace from the top of the glass to the head, that has still not gone down. The color on the other hand is a light amber rating a 5 on the SRM chart. Smells like malt..really, and yeast, with a little wet corn. The taste is a bland mixture of wheat, barley, corn and yeast that dries out my mouth. Most of the zing went into the head, so there is not much mouthfeel but that of flat soda water. I like the bottle which is green and looks like a barrel with a screw cap, but I would not go out of my way to get another."
"Ok. Pours a yellow straw color with a thick soapy white head (don't you just love soap n' beer?) and zero lacing. Smells like booze and corn, rice, random grain they may have thrown in. Tastes malty sweet with with some odd hop undertones. Mouthfeel is pretty thin. Drinkability is not the worst."
"Pours a pale golden brew with a full white crown. No alchol taste or scent. Nice barley and sweet malts. Crisp refreshing and smooth taste. Nice aftertaste."
"Gets the job done, but nothing to be impressed with"
"Pretty easy to drink. One of my favorites in college."
"overall not bad at all, i have had much, much worse an might do this one again on a whim."
"Easy to drink and not as foul as other malt liquors.."
"ps. Prob. my favorite malt liquor... used to drink alot of it back in the day!"
"D - I raise this grenade in honor of my late friend Ben who, in college, used to drink these all weekend. With no disrespect intended towards Ben, I'll gladly pour this one out for him. I won't be drinking it."
"D: not to over powering flavor and simple mouthfeel make for a easy drinker"
"D- Does what is intended. Put these back in mass consumption. Leaves a little sweetness on the tongue. Probably couldn't differentiate this from other malt liquors."
"Reminds me of the Les Miserable song Master of the House, ""Thinks he's quite a lover, but there is not much there."""
"Drinkability was great! I drank the whole 40 ounce in about twenty minutes"
"The thing I don't really understand is what qualifies this as a malt liquor, and not an American Adjunct Lager, besides marketing. The ABV doesn't seem high enough, the carbonation level isn't high enough, and there aren't any fusel alcohol notes present."
" D- This beer is light but not clean. The tartness and corn and apple flavors are very pronounced and become a bit more obnoxious with each sip."
"D: As always, poundable, completely enjoyable, and will get you buzzed for the right price, as for something to savor, find something else. Pansy."
"A classic right here. Drink Malt Liquor."
"Worth the $1.07 for a 24oz can."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium too. This isn't a bad malt beer, it is slightly watery and the corn flavor is a little too much. I am glad I got to try it."
"WOW! This is close to that warm beer that you accidently picked up in the fridge instead of the cold one. It is an April fool's joke from the April beer club that I am part of with a local store, and I was hoping, and keeping an open mind, that this malt liquor might clear one hurdle. It falls face down in the race of any category in beer or brewing, bar none!"
"Overall I used to down 40's of this stuff like it was water. Now I'm lucky to finish the 12 oz grenade."
"Cheers!!"
"Perfect for the summer, Mickeys never really gets old to me- grew up with this."
"not quite sure why this beer has a cult following it's just another bland average lager"
"RJT"
"pours a pale straw, cold and clear, with a frothy two finger that clears out quickly. smells of strong sour grains, very unsettling, corn adjunct, hay, grass, and flowery hops. best of the worst in my opinion. tastes grainy and yeasty, again full of corn adjunct. one of my favorite summer malt beverages, designed for outdoor use. it gives me high school nostalgia. really brings a smile to my face."
"D - If you're looking to get drunk, this is where it's at. Just don't look for a lot of taste. I've had this when I felt like telling myself I'm a broke badass, but I won't pick it up on my own when I have a few bucks to spare. Mickey's is an express ticket to heartburn and a lasting hangover."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"This stuff goes down easy, but after a few I got tired of the sweetness and wanted something more interesting, but if you're looking for something you can serve ice cold on a hot day, Mickey's isn't a bad choice."
"D - Still not loving malt liquors. I took my time on this one not to savor it or because of the high ABV - I just wasn't that interested it drinking more of it."
"I like it. Lots of people dis this fine Malt Liquor. I do not know . OK is it better than Colt 45 or Olde Englishe 800. I do not know."
"I so excited to be reviewing this quality beverage. I am not going to be pouring it into a glass, instead I will be drinking it directly from the 40 oz bottle. The narrow top 40 oz bottle I might add. No freshness date. First scents are of herbs and vegetables. After first chug, not bad tasting. Some minor herbs and somewhat funky after taste nothing offensive. But nothing outstanding. Pretty easy to drink. Good mouthfeel. All and all not bad for a couple bucks, should be pretty easy to finish. Probably one of the easier to drink malt liquors."
"Drinkability: hoo boy. I may or may not be able to finish this colossal can. I think I am more comfortable consuming malt liquor on a dare than with an eye toward genuine evaluation. Still, drinkability has to track flavor on this one."
"BUT I would drink this anyday over AB. Even in a can."
"D: Very drinkable, if you can stomach this stuff. I would only drink it if I were broke and higher gravity brews were unavailable."
"Overall drinkability: a smooth brew, when compared to the competition; quite possibly the perfect beverage for the industrial reserve army (★★★)"
"what can you say even a BMC makes these seem tasty. How many ways can you spell skunked. This is January and my bottle said November 30, 2009. A green bottle and out dated to boot. Skunked! I used to think this is what beer was supposed to taste like. Just one for old times sake. Certainly not for the taste. Oh yeah, the taste, did I mention skunked BMC? Well you get the idea..."
"this is pretty bad not matter how you go about it. the body is thin and weak the carbonation is the only thing that makes this drinkable. the appearance is still better than coors light. the taste is too grainy for words. at least the beer makes a good sized head that is white."
"D: I expected more of the malt liquor."
"Golden beer with a sumptuous thick white head on top. Retention is not great, but a solid coating remains on top and there is actually an impressive amount of lacing. Smells of grainy malts, touch of bitterness, no major off-notes. Tastes of some sweet malts and a moderate amount of bitterness that turns a tad plasticy and finishes with a bit of corny grains. Decent for malt liquor. Medium body with a high prickly carbonation. Too carbonated, but most malt liquors are way too carbonated. Drinkability is okay. Mickey's is basically the Cadillac of Malt Liquor... but the economy brand of beers are actually about the same price and taste better so I don't see much value in this brand."
"Packaging kitsch aside, this is an otherwise obvious future pass for me - and I don't even get to laugh it off as a cheap throwaway purchase - up here, this beer sells as a ""premium import"". Jebus, I can't wait to get to our dinner destination, where I at least get to overpay for wine, and its fringe benefits."
"Pale gold with a one finger hed and poor retention. Smells of cooked corn with some sweet malt. Nothing special here. The taste is worse than the smell. Water everywhere along with cooked corn and a poor attempt at malt sweetness. Yuck. Thin bodied, fair carbonation. Not a good mouthfeel, and not very drinkable. I split this with a friend at a get together last night, so it cost me nothing."
"Pretty smooth as the alcohol level is fairly low. A bit reminiscent of a bad cream ale. Body is light, as are the sweet grainy malt flavors. Hops are on vacation here. Not very good beer, drink it cold if you must."
"Nothing beats this classic in the Green Wide Mouth Bottle."
"Taste isn't the worst thing I've drank, but it's close. I guess it gets better the more you drink of it, and it is cheap . . . but all you can taste is the alcohol, which isn't even all that high. Brutal."
"The two strong points for Mickey's is the nice sweet corn taste and a smoothness that defies it's status as ""malt liquor"" (so what is barley wine?). You already know that it didn't really cost you anything, it's gonna do it's job, and you needn't feel remorse. Mighty satisfying when good n' cold on a nice hot day, or even in winter (alcoholic enough that you just won't confuse it with light beer). By the way, if you keep the bottle in the brown bag it came in while drinking it, it gives it nose (nice pulp smell)."
"D- Eh... I can drink a cold one, but would rather reach for something else. at 5.6%, this one isn't as heavy or as demanding as some other malt liquors. I can't say I'd buy it again, even at the incredible price point."
"Okay, why would anyone drink a Miller High Life when they could drink this?! It's cheap, smooth, has a good color and great malty taste. I don't consider this ""slummin' it", this is just good simple beer. Let's face it, if you're going to have beer for a football game with a bunch of typical beer drinkers, even Sam Adams would be considered snob beer. Not that I'm suggesting you succumb to peer pressure, but at least there's an alternative to Bud Light. Plus, this gives a VERY nice buzz."
"D: this is extemely drinkable. flows down to the gullet quick as you like. not a quality beer at all, almost devoid of flavor, but again oh so easy to drink. I guess it caters to a certain audience. WIll buy this again for times I want to slum it."
"Appearance is a light golden yellow with a thick crisp head and fair lace for a malt liquor. Smell is slightly sweet with corn, yeasty with hops. Taste has the adjunct flavor to it, a little metallic and stale hops. Mouthfeel is is light with a good amount of carbonation. Not one I would willingly buy again, it kinda left a light bitter metallic aftertaste I didn't quite care for."
"Due to no overpowering complexities, this beer is good for the swill, mowing the lawn, or BBQing."
"Instead, you get a rich profile of pleasant adjuncts with big nodes of corn and grain. This is balanced off with mundane hop essence. Nothing great but, honestly, I guess I just like the taste of beer."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Has a sweet, malty smell. Taste is rather bland, not bad, but not very flavorfull. Feels watery in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall an average malt liquor."
"Conclusion: I have a soft spot in my heart for this because of SLC Punk! Um...that's about all I can say about it, it's a drinkable malt liquor...that is all"
"Lets cut to the chase, this is a freaking Mickeys Malt liquor not a Westy 12. For a malt liquor this isn't all that bad. Lets face it, if you wanted something better you wouldn't have reached for the Mickeys in the first place, but what you get is solid. Malt liquor flavor without that nasty malt liquor after taste you get with most of them. This isn't gold people, but its pretty good when its free... in a 22oz bottle... who knew."
"It seems like you're really taking the slow option to getting crunked with this stuff, but I'd imagine it is less likely to produce severe hangovers."
"D: i think i could handle about one 40 a year, i like OE better"
"Pours golden yellow with nearly no head. Smells pretty clean, a little grainy, not too fuselly like a lot of malt liquors. Theres a bit of a corny finish to him, but its not overbearing. Highly carbonated. It tastes more like an American adjunct lager. My go to guy for 40s, goes good with McDoubles."
"Cinco de Mayo and I should have had something Mexican but instead I drank a Mickeys Fine Malt Liquor. The pour is pale yellow with a lot of bubbly carbonation and fizzy white head. The aroma has somethig slightly floral to it rather than malty. Watery mouthfeel and nothing special there. The taste has some vague hops to it but little in the way of malts as should be the case for a malt liquor. This is a get drunk beer and little more."
"D - Not so much, I regret having bought this although I would drink this compared to say a bud light. But I had to give it a shot."
"Not only do you get a nice buzz from this but if you get the grenades/hornets, the short fat 12ozers, the caps have picture puzzles that you can pass around to see who can figure it out."
"Cheers!"
"Not bad. I was expecting worse but this really isn't a bad example. It's drinkable for what it is."
"Drinkability: No thanks. It's a shame they redesigned the container, getting cut by those peel-back metal tabs was part of the fun."
"12oz green short bottle from Hannaford. Pours a light yellow crystal clear body with a half inch of short-lived white head. Smells like cereal grains, a touch of butter and hints of floral hops. Slightly sweet cereal grain, hints of caramel. Finishes very clean, as expected. Very light in body with ample effervescent carbonation. Super drinkable and really nothing objectionable about it - not even skunked despite the green bottle. One of the better malt liquors I have tried"
"Overall one of the better malt liquors i think it ranks right up their with old E"
"Out of a squat 12 fl. Oz. bottle this 'fine malt liquor' was a perfectly clear, light straw gold color. The head was off white, short lived and left spotty lacing. The aroma was actually decent, slightly sweet pale malt, stale malt and some corny grain. The flavors were also clearly sweetened to mask the alcohol. Still, for a malt liquor it was indeed fairly 'fine' pale malt, hints of hops and a general 'wet' grainy quality. The usual musty and stale characteristics were there, but underplayed. The mouthfeel was slightly above average but slick, the carbonation good and the body medium/light. Would I recommend it? In a pinch, yes. Better than most of its brethren and generally palatable."
"Drank straight from the wide-mouth, green stubby bottle - as it was meant to be. This beer is surprisingly not bad. I think there's some truth to the bottle's ""Fine Malt Liquor"" label. Because as far as malt liquor goes, this isn't that far behind Rogue fancy-pants Dad's Little Helper. In terms of flavor, this beer reminds me of a dull PBR. It just has gentle bready malts behind a vague sweetness. Completely drinkable and inoffensive. Worth a try, just because it's Mickey's."
"Oh Mickey's, how you remind me of High School! Grenade time. Pours a crystal clear yellow color with a large white head that left decent lacing, surprisingly. Aroma is all corn and adjunct with the lightest possible amount of hops, but still somewhat noticeable. Grainy and dry on the tongue, only hints of sweetness on the back end before turning dry again. Graininess and corn is about all there is to say about this one. It's not as good out of a glass as it is directly from the grenade. Probably the only malt liquor I can handle drinking."
"When it comes to drinkability, its a hit. One after another, this a great beer to take to a party and enjoy all night."
"D: I wouldn't even drink this if I just got done mowing the grass on 120 degree day."
"Pours a golden yellow with a two finger white head. Aroma is of barley and malt with some hops mixed in. Taste is malty and bitter, aftertaste is like stale cereal grains. Carbonated mouthfeel, but otherwise average texture. Not recommended as a session beer."
"Brain Grenades, the term we used to describe these funky green globes of potent power. Leave it to old friends to re-visit these dangerous beauties. Back in the day we used to slam these taking bets on who could finish the grenade in the least amount of ""sips"" regardless here I am and not much changes....Funky malt likka scent sweet and very grainy, appearance heh just keep it in the bottle which is sweeeet, tacky and sticky on the palate it bites ya, tastes like tomorrow's stale ale. Overall not a quality brew but a fun past time in certain circumstances."
"if you want to hammer a few malt liquors you can do this.. not my thing but cheap for college kids I guess."
"Tasted in the ""hand grenade"" bottle with the little puzzles on the cap while watching a UFC fight for the sole reason because Mickey's is one of their sponsors, and the hornet looks pissed. As far as Malt Liquors go, it could be worse and this one is surprisingly sweet. Reminds me of college."
"D: Very drinkable, priced right for the quick buzz. I'd much rather drink a few mickeys than any ice beer for a quick buzz. Mickeys truley is Fine Malt Liquor."
"12 oz ""grenade"" which I chose not to pour into a glass. Smells of corn and a little malt. The taste is of adjuct corn and rice. The mouthfeel is smooth for the style and this beer is very easy to drink. Overall this beer is quite refreshing and unoffensive."
"I survived the first stage without any major wounds. We'll resume the Brown Paper Bag Invite tomorrow night."
"Ok, I drank a lot of this stuff back in the 70s, along with a lot of imports and the few American brews that were tasty back then ie Ballantine XXX, Rainier Ale, Sierra Nevada, Anchor, New Albion(long since gone), others that escape my memory right now and I *still* like this darn Malt Liquor and I don't think it's changed much since it was a Heileman Brewing product. I like it and I'm not ashamed to admit it!"
"No need to put this one in a paper bag. For this style, it's very inoffensive and very drinkable. A kinder, gentler malt liquor. It has a smoothness to it, and the taste is more than tolerable - a bit too sweet. Not as aggressive as the stinging bee on the label would have it, but very drinkable and inoffensive for the style."
"D: An average malt liquor, but too pricey for the style. I got bored with this beer far to easily. At least it doesn't become undrinkable due to an alcohol character like some others of this style are."
"D- Drinks good enough to get me trashed very quickly"
"Overall a blast from the past that has some special place in my heart, but not special enough to relive those days. I have moved on to bigger and better beers but I won't soon forget those old times."
"Mouthfeel is light in body, but harsh in texture. It's a brainless and guilty pleasure."
"Wow, I can't beleive this was my drink of choice at times back in high school. Mostly due to a lack of knowledge i suppose. It is a golden color and smells like malt and alcohol. Not quality malt. The taste is not too bad, but not too good either. The body is fizzy to cover up off flavors. A bottle of this always made for a fun night and not much else. Except a bad morning."
"The taste is sweet, lightly corn-dominated grain with hints of apple cider sweet white wine. There is a definite, pleasant grain taste, especially in the long aftertaste. It has no bitterness at all and a very faint alcoholic spiciness."
"One of the biggest problems with reviewing Mickeys on a fine Beer Forward website like Beer Advocate is that to really review a beer, you have to pour it into a glass. This makes Mickeys loose a bit of its ambience. Nothings better than drinking a ice cold Mickeys tall boy or large mouth 40oz on a hot day or when you just want to get that Trailer Park feeling. So, with protest, I poured this tall boy into my Smokestack goblet and it came gushing out as a straw yellow with a big, fizzy white head. The aroma is sweet corn. The taste is a generic mild sweetness that sits easy on your tongue. I have always wished that Mickeys would come out with 12oz cans or at least 4 packs but alas, I don't think its going to happen. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, to the point where it tickles your tongue. I think this is a very drinkable malt liquor. Unlike some of the other major Malt liquor brands, Mickeys is palatable and easy to drink. They don't try to push the envelope in terms of alcohol just to get you drunk. I'm sitting outside on a nice day, throwing some washers while sitting in a chair, watching my dogs, and smoking a Black and Mild. This friend, is Beer Nirvana."
"""Short & Sweet"""
"D: The only redeeming quality of this stuff is that I can drink a lot of it, and a lot of it quickly. This is a great get drunk and be stupid beer."
"D: Decent for an old-school macro."
"To be honest, I kind of like the ""Crappy"" malt liquors. Many come in large sizes (40oz) and I can sit and enjoy a movie or other entertainment and unwind with them on the cheap. Overall, I've had other ML's that aren't as pleasant to drink as this one. Not too bad."
"D - It is what it is. An easy drunkin' brew without a lot of flavour but not really offensive either."
"That being said, either I got a special fresh batch, or Mickeys has actually gotten better over the years. I remember it being far more foul many many many years ago."
"D: you could definitely drink a few of these, especially for the price. However, I have a feeling that you would be making reservations for a pretty good headache the next day. Overall, there are worse malt liquors out there, so Mickey's gets my vote if you are in the mood for some malt."
"taste is not great but not offending. this is a light bodied and very easy to drink beer."
"Drinkability: Better than Olde English or a lot of other malt liquors. The best thing I could say is that I'd drink it over bud any day, but then I'd drink most things over bud any day."
"Now, even I think I'm crazy for giving a malt liquor a score over 2. But, there's two things to consider here. This malt liquor, compared to its peers, has less ABV, meaning that there is more water and less of a pungent taste. I don't really have to describe anything here, but it breaks down like this. Light gold color that you can see thru, the smell is not like paint thinner like an Old E or a Hurricane (yech!) but of a watery hop-substance, and the taste is somewhat foul but smooth. The other advantage that Mickey's has over the other malt liquors (and I am not talking about the goofy sayings on the cap) is the grenade bottle. For those who don't know, rather than the normal bottle which, on a guess, is 6 inches from bottom to start of neck and holds about 2 oz. each, this bat boy is 3 inches tall and there's 4 oz per inch. Oh, and the other reason it is called the grenade is because it's green (The bottle, not the beer). You end up drinking one in about 2 minutes, and then after about four or five a strong buzz creeps over."
"Not my cup of tea, but I know people enjoy this stuff."
"Just finishing college and having a lot of experince of horrible beer and esp. malt beer, this is prob my favorite, still it ranks low compared of the full flavors that are out there, if one has to drink a malt beer, then this is the beer you should have, its one of my favs plus in the cool glass bottles!"
"Opinion: This beer isn't too bad for the category it is in. The flavor is of course adjunct driven and is lacking in body. When compared to some other examples of malt liquor, this beer is pretty good. For that reason only, I will score this one a little higher because I would drink this malt liquor over just about any others I have tried. It is a rot-gut beer nonetheless, but it is a quality rot-gut not found in many other examples."
"Sometimes you just gotta go with a cheap beer. This one being some what of a staple in my leaner days. They have UFC collector cans now I see, hmm, ok. I don't think anyone would really keep a can after having drank it, but who knows. Yellow, fizzy, smells like sweet corn. Tastes like sweet corn, but finishes surprisingly clean. I don't wanna let this thing warm up much lest it start getting rank. Overall not bad for what it is - a cheap, non offensive, lower abv malt liqour."
"Hey if you wanna get drunk for $3, I can't think of a better way to do it."
"D: I've enjoyed this beer by the 40 oz. or by the big mouth 6 packs, either way, it goes down rather nicely for an American malt liquor. Bravo Miller. My dad weened me on Miller High Life. God bless Miller!"
"By the way, the chicken liked it. It came out, pretty good."
"Saw this way too many times during my college years."
"overall, this is a malt liqour, not high in alcohol for its style and really not that bad for its style, but im not a fan of its style"
"Pours a crystal clear staw hue with a frothy soap bubble head two fingers high. Good retention and a few specs of lacing. Mild Pils malt and corn aroma, with a hint of DMS scent. Sweet Pils and pale malt taste with some corny adjunct in the background. Mild apple ester in the aftertaste along with some mellow graininess, but the beer is fairy dry and the mouthfeel is mostly clean once these flavors fade. Medium-light in body, with high carbonation, and somewhat lighter than most malt liquors and much smoother. This was surprisingly good, but probably only because it fits somewhere between Malt liquor and american macro."
"Taste lasts long and is very drinkable as well"
"It was kind of what I expected,a watery tasting domestic beer.Very little carbonation and the taste gets worse as you get down to the bottom of the bottle.It's not horrible but there's nothing really good to say about it except the price.If your low on cash I guess this would be an ok choice."
"Ok so I bought a 40oz of this as a joke to bring to a party. After I poured one for my hommies I kicked back and went to town. It was not a good beer at all and it had a hint of corn and malt. The taste was very carbonated and obviously high in alcohol. Mouthfeel again carbonated and thin. I would never recommend this beer to anyone but it is fun to show up to a party with it!"
"This beer is just slightly better than the average macro lager, its still pretty insipid, just more malty. Not going to revisit, though Ill keep the bottle."
""
"D: One of the better malt liquor options out there, but it is rather pricey at 2.50 a 40oz bottle while other higher content 40s run almost a dollar or more cheaper, If you want the Cadillac of gas station malt liquor look no futher than Mickey's."
"Drinkability? Have you seen the mouth hole?"
"Not much to it. Worth a try, or to remember days past and get a cheap buzz, but not much else."
"would certainly be spending my hard earned coin on Old Milwaukee at roughly 60% the price before I buy more of this. Fitting it comes in a small gernade sized bottle as i can imagine you could get bombed drinking more than 6 in a night"
"12 oz big mouth bottle...for mass consumption obviously. used to love these as a teenager, these were primo to me then. typical macro lager in appearance and other respects. pale yellow but not as pale as bud, for example. some malt adjuncts in the nose- a corny, buttery sweetness which i used to find appealing. not much else. a little sweetness is present in the initial taste, creamy flavors. not much in the way of hops. balanced by the force carbonation. light in body and spritzy, although not as light bodied as most macros. drinkability is decent, i suppose the point of this beer is to drink a lot and get schlitzfaced. reminiscent of a slightly bigger version of little kings."
"Mickey's was pale yellow straw color and very clear. It had a white head that managed to hang around a little while before disappearing. There was not much to taste or smell, but was there was not bad. It was medium-light in body with fairly light carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's beer that is low on flavor but easy to drink."
"Overall, not too bad. The overall flavor isnt bad, but does seem very raw. the 5.6% gives it a nice fuller body that is creamy. Not a bad buy at 4 pints for $2.50, but not one i would buy often at all."
"D - Pretty damn good. I could session a few of these little green bastards...no problem."
"This is definatly not my Grandfather's Mickey's. Besides the strange new can with the weird bee (when I think beer, I think bee?) the taste seems a bit flat. I poured this brew into a standard pint glass and observed the pale yellow, almost straw color. The smell was typical and under-whelming, but really not an important aspect of this kind of beer. The taste was pretty good, much better than other malt liquors, strong sweet taste but counteracted by the bitter undercurrent. The mouth-feel was a bit more like a lager than I remembered, but ended up allowing me to enjoy it even more. All in all this beer is meant for drinking with friends on a nice summer evening while cooking up something on the grill, not for sitting in a room geeking out about. Easy to drink, easy to enjoy, but not for too steep of a critique."
"Drinkability: One could drink many of these if he did not desire flavor and complexity. I found it rather tasteless and boring. But I guess its a fine malt beverage, in someones eyes!"
"D: Easy to pound these little buggers. Nice opening for mass consumption, inoffensive taste. A decent thirst quencher on a hot day. Low ABV for a 40oz. type brew."
"Drinking this stuff is pretty easy , nothing you'll wanna puke on , simple because its a fine malt liquor and I recommend it too any beer drinker."
"It seem the bottle has changed also. I remember a bigger mouth."
"Overall: Not something I'd ever buy myself, but whatever. For a malt liquor it's decent, and drinking one you'd never know the ABV was over 5%. I'm not much into malt liquor, but this isn't half bad."
"Mickey's hand grenades appears pale golden yellow tone with a large bright white quickly dwindling head leaves even fine lacing around my glass. Aromatics have cereal tones with corn and rice pulling up a chair, and mild herbal grass notes as well. Flavors collide upfront with cooked veggies, herbal notes, mild sweetness, and a somewhat metallic note though it finishes relatively clean after all of that. Mouthfeel is light bodied pretty thin with unnatural carbonation that tickles the throat. Drinkability is one of those ghetto college staples that will always sell with or without a marketing campaign."
"As far as drinkability goes, this is quite decent for a malt liquor. It's decent tasting and goes down well. Don't be surprised if you feel light-headed or get rowdy."
"A good choice for a malt liquor, and at 5.6% ABV, it's easy to have more than one."
"Now, a couple of decades later I can say that Mickey's isn't bad for what it is. A cheap malt liquor. Not my first beverage of choice, but worth picking up to share with the ""uninitiated""."
"Drinkability - all depends. I will probably not buy this again for myself, but I will drink all 6 without a problem, keeping expectations realistic. This is a really cheap malt liquor designed to be more of an alcohol delilvery system than an attempt at a worthy malt liquor. I wouldn't drink more than one of these a night; just so you can have something else if you decide to have another."
"Poured a pale yellow color wioth modest initial white puffy head that was rapidly gone. Smell is minimal with only a slight sweetness to be found. Taste is sweet and crisp, and is OK when very cold, but slowly degrades as the beer warms. Finish is really a quick vanishing of any taste. Got to dink it quick while still cold."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"Mickey's can also be mixed with your best orange juice and served as a substitute to Mamosas. It's called a brass monkey and will be sure to wake you up."
"Poured a very yellow color with a thin retaining head. Immediatly smelled and tasted corn adjuncts. Tasted pretty sweet and malty. Not too bad for 1.50 a 40, definetly the better of the malt liqours. But if you were looking for a premium brew this isn't it, its just cheap beer."
"By no means is this a great beer. Not really a good beer. But every now and again, this one will hit the spot if you're really looking to swank it up with some of your old-time buddies."
"Mickey's: the choice before going to concerts. A 40 of this will get you ripped and roaring, which is the point to malt liquor! The review I'm doing is off a hand grenade though. They really thought out their ingenuity by the way. A grenade as a bottle? The little riddles that get funny when youre drunk, etc. You don't pour this into a glass, ever. From inside, the head sticks around quite well in a 40, not so much the grenades. The smell is WHOA of grain and alcohol, but not as offensive like some other malt liquors, probably because it has less alcohol. Anyways, the taste, again, all grain. Had a Corona halfway into a 40 one time and made the Corona taste worse than it usually would. SOOO...it is feasibly better than some beers out there. The mouthfeel is decent, not watery, and not heavy. A lil' too much carbonation, but not soda-like. The drinkability is actually quite good for a malt liquor. This stuff will always remind me of high school now!"
"In spite of all this, it is drinkable and not bad for malt liquor."
"Not a bad Malt Liquor, give this one a try if looking for a budget beer."
"Mickey's Malt Liquor pours a pale yellow with a white head from a green, twelve ounce, grenade shaped, big mouth bottle. Smells like corn and some alcohol. Tastes like corn and a little bit of hops. Much more drinkable than many other malt liquors. You could do worse."
"Drinkability - Due to its ease of drinking, it's definitley drinkable. May get old after 3 or 4, but nonetheless a decent malt liquor."
"Goes down very smoothly, quite drinkable. Loses some drinkability points for the price (not much higher than Hurricane or Magnum, but when I'm buying 40s every penny counts) and for the low-ish ABV, the other reason I drink malt liquor. Still, if you ice this, it goes down FAST -- in a contest, I watched two guys drink three 40s of this in under 7 minutes and they kept it down fine. Recommended, and just as good or better than bad macro lagers (Milwaukee's Best, etc.)."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-four ounce aluminum can, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Overall it's not as big, sweet, fruity and rough as many others, however, it's only 5.6% by volume, which is only .6% higher than Bud. In fact, it's barely a malt liquor. But it's clean, well-balanced (given the style), and fairly nice to look at despite the lack of head."
"This pours out like a typical malt liquor but less viscous than some of the high gravity ones. Has more color than the typical macro lager. Has a bit of a rough, grainy smell, which doesn't surprise me, but the flavors are very clean for a malt liquor, I find. The lingering, corny/grainy flavors are there, but, like I said, it isn't as bad as with others. All around, this is one of the better malt liquors around."
"This is a half-decent malt liquor. Mickey's is definitely a step above the average malt liquor, in that I am able to tolerate a few consecutive sips. There is a very slight adjuncty hop bitterness to go along with the disgusting adjunct flavor. On the whole, this beer isn't preferable, but it is pretty good for the style."
"12 oz. green grenade bottle with no freshness date - served chilled in a pilsner glass. It pours a yellow/gold color with a few big streams of carbonation and a half-inch white head that takes a minute or two to recede, and does so unevenly. As I drink it leaves a surprising amount of weblike lacing that definitely raises the appearance score. It smells rather clean with some grains and corn, and tastes about the same with a mild bitterness. It has a light and tingly body with a short finish, but it is quite drinkable. One of the best malt liquors and better than most macro lagers, especially for the price."
"Big mouth bottles are a selling point, the brew is not."
"Drinkability: I certainly don't regret buying 24 ounces of this stuff (it was a buck-fifty, after all), but that should be just about enough for me."
"Thru highschool and beyond this was the 40 of choice for us hooligans on the eastside of Cincinnati,but even as times change This is still the best tasteing malt liquor around. it has a nice golden pour, a bit skunky in the scent but for the price and outcome[cheap thrills] what can you expect."
"Discovered this beer in college. The liquor store had a never-ending special on six packs. Didn't mind it at first, although I didn't care for the sweet flavor and aftertaste. We drank so much of this stuff (because it was cheap, you see) that more than twelve years have gone by and I still get nauseous when I see it at the store. Nasty stuff!"
"Probably the best cheap brew I've ever had so far. It comes in a neat barrel like green bottle. It pours an impressive slightly darker gold with a big frothy head that disappears quickly and leaves a lot of lacing on my special beer glass. The smell is average, macro lagerish. The taste is pretty good. It has a very strong taste of cereal malts and little bit of adjunct sweetness, but not gross sweet like Camo. Camo, God help us all. Anyway not very much hops but enough to keep that sweet taste from getting out of control. It is isn't watery, and considering the bite the taste carries it is fairly drinkable, extremely clean, and has no aftertaste. I may have a new cheap beer."
"Mickey's, in the famous green grenade bottle. This isn't a quality beer by any means, nor is it to be treated as such. This is strictly a session beer, one to drink before a football game or at a frat party. It's actually a pretty good beer as far as session beers go; I'd rather have a Mickey's than a Beast (Milwaukee's Best). Though I can't give this beer a good score (it sucks compared to any decent beer), it is good for what it is intended for... it'll get you drunk, and won't make you gag while doing it."
"12 oz short fat bottle. This pours a clear yellow color. The smell is clean and malty. The taste too is malty but overall it has this nasty sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel is sorta sticky and watery. It is fairly drinkable, for a few at least. The taste after that sorta grinds at my patience."
"An american malt liquor, only good for drink with buddies, the mexican are not goods for drink malt liquor, but is good for try with american food, its penetrate hops and malt aroma and its generous grade of alcohol, made perfect for drink slow in a glass mug; i not recommended this beer."
"Not exactly recommended, but at the same time recommended if you are cheap."
"($3.99 / 6-pack of short wide grenade-like green bottles with a wide opening and a large gold twist cap)"
"This is actually a favorite malt liquor of mine. Maybe it is a combination of the cool packaging (probably the coolest label and cap combo on the planet), and the psuedo-palatable beer within the green glass 40 bottles. Bright clear gold color, head retention is pretty good. Taste is somewhat unpleasent, but is drinkable compared with other malt liquors. Decent hop finish for a malt liquor. One of my favorites, cheap and easy to drink, if that is your thing."
"Mickey's is a classic, I love this stuff. Get's you feeling right & doesn't break the bank doing so. Smooth as silk & cheap as dirt. It's no Westy 12, but for a buck twenty, it can't be beat. The boys at Miller may not always come up with winners, but they sure as shit did here."
"Goes down decently, but not super drinkable at all."
"Long night of drinking last night so I need something to help ease me in coming down. This is the only thing available. Looks yellow and fizzy with a decent head. This really shouldn't be poured into the glass, its a drink from the bottle type beer. Smell is all corn and piss. Taste brings me more corn and piss and maybe some alcohol though its not as boozy as some other malt liquors I've had. This reminds me of Miller High Life but in a bad way. Very rough, don't even think about drinking this warm. There's better malt liquors out there."
"Reflection: When I first tried Mickey's it was still in the 12oz, grenade shaped, wide mouthed bottles with pop tops! Even when I was in high school I thought Bud and Coors were awful so my beer of choice was Mickey's. I'm giving this beer props, thanks to Mickey's I've always gone against the grain and I've never been afraid to try something different in the beer world."
" It's a flavored malt beverage, without the flavor... and it's almost a beverage. I think I'm going to find some benedryl and take a nap, Iv'e been stung by six little mickey's... If I'm lucky, I'll dream of newport storms."
"Maybe Mickey's is better from a big mouth bottle (or a chalis?). Maybe it was better before Miller began brewing it. Who knows? Who cares? Don't expect much and I promise you, that's exactly what you'll get."
"Respect beer beeatch."
"this stuff brings me back like all the way to thanksgiving last year. I think this is some of the best malt liquir on the market. it tastes a little sweet and unlike some others it dosenot taste like flavored beer. and its way cheaper than ""Smirnof Ice"" its under $9 for a 12 pack of those really cool midget green bottles with the recloseable top."
"okay..it's been about 12 minutes since I wrote this review, and after having two of these God da** things, all I can say is that this sh*t's for grown folks! Taste like sh***y beer, smells the same, but get's you trashed quick fast and in a hurry!"
"Mickey's is a little better than the few other malt liquors I've had, but that isn't saying too much. I guess if your goal is to ""get hammered"" Mickey's wouldn't be a bad choice, craft beer lovers will want to pass this up."
"Not only did I pour a little out for my homie, I poured some out to take a look at it in a glass...which I've never done before. Good one finger head with an aggressive pour. It looks highly carbonated and golden yellow, and I'm surprised to see some hints of lace sticking to the sides of the glass. The smell is a little sweet with a hint of granny smith. The taste is sweet, with a faint alcohol taste, and more full than I remembered or expected. It's much better out of the 40oz bottle than a glass. Nostalgia may be playing a role in my review, but I doubt it. Very drinkable and better than I thought it would be after so many years."
"Lets face the facts, people drink malt liquor to get f&*^#ed up more quickly, they don't drink it for the taste. So I ask this question why drink Mickey's when it tastes the same as all other malts and is lower in alcohol volume by 3%. The apperance is very straw yellow with no head and no lacing. The smell is of funky meat and grain. Taste is heavy on the grain, weak on malts and hops, tastes a little metallic as well. Feels flat and dull in the mouth. Drinkable if you are so messed up you accidentally purchase this. Listen drink 2 bombers of Arrogant Bastard instead, better tasting by far and more alcohol volume."
"Sinkability  This bomber bombed."
"Another variation from the House of High Life beer factory in Milwaukee!"
"It is as drinkable as any other macrobrew."
"Poured from a 24 ounce can; a clear golden hue with a respectable sandy beach white head, rushing carbonation noticeable. A horrible odor that is skunky, musty and rustic. Sticky and watery up front; has the malty-malt-liquor thing going on. Actually, some hop detection is noticeable in this bland beverage, but don't go calling the hops authorities yet. Mickey's also has the classic malt alcohol feeling, no not a belly warmer; very carbonated and watery, a terrible cooked veggie/malt liquor palate. Old school, a classic of it's own, and one I use to imbibe on a regular basis, but I've proudly moved onward and upward, take care ol' friend!"
"This is just an easy to drink malt liquor, that's all there is to it. It's smooth and creamy. There is the taste of hops with a dash of malts, but it's the hops that run this brew. Overall though, it is balanced out fairly well. As far as smell goes, it's a little skunky, I guess cause of the green bottles. The head is snow white and sits around for a couple minutes, then dies out to a laceing. All in all, not a bad beer. It's something I would get if I am in dire need of something to drink. Hey, it's better than Bud, Coors, Natty, and Lite."
"F"
"A wide 40 oz, but not a wide mouth...oh, well. Clear pale gold, fugitive head of adjunct character and little duration. Aroma is fairly foul, very vegetal, almost cauliflower, with a pumice soap quality. Flavor is sweetish, but some apple skin qualities slightly redeem it. A little too carbonated for me, but it helps make up for missing hops and helps dry the finish. It felt a little stupid pouring this into a shake for evaluation, so it was good to pound the rest out of the bottle -- it reduces off aromas and brings back the memories, one high school party in particular."
"Drinkability: An old college beverage that called to me today and I shouldn't have answered. The best feature of this beer is the wide-mouth bottle."
"If I had to choose a cheep malt liquer to drink this would definantly be it. I was in need of some beer and I was way short on cash so I bought a Mickey's 40oz for the first time in a few years and let me tell you, it totally works in a pinch. The smell is your typical grain sweetness that you will find in other malt liquor's, but the taste is supprisingly smoothe and it goes down very well. Not the most complex flavors, but at 5.6 a 40 will do just fine. Of corse it does not hold a candle to the likes of Arrogant Bastard or Dead Guy Ale but when you are in a pinch, it works."
"Perhaps nostalgia is at play: when on several elk hunts this was the beer we brought along. It goes down real smooth at 8,000 ft..."
"Its drinkable very cold only"
"Unredeemable, even for malt liquor."
"Another weak pee like yellow highly carbonated brew. This one has a head of fine white bubbles and just a little lacing with carbonated bubbles rising up the side of the glass. I can spell BURP already! It smells like puck (spelling?) Highly carbonated taste, but not as bad as it smells, BURP! Bubly flavor with a mild aftertatse, BURP. It's a typical malt liquor with nothing special about it, BURP, BURP, BURP."
"Just the odd ""Bigmouth"" bottles put you into a humorous mood. The pale gold color with the little fizzy bubbles traveling though the body up to the thin head is misleading. This beer has more substance than you might expect. There's a round and smooth sweet malt foundation in which some metallic hop and alcohol reside alongside some cornmeal-like flavor. In large gulps, which the brewer intended with the wide mouth bottle, an astringent medicinal taste is noticed. The aroma reminds me of wet rye bread. All in all, in the cheap Malt Liquor for the huddled masses-type beer category, not bad...not good either."
"BRAIN GRENADES! That sums it up! These short fat green bottles pack a helluva punch. Strong flavor of alcohol and a bit lower than normal carbonation. Two or three of these will leave you with a killer headache, hence the nickname brain grenades. For a malt, it's not to bad, but i'd rather have a Colt 45 any day."
"It'd been a lot of years, and frankly, it'll be many more before I try it again. Not my cuppa."
"But seriously folks, nice light golden hue, taste is actually pretty well balanced...I enjoyed the memories, thanks Mickey's..."
"I am in college, and I have had a lot of crappy beers in my day, but this one has got to be the worst I have ever had. I bought a bottle and opened it that very same night and it still tasted skunked. I actually threw it away after two sips. If you are looking to get a 40 oz. with a lot of alcohol, look elsewhere because this will be tough to choke down."
"6 years later friends of mine came to a Bar-B-Q with this stuff and when Kevin popped the screw cap I winced. I have no desire to either sample this again or relive my boozy campus years."
"I need to thank my girlfriend's Dad for saving me one to review!"
"No trailer park jokes, please.  Mickey's isn't that bad.  The problem is, it isn't that good either.  I must admit, I am a fan of the wide mouth bottles.  Slightly sweet, light aroma, and grainy, but drinkable."
"Smooth medium straw in color with minimal head and no lace. Light smell of hops, malt, and some cooked corn.  Smooth on the palate with more malt than hops. What hops does show slowly fades.  Slight seltzer like fizziness with smooth drinkability and clean finish.  Good for quick buzz."
"I can drink this Mickey's ""Fine Malt Liquor"" from time to time, just not day in and day out."
" the alcohol is lower than others, but it tastes like a beer, and not a mass of alcohol thrown in with terrible malts. i can't go wrong with a mickey's big mouth."
"pretty tame for a malt liquor.  most ice beers have higher abv's than mickey's.  that all said...one can really tell miller must use extra corn for the heart of this brew.  pretty much smells and tastes like mega-adjuncts which isn't pleasant.  but an underlying smoothness and decent mouthfeel save this beer from being on my all time worst beer list.  if you can get by the smell and get straight to the bee stinging your brain then you've made it to where you want to go.  ethanol in a green bottle."
"This has to be one of the worst beers I have tasted. I think they created the wide mouth so you could chug it down like a shot and get it over with as quickly as possible. The color of the beer was like a faded yellow color and had absolutely no head. The aroma just reeked of corn or whatever odor creates that effect. The flavor was just hard to get a hold of because the finish is just so harsh with a lot of bit to make it impossible to really discern any. My roommate's exchange for drinking my Sierra Nevada Pale. Hardly a fair trade."
"Every malt liquor I have ever had tastes terrible. However, Mickey's tastes more like a light beer and goes down like soda. My first experience with Mickey's was the stumpy  wide mouth bottles, and they seem easy to chug. I think that's the whole point. Anyway, as far as malt liquor goes, this is probably the best tasting, but it also has the lowest alcohol content of a malt that I have seen."
"Notes: Not much to the brew for flavour, quick and clean to drink. Big time college crowd 40oz brew, a step above Magnum ... the other Miller Brewing produced Malt Liquor. Not a bad web site they put out also  http://www.mickeys.com."
"A malt liquor that wears its corn afterburner proudly. Smells like cheap beer and doesn't disappoint. Corny-alcoholic flavor, usually skunked (meaning that a hop has actually seen this brew). The bottles are a novelty - but why would you want easy access to a brew like this?"
"Update: I revised the ratings. This stuff is not bad. It ain't an award winner but it is not repulsive. I'd spend my money on this before I would overpriced heineken. It won't impress anyone but it tastes OK and gets teh job done. Time to Party."
