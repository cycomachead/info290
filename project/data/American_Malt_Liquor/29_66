This stuff is not too bad when icy cold on a hot summer day. Actually, it's pretty good considering the price, although it desperately needs some hops. Sadly, adding a decent amount of hops would raise the price, defeating the point of being the cheapest beer around. I give it a 4.5 because it is good value for the money, and probably best in it's class.","oldguy1587","Jun 25, 2014"

Poured it from this big 32 oz bottle in to my 42 degree mug, what a waste, I should have drank it from the bottle, but had to see the overall appearance...not. The head was one and a half fingers of soap suds that vanished before my eyes, and the color was about the lightest I have ever observed at 4 on the SRM color chart. Weak smell of wet straw and malt. Taste...well not much of that, but what there was....not too bad, sweet corn, wheat, malt, and a hint of rye. Sort of a balloon feeling in my mouth, expanding pressure, but no tingle.

Anyway, King Cobra looks ok. It has a very unexciting look, incredibly clear pale gold with some ugly white lacing. The nose is metallic, alcoholic and corny. It makes some adjunct lagers taste malty. Then again, it's not patently offensive. I wouldn't slap someone in the face for giving me a glass of it. It just tastes like very cheap beer made with little to no care for flavor. The flavor is mild with notes of metal, corn/rice which comes out a bit biscuity in a bad way, and too much alcohol for the body. The feel is thin and mildly gag-inducing. The alcohol and other bad qualities grow as I make my way through a glass. Speaking of which, Duvel please forgive me for misusing your tulip so.

First sip was from bottle as i think this is the natural way for the style. More flavor than i expected, but not exaclty a good thing. Alcohol is present, and gives it a fuller mouthfeel. A malty sweetness and lots of grains in this one. I feel guilty for reviewing this beer because i could be spending my time reviewing a beer worth reviewing. But this isnt as bad as i thought it would be. for $1.50 this isnt a beer i would get again, but if i had to choose this or a 40oz. bud for a dollar more, i might pick the bargain. nuff said on this crap.","acrawf6","Feb 15, 2006"

It has the mouthfeel of carbonated apple juice mixed 50/50 with water. finishes with an off corn flavor and its gone. Towards the end of this 40 it gets syrupy and is almost undrinkable as it warms. Avoid.","DogFood11","Aug 22, 2005"

Cliche yellow color, aroma and taste make you gag. Very bad, this is definitely a can of beer to get drunk with on a budget. (Roughly $1.19 a 24 oz. can)","TastyTaste","Jun 30, 2005"
1.83,-8.5,1.5,1,2,3,2,"This beer pours a very light straw colored yellow. It looks like water with a little food coloring to it. The head is white and lifeless. It fades very quick leaving no laces. The first thing I think of when I smell this stuff is rotting sewage. It smells like rotton corn and dirty water. I dont smell any hops. I dont smell any redeaming qualities at all. I am slightly scared to taste this stuff again. First taste isnt too bad. Not good by any means, but not as bad as I expected. It has a corn flavor. I guess that would be because it is made with corn. It is not hoppy at all. I detect absolutely no spicy flavor. Also, I cant taste any malty flavors. It tastes very much like everything that Anheuser-Busch makes. This beer is carbonated decently, I guess. It would, in my opinion, make an awfull session beer. I will probably never drink it again. It is low in alcohol, though, so to those that like Anheuser-Busch products, it might be a good session beer. I know I used to drink 4 or 5 40's in a night, much to my regrets in the morning. I would recomend staying away from this one. Stick to urine. It probably tastes better.","OStrungT","Jun 20, 2005"

Has a warm alcohol effect. Hmmm.... well this beer was the first beer I had ever tasted (and that was when I was about 12). Not much has changed since then. If you want a cheap buzz with minimal flavor then this is your beer.","Luigi","Apr 06, 2005"
1,-50,1,1,1,1,1,"The names king cobra, and i gotta agree, this stuff looks pretty poisonous. Comes in a 24 ounce can, never the sign of a quality brew. Smells like snake venom. Holy smokes, the taste is rough. Damn ive admittedly had some extremely bad beers, but this one is probably as bad as they get (excluding cave creek of course). After further consideration, beside the cave creek this is hands down the worst beer that i have had. It sinks its fangs in you deep and trys to kill you","Tballz420","Feb 25, 2005"
2.2,10,2,2,2.5,2,2,"Tastes like liquid corn. Really not a whole lot to this one, as far as flavor. Still, the bare fact that it doesn't taste outright putrid is something to be proud of with a malt Liquor. Could be a lot worse.

1.92,-4,1,1.5,2,2,2.5,"This beer was best served from the old opaque brown bottle (why they switched to a clear bottle is beyond me, maybe because of its, surprisingly, almost-appealing golden color.) Smells slightly sour, like the malt has gone bad. Tastes like the re-brewed swill off the top of a vat of Michelob (rumor has it, it is.) Highly carbonated, it's only saving graces are that it's fairly "smooth" for a a malt liquor, and it won't give you the runs like Old English.","PopeJonPaul","Feb 12, 2004"

It has a real copper penny like taste ( like blood almost). It is plain nasty. Only a booze hound sitting on the corner of the old Woolworths on Washington st near down town crossing could enjoy this, but I'd toss him the extra buck to get the St. Ides.","powoo19","Jul 21, 2003"

It's subdued enough that at first sip it seems almost like a regular beer, yet it quickly turns to show many of the negatives associated with the malt liquor style. It's a little bit more drinkable than some due to it's less sweet nature; yet it offers less character - an odd "Catch-22". Faced with a double-doored cooler full of malt liquors, I think I'd look for something else first.","NeroFiddled","Jun 27, 2003"
