Very fresh very un-shocking, pretty normal. Seemed to be highly carbonated and did not taste strong like the 8% would have made me think it would be. No burn, great taste.

Red Horse Extra Strong - the Beer that kicks you back. Thanks to Fele for bringing this back. I prefer the Gold Eagle from last time.","BigBry","Jun 20, 2005"
3.05,20.6,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Smooth a crisp with a mild acrid twang from the fermentation. Cereal grain and mild malt with little hop character ... just bitterness to balance. A little too wet on the palate ... watery IMO. Usually there is more of a definitive corn flavor to malt liquors. Clean finish with some residual dextrin like sweetness.","Jason","May 25, 2005"
