"Schlitz O.M.L Malt Liquor brewed by JOS. Schlitz Brewing Co. This brew has an ABV of 5.9% The pour on  this brew is nice. This brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice white head.  The smell is corn with some grans.  There is nothing bad about this brew so far. There is a lot corn in the taste of this brew but it has a nice balance to it. This brew goes down nice for having a 5.9% ABV. Schlitz Malt Liquor is one of the better Malt Liquors on the market.  There is nothing over powering in this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3.75 out of 5. I would get this brew again."

"Overall: Schlitz is the epitome of average, the everyman's beer. And I love it. Pairs well with creamed corn or biscuits and gravy. Best enjoyed at the tailgate table with a bag of Sam's Club potato chips, or around a tire-fire with an extreme spicy Slim-Jim. Either way, stock up on Schlitz original today!"

"An excellent American Malt Liquor. Schlitz OML has a malty character with slight fusel alcohol note mixed with an apple meets bready overtone with slight grassy character. It is rich by malt liquor standards. Tastes pleasant. Drink only when cold. It is horrid warm. I have drank this in cans and in 40 ounce bottles. I favor it in 40's. Does nothing wrong in malt liquor. Only Colt 45 for me is a better malt liquor, or Olde English 800. I rate this 3.50. A superb cheap drunk. I like this and drink it every so often."

"I Honestly do not understand why this VERY good ""Malt Liquor"" gets so many Bad reviews..? I Myself have always enjoyed it a GR8 Deal ~it is crisp,refreshing,and has a very rich full flavor,maybe it's all the craft beer ""Snobs"" ...or perhaps the ""Light Beer"" drinkers who are just not used to a somewhat Full flavored semi strong beer that actually has some taste and body~it pours a nice straw,Golden colour,with plenty of carbonation & a pillowy white head,that even leaves a nice lacing around your beer glass of choice...I Know a lot of people slam ALL Malt Liquors,but it's just ""Strong Beer"" people,Even though @ 5.9 ABV ""Schlitz O.M.L"" really does not pack that much of a Punch,I just drink it because it taste awesome to me,and judging from a LOT of the reviews here I am NOT Alone in my love of this tasty beverage~it's just too bad that so many people do not give ""Malt Liquors"" in General a chance,and think all of it is just Cheap Crap that taste like shit,the Real Truth is that a lot of Malt Liquors are VERY Good Beers,if you happen to enjoy a full bodied,rich,American Strong Beer that actually taste like a REAL Beer~Cheers;)"

"I became introduced to Schlitz Malt Liquor 35 years ago as a teen. It was the drink of my older brother. After trying different beers over the years, I found myself returning and sticking to the Bull. The taste is smooth and original. I find it like an energy drink. I drink it during my softball tournaments and stay energized. It doesn't leave the aftertaste as other high priced beers does. It is not considered as a quick drunk beer to me and my sports friends. It is the beer of choice, and trust me we can afford any beer out there, but we prefer our Bull."
"The taste has a light grainy sweetness to it actually balanced with a wisp of piney-grassy hop bitterness and flavour. This is a little less grain-tasting, sweet, and full-bodied than some, like"

"Overall: its a cheap buzz! The best commercial malt.liquor available. Its cheap! It doesn't taste like shit(miller lite) its nearly 6%, when you cant afford a damn stout or ipa or tripel wtf ever man drink some fuckin malt licka for.a cheap buzz ! Hoggie I love you!!!$"

"Overall: I got the last 12 pack in my local Ingles, and it isn't restocking. And sadly, I've never seen it anywhere else in person. This is a great go-to/daily beer, but I have a feeling I may not see it again for a long time. There is nothing offensive about this beer. Nor is it the case that the beer is lacking in aroma, Flavor, or body."

"Overall – It fits the malt character rather well. While not a flavor powerhouse and even with some light off flavors, it is quite cheap (paid $2.29 for a 40) and still very drinkable. Not too bad."
""
"Bottom line, don't let the label and aggressive ghetto targeted marketing fool you, this is a good beer, especially for the price."
""
"This is going to sound like sacrilege here, but this is a good beer. If this were available where I actually live, it'd be a regular when I wasn't holding craft money. Lawnmower steez for places where lawns don't grow that well."
"I had $5, thats all my wife left me when she went to work lol. So, I saw the 18 oz bottles of this for $0.99 at the local beverage barn. So, i bought four of them. i got them all nice and cold and sat down to watch my Rangers piss away the AL West to the Oakland A's. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It was very good. It went down very smoothly and tasted pretty damn good. I like it better than any other Schlitz beer. But, i wished I had more to drown my sorrows of the rangers choking away the division. i will buy this beer again."

"If you hate malt liquor....then dont go there."
"Golden, brownish beer with a thick, foamy head that dissolves slowly. Smells of sweet corn and musty grain. Taste is super sweet, like sugar water with some hints of adjuncts. None of the musty, metallic flavor you get with some malt liquors. Seriously though, is this blended with corn syrup? It's more like a sweet tea than beer."
""
"Served ice cold in a frosted glass mug. Pours the color of straw with a thick, two finger length white head. Some nice, sticky lacing is left on the side of the glass. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The beer smells like grains. I can detect the corn in the aroma. There is a nice mild grainy sweetness to this beer. The malt and corn come through with some mild hop bitterness in the back end. The alcohol isn't that detectable in the taste. The body is light to medium with plentiful carbonation. This beer is smooth. The drinkability is very good good. Overall, this is a good beer for the price. I picked up an 18 ounce bottle for 99 cents at a gas station, so if you're looking for a malt liquor, this one is worth a try."
"This is pretty foul. It has a warm, metallic, grainy taste that's incredibly displeasing. I admit that I bought this more for a cheap buzz than anything else, but I'll steer clear in the future."
"Pours a pale golden color with a bubbly head. Scent is that of cheap grassy grains. Drinks fine with a sweet, grainy taste but the after taste goes south leaving a chalky, dry finish. Thin in texture and drinks as fast as water. Not something I would buy again, but at least it was an average quality malt liquor that was better than others I have had."

" lil sweet with an alcoholic finish...not much else. Mouthfeel is kinda light and watery with a lot of carbonation. overall probably the best malt liqour ive had, And ive had most of them...very drinkable"

"Had this in a can - well, it’s what was available. Aroma is weak, wan and malty. It pours a very uninspiring clear pale yellow; at least the white head is fairly thick. Flavor is malty and a little fruity, actually better than I expected but still not much. Then again, I have been spoiled rotten by craft brews. Texture is smooth but hardly fizzy at all - I’ve drunk soymilk that left more of a tingle. I guess you have to drink swill occasionally so you can better appreciate the real stuff."
"Tastes like summer in college playing beer pong. Overly sweet taste that hides everything but the inevitable drunkenness at the end of the can. Not too much to say. This is pretty typical of malt liquors. I can't think of many redeeming things to say about this one. Aroma is faint, taste is not that great, feel is kind of watery. Overall a middle of the road malt liquor, which is to say stay the hell away."
"This beer was the epitome of average. It's got the classic cheap beer taste and not much else. This is what your alcoholic uncle's breath smells like. I'm a fan of that bad beer flavour, but it's not usually what I expect from a malt liquor. I usually expect more corn in a malt liquor and maybe a bit of an alcohol taste. Maybe some unbalanced sweetness. Not here. This was super...duper...average. One good thing was the presence of hops for balance. That's odd, but kinda fun in a beer that often goes hopless. It's also nice to have that ""bad beer"" taste exacerbated more than most cheap ""beers"" tend to do (as opposed to malt liquors). I might go for this again if it's plain o' beer I want, but never again if I'm craving a malt liquor. Cuz that's just not what this tastes like."
"Well you know the drill."
"Pours to a thin white head and gold color. Aroma is veggie, corny and sweet. Flavor is sweet, grainy, with no hop character to speak of. Mouth feel is rough, overly carbonated. Overall impression is that this is an alcohol delivery device that is barely enjoyable."
"Foamy head that dissipates relatively quickly into a lining around the top. Medium amber gold body. Smells like bubble gum and corn. Tastes like corn, with a bit of sweetness. Light syrupy mouthfeel. Easy to drink, but the high ABV content will get you buzzed fast."
"D: Pretty middle of the road as far as malt liquors go. Once is probably enough for this one."
"D: 5.9% is pretty low for a malt liquor. This wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it'd be. At least pretty good sippin' from the bottle, crouchin' on the corner, shootin' dice with ashy Larry. Tyrone Biggums?!?!?! This is not cocaine in a can and no you can not taste my penis. Now get over here, Ronda!"
"poured out of the can. no real head, no real smell. dark gold color. this one goes down smooth, with little taste and no aftertaste. very unlike ice beers with the same alcohol content, as ice beers tend to have an unpleasant alcohol smell and leave an aftertaste. would definitely go back to this one."
"Don't know what these other folks are talking about, but this beer is awesome. It's on the cheaper end of the price scale but don't let it fool you. It's smooth, balanced, but on the malty side. Great smooth silky texture and mouth feel. This has become my standard go to ""i want a beer"" beer. Highly recommended, but don't confuse it with the other varieties of schlitz. Look for the Blue Bull."
"D - Don't want more but it will get ya drunk if that's what you want."
"*Dictated, not read*"
"Pours pale yellow with a large white head. Corny mild aroma. Malty fizzy taste. Watery mouthfeel. Everything you love in a malt liquor. The point was more alcohol and little beer taste. We used to buy kegs of this stuff for parties in the summer and it was a huge hit. The 18 to 25 year old crowd loved this stuff. As a craft beer drinker I would have rate this a slightly better than average as a malt liquor and fairly much in the middle of the pack when it comes to adjunct American macros. The modern version is best avoided altogether unless pounding beers is your game."
"Drinkable? Well, it won't kill you immediately. You could do better. It came in dead last during the tasting."
"Being what it is, a cheap malt liquor, it has a decent flavor. Not bad at all really, but not great either. Just OK to me. It pours a pale straw color, and has a very strong smell of corn adjunct (most likely to boost alcohol content). Nothing overly offensive though. Not an unpleasant drinking experience, and if I found myself really thirsty, and hot and sweaty... I could see myself drinking it again. All in all, it's OK. It's a cheap malt liquor with an OK taste. Nothing really stands out as far as taste goes though. If you want a decent malt liquor, then this may be your beer..."
"Drinkability was good, not amazing as it has been built up to be. I'm on the fence, I'd honestly rather have a Mickey's or King Cobra. I'd buy again if I needed a change of pace."
"D: easy, not bad, not great, but is within the style"
"Poured from a brown 40 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, malty, not very flavorful but actually quite refreshing. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable, probably more so than any other malt liquor I have had. Overall not a bad example of this beer style."
"Notes: While I have yet to find a malt liquor that is super delicious, I would consider this one on the bottom half of the ones I've had. The flavors are just too much, I'd rather it taste like less because then it wouldn't be so grossly sweet."
"This bull is pretty sweet, almost sugary graininess with a bit of tropical fruit. Alcohol and a dollop of what I am assuming is hops make for a drying and mildly bitter finish. ABV is pretty restrained but still noticeable. Carbonation is about medium or slightly low for a malt liquor. Pretty slick and it slides down the throat with ease. Would rather have one of these than say...a bud light."
"RJT"
"Poured into an 8 ounce tasting glass five times. Smells fairly clean. Grainy, mildly corn-like. High amounts of carbonation, but with a slick kinda sugary feeling on the tongue. Not hot or harsh like a lot of malt liquors. Better than I remembered it."
"I got a finger of rocky, bone-white head that gradually settled into wisps. Color was a pretty sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was really sweet, almost unnaturally so. Definitely fusel, like walking into a dry cleaner's. Oof. It had a medium mouthfeel, which was nice, but the taste was a combination of perfume, bubble gum and cereal. And to think that I was once intimidated by this stuff ... Now, it just seemed cheap and not well made at all. The finish was dry, but it left a lingering taste of cereal in my mouth. My CAN held 24 ounces and that was PLENTY, believe me. I CANnot get my mind around a 40 of this dreck."
"This one tops my list of malt liqours for now til I find a better one but This is still a good go-to for your malty needs."
"Wish we got a clear picture of the can before it was crushed. lol..."
"Overall, this is a pretty bad beer. Shared a pint with ThePeskyDingo (thank heavens I didn't have to drink this animal myself). Warning: Stay Away from DAS BULL!"
"Another cold wet alcohol brew with little character."
"If your into Malt Liquor, than you must try this! Cheers!"
"Got this in a quart from the lcbo. Drank straigt from the bottle, nice golden yellow color, and after every swig nice head is left over. Smells more like a beer than a malt, but odd at the same time. Taste is good on this one, i docked it .5 because it gets rather flat after about 10-15 swigs. Otherwise, tastes like macro, booze is hidden, goes down smooth. I like it. Mouthfeel is full, and smooth. Drinkability is perfect, when ice cold, its really easy to pound em back, has more taste than a macro, but its low in ABV so thats kind of a turn off, but otherwise rock solid malt."
"D - Another malt liquor really, nothing more and nothing less. Strikingly unoffensive but also lacking the punch it needs."
"By the way, I passed a urine test by using Schlitz as my piss."
"The taste has a light grainy sweetness to it actually balanced with a wisp of piney-grassy hop bitterness and flavour. This is a little less grain-tasting, sweet, and full-bodied than some, like Mickey's or Colt 45, but has a slightly stronger hop chracter and bitterness, making it more well-rounded."
"This is a poor example of a malt liquor, its too sweet and vegetal."
"Like most malt liquors, Schlitz is something I hope to never drink again. The yellow color and poor head make me think it should be enjoyed from the can. Wait, did I just say enjoy? There was nothing enjoyable about the taste or smell. Both were of corny grains and cheap alcohol. The body was light and a little syrupy. At just under six percent, this isn't even good for getting drunk."
"Still, it's mostly carbonated water."
"Could be the worst brew my young beer intellect has had yet. Worse, I don't find Schlitz to be as bad as it is made out to be. But this, was bad. Even the bottle is ghetto. It is just a silver label with the ""Blue Bull"" and it says Schlitz Malt Liquor. Can you make something generic if it is already generic. The brew itself is a cheap, alcoholic speedball. It has no redeeming qualities as the taste is very weak and bitter, but the mouthfeel is one of smoothness because it goes right down the pike. This is designed for someone to slam a couple on the cheap and get their buzz."
"Not bad at all for a style thats often slamed. This beer was present on my parents first date, so I just may owe my very exsistence to this beer."
"A big imposing blue bull against a white brick wall on the can. I guess that says it all about what I'm getting myself into with this one. I'm hoping not to get gored, we'll see. Even though the proper way to drink a malt liqour is out of the can/bottle, I poured a small bit into a glass to judge the appearance. Pale yellow, fizzy with a head that goes to nothing almost immediately. Smells a harsh... goes with the taste. Sweetness and alcohol. A small bit apple-y. This one is hard to get down given how low in alcohol it is. Well I avoided the horns but can't say I'll mix it up with the Blue Bull again."
"D: A pretty good malt liquor, easy to drink, a fair beer to beer to buy if you are on a budget."
"This has been the first time that I've had a malt liquor in quite some time as in years. I'm actually surprised by it a little. The appearance of this brew looks similar to any mass produced american beer golden yellow with a thin head. It smells only a little bit more malty than other mass produced beers. I'm even surprised by the taste its really not that bad no wonder bums drink this stuff. I mean I don't like IPAs and most of them cost two to three times as much as this stuff. Theres not much carbonation in each sip and it does go down pretty smoothly. All in all this stuff is very drinkable for what it is its cheap, smooth, not bad tasting, and very cheap."
"Olde English still beats this in my book for cheap malt"
"Alright, this isn't exactly the height of craft brewing, but ya know, I kinda like it. It's smooth, refreshing, and actually doesn't taste bad at all. Unlike a lot of macros, it avoids the bitter-with-no-flavour problem by not being bitter ... so I guess you can say it's balanced. It's a bit boozy, which I attribute to high alcohol to taste ratio, but for what it is, it's not bad. I look forward to sampling other malt liquors... but I wish they came in smaller sizes."
""
"Just a buffed up American beer. I wonder how this fits into the category of malt liquor when it does not even taste like malt liquor. This malt is in the middle of the road for me - I don't love it, but I don't hate it either. Goes down easy, but has a very unremarkable taste. Not that the taste is bad, but its just not there."
"I bought a ""40"" of this stuff and poured it into a drinking glass. The appearance was not too bad. It's an electric crystal-clear golden with lots of carbonation bubbles and a decent bubbly off-white head. The head didn't dissapear entirely. The smell is faint, of cereal, like corn maybe. The taste is pretty sweet, also reminding me of corn, and leaves a syrupy bland aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good - smooth with a right amount of carbonation. Overall, I think 40 ounces is too much to drink of this stuff, but if you're on a tight budget, it'll keep you company well."
"Overall: For 1.59 for 32 oz, this one will give any macro swill a run for its money. Not recommended, but certainly worthwhile for getting messed up on a budget."
"Not nearly as rough as your average Malt Liquor; it actually tastes like a maltier Budweiser. Not horrible, but not great."
"Schlitz is good for what it is. These are quite drinkable ice cold on a hot day. The price factor is also nice, for times when you're on a budget."
"Schlitz Malt Liquor pours a pale fizzy yellow with a fluffy white head from a brown thirty two ounce bottle. Smells like adjunct, but not unpleasantly so. Crisp, some metallic flavors are present. Pretty drinkable by malt liquor standards. If you are looking for malt liquor, this isn't a bad choice."
"Yeah, this shit's OK. The Blue and the Red Bull Schlitz varieties are more similar in the can than in the big bottle. The carbonation sort of ruins the mouthfeel from the can and hides the taste. Some might appreciate this, but I spent 1.25 on this can and I wanna taste my malt/adjuncts! Fuck y'all, Schlitz. (I mean Pabst!)"
"Poured a pale yellow color. Initially head is large, white and puffy, but rapidly fell to a thin coating. Smell is minimal with a slight sweet note. Taste is also very mild, and when the beer is very cold it is OK, as it warms it becomes less acceptable. Finish is refreshing. OK, but not much else."
"Okay, this is not that special of a beer, but it is exactly what it is. Crisp and clean and so easy to drink. Not a lot of flavor, but nothing bad. Anyway, it pours out a light straw color, very clear with a fizzy white head that clings to the glass a bit. yeah, i poured part of theis tall boy into a glass so i could see what it looks like. Anyway. It smells pretty decent. Has a little bit of a hop character. This is completely lacking in the taste which is very water like. I don't give it any gross points, so there is nothing wrong with it. As far as mouthfeel and drinkability, it is light and as easy to drink as water. If only the alcoholish flavors stayed hidden as it warmed up."
"A lightly amber beer; good for refreshing and summer days; little strong, generous ABV, ominpresent in its flavor; much hops and malt; smell like crispy bread, notes of malt flower; taste lightly bitter, grassy and sweet; try in a mug glass, with snacks; pasta is good too; 60% recommended."
"sh-KwOKK! The door opens accompanied by the sound of her whip. I'd seen her before, but never dared test my skills. Now she stands before me tall, lean, and cool. Light golden tan skin and nearly bleached white on top. Firm and sticky, like from too much hair gel. I'm a bit worried and I lean backward as I search for an escape. Seeing my weakness, she approaches and stands nose to nose. My goodness, I catch a hint of sweet perfume on this temptress ruffian. Wet sweet over a flowery hint. Not at all what I expected. In the moment I struggle with this surprise, she attacks. On her lips I taste memories of honey from her morning toast. Lilac flowers. Perhaps her heart is true? Yet her blue-collar nature shows through. Like drab cardboard, stiff and drab to the world. Yes, she's no pussy cat. She bites my tongue leaving a sting like rough vodka mixed with a fizzy warm un-cola. The encounter continues longer than I'd like, dry and thin on my end, until I'm left repellant. I hang in to serve my duty until, finally, the deed is done. I quietly side-step out of the room and, dazed, I wonder if I'll regret our encounter in the morning."
"($1.69 / 40 oz.)"
"I don't often reach for an ice-cold malt liquor (okay, never), but if I was so inclined, this wouldn't be a bad way to go. It wins this head to head between the two grizzled veterans of the style and will now be awarded the laurel wreath as the victor in Malt Likkapalooza I. It also wins the ever important 'best can' category thanks to the big blue Bull looking to kick a little Colt."
"Avoid this gin n' juice in mizzy social sett'n . Ill slap tha taste out yo mouf. If you really wiznant ta give it a go, I'd recommend a trizzay ta tha corna Quik-Pak fo` a tall boi or a 40 doggystyle. Put that purchase in a hustla sack n driznink it stone cold n F-to-tha-izzast."
"Oh man I have no idea why I had this in my fridge or decided to drink it in the middle of the day, but I did (boredom). This has that malt liquor taste but isn't quite as alcoholy or hot as other malt liquors. Decently crisp and it has that grainy adjuncty sweetness I would compare to Mickey's. As with all malt liquors, this beer sucks once its not ice cold. Ok, enough of this, I need an imp stout."
"This isn't as nasty as I remember from when I had this is high school. The appearance is yellow with a foamy head that quickly subsides. Aroma is that sweet malt liquor smell that all malt liquors seem to have in common, this is fairly unoffensive when compared to others. Taste isn't as sickly sweet as I remember. RIght now it seems just like any adjunct lager, just with more alocohol and a little bit more sweetness. I'm not gonna lie and say this is good, however, it is slightly better than the average malt liquor."
"Word"
"Well I've had worse malt liquors but not much worse. It poured a piss yellow color with a suprisingy decent head that stayed around and left a touch of lace. The smell was horrible with nothing but skunk and grain. The taste was just as bad, with a really nasty sweetness that made me pucker with disgust after every sip. This is one I will never be drinking again, give me a Mickey's any day!"
"More drinkable than you would think. This isn't necessarily inferior to Budweiser, but it is just really an Alcohol delivery device."
"I'll confess, I picked up a pint of this on a whim. Not often you get a pint this cheap. It cost me just buck and some pocket change. Pours fairly well, and has a rather nice color to it. Doesn't really smell like much. This last bit's the most surprising, because it tastes like a puddle of frat-party vomit. High alcohol, low on every other feature that really makes beer enjoyable. As I drank it, I felt myself developing an urge to watch football excessively and crush the can on my head. I'd recommend buying a can, just to remind yourself why you shell out the extra cash for a beer that doesn't taste like it was fished from a drainage ditch."
"Standard macro fare with the basic formula we expect. This is one of the big 3's more potent offerings. Appearance is very straightfoward yellow with a light white head. Little retention and only mild lacing. Strong sense of adjuncts and very little aroma to impress the drinker."
"Overall, I wouldnt say this beer has no redeeming qualities. It has a flavor, it is cold and fluid, and has a little more character than some of the more respected beers out there."
"Another sound (brown paper bag) brew, economically speaking."
"Straw like yellow with lots of tiny bubbles. Big bubbly head fades down quickly to a thin layer atop the brew. Light, sweet grain smell on the nose. Light sweetness on the tongue with a bit of harsh bitterness in the middle. ""Hangin' wit da hommies on dis brew."""
"This is the nastiest stuff I've ever had. I bought a 40 of it and only had 3 sips. One to taste it, the second to taste again, becuase I didn't believe how nasty it was, and the third just to make sure. The color was nothing special, just a really pale yellow, with no head, but some carbonation. The smell was like a skunk was in a dirty sock, takin' brown. The taste was just like the smell unfortunately. Needless to say, I'm never going to buy another. If there were 0 on here, it would get a total score of 0."
"Definite ""I am drinking this because of the Alcohol"" beer. It does have the malt tast minus the taste of hops. This is because the overwhelming tastes of nail polish remover kills your tastebuds. Prepare your self for one big head ache the next day."
"Somewhat sweet for a malt with a taste that mostly like stinky alcohol. Kind of weak for a dirty 40 at 5.9%, but oh well. If it was higher I would probably be huggin the porcelain throne. The label is cool I guess. I am drunk anyway so who cares."
"Glad this came in a 32oz dark brown glass bottle, because I am developing an aversion to beer in cans."
"Medium gold color with a decent white head that fades to a thin layer, good lace.  Herbal aroma with grains and alcohol.  Decent flavor, begins with malt sweetness, strong alcohol, finish is dry and hoppy.  Should be consumed ice cold.  Its a bit rough around the edges, but one can do worse for the money.  I can think of several nationals that are not as good and cost more than this one."
"It looks like a plastic display once poured, no movement. Odd. Tastes awfully metallic, like you're sucking a battery. Smells kinda of toasted. When you get it in those massive bottles I'm sure it does the trick for a good price. Highschool memories."
"as far as malt liquors go, this one isn't too bad. the usual adjunct smell and taste with a noticeable alcohol bite.  a little hop bite, not much aftertaste, and an unusual smoothness makes this palateable. be sure to drink it ice cold and out of the 40 oz. bottle with the brown paper bag to get the full effect."
