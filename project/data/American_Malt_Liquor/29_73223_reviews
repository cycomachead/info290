"In conclusion: there are better options out there, even for cheap beverages. But this is not nearly as bad as I expected out of a Natty brand. They did something right here, and I tip my hat to them for that."
"This is not good beer. Not at all. But its not terrible either. Well, yeah its kind of terrible. But it goes down easy. There are some decent fruity flavors there. And its cheap. So if you want some inexpensive beer, with a kick(8% abv), this is for you. Otherwise, I don't recommend it."
"This beer is quite drinkable and even at a mere 6 percent ABV could be dangerous.  I think I've discovered my new favorite ultra-cheap beer!"
"Overall, I live in a college town and the street are littered with these each and every Friday and Saturday night, so they must be doing something right. And at least they're cans rather than glass. I'll pass, but I'll also say that it's far from the worst malt liquor I've ever tasted."
"O- this isn't nearly as bad as Natty light.  The sweet taste up front isn't that bad actually, but the finish tastes just as off-putting as Natty light.  A good way to get drunk, but that's about it"
""
"For a cheap ($1.79) can at 8%, it's really not that bad. If you're okay with drinking cheap domestics, this one does just fine. Packs a decent punch. Average malty taste, nothing too exciting."
"once you get to the bottom and its not ice cold anymore it is almost unbearable to drink"
""
""
"This beer has a light taste for a barley beer and a satisfying after taste.   8% was a ""wow"" factor too.  I always did get more of a buzz from 5% beer than I did from 12% wine or 40% scotch for some strange reason.  One of these Natty Daddy beers is quite satisfying for the night."
""
""
""
""
"This is the worst beer I have ever had. I am not one to pour out a beer, but half-way thru this huge can, and I started to develop a headache. Instant hang-over in a can... had to go down the drain. Just awful."
""
""
""
"This is by far the worst beer I have ever had."
""
""
"To beer fair any beer called,  Natty Daddy, needs no other criticism, I drank this at a Pitt tailgate and much like English Bob, I walked up slowly on the beer tub,because I was drunk!"
""
""
""
"I bought this drunk and drank it the next morning and for a 1.82 I kinda liked it"
"Really sweet and ok when Ice cold. Once it gets warmer its terrible."
""
"Really this is a fine beer for what it is.  Which is to say...hiccup...if you are looking to get hammered on...hiccup...the cheap, this is the...hiccup...beer for...hiccup...you.  There is nothing offensive or even remotely so, except for the flavor on the can from the constant smell of the place that I bought it.  It isn't good beer.  But it is fine for what it is."
"Drinkable extremely cold and a nice buzz at a low price if that's your goal!"
"Not my favorite by any stretch. The appearance was a hazy pale yellow with no head and flat looking. The smell is all booze with no hop,malt, or anything else to speak of, maybe a little rice. The taste wasn't good either, mainly starting off weak with light rice flavor and then a heavy booze finish. Overall I think I'll stop taking freebies from salesmen for a little bit."

"I do drink this beer. I enjoy the heck out of it in the right circumstances. I truly love good beers and ales. This is not one of them. It does however, have it place, as a quick hit malt liquor that will put the crowd in the mood. It is similar to Fireball as compare to decent whiskey. It has it place as a party starter."
""
" Overall, This beer will remain with me throughout my life."

"OK...Lets face it man,this is not a Beer you drink and savor the flavor,this is a ""Malt Liquor"" you chill ICE F87king Cold and slam! it will get you where you want to be VERY Fast,and for about a buck 25 a 25oz can what can you bitch about? you must drink this stuff ICE COLD,Because as it warms it gets that ""Malt Liquor"" sweet,sick,nasty tatse to it..yuck! but ICE COLD? not half bad @ all~and it will ""Kick your ass"" so know this..lmao~beerwolf666*[jammimg some ""the morningside~ 14}"
"Iknow alot of folks look down on this one but for what it is,it is out standing.Here I can get my local grocery store sells it at $1.09 a 25oz can and with there store deal card they take .10c off that!So $10.00 about takes care of your weekend beer buzz because you only need 3-4 of these to get where you want to be if a cheap high is what you are seeking.This is not a beer for someone looking to savor but with a pizza and movie if your looking to sleep good it works."

"Its cheap, it does the job there is nothing to hate about it. It is what is is a inexpensive high alcohol beer that will get you drunk. If you are strictly a craft beer drinker yeah you wont like it cause it has nothing to do with craft but overall for the price and the alcohol percent you will have a hard to time beat it."
"O - For what this is it isn't exactly ""bad"". When I hear people say this is ""the worst beer"" ever I have to wonder if they've live sheltered beer lives as there is plenty that make this stuff look like a world class brew. Bottom line is that for what it is it is pretty good."

"Natty Daddy Is Death In a Can made by Anheuser Busch. 8.1 abv. For the money you will get messed up....Fucked up. Over all this a beer you buy when you want one beer. Not the greatest but not the worst out there. Taste is heavy and bitter. The color is darker than Natural ICE and Bud ICE. Mouth feel was ok."
""
"Pours with a scanty head of white on a clear, straw colored body. No retention no lace. An aroma of weak apple juice/cheap champagne. The flavor is more watered down apple juice with notes of nail polish remover and sadness. Medium body, fairly high carbonation and a slightly sweet finish. This is unusually bad, to the point that I actually laughed out loud when I first tasted it. Not sure what the point of this product is, since they already make other high gravity malt liquors that don't suck quite as much as this one."

"Honestly these beers arent that bad. They are not for a light weight because of their heavier alcohol content.. In my opinion if you can't handle a natty daddy you shouldn't be drinking alcohol at all, so yea. Drink on, friends and be safe. Much love"
""
""
"O: I'm just going to finish this can...aaand I'm buzzing."
"O: For a malt liquor this one is really not that bad, it is drinkable and the flavors are not overly intense with the alcohol being fairly well hidden (which is unusual for the style)."
""
""
""
"Overall, for an American Malt Liquor it is quite good. Not going to fill the refrigerator with the stuff but is is better than 95% of what you will find."
"They were out of keystone ice and I spied these little gems priced 3 for $3. I grew up on mickie's and colt45 so I am not adverse to a little buzz beer. I was pleasantly surprised it was not at all super skunky or burny. I have had occasion to sip a camo beer and this was no where near the horrid bilge that stuff is. Nowadays beer comes in different colors, flavors, alc %s, etc. This at least comes across as resembling the original german style beverage."

"This product is great for what it is: a cheap, high-octane, malt liquor that's easy to swallow and carries a heavy punch. It's best for those days when you want to get drunk quickly for under four dollars. Around here, a can usually costs under 2 dollars and, when I drink it quickly, gives me a pretty nice buzz. Two cans and I'm officially drunk. Sure, it's not the best tasting beer, but what do you expect for something that costs less than most big bottles of soda. This is my goto cheap-ass beer."
"This is by far the worst beer I have ever had. It is straw colored. It kind of smells like plastic. you can smell the alcohol in it. The taste is kind of sour. I took about 2 drinks of it and got almost instant gut rot. It might make me really sick if I drank a whole one."
"Overall its a strong beer to get you drunk. As someone else mentioned, the can states its both a lager and an ale which is pretty funny. Drink this sucker cold."
""
""
""
""

"Overall I don't claim to have tried all the malt bombs available but this is at least average so far. You can tell it is related to Natural Light/ Ice."
""
""
"I go to bed and fall asleep pretty quickly and don't wake up till 6 or 7 am."
"I recommend this for people who would like to get buzzed fast or would like to catch a buzz on a budget. This will get you drunk."
"okay, let me start out by saying I have drank everything from boones farm to the highest end single malt scotch, I am a big fan of natural ice ... so I saw this and I had to try it, I will agree it is definitely no natural ice ... but, It is what it is... and that is a quick buzz in a can... or 2 to 3 cans, whatever... anyways, for what it is it is not half bad, but if I had a few extra bucks I would just slam a 12 pack of natural ice and call it a sure thing."

"Well folks ... I am a retired chemistry teacher, now working as a chef in a restaurant that now sells ""beer to go"" ... I guess that my ""attention"" was ""piqued"" by the ""NattyDaddy"" display which ""highlighted"" the 8.0% alcohol by volume content. So .. yep .. I bought a 24 ounce can ... the taste was HORRIBLE ... to me like, ""liquid aluminum"" .. but .. the 8% worked its ""magic"" ... so your choice is obviously ... ""taste or effect"" (or is it affect?) Oh yea ... we sell it for $1.29 for a 24 ounce can!"
"Haha, all you arrogant so called beer connoisseurs would be begging for an ice cold 24oz can of Natty Daddy on a hot summer day if you were without. And you would love every drop of its perfectly intoxicating effects! Had to give this beer all 5' to offset all the undeserved haters. This is a mega brewed beer. You should rate accordingly and not go comparing it to craft beers. It does a great job at being what it is meant to be. So go buy a 24oz Natty Daddy and revel in its perfectly intoxicating glory."

"Poured this American Malt Liquor from a 22 oz can into a pint glass. Poured a bright yellow color, produced a small white head, poor retention and it left no lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of light malt, adjuncts. Not much doing. Light in body, this brew had a foundation of thin malted grain, there is just a touch of hops- semi sweet. Watery, thin, not much flavor to speak of. Another weak offering from AB."

"Anheuser-Busch Natty Daddy ---2/5."
"Natty Daddy is what I said it is, and what everybody thinks of it as -- a beer for a buzz. At 8%, it'll do the job... it's not a beer to drink when you want to enjoy what you're drinking."
""
"Ah come on people! This is a beer reviewing website.... Yes, this is cheap, bottom shelf beer, yes it is definitely not high brow beer, but you know what? This beer isn't anywhere as bad as all the 1 scores it has received. This beer is for quick buzz drinkers, or maybe a party day at the river. This is not an aficionado beer. Anyways, this beer pours a light golden malty color. It is nearly clear in appearance, has a very acidic mouth feel, it is strong on the tongue and has an overabundance of froth and lace. This beer is nowhere near world class, but it is nowhere near the worst of the world class."
"Handsome blue can 24 ozs from a local 7/11 type. $1.59 This better be good $1.59 for this type of beer! No idea of the colour as i have this from the can wrapped in the proper brown bag. Aroma i can make out is sweet malts,perfumy that’s about it Taste sweet semi sweet apple,slight tobacco, a little toasted bread a tiny bit of Halls mentholyptus. Not to shabby for style Palate is fine for style and the carbonation works.Alcohol is hidden which is a tremendous plus for this style. Overall not to bad for the style."

"I am not about to try this beer. I have a story to tell and it is quite interesting! A man in a nearby town killed a woman and admitted to drinking Natty Daddy beer after the killing. I work in a convience store. Every time I wait on a customer, that is what I think of...that man and the graphic detail of how he killed that lady. I didn't know her. One of my customers came in the store on a Monday or Tuesday and was buying that beer. I told him of the man that killed that lady and my customer said it wasn't the beer that killed her. I told him he is correct, but when you are ""sober"" you aren't as big as you are when you are drunk. Wednesday came and went. Thursday came...he got into an argument with his wife and it could have been physical though the police are saying there weren't signs of physical altercations on her body. She was hit by a car and killed. Two woman are DEAD from men drinking this beer. Ironic?!?!?!?!?!? That is what I would like to know, which brought me to this site. stillbuff and i quote says on here (7-2-12) ""totally tasted the booze and thoughts of doing bad sh*t immediately came through my head which told me that this was a good malt liquor."" THOUGHTS OF DOING BAD SH*T IMMEDIATELY CAME THROUGH MY HEAD...hmmm. Another quote from thekevlarkid (1-29-12) ""Nothing to speak of and clearly just a beer that's trying to get people ripped so they'll be half conscious when they mug someone in a row house and smoke their chiba one the street before being hit by a car because that is how it is done here in Balitmore. Awesome."" BEFORE BEING HIT BY A CAR. Yep! That is how it is done where I am too because now there are FIVE children without a beautiful mother. Death is something serious that doesn't happen every day and for two men to be involved in deaths with women after drinking this beer, is it ironic or is it THE beer??? I am not going to try it!"

"O - Overall, Pretty good for what it is but only a decent beer in general. Would do well at a party. This was the last one of these at the small grocery store that I work at and it had been sitting for a few months so it's probably a bit stale but whatever."
""
""
""

"OVERALL: This is a sweet one dimensional beer that will get you drunk. Play your beer pong with caution dudes."

"Overall, not terrible for a malt liquor. If I had to drink ghetto-style, this would be my choice. Not great, but not terrible, and still tastes sort of like a beer."
"After reading a few of the other reviews, I really wish I'd been at County Line beach and drank this as StillBuff did! ROFL on the ""...thoughts of doing bad sh*t..."""

"Its worth a try once...its way better than Natural Ice...that being said...its slightly above average.lol"
"Best Malt liquor on the market."
"Had a real ""suck"" taste. Being a man of no money I have a lot of experience with malt liquors and I still enjoyed this. Totally tasted the booze and thoughts of doing bad sh*t immediately came through my head which told me that this was a good malt liquor. Sent some real stupid texts to chicks after this beer... Drink this if its on sale."
"O: I am really not hating this like I expected to. It's certainly not very good, but it only serves one purpose (getting drunk on the cheap), and in that regard, it fulfills exactly what it sets out to do. Worth a try if you can get it inexpensively like I did, just don't expect much."
"O - For all intents and purposes this reminds me of an ice beer."
"O: Not very flavorful even in comparison to other beers in the style, goes down ok and not too filling since there isn’t a lot to the beer, good kick, decent representation of style, as the name implies this beer is basically Natty Ice with more alcohol."
""
""
"O - One of the better malt liquors I've had. Not bad."
"Overall – The mouthfeel is the nicest component of the beer. It really is not the best malt out there and with it being more expensive then something like a Steel reserve and being, at least in my mind, of lesser quality, I am not sure why someone would choose this brew if looking for something low cost and high potency."
""
"This is a drinkable beer that's actually very much ignored. Rightfully so. This is not a good beer."
"The pour is a clear, pale, golden yellow color with a white head. A lot of corn, corn syrup, and sugar. Maybe some fruity esters and cereal/grain sweetness to it. Just really quite sweet. Some pear and apple esters along with lots of grain and sugary sweetness. Definitely heavy on the corn. Another fine malt beverage."
"D - Actually pretty decent - I suspect this is just Natty Light before they cut it with water. Other than the finish you could actually drink this with some nachos. Expensive for the style at $1.69."
""
"This beer is easy to drink and will easily quench a thirst. There's nothing offensive about it but there's nothing particularly good either. It' almost perfectly average but the lack of a decent head and lack of carbonation leave it below average. As a side note, my Natty Daddy was 6% abv. Other reviews showed an 8% abv."
"Out of a can this beer was a clear, pale, golden color with one finger of fluffy white head. The retention was not bad and it left streaks of lacing. The aroma was of corn, sweet malt, cheap booze and an artificial sweetness akin to candy. The flavors were similar, being pretty much the standard grainy booze and sweet malt trying to hide the grainy booze. Nothing to speak of and clearly just a beer that’s trying to get people ripped so they’ll be half conscious when they mug someone in a row house and smoke their chiba one the street before being hit by a car because that’s how its done here in Baltimore. Awesome. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/light and the carbonation high."
"O - Come on A-B. Really? Natural (Natty) Ice is competitive in it's class. This, well, isn't. I'd choose Hurricane High Gravity all day over Natty Daddy. I applaud you for trying, but you can do better."
"You can sorta taste the alcohol on this one and is definitely a party get buzzed fast sorta beer. With that being said though its a lot better and has a lot better of crisp fuller mouthfeel than the regular natty's and budweiser beers. The high alcohol at a cheap price without an offensive taste but more of a craft beer sorta fruitiness taste makes this an average beer that I wouldnt mind having again."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-four ounce aluminum can, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"This is a tool as much as it is a simple beer."
""
"Overall:	Not as bad as I thought it was going to be. You know when you buy a cheap single in a gas station what you are getting into usually."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can stamped 293-NB80. Sampled on December 17, 2011. Another American Malt Liquor to pound down from the brown bag! And it pours yellow with lots of fizz that fizzles fast. It is important to review this based on style rather than on who brews it. When I first break open the can I get an almost pear-like fruitness. But after I pour it into the my Retro Miller pint glass it becomes a typical grainy aroma with a sniff of yeast, bread, and clean, crisp hops sliding in from the backside. The texture is in the medium range and when swirling it on my tongue it turns to carbonated bubbles in about ten seconds. The taste is very much in tune with the malt liquor style with its pungent grainy and clean hop bite but it does not leave a sour aftertaste like so many other malt liquors. For a craft beer it gets a low rating. But strictly by style it is a tad better than others in this category."
"A final observation in that it was in a Rexam CAN. That may not mean much to the casual CANsumer, but it was my understanding that InBev/A-B had its own CANning division, separate from Ball, Crown, or Rexam. Things that make you go, ""Hmmm."""
"RJT"
"Overall Drinkability - Slightly above par. (for those of you who know nothing of golf, that means slightly less than average)"
"Drink it as cold as possible and with food, if you must."
"High alcohol Natty? saw this one last week at my local light night store and deceided to try it. why not? it pours normal clear and golden but the smell is really clean. I was surprised by the taste being so clean as well. I would not buy again unless i turn homeless but overall not too bad for a BMC product in tall boy format."
""
"I must say, my expectations weren't exactly that high for this, but I was really surprised. If it gets a little easier to find around here I would gladly pick this up again. Plus, at $2.69 for two of these, the bang-for-the-alcohol-buck is unbeatable."
""
"this is simply a higher alcohol more bodied version of natty light. not much to it. appears a darker yellow than normal AB beers. smells of a little alcohol, and maybe some corn and cereal. tastes like a more full bodied natty light. no hops or malts. mostly has some good flavors to it. cant really describe it. not much mouth feel. very carbonated. great for the price. but as a beer to just drink nothing special at all."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and grains. Taste is of green apples, some malts, maybe a touch of plastic? Some alcohol is present but not overpowering. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while nothing great, I have certainly had high gravity lagers far worse than this."
"That's it. I have no more to say other than, tick it if you must, but that's all it's good for. Yuck."
"Final note: Great swill. That last few gulps of warm malt liquor that can have a devastating effect on your opinion of the cheap beer you've been swiggin. In this case, not a big problem. Even after it warms up, it's perfectly tolerable. But like all malt liquors, it's much better cold."
"24 ounce can served up in a pint glass, this is horrible looking, smelling, and tasting beer. But there's the freshman year college student living in me that has to try this beer. WTF, it's fizzy yellow and high in alcohol. No head retention or lacing this beer looks like carbonated cider or apple juice. Aroma has a solvent chemical smell to it that really doesn't sit well with me, believe me this isn't the beer I'm going to reach for ever again. Flavor wise it's hard to believe they make something this horrible who pitched this to the marketing team, alright the insanely popular Natty Light has to be bigger let's call it NattyDaddy. Hard to swallow down, pretty smooth considering the alcohol content as far as any type of a burn. Harsh in the flavor cooked corn veggies a hint of metallic disgust and more chemical solvent no classic natural ingredients come to mind other than damn this came from a lab and a factory setting. Mouthfeel is horrible the flavor won't leave the palate this is getting dumped down the drain. That pretty much explains how I feel about 24 ounce malt liquor."
"This beer by it's very name is marketed to people who need to get drunk quick. Ever heard the term ""fratty light""? This is the same thing on steroids. And how can the can have ale and lager on the label at the same time? That is why I do know really know what style this is. Malt liquor I guess?"
