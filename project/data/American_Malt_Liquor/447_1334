Not really much for taste to write home about, there's of course a pretty obvious maltiness to it, besides that there's just like a stale bread taste which is just about as appealing as it sounds. I could be missing some flavors since i just chug it before it gets too warm or flat, but im sure im not missing much. When it comes to 40s though this is one of the better choices. Overall if you just want to get a buzz on the cheap, pick one of these up.

2.97,33.8,3.5,2.75,3,3,3,"From a quart bottle. Pours to an attractive thick white head and erratic but substantial lacing. Strange-looking clear tarnished gold color. aroma is sweet, alcoholic, but "vegetal" (asparagus?!) and grainy with no discernible hop character. Flavor is much of the same as aroma but very palatable and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly and surprisingly "smooth" as in it does not have astringency or excessive carbonic bite. Overall, this is drinkable and mostly unoffensive. Believe it or not. Not really good at all, but not bad. there are much worse cheap adjunct brews out there. I guess I'm not a beer snob after all. I reviewed this beverage on its merits as a cheap drink and party brew and give it no more than a 3.0 for any flavor or aroma ratings. Really. For the style, it is one of the best, but I'm not giving 4's all around for any "malt liquor" no matter how "on style" it is. Malt liquors are for getting a buzz, not craft beer savoring anyway.","EagleTalon","Sep 26, 2013"

I'm proud of my fellow countrymen; the fact that I've never seen anyone else stoop so low as to actually purchase this warms the cockles of my heart ever so slightly.

I truthfully don't care about what anybody says about this stuff. I loved it. It goes down smoother than any beer you could possibly buy in a 40 ouncer, And it tastes like something for triple the price. No it isn't perfect, But at $1.85 for a 40oz you absolutely cannot beat it. I never would have guessed that it rated in at 5.6% alcohol. I tasted no carbonation whatsoever, Surprising since it's looks like it would be filled to the brim with the stuff. This stuff is worth a try no matter what type of beer drinker you are","SometimesIfart","Jun 13, 2012"

Has a light mustiness and the hops are pretty non-existent.

The smell was sort of a nauseating sweet malt with some corn. The taste was the same, but with a twist. There were hops in this beer! I could clearly taste a slight piney flavour. Except it was real cheap and accentuated by the sweetness of the corn in such a way that it was more like Pine Sol. It was gross. Those piney-flavoured hops have no place in a malt liquor. As a result, this is now among my least favourite malt liquors and the worst 40 I've had so far. Oh well. At least now I know. I guess there's a reason this doesn't get sold anywhere near me.

Fermented grain, corn cobs and other slop left to ferment in the hot summer sun to be strewn before barnyard animals. Yum! The taste was actually better than the smell. It had a dry, cotton-candy-like sweetness thanks to their genius at biochemistry in developing a yeast strain that rips through fermentable sugars leaving only alcohol in its wake. No, really, it was bone dry but the residual sugars gave it a slight sweetness. It was pretty much the same ol', same ol'. Mouthfeel was fizzy on the tongue.

1.5,-32.4,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"I seem to be getting alot of cheap beer lately. Fortunately, I haven't payed for any of them. When I first poured this out of the can, I learned an important lesson. Don't pour this outta the can. Drink straight from the can. Grainy colour, carbonated, no head. Smelled of alcohol, malt and corn. Tasted the same way, with a terrible aftertaste. Drinking from the can was a slight improvement, in that I didn't smell the beer as strongly. God awful brew for those only interested in a cheap buzz, something not even I got from this.","slitherySOB","Jul 30, 2003"
1.55,-30.2,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,"This brew poured a small head of white medium sized bubbles that quickly disappeared leaving a carbonated weak light yellow body. It has that typical low quality rice beer aroma and a fizzy flavor. There is no real character to this gassy beverage. Burp!","TheDM","Jul 23, 2003"
1,-55,1,1,1,1,1,"24 oz. can. Oh yuck! Another American mass-produced beer. This beer poured a small white head with small-medium sized bubbles that quickly diminished. There was no lacing observed with this beer on the sides of my glass. There was carbonation observed rising to the top. It had a fruity nose.","hotstuff","Jul 15, 2003"
2.53,14,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Macro with an attitude. Looks like macro, tastes like macro on steroids, and priced like macro. Everything but appearance is a bit below average. This has been around a long time and hasn't improved. This is really a good marketing effort of a fairly poor beer.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 10, 2003"
2.38,7.2,3,2.5,2.5,2,2,"Not a bad malt. Its got a decent flavor, but is better when it's icy cold. Had a strong smell of alcohol and malt, and was a bit on the bitter side. If i am going to drink a malt, it's gonna be this. I'd say to those who are not versed in malts to try this one first, as i think this one is as good as it gets.","Frozensoul327","Mar 07, 2003"
3.15,41.9,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"It is actually far better than I thought it would be. There is no head, no colour, no aroma, no hops but there is a smooth malt taste with a nice warming alcohol finish. I think the smoothness and the lack of the generic macro metallic bite makes this stuff quite drinkeable. It has quite a good body and the carbonation is quite soft(nice!). It is very easy to drink if you are not in the mood for thinking about what you are drinking.","Brewzzle","Mar 05, 2003"
2.63,18.5,2.5,2,3,3,2.5,"Light, pale golden hue, white head, smallish with minimal retention. Unpleasant nose sulfur, sweet, and hints of grain. First few sips are shocking to the palate rebounds grainy & gritty, malty, sweet, underlying notes of spiciness. Not very flavorful, but not bad, alcohol is somewhat noticeable, drinkable for a Malt Liquor Beer. It is cheap (22 oz. bottle for $1.40) but that still wont motivate me to purchase this again.","bditty187","Jan 02, 2003"

2.31,4.1,2.5,1.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Colt 45 is a quaffable beverage, and probably considered a tame malt liquor. Easy to drink, and there's worse out there. No Colt 45 review is complete without giving props to Billy Dee, so: "it works every time."","Beastdog75","Dec 19, 2002"
2.73,23,2.5,2,3,3,3,"Conservatively priced at under $4.00 for a six pack, Colt 45 Malt Liquor will be there for you if the need should ever arise, ready willing and able to satisfy the most basic of needs for a beer.","BeerBob","Dec 19, 2002"
2.98,34.2,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Clear golden color with lots of fat bubbles and a small white head, quite good lace for the style. The most notable characteristic of the aroma is a strong alcohol presence, though there is a decent malt aroma which is a bit overpowered by the alcohol fumes. Taste begins with aggressive, spritzy carbonation and alcohol flavors. Beneath the alcohol flavor there is a decent cracker malt presence and some hops and grain as well. Finish is dominated by sweet alcohol flavors and a touch of hop bitterness. Mouth feel is pretty good for this style. This beer is a standout in a category that does not get much respect from beer connoisseurs. It also offers very good value for its modest price. I'll certainly buy this one again.","Pegasus","Dec 07, 2002"
3.01,35.6,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"if you look close enough at my pic, that's me as a baby playing with a Colt 45 can. since i can't get this brew in F-M, i picked up a six pack while home over thanksgiving. this beer holds a special place in my heart, since there is a story my parents told me about Colt 45 and how i was conceived. lol...anyway, on to the review...it pours out pale straw with a nice big foamy head and all kinds of lace that sticks forever! the anticiapted adjunct aroma doesn't offend..it's even expected and welcome. a nice creamy mouthfeel is followed by a bit of alcohol afterbite. it tastes pretty good for a malt liquor, probably the best malt liquor you can buy even. goes down smooth and easy. a nice warming sensation is detected after a few of these (i got a sixer of 12 ouncers). a very good malt liquor.","budgood1","Dec 04, 2002"
2.52,13.5,2,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"However, the taste is not bad....it isn't good either, but it is not bad. If a quick buzz is in your immediate forecast, this is the brew for you.","Shiloh","Nov 17, 2002"
3.3,48.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"12 oz. clear glass bottle with the "Call me to Win!" neck label that features a young hispanic or black woman. Classy! It pours a crystal clear straw gold body topped by a foamy bright white head that holds well. The aroma is lightly malty with a very light touch of hops. The body is medium with a standared carbonation that leaves it crisp in the mouth. The flavor is a well balanced, lightly sweet and grainy maltiness with an underlying bitterness and very limited hop flavor. It finishes dryish with a mild, lingering sweetness. This is less sweet and more balanced than many malt liquors on the market, although it doesn't seem as well brewed.","NeroFiddled","Nov 14, 2002"
1.8,-18.9,1.5,1.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,"Drinking this liquid from a paper bag, I feel like a rummy. The "malt" flavor is present, but drowned out by the overwhelming taste of bad alcohol. By bad alcohol, I mean a taste not unlike nail polish remover.","bewareOFpenguin","Oct 07, 2002"
2.13,-4.1,2,1.5,2,2.5,3,"Billy Dee says it is good, I will tried it again.  Pale straw with moderate head that lasts for a little while.  Sweet alcoholic tonic like aroma.  Beer is somewhat pedestrian with minimal hop bitterness and a full grainy mouthfeel from the use of corn and other veggies.  Finishes warm. But don't drink this warm.","psugrad98","Jun 27, 2002"
1.3,-41.4,1,1,1.5,1,1.5,"This is one of the few malt liquors I have tried.  A cheap 40oz favorite of a late friend(God rest his soul).  The color is bad, the smell is not any better and drinkablity should only be done quickly.","Wildman","May 30, 2002"
1.83,-17.6,2,1.5,2,1.5,2,"I can't believe this was the first beer I ever drank. Ah, the good ole days of chugging 40's of the Colt, bought at the ghetto party store and brought out under cover of cardboard boxes.  What the hell were we thinking?  Upon revisiting this beer, it is apparent that Billy Dee was using this to get his wimmins buzzed and not himself.  Somewhat sweet, taste of burnt corn and nearly flat.  Peace out.","proc","Apr 25, 2002"
2.75,23.9,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"It's cheap malt liquor. It will get you all f'd up. Just chug while its cold and get nicely tanked because that is definitely all you are looking for anyway. Am I wrong? I didn't think so.","IrishRedRock","Apr 14, 2002"
2.36,6.3,3,2,2,3,3,"I can't help but chuckle when I think of this stuff. Somehow this always found it's way back from the store in the old days when we would pitch in for beer. Strictly for those looking for a quick, nasty buzz.","John","Jan 07, 2002"

2.7,21.6,2,2,3,3,3,"Never considered trying this, but a buddy bought several types of really cheap beer to see which was the best (in a relative sort of way)  He put tape around the cans to hide the ID (have we got too much time on our hands, or what?).  Moderate body with a mildly alcohol front, a firm middle and a moderate, non-hop bitter finish. Not all that bad.  I about fell out of my chair when he peeled the tape off (I would have fallen out the chair anyway after a couple more).","Brent","Aug 24, 2001"
