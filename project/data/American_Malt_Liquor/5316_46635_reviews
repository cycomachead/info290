"Basically if you want a balanced controlled malt liquor with some decent taste look no further."
"Bottle: Poured a bright yellow color ale with a medium size white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of light cereal notes is pretty bland. Taste is also dominated by light cereal notes with adjunct barely noticeable. Body is about average with good carbonation. Nothing really special about that one and I canâ€™t say I would have notice this was malt liquor if it had been a blind tasting."

"TASTE: Malty sweet, slick, medium bodied, bready, growing warmth, slight hoppiness, husky, grainy, dried grass, mildly boozy, clean, semi-dry finish"
""
"Pours a typical clear yellow with a thick but effervescent white head. Aroma is malty, slightly fruity, crisp but unremarkable. Flavor is more fruity than malty, somewhat sweet but not cloying, not quite bold but better than what the aroma promises. Texture is smooth, but lacking in fizz or viscosity. OK, not so hot, but I am more of a stoutie; a lager lover should give it a fairer shake."

"and you know what? ratebeer has it at a 47 ! ! ! ! and we ALL know ratebeer has loose standards.... seems EVERYTHING is 15 to 25% higher rated on ratebeer... so I don't feel bad about this assessment at all..."
"overall, i feel like this is almost a gimmick beer or whatever, but in the same sense i can appreciate it because.. i've been there. i think we all have. this brings back memories of a forgotten (mainly due to blackouts) style of beer but in a very tasty effort. thanks, full sail, for making this."

"D - A well-executed malt liquor. Not the best craft attempt I've had, but a lot better than most mass-produced offerings. Would obviously lose the price/performance debate, but otherwise pretty true to style."
"2.0 D: Ehh, kinda sucks."

"A-"
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, and nail polish remover aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and alcohol flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some odd aromas but the flavors are tasty."

"This is getting a ridiculously high rating because it's hands down the best American Malt Liquor I've ever tried. Rate to style, right? This beer is just amazing and deserves a great rating."

"Poured into an Arrogant Bastard Ale pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a thin white head with good retention and slippery lacing. Aroma dominated by biscuit malt, a hint of citrus. Flavor is sweet bready malt, vague fruit esters and just a touch of pure alcohol. Pretty cool, the brewer captured the essence of a cheap malt liquor (malt and alcohol), but made it pleasantly drinkable. The hint of pure grain alcohol was genius and appropriate for the style. Medium bodied with a touch of creaminess, much too nice a mouthfeel for a malt liquor, but I appreciated it. I'm not sure I'd buy this as a go-to beer, but for an attempt to craft-ize a classic brown bag American style, they nailed it. I like this Brewers Share series. Most haven't knocked my socks off, but all are interesting and well worth trying."
"Fail."

"Overall, this is pretty darn solid. It really comes together after setting out of the fridge for a while. It's rare to get a quality beer in a $3.99 bomber in Ohio; cheers to Full Sail for that. For whatever reason, I never see their bombers in Columbus."

"22oz bottle from ""Habits"" in S.Salem. $3.99\ I am drinking this from the bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag. aroma from the bottle is mostly malty slightly caramel in aspect. Taste caramel,sugar and cheap vodka.. Mouthfeel very dry for style it helps. not great really..but i will drink it."
""
"22 oz bottle poured into a Samuel Adams Winter Lager glass. Took a whiff, found the fragrance but not the skunkiness of Mickey's. Slammed down a decent swig, like you oughta with malt liquor, and had a good experience all the way. There isn't hardly any head, and the brew is a respectable clear amber. No harshness like the corner brews like Olde English or Steel Reserve. It's too bad this is a limited release. It's great stuff, and just what you need for watching your favorite football team or monster movie."
"The malt body adds sweet grain and a drop of honey. Very quaffable. Enjoyable offering that is both true to the style and not a mere stab at ironic self-deprecation, nor intended for those who might use it as a tool for such shenanigans."
"Overall: drinkable and tasty example of the style. Perhaps not award-winning, but hey, I'm drinkin' a malt liquor here!"
"Taste has got to be the most quaffable malt liquor I have ever had. Nice little grain and alcohol, very little hops. What this has that most of the common MLs dont have is a nice caramel malt presence and a fine carbonation. As a beer in general, it is just ok, but as a malt liquor it is quite good. Coming from a craft brewery though, it just seems wrong in principle, so I cant morally give this beer perfect marks...sorry, I just cant. I might buy it again, depending on if I feel like having a reasonably priced high ABV bomber."
"O: There is nothing overly special about the taste of this beer but it is extremely drinkable and doesn't have any off flavors or a taste of alcohol."
"Overall. This didn't exactly knock my socks off, but like I said, not bad considering most of the others out there..."
"By the way, some argue that a malt liquor's high ABV ought to be taken into account in its review. I don't agree. There are plenty of beers out there with high ABVs that are also delicious. This one isn't."
"Poured into a becker a deep golden with a large one finger white head that faded pretty quickly leaving a few small chunks of lace behind.Aromas were light with a touch of sweet booze and toast malt,a little corn came into play as the beer warmed.The flavors were not nearly as potent and boozy as I thought they would be,grainy and lithly toasted with just a light zing of sweet alcohol,the corn/adjunct flavors were pretty well hidden.This is a standard for American malt liquor wich might not being saying a whole lot, but this was pretty damn good and easy going down for how big it is."
"O-pretty much what you would expect from a malt liquor. Even though it isnt a fancy style, I think its pretty cool that full sail decided to make one, just something different"

"Okay, I know I hate Malt Liquor but I decided to try this anyways (for $4 it was worth a shot). Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a golden color with a mid sized off white head. The smells are of a sweet malty aroma, not full of the corn adjuncts which normally turn me off to malt liquor. The feel is medium, decent carbonation. The taste is pretty good better than the cheap stuff. You get a sugary load of malts but grain which is nice."

"Lots of sweet barley malts up front, corn bread, touch of honey, spicy-citrus hops towards the end. Body is medium, crisp, a little dry and syrupy aftertaste. Nice carbonation. Alcohol well hiding."
"- Compared to a typical adjunct malt liquor, this is golden. But it doesn't really pop in any one direction except for maybe the nice Full Sail malt profile. It is however drinkable, and worth the purchase. I got a kick out of its charitable contribution choice though spousal abuse is no laughing matter."
"O - Sweet and un-eventful. Malty for sure."
"O: This is by far the best malt liquor I have ever had. Its one of those beers that i would drink all the time if it was year round. I got it for 3 bucks and well worth the price...Instead of giving me corn water BMC, give me something like this at a cheap price!"
"O: Really the least harsh Malt Liquor I've had. It's 8%, but never really feels like it. In a lot of ways it feels like a big pilsner. A fun beer to drink, and as long as Full Sail puts out good interesting sub-$4 bombers, I'm going to try them."
"On the other hand, it's a good beer. It's a good craft lager. The hops in it are not excessive for a lager and about as complex as a lager ever needs to be without going over the top. It's an excellent alcohol percentage for any beer in my opinion. It's just an all-around good lager. Not really what I would want to drink when I'm in the mood for the malt liquor style, though. As the previous review put it, Natty Daddy is better (within style)."
"O - I did not like this one at all. I would rather drink a Natty Daddy."
"3.5/3.5/4/4/3.5"

"The mouthfeel is quite good for the style and I had a bit of a dilemma rating the drinkability. Hey within the style (high abv malt liquor) this is super drinkable. I actually talked with the brewer on the way out of FS. He doesn't look old enough to drink. Nice guy and welcome to Full Sail and I am looking forward to your future brews!"
