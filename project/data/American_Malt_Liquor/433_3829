It smells like malt liquor and it also has that look. The taste is bold, sweet, and refreshing. This brew has a different aftertaste but it is not bad. This beer goes down smooth, but you can tell the 7.3 abv. There is nothing bad about this brew. This beer must be cold to drink.

It is a big beer and since it is a cheap beer, that means lots of adjuncts. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing regarding bouquet and mouthfeel. This is not a bad beer and you sure as shootin' could do a lot worse. I would recommend it to be consumed in limited quantities.

Sure, it tastes like Budweiser, but you will be way more intoxicated than you expect to be. Molson XXX packs a punch. If you want something cheap that gets you drunk, look no further. Not much in the taste/smell(reminiscent of corn) department, but it gets a 5 from me in the category of "how drunk I am after 2 of them" :) Refreshing, fun, overall I was glad I bought it and will probably buy it again unless I find another beer with 7.3 abv for 12.99 a 12 pack.","lilmissbeer","Mar 24, 2013"

Below average of the type. Definitely had a strong smell of cooked, Perhaps slightly burnt corn. Not too bad, but not impressive. The taste was better than expected for it being such a high alcohol beer. Lots of corn, And some waffles?. Over all pretty good flavor. The mouthfeel does let a little bit of the alcoholic side of this brew come through, Although at $5.49 for an almost certain drunk in a 6 pack, This stuff is unbeatable.

Heavy earthy cereal grain flavor with some semi-sweet wet hay flavor. The two best features of this beer is its decent somewhat creamy texture and its 7.3% alcohol content.

Smell is that bad molson smell, corny, wet cardboard, and the smell is definatly boozy, for ABV this high, no surprise. Im surprised this is brewed by molson, goes down kind of rough, has some hop bitterness, but finishes with blast of alcohol and cloying sweetness, decent. Mouthfeel is full, and surprisingly not over carbonated, and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good on this one, if you can keep it cold it really does go down easy, but if it warms, not so good. So i docked it .5 for that. Anyway, this beer was great for a high ABV ice beer, drink this for the buzz, not the taste.

Faint hit of hops near the end. Quick finish as far as the sweetness went, but there was some lingering coarse bitterness with a tingly alcohol/warmth. There's a little more body here than your standard industrial lager, which tempers the coarse carbonation just a little bit. Quite dry even with all the sweetness, and since it's not very crisp that really makes it less than an appealing drink after the first half glass.

Alcohol by volume at 7.3% in a beer this simple is most definitely the most dominating factor in taste and aroma, showing this beer's true colors.

Slight bitterness, some adjunct taste, good carbonation. The taste is remarkably clean for such a high ABV macro. The aftertaste is of sweet, faintly burning alcohol. This beer is meant to be had out of the bottle, not the glass. It's really very easy to drink. I certainly like it better than the other Molsons I've tried (Golden, Light, Canadian, Export). And it will drop you like a brick if you choose to drink it like any other macro. My head still aches after throwing back a case with some friends last night. Overall it's pretty good, coinsidering.","99bottles","Mar 27, 2004"
2.5,1.2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"This isn't entirely bad, but I'll leave this stuff to those that just want a quick buzz. I was really surprised the alcohol doesn't dominate the brew, but I still wouldn't consider drinking this on a regular basis by any means.","Beastdog75","Mar 25, 2004"
2.71,9.7,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Well I was hoping for a decent offering from Molson and this comes pretty close,pours a deep yellow with not much head to speak of,aroma is lightly biscuity and grainy and some alcohol notes.Taste is slightly sweet and grainy but not much to it a lightly flavored higher alcohol brew but not much to it. Good for drinking with some bbq but not something to savor by any means.","oberon","Mar 20, 2004"
1.83,-25.9,2.5,2,1.5,2,2,"Molson XXX is one of those beers that I always heard my non beer-afficionado friends talk about having to sneak into the US because it was so crazy potent. Kind of funny considering 7.3% really isn't that high compared to other (better) beers that have been available all along. So now we have Molson XXX available at every grocery store. Cause for celebration? Not really. The beer is a clear light orange color with a minimal white head, and no real lacing to speak of. Light malt aroma. Medium body, and the flavor seems more like a standard Lager than Malt Liquor. Very boring mmalt/hops combination, with a hint of alcohol. The finish is bubbly without a lot of flavor. Pass.","Dogbrick","Feb 12, 2004"
2.86,15.8,3,2,3,3,3.5,"But for it's vaguely unpleasant appearance, and sour smell, it actually tastes pretty good. One of the better macros that I have ever had, and goes down smooth, so smooth you can find yourself in trouble pretty quickly-if you can stomach it at all. Tastes more like corn than anything, and water more than anything like corn. Oddly refreshing, but certainly not a 'premium beer.'","hustlemuscle","Feb 03, 2004"
3.33,34.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"The first for me of the Molson line-up and it turns out to be a pretty good XXX. The beer pours a pure, clean looking gold with a smaller than expected white head that settles to a thin film after abit. Lace is carbonated and shortlived on the glass. The nose is alittle grassy with hints of alcohol. The taste is of alcoholic malt thats brown sugar sweet. Not too sweet but balanced by the alcohol more than the hops, which tend to hide. The mouth feels carbonated, perhaps an adjuncts feel,soft cotton. Drinkability is smooth. Make it cold for a crisp alcoholic bite. Not a bad offering to lead me to look into others in this line.","chilidog","Feb 01, 2004"
3,21.5,3,3,3,3,3,"The alcohol content isn't what I expected it to be. I though it would be higher. I'm glad. It didn't taste like a high alcohol beer. It was good.","CBFanWish","Jan 12, 2004"
2.8,13.4,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Like most of the reviewers have mentioned, I bought this at Canadian duty-free shops under the idea that "Wow, this is high alcohol, and cant get it in the US" and when I saw it in the cooler at Sapphire's, figured I'd give it a try. It wasn't quite as bad as I expected, and though not a world beater (and I've clearly had ABVs far higher), it's not terrible either.","beergeek279","Dec 30, 2003"
3.55,43.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Recommended.","Fiset35","Dec 30, 2003"
3.64,47.4,3,4,3.5,3,4,"I'm unsure of the quality, especially as it pours a pale yellow, so the glass is filled only half way. There is no head to speak of. The nose, however, offers a spicy parade of pineapple, porridge and cane juice. On the palate it is strong and sweet with chewy, fruit gum and tea flavors. Fizzy and dry with slightly rancid tannins on the finish, this is serious beer. Secondary elements of butterscotch, paper, sweet alcohol, <a href="http://get-access.com?" onmouseover="window.status = 'goto: flowers';return 1" onmouseout="window.status=''">flowers</a> and green wood appear as it warms.","putnam","Dec 24, 2003"
2.93,18.6,2.5,2,3.5,3,3,"Wow. This is Canadian Malt Liquor, pure and simple. Pours golden with a fizzy, short-lasting white head. Aroma is harsh, fusel alcohol and sweet adjunct. Flavor is surprisingly full for such a beer, with no watery taste whatsoever, and is actually beer-like. But if you let this beer get anything greater than fridge temps and you'll feel it's wicked punch, and that's not necessarily a good thing. Decent malt liquor, and I'm reviewing it as such.","rabidawg","Dec 15, 2003"
2.76,11.7,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Really not horrible for a macro, and packs a punch; I can see why it was hallowed back in the day. Throw in a fancy yeast, a little more malt, and you could convince people they had something exotic and expensive.","shirfan","Dec 13, 2003"
2.78,12.6,2.5,2,3,3.5,3,"Nothing impressive about the look or smell of this beer. The taste is alright. Better than most other macro-brewed beers. The flavor is pretty good when ice cold, don't let it warm up. In fact one nice thing about the higher alcohol content is that you can get it colder in the freezer without freezing it than regular Molson. It has a good mouthfeel considering it's competition (Molson Can., Bud, etc.). Somehow it is very drinkable but can easily sneek up on you. I could definitely down a few of these with some hot wings while watching the Red Wings. But there is so much more out there to try why bother.","bigbubba","Dec 11, 2003"
2.65,7.3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"It pours out with a straw color (much like any of the big 3 beers here in the states) and a white head with little to no head retention. Perhaps the best way to describe this beer is by calling it molson golden on steriods. Not a great beer not a bad one, it does not have too much flaver, very little hops, and very little malt, however it does have a kick which makes it almost worth drinking.","Ianhockey91","Sep 16, 2003"
2.6,5.3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Strong alcohol kick and taste, the story I've been told is this cannot be imported to the US because it would have to be labeled as malt liquor and Molson doesn't want that, it exists mainly to be in duty free shops waiting for Americans to bring it home (both 'facts' from Canadian bartenders - they sound good enough to me). Straw color, light head. I started buying it when I first started drinking, and even now years later I'll still pick it up every time I come back from Canada. Most of the appeal is as a forbidden fruit. It's better than AB products in every way - color, taste, ABV. King of the macrobrews.","mschofield","Aug 22, 2003"
2.73,10.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Gold with a very short head that was short lived. Smelled like an average beer but seriously, this isn't a "taste me I'm a great beer". It's got 3 huge, silver X's on the front! This is the beer for slamming and getting ripped faster than the other MacroCrapperies can do it. Might as well enjoy the taste while you're doing it but like it's little brother Bradour it better be going down cold!","Ahhdball","Jul 21, 2003"
2.73,10.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"This is a nice potent canada brew... My folks left a few in the fridge for me so I drank them. Not a great beer, but it acomplishes what it sets out to acomplish. Da buzz comes on quick. Better than other non US import brews from canada that I've sampled","scottum","Jan 30, 2003"
2.38,-3.6,3,2.5,2,4,2,"Sulfurous odor hits the nose like an errant high-stick dipped in stewed vegetables. Cloying flavor is only accentuated by the hops. Ugh. Ice-brewed: I think I'd rather eat the leftover ice than drink a triple X. Unless you're a sadist, not recommended.","inebrius","Dec 29, 2002"
2.79,13,3.5,2,3,3,3,"Pours a very clear golden/yellow hue with a thick white head which actually left lacy trails down the sides of my .5 liter mug. Tastes similiar to other macros, a metallic kind of flavor. A present from My Dad, who brought it back from a fishing trip in Canada.","jtw5877","Dec 20, 2002"
1.51,-38.9,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,1,"A buddy had a sixer of this he had carried back with him from Canada. Since he was in a sharing mood it would be rude of me to refuse...right? In this case I should have. Try this only if you like sickly sweet highly alcoholic tasting malt liquor. I could barely finish the 12oz. bottle. Yuck. This stuff should only be consumed with a paper bag around the bottle.","John","Sep 24, 2002"
