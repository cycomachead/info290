3.48,59.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Somebody in one of the forum posts about CANs in general and The CANQuest (TM) in particular was put off by the auditory nature of CANs. He hated the ""glug, glug, glug"" noise associated with a CAN pour, if you CAN believe it. My brother, when they package beer in a 24 fluid ounce CAN and you want to transfer it into a glass with a minimum of spliiling, ""GLUG!"" is all you're gonna hear! I had a whole buncha bone-white foam as the result of trying to pour into the glass and not the keyboard, but let's be fair and honest and call it about a finger with good retention after settling. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was closer to an adjunct lager than a malt liquor. It was honey-sweet underlain with whatev. There was a little of the fusel sharpness of the style, but I have been subjected to far worse in this epic journey, believe me. Really, this was not obnoxious and for a high gravity malt liquor, that is saying something. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was the standard sweetish fuel-like intensity of the style. Finish was bone-dry and I began to wish for a Hammond's pretzel as an accompaniment. Beautiful, heavy lacing throughout. I am not a fan of the style, by any means, but this was pretty dang good as they go. tone77, where did you find this in a CAN? I'm not recommending it for the cooler, but it might be something worthwhile in a paper bag without the weight of glass and a whole 40 to oneself.

It smelled a bit corny, but this is a malt liquor. The flavor is a corny sweetness that has a definite alcohol bite at the end since there is not enough malts or hops to balance it out, but again this is a malt liquor. Malt liquors are not my favorite, but every so often I get brave and want to rekindle my relationship with beers I drank when I was younger and poorer.

This is not nearly as common as its non-high gravity cousin, in fact, I usually have a hard time finding it. The beer is a dark golden color, when consumed out of the bottle, some head is stirred up. The smell is somewhat unpleasant, it is reminiscent of burnt vegetables. The taste is slightly astringent, but it goes down smooth enough, in fact, I think it has a unique and fairly pleasant flavor.

The alcohol, though stronger, is hardly even there taste wise. I had to go to a seedy store to get it and that was the only drawback.

3.3,51.4,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"The body is a clear yellow when held to the light, but appears more amber in the glass. It's creamy, bright white head holds surprisingly well for a beer with so much alcohol; and it slowly drops to a thin surface covering, leaving some nice lace at the outset. Sweet, very lightly grainy malt greets you in the nose with a very delicate fruitiness. It's quite clean. It's medium-bordering-on-full bodied with a fine carbonation that's lightly effervescent and gently caresses the tongue. Crisp yet smooth. The flavor delivers a lightly grainy maltiness that's somewhat surprising as most examples as so obviously adjunct laden, and it's sweetness is tempered more by its alcohol than its low-key bitterness. It finishes drying despite its sweet malt with a wash of drying alcohol and dull bitterness - although some malt does linger. Overall, it's a surprisingly clean and well-made malt liquor that probably deserves a little more respect than it gets.","NeroFiddled","0"
2.26,3.7,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,"bronze color, nice big thick head when poured into a glass. some cooked corn/adjunct aroma, not unpleasant. full bodied and a fairly smooth mouthfeel, the taste wavers back and forth from corn to corn syrup...a pretty harsh alcohol bite...after an overly sweet burnt sugar taste...and after swallowing....a burning sensation of alcohol settling in the stomach. at 8.0% ABV, this brew is designed to do one thing, and that is to get you buzzing hard and fast. it might be a good beer to soak bratwurst in before grilling...otherwise, as far as malt liquors go...it's not terrible but be careful. one forty should be enough in one sitting.","budgood1","0"
