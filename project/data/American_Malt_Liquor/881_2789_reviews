"T- tasted much like the above, but due to it's high alcohol content..you don't have much time to really analyze its bite"
"There might be worse examples of the style, but I hope not. This shows the worst of the stereotypical malt liquor. A waste of 99 cents plus tax. sweet with nail polish and soap. There are better, more balanced (more flavored) malt liquors out there. This is insta-headache. Couldn't quite finish the first half, even with determination."

"Five X's on the front of this can. Isn't that the international label for poison. This stuff didn't kill me, just made me wish it had. A pale yellow with a frizzy white head. The nose is especially grainy. The flavor profile is flat and of bitter alcohol. Quite a light body and too much carbonation. Not highly recommended."
"overall, this is not a beer that i believe i will be able to finish, never will buy again"
"It pours cloudy, and not for good reasons. This is just plain nasty. I forced myself to quaff half of the 24 ounce can, but I couldnt even stomach the rest. This is a shitty beer among shitty beers."
"I will continue to pick these guys up when I need a quick and cheap pick me up."
"I bought this beer at a liqour store for 2.99 for a four pack. It seems to have a warm sensation once swallowed due to the high alcohol and the mouthfeel is very heavy and thick. Never bothered to pour it into a mug though. It smells very grainy and cheap. Although this beer is one beer you would like to drink if you just wanted to get smashed. All in all for 2.99 you pay for what you get!"
"Surprisingly, this wasnt horrible.... but then again, it wasnt all that good either. But in the realm of really-cheap 40's, this one doesnt do too horribly. (Hmm, I just got a bit of a grape taste in there. Interesting.) Anyway, for a cheap warm buzz, this one will do the trick. A good nominee for nights out drinking with the guys out at the old hunting shack. So taking style into account, I ALMOST give this lowly-raked malt liquor a thumbs up."
"Overall, it's certainly not the worst malt liquor I've ever had.. that award 's been earned by the King Of Beers with their ""Hurricane"". Nor is it the best. I'd place it middlin' to middlin'-bottom. Could be much better... don't complain to me if you get hammered and kill your neighbor or wake up with the worst hangover you've ever had and call in sick ""forever"" - I warned you! Oh, and if there really is a ""Satan", it's more likely that he's involved with this beer than anything by the name of ""Duvel"". ;)"
"Drinkability: I'd rather have a 211 High Gravity, this is pretty hard to throw back. None the less, this wasn't brewed to be delicious, and it gives a hell of a head rush especially if you drink it fast."
"Ah, Camo... how can you turn down a malt liquor in a camoflagued bottle? This stuff is strong, but it tastes absolutely horrible. It's best used for college drinking games. I used to start out every party with 2 Camo 40s... it's one of those rare malt liqours that don't taste better with the second bottle. It's more of a conversation piece than anything else. Everyone should try Camo at least once (drinking a 99 cent malt liquor does gives you life experience). It's terrible, but it's hillarious."
"I work at a distributer that sells this beer so I had to try it. At first open I thought that the high alcohol smell would make for a bad beer. After a couple sips, it was actually pretty good. I would compare it to Miller High Life....except that you get SMASHED after two or three beers. Since Beer is for the purpose of getting drunk...this is the right one. If it taste good and serves it's purpose, why not take this one. Since I do work at a distributor that sells high end beers, If anyone ask for a good beer that will serve its purpose, I will HIGHLY RECOMEND CAMO>"
"I suppose this was inevitable, I had to review Camo. I'm reviewing it straight from a 40 oz. Let us see if I can drink the whole think without barfing. The last time I had one of these I made it through a third of it and poured it out, but tonight I'm desperate. The appearance is okay. It pours a caramel color with little froth and lacing. The smell is slightly strong but other than that it is flat. The taste, oh dear god in heaven the taste, is probably the worst thing to be called beer, excluding Camo Genuine Ale. (Half way done.) The taste is strong with alcohol and horribly sweet as if sweetened with Splenda. The taste is definitely not the high point of the beer. (Pretty drunk now.) The mouthfeel is a little thicker but sour. It has bad drinkablity. I can't chug it because it wouldn't give me enough time to get to the sink. There was maybe 3 or 4 mouthfulls left but I gotta barf anyway. A horrible beer that can serve a purpose if low on cash or self esteem."
"Pours an extra clear pale straw, and a three finger head dissipates quickly, but will not lose a thin ring of foam. Laces nicely as well. Apple esters and alcohol fusels are faint, and make up the only aromas. Immediate ester sweetness and grainy alcohol taste, with a pale lager flavor and spent hop bitterness to back it up. The light body and active carbonation soften the blow of unbalanced cidery alcohol, and the semi-dry aftertaste boosts drinkability, but there is still little to discern this from other high gravity beverages."
"If they would just put some hops in this beer, it would be ok."
"Very light bodied, with a limp, languid finish, the main staying aspect being the affect of the booze on the brain. Unpleasant flavor, if any. gonna have to save myself, and toss the rest...this is not fun, and, again, you only drink this if you want to get F'ed Up. Well, more power to you, but I'll stick to tastier vehicles for that particular project."
"Damn Gas & Grab had these advertised for $.99  guess they were trying to get rid of the crap and I fell for it hook, line and sinker. Crap stank like gym socks, and tasted like someone had barfed in the can. One of the only *beers* (tongue in cheek) that I almost didn't finish (gagged down about 2/3, then chugged the final 1/3), and could be one of the few reviews on this site that I stick with a *1*"
"Clear 40 bottle with camoflage designs and a lot of x's on it. Medium yellow color. Smells of skunky alcohol. Taste makes you think of never drinking beer again. Harsh corny sweetness and lots of alcohol. Purely disgusting, woke up with a terrible hangover the next morning."
"In Vegas on Fremont St. watching the show, half way through the can the back of my brain started with a dull numb feeling. Smelled clean with a slightly sweet alcohol vapor. Tasted clean with a lemon-lime and rose like alcohol. A tad grainy in the finish with some sweet corn in the back. This beer is obviously produced for people that want a quick buzz."
"Drinkability would be zero if that were an option. Split a 24oz can three ways and all three of us struggled to finish our 8oz. Avoid at all costs."
"You do the math."
"The taste is sweet and grainy. A slight warmth in the finish. Not exactly balanced and easily drinkable, but this stuff is certainly better to me than any light beer or the really damaged Schlitz at the bottom of my ranking sheet."
"OK... I'm probably one of very few people to ever pour this into a glass! This is meant to be swilled directly from the can or bottle for the sole purpose of getting shitfaced very cheaply. Appearance was typical macro-piss yellow. A large, coarse white head quickly disappeared. Smell was a sickening mixture of cooked corn and alcohol. Taste was surprisingly sweet (nearly cloyingly so!) with maybe a hint of malt flavor, then loads of corn and alcohol. No hint of hops. Mouthfeel was thin and fizzy. If you're going to drink this, try to keep it as cold as possible... it gets worse when warm! I'll give it this, though: for what it is, it was amazingly smooth! So, I guess it succeeds as an alcohol delivery system... if not as a tasty beer!"
"Camo is the strongest, cheapest swill I have ever had. At 8.5% ABV it serves one purpose, getting you shitfaced for small price. The 24 oz. cans are always trouble, but in it's 40 oz. incarnation it's bearable when served ice cold, but you better get it down before it warms up or you'll be making love to the porcelain god all night long. If you have $3 bucks and REALLY wanna get wasted, this stuff is second to none, but otherwise steer clear of this crap at all costs."
"oh snaps. the camo tall boy. no one poors this out come on. but the can is camo colored! so it makes up for the fact that this beer looks like typical crapola. the smells is of alcohol, nasty grains and maybe paint thinner i dont know, but it isnt pleasant. the taste? well if served ice cold, the goal is to swallow as much of the devil fluid as possible because once you stop and breath your senses will wake up to how truly fould this stuff is.the mouthfeel is thin and mineralish and finishing the tall boy can be a little challenging, especially if it has started to warm, but you can do it cow poke. this is also one of those beers that gives you the nasty shitty drunk, so be forewarned. but hey for 99 cents a tall boy, what did you expect....have fun..."
"Fizzy pale yellow beer. Large head. Aroma is a cross between wet cardboard and three day old garbage. It';s sweet, full of corn and watery, medicinal tasting and 8.6% alcohol, and on the bad side its only 8.6 % alcohol. This is by far the worst beer I've ever rated. I can't drink any more so the rest of this rating is from memory. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is medicinal. Aftertaste is alcohol and sweet. Turned on the tap and garbage disposal when I poured the rest of this crap down the drain..."
"24oz.Can. This beer poured a medium creamy/soapy white head with fine-small sized bubbles that quickly diminished.The body was clear and carbonated. The hue of this beer was golden and there was no lacing.The nose was that of alcohol and it had a very weird flavor to it.This beer had a burning sensation as it was swallowed, it was bitey, it had an aftertaste that lingered and it was just plain unpleasing to my palate."
"Ok, I thought I would get this, because it looked cheesey. I mean, come on, a camoflage can? Well, I was expecting something rather bland and without distinction. Sure, it's no Weste 12, but it's got it's perks. The color was a reddish/straw color. Had no head whatsoever after a few minutes. Sure the head started out big and fluffy, but fell back quicker than the Iraqi army. But seriously folks, this wasn't a bad brew as far as Malts go. It's got a kind of flat citrusy taste to it mixed with alcohol. The alcohol is strong at 8.5%. Lemme tell you, it ain't masked either. The alcohol is out there and showin' everything it's got!"
"F."
"I wasted $1.59 for this 40 ounce, which I struggled to finish a glass of, I guess not every beer is worth reviewing."
"I picked up three of the 24oz cans, and within a few hours I was back in the form of a can of camo. I had been possessed by the Camo HGL, and found my self buying a case of twelve 24oz cans, that I still regret to this day. Drink with restraint or in restraints, your choice, but preferably the latter, everyone will be a lot safer."
"high octane, high probability that you could breath fire with this stuff.  sweet and full of alcohol.  only sensation i can detect is of burning alcohol in my belly.  and a numbing of my brain. i suppose this beer serves a purpose....a fast and quick buzz for cheap.  use with caution!"
