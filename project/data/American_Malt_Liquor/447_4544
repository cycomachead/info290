3.55,33.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"From what i take out of colt 45 double malt, it pours a nice soapy head in my mug. good 2 finger head that goes down pretty quick.. The smell is kinda appealing, like a adjunct lager smell or hell a regular colt 45. the taste/mouthfeel is bold, easy drinking and very carbonated... I think it has a rich full body feel and very easy drinkable for a malt liquor.","MarkSmith86","Feb 23, 2014"
2.06,-22.6,2,1,2.75,3,1.5,"The beer smells like pee. Honestly. With a hint of staleness and saltiness. But tasting it is ok. Its a bland mouthfeel with bland carbonation that could honestly be heaver. I expected a sweeter taste than reg. Colt 45 due to it's double name. I expected a sweet malt corn flavor, instead just got the usual corn with a heavy alcohol taste.","ChiChi","Jan 20, 2014"

3.78,42.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Okay I'll buy a day of swill beforehand, but I like this beer! I got a finger of rocky, bone-white head with decent retention off of my pour. Color was liquid sunshine in a glass. Nose was full of adjuncts, but as the Grateful Dead sang (sort of), "Scent's all empty, but I don't care." Am I allowed to cop to my first sexual experience with a DeadHead cougar in 1983? I still dig the unshaven, Euro-style cuties. Finish was smoooth. Yum. Of all of the b**ls**t (no acronyms) this afternoon, this was decent.","woodychandler","Feb 11, 2013"

3.34,25.6,3.25,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.25,"O: I have long considered the standard Colt 45 to be one of the best commercially available malt liquors out there, but this variation is interesting - less sweet and carbonated than its brother, but as I think the name is trying to suggest, possesses some actual malted barley flavor. Carbonation was disappointing in my poured sample, but afterwards I took a drink directly from the bottle and that luscious high carbonation was there. A good option for the style.","fastrodney","Jan 08, 2013"

3.06,15,3.75,2.75,3,3.75,3,"Overall – Well… it looked fairly decent and when it is cold, it drinks rather easy and crisp. Once it warms up some however it is not quite as easy drinking. Even so when warmer it is still a step above other malts as it doesn't leave a real offensive taste on the tongue.","Darkmagus82","Nov 25, 2012"

2.7,1.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"colt 45 was not as bad as I thought it would be. the brew poured a decent colour for a lager, and the smell was neutral enough when it was cold. the taste was comparable to a shitty craft brew or a regular lame pils. really not bad compared to shit like icehouse or olde english.","erz316","Jul 01, 2008"
3.27,22.9,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a clear 40 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very malty. Taste is crisp, malty but not as much as it smelled. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and goes down fairly easily. Overall as far as malt liqours go, this one ain't bad","tone77","Jun 04, 2006"
2.6,-2.3,3,3,2,3,3,"It's very similar to the original Colt 45, but the 'double malt' does make it taste much maltier. It's color is darker than straw yellow and has a 'bleached-white' head. The alcohol creeps up on you but won't give you the spins. Not a bad beer if you're completely broke and are looking to get hammered.","mecell2000","Mar 06, 2005"
3.99,50,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Keep in mind I'm reviewing this as per the style. This is a damned good malt! I've had a 40 or two of it in the past, and always enjoyed it. Having seen this replace Crazy Stallion at my local bodega, I was excited to give it another solid try. I picked up three 16oz. cans and I am glad I did. Crisp, clean taste, just the sort of shit you're looking for when buying malt tall-boys after a day's labor. I'm not sure the 'double malt' gimmick means anything at all, but this stuff is definitely cleaner-tasting than regular Colt 45. If you see it, buy it.","MarkBlackout","Dec 07, 2003"

2.73,2.6,2.5,2,2.5,3,4,"Didn't pour it, just sipped on it. It is a very sterilized-looking yellow color, and smells of alcohol and cheerios. Doubling the malt makes this a rather thick brew, for good or worse. It is a great bargain for ~$2, for not that bad of an experience.","TastyTaste","Jul 31, 2002"
