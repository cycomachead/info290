2.18,-12.4,3,2.5,2,2,2,"Harsh astringent feel, a winning combination of coarse overcarbonation and sharp astringent grape/apple flavors. This needs to be consumed with pretzels or something to cleanse the palate immediately, the aftertaste is taunting my gag reflex. Wet manila folders, grape juice, communion wine. Watery and fizzy, a flaccid and utterly bland industrial lager. Not planning to finish the rest of this.","emerge077","Jul 02, 2011"
2.14,-14.1,3.5,2,2,2.5,2,"The seventh entry in SwillFest 2011. It pours a clear straw topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises harsh vanilla and cream soda, wheat, and corn syrup. Hoofah, indeed! The taste unfortunately brings in more of the same, though the corn syrup is slightly sweeter and there's a bit of light wheat thrown in for good measure. Well, good is a strong word. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dryly syrupy feel. Overall, a malt lickah that wants to be a cream ale, but instead fails at both professions.","TMoney2591","Beers"
2.5,0.4,3,3,2,3,2.5,"This is pale golden. There is corn smell on the nose. I really think this is truly a sad excuse for anything close to tasting good. The flavor is pretty terrible.

3.65,46.6,3,3,4,3.5,4,"For what it is, this is unbelieveably drinkable. Decent flavor, goes down well, and super cheap. It's the malt liquor trifecta.

2.94,18.1,4,2.5,3,3,3,"A rocky finger of bone-white head with decent retenion. Color was a deep, golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a very mellow taste.

2.38,-4.4,4,3.5,2,2,1.5,"Poured from a can into a weizen glass. Has a rich golden color with a reddish hue to it and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is fairly pleasant, a little sweet. I was looking foward to my first sip. Well the taste is not so good. Almost like bitter corn. This beer is also bitter in the mouth. I struggled to finish my 24 oz. can. Not a good beer at all.","tone77","Dec 11, 2008"
2.78,11.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Pale yellow with a big foamy head that quickly recedes into a skim. Smell is grits and faint toasted grain. Tastes sweet upfront with spent grain in the finish. Medium bodied and not really a good malt liquor IMO, I'm guessing the ABV is fairly low for the style, somewhere in the 5-6% range. More like a cheap ""ice"" beer than malt liquor to my taste buds.","biggred1","Nov 24, 2008"

2.6,4.4,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2,"There's something about this malt liquor. It isn't too high in ABV, so doesn't taste like gasoline like other malt liquors.

Unfortunately, even though this is a decent 40 (I was wondering why they changed the name until I read the review of the lawsuit) I am not feeling well now after drinking it, hurting its drinkability.","clayrock81","Aug 02, 2006"

Neither one of these beers is all that wonderful, possibly because the ABV isn't high enough for some serious malt liquor action. I tend to like the 'no holds barred' versions of this style the best.

2.18,-12.4,2,1.5,2.5,3,2,"From a 40 oz bottle split with PiecesOfFlair. Pours out to a medium orange golden color with a spit-like head. No lace. I can't smell anything. Maybe some malt? I can't tell. Taste is tolerable but far from enjoyable. Light sour malt, sweet alcohol, corn. Ugh. Mouthfeel is rather rich but doesn't make up for the poor flavor. Drinkability is questionable. A decent malt-liquor, but does that really give you any indication of how good it is? Pass on it, unless you must.","Frozensoul327","Mar 15, 2006"

It is one of the cheapest beers available, ounce for ounce, here in scenic Bed-Stuy. Its got a bit of a sharp, off-taste component to its basic malt liquor adjunct-funk, but nothing to whine about.

The label reminded me of the Arizona Iced Tea bottles and according to Nero's review I guess they are the ones who are responsible for the bottling here. Appears a golden with a white frothy shot lived head leaving minimal lacing. As far as the aroma goes it's light but there are some nice tones here sweet grain, very clean subtle floral notes possibly some hops in there. Taste is very solid I'd imagine there is some alcohol considering the malt liquor label but it's probably the cleanest tasting malt liquor I have ever tasted sweet rolling flavor some fruit edged tones in there and not a bad beer simple light refreshing best of all no gag reflex occurs with each sip. Mouthfeel is extremely thin no texture to this beer even smooth carbonation in the sense that it's not too harsh on the throat with each gulp of this bad boy. Drinkability for a college student like myself if I'm going for the buzz this maybe an option in the future under two bucks I can't complain solid malt liquor no off flavors and refreshing plus I like the bottle and the name...Crazy Horse...Oh yeah!!!!","WVbeergeek","Nov 14, 2002"
3.03,21.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"(40oz bottle)Pours a deep golden color, leans towards a dark golden. Decent frothy white head. Not to much that stands out on the nose, some malty aromas. Fairly smooth on the palate, slightly fruity, slight nuttiness, grainy maltiness, sweet, actually its pretty decent. Decent american malt-liquor brew....","WilliamPhilaPa","Beers"
3.3,32.5,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"40 oz wide-mouth, screw-cap bottle. Contract brewed for Ferolito, Vultaggio & Sons - the people that brought you Arizona Iced Teas. They're more of a marketing company than a beverage producer, so it's interesting that they'd invest in packaging for a beer style that's mainly consumed wrapped in a brown paper bag. However, the beer pours a surprisingly rich golden colored body topped by a full, frothy bright white head that holds OK but eventually drops to just a minor collar and a flat surface. The aroma expresses a lightly fruity (apples) and gently nutty but solid maltiness. The alcohol is only minimally noticeable. A firm body combines with a fine and moderate carbonation for a smooth and mildly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor mimics the aroma: lightly fruity with a clean, sweet, and grainy maltiness. A strong percentage of adjunct is clearly used, allowing the beer to maintain its firm body but not be overwhelmed with true rich malt flavor. Bittering hops are barely present, and there is no noticeable hop flavor or aroma. Very well done, just smooth and clean sweet malt with a well hidden alcohol (although it can build on you after 20 ounces or so). A surprisingly well done malt liquor, but a little sweet on the palate.","NeroFiddled","0"
