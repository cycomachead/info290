"An outlier at 1?? Laughable man"

"I hope that is a born on date or I am tasting an aged version of this beer!"

"Malt liquors can make you wince with the metallic taste and overly rambunctious corn and grain characters. There is a bit of that here but this is not cloying or rancid. It is really smooth. If more malt liquors were like this one I'd be drinking a lot of them. Sorry previous raters and BA members, I have to score it much higher than you did."

"The true budget malt liquor for the budget minded consumer who wants the most bang for his buck but wont settle on Steel Reserve. It is just as a malt liquor should be; cheap, adjunct to hell and with just enough hops to provide a level of bitterness and contrast to the beer that its noticeable but definitely not enough to break the brewers bank. The overall result is a very sweet and enjoyable malt liquor that really finishes clean and has an enjoyable taste but really is nothing special for the price but will definitely quench your thirst and give you the budget buzz you were looking for. Wish I could rate it higher but Country Club XXX and King Cobra had more going on then this malt liquor. Would recommend if you cant afford Old E 800 or if your store doesn't have Genesee at the very least, but not bad for the price and much better then Hurricane or Steel Reserve!"

"Miller Magnum ---2/5."

"O - I'm not going to lie. I drink my fair share of malt liquor after a shitty day at work. I am used to the 8+ percent varieties. This just tastes like an adjunct lager."
"O - Overall, not a terrible malt liquor. It does it's job at the price you'd expect to pay."

"Big thanks goes out to the BA who sent me this one as an extra just because he saw it on my Wants! Even attached a post-it note taped to it that said, “SAW THIS ON YOUR WANTS!! HAHA”. Keeping it classy. Served from 24 oz can into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass (have to try to class it up some). Poured a golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, corn, grain, and sugar. The flavor was of sweet malt, corn, sugar, alcohol, and water. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty bad brew. I have to say that this was a pretty nice looking brew. But I knew not to judge a book by its cover here as this brew likely had a hidden side. Boy was I right on that one…. The aroma was not that great on this one as there was a fairly large sugary aspect going on with it. The flavor was more of the same with more dilution. As a previous review said this was very mild and it being in a can format would make it fun to shotgun at a college frat party (believe me, I was there once). Another tick from the Bottom of the Barrel list with plenty more to go."

"perfect malt liquor for the college/bum set"
"O: This is really just a concentrated, or 'ice', version of High Life. I don't find that surprising as it seems mostly everything Miller sells is just a variation on a theme. It hits really weak for something that is supposedly 6.0%. Never overrate your ABV in this market."

"Taste is disappointing after the decent appearance and delicious malt liquor smell. That old-school malt liquor taste is there, but it's really quite light. It just tastes like high carbonation and stale grains, mostly. Oh well. I'd say it's an average malt liquor: boring, but not offensive like some of the newer, higher alcohol malt liquors. I won't buy it again when Olde English and Schlitz O.M.L. are easily attainable and far superior."

"Decided to pick one of these up since they're practically free right now ay my corner store. I'm not sure why, because it doesn't even LOOK tasty, but we'll see. Brownish yellow liquid with some sudsing on top from the ride home in my bike bag. Smells really, really sweet and of corn and grain. Sugary, fruity flavor with unpleasant, bitter undertones. Feels a bit watery, especially for malt liquor. I guess you get what you pay for."
"Overall Drinkability - Meh. There's only one product named Magnum that one should be proud of buying, and this isn't it."
"Pours a clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is grainy, sweet, with some rice notes. The taste is slightly sweet, grainy/ricy. Light Body. This is a typical macro brew, nothing to talk about."
"Ooh, how pretty! A cap of a finger of rocky, bone-white head with reasonable retention above a deep golden-yellow beer. How could I possibly go wrong? Danger, Woody Robinson, danger! Warning, warning! One sniff and I was pulled out of my afternoon reverie. A bag of Fritos smells less like corn than this gem. Holy awful, Batman! Mouthfeel was medium with a heat on the tongue that full-on got my attention. Oh me, oh my, oh shit, oh dear. My brain felt like it was being cooked in the shell and my eyes were beginning to alternately bug out and roll back. No wonder the down-and-out crowd looks the way that they do, if this is a standard on the menu. Jesus, but I want to ram my head through a wall just to make the voices shut up for a f**king millisecond! I hear them all the time, but never as loudly or as clearly as I do with this winner. A previous reviewer mentioned giving money to the unfortunates who may be drinking this on the street. Hell, this makes me want to tithe. Woody at Lee Ermey the therapist's office: ""Magnum 40 really makes me sad."" L. E.: ""That's very interesting. You know what makes me sad, you squiddly diddly piece of dung?!? This beer! Let's go get a craft beer and tell some sea stories."" Yeah, man, after this, I was ready for a beer. The finish was dry, bone dry and I could feel smoke rolling out of my ear holes as my brain melted into the background. All I need is some crack or crystal meth and the afternoon will be complete."
"Tastes of rubbing alcohol and fusel alcohol as well. Carbonation or hops, can't tell, abrasive bitterness coming from the alcohol. Take a miller high life and age it in some vodka and you get this beer. Damn. I'd be tempted to give a bum some money if I saw him drinking one of these. . ."
"Good for frat parties, a quick buzz, or teenagers who think Natty is good beer."
"Overall it is above average for a Malt Liquor but not great"
"this is a 40 of MALT LIQUOR! it's not that bad. when it's cold you can down half the bottle pretty quick. no weird bitter taste. it's kind of like cheap miller lite. not a lot of carbonation, so you can drink it quicker. just drink half the bottle, put it in the freezer for 20 minutes, then drink the rest."
"RJT"
"Not a lot to see when poured in my mug, very light yellow rating a 4 on the SRM chart. Fluffy pure white head that fizzled down to a light lacing around the edge of my mug. Light sweet smell of malt and corn, nothing special here. Not much flavor at all, can't put my tongue on any real taste except wet corn. Very little in the mouth feel category also, one step above water, quite bland. Because of the lack of taste, I guess it could go with anything, but would not add to the dining experience or enhance any other flavors. It is wet, and will quench your thirst when coming in from heavy yard work, and yes it will give you a buzz, but if you are looking for flavor, look somewhere else. Much better cold, taste a little more like straw as it warms. I guess I could offer it if I had nothing else to keep a party going, but not something I would buy for a flavor experience."
"D: Not very good, even by malt liquor standards."
"you get what you pay for-could be a whole lot worse.."
"Ive had some bad beers in my life, but man, this one is coming close to takign the cake. weak nose, pissy colour, even weaker taste. lacing is lacking to say the least. the only thing that is really redeemable about this is the incredibly cheap price. one dollar? sure, ill take it, if i were a bum. and as one of the bros would point out: freshness date? hell no. this piss dont need no stinkin frehsness date."
"Taste is light sweet malts and a mild shot of alcohol. Body is extremely light for a malt liquor. It is pretty clean, without alot of off-putting fruitiness. I actually prefer my malt liquor to pack a bit more whollop than a mere 6%, the alcohol presence is featherweight in this beer. Easy to drink, but not my ML of choice."
"D- As far as malt liquors go...this is average. As far as beer goes....this is pretty terrible."
"Poured from a clear 40 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and corn. Taste is mostly of alcohol, some notes of malts and corn. Feels light in the mouth and overall this is about average as far as malt liquors go."
"Poured from a 40 ounce bottle into a 0.5 litre Pilsener glass I bought in Munich. Smell was sweet and grainy. Head was so small or unimportant or of so little consequence as to warrant little or no attention. Smell was obtuse with characteristics of grain. Color was sallow. Taste was disagreeabl. Mouthfeel was without merit. Drinkability, you got to be kidding. If you like hiigh ABV and a cheap price ($1.29 plus tax in Louisiana) and you are real thristy, this brew is a bargain."
"D = if you absolutely are broke, if you can't afford one good real beer, then drink this cold, chug it fast, and you should be ok until you can get quality you can enjoy."
"Its not good. But the last two times I've had it it was worse. I don't know why, maybe I'm in a better mood? Moral of this story is if you want to drink a 40, get Mickeys, or Cobra or anything. Don't get this since they all cost the same anyway."
"I don't recommend this one!"
"Very light yellow with a slight white head. Smells of corn flakes and wimpy hops. Tastes like an even sweeter version of most macro lagers with noticeable alcoholic warmth in the finish even though the ABV is mild for the style. Watery mouthfeel,highly carbonated. This brew gets pretty nasty as it warms up. Not worth the time."
"Yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head that actuslly laces the glass.Aroma is pretty much standard for a malt liquor.Taste is watery and sweet but in an unoffensive way.I would actually go to say this might be the best malt liquor I've had.I usually don't drink malt liquors but I saw it at the store and thought I haven't reviewed this one yet,and It actually turned out to be a pleasant surprise."
"Yes, I am reviewing a forty of malt liquor. What about it? First, pour a little out for my lost hommies... then into my glass this beer was a lemon-yellow color like floor cleaner. The head was white, very short lived and left only minimal lacing off the ring. The aroma was musty, skunky malt and general unpleasantry like the underside of your grandfathers couch cushion. The flavor was not quite so bad, in fact it seemed to be designed to be inoffensive. Watery pale malt with hints of hops to balance and some alcohol ester sweetness. Very little there. Ok mouthfeel and a light, chug-able body. Good beer? No. But that is not what it was made for."
"D - Not bad for what it is. If I was headed out to a party and wanted to drink beer on the cheap, this wouldn't be a bad choice."
"pours up a yellow straw color with a white bubbly head. surprisingly nice lacing! the nose is slight metallic corn malt, very subtle crisp hop character. the taste is MacNasty with cheese! subtle crisp hops, sweet malts, medium to light bodied, meduim carbon dioxide carbo, sweet to dry finish. Wooh! I haven't had a 40 in a while! Brings me back to the roots...Gotta love it...."
"Drinkability is for that cheap buzz and cheap bang for your buck. It's not bad, but not worth buying unless you're hard on the dough."
"Another original from Miller brewing company. This is porbably one of their worst creations ever. It was a fizzy yellow liquid with a weak head. Smells like dried corn and alcohol. Taste is similar. Mmm, bitter feed corn. The body was syrupy and resulted in very poor drinkablility."
"an awefull beer, if this is something that one goes out to find to have a good decent drink, this is the wrong area to look. If forties are your sort of drink there is so much more than this beer, just stay away from the beer. If this comes into the scene drink one then you are done, otherwise stay away!"
"Only thing good for is getting drunk for cheap in my opinion"
""
"69% recommended."
"Magnum really isn't that bad, because it really doesn't have that much flavor. Smell and taste are fleeting, and the color is about what you would expect out of a beer called Magnum 40. The mouth feel is pretty good and when ice cold very easy to drink."
"Poured a pale yellow color with a puffy white head that was quickly vanished. Smell is very minimal with only a generic sweetish beer aroma. Taste is also sweet, but very restrained. Finishes refreshing when ice cold, but starts to lose its acceptance as it slowly warms. The 40 ounce bottle is best to share with friends so that it stays cold before being finished. Drinkable."
"Magnum 40 is a prototypical malt liquor. Venomous reptile or firearm reference? Check. Bad ass bottle/can with a predominantly black color scheme? Check. Lightly sweet and high enough in alcohol to get you reelin' with the feelin' in no time at all? Check mate. I kinda like it though. If you're in the mood or if you're tight on cash, you could do much worse than this."
"the drinkability is hard for me, dont even think i will finish whats in mky glass."
"Honestly, I didn't mind this 40 oz. too much, it isn't a good beer, but it could have been a lot worse. Appearance is fairly dark for a malt liquor, not great looking, but usually they appear a little more watery. Smell is adjunct, same as about all other macros. Taste is smooth, with a nice, mildly sweet finish. Never did I taste the alcohol in this one. Overall, this is a fairly drinkable beer, and above average for a macro malt liquor. Not something I'd buy for a craft session, but occaisionally a malt liquor feels right."
"Drinkability/notes: Its hard to be disappointed with this beer, because it is so inexpensive. I paid $1.59 plus tax for a 40-ounce bottle. Even as a poor quality beer, it is a good value for the money and a better value than many of the American macros. If you invest $2.00 in this beer and have reasonable expectations, it is at least decent, although there are far better malt liquors to be had."
"This is a drinkable brew; no skunk and presence of an actual flavor make it superior to an average American Macrobrewed beer."
"I think the only reason that I am even rating this beer slightly high for a malt liquor is due primarily to the fact that it is extremely cheap, and actually isn't too bad. Believe it or not, I as a college student would prefer this over many of the cheaper Anheuiser Busch products."
"Forty ounce bottle. It poured a thin clear yellow with little head. The smell was nothing but skunk. Terrible. The taste was grainy with corn, rice and alcohol. There was no hint of malt. This has no right being called a malt liquer. Horrible. Never buy this crap."
"Update 2/9/04: I got Magnum again (money's tight), and I didn't dislike it as much as I used to. Still tastes like burnt corn and alcohol, but didn't offend me as much as it used to."
"even worth trying."
"Oh god 4 ozs is enough of this monstrosity the other 36 are going down the drain.I think only serious alkies with a severe nasal condition could drink this trash. Miller hang your collective heads in shame."
"Clear yellow hue. Minimal animation. Smallish brilliant white head, bubbly and underdeveloped. Fair retention. The nose is strongly sweet and alcoholic definitely polluted with adjuncts. Not inviting. The palate is surprisingly clean slightly sweet, kind of creamy similar to creamed corn. The alcohol is a lot less noticeable in the taste, a major plus. The finish is short and sweet (pun intended). The complexity is minimal but the simplicity works well with this malt liquor. The carbonation is moderate, medium-light mouthfeel  very easy to drink. A solid beverage for they style, I still doubt Id drink it again. Its very cheap."
"I would certainly recomend this brew to any college students who have FINISHED writing those finals..."
"When I think of ""Magnum"" I normally picture champgne. Not with this swill. Thank goodnees it has a decent ABV because I can not stomach more than a few ounces. It has that ""pee"" color to it and that great industrial taste. It is a good buzz for the money."
"Break Break, Crystal Palace, this is Drop Kick, we have a mass of beer foam headed towards Omaha, NE..."
"Notes: On the bottle is says “Magnum Premium” … premium compared to what? A sub-standard Malt Liquor, lots of rough edges and tough to put down. Needless to say I had a hard time consuming all of it. One of the cheapest 40’s you can get, usually around $1.50 a pop."
