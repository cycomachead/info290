"Not sure how to review. Tastes like a bad cider/soda mix."
"Abysmal.  Do not drink this."
"its ok, typical bud beer"

"Overall I'd say go with any of the other flavors in the product line, unless the idea of a cheap high gravity macro apple cider appeals to you."

"Just like all of the secondary Bud-Light-Lime-Ahh-Rita's this is just another version of a malternative that doesn't really go anywhere. It's decent enough if you want a sweet apple flavored ""cocktail", but it doesn't really impress, and it's certainly not a beer. On the other hand, as I've previously stated regarding all of these ""beers", they have their time and place. To its benefit, apple, just like banana, seems to be a flavor that can be artificially replicated and still seem fairly authentic. It's a touch over the top, but it never seems fake. On the other hand, for this to be a ""MARGARITA WITH A TWIST"" I'd expect a little bit of tequila flavoring added as well and I just don't really get it. I'm sure it's there, but to me this seems more like a cider version of a margarita."

"O: Way too sweet and way too artificial flavored for my enjoyment - all I can think is that this is the liquid version of the almost neon green Jolly Rancher candies. Alcohol is covered by the sweetness."

"Pours a reddish-yellow in color with no head to speak of as well as no lacing seen. Lots of sweet apple aroma for the most part, almost seemed artificial even. Pretty much the same with the taste as it was more like 'apple juice with some Ever Clear' than anything else. Lots of sugar and pretty sweet. Lighter bodied with heavy carbonation. Overall, it was just OK and if I wanted a similar drink, it would be some hard cider than this. A one time try for me."

"Admittedly, I was looking to find the cranberry version when I perused the cooler at my local 7-Eleven, but how could I say ""No"" to this one, especially when Crannie didn't even bother to show up?  Anyway, it pours a clear brass-russet topped by a half-finger of very short-lived dirty white foam.  The nose comprises sugary apple cider, a hint of maple syrup, and a kiss of hard water.  The taste brings in more of the same, and I swear I can get an ethereal smidgen of that eponymous lime.  The body is a light medium, with an active carbonation and a slick, soda-like feel.  Overall, this was a pretty tasty beverage.  I may not frequent these fruity Ritas, but I could see drinking another of these, even if it does rub me the wrong way a bit by feeling an awful lot like a soda."

"Bud Light Lime Apple AHHH Rita brewed by Anheuser Busch with an ABV of 8.0%. This brew pours out a dark amber color with no head. There are smell  white bubbles, but no head. The smell is apple and beer.  That is all you get in the smell of this brew. The taste is sweet but smooth. There is nothing bad about this brew.  This is one of the better Lime Ahh Rita brews on the market. The mouthfeel is nice. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3.75 out of 5. I would get this brew again."

"I love it!  Too bad this finicky site wont let me post an actual photo of the product.  The alcohol content is 8% and you can buy a 25oz can for about $2.50. Simplified, that's like 2 regular sized cans.  It tastes just like apple juice with a punch...but you really don't notice it, so be careful....a couple of these on an empty stomach will get you tipsy, to say the least.  For those of you who like sweet wines, hard ciders, or if you're a girl who likes fruity drink, this is a good option."

"25 ounce cans of diabetes inducing sweetness...this beer will give you a toothache. It's candied malt liquor with apple flavor and caramel color. This version is especially harsh, no add fizzy carbonation explodes if you pour it into a glass and never settles. Smells like medicinal apple maybe a bit of spice if you imagine, this is their fall seasonal. Flavor the first sip induces acid reflux, fusel alcohol finishes all medicinal I can't believe someone would drink the whole can unless they have a death wish. Mouthfeel is harsh gag inducing with each sip so acidic un-natural on all levels, it's probably good for marinating tough meat or making seviche. Overall, the Redd's Wicked Apple Ale I had prior was as smooth as fine champagne compared to this rotgut malt liquor with a mask on, imagine the hangover from this stuff."
"Apple-Ahhh-Rita pours a reddish color with a very small head, lots of bubbles. There is a stale apple aroma. The flavor is sweet, sugary, and has some apple flavors. Weaker body, over carbonated, and sugary. Overall its like apple juice, with too much sugar."
""
"Apple-Ahhh-Rita isn't so much what I expected in terms of flavor, but also nothing too surprising, especially for a line of drinks that has been capable of impressing me quite significantly. The flavor is there, if one can look past the detractors the carbonation and the overbearing sweetness bring, and one can should give many a light buzz or a pretty warm feeling inside, but there are better offerings from the same line and I can't say I'm soul-crushed that the flavor is just a seasonal item. After all, if sales for this beverage play like they did for the Cran-Brrr-Rita, we'll still see this on store shelves in November and December."
