I gave this ghetto/white trash beer a high review for exactly what it is in its own league. Fuckin awesome. Looks like piss kinda smells like it with notes of dank malts grains and crackers. Taste is about the same without as much of that malt liquor funk like steel reserve which in positive is the worse thing in planet earth other than shiner Holliday chear.

Smell is clean mostly, with a note of corn syrup. Unremarkable, really, but nothing offensive either. Taste is pretty darn smooth I must admit. Sweet and with a light vinous fruit taste also. This hides the ABV very well especially for style. I was pleasantly surprised to find no fusel alcohol flavors even as it warmed a bit. Mouthfeel is smooth as well, perhaps needs a little more in the way of carbonation. Finish is dry and clean. Drinkability, for 40 standards, is top notch.","dude","Nov 10, 2008"

This is a very clean (except for the fruitiness) unobtrusive lager. I feel it's a bit too limited for the style! That said, it has a deep gold color with a thick (but not very dense) head and a generic malt & hop aroma. The body is fairly light.
