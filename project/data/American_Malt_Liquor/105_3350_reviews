"God this brings back great memories of my youth"
"This has a small of straight booze. Its nothing special, but it can quickly get you hammered."
""
"Insert 90's gangster rap lyrics here"
""
"Not crafty, tasty, or special. But $4 of OE can get me tipsy! :)"
"A great beer to drink whenever you feel like having a good time. Probably my favorite beer."
"Olde English is sort of the classic malt liquor. It has numerous movie, rap, music and other cultural references, and it isn't hard to see why. if you drink the stuff, it certainly is memorable. I don't know if there is methyl alcohol in here but the buzz is kind of intense and the people who say that they drink four or five of these a night are probably lying, and either way are people to steer clear of. It's alcohol in a pinch, just like aI said with the better Steel reserve. Treat with caution."
"don't let this one get even close to room temp...Edward 40 hands it"
"Started out drinking this prior to being of age, drank a decent amount of it actually. I once dropped a full forty on my garage floor and the smell was lethal. Haven't touched the stuff since."
"By far...my favorite malt liquor!!!!"
"No reason to drink this beer - now nor then."
""
"O the good ol days of drinking these on the train. still awful"
"This was never a first choice when we were scoring beer from an adult. The one time we did get this, was due to the wino who pimped for us. It was nasty, but it got the job done."
""
"Nasty bottom of the barrel higher alcohol content beer. Very harsh after taste and very malty taste. Had this in my very early (under aged drinking) days, and haven't had it since.  This is truly not worth any amount of $."
"Another classic American Malt Liquor. Corn and malt sweetness, slight bitterness in the finish. Nothing fancy, just an easy drinker."
"Pours piss yellow and quite sweet. One bottle of this stuff is enough to mess you up."
""
"The original Ghetto Juice! The ONLY (beer)? That I've ever poured down the sink after two tastes. Repulsive."
"Gets you fucked up and doesnt taste too bad"
"Some people like it but I think it is God awful. Who knows what is all in it and it tastes like play-doh. Count me out. There's a lot of other better cheap crap out there."

"*I'm looking at this beer as a malt liquor and a American style lager only. If I'm looking at in that category, it's a good beer. Like I said in the mouthfeel, Private Stock and this are the best malt liquors I've ever had. Private Stock was my all time favorite malt liquor. But there is nothing wrong with this beer as a malt liquor. And at the price this beer is at, it's a winner. Don't knock Olde English 800 till you've tried it for yourself."

"The aire of mystery that surrounds the 40 is palpable (or maybe its just the weird after taste). The sarcastic quotation marks that surround the ""800"" taunt the drinker. A true connoisseur will know that this is indeed what olde england would have enjoyed. Olde English ""800"" pairs well with traditional Bangers n' Mash, or even a mouthful of dirt with a side of monty python if real english fare is unavailable. This malt liquor is as dry as British humor, and as inviting as an Oxford boarding school. I will definitely be enjoying the 40 maybe eventually sometime in the future. Enjoy."

"American style Malt Liquor...not bad for a malt liquor. I bought a 4 pack of tall boys for $3.35 and after the first couple of drinks it goes down OK. Malt Liquor is not for everybody but I like it....yes it has a strong metallic....bitter taste but in some old school way that is why I like it....call me crazy...I like my OE 800 ice cold and have even used it to mix with Stout..."
""
"I'm seeing so much hate about this brew. This stuff is delicious and cheap, perfect for a man on a budget. I prefer this to budweiser or any other American beer anyday. The bottle and label also looks bad ass which is major points for. I could go for 3 40's right now."

"I've seen this beer in more homeless peoples hand than any other on the ground at parks too so when i first tried it i felt i was joining some unspoken covenant of dirt poor alcoholics and it wasn't half bad a little stronger than colt 45 but 7.5 alc makes sure you feel it and feel it quick a little heavy on the stomach but tolerable classic malt smell little bit too much carbonation kind of leaves you with a thizz face if you chug it but its cheap and gets the job done"
"O: first time I had this I was 16 - swilled it from the bottle like a baby, eyes all waterin'... a friend and I went with this chick he was trying to make out with over to her ex-boyfriend's house to get weed... stayed till 'round 5am, got all dizzied up, I left just as my friend and the chick started goin at it... apparently, the ex woke up and found them together on the couch - fussin' and a cussin' ensued... seemed like it took me hours to finish guzzling that shit - I can vaguely recall closing my eyes and powering the last few ounces down, face glowing red - remember it being more cloying... I guess I'm a fancy beer nerd now and, I must say, this truly ain't half bad for what it is - gotta admit, I was quaffin' away at it!"

"Olde English 800 brewed by Miller Brewing Co. This brew is a malt liquor and it pours out a nice golden color with a nice light white head. Olde English 800 has an ABV of 5.9%. This brew has the look and smell of most malt liquors. The smell is sweet, with grains and malts. Nothing special but nothing bad. This brew has a lot carbonation. The taste is smooth and crisp for being a malt liquor. You get a hint of sweetness, but it is not over powering. This brew goes down nice. Mouth feel is nice too, nothing bad about this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3.5 out of 5. I will pick this brew up again."

"I know people enjoy their craft selection but com on we drink this stuff to feel good. Argue all you want about why you drink beer but honestly we all drink it for the same reason to varying degrees. For the price the quality of this beer is fairly decent."

" No wonder when most of my guys back in the days were drinking this, or St. Ides, I stuck to my bottles of Riunite Lambrusco."
""
""
""
""
"O = Poured the rest of this one out for my homies. At less than $2 it's not like I was losing anything worth having. Unless you're looking for the cheapest, nastiest way to get buzzed possible, stay away from this one. I admit this was bought as more of a gag and I had no intentions of finishing it. Needless to say, my low expectations were met... thoroughly."
""
""
""
"I'd say this is by far the easiest malt liquor I've drank. Smooth, good taste, and cheap. Not at all like 211 and for some reason I was never keen on trying this particular malt until my friends got me to try it. Glad I did. Definitely plan on getting it more often."
"This beer is definitely not an ""awful"". It is very drinkable...not too bad. After seeing the gutter ball ratings this beer had, I went down to the 7-eleven, tonite, and bought a bottle of Olde English for 3 and a half bucks. Cracked that shit and drank a good, not great, but an all around decent beer. You can't drink this beer and expect the Ferrari experience....know that you are not driving a Ferrari, but a station wagon...expect that and you will probably enjoy this beer. Nice yellow color with a pleasing flavor and taste, nothing distracting here."

"For an interesting twist, try it warmed sometime, and I do not mean room temp. An acquaintance offered a sample of his preferred style of consumption which was to leave the bottle sitting out in the warm summer sun for a couple of hours. I have to say that it does mellow the flavor making it strangely palatable."

"I give this a 5 across the board because it is what it is ""MALT LIQUOR"" and it meets all the expectations of just that, it is easy to drink and is very inexpensive if anyone is coming onto this website to and rating a 2 or 3 then there is something wrong with them and that person should ask them self, was I dissapointed because the malt liquour was not a 5 and did not meet my expectations, or was I dissapointed because I drank malt liqour? To be honest it is just as good as any IPA that I have consumed because like all beer it is an aquired taste and to much of anything could make you sick, simply put take a high end beer that is highly hopped and take a malt liqour and give it to someone who has never tried any beer before and they would think that both are disquisting!! This is a bang for the buck and works well wheter your on a tight budget or you have a lot of money and besides it is up to you, the drinker to decide what your taste buds like not some amateurs on a website who have no idea what they are talking about."

"There is not much going on here, I used to be able to get a couple of these for around $ 5.00 when I was in high school. I have not had one since but they used to be a cost effective way to get a nice buzz when taste comes a distance second to price. Nice memories but I doubt I would be a fan now."

"o: this is probably my favorite true malt liquour on the market (no, Rogue's old ""daddy's little helper"" or Dogfish Head's ""Liquor de Malt"" do not count as a true malt liquour. sorry.). I'll take this over Colt 40, St. Ides, Mickey's or Cobra any day but Private Stock still might be my favorite. i was shocked to see this has an ABV of 7.5%. i did a bit of research and apparently the west coast gets a stronger version than we do back east. weird."

"If I were to sum myself up in one word, it's swank. I'm a guy who only cares for the fine things in life. If you're like me, then Olde English is the beer for you. The aroma of oak is evident once you open it (probably what is was aged in). The taste is smooth and sweet, similar to many other high-end European beers. I became violently ill shortly after finishing this (probably unrelated)."

"I drank the beer cold in a mug and it was suprising Very crisp, the carbonation gives it a very smooth body. High marks for good carbonation, crisp mouthfeel, and not much -lingering taste. I . I drank my 24 oz in half an hour. This beer gets the job done!"

"This malt liquor is piss. Only drank it because it was free. The beer itself is pretty flat. It tastes like a 40 oz. Looks like a 40 oz. Would rather drink a nice trippel or something. It is just not my style of preference. Damn you miller for making suck beverages."
"Miller Brewing Olde English 800---1.5/5"
""
"O: Not the worst in the style, but far from my favorite. One of the primary places where it fails is its lack of the sugary sweetness that helps mask the utilitarian nature of the style."
""
""
""
""
"O: So this wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I've had some beers I couldn't finish, but this one wasn't horrible tasting and I could drink it. It just didn't have much taste to speak of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not ""terrible", but it is certainly not good. It is rather weak for the style. It's pretty drinkable, considering. It's a sweet-ish, rather bland, cheap Malt Liquor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid, well rounded, economical and tasty treat for a Friday night with nothing better to do than to throw on some Motorhead and talk shit with your friends."

"Compared to other beer, this is rather bad. But as a 40 with a purpose, this is wonderful. I don't like getting drunk, but when I have to (e.g., frat party), I just down one or two of these to give me the buzz I need. It's cheap, and it's effective, and isn't that really the point of a 40? With that in mind, this beer is the one to go for if you need to be drunk but don't like binge drinking, hard liquor, or wasting your craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is what it is. Thankfully it is cheap. I've had way worse cost to satisfaction ratios with other beers. Still, it's doubtful I'll be physically able to finish the 24 oz can."

"I have my doppelganger to thanks for this one as he spent a whole $1.29 + tax to pick this one up for me at a local Marathon on the way to a birthday party! Thanks??? Served from 40 oz bottle into a shaker for the first glass then consumed straight from the bottle for the rest. Unfortunately there wasn’t as brown paper bag as the gas station didn’t have any to give us. Poured golden yellow with a one and a half off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, corn, sugar, alcohol, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, corn, grain, wheat, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty bad brew. I always joked with my friends about drinking this one at parties to see the look on people’s faces. Well, apparently my best friend remembered this and made it happen. Just so you know this thing is bad. I really wish it would have been higher in ABV so I would at least be so wasted after that I had forgotten that I had drank it. So after all this I’m wondering around the party with no buzz and looking for something else to drink. Luckily there was another 40 oz laying around, so I went with that obviously. But about the beer, not a lot but grain and corn going on here with a hint of sugar. Great for party gifts and hobos under the overpass, but if you have any class at all you will avoid this at all costs."

"Golden yellow in color, suprisingly thick head with little retention. Scent is pale and meek, some light malt, light sweet corn and metallic notes. Taste again is somewhat clean for style, light sweet malts, sweet corn. Light, fizzy, some lingering warmth. It is what it is, and thats not very good."
""
"For the style it isn't awful. I've had worse. The style usually isn't for taste. With that being said this is pretty drinkable. It wouldn't be hard to make this disappear and get a cheap buzz."

"Nothing special but alot better than a Budweiser and a hell of alot less expensive. Don't know what it would be like to throw down on alot, but good 40 beer."

"Overall - The 40 of 40's. A 40 drinker's 40. It's one of those things where you dedicate the afternoon to it, while you do yardwork."
"Why is this malt liquor so much more ingrained in pop culture than all the other malt liquors? I tried this brew with the intention of seeking out the answer to this riddle but all I am left with is more questions. I have decided that I am content to never know the answer to these questions. Looking into the abyss only once is enough for me."

"Of course this is not a craft. It is what it is, brewed to quench your thirst, accompany dogs and beans, and drown your sorrows. This one is a bit better than the average malt liquor."
""
"It is what it is; compared to the beers of the world it's definitely along the bottom rung, hence the low grade. But, it's still drinkable if you're a bro and having an OE is, sometimes, better than not having an OE."

"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, lingering on the tongue. This isn't good, but considering how awful some other malt liquors are, I didn't completely hate drinking it."
"(No stereotyping intended by these comments!)"
"D: Get drunk beer only. Not a drink I will be returning too on purpose"
"Overall, if you want a 40oz of malt liquor, get a mickey's. The only reason I can see someone drinking this stuff is if they've acquired a taste for it. There's really no reason that explain why I like it, but its a bit more tolerable with orange juice."
"O/D: Nothing more than a ""gets the job done"" beer, and even that, not worth it. A pretty poor malt liquor, as redundant as it sounds."
"D - lack of flavor lack of ""good"" smells mediocre looks and poor texture. It is very affordable. So I'll boost it up to an overall 2"
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s not as much of a buzz-accelerator as most people look for in a Malt Liquor but for the style it’s a decent beer to pound for a while."
"Overall - It don't get any more gangsta than this. This was THE drink for me when I was young and broke."
"Pours the color that your pee is when you're dehydrated, or when you've not been drinking Old E enough. Fizzy, with a quickly-receding white frothy head. Smells of sweet corn and old grains. Taste of tinkle, corn, stale grain, and alcohol. Very light-bodied, harsh, and pretty much as undrinkable as rocket fuel. Goes good with pig knuckles, collard greens, and maybe garnished with a slice of watermelon. Yo."
"After trying a few of the locally available hobo flasks, and trying to find something salvageable in each, I'm at a loss here. Sure, I looks all right, but the slope is pretty steep after that. As the last of my first (and last) glass slowly drains, my taste buds feel, well, dead. The mustiness and unrestrained lack of brewing character leave me morose. Given the cost of any beer around here, the fact that this (thankfully) set me back only about 4 bucks, still seems like hollow consolation at the moment."
"A lark we had it, only a lark would make it return."
"O - Not really worth drinking. May be worth boiling brats--we'll see . . ."
"O - It brings the urban experience to my country home."
"For my first 40, I'm very impressed. This is the stuff of legend, and has a long heritage of rappers who have consumed it. I can now proudly count myself among their ranks."
"Overall: Not something I'll ever subject myself to again. There are way better means of getting trashed than this, and though it's cheap, it's not at all worth the gagging and self loathing."
"One downside to this beer is like all malt liquors it starts to feel a little nasty and overly sweet towards the end, even if kept well chilled throughout the experience. However, compared to other malt liquors, I'd say this one exhibits that problem the least. And if you have a little food to eat with it towards the end, that problems disappears entirely. Bottoms up!"
"Shadez Of Brooklyn - Change"
"Alright. I'll admit it - this isn't what I would consider a bad malt liquor. Just don't let it warm up."
"overall- What can you really say about this beer? Its pretty gross. If you want to get drunk for cheap then buy a olde English 800 thats all its good for."
"D- There is none, if you can make it through a glass of this, then youre a better man than me."
"Almost a four finger head with good clinging lace. Color is a 6 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is bad, much like rotten corn and wet oats. Taste is harsh, cooked corn and malt. Mouthfeel is bad, not much body and a very dry feeling on my upper palate. I am sure the beer was made for one thing. A cheap drunk. I guess after the first 24 oz you could drink another with no problem because your taste buds would be numb."
"D- Very drinkable on a hot summer day at the Indy 500, in a canoe, on a pontoon, with your neighbor's 40 year old wife, ....you could play Edward 40-hands with this one."
"Beer is cold....cold is a flavor right? Yeah, yeah it is. Beer is cold, grainy aftertaste, late acid astringency forward mild pilsner flavor. Beer is medium in body and I've definitely had worse, much much worse. I think it's the charcoal filtering that makes this beer superior to its peers. Beer is back heavy with little going on in the front but I should be able to finish this bottle."
"D - Smooth and tasty and tolerable as long as it's cold! It's engineered for a quick, cheap buzz...not to win medals! But in the ""catch a good buzz on a budget"" category....it deserves a Gold Medal!!!"
"For a malt liqour, this is rather good, still I hated it but praise is deserved, considering the style."
"I was hesitant to try this brew because of the simple fact that it was a malt liquor. I had heard from people that malt liquor is disgusting and should never be consumed by anybody anywhere. But I decided that letting other people tell me what to drink was foolish. so I went to the store, picked up a 40 of OE, and tried it. it looked golden and basically like other domestic beers I have had. The smell was what made me start to think twice about it. it smelled almost exactly like a skunks ass. I slowly put the bottle to my lips and tipped it back a little. Not bad, I thought, so I took a big swill and swished it around in my mouth a little. It was the best cheap brew I had ever had. I quickly finished it in about 25 minutes and had a good strong buzz from it. The only thing I think Miller could improve about OE is the smell. other than that its a great cheap brew."
"Another malt liquor for my out of the mystery beer machine. This one was slightly better than the Steel Reserve but not much. I actually wasn't even aware that this was made in 12oz cans. I thought it was only available in 40s. Not a bad beer, but I don't think I could drink too many of them in one sitting. Good if you want to get messed up, but not if you want to enjoy a beer."
"Not having a reference point for the style per se, I think this beer drinks fairly well and doesn't seem to deserve its bad rap. Certainly more enjoyable than an Adjunct Lager. My can was firmly carbonated and offered a notably better than anticipated experience."
"This beer has a disturbing copper color. The aroma is like rubbing alcohol/cleaning products. The beer is overcarbonated and pours horribly. This beer is strong malt liquor. It is very popular in ghetto areas, mostly being sold in the ghetto. This is a perfect example of beer coming in 40 oz. bottles being no good. Stay away from this."
"I got a little better than a finger of fizzy bone-white head that seemed to be falling as fast as I could pour, ending with a bunch of wisps. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. In fact, this kind of thing is the gold standard for clarity. Nose was candy sweet, like bubble gum and even some fusel alcohol. Ugh. A 22 may be more than enough for this old man. Mouthfeel was medium with a sugary sweetness in the mouth. I imagine that if you took a bag of sugar and stirred it into a liquid medium until it became saturated, this would be what it would taste like. The finish was fairly dry with a burning sensation going down. Man, this is evil. I was intimidated by such things as a kid, but now I am just disgusted."
"gross."
"Drinkability: This beer isn't drinkable. Its unpleasant and leaves a terrible aftertaste. Avoid this beer."
"High carbonation, harsh to drink, just complete and total swill. Don't waste your time. Stay away from this one."
"D- It is not smooth at all, you gotta force this stuff down."
"D - At 7 1/2 percent abv, it's quite a surprise it didn't come off tasting like booze. If you're looking for a cheap drunk (like a homeless man) then this'll get you there no problem...and you won't have to have a chaser with it."
"This is terrible but as a malt liquor it has certain advantages in that it is expected to taste like roadkill scrotum. Hey, if you want to get banged up once in a while (and who doesn't?),well, this stuff is a really cheap way to do it."
"Pours a sickly thin light straw color with a thin white head, no lacing. Smells of wet hay, rotten corn stalks, booze, and general nastiness. Tastes like corn, sweetness, and nasty booze. Mouthfeel is very thin, too thin. And drinkability is poor."
"The sixth entry in Swill Tour 2010. I'm really not sure why the 800 is in quotes, nor do I know to what it refers. Possibly the 800 lives it has already claimed (pour some to the curb...or, as we believe, down the drain in remembrance). It pours a clear pale straw (deeper than the AALs we've had so far) topped by an ample coif of white foam. The nose is corny, but less so than light AALs. Not much else there, honestly. I wish I could say more. The taste is liquefied Corn Flakes mixed with the tears of the masses. Mike referred to it as sorrow and corn. What calamity hath befallen this corn. The body is a sorta heavy light, with a light moderate carbonation and a badly crisp feel. This is indeed booty sweat, Mike."
"Pours a pale golden color. The smell is of nothingness, which in regards to this swill tour I've learned to be a kind thing. The taste is of sorrow. Well...sorrow and corn. This is hard to drink. And because it comes in a 40 I'm so happy I'm splitting it. The mouthfeel is of the despair to go with the sorrow. It is only to be consumed in the ghetto where everything is run-down...like this beverage."
"D-Normally the saving grace of the malt liquor, however this one is not a good drink. yes it can be chugged, but to sip on it is painful, and ability to put it down quickly isn't all there is to drinkability. Overall a pretty lousy example of the style, could be worse though. could be hurricane."
"Other than OE HG 800, this is easily the harshest malt liquor I've ever had. I'd rather have a 12%, 99 cent tallboy of Earthquake."
"D: for the price and lack a powerful flavors its drinkable yet its also drain-pour-able."
"Meh. There are certainly worse out there, but there are also better. This was tied for a unanimous second during our tasting."
"Cheers!"
"At 2 bucks for a 40, can't really expect more than you get. For the style, this is textbook definition baseline. Yes, there is better, but there's also definitely worse..."
"Drinkability-- Large quantity? Desired. Frequency? Not so much."
"So in the end, OE8 it does serve a purpose in the universe, albeit not a craft-beer oriented type purpose. But for $1.89 a 40oz, how much complaining can you really do when you're almost broke, and payday is still three days away? Plus it makes a fine lunch when you're working hard at hardly working. Excellent for road crews."
"D: Not as bad as some of the other malt liquors out there, but I wouldn't want to take the fawty to the face."
"Feel is very light, decent carbonation makes it pleasant to drink. Alcohol content is hidden very well, barely noticable. No burn associated with this at all, but at seven point five, it is not too heavy in the alcohol department. Drinkability is good, in my opinion. Guzzled from the forty would seem to be the way to go with this brew. Serve ice cold and have a good time chugging that massive forty ouncer."
"Drank straight from the 40 ounce bottle. Appearance was golden yellow. Strong scents of corn, rice, sort of a sweet smell. Lots of flavor corn, malt extracts, no real hop flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth, very easy to drink. Would I reach for another one? Yes."
"D: For what it is, it's okay. Rough and grainy for sure, but thankfully not a hot, sugary mess. Not very good, but for the style you can do a lot worse. Some nights call for something like Olde English, and tonight definitely qualified."
"The taste is crisp, but heavy on adjunct flavors and a horrid metallic taste. The body is thin and grainy and the drinkability is poor."
"Drinkability- Drinkable in the sense that you can drink a ton of this without becoming too full. but its not something you reall want to drink."
"Also PBR is a bit better. Thanks."
"RJT"
"But holy crap watch for the headache the next day."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Taste is just alcohol and yellow beer. Mouthfeel, something, rice or corn wallows around. Kinda drinkable once you get a little tipsy and play some Too $hort."
"Olde English 800 is a very clear and very lively bright yellow beer with a big, fluffy, white head that has really good retention and leaves clumps of lacing on the glass. It has an aroma of DMS and fusel. Yup, it smells like a homeless dude. It's medium bodied, pretty smooth and pretty crisp. It leaves the the tongue a little numb. There isn't a really strong flavor here but it's just kind of like... corn and vegetables with a little rumble of booze at the end. Man, after 40 oz. of this, I don't know if I'll be going outside naked in subzero weather or fighting a cop or both. I guess we'll find out in the morning.."
"Lots of carbonation with a crisp feel. As long as it never gets above freezing temperature, the drinkability on this is okay. Once you start noticing any kind of taste, well you took too long."
"As anyone else who enjoys malt liquors will tell you, this beer is not the kind meant for savoring. It is designed solely for getting hammered, however I do believe there are some redeeming characteristics for this ""king of malt liquors"" as Miller likes to claim. An easy drinking malt liquor with a palatable taste. I will say, however that the only positive about the aroma is that it is easily recognizable that it will get you messed up something quick. I did follow some suggestions of regular ""malt advocates"" and the consensus is they all look like piss so forget about it, the can however is a piece of nostalgic beauty, so it gets and average on this handle. I honestly believe that even though the taste is not pleasant, it is definately drinkable and therefore deserves a decent rating in both taste and mouthfeel. God forgive me for drinking this sh** and liking it. Long live IPA!"
"Cool close to freezing, work out in 75F+ and this becomes my go to beer! KIW ITA RH. 8===D ~o (j) all dat errday. Listen, this shiz cost around sixty seven cents per can an seven point five alcohol by volume. I'm on my third tonight and two hundred and fifty words is way to many."
"wow. I've never had a beer that tastes like the way a wet-cat smells. this shit is pretty rank. the color is like the worst bmc piss has to offer. the smell is, like I said, as a wet-animal. the taste, well, anything could pretty much taste better. the feel is ridiculous bad: super thin and the d-bility is needless to say, horrible."
"Drinkability: No, this is not the best tasting beer around. Still, it does manage to taste better than some American macro brews and, if you wanna get drunk, there's nothing better."
"Drinkability: Pretty atrocious tasting but let's be honest here: Do you really drink Olde English for its hop and malt profile? Nah. You drink it to get drunk cheaply and it succeeds marvelously at that. For that alone, this beer is a winner in my book."
"Just an awful, awful beer. When I have children, and see them try and drink this like I did when I was their age, I won't say a word. They'll learn like I did---this is just bad, bad, stuff."
"this is another cheap beer from my past.i think it the best of the cheap beers out there.the taste isnt as bad and the appearance of the beer is pretty good.keep in mind i keep saying cheap beer because thats what it is and im rating it against other cheap beer"
"D - Not unsmooth and quite tolerable if served ice cold, but this isn't the beer that you go to for sipping. It's not meant to be consumed for pleasure, but it's honestly better than some of the horrifying light beers out there and gets you buzzed quicker which is probably what you'd be going for if you're in the market for light beer or malt liquor."
"D- High. I can down these like water. Tasty enough, though there are tastier malt liquors, this one had nothing major working against it. A solid package that doesn't dissapoint. I like it."
"I don't know how some people can stomach this stuff, different strokes for different folks I guess."
"D - The best thing I can say about this beer is that it hides its alcohol well. It is one of the smoother malt liquors and has a fairly clean malt profile with noticeable, but fairly inoffensive, corn notes. It is an efficient alcohol delivery system and if I had to drink a malt liquor, this would probably be my first choice."
"Overall this is about the best malt liquor I've had. I wouldn't give this a great rating compared against a German or Czech Pilsner. It is what it is, and has its place."
"Poured from the bottle into my mouth. Smells a little ""hot"" and fuselly. Tastes the same. Theres a big corny aftertastes that kind of coats your tongue and sits there for a while. I wish it was a little more carbonated. Went ok with the chili dogs I was eating but frankly any other forty (besides perhaps Magnum or Evil Eye) would have gotten the job done and been less gross about it."
"MF/D: Better carbonation than some others, light body for the style, lingering metallic sweetness."
"Taste is pretty full-bodied and malty sweet. Hops are basically undetectable and carbonation level is fairly high. Hides the ABV well when cold...once it warms up though, all bets are off with this beer. It doesnt taste like a whole lot, but it is not unpleasant. Gimmie a foty of this and I'll play some bones."
"[I poured it out in favor of opening something else GOOD to rate.]"
"Don't take my review the wrong way, ""Old Gold"" is a traditional part of my beer drinking life. I have consumed more of these 40's than probably any other beer on the planet. For a price tag under 2.50 this is a no brainer. Party at my house, bring some OE"
"Out of a mutha-F-ing forty this beer was a gold color with good clarity. My aggressive pour created a three-finger white head that displayed pretty good retention that eventually became a thin collar that left good lacing. The aroma was of macro-grains, something like wet cardboard, a little musty malt and pale malt. The flavors were actually pretty good for a malt liquor. Macro grains, some sweet malt, a little pale malt and some stale notes too. Touches of bitterness did appear at the end but it was not really hoppy, crisp or defined. The mouthfeel was a little oily and rough, the body was medium and the carbonation prickly. Yes, it was a malt liquor so it could only be so good, but straight up, I was down with it."
"D: Nah, I remember the days that I drank this every weekend. Boy have I come a long way."
"I could see myself drinking this in large quantities if there was nothing else available. It isn't awful, but overall not impressive. I would not seek it out, but I would accept it if offered."
"Poured from a clear bottle into a weizen glass. Has a rich golden color with about 1/2 inch head. Weak malt smell. The taste is malty and not all that great. Feels somewhat bitter in the mouth. Drinkability is o.k. I guess. This is a beer I drank a lot of in my youth but don't care for so much now."
"This is not a very good malt liquor at all. Don't be fooled by the decent head and color, the taste and aroma are not good. The mouthfeel is almost wine like. Very strong adjunct flavor. I'm not a big fan of malt in the first place, but OE should certainly be stuffed in a brown paper bag when being consumed to not embarrass one self. Not recommended unless you are trying to end the night quick."
"Thanks to Chris for hooking me up with this golden pint sized can of ""800"". Pale yellow with a huge foamy white head that leaves some lace after deflating. Smell is pure steely grits and not much else. Tastes sweet and corny with a slight, bitter metallic edge. Medium bodied and highly carbonated. Fairly inoffensive and pretty average Malt Liquor. Not bad, but it does get pretty funky when it warms up a bit."
"Edit 4/29/2014. I wanted to make clear we get a 7.5% OE 800 in Oregon. It is not labeled ""HG"" either. From a 24 ounce can."
"D - I don't like this at all. I never will drink this again."
"Well, I knew what I was getting into with this. I felt like trying a 40, just to see what it was like. Of course, I wasn't surprised. At first, it's almost like a standard macro, maybe even a European lager like Heineken or Becks. Unfortunately, it funks up at the end, leaving an awful aftertaste. Cheap, crappy beer best served only for the most dire of circumstances. If you're this broke, I suggest saving up for some High Life. Yes, it's that bad."
"looks and tastes pretty bad. clear yellow, not much flavor... tastes like an old skunked or spoiled beer. but the smell is real bad...almost musty, like an old locked up attic. at least it's pretty light and VERY cheap and is usually worth a good laugh or two. Good for fun, not for beer"
"D: Hey if its free and the only thing im lookin for is to get drunk then ok mabey i will have a some but if for some reason im buting malt liquor i have to go with mickey's and that ain't that great it self"
"I would only recommend this stuff if (a) your wife left you or (b) you lost your job and either way just need something to kill the pain and not cost a lot."
" A great accompanyment to some XBOX playing if you're just looking to drink. It's not craft beer, but it is a lot of beer."
"The taste wasn't as bad as I expected. I've certainly have had worse. But this is just not my kind of beer."
"Moderate carbonation...Basically liquid hell in a 40oz bottle. About a third got drain poured."
"Not to good of a beer, and surely not something I would get again, but overall a malt liquor that I was able to finish. But finish it before it warms at all."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a thick white head. Very clear. Develops a decent collar and a slight laciness. Aroma is very simple, barley and malt. Taste follows the same concept although it has a very metallic taste that is offensive. Thin and watery texture. Drinkability is not hight on my list. Although it is not a terrible beer it is not one I would seek out for drinking around the house on a warm day. Not recommended as a session beer."
"look. admittedly, this is cheap beer. but it serves a purpose, and i feel it does its job very well. this is the best 40 money can buy. sure, it's not a triple-fermented ale made by belgian monks who have taken an oath of silence, but that doesn't mean its not enjoyable. this is all some people can afford. and if old e is all they can afford, don't you think they should be able to drink in peace without beer snobs looking down their noses at them? i love a good belgian tripel, but beer is beer."
"Two things I would give OE: you can probably pound them without too much trouble, and it would certainly get you drunk. I've tried and reviewed a couple of malt liquors and been surprised that they aren't that bad. OE is not one of those, it is just as bad as I remember the last time I tasted it. Even when reaching for a malt liquor, try to avoid this one I'd say."
"a milt liquor for 350 (recently upped from 1.99, which was always on the bottle... now no price is listed, wonder what happened?) for a 40 oz, gets you drunk. The only point to it."
"Has a hazy light brownish copper yellow color, its a malt. Smells like garbage, like wet cardboard, stale etc all the pleasantries of a malt liquor. Tastes like it smells, with all kinds of off flavors, and a notable alcoholic aftertaste. Mouthfeel, is full and thick, and oily. Honestly, if this isn't ice cold its really hard to drink, but if its ICE cold you can get one of these down pretty effortlessly. So i gave it a 3. But honestly are you gonna drink this one for taste? I never did, even back in the old days, i knew this was bad. Have fun!"
"Huh. I used to drink these things so easily in college. It tastes like a bad beer that has been sitting out all night and someone emptied a dropper full of vodka in it. It's sweeter than most malt liquors and the alcohol is better hidden than average. Of course, average is very poor among the popular malt liquors. It makes my mouth feel kind of funny, like my cheeks are attempting to retreat back into my throat. I'm not going to keep panning it. Suffice to say, there's no reason to drink it, even for free."
"It's very cheap, very drinkable, and hell, let me say what where all thinking. It gets the job done, I recommend it if your low on cash & badly need something strong but not offensive. This is good decent Malt Liquor. Cheers!"
"D - Not a bad drinking 40 but a little too much sweetness and alcohol for me."
"Out of the Fo-tee ounce. Pours dark yellow, not unlike urine, with a foamy white head. Aroma is of the streets, ethyl, corn, chemical sweetener, and dank funk. Taste is brutal. Bitter sweet, but in a bad way. In a really sweaty, corny gym sock way. It is impossible to quantify the malt-liquor brutality of this beverage unless you actually try it."
"M + D: Like seltzer water.. nothing much going on. Quite boring, and I don't know if I could manage an entire 40, but I CAN make it through a glass."
"D= Decent... After a 40 oz i never wanted to touch it again. Too much in one sitting. Got warm and weird"
"Yellow color with an oily texture that tends to stick in one's mouth. As far as 40s go it beats most I have tried though. That doesn't say much. If you're really itching for a drink and can find some change in the couch, you could do worse. Like Colt 45. I didn't mind rating this beer with a little bit of a curve on the drinkability factor because most educated people know of it's true purpose. ""Drunk for cheap"" It has no other reason to exist. Seriously, look it up on ebay and see what kind of items show up, especially the old ads for it. Ghetto-fabulous."
"Easy to drink malt beer. Tastes, smells, and looks like corn. I personally enjoy malt liquor but to the normal beer fan this beer will probably be too sweet. I gave it a 3 on the drinkability scale because it can be found everywhere. Also kind of funky aftertaste like spoilt beer. I would stick with better malt liquors but this one isn't too bad."
"Overall, it's drinkable, kind of enjoyable, and inoffensive, but totally one-dimensional, and tasting of sweet cornbread. It lacks the balance, character, and mild complexity of something like Schlitz High Gravity ""Very Smooth Lager," yet to me this seems pretty much the quintessential malt liquor."
"Surprisingly medium in body and nicely carbonated. Good drinkability for style."
"Yellow color, fizzy white head, no lacing. Terrible stuff. Same as Colt 45... they both have a permanent spot near the bottom of my list. Lots of corn, some malt and some old caramel. But hey, if you're young, need to get drunk and don't have any money then go for it. Just don't say I didn't warn you the next morning."
"The body is as thin as one can get and I find it really hard to continue with the session, even without taking the abv in the equation. I'm just glad I'm drinking this *cold*. Not worth a retry....ever!!"
"Dark gold with no head. Adjunct to adjunct, dust to dust. Like corn and water and a bit of ethanol. Really no off nodes but nothing nice about it, either. Tastes like it smells. Even at the end of the bottle, when it's getting dangerously warm, it's still drinkable."
"Overall, Thank God this isn't my go-to beer. Its got flavor, its got ""some"" body, and its got alcohol. Other than that, it has nothing going for it. Good brew for the style, but not my style, if you know what I mean. Even if I'm chillin' on the corner with my boys, we're going to grab a 4-0 of Dogfish Head's Liquor De Malt any day over this."
"Notes: This brew if I remember correctly was targeted at a young,urban/inner-city demographic. Excessive advertising in poor urban areas. Despite drinking this I never really liked it. Now the idea of malt liquor offends me and reminds me why I detest certain companies. This is not beer,it is a tool of destruction."
"Drinkability: A cheap, get-you-drunk beer for when your life has hit rock bottom, one that makes you think ""has my life really come to *this*?"" Best served wrapped in a brown paper bag."
"Pours a very light yellow color that is close to water - not much head not much lacing and below average carbonation. The dominate smell is mild malt with some hops coming through. First taste is light, sweet, and lacking in flavor - not much body at all. Not much taste. Not worth your time."
"I was recently in the liqour store with $5 and wanted to relive my college days so I decided to pick up some Olde E. What can I say that hasn't already been said about his terrible beer. It tastes like metal, corn, and stink. When I drink it, I want to get it down as soon as possible, no foam at all, with this beer. Same piss color that is know in this beer. Man stay clear of this one, only for the faint of heart, but it does catch up with you, I call this one the creeper."
"One taste is enough for this beast. It has an aroma of old malt and bad alcohol. There are some sour yeast smells as well. It has a dirty river color and not much head. It appears to be tan though. Body is think and syrupy which leads to poor drinkability. I will probably never again venture back to this stuff."
"Seen a lot of cheap beer in my short time, but I'd never seen this one before. Sounded cheap, was cheap so I bought it. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a perfectly clear straw color with a thin, sparkling white head. The smell is very underwhelming; corn, a slight fruitiness and a bit of grain are about all that are discernable. The taste reminds me of a pale euro lager - slight corny-grain sweetness up front followed by a dry, one-dimensional, boring finish. The mouthfeel is ultra light, if I had to guess, it's probably in the range of 1.00001 -maybe with a stale carbonation. Drinkability is decent due to the fact that it's cheap as hell and has 7.5% which isn't really that noticeable. Definitely not my choice in beer but I can see its purpose!"
"Ah Olde English. Any strong beer tastes good when you're down and out and looking for a cheap way to numb your brain. 7.5% is a nice little bonus and you'll be feeling good in no time. Although I swear to god getting drunk on good beer actually feels better, getting drunk for $2.37 is not that bad of a feeling as well. It goes down very smoothly for a concoction as strong as it is. You would think it would taste like nothing but alcohol. Considering this, Olde English can be considered at least well balanced, if not good tasting. But most of all I love that feeling of being boosed-up it gives you. You drink it, and you start to feel pretty drunk fast. Yeah, I like that."
"I don't care how cheap this is, I wouldn't drink this again if it was given to me. I would rather piss on a turd, blend it, microwave it and eat it! Avoid this beer at all costs. The name is deceiving, there is nothing Olde about this beer, and there is nothing English about it. The price tag may seem attractive, but so is a cheap hooker who ends up giving you herpes - OE800 is no different (yes I probably got herpes from drinking this shit)."
"I got arrested while drinking this when I was 15. To this day, I'm not sure if it was because of my age or my choice in drinks. This is definitely just for those who want to get drunk and don't want something to savor or enjoy. Avoid like the plague. Metallic and chemical."
"MF is of some corn, slightly sugary, with a really bad after-taste, without a doubt it is difficult to consume all 40oz, let alone 3 of them in a night, which I have done several times in the past, ahhhh the good old days."
"This malt liquor is just okay... However; it does get the job done... The appearance is average for a malt liquor, head retention is decent as seen within my 40. Smells like corn and alcohol. The taste is somewhat thin, but the mouthfeel is refreshingly fizzy. I would rate this at a decent drinkability."
"This 99cent,22oz bottle pours a typical see thru golden color,with pure white head that actually leaves some lacing as it quickly dissipates.It smells of bread dough,and a little musty alcohol.The taste is surprisingly not disgusting considering the ridiculous price(you cant buy generic soda this cheap,and in my opinion I would drink this over a soda any day),the mouthfeel is what you would expect,light bodied,average carbonation,no real aftertaste.I could easily drink this over any Bud or Miller product,it actually has more flavor than either of them,but probably more carbs!"
"Drinkability: It was all I could do to choke back 8 oz.... ""let's go get some real beer at Shakespear's"" (Sarasota)...."
"D- This is my 2nd favorite malt liquor it gets you pretty trashed and is better than a lot of them out there."
"Forget it... I don't care how many times this beer is mentioned in rap songs... Wouldn't drink this brew again if it was the only alcoholic drink offered at a party... actually ended up getting pretty nauseous after downing a 40 of this back in college... A lot of alcohol for your buck at 7.50% for a $1.99... Appearance is below mediocore and the smell is awful... not trying to sound like a beer snob, but those with class would avoid a hefty malt liquor like this unless for some reason you are a fan of this particular style... Mouthfeel was less than awful and the only upside of this brew is that once you made it past half the bottle, the other half goes down a bit easier..."
"Cheap drunk for a college student. Pennies for the ABV. Bit of a stale bread taste, some malt...heavy alcohol after-taste. Not good, at all, but gets the job done. Really nothing pleasant, or particularly unpleasant, about it."
"Look, if your'e drinking this then you are planning on getting lit on the cheap or just broke. Hopefully, if it is the former then you are in college, like I used to get down. Of course, I've been on the latter side also and it sucks, much like Old E. The light gold/yellow color is see thru when held up to the light, and the smell is just like rubbing alcohol. While the taste is horrendous, it at least does not contain a bitter aftertaste. Oh, and after slamming a few of these 40 ozs. expect a colossal headache the next morning."
"Just finishing college and having a lot of experince of horrible beer and esp. malt beer, this is prob my favorite, still it ranks low compared of the full flavors that are out there, if one has to drink a malt beer, then def stay away from this, its awefull"
"D - This is one of the least offensive malt liquors on the market (it's the most like real lager), but I like my 40s like I like my gansta rap...I want to be offended."
"Good malt liquor for the buck"
"Yellow in color with a head that lingers. Aroma is strong and sweet, somewhat corny. Taste is a bit hard to deal with at first. Not much to the imagination as far as taste goes anyway. Somewhat unsettling and bland on the tongue. Alcohol is not well hidden. Overall, not very drinkable. I'll take another bottle of Private Stock over this."
"Overall, it was surprisingly drinkable for a malt liquor. I hear it brings back the shine on olde furniture too."
"I like it! I know a lot of people don't like this brew but I mean come on for three dollars a six pack you can't be that and get a decent buzz afterwards. Awesome, definitely coming back."
""
"altogether uninspired, and no way I could finish a 40 of this. (even the 24 is trying my patience.) I do find it a bit more interesting than steel reserve, but still nowhere near rogue's dad''s little helper."
"If you like corn then this delicious malt liquor is right up your alley. With a nose of roasted corn cakes and a taste that combines can creamed corn with slight touches of whisky like fusel alcohol it is the perfect beer for a lover of raw corn. But not a tasty one."
"oh yeah...when you're 16 and looking for a $2 buzz out of a brown paper bag, this was the shit! basically a big version of an american macro lager with more malt adjuncts used, in this case corn, i think. no hop presence detected. looks like a macro in the bottle, i can't say i EVER poured this in a glass to find out. if you wanna get a buzz really cheap, this is a good place to start."
"What can be said that hasn't been said about the 40oz king of malts. Most users will describe the taste and feel in detail but with this brew, it all comes down to getting drunk. Very drunk. I drank three 40's of this a few years back at my house party. Lets just say I was more gone than the NYC blackout of 77. This is still a great brew for gettin drunk. Taste isn't half bad especially for a malt. Heck, the label hasn't even changed since the 70's. You see OE and you know what your in for. Keep swillin!!"
"Overall: There are better cheap malt liquors out there. Avoid this one. (By way of comparison, I found Schiltz Malt Liquor Bull a lot more drinkable than OE 800.)"
"What can you sayabout good old Ole E? Me adn a few buddies decided to down one for old times sake. Didn't pour it as how could you, this one has to be drank out of the brown bag for sure. Looks and smelled pretty much like urine. Not cool and I don't know how I drank soo much of this when I was younger. Ok so maybe the smell had the slightest moldy grain hint to it. The taste was ughh, Wow I really don't know how I used to pund this, I guess it was just the times. Overall I will never being going back to this one again. It was fun a long time ago, but now just painful. LOL, it was fun though and a good throwback."
"Pours a clear amber/golden, fluffy white head forms, disappears snap crackle and pop style, some lace spots. Smell is very sweet, corn, alcohol, caramel, citrus, bit of vanilla/floral, not too bad. Taste is very sweet, corny alcohol, iron in the finish, some bitterness, floral aftertaste, but very metallic. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, nice burn on the way down. Was expecting this to be worse, but its drinkable."
"Pours to a thin white head that goes away quickly. Color is yellow-gold with some floaties. Aroma is very weak and grainy. Flavor is sweet, corny and not very special. Drinks easy for 7%abv. Finishes sweet. I've had much worse malt liquors. Not terrible, but not very satisfying."
"it's all yours!"
"A very exciting meet we had here, recognizing the beer styles untested to most. Hats off to Light Ice, Malt Liquor, and Non-Alcoholic for their participation. Check my previous reviews to see what you missed of this contest. Good night everyone!"
"The beer is what it is. This beer is a 7.5% alcohol delivery system. At ninety nine cents a double duece this is acceptable. Man this was a bad idea and it will be awhile before I buy another beer from the good old days."
"myspace.com/passaicrock"
"IMO, this is not worth pouring into a pint glass, but for appearance, I had to. Poured from a 24oz. can, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light straw color, forming a 1 inch fluffy head, that actually left thick lacing on the glass. The aroma is bad, but not skunky. Mostly smells like corn and grain. The taste isnt as bad as most think, but its not quality by any means. Corn and grain flavor. Maybe a little malt too. Thin mouthfeel, making this easy to chug like many do. As far as malt liquor goes, I have to say that this is my favorite. That said, I only drink one maybe once or twice a year. Worth a try."
"A stereotypical example of this style, not a good one. I could think of one named after a famous firearm that is a much better example of this style of brew."
"D - Yikes. I literally almost vomited on my last gulp of this horrendous beer. Avoid at all costs, believe me you arent missing anything."
"This beer poured a light yellow color into a pint glass with a large 2 finger head that faded quickly. Carbonation was very high at first and then became flat after a few minutes. Aroma was corny and fruity with a hint of that rotting vege smell. Not good. Taste was just as bad. Very watery and boring with hints of the infamous rotting vegetables, corn grits and just a slight taste of malt. No hop or bittering flavor present. I didn't even pick up an alcoholic note, which you expect from this style. Mouthfeel was thin and bland. Drinkability was low due to the relative lack of flavor or body. The 40 became a drain pour after only about 10 ounces were gone. I don't understand what all the hoopla is with this beer. No wonder all the gangbangers are killing themselves. Something that tastes this bad would make a killer out of Gandhi. Not recommended at all."
"D - Drinkability is middle of the road. For the high ABV, these go down easy enough after you aquire the flavor. The final drunk from drinking 40's back in the day was just right. Adequate but, not excessive. Recomendeed for anyone on a budget or just getting into the beer world. Otherwise, just keep away."
"Mouth: Has a watery entrance that hits sour along the back of the mouth and just a hint of hops. Some sweet peach notes appear along the tongue after swallowing."
"Pours the typical malt liquor way. Slightly dark golden with a thing ring of bubbles. Typical corny/grainy smell and a hint of burnt veggies. Sweet tasting and not overly grainy. Lot of corn in the flavor, but this one is really smooth. Mouthfeel is surpisingly not sticky, considering the abv, yet it still holds firm in the mouth like a higher gravity malt liquor. Highly drinkable and a nice change from Steel Reserve. I think I've found my new favorite malt liquor."
"Olde English 800 drank straight from a clear thirty two ounce bottle. Color is orange. The smell is fairly nasty. Tastes like adjunct run amuck. This is fairly bad, not the worst malt liquor I've had, but not good either. For malt liquor connisouers and rappers only. Avoid unless you can only scrape up enough money for this."
"Yeah baby. The first malt liquor I ever tasted. Light yellow. Non-offensive, well hidden alcohol aroma with hints of corn and pear. Yes, its full of corn and its fairly grainy, but there isnt really anything in this that makes it intolerable. No off flavors whatsoever. Ill be honest, I finished all forty ounces and Im proud of it. This was much better than the Keystone Light that I had later in the evening."
"Drinkability: Thank god I only paid a buck fifty for this. I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it."
"Still, high alcohol content and low price makes it an excellent party beer."
"This doesnt even pretend to be a good beer, it is what it is and I dont like it. Its ironic that the only beer style with the word malt in the name has the smallest percentage of malt in it."
"Olde English is royalty amongst malt liquor 40s. Its light-amber coloration, hi-test corn-blessed constitution, and overall appeal are second to none in the malt liquor game. Enough ""slummin' w. da homiez"" bullshit; either drink this, or don't. No need to mock the poor in your poor attempt to cop a buzz. Olde English.. it might not boast the 'imported taste' of Private Stock, but it does have 33 crowns on the label. I counted."
"Pours yellow with perfect clarity. Fizzy white two and a half finger head that shows poor retention and no lacing whatsoever. The aroma is of ceral grain and apple ester, but nothing fowl. A faint grain taste is knocked aside by a huge hard cider flavor and alcoholic bite. Slightly dry aftertaste, with fusels and cider reteating comfortably. The flavor is too estery sweet even for the style and is grossly unbalanced; however- the flavor fades quickly and a medium body with medium carbonation creates a drinkability that is the strong pont of this beer. The finish is mostly clean and allows the consumer to get drunk fast for cheap, which is really the aim of this beer."
"Not impressed, but didn't expect to be. It is what it is. Maybe I'll consider this if I become homeless, but until then, I'll leave it on the store shelf where it belongs."
"As a teen I drank this a few times when I had little money to spend and wanted something to ""blitz"" on. I can not do an unbiased review here or attempt to review it as I would do my other beers, and with that being said here goes...This is by far the worst swill you could ever think to try and consume. It smells as bad as it tastes. Avoid at all costs unless you are the verry Adventurous . Homie don't play that!!!"
"My buddy was in a rush to get something simple from the local packy before it closed so I toldem to pick up a few good ol OE's. Decided to keep it real and drink this one straight from the 40 bottle with it still in the bag. Appearance....what can I say? Looks a lot like pee pee. Smell was of corn and other weak tasting grains that didn't do much at all for the beer. Taste had malt running amuck throughout and the alcohol was very up front. Mouthfeel was medium bodied due to excessive malt and alcohol presence. Drinkability wasn't bad until I got to the end, in which case I dumped the bottoms, which were just too harsh to quaf. Final Verdict: This isnt a good beer if yor are looking for quality...it may be okay in the world of cheap malt liquors serving only one purpose: to get you drunk quick, but it isn't anything to seek out. On the bright side, they're really cheap and if you want to get wasted without burning a whole in your wallet, just grab a couple of these. I advise playing Edward 40 Hands with this beer. Cheers"
"This stands out from most malt liqours since it has a bit higher alcohal percentage giving it a better deal. But I would recommend chugging it down so you won't have to bare the taste."
"ah, Olde English, what can i say about you? You're the 40 to drink if you have to drink a 40, i suppose. You look terrible and you stink real bad, but after the first little taste, all hoppy and smooth, i just can't stop until i've finished. Top of the line on malt liquors, in my opinion....and in some cases i'd rather drink this than light american lagers (coors, miller, genny)."
"This is a personal favorite of mine. Sometimes you just want a crappy beer, and this is it."
"On my way home from work I stopped for a beer at a weird redneck bar with a co-worker. There in the cooler behind the bar was a 40 of OE. So with my choices limited to crap I went a few steps further and got me a 40 of OE. Playing pool, drink a forty that cost me $5 was a weird way to get off work. Well it is a little darker than most adjunct beers but the smells is of corn and some kind of monkey urine. It tastes like cron urine and ash. Smooth like a handful of broken glass. I would drink this again most likely the best 40 I have had."
"Drinkability on the other hand is the best part, if you can ignore the smell and taste then you sure have found your beer. Probably around $2.?? for a fat 40 oz. So if your cheap then you'll dig this brew for sure."
"The fusel alcohols in this beer not only get you drunk faster, but more drunk, with more nausea. I was so ill after drinking this, never again. I'm bringing my own beer next time."
"Served the classic way--out of a 40oz bottle. Definitely resembles urine in both smell and appearance, with a pungently bland smell dominating the nose. Taste isn't terrible, its the kind of thing you'd get really used to after many sips, and the alcohol is such that if you want to let loose for a night, this is the way to go. Very little lingering taste or mouthfeel so it goes down easy and facilitates many more. Everyone needs a night with a beer like this, and at 2.50 the price can't be beat! (I realize there are MUCH better beers out there, but as far as malt liquor goes this is pretty good.) Enjoy!"
"This is the normal run of the mill 40 ounce malt liquor, its got a pretty bad unrefined taste, a bit of that dirty sweetness and its rather harsh.Having said that its a 40 and the main purpose of 40s is to get you slammed when your too poor to get anything else... its swill but its still a classic among 40z."
"Drinkability - Probably the best of the malt liquors. Faint praise, but praise indeed. This stuff isn't as poor as most in the category, and is actually quite unobtrusive. That is until it kicks you in the ass."
"Drinkability is good for the style. I had no trouble sinking the 8 ball. Exercise caution after drinking 2 jugs. Things can get foggy."
"I have this wierd addiction to having some schwill now and again just to keep things grounded. On my way back from the hollywood bowl I needed some malt liquor so this was the pick. 40oz'er served in a brown paper bag. smelled like corn soaked in sugar and roasted on an open flame. Tasted very similair except take out the open flame. Sugar and Corn. Drink this fast as it is sewer material as it gets warm. You can tell this is a highly sugar based beer. not reccomended except when hidden in a brown paper bag."
"Olde English 800 brings to mind the beautiful, pastoral English countryside of old, while The Eagle makes one think of rugged, individualistic, red-white-and-blue America. Only kidding. These are two simple bottles of beer that were brewed for one purpose and one purpose only: inebriation. OE 800 is the superior product, but I caution the reader that 'superior' is a strictly relative term."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, the head rises rapidly with the consistency of creamy dish washing soap suds; egg-white white. The body is pale gold and surely you can conjure up the apt metaphor here without me having to do it for you. Smell: corn flakes, wet newspaper, old and brown apple cores. Taste: puckering sweetness upfront, backed up nicely by the viscous mouthfeel (this is not a beer to drink at a temperature that is anything less than cold), pursued by a peppery hop bitterness, very slight and in the background; simple sugary malt sweetness dominates the taste. Aftertaste, some alcohol heat -- felt in the throat and gut -- and just that sweetness fading out like so much sugary apple juice. Mouthfeel: a few steps away from having the texture of loose mucous."
"Please!"
"Pours a medium straw yellow with a fizzy, almost white head. Nose is nutrasweet over cornflakes, with a slight metallic twang, and no detectable hop bitterness. Taste starts with faintly sweet cereal malt, with a burgeoning powdery smarties candy edge. Light cardboard throughout and minimal hop bitterness and flavor. Slightly sweet in the finish. Not poisonous, but I remember why I stopped drinking this stuff!"
"Pours a piss yellow color with very large head that fades but stays there till the beer is gone. Smell is like all the other mass produced beers out there. Taste is very bland, but the mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth. The best part of the beer actually. The aftertaste is pretty good too. This beer is so-so, but alot better than I expected for a beer in 40."
"I have been told that this brew will give you ""rhythm and soul."" This may or may not be true, but as far as foties go, this one is in the mid range. Clear bottle, piss yellow substance. Taste and smell cause you to make some funny faces. There are sicker foties on the market, but perhaps there are better ones as well. If you are really looking for this type of beer, it isnt the worst; if you think you are buying the next great beer, think again"
"Even so, I have a love for OE. I first drank it last summer, and I've had it often since. It's quite funny to chug out of such a big bottle. Pair it with fried chicken (no joke) for a really good time."
"Not ot drink really... but the 7.5% has one hell of a kick."
"As little as there is to this beer, and as negative as the review may seem I still think this is one of the top malt liquors out there. I have consumed more of this than I care to admit back in the day. Goes down easy, for all the trashy liquor it contains, you do the math."
"Well I have to say... There's a darn good reason why this stuff is cheap! I had a 40, and I had to commit the ultimate beer sin... pouring out half of it... The first half of the bottle was OK, but by the second half, I had to really struggle to drink it.. My standard arguments like ""I paid money for this"" really failed to work... It certainly smells rather gross too... It feels alright in your mouth, at least until it gets bitter... It's pretty sweet for malt liquor, not a good thing in my opinion... I personally prefer Schlitz Malt Liquor... I think it would taste MUCH better if I had just slammed the 40, but alas, I did not."
"Overall-while this may be the ""standard"" for malt liquors as i have heard (what a bloody joke) Olde English is the same as any other malt liquor, i.e. its ghastly. Thanks to Pete for the can but for the rest of you, if this is your thing go with Colt 45."
"In my opinion, this is the best cheap malt liquor out there. It's strong, better tasting and easier to drink than King Cobra or St. Ides and it certainly does the trick. There isn't much to say about it. It's not a beer that you pour into a nice glass or savor or anything like that, rather it's a classic swiller that gets you drunk and gives you giant ""beer balls"". I feel like I could knock out Tyson right now. Bring it on!"
"Cheers!"
"One of the worst Malt Liquors I've ever drank. It poured a medium golden color with a small fizzy head that faded as soon as it came. The smell was of a nasty sourness and grain. The taste was way too sweet and nasty. This is a cheepy that I will never be picking up again. The High Gravity version is much better in compairison."
"As far as 40s go, it doesn't get much better than this. This is the standard by which all others are judged. I can truely say that this doesn't actually taste ""bad"". It is very smooth with a solid malt backing. There is a slight bitterness, but it doesn't taste like it is caused by hops. Overall, there is just nothing like swilling down a 40 of OE and listening to some ATCQ."
"Well, I only bought this in order to compare it to Dogfish Head's Liqueur de Malt, and since I was lucky enough to have a sample of that at Penn, I figured I'd see how it measures up. Well, DFH measures up pretty damn well. I only have the pint glass and it's already rather difficult to finish off...couldn't imagine finishing off an entire 40 (poured a sample for the bro, and gave the rest ""to our dead homies""). I can say this has motivated me, since it will drive me to never want to be poor enough to have to drink this ever again!"
"OK, I went into this expecting utter garbage. What I found was a surprisingly drinkable beer with an innofensive flavor and a decent punch. Lets be honest, this beer is meant to do one thing...get you f'd up. Mission accomplished. There is no hop flavor, but a slightly grainy malt flavor. There are the usual corn/rice/other crap flavors, but the fact is the beer does its job. If you are brown bagging it OE is the way to go."
"5/10"
"drinkability, it isn't offensive, so i could drink a good bit of it; but do i want to."
"so as i finish this corn-ridden 8-ball, i propose a toast to the finest 40 ounce beverage on the market. it's the attitude adjuster. long live olde E"
"Taste: water. Grain-inflected water, slightly sweet, but, barely anything, with a cereal grit in the mouthfeel, if it can claim any at all. There are traces of malt in the taste, minor at best, and nothing else, this is a shadow of a beer, a whisper, a phantom, but one that has a trick up it's sleeve, like all the best of this variety. Oh, yeah, no bothersome flavor, but extra-boozy, that's why they drink this ...and only a few tastes in, I can feel the hurt and the headache beginning to gather forces on my mind, and I wonder whether this exercise in masochistic research is worth it at all (the bottle was a gift, as a joke, and the punchline arrived as soon as I announced I was drinking it), and I'm sure it's not...Time to send this swill down the drain and save my brain. There's a nice doppelbock calling my name, once I wash the taste of this garbage from my mouth."
"Drinkability? This stuff was the lowest of the low back when I was in College. It isn't great but even swill like this beats the regular macro stuff."
"Comments  The ABV has when up almost one and a half points from when this ale was added to the site (its now at 7.5%). I guess the quicker you go numb the easier this is to drink."
"Man Im happy I dont have to live in a roach condominium and drink this any more..at least though its better than Camo."
"I drank it straight from the 40 oz. bullet bottle. Dark yellow color, that has a sizable white head, evn in the bottle. Taste is very sweet and full of adjunct flavor. Some presence of alcohol, but not that much. With most beer in this price and ABV range, this stuff is meant to give you a cheap buzz. It does that, but it doesn't taste good."
"Drinking OE isn't the best experience in the world. A very skunky smelling and tasting beer. The only plus side to this is that you will get drunker quicker, but lets face it is that all that fun? Anyway when I was in high school I drank these constantly so recently I went back for a test taste. OE comes in a 40 oz bottle with a red and gold label. Beer is piss type yellow with no head. You do not want this beer in your mouth for long. The quicker it is in your throat the better. The only time to drink this is if you only have 2 bucks and you have a party to go to."
"I bought this the only way this should be bought; in a 40 ounce. I went back to kick it in the crib and that's where I think I made my first mistake. I poured it into a glass (and half on the floor for my homies). It poured a straw yellow color With a foamy head that had little lasting power. About a minute or so. It had a stench of gross to it. A little bit of a grainy corn smell and a bit of a skunky smell. It was hard to tell which was stronger. The taste was semi bitter with the grainy thing going on again. The skunk was still there too, though not as strong. Even though it's clear that this isn't my favorite beer, I would drink it again. For my biatches."
"This isn't truly atrocious (I thought Silver Thunder and Country Club neared those limits). OE800 seems to be a popular ""ghetto mixer"" as well. For example, while the ""Brass Monkey"" is the most popular variant (OE and orange juice), a co-worker of mine has mentioned the combination of OE and sloe gin. Anyways, this is a cheap beer that only exists only for those who want to get plastered. What you do with it after you buy it is your choice, but I won't be choosing to make this a regular habit anytime soon, even if it is somewhat drinkable."
"Pours a transparent yellow, apple-juicy color with a vigorous white head that fades quickly (yes, I am actually pouring this into a glass...). Little to no carbonation. Smell is... whew. Big alcohol sting and little else except vague sensation of acidic chemicals, and maybe notes of adjuncty sweetness that's saccharine and foul, like those awful, artificial sugar substitutes (Nutrasweet, Sweet-N-Low). Less alcohol noticeable in the taste, taking a back seat to more artificial sweetness; slightly tart in the back palate but finishing with a twang of plastic (so help me god, plastic). Mouthfeel isn't that bad for a 40. Since this is easy to drink fast when cold, I originally gave drinkability a 2.5... half an hour later, when my gut felt like it had turned into a ball of rock, I changed my mind. This brew has its moments and out of college-day nostalgia (sittin on the curb and swillin out of a paper bag), I tried cutting it some slack on the scores, but still... O.E. be some nasty isht."
"Did not care for taste worth the buzz.But I drink beer for thirst and flavor and most important quality.This beer tasted in between a coors light and a tecate. Would not buy again.Ill stick with guinesses and redneck side of my blood which means coors or keystone light.STAY AWAY FROM THIS BEER.EBONICS DONTS MISSA ROUND WITH THIS SHIT"
"Really, if I wanted to drink something that tasted like liquid corn, I'd...wait...why would I ever want to drink liquid corn? Feel free to avoid this one."
"Drink this as cold as you can. It gets nasty the warmer it gets. I must say though, after I drank this, my stomach was mad at me for quite a bit."
"Overall, I don't think I would purchase this one when looking for a malt liquor but my ""flashback"" tour of the malt liqours of my younger days is barely getting started...I give colt 45 a slight edge on this one...very slight though.."
"This was on sale at the LCBO for $3.50. Since I'm also buddies with most of the people their, they sold it to me for a toonie, rather surprised I was buying low quality beer. I told them I hadn't tried it, and they accepted that as a good answer. Since this is malt liquor, I drank straight from the bottle. Can't comment much on appearance except for what I could see through the glass. Little browner than a Colt 45. When swished, some foam would appear that would soon quickly disappear. Smelled alot of corn, cheap malt and something acidic. Tasted very grainy and sweet. Hey, is this candy? It is that cloyingly sweet. Shitty mouthfeel. Too much cheap malt texture with a corn field. Drinkable for drunks and whores. Undrinkable for me."
"My in-laws had a 40 of this stuff in the fridge that they bought for cooking. Not having tried it in decades, I couldn't resist and poured a glass. It looks like a basic glass of beer. After that, things go downhill. The smell is grainy, corny, and a bit acidic with no real redeeming qualities. The taste is more of the same. One glass did a number on the stomach. This wasn't a pleasant experience."
"All 40 ounces preserved in it's classic presentation, Olde E is a legendary beer. Yeah, right this beer is ghetto swill in all it's glory. Made famous by Run DMC in eighties, this beer pours a golden similar to apple juice hue. Pours with a thick foamy head that cloys around the rim of my mug, with a decent head retention. Aroma is straight up unpleasant, all cereal grains with an astringent slightly cooked vegetable scent. From the smell you would think this stuff could take of some layers of paint from the wall. Taste is highly carbonated watery yet acoholic harsh bitter nasty ass taste. Not a slow sipper chug this and bypass the palate, this beer is for getting folded. I really can't tolerate this one but it's a favorite of my friends. So, in closing there is no question this is one shitty beer. Watch out for the hangovers this beer is known to cause, in my opinion steer clear."
"22 oz. clear bottle. Purchased for $1.09."
"The drinkability is kinda high for the beer style. This brew is a lot less metallic and chemical tasting than the others. I just thought it beats out all it competitors in the macro-malt liquor class."
"If sublime can sing about it, it's gotta be good! At any rate, it's a good malt liquor. Has a nice light taste to it. It has a very pale yellow color to it with a white ""head"". Goes down easy, but can get rough a little. When I'm lookin; to save some money and drink a little, this is what I usually grab for. Sometimes though, 40oz can be a little too much. Definately a good buy if you are in college."
"""40 ounces to Freedom""... Pours a crystal clear golden body topped by a frothy bright white head that holds surprisingly well and drops to a creamy surface covering. It also leaves some lace in the glass which is quite unusual considering the high alcohol - although I doubt that's rarely noticed inside the 40 oz bottle! The aroma is also surprisingly bold, but with a distinct cereal-cooker aroma and a firm touch of alcohol. There is some grainy maltiness underneath, but it's overshadowed. Powerful, but not really inviting. The body is thin/medium but the high level of fine carbonation helps it to become creamy immediately, thus giving the impression of a fuller mouthfeel. The residual alcohol that's left after the swallow adds to that impression. The flavor mimics the aroma with a harsh, semi-grainy maltiness rather than the more straightforward sweet malt flavor usually found in malt liquors. The alcohol also lends to an astringent character. Hop bitterness is subdued, as is normally the case with malt liquors, except that it's more noteable here. However, it's quite dull and doesn't add anything to the character. From start to finish this beer lacks finesse. Sure it's bold, but it's also extremely blunt. Maybe that's why people like it... in a way I can see how this could be less cloying as it doesn't offer the bright, super sweet maltiness of many malt liquors - but at the same time it's fairly harsh and the trade-off doesn't seem worth it. Disappointing. This beer deserves to be wrapped in a paper bag. There are much better malt liquors on the market. Take a step up to the Coqui 900!"
"Pours a clear golden hue with a medium white soapy head with large bubbles.  The smell is very, very faint...with no discernable aromas.  First taste reveals a carb bite and a semi-sweet very faint corn taste with nothing else.  This is like a near tasteless/odorless semi-high alcohol in a can.  The mouthfeel is very watery and I rate the drinkability high as their is nothing offensive to slow you down!  Very little to say about this beer.  Cheers!"
"With its ""old world"" label, and pee like color, I was enticed to one more time embibe one. This is just pure aweful. No taste, or substance. My breath smelled like I was hanging out with winos all day. Smells like the subway on a hot day."
"I can't imagine drinking 40oz of this regularly. Unfortunately I didn't have any fallen homies to tip it for, so this was shared between 4 people (I know, we are SO ghetto). I wonder if the Belgian Monks tip a Westy when they lose one of theirs? I'd still take this over an A/B product any day."
"First thing that comes to mind is watery. Second thing that comes to mind is watery...and on and on and on. Did I forget to mention that I think that this beer is watery? Look, I really would like to give readers more information about this 40oz Old English 800, but there just isnt any..."
"well i really can't add too much that already hasn't been said about this malt liquor.  it's not horrible but the adjunct bite is a little hard on the nostrils and taste buds.  and considering the ""cool"" people that have been reviewing malt liquors lately, i might not appreciate this fine beverage as much as i should/could.  OE is a quick buzz maker for those who drink beer primarily to get juiced.  and in my case, a way to administer an attitude adjustment after a hard day at work."
"Thanks for providing this sample, Johnny-Boy."
"Medium amber with slight head.  Slight carbonated. Smooth with a surprising sweetness.  Slighty more malty than hoppy, but otherwise nicely balanced."
"This is the worst malt liquor out there. Why anyone would want to drink any of this crap is beyond me, let alone 40 ounces of pure OE piss. If you really want to get hammered (you must if you are considering this) then go get St. Ides or a Steel. Both have more alcohol and taste better. This stuff blows."
"Notes: Yikes! This is some harsh stuff, it is more than a chore to swill down 40 ounces of this. Many names have been given to this brew but “Ghetto Juice” sticks the most. This seems to be one of the worst but one of the most talked about malt liquors … celebrities that drink this style of beer usually drink this. Go figure?"
