"If you have a choice @ 2 for $3.00 between this and Icehouse Edge... You're better off going with Icehouse Edge, and that's all I have to say... about that."

"Could possibly drink if there was nothing else."
"Overall:  I don't think I could place this either above or below standard 211.  They're both pretty awful."
""
"O: Overall crafted much better then your typical malt liquor, more speciality grain influence, sweet, very clean, no noticeable alcohol, and offers a surprising easy drinkability. I would drink this in a pinch over any BMC product and price per pound not a bad choice for those who like the style. This isn't your daddys malt liquor, and is not bad in the end. a bit sweet overall for multiples. rated to style."
"O - I was actually pretty tupsy after the one can. May not taste great, but it is dirt cheap and has plenty of alcohol. Will buy again for sure on nights i just want to get drunk without liquor."
"O - Let's realize that this stuff is a cheap and effective way to introduce alcohol into your body. I would highly recommend keeping this stuff as close to freezing as possible. It is actually one of the better entries in this class as there is much worse out there (Evil Eye or Camo come to mind). After spending 6 hours working outside on a 88 degree day this stuff isn't too bad."

"O: While the Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity) had some decent flavor to it, this version is just plain awful - the alcohol is not well hidden and is reminiscent of jet fuel and there is a strange metallic presence as well. I would not get this one again for any reason."

"Bought in the 24 oz can for the grand price of $1.19 I poured this into a glass ( i know its a no-no for ML afficienados!) Its actually quite nice looking foir a Malt liquor..darker gold than the usual and witha small white head. Very malt, dough aroma..not bad..not nasty at all. Very smooth semi-sweet tasting beer..very malty, small alcoholic kick at the back of the mouth..warms the belly afterwards. Nice enough beer for the style. I actually like this"
"Update: 4/ 29/2014: Latest version loses 1 full point for appearance almost no head or lacings."

"Steel Reserve 211 Triple Export ---2/5."
"I don't know why others have been dissing this one,I love it!!! I found it at a local Ingles for 99 cents a can,and an 8.1 abv!!!! It feels like there are a lot of beer snobs out there!! I drink a lot of non-alcoholic beers,too!! But once in a while,it doesn't hurt to kick it up a notch!! I'll be buying more of these,down the road!!"

"The smell is sweet and not unlike other malt liquors, but the taste is unlike anything I've ever had in a malt liquor before. I'm surprised the reviews aren't higher because this is clearly an attempt at changing up malt liquor for the beer connoisseur. It tastes STRONGLY of yeast, like it was bottle conditioned. Or, I guess, can conditioned in this case. It takes a lot away from the sweetness and the thinness that is the status quo in malt liquors. As a fan of some malt liquors, I'm not sure if I like this significant departure, but as a fan of quads, I enjoy it. So, I'm torn as to whether it's really OK for it to be somewhere in between. It is so far from what I was expecting. It's like someone tried to make a lager into a quad with really low quality ingredients, but with plenty of know-how nonetheless. Strange, but enjoyable. I think I'm going to have to rate it pretty highly. One problem is that it's not as refreshing as other malt liquors or as quads because it lacks that fruity quality. It's just pure yeast flavour. It retains a bit of that chemical flavour of regular Steel Reserve, but the yeast covers it up pretty well. Weird, wild stuff and definitely quite different from ordinary silver-canned Steel Reserve."

"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Lots of carbonation. Smell is big on corn, some other grains, maybe hay. Taste is corn, some alcohol and grains, a touch of malts. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while I wouldn't want a steady diet of it, considering the abv and price point, it's not the worst malt liquor out there."
"Overall: Not a very good way to get a buzz here. The ABV indeed is pretty killer, but choking it down to get there is not too pleasant. There are easier ways to accomplish this, even with cheap malt liquors. That being said, this is one of the cheapest I've seen, soooo there's that."
"RJT"
"nothing really special to report...if you hate high gravity lagers that slap you in the face, dont go here...this is barely better than silver label 8.1%...if Hurricane High Gravity is in your area...id get that instead."
"Note: The can claims ""We believe this to be among the very best beers in the world."" That's disconcerting."

"Nothing about this beer says, ""Share this with your friends."" Nothing says that you should buy it for parties or hand it out at family gatherings. But for what it offers, it delivers. If you need a buzz and a bowel movement, this is your choice for ninety-nine cents. Nothing else can offer so much for so little."
"D - If not for the b.o. smell, this wouldn't be too bad...but it's just pretty overpowering"
"D: Surprisingly, not as awful as I was anticipating (given Steel Reserve's infamous reputation). I'd still rather have some Stack or Haffenreffer Private Stock, son."
"I am disappointed. I look forward to trying this again as I think something is off in this review. It may be me. I've had this once before I remember being impressed?"
"Heh."
"From the CAN: ""Slow brewed in limited batches, using only the finest malted barley & selected hops, we believe this to be among the very best beers in the world."" Really?!? Do they also believe in the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny? How about buying the Brooklyn Bridge from me, cheap? ""Slow brewed for exceptionally smooth flavor"". Zounds!"
"D- I gets the job done but with nothing to brag about."
"I think this tastes smoother than the silver 211. Like comparing a filtered cigarette to a Lucky Strike. When I'm in the mood for a cheap malt liquor, this one will be at the top of my list."
"Pours a so-so clear straw yellow with a fairly thick but not persistent white head. Aroma is crisp and malty, fairly strong but nothing to enter on your blog. Flavor is malty and crisp, slightly sour, slightly sweet. Texture is smooth, a little on the watery side, just a bit tingly. Not too shabby, but I doubt I'll be seeking this one out."
"Drinkability: Does ""drinkability"" mean pouring the beer into a big funnel attached to a hose that is pointing into your mouth? That's about the only way I'd ever want to have one of these again -- just get it past my taste buds as quickly as possible before they are somehow damaged by this beer."
"It's a good thing that this brew is high in alcohol content and comes in a big can that can be downed quickly for a good buzz, because it certainly isn't a sipper and letting it warm ever so slightly brings its horrid fusels to the foreground. Everything about this beer is laughable from a true appreciator of beer, as the company titles it ""Triple Export," as if it has some high status as an export beer, moving on to describe the production process and the high quality of ingredients, and finishing their lauding with the statement already mentioned earlier. My girlfriend's cat, who will eat and drink pretty much anything, couldn't even stand this stuff. This is nothing but a beer to bomb, not some masterpiece of brewing ingenuity."
"D - I understand that there are people in the world that can drink these like water. I also understand that there are people who engage in sexual acts with barnyard type animals. I fall into neither of these two personality types, and would discourage anyone from attempting either."
"D - A little less drinkable than some malt liquors because of the huge alcohol presence. Sweetness grows as the beer warms. It is ok if you wanna get wasted, but I'll either be choking the rest of this 24 oz down or pouring it down the drain."
"Ok I did not pour this down the sink. The brew looks ok really, it's a cheap beer with some color to it, a deeper amber than usual, foaming 1 inch head that goes to nothing. Not much smell. Taste is odd and medicinal. This brew affects the head very quickly and in a way that really cheap wines I've only ever drunk once in my youth did. Other beers may have a higher ABV but this hits too fast."
"For what it is, it's actually a little better than average. I wouldn't buy it again, but I like to try new things."
"Acceptable tasting inexpensive beer that is sure to give you more bang for the buck toward a quick buzz."
"The drinkability of this beer is quite simple: drinkability hardly exists with this beer. this is the beer a homeless guy drinks just to quicken the downward spiral. if you are one that champions this beer, give up, cut your wrist, and let your loved ones know you're a failure at spelling failure. Think about it."
"D - This will be the last time I drink this malt beverage but if you want to get drunk quick for cheap this is for you"
"Pours gold with a small head that dissipates quickly. Smell is slightly sweet with some alcohol and adjuncts. Taste is quite sweet. Corn. Some grape notes as well. Definitely some alcohol too. Finishes dry. Medium mouthfeel, maybe a little heavier than your average malt liquor which I'm not sure is a good thing or not. Somewhat drinkable. Overall this is definitely just a dressed up malt liquor."
"Had this in the black pounder can in GA and it is not that bad considering how cheap it is, and how high the alcohol content is. The black can catches the eye, hence the the 2.5. It has a aluminum smell w/ alcohol, but the taste is a tad smooth and doesn't have that swillish backlog most malt liquors do. I rated this a little higher than I should have, but compared to its peers its not bad. I couldn't have more than a couple of these at the same time w/o getting ill."
"Drinkability: I'm fairly certainly this beer has no allusions of being another other than a malt liquor in a tall, black can, and, while there aren't many pleasing qualities to it, at least there isn't anything too displeasing about it, either."
""
"Flavor is corny and too sweet, mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but overall this is better than i expected. It goes down pretty smoth, and for a 99 cent ""get ya drunk"" beer, it's better than most i've tried in this category."
"Not as bad as you may expect. Tastes like a good American macro beer (if you believe in such a thing.)"
"I've come to find that a lot of other people like this beer too. My local gas station is either out of it or stocked so heavily, the beer cooler is half filled with it. While making small talk with the clerk, I say, "" you guys sell a lot of this stuff. You're always running out."" His reply was, ""yeah, the whole neighborhood is on it."" haha, this stuff is all about a buzz for cheap."
"SERVE VERY COLD!"
"Oh man, what was I thinking? I have had regular 211 and it was average for the style but this is borderline undrinkable. The appearance is a fizzy yellow headless hell. The smell is a sweet-sour rotton corn smell. The taste is like rotting corn with a slight bourbon-like finish. The mouthfeel is one of the worst I have ever had. This stuff burns going down like moonshine. I will never drink one of these again. In fact, there is still half a can in my fridge if anyone is interested."
"Once again, I am subjecting myself and my taste buds to the misery of a malt liquor. I've resolved to try as many of these high gravity slumming beers as I can since my home state of NC lifted the cap to 15% abv. My other mission is to sample every DIPA I can get my hands on, a much tastier decision in my opinion. Now, onto the Steel Reserve. This beer pours a clear golden color with a 1 inch head that fades rather quickly. The bubbles rising to the top of my glass are large indeed, and I know this means that this beer is full of adjuncts. The first whiff confirms this as I can detect aromas of corn and a sweet, funky odor coming from the glass. The taste is of corn, adjuncts and overcarbonated water with a bit of a citrusy, sweet aftertaste. I tasted the alcohol early, but as I finished the 24oz can, I really didn't taste the alcohol anymore. Strange. For 99 cents, I guess this stuff isn't too bad. At least it didn't kill me."
"24 ounce black can. $1.09 at Peace Street Market."
