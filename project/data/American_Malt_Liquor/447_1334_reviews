"You don't get a colt 45 for the taste. But as far as I'm concerned it's not that bad. Good way to get drunk fast and cheap."

"Ol'skool like OE, King Cobra, etc...not for a true beer drinker, poor quality. Drove while drinking one of these in my younger days and got pulled over (days when you think you're invincible) I couldn't find my license and it was in the same spot as always..lucky cop let me go because I worked for state at the time and was a couple of blocks away!! I found out that day about poor quality vs good quality lol!!! Bottoms up!!!"
"Colt 45 Malt Liquor ... beer like beer"

"If you're drinking Colt 45 you aren't looking to drink for taste or the experience. You're drinking to get drunk. If I've got 3 bucks I'm wanting to blow colt 45 is a go to. Cheap and doesn't taste god awful either. The key thing to remember though is it's a Colt 45!  Gets you drunk, that's it."

"This beer is horrible. Period."

"Honestly, not nearly as bad as I was lead to believe. Pours a pale orange with a thin head. The smell is mild although there is some malt notes. The taste had a nice beginning, but there was a bit of a sour, almost metallic, twinge on the end. Not a great beer, but by no means the worst either."

"Very light in color an has a very distinct malt smell. Taste linger in your mouth and not necessarily in a good way. Actually, the 40oz in front of me right now happens to be expired by two months I see. Not skunked though, tastes fine. Watery and incredibly easy to go down."

"Overall: Afroman didn't write a song about Olde English, because there is no better way to enjoy a night of easy livin' like a Colt 45 and a couple of spliffs. [Now legal for recreational us in Colorado and Washington.] Weighing in at 6.1% alcohol by volume, Colt is the second most boozy beer we've tasted this year. Want to get ghetto girl wasted without having to sacrifice your taste buds? Look no further than Colt 45. It works every time."

"Was broke and wanted a beer. Not my proudest moment buying this stuff but for a couple bucks for a 40 who cares. It was expired a few months and came with a free one. Smells like old Budweiser that's been left in a red solo cup all night. I took a swig and damn it was so bad I spit it on my windshield. Tasted like old gym socks and pig feed corn. I threw that bottle out the window of my car. Nasty terrible stuff. Afroman lied to us"

"Well when im broke and want to get a buzz goin this will probably be leaving the store with me, certainly not my proudest moments but i don't care. Not really much for taste to write home about, there's of course a pretty obvious maltiness to it, besides that there's just like a stale bread taste which is just about as appealing as it sounds. I could be missing some flavors since i just chug it before it gets too warm or flat, but im sure im not missing much. When it comes to 40s though this is one of the better choices. Overall if you just want to get a buzz on the cheap, pick one of these up. Another added bonus is you can blast some wu-tang and pretend you're in a 90s rap music video...if that's what you're into..."

"O: not bad at all... a little less of a rich flavor than an Old E (very fond of that one), the flavor of grain kernels sticks out... alcohol seems a notch or two more exposed... I'll stick with my Old E, though I won't refuse this when offered it"

"There are far better choices if you are a fan of malt liquor."

"Colt 45. What more can you say?"
""
"Colt 45 Malt Liquor brewed by the Pabst Brewing Company. This brew has an abv of 5.61. Colt 45 brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. The smell of this brew is corn and beer, that is it. Nothing different from other malt liquors on the market. The taste is smooth clean and refreshing. There is no harsh after taste it is smooth. This brew goes down smooth. Nothing bad about this brew. Mouth feel is nice and smooth and refreshing. This malt liquor is one of the smoothest I had. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3 out of 5. I will get this brew again."

"From a quart bottle. Pours to an attractive thick white head and erratic but substantial lacing. Strange-looking clear tarnished gold color. aroma is sweet, alcoholic, but ""vegetal"" (asparagus?!) and grainy with no discernible hop character. Flavor is much of the same as aroma but very palatable and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly and surprisingly ""smooth"" as in it does not have astringency or excessive carbonic bite. Overall, this is drinkable and mostly unoffensive. Believe it or not. Not really good at all, but not bad. there are much worse cheap adjunct brews out there. I guess I'm not a beer snob after all. I reviewed this beverage on its merits as a cheap drink and party brew and give it no more than a 3.0 for any flavor or aroma ratings. Really. For the style, it is one of the best, but I'm not giving 4's all around for any ""malt liquor"" no matter how ""on style"" it is. Malt liquors are for getting a buzz, not craft beer savoring anyway."

"Overall: this beer is getting worse with warming even faster than I would imagine. I had so much hope for it when it was so pretty! Anyway, not the worst thing in the world, but you might even be better off going with a Mickey's."

"Final Grade: 2.06, an ugly D-. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I guess sometimes reputations are just well-earned. Colt 45 tastes like ass, which may be why I've never seen anyone I know drink it, ever. Like any beverage with 8% alcohol in it, it'll get'cha drunk if that's your primary objective, but you'll want to drink it ice cold and rapidly, and probably out of a paper bag if you have any pride. I'm proud of my fellow countrymen; the fact that I've never seen anyone else stoop so low as to actually purchase this warms the cockles of my heart ever so slightly. Now excuse me while I finish this can, and then cry in the shower."

"what was going to be a gag gift for a relative that likes to make fun of the craft beers i enjoy. he missed the party i decided to give the colt a try. poured from the 22 oz bottle(funny couldn't find a 40 of this brand in my area). pale straw in color, smells of grain and nothing else. bit of a off after taste. not a bad beer for what it is i would like to try more of this style and come back to this beer for a better understanding."
"Not bad for what it is. It's smooth, cheap beer with a bit more alcohol. Fits the style well enough."

"The third malt liquor in our classy malt liquor tasting. Pours a clear yellow color with a white head with average retention. usual corn sweetness in the nose. bit rough in the taste. Theres some corn sweetness, bit skunky funk that is pretty unpleasant. Not that malt liquors are delicious, but this definitely isn't one of the best."

"Ahhh good old Colt 45. I remember my first time ever having this at a party when I was about 15. Seems like forever ago. Anyway, Onto my review. I truthfully don't care about what anybody says about this stuff. I loved it. It goes down smoother than any beer you could possibly buy in a 40 ouncer, And it tastes like something for triple the price. No it isn't perfect, But at $1.85 for a 40oz you absolutely cannot beat it. I never would have guessed that it rated in at 5.6% alcohol. I tasted no carbonation whatsoever, Surprising since it's looks like it would be filled to the brim with the stuff. This stuff is worth a try no matter what type of beer drinker you are"

"Flavors are similar, sliced apples and some cereal grain. Thankfully it's not astringent really, as the worst offenders of the style are. Lighter carbonation over time, but it's still a bit gaseous and burp inducing. Drank this with no complaints to be honest. As far as malt liquors go, it's mad decent."

"Pours a straw yellow, almost golden, with a soapy looking bright white head. The color is further from urine than others, so i enjoy it. Smell is acidic alcoholic and grainy. Decent sweet taste and good bubbliness, refreshing as well. One of the first beers i ever tried and haven't had it in years, but it isn't a bad choice, more flavor than most adjuncts, but doesn't quite beat mickey's, my model malt liquor"
""
""
""
""

"This isn't a bad beer, but honestly even for the style there's nothing special here. It may be worth the cheap price tag for a a cheap drunk but otherwise avoid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What can I say really? Pours to my mouth from the bottle duct taped to my hand with attitude. Color is golden with some foam at the top, white, and light. Smells a good bit like corn. Flavor is light with rough finish, corn, hay, water. Mouthfeel is just terrible here, with a light body but somehow offensive on my tongue. You know what you're getting here."

"O: This stuff actually isn't terrible. I was expecting much, much worse."
"Pours a pale yellow with a hint of orangeness in color. Clear fizzy body, white head that lasts a decent time. It has the taste of corn, rice, some slight fusel oil. I thought it would taste more alchoholic than it does. Overall not bad"
"Overall - It's peculiar, but there is nothing offensive about it. This is a good beer."
"Overall - Bad, but drinkable because there's really nothing there."
"Overall, an average experience...thirsty? hot? want a little buzz? This is certainly a cheap remedy."
"O - For a malt liquor, it's quite tolerable. The alcohol content isn't too high, so it doesn't have a boozy aroma or flavor like others in its category. If you want a cheap moderate buzz, treat yourself to a deuce or a forty (brown bag included)."
"Beer is sweet medium to light in body. Actually not bad, there is no aftertaste, it is slightly corny throughout but I've had much much worse. It is wet throughout and the finish is also wet. I drank the whole thing and I doubt I'd ever have more if it but it was as good as Schlitz. Which is a compliment if you were confused by that comment."
"Overall: If it weren't for the fart smell, this wouldn't be half bad. If you're in the mood for something cheap without a whole lot of flavor, its not a bad way to go. Hard to beat the price too. And who can resist consuming 40oz in one sitting?"
"Taste is sweet and full-bodied. Grainy and adjunct filled flavor with plenty of scrubbing carbonation. One of the smoother malt liquors, but at 5.61%, it falls on the low side of the scale for this style. I would rather grab a few Coors Originals than drink this stuff. Has a light mustiness and the hops are pretty non-existent. I think the 7-8% ABV range is the money slot for malt liquors, above that and they start getting grimacingly tough to drink and below that you might as well just go with your basic Adjunct Lager."
"D - if you can get past the smell this is worth giving a chance just due to the price"
"Brownish gold beer straight out of a 40 ounce bottle. No pouring necessary, except what's poured for my homies. Smells a little skunky and of sweet adjuncts. Sugary sweet flavors of corn and grain. It's not something I'll buy very often. Milwaukee's Best 40s are cheaper and taste better, even if they don't have that signature bottle shape."
"I haven't had a malt liquor since I was a teenager, and I suppose my personal prerequisite is it not make me sick. Colt .45 isn't half-bad, similar to your average mass-produced American lager."
"Had this straight out of the 40, as God intended. It was a very light gold colour. I can't say anything about the head, obviously. The smell was sort of a nauseating sweet malt with some corn. The taste was the same, but with a twist. There were hops in this beer! I could clearly taste a slight piney flavour. Except it was real cheap and accentuated by the sweetness of the corn in such a way that it was more like Pine Sol. It was gross. Those piney-flavoured hops have no place in a malt liquor. As a result, this is now among my least favourite malt liquors and the worst 40 I've had so far. Oh well. At least now I know. I guess there's a reason this doesn't get sold anywhere near me. Sorry Lando, I'm sticking with Olde English."
"PS - Do not let this get at all warm."
"Horrible."
"Value: Even for the price it pretty much sucks. Hmmm who can I give the other three of these to?"
"D: My favorite malt liquor, but after this review I realize that thinking too much about malt liquor isn't just some harmless exercise in irony--it ruins the beer, wastes your time. Please learn from my mistakes."
"So I think this is an B+ malt liquor but can I really give a malt liquor beer an B+? Yes."
"The first 40 I ever had. This beer is lightly golden in color mostly yellow. Not a bit of head retention after the pour. Grains and Malts on the nose. Not a lot of hops in the flavor or the aroma. I'm glad that I tried this, but I don't need to find this again."
"Not that bad, really. Without the big sugar (heh), this is pretty inoffensive. No skank, or alcohol edge - a hell of an option for getting your advanced buzz on for a mere fiver (or 'Laurier bleu', north of the 49th)..."
" I personally drink this a few times a week, it ""works every time"" as the slogan indicates, and I've never gotten sick of it."
"Goodly amount of head, about two fingers of white, thick foam. Good clinging lace, nice pattern. Color is a 3 on the SRM beer color chart. So clear I think I could spear a shark in 40 fathoms of this stuff. Smell is that of wet straw and barley. Taste is not much of anything initially, but the after taste is sweet malt. Mouthfeel is nothing special, about one step above water. Nothing really stands out as good in this beer, but nothing that turns my stomach either. Cheep, drinkable, available, good yard work or attic exploring beer."
"Feel is a bit thin even with the creamy nature. Offers a bit of orange citrus on the finish followed by a slightly drying nature. A pumped up PBR? Not sure, but seems to share some roots. I prefer the dryer nature of the original."
"this is a smooth one, with no harsh mouthfeel, although there is a slight sour aftertaste that lingers a minute. very drinkable. I could see downing a few 40's of this on a humid summer night after toiling in the yard."
"Wow... How could a beer be bad in every way possible? Easy answer: It is consumed in mass quantities in the ghetto. This beer is outright horrible.. disgusting taste, bad smell, disturbing color.... I honestly cannot think of a nice thing to say here..."
"I got a finger of fizzy bone-white head that was determined to dissipate its way out of existence. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. I could see into the future and it looked kinda cold and bleak. That's what I get for indulging in this stuff. The nose smelled like the interior of a silo. Fermented grain, corn cobs and other slop left to ferment in the hot summer sun to be strewn before barnyard animals. Yum! The taste was actually better than the smell. It had a dry, cotton-candy-like sweetness thanks to their genius at biochemistry in developing a yeast strain that rips through fermentable sugars leaving only alcohol in its wake. No, really, it was bone dry but the residual sugars gave it a slight sweetness. It was pretty much the same ol', same ol'. Mouthfeel was fizzy on the tongue. Not too bad if you want a palate cleanser before moving on to something better. Finish was gaspingly dry. Again, it might be nice as a warm-up or a palate-cleanser before drinking something else."
"D= the taste is a deterent but while sitting around with the boys I could have one."
"overall i give this beer a C based on every beer i have tried so far, based on me being a cheap bastard though i'd give it a B - not much you can find better for the price."
"There are other cheep malt liquors I'd much rather drink on those days where I'm digging for change beneath the seats of my car."
"Very watery in the mouth with some alcohol sting, not much more but could be worse. This was a hard beer to drink and I could feel a head ache coming. Rather than waste it, I split it with a friend. Glad I tried it but I will stay clear of the style in the future."
"Golden and clear with lots of carbonation. Filmy cap with a touch of lace. A ton of corn and nonsense in the nose. The taste is thin and corn addled but not abusive to the tongue or stomach like some malt liquors. More drinkable than most malt liquor or even ice beer. Colt .45, gets um every time..."
"Drinks good. Not the worst beer out there."
"Overall all I can say is not for me. It is going to be a fun couple weeks as I take a turn away from the rare and big guns and try and knock out this list of grocery store staples."
"D: Billy Dee on the front of the 40 oz can't save this one, but if you're thirsty, it does the job."
"Appearance... it's a can, I'm not gonna contaminate any of my glassware with this stuff. Smell: not too much aroma coming out of the little pop-top hole. Mostly aluminum. Taste is also a lot of aluminum and some malty funk. Thin and watery. Pretty terrible all around, there's better stuff available at this rock bottom price point."
"Prob the best adjunct lager out there."
"As I said, I've had different experiences with Colt 45. I'm not impressed with the bottle I'm currently drinking. I may have started with a bottle that was too warm. Remember, in the malt liquor world, colder is better."
"D: just as easy to drink as it is to drain pour, feel like it needs to be in a brown bag."
"Light to medium bodied, low carbonation, nothing to write home about. This was left over after a get together. I wonder why?"
"D- It is what it is, and if one is to consume ""party beer," this is actually not the worst thing out there."
"A quick 40oz drink that will do the trick. Thats it. :D"
"Expectations are a bitch, but this was honestly better than I'd anticipated. Pretty easy-drinking & nothing overtly offensive. Granted, I have no plans of finishing the entire 40, but I can imagine there are worse malt liquors out there."
"D - Could not finish my 24oz can. Just to sweet and messy."
"Feel is light, airy and slightly tingly, though I'm not sure where those tingles are coming from. Average feel for a below average brew. Drinkability is only average if this is served at the proper temperature, ice cold."
"I could of had a Mickey's! It was right next to it. Living the dream to be sure, though."
"D - I have had many a malt liquor over the years. Tonight my buddy had a 4-pack at a street party, so I indulged. I think this is lesser than Haffenreffer or Crazy Horse (RIP), but way better than OE800, Mickey's, St. Ides, etc. The main problem, in my view, (aside from mediocre taste) is that it is disagreeable to the digestive system."
"Colt 45 is a very clear, very sparkling, pale golden lager with a thin, soft, foamy, white head that slowly fades and leaves decent lacing. It has a corny, slightly sweet, aroma with notes of corn, funk and maybe lemon. It's medium-light bodied and tinny with a starchy, papery finish. It's slightly sweet and doesn't really have any bitterness. It tastes like beer breath. Fusel is detected. It's almost tolerable. It works, but not every time."
"RJT"
"D - drinks a bit better than most malt liquors."
"I'm not sure what you're expecting from a malt liquor, but this is light and yet very malt. No off flavors at all. If you're in the mood for a simple American macro beer, this is actually very very good. The high ABV and big malt really shine compared to Bud or Miller, etc. For what it is, I really like it."
"either way I recommend it."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"I guess a forty ounce counts as a bottle. There isn't much to say about this one. Poured a light yellow, fizzy head that didn't last long. Kind of smells and tastes like old corn, best consumed as close to frozen as possible and as fast as possible. The only reason to pick this over other malt liquors is because Lando Calrissian was in the commercials for it in the 80's."
"As my partner in crime mimicked my actions, we strolled towards the gym, pausing only at a trash receptacle to dispose of the evidence. It was at this time we vowed to never repeat these deeds. At least, not until next Tuesday."
"Overall it's not very good. But I was expecting a disaster, and this beer beat my expectations."
"Poured out of a 16 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. I doubt Jim Koch had this swill in mind when they designed this glass, but it will certainly be classier than a brown paper sack. Color is straw yellow with no head. I wouldn't describe the beer has hazy, but it gives the appearance that your glass has a film covering it. Smells sweet and skunked. Taste is surprisingly not hateful. It's sweet for sure, but the skunky smell doesn't show itself too bad in the taste. Hops is not really discernable, but there is a bitter note that lets you know it's there. I can't believe I used to knock these back in the 45oz. size in college on certain (ie. brown bag night) occasions."
"This isn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I see the abv isn't outrageous so the huge dump of sugars to get the alcohol up there, like in many Malt Liquors, wasn't the route taken with this one. A 12oz sample would suit me better but the 24oz isn't the greatest chore I've ever put myself through. Bottom line, it's ok but it'll probably be years before I visit it again. ;^) I'm more of Mickey's Fine Malt Liquor fan..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - Icky and I could not get past a few ounces."
"Lando Calrissian."
"No, Colt .45 doesn't taste too good: I really couldn't perceive anything but a slightly malty-metallic taste, with no nose. It is cheap, fairly drinkable, and once had Billy Dee Williams as a spokesman. I mean, no, it's not great, but not entirely nasty, so... at 6 %, what the f@$!?"
"If you're looking for a buzz on the cheap, this is a good choice. Not horrible tasting but certainly nothing I'd offer to guests at my house. Has the noticable ""alcohol"" flavor of a cheap malt liquor but C-45 is not as ""harsh"" as the others. You can actually get one down. I'd recommend it as a good choice before a cheap rock concert, a late season football game or before an event as a ""pre-game"" so you don't have to spend too much on booze in the venue. Gives you a rockin' buzz but don't over-do it! Serve this swill ICE COLD!!!!"
"On with the review! So, I just moved to South Carolina from Upstate NY. I went to my local Kroger to purchase some cheep beer. To my surprise NO 40s! only Quarts. 1.32$ AN unbeatable price. I got home and opened it. The smell was different than it normally has. The colt 45 funk was not there but replaced with a sour smell almost like aluminum can and garbage. I was horrified. I drank half and I was done. The reason I gave it a 5 in drink-ability is because I can drink a lot of colt 45. This is the king of session beers. When ever I go out for a night on the town It's a colt 45 pregame party.I'm still looking for ""the holy grail"" 15/12oz cans(15 pack?) that no one seems to ever have in there stores. In the meantime I will pray to the beer gods that someday i will find it and drink every single one."
"End of the bottle...recommend to drink it cold and fast. Now I wanna put on a white sleeveless shirt and teach my wife's cat a lesson in R-E-S-P-E-C-T... come ere kitty...you ain't gonna dis' me no more..."
"While I'm certainly not going to start sucking back Colt 45 every weekend, I actually think I might buy it again. It'll get a few laughs from the friends, and it'll go down nice and smooth."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's one of the better Malt Liquors that I've had and even though it's not the stronger one out there, it's still a cost-efficient way to get a buzz going, which is what this kind of beer is intended for."
"D= the taste is a deterent but while sitting around with the boys I could have one."
"Cheers!"
"The mouth on this was a tad better than the Miller I just consumed. A smidge more carbonation playing on the tongue. A smidge... This beer has a bit more flavor and, dare I say, bite? Some sweet malts come through, but not enough. The cheap husky grains are the main player. This will do at a softball game or something, but otherwise, this will not be a regular in my drinking plans."
"Poured from a clear bottle into a weizen glass. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Mild malt smell, not much aroma. Taste is slightly malty, mostly bland. O.k feel in mouth and drinkability is average. A good beer to get wasted with, otherwise not so great."
"Not going to win any awards, but good in a pinch. Drink ice cold and quickly, though."
"I got to say I still prefer this beer out of intended glassware. The bottle and a paper bag. The paperbag shields you from the contents. The aroma is kicked up because I cant smell it. The taste is still corn grain. The balancing bitterness comes from that charcoal filtered flavor. Mouthfeel the carbonation is a bit more present but this may only be because how fast I am drinking this beer. Drinkability is improved from the bottle. In short I highly reccomend this buzz beer from the bottle ice cold and drank as fast as you can."
"Clear golden with a soft fluffy white head that leaves trace lacing behind. Smells of grits and slightly soapy. Tastes sweet and corny with cereal grains and a little bit of alcohol on the back end. Medium bodied with fizzy carbonation. I always thought this was a lot stronger that 6.1% ABV in my younger days when me and my friends would choke down 40 oz. bottles of Colt with reckless abandon, a pretty average malt."
"D- It is what it is. A cheap malt liquor that is meant to be had in large amounts. Not the best tasting brew, but goes down pretty easy."
"After returning for some god awful reason to this hell hole of brews I realize my first impressions were not so accurate as I would like them to be. Let me be honest, the bottle itself scares me. My dad used to store pre-mixed weed killer in these bottles when I was a kid...and guess what it was the same color as the stuff in this unopened bottle of C45. The color is by far the worst part of this beer, especially in the bottle. The nose was a bit less offensive but still nothing to get exited about. The taste however is surprising in that it is not too far from many macro lagers especially the ""Ice"" versions (eg. Bud Ice, Keystone Ice, etc.) Mouthfeel is just nicely carbonated and light and the only reason the drinkability isn't higher on my ratings is because after a few 40's your out of the game for a while."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Had once before and it's not anywhere as bad as I remembered! This Malt is smooth, and easy drinking. Has allot more flavor with a little more alcohol than say, King Cobra. Pretty easy to consume as much as you wanted. Not bad, with only very minor flavors that may be offensive to one, as it warms. I definitely will be buying again, I liked it! I recommend you give it a try. Cheers!"
"D- Okay. Not as bad as I thought but not worthy."
"Conclusion: It's a drinkable malt-liquor when it's $.75 at happy hour and you've never tried it before....that's about it."
"Well if you're gonna pick up a few of these then you must already have low expectations. We bought these as a joke. We spent the night listening to old school gangsta rap and downed a few forties. The taste sucked, but the atmosphere was spot on. Tastes really cheap. The alcohol shows through and not in a good way. It was really foamy and and light in color. It was like natty light and sprite mixed together. t goes without saying that this is a bad call for humanity."
"While Colt 45 may not win many awards it has one at least one, the key, to my heart. Nothing high class by any means, but if you're hanging around with a couple friends looking just to goof around or dirt poor, living on ramen noodles, pretending you're not in you're apartment to avoid bill collectors since there's no money even though I am since I have no where else to go-YOU! I mean, you have no where else to go. Anyhow, what I mean is it's a decent, cheap malt liquor to get you by and a solid choice for college or chilling around on the cheap with some friends."
"Alright this is gonna be reviewed, according to style here. This is MALT LIQUOR, so it needs to reviewed in the realm of malt liquor. Anyway, pours that coppery color with decent head, i didnt pour all of it into a glass, so i dont know about head retention, and besides, who cares? When its a malt. Smell is fruity, boozy, adjuncty, could of been hidden better for 7%. Taste is great for a malt, its my 3rd favorite malt, so its just slighty above average. Goes down kind of rough, finishes sweet and boozy. Not bad. Mouthfeel, full and sticky. After a 710 ml can the next one is easy, so drinkability is solid. Keep swillin."
"That's right katz & kittenz, it was malt liquor night at my house again! Out of a 22oz. bottle this beer was a clear gold color with a moderate amount of rising carbonation. The aroma was of semi-sweet malt with some light floral notes on grain mash - much better than I expected! The flavors, however, were about what I was thinking. It was very dry, dominated by doughy malt and some grain mash. Acidic. The mouthfeel was semi-rough, the body medium and the carbonation medium/high. Not bas, as far as they go!"
"Enjoying this after a Rainier Ale. No bad attributes whatsoever. In the lower abv range of MLs this is perfection. Get some, now."
"This was poured out a 40 fl. oz. bottle marked 03099-F51136. I picked up one of these 40 ouncers to watch the Wild Card playoffs. I figured I'd milk it for the rest of the day. It pours pale yellow with a whole lot of fizzy white head and actually a little bit of lacing. It smells metallic and looks like most cheap American pales although the taste ends slightly dry. It leaves an after taste and a headache. Eh, nothing special here but it is really, really cheap."
"Pours a pale yellow with a 1/4 inch head, but poor retention. Slight lacing throughout. Smells of a lager with secondary maltiness. Fits the style well enough. Slightly sweet flavor consisting mostly of cleanliness of a lager with some sweet malt. Average carbonation and a crisp body. Not real bad, a little kick with the higher abv."
"The taste and smell are putrid. Mouthfeel is nothing impressive and I can't even tell you about drinkablility. Does it even matter? Aren't you suppose to slam these anyways? Colt 45 is like an on going joke with me and my friends. But given the right situation and mood, I'd still to this day take that 40 down."
"Colt 45 Malt Liquor pours a pale yellow with a fluffy white head from a sixteen ounce can. There's not much going on in the aroma, a bit of sweet malt is noticeable. There isn't much going on in the flavor either, a bit of sweet malt, a bit of grain that's about it. Not as offensive as I remembered it."
"For some reason this reminds me a little of iced tea and is about as drinkable. One of my old high school staples, so it deserves some props for that. It isn't something I would drink today, however, I might break a forty or two out for a night out with some old high school buddies."
"This stuff doesn't drink too bad. At least I'm not disgusted like I would be with a Bud Light or something."
"I am pleasantly surprised by Colt 45. Though it's been years since I've had it, I've never approached it with a critical eye. It's better than a lot of American macros, and the ABV, while somewhat low for the style, is well hidden in both the aroma and the flavor."
"Some might debate whether the Rogue offering shouldn't take home the prize because it is craft beer. Hey, the name of this invite is Brown Paper Bag, which conjures malt liquor, and the Rogue offering is that. If you don't like it, do your own. Well, time to wrap this up (no pun intended), thanks for watching the Brown Paper Bag Invitational. Good night everyone!"
"This is a malt liquor that is cheap and gets the job done."
"Light-bodied with good carbonation. If I couldn't smell or taste it, I could drink Colt 45 all day long."
"I could drink this in a smaller increment but a 40 is way too much. Having said that, for what it is, it really isn't horrible. When it's cold, that is, which means you have about 5 minutes to choke down whatever's in your glass."
"My beverage of preference? Colt 45."
"Oh boy... Golden color topped with a white head that fizzles away. Just go ahead and brown bag it and drink from the bottle. Tastes very musty with dust particles, corn and low grade malts. There's decent amount of alcohol in this, especially for the price, but you won't see me getting near this one. Awful."
"This one was made in Canada with an 8%abv,lite pale yellow with small white head and thin lacing.Nose was corn,skunk,some rice maybe and the high alcohol faintly coming thru,Tasted like mashed corn,with some hints of sweets and musty with the alcohol taste finishing off and lingering in the background,medium mouthfeel that left you waiting a while before you really wanted to glug some more,not to my liking."
"bought a forty of this the other day. when i was younger i would buy this from time to time and it wasn't terrible like other malt liquors i've had. but i had to reassure myself so i turned on Afroman and drank my colt 45. i was pretty pleased with my purchase. it does leave a strange coating in your mouth but it quickly disappears. easy to drink and it gets you drunk what more can you ask for"
"corny, peppery-fuselly, cidery orchard-fruit aroma. alcoholic. cideriness increases with temperature. no perceivable hop aroma. brilliantly clear, golden-yellow, swiftly-disappearing fine white head. flavour dominated by cidery flavours. opens up to a grainy, dms-laden adjunct flavour. insufficient bittering to carry the alcohol. light, dry, slick mouthfeel. gets foul and chemically in the finish - the fusels and the acetylaldehyde create a nasty flavour as it ends. If I were a 14-yr-old on the street, this would be my choice. UPDATE: As it warmed (it's now the serving temperature for real beer) it ended up getting unbearably fuselly and harsh, which with the acetyl flavours was just thin and vile."
"Poured a light urine. Aroma of corn and nothing. The taste is sick and corny malt dick with no hops. The flavor kind of leaves me queasy. Its not quite of chemicals but its nasty. Feel is lightly crisped from the carbonation. Not drinkable unless you are a crackhead that needs a cheap buzz. SICK."
"Drinkability is okay if you're in a pinch or you feel like going cheap. Otherwise, save the money for a much more fulfilling beer."
"D: Gimme nother fortee!"
"Poured this beer into my ""United We Stand"" pint glass. This beer pours a clear straw yellow with just a hint of carbonation that foams up but has no head retention at all. The smell is sweet corn syrup and that's about all. The taste is clean and adjunct-y. The mouthfeel is clean, and crisp with just a hint of booze that is normally really prevalent in cheap malt liquors. This would be a really easy summer drinking brew. Give it to me on a float trip any day."
""
"Apperance, yellow, with some carbonation that quickly disapates. There are smells of grains, corn, alcohol and some sugar. Not that bad of a tastes, not to strong on the alcohol. Good taste for a malt liqour. Sort of like Pabst with a little more alcohol to it. The mouthfeel is dry and not that bad, but thin all around. Finally the drinkability is good if you are into malt liquors. Probably the best one out of all the malts out there."
"The taste is quite sweet with a strong corn tortilla taste, a definite but not unpleasant alcoholic quality, and a warm, alcoholic, corn finish that has a light bite. It has almost no bitterness and in the end gets somewhat watery with a light soapy quality but is otherwise inoffensive."
"This is okay and as ususal, similar to other malt liquors. It's yellow and bubbly with a white. The aroma is of syrupy grains, corn and some alcohol. The taste is again syrupy with a lot of grain and alcohol. This is some rough stuff. Thick full body. Cheap and does the trick I guess."
"Eric"
"D: Drinkability was fair and actually not bad at one, at two became predictable, and at three showed its true macro colors and became a little bit of a struggle to enjoy its flavor. A 40oz bottle was sampled."
"40oz bottle white elephant gift. Gee, thanks. Unsightly clear yellowish color with a thin and fizzy white head with little retention. Minimal lacing. Aroma of corn, hay, and grain. Light body with a vegetal character. More corn and other farm-related flavors. The finish is an adjunct-ridden mess of corn and maybe some malt and/or hops. The only thing about Colt 45 I can see working every time is reminding people to appreciate the good beers they can buy instead of this stuff."
"Take it for what it is worth."
"What's not to love?"
"I would like to thank my coworker for taking me out for a drink. Of course, he and I have polar opposite views on beer, so when he told me he got some ""good shit"" to drink I should've expected this. I drank these once in a while, and some people think they're the worst 40s ever, but I think for a buck they're not too bad. Pale gold color that you can see right through, not much in the nose except alcohol, syrupy, mellow taste that doesn't leave too much backwash. Needless to say, I only had one."
"D- Ill drink these again, but not on a regular basis. Couldnt do a all nighter with these. Sometimes im in the mood for the malt taste."
"Drinkability:Dont even go there I almost puked after a glass of this"
"While in college, this was the cheapest 40 oz. I could find... tastes like straight-up gasoline... Would not recommend this beer unless you were trying to get wasted for under $3.50.... Horrible gasoline-oil taste becomes nauseating after a while.... Although, if you can force down the first one, the rest go down a bit easier... Cheap, ghetto, strong malt liquor that should be avoided at all costs... Somehwat attractive when you're living off $50 a week... Unless you lack dignity and taste buds, ignore this ""beer"" that might as well have been brewed by Exxon..."
"A ""two four"" of Colt 45 bought at the local liqour store for a dollar and change. Poured a bit into a small glass. Light yellow with minimal head that reduces to almost nothing, just some wispiness. Light corn and alcohol in the smell, mellow. Taste is on the mellow end as well. Sweet corn/malt and a touch of alcohol. Thankfully no harsh solvency. This really isn't that bad as far as malt liqours go though I couldn't imagine drinking this on a regular basis. Try to tame the Colt for yourself."
"D: An OK malt liquor, but the taste got boring after a while, and monotonous. It was cool to taste the beer that Lando Calrissian pitched in the late '70s, and early '80s, but I don't think I'll be buying this again."
"Not nearly good, but not undrinkable."
"24oz can. Pours a clear very pale yellow with a huge rocky persistant head. Aroma is weak. Corn and grassy. Taste is slightly sweet with a hint of grassy hops. A bit watery mouthfeel but you wouldn't want this to be very heavy. Pretty drinkable. When you rate this for the style, this is a decent malt liqour."
"After drinking a 40oz of this, the review is hard to write, but I will give it a shot anyways. for $2.50, this is a hard bargain to beat. I expected this to taste like total ass, however it's not too shabby, better than bud in most respects, but not as good as the miller high life (which has a special place in my heart (i.e. cheap college heart)) It looks a boring straw yellow but a little darker, and smells like crap but the taste is surprisingly standable, some what sweet and chuggable if you really need to get drunk (which is probably the only reason you are having this). Drinkability is pretty high, there is alot of kick in this 40 and damn i feel it.Better stick this one in the freezer for a while before drinking, makes it 10x better. This is one of the best drinks to get drunk on, obviously it's main purpose."
"Comes in the badass 40oz size. Pours a light yellow color with some decent foam and lacing. Aroma is strong, much like a typical malt liquor. Smooth and as someone mentioned, I would agree to it being PBR on steroids. Taste is very smooth and somewhat sweet. Malty/corny flavors. Not offensive at all. Goes down smooth. Cheap. It's got the hallmarks of a malt liquor. What more could anyone expect?"
"D - Excellent! A great cheapo beer that is far superior to other malt liquors. This is the one ghetto beer that I actually enjoy. Maybe our grandpas had it better than I thought!"
"Honestly, this beer does what it was designed to do. It has easy drinkability with a decent taste. This combined with a decent alcohol level gives the drinker exaclty what they expected."
"Cheers!"
"Colt 45 is, ice cold, hands down the best forty you'll ever drink. This is sort of like saying that Jenny McCarthy is more appealing than Pamela Anderson, or that Arby's is better than McDonalds. While all true statements, at that point, it's really all a matter of style. To me, this is Lando's drink. Sorry Tupac; Ides is nice and all, but you'd never helped saved Han from Carbonite. Slightly less of a guilty pleasure, summer day, tailgating, letting it all hang out brew than High Life, but in the same ballpark. And there's not a damned thing wrong with that."
"The finishing taste of it is weird. But other than that the buzz was great."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Thin head that fades after a minute; highly carbonated and looks better than most malt liquors poured into a pilsner glass. Smells like wet bud light in a paper bag. Doesn't taste too bad, actually tastes like some of the macro beers that cost a bit more. Mouthfeel isn't so good, tastes like a malt-liquor, though not as bad as Steel Reserve. Isn't so bad to drink. Probably one of the better malt-liquors."
"Pours like malt liquor, clear amber/gold, small soapy white head, goes fast, some lace spots, not much, average. Smell is sweet and corny, some vegetables, bit of alcohol, not much going on. Taste is very sweet, some corny vegetal flavour, caramel, alcohol, pretty smooth. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Pretty average."
"D - Much better than other malts. I could actually finish it without regreting it."
"I would recommend this beer to those who like Malt liquors and enjoy the bitter sweet intoxication."
"16 oz. can - color of clear bright yellow , with a white medium head - nose of aluminum can , banana , sweet corn , and hay  taste of sweet corn hay , skunk , hopps , and metal - body light , and semi sweet  aftertaste of slight caramel , and light hopps"
"Poured from a 40 oz bottle....gee, maybe I could get a 6 pack of this stuff sometime...the pour foamed up pretty well, smell was allright thought it might be good afterall. Had a pretty decent flavor at first, could taste a full flavored mouth of adjuncts. On the downside I found hardly any carbonation, hop flavor or finish to add....quite honestly the aftertaste tasted like sinus/sinus drainage. Probably the only bottle of beer I've never finished, I had to throw this stuff out or I think I would have gotten sick. I wouldn't recommend it, and it's supposed to be a pretty good malt..I will be staying away from this category for sure."
"Drink-Ability: its okay as long as your 40's really cold the moment it starts to warm up it taste really bad. Also a great beer if you just want to get trashed quickly and cheaply but certainly a poor mans beer."
"It seems absurd to review this in the normal format though: Appearance was piss yellow, no lacing, poor retention. Smells like corn. Tastes like bitter, alcoholic corn. That said, it goes down easily enough, especially when cold. Wouldn't want to attempt the feat when it's just cool. Mouthfeel a little slick, but carbonation is good. As far as malt liquor goes, it gets a lot worse than this one here. Taking style into account, it's not bad. Overall, yes it is."
"Final Statement: Everyone should drink one of these at one point in their lives. I drank 2... and maybe I will again, who knows."
"D - It is alright. It is of course nothing to look forward to, but it does go down fairly easy. I imagine that the clear bottle would be vastly inferior to the can."
"It's 100 degrees outside. I have a ice cold colt 45 and life isn't so bad. It is a typical cheap malt liquor, but it is refreshing on a hot day and packs a good buzz for the price. Pour one for your dead homies and keep a couple for yourself. Sure you could be drinking a good Pilsener, but sometimes it's ok to be ghetto."
"This malt liquor is horrid. The stuff looks like a concentrated Budweiser with a healthy dose of horse or cow urine. It smells like fermented infection juice. The delicate flavor is that of gasoline and rotting corn. If youve ever wondered what a chemical cocktail would taste like 3 months past its born-on date, this stuff is it. Enjoy!"
"I guess the idea behind this beer and most malt liquors, is to drink it cold as possible and as fast as possible for ultimate enjoyment."
" Bottom line: Just not reccomended, unless your a fan of malt liquor which I am not."
"The beer pours a very bright gold. A thin, fluffy head sits atop the beer. It looks like an N/A. The smell is worse. All I can smell is adjunct sweetness. The taste proves that the smell is not a lie. The only taste is a very musty, sweet one. The mouthfeel is okay, until it gets to the back of my tounge, where it turns into battery acid. It is to sweet to really pound down or drink casually."
"This is an ""okay"" malt I should add I use that word lightly. The appearance is pretty decent nothing to bad. The smell isnt good. The taste is sub par. The mouth feel is okay. Ive drank this several times, but it has never been very easy to drink it in more than small sips because honestly it makes me sick to take large swigs. Overall a great hobo drink/ I want to get crunk beer."
"Appearance: Light clear pale golden hue with a bright white eggshell colored head leaves nice even lacing...somehow it's doesn't look too unappetizing. Aroma: Cereal grains light toasted pale malts with heavy corn and rice providing some evident sweetness influences touch of alcohol. Taste: Well...this is where it gets harsh...this one's definitely for my homies. Corn husk offness slightly metallic adjunct ridden in the worst way no hop flavor brings out just a bit of my gag reflex is it worth the 24 oz 99 cent offering to drink this beer. Mouthfeel: Is light bodied... a bit thicker than the typical mass produced lager a bit of residual sugars. Drinkability: Well no don't drink alot of this or a little in multiple sittings not good beer even for a malt liquor."
"Had a bbq today, one of my bastard friends thought it was funny to bring this, fortunately my other bastard friend brought an Old Crustacean bottle. On to this mess though. Cracked it open, made an obligatory Lando remark due to past marketing. Typical yellow, but not clear, more of a golden straw, very foamy. Smells of stale corn flakes and carbonation. Tastes artificial, tastes corny, tastes, bad. It was hard to drink, I couldn't get through much of this can, the big two four beat me."
"Why did I feel so dirty buying this?"
"From a small wine glass the appearance was a light yellow color with abundant bubbles. The aroma was lacking. It smelled of rotting silage. The first sip was mild. It tasted like a light tonic with a hint of corn. On the second sip, I swirled it around in my mouth and it reminded me of a hot summer day. I slowly finished the first glass and poured a second glass. The second glass seemed better than the first glass. My nerve endings were dulled and the more I drank or this, the more I wanted to drink ----> I'm not sure why. Maybe there is an additive in Colt 45 that makes it addictive... Anyone know?"
"Macros, gotta love them. Pale yellow pour. Smells like water. Tastes like water, these beers challenge you to find the flavor. There is very little, some sweet graininess but that is it. It's yellow carbonated water. Mouthfeel is like carbonated water. Very drinkable but it's completly mindless. Oh well it's good for low budget beer drinkers."
"Drinkabitity: Like I said. After jack hammering all day or paving a long driveway on a hot day this is the way to go. Or perhaps drink a few before that 4th of July softball game that no one cares who wins or who gets hurt."
"A semifinalist in Maltliquorpalooza 2006. This was a fairly smooth drinking ML with no gag-inducing qualities....save the distinct odor of tuna fish. Yeah, i just really dont want my beer to smell like tuna. Dont get me wrong, i like tuna on a sandwich or in sushi, but keep it away from beer. Lost to Olde English in our tournament."
"Orange-amber liquid pours into a pint glass with an ample white head (vigorous pour!) that fades quickly. Smell of malt and rice and corn, with a bit of hops. Not intense by any means. Flavor is surpisingly full, but not very complex. Mostly rice and corn, adjunct alcohol that leaves a medicinal taste. Fairly decent mouthfeel. This is a lot of alcohol for not much money."
"Crystal clear 10K gold toped with a huge bright white head of small and medium bubbles that slowly settles like meringue leaving moderate lacing. Eventually it reduces itself to a modest cap. A few lazy carbonation streams rise to the surface. The smell is crisp and corn husk and rice are prominent. There is a sticky sweetness about it. The taste is sweet and slightly bitter, but distinctly adjunct laced with corn and rice dominant. Alcohol notes are present, but not dominant, being masked by an almost cloying sweetness. Light body, with a fuzzy, bouncing carbonation. Overly sweet."
"Pours out a pale straw yellow. Very clear, a little carbonation and a nice fizzy white head that disappears pretty quickly to a tiny colar, though it sticks a little to the glass.. Smells sweet and malty. Surprisingly sugary and sweet. A touch of hops in the nose. It just reminds me of a generic macro. A little bit maltier, but it also has a strange tartness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little grainy and a little more full than I'd like in this type of beer...it just makes it a little less drinkable than I'd like. This is undrinkable. I poured it out after like 6 ounces. Just crap."
"Poured a pale yellow color with very large white puffy head that almost immediately disappeared. Smell is very minimal, with only a slight sweetish note to be found. Taste is mostly sweet, and any hops present are minimal. Finishes with little taste, but is refreshing. An average beer."
"Drinkability - Smooth, which makes this more dangerous than it looks. I was on my second glass before I even realized I had drank that much. For a party, definitley recommended."
"Still- even cheap beers can harbor good memories- it says G. Heileman Brewing, reminding me of my dad's howmetown in La Crosse."
"Malty/sugar type taste with some grain. this one doesn't get as syrupy as most do when they warm up. It held its composition well. If this was a couple notches higher in Abv i'd be impressed but at 6.1 its decent. It is what it is and they do a decent job at it."
"Appearance is this orange color. doesn't really look too appetizing. it smells horrible, like alcohol and something metallic i can't really describe, surprisingly however it really doesn't taste that bad, has this ""Warming"" sensation while you drink it. Aftertaste is unique, a lot better than i remember it being in my younger years. This is pretty drinkable, and a good choice for cold weather (warms you up) and hits you quick. For a cheap brew i would likely go for this again."
"Again, Colt 45 40's night: Worst idea ever."
"This is okay beer if your expectation meter is set on 'rock bottom'. If one is in need of a drinkable, remarkably inexpensive beer with a kick, one could do much worse than an ice cold can or three of Colt 45. The edge has to go to the Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull, but it's a nose at the wire rather than a runaway."
"Pours a pale yellow with a 60 second, three finger head. Slight lacing. Smells pretty bland for a malt liquor. Taste is a little grainy, a little malty. Better taste than you average malt liquor; also smoother than some american macros.This is a beer that tastes more like an american macro, in a less harsh malt liquor. Kudos to Pabst, champions of good cheap beer."
"Its Colt 45. This stuff is a good malt liquor if you get it fresh enough, I would compare it to a slightly stronger, slightly drier High Life. Nice to whack back a couple 22ozs on a hot summer day. It has a slightly metallic character that doesn't really get in the way of its poundability. Drink one or die."
"thanks to Larry Bell, for inspiring the quote, however inadvertently..."
"This beer has 2 things going for it: Billy Dee is one baddass mofo, and PBR is one badass can of pisswater. Aside from that, this stuff ain't worth the 99 cents. If you want to feel like a pimp, then go ahead and make the investment, but if you are looking to enjoy what you are drinking, then don't bother."
"This malt liquor has a dark bronze color to it with a nice study white head. I get a sweet corn husk aroma along with what I detect to be hops, could it be? Taste has that corn syrup malt liquor sweetness, but its not overly sick like some. There might actually be some hop flavor in here leveling this beer out. Finish is dry and lingering in alcohol. Drink cold like all malt liquors but this was more enjoyable than most. Not bad at all, seriously."
" Minimal head, average carbonation. Has a distinct raw alcohol finish. Easy to drink while still cold although as it warmed slightly, I didn't find it offensive at all. I can see having one of these during a fight night on TV with some pork rinds. Not bad."
"Got this baby on a whim the night before my highland games comp in Sumter, SC. Figured it would be overly sweet and clingy with a thick taste. but actually turned out to be rather smooth. Definately had the corn taste to it, but also had some maltiness and a little tiny bit of hops. Very clean taste, left no nasty aftertaste on the palate. Believe it or not, this BA kind of enjoied it. I'd say go for it, if your into malt liquors and big bottles of cheap beer. Lord knows it's got the right price."
"If you thought you were picking up something classy, and came home with Colt 45, you will be disappointed"
"Had one of these last night, and it was sure a trip in time back to 3 years ago, where i discovered the concept of a 40. Anyways. Clear glass bottle, didn't bother to pur it, it's a 40, afterall. Clear medium gold color, lots of carbonation. Smell is grainy and corny, not much of an appealing malt or a hops presence at all. Take an american macro, make it skunkier and less palatable, and then you have colt 45. Pretty bad, but will give you a buzz. My head still hurts."
"I thought I would drink some of the american big breweries beer the stuff america was brought up on, plus I need to save money. poured yellow big white head.aroma malty citrus skunky. flavor none.the oly good thing about this beer is the big white head the the lacing.the only way to drink this is ice cold and fast on a hot day"
"Overall-after tasting this there is no point to buy Bud Ice or Natty Ice, Colt 45 is much smoother and more drinkable. Granted it isn't a top notch beer by any means, but in the drink quick and cheap to get drunk category I don't think you could do much better."
"mmm-mmm good. This beer has magical properties when consumed properly from a 40oz container. There should be another column in the ratings for ""value"" this would get a 6.0. $1.99 for 40 ounces of malt liquor bliss. A malt liquor for the true connoisseurs."
"post-script: Im reviewing within the style here..."
"Drinkability - a good answer for beer on a budget, but it's boring for anything outside of a frat party, camping trip, or malt liquor swill-a-thon."
"Even when it comes to malt liquor in 40s, this stuff is just stupid to buy. If you absolutely NEED 40 ozs of high alcohol malt liquor, get Olde English or Mickeys. This stuff is almost undrinkable."
"5/10"
"I'm not drinking this again. I don't care how poor I am, There is no way I'm drinking this swill. Fo Shizzle."
"More drinkable than you would think, it beats a Budweiser."
"I really enjoyed this. It's better than every macro lager i've had - this is thicker, dirtier, and better. Kind of a rich, malty,semi-sweet cheerio taste with some power and a little bit of kick. The price is right- at under $2 for a 40. Smells like alchohol, but nothing too rank. I didn't pour, but it left a soapy film that slid down the sides of the bottle. Looks golden and dirty. Feels perfect on the tongue. Body and carbonation are just right. I will definitely buy this again- one of my favorite american lagers."
"This has to be one of the cheapest malt liqours available on the market today. Here in Virginia it only costs $1.49 for a bottle. That is a helluva great price to get trashed on. I drank three of these the other night, and i felt pretty good. The mouthfeel is pretty good for such a cheap malt liquor, very surprising. Definitely worth the money."
"Overall this is not bad, and is definitely drinkable....Better than some of the cheaper macros...I don't plan on buying it again, but I wouldn't rule it out..."
"I had to get me a 40 after a bad day at work. It was just how I remembered it ice cold out of the bottle nothings better. It has a nice beer like color to it, with a thick fluffy head. The smell was of dirty socks. The taste was like kind of ""bud"" with a terrible aftertaste not a bad malt liquor!!"
"Smells like napalm in the morning.... This is a truely offensive brew to the nasal passages, but if you're just looking for something to get a quick buzz off of or a gag, this is for you. Tried this in the traditional 40oz incarnation and I have to say I've had much worse. Deep gold hue with a grassy/corn taste to it. High in alcohol content so as Billy Dee Williams says ""It works every time"". If that's what you're going for. If you're on a budget, skip the Natural Light and all that crap and grab some of this... it actually has some taste and looks like real beer."
"Works every time."
"I seem to be getting alot of cheap beer lately. Fortunately, I haven't payed for any of them. When I first poured this out of the can, I learned an important lesson. Don't pour this outta the can. Drink straight from the can. Grainy colour, carbonated, no head. Smelled of alcohol, malt and corn. Tasted the same way, with a terrible aftertaste. Drinking from the can was a slight improvement, in that I didn't smell the beer as strongly. God awful brew for those only interested in a cheap buzz, something not even I got from this."
"This brew poured a small head of white medium sized bubbles that quickly disappeared leaving a carbonated weak light yellow body. It has that typical low quality rice beer aroma and a fizzy flavor. There is no real character to this gassy beverage. Burp!"
"24 oz. can. Oh yuck! Another American mass-produced beer. This beer poured a small white head with small-medium sized bubbles that quickly diminished. There was no lacing observed with this beer on the sides of my glass. There was carbonation observed rising to the top. It had a fruity nose."
"Macro with an attitude. Looks like macro, tastes like macro on steroids, and priced like macro. Everything but appearance is a bit below average. This has been around a long time and hasn't improved. This is really a good marketing effort of a fairly poor beer."
"Not a bad malt. Its got a decent flavor, but is better when it's icy cold. Had a strong smell of alcohol and malt, and was a bit on the bitter side. If i am going to drink a malt, it's gonna be this. I'd say to those who are not versed in malts to try this one first, as i think this one is as good as it gets."
"It is actually far better than I thought it would be. There is no head, no colour, no aroma, no hops but there is a smooth malt taste with a nice warming alcohol finish. I think the smoothness and the lack of the generic macro metallic bite makes this stuff quite drinkeable. It has quite a good body and the carbonation is quite soft(nice!). It is very easy to drink if you are not in the mood for thinking about what you are drinking."
"Light, pale golden hue, white head, smallish with minimal retention. Unpleasant nose sulfur, sweet, and hints of grain. First few sips are shocking to the palate rebounds grainy & gritty, malty, sweet, underlying notes of spiciness. Not very flavorful, but not bad, alcohol is somewhat noticeable, drinkable for a Malt Liquor Beer. It is cheap (22 oz. bottle for $1.40) but that still wont motivate me to purchase this again."
"Plus how can one go wrong when Billy D. Williams is the spokes man !"
"Colt 45 is a quaffable beverage, and probably considered a tame malt liquor. Easy to drink, and there's worse out there. No Colt 45 review is complete without giving props to Billy Dee, so: ""it works every time."""
"Conservatively priced at under $4.00 for a six pack, Colt 45 Malt Liquor will be there for you if the need should ever arise, ready willing and able to satisfy the most basic of needs for a beer."
"Clear golden color with lots of fat bubbles and a small white head, quite good lace for the style. The most notable characteristic of the aroma is a strong alcohol presence, though there is a decent malt aroma which is a bit overpowered by the alcohol fumes. Taste begins with aggressive, spritzy carbonation and alcohol flavors. Beneath the alcohol flavor there is a decent cracker malt presence and some hops and grain as well. Finish is dominated by sweet alcohol flavors and a touch of hop bitterness. Mouth feel is pretty good for this style. This beer is a standout in a category that does not get much respect from beer connoisseurs. It also offers very good value for its modest price. I'll certainly buy this one again."
"if you look close enough at my pic, that's me as a baby playing with a Colt 45 can. since i can't get this brew in F-M, i picked up a six pack while home over thanksgiving. this beer holds a special place in my heart, since there is a story my parents told me about Colt 45 and how i was conceived. lol...anyway, on to the review...it pours out pale straw with a nice big foamy head and all kinds of lace that sticks forever! the anticiapted adjunct aroma doesn't offend..it's even expected and welcome. a nice creamy mouthfeel is followed by a bit of alcohol afterbite. it tastes pretty good for a malt liquor, probably the best malt liquor you can buy even. goes down smooth and easy. a nice warming sensation is detected after a few of these (i got a sixer of 12 ouncers). a very good malt liquor."
"However, the taste is not bad....it isn't good either, but it is not bad. If a quick buzz is in your immediate forecast, this is the brew for you."
"12 oz. clear glass bottle with the ""Call me to Win!"" neck label that features a young hispanic or black woman. Classy! It pours a crystal clear straw gold body topped by a foamy bright white head that holds well. The aroma is lightly malty with a very light touch of hops. The body is medium with a standared carbonation that leaves it crisp in the mouth. The flavor is a well balanced, lightly sweet and grainy maltiness with an underlying bitterness and very limited hop flavor. It finishes dryish with a mild, lingering sweetness. This is less sweet and more balanced than many malt liquors on the market, although it doesn't seem as well brewed."
"Drinking this liquid from a paper bag, I feel like a rummy. The ""malt"" flavor is present, but drowned out by the overwhelming taste of bad alcohol. By bad alcohol, I mean a taste not unlike nail polish remover."
"Billy Dee says it is good, I will tried it again.  Pale straw with moderate head that lasts for a little while.  Sweet alcoholic tonic like aroma.  Beer is somewhat pedestrian with minimal hop bitterness and a full grainy mouthfeel from the use of corn and other veggies.  Finishes warm. But don't drink this warm."
"This is one of the few malt liquors I have tried.  A cheap 40oz favorite of a late friend(God rest his soul).  The color is bad, the smell is not any better and drinkablity should only be done quickly."
"I can't believe this was the first beer I ever drank. Ah, the good ole days of chugging 40's of the Colt, bought at the ghetto party store and brought out under cover of cardboard boxes.  What the hell were we thinking?  Upon revisiting this beer, it is apparent that Billy Dee was using this to get his wimmins buzzed and not himself.  Somewhat sweet, taste of burnt corn and nearly flat.  Peace out."
"It's cheap malt liquor. It will get you all f'd up. Just chug while its cold and get nicely tanked because that is definitely all you are looking for anyway. Am I wrong? I didn't think so."
"I can't help but chuckle when I think of this stuff. Somehow this always found it's way back from the store in the old days when we would pitch in for beer. Strictly for those looking for a quick, nasty buzz."
"A friend of mine always brings over a couple ""FOUR Os"" of this stuff as a gag ... funny thing is that we end up polishing the stuff off everytime."
"Never considered trying this, but a buddy bought several types of really cheap beer to see which was the best (in a relative sort of way)  He put tape around the cans to hide the ID (have we got too much time on our hands, or what?).  Moderate body with a mildly alcohol front, a firm middle and a moderate, non-hop bitter finish. Not all that bad.  I about fell out of my chair when he peeled the tape off (I would have fallen out the chair anyway after a couple more)."
