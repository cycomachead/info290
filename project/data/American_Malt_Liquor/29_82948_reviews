"This one is hard to rate, because it's more of a cocktail than a beer, but since this site is about beer here it goes. Pours a cloudy yellowish white color with absolutely no head.  Smells just like a margarita, which smells awesome, but as a beer no. Tastes like lime and salt and a little bitter going down. Like I said this ones tough because I do like this ""beer"" a lot, but it just doesn't fit any of the qualities of a beer."

"Overall (1.47) : This is like someone mixed King Cobra with lime soda and sugar. Yeah, that concoction would be a hit at parties and probably get you A+ status, but in a can from a large scale brewery? What an utter fail."

"Best out of the bunch although I still wasn't a fan. At least with the original there are some salt and real Margarita flavors instead of just a sugar overload. The appearance was greenish yellow with a smell of lime. The taste was sugary but more authentic than the other blank-a-rita's. The mouthfeel was also better than expected and not too overly thick."

"The beer hides its alcohol, no grain flavors, but it is way too sweet."
"Straight from the can, aroma is margarita all the way and so is the flavor. They nail what they are going for but i do not get the feeling i am drinking a beer and it fails at that. Would rather have a real margarita."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is like the aroma...lots and lots of lime. Bring on some burritos, refried beans, and rice and I'll have a feast."
""
""
""

"O - I could probably do it once a year with a shot of tequila, but I will stick with shitty Mexican beer for Cinco de Mayo (and of course shots of tequila)."

"If I could score this lower than 1.00 I would!!!! This has got to be the worst tasting stuff I think I've drank in a long time!!!! I think I could get better results pissing in a cup after drinking the best double IPA. I'm not a big fan of commercial beers (I know it's certainly not a beer, still unsure if it should be labeled a malt liquor), I'd rather drink a cup of horse piss before I bought this again!!!! Thank the Devil that I bought 2 from Balmart for $1 each!!!! Dammit I could've used the dollar bills in the strip club!!!"

"This would appear to be an attempt to emulate a margarita in the form of a malt beverage and it did accomplish that in appearance. The nose was sour and full of artificial lime. The taste is actually offensive with an awful sour lime juice flavor, a lemon sour and a true cry for tequila. It's very carbonated and I have no idea whether it's refreshing because I poured it out."
"Pours a lemonade in color with no head as well as no lacing. The aroma is pretty close to a normal margarita. The taste is close to the aroma but nothing too exciting. If I wanted a margarita, why not just have a J.C pre-mix one instead or make your own as I do, which is pretty damn good!. Overall, not real thrilled with this one, though I like their Razz-A-Rita one."

"The mouthfeel seems like they're still going more for beer. It's not still and smooth, it's definitely carbonated and crisp. It's light and thin, as expected, but whatever...which summarizes my overall experience."

""

""
""
"The alcohol is overpowering not to say the limes not their because it is just not enough.The smell is also very strong and for the price you can buy a 4loco or Jose which has as much alcohol and it tastes better. It is hard for me to recommend this drink i am not sure it is worth a try."

"This is not a beer. It does taste good but not in a beer kind of way. It is more like a weak margarita. Which is what they wer going for I guess but I would not buy this for myself or any beer lover. Had a can given to me so I had to rate it. Very sweet no bitterness no spice no beer flavor."

"I decided to try this just now too and aside from the nice 8% ABV, the taste is actually quite nice. I'm not sure what changed my mind. The alcohol is still a bit overpowering but the lime seems to mellow it out more than I thought. It's also still a little hard to get down though but definitely different than when I wrote this review earlier."

"Another craptacular offering from a brewery reeling from the public's (read: less than 10 percent) rebuttal of their bland, homogenous products. Say now! Let's just blend their vacation swilling into an existing beer! Marketing, with any sort of power, sucks balls, once again. Not a real beer - margarita, possibly."

"Can: Poured a lemonade color looking drink with ton of fake lime. Taste is not that far off Margueritas and not even close to beer. I can see this drink working for a certain crowd but I am not really sure it has very much to do with beer at the end of the day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The alcohol flavors are well hidden by the sweetness so this beer is pretty easy to drink (especially for a Malt Liquor). The lime flavors really dominate any flavor that you would get from the underlying Bud LIght but that is not too surprising as the flavors are almost not present in the beer."

"First off, there are some people on here that are entirely too snobby. This tastes like what it is intended to be. It's very light, limey, and refreshing. Like, instant margarita in a can. More carbonated than I was expecting, but it worked. I hate bud light as much as the next person, but I won't knock this just based on the fact that it was made by AB. If this had been made by FFF, people might very well be raving about it. Does it taste like beer? No. Does it taste good, and is it extremely refreshing? Absolutely."

"This is an 8 ounce can Bud Light Lime Lime-A-Rita 8% abv, it's poured into a St Feuillien glass and the beer gods aren't happy with me at all. Hazy yellow, it looks like somebody has a nasty urinary tract infection, fizzy white head lasts all of two seconds. Aroma smells like frozen margarita mix that comes in those tubs, a hint of lime with a bottom shelf tequila. Drinks like a carbonated margarita, I'm getting a hint of saltiness with the lime and margarita mix flavor, beer is nowhere to be found in the flavor profile. If you served this blindly to somebody on Cinco de Mayo they would just recognize it as a shitty margarita. Okay I'm no margarita connoisseur, but I'm guessing this is what a shitty margarita tastes like. After my first sip I'm not turned off so let's go for number two, okay strong lime peel action with a candy like sweetness that fades into a balanced mix of margarita mix with well hidden alcohol and a hint of salt. It is what it is, I'm not hating. I had to try it especially at the dollar price tag, so let's say this was a fresh homemade margarita with seltzer water the carbonation is what throws me of why is this margarita carbonated they are usually on the rocks or frozen in one of those adult Slurpee machines, right? It sets out what it's meant to do get females drunk, don't buy these in number, okay buy them in number and have a party and let the idiots drink outside where they will be puking salty acidic margarita mix that's carbonated all over your outdoor beer pong table. Mouthfeel is fizzy margarita mix residual sugars galore, no depth except for a fruity lime rind bitterness with a salt coating. It's actually not the worst AB experience I've had that would be by far the Chelada experiment that's still being sold on the black market. Overall I want to hate it but the demon on my left shoulder is whispering in my ear it's not that bad c'mon you pansy just finish the last 2 ounces you already took three gulps what's one more."

"O: The lime flavors completely obscure the taste of the underlying beer, but when you consider that this is Bud Light, this might not necessarily be considered a bad thing. It seems a little heavy on the limes and sugary flavors so this would probably be best served over ice so it is diluted. No traces of alcohol are perceptible so this makes for a very drinkable malt liquor if someone is looking for a quick buzz."
""
""
""
"It also cost just $1 so I got my Dollars worth out of it."
"Overall - It is pretty good for what it was, but I do not know if I would order it again."
"This is overall my least favorite beer. Similar to the problems with the straw-ber-rita, this drink does not have many of the flavoring of beer. Overpowered by the lime flavor, these drinks do not sit well in the stomach because of all of the sugar. Would be better if had more beer involved because actual beer-rita's are delicious."
""
""
""
"Overall - it's not really much of a beer since it tastes more like lime juice. Would infuse it with tequila if I ever had again, which is unlikely."
"When we tried the Bud Light Lime-A-Rita in class I was very fond of it because it doesn't taste like your typical beer. The coloring is a yellow/clear ish. The taste definitely had a twist to it and tasted of lime and a pinch of lemon as well. I feel like this would be a very good drink for tropical weather or by the beach. I enjoyed it."
"This is a drain pour on sight. Even if someone offers you one for *free*, not only should you refuse, you should place that person on your enemies list. I wish I could give this zeros instead of ones. Never again...never again."

"So... what to say about it, and how to review it? You can't really look at it as a beer because there's too much flavoring added to it. It's entirely something else altogether, so let's just follow that route and think of it hedonistically. It's sweet. It's a little tart. It's even a little salty. Overall it's an impressive copy of a margarita, and there's certainly a use for that. The first time I tasted this I was in Louisiana and headed out into the hot sun to do a little crawfishin' (that's actually just pulling traps out of a man-made pond, dumping them, re-baiting them, and then replacing them). It came in handy, and I enjoyed it. It has it's place."

"My initial Crack & Glug produced a finger-and-a-half of fizzy, bone-white head with low retention. Color was a deeply cloudy pale-yellow and it occurred to me that it must have pained the brewers not to filter and clarify the heck out of it. Nose smelled of lime, but not natural lime, more like lime candy, such as green Life Savers. I claim better living through chemistry, although the CAN reads ""... with natural flavors ..."" and ""flavored ale", so only our hairdresser knows for sure. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a sweet-tart flavor in the mouth. I initially tasted sweet, but the tartness of the lime quickly took hold. Phew. Finish was dry and tangy. I am not sure how I feel about this one. It might be better on a hot summer's day when I would be looking to quench my thirst, but on a cold February afternoon, it just was not my cuppa tea or glass of AML for that matter. Oh well, at least the price point was like the auto commercial's point - cheap."
"P.S. Since there was 24oz of it, I took half of it and put it in a blender with a shot of tequilla and a cup of crushed ice to see if I could make a decent margarita out of it. Don't try it. All you get is a diluted foamy mess. The blender turns it so foamy that it takes 20 minutes for the foam to die down so you can drink it, and then it's so diluted it doesn't taste very good."

"Bud Light Lime-A-Rita pours a pale yellow with a white head from an eight ounce can. It smells like a margarita. The flavor is pretty much spot on for what it's supposed to be, a margarita with lime using a malt base rather than a hard alcohol base. Pretty good actually for what it is, but arguably more of a malternative than a beer."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a cloudy yellowish/green color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very strong of limes. Taste is a bit like a margarita, lots of sour limes, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall not a bad beer, although I would not want a steady diet of it."
"By no means is this an awful tasting product. It wasn't undrinkable or gross or anything like that. It just wasn't very good, and it was far too sweet to enjoy the entire tall-boy I purchase. How much sugar is in this thing? I'd prefer this to a regular Bug Light, but not by much. Neither of them really resemble a beer, but at least this has some sort of flavor to it."

"Overall, not something I would drink every day, but as far as ""Wine Coolers"" go , this one is pretty good."

"O: Well it's about as close to a margarita you're gonna get out of a ""beer"". Having said that, it's not a very good beer or a very good margarita. It's not horrible though and it gets you drunk so I can't give it 1s..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Well, this is pretty close to what they wanted; margarita flavored beer. Unfortunately, it tastes artificial and it's way too sweet. I couldn't get past a few ounces. I drain poured the rest. This is a novelty and nothing else. I'll never have this again."
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this isn't a terrible "" beer "". It would be perfect for a hot summer day"
"OVERALL: This is an interesting concoction. Not truely a beer, but from a malt liqour stand point, this is an upgrade. Definitely not good beer by any stretch. Still, I can see the niche for something like this. Can't make it out to the liqour store for margarita night? Don't want to keep drinking Steel Reserve? Go to your local seven eleven and pick a few of these up, 8% of pure swill hidden in a margarita costume."
""
"O: It is not awful if you remember it is NOT beer. 8% AC so can pack a punch if you drink many; although this is difficult due to the high sweetness . Different."
"I had to find out if this stuff was any good. Damn morbid curiosity... It pours a lightly hazy pale yellow topped by a finger of quickly-dying off-white foam. The nose betrays the contents entirely: margarita. Straight-up lime (not as artificial as I expected), a squeeze of Squirt, a pinch of brine, and a vague sense of something trying to replace the tequila with some like-scented pod-liqueur. The taste follows pretty closely, with the salt coming through a lot more than expected, while still keeping its distance behind the lime. I'm not the biggest fan of margaritas or lime in general, but this honestly wasn't horrendous. ...Just not entirely good. The body is a light medium, with a fizzy carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, it delivers what it promises, a low-ABV margarita experience in a can, but it's not all that great of an experience. It could have been worse, but that's hardly the praise you wanna hear."
"O= This tastes like a sierra mist and vodka mixed drink. There isn't really much else to it. I actually don't see this as beer so I find it a little odd it's on he site but as a mixed drink it even sort of sucks."

"O: Pretend it's not a beer and you won't be so offended. Like a wine cooler with more of an alcohol kick . My wife said this would appeal more to the ladies, but only if it were marketed in a bottle. The 24 oz tallboy is a man's beer. I think the high sweetness is the biggest turnoff here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) This is not beer... This was not enjoyable... Good thing my drain was thirsty."
""

"Poured this can of malt liquor into a pint glass. Poured a hazy straw color, produced little head, and left no lacing on the glass. The pour reminded me of pouring a soda. The aroma smells of tequilla, agave and ...margarita...Lots of artificial lime flavor. Medium in body, over sweet, tastes like no beer I have ever had....probably because it really isn't beer. Syrupy mouthfeel- I could only choke down a couple of these cans. Glad i tired it, even glader that it's gone."
""
""
"T: Oy, I don't know what I can really say about this one. Tastes like those cheap premixed Jose Cuervo Margaritas. I really don't get any hints of beer at all. It is what it is-basically a margarita in a can. My biggest problem with it is that the syrupy mouthfeel and insane sweetness makes it rough to drink more than a glass of."
""
""
""
"O: Not beer. Very sugary. Too sweet to drink a lot of, but itâ€™s not terrible because it tastes just like margarita mix and sugar."
"Astringent lemon-lime flavor with an artificial chemical plastic aftertaste. Mmm, Flinstones vitamins. Cloying, toothache sweet. Flat carbonation, tart citrus, like straight up margarita mix dumped in some lemonade. The Bud Light is nowhere to be found... oh well. If there was only 5% beer in this i'd believe it. Not beer, this is alcopop despite the Bud Light logo on the can. Lowest common denominator junk... dumped over half of it."
""
""
""
""
"Bud Light Lime-A-Rita will appeal to the masses looking for a malternative beverage that touts 8% ABV and most will find comfort in it's blend of standard margarita mix flavor and basic malt liquor kick. I suppose, when all is said and done, Bud Light Lime-A-Rita has it's place."
