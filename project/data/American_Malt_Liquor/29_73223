One of my customers came in the store on a Monday or Tuesday and was buying that beer. I told him of the man that killed that lady and my customer said it wasn't the beer that killed her. I told him he is correct, but when you are ""sober"" you aren't as big as you are when you are drunk. Wednesday came and went. Thursday came...he got into an argument with his wife and it could have been physical though the police are saying there weren't signs of physical altercations on her body. She was hit by a car and killed. Two woman are DEAD from men drinking this beer. Ironic?!?!?!?!?!?

Another quote from thekevlarkid (1-29-12) ""Nothing to speak of and clearly just a beer that's trying to get people ripped so they'll be half conscious when they mug someone in a row house and smoke their chiba one the street before being hit by a car because that is how it is done here in Balitmore. Awesome."" BEFORE BEING HIT BY A CAR. Yep! That is how it is done where I am too because now there are FIVE children without a beautiful mother.

The aroma was of corn, sweet malt, cheap booze and an artificial sweetness akin to candy. The flavors were similar, being pretty much the standard grainy booze and sweet malt trying to hide the grainy booze. Nothing to speak of and clearly just a beer that’s trying to get people ripped so they’ll be half conscious when they mug someone in a row house and smoke their chiba one the street before being hit by a car because that’s how its done here in Baltimore. Awesome. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/light and the carbonation high.","thekevlarkid","Jan 29, 2012"

3.07,27.9,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"From the 24 fl. oz. can stamped 293-NB80. Sampled on December 17, 2011. Another American Malt Liquor to pound down from the brown bag! And it pours yellow with lots of fizz that fizzles fast. It is important to review this based on style rather than on who brews it. When I first break open the can I get an almost pear-like fruitness. But after I pour it into the my Retro Miller pint glass it becomes a typical grainy aroma with a sniff of yeast, bread, and clean, crisp hops sliding in from the backside. The texture is in the medium range and when swirling it on my tongue it turns to carbonated bubbles in about ten seconds. The taste is very much in tune with the malt liquor style with its pungent grainy and clean hop bite but it does not leave a sour aftertaste like so many other malt liquors. For a craft beer it gets a low rating. But strictly by style it is a tad better than others in this category.","puboflyons","Dec 17, 2011"

No head retention or lacing this beer looks like carbonated cider or apple juice. Aroma has a solvent chemical smell to it that really doesn't sit well with me, believe me this isn't the beer I'm going to reach for ever again. Flavor wise it's hard to believe they make something this horrible who pitched this to the marketing team, alright the insanely popular Natty Light has to be bigger let's call it NattyDaddy. Hard to swallow down, pretty smooth considering the alcohol content as far as any type of a burn. Harsh in the flavor cooked corn veggies a hint of metallic disgust and more chemical solvent no classic natural ingredients come to mind other than damn this came from a lab and a factory setting. Mouthfeel is horrible the flavor won't leave the palate this is getting dumped down the drain. That pretty much explains how I feel about 24 ounce malt liquor.","WVbeergeek","Oct 12, 2011"
