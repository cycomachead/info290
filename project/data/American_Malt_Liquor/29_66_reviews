"Not bad really. Like the commercial used to say: ""Don't let the smooth taste fool ya!"""
"Best 40 on the market.. Best bang for your buck"
""
"King Cobra...drink it and you'll be a Cobra for life!"
""
"My malt of choice, very drinkable. But as with malts definitely intended to get someone drunk over a great drink"
"O - Very refreshing but a bit tame for a high gravity lager. If you must mow your lawn this year, King Cobra will balm the savage thirst."
"Nothing fancy, just an easy to drink malt liquor. Malt and corn sweetness. Crisp, light. Great example of the style."
"Pours a golden color with only a small lace of head around the rim, highly carbonated. Smells like standard corn adjunct lager. Not much flavor until it reaches the bottom of your throat. Not as putrid as I expected. A little bitter in the aftertaste. After a couple tastes I'm starting to taste the fuel like malt liquor flavor. Far from the best malt liquor, but not the worst either."

"When I used to drink malt liquors, this was my favorite. Malt liquors exist to get a person drunk as possible on the least amount of money and I used to buy KC quartz for 99 cents plus tax and CRV back in the 90's, but I have not had this beer since."

"Overall I can't recommend this beer to you, but I wouldn't say this isn't something you shouldn't try. My averge for the rating is 2.8ish, which rounds to being a 3. It's okay, but to me it is a bit harsh and I would rather drink Old English 800 or Private Stock Instead."

"Yes, this is not a truly fine brew, but it is cold, wet, carbonated, and cheap. You get what you py for, and sometimes it isn't the higher priced stuff. This stuff is not too bad when icy cold on a hot summer day. Actually, it's pretty good considering the price, although it desperately needs some hops. Sadly, adding a decent amount of hops would raise the price, defeating the point of being the cheapest beer around. I give it a 4.5 because it is good value for the money, and probably best in it's class."

"Drink the ol' four-oh down to the bottom of the neck & top the bottle off with a little Tropicana Orange Juice. Gently swirl & enjoy this wonderful poor man's Mimosa. Make Mike D proud & get your brass monkey on, son. If you ain't on that King Cobra grind, then you better get your head right or your wig split."

"King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor ---2/5."

"Many friends of mine are in sheer disbelief that I actually like this beer. You probably asking yourself why like they do. First off, the taste to me is better that any other malt liquor, and although the ingredients are simple...corn. Its a smooth drink. its also high in alcohol content which for its price gives a nice cheap buzz. If I drink enough the corn taste keeps getting sweeter. Drink this stuff ice cold and its better in cans, the light cant get to it."

"O - This is best drank ice cold, quickly and straight from the can or bottle. Still, for what it is it really isn't all that bad."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a lifeless clear pale straw color with no head or lacing. Nose is corny, grainy, musty and metallic. There are hints of stale skunky character at the end. Taste starts with water followed by an addition of slightly sweet and musty grain notes that gain in strength. The finish is metallic and stale tasting. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. Yeah, this one is pretty bad!"
"how ever if you do try it its only a $1.80 loss..."
""
""
""
""
"I have only tryed Steel Reserve in a 24oz can which costs as much as the Cobra yet you are getting 16 less ounces. The price on the Cobra can not be beat but of coarse the taste can be beat. Try this for yourself if low on money it will get the job done and for only $1.65 for a 40 wow what a deal. Hats off to Anheuser Busch for that =)"

"O- Overall, this malt liquor is quite good. It's easy to drink and has a great taste. Refreshing."

"O: Not very flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, solid representation of style, considering the style it’s not too bad, but there are other inexpensive beers I would prefer if I were just trying to get a buzz."
""
""
""
"O- Obviously not a high-end sophisticated brew, but nothing offensive. I would not seek this out or list it among my favorites, but would drink again if offered. Better than the only other malt liquor I tried."
""
""
""
"...I'd choose a BIG ""A" every time..YO!"
"Me and my homies be on a motorcycle tripz in a dry county needing something to drink we got ahold od dis shitz it was some fly azz shitz we pounded sum 40's and plaz some domino bitches it goes realz nize in a paper sack yo. We be getting tis shitz everz time we be ridin yoz dont fogetz to poorz sum out for the motoz that be gonz"
""

"O: Nothing offensive here. It's way easy to drink, and I think that's the point. Weird to have something from AB that is actually enjoyable (not gross). Value isn't that great, approaching $2 for a 24oz."
""
""
""
""
""

"You definitely wanna drink King Cobra as cold you possibly can. But in simplest terms though it's like drinking cornbread, very comforting and every bit worth the $2. I am listening to King Crimson (thanks to another member) and feel very happy. Of course I had 240z of a Riverside EDGE (which was MEH at best...) prior to this 40oz, but if you aren't completely stuck up up you can appreciate that Anheuser-Busch created a surprisingly edible concoction for $2.02"

"Overall – Not an overall massively tasty brew, but it is wicked cheap (~ 3 dollars for a 6 pack) and is drinkable, so it suits a need and a situation. For what it is, it is pretty decent."
""
""
"For a malt liquor this beer is better than most. Honestly, I would buy this if I was really, really broke."
""
"Another absolutely disgusting malt liquor. Only good for taping around your hands and chugging as fast as you can. As most of these beers tend to be, it gets absolutely horrifying once it warms up even a little bit. Astringent booze, syrupy sweet malt, no hop flavor, with grainy and husky off flavors. Stay away."
""
"This is my favorite malt liquor. It's crisp and refreshing and is delicious mixed as a sidewalk slammer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Some malt flavor, a little sweetness; not particularly offensive when cold. Alcohol is a little rougher than some of the other major malt liquors, but also not the worst... I suppose plainly middle of the road for the style"
"Drank from the can as part of a college dare. Objective was simply to finish the entire can without drainpouring. Incredibly cheap but also barely palatable. Tasted like corn and gasoline, which makes sense since we found these at about $0.30 a pop at the local Sheetz. We did finish them however, and promptly autographed the cans upon completion to commemorate our worthwhile shame and regret. We displayed these trophies on our mantle for the rest of the semester."

"This is a typical, high temperature lagered, grainy lager with the typical off flavors for the style. For a cheap buzz it's solid otherwise avoid."

""
""
"Overall this beer is great for the price range. Compared to the other cheap beers that cost less that $6 a 6 pack, this is the best choice. You get a huge can and it packs 6% alcohol content."
""
""
""
"If you are trying to acheive a buzz then this is definately a go to beer. Not high quality by any means but for the price, who can complain"

"Overall, this is a terrible beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So, bland, cheap, and effective is how I would brand this beer. Normally a good thing for a malt liquor, but I like mine with flavour, so I'm going to have to say this one's pretty bottom of the barrel. No flavour at all."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Alright for a malt liiquor very adjuct. Believe it or not, I don’t see this one in Missouri very often. I just thought that was a bit weird for an Anheuser-Busch product."
""
"Overall I prefer Hurricane from AB, and Mickey's over this one. Not awful but pretty forgettable."
""
""
""
"I decided to try this one days after the house of the ""Cleveland Strangler", Anthony Sowell was torn down. News stories that covered his crimes and misdeeds said that he used this beer to lure the women he victimized, and I decided I had to review it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I guess it's not that bad for being $1.89 for a 40oz, but I'll never resort to drinking this again unless I'm poor. Haha"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is awful even by malt liquor standards. I think I may have been overly generous when I gave this monstrosity scores of 1.5 across the board. This may very well be the worst beer I've ever tried."
""
""
"Okay, i will be fair on my assessment of this beer. Obviously malt liquor is not a gourmet beer, but this one is drinkable. First off, its cheap, and if youre broke or in a pinch, its not that bad. The downfall of this beer is the raunchy malt aroma which makes the taste all that worse. The beer pours like a stereotypical malt liquor and has the ubiquitous harsh taste."
"...oh who am I kidding. You get what you pay for."
"D: Get trashed beer. not much more."
"I would say King Cobra is king as far as malt liquor goes. Olde English 800 and those of that ilk are undrinkable for me...gross on the back end. King Cobra, like the bros say, has a clean finish. Smells a bit funky, some kind of sharpness going on there, but it doesn't taste terrible. It's the rough equivalent of buying a 40oz of BMC, no better, no worse. Save yourself a few bucks and get two of these instead of a sixer of coors or whatever."
"Overall Drinkability - Haven't had this since I was 17, which is about a decade ago. Turns out there's a pretty good reason for that. My decision to rate this beer makes me feel like a dirty beer-karma slut."
"O - I don't like this beer other than the great packaging because you don't want to mess with a KING COBRA."
"still i do have a sweet spot in my heart for this beer as it is the beer i drank the most of before i turned 21."
"If the dollars are tight and your not a beer snob, this is a must try."
"just...dont do it."
"Only gunna buy again for drinking games or if I wanna get effed up. Lol. Not the tastiest of beers but it's not like I couldn't finish it. It's whatever."
"Considering its reputation, it's an accomplishment that it turns out (for the style) not bad. Not being added to rotation, but wasn't a total waste of my 2 bucks either. I feel like if it had a touch more actual malt (enough to bump it up to 7-8% probably) it could catch on to something..."
"Pours a typical straw yellow color with a thick white head and no lacing. Smells of corn and a little grain. Tastes of corn and grain and some sweet malts. Mouthfeel is thin and watery and has a heavy carbonation. Overall it is a poor beer and ever a poor representative of its style. I really did not enjoy it."
"he only thing I do like about King Cobra is the price. The price is very cheap, and you can usually get them for about 2 dollars. I think that King Cobra would only give me a good buzz if I drank on an empty stomach and I downed it fast. Other than that it didn't give me a good buzz. I didn't really like the taste of King Cobra beer. The taste is very watery. It's not a really bad taste like 211 but it lacks any flavor."
"Decent, what more can I say. It isn't terrible by any means, but it isn't good either. It has a very heavy smell and taste of corn adjunct, and has an almost tasteless feel going down. However once the brew goes down, the taste changes leaving an aftertaste in your mouth for a while. The swill (the last swallow at the bottom) is terrible. Almost makes you gag. Very carbonated and gives you a very ""crisp"" feeling in your mouth. It's decent... But nothing wonderful. If you want to get drunk fast, then it would probably work, but other than that, don't bother."
"Otherwise this beer lacks the creamy nature found in a few others of the style and no longer bears any resemblance to your standard Bud. Might be me, might be the beer after these years. Interestingly this beer fills out a bit, keeps its carbonation and becomes more balanced well through 50 degrees, rounding out the aroma and feel in doing so. Flavor still falls a bit short of average."
"The final entry in this miniature torture chamber known as SwillFest 1.5. It pours a clear apple juice topped by around a finger of short-lived white foam. The nose comprises corn, corn syrup, lots o' rice, and hard water. The taste holds notes of vinyl, corn, wheat, and rice. The word adjunct comes to mind. Don't know why. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, the only thing this really has going for it is its low price. But, even at such a bargain basement level, I would not want to ever revisit this purposely."
"This beer pours a clear orange golden color with no foam at all. The smell is of nothing really. The taste is mostly of malt drink...there really is no other way to discuss this beverage. Somehow it's not the worst thing that I've consumed so it's in good standing in my mind."
"King Cobra is the only beer I buy! The price is excellent $.75 for a 16oz can. Its the only beer that has that ""full"" taste. You know your are drinking beer, when you drink King Cobra. I'm not sure about the appearance because I only buy it in the can. But if you drink King Cobra regularly you'll lose your taste for any other beers, because they are so weak."
"d- this beer is exceptionally easy to chug but i dont recommend it for any other purposes"
"get bitten by the Cobraaaa"
"Taken directly from the bottle. Look: Bright golden color with many threads of bubbles. Smell: Didn't know if it was apple soda with alcohol or malt liquor. Taste: Sweet malt flavor well balanced with some remnants of alcohol. Mouthfeel: Refreshing, bitter sweet and some times too sweet, medium body and high carbonation. Drinkability: Doesn't cloying like other malt liquors, good."
"This is a mass produced beer for one who needs a buzz but doesn't have the funds for much. Cheep beer, cheep flavor. First of all there is very little respect for this beer by the brewers seeing it is in a clear class bottle, I guess one step down from the can, as the can does not let light spoil the taste. Poured it from this big 32 oz bottle in to my 42 degree mug, what a waste, I should have drank it from the bottle, but had to see the overall appearance...not. The head was one and a half fingers of soap suds that vanished before my eyes, and the color was about the lightest I have ever observed at 4 on the SRM color chart. Weak smell of wet straw and malt. Taste...well not much of that, but what there was....not too bad, sweet corn, wheat, malt, and a hint of rye. Sort of a balloon feeling in my mouth, expanding pressure, but no tingle. I am very thankful I can purchase better beers than this, but for the price and the buzz factor, good bang for the buck, but if I am looking for flavor, I will look elsewhere."
"D: Avoid at all costs. I drank more than a couple of these as an undergraduate, but never because they tasted good. Maturity and a more discerning palate have reduced this to simply unpalatable."
"This is a straight wino beer, it has to be the worst beer I have ever tasted. There's nothing great about it, the malt taste like garbage and dirt. If you like cheap malt beer buy Mikieys that at least has a good taste. Just avoid this beer at all cost."
"D - Drinkability, on the other hand, is just on the wrong side of average."
"Overall this may have been the worst of the bunch, just not something I would ever go back to."
"Drinkability is just ok for me. It does go down quite easy and there really isn't anything offensive about it. However there is nothing about it that would make me want go out and get it again. But for the style, certainly not the worst I've had."
"From the 40 ouncer sampled on Memorial Day 2010. It pours a straw yellow with a puffy white head that bubbles away little by little. The aroma is machine-processed malts, grassy, and rather skunky. The taste is a bit better on the maltiness with an obvious alcohol note. You get what you pay for and I paid $1.99."
"D: Just far too sweet for me, but fairly unoffensive as far the style goes."
"Cheers"
"This beer is absolute shit. If the smell alone doesn't cause immediate vomiting, don't worry, its on the way. I would rather drink hobo piss than drink this beer. It would probably contain more natural ingredients than this toxic soup masquerading as a malt liquor."
"If you're getting it for the right reasons, you won't be upset, but if you're looking for a ""sippin' beer," then find another brew."
"Its appearance, not spectacular, I wont say what i think it looks like, because no beer should ever be compared to that, so Ill just leave that there. Its smell, boring, like bland beer. It tastes boring, not even boring average, just 'meh.' The mouthfeel, its most redeeming quality, its a little pungent and pretty crisp. If this beer were to be chilled to near freezing, then gulped down on a hot summer day, it probably would pass as refreshing. Drinkability, I would probably advise to avoid, there are better malt liqueurs in the dollar seventy cent range that would make a better investment for you, but when they're free, who can blame you."
"Update: I will not change my review, considering I have had this beer more than several times. It is not good most of the time. However, I did have some of this stuff to go with a burger at a tailgate, and was quite pleasantly surprised. Maybe give that a try."
"D: In the realm of malt liquors this is a lightweight. Tastes and feels like a light lager, boring to drink. The fact that it's not particularly offensive is the only plus side."
"Ok! With this brew you will buying for the price and abv%. You will not be buying it for anything else. The appearance was not very good at all. Smell was of sweet malts and grain. The taste is nothing don't have one really. The mouthfeel is non existant. That makes a really nice drinkability. If your looking for a cheap beer that has a nice buzz this is your brew!"
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"SHIT CHEAP!!!"
"Money would be better spent on quality and not size like this 40oz."
"Thin body and average drinkability. As far as taste in malt liquors go, this one actually has something. Problem is it gets old fast. Down it, then get on with your life."
"enjoy."
"Drinkability? If you're over 21.... What are you thinking?"
"I'd have to say that this is probably one of the better malt liquors out there. the colour gravitates away from thin piss to a vitamin rich colour, like if you take vitamin e or something. the taste is fine, but the smell is god awful once it gets above 33 deg F."
"Skeet, skeet, skeet!"
"RJT"
"Taste is pretty smooth with very little alcohol bite for this rather mild and tame malt liquor. There is a hint of unexpected bitterness in there that helps offset the sweetness of the brewing grains. Not as overly carbonated as some of the others I have tried. A bit of fruitiness comes through as well. This one is actually not that bad of a ML, a little above average for the style in my mind."
"I guess mouthfeel, drinkability wise, it doesn't get worse, once you get over those first few sips, you can make it thruogh the rest, begrudgingly."
"Pours with a pretty attractive white head one finger high and a pale golden body. Head pretty much fizzles down leaving a thin ring on top. The nose is a bit weak, with some cidery malts and a hint of solvent alcohol. Not a bad smell really though. The taste starts with a good balance of malts and bitterness, but things go all haywire once the malt beverage swishes into the back of the throat. Loads of carbonation and bubbles splash around on the back of the tongue and a bitterness washes over the palate. Not a good hop bitterness, but rather something that evolves on the finish and turns into cider, rusty nails, burnt plastic, and ends with rotting corn. Blarg. Body is light to medium, overcarbonated, bad sawdust or cornmeal coating on the mouth. Drinkability is weak due to this being kinda gross."
"Time to make a phone call before heading to the sink."
"D- Not bad, If I was in still in college I could drink several of these, get black out drunk and do something foolish."
"D- High. This one is one of my favorite malt liquors, all things considered. Not as heavy or as intoxicating as O.E. or Private Stock, this one is a heavyweight that's light enough to be consumed with ease. Highly recommended if you're looking for some malt liquor."
"Poured from a clear 40 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts and corn. Taste is malty with some corn, fairly smooth, not overpowering with alcohol. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is not a bad beer for this style."
"Drinkability, on the other hand, is just on the wrong side of average."
"Give it respect for what it is, a collage beer. A damn fine one."
"Clear light gold with a small white head. The nose is green apple skin and untoasted grain. Grits, sour apple skin and bubblegum with a funky hop bitterness in the finish. Light bodied and watery. Effervescent carbonation. Drinkable and inoffensive but more of an ""ice"" beer than malt liquor IMO."
"In the 40oz malt liquor department this is my weapon of choice. Most taste terrible, but this is acceptable."
"Mouth was a little thin, but there was just enough carbonation to be enjoyable. Flavor was of sweet malts and hints of caramel. Not bad. I preferred the Colt 45 that we 'enjoyed' last week more than this, but this is alright. It gets the job done. It's big, cheap, and highly drinkable."
"Yes, sir, once again it's forty-ounces-of-beer-and-a-C-cup-blonde night at my place. Truth be told, it's one of my favorite nights! Though the girl is the same this time the malt liquor was all-new, and out of the bottle it was a pale golden color with good clarity and a nice amount of rising carbonation. My aggressive pour yielded three-fingers worth of slightly yellow tinted head that retained rather well and left pretty good lacing. The aroma was of macro grains, stale malt and alcohol. The flavors were generic and grainy with alcohol notes (especially as it warmed) some dry malt and a little sourness. The finish was bitter and a little unpleasant. The mouthfeel was average and a little slick, the body medium/light and the carbonation a little high. So fine, the beer sucked. But my female companion did too. I had no complaints."
"Malt Liquors are generally horrible, but effective brews designed to get you drunk. King Cobra is easily among the most foul. It's a got a sickening corn sweetness which lasts only for a few seconds. Its right about this point where the King Cobra is unleashed upon your taste buds. You're instantly hit with a sourness and bitterness from the absolute worst hop flavor imaginable. It's like a used hop flavor mixed in with dirty tennis shoe. The entire experience is horrible, but luckily goes away quickly, much like the sweetness of the brew. This is a beverage which should ONLY be consumed if you are dirt poor and or are preparing for a new career as a bum. In either case though, you're better off spending a tad more money for a better malt liquor."
"Poured into a drinking horn (cow). Smells of clean-burning, all American corn. I suspect this corn came from America's heartland, but I can't tell simply from the nose. Tastes slick, fusely, and corny (I'm now sure this corn came from America's heartland). Taken in unison, I'd say these flavors make it taste smooth. But I won't let the smooth taste fool me... This malt liquor packs a 'king' sized wallop."
"D- Could have a lot of this... definitely one for drinking games or to just get drunk."
"Final Thoughts - I am rating it based on the style. This is not craft brewing at is finest. In fact it comes out to roughly 60 cents a beer. This beer is cheap, but I have had worse."
"Big fizzy off-white head with a clear bright yellow body. No lacing but the carbonation is alright. Looks good enough I guess. The smell is mostly corn adjuncts. It has a light enough taste and feel to make it fairly easily drinkable, and I suppose that's the whole point of this beer. Carbonation petered out to early and the mouthfeel suffered for it."
"D - I could easy drink a lot of this if I wanted to, but I have a feeling that my anus will regret it. It's not enjoyable at all, but I don't find it at all offensive."
"Pretty decent, nothing offensive, Id say give it a try. Cheers!"
"Overall: a truly terrible beverage"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Light bodied, corny, somewhat slick on the palate. Moderate sweetness persists through the finish. Not as dry as the better malt liquors out there, and as such not as easy to drink. Best served at near-freezing temperatures in order to numb the taste buds."
"About two months old. No grape skin flavors this time. Better than average M.L."
"Not the worst thing I've ever tried, but pretty bad nonetheless."
"D - An ok example of the style. King Cobra is another malt liquor that better deserves it's spot among American macros. However there really isn't anything bad about this brew, just some things missing from the malt liquor standpoint."
"It's not so much that this is horrible, but it is like an extremely light lager with poorly hidden alcohol and that's just not very good. There's just almost nothing positive to say about the beer. It could certainly be worse. I had a sip of Joose, an energy drink/flavored malt beverage, and that deserves a score a few points lower across the board than this beer (a technically impossible negative numeric score, but then it should be classified as a sin against humanity rather a beverage). Anyway, King Cobra looks ok. It has a very unexciting look, incredibly clear pale gold with some ugly white lacing. The nose is metallic, alcoholic and corny. It makes some adjunct lagers taste malty. Then again, it's not patently offensive. I wouldn't slap someone in the face for giving me a glass of it. It just tastes like very cheap beer made with little to no care for flavor. The flavor is mild with notes of metal, corn/rice which comes out a bit biscuity in a bad way, and too much alcohol for the body. The feel is thin and mildly gag-inducing. The alcohol and other bad qualities grow as I make my way through a glass. Speaking of which, Duvel please forgive me for misusing your tulip so. All in all, I would pass if this were the only thing on the menu and it was free, but I wouldn't punch someone in the face for giving me one. That might not sound like a compliment, but I'm working up to my Bud Chelada review."
"The aroma is like rubbing alcohol and corn malt no detectable hops. The appearance is pale gold with a large head that falls to a thin foam. The taste is pure corn malt with rubbing alcohol just like the aroma. The palate is thin and just like most malt liquors. Overall it's no good."
"Taste feels like a lot of alcohol with a lot of sugar; not bad but certainly not good; I can see this being used to get drunk, but by no means as a way to enjoy beer. Straight drainpour for me."
"This beer is for the sole purpose of getting drunk. the smell, taste, appearance and everything is rubbish. I am drinking a forty of it. Its bad. Don't drink this uness you are about out go out for a night on the town and are short on cash. Its beer and of course for the reason for drinking, its drinkable, but friends don't let friends drink king cobra."
"I wish I could vote a ""0" here. Well, maybe not, because then Milwaukee's Beast would be rated higher and we just can't have that. I'll tell you what though, those looking for a quick drunk for the price, here you go... this is SOOO cheap. Then again, do you even want to drink stuff that's this cheap? What do they put in it anyways? Nevermind, don't want to know. This is a hangover waiting to happen."
"Yes, it has alcohol in it. Yes, it will get you a buzz for little dough. My main complaint is the taste. Normally, with cheap brews like this, you get at least some kinda funky aftertaste or something, but with King Cobra, nothing. Tastes like water with a hardly any malt or anything. It's like Busch just gave up after putting alcohol and coloring in the bottle. I paid 1.19$ for 40 oz. of this??"
"10:00 PM on a hot summer night with a couple of close friends, lighting up some coals and cooking up late night burgers and dogs. Don't be surprised to find me on the patio swing with a 40 of Cobra at my side."
"mouthfeel is crisp from carbonation but offensive from everything else, lingering gross adjunct-y flavor makes the mouth go downhill. drinkablity is low indeed."
"Drinkability is good for a cheap dollar spent. It's best for sports events and just wanting a quick cheap buzz to spark amongst friends. Otherwise, this stuff is just for the cheap dollars at heart."
"D- Drinks like water drinks. Average"
"What kind of malt liquor has a 5.9% abv? Isn't the point of this stuff to get intoxicated? A nasty golden color with no head. The nose is bitter with some malty syrup presence. Taste is of rotting vegatables. Thick yet really carbonated. Stay away from this monster."
"The taste is worse. Watery and bland, it's almost salty at first, then metallic and soapy with an unpleasant chemical sharpness in the finish before an exceedingly faint, brief, corn element but even this is both faint and brief."
"Poured a sickly yellow. No head. Skunky flavoring, watery mouthfeel. Ah ... good memories."
"Not as bad as I thought it would be, though still pretty terrible."
"This, to me, is the most gutteral of the 40 oz malt liquors (I always rate 40s on their color, not how they pour because you don't pour 40s). It is like Budweiser's run off that they catch and bottle for cheap. This stuff has a decent golden color, for malt liquor, and the smell is like other malt liquor 40s (you know, real alkie). This one has the worst taste though. To me at least, it seems a little slimy and then there's this dryness left in my mouth. I never made it through a full one yet w/o just dumping the last 10 ounces (piss warm by this time) and grabbing something else)"
"Ah, King Cobra how do you do? We've met many times before, but not for over a year. Born on date of 17 July 07, maybe that would explain the subtle skunkiness. Not really much else. BTW, I'm drinking this how a malt liqour should be drank, out of the bottle. Clear yellow. Tastes like a grown up Bud with much more sweetness. There really isn't much to this, not much smell not much taste just extra alcohol. Be careful though of the king of the snakes... it's venom can be dangerous."
"Pours golden/yellow with sudsy-white head and good lace. Harsh aroma of grains, hops, and possibly industrial solvents and oils. The mouthfeel has almost no character - turns to water in the mouth. The best, although nothing great, part is the flavor - malty, hops, lemon, some bitterness. Overall, a pretty weak beer, yet it is drinkable, unlike some other cheap malt liquors."
"Not recommended"
"Inoffensive and easy to drink."
""
"Overall: Forget caged corks, screw tops say class like nothing else. Anyway, if your MO is to get Fd up for cheap, this is not the best way to go. The 6% ABV isnt worth it; there are scads of domestic ice beers with 5.5% that are better-tasting (relatively speaking), and other high-gravity or malt liquors that are higher in ABV and probably better as well. Avoid."
"Don't even bother pouring King Cobra out of the 40. Let's not get rediculous, this is a malt liquor we're talking about, and it doesn't worry about presentation too much. The appearance is bland, the smell is terrible, and the taste...is suprisingly better than some of the AB ""beers"" IMO. I hate macro lagers and most malt liquor but for some reason I have a weakness for king cobra. It goes down smooth as long as it's cold and doesn't get too nasty when it warms up. For under $2 a bottle it is a good way to get toasted without breaking the bank and once again it is not only cheaper but more drinkable than a lot of macro lagers or light lagers."
"King Cobra Premium Malt Liquor pours a pale orange with a white head from a sixteen ounce can. The aroma is a little fruity. The taste is a bit fruity too, followed by grain. Interesting to revisit this one, it was my go to 40 oz in college when I'd have to dig up change to find enough money to go buy a beer. I still think it's pretty drinkable for a malt liquor."
"In search of the decent cheapo. This one is pale straw-yellow with a medium, white, foamy, quickly diminishing head. The smell is, wow, not bad for a cheap malt liquor. Not the corn and strong alcohol Im used to, instead a mild but decent grainy malt with some doughy yeast... I think I even detect a very slight wisp of citrus from the hops. Taste is again surprisingly decent. More of the same. Bready, a little corn, with a late tinge of hop citrus and dryness, not much but just enough to let you know its there. Eh, as it warms it starts to let out a bit of that adjunct-laden stink. Too bad, I was starting to like this beer. Thin body, texture is a bit watery, moderate carbonation. This one actually impressed me a little. At $1.75 for a 40 and with a name like King Cobra, I was expecting something that would really bite. But this was actually a little enjoyable. Nothing I would recommend or anything, but the realm of cheapos, this one is not too shabby."
"I would recommend this beer to those who like Malt liquors, but prefer less intimidating and full flavored ones."
"Crystal clear light yellow with plenty of carbonation. Nothing special, nothing bad here. There is a modicum of malt in the nose, but the adjuncts, maybe corn?, appear also. I was expecting refrigerated liquified sterno for the taste, but instead was met with a clean, light bodied lager taste. There was a bit of alcohol at the end and the riciness was clear in the crispy and thinning mouthfeel. This was not as terrible as I had expected. It did taste different than its sister Hurricane (which was much more ""fuel"" flavored.) Certainly nothing I would buy or recommend, but if you are looking for something to compare a craft malt liquor such as Daddy's Little Helper or Liquor de Malt then this is worth the $1.50 or so you'll pay for a 40 ounce bottle. Available at finer highway gas stations where beer is sold."
"A pretty rough brew. On the bottle it claims it is malt liquor, however, it tastes like kerosene, but it is tolerable if you're low on cash. You can buy three of them for around 5 bucks, so if you just want to get drunk, it's a pretty dang good choice."
"I have battled many cobras, and usurped many a king, but never had I topped myself by going toe to toe with the King Cobra. I met a 19 year old girl from West Virginia who confessed that her favorite was King Cobra and Sparks. And some think women have no guts for the beer battlefield. First, before we add our assent to previous reviews, one must know the proper way to ""coax"" this dangerous serpent out of its basket. If a hand held wind, reed, or brass instrument is not available, play ""The Payback"" album by James Brown on your stereo. Drink cool and allow to get warm by mid-serving in order for the venom to take optimal effect. If three of these do not wipe out all vestiges of your inner prevaricating beer geeky self, then you have no soul left to save."
"Another malt liquor like you really need another one after Hurricane...appears a clear glden tone with a large white head leaves behind even lace but it dwindles quickly. Aroma has a slight metallic grainy note that has a sort of semi sweet alcohol corn and rice appeal to it and of course cooked veggies with a touch of fruity tart apple. Flavors collide to form a harsh metallic grainy offness on the palate wow this is rediculous has how bad it is but a mild sweet tone with evident alcohol and finishes with a very chemical edge to it, definitely will induce a headache drinking this stuff on the regular. Mouthfeel has high carbonation light bodied some stickiness to it all but c'mon another beer within the same damn style. Drinkability mass produced malt liquor beer you buy when your broke and don't care about taste...what more can be said this one sucks."
"Pours a pale, straw-yellow into the glass. This is somewhat misleading as it appears to be a darker, near-bronze in the bottle because of the clear glass and the dark label shadowing the yellow beer. The best part of the appearance is some good retention, but on a second-rate head. As for the smell, it's virtually non-existant. A very faint whiff of malts and that's about it. The taste is malty and smooth but again lacks in substance. The mouthfeel just screams AB at you. Drinkable, if you can tolerate the taste after a while."
"D - Very low, unless you are on a budget. This stuff sure does what it claims to do...I drank this while watching a movie and by the end of ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" I was pretty damn cooked. I must say that it's one of the better 40 oz cheapo brews though."
"D - FOr the style it is very drinkable. For a beer, id rather go with some flavor."
"Notes: Drank strait from the bottle no pouring going on here."
"Pale gold. Tan head. Little lace. Aroma is a nice blend of crisp, cool freshness, exotic spices, sensual woods, and seductive musk. It gives a fresh warm sensation. The flavor really surprised me. Sexy citrus, lavender and woods. Top notes play with pistachio leaves, iced lavender, Chinese ginger, and mandarin peel. Following up are middle notes of celery greens, wild tiger lily, Indian basil, and Kashmir saffron. The finale comes clean with brisk bristlecone pine, patchouli, and clear musk notes. Interesting to say the least."
"I thanked my friend for this ""Smooth tasting Premium Malt Liquor naturally brewed from select ingredients for MY drinking pleasure and complete satisfaction."" Next time I'll opt. for the glass of water...thanks."
"Had one of these on the way to campground this weekend. For $1.00, this was not half bad. King Cobra is light to mid-bodied, with what I like to call a ""sting"". Got a bit of an alcoholic kick to it. The snake does not play around, and right around 6% it gets the job done. Heavy malt, but not excessively sweet. Quite balanced, with a sweeping discreet hop bitter, that balances it out. Mouthfeel is thin, and drinkability is superb. I am a sucker for new beers, and this one definitely caught my eye. In all honesty this brew suprised me, I was expecting much worse."
"Drinkability: This is really not very good, but hey... it was $1.29. What did I expect? I am worried, however, that I won't be able to finish all 32 ounces."
"Twisted the top off the 40oz clear bottle with freshness dae of Jan 11, 06. The color of the beer doesnt look so bad, but that because of the wide bottle. First sip was from bottle as i think this is the natural way for the style. More flavor than i expected, but not exaclty a good thing. Alcohol is present, and gives it a fuller mouthfeel. A malty sweetness and lots of grains in this one. I feel guilty for reviewing this beer because i could be spending my time reviewing a beer worth reviewing. But this isnt as bad as i thought it would be. for $1.50 this isnt a beer i would get again, but if i had to choose this or a 40oz. bud for a dollar more, i might pick the bargain. nuff said on this crap."
"Served at extremely cold. Head is actually gross looking. Looks like soap bubbles. Served from 32 oz non returneable bottle. Smells like burnt nastiness. Tastes like cardboard. It really does. Very fizzy. After a few sips it tastes like cardboard dubbed with dogcrap."
"A beer made for the afroamericans consumers, without offense, is rare in my country, only sold in usa, i buy in the border, appearance, smell and drinkability its over the average, its taste is rich in sugar flavor, mouthfeel different like a german malt liquor, not recommended with food, only with buddies."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-four ounce aluminum can, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Watered down taste. I'm surprised to see it is 5.9% as it seems like I'm drinking a glass of juice. It has the mouthfeel of carbonated apple juice mixed 50/50 with water. finishes with an off corn flavor and its gone. Towards the end of this 40 it gets syrupy and is almost undrinkable as it warms. Avoid."
"Oh, how bad. This is the second worst malt liquor I have had in my life. Skunky and rotten, high abv and cloying in every sene of the words. Cliche yellow color, aroma and taste make you gag. Very bad, this is definitely a can of beer to get drunk with on a budget. (Roughly $1.19 a 24 oz. can)"
"This beer pours a very light straw colored yellow. It looks like water with a little food coloring to it. The head is white and lifeless. It fades very quick leaving no laces. The first thing I think of when I smell this stuff is rotting sewage. It smells like rotton corn and dirty water. I dont smell any hops. I dont smell any redeaming qualities at all. I am slightly scared to taste this stuff again. First taste isnt too bad. Not good by any means, but not as bad as I expected. It has a corn flavor. I guess that would be because it is made with corn. It is not hoppy at all. I detect absolutely no spicy flavor. Also, I cant taste any malty flavors. It tastes very much like everything that Anheuser-Busch makes. This beer is carbonated decently, I guess. It would, in my opinion, make an awfull session beer. I will probably never drink it again. It is low in alcohol, though, so to those that like Anheuser-Busch products, it might be a good session beer. I know I used to drink 4 or 5 40's in a night, much to my regrets in the morning. I would recomend staying away from this one. Stick to urine. It probably tastes better."
"Pale yellow color with a thin lace for a head. A lot of carbonation. Smells like sweet corn and a bit of grassy grains. Light bodied. Taste like sweet corn and grassy grains. Has a warm alcohol effect. Hmmm.... well this beer was the first beer I had ever tasted (and that was when I was about 12). Not much has changed since then. If you want a cheap buzz with minimal flavor then this is your beer."
"The names king cobra, and i gotta agree, this stuff looks pretty poisonous. Comes in a 24 ounce can, never the sign of a quality brew. Smells like snake venom. Holy smokes, the taste is rough. Damn ive admittedly had some extremely bad beers, but this one is probably as bad as they get (excluding cave creek of course). After further consideration, beside the cave creek this is hands down the worst beer that i have had. It sinks its fangs in you deep and trys to kill you"
"Tastes like liquid corn. Really not a whole lot to this one, as far as flavor. Still, the bare fact that it doesn't taste outright putrid is something to be proud of with a malt Liquor. Could be a lot worse. Basically, tastes like one of Anheuser-Busch's standard offerings, only with the alcohol jacked up."
"King Cobra should die a quick and painless death (I'm not completely heartless). Where's a pissed off mongoose when you need one?"
"Drinkability - I can't see it. This may have it's contingent, perhaps the diehard A-B crowd. From the can it's not bad, but it's lifeless for any purpose beyond basic inebriation."
"By the way, King Cobra has the ugliest beer bottle I have ever seen. It has a dark snakeskin design on the label, with unatractive lettering. I guess its actually about perfect for this type of beer."
"The appearance of this stuff, is a faint golden, smell was hard to detect at 1st, I practically had to dip my nose in the stuff, but what I came out with was a faintly fruity, sweet smell, taste was not that good,had a real interesting aftertaste, could't put my finger on it, but a hint of licorice, mouthfeel was highly carbonated and slightly creamy, drinkability, not too great, I wouldn't recommend it, but if your just looking for a cheap buzz, then, not bad,(God it's been a rough week!)"
"Not a beer I would buy again..but t tell the truth its an OK malt liquor..better than Budweiser."
"Drinkable like a Budweiser, but Budweiser Ice tastes much better."
"This beer was best served from the old opaque brown bottle (why they switched to a clear bottle is beyond me, maybe because of its, surprisingly, almost-appealing golden color.) Smells slightly sour, like the malt has gone bad. Tastes like the re-brewed swill off the top of a vat of Michelob (rumor has it, it is.) Highly carbonated, it's only saving graces are that it's fairly ""smooth"" for a a malt liquor, and it won't give you the runs like Old English."
"This beer is best not tasted. Its basically piss in a bottle. There is not much else to say about it. The only real reason to drink this is for a joke or something. It works if your going for thug appeal. Of course that only works If you are drinking it from a 40 oz bottle."
"No after taste, no personality."
"And on the 8th day, as a joke, God created King Cobra and then he laughed. What is this evil liquid. Being on a 40oz kick as I had been, I tried this poison and well, I didn't really care for it. The color was a yellow (#9) type color. The smell was a bit pungent but not scary. Then came the taste.. It has a real copper penny like taste ( like blood almost). It is plain nasty. Only a booze hound sitting on the corner of the old Woolworths on Washington st near down town crossing could enjoy this, but I'd toss him the extra buck to get the St. Ides."
"It's an interesting brew because it's fairly well done, yet it doesn't hit the mark. It's subdued enough that at first sip it seems almost like a regular beer, yet it quickly turns to show many of the negatives associated with the malt liquor style. It's a little bit more drinkable than some due to it's less sweet nature; yet it offers less character - an odd ""Catch-22"". Faced with a double-doored cooler full of malt liquors, I think I'd look for something else first."
"This stuff is dirt cheap, and there is a legitimate reason why. Light Gold color, strong odor of malt, and a taste similar to what i imagine rotting corn to taste like. This may be good for college students looking to get a buzz when short on cash, but i think outside of that, it's a waste of money."
"They say a cobra's bite is deadly, but I think it's the taste with this crap. I could barely finish a 1/4 of the can before I felt like hurling. It gives you a buzz right away, but so does exhaust fumes. Next time I'll just stick my head in the oven."
"after sampling a few malt liquors, and tasting a few that weren't half bad....i've found one that's real bad....King Cobra.  this is a lame excuse for a beer, not to mention not even living up to malt liquor standards. at least the other malt liquors had SOME character.  this has no aroma, no head, no taste, no alcohol kick, no life.  i've always been shy about ripping on anheuser-busch because i actually like and drink quite a bit of budweiser, but KC is truly crap beer. ranks down at the bottom with busch and natural light.   HORRIBLE!"
"Notes: The name says it all and who they are marketing for. As for the quality? If you like to drink flavourless beer with a kick of alcohol this is for you."
