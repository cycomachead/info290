"A totally crummy beer that tastes like liquid aluminum and smells like it too. But hey it was 99 cents. Wouldn't buy it again unless I had only a dollar to my name though."

"It's a cheap Malt Liquor, pretty much just a session beer. Tastes exactly like the price would lead you to assume. This is more of an ""I want to get drunk"" kind of beer than a fancy, tasty beer, but at 99 cents for a 24 ounce can, can you really argue with it?"

"Hands down the worst beer I have ever had. Try it for a review, that's about it."

"O - This is a pretty tame malt liquor. It is weaker tasting than most. It goes down easy and was a great way to celebrate today's holiday."
"O - Overall, pretty much a nice big load of garbage. Perhap s SLIGHTY above Steel reserve."

"O - worth a try for the price and nostalgia if you remember the original Crazy Horse Malt Liquor."
"You can't really go wrong for the price although it IS a completely forgettable beer. Cheers!"
"D - 99cents for 24oz. Maybe paid a bit too much. An extra 50 cents gets you more flavor and more abv."

"O: Drinkability was a bit hesitant, not very smooth, comes in a bit subpar per style."
"Harsh astringent feel, a winning combination of coarse overcarbonation and sharp astringent grape/apple flavors. This needs to be consumed with pretzels or something to cleanse the palate immediately, the aftertaste is taunting my gag reflex. Wet manila folders, grape juice, communion wine. Watery and fizzy, a flaccid and utterly bland industrial lager. Not planning to finish the rest of this."
"The seventh entry in SwillFest 2011. It pours a clear straw topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises harsh vanilla and cream soda, wheat, and corn syrup. Hoofah, indeed! The taste unfortunately brings in more of the same, though the corn syrup is slightly sweeter and there's a bit of light wheat thrown in for good measure. Well, good is a strong word. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dryly syrupy feel. Overall, a malt lickah that wants to be a cream ale, but instead fails at both professions."
"This is pale golden. There is corn smell on the nose. I really think this is truly a sad excuse for anything close to tasting good. The flavor is pretty terrible. Lots of adjuncts. It's really really hard to swallow this beer and I don't think that there is too many individuals who would willingly want this whole thing for themselves."
"As much trash as I talk about this beer, there is no beating the price. At $0.99 for a 24oz can, it might even be cheaper than the Walgreens beer, Big Flats."
"Clear piss yellow brew, frothy white head has decent retention. Smells semi-sweet with a bit of skunky lemongrass hop and metal. Taste isn't all that bad, surprisingly. Light and crisp, a bit of grainy sweetness, mild lemon pulp hop. Thin and very very chuggable. Not much malt character, more like a semi-sweet beer soda."
"For what it is, this is unbelieveably drinkable. Decent flavor, goes down well, and super cheap. It's the malt liquor trifecta. This was the highlight and unanimous favorite of my recent malt liquor tasting. One craft drinker, one macro drinker that can enjoy a craft, and one just getting into beer."
"A rocky finger of bone-white head with decent retenion. Color was a deep, golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a very mellow taste. I really enjoyed its smooth, unobtrusive dance acoss my tongue. The finish reminded me of a Ceeam Ale, Good."
"Poured from a can into a weizen glass. Has a rich golden color with a reddish hue to it and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is fairly pleasant, a little sweet. I was looking foward to my first sip. Well the taste is not so good. Almost like bitter corn. This beer is also bitter in the mouth. I struggled to finish my 24 oz. can. Not a good beer at all."
"Pale yellow with a big foamy head that quickly recedes into a skim. Smell is grits and faint toasted grain. Tastes sweet upfront with spent grain in the finish. Medium bodied and not really a good malt liquor IMO, I'm guessing the ABV is fairly low for the style, somewhere in the 5-6% range. More like a cheap ""ice"" beer than malt liquor to my taste buds."
"mouthfeel is crisp and corny, aftertaste leaves something to be desired but far from the worst malt liquor i've had."
"I've had better malt liquors."
"Take a ride, but don't let it gallop away."
"Notes: I remember the name change and I remember that Bed-Stuy was upset as I had friends there and when it was pulled it did not go over well. I was a young punk and I was just as upset. Looking back,I realize that the beer should have never existed. A cheap shot and I would never think of buying or drinking this again."
"Malt liquor tallboy, pours a clear amber with fast fading head, no lacing. Smell: raw corn on the cob, touch of malt and alcohol. Taste: grainy and malty, apples. Mouthfeel: thin but crisp with a sharp rush of carbonation. This is not a bad tasting malt liquor."
"benders. Swill for the person on a budget."
"Drinkability: I mustn't let the Crazy Stallion win, I mustn't let it beat me, but I'm afraid I'm done for. Ugh."
"There's something about this malt liquor. It isn't too high in ABV, so doesn't taste like gasoline like other malt liquors. In fact, the taste is smooth and it goes down fine. Unfortunately, even though this is a decent 40 (I was wondering why they changed the name until I read the review of the lawsuit) I am not feeling well now after drinking it, hurting its drinkability."
"I haven't yet thought about the specific numbers, much less added them up, but my gut tells me Crazy Stallion fades on the final turn and loses at the wire. Neither one of these beers is all that wonderful, possibly because the ABV isn't high enough for some serious malt liquor action. I tend to like the 'no holds barred' versions of this style the best. In short, Crazy Horse could stand to be a lot more crazy."
"From a 40 oz bottle split with PiecesOfFlair. Pours out to a medium orange golden color with a spit-like head. No lace. I can't smell anything. Maybe some malt? I can't tell. Taste is tolerable but far from enjoyable. Light sour malt, sweet alcohol, corn. Ugh. Mouthfeel is rather rich but doesn't make up for the poor flavor. Drinkability is questionable. A decent malt-liquor, but does that really give you any indication of how good it is? Pass on it, unless you must."
"drinkability is high for a four-o and although i poured this into a glass, i like the wide mouth bottle for future opportunities to suck down a bottle out of the brown bag. oh yeah."
"Another contender in Malt Liquorpalooza 2006. This ML poured out very watery looking with a big old white head. smell was predictably skunky, cornwater like. taste was metallic and sour, alcohol laced. full bodied, but in a way that was disconcerting considering its a malt liquor and you expect those to be pretty thin and easy drinking. no more crazy stallion for me please."
"Drinkability - thirst quenching with food, but not especially tasty or complementary."
"Crazy Stallion, whose name offends me way less than Crazy Horse, ain't too bad. It is somewhat better in a bottle, but most recently I've drank a few 16oz. cans of it. It is one of the cheapest beers available, ounce for ounce, here in scenic Bed-Stuy. Its got a bit of a sharp, off-taste component to its basic malt liquor adjunct-funk, but nothing to whine about. It might just have you digging in your couch cushions and putting your shoes back on."
"Very carbonated, thick and greasy, high alcohol and little balance makes this a tough one to drink, although not as bad as anticipated."
"They should've called it Wyld Stalyn, to capitalize on all that PR the could get from associating themselves with Bill and Ted. I also read somewhere that this stuff was orignally called ""Crazy Horse"" and featured a picture of a native american on the can, but it was deemed offensive for some reason, and got changed to a horse (but they kept the hairstyle)."
"Crazy Horse's color is honey golden. Head is weak. Smell is malty with an apple aroma mixed in. Taste is malty and kinda full-flavored for a malt liquor. There really isn't much to say here, just that this is a little bit better than the standard malt liquors on the market."
"Couldn't drink it though... something about it just wouldn't let me. Just couldn't bring myself to down it."
"Above average for a malt liquor."
"Wow, forty ounces of Crazy Horse I thought this beer was a joke when I saw it, and thought to myself there's no way hell that it's any good. The label reminded me of the Arizona Iced Tea bottles and according to Nero's review I guess they are the ones who are responsible for the bottling here. Appears a golden with a white frothy shot lived head leaving minimal lacing. As far as the aroma goes it's light but there are some nice tones here sweet grain, very clean subtle floral notes possibly some hops in there. Taste is very solid I'd imagine there is some alcohol considering the malt liquor label but it's probably the cleanest tasting malt liquor I have ever tasted sweet rolling flavor some fruit edged tones in there and not a bad beer simple light refreshing best of all no gag reflex occurs with each sip. Mouthfeel is extremely thin no texture to this beer even smooth carbonation in the sense that it's not too harsh on the throat with each gulp of this bad boy. Drinkability for a college student like myself if I'm going for the buzz this maybe an option in the future under two bucks I can't complain solid malt liquor no off flavors and refreshing plus I like the bottle and the name...Crazy Horse...Oh yeah!!!!"
"(40oz bottle)Pours a deep golden color, leans towards a dark golden. Decent frothy white head. Not to much that stands out on the nose, some malty aromas. Fairly smooth on the palate, slightly fruity, slight nuttiness, grainy maltiness, sweet, actually its pretty decent. Decent american malt-liquor brew...."
"40 oz wide-mouth, screw-cap bottle. Contract brewed for Ferolito, Vultaggio & Sons - the people that brought you Arizona Iced Teas. They're more of a marketing company than a beverage producer, so it's interesting that they'd invest in packaging for a beer style that's mainly consumed wrapped in a brown paper bag. However, the beer pours a surprisingly rich golden colored body topped by a full, frothy bright white head that holds OK but eventually drops to just a minor collar and a flat surface. The aroma expresses a lightly fruity (apples) and gently nutty but solid maltiness. The alcohol is only minimally noticeable. A firm body combines with a fine and moderate carbonation for a smooth and mildly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor mimics the aroma: lightly fruity with a clean, sweet, and grainy maltiness. A strong percentage of adjunct is clearly used, allowing the beer to maintain its firm body but not be overwhelmed with true rich malt flavor. Bittering hops are barely present, and there is no noticeable hop flavor or aroma. Very well done, just smooth and clean sweet malt with a well hidden alcohol (although it can build on you after 20 ounces or so). A surprisingly well done malt liquor, but a little sweet on the palate."
