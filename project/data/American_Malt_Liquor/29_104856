We tried to chase it and mix it but we found the only thing it tastes good with is orange juice. I gave it away to a neighbor who loves those rita's and she said it was bad I would never buy it again nor try the other flavors because of how bad it was","Elaineblo","Mar 08, 2015"

Taste is also dominated by sweet cranberry notes with have more in similar with syrup than actual cranberry. Body is light with spritzy carbonation. Not sure how much beer is really used in this drinks?","Phyl21ca","Dec 23, 2014"

I'm still astounded at how far AB-InBev has to take things before BA treats them like they do craft ciders.","biboergosum","Beers"

The smell is all sugar with some cranberry and lime scents coming through. The taste was very similar with so much sugar it made my teeth hurt after a few sips. I found the aftertaste to be a big turn off. At least the mouthfeel was thin enough and it wasn't too syrupy.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 19, 2014"

2.18,-6.4,2.5,2,2.25,2,2.25,"The loud Crack! told me that it had not lost any of its carbonation since I initially bought it, but given that there was going to be 25 (!) fl. oz. of it, the Glug would not be inverted. Watching it pour into my glass caused me to involuntarily let out a guffaw of laughter. It was magenta! OMFG! It fizzed like soda pop, quickly reducing its head to nothingness, leaving me with a glass filled with what I CAN only describe as looking like beet juice (SRM = N/A), but with great clarity. It did not smell like beet juice, however. It smelled like cranberry jelly on the table at Thanksgiving at my maternal Grummy's house every year when I was growing up. I just could not help but laugh again. It is very difficult to take a beer such as this seriously. Mouthfeel was thin, but fizzy, very much like soda pop. More laughter. The taste was very tart, very much like cranberry and with the addition of lime, it was like drinking alum. I do not think that I will be playing the trumpet right after I am done with this. My lips were puckered harder than last summer, when the Old Lady put me on an eastbound train, possibly out of her life forever. Oh no! This beer is causing melancholia to set in and there was no warning on the label! Finish was reminiscent of a SweeTart CANdy. It had both a sweetness and a tartness, with the emphasis on tart. It was not ""Awful"" as it seems to be currently rated, but neither was it something that I would want to drink a second time. It was like fizzy Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice Cocktail.

The aroma is of faint cranberries with a hint of lime but no grains. The taste wasn't too great. Like a cheap cranberry juice cocktail with some grain alcohol added. No 'beer' taste at all. On the tart side as would be excepted. If I wanted a Margarita, I would make one! :)","BeerWithMike","Dec 13, 2013"

2.77,18.9,2.5,3,2.75,2.5,2.75,"Overall, I can give props to flavor for really nailing the cranberry taste.

An interesting, and not bad, flavor for the holidays.","boilermakerbrew","Nov 08, 2013"
