5,83.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Its a shame most of the reviewers on this site don't understand high gravity american malt liquors, and therefore ignorantly feel inclined to stigmatize and trash them, comparing them with unrelated trendy craft beers. I ask the beer advocate community: please grow up. This is one of the best malt liquors on the market, and I've tried them all, it does everything its supposed to, and does it exceptionally well. A rational beer reviewer would put  well made strong american malt liquors in a similar category as Belgium trippels or German helles bocks: light body, light color, low IBU, delightfully strong, and chuggable! Surprisingly, V.S.L. is smoother than many expensive Belgium trippels, easier drinking than eisbocks, has no off flavors, not overly sweet or boozy, and theres no cheap beer headache hours after drinking. The body is light and crisp, the taste clean, in contrast to the often overly sweet, ester flawed, heavy bodies of many craft beer attempts at strong lagers or bocks. If you go in with preconceived notions this beer is cheap getto trash, based on the bandwagon of close minded novice  snobbery reviews, reconsider. This beer is an archetypical american classic. It doesnt matter if its low price, industrial, comes in a big garish can, or full of corn adjunct - it works, the balance is impeccable. I'll take this masterpiece any time over the endless boring heaps of over-priced over-rated craft hop bomb clones. If only craft brewers would embrace this remarkable beer style and give the hop bombs a rest already.","snuffconformists","Oct 21, 2014"

Larine 95 while not a great beer is better tasting than this beer, however this beer is better or more fairly priced. Alcholol content is comparable between the both. Let me say this about this beer. It is definitely not a full body or full flavored rich tasting beer. But then again it is a beer and is NOT bad tasting either. I would drink it again although probably it is not in my top 80 (yes I have had a lot of experience although I didn't rate beers for many decades). Try it don't shun it but do not expect a Duvel or Allagash but do not expect a bad beer either. It is ok and sometimes ok is fine and 8.5% ABV makes it better. And it advertises itself as a Very SMooth Lager which it is.","Wrigfen","Jun 04, 2013"

I can't understand why Schlitz felt that there was a need to make a beer to bridge the 8.2% ABV (Bull Ice) and 8.5% gap? At 9%+ this would be much more impressive. If I'd never had Bull Ice I'd find VSL to be much better, but unfortunately Bull Ice is one of my favorite high gravities and it kicks the hell out of this overall. I guess Schlitz made this to appeal to the high gravity drinker that appreciates a harsher taste?","troobie","Mar 24, 2012"

It is a highly agitated, carbonated pale yellow to off-gold with a goodly amount of fizzy head. The aroma is of corn and sweet malts with a crisp hop drop. It does not smell high in alcohol. The body is a little better than light but not quite medium. The taste has that bitter malt liquor taste but a bit more palatable than other malt liquors out there. An almost clean aftertaste. I said "almost" because there is a rather biting lingering effect. I rated this by style not by its craft.","puboflyons","Jun 23, 2011"

Sticks to the mouth in probably the most unpleasant way like drinking (not rinsing with) a glass of mouth wash, finishes with an alcohol tingle and perhaps stale beer funk like what i used to smell in my grandfathers basement. Overall, definitely not good. However not the worst high gravity I've had, decent if i was still in college and looking for a cheap pre-gamer buzz before a kegger or a night at the bar.","pezfiend","Jun 01, 2011"

Yup looks like a macro lager all right. Smells of sweet grainy malt with faint wisps of creamed corn and alcohol. Smells a little better than I thought it would. Taste is kind of what I expected, sweet grainy malts with maybe a hint of cherry or apricot. Really! Bitter alcohol burn into the finish. Lots and lots of bubbles, medium body with a sweet slick mouthfeel. Honestly if they put some hops in here it wouldn't be half bad. As is this serves its purpose, a cheap quick drunk.

Flavor is not too shabby, though - stronger and fuller than I expected, malty and fruity with a bit of a nip. It’s actually a little enjoyable!

It looks like a light beer. It's light yellowish gold. The smell is that of sweet metal. That's it. I was afraid to taste it, but was relieved when I did. It tasted much better than the smell. I'd even say it tastes better than all the high gravity lagers I've had other than OE HG800. It has a bitter taste that tastes lightly of metal. It really is quite smooth. Some alchol burn, but not until the aftertaste. It's somewhat sweet, but not cloyingly so. The nauseating bit is the taste of the actual malt. It's pretty bad. Within the category of malt liquor, this stuff's pretty bad. However, I think that modern "high gravity lagers" should not be considered in the same category. It's a totally different style and within that style, there are worse things for sure (ahem, Steel Reserve).","ElCommodoro","Mar 23, 2011"

Even low expectations have been dashed by the pain of being so very, very right about something being so very, very wrong. It's...it's just terrible. I don't know what to say. The sweetness is sadly dulled (that's right, I said sadly), and some brassy corn husk is left to beat my 'buds' faces in, Norris-style. My nipples are hard just drinking this horribility. The lickuh is palpable. The body is heavier than it should be, with a sharply moderate carbonation and a brutal finish.

There is a savior smell in the fact that maybe if there are hops in it, there is an orange/mango smell to the back, and only very faint. The taste is actually not as bad upfront as I would have expected, but that doesn't make it pleasant. The liquor taste is akin to a terrible Sake. It isn't horrid and appalling. Wait...I take that back. This is progressively harder to drink as I go along. Making me wish that hadn't just said those things. The mouthfeel is syrupy and unpleasant...very smooth my ass!

The flavors were at first a hint of bitterness, quickly followed by some generic sweetened malt, hints of bananas in the fruity alcohol esters and yeasty notes. The flavors turned south as it warmed and the finish was a little metallic. Still for 8.5% the punch is well hidden; I found it hard to deny the 'Very Smooth' part, as far as malts liquors go. The mouthfeel was medium/full and slick and the carbonation subtle but again pretty good for the style. Y'all may think I'm crazy for writing it, but for the Malt Liqour style this one is very good.
