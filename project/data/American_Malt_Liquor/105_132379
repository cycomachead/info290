My Brother In Law brought an ice cold 12 pack of these and we just sort of started drinking them.  There is a slight metallic or artificial taste that sort of hinders the ""apple-y-ness"" of this beer (Is it really beer?) but... on the plus side, they go down pretty fast & after a two or three of them in the morning, who cares?","brywhite","Feb 24, 2015"

It pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of short-lived dirty-white foam.  The nose comprises bushels of apples: some of them seemingly artificial, some seemingly genuine; some sweet, some sour-leaning.  Cider style, baby.  The taste brings in more of the same, a hint of booze occasionally making itself evident.  There's a bit of corn syrup foundation-ing the situation as well, if you catch my drift.  The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slick feel.  Overall, not a bad vehicle for booze delivery, really; thoroughly reminiscent of a thicker-than-usual cider and totally drinkable.","TMoney2591","Feb 11, 2015"

This is an example of a beer that I enjoy that is absolutely mediocre (or less) in every category. It's very sweet and sour at the same time, while maintaining an alcoholic burn.

Pretty much same for the taste ,nice and crisp. Not as sweet as you might think, but good. Lighter bodied with good carbonation.

2.75,-3.8,,,,,,"So, all that being said, it actually is somewhat enjoyable.  It's definitely more of a hard cider than an ale like it claims to be, and I'd prefer Angry Orchard or original Redd's, but it's not that bad.  The taste is actually very good; sour and crisp, the aftertaste is just a bit much.  It's like they injected extra alcohol into each can just for the sake of high schoolers who want something cheap to get drunk on.  But I'd buy it again if it was on sale.","sth550","Sep 30, 2014"
3.5,22.4,,,,,,"I wanted to write a review for this because I felt that many people prior had the assumption that this drink is something that it is not. Clearly, we cannot compare this Redd's to Heady Topper or any other traditionally brewed beer for that matter, but it really succeeds at doing what it has attempted to do. Plainly, this is an unoffensive and easy drinking alternative to traditional beer. I really can't get over the fact that people keep deriding this due to the fact that it is too ""sweet"" since it actually has the same or less calories per abv than other options in its alcohol class. Consequently, I would categorize this ""sweetness"" as more of a sour taste, and I think it is much more comparable to a granny smith apple taste than a traditional red. In the end, when I want to switch things up from drinking multiple craft beers, this Redd's provides great taste while very effectively masking its high alcohol content. It is by no means perfect, but I would certainly reach for a Redd's over any of the myriad of competing adjunct lagers considering that it effectively brings a unique change of pace to the table.","Nostradrunkus","Sep 30, 2014"

Smell is of straight apple cider. Taste is bold and hits you quickly with a crisp apple cider / sweet apple juice flavor. As I said, can barely taste the alcohol. The carbonation is a bit high and the MF is a bit thin,l other than that it's pretty decent. Probably will buy again.","Lordhelmit","Sep 06, 2014"

I am no drinker of apple brews as of the late trend to be that has revived the lost apple cider trend that has died and rotted away, seemingly in a deserving fashion. I am just not. But this. This affordable concoction delicious perfection. It is good...As the drinker of ailments that I am, I've offered a little of my time to this ""trend of sorts"" to see what these ciders and ales bring to the table. Most have disappointed and sickened me, including wasted my time and money that could've been merely doubled for a hopsy I.P.A. Then I picked this one up at a gas station. 2.37$. It was warm. Put it on ice. It tastes like a tangy Apple Cider. That is what it should taste like. If you drink Apple Cider, do you feel anything but loneliness and high blood sugar?? Then don't expect much more with this witchly brew of high. It is cheap apple couch syrup that is satisfying to anyone who is sick minded enough to try it and even sicker to complain about it.","Heckpole-schpeckmole","Aug 26, 2014"

I poured half a can into a Samuel Adams glass, it looked dark amber and smelled like sweet apples. Taste was like a thickish apple juice. A little too sweet and thick for me. I guess that masks the alcohol. One can was enough. I won't be buying any more as I like a lighter, less sweet apple cider or ale. This would go with spicy Szechuan or Mexican food.","hopmashian","0"
