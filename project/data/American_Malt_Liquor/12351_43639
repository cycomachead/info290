3.83,11.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall this is a little on the sweet side for me but it is more or less what i'm looking for in a high abv lager. Its refreshing and not that heavy but has tons of flavor.","d4114","Jun 19, 2011"
2.35,-31.7,2.5,2.5,2,3,2.5,"O - Ugh, whatever, I don't know why we kept doing this. This is okay for a malt liquor, meaning is just plain sucks instead of royally sucking.","AgentZero","Apr 08, 2011"
3.18,-7.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"D - I found this surprisingly enjoyable. It wasn't as good as the Dogfish or Midnight Sun offerings, but it was a passable high-gravity lager.","MasterSki","Apr 07, 2011"
3.34,-2.9,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Overall this is a decent beer. For an American style lager it's pretty good. I don't know that I would drink this again over any of the thousands of amazing ales that are out there. Come to think of it, I can't imagine why I would drink this beer again. I like the beer, don't get me wrong, it's just not exciting so there is no reason to come back. This may be a good craft brew for people just getting into craft brews or transitioning from American style lagers.","aknight","Feb 19, 2011"
2.95,-14.2,3,3,3,2.5,3,"O - An interesting study in imperial beers. Really, this would be much better with a lower ABV and more attention to taste vs. gimmick. Worth trying but not really worth having a spare bottle. Might age it a little but the style isn't known for getting any better...","Dijeriduster","Nov 24, 2010"
3.49,1.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Not what you'd want a tankard of, but it's an interesting glass of something strong and sweet, minus the Belgian musk of a golden ale.","mactrail","Sep 09, 2010"
2.71,-21.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"D: This is a drinkable beer compared to cheap convenience store malt liquor, but not drinkable compared to any well conceived craft. I'd imagine this could be a good "gateway beer" if you were trying to convert a homeless person with a winning scratcher to something better, but it's not going to win anyone over who already appreciates the finer things.","portlandjeff","Jul 01, 2010"
3.12,-9.3,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Poured a light yellow-orange with a smallish head that dissipated completely. There was little or no lacing. Nose was caramel, lemon, pale malt and corn. Taste was boozy and sweet with elements of lemon, honey, caramel, and grains. Carbonation was light and it felt thin, though sticky. WHile a bit too sweet and thin for me to drink much of this, it wasn't awful. I admit I wasn't expecting much here, so it is not a shock that it wasn't as bad as I expected. Like most, a malt liquor was last tried in high school when friends wanted to get drunk and could care less why or how and certainly didn't care about anything tasting good.","regspeir","May 07, 2010"
3.79,10.2,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"As far as this beer goes, it is a good example of a craft malt liquor, or as Lightning is calling it "Pre-Prohibition Style" but basically anything over 8% with a substantial amount of adjuncts is a malt liquor in my book. In which case, this is on the better side of most, but I wouldn't exactly call this a tasty beverage either.","vacax","Apr 20, 2010"
3.28,-4.7,4,3.5,3,4,3,"D - Not so sure I want too much more of this. I have another bomber. Maybe I can divvy it up with some camping buddies next weekend.","Kaiser81","Nov 15, 2008"
3.53,2.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: Definitely one of the best malt liquors available. Usually I drink them for the novelty, but this wasn't all that bad.","womencantsail","Aug 28, 2008"
3.68,7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Ionizer Lager is the best beer that I've had from this brewery yet. The fact that it's hard to categorize makes it somewhat intriguing. And even though there's no real flavor hook, I'm enjoying the hell out of the bomber. Must be the alcohol talking. Note to the brewers: give some serious thought to Belgian yeast. Trust me.","BuckeyeNation","Aug 18, 2008"
3.7,7.6,3,3,4,4,4,"D- This is a sneaky little bugger. atch out, it drinks quick and easy but packs a whollop!","opwog","Jul 09, 2008"
3.68,7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A pre-prohibition lager, huh? Interesting. If that's indeed malt liquor, this isn't my first encounter. It is a little reminiscent of my memory of malt liquors, but it's quite a bit better than those. As a whole, it's a pretty decent beer. Some of the corn flavor could be backed down. That'd be an immediate improvement. But, it's definitely worth a try.","prototypic","Jul 09, 2008"
3.38,-1.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Medium body with plenty alcohol, a sweet craft malt-liquor that rivals any American Macro, if you like em sah-weeet, this brew is for you.","scottoale","Beers"
4.3,25,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is moderate, thickly sweet lager that almost feels Belgian-ish, even at 8%abv there is good balance and flavor going on here, very unique style of beer, I was pleasantly surprised!","Stoneman78","0"
