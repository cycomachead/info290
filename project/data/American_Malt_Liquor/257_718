A 4 on smell because it didn't smell like corn to me. It gets a 5 for taste I really like the taste, my first impression was a fruity flavor, then it went to a malty taste, I did not find it bitter at all but thats because I drink Irish beer regularly, it did not remind me of malt liquor at all. I gave it a 2 for feel it was very watery to me, over all I rate it a 4 because of the color. The lady at the package store told me that stuff is evil! lmao! Will I buy this again yes I will, It taste very good with a bowl of chili, they paired up wonderfully!

That being said, for malt liquor, Steel Reserve is one of my favorites. Granted I only drink it when the bank account has more dust in it than dollars, but I must admit that it does have qualities that I enjoy. For starters, it has a nice light amber color, and bubbles like a champagne. The taste is fairly clean and crisp for a malt, and the aftertaste is not bad at all. This one will give you a nasty hangover, though, if you drink too much of it. Enjoyed best while still ice cold.","-Hoptimus_Prime-","Mar 17, 2015"

It really is drinkable though, and doesn't get all flat and skunky faster than you can drink it like other malt liquors in 40 oz. form. I don't know. In a pinch, I would take this over some really crappy so-called craft beers, put it that way, but it's malt liquor and you know what the score is.","31Sam13","Mar 15, 2015"

5,111.9,5,5,5,5,5,"It's an Apples and Oranges test if you compare Steel Reserve to highly delicate crafted micro brews. In fact it's insulting to make the comparison in the first place. However having said that, and after taking another glorious gulp of my 24 oz Steel Reserve, it's a great beer if you just rate itself and forget all the other legends. For starters it's a acquired taste of strong and bold rich barely, sweet and bitter all at the same time. The After taste is also need of acquiring. Luckily I have acquired all of the above. Price point is unbeatable, for $1.50 not too shabby (You won't go bankrupt with this financial decision). The high alcohol content of 8.1% is mind blowing (You won't get that same effect with say coors light or bud). I've coined the nickname ""A Quick Cheap Drunk"" :p . Best way to drink this like almost all good beers, ""ICE COLD."" . ""It's a Mans Beer," my girlfriend doesn't understand why I love it so much (even though she likes drinking some of the worst hard alcohol on the planet). BACK STORY  It's the beer I have grown up with, when I was once a poor country boy. I continue to drink in delight :) (You heard me right), I steel love it after all the other hand crafted beers I have been opened up to throughout the years. It's beer and it get's me in gear so have no fear. I shout out, ""I love steel reserve beer."" with an all out cheer :D","Tastebuds","Mar 12, 2015"

I'm surprised that my yellow beer in my blue glass doesn't  look green that defys science so its got that going for it. I don't smell much of anything to write about when I take a whiff. Goes down pretty smooth, with a tad bit of beer flavor. I really like the 8.10% effect, I wish they could all be 8% and up for so cheap. Oh whoops, I spoilled the best part its really cheap,  $1.29 for 16oz. One will do it,  two will make it hard to write a review with no spelling errors. So will I get it again? Oh yeah, sometimes its fun to ride a moped. We just don't want anyone to see us. This is what people who dont drink beer think all beer tastes like. It also reminds me why i like warstiener, bocks, and dopple bocks. I have to go  scratch my belly and yell at my cat now.

3.28,39,,,,,,"When it comes to malt liquor I grade on taste alone, because malt liquor is meant to be SLAMED. “Slow brewed for exceptional smooth flavor”. You can always tell how good a malt liquor is by the amount of lies on the can. All right here we go. What the hell man? I just opened the can and I didn’t get the snake hiss I’m so accustomed to. Damn I can smell the alcohol running from the can like the devil is chasing it. Ok, sucked down ¼ of the can and it taste like a green apple jolly rancher. I’ve literally had 100’s of 211’s and this is the first time it didn’t taste like malt liquor, sweet gasoline ,and heat. I must have a bad can. Which raises the question, do bad cans of 211 get better with age? Alright round 2, here we go…. Ughhhh never mind I take it all back. I just killed the can and it’s fighting me back causing ripples of chills throughout my body. This is the taste I’m accustoming to…. Alcohol and a funk that shifts its flavor so fast you don’t know what the hell you’re drinking. This is definitely an acquired taste. The reason why I like 211 is because it floods my mind with memories of Jr High. It’s like time traveling back to the time when all we could afford was 40oz’s and tall cans. Overall it taste awful. But the memories I’ve had with this shit keeps me coming back. I mean come-on this was my first taste of independence. 211 delivers a hard ass buzz for only 8.1% ABV","corywalston","Oct 21, 2014"

I would drink it again but with many better products out there I would not go out of my way. It is an OK beer at an OK price. Try it for yourself but do not expect a full flavored rich beer.

Certainly not my favorite drink by any means, but it has served its purpose in the past. First thing that stands out is the lack of carbonation. This quality really allows the drinker to down cans at top speed. This helps since the taste of the beer is excessively sweet and not something you'd want to take your time to enjoy. That being said, the moderate presence of hops in the flavor keep it from becoming sickly sweet. The drinkability of this beer is actually fairly decent for a malt liquor owing to its smoothness going down. The presence of alcohol is fairly strong in both smell and taste, but for a beer of it's type, Its fair to say drinkers of malt liquor wont be complaining at this aspect. The price is also very inexpensive and combined with high gravity, the only decent points of the drink.","Ruffio","Mar 08, 2011"

There's not much in the way of flavor, but I'd say that about 90% of the beers you can find in a convenience store. It's drinkable for a malt liquor, doesn't have the vomitty aftertaste of Coors and hopefully wouldn't give me the sniffles like Budweiser does.

The body is actually a quite attractive pale gold that turns amber when the glass passes in from of any solid background. The head is big bubbled and short-lived, as the fat bubbles fizz away until there's no head at all after a couple of seconds. The bubbles rising from the sides of the glass are abnormally large. The head counteracts the relatively attractive body color, though. The aroma actually has a bit of peppery hops up front. I find no trace of malt however. The flavor lacks bitterness but picks up a toasted cornmeal/cornhusk quality that reminds me of the cornmeal coating of a tamale. It really let me down.

The aroma has that kind of galvanized steel / vegetable smell that you get a lot in adjunct beers - no real maltiness or hops to speak off. The flavor is dominated by the corn sweetness but you also get some malt behind it and a slight amount of hops, but not enough to balance.

1.63,-30.9,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,"this was a rough one. ghetto juice almost too bad to handle. malt beyond belief and a just nasty taste in general. then again, what is the purpose of a malt liquor. thick and sweet, yet skunky. mouthfeel is hard to even recognize while battling the taste. i think this one makes other malt liquors look like top notch craft brews.","ElGuapo","Jul 11, 2002"
1.63,-30.9,2,1.5,1.5,2.5,1.5,"Clear, light golden in color. Minimal head and little lace. Heavily carbonated.  Somewhat sweet tasting with strong alcohol taste.  Medium bodied with mouth coating mouthfeel. Finishes sweetly alcoholic.","psugrad98","Jun 10, 2002"
2.79,18.2,2,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Oh the Steel...truly high gravity...it will push you down until you hit the floor. It has quite a high kick at 8.1%, but when had cold is very drinkable. I remember that one night I quickly pounded two Steel 40's...oh wait, no I dont remember that night. That's the power of the Steel.","IrishRedRock","Apr 23, 2002"
1.18,-50,2,1.5,1,1,1,"I know that the alcohol per dollar ratio is great, but avoid this like the plague.  Even among malt liquors, Steel Reserve is one of the worst beverages out there.  It tastes like gasoline and will rip your stomach in two.  Drink a Liquid Plumber and ammonia cocktail before you drink Steel Reserve.  For the love of God stay the hell away!","KingSpank","Apr 19, 2002"
1.83,-22.5,2.5,2,1.5,2,2,"Its been a long time since I've sampled malt liquor, but I decided to pick up a 40 O.Z. of somthing and dive right in. I decided on Steel Reserve 211 and yes, I drank it straight from the bottle. At 8.1%, I was feelin' the alcohol about halfway down the bottle. This stuff smells slightly skunky, but I couldn't tell if it was because of the of the clear bottle or because its SUPPOSED to be that way. This tastes slightly sweet, rather light and finishes up with a swallow that lets you know this thing has alcohol in it. Was it good? No. Was it bad? Yeah, it was bad. But I had a buzz going after drinking it and I must say, I have had alot worse, both macro and micro-wise. Peace out, time to wash the hoopty and catch some NCAA b-ball.","proc","Mar 18, 2002"
3.66,55.1,4,3,4,3,4,"Notes: One of the most drinkable malt liquors I have tasted, one of the more alcoholic ones I have run into also. Even when it warms up a bit it does not get ghastly like other malt liquors do.","Jason","Sep 12, 2001"
