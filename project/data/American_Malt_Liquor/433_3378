2.18,-23.2,3,2.5,2,2,2,"Reviewed on 7/21/09. Bottle. Pours a clear gold with a white head. Aroma of pale lager malt, cardboard, wheat malt. Flavor is pretty plain, wheat/cardboard malt and sweet sugars. I suppose it is better than the original pale lagers but obviously is not a good product.","LilBeerDoctor","Sep 30, 2008"
2.53,-10.9,2.5,2,2.5,3,3,"Drinkability is not nearly as bad as the other malt liquor's of the world I probably could have had another but didn't have anymore. All and all not really a must try but exactly horrible either.","TheFightfan1","Aug 21, 2008"
3.51,23.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a light golden with a thin white head. Good retention and pleanty of lacing. Aroma is of grain,and some hints of fruity grassy hops. Body is light andf very carbonated. Taste is of malty grains up front with a bit of hop in the finish. Refreshing. Not bad for what it is.","riversider76","Apr 08, 2008"
3.22,13.4,2.5,3,3,3.5,4,"This beer poured a coppery yellow with a thin single-finger head that lingered for a little while. The smell is a little subtle with some malt and perhaps some cereal. The taste is almost all malts with a hint hops and a little alcohol on the back end. The mouthfeel is thicker than I expected from a malt liquor with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable beer, that would likely grow progressively tastier as the night went on. Not something I would normally drink for pleasure, but not a bad choice if it's going to be one of those nights.","TheTrevor","Jan 25, 2008"
3.86,35.9,5,4,3.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: When this beer first hit my lips I was very surprised-this beer is full bodied!(well more full bodied than I expected at least-in terms of overall "beer styles" I'd say it has more of a medium-light body, but for the style it is much fuller than expected.) It finishes with a slightly drying finish. Carbonation is just right, medium levels give this beer a nice crisp, clean, and biting refreshment that one doesn't normally find in a macro. This is a beer that I'd definitely drink again, it is the best offering, in the category of a pale lager, that I've ever had from BMC(to date). If you have a chance to try this beer I highly recommend it, it will surprise you I think, it definitely surprised me.","becktone","Jun 25, 2007"
3.24,14.1,4,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Crystal clear, pale amber with a fine, off-white cap. Good head retention with spotty/streaky lacing. Grainy cereal aroma, fruity esters and hops. Low bitterness, a bit of caramel and grainy malt, fairly fruity. Light bodied with medium/high carbonation, a bit drying. Not bad and fairly good for a macro beer. One of the better Molson products I've had.","DrJay","Mar 06, 2007"

3.22,13.4,2.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Poured out a clear golden color with a foamy white head. The nose is subtle, slight honey notes, tiny bit of malt. The taste was nearly nonexistent, bit o honey, bit of spice. The mouthfeel was bright and bubbly, and being a close second cousin to mineral water, was amazingly and highly drinkable.","dherling","Oct 09, 2005"
2.78,-2.1,3,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Born north of the border. This is one of those beers that takes me back to more innocent days of hanging out in Windsor at the "ballet". This beer is about the same as all the other lagers that Molson puts out but the alcohol content is a little higher. Drink it cold. Once it warms up, it's truly crap. Not recommended unless your trying to get f#d up and don't want to lose your seat at the tip rail from going to the head a dozen times.","bacabuck","Jul 20, 2004"
3.28,15.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,4,"Not a bad beer in a pinch.... and being a malt.","FLAbeergutinMASS","Jul 21, 2003"
2.7,-4.9,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"I used to drink this stuff as an import from Quebec in the 70s when it had body and was 8% AVB.. Recently bought a couple of singles from the beer store....quite a letdown from the way I remember it. Poured like the typical Molson fizz...pale golden, carbonated, weak heading. More malt sweetness to the nose than most Molson slop, medium mouth feel with sweet malt acceted by a nice hop twang...fast finish but a nice bready after taste...alcohol is detectable. Not bad...not good....certainly not the way it was.","pootz","Oct 18, 2002"
2.38,-16.2,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Golden with a slight head. No smell except a little yeast. Great tasting if it remains icey cold, if not tis a wee bit skunky. No apparent hops or any malt. This used to be one of my favorite beers but now I'm a bit educated to tasting I realize this belongs in a "fotee" next to Schlitz, Cobra or even an MGD. If you are going to drink it, drink it fast. That alone says something about this.","Ahhdball","Apr 15, 2002"
2,-29.6,2,2,2,2,2,"When my friends suggest this I thought they were pulling my leg, but I guess there are hommies in Canada too. This gutter beer has nothing on it's American Counterparts. Drick it extremely cold and fast, unless you wnat to hurl.","bewareOFpenguin","Beers"
1.5,-47.2,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Despite the fact that this malt liquor has a rough alcohol taste to go along with a taste of burnt corn, I must wax nostalgic about it for a moment....Many trips were made over the border to the duty-free shop in Windsor, Ontario, in pursuit of this beverage in my youth and it did fine by me.  Now....back to the present.  Not a good beer...Molson and the rest of Canada for that matter, make much better.","proc","0"
