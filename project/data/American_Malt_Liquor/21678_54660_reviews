"So far, of the Malt Beverages I've tried this is the worst. On the positive side, if you are looking to get blind stupid drunk, you could ask for a better beer. Two of these would do it, but you would really be better off buying some cheap wine. This is the kind of beer you would use a brown paper back instead of a coozy. I may finish half of the glass I poured, but the rest of the glass and the can is going to be poured down the drain. I don't think the brewer was aiming to win any medals on this one, but just something cheap that you could get a buzz from and with this the brewer has succeeded."

"It's not as smooth as Old English but it is almost there and has a higher alc/vol. If you are choosing something that is cheap and will get you drunk, I recommend this. If you are looking for a quality beer experience then obviously this is not a good choice."
"Correction on the abv this is 9.9% abv unless they are selling the pictured 12% abv somewhere else in the country, I'm always excited to try the next horrible malt liquor release, I'm guessing this will get the straw-ber-rita flavor out of my mouth. Appears the color of apple juice, faint white head, smells a bit like peanuts and geriatric farts with a metallic twang. Guess what this beer is going to go over big with the college kids under two bucks and they will temporarily lose their vision. My god, what is that stuff, lord help the beer industry, why is this swill acceptable there's dead Mexicans and Unicorn tears in this beer at least that's what the label screams with the font with depicted unicorn wings taking you to heaven when you have your first near death experience going head to head with your frat brothers with this beer in a beer pong tournament. Alright can we finally sue somebody for false advertisement, I give Coors the benefit of the doubt I'm sure they really frost brew their products, especially if these guys are able to label it as a SMOOTH LAGER, unless smooth is a contraction as in this lager will make you say someone I'm missing a tooth (s'm'ooth), because the people of West Virginia (my hometown) state a championing a beer that will help them loos s'more teeth. I can't even take another sip, okay for the review and the fine people of West by God Virginia here it goes...rancid flavors that are making me poetic. I will finish by saying this apple juice looking malt liquor will rot some more teeth out it will definitely s'mooth you. Mouthfeel is similar to sever acid reflux that never goes away, not typical GERD which is caused by food and drink we expose ourselves to this is gut wrenching stomach acid like on the palate that feeling after you've puked in your mouth but caught it just in time. Overall I think I've lead you to my overall impression of this fine canned 24 ounce smooth lager with 9.9% alcohol by volume...drain pourIII"

"I actually liked this beer. It is nice and thick and heavy. This stuff gets you messed up fast(10% abv), so be careful of driving after drinking a can. I paid $1.69 for a can(24oz) just to try it, and it was worth every penny. I have seen a lot of bad reviews elsewhere about this beer, but hey, it is BEER, and a LAGER at that, so what do you want??? In my opinion, you can't get a better beer for the money. You may be able to find better beer, but NOT at $1.69 for a 24oz can...cheers!"

" This is not designed, to be a high priced flavored, Beer. This is a Beer designed to be an affordable way to catch a buzz, keep that in mind."
"avoid at all costs"
"Man, this is really bad - just a vehicle to deliver 12% straight to the dome. I'd rather pay 8 more dollars for a bottle of a really satisfying 12% beer and enjoy it. But then again, the two worlds in which these occur hardly ever meet."
"Overall: this beer has one purpose, get you drunk for cheap. It is described as a smooth lager, maybe of your idea of smooth is like a thumbtack on the bottom of your foot. Salud!"

"Tastes like cheap wine, grainy apple, cheap booze. Numbing alcohol deadens the palate after a couple sips. Gassy, sweet, and astringent, harsh and unpleasant to say the least. Green apple aftertaste dries out the mouth like a shot of liquor, with a similar boozy aftertaste. A messy and harsh cheap buzz. Not worth the headache that starts in almost immediately after a few sips."
"D - I was actually a bit pissed off when Jason poured out the can remnants before I could refill my glass, although in retrospect he was probably doing me a favor. Still, for a 12% high-gravity lager, this one can't be beat. Shockingly drinkable and inoffensive - gonna have to seek this one out again to share with the BAs who missed out."
"The taste is a huge improvement, so I'm going to alter my scores accordingly. It still has some of the characteristics it previously had: like the thinness and primarily sugar-alcohol taste. But the green apples are mostly gone; replaced with corn as the smell suggested. It's still a bit green apply, but nothing like the 12% version. It still leaves your mouth sorta dry, as another reviewer mentioned. They basically just took it down a notch. Tastes more like a typical HG malt liquor and a little less like ""WTF?"" I'd have to say it's decent...for what it is. I may even buy it again. If I get sick of Natty Daddy."
"O: Well, I'll be. Picked it up on a whim to see how bad it is, and it turns out not to be. Honestly, I can see myself buying this again. Drinks more like a strong dopplebock than a malt liquor, although the appearance wouldn't tell you that."
"Taste is very sweet and very much like a granny smith apple that has bobbed around in a trash-can punch concoction in the backyard of a college frat house for a few months. Are we sure there are no fruit flavored adjuncts here? I must say, it is somewhat smoother than I anticipated for a 12%'er, but damn, this tastes like an asian nail salon that doubles as a cider factory. I think I will go for the under on 8 oz. Its pretty nasty and not very beer-like. I might attempt to sip on this for a bit longer, but damn this shit is riz-ank!"
"3/29/2014 Update..New cans are rated 9.9% abv and the brew is MUCH more tolerable..actually not bad at all now!"
"I went out on a limb and picked up a few cans of this stuff to share with some buddies. I thought it was some kind of alcoholic energy drink at first. It does not look like beer from the outside. Upon further inspection I realized it was indeed beer, or should I say supposedly beer. 12% abv at that. I figured it couldn't be any worse than some of the 40's I've had in my day so I'd give it a shot, kind of as a novelty. Before we cracked them I said the words that sealed my fate, ""How bad can it be?"" This angered the beer gods, and I was quickly reminded by my friend not to make such inflammatory remarks. In short, the beer gods rose to the occasion and made this quite possibly the worst beer I've ever tasted. Hell, it might be the worst edible substance I've ever put in my mouth. It's like shitty moonshine mixed with battery acid and cut with club soda. Or more likely an abortion of an energy drink topped off with grain alcohol. Every sip made me cringe and cough. If I'm being nice, the best I can say is that it tasted like rusty champagne. But don't let that fool you, you'd rather drink whatever a bartender wrings out of his towel at the end of the night than take on the Stack. It has a very unique flavor of Froot Loops and vomit. The feeling you get when you drink it makes you question if life is even worth living. It feels horrible going down and leaves your stomach howling upon contact. You will need to drink a quart of Listerine after this, and not the nice minty green one, I'm talking the old school yellow one where ""antiseptic"" is actually the flavor. Stay away from this at all costs. Or if you think you're up to the task drink a whole can and you will have such an extreme point of relativity that everything else you ever eat or drink will seem like the most awesomely delicious thing you've ever tasted."
" Summary: I wouldn't... don't know where else to take that so I'll leave it there: I wouldn't."
"I'll be honest I had to force this one down, it's the worst beer I've ever had."
"D - if you can swallow it. Pretty much gives what you would expect, cheap ethanol delivery device wth too sweet of a taste. Not going to finish the glass though."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can 1161-2008. Sampled on September 6, 2010. This ""craft"" malt liquor pours a golden-yellow with a fizzy white head that dissolves to a thin ring. Like the macro malt liquors on the market this one bursts with the aroma of barley, grains, and malt. The taste adheres to the malt liquor style with an explosion of barley malts immersed in an obvious alcohol casing. But there is a slight sweetness that accompanies the sour. Not my kind of thing but hats off to the brewer for emulating the malt liquor tradition."
"Overall: wow, I'm half shitfaced and I'm a professional alcoholic. So glad I didn't buy two as the demon on my left shoulder suggested (the demon on my right shoulder wouldn't even look at this shit). AVOID LIKE AIDS!"
"D- Low, even for the style. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemies. Stay away."
"D: just a few sips it all i can muster to just type this up. this will probably be the last malt liquor for me for awhile."
"To be honest, I was seriously mistaken in this purchase. Since I bought it at a store that sold high-end beer, at the same time I made a purchase of some Chimay Ale, I assumed that it was a quality product in a funky package. You know how some companies push the edge. I really don't look at price when I purchase individual bottles for tastings, but I was amazed that the Stack High Gravity Lager was one of the inexpensive ones. The cashier pointed out the high alcohol content - I dismissed it having recently read about BrewDog's greatly expensive highest alcohol content beers in Wired Magazine and seen their U-Toooob videos touting how they froze and extracted the beer to concentrate the alcohol and flavor... Sink the Bismark!!! Now admittedly, I had the Chimay first because I am somewhat enamored by those Belgian monks and their ales and cheeses - and this may have affected my taste buds somewhat. However, while the Stack is somewhat weaker in flavor, a cider-like poor cousin character and significantly thinner in appearance than the Chimay Red, I found it strangely acceptable. As with any beer above 5 abv, one begins to note the strong aroma and characteristics of a high alcohol brew. Would I like it as a stand alone, perhaps not. Would I have it again, perhaps not. However, I find that the F's and D's offered up by the BA community are also applied to some magnificent brews - Yuengling Lord Chesterfield Ale for instance. Give it a chance. In fact, if served to your friends after some fine Chimay Grand Reserve or Red ale, they might not notice you paid next to nothing for the 24 ouncer. It is what it is."
"Seriously, I try to be objective. I've drank my fair share of malt liquor and this one started out average but hit the floor. It's like Organic Chemistry in a can. I keep waiting for that hot lab TA I had to kick open my door and make sure I put on safety goggles while drinking this, and then, you know, make out with me."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat, pickles, trash and citrus. The flavor is citrus, wheat and alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Better than Earthquake, but that is not saying much."
"Pours very deep golden color with a large head and retention is somewhat good for this type of brew. Nose is toxic/chemical and sickeningly sweet & sour like (artificial) sour green apple. A lot of alcohol heat on the backend. Mouthfeel is watery, cloyingly sweet. This tastes more like a badly put together barleywine or perhaps what I envision the wine they make in prison tastes. White Grape juice comes to mind. I drank a lot of crap beer growing up but this is possibly the WORST beer I have ever tasted. I bought it as a gag and that's what I got and then some."
"RJT"
"This stuff is in a class of it's own and I think it is fantastic for a low priced and highly alcoholic beverage."
"The taste is quite sweet, rank with pears to a cloying extent and with a spicy bready finish. Now this is quite sweet and not appealing, but it is not as awful as a 12% malt liquor by all accounts should be. In this respect, this is actually quite a good malt liquor. The body is medium to full with a high amount of carbonation. I'd prefer less carbonation, as if you are drinking this beer it impedes the shotgunning capability. I most likely won't be sampling this beverage again, but if I was broke and wanted some malt liquor... well this is an adequate choice. I'm not saying this tastes good, but for a 12% malt liquor it tastes better than it should."
"D: This is easily the best malt liquor that I've had. While it is very sweet, I found it to be lacking in the usually bad traits of malt liquors. If you're ballin' on a budget, this one might be for you."
"Whoa, hoss! I could smell this bad boy as I poured it into a glass. Green apples, all the way. Phew! I did not get much head off of the pour and what existed quickly reduced to wisps. Props on color, though. It was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was hot, I could feel the alcohol burn on my tongue and when I swallowed, it felt cool from the evaporation. Man, they really jacked up the alcohol on this bad boy. Finish was lingering with an alcohol burn. There is no way I could justify recommending this as a beer except to add another casualty to the CANQuest."
"I'm sorry to come out and just bash a beer, but I figured as long as I was subjecting myself to this beer I would write a review. It just really is that bad."
"Drinkable as in you can swallow it. Pretty much gives what you would expect, cheap ethanol delivery device. Not going to finish the glass though."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mostly of alcohol, some malts and slightly sweet. Taste starts of sweet and finishes with alcohol. Did someone drop a shot in my beer? Feels light in the mouth. This is definatly not a session beer, 1 of these cans was plenty for me. Overall if you are looking to get slam faced cheap, this one is the way to go. Otherwise avoid it."
