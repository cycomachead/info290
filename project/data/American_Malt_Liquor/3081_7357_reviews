"Mouthfeel is not too bad. A little thick and sticky.  Overall, it's not good. I won't finish it. I may have a few more sips before throwing in the towel."

"My bottle of Hayward's 5000 was overly sweet with hints honey and bananas leading the way and lingering. The head was small and white with a foamy appearance and the body was clear and gold. It felt syrupy with a small amount of soft carbonation."

"I really can't think of much great to say about this beer, I try not to dwell on the negative, however... This really is kind of a sorry beer. It's just so watery and bitter, almost as if they didn't even try.... It's just about a drain pour. Avoid at all costs if your a fan of true premium beer~"

"Food match: What does one eat with Lager-rum? I haven't the foggiest. What I imagine would go well is Jamaican cuisine as that is the only thing rum related that comes to mind; Black beans, shredded beef, jerk chicken, rice and plantain or Stamp and Go with callaloo fritters."

"It's light-bodied, fairly crisp but a little too slick, and not just in the finish."

"Well it looked like a beer, right? This was awfully oxidized, leaving a sickly sweet aftertaste. It's only value was that it quenched a little bit of the power that came from the whole peppercorns and cardamom seeds I stumbled across as I ate the biryani. Avoid."

"This beer IS boring, but the subtle sweetness keeps me drinking. I wouldn't order this again, but would like to see this on tap if and when we visit India. I also wonder where the 5000 comes from… maybe I will do a little digging. Cheers, people!"
"bought this just to see what this beer was all about with the goofy name. weird that this Indian beer is basically and American Malt Liquor."

"Aroma is crisp, malty and a little fruity - typical, but at least OK. Pours a clear, rather wan yellow - not too good, but at least the white head is thick and somewhat persistent. Flavor is - not outstanding, but for a pale lager, a snip or two above average. Malty and fruity, satisfying. Texture has OK body and OK fizz. Overall, fair to middlin’. If not great, at least potable. Good for a party, or with a meal."

"Startin' the day off right with an Indian malt likkah. 'Cause why the fuck not!? This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger-and-a-half of white foam that dissipates rather quickly. The nose comprises bushels of corn atop a small pile of wheat and grass. It's not bad, but certainly nothing I can call ""good"". The taste is of perfume-y rubber (walk down the tire aisle some day...), diseased corn, and lead. Wow, I did not expect such a foul taste, especially given my sick predilection toward most malts. Damn, this is some intensely godawful shit right here. It physically hurts during and well after the stuff rampages across my tongue. Damn. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly oily feel. Overall, this has got to be one of the worst beers I've had in a long time. I don't think I can properly put into words just how this makes my tastebuds want to flee the country for fear that their families' lives are at risk. Ouch! (I took another drink for some masochistic reason...)"
"This is an average beer but different enough (barely) from most macros to try. It's a session beer and nobody is going to love it, but it's alright. I'ts the best malt liquor beer I've ever had."

"The flavor is a marked improvement. I can even detect a mild hop bite. Light grain. The body is decent with a slightly elevated carbonation level. For the style, I'd say this is better than the typical suspects, but it is still suspect itself."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, corn. Taste is not very good, something metallic and medicinal is present, a bit of malt and grain. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a subpar beer, most American made malt liquors are better."
"Served in bottle at India House. Appearance is gold and clear with minimal head. Smell feature sweet malts, dry bread, mild corn, and other grainy qualities. Taste matches nose with sweetness up front, dry grains and light hop bitterness come though as well. Pretty decent flavors for a malt liquor. Mouthfeel is moderate with fizzy carbonation. Overall, nothing offensive here (which I fully expect with the style), so in that realm, this is pretty good. Otherwise, pretty standard lager."
"Overall, it's the typical profile for a malt liquor, but a bit fleeting in the malt department. One is more than enough...way to sweet."

"I found this beer to be very very strong. Of course, it is 5000 and the stronger version but it was very bitter. The aftertaste is strong. The colour is like any lager, but a little darker yellow compared to other Indian beers. Very strong and can get you very very drunk. Have only one and share with friends. You won't know what hit you!"
"Works as a lawnmower beer or with spicy food. Not that bad."
"Oh dear, I'm in a fix; only one more chilled beer and there's this: Poured cold from the fridge with a small to medium foamy, frothy, off-white head, that quickly settled to an island and ring, with no lace. Color is a clear, pale yellow with lots of large and small bubble trails. Aroma is the best thing about this beer - sweet with a little beery, malt, hop. Flavor isn't so good; mainly neutral sweet, carbonic tang, hint of bitter. Body is there, but not pleasant and carbonation is too strong and clashes- heck, everything clashes in this brew. Finish is like flavor and of medium length, which is way too long. Bleh."

"This is what a lager should smell and taste like. Buy it. You'll like it."

"Shipped all this way and $3 a bomber, there is your answer. It does the job if you can stomach over a year old malt liquor from far away."
"All in all, I'd actually go for Budweiser before this unless I was enjoying a curry. For that matter I'd opt for a Molson's XXX if I wanted something strong with lots of body but not overwhelming in alcohol."
"O – Average quality, more or less, in a high ABV macro-lager."
"Overall - A simple, basic beer. I wasn’t expecting much other than Baird I often don’t hold out much hope for Asian beers. Would I buy a bottle? Maybe not, I got this from a rep as a sample. I can see it being a good move from the BCM market. But other than that, meh."
"Overall: reminds me of a regular BMC product and this beer hides the alcohol well."
"Overall: Unpleasant and coarse but not entirely undrinkable, it's like an India-born malt liquor."
"O- Not good. It was worth a try since Indian beer is not widely available where I'm from. But I doubt I'll have this again, unless I'm at an Indian restaurant and I plan on getting wasted. Or in India."
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass, the beer pours a crystal clear dark gold with a half an inch of white, fluffy head and lots of carbonation bubbles. Strong toasted oat and corn smells from the beer, and not much else. Slightly sour grain taste to the beer, with a quick and dry finish. Minimal pale aftertaste, but tolerable. Standard lager, but great with spicy food."
"Dudes...anyone trying this beer must have done a tour of duty in India!!! I had my experience in Lucknow!!! What a PLACE! Anyone who has been to India....know what I am talking. The beer is typical of a macro brewed beer....clear golden/yellow in color not alot of head. Smell is iffy, and so is the taste! The alcohol makes it tough to do a session with it and overpowers the taste! However, when you are in Lucknow...any beer will do....and if I was in Lucknow right now drinkin the Haywards 5000....I would be smiling!"
"D- Not a terrible beer. Hides the alcohol well. The metallic flavor really goofed this one up."
"D: This is what my Indian friends tell me that they got smashed off of in college; it was kind of their equivalent to a 40 oz bottle... I wasn't surprised that this didn't come in one."
"It is not good."
"Poured a golden yellow with a finger of head that left good blotchy lacing on the glass. The grains and sweet malt dominate the aroma that also had slight wheat and spice notes; pretty simple nose. The taste is pretty much the same as the nose with the grains and malts playing the main role which also had caramel and slight ctiric accent. the brew was medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a slight sweet and malty finish. Overall its an average lager that goes great paired with shrimp tandoori which also drank very well and was really refreshing."
"I wouldn't drink this one again, unless served very cold, and for a great price at a restaurant. Factor in freshness also. If it was new I would try it again. This one sat in my fridge for a month or so. And the regions of where it came were shady. Theres my disclaimer."
"D= This was an ok macro style lager that paired well with spicy Indian food. If I was having this by itself I would have struggled to finish it. Actually, by the time I was done eating I still had about 5 ounces in my glass and I found myself not too interested in finishing it."
"Appearance is a cloudy straw golden color with a quickly dissapating head. Smell is lightly sweet that has a malty graininess to it . Taste has a malty/adjunct light sweetness leaving a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light having good body with crisp carbonation. Actually not bad for a fairly high alc. adjunct beer which is fine until it gets to the bitter end."
"It is the sort of beer to have over a business discussion on a warm afternoon."
"Does it taste like a kristal weizen? No. It tastes metallic too, with a very slick mouthfeel. Pretty unoffensive, but then again, its also really bland."
"Aroma is mild, sweet and malty. Flavor is crisp, clean and mildly malty. Nothing special, but not really bad either. Mouthfeel and carbonation are both light. Easy to drink with spicy food."
"The drinkability was nothing special. Overall, most folks would rather drink a beer that's aromatic and full bodied. Same with the mouthfeel, nothing special."
"Even with an aggressive pour, not much of a head, mainly comprised of larger, quick to pop bubbles, no foam, white in color, minimal lacing left behind. Raw grainy nose, like unshucked corn, metal, iron notes without mineral water foundation to fall back on, some fuller bread notes, sour grapefruit rind, has a saline quality as well, nothing about it that jumps out as fruit, overall the smells don't piss you off, it just smells like generic ""beer."" Medium-bodied, broad-shouldered carbonation which lasts easily through the finish. Pretzels, sourdough, rye, more cooked than raw, if indistinguishable as elements, certainly makes it evident that this is a straight down the middle of the plate lager beer. Sour mixed white citrus, more iron flecks, an uptick in apricot to peach fruit, pits and skins, maybe fig. Due to the carbonation doesn't lose weight/palate presence through the finish. Old coriander powder. Without faulting it, or its place of origin, too much it falls exactly into line with expectations. You're in a cheap Indian restaurant scarfing down some vindaloo chicken and nan and this is the beer you drink there. No mystery, no failure to meet a certain threshold of quality. Great, no, contextually viable, absolutely."
"I have stopped drinking this beer post my tryst with Belgians"
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of adjunct, pale malt, and yeast. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of adjunct (metallic), yeast, pale malt, and slight hops. Overall, a not so great beer, but to be expected."
"This beer pours a nice golden color but the head, or lack thereof, leaves something to be desired. The aroma is high metallic (copper?) and sweet bread. Light on the palate and in the flavor department. The brew tries to come across clean but is thwarted by unpleasantness lurking the background, veggies with a twist of skunk, perhaps. Overall, not recommended but if it is the only thing on the beer list at favorite Indian joint, it may do."
"Palate is surprisingly fruity, but the first taste is that nasty pride of ringwood character again which appears on the front. Luckily this goes away by the mid palate leaving a nice apple character but one that is quite watery and insipid. Finish is actually quite sweet but not very nice. Overall the palate isn't actually badly constructed, frankly, it just doesn't taste good. Mouthfeel is a bit flat but also has a slight sticky note to it. It's not a pleasant beer, although one thing for it is it does go well with the spicy food."
"D-If one was to drink only Indian beer while in India, you can do a lot better than this. I know everyone seems to hate on Kingfisher but I would make Kingfisher my session for a week than touch this again. I felt dirty after drinking it."
"Aroma of stale bread, butterscotch, and alcohol. Not pleasant. Bad aftertaste. Thin, yet coating. A bit better than the aforementioned, but not my cup of 'tea'."
"D: Just plain horrible flavors, a horrible lager bite and just bad brewing techniques, but then again what else would you expect from SAB. Undrinkable, couldnt finish."
"D - 3.5 - Overall one of my favorite Indian beers so far. The flavor profile on this is very interesting and different then most else on the market."
"After sitting for awhile, and warming to room temp. there was an out of place banana taste that was neither here nor there. Kingfisher paired much better with the spicy lamb curry."
"Strangely bright tan/yellow color with a thin cap of head and a sharp sourness in the nose that is mostly malt. Taste is strong sour malt and not a whole lot else. Finish is fairly clean but not good at all. The alcohol is an intimidating enforcer behind the sour assault. Wow, this is pretty bad. If you want a brew to drink with Indian food, go with Kingfisher or Cobra, this is barely drinkable at all."
"Nothing special. It might Work well with some cuisine, but I think other beers of the same genre probably surpass it."
"The Indian preference for ""super strong"" beers is often a menace. Somehow the kick is considered more important than the taste. The well-known beer ""Knock-Out"" spells it out quite clearly. Haywards 5000 would most likely taste better with less alcohol. Still, it's a kind of Indian equivalent to Eurolager- perhaps Hindulager?, and it's definately functional. It smells sweet and the hal finger of foam disappears quickly. The taste is malty/bready with a distinct alcohol breath lingering in the mouth. I often wonder over Indian beer names. Haywards is obviously meant to give the beer a heritage feel. The number 5000 may just be a high number indiacting the potency of the brew (He-man 9000 is another example?"
"Flavor starts sweet with some corn sugar and a hint of caramel again some spicy hops are present and a bit of husky malt and some corn/vegetable notes as well. ON the finish there is a hit of citrusy/rind hops. The beer is clean and sweet,not great or exciting but certainly not a drain pour either."
"Drinkable only as a last resort. Very last."
"Has a very light yellow colored body with a big white head that disappears immeadiately. The aroma is lightly grainy with a hint of alcohol. Kind of a sweet grassy taste, no hop bitterness evident. Mostly a strong alcohol presence in the flavor not much else. This remineded me of some ""biere forte"" that I purchased in Canada a few years ago. Mostly alcohol rush and no real beer flavor."
"Sinkability  I definitely cant make myself finish this thing."
"Pours with a two-finger head that leaves a ton of lace. Very pale yellow color. Light carbonation. Nose is hay like in a barn. Starts and finishes sweet. Light bodied. So far my best beer from India but this is only the fourth. The label has this ""manufactured"" by Skol Breweries. $1.95 for a 330ml bottle."
"This would be the last Indian beer I tried on my trip and it didn't help my impression of the business in that country. Light golden color, no discernable head. Smelled slightly skunky but that's about it. Lousy hoppiness, like it was watered down. Maltiness was negligable. Rather flat but drinkable for the ABV. I felt it after the oversized bottle but I wasn't ready to have another one, I'd rather Sprite."
"Ok, maybe one of the better brews from India - but not great."
"A clear gold body is capped by a short head of bright white foam. The retention is fair, and although it drops a bit it still maintains a thin creamy layer across the surface. Some minor lace also adds to the appearance. The nose displays some higher alcohols and acetaldehdye. It's not quite off-putting, but it's certainly not pleasant either. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth due to the combination of its medium/full body and fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation. The alcohol found in the nose reappears in the flavor amidsts a somewhat grainy and sweetish malt that's backed by a firm bitterness. It finishes dry with residual, lingering alchohol. Not a very well-made beer by any means."
"It has a negligable head, and a pale, golden color. It's not particularly carbonated, and has a sweet, alcolol smell. The taste is initially malty, and well balanced with a bitter hop finish. Soft, pleasant mouthfeel...at times grainy. Very slight warming, but the alcohol herecould be dangerous."
