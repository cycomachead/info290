"Cheap but OK. Better than most malt liquors"

"Final Grade: 2.11, a disappointing D-. I only know one person who drinks this stuff, and it's definitely not because of the nuanced flavour. Labatt Maximum Ice is good for precisely one thing - getting shitfaced on beer while spending as little money as possible. If you're not an alcoholic homeless person, I can't think of any compelling reasons to bother with this one. For the record, I did manage to finish the can, but I won't be picking up another in the future."

"This beer has one purpose, to get you drunk fast"

"It does what malt liquors do best and that is to get one drunk. Not a craft but it is brewed with natural ingredients and that to me means something. Don't flunk it simply because it is a macro malt liquor."

"O - It is a little less flavorful, not that this is a flavorful style of beer, than other malt liquors. The dry finish is also unlike any malt liquors that I have had the privilege of sampling. I would have to say this is not a favorite in the style."
"Labatt Max Ice ---2/5"
"I've had worse, but still this is pretty awful. Maybe worth trying just once to say you did."

"Overall – In many ways a very standard malt. A little less boozy tasting with a bit more caramel instead of corn then the most. It’s not too bad for the price or the bang it gives."

"I picked up a 24oz can of this at Woodman's in Janesville, WI in summer 2012. I figured you got to know what the cheap beer tastes like to know what to good beer tastes like, right? Pours a hazy yellow color with a thin pillowy head. Has a strong grassy, grain scent. Taste is a sweet grainy taste that is mildly malty as well. Texture is average but it does have decent drinkability. I was really surprised how decent this actually was for a cheap ice beer. I Would pick this over Miller/Bud any day."

"as a side note the 7.0% ABV does give you a headache in the morning but i blame that on how fast i drank it ( the flavor and smell worsen as it warms up so its basically a double edged sword"
"Overall - I figured 'how bad can it be?'. The answer is pretty bad. The taste is awful and this is something that will never drink again."
"Disappointing...Labatt needs to go back to the budget beer drawing board."
"Recommend serving ice cold, and with water on the side, as with all malt liquors."

"24 oz can says it's brewed in Rochester NY maybe at Genesee. Weighs in as a big American lager or a small malt liquor. Pours a deep yellow golden almost apple juice like tone with a bright white head forming thick and dwindling even quicker. Thin speckled lacing left behind, let's see how the rest goes. Aroma has a strong cooked veggies high adjunct ridden nose going on not much sweetness or malt or hop action served cold to protect my palate. Flavor has a dominant sweetness almost table sugar extreme sweetness, pretty much sickeningly corn syrup high fructose that should have been fermented out. Not to hot with alcohol just one rough sip that seems to never get better as you try to actually consume this creation. Absolutely horrible example of beer in general but the sad part is I can't even consider it to be a good malt liquor many a better cheap drunks out there. Pass on this one it was like a dollar with some change for this big can. Mouthfeel is harsh I don't know why but it's hard to take a sip, excessive CO2 medium to light body becomes cloying quickly after taking a few sips. Overall pure shite that really should avoid the beer market, why is there a need for this stuff."

"Overall: Not even a good beer to ""get plastered"" with; even Hurricane Malt Liquor has more redeeming qualities than this. Not the worst beer I've ever tasted, but definitely not the best."
"O- Thumbs up for the malt liquor. Above average, although certainly not above rest."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade. Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is of alcohol, some mild malts, nothing special here. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall there is nothing to seperate this malt liquor from the pack."
"Fair drinkabilty. Very easy to chug this i think, but still not at all impressed..."
"Clear gold with a short white cap of fine bubbles. Good head retention for the style, looks decent. The smell is a bit harsh, syrupy sweet, grainy, alcohol. Cloyingly sweet flavour, nearly no bitterness, boozy finish. A bit metallic in the finish, significant warmth but not hot. Medium bodied and dry, fizzy, not an appealing texture. I'm not a fan, even for the style."
"This is the worst beer I ever tasted by LaBatt. When pouring it into a glass and it had a nice large white head that had good lacing, but not as good retention. I was not impressed with the smell of rotting cereal or rice that got spoiled. When tasting it all I could taste was spoiled corn and thought I was drinking urine. The mouthfeel was a watered down poor excuse of a beer, felt like something spoiled and smelly was in my mouth. I know this has 7.1% ABV, but if someone wants a beer just for getting drunk with a high alcohol content I'd say go with Steel Reserve or even Nat Ice would be better than this. I paid $1.59 for this can and I don't think I'll be able to finish it."
"The dozenth entry into Swill Fest 2010's guestbook. It pours a familiarly clear jaundice topped by nearly a finger of white foam. The nose comprises dirty rice (real dirt, not the style of rice mix known as dirty), bad wheat, and light syrup. The taste is kinda heavy on the corn syrup, while the burnt wheat brings up the rear. The body is a heavy-ish light, with a light moderate carbonation and a steel-y finish. Not the worst thing consumed tonight, but definitely not the best, either."
"The appearance is the golden I would assume the malt liquor should be, but it is still scary to me. The smell is of the corn and rice that you would expect, but there is a funkiness that I can't place...I blame Canada. The taste is much more bitter than I would have liked. The other flavors of it include many things that you would have experienced in the aroma. As far as I am concerned this is Canadian Ghetto Juice. This isn't very good, the mouthfeel is exactly what I would have expected, corn syrupy and unpleasant. This is drinkable if you are sitting on the curb outside the liquor store in Toronto, that's pretty much it."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light for chugging. The alcohol isnt exactly rocket fuel but aint pleasant. As far as drinkability you got to be kidding. Not to be repeated unless you are broke and desperate."
"Not drinkable - absolute drain pour."
"Once again, these oversized CANs have screwed the pooch in terms of the placement of the opening. It was far enough back from the lip that short of a complete inversion of the CAN, beer was guaranteed to run down the sides of the CAN. Grrr. My pour gave me a finger of foamy, bone-white head with medium retention. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the now-infamous smell of green apples. And plastics. What more could I ask for? Mouthfeel was medium with a sweetish apple-cereal quality on the tongue. How do they make this? The finish was really biting with an alcohol heat in the throat. This is not the way to go on a holiday weekend."
"Congratulations to the Canadians for taking the Malt Likkapalooza XIII title. Labatt Max Ice did just enough to pull ahead of Tundra Ice and stay there. Is it worth your hard-earned money? No, but then your already knew that."
"D: not terrible, but there are better malt liquors out there. I feel like most MLs over 6% get terrible. Generally, the high proof MLs are more expensive, so just spend the extra 50 cents and get two regular crappy beers instead of one extra strong, extra crappy one."
"Tastes pretty bad, stale corn. Carbonation and mouthfeel are pretty ok actually, so you can at least drink it and get a nice buzz on. The other plus is the price, nice 1.50. Medium good for the style. More alcohol and better tasting than olde english so i'd at least recommend it over the good ole' pissfoty"
"Not as bad as I would have thought, but definitely more about the booze than the other underwhelming ingredients."
"D - Well I can't say its a good beer but its fairly average for the style and its going to take some time to finish this monster of a can remember BA science needs you sometimes"
"This is a beast of a beer I used to enjoy a lot in high school. I revisited this beer recently....ah the memories. This truly is one of the nicest looking macros I've ever seen, pours out a nice golden yellow color, with active carbonate and a 1 inch head that stuck around for a while, and then receded into a ring of lacing. Truly nice for a macro. Smell on the other hand was average, smelled like every other strong macro does, corny and boozy. Ah the maximum ice that I see so commonly in parks, and smashed in school yards, it does taste alright. Honestly for the ABV of this beer, it tastes like a stock 5% macro. Goes down smooth, with little bitterness, and little anything. Mouthfeel, is a bit thin tho, and overly carbonated. I have to give this one a 5 for drinkability, honestly when you walk into a LCBO near closing time, they will be sold out of this, people make fun, but they will drink this. When cold this is a dangerously easy beer to drink. Trust me, if you wanna get drunk on the cheap, this is one of the best beers to use."

"Bears little to no resemblance in any respect to the other Labatt macro lagers. Has a strange grainy off-flavor with a nasty chemical aftertase. High ABV is not blended or mellowed at all and comes through harsh and offensive. If you're looking to get hammered and don't care at all about flavor, then I guess it would do the trick. Personally, I don't think having to drink enough to catch a buzz would be worth subjecting myself to the experience."
"Of course I wouldn't drink this for pleasure, but if money was tight, I could make due with it. My string of no drain pours remains intact. When I'm not paying attention I can get it down without too much of a fight. Not compelling. I'm only drinking it because it's in front of me."
"Pretty boozy even for a Malt Liquor. Passable if you like the style but not worth it if you drink beer for flavor."
"Notes: Its malty to the max and it will get you loaded quickly and cheaply. Overall it is a passable brew for some serious drinking."
"D- Yeah, ummmm, i don't think I'll be picking this up again."
"Not too bad, but there is much better out there. Blue is actually a preferable alternative to me."
"5 kids, x-mas.,3 b-days, & new years...yup, i'm down to this ; poured a decent looking gold w/ a thin white head which dissapeared as quickly as i poured and left almost no lacing in my giant mug ; an almost noxious alcoholic and corn adjunct smell, almost a note of hop in there, though ; tastes like i should drink it from a paper bag, a big sweet corn taste up front w/ a vinous harsh alcohol taste to follow ; a watery,yet syrupy thick mouthfeel w/ little co2 ; i wouldn't drink this unless i was an alcoholic..."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a very thin head. Aroma is of malt and slightly of cooked corn. Taste is very strong (alcohol-ish) with the taste of adjunct and corn at the back of the throat. Smooth and somewhat drinkable. Good if you like high alcohol macro lagers."
"A rather drinkable strong beer, Labatt Maximum Ice does have it's moments. Pours out to a medium golden color with a short lived white head of foam. No lace. Medium low carbonation. Aromas are quite sweet, and have notes of corn and grain leading the pack of otherwise normal smells of macro beer. Taste is very sweet and dense; strong notes of sweet alcohol esters, corn, thick malt. Not bad. Mouthfeel is boardering on sticky sweet and syrupy, but remained tolerable. Drinkability is average. Not bad for a higher ABV brew. Special thanks goes out to Derek for the sample."
"Pours a really pissy yellow golden, fluffy white head forms and disappears, some lacing. Smell is sweet, maybe some vanilla, malty, honey, grass, little bit of alcohol. Taste is sweet, citrus, almost a little skunky with some caramel and vanilla, little bit of iron in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth, really not that bad, maybe drinking high strength beers has numbed my taste buds to alcohol, but I don't taste any in this, better than other malt liquors, no aftertaste."
"But overal, for a beer that's about as strong as Colt 45, I would choose this as the better beer. Good if you want to get drunk fast."
"Not bad for a Labatt's, tastes a little like beer, and other than that vodka. Some signs of bubbles, some taste. Not too drinkable, but I could get through more than a sip, and that's a complement for me for anything coming out of this national brewer."
"All in all, good summer drink but watch your consumption the brew is so smooth you have a tendency to not realize how much you've had and it creeps upon you."
"Sampled from a 1.18 litre bottle, put this puppy in a brown paper bag and it will be acceptable."
"It was not worthit"
