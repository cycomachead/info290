"I suppose once they lowered the ABV to normal-ish adult beverage levels, the fruity malt liquor associations kind of drop off.  Anyways, still not really a beer, the raspberry component completely obliterating any Bud Light [sic] graininess.  More evidence that 'Bud Light' is more brand name than actual beer."
"Amazingly not awful. Could go really well with a desert such as a cheesecake. Not too sure how to rate this one though since it is not really a beer"
"Tickles my tastebuds! Soooo yummy! "
"typical bud beer, cheap price, cheap tasting...."
"Way too sweet. I couldn't take it."

"I try to rate beers to style.   This is really a malt beverage or alcopop not beer as such.  It's not bad for what it is and makes a nice change from beer.   It pours a purple color with a minimal white head from a ten ounce can.  The smell is sweet and has some raspberry notes.  The flavor is on the sweet side but definitely tastes like raspberry.  It's decent if this is what you are looking for but it doesn't really resemble beer."

"Overall (3.23) : I like this ""beer"". It's actually a margarita in a can, and I think AB needed to market it under a brand name that would sell, so they slapped ""Bud Light"" on the can and called it good. It's nothing at all like a Bud Light, and pretty much nothing at all like a beer. For what it is, it tastes great - but if Beer Advocate has these things on here, they might as well start adding Smirnoff and Mike's to the list of reviewed products, as this is NOT a beer. I don't quite know how to rate this. I enjoy it, so I guess I'll rate it how I want."

"Overall: still an alcopop, not a beer. But drinkable. I have to imagine that I am on a boat or something."

" Overall- The best of the Rita series, I am not sure that is saying much but this is the one of the series that I wouldn't turn down at a party if someone offered it to me."

"Pours a bright red with pink foam. The smell was alcohol and artificial fruit. Very sweet taste with a syrupy mouthfeel which made the aftertaste last way too long."

"That damn mango version a few days ago gave me a taste for the other flavors, so raspberry it is tonight. This stuff pours a clear fuchsia topped by a minor wisp of transitory dirty-tan bubble foam. The nose comprises sweet raspberry syrup undercut by a few twists of lime. The taste brings in more of the same, the lime juice really only adding a bit of tartness to the proceedings. The body is a light medium, with a fizzy carbonation and a soda-like feel. Overall, not much to say here: it's tasty enough to me, as I like the sweeter, soda-like flavors. It's nothing special, nor truly praise-worthy in any way, but it gets the job done in an alcohol-delivery sense."

"Raz-Ber-Rita pours a reddish purplish color with no head and lots of bubbles. There is a very sweet smell that smells like a chemical factory. The taste has a very strange fake chemical raspberry flavor, with hints of cheap beer trying to come through. Flat, and while prominent flavors, they are bad. Overall it's chemically and rather fake, avoid."

"O: The berry flavors completely obscure the taste of the underlying beer, but when you consider that this is Bud Light, this might not necessarily be considered a bad thing. It starts to become a little cloying as the beer warms up so this beer is something that is best drank cold or chilled with ice."
"Once more, I got a loud Crack!, but given that there was going to be 25 (!) fl. oz. of it, the Glug would not be inverted. This must be a joke, right? If CrAN was magenta, then this was definitely raspberry. It fizzed in the glass like soda pop, making a fizzy two-fingered head of deep purple before taking a bow and fading into obscurity. I was left with a glass filled with fizzing, popping liquid, defying me to CANtinue. Nose smelled of artificial raspberry, like kiddie CANdy, which was entirely disappointing. I miss my paternal Grummy and her raspberry bushes, which smelled as fragrant and enticing in the summer as anything that I CAN remember. This smelled like a travesty. Color was a deep purple (SRM = N/A) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was thin, but fizzy, reinforcing the idea of soda pop. The flavor was that same artificial raspberry taste that I garnered from the nose. Better drinking from the chem lab, I suppose, but I may not have been their target audience. I was not going to stoop to adding ice, as I could not see how that would help, but it needed help and in no small way. Man, this was sickeningly sweet and much too close to soda pop for comfort. Finish was sweet, fruity and just not my bag."

"O - It is overtly sweet and highly carbonated."

"Bud Light Lime Raz-Ber-Rita brewed by Anheuser-Busch.This brew pours out a dark purple color with no head. You smell the raspberry and that is about it. As far as the taste it is raspberry. Not much for a brew but it goes down nice and smooth. This brew is a good for the summer time. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3 out of 5. There is nothing bad about this brew. I will buy this again to switch it up from the mainstream brews out there on the market."
"O: Overall this is a beer for people that do not like the taste or smell of beer, the fact that it is made from Bud Light Lime is almost completely hidden. Too sweet for my taste but it is not offensive."

"Poured from a 25 oz. can. Has a purple color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is full of raspberry goodness. Taste is raspberries, sweet, just a touch of tartness, alcohol well hidden. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while I wouldn't want a steady diet of it, this wasn't all that bad."

"Nothing can prepare you for the color of Barney the Dinosaur in a glass. Barely noticeable fleeting pink head dwindles quicker than a fart in the wind. Aroma reminds me of the flavor of a Warhead sour candy blue raspberry, with default berry notes and some alcoholic medicinal qualities. Even over ice I don't see how it would help this Raz-ber-Rita...wow. The madness has to stop, but I'm sure somebody out there enjoys this type of abuse, different strokes for different folks. Harsh ass fusel alcohol finish amongst the mild salted berry concentrated sugar notes. Headache inducing almost instantly, puts a smile on my face to know that I will never walk down the path of canned Bud Light Lime concoction's lemmings have gone...which has one ultimate outcome a direct path toward a black out drinking session or worse diabetes induced coma (which also leads to a black out in a roundabout way). Mouthfeel makes your acid reflux come out of hibernation and burn your ears for consuming something this putrid, gag reflex inducing carbonated man made liquids combine to form this shit. Overall, I would never guide anybody toward this path of enlightenment, or eternal black out for that matter."

"Pours a red wine in pour with really no head or lacing to speak of. The aroma is of Raspberries of course with some sweeteners. The taste is the same with good raspberry flavor coming through with a hint of ol' 'Bud Lime' at the end. I liked it better than their Cran-Ber-Rita I tried a couple of months ago. Overall, it wasn't bad."
