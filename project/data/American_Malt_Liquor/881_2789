1.38,-26.2,2,1.5,1,2,1.5,"There might be worse examples of the style, but I hope not. This shows the worst of the stereotypical malt liquor. A waste of 99 cents plus tax. sweet with nail polish and soap. There are better, more balanced (more flavored) malt liquors out there. This is insta-headache. Couldn't quite finish the first half, even with determination.","jwc215","Nov 01, 2008"

A pale yellow with a frizzy white head. The nose is especially grainy. The flavor profile is flat and of bitter alcohol. Quite a light body and too much carbonation. Not highly recommended.","rye726","May 19, 2008"

2.14,14.4,1.5,2.5,1.5,3.5,2.5,"I bought this beer at a liqour store for 2.99 for a four pack. It seems to have a warm sensation once swallowed due to the high alcohol and the mouthfeel is very heavy and thick. Never bothered to pour it into a mug though. It smells very grainy and cheap. Although this beer is one beer you would like to drink if you just wanted to get smashed. All in all for 2.99 you pay for what you get!","ozzyfan97","Dec 25, 2006"
2.75,47.1,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Surprisingly, this wasnt horrible.... but then again, it wasnt all that good either. But in the realm of really-cheap 40's, this one doesnt do too horribly. (Hmm, I just got a bit of a grape taste in there. Interesting.) Anyway, for a cheap warm buzz, this one will do the trick. A good nominee for nights out drinking with the guys out at the old hunting shack. So taking style into account, I ALMOST give this lowly-raked malt liquor a thumbs up.","ski271","Nov 21, 2006"
2.66,42.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Overall, it's certainly not the worst malt liquor I've ever had.. that award 's been earned by the King Of Beers with their "Hurricane". Nor is it the best. I'd place it middlin' to middlin'-bottom. Could be much better... don't complain to me if you get hammered and kill your neighbor or wake up with the worst hangover you've ever had and call in sick "forever" - I warned you! Oh, and if there really is a "Satan", it's more likely that he's involved with this beer than anything by the name of "Duvel". ;)","NeroFiddled","Nov 09, 2006"
2.07,10.7,3.5,1.5,2,2,2.5,"Drinkability: I'd rather have a 211 High Gravity, this is pretty hard to throw back. None the less, this wasn't brewed to be delicious, and it gives a hell of a head rush especially if you drink it fast.","guitarmage","Jun 08, 2006"
1.12,-40.1,3,1,1,1,1,"Ah, Camo... how can you turn down a malt liquor in a camoflagued bottle? This stuff is strong, but it tastes absolutely horrible. It's best used for college drinking games. I used to start out every party with 2 Camo 40s... it's one of those rare malt liqours that don't taste better with the second bottle. It's more of a conversation piece than anything else. Everyone should try Camo at least once (drinking a 99 cent malt liquor does gives you life experience). It's terrible, but it's hillarious.","WMBierguy","Jan 18, 2006"
4.03,115.5,4.5,4,4,3,4.5,"I work at a distributer that sells this beer so I had to try it. At first open I thought that the high alcohol smell would make for a bad beer. After a couple sips, it was actually pretty good. I would compare it to Miller High Life....except that you get SMASHED after two or three beers. Since Beer is for the purpose of getting drunk...this is the right one. If it taste good and serves it's purpose, why not take this one. Since I do work at a distributor that sells high end beers, If anyone ask for a good beer that will serve its purpose, I will HIGHLY RECOMEND CAMO>","lugosi33","Nov 15, 2005"
1.48,-20.9,2.5,2,1,2.5,1,"I suppose this was inevitable, I had to review Camo. I'm reviewing it straight from a 40 oz. Let us see if I can drink the whole think without barfing. The last time I had one of these I made it through a third of it and poured it out, but tonight I'm desperate. The appearance is okay. It pours a caramel color with little froth and lacing. The smell is slightly strong but other than that it is flat. The taste, oh dear god in heaven the taste, is probably the worst thing to be called beer, excluding Camo Genuine Ale. (Half way done.) The taste is strong with alcohol and horribly sweet as if sweetened with Splenda. The taste is definitely not the high point of the beer. (Pretty drunk now.) The mouthfeel is a little thicker but sour. It has bad drinkablity. I can't chug it because it wouldn't give me enough time to get to the sink. There was maybe 3 or 4 mouthfulls left but I gotta barf anyway. A horrible beer that can serve a purpose if low on cash or self esteem.","nicksta","Nov 08, 2005"
2.53,35.3,4,1,3.5,3.5,1.5,"Pours an extra clear pale straw, and a three finger head dissipates quickly, but will not lose a thin ring of foam. Laces nicely as well. Apple esters and alcohol fusels are faint, and make up the only aromas. Immediate ester sweetness and grainy alcohol taste, with a pale lager flavor and spent hop bitterness to back it up. The light body and active carbonation soften the blow of unbalanced cidery alcohol, and the semi-dry aftertaste boosts drinkability, but there is still little to discern this from other high gravity beverages.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 20, 2005"

1.53,-18.2,2.5,2,1.5,1,1,"Very light bodied, with a limp, languid finish, the main staying aspect being the affect of the booze on the brain. Unpleasant flavor, if any. gonna have to save myself, and toss the rest...this is not fun, and, again, you only drink this if you want to get F'ed Up. Well, more power to you, but I'll stick to tastier vehicles for that particular project.","feloniousmonk","Feb 28, 2005"

Crap stank like gym socks, and tasted like someone had barfed in the can. One of the only *beers* (tongue in cheek) that I almost didn't finish (gagged down about 2/3, then chugged the final 1/3), and could be one of the few reviews on this site that I stick with a *1*","Vancer","Feb 17, 2005"
1.03,-44.9,1.5,1,1,1,1,"Clear 40 bottle with camoflage designs and a lot of x's on it. Medium yellow color. Smells of skunky alcohol. Taste makes you think of never drinking beer again. Harsh corny sweetness and lots of alcohol. Purely disgusting, woke up with a terrible hangover the next morning.","TastyTaste","Nov 21, 2004"
2.73,46,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"In Vegas on Fremont St. watching the show, half way through the can the back of my brain started with a dull numb feeling. Smelled clean with a slightly sweet alcohol vapor. Tasted clean with a lemon-lime and rose like alcohol. A tad grainy in the finish with some sweet corn in the back. This beer is obviously produced for people that want a quick buzz.","Jason","Nov 17, 2004"

1.13,-39.6,1.5,1,1,1,1.5,"OK... I'm probably one of very few people to ever pour this into a glass! This is meant to be swilled directly from the can or bottle for the sole purpose of getting shitfaced very cheaply. Appearance was typical macro-piss yellow. A large, coarse white head quickly disappeared. Smell was a sickening mixture of cooked corn and alcohol. Taste was surprisingly sweet (nearly cloyingly so!) with maybe a hint of malt flavor, then loads of corn and alcohol. No hint of hops. Mouthfeel was thin and fizzy. If you're going to drink this, try to keep it as cold as possible... it gets worse when warm! I'll give it this, though: for what it is, it was amazingly smooth! So, I guess it succeeds as an alcohol delivery system... if not as a tasty beer!","jimdkc","Jun 06, 2004"
1.36,-27.3,2,1,1.5,1,1.5,"Camo is the strongest, cheapest swill I have ever had. At 8.5% ABV it serves one purpose, getting you shitfaced for small price. The 24 oz. cans are always trouble, but in it's 40 oz. incarnation it's bearable when served ice cold, but you better get it down before it warms up or you'll be making love to the porcelain god all night long. If you have $3 bucks and REALLY wanna get wasted, this stuff is second to none, but otherwise steer clear of this crap at all costs.","cptnjck101","Apr 27, 2004"
1.29,-31,2.5,1,1,2,1.5,"oh snaps. the camo tall boy. no one poors this out come on. but the can is camo colored! so it makes up for the fact that this beer looks like typical crapola. the smells is of alcohol, nasty grains and maybe paint thinner i dont know, but it isnt pleasant. the taste? well if served ice cold, the goal is to swallow as much of the devil fluid as possible because once you stop and breath your senses will wake up to how truly fould this stuff is.the mouthfeel is thin and mineralish and finishing the tall boy can be a little challenging, especially if it has started to warm, but you can do it cow poke. this is also one of those beers that gives you the nasty shitty drunk, so be forewarned. but hey for 99 cents a tall boy, what did you expect....have fun...","DESTRO","Nov 19, 2003"
1,-46.5,1,1,1,1,1,"Fizzy pale yellow beer. Large head. Aroma is a cross between wet cardboard and three day old garbage. It';s sweet, full of corn and watery, medicinal tasting and 8.6% alcohol, and on the bad side its only 8.6 % alcohol. This is by far the worst beer I've ever rated. I can't drink any more so the rest of this rating is from memory. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is medicinal. Aftertaste is alcohol and sweet. Turned on the tap and garbage disposal when I poured the rest of this crap down the drain...","beerguy101","Jul 31, 2003"

The hue of this beer was golden and there was no lacing.The nose was that of alcohol and it had a very weird flavor to it.This beer had a burning sensation as it was swallowed, it was bitey, it had an aftertaste that lingered and it was just plain unpleasing to my palate.","hotstuff","Jul 31, 2003"
3.11,66.3,3,2,3,3.5,4.5,"Ok, I thought I would get this, because it looked cheesey. I mean, come on, a camoflage can? Well, I was expecting something rather bland and without distinction. Sure, it's no Weste 12, but it's got it's perks. The color was a reddish/straw color. Had no head whatsoever after a few minutes. Sure the head started out big and fluffy, but fell back quicker than the Iraqi army. But seriously folks, this wasn't a bad brew as far as Malts go. It's got a kind of flat citrusy taste to it mixed with alcohol. The alcohol is strong at 8.5%. Lemme tell you, it ain't masked either.
