Red Bull Strong is drinkable... sort of, in the same sense that a charred, well-done steak is edible. Burnt steak has some nutritional value, and this beer will slide down your gullet and accomplish its purpose if you're determined enough. But why punish yourself? I realize I'm not the target demographic for beers like this, but it's possible to make a high-gravity lager that doesn't taste like total shit. Those Molson/Budweiser shots would be greatly preferable.","thehyperduck","Nov 14, 2013"

2.86,13,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Poured into an oversized wine glass. Clear straw with a nice soapy foam and no lace. Aroma of corn, standard beer smell, some grains, little to no hops. In the taste, pretty nondescript. Corn, light malt, alittle sweet with almost no bitterness. Very little alcohol noticed either. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, alittle flabby and watery. Overall, a decent malt liqour, not offensive, but not strong either. Malt Liquor light.","Stinkypuss","Nov 26, 2010"

3.8,50.2,3,3,4,4,4.5,"24oz can into a 16 oz+ Budweiser glass. for what it is meant to be, this one hits the mark. malt liquors are meant to get you feeling good quickly and 2 of these would do just that. goes down easy and doesn't have the offending alcohol taste as other malt liquors tend to have.","7beerphil","Jun 14, 2010"
2.96,17,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,4,"Its nearly flavorless. Its odd. Slight aftertaste. Kind of grainy. Light in body. Not very interesting. Oh well, VSL is a good beer I swear.","drabmuh","May 21, 2010"

3.77,49,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I got two-plus fingers' worth of foamy, fizzing, popping bone white head that was going down like an express elevator to the basement right after the pour, leaving a lot of sticky lacing in its wake. Color was a pale golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was lager-sweet, not bad for the style. Mouthfeel was medium with a crispness that was unexpected on the tongue. It did not taste rushed or skimped on, but was actually kind of pleasant to drink. Finish was slightly dry and a little malty, but still not unpleasant. Given its relatively low ABV, I would put it in the second tier as far as cooler space is concerned. It does not rate moving something else aside, but I would drink it ahead of many of its brethren in the style. I might also feel kind of embarrassed about being seen with it, kind of like the old saw about scooters and fat chicks - they're both fun to ride until your buddies catch you doing it.","woodychandler","Jul 25, 2008"
3.66,44.7,4,3,4,3,4,"Grabbed the menacing 710ml can, looks sweet. Just what a malt can should like, tall and with a menacing animal on it. Anyway, i poured this into a pint glass, nice ambery stock malt liquor color, very clear and had a nice white fluffy head. I like. Smells like every other malt, like rotten veggies. Its malt, thats what you get :D. This is an AMAZING malt liquor, booze is somewhat balanced, finishes sweet and not overly boozy, and extremely smoooth. Mouthfeel, thin and slick. Really good drinkability on this one, when its nice and cold. Top 5 malt liquors of all time. Nice and high ABV, great taste, what more do you need?","steeler","Beers"
2.3,-9.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,1.5,2,"Everynow and then its nice to venture into a city market store and pick up an economical malt shit liquor. This 22 ouncer was labeled ""Red Bull Xtra Long Malt Liquor"". The abv printed on the bottle was 5.9%. The beer poured a pours light yellow color with strong carbonation. The white head didn't last long. The aroma is malty, corny and slightly skunked. Virtually no hop presence at all but at the same time there is nothing that unpleasant its just very corn based. Light and caronated feel. This is moderatly drinkable. Im not sure i would do a 40 without wanting to barf but that can be a challenge for another day.","kbnooshay","0"
1.93,-23.7,3,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,"Not a good beer. Its got way too much alcohol flavor to be enjoyable. If you want Malt Liquor, there are better brands to be had, like OE800.","CAMRAhardliner","Jan 10, 2008"
1.33,-47.4,1.5,1,1.5,1,1.5,"Crisp but not clean on the palate with a bit of dryness and a lingering grainy texture. Starchy and weak at best. The remnants left on the tongue are unpleasant. I think I've had all I can take; the rest is going down the drain and that doesn't happen too often at my house. Use common sense and steer clear because I doubt anyone else thinks that joke is nearly as funny as I do.","letsgopens","Mar 15, 2007"
1.26,-50.2,2.5,1.5,1,1.5,1,"This is the stuff domestic violence is made of ; pours a clear pee yellow w/ a tinge of kidney-failure orange, faint white head, leaving no lacing at all in the big mug ; smells vinous and skunked, not much else ; taste is thick and adjunct-filled, maybe a hop note(?) somewhere ; a sticky-sweet med-cloying body, good co2 at least ; sorry, but, yuck, i drank a belgian strong pale ale before this and i think i'm going to throw that up and drink it again before i finish the last 2/3 of this 22 oz. of bile...","animal69","Feb 12, 2005"
2.04,-19.4,3,1.5,2,2,2.5,"Oddly enough the beer was better out of the can than the glass. I guess a lack of smelling the beer increased the flavor and drinkabiltiy. In short next time I will drink this from the can.","nlmartin","Aug 03, 2004"
1.46,-42.3,2,1,1.5,1,2,"Drinkable only if desperate for a quick, cheap buzz. Its better to drink from the bottle in a bag so you don't see it and, more important, and don't smell it.","ypsifly","May 03, 2004"
3.32,31.2,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,4,"Shockingly palatable Malt Liquor, and dirt cheap too. Not much aroma, not very long lasting head, and very little mouthfeel. Flavor is very weak, but innofensive. If you want a fairly strong (middle of the road for malt liquors) easy to pound beer this is a good bet. The bull is kind of cool looking too. Go get a 40.","Sixpack595","Mar 31, 2004"
2.07,-18.2,3,1,1.5,2.5,4,"As cheap beers go, this one is the big bull. If you want to get messed up quickly, Bull is the way to go. The odd flavoring of beer mixed with something is unique. Starts heavy and full of said flavor, doing a drive by on your tongue. Just make sure that you drink this before it gets warm. Have played a**hole with Bull before and woke up sleeping in a bush outside of my room. Dangerous stuff, but a fun time.","wailingwench","Feb 13, 2004"
2.85,12.6,3,3,2.5,3.5,3,"As dope as a forty is going to get. I did at least pour it into my glass while still in the brown paper bag. Clear yellow with a quickly disappearing head. Strong malt aroma with hints of corn. The taste was very much like the aroma. The only difference was that the corn was more pronounced. As fly as a forty is gonna get.","CBFanWish","Nov 16, 2002"
3.25,28.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pilsner glass. So light yellow in color that is almost clear. White head dissipates very quickly. Smells surprisingly malty for being so clear, which combines with the corn smell to make something that is not that bad for being of the malt liquor ilk. Full-bodied and lightly malted, this beer does a wondeful job of hiding that pesky 7.1% abv. Tastes a lot like many other macros, but somehow this doesn't have any of the skunky or foul adjunct tastes that many do. Not a bad buy for $4.50 for a 6 pack of 16 oz. cans.","TastyTaste","Oct 30, 2002"
4.72,86.6,4,4.5,5,4,5,"Good clean body not to much carbonation so it wont slow you down.Not an unplesent aftertaste I almost drank 3 /40oz. this is not bad for what it is and what it dose. Its not beer and its not trying to be!","Kwak","Aug 08, 2002"

2.5,-1.2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Crystal clear, pale gold body topped by a bright white head that's in-and-out in nothing flat. The aroma is heavily estery. Alot of fruitiness, very little malt, no hops. The body is medium/light but the mouthfeel is dull. The flavor is aggressive in everything but what a good beer should be. Rough. The malt that is present is sweet and basic, but lacking in character. There are no hops to speak of. The finish leaves a ""sweet spot"" at the front of the tongue, and a slight stickiness at the back of the throat. Not alot of good things to say about this beer. There are much better choices in the malt liquor category.","NeroFiddled","Jun 22, 2002"
2.6,2.8,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"I didn't pick up on any plastic can liner taste, or any hops with the 24oz can Schlitz Red Bull. But all the same, we will be seeing each other again.","BeerBob","Beers"
2.47,-2.4,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"uff-da......take schlitz malt liquor bull and ratchet it up a notch....yikes!   actually if you can get by all the adjunct unpleasantness, there is a bit of hop bite on the tongue that compliments the alcohol kick. this is the high octane, quick buzz brew for those who like the tongue tingling sensation of ""just the kiss of the hops"" schlitz products.  my foray into malt liquor territory has left me feeling comfortably numb, but not totally stupid.  try red bull for yourself.  you might like it, but your liver might not.","budgood1","0"
