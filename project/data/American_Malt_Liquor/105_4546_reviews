"I've been drinking this beer on rare occasions for many years. The old buzz bomb forties aren't available in my area anymore, but I wish they were. It is what it is and it ain't half bad. This is my go to beer for tomato juice beer cocktails."

"O - Considering the price and the 8% ABV this is not a bad beer. Granted, it must be served and consumed ice cold."

"I do believe this is one of the better high gravity's out there on the market. It has flavor, it has a good amount of lacing poured into a frosty mug. Even though it was a 40 ounce bottle that I dont know how long its been on the shelf at the little corner market i visited on my vacation to minnesota, it was not skunky and tasted bold and refreshing in my opinion. To each there own this is better to me than the traditional olde english!"
"I just want to say that this is a very nice malt liquor and I'm glad that I could try it. If it's one of those days where you want to drink cheap but you want a little more refinement, this does the trick."

"Had this in a 24 ounce can. Purchased this at Sunset Liquors in Madisonville, TN. Appearance is a dark golden character. Smelled like corn meets grassy overtones. Tasted like a rich bready mix of apples and a little bit of a fruity nose. Mouthfeel suggests a light to medium BMC with more of a malt overtone. Overall, a good 8.1 AML as a whole. It is very decent for cheap. 2 will get you loaded in a hurry. Do drink this when cold, it is much worse when it gets warm. And when warm, it has something of an aftertaste to it."

"If you're looking for something to sip on, this ain't it. If you want something chuggable that'll get you good and buzzed, this isn't a bad choice."

"Recommended over West Coast Olde English 800 (7.5%.)"

"Note: If you start sobering up before you go to sleep after drinking this, prepare to enter hell. There's no going back and there's no saving you. Filling up on food won't even help. Good luck not killing yourself. What is it in hobo beer that can make you feel so terrible?"
"Pours a golden yellow color, nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger creamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is kinda malty, grainy/ricy. The taste is slightly sweet, grainy/ricy. Light Body. Not too bad, but would most likey not try again."
"overall- What can you really say about this beer? Its pretty gross. If you want to get drunk for cheap then buy a olde English 800 thats all its good for."
"Notes: Meh, not overly impressed, but what I more or less expected. Average high gravity malt liquor. Overly sweet with corn and apple and alcohol."
"Miller, you have won."
"Pours a poor yellow color with a big white head. No lacing. Smells of booze and sweet corn. Tastes of corn, bread, and grain. You can taste the alcohol... quite nasty. Mouthfeel is too thin with poor carbonation. Drinkability isn't the best."
"D: I had my fill of this and shared it with friends (it was a buddy's birthday and it was a ""40s"" party). All agreed this was a pretty damn good malt liquor."
"For high alcohol malt liquors this is one of the better. Needless to say, it goes down with a struggle."
"Taste smooth as you throw it back. An hour later my 40oz is gone. I feel buzzed and well. Olde English done me well."
"Somebody in one of the forum posts about CANs in general and The CANQuest (TM) in particular was put off by the auditory nature of CANs. He hated the ""glug, glug, glug"" noise associated with a CAN pour, if you CAN believe it. My brother, when they package beer in a 24 fluid ounce CAN and you want to transfer it into a glass with a minimum of spliiling, ""GLUG!"" is all you're gonna hear! I had a whole buncha bone-white foam as the result of trying to pour into the glass and not the keyboard, but let's be fair and honest and call it about a finger with good retention after settling. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was closer to an adjunct lager than a malt liquor. It was honey-sweet underlain with whatev. There was a little of the fusel sharpness of the style, but I have been subjected to far worse in this epic journey, believe me. Really, this was not obnoxious and for a high gravity malt liquor, that is saying something. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was the standard sweetish fuel-like intensity of the style. Finish was bone-dry and I began to wish for a Hammond's pretzel as an accompaniment. Beautiful, heavy lacing throughout. I am not a fan of the style, by any means, but this was pretty dang good as they go. tone77, where did you find this in a CAN? I'm not recommending it for the cooler, but it might be something worthwhile in a paper bag without the weight of glass and a whole 40 to oneself. I'll bet I'm the high reviewer, yo!"
"Sweet and corn syrupy. Thick mouthfeel. I already know I wont be finishing this bottle, should have gotten this beast ICE cold first. I dont mind some regular OE every once in a long while, but this is not really all that fun to drink. Sweetness is pretty overwhelming with virtually no hops to help. The only other flavors I am getting is some lager yeast sulfur and heavy alcohol. Carbonation keeps things moving along better when drank straight from the bottle. Pretty foul concoction here, even by malt liquor standards."
"Overall: A medium body with a medium to full finish. This malt liquor actually isn't too bad. The alcohol is present in the beer but not too overwhelming."
"Since I already consumed the KBS I had wanted to be my 100th review, I thought a gag (literally) review would be funny. Joke's on me, my 100th review ended up being my first drain pour."
"RJT"
"Conclusion: We were having crappy beer night tonight as a joke. My wife bought Bud Light Golden Wheat and I bought OE as a joke 'cos I'd never had it and I'm doing my M.A. on medieval England. Not terrible, but not something I'd get again either. Better than Steel."
"Poured from a clear 40 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very malty. Taste is a combination of malts, corn, and alcohol. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew as far as malt liquors go."
"D: I don't know if I'll ever have this again, it's a strong malt with a lot of bad characteristics, not terrible, but certainly not worth the time or money, try Hurricane, or dare I say it Steel Reserve."
"From the 40 oz. bottle marked AUG3109-DO5111908. Sampled on December 15, 2009. After looking at earlier reviews I was expecting the worst. But quite frankly, I did not think this was as bad as all that. The pour was a hazy pale yellow with a generous supply of fizzy head. The aroma was of mild malts and hops with almost no noticeable alcohol, which tends to be common in these high gravity beers. The taste was a bit tart and pungent but not offensive. This is not the kind of beer I would buy regularly but for the purposes of this review, it was tolerable."
"big thumbs down for me"
"Appearance from this big olde 40oz. bottle is a light golden yellow with a very thin head and no lace. Smell is corny. Taste is sweet with somekind of chemical bitterness. Mouthfeel is a light medium with a lot of carbonation. Going down is not all bad (considering), but the chemical bitter aftertaste is what gets me."
"Looks like a typical malt - corn yellow, with little head. The smell is fusel alcohol with a metallic bite. The taste is about the same... fairly strong alcohol taste is present, even though this is a 'weaker' high gravity. One reviewer said that this is the only 40 that he can get hungover by after drinking - I agree - the next day is pretty harsh, even if you have had only one. In college I made the mistake of drinking two in about two hours and was wishing for death the rest of the night and the next day."
"Oh my, the Old Englsh High Gravity. This is going to be a doozy. It is a viscous golden colored liquid with a very poor tanish head. Smells very grainy and has some harsh alcohol aromas. The taste is also strong with bad alcohol and bitter grains. A medium body with lots of carbonation. 40oz of this about 39oz too much."
"Drinkability: The standard Olde English 800 was choke-downable, but this, this is just plain awful. They couldn't just leave the OE800 alone, could they?"
"Pours a very light yellow color that is extremely clear - not much head not much lacing and below average carbonation. The dominate smell is light hops and mild malts. First taste is light, very sweet, and lacking in flavor - not much body at all. Not much taste. Not worth your time."
"This is basically to drink when you just want some booze for cheap. Pours the way it looks in its clear bottle - golden amber color with a tall but airy white head that settles fast. It smells of really pungeant malts and a touch of hops. These flavors aren't mixed well together and they don't really mask the alcohol at all. It has a sharp mouthfeel and it's not very drinkable."
"Should be avoided unless you're a broke college student."
"High gravity messes you more if you are into that type of thing"
"...they all begin to look like movie stars. Oh the girls all get prettier at closing time..."
"Drunkablility - Way too high. +10"
"This beer poured the standard pale yellow color with a large 1 inch head that went away quickly. Smell was also pretty standard for a malt liquor: corn, adjuncts with little bit of a fruity odor. Taste was OK I guess, also fruity, with just barely a hint of malt. I could not detect hops at all, but continued to taste a fruityness that kind of bordered on a wine cooler. All this beer needed was a splash of strawberry extract and you've got Boonfarms!"
"Pours a true gold, crystal clear. Two fingers of head quickly recede to alomost nil lacing. Grain and adjunct smell with the common malt liquor esters and a faint medicinal scent difficult to place. Apple esters and astringent taste are the only flavors present. Medium body and light carbonation. The clean finish and smooth mouthfeel contrast the sharp alcohol bite and off-flavors, but are not enough to consider this a decent malt liquor."
"The color is a dark shade of honey yellow with a decent head. The aroma is a much maltier version of the macro cooked vegetable smell. The taste of OE HG is what puts this beer ahead of most other malt liquors. The flavor has a full-bodied, thick malt sweetness with just a touch of adjunct flavors. A slight alcohol taste comes out after this warms up a bit. For what it's worth, this is one of the best malt liquors on the market with a flavor comparable to Steel Reserve. Also for such a high alcohol lager the alcohol taste is pretty tame."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 40 ounce clear glass bottle with a screw cap, served in a Pilsener glass."
"Not drinkable at all..i'm pouring this out..not a good Malt Liquor at all."
"I poured my 40oz of Olde E HG into my glass and prepare to plummet into a familiar drunk, but without my warm cozy paper bag around my bottle. It pours a nice dark amber color... It looks pretty good for what it is and it actually had a head that stuck around for the first couple of minutes. It smelled a bit corny, but this is a malt liquor. The flavor is a corny sweetness that has a definite alcohol bite at the end since there is not enough malts or hops to balance it out, but again this is a malt liquor. Malt liquors are not my favorite, but every so often I get brave and want to rekindle my relationship with beers I drank when I was younger and poorer. This is 40oz of pure hell, but it is one of the better malt liquors you can find. Remember to pour some for your dead homies."
"Not bad at all for a ""High Gravity"" Malt Liquor. It poured a darker gold color than most of this style but with the same fizzy white head that left as quickly as it came. The smell was adjunct all the way with a very grainy, earthy scent that was not too pleasent. The taste was better than expected. The sweet malt dominated the flavor with a bit of grain flavor and an underlying aftertaste of alchohol. Better than Steele Reserve any day...but then again that isn't saying much!"
"As far as I am concerned, this is the best 40 available. That's not necessarily the highest praise, but on occassion, when cash is tight, a 40 is a nice option. This is not nearly as common as its non-high gravity cousin, in fact, I usually have a hard time finding it. The beer is a dark golden color, when consumed out of the bottle, some head is stirred up. The smell is somewhat unpleasant, it is reminiscent of burnt vegetables. The taste is slightly astringent, but it goes down smooth enough, in fact, I think it has a unique and fairly pleasant flavor. As far as drinkability goes, the alcohol definitely starts to get to you, and if you take your time finishing it, the warm remnants become extremely unpleasant. Gotta keep this one cold."
"The only reason Olde English is so sucessful as that it is a quick way to get drunk. The taste is awful in the beginning but the more you drink the more you will get used to it. Comes out of a 40 oz bottle, don't know how it pours, seems odd to pour a OE in a glass. The smell is high octane malty meat. The taste isn't to bad once you are used to it. Drink two of these and you fell great, so not very drinkable."
"This is a nice big manly brew! If you don't like it, you could still drink it to put hair on your chest. Whoa, one just sprouted! It's very similar to the original OE, but stronger alc and better taste. It's taste is a bit more pungent with hops, barley, corn, and sugar. The alcohol, though stronger, is hardly even there taste wise. I had to go to a seedy store to get it and that was the only drawback. Now that I am on my quest for great malt liquors, I have to go to seedy stores. I guess that's part of being an ""extreme"" BA. Thanks goodness it comes in a huge bottle, so I can drink it for a while."
"Just a simple yellow color, drank straight from the bottle. Smells of alcohol and sweetness. Not very good at all. You can taste no hops, a little malt, but there is a horrible overpowering flavor that I cannot place. It is foul and metallic and skunky, and full of alcohol. Not good at all."
"The body is a clear yellow when held to the light, but appears more amber in the glass. It's creamy, bright white head holds surprisingly well for a beer with so much alcohol; and it slowly drops to a thin surface covering, leaving some nice lace at the outset. Sweet, very lightly grainy malt greets you in the nose with a very delicate fruitiness. It's quite clean. It's medium-bordering-on-full bodied with a fine carbonation that's lightly effervescent and gently caresses the tongue. Crisp yet smooth. The flavor delivers a lightly grainy maltiness that's somewhat surprising as most examples as so obviously adjunct laden, and it's sweetness is tempered more by its alcohol than its low-key bitterness. It finishes drying despite its sweet malt with a wash of drying alcohol and dull bitterness - although some malt does linger. Overall, it's a surprisingly clean and well-made malt liquor that probably deserves a little more respect than it gets."
"bronze color, nice big thick head when poured into a glass. some cooked corn/adjunct aroma, not unpleasant. full bodied and a fairly smooth mouthfeel, the taste wavers back and forth from corn to corn syrup...a pretty harsh alcohol bite...after an overly sweet burnt sugar taste...and after swallowing....a burning sensation of alcohol settling in the stomach. at 8.0% ABV, this brew is designed to do one thing, and that is to get you buzzing hard and fast. it might be a good beer to soak bratwurst in before grilling...otherwise, as far as malt liquors go...it's not terrible but be careful. one forty should be enough in one sitting."
