Labatt Maximum Ice is good for precisely one thing - getting shitfaced on beer while spending as little money as possible. If you're not an alcoholic homeless person, I can't think of any compelling reasons to bother with this one. For the record, I did manage to finish the can, but I won't be picking up another in the future.","thehyperduck","Mar 07, 2014"

I figured you got to know what the cheap beer tastes like to know what to good beer tastes like, right? Pours a hazy yellow color with a thin pillowy head. Has a strong grassy, grain scent. Taste is a sweet grainy taste that is mildly malty as well. Texture is average but it does have decent drinkability. I was really surprised how decent this actually was for a cheap ice beer.

1.78,-28.2,3.5,3,1,1.5,1.5,"24 oz can says it's brewed in Rochester NY maybe at Genesee. Weighs in as a big American lager or a small malt liquor. Pours a deep yellow golden almost apple juice like tone with a bright white head forming thick and dwindling even quicker. Thin speckled lacing left behind, let's see how the rest goes. Aroma has a strong cooked veggies high adjunct ridden nose going on not much sweetness or malt or hop action served cold to protect my palate. Flavor has a dominant sweetness almost table sugar extreme sweetness, pretty much sickeningly corn syrup high fructose that should have been fermented out. Not to hot with alcohol just one rough sip that seems to never get better as you try to actually consume this creation. Absolutely horrible example of beer in general but the sad part is I can't even consider it to be a good malt liquor many a better cheap drunks out there. Pass on this one it was like a dollar with some change for this big can. Mouthfeel is harsh I don't know why but it's hard to take a sip, excessive CO2 medium to light body becomes cloying quickly after taking a few sips. Overall pure shite that really should avoid the beer market, why is there a need for this stuff.","WVbeergeek","Jun 26, 2011"

Cloyingly sweet flavour, nearly no bitterness, boozy finish. A bit metallic in the finish, significant warmth but not hot. Medium bodied and dry, fizzy, not an appealing texture. I'm not a fan, even for the style.","DrJay","Sep 27, 2010"
1.62,-34.7,4,2,1,1,2,"This is the worst beer I ever tasted by LaBatt. When pouring it into a glass and it had a nice large white head that had good lacing, but not as good retention. I was not impressed with the smell of rotting cereal or rice that got spoiled. When tasting it all I could taste was spoiled corn and thought I was drinking urine. The mouthfeel was a watered down poor excuse of a beer, felt like something spoiled and smelly was in my mouth. I know this has 7.1% ABV, but if someone wants a beer just for getting drunk with a high alcohol content I'd say go with Steel Reserve or even Nat Ice would be better than this. I paid $1.59 for this can and I don't think I'll be able to finish it.","DannyDan","Sep 26, 2010"

The nose comprises dirty rice (real dirt, not the style of rice mix known as dirty), bad wheat, and light syrup. The taste is kinda heavy on the corn syrup, while the burnt wheat brings up the rear. The body is a heavy-ish light, with a light moderate carbonation and a steel-y finish. Not the worst thing consumed tonight, but definitely not the best, either.","TMoney2591","Aug 25, 2010"
2.28,-8.1,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2,"The appearance is the golden I would assume the malt liquor should be, but it is still scary to me. The smell is of the corn and rice that you would expect, but there is a funkiness that I can't place...I blame Canada. The taste is much more bitter than I would have liked. The other flavors of it include many things that you would have experienced in the aroma. As far as I am concerned this is Canadian Ghetto Juice. This isn't very good, the mouthfeel is exactly what I would have expected, corn syrupy and unpleasant. This is drinkable if you are sitting on the curb outside the liquor store in Toronto, that's pretty much it.","Vdubb86","Jun 06, 2010"

It was far enough back from the lip that short of a complete inversion of the CAN, beer was guaranteed to run down the sides of the CAN. Grrr. My pour gave me a finger of foamy, bone-white head with medium retention. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the now-infamous smell of green apples. And plastics. What more could I ask for? Mouthfeel was medium with a sweetish apple-cereal quality on the tongue. How do they make this? The finish was really biting with an alcohol heat in the throat. This is not the way to go on a holiday weekend.","woodychandler","May 16, 2010"

3.86,55.6,4,3,4,3,5,"This is a beast of a beer I used to enjoy a lot in high school. I revisited this beer recently....ah the memories. This truly is one of the nicest looking macros I've ever seen, pours out a nice golden yellow color, with active carbonate and a 1 inch head that stuck around for a while, and then receded into a ring of lacing. Truly nice for a macro. Smell on the other hand was average, smelled like every other strong macro does, corny and boozy. Ah the maximum ice that I see so commonly in parks, and smashed in school yards, it does taste alright. Honestly for the ABV of this beer, it tastes like a stock 5% macro. Goes down smooth, with little bitterness, and little anything. Mouthfeel, is a bit thin tho, and overly carbonated. I have to give this one a 5 for drinkability, honestly when you walk into a LCBO near closing time, they will be sold out of this, people make fun, but they will drink this. When cold this is a dangerously easy beer to drink. Trust me, if you wanna get drunk on the cheap, this is one of the best beers to use.","steeler","Oct 01, 2008"

High ABV is not blended or mellowed at all and comes through harsh and offensive. If you're looking to get hammered and don't care at all about flavor, then I guess it would do the trick. Personally, I don't think having to drink enough to catch a buzz would be worth subjecting myself to the experience.","Hoagie1973","Aug 09, 2008"

Medium low carbonation. Aromas are quite sweet, and have notes of corn and grain leading the pack of otherwise normal smells of macro beer. Taste is very sweet and dense; strong notes of sweet alcohol esters, corn, thick malt. Not bad. Mouthfeel is boardering on sticky sweet and syrupy, but remained tolerable. Drinkability is average.
