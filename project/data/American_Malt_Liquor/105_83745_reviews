"O- not entirely offensive, it's pretty tolerable up front, but the finish is about as harsh as any other Icehouse beer"
""
"This beer is only worth drinking if you are trying to get drunk.  It tastes as sweet as you would expect from an 8% malt liquor that costs under a dollar for a tall boy.  Really atrocious.  That being said, if you are going to buy something like this, it is better than steel reserve or hurricanes."
""
"If you have a choice @ 2 for $3.00 between this and Steel Reserve 211 Triple Export... You're better off going with this, and that's all I have to say... about that."
"Pours a golden yellow in color with a very thin white cap layer. Some very light spotty lacing was seen but not a lot. The aroma is mostly of sweet corn and alcohol for the most part. The taste is pretty much the same with the sweet corn right up front with lots of alcohol taste. Hard to drink actually. Have to drink this one very cold and probably fast but it still isn't good. Guess if you want a fast cheap buzz then this is your brew. Not a fan. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Had to pour about half of my half out after several sips."
"Very sweet not too sweet. Lots of corn. Have to drink this extremely cold.  Feel the alcohol kick in within minutes. A good malt liquor or strong beer. Miller is not ashamed of its line of Malt beverages like STEEL or Olde English 800 (love their OE High Gravity)"
"At 8.0% alc./vol. it's got the strength of a malt liquor, but not the body or the depth of 'malt' flavor normally associated with the style... ...  aaahhh, and it just occurred to me, perhaps that's why it's named ""Edge"". Or perhaps it gives you an edge, because if you drink this quickly the alcohol will certainly hit you just as fast (at least for the pint can) and you'll end up with a little ""Dutch courage"". Overall, given the intentions behind it, it's not bad but on a world-wide scale of beer with a 3 being about average it just doesn't meet that mark."
"It's good for what it is: cheap, drinkable beer that'll give you a quick buzz. Out of all the cheap ass hobo beer, this is one the easiest to gag down."
""
""
"Overall: You ever play Truth or Dare, and take the Dare and regret it? That's this beer. And now I'm $1.29 poorer to show for it. :("
""
"O: Much worse than I expected and my expectations were pretty low. Much too hot and much too boozy."
"I didn't realize I was grabbing a malt but that is what I got.  Very cheap but it tastes like cheap tangy, dry beer.  If you have an acquired taste for malts, this is probably pretty good.  If not, its not a good beer to drink and enjoy a movie.  If you just want to get drunk...pinch your nose and guzzle it.  Not for me."
"Let's face it, no one is drinking this for the flavor or to savor the aromas.  For an 8% malt liquor there is no real perception of alcohol as long as it's cold - really cold!  If you're looking for something like this it is certainly worth a try.  Seriously, if you don't like it you're out like what, a buck and some change?"

"Wow this stuff is really nasty only got it cause its the only malt liquor available at the store that knows me and I lost my ID. Thankfully that is not a problem anymore I got it now but when I came to a realization that I had peed in a beer can as well as had a few with left over beer in it and I could not tell by smell or taste which one was the beer. I then realized this is some nasty shiz its like they bottled urine and I am never drinking it again. I even like 211 better than this slop."

"It's an 8abv icehouse...no one buys these for their delectable taste! That being said, it's one of the best cheap beers with high abv. Better than steel reserve and better than EQ. Pours with a more impressive head than I would have thought, but after 90 seconds or so it's gone. Quickly receding lace. Smells sour. Like sour apple and corn. Taste is pretty much the same. It's okay honestly."

"O: Curiosity got the best of me when I bought this. It's not good, but it is a decent malt liquor. No terrible boozy, chemical, or fusel flavors puts this above many of its competitors, for what that's worth."
"to me for a higher abv icehouse this is a pretty good bang for your buck.. I purchased a 24 ounce can for 1.10 after tax.. It pours your typical american adjunct lager color.. yellow fizzy water id say.. the smell is of musky corn.. the taste is actually nothing but a regular icehouse with a little more punch but the alcohol is not noticable.. So overall i say it is a okay beer, i cant complain ive had worse.. I give it a thumbs up !"
"Price is icing on the cake."

"Icehouse Edge brewed by Miller Co. This brew pours out a dark amber color with a small white head. Now this brew is 8.0 abv. The smell is sweet like male liquor. The tease is sweet as well it reminds me of a malt liquor even though it's a lager. I'm impressed on how smooth this brew goes down. There is nothing bad about this brew. I would get it again. Over all I'm giving this brew a 3 out 5."

"Me and 2 friends went on a beer run one of them points out these 24oz cans that are $1.75 ea. and says there like a step below Natural Ice which is what we get when we want a cheap buzz so at 8% alcohol I got us 2 a piece. Back at the pad we pour it into mugs and its a dark yellow golden color with a nice head looks good so I smell it and yuck its a putrid rotten dirty dish water chemical kind of smell thats when I hesitated but took a sip. I for sure was not impressed one bit. You can taste massive amounts of corn and there is that dirty dish water and chemical taste. Kinda sweet you can taste the alcohol but they do pretty good at covering it up. Bubbly mouthfeel which I dont complain about with good tasting beers but the texture makes it just more worse. Gave me the shits after drinking 2 and a head ache the next day which never happens I never get hang overs and I drank plenty of water with it. It got me pretty tipsy thats about all its good for."
"its worth a purchase. frankly i think its the best high gravity next to shlitz vsl"
"Drinking this will get you drunk, but not a good drunk. it makes your head hurt and makes you want to get some sleep."

"Meh. It's not the best beer I've ever drank, but, not the worst. It kinda burns going down. It has a strong taste that I can't really get myself to enjoy. I drank the whole can because I hate wasting things. But, this isn't something I'll purchase again. I've never tried regular Icehouse, and after this, I don't know if I want to."

"I gave it a 3 on the mouth feel because I oddly enjoy the creamy fizziness. Can stuck out to me so I grabbed it. Taste is ok, real drinkable, not much of a flavor profile... It's just one of those beers you get if your looking for a cheap buzz... Feels so weird in the mouth... Like a mouth of fizzy whipped cream."
""
"hehe...bought this on a whim at a gas station on the way home from work. I've had keystone before back during my younger days and before the craft beer Renaissance that is currently taking place here in Alabama. There is no way a person could enjoy this beer unless they were hoping to get drunk as quickly as possible. The taste is fizzy corn and nothing else. Save yourself from pissing later...you're already holding in your hand. Bad brew."
"Overall: don't kid yourself; this is pretty low-quality stuff. But for a can of high-grav malt liquor, there's worse stuff out there. Note of warning: don't let it warm up!"

"As macro lagers go regular Icehouse is just fine. It doesn't really stand out from the pack in any notable way. Icehouse Edge on the other hand is horrible. I can't take enough sips of this to think about what exactly I'm tasting beyond something like Windex. While there is some kind of sweet flavor happening in here, the main and distracting thing is some kind of chemical cleanser taste. It is straight up bad. I can drink just about anything in the standard gas station line up. I almost never do, but once in a great while I will have some high school nostalgia and go get some cheap snacks and some tall boy cheapo macro lagers. But this is something else altogether. It is a horrid product. I got such a great deal on it and now I guess I understand why. I poured out all but a few sips of it. It may be the worst beer I have ever had."

"I'm not a beer snob, and I enjoy the merits of a cheap beer from time to time, but this is absolute garbage. I had one can and immediately felt hungover, which makes me seriously question its ingredients. I did have it cold, which should help, but any crispness was overtaken by a skunky, sweet taste."
"I will likely never buy this again as there are definitely better malt liquors out there that are generally pretty easy to get.Though I wish they cost as little as this one cost me in the poorest, sketchiest part of Pensacola, Florida. $1.59/24 oz? Why is it that nothing costs that little in Austin? Except maybe Keystone or Busch. But I'd pay an extra 40 cents for an OE or a Natty Daddy anyway. It's worth it. They're noticeably better. Good flavour and more of it. This is relatively tasteless except for a hint of metal and yeast. Great for a bum. Not so great for me. I'm glad I got a chance to give it a try, though. Thanks, Florida."
"Overall Drinkability: Pretty gross stuff overall. The flavor makes/breaks this. I feel like Miller could make big bucks marketing this stuff. It's cheap...high alcohol...and has a good design."

"Taste is sweet, corny. Good head and bubbly. Really reminds me of St. Ides without the harsh ending. Got a couple of these to start the weekend out before switching to higher end beer. Does the trick; it's got a punch to it and no lingering assault on the taste buds. If you're looking for a good malt liquor this is one to buy."
"Not good, but does a good job of masking its strength, so its accomplishing what it sets out to, a tasteless high alcohol swill for those just looking for a cheap buzz."

"O - If I need a cheap beer I always look to malt liquors. They also have higher abv so I pick these up after work to relieve the stress of another day of hell."
"Very malty/ corny.. alcohol sweet.. swill. This has one good use. Getting wasted. Simple and plain. Not a brew you wanna sip or let warm up. For its style.. they do.a decent job but as far as quality.. it should be illegal... but i must say.. these will get you drunk... if your looking for a cheap strong buzz.. just grab a few of these"
""
"O - Overall, this is once again, just another cheap beer. I doubt I'd have again."
"tastes just like an adjunct with some vodka splashed into it. even ice cold this is a gnarly brew. avoid it."
""
"The Crack & Glug revealed another ""Greg Koch Special"" - a fizzy yellow beer for this wussy. Two fingers of dense, bone-white head sat atop the liquid and had such retention as to slow me down. Color was a pretty sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was not just sweet, but ridden with corn. I have mentioned silage before in reviews and here was yet another unpleasant example. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was like nail polish remover. It had a cloying sweetness which coupled with its high gravity ABV made it a roaring hangover CANdidate. Finish was likewise cloying sweet and nothing that would bear repeating."
""
"Overall – While the aroma and initial tastes were quite nice for a malt, the finish to the taste was rather offensive. Not the best malt out there."
""
"Finally found this stuff at a gas station whilst fillin' 'er up. It pours a clear sallow topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises corn, funky wheat, powdered sugar, and a faint hint of booze. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong vein of perfume-y vinyl. Nice. Real nice. Thanks for that one, there, guy. A bunch. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty sad little beer. I honestly didn't expect too much from it, but it's bad regardless."
"Pours a deep golden yellow color with a thin off white head that quickly shrunk. The smell is of sweet and sour grains, not much else besides it's slightly metallic. The taste is pretty much the same as the smell, lots of sweet grain and some metal, no hop's detectable. The beer is thick with low carbonation and a kind of syrupy feel. This beer isn't as bad as the other 8% cheap beers but it's still not that great, don't want to bash."
""
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, some green apples. Taste is not so good, alcohol is present, plastics, corn and grains, damn these 24 oz. cans.Feels light in the mouth and overall I got what I paid for, a cheap buzz."
"Grains are noted in the taste up front with a slight lingering alcohol bite moving in at the end. For the malt liquor style this is fairly typical although that pear thing was a slight bonus."
"Certainly no worse than bud light or coors light...with a much bigger kick."
""
""
"Golden-brown beer with a thick, foamy head. Sweet, fruity aroma with dry grain and corn notes and alcohol esthers. Tastes of sugary vegetables and not much else. The initial few sips bordered on repulsive, but it somehow gets better if you keep drinking. Maybe my taste buds have gone into a coma. Lacks the offensive musty, metallic taste of some malt liquors but, other than that, isn't anything to write home about. It'll get you drunk and isn't that what malt liquor is for?"
"RJT"
"If I consider the style: this was average. It was grainy, sweet and warm as expected. It was high abv and sorta drinkable from the can. I won't buy it again, but it is a very cheap buzz."

"I drank Icehouse in college and actually enjoyed it, and still get it every once in a great while when I feel like slumming it, but I can't ever see trying this again. I have no better words, it's just yucky."
