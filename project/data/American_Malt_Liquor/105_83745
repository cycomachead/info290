Have to drink this one very cold and probably fast but it still isn't good. Guess if you want a fast cheap buzz then this is your brew. Not a fan. Medium-bodied with good carbonation.

Or perhaps it gives you an edge, because if you drink this quickly the alcohol will certainly hit you just as fast (at least for the pint can) and you'll end up with a little ""Dutch courage"".

I for sure was not impressed one bit. You can taste massive amounts of corn and there is that dirty dish water and chemical taste. Kinda sweet you can taste the alcohol but they do pretty good at covering it up. Bubbly mouthfeel which I dont complain about with good tasting beers but the texture makes it just more worse.

I almost never do, but once in a great while I will have some high school nostalgia and go get some cheap snacks and some tall boy cheapo macro lagers. But this is something else altogether.
