3.68,48.4,3,3,4,3.75,4,"The smell is sweet and not unlike other malt liquors, but the taste is unlike anything I've ever had in a malt liquor before. I'm surprised the reviews aren't higher because this is clearly an attempt at changing up malt liquor for the beer connoisseur. It tastes STRONGLY of yeast, like it was bottle conditioned. Or, I guess, can conditioned in this case. It takes a lot away from the sweetness and the thinness that is the status quo in malt liquors. As a fan of some malt liquors, I'm not sure if I like this significant departure, but as a fan of quads, I enjoy it. So, I'm torn as to whether it's really OK for it to be somewhere in between. It is so far from what I was expecting. It's like someone tried to make a lager into a quad with really low quality ingredients, but with plenty of know-how nonetheless. Strange, but enjoyable. I think I'm going to have to rate it pretty highly. One problem is that it's not as refreshing as other malt liquors or as quads because it lacks that fruity quality. It's just pure yeast flavour. It retains a bit of that chemical flavour of regular Steel Reserve, but the yeast covers it up pretty well. Weird, wild stuff and definitely quite different from ordinary silver-canned Steel Reserve.","ElCommodoro","Nov 12, 2012"

Taste is corn, some alcohol and grains, a touch of malts.

Everything about this beer is laughable from a true appreciator of beer, as the company titles it "Triple Export," as if it has some high status as an export beer, moving on to describe the production process and the high quality of ingredients, and finishing their lauding with the statement already mentioned earlier.

My other mission is to sample every DIPA I can get my hands on, a much tastier decision in my opinion. Now, onto the Steel Reserve. This beer pours a clear golden color with a 1 inch head that fades rather quickly. The bubbles rising to the top of my glass are large indeed, and I know this means that this beer is full of adjuncts. The first whiff confirms this as I can detect aromas of corn and a sweet, funky odor coming from the glass. The taste is of corn, adjuncts and overcarbonated water with a bit of a citrusy, sweet aftertaste. I tasted the alcohol early, but as I finished the 24oz can, I really didn't taste the alcohol anymore. Strange. For 99 cents, I guess this stuff isn't too bad.
