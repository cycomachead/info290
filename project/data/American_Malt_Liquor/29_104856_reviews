"Oddly of the 5 people who tried it we all had the same opinion it gives you instant heart burn. It is very hard to finish even one because its extreme sweetness. We tried to chase it and mix it but we found the only thing it tastes good with is orange juice. I gave it away to a neighbor who loves those rita's and she said it was bad I would never buy it again nor try the other flavors because of how bad it was"

"Just not very good, kinda gross really. Too  sweet"
"O - I am making Mexican dishes and thought what the hell. It's okay for what it is. It is awfully sweet though."
""
"It's refreshing when you don't have beer"
""
"Mmm... Alcoholic Kool-Aid, with a light carbonation."
"Can: sample from the grocery store. Poured a fizzy bright red color beer with light disappearing head. Aroma of sweet cranberry syrup smells nothing like beer. Taste is also dominated by sweet cranberry notes with have more in similar with syrup than actual cranberry. Body is light with spritzy carbonation. Not sure how much beer is really used in this drinks?"
""
"This tastes like a wine cooler. It's not beer but a nice fruity and boozy drink."
""
""
"O: Pretty easy to drink because it is not quite a sweet as the other Rita products and the alcohol is very well hidden - not sure that I would want to have more than one of these in a session but it is not offensive."
"Serving type: can"

""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-five once aluminum can, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
"Overall: Not good, but nowhere near as bad as I was anticipating. This is basically hard fruit punch/kool-aid rather than beer, so it's a bit hard to rate, but for what it is, it's not bad."

"Yep - add an already barely tangential beer brand name to an effort clearly aimed at non-beer-drinkers, and what have we - oh, right, a cocktail, one which actually has a lot more merit as a quaffable beverage (ya know, the fruit and the ABV), than the base watered-down beer.  I'm still astounded at how far AB-InBev has to take things before BA treats them like they do craft ciders."

"So... I got a mixpack and decided to review these guys. The appearance is bright red with pink foam. The smell is all sugar with some cranberry and lime scents coming through. The taste was very similar with so much sugar it made my teeth hurt after a few sips. I found the aftertaste to be a big turn off. At least the mouthfeel was thin enough and it wasn't too syrupy."

"The loud Crack! told me that it had not lost any of its carbonation since I initially bought it, but given that there was going to be 25 (!) fl. oz. of it, the Glug would not be inverted. Watching it pour into my glass caused me to involuntarily let out a guffaw of laughter. It was magenta! OMFG! It fizzed like soda pop, quickly reducing its head to nothingness, leaving me with a glass filled with what I CAN only describe as looking like beet juice (SRM = N/A), but with great clarity. It did not smell like beet juice, however. It smelled like cranberry jelly on the table at Thanksgiving at my maternal Grummy's house every year when I was growing up. I just could not help but laugh again. It is very difficult to take a beer such as this seriously. Mouthfeel was thin, but fizzy, very much like soda pop. More laughter. The taste was very tart, very much like cranberry and with the addition of lime, it was like drinking alum. I do not think that I will be playing the trumpet right after I am done with this. My lips were puckered harder than last summer, when the Old Lady put me on an eastbound train, possibly out of her life forever. Oh no! This beer is causing melancholia to set in and there was no warning on the label! Finish was reminiscent of a SweeTart CANdy. It had both a sweetness and a tartness, with the emphasis on tart. It was not ""Awful"" as it seems to be currently rated, but neither was it something that I would want to drink a second time. It was like fizzy Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice Cocktail. Ha ha ha."

"O-I think this is what they were trying to produce, and they did a nice job"

"Pours a purplish-red in color with a very small head that goes away in like a minute. No lacing was seen. Slightly above average carbonation. The aroma is of faint cranberries with a hint of lime but no grains. The taste wasn't too great. Like a cheap cranberry juice cocktail with some grain alcohol added. No 'beer' taste at all. On the tart side as would be excepted. If I wanted a Margarita, I would make one! :)"

"I guess why I am really disappointed is because I was hoping for some kind of beer taste. There was none. It is like a smoothie that has alcohol in it: and even that was a disappointment. You can't taste the alcohol. I get where they get Brrr- Rita from trying to compare it to a Margarita. However, I think it should just be called Bud Light Smoothie (Lime)."

"O-Less syrupy sweet than other beverages in this category. Reminded me less of a margarita and more like a cranberry/vodka drink w/ lime. Repeat purchase is highly unlikely despite the ease at which this beverage can be consumed."
"Overall, I can give props to flavor for really nailing the cranberry taste. This tastes like actual cranberry juice, with a little bit of sugar, carbonation, and of course alcohol mixed in. Not terribly sweet like the other Ritas, but also not really a beer. An interesting, and not bad, flavor for the holidays."
