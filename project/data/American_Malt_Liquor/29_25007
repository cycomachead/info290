3.03,26.3,2.75,2.75,3.25,3,3,"Hurricane is a surprisingly solid malt liquor, arguably my favorite of the ones I've tried. Many of them are either far too thin to be enjoyed, suffer from a pungent taste if their temperature drops just a few degrees, or shamelessly bear their alcohol in the taste, making for an unappetizing experience (I'm looking at you, Camo Silver Ice and sighing whenever I see the Camo Black Extra 24oz can in my fridge). Hurricane doesn't provide an overcompensating palette of flavors nor does it find itself being too thin and basic to really be enjoyed on a level other than a dirt-cheap malt liquor. It's genuinely pleasing, packs a simple but refreshing taste to it, and provides a nice buzz if the can is drank fast enough. It's a marginally-winning combination.","SteveJeremy","Jul 29, 2014"

Again, the fruitiness shows up in the taste, and the alcohol can also be detected. It sorta coats the mouth with an oiliness. Medium body. Fairly dry finish and kinda sour. Overall, it is what it is, and that is all that it is.","priwen","Jul 09, 2014"

That remains to be seen, one can not know its true nature until he ingests one in its entirety; another property that 40's share with sex toys. I recommend this beer be paired with a Burger King Angry Whopper™ on an overcast spring day in order to allow the flavours of both to fully develop. This beer is not recommended for extended cellaring, unless ABV exceeds average range. Enjoy.","Newrad2","Jul 08, 2014"

Smell was light grain and cornwith a touh of alcohol, not impressed, but was I expecting to be. Taste was rather bland as well, just a grainey malty cheap mess. Overall cmon man what do you expext.

The taste is actually not too bad, sweet with a very slight malt taste and alcohol burn going down the throat. It tastes basically like a souped up macro lager. The reason I'm reviewing this malt liquor is because they recently started showing up in stores here in NC and I wanted to try a few just for the hell of it.

The taste is bad at best, sorta, not really sweet with a strong bitter taste that rounds it out, but try chugging and that old sweet taste rears its head. BARF! The mouthfeel is terrible- watery with carbonation that coats your mouth. With this taste and mouthfeel you know the drinkability is going to be shitty. There are much better malt liquors out there.
