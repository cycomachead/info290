"O:  Lower tier, but not bottom tier.  Do not let warm.  Repeat, do not let warm."
"M/O- The rubber hit the road and it's an awfully bumpy road!  Outside of the better than expected look, this is everything I expected and less!  Thin bodied, palate scrubbing carbonation and unpleasant flavors have led me to decide that this belongs in the reject pile!  I'm sure the good people of the Philippines know full well that this is pure swill.......good for the party crowd I'm sure!"
"Like a cider and beer hybrid"

"Gave it a 3, it's drinkable, strong, sweet.  When I think 'Malt Liquor', I definitely think Mickey's, Old English, etc.. this isn't a gross farty beer - it's a smooth, malty, lager.  So while the categorization may be debated, it's quite enjoyable."
"I will not drink this beer unless there are no other choices."

"Needs to be served cold. A basic malty beer but it can be refreshing under the right conditions. Average as a whole, but I don't hate it the way that some seem to hate it."

"Tastes light, a bit sweet, touch of malt with caramel and buttery notes. Fizzy on back, kind of bitter carbolic note without much complexity. Very slight roundness from body but otherwise booze is not detectable, which is to its credit. But then it's like a strong beer without the flavour/complexity so what's the point? Just dangerous, really. Have a lighter beer if you want something easy drinking."
"Drinks easy for the ABV, doesn't really taste like a malt liquor to me, too fruity & smooth. Not bad, I'm sure if I drank enough, a fierce hangover could be had... Better than its rating, but having had this in past, I would say this beer probably goes down hill quickly if exposed to UV light or to much heat. If given limited choices, this might work, other wise caveat emptor on this"

"Pours a clear golden-orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, sugar, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet grain and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is fairly drinkable and not as offensive as I was expecting it to be."

"Had a bottle with a skillet of sisig at Maharlika in NYC. Overall, it wasn't offensive, but it was also pretty boring. It tasted like a bland, clean export lager, with none of the vegetal off-flavors that usually come with a malt liquor. I guess that's good. Don't feel the need to the try this. San Miguel would have been a slightly more interesting beer."

" The taste has a light malt flavor with the sweetness of malt but smooth and gentle with a more dry presence as the alcohol is there making the beer seem thinner as a result which is not bad it is not hot, just strong with mild spice probably from the elevated carbonation giving that carbonic element. Overall I like this for what it is - Malt liquor...it is simple and does the trick, not great flavor but better than many I have tried and I would drink this again"

"In the Philippines, as far as bang for the buck and flavor, this is the one. As in many countries, the one brewery controls most, if not all, of the market. And as in most of southern Asia, all the available brews are sub-par."

"O: This beer doesn't have a very exciting taste, but is easy to drink and is pretty good when compared to other beers in the style."
""
"Unfortunately, though, that's it's main benefit. It actually comes across as a pretty bland, if drinkable lager. So the hidden booze is just a trap or a benefit, depending on your preference."
""
"Overall: not good"
""

"Pours a two finger white head that vanishes quickly leaving no lace. Crystal clear light amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Sweet grain nose and flavor is malty sweet with a light hop finish. Boring, barely a lawnmower beer. 330ml bottle, from Gift Specialists Oceanside, California."

"Much more diacetyl than I recall, and the fruity esters are offputting, as well as the alcohol heat."

"Sharp astringent alcohol, apple, dull flavors, light watery carbonation, though it has a fuller feel to the body for an AML. Dull grains, dry finish with some perceptible alcohol in the taste. Plain and rough around the edges... not the most terrible malt liquor out there, but still not worth revisiting."

"O â€“ Another on of these hot summer days brews in a foreign country type. Its perfectly fine for a beach, boat or humid day. It will go down quick and easy and its at least got some taste."

"A malt liquor, sure - it's got all the trademarks, yet that overused concept of 'drinkability' strangely applies here, dunno why. Oh, right, I've suitably lowered my expectations, a la re-runs of SNL."
""
""
"This beer is kind like a sub-par American light beer like Bud Light, boo these guys for pretty a less than beer beer in a cool looking bottle and using up a decent name that an Irish Red would have been proud to carry."
""
""
""
"Overall - Definitely not one of the better malt liquors.. but I don't really like them in general anyway."
"Bleh. Gimme a Colt or OE800."
""
"Body is weak and boring like most light lagers from the region. But honestly, I'd happily drink this as my beer of choice if I lived in the Phillippines."
""
"It was listed as Malt Liquor on the bottle, but I found it to be more like a strong lager, as it's listed here. At a $1.75, this beer is worth a shot if you see it and I might try it again as a walk-around beer as the weather warms up."
"This is honestly a decent no-brainer beer and one I wouldn't mind trying again."

"This is a brew from San Miguel (Thailand) Ltd., Pathumthani, Thailand - I am not sure whether it's also brewed in Philippines or not - it is definitely different from Red Horse Liquor"
