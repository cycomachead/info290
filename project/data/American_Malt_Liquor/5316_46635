3.03,-13.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Bottle: Poured a bright yellow color ale with a medium size white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of light cereal notes is pretty bland. Taste is also dominated by light cereal notes with adjunct barely noticeable. Body is about average with good carbonation. Nothing really special about that one and I canâ€™t say I would have notice this was malt liquor if it had been a blind tasting.","Phyl21ca","Jan 09, 2015"

2.99,-14.6,2,3,3.25,3,2.75,"Pours a typical clear yellow with a thick but effervescent white head. Aroma is malty, slightly fruity, crisp but unremarkable. Flavor is more fruity than malty, somewhat sweet but not cloying, not quite bold but better than what the aroma promises. Texture is smooth, but lacking in fizz or viscosity. OK, not so hot, but I am more of a stoutie; a lager lover should give it a fairer shake.","Cyberkedi","Mar 17, 2014"

3.66,4.6,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a murky orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, and nail polish remover aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and alcohol flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some odd aromas but the flavors are tasty.","UCLABrewN84","May 08, 2013"

3.8,8.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured into an Arrogant Bastard Ale pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a thin white head with good retention and slippery lacing. Aroma dominated by biscuit malt, a hint of citrus. Flavor is sweet bready malt, vague fruit esters and just a touch of pure alcohol. Pretty cool, the brewer captured the essence of a cheap malt liquor (malt and alcohol), but made it pleasantly drinkable. The hint of pure grain alcohol was genius and appropriate for the style. Medium bodied with a touch of creaminess, much too nice a mouthfeel for a malt liquor, but I appreciated it. I'm not sure I'd buy this as a go-to beer, but for an attempt to craft-ize a classic brown bag American style, they nailed it. I like this Brewers Share series. Most haven't knocked my socks off, but all are interesting and well worth trying.","LiquidAmber","Jan 12, 2013"

4.65,32.9,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"22 oz bottle poured into a Samuel Adams Winter Lager glass. Took a whiff, found the fragrance but not the skunkiness of Mickey's. Slammed down a decent swig, like you oughta with malt liquor, and had a good experience all the way. There isn't hardly any head, and the brew is a respectable clear amber. No harshness like the corner brews like Olde English or Steel Reserve. It's too bad this is a limited release. It's great stuff, and just what you need for watching your favorite football team or monster movie.","sabinelr","Nov 08, 2012"
3.66,4.6,4,3,4,4,3.5,"The malt body adds sweet grain and a drop of honey. Very quaffable. Enjoyable offering that is both true to the style and not a mere stab at ironic self-deprecation, nor intended for those who might use it as a tool for such shenanigans.","beerpadawan","Nov 04, 2012"

3.5,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste has got to be the most quaffable malt liquor I have ever had. Nice little grain and alcohol, very little hops. What this has that most of the common MLs dont have is a nice caramel malt presence and a fine carbonation. As a beer in general, it is just ok, but as a malt liquor it is quite good. Coming from a craft brewery though, it just seems wrong in principle, so I cant morally give this beer perfect marks...sorry, I just cant. I might buy it again, depending on if I feel like having a reasonably priced high ABV bomber.","twiggamortis420","Nov 03, 2012"

3.68,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a becker a deep golden with a large one finger white head that faded pretty quickly leaving a few small chunks of lace behind.Aromas were light with a touch of sweet booze and toast malt,a little corn came into play as the beer warmed.The flavors were not nearly as potent and boozy as I thought they would be,grainy and lithly toasted with just a light zing of sweet alcohol,the corn/adjunct flavors were pretty well hidden.This is a standard for American malt liquor wich might not being saying a whole lot, but this was pretty damn good and easy going down for how big it is.","oberon","Oct 22, 2012"

This pours a golden color with a mid sized off white head. The smells are of a sweet malty aroma, not full of the corn adjuncts which normally turn me off to malt liquor. The feel is medium, decent carbonation. The taste is pretty good better than the cheap stuff. You get a sugary load of malts but grain which is nice.","DavidST","Oct 19, 2012"

4.3,22.9,5,5,4,4,4,"On the other hand, it's a good beer. It's a good craft lager. The hops in it are not excessive for a lager and about as complex as a lager ever needs to be without going over the top. It's an excellent alcohol percentage for any beer in my opinion. It's just an all-around good lager. Not really what I would want to drink when I'm in the mood for the malt liquor style, though.
