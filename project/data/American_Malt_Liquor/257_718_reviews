"O: a lot better than I though.  This brew gets a bad rep in my opinion"
"I just saw this in the store today, came home read reviews here, wnet back and bought a 12 pack, it's the 6%abv version(I was hoping for 8%)  I gave it a 4 on looks simple because I like darker colored beers. A 4 on smell because it didn't smell like corn to me. It gets a 5 for taste I really like the taste, my first impression was a fruity flavor, then it went to a malty taste, I did not find it bitter at all but thats because I drink Irish beer regularly, it did not remind me of malt liquor at all. I gave it a 2 for feel it was very watery to me, over all I rate it a 4 because of the color. The lady at the package store told me that stuff is evil! lmao! Will I buy this again yes I will, It taste very good with a bowl of chili, they paired up wonderfully! I have a strong feeling this should be used in moderation, I have a hunch a night of hitting this heavey will kick yer ass the next day, just saying!"
"If you don't like bitter beers, or prefer pale brews, this won't change your mind.  If you already like better ales, give it a shot."
"Overall:  People who seek malt liquor should try Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity)."
"Keep in mind that my rating of this beer is relative. Obviously Steel Reserve can't be compared to a top-of-the-line IPA. That being said, for malt liquor, Steel Reserve is one of my favorites. Granted I only drink it when the bank account has more dust in it than dollars, but I must admit that it does have qualities that I enjoy. For starters, it has a nice light amber color, and bubbles like a champagne. The taste is fairly clean and crisp for a malt, and the aftertaste is not bad at all. This one will give you a nasty hangover, though, if you drink too much of it. Enjoyed best while still ice cold."
""
"Well, this is the beer to get if you like your malt liquor potent, and who wouldn't? It really is drinkable though, and doesn't get all flat and skunky faster than you can drink it like other malt liquors in 40 oz. form. I don't know. In a pinch, I would take this over some really crappy so-called craft beers, put it that way, but it's malt liquor and you know what the score is."
""
"It's an Apples and Oranges test if you compare Steel Reserve to highly delicate crafted micro brews. In fact it's insulting to make the comparison in the first place. However having said that, and after taking another glorious gulp of my 24 oz Steel Reserve, it's a great beer if you just rate itself and forget all the other legends. For starters it's a acquired taste of strong and bold rich barely, sweet and bitter all at the same time. The After taste is also need of acquiring. Luckily I have acquired all of the above. Price point is unbeatable, for $1.50 not too shabby (You won't go bankrupt with this financial decision). The high alcohol content of 8.1% is mind blowing (You won't get that same effect with say coors light or bud). I've coined the nickname ""A Quick Cheap Drunk"" :p . Best way to drink this like almost all good beers, ""ICE COLD."" . ""It's a Mans Beer," my girlfriend doesn't understand why I love it so much (even though she likes drinking some of the worst hard alcohol on the planet). BACK STORY  It's the beer I have grown up with, when I was once a poor country boy. I continue to drink in delight :) (You heard me right), I steel love it after all the other hand crafted beers I have been opened up to throughout the years. It's beer and it get's me in gear so have no fear. I shout out, ""I love steel reserve beer."" with an all out cheer :D"
"Overall: first time ever having a malt liquor, I was pleasantly surprised. Not something I would buy regularly, but nothing offensive either."
"Steel reserve 211 high gravity... Who hasn't had it..."

"O: Surprisingly good. Not great by any means, but is good for what it is. It tastes like a budweiser with more flavor and body."
"After having one I decided to see what everyone thought. After seeing all the bad comments , I decided I better crack open another one to study it more carefully. An igot a new buzz, his name is percy he's a happy lil buzz.  So, I got alot of head from the first one, as I poured this one from the wide mouth can into my glass, no head this time. I'm surprised that my yellow beer in my blue glass doesn't  look green that defys science so its got that going for it. I don't smell much of anything to write about when I take a whiff. Goes down pretty smooth, with a tad bit of beer flavor. I really like the 8.10% effect, I wish they could all be 8% and up for so cheap. Oh whoops, I spoilled the best part its really cheap,  $1.29 for 16oz. One will do it,  two will make it hard to write a review with no spelling errors. So will I get it again? Oh yeah, sometimes its fun to ride a moped. We just don't want anyone to see us. This is what people who dont drink beer think all beer tastes like. It also reminds me why i like warstiener, bocks, and dopple bocks. I have to go  scratch my belly and yell at my cat now.  An I got this brand new buzz, his name is 4 and he don't ever do bout nothing at really ever at all my π ™¶ be sure blue steel 211zzzzzzzzzzz."

"awful beer, cheap taste cheap price"

"This is the best inexpensive beer on the market...with a kick to boot! BTW. This stuff is a lager. Can't find the words ""Malt Liquor"" on the can anywhere."
"Actually, after a second sip from the can, with little smell, I find the taste a bit unpleasant. However, for it's kick of alcohol, it hides it reasonably well, though it's still noticeable.  Probably haven't had a beer that tasted worse than this, but that's probably more due to my good judgement, which has been put to the test tonight."
"Overall : won't buy it again. But if you really want to say goodbye to sobriety for a night, this will do the trick without tasting like a dirty diaper."
"Overall poor flavor and body"
"When I used to drink malt liquors I thought this was the worst of them all. Big malt, nasty, foul flavors on this beer. It was the lowest of the low and I would never touch it again as there are better malt liquor beers out there than this."
""
"Awful swill, tastes like dirty hair spray and old beer. Its pretty foamy so i guess that could be considered a plus.Provides a dirty almost sickly liquor like buzz."

"It's time to party like you're late to your parole hearing. If I'm ever in the mood to go all-out raging drunk, I'll pound two Steely's and then argue with my mother about who's going to do the laundry. There's a reason the gutters of Chicago have rich deposits of empty Steel Reserve cans--the Windy City knows how  to party."

"People review this like it is supposed to be some kind of craft brew. No it isn't. This company makes tons of money. If they wanted to spend that whipping up something that is crafty and used great ingredients they could do it... I promise you they could. But they are marketing this somewhere else. It is an inexpensive and relatively easy drinking and good tasting way to get a lot of alcohol in your system. That's it. Stop reviewing beers like this the way you guys do. That would be like me going into a mcdonalds and reviewing their big mac as if it was a dish served to me in a five star restaurant that I paid 50 dollars for. No. It's just maid to be cheap and taste pretty good."

"When it comes to malt liquor I grade on taste alone, because malt liquor is meant to be SLAMED. “Slow brewed for exceptional smooth flavor”. You can always tell how good a malt liquor is by the amount of lies on the can. All right here we go. What the hell man? I just opened the can and I didn’t get the snake hiss I’m so accustomed to. Damn I can smell the alcohol running from the can like the devil is chasing it. Ok, sucked down ¼ of the can and it taste like a green apple jolly rancher. I’ve literally had 100’s of 211’s and this is the first time it didn’t taste like malt liquor, sweet gasoline ,and heat. I must have a bad can. Which raises the question, do bad cans of 211 get better with age? Alright round 2, here we go…. Ughhhh never mind I take it all back. I just killed the can and it’s fighting me back causing ripples of chills throughout my body. This is the taste I’m accustoming to…. Alcohol and a funk that shifts its flavor so fast you don’t know what the hell you’re drinking. This is definitely an acquired taste. The reason why I like 211 is because it floods my mind with memories of Jr High. It’s like time traveling back to the time when all we could afford was 40oz’s and tall cans. Overall it taste awful. But the memories I’ve had with this shit keeps me coming back. I mean come-on this was my first taste of independence. 211 delivers a hard ass buzz for only 8.1% ABV"

"Wow!  I read what the Bro's rated and was surprised that so cheap a beer would be rated that high.  Finally got the nerve to put out 3$ for a 4 pack in aluminum cans..  I was a little embarased feeling like a brown bagger homeless guy....   Poured it in a glass when I got home and everything looked perfect.  Nice foam nice lacing..... Nice smell.. Taste??  OMG this is nice....smoothe with no hint of being out of a can!!  I can't believe it!  Only rated a 4.5 because  this lager (not malt liquor) needs just a tad more hop to be as 5.   Bye Bye yuengaling.... This is my new normal drinker!!!  Might even consider living on the streets to enjoy ..... Nah..."

"It's great if you just want to get drunk cheaply, but this is the most disgusting tasting beer I've ever had in my life."
""
"Look. i spend enough $ on expensive, great beer. This is not a bad choice when I just want to spend a little on a good beer. And that's  what this is, good. $1.35 for cold 16 oz can, can't beat that. Crisp and refreshing on the palate, smooth and satisfying aroma and taste. Lager like, hints of apple and pear. If I had to rank my malt liquors I'd go Olde English, this, Colt 45 High Gravity. There's not a damn thing wrong with any of the 3, the first 2 are more drinkable than the 45. Pour this in my 5.5 oz fancy snifter, almost looks like an expensive beer."

"Serious beer for serious bros. If you want to bro down and impress that babes that know how to party, drink the high gravity lager. 2 tall boys and you will be flying high. This isn't a craft. This isn't a trendy beer. This is a malt for college kids getting after it. And you rate how crazy you want your night to be, by the number of steels you put down. Every now and then I get a few to reminisce."

"I can not even review this nasty beer..it was great in high school seeing as it was only $1.10... I can't even stand the smell of this anymore..used to drink it like water..it tastes like metal to me, funny because its ""steel reserve"". My opinions to you are, if your really low on money ""and I meen LOW"" go ahead.. DO NOT DRINK THIS OR YOUR GUNNA PROLLY END UP OVER THE TOILILET OR IN FIGHT WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND."

"probably drank this beer more than anything in high school crack that bottle and all u smell is that notorious swell malt corny odor bubbles up like a bitch when you swig it you do get past the taste, though after drinking it for a while this is the cheapest beer per alc content besides fourloko and those are garbage so if your low on cash and that cheap hooker needs a buzz theres always a cold one with your name on it at the corner store :)"

"as a person who can drink a fifth of whiskey in a sitting...this beer is a nice light change...and at 8 50 for a 12 pack at cumberlnd farms ...y complain...by no means a bragger but it way better than those that come in a ridiculous 40oz that gets warm half through"

"O- This is the perfect beer to bring to your next beer pong tournament hands down. You get the high alcohol content that is awesome, and absolutely no annoying flavor to contend with. You can get f'd up and not have to break the bank in doing so. So game on man, lets do this! In other words, gross."
""
""
""
""
"O: I picked up some aromas of fusel alcohol in the smell, but these are completely masked if you drink the beer straight out of the ""steel"" can, and then the only thing that is somewhat detracting are the flavors of fusel alcohol that linger into the finish. The adjunct malts didn't seem to overpower the taste, but I wasn't keen on the fusel alcohol in the taste."
""
"I'm on a bit of a malt liquor kick- this one is actually pretty darn good. I think there really is quite a bit of malt here. The taste does not become repugnant as it warms- in fact a bit of complexity is on display. Overall, it is what it is and it ain't half bad."
""
""
"Eh, too obvious. Not enough good stuff. I'm more partial to watery, flavor-lite ease."
""
""
""

""
""

""
"O: I'd rather drink this over the typical BMC stalwarts (sans Miller High Life, maybe). It certainly isn't a good beer, BUUUT it's great for getting drunk on the cheap. I don't hate this one, that's for sure."
"If you wanna get drunk for cheap, this is the best beer you can buy. Pretty good taste and really kicks your ass. I get the 40 oz bottles and drink two and I'm feeling great. It's definitely a get drunk beer not one to really relax and enjoy or if you're thirsty."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer does the job for the effects at the right price. Not really a bad taste at all compared to other beers I've had. I drink it all the time. Fills you up, that's for sure. And I would recommend that more bars, and restaurants serve steel reserve because it's hard to find them in these places."

"Best thing to ever grace my taste buds. First one and I was hooked. I twisted off the golden cap and was immediately bombarded with an aromatic burst of floral, citrusy, earthy hop-o-rama. This little golden honey delighted my teeth, tongue, gums, and gullet. It is also a wicked good aphrodisiac. My homebum partner was more than willing to relinquish his cardboard shelter for a single sip of this malty delicacy. Yes! This is truly the nectar of the gods!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, while it's not one of my favorites, I'll drink it again, simply because it's good when you're broke and want to drink with a couple of friends."
"Need i say anymore its a Miller brewing company malt liquor whoops high gravity... To me its a damn good cheap brew to buy and it will get you where you want to go! It has a good taste, not alot of alcohol punch, which equals you to getting it trouble. Plus it is a $1.50 a 24 ounce can. I cant bitch at this stuff they are producing, to me its better than hurricane hg at 8.10 percent"

"Great site, been here a bunch but it took drinkin a Steel Reserve prompted me to sign up. This stuff is pure garbage!!! I am on my third one ever and only because my neighbor left one here and I'm out of Natty Light. He lost his liscense cause of DUI, go figure!, and has me give him a ride to the Quicky-Mart from time to time so he can get his ""fix"". As I said I normally drink the Natty due to price. In a perfect world I'd only drink quality brews like Dos Equis, Corona, Sweetwater 420, Abita or any other quality brew, but it's not a perfect world and I'm drinkin this crap. The only way I can even drink it is to place the rather attractive, stylish can in my right hand and hold my nose with my left thumb and forefinger. Then I pour it in the back of my throat and swallow as quickly as possible. Urgh! Thank god I only had one to drink is all I can say! Don't believe me? Try one. Sure it's strong and will get u drunk, but so is Sterno. Urgh! Yuck!"

"Cheap beer for a good buzz... LOVE IT!!! Warning!!! Two of these and you are DOWN FOR THE COUNT...just saying... I LOVE BEER...what can I say...It gets expensive....Great alternative for getting a good beer buzz on. I DONT like hard liquor. Can be bought at any connivence store."

"Not something I would want to drink regularly. However, it is decent and very cheap so it could be worse. It doesn't smell very good and the color is very yellow for a beer. Not overly carbonated. Taste was better than expected after previous experiences with ""high gravity lagers."""
"I drink 2 40's after work each day of Steel Reserve 211 because it's cheap and gets you buzzed or drunk depending on the consumption speed. It does leave me groggy every morning and upsets my stomach the next day for the first part of the day. In terms of 40's I choose it over all others due to better taste. Given the money I would suggest regular beers over Steel Reserve, but if you want cheap and decent then Steel Reserve is the way to go."
"Spotted this 24oz monstrosity at the local Mobil Mart. Previously unfamiliar with this beer, and I kinda wish I still was. Not a good beer by any stretch. Very sweet and cough syrupy. High ABV is giving me a little buzz, but is it worth it? I have a bottle of Hop Stoopid in the fridge, but thought I'd try this bad boy first; saving the Lagunitas for the start of the Sox/ Cards third Series game. I'm debating a drain pour..."
""
""
"This is the 6% version and I use it to clean the palate between tastings. It's fairly bland with no overpowering flavors , but the slight maltiness is discernible coupled with a slight bitterness. At 50 cents a can it's a good quaffing beer - nothing really wrong with it, nor great either. Light / medium mouthfeel with a somewhat crisp finish that lacks hop flavor."
"Hope that sums up this retarded excuse for a beer. It might as well be fortified wine"
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy enough to drink and with a decent enough mouthfeel - the flavors are not bad and it is a decent representation of the style (which is not known for complex flavors or subtlety. If I was picking out malt liquors, I would definitely consider grabbing this one again."
""
""
""
"I gave an outstanding rating for the buzz it gives me, the can looks cool the smell isn't, the taste is tolerable, I don't really know what mouthfeel is but it doesn't make me gag so I gave it an ""okay"" rating."
"Bad, insipid brew only made to deliver a 8.1 abv kick. Not that there's anything wrong with that but this stuff is marginally drinkable. Label claims that it has ""twice the ingredients"" of a regular beer... what, twice the high fructose corn syrup? Worst of all gave a wierd buzz, letting you suck it down without feeling it, then hitting you like a pack of mad Chinese hornets in mating season. Never again!"

"Well.If you are Looking to get Shit Faced and get that way Cheap,then ""Steel Reserve 211"" can foot the Bill 4sure,and is pretty much just what this crap is made for..it has to be,Because I can not Imagine anyone drinking this swill for the Taste and flavor,which IMHO is Horrid & Disgusting,It Taste like a very cheap beer that has been sitting out for a few days in a toxic waste dump,and has gone flat,absorbed some various toxic chemicals,then was mixed along with some sugar in a rusty Bucket..yes,it is that bad boys and girls..Bleckkkk!"

"This beer isnt too terrible considering how it's made. It's pretty dark for a ""party"" beer. There is a very light yet slightly skunky smell to it. It doesn't go down very smoothly but it is not a terrible beer. Against it's competition it soars above the rest lol"
""
""

""

"These things are awesome honestly you can get really drunk of these in a 4 pack, honestly the average drinker would want to sit there ass down after 2 of them honestly. For only 2.59 a 4 pack at 8.1% alcohol by volume that's a fantastic deal. true there not the best tasting beer in the world. However, if it's taste your concern about getcha some lime salts for your beer and that'll help you out. Still if you are like me and wanna get get drunk with as little money as possible, and don't mind having a little bad taste m your mouth....this is the way to go."

"I sampled a 24 ounce can since that was all that was available. I noticed the website lists different ABV, however the one I sampled had 6% ABV. The product had a Sept 2013 date stamp so I am assuming that was the sell by date. The taste was neither good or bad. It was OK. I would drink it again but with many better products out there I would not go out of my way. It is an OK beer at an OK price. Try it for yourself but do not expect a full flavored rich beer. I wonder if the other ABV's have a different taste. Should Imcome across it I will review this further."
"this is on the edge of not being drinkable. a friend brought this over a few months ago and joked, what do you get the guy who has tried everything? well, he brought a steel reserve, and its been taking up space on the bottom shelf of the fridge ever since. last night it came out. piss yellow in color, with soda carbonation not amounting to much head at all. it smells like the can, but also that extract based density of rot gut that is sure to come. the flavor agrees, but for just a second on the front end its palatable, light, and refreshing, almost like a natural light or some other low budget beer that's just ahead of the pack. its short lived though, as the alcohol comes out, the weight sets in, and the can starts to warm up. after a few swigs, its downright repulsive, turning the stomach and taunting a hangover already. there is little or no room for this in the beer world, and thank goodness its not taking up room in my fridge any longer. yuck."

"My absolute favorite train ride 40. Does its job at 1/4 the price of the macro brew crap out there. Definately adjunct heavy, can easily taste the corn. Sweeter than most, but this is smooth for a cheap malt liquor and has a nice flavor and does not get overty nasty as it warms. Give it a try."

It gets you drunk, and I think it tastes pretty good! and I think this great beer deserves a 5 star!! People who are giving this beer low ratings are probably the people who think bud light is the best beer or something. Anyway I wish you could buy this beer in a 24 pack! Not so I could drink it all in one night, but just so I could have some Steel Reserve in fridge for days!"
""
"O-well I doubt any of y'all are gonna pick this up with high hopes. You don't buy this for flavor or drinkability. You buy this to get as drunk as possible while paying less. Eh it could be worse, it's on the same level as BMC beers"
"Mouthfeel It was average, the body medium and the carbonation good. Best when damn near frozen, . If you gotta go Malt, it's a cheap, classic choice. This beer is best of the American Malt Liquor!"
"I actually enjoy this beverage infrequently and will pick up a case every few months. It's great after youve been doing some yardwork or other household project and you want to relax a moment. Among the malts I find it to be the best, though thats not to say there arent other malts I dont enjoy as well. It goes down easily and its very smooth...of course its also the 6% version so that may have something to do with it but still enough to achieve a decent buzz. Best of all its very affordable and available almost everywhere."

"If you are the type of person that wants a quick buzz at a low price, this is your beer. I bought both , the bottled and canned versions. It really didn't make any difference. It has a very skunky smell to it, and the taste is simply bad. I must say however, that the 8.1% abv masks the taste pretty well. Sometimes the only thing you can taste is the ethanol in it. The can version of 24 oz was $1.99 and the 40oz bottle $2.99, it's a very inexpensive beer. Though the old saying ""you get what you paid for"" certainly applies here. All in all, is a bad tasting, bad smelling beer with a very high alcohol content. score:2"

"Overall a good go to beer for me for those cheap times. I really like malt liquor beers so I'm kinda biased. That said, I do this for all beers I review. I respect all the styles. This one is a wonderful malt liquor with wonderful clarity and lots of maltiness"
"This is surprisingly good. A very full bodied, slightly starchy taste, but never overly sweet. Very little aftertaste, even when warm. I see no resemblance whatsoever to malt liquor. Really the only downside is the 8% ABV. I only wish they made a version with a little less alcohol and a lot more malt, I'd drink this stuff all the time."

"I'm curious what process is used to give this beer such a uniquely poor flavor and appearance. I've googled the company, but can't seem to find any information which pins down the difference."
""
"pours a yellow transparent color with a white head with average retention. much more sweetness in the nose than other malt liquors to the higher. Heavier body than some malt other malt liquors, also due to abv. Definitely a brew with a goal of abv than flavor like all malt liqours."

"O - This is the worst beer that I have ever had, Hands down. I would never drink this slop again. EVER."
"For a high gravity lager it's one of the better ones."
""
"O: Top notch as far as malt liquors go. I've had the 8.1% as well and the 6% is the way to go. It's much easier to enjoy than the higher alcohol version."
"Could not finish --> drainpour. The only thing remotely beer-like about this is its appearance, which reminds one of a very pale American adjunct lager. Pungent, metallic taste. I realize that malt liquor shouldn't merit high expectations, but I'm not exaggerating when I say that you'd really, really, REALLY have to want to get drunk to drink this beer."
"A+ if you are looking to get drunk at a cheap price (where I am at, a 24 ounce can is $1 OTD). With that being said, this beer has an awful taste, and is strong. Drink at your own risk! It's just as bad as Natty Daddy, Ice House Edge, and other ice beers, but has the highest alcohol content of the bunch."
""
"It is what it is. You can't expect anything more. This is an easy to choke down, er I mean Drink Malt Liquor. Let's face it. it's 8.1 its got a chemical taste, youve got to drink it cold but if you can cope with it 1 can will get ya good and buzzed quick. at $1.19 it's my go to Malt."

"Im reating this beer souly on value for drunk. I mean, 3 bucks a pop and one of them gets you buzzed, 2 your stumbling, 3 your doing something your going to regret. The bottle doesn't lie, it really does turn the gravity up. I drank this brew from a 40oz bottle and a 3 foot funnel, no need for a glass. The taste is slightly sweet malt with a smooth after taste of hard liqour. Mouthfeel, creamy and thick. If this brew was fizzier it would be leagues better. Overall, this beer is the best beer if your as broke as a crackhead and need a cheap buzz to wash away your sorrows. It definenitely a mans drink and you can't beat this brew if your poor and just want to get drunk."

"O-Not bad at all, expecially for its price, i paid $1.50 for a 24. It does what its meant to do, it gives a cheap buzz."
"i sometimes drink a 24 oz can of this when i dont have much money. Its okay. Tastes like fishing sinkers and as if stale bourbon was added.Smells similar to the taste but add to the smell a musty burnt corn smell. The look of the beer as well as the mouthfeel and carbonation is good. For the price it is the way to go sometimes, some occasions call for steel reserve"

"I wasn't expecting much out of this beer, and it pretty much met my expectations. If it was slightly less harsh, it would have been one of the better examples of the style. If you're looking for a cheap buzz, I suppose one could do worse than this."

"I can get a pretty good buzz on 1 can. I drink it in about 10 minutes, ""normal for me"" and thats about as cheap a buzz you can find in these parts."

""
"O - This is what bud light platinum was trying to do, but failed at. If your looking for a cheap, and when I say cheep... the cheapest thing on the market, and drinkable beer you found it. This beer is not claiming to be anything great, and for 6.99 a 12 pack, it actually has flavor. The 4.5 rating is given based upon the price you pay for the taste. My favorite style of beer is american double/imperial stouts and I can drink this one with ease w/o complaining. Great beer for float trips/camping/grilling with the guys."
"Overall - Don't buy this beer unless you can handle the strong flavor of alcohol."

"Actually not all that bad when compared to other malt liquors offered in my area."

"Overall – For the price I paid for this brew ($1.50 for 24 oz.an) it gives you a great bargain. While by no means the tastiest beer out there, it wasn’t awful and did give a very nice warming feel. On of the best stronger malt liquors out there."

"Caveat: DO NOT line this up against Stone Ruination, or even Coors Banquet, Bud, or Miller High Life for that matter, this is an entirely different category of beer. I really tried to review according to style. That said, this is pretty close to top of the category, but bottom of my list."
""
""
""
"This is a drinkable beer. The can I had said 6.0%. It's not very flavorful and honestly rather forgettable, but for the style it's not awful."

"For less than a couple bucks almost anywhere, it's hard to pass up a tallboy of Steel Reserve. The taste is fairly strong, though if you're accustomed to drinking high gravity lager a lot it won't seem as intense as a lot of other malt liquors. Because it's so inexpensive it makes a popular choice for anyone looking for a quick buzz. 75% of the time I head up to the local grocery store I'm often finding myself reaching way back for the last one. It doesn't taste horrible and it's very economical. It's easy to get used to without dreading the strong aftertaste from other beers in its category."

"Have only had this once out of a forty ounce and hated it. Will attempt it now again hopefully it is better from a 24oz can. Poured into big mug with round bowl bottom. Pours a color of ginger ale, pleasing appearance of the rising bubbles, creamy white head that does not last. Smell isn't too pleasing, sweet malt presence and metal. Taste also has a certain sweetness to it. Pretty rough feel. It is pretty decent for a cheap beer though, and the high abv isn't a bad thing."
"2.5 D: This isn't a good beer, but it's a hell of a lot better than I remembered it being. Perhaps it's no longer mentally associated with me drinking way too much of this in highschool and puking all over Pittsburgh. In any case, I thought this review would allow me to do some of my best bitching, but really this is just a top end beer from a really vile style."

"O - If you want a good beer, this ain't it. But it is an incredible value. If you like malt liquor, you'll probably agree that Mickey's is far superior, *but* Steel Reserve is cheap as hell, and at 8.1% ABV, it'll get you where you want to be."

"There brewers are right, twice as many ingredents as other lagers as it says on the bottle "" as other adjunt filled lagers that is"" well you sure taste can taste them in there, has many undesirable flavors, too many too painful too discribe. head dispates too quick, one word avoid this brand at all costs, lifes too short.!!! michael jackson the beer hunter is turning his grave!!! in all fairness this beer is best severed in a paperbag at bus stop, served at very cold tempeture ""32 degrees""is highly recomeded.don't forget your dark shades and ball cap to remain anonymous."
"Straw gold lager--malt liquor of 8.5%. So many meaningless brewing misnomers on the label to convince the quick buzz crowd that this is the alcohol vehicle of choice. White bubbly head hangs tough in my plastic hotel room glass--desperate drinking conditions (11 pm in small town Iowa, so this was the best beer at the local Casey's) call for desperate measures. Best thing about the beer is the triple overtime win by Stanford on TV while drinking. Corn, sweet malt and diluted sugar in the nose witha slight tangy and metallic (hop?) spice in the nose. In the taste, more corn and apple and some bitterness (happily). When the alcohol kick in, my slight shudder from the taste subsides and it becomes even (somewhat) enjoyable. Ratings above might seem high, but it is one of the better malt liquors I've tasted from a limited range."
"(D)- Not a fan at all. Its like drinking sugar boozed water."
"(O) College! This brew brought me back. As far as flavor profile and the quality of the brew, not all that fantastic by any means. It's pretty bad. It is one to be had though, just so you can have that notch on your belt. It is a great kick-start to any party drinking that you might do, but seeing that we've all moved on into the flavor country (not to mention are mostly older and no longer in school) the purpose that this beer has served has come and gone."
"My suggestion: if you want a cheap quick fog and terrible hangover with gutter breath, perhaps this is for you. If you care at all for your taste buds, skip it!!!!"
"O: Only good thing about this one is that it's 8.1% alcohol and it's cheap. You pay for the good things, however, with the god-awful taste. I'm not even comparing this to Sofie, but to other malt liquors. This stuff is just plain bad. I used to like it, but the taste has gotten worse and worse."
"Straw/golden color with a lot of bubbles and a quickly fading head. Smell is of corn and grass. Taste is the same but with a slight metallic taste, not my cup of tea. Mouthfeel is light with lots of carbonation. This is a beer for getting drunk, not for enjoying."
"overall a great way to get hammered for dirt cheap!"
"O: Crisply refreshing. Not a great beer by any means, but not terrible either. Would reserve this for hot summer days by the pool. I do not think I will seek it out again, but would not thumb my nose at it if offered."
"Now that I have grown up and realized what good beer is, this beer just doesnt do it for me anymore. The appearance is basic and boring, the smell is like your basic junk beer, nothing reall there. The taste is actually better than BMC IMO, so I gave it a 3. The beer made me very burppy and was just unpleasant. Overall this is just one of those beers you drink at a party when you only have 5 dollars in your pocket."
"All in all this beer is definitely a good bargain, and considering its claim to fame being its high gravity and ABV it tastes not half bad as well."
"O: The price for this is exceptional too, at $6.99 a 12-pack, $1.99 for a large 22oz bomber, etc. Beware the high ABV, this beer will definitely knock you on your butt if you drink too much!!"
"I plan on never drinking this again."
"Pours a caramel color with a very thick head that thins to a lace. Smells heavy of adjuncts with a hint of something peculiar. Goes down surprising smooth with notes of fusel alcohols and leaves a little bitterness in the back of the mouth. Overall this is a very drinkable beer considering the style and ABV. Only downside to this beer is the putrid adjunct smell."
"So I fancy myself an above average drinker, in both quantity and quality...never before have I faced such an ominious brew starting from the pour, I had the fear...2009 Can - you can sense the gravity even just pouring it, which is a thick golden with a sizeable white head...aroma is sweet and a bit hot...flavour is not horribly offensive, mostly corn, adjuncts and heat, but again, you can tell bad shit is lurking around the corner if you keep drinking...I mean, like falling off the parking garage that you decided to scale from the outside at 3AM because your so called friend dared you and is now calling you a pussy - bad shit...maybe when I become a full-blown alcoholic and get tired of MD20, I’ll hit this up again, but I’m done for now...my fault is not with the beer, but with what it might make me do...ERIC SMASH"
"As a malt liquor, there are few better examples."
"O- Terrible hot garbage was created when the powers that be came up with this one! Now I really don't want the hobo lifestyle if this is what I have to look forward to...not that I wanted it before. Even my wife groaned when she asked if we were done with the bottle after pouring her and I a glass each. I'd rather take my chances on getting hammered drinking Bud Select 55 all night. I'd still drink this over Bavaria 8.6 Red...I feel bad for this company....reading the inside of their label, they really think they've brewed a quality product..."
"As a last resort and for the price, it's not a bad beverage. Sure it's some convenience store special, but to be honest, it's not much worse than DFH Midas Touch."
"This beer is foamy but that goes away fast. The body is a pale gold color. It has a thin mouthfeel. The aroma does smell like corn right off the bat. It smells like pure adjunct but you can’t be mad that is the name of the game in this style of “beer”. There is some bitterness but it is more alcohol like bitterness not hops. The feel has a burn to it both from the carbonation and the alcohol. There is like petrol like aftertaste. What do you expect for the price. It is not bad if you just want to get messed up."
"D - Overall surprisingly good. Good for the price of course, but also good for this style and not bad all-around."
"OK, so I've been away from ""Bad Beer Thursdays"" for a few months but I have to say....I'm glad I didn't get the 40 ounce, instead I opted for the 22 FL oz. Beer is super sweet up front, corny and dry on the finish, almost nothing in between, there is an almost plastic like flavor, artificial, fake, in the middle that carries the beer through. Completely uninteresting. I suppose drinkable if I wanted to get crunked, but otherwise a total avoid."
"Overall, I am glad I tried this. Hell, it's the only beer I had of the night, and I got a decent buzz. I just don't wanna have to down another one anytime soon. This is a beer that I would recommend to very few people, though I think any fan of beer should try it."
"If I had to define a place by this beer, it would be: Stockton."
"O- I'm shocked; I was expecting complete nastiness and a drain pour. It's really not bad. I'd take it over many of the six packs and bombers I've bought over the years.The clerk probably was wondering what was wrong with me...Founders porter, La Fin Du Monde, Dreadnaught, and Steel Reserve."
"But is is smooth."
"Lingering pale malt sweetness and a bit of bittering around the edges. Thicker in body and fairly smooth and pretty easy to drink, with a decent alcohol kick, but overall not as bad as I was expecting. For what it's worth, this product does exactly what it is intended to do."
"You could do a lot worse, but this is not something I would ever try again. I also can't believe it only cost me 3 bucks for two of these ginormous cans, I can't even remember the last time I paid that LITTLE for beer. If you put a bullet to my head and said drink this if you want to live (and that's assuming I want to live) then sure I could do it, lord knows I have had much better, but I know I've had worse."
"Overall, a beer that I could most likely drink again. However with such a plethora of better choices available in the market, I can't imagine that I will."
"Overall - good abv, but for what you get from that there's almost no taste. Nothing interesting about the beer."
"Very smooth as claimed, and hides the alcohol very well. Surprisingly flavourful compared to macro lagers, though single-minded. Becomes sickeningly sweet as it warms. Can only be drank ice cold. One of the better malt liquors I've had. For the price I can't complain."
"The taste is very distinctive. I don't think this could ever be mistaken for any other malt liquor I've had. The first thing that hits is a strong sweet flavour of expired fruit. That is followed by a chemically alcohol and fusel alcohol flavour and the aftertaste is that of cheap bread. I wish the initial flavour was more akin to the aftertaste. This has a highly chemical taste. It just tastes unnatural, like it wasn't even brewed, but made by some freaky science designed to kill hobos. I'm a fan of the bite in this beer, but I'm too scared of it to buy it again. I feel like it might dissolve my body from the inside. We'll see."
"Bought at a gas station and drank out of the can which is the way this brew is meant to be enjoyed IMO. It was what you'd expect a malt liquor to look (like a can) and smell like (corn adjuncts and alcohol) except that it is exceptionally smooth with almost no aftertaste. Cheers to Steel Brewing for somehow figuring out how to do this with such a non-premium beer. I have had this many times in the past and will continue to have it when only having pocket change and wanting a beer. For what it is, it does it very well."
"Taste is like corn broth from a can, cooked. Pretty sweet. No hops, almost no malt bill. One of the grossest bitter aftertastes ever, full of fusel alcohol. Seems like a boilermaker was made with this and some vodka in a plastic bottle. Lots of carbonation, how did this not make a head? The carbonation keeps the shit taste from riding even longer in your mouth. Cheap price, not much else going on for this 'beer'. Ugh."
"Overall, this is a Malt Liquor of the highest order. Its 8.1% alcohol is formidable in 16 and 24 ounce cans. While it may not be totally respectable in all social occasions, it has a place and time. Considering the price... as long as no one is looking, give it a try really cold."
"Overall 1.0 Catchy big 24 oz can in an iced down cooler looks pretty cool, but this is most definatly the worst beer I haver ever drank...."
"Overall: It's strange coming back to this one. So many of these downed by friends and I back in the day. We never stopped to think about what we were actually drinking, just trying to get drunk. I can see why we didn't stop to think about it now. This one is made to chug, made to make you fall over as soon as possible."
"It is still, however, very, very bad. Swallowing fast is quite key. Here is betting that my throat and stomach will be charging me with abuse in the morning."
"Overall, I would say this beer is a success for what I was trying to accomplish, get drunk. I would not want to have this with a meal, as a refreshing drink, or in polite company (its not classy at all). For the purpose of a drink to start a long night of fun, it did the job. They keep calling four loko ""blackout in a can"" but drink enough of Steel Reserve and it puts that claim to shame. I've learned my lesson."
"I can only drink half of this. Awful taste due to the overpowering of booze. Alcohol warmth can be felt going down as if you had a shot of Vodka. I will never have this again."
"O - If you're looking for a cheap beer to get you drunk, then this is IT. Not much else to say. Dont expect quality here. But, it is what it is."
"Pours a nice yellow color, nice carbonation, little fizzy white head, with minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is kinda sweet, ricy/corny. The taste is sweet, kinda malty, ricy. Medium body, with a slight bitter finish. Not Drinkable, not bad, but still...."
"Its been a while since I had one of these, but the nostalgia factor is certainly there. Certainly not my favorite drink by any means, but it has served its purpose in the past. First thing that stands out is the lack of carbonation. This quality really allows the drinker to down cans at top speed. This helps since the taste of the beer is excessively sweet and not something you'd want to take your time to enjoy. That being said, the moderate presence of hops in the flavor keep it from becoming sickly sweet. The drinkability of this beer is actually fairly decent for a malt liquor owing to its smoothness going down. The presence of alcohol is fairly strong in both smell and taste, but for a beer of it's type, Its fair to say drinkers of malt liquor wont be complaining at this aspect. The price is also very inexpensive and combined with high gravity, the only decent points of the drink."
"Conclusions: I would actually be willing to try this one again, it wasn't horrible and maybe one that was properly stored wouldn't have that off-putting cloud of skunk that escaped as soon as I opened the can. There's not much in the way of flavor, but I'd say that about 90% of the beers you can find in a convenience store. It's drinkable for a malt liquor, doesn't have the vomitty aftertaste of Coors and hopefully wouldn't give me the sniffles like Budweiser does. I'll stick to finer beers when they're available, but if I ever need to pack a whole bunch of ethanol into as few calories and dollars as I can stand, I'll reach for a case of Steel Reserve."
"Steel Reserve 211 is a great choice if you want an inexpensive beer that will pack a punch. If you're looking for a good tasting beer to sit back and enjoy this will not be the one. That being said, this may not be a bad choice for a tailgate party. First of all it is cheap (less than 6 bucks for the 12-pack) and has a high ABV% to get the job done quicker for less money. If you're having a family party with good food, you may want to stick with the traditional beer choice."
"drinkability; really alcoholic and the aftertaste reminds of this. Still, quite an easy drink. Really quite good for a malt liqour and the alcohol taste that does come through, is actually a bit warm and pleasant."
"Pure white frothy head of two fingers, leaving some lace with moderate cling. Color matches a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of cooked grain, some veggies, and the burn of alcohol. Taste is sweet corn, malt, and maybe they floated a hop over the top of the kettle. Mouthfeel is average, better than tap water, but not quite the cream or even half and half. Tasty enough to drink while grilling out, or raking leaves."
"Drinkability? I have drained many a 40 of this when money is tight, so quite high. It's thick and sticky and packs quite a wallop, but I'd take a 40 of this over 6 cans of BMC light any day."
"D- This beer is gross. I don't know if I like this at all. A 40oz would be way to much to drink. The alcohol is off putting even for a malt liquor. I'm not ever going to try this one ever again."
"The taste has grain and alcohol. Somewhat acidic, and very unpleasant. Light bodied, average carbonation. Cheap, low quality swill. Don't bother with this one."
"D- Wow! Not even a sipper. Overpowered with raw alcohol taste and corn. The honey and lemon hints just add to a medicine taste. Thick, burning, and hard to swallow. Won't buy ever."
"Steel Reserve is pretty rough overall. I shudder when I pull this beer from my mystery beer machine. That being said, I guess it tastes about the same as most malt liquor. If you're looking to get messed up, this would probably get the job done, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything else."
"The American Malt Liquor is surely an under appreciated style given my experience this evening. Yet it does offer some insight as to what it actually costs to make, package and distribute a beer."
"I have had very limited experience with American Malt Liquors, as to estimation, they are pretty much simply a quick, cheap way to get intoxicated. That said, they do have their place, but this one has a very sweet alcoholic taste that after several sips, gets harder and harder to put down the rest of the glass. Strong taste of corn, fruitiness, and a bit of malt, but above all, a very potent alcohol flavor makes itself present in the nose and taste. Moutfheel is actually kind of thick for the style, with little carbonation and almost overwhelming sweet, thick mouthfeel. Overall, I seriously doubt I'll ever buy this one again, as it seems to be nothing more than a cheap way to get intoxicated. Don't get me wrong, I believe malts have their place, but this one is just too damn sweet and overpowering to be even somewhat drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is only good for getting wasted when you are broke. Then again save your money."
"I would not recommend this to anyone other than someone whom is looking to get a quick buzz or looking to get trashed quick."
"This is the first beer I have reviewed that I flat out did not like. Nothing about it was appealing to me, the color, scent and taste were all the same level of blandness. I would not reccomend this beer."
"This beer's taste and smell is seared into my memory. The one positive experience I have from this is that I will forever know what all 1's is for my palate."
"Overall, this beer is not what I was expecting. I was really expecting a mess, but with the exception of the alcohol taste and mouthfeel, this beer is not half bad. Has to be a great representation of the style."
"Would pair pretty good with a snack tray or burgers."
"This is the sort of drink you choke down if you're looking to rub up against a warm body and don't want to remember. At the risk of being banned, I'll wonder out loud what he Bros were thinking on this one."
"suddenly sleepy have hard time finish can. hard time seeee moontor wile tiping not be keeeep dreenkng fer sur not be drink more this... spinnneeeeng take more sipp most gonee think sik why ggg"
"Taste is along the same lines. Noticeable corn, cooked veggies, and a big time alcohol wave that isn't all that pleasant. Tons of sweetness from the malt - At least the malt bill is noticeable! I honestly don't know how I used to drink this so much. I did make it through the bottle though, so it could be worse. Actually, it's better than a lot of other malt liquors, so I think my issue is just with the style in general. Im no longer a man... Fuck you craft beer!"
"D - I guess its pound-able, after a few good beers but not even. Please never let me buy this again. Should of got another ABA at the place I went, totally not worth it. I think I'm going to pour it down the drain, but no its beer."
"I really anticipated Steel Reserve to be a huge disaster. Honestly, it's not. I picked this for my 1000th review as a joke. But this is nowhere close to being the worst beer I've ever had. Truth. It's not good. Definitely lacking in aromatics, flavor, and just about everything else. But...if the Malt Liquor mood strikes, I can honestly say that Steel Reserve isn't a terrible choice."
"The drinkability of this beer is really dependant on your plans for the night. Definately not a sipping beer. Its not the best beer to grab for if you have important plans that day. But it can be a very fun beer to start your night off with."
"And it isn't too drinkable with a stupid high alcohol content for a cheap beer."
"Despite what this is, I say it's average. Yeah it's not the best, but it's not the worst. Yeah I wouldn't break this out at a fancy party, but for like a game or some other event where I'm supplying the beer and everyone's main goal is intoxication, why not? It's hardly as bad as bad as Old E or any of those malt liquors. Plus it's 8.1% abv. All I'm saying is that when there's a party or something, why spend the extra money on Bud or Miller products that (in my opinion) taste about the same and have less alcohol? Anyone at your party that doesn't like it can always bring their own, and those that give it a chance will appreciate it when the 8.1% kicks in."
"Absolutely one of the worst malt liquors ever. This doesnt even compare to a warm King Cobra or Old English. If youre broke, or a hobo living behind Circle K and you need a cheap disgusting 40 ouncer, then you will love this. If that is not you. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE"
"O: Worse than I expected and I wasn't expecting much. Give me a Miller Lite over this any day."
"Ah the Steel Reserve how do you do? Tallboy for $1.99 at the local Stater Bros. A big sweet malt liqour. Tons of sweetness, green apple. I've been drinking this for awhile and as I'm finishing up it's NOT getting ghastly, big plus there. A big, mean, nasty malt liqour but still holds some respectibility being that it's still drinkable as it warms. Handle with caution."
"Some times you want to get plastered for cheap, and this'll do it better than anything else out there."
"D-Pretty easy drinking for 8%. It drinks like a hoppier version of Miller High Life, which isn't a bad thing for a malt liquor."
"I poured into a pint glass to one inch of white head. It is gold in color. The aroma is grainy sweet with alcohol. The taste is sweet with alcohol. The mouthfell is thin. This is a rough beer to drink. The ABV is great for getting ripped, but other than that it's worthless. Don't get me wrong. Every now and then you just need to get lit!"
"Notes: About what I expected from this. It's primary function is a cheap way to get alcohol in your system. For what it is, it doesn't taste horrible and gets the job done."
"D - Drank this one back in the day and decided to give it a whirl while I was kinda broke at only $1.20 for a 24oz. can who can really complain? Anyway, for what it is, it's a pretty good beer."
"Bottom line-- I'd take this over Miller or Coors any day!"
"Overall I think I will pass, though I will admit it was better then the colt 45, but that was not saying very much. I think I am going to have more fun reviewing the things from the ""bottom"" then from the top, lol."
"It's $2.49/40oz here. Take one home, and let it lift you. It won't make your stomach gurgle like other crap 40's."
"drinkability: it can go either way.. i found it not so bad to drink. i wouldn't session this beer though."
"Pretty damn drinkable. Goes down smooth and remails fairly non-offensive. Tied for second place."
"D- As far as malt liquors go, this isn't a bad choice. Vastly superior to the majority of macro swill."
"Highly recommended if you are 15/alleyway dweller/masochistic."
"Cheers...."
"Drinkability- Contrary to widespread opinion (much of which seems to be held by people who have not actually tried this beer and instead rely on secondhand accounts), Steel Reserve is one of the better examples of malt liquor. Just be sure to finish the 40oz fairly quickly because it does exhibit the unsavory quality of becoming rather nasty as it warms up."
"D- dangerous for being 8.1%, as malt liquor, keep the shakes away fluid goes not too bad a choice, but I would obviously rather be drinking something better, like an actual ale with some flavor."
"You can drink this stuff, but now I remember why I haven't touched this beer since I was in high school."
"Feel is very watery and hot, despite the cold serving temperature. Carbonation is passable, but there really is not too much else going for this brew. Drinkability scores low due to the horrible flavor and that high alcohol content does not remedy the situation. Though if you have more than one of these, you may not remember how horrible this tastes."
"I would NEVER buy this again!"
"This one is as bad as it gets."
"Taste isn't too bad it's similar to Stella in the malt, basically no hops, the booze and corn Totally dominate. Really it's not too bad for what it is."
"Not something I would normally drink, but based on the style I have to admit it is pretty good. There is a surprising amount of flavor to this one. Better than you would expect."
"Easily one of the better Bargain beers out there, Maybe the best Malt Liquor I have come across, and easily as good as many of the main stream American Macro Lagers."
"Conclusion: Not a beer I would pick up for myself at the store or serve to my friends, but if you're at a party, it's not a bad pick. The crispness is very refreshing if its hot out. Not my taste but also far from horrible."
"This can't be right... did I just admit to LIKING Steel Reserve? Official malt liquor of the the more sophisticated homeless person? Taste is a mysterious thing sometimes."
"D: easy when cold, harder as it warms, typical for the style."
"This beer is definitely not a keeper."
"RJT"
"Steel Reserve is that ""cheap beer"" for me, seeing as it is under $11 for a 12 pack of 24oz cans. It is not ""good beer"" or ever ""adequate beer", no, it is a drinkable liquid that lets me forget the day, both prior and after-wards. I bought this on a whim, and it made me forget how bad of a day it had, but also incapacitated me for most of the next day. I would only buy this again if I were either A. Homeless B. Desperate to get drunk or C. A Cheapskate..."
"Very thin-bodied, slightly grainy tastes with an alcoholic sweetness. The slightly spicy taste reminds me of a noble hop taste. I've been having a fairly tough time making it through the entire 16 ounces."
"Why is the ABV unknown in the description? It says plainly 8.1% on the can."
"Medium body, crisp mouthfeel. The taste isn't that bad on this one, just like sweet water making it easy to drink without being too overwhelming. Hell you can let this one get to about a full 40 degrees before it starts tasting weird. For malt liquor, Steel Reserve is better than most."
"Overall, I'm glad such a low priced beer even exists at the local corner market where sixers of BMC go for six bucks."
"Drinkability: Chug, Chug, Chug! Cheap and lets get to the point it gets you F-ing smashed. Doesn't taste any worst coming back up!"
"Upon further review and repeated drinking, this is better than I initially gave it credit for. I feel like regular purchases have earned this a better drinkability score. I like Steel Reserve."
"Poured from a 24 ounce can with a freshness date on the bottom April 2010. Hell yeah this is fresh. Poured into a pint glass with about 1.5 inches of head. I can smell corn, rice and other almost acidic scents. Lots of corn and sweetness in the flavor. Oh yeah the alcohol is not hidden well. But this is one of my all time favorite malt liguors. Crack a 40 turn up some heavy metal and cheap pizza and rock out."
"Drinkability? Bad. It tastes bad, so it's difficult to drink. The label claims things like ""twice the hops and malts as 'many normal lagers'"" but I can't taste them."
"the only good thing about getting a case of steel reserve is that I now have a recyclable container (the box) in which I can put my paper recycling. the canned version is pretty bad as well, not that i was expecing the whole beer to change, but at least it doesnt smell or taste like two hundred percent skunked garbage unlike the bottled."
"Notes: This beer straddles the line between light lager and adjunct lager as far as rating the categories goes. It looks like a light lager, but tates like a full bodied lager along the lines of a budweiser, so that is how I rated it. I would rather have a Bud if I wanted cheap and some taste, but I would rather have a light beer if I just wanted volume. So it kind of falls into a hole on its own."
"drinkability - never again - this was a drain pour - this beer is only for those who want to get drunk for little money"
"this isnt a beer to buy to taste, you drink these to get drunk. it tastes and smells pretty much like watered down grainy corny mash. it looked ok, but thats just because it had a little more color than light beers. i probably wont be buying this again."
"I used to drink these from time to time. They have a significance in my history as I was introduced to Steel Reserve right after I moved out to Columbus. I felt it deserved a BA review for that reason and that reason alone."
"D- I can see why this is cheap, but I can see why people drink it. It has a high ABV and doesn't taste just awful. It is meant to be drank in large quantities as I used to do with friends."
"D: Very cheap, you get drunk quickly and you can buy it at almost all gas stations."
"D: If it's cold enough, you can take it down quickly. And I recommend doing so."
"I have to say that this beer is more of an american malt beverage than a true lager. In fact, to call it a lager is a crime! I must say it would be great for someone who wants to get smashed! It's high 8.9% ABV is sneeky and will definatly hit you after just one of these mediocre beers. No wonder it is called ""High Gravity""! I would never serve this to guests but might drink if I need a good buzz!"
"Notes: For some reason all the Steel Reserve around here is 6.0% ABV. Maybe that makes it more palatable."
"Well, now, didn't a nice two fingers' worth of rocky bone-white head appear to my delight? Betcha! The retention was phenomenal, well exceeding expectations and beginning to form some nice lace as it reduced. Nose, however, was rubbish. It was fusel, adjunct, perfumy, cloying. I could really do without this sort of thing. Color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity. Nothing new, but nothing wrong with that aspect of it. Mouthfeel was medium with a candy sweetness on the tongue. I mean really sweet, like cotton candy. It was not necessarily unpleasant, but for a hophead, it was pegging the opposite end of the meter. It needed an offsetting swig of water to cut the sweetness. Finish was smooth, as advertised, but at the extreme finish, I was still jonesin' for some water and then some hops. WAY too sweet. This had ""hangover"" tattooed all over it. Suck a couple of these bad boys down, fall asleep, and awake with a mother of a dehydrated brain housing group. Ouch."
"Cheers!"
"D - The only saving grace here is that it gets you drunk, so soon you won't be tasting this nasty beer. I'll admit it: Steel Reserve was a go-to beer for me in college, and one of the brands that captivated me before I turned 21. However, now that I've matured and the most important factor for me in buying beer isn't alcohol-to-price ratio (for which, really, Steel Reserve cannot be beaten), I'll only drink one of these when I want to re-experience old times."
"Poured a decent golden yellow with some nice fizzy head, a bit of lacing, and a fair amount of carbonation. Very sweet and malty scent, not a lot of characteristics, but not bad. Funky taste, slightly skunky, not a lot there beyond a sweet maltiness. Goes down slightly thick and not as refreshing as it should have been. Won't get it for myself."
"Too watery, but as it goes for cheap beer, this is one of the better I have had."
"notes:not going to buy this one again unless i am just looking to get a buzz with cheap change."
"Taste: The taste is the worst thing this beer has going for it. Too much of a corn adjunct taste to it."
"The mouth on this is thin and slick. I don't like the feel of this at all. Flavor is of sweet malts. Slight fruity aftertaste which is weird. Not bad for a game night or a ball game. This would hit the spot, but I've had better malt liquors."
"Poured from a 24 oz can into a tall ale glass. Clear dark yellow beer with a finger of foam that didn't last long. Smelled like a corn field. Tasted sweet, sweeter than many I've tried. Mouthfeel was weak and unremarkable. Maybe I've missed the point."
"D - This is meant for one thing only - getting trashed. The flavor is waaaay too sweet to be an easy drinker."
"Low flavor, high alcohol...what a novel concept. The taste is very watery and mildly sweet. Alcohol is noticeable, but hidden well. Pretty smooth, goes down easy. Only reason to drink this is to catch a buzz, cause it tastes like nothing."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a pale golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is of malts, some alcohol. The taste is not paticularly good, alcohol is present, some malts.Feels light in the mouth and has below average drinkability. Overall there is nothing great about this beer."
"At $6.79 a twelver, this is a regular for me when I just want something decent to get things going with."
"Overall, I've had worse, but like those others I'll never be trying this again. Drank about 3 ounces, got a headache, decided not to experiment with the rest of the can."
"It's definitely smooth drinking. Not particularly flavorful drinking, but then again that's not why you buy it is it? For a cheap malt liquor it's pretty good though, no shame in buying it compared to the average."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can marked OCT2609-G08011034. Sampled on June 23, 2009. The pour was mainly yellow and clear with an incredible carbonated head about four inches thick and I did not even shake the can. But it faded directly. Surprisingly good lacing. It had the aroma of malts, barley, and alcohol and the alcohol was the leading scent. The taste was not quite as alcohol-strong as the aroma but it was there along with vague malts and hops. It warmed up my earlobes and that only seems to happen when I drink Miller products. This is gut-cleaning booze."
"I've drunk this beer from time to time over several months, always served in glass from the 40 oz. bottles. The color is a fresh yellow tinged toward green rather than red, the aroma is slight, the head is sturdy at first but doesn't last, giving way to a lacy residue. While this beer has never bowled me over in the way that certain German, Czech and Dutch lagers/pilsners have, it is nevertheless of a reliably high quality and remarkably satisfying to drink. I find it difficult to imagine how it can have rated such low grades, unless the previous evaluators simply don't like lagers."
"But, honestly, you smell like a sweaty dad."
"The only reason this doesn't get a 5 is the price, as it is generally harder to find than most beers, and often slightly more expensive. The alcohol content makes for a nice buzz, and given my size, I could drink this stuff all day. The large cans (16-24 oz) help with this."
"Pours a golden color with a fizzy head that rapidly vanishes. Its far from flat though; lots of bubbles. Smells slightly of alcohol and strongly of grains and corn. There's a faint skunkiness to it but there's that in all these. I remember this being grosser for some reason. It actually drinks pretty easy. Am I supposed to review the drinkablity of this guy in regards or other malt liquors? Tastes pretty clean, not too corny. I should mix this up in my malt liquor rotation. It might be just better out of the 24 ounce can as opposed to the 40s."
"if you're trying to get to where you need to go (with mostly shortcuts),this is the malt liquor for you.being a college student,this is better than pee-water (natty light),and actually has flavor to it (flavor being subjective of course.)"
"i would never buy this beer again, unless i was really really broke and needed to get really drunk really fast. i cant have respect for a beer that i see almost every homeless person drinking. thank god i only have one can of this stuff. stold it from my friends fridge as it had been sitting there for about a month untouched. i would prolly drink this if i was at a party or something, but would still reach for pretty much any other popular macro lager."
"$6.50 for a 12 pack at 8.1% abv?!? Worth every penny in my book. It would be a damn shame to throw this over your backyard fence into the street for no reason whatsoever!"
"picked up a 22oz bottle the other day, only because i had never tried it before and it was only like $1.29 ish. i read the reviews here on beer advocate FIRST before trying it and i was expecting the worst. it turned out not as bad as i imagined. i was surprised that the 8.1% was hardly noticable...until i got to the bottom of that 22oz, then i felt it. i might buy this beer again just because it was so cheap. i would not recomend it though."
"When pouring from the big can, the foam was light wheat in color and dissapated quickly. The color was light gold yellow. The smell had a sence of high gravity (which there is). The smell was also deep, hops overtone with a hint of wheat and a hint of floral. The taste was heavy, dull and hight gravity hops. Mouthfeel - heavy and full-bodied. Drinkability - it would be good if it weren't for the dominate high gravity feel."
"Final Thoughts - I revisited Steel Reserve recently when a friend brought it over. It was actually surprisingly decent for what it is, and most likely receives harsh reviews for being compared to an Imperial IPA or stout. Keeping the style in mind, this delivers on many levels. Try one with an open mind before you review."
"I'm sure my Beer Karma will take a hit for admitting drinking this."
"I just wanted to add to the dialog that I think some of you are being too harsh on 211. You have to rate Steel for what it is, an 8.1% lager that is widely available and can be purchased for a couple of bucks - 40oz - or $7 for a 12 pack. You can't compare it directly against expensive craft beers, they serve different purposes. You can't tell me that the A,S,T,M,D of a beer is the same regardless of what you paid for it. If a single 22oz bomber costs me $7 or more I know I'm going to be rating it with different expectations in mind that include a justification of the cost."
"Not the best malt liquor ever but not too shabby. Probably will never buy this again but you never know. If I ever decide to slum it again this will be the beer I'll get."
"Note: Good beer for the price of being buzzed."
"When you are in the mood to just drink and not worry about flavor this could be your brew if not Haffenreffer, or Narragansett."
"edit: I picked up a 12 pack for $7.99 locally. They evidently make the same stuff in 12oz cans now."
"Dangerously drinkable, in a manner that suggests that if you don't respect this beer, it'll mess you up hardcore. Not bad in a quantity of one, as it's very inoffensive, and doesn't seem as strong as it is at first. I can see why it seems to be the beer of choice for the local hobos, jduging by the many empty cans that seem to congregate under the freeway."
"Appearance seems a nice golden amber with a fair head. Smell and taste is a sweet malty metallic with a of course alchohol making it a bit rough around the edges. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. It's kinda what I expected and not, but for the price, hey why not."
"22oz Bottle. A golden yellow pour with a big white fizzy head,lots of carbonation, strong aroma of corn husks,boiled vegetables,and moldy cracked corn, Flavor is a lot like the aroma some corn,wet straw,and cheep vodka,really cheep,with a less than pleasent barnyard aftertaste, this was a drainpour folks, I can power through most nasty beers but not this one... Fail , I'm sorry but if I have to get drunk this bad I will buy a bottle of mouthwash at the Dollar Store"
"MotherofGod. Out of a 24 oz. can this beer was a perfectly clear, pale gold color with lots of visible rising carbonation. The two finger head was slightly off-white and retained nicely at first as a puffy cap, then a small collar. The aroma was of corn mash, pale malt, alcohol and faint hops. The flavors were actually pretty good. Well, for a malt liquor anyway. I tasted pale malt, sweet malt, cereal grains, hints of metal and a touch of hop bitterness. Left an oily slick on my tongue. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation good. Best when damn near frozen, but for 6% quite drinkable. If you gotta go Malt, it's a cheap, classic choice."
"D: Quite assertively corny...which is probably to be expected. Given that, it pulls it off pretty admirably. It's quite adjuncty and boozy, but it never becomes a chore to drink, which is as impressive as it is baffling. If you're on an extreme budget, you could do a lot worse."
"D 2.0, this beer is not for me, bteer than expected, but almost undrinkable"
"Note - Had this again recently, I compared it side by side with Hurricane High Gravity. Both where equally drinkable, even as it warmed. I almost prefer this over the HHG. Recommended for what it is, not bad."
"swill that's available. Feels weird saying it, but this is not all that bad. I'm under no illusion that it's great either. Somewhat ironically, it seems that a few years of experience with big-ass beers like Imperials Pilsners, Strong Euro Lagers and even Double IPAs gives you the tools to appreciate a beer like this. I'm not any kind of malt liquor expert, but there are no doubt many worse out there than this. I'm pleasantly surprised."
"I'm glad I finally found a beer that I can drink alot of for cheap and not actually mind the taste of. I will happily buy this again! Plus the bottle looks pretty cool."
"Now I buy two 24oz cans on Wednesday nights and bring them to the pool hall, leaving one in the fridge there until Friday night when I return. Perfect sipping beer, but you have to develop a taste for its queer flavor. It's worth it in the long run."
"Absolutely clear, dark yellow with a big fizzy white head that settles to a skim of fine foam that leaves little lace. Smells of cooked grits and caramel with a nice hit of grain alcohol. Tastes fairly sweet and brashly alcoholic but finishes pretty clean for the style, nothing really off, just a one trick pony. Heavy duty carbonation and medium bodied. This beer is for those that want a powerful beer that is way inexpensive and it succeeds on both fronts. Easier drinking than most Malt Liquors."
"cheers"
"Its something I would definitely buy again, given that what I normally consider a cheap alternative like PBR doesn't taste much better and has half the alcohol content. Might as well get a bigger bang for you buck when you're not going for flavor."
"D: Not very flavorful at all, goes down ok, not filling at all, strong kick, it's a decent representation of its style for whatever that might be worth. There are definitely better high-octane beers out there that you can put away quickly, if that's what you're going for."
"Overall: not good, but better than expected"
"Seriously, this brew runs rings around any of the big three's Ice beers, as well as LaBatt, Molson, etc. It pours with a decent head, keeps a lace to the end (my glass is always soap free), and presents a slight floral smell as it warms and a taste of almond or marzipan, and of course alcohol. To my thinking, currently this is the only one of it's kind."
"M- Feels like a beer, and especially an AML."
"This isn't to sip and savor. Keep it cold and git 'er dun, otherwise it'll get wicked ugly."
"Had a 40oz of this back in college, attracted by its alcohol content. It was a straw gold color with a bad head. There was little smell at all, but a tad sweet. The mouthfeel was nothing special as its carbonation was overpowering. The drinkability is okay but difficult at 8.1ac."
"Compared to others in the style (Colt 45, Mickey's, etc.) I would have to say this is my favorite. You just wont ever catch me drinking one in public ;)"
"(rated Oct 18, 2008)"
"D - I doubt I would buy this in any quantity to drink myself, but if I had to it wouldn't be that bad. Certainly one of the best malt liquors I've had striking an exceptional balance between American macros and other heavy, sweet, and hot malt liquors."
"This was an eye-opener in a way. It's simply not that bad."
"It's well known this is no conisseur's beverage, but for what it is, it is excellent. Ok, maybe not excellent. It's alright. I would pick a 40 of steel over any quantity of budweiser any day. I find it to be highly drinkable. The taste I think is not at all revolting. As a homeless man once said to me, it goes down easy, doesnt fight back. It's perfect for that winding down, after work part of the day if you have only two dollars in your pocket. so, again, highly recomended if you are broke and thirsty."
"In this case, the drinkability is directly related to the taste. you have to drink this beer the same way you would assault an enemy bunker: hard and fast. speed is the key."
"Drinkability not bad. I don't know that I could/would do a true ""40", but I would put the drinkability at ""above average"" for style, but still harsh. Within cost/style it has a balance and smoothness."
"It could be worse, was pleasantly surprised at the steel reserve. Hides the booze well for an 8.1% brewsky, however still find notes of cheap alcohol as if spiked with some isopropyl. I'd choose a steel reserve over many canned macro's as you don't need to drink as many to achieve the desired effect. Nothing offensive, surprisingly smooth, not much to look forward too, and gives one hell of a headache."
"I was not disappointed by this beer because it was exactly as I expected. The appeareance and smell were average, nothing bad. The taste was exactly as the can says, steel. Metallic taste with a lot of malt. This would be a beer I drank in high school to get drunk quickly, but now that I my taste buds have matured I would pass on having it again."
"Many people give malt liquor, especially this brand, a bad name, but in terms of drinkability, most beers won't go down as smooth as this one. You can't knock it until you've tried it."
"It has a decent mouthfeel and buzz factor, but I would not recommend this to many people."
"mouthfeel is bruising, light weight, good carbonation, not my favorite malt liquor but available and cheap."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Pleasantly crisp and light with a moderate malt/adjunct sweetness. Fairly clean for a malt liquor, there's a hint of cooked corn, but it's faint. No real noticeable alcohol, at colder temperatures at least; I've got no desire to try this warm. Overall, this doesn't really have much flavor, bad or good. The finish is clean - no bittering hops as far as I can tell, nor any strong residual sugars. Not a bad little brew for 99 cents, I can understand why it's favored by drunks and the homeless. For half the price of your average micro six pack you can do some serious liver damage."
"With half of the Brown Paper Bag Invitation complete, we resume tomorrow with another malt liquor."
"Mouthfeel is decently crisp and refreshing. The overly boozy quality of this beer is a little but too much. I could use some balance."
"If I have to...I'll buy it again."
"Gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is corn and alcohol.Taste is burning alcohol and a pretty bitter finish.This is the text book definition of a cheap heavy buzz.As a session beer pretty poor,as a way to get drunk quickly this is your brew!!"
"In a rather sad but brief, thankfully, period in my life I drank this all the time. It was the hellish year I spent in GA and my wife and I seperated for a few months. I used to buy 12-packs of this for $6 almost everynight. I can recall the pale gold body with a dieing head before it even became a head. The smell never bothered me since instead of that cheap adjunct smell is was an aroma of light hops (and metal). While the taste wasn't much to speak of, some veggies and minor malt sweetness for a second, drinking it very cold made the beer go down real smooth and didn't nuke my tastebuds or anything. But I don't plan on drinking this again, ever."
"D: Not a bad malt liquor, a good choice for a high alcohol beer on the cheap."
"I love beer advocate. It lets you know when you've spent too much on a crappy beer. I'm a beer drinker but have no idea of half of these so called "" Great beers"" are. I cant drink the traditional ""Bud, Corona, blah blah"" I drink them and i feel bloated and have a headache. But 211 always does the job. Quick and efficient. I can admit that when i drink steel i hold my nose while im gulping (all i taste is seltzer water, by the way i dont hold my nose with my fingers) and 2 or three cans later im good. I drank 14 icehouse one night and was buzzed with a horrible headache. Drank 8 samuel adams and felt like i got robbed.(17$ a 12 pack, I couldve went to a bar!) But 4 12oz 211's and i was good. If you want to drink beer and feel bloated and have a headache, then fine. But its like going somewhere, you can take the long ""toll roads"" or you can pay somebody a dollar and he'll ""show you the shortcuts"" Right on 211, id rather drink 96 ounces of ass, than 140 ounces of "" Premium Beer"" anyday."
"Drinkability is low. This is pretty horrible. Lacks flavor, aroma, body. Worth a buck for the ""experience"" but once is plenty."
"And after reading the person's review below me: pennies in water is the EXACT taste, thank you for clarifying"
"Body is moderate and for volume is rather smooth. Even for style we have a lot of off notes here that just don't fit."
"Awful!"
"Mouthfeel is thin and dry, which is strange given the cloying sweet taste."
"For getting a big buzz on the cheap (if your stomach can stand it) get some Steel Reserve! To describe the taste as objectively as possible, I would say that it is reminiscent of castor oil and liniment. The texture of the beer in the mouth is as of used motor oil, greasy and clammy. Embalming fluid probably has less alcohol than this stuff! Not for the faint of heart, this stuff."
"I want to appologize for bashing this beer. It had been probably 8 years since I last drank this stuff and I was thinking that since my taste in beer has matured over the years I would now be able to appreciate even this beer as long as I kept the style in mind. I do like strong beers, Double Bocks, Smoked Porters, and Barleywines, but this didn't work for me; I'm just not into this style anymore. This beer brought to mind times long gone by of when I sat with my crusty punk friends in old dilapitated houses drinking this or Camo or Magnum and being very disrespectful to beer. This is why I didn't like beer until I was 25, because this was all I was ever exposed to. I even had a hangover the following day, and I only get those on New Years and the day after my birthday. Beer almost never gives me a hangover and to get one from just one 24oz can."
" Some people obviously like this stuff, but I will pass on this one. There are so many good beers in this world, so why waste time on the beers like this one."
"This is a one of a kind beer. The color was a dull golden. The smell was skunky. I got it from a 24 oz can. The taste was malty and tasted like alcohol. The mouthfeel was thick and syurpy. I was not a big fan, I prefer a colt 45 if I want malt liquor."
"I've had a few of these out of the 12 ounce bottle a couple of years ago at my uncle's house. I remembered that they were rather decent and that I got one heck of a quick buzz going. Tonight I wasy a 24 ounce silver can at my grocer's freezer for a buck so why not pick one up (I considered picking up more than one, but they aren't going anywhere so why waste the money) I said to myself. Pours a dirty yellow, light copper color with a frothy head that soon dwindles down. no lacing and minimal carbonation which I assume is due to a high alcohol content. I take a wiff and bam it hits me this is malt liquor in disguise, packaged as a strong lager. Well now I know that what has to be done is to start swillin' quickly and forget about it. Bad on the palate, and the flavor is typical of malt liquor. Overall this is not a good beer in any sense, and I suggest you walk on home boy."
"While I don't have a lot of experience with malt liquors, I'd have to say this surprised me. For having an 8.1% alcohol by volume rating I was surprised at how subtle it was. Unlike a lot of Ice brewed beers I've tried that have tasted thin and metallic, this beer had more flavor and heartiness to it. The smell was what threw me off as it reeks of high alcohol content. Overall I wouldn't drink this beer often, but it's not a beer I would refuse to drink."
"The can looks awesome. Kudos to he who designed the label - truly first class. I'd buy anything that looks this aesthetic at least once."
"You only drink this malt liqour to do one thing get messed up really quick. Great when you want a good buzz without alot of cash. It does taste horrible though, but I have to admit I like the STEEL once in a while. Used to be a staple when I wanted a quick buzz in college. Now it's rather disgusting."
"I tried to kiss you but you sliced my tongue in half with your metal. I tried to hold you but you ran so thin through my fingers. As we began our first dance you brought forth your wrath and smote me across my face, whispering ""you shall fall."" In desperate straits I strangled you face down on the kitchen table, wrestled your convulsing body to the sink, and washed away your wretched soul with tears of joy. I hope you perish and woe betide those who walk with your kin."
"overall, not a good brew i wouldnt recommend"
"washed down food quite well. Not bad for a cheap beer."
"D: After a bunch of beers not that bad. Nothing I would seek out though."
"This stuff is really cheap and obviously has some kind consumer market. This golden colored jewel has a beautifull white head for about a second. The smell is hard to take. Bitter, stale and harsh. The taste is not much better. A thick syrupy body with lots of carbonation makes this pretty rough. Not advised."
"Prost!"
"The taste is similar, very alcoholic and winey, a bit sweet, malty, and meaty. It's strong and a tad harsh but has definite, full, musky, fruity flavours with a hint of sweet grain. It's somewhat interesting, and has a sweet, pungent alcoholic quality, bite, and warmth. It has medium body and a slightly thick, oily palate."
"But not as"
"One trick for improving the taste if you should choose to pour this in a glass is to squeeze in a slice of lime. Makes it more refreshing on a hot summer day"

"I can't explain why I drank this last night but I needed this to transend a barrier!!!! Had 666 as my review score and couldn't hang with that but this brew truely sucks!!! So I hope you guys don't succumb to the massive hangover Because ./5 is much cheaper, much better, and a lot easier on the body!!!"
"Got this beauty in a 40 oz for $2. Truly one of the finest beverages I've ever seen, smelt or tasted. Poured a delightful straw color with tons of tiny little bubbles. Thankfully, no head was in view. Nose was an aromatic acidic sweetness and grain. Taste was likewise, although the deliciously biting mouthfeel basically made the taste non-existent. This was so good I even almost finished one."
"Smells like homebrew bottling sugar.. .all corn, and I couldn't smell any hops at all. Tastes interesting actually - at first no taste at all, as the carbonation breaks into very fine bubbles. This is followed by a ton of sweet unfermented sugars (corn) at the front of the mouth, yet follows very dry in the mouth and finishes with a light alcohol burn in the mouth. Like Hurricane, this is a half step up for the style. Mouthfeel is thick watery sugar, and while it's not a quality brew it's escapes that cidery burn taste that I usually detect in a shitty American corn beer (I think I'd prefer this to Bud). Drinkability..? Hmm. The style is meant to be drunk from a paper bag, alongside a spliff or blunt -- I have neither. But it's drinkable especially if you remind yourself that afterwards, you can chase with a good pils or Anchor."
"Appearance is deep gold, a bit richer than most mass produced beers. Taste is rich, malty sweetness with just a kiss of hop and an alcohol finish. I rather like its balance. Head is pure white with fine bubbles that dissipates quickly, leaves little lacing. Mouth feel is bit thin for the robust flavors of this brew, but then, for 99 cents a bomber(!) you could do worse."
"edit - I feel my C- might be a little low, so give it a shot if you've never had it. It's really not all that bad and does in a pinch. (for me)"
"I've had better, and I've had worse. Let's just leave it at that."
"D - A 24oz can for $.99!?!?! If you can only take one it makes the rest of the night go smooth. I can drink about 2 24ozer's before I need a change."
"D - Malt beverages are not my first choice for well anything I'm not a pro at evaluating them but I can say that this one is better than their triple export version"
"Pours a pale straw color with a small head. Smell is adjuncts, slightly sweet. Fairly typical malt liqour/macro aroma. Very light taste. Adjuncts. Dull sweetness. A touch of alcohol. Again pretty typical for the style. Light bodied which is as it should be. Fairly drinkable. Average malt liqour overall."
"Drinkability: I find this very easy to drink. It is not exactly the most complex beer, but it isn't the ass-tasting drink that I read about beforehand."
"LOL...I had to revisit my high school days when I would scrap some money up and buy a couple 40's of this or some other high octane, low-cost, garbage malt liquor. Very pale color, very well carbonated with not much of a head. Smells of adjuncts and skunk. Tastes of adjuncts and skunk as well with a big alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is watery and very carbonated. Tastes like ass and only good for the broke looking for a buzz."
"Oh God this stuff is fuel for debauchery. I don't think anyone can say they really like the taste of it. It tastes like alcohol and ass. But nothing is better for the purpose it's brewed for. It tastes horrible, but it does go down smooth and that's the real point isn't it? I only reserve this stuff for when I'm really desperate to get as drunk as possible very fast. Chugging a 40 right before a concert is a lot of fun. Bye the time you get to the gate you've gone from sober to acting like a blathering idiot faster than should be possible. Be warned, Steel Reserve is for black belt drinkers only. If you're not an experienced drinker you'll never keep an entire 40 down. Chugging a 40 of Steel Reserve is a challenge but the reward is well worth it, and doesn't cost you a lot of money. Liquid crack."
"Copped a 40 oz in college and got wasted off two of them... Taste is bordering horrible with a strong alcohol presence that compltely detracts from whatever flavor is present... Appearance is equally poor with an awful aroma and a poor mouthfeel which leads to an atrocious level of drinkability... This beer is good to get wasted on, as the high alcohol percentage and cheap cost allows you to get shit-faced for as inexpensive as possible... really wouldn't drink this even if I was forced to... don't purchase this unless you are border-line broke... even then, don't drink this - drink water or orange juice... The flavor is pretty nauseating and I really wouldn't want to bash this beer anymore, but if its good for anything, its good for getting really intoxicated for as cheap as possible... Really not recommended..."
"Ah, so many good times, drinking a beer I wouldn't wish upon a penniless nepalese yak herder."
"24 ounce can dumped into my Oktoberfest mug. Looks to be a darkish gold color. When I was about 17 years old my friend and I had vodka but no beer. We hated vodka and wanted beer. So we bought O'Doul's and poured vodka into it. It was the most horrible concocktion I've ever had. Well THAT'S what this beer smells like. Crap malty, chemically, alcoholly, muddy, and... Just plain bad. I realize those aren't really words but I think they get my point across well. The taste is only slightly better. This stuff sucks. It's chewy and barely drinkable. But it's cheap and powerful. I'll avoid ever getting this beer again unless I want to feel a buzz and I only have $1.29 in my pocket."
"I don't think I will be letting my wife just pick something out again. I will try anything once so I don't regret it, but I had an entire 12 pack of this stuff."
"So after I'd had several years away from beer such as this, I thought I'd try another one night just to see what it was really like. It used to only be sold in 22 ounce bottles, today Ive found a twelve pack of cans. Actually not as terrible as I thought, but definitly not good. I liked it better than busch light or even bud light, but its not good. It is what it is. And if it gets somebody drunk at a cheap price, then it does serve a purpose."
"Had a roughness to it, not smooth like stated on the can. Seemed drinkable when cold the taste diminished as it warmed turned grainy,dry,strong alcohol taste,tart with some sourness. A strong beer more for a buzz than for enjoyment. Drink this one as cold and as fast as you can. Couldn't finish this beer once it got warm."
"Also, the day after drinking this I had an especially bad hangover."
"Touch of honey sweetness, maybe 20 IBU and very little on the nose and not very much to look at, carbonation is tight, keeps a decent tingle on the toune 30 minutes past the pour. This is going to become a regular in my fridge. Reminds me of discovering Shiner Bock back in college when I could buy cases and return the bottles... why did that have to end?"
"If you cannot afford to get anything else or this is the only thing available, this would be the only way I could recommed a beer like this"
"Notes: This is the first malt liquour i have ever taste, very nice flavor."
"I got the 22 oz bottle (the ""deuce"") for 99 cents. this beer is strong but its not that bad for cheap malt liquor. The beer of choice if you wanna get drunk on 3 dollars. If you get it ice cold its pretty good but the last 2 inches of beer is pretty bad. The hangover on this stuff is pretty bad also"
"Pours to a thin white head that reduces to a faint ring around the glass. Color is yellow and clear. Aroma is strong with sweet cereal grains and some banana and cream soda esters. Flavor is huge on sweet corn, alcohol and carbonation bite. Mouthfeel is thick for a yellow beer but kind of ""oily"". Finishes sweet with a bit of burn and prickle on the tongue. Funky veggie aftertaste builds up over time, especially with fried foods. This is a cheap buzz and will hit the spot, but has some drawbacks."
"This is just colt 45 to tthe next level. This is liquored up beer. The taste isnt good to say the least. The only thing that has going for it is the alcohol. It is evident that there are many ways to get alcohol better than this, The only other bost for this is the price. Yes it's dirt cheap. oz for oz it may be one of the cheapest forms of alcohol available in the beer catagory, but that doesent means it's good. The alcohol taste is overpowering of any beer flavor that may be there."
"Pale yellow color with a head that fades. Aroma is not too bad, somewhat fruity for a lager. Can claims that it has extra malted barley and select hops. Hmm. Taste is somewhat interesting. Tastes a lot like an old school lager. You couldn't tell that it's malt liquor due to the taste. It's not harsh either. I would actually rate it higher than many other macro/light lagers that I've had."
"D- I dont know if I could drink this all night and live to tell about it. After a couple, I could tell that I had a good buzz. If you wanted to get a buzz in a hurry, this is the beer to get. Ill probably get a Colt 45 next to compare the difference, and let you know."
"D: Quite drinkable compared to the rest of the malts out there today, this one would be my first choice every time."
"All in all it is a malt liquor. I also firmly believe that this beer has laxative properties as my morning after drinking this turned ugly."
"it's not the worst thing I've ever drank, but is far from the best. rogue's dad's little helper (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/132/30424) completely blows this away. I don't think I could finish a 40 of this due to its weightiness and overt sweetness, and even the 24 is kind of pissing me off at this point. but dammit I have to get my $1.75 (deposit included) worth, so down the hatch it goes."
"overall, it's only something i drink when i have less than 10 bucks in my wallet and i need to get drunk quick. an essential college beer, but not something i enjoy drinking (i think of it as medicine. doesn't taste good, but you gotta drink it)"
"Nah, I got more class than this swill, Steel Reserve, meet my sink!"
"Last words.. goot for getting goot!"
"hell, this is no Maudite."
"bought for 6.99 a twelve pack at Albertsons. The appearance is pretty standard for a macro malt liquor, maybe a tad bit darker than most. smelled halfway decent for a beer who's main concern is getting young kids drunk. Taste is exceptional for this type of product. I actually enjoy the taste of 211. A lot of people want a good session beer now, and I know that at 8.1%, it hardly falls under that category, but I don't mind throwing a few back. Mouthfeel is pretty standard. crisp, clean unoffensive. Drinkability is great because this is a beer intended to be pounded, not savored. It accomplishes this task quite well"
"Overall, one of the best alcohol delivery systems available. At $.99 a double 24oz can, it makes me glad I'm in college."
"Drunkability - +10 - Get'm drunk!"
"Big old bottle reminded my of my youth when all we cared about was volume and alcohol content. Thiis poured a light yellow with a white head that was gone in seconds and left no lacing. Nose of fermented corn, but it still smells somewhat like it was a chemical. There is a sweet taste but in general it is dominated by the alcohol content. The mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated. I suppose if it was poured at just above freezing you could choke this stuff down, but as it gets warmer it gets worse. A cheap drunk and not so great brew."
"A cheap beer to get drunk off of. You be the judge."
"Drinkability: It depends. It's all about your mood on this one, it's 2/11 today so I thought what the hell. If you want some stress relief it can be as drinkable as anything. It doesn't have a lot going for it in terms of flavor, but it also doesn't have some of the awful flavors from other cheap overproofed beers."
"last swigs: 8.1% ABV shows up to THIS! party. Had to try a new ""scrod beer"""
"Not a huge fan of the malt liquors, but heck my brother had me try this one. Pours with a moderate amount of carbination, which forms a light white head, and leaves behind a lacing all the way throuhg. Not too bad for a cheap brew. Gives off aromas of sweet malt with a hint of corn, which is shared in the taste as well. Finishes with a mild warmness."
"Overall - For it's price, you get what you expect: A decent lager with 8%."
"it's been a long time since i've had malt liquor. i guess molon xxx must have been the last. overall this beer isn't that bad for the style. i'd still put it behind colt 45. no real bad aftertaste and warming doesn't seem to hurt as much as other 40 oz. beers. and for $.99 a 40 oz. who can deny it's a good pick me up when you're low on cash."
"Overall: A good cheap one to get your freak on. One 24 oz. can = 4 regular beers. If youre looking to get hammered with a semi-acceptable beer for the lowest possible cost, this is the way to go. A completely acceptable buzz beer in my opinion. Take it for what its worth."
" The bottom line is that this was meant for ""chug-chug-chug"" but if you pour it into a glass and take you time you can still get drunk and enjoy it. I probably just ruined my credibility as a beer drinker..."
" Bottom Line: It's pretty obvious why this is so cheap, but hey if your in need of a pick me up and low on cash you should give this one a shot...Good luck"
" Wavz"
"As much as I want too, I can say that this is as bad as I thought it woudld be. It pretty much tastes like shit, but hey...at least it has character, and that is something that most BMC brews can't claim. I now lay me down to sleep under the freeway overpass while wrapping the newspaper a little tighter around my cardboard box enclosed frame. Good night moon. Good night stars. Goodnight sense of self respect."
"All in all a awful beer taste (chase with an orange flavor soda) to get wasted! I don't recommend as a regular but as a low budget drunkards beer! Have fun!"
"Drink-Ability: For .99 Cents for a 24oz its okay, but there is just better beer for a little more, Not one of my Top cheap beer choices."
"Pours a medium-dark yellow with a slightly off-white, frothy, slowly diminishing head. Some light lacing. Not bad looking for a malt liquor. The smell? Thats another story. Stinks of harsh alcohol and husky corn. Taste isnt much better. All about the corn, with a liquor-like alcohol burn to it. On the finish it feels like you should not exhale near an open flame. It has a medium body, lightly syrupy texture and moderate-lively carbonation. This was not a pleasant experience, and I would definitely not recommend this to anybody. There are better malt liquors out there. Nothing more to this than a cheap, quick buzz."
"This beer is simply awful. The taste of mouldy vegtables dominated this lager. Spit the beer back into the glass, and sewered the remainder. Gotta have a talk with my Dad. He was only a few miles from Vermont, yet he got me this crap."
"The can states this is a lager, but this one screams malt liquor to me."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- If Im w/ my wino friends under the viaduct while living in a cardboard box...maybe..."
"It will be at least 5 more years before I have this again."
"Gold color  white thin head  corn, rice, melon nose - cereal , over sweetened yeast  medium body  aftertaste slightly dry and sweet (garbage but for the bang for buck not horrible, I have had worst)Gold color  white thin head  corn, rice, melon nose - cereal , over sweetened yeast  medium body  aftertaste slightly dry and sweet (garbage but for the bang for buck not horrible, I have had worst)"
"This beer poured a light golden color with minimal head and lacing. The appearance of the beer was probably it's best quality. The smell was not impressive; heavily of malt and alcohol. The taste is not very good, and the high alcohol overpowers everything. Leaves the mouth feeling like you were drinking whiskey, and overall is not a drinkable beer due to the high alcohol and total lack of hop character. Only drink if desperate."
"D: So it's not the best tasting thing in the world, but it accompishs (fuck it I'm not going to spell check) it's task of getting me drunk. In fact, I even wish I had another, though that might be overkill, and I'd awake sitting in the chair at the computer without acually hitting the review button staring at the cans of 211 wondering... what the...? Woo!!!!"
"So you are down to your last few dollars, have a motel room and a girl who would be willing if she were..'convinced'. Steel Reserve High Gravity Lager to the Rescue. Don't drink this shit unless you are nearly broke and need a quick buzz. Poured into a red s.o.l.o. party cup, as it isn't worth the effort of washing glasses later on. Head: Looks to be the sort of color consistency one would find when buying a chocolate shake at mcdonalds where the chocolate syrup isn't mixed into the vanilla ice cream well. Smells like a wino. Tastes like my alcoholic ex-girlfriend's mouth first thing in the morning after 10 straight booze-soaked hours. Mouthfeel: The alcohol/poison numbed my senses and I really couldn't feel anything. Drinkability: When your bonfire/pig-roast is out of budweiser's and granpa's supply 'o' moonshine is running low, steel reserve is a reasonable option. Just be careful. Some nimrod is gonna think he can handle as many of these as he can of michelob light only to discover the gravitational properties of the magical porcelain water vortex."
"Overall I will never have this ever again...the lack of bitterness gives me a stomach ache."
"D - What do you expect? This is a beer designed to get you drunk. That is it's very purpose and reason to exist. The flavor is not supposed to matter. Still, compared to other malt liquors, this doesn't seem so bad. I'd go with the can though, I am sure this would be unbearable were it to come from a clear bottle. Who knows? I might have this again if I am drinking objectively."
"I find it hard to believe that I actually drank a few of these back in the day. Hard liquor in a can, and the only thing this beer has going for it, is that it's low priced for high abv. Be careful as your stomach and liver may not be able to handle these."
"($1.49 / 24 oz. tall aluminum can)"
"This was acceptable for 99 cents though."
"Mouthfeel is sticky from the sugars but sharp from the adequate carbonation."
"After a few swigs the feel of the alcohol goes away completely and all one tastes is the sour apple sweet malt. At $1.29, this runs about average to other ML's in the area, but with it's much better than average taste and definite higher alcohol, it gets the job done in a much more palatable way than good 'ole Old English 800 or King Cobra."
"Aroma contains alcohol, mild citrus , malty layers of 2 row malt with corn and rice adjunct sweetness a nice mix for a high grav malt liquor. Taste is very alcoholic sweetness with creamy textured tones of malt corn and rice very tasty even after a full flight of tasting malt liquors. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied slightly sticky with candy coated layers of malts. Drinkability...something I would definitely return to in a bind not something I'm a huge fan of on the regular."
"""bang for your buck"" affair. cheapness is only redeeming quality. terrible but has a high abv percentage."
"This is not a stellar alcohol choice. Thin foam that you could maybe call a head, disipated witin 20 seconds. No lacing to speak of. Alcohol and rice are prevalent in the taste, a little hop and a lot of alcohol in the smell. (Think frat lounge.) Watery, low viscosity gives it a decent mouthfeel but all that is ruined by the awful taste it leaves behind. I would have rated it lower but I think that it is right on for the American Malt Liquor category. Drinkable if you are planning to get drunk, and the $4.50 price tag for a twelve pack @ 6.0%ABV makes it a frat boy's dream."
"Let's cut to the chase, if you are looking for an inexpensive buzz this is it. Cheap, (really cheap.. I just paid under $7 for a twelve pk).. does not taste like rotten sweet potatoes and will definitely give you a two beer buzz with over twice the punch of bud or miller lite. But if you normally have to drink 8 + beers to feel good I would say, be careful, I can predict a really bad morning after on more than 4 of these."
"Nice thick head for a while, but I messed it up so what are you gonna do. A pale orange similar to helles lager. Strong corn smell. This is husky, dawg. The taste though... what a taste! It's hard to give ""american malt liquor"" a flavor but this is what I get.. except this is done especially well. I get kind of a vanilla aftertaste after a strong corn syrup body. I also notice cloves and some banana flavoring. The first malt liquor hefe? NAW dawg. A little syrupy in the mouth, but I'll be damned if I couldn't drink this all day, everyday. Maybe I do. This thing isn't too sweet. It is definitely a different beast."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied with a clean finish. T'he carbonation makes this beer more drinkable. Strangely enough this is one very easy drinking beer. I wouldnt classify this as a beer treat by any measure. This is definately a beer I will repeat for cheap beer drinks."
"Well I finally broke down and bought this for $1.99. Pours a light gold color. Smells sickly sweet but not overpowering. Taste is like fermented corn syrup, slightly grainy but mostly just corn syrup. Mouthfeel is whatever. Drinkability? Well better than the cherry wheat a while ago. It's good for a buzz, but for overall enjoyability, you can do better."
"Highly drinkable, refreshing, good beer. No, it's not what a ""sophisticated"" pallate wants. I would not compare this to any ""good"" beer, but that's the point. Prole beer for cheep bastards. Wonderful!"
"I picked up a can of this stuff while traveling through VA, mainly because for some reason it's not available in NC and I wanted to review it. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It poured a light amber color with a half inch head that went away quickly. Aroma was sweet and malty with just a hint of corn/vegetable in the nose. Taste was fruity sweet, citrusy and lemony with a light hop bitterness. I could also taste a slight grainy taste in the finish. Alcohol was noticeable but not too strong. This was a medium bodied beer and had a lot more flavor than any malt liquor I have ever had. Not a bad deal for a $1.00 24 oz can."
"Another competitor in our Malt Liquorpalooza 2006 competition. This one beat out Lucky Number 7 11 in the first round but then faced off with Olde English and went down in a unanimous vote. Mostly the take home message with Steel reserve is that you're gonna get punched in the face with beer and its not going to feel good but its gonna knock you out. Too sweet and corny for me. definitely feel the alcohol diffusing into my mouth and tongue. a lot of bang for your buck but not a tasty treat."
"The can says extra malted barley and select hops for extra gravity. Pours a pale yellow with a thick white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Smell is a bit fruity. Lots of adjunct in the taste, some alcohol too. Thankfully not painfully sweet in the aftertaste, kind of dry actually. Pretty drinkable for a malt liquor."
"pours out of the 24oz can a dark golden colour with a relatively frothy egg shell white head. lots of lace. fruity and grainy in the nose...so far so good. pretty sweet stuff here....sugary slickness slides right down my throat. alcohol spiciness hits the tastebuds and then warms the belly. pretty much a high gravity buzz maker that is intended to get to the point quickly and cheaply. smooth mouthfeel on top of a big slick mouthfeel makes this poundable, but i think i'd only want one. there are better malt liquors out there."
"It is what it is, a damn fine malt liquor. Probably the most drinkable I've had to date, even as it got warm I didn't get that schwill spit laden crap like some other malts."
"Appearance is a golden color. Head goes away INSTANTLY. I was terrified after this. (that's the glass part.) Smell is just unpleasant - not terrible but not good at all. Taste is a corn sweet and bitter thing going on. The quicker you drink it the better flavor. It is a bit tasty. You have to be with friends to enjoy it really. It's fun. The mouthfeel is slimy and thick. That's kinda gross. Drinkability is definitley poor because the carbonation is so filling it really sits on your stomach well. It may have something to do with the 'high gravity.'"
""
"I reviewed this on memory[but after 2 many.it may be a bit cloudy] 1.Str8 from the 40.oz It tastes a hell of a lot better than it smells,Pure and simple this is the beer for getting lit up like christmas time in both the cheapest and quickest way possible."
"Overall Impression: A bit firm in the alcohol taste and a bit too sweet for my tastes. I believe the sweet is trying to hide the alcohol. As a malt liquor, its not bad at all. All part of Pegasus's world karma whore tour. Wheee!"
"poured a very pale amber color with large white head that was able to revived with mild swirling. Smell is minimal with only a slight sweetness. Taste is very mild, but still gives a good creamy mouthfeel. I detect virtually no alcohol except for a bit of burn in the aftertaste. The drinkability is truly scary, as I feel I could drink a lot of this beer without realizing what I was getting into. I can see my malt liquors get such a bad rap."
"This brew pours a clear pale straw color white no head. The aroma is sweet with some grassy notes underneath. The taste is very low key, and inoffensive. Well, inoffensive if you are looking for almost nothing in the flavor. If you are looking for something, it could be deemed very offensive. It does do a good job at hiding the alcohol content. Although, I don't know how, as it is certainly not being hidden by the flavor. The mouthfeel is thin with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this isn't horrible, but it isn't good either."
"For malt liquor, it's not bad. I've never had a period of time where I drank 40's on any regular basis, but I've had my share. I still prefer Private Stock or Elephant from Denmark, if that counts, but this isn't bad. I'd rather just have a couple bottles of regular strength beer and save myself the headache, literally. I don't know what it is about malt liquor, but I always get a headache from it."
"I won't buy this, well, ever, but it isn't bad for free and I can imagine that with spicy food it might be a good palate cleanser. Basically tastes like alcoholic water."
"Wow. If you guys are rating this in regards to style you are full of shite. Malt liquor is supposed to be awful! This is only almost awful! This pours a nice golden orange color with a small fizzy head. The smell is malty and appley. As someone mentioned below it tastes similar to a cider making it very easy to drink. Mouthfeel is moderate and slick. Compared to all malt liqours this is the king by far. The alcohol is there though so be carefully. Holy shit the last sip was not so happy. The more you drink the more astringent it tastes. It doesn't matter if you are drunk or not."
"This is what homeless people drink when they're out of money. Aged for at least 28 days, it says on the can. So it's just as good as period juice. Tastes a little better. Not much. Avoid."
"Steel Reserve 211 (High Gravity) is the clear winner of Malt Likkapalooza III, the most lopsided competition yet. Its uncompromising nature won't be to everyone's liking, but if you're going to brew a malt liquor then, dammit, brew a malt liquor that you can be proud of. When it comes to beer of this style, erring on the side of 'too much' is infinitely preferable to erring on the side of 'too little'. Therein lies the difference between these beers and the difference between their scores."
"It's 3 sips later and I'm pouring the rest of it out for my homies. Probably the least drinkable beer I've had since Rainier."
"Steel Reserve 211 HGL is in my humble opinion, one of the better High Gravity Lagers. Drink in respect of its 8.1% alcohol by volume, or a few cans of this stuff will set you on... your can."
"The best malt liquor at this alcoholic strength, I'd say."
"Is it drinkable? Sure. Ill finish the whole big-ass can. BTW, I really like all the wording and shit on the can, eye-catching and classy. I guess the next time I have the hankering for a High Life or a Northwoods Lager I might just grab this cheapy instead. Like I said, I purchased it in Omaha. Try one if you want to know what a good ML tastes like."
"Overall, I think this is an excellent beer for anyone on a budget. It's about 5 dollars a 12 pack. If you want to get messed up, and do it cheap, 211 is your best friend."
"This beer tastes a lot like Lake Michigan tastes in Milwaukee after a tremendous rain storm."
"A friend brought this over. Lets give it a whirl. It pours a solid golden straw color with a 2 finger head that falls to a light coating over top. The nose is big in adjunct sweetness with that distinctive malt liquor aroma. Not sure what it is. The flavor is very sweet and corn-like. The offensive flavor I associate with malt liquor comes through. No real alcohol is in the flavor, but it hits in the warming stomach feel. The feel is moderate with a light carbonation. Overall, I think it is drinable. The flavor is not very inviting, but it is what I expect in a malt liquor."
"Opinion: Well, thank you all the same Mr. Beer Rep, but I don't think that I am going to finish this beer. I hate to waste it, but I would rather save my liver for something that tastes good. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it."
"Pours golden with a fast dissapearing white head. No lacing to speak of. The smell and taste of esters are overpowering. This is probably due to it's high gravity brewing technique. The taste, and low carbonation make this a harsh beer to swallow, but then again this beer's style is simply aimed to get you drunk fast. And at 8.1 % ABV, a 24oz. can is a good buy at 99 cents."
"I've arrested several transients (PC term for bum) who have been drinking this so I'd figured i'd give it a try. I bought the prefered method of consumption (big ass can), took it home, opened it, and poured it into my only beer glass. Looked just like every other mass produced american macro brew. Thewre wasn't much head and what little it had died quickly- (Shocking cause when you pour it on the ground it stays for awhile) The smell? Just like I was at work. (i will always relate the smell to disorderly drunks). I tried it and it reminded me of Bud or miller genuine draft which is good if you like those, maybe a tad harsher. For me, however, the taste was so bad I was unable to finish it but since I paid so little for it, I figured we were even. All I can say about this beer is that I imagine it will get you plowed, and quickly. also, If I were a panhandler , this would be my brew of choice (since its cheaper than natural ice)"
"I was intimidated by this somewhat, as I'm not a huge fan of Silver 211, but as soon as I opened this one I knew it was going to be a much better experience. Solid crack, good ""beery"" smell. Black 211 hides the alcohol *MUCH* better than its silver counterpart. This tasted less like an HG 40, and more like a regular malt. I felt cracked out, frayed the next day but it could have been the mere 5 hours of sleep I got after chugging this monster. Regardless, there's no denying that some strange, cheap, shitty beer resides in every bottle of 211 Black. All around, I'd drink it again in a heartbeat if I was wanting an HG. Check!"
"I'm typing slow because I've upset my stomach drinking this swill. It's starts off a dark orangey yellow, the color of an oxidated used highlighter. The foamy head disappeared within seconds. Smell was sweet and alcohol with a good bit of corn mixed in. Taste was sweet corn with abrasive alcohol finishing it up. Some alcohol flavor is nice, as in an old ale, but this was truly sickly sweet. Mouthfeel was like a macro lager, not much there but with no crispness it was intolerable. This is not drinkable unless you have damaged your taste buds and you have a cast iron stomach. Avoid."
"overall i would probably say this is the best malt liquor i have had. not good though, but if you need a beer to just get drunk with at a cheap price, i would say this is a good one, since it is 6.0%."
"The only reason to drink this is to get buzzed."
"..and that does in my drinkability score. I couldn't drink this. When I switched back to PBR it made PBR taste way different, I needed a GREAT beer to recover but had none, so water will do."
"Goes down well when cold, but forget about it if it warms up even a little. If I want cheap Malt Liquor, OE 800 is the best I've tried so far and even that isn't good."
"Just to be authentic, I actually started off drinking this one out of the can, but my beer geek side got the best of me and I poured the last 15 oz. of it into a glass. The body is actually a quite attractive pale gold that turns amber when the glass passes in from of any solid background. The head is big bubbled and short-lived, as the fat bubbles fizz away until there's no head at all after a couple of seconds. The bubbles rising from the sides of the glass are abnormally large. The head counteracts the relatively attractive body color, though. The aroma actually has a bit of peppery hops up front. I find no trace of malt however. The flavor lacks bitterness but picks up a toasted cornmeal/cornhusk quality that reminds me of the cornmeal coating of a tamale. It really let me down. For my first malt liquor I was expecting all sorts of nastiness, but this is fairly drinkable other than an artificially short finish that turns into a distinct dryness that I didn't like."
"Poured from a 24 FL. OZ. can. It is the typical dark urine color that most malt liquors have. It may look average, but for a malt liquor it's not bad at all. It has a clean, sweet, corny aroma and the flavor is similar, but it is not bad considering what it is. Sure the other beers in my refrigerator are better, but they are also not malt liquor. If I want a decent, cheap, quick beer drunk, I will be looking for some Steel Reserve."
"This is truly the best malt liquor I've ever had. While this is still relatively cheaply made, I don't feel overpowered with sickly sweetness nor do I taste too many adjuncts. Appearance is dark yellow, almost super-light amber. Head is big and forthy. Smell is generically sweet, though the aroma here is more natural than most malt liquors. Taste is very sweet, but doesn't go overboard. Usually I get sick of malt liquor sweetness quickly, but Steel Reserve has prolonged drinkability. The 8.1% ABV is only noticed in the warm feeling in my throat. Out of the five or six malt liquors that I've had this one is the best, I could see buying this with intentions other that getting trashed."
"Mouthfeel is medium with the carbonation keeping it crisp but overall deceptive. Looks like a thin gulping lager but should be consumed as a tripel. Aftertaste is dry but clean, not horrible at all, even for a ripper."
"I was curious enough to go to the breweries' website where this consumers comment caught my eye and I quote, ""Greatest beer in the world, at any price."" Need I say more???"
"I had a Warsteiner Pils right next to this to help me compare it, because frankly when I've had this beer before its struck me as better than I expected. And, while Warsteiner isn't a 5.0 its a decent import. So...The Steel poured with a nice orange-golden hue, actually darker than the Warsteiner, and had an off-white head which was also interesting contrasted to the expected blinding white that you often see. The aroma has that kind of galvanized steel / vegetable smell that you get a lot in adjunct beers - no real maltiness or hops to speak off. The flavor is dominated by the corn sweetness but you also get some malt behind it and a slight amount of hops, but not enough to balance. This beer would be much better if it had about 10 more IBUs I bet. Anyway, its probably my best choice at the convenience store near my in-laws in Virginia, and its better than no beer at all."
"The appearance isn't too bad, as a matter of fact, it has a little more colour than most malt liquers out there. The aroma was alcoholic and corny. nothing too appitising. The taste is absolutely horrid. Kind of sour. I don't recall ever having anything that was so sour before. I finished it to be nice, but I don't see myself downing one of these any time soon."
"Another ""high gravity lager"". Should this become a new BA style? This beer is the same as the others. Lots of corn and lots of sugar, combined to make a malty drink that is meant to get you plowed. Another great way to cause accidents among college freshmen. Tastes like strong American Beer."
"PS: There are four lonely reviews stranded in a separate listing for this beer. Bottle or can, it's the same brew."
"I decided to compare this by pouring a glass of Miller Light as well. This taste test really displays the extra malt and lack of complexity. This will be my last time I try this lager."
"Overall a nice bang for your buck and a considerable go to beer if slumming."
"Honestly, not bad overall, and better than other malt liquors I've had in the past."
"It's the best beer on the market to ""get the job done"" at $2 for two ""tall boys""."
"Drinkability - this beer is not designed for sipping, yet at 8.1%, it's a train wreck in the making. Proceed to a 2nd can with caution, to 3 and beyond at your own peril."
"This is the best malt liquor I have had. It still has that indistinguishable flavor: lager beer mixed with lots of sugar and cheap vodka. Then there is the ever present can taste. This is a beer you try to drink quick because you don't want that bad alcohol taste to sneek up on you. This beer sure does get you bent...and quick if you drink it like you should...quickly. Much better than Camo, Mickey's and several of the others. For the price, you really can't beat it. And anybody who pours this beer into a glass is an idiot. It doesn't deserve that treatment."
"A big silver can...clear medium gold appearance, very little head or lace in a pint glass. Aroma is of Apple Jacks -- artificial cinnamon and lots of confectioner's sugar, some alcohol fusels rise up the back. Mouthfeel is a little fizzy (not good at the swallow), but this is what balances the syrupy sense of malt, again, almost like a kid's breakfast cereal in overall impression. If there was any sense of hopping to this brew, I might actually drink it again, but as is, its too sweet, monolithic, and not nearly memorable enough -- category or not."
"Drinkability: I could drink a lot of this. Best malt liquor I've had. Reminds me of my days at A-B, tasting the high gravity Bud Light before we'd dilute it down in the Finishing Cellar. Good stuff"
"For 1.29 this is a very worth while beer for a hot summer day, though the alcohol notes are invisible."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light, yet dry pale malt scent with a lager yeast finish. It's not very complex, but it seems to be refreshing. The taste is average as well. It has a very sweet and thick malty flavor with a warm finish. It goes down slow and finishes dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent strong lager. It is going to kick my ass for sure. It 's one and done for me."
"24 ounce can...a master cylinder. Date on bottom is steciled code 11014E70215. Purchased at Kroger in Blacksburg, VA. The can front says Fort Worth, but the side says Milwaukee, WI."
"Bought in the 22 oz clear bottle for the grand price of 95 cents! I poured this into a glass ( i know its a no-no for ML afficienados!) Its actually quite nice looking foir a Malt liquor..darker gold than the usual and witha small white head. Very malt, dough aroma..not bad..not nasty at all. Very smooth semi-sweet tasting beer..very malty, small alcoholic kick at the back of the mouth..warms the belly afterwards. Nice enough beer for the style. I actually like this."
"Steel Reserve, man has this stuff has lead to some great memories. Not as bad as some of the High Gravity lagers out there (CAMO & OE 800 to name a few). Only drink it ice cold, as it becomes increasingly undrinkable as it warms. Not a beer I'de buy everyday, but when you wanna get toasted for cheap, or have a game of Edward Fourty-hands to play, this is the brew for you."
"I would say this beer is one of the better ones in its class. Is this on the par of a Helles, NO. But it is a damn good brew to pick up and have a nice LONG cold one."
"Poured from a 24 ounce can purchased at a creepy gas station. The color is yellowish gold, with a fizzy white head that descends rapidly, leaving no lace. Smell: pungent, musty notes of dead grass, distant chewed bubble-gum sweetness, pool water. Taste: opens with a kool-aid sweetness, grassy bitterness cracks through the middle -- the alcohol busts in on its heals, clumsily. The finish is all up-front alcohol heat, a very slight background of sweetness. Mouthfeel: syrupy water, middling carbonation. Hey, it could taste a lot worse. At least there are some layers of character, instead of a one dimensional disgustingness."
"oh man, the 211. you dont need to pour it out, you can see what it looks like, orange tinted death. the smell is sickly sweet and alcoholic. the flavor follows suit, generic corny beer flavor, high alcohol all over, sweet and nasty. but at the same time, palatable! this is a 4-0 to reckon with and has more than once put me down for the count. not the worst (cough::camo::cough) but certainly slumin."
"i found this drink in college, since a four pack of this was always priced at $4.19 at the local beer mart. never had a chance to admire the appearance of the beer since i opened up the can and drank it straight from it. the smell is average, nothing unusual. given the high alcohol content, the taste can be hoppy, though the aftertaste is a bit strong. as for the drinkability, do not try to pound down a four pack of Steel Reserve. your body will thank you in its unique manner."
"Drinkability  Was it drinkable? Well, it was borderline. I managed to get about a third of the way through the can when my wife called out from the kitchen, Do you want half of this Ruination? I couldnt dump it down the sink fast enough."
"Drinkable? I can swallow it, but really it's not good."
"The Steel Reserve HG malt liqour comes in a 22oz clear bottle with the silver label. Pours a dark yellow, sap color. The smell isn't to bad for a malt liqour but still doesn't compare to other beers, a hint of poultry always arrives when I smell malt liqour. That aside the SR HG is the best malt liqour out there, I usually find the higher the alcohol volume in malt liqour the worst the taste, not so with this. It has the highest alcohol volume and tastes the best. The taste has a hint of hops and more like a heavy carbonated beer. You can pop a few of these on a hot day."
"This might go well with some stronger-spiced foods, maybe wings or something. But without something to offset its off-flavors, I wouldn't recommend it."
"Clear gold color with a white head. I drank it straight from the 40 oz. bottle (my friend bought a 24 oz. can and dumped it down the drain). I finished mine, for sake of reviewing. Had a skunky corn smell that matched nicely with it's offensive skunk flavor. As 40's go, this is average. I still won't miss the lack of local availability."
"Why would anyone drink this? Indeed, why did I? Thanks to buddy Kevin, who decided we needed to inflict this monstrosity on ourselves in the interest of greater beer enlightenment. Color and aroma - bah, lets cut to the chase. The flavor was bad, so bad that you do the thing where you hold a mouthfull out of contact with your tongue as much as possible, and then choke it down quickly, with the ""bad-beer-post-swallow-facial-contortion"" following. This thing must be brewed with an all-corn mash. The finish is combination of raw alcohol and sickly sweet bitterness. There are some good cheap beers out there, but with this 99 cent 40 oz., you get what you pay for."
"Pretty damn bad, and probably the worst malt liquor I've ever had -- and that's if you consider malt liquors deserving of a hierarchy."
"Lets start by saying that this is by far the best of the bunch but thats not saying much....tastes similar to OE but you can notice the alc volume a lot more. I guess it is good if you are down to your last pocket change and just want to get fu*ked up....you cant be the price (.99-1.50)"
"As an unemployed recent college graduate, I am a connoiseur of cheap beers. Having sifted through my fair share of Milwaukee's ""Best", Shlitz, Schaefers, etc, I was pleasently surprised to find Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity at my local Kroger. This beer was not only cheap, but it tasted better than my roommate's top expensive pick, Budweiser. At 6% alcohol, cheap beers tend to have a certain funk to them. Steel Reserve maintained a ""beerish"" taste without being overly sweet, overly bitter, or overly funky. It also did not have that alcohol taste that Malt Liquor has. This is my new first choice for poker night."
"Another beer for those trying to get drunk. Impressively high alcohol content, and impressively low everything else. Terrible, terrible, TERRIBLE beer."
"I personally love Steel Reserve. This is the stuff that got me into actually liking Malt Liquor. I don't have much of a problem with the 211 at all, it tastes great, has a decent smell, and the mouthfeel is bar none better than most Malt Liquors. I would rank this up there as probably one of the better Malt Liquors around."
"Steel Reserve is the ultimate in malt liquer's. If you want to get messed up real bad and real quick, take one or two of these 24's down and you'll be feeling good! This is definantly a drink to be consumed when ice cold, otherwise suffer the concequences. Like a previous reviewer said, when it warms up it does taste kind of like a rum and coke, only a stale one! I had a couple of these before my math class last semester and let's just say I did not learn much on that day! Anyways, I'd take a Mickey's over this any day but if you wanna get fucked up real quick, this is the ticket"
"Pours a clear yellow with a thin white head, which diminishes to nothing very quickly. The aroma is not particularly good, and has a grainy almost corn like character. The taste is not good, very grainy, with a strong unpleasant aftertaste. Becomes increasingly more unpleasant tasting as it warmsif you can drink it while its still cold, its not too bad. A bit rough feeling and not particularly drinkable. A rather low quality beer and certainly not something I would intentionally have again (although for some strange reason I know I will finish what is left of the 6 pack--which I guess bumps up the drinkability)."
"This is another extremely cheap beer. It's yellowish in color and doesn't have a lot of aroma nor head. The abv is very high but it is not very tasty. Slightly bitter but drinkable for the abv and the price. Not great, but it gets you drunk cheap. Pretty crappy."
"Ah, the memories. Beginning college freshman year and drinking steel reserve basically every night with my soccer teammates. This one really helped me build a nice alcohol tolerance. I go back to it time and again when the money's low and I want to get wasted. Looks like urine with basically no head. Smell is nonexistent in my opinion. Taste is quite nice in style comparison when this one's cold. A little on the sweet side with some grassy adjuncts noticed. Alchohol is strong and gives this beer a kick. Gets worse and worse the more it warms, so drink it quickly."
"This brew poured a medium white head of small bubbles. It has a transparent golden body with carbonation and a hoppy aroma. It's hoppy taste was smooth with a bit of tang to the aftertaste. It is an easy to drink beer that you can still taste the alcohol in."
"If you don't mind the buzz (or are looking for it) buy this beer."
"This brew poured a medium white somewhat creamy head that dissolved rather quickly. There was virtually no lacing on the sides of my glass. It had a sweet aroma to it. The carbonation could be seen rising to the top. I was not impressed by this brew at all."
"Wow, and wow again. This malt lager pours a bright golden color, slight carbonation, a rapidly disolving head, the aroma is aweful, mainly of dishsoap, enough to sniff only once. Off the bat, a sweet and malty taste, a tad carbonated, and, yes slightly creamy. Some alcohol can be noted, and a nice feel on the palate, similar to a decent lager. Let's not get carried away, but in the category of cheap, let's get drunk fast, for 95 cents per 24 ounces, this is a good malt beverage."
"It poured a clear, golden color with creamy white foam that dissipated relatively quickly. There was very little bubbling action. The smell was very modest, and I had to try hard to get a small whiff of malt. The taste was thin, a bit sweet and malty, with almost no hop presence except a trace in the finish. Their was a hint of alcohol in the flavor. The mouthfeel was thin, but crisp and clean. The body was light and the carbonation feel was medium-light. There was a slightly sweet lingering flavor. The drinkability was OK. I will not make a habit of drinking this one, but if I am somewhere and nothing better is available, I will drink another."
"This beer pours a clear yellow/gold color with a dissipating moderate white head. The mouthfeel is as expected-thin. The smell is sweet and cereal like with a slight sourness. The taste is a nearly overwhelming sweetness with a strong alcohol finish. This is a very sweet high alcohol mass produced under whelming beer."
"Pours a brassy golden color, quite clear, with a small white head that soon fades to scattered islands of foam. Carbonation is lively; the lacing is fair. The aroma is dominated by pungent sweet alcohol, light maltiness, and juicy berry notes. Tasting yields slightly rough carbonation, sweet light malt, quite pronounced alcohol flavors, and towards the finish, mildly bitter medicinal hops. The alcohol is quite warming, almost like a shot of liquor; the mouth feel is pleasant. This beer proves that malt liqour can aspire to the same lofty heights as other styles of beer. At ninety-nine cents for a 24 ounce can (Centennial Liquors, Austin, TX), this seems like a great value for the money."
"This is by far the best Malt Liquor I've ever had. I had heard some sketchy things about it around RU, so I was reluctant to try it. But I figured if they like Natty, and they didn't like this, then it must be rather heavy tasteing. Well, I must say, it's not too heavy, but it's a far cry from anything light. The color was a very nice golden yellow, with a foamy white head to it. The head died out quickly and left a lace. The taste starts out light, but opens up quickly on the alcohol. You can still feel the tingleing of the alcohol after a while. Coats your mouth and makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. Definately my go to, now that I am broke. It's a cheap $1 for a 22oz, but I may have to spring the extra $.75 for the 40oz. Drink on my brotheren."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow-gold with a densely creamy bright-white head that holds surprisingly well. It eventually drops, but keeps a thin surface covering and leaves some minor lace. The nose expresses a sweet malt with some clear alcohol and a touch of fruitiness, but otherwise it's quite clean. It's full bodied with a fine carbonation that's lightly effervescent and gently caresses the tongue. Crisp yet smooth. The flavor offers clean, sweet adjunct-laden malt with a clear note of alcohol and an underlying bitterness. It finishes drying with some lingering sweet malt. It's cleaner than many malt liquors (and may be fermented a bit cooler), but other than that there's not much going on here. Still, it's not a bad choice within the style."
"Buddy brought this to work. Lots of malt, aweful taste. This is the beer you need if you want to get hammered. This is beyond bad, but that buzz kicked in after the second sip. The paper cup I was drinking it with had more flavor. I feel like gargelling with turpintine to get the taste out of my mouth."
"Pours a clear yellow with some white head, a very little.  I can't see the difference between a beer like this and any other macro beer.  It has a higher alcohol content, but it is still the same rice/sugar adjunct flavor.  I might even smell a little bit of malt.  I tried it out of curiousity, and for 99 cents/24 oz can, I guess it has its own time and place."
"this was a rough one. ghetto juice almost too bad to handle. malt beyond belief and a just nasty taste in general. then again, what is the purpose of a malt liquor. thick and sweet, yet skunky. mouthfeel is hard to even recognize while battling the taste. i think this one makes other malt liquors look like top notch craft brews."
"Clear, light golden in color. Minimal head and little lace. Heavily carbonated.  Somewhat sweet tasting with strong alcohol taste.  Medium bodied with mouth coating mouthfeel. Finishes sweetly alcoholic."
"Oh the Steel...truly high gravity...it will push you down until you hit the floor. It has quite a high kick at 8.1%, but when had cold is very drinkable. I remember that one night I quickly pounded two Steel 40's...oh wait, no I dont remember that night. That's the power of the Steel."
"I know that the alcohol per dollar ratio is great, but avoid this like the plague.  Even among malt liquors, Steel Reserve is one of the worst beverages out there.  It tastes like gasoline and will rip your stomach in two.  Drink a Liquid Plumber and ammonia cocktail before you drink Steel Reserve.  For the love of God stay the hell away!"
"Its been a long time since I've sampled malt liquor, but I decided to pick up a 40 O.Z. of somthing and dive right in. I decided on Steel Reserve 211 and yes, I drank it straight from the bottle. At 8.1%, I was feelin' the alcohol about halfway down the bottle. This stuff smells slightly skunky, but I couldn't tell if it was because of the of the clear bottle or because its SUPPOSED to be that way. This tastes slightly sweet, rather light and finishes up with a swallow that lets you know this thing has alcohol in it. Was it good? No. Was it bad? Yeah, it was bad. But I had a buzz going after drinking it and I must say, I have had alot worse, both macro and micro-wise. Peace out, time to wash the hoopty and catch some NCAA b-ball."
"Notes: One of the most drinkable malt liquors I have tasted, one of the more alcoholic ones I have run into also. Even when it warms up a bit it does not get ghastly like other malt liquors do."
