"Tastes more like that pre mixed soda syrup than alcohol.  Neon orange with absolutely no head at all. Smell matches the taste. Very syrupy and sticky in the mouth. Will need to brush teeth as soon as you finish to get the feeling out of your mouth."
""
"Pours out with no head retention, bright orange in color. Smells like sweet mango candy, taste just like the smell. Mouthfeel is syrupy light carb. Overall it's whatever."

"Looks great, like all their flavored beer they over did the flavor. It is drinkable but would be better mixed with other beer."

"fave of the rita line (so far). great mango taste. good with some pineapple and Sprite to make a quick drink."

"Overall: Just make your own margaritas."

"Overall (2.13) : So far only the second worst in the four o'rita's I've tried. The best one is Raspberry, then Strawberry, then Mango, and worst of all is the original Lime. They managed to not screw this one up too bad, and now that I've got a taste of about 2 oz, I will drain the rest. Good for a review, little else."

"This beer alone taste like a mango flavored jolly rancher candy...it's too sweet and gives me a headache after just one. However, the alcohol content is at 8%, which is pretty high for a beer. I use this beer to turn dry wines into a sweet bubbly -  for this reason alone, I give it a 3.0."

"Mang-o-Rita pours an orange color with absolutely no head.  There is a crazy sweet aroma, very sugary, some mango juice like flavors.  The taste is very fizzy, very very sweet and sugary, some slight artificial flavors.  Too fizzy, bad feel.  Overall, very sweet, artificial mango flavors, not very good."

"Overall: at first, it might have ranked with the Raz-Ber-Rita. After a few sips, though, its high sweetness and lack of tartness make this thing kind of hard to drink."
""
"Overall: terrible, way to sweet to drink"
""
"Unlike the other Bud Light Lime ""Rita"" drinks, this one seems a little bit too sweet. It's just too full of mango flavor and sugary sweetness, and without any tartness to balance it. On the label it suggest that you try mixing it with ice, and I'd agree as that might help to water it down a bit. On the other hand, it does taste completely of mango, and if that's what you're looking for this does the trick. I can't recommend it as a beer, nor can I really recommend it as a malternative either, but to everything its own place and season."

"It seemed more like a strong wine cooler than anything."
"Pours a bright orange color with little foam. Smells mostly of artificial fruit and alcohol. Taste was extremely sweet with only artificial flavors coming though. Wasn't a fan."

"My brother wanted some Bud Light from a nearby 7-Eleven, I wanted something, this one was one of the very few new-to-me things, so...yeah. This stuff pours a partly-hazy Ecto Cooler (seriously, throughout my entire childhood, I thought the Cooler was a bright green inside of those cardboard boxes...alas, my wrongness...) topped by a half-finger at best of some incredibly transitory dirty khaki bubble mist. The nose is dominated by sweet mango syrup, though I think I get some lime juice somewhere in there as well (could just be wishful thinking). The taste mostly confirms the mango domination, but now there undoubtedly is a small bite of tart-ish lime in the background. Honestly, this ain't half bad, so long as you like these flavors in a heavily sweet context. The body is a light medium, with a fizzy carbonation and a rather soda-like feel. Overall, not the best beer in the world by far, but something not all that bad for a straight alcohol-delivery service."

"Once more, I got a loud Crack!, but given that there was going to be 25 (!) fl. oz. of it, the Glug would not be inverted. This time, it was Orange soda pop! I would find it laughable if A-B/InBev was not marketing this malt beverage as something to be taken seriously. Any head that was produced quickly fizzled out and simply sparkled like pop. Color was a slightly-hazy neon orange (SRM = N/A), more like glowing nuclear waste. On another topic, is mango the new black? It seems to be appearing in a LOT of beers lately, but I CAN only hope that papaya is not far behind. Nose smelled sort of like mango, but in a CANdy-like way, not a natural scent. Mouthfeel was thin and watery, but with lots of fizzy carbonation, reinforcing the whole soda pop analogy. Gad, but this was really sweet, much more that the previous two Ritas, which had some tartness to them. I closed my eyes and swore that I was drinking pop! This was not going to be on my hit parade, lemme tell ya! Finish was cloying and sweet as all get-out. Ugh. I have my annual physical tomorrow and I hope this does not give me diabetes."
"O: The mango flavors completely obscure the taste of the underlying beer, but when you consider that this is Bud Light, this might not necessarily be considered a bad thing. It's definitely a lot more drinkable compared to other beers in the style, especially if you drink it cold."
""
"Overall: Incredibly artificial and is nowhere even close to being beer. That said though, it's not offensive and it works for what it is."

"O: This is not unenjoyable but it tastes nothing like beer - more like a mango soda than anything else and of all of the Bud Light Lime XXX-A-Ritas, this is probably my favorite. Easy to drink on a warm afternoon evening and pairs nicely with spicy food."
""
"O - I like mangoes, so this isn't that hateful for me. I wish I would have purchased an eight ounce can instead. The sweetness is a bit overwhelming after awhile. Not to mention this in mo way resembles one of my beloved malt liquors."

"Snagged this as a what the hell because I was already ripped and it was $2.50. Not really a beer, but tasty. difficult to rate, but congrats bud, I would have no problem drinking this again which is what they are going for. But this is not a beer, as a drink it is certainly something I would have again, but not as a beer."

"If you enjoy orange soda with a splash of orange dimetapp, this is your joint. Tastes like sweet artificial orange mango soda with that woozy medicinal alcoholic note that lingers in the aftertaste. Blehhh. Fizzy and sweet, mimics orange soda all too well. Can't even taste the lime from the alleged Bud Light Lime addition. Oh well. There is noticeable cheap mango flavor here though. It's not terrible for what it is, but you'd better be drinking it on the rocks at some touristy hotel if you still want to respect yourself in the morning."
""

"Does this taste bad? Nope. Does it taste like something thrown together, late in a party, when all you have left are the potential ingredients for a mixed drink, so you make with it, and generally enjoy yourselves? Sure. On the other hand, is this beer? De ninguna manera."

"Poured from a 25 oz. can. Has an orange/golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong with mango's, lots of aroma. Taste is sweet, lots of mango, alcohol is well hidden, a refreshing change of pace. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a surprisingly good beer."
"Pours a 'orange-soda' in color with no head or lacing seen at all. The aroma is of a artificial mango/peach puree. No 'beer' smell at all either. The taste is better than the aroma but not by much. Kind of sugary and a tad bit syrupy as well. Lots of carbonation. Overall, not real impressed with this one at all though their 'Razz-O-Rita"" was better than the other few flavors I tried in this line."

"Bud Light Lime Mang-O-Rita ---3/5."
"Looks like a carbonated orange soda or Gatorade head light colored peach falls flat quick as the 8 ounce can of 8% Bud Light Lime Mang-0-Rita is poured. Aromatics like a tropical mango explosion candle very perfume like with fusel alcohol notes this is pretty crude. The last time I had a mango margarita I was in Ensenada, Mexico and I earned myself a case of Montezuma's Revenge for steering away from cerveza I assure you that AB has better quality control than the cantinas of that coastal community on the Baja peninsula. God awful sugars collide with medicinal mango tropical acid reflux in a can, this is horrible. I'm done with abuse for today, wow, the mild salty finish will put you over the top if you think your a man tango with this mang-o-rita. Mouthfeel is cloying diabetes inducing sweetness please America stop recommending new variations of the same old shit, this is bad. Overall, I'm thinking about trying the other version I saw at the gas station just for shits and giggles the day after consumption."
