"H O R R I B L E !"
"Ok let's face it. Malt liquor is not a good nor classy beer but we all remember high school. I gave this ghetto/white trash beer a high review for exactly what it is in its own league. Fuckin awesome. Looks like piss kinda smells like it with notes of dank malts grains and crackers. Taste is about the same without as much of that malt liquor funk like steel reserve which in positive is the worse thing in planet earth other than shiner Holliday chear. Come on people if you got $1.39 to spare get rocked by the hurricane"

"	Wind up flashlight? check. Matches? check. Toilet paper? check. Now all you need it some way drown your sorrows due to the fact that college students and the federal government got the day off, and you just finished swimming home from the office. Look no farther than Hurricane Premium Malt Beverage. No screaming endorsements here, but it gets the job done, and isn't that what life is all about?"

"Overall: This brew isn't awful. I have no problem killing the Forty. Bud Ice Forty though is another story. I gave this beer it's fair shake. I know what it is, sometimes I like to spend $2.50 on a single....Forty Ounce! This brew is Worth a Shot."

" it's got a kick, it's got a kick, it's got a kick, it's got a kick"
"O - I'll openly admit that I've like this stuff for a long time. I used to think it was just King Cobra in a different package but they are totally different animals. This is a malt liquor after all...inexpensive and gets the job done. Frankly I have always wondered why regular BMC drinkers don't go for this stuff since I think it tastes better than Bud or BL and packs a decent punch."

"While my rating may seem high, remember that this is malt liquor. People drink malt liquor for two reasons: it's cheap and it gets you ripped. I don't really know of any malt liquor that is truly a pleasant drink, but given price, ABV, and smoothness, Hurricane is the best malt liquor available IMO. you can still get a 40oz for under $3 in many places, and because of this, if you're looking for a cheap buzz, you can afford an extra to pour out for your homies."
"Mouthfeel is okay, as is smell. The appearance is what you'd expect, not tremendous, but not bad either."

"OVERALL: Now listed at 6% abv, this is a cheap, accessible and easy to consume beverage. It's alot more of a beer than the fruit infused lagers taking over the market these days. I'd stick with this over many of the lime or berry infused alternatives, especially when money becomes tight. You can do much worse, sadly."

"This was surprisingly easy to drink and not at all unpleasant. If you're in the mood for a 40, you could do lot worse than grabbing one of these."

"Overall its not a terrible malt liquor, it's decent for the style."

"This is an entry level malt, but a good one at that. I've you've only ever had Magnum, then you are in for a treat with this. Otherwise, it's basic. But good basic."

"Overall – Not really the best malt out there. With the price of this 40 oz at only at $2.25, what should I expect though, right?"

"I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that it is a good beer. It is medium to light in body, sweet, decent finish, mild vegetal finish, flat on the palate, it is an adult soda. Not great but something to do while your baby finally sleeps. Cheap and not great but I did drink it, probably won't bother again though."
"Drank this because what else should I drink for Hurricane Ilene in Philly? Bought a 40 at the corner store. Big clear glass bottle. Hell no I didn't use a glass. Its a 40. Bright yellow with white foam that sits on the top. Looks just like I expect a malt liquor to look. Aroma is skunky right off the bat. Clear glass does nothing positive for beer. Some grainyness and a bit of biscuit, but the skunk overwhelms. The taste is meh. Light and watery. Nothing special, but nothing too offensive either. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. Really not a bad beer. It's malt liquor. Cheap and inoffensive."
"This is one of the tougher challenges to choke down."
"Pours a nice golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is slightly sweet, grainy, and ricy. The taste is slightly sweet, grainy, with some rice notes. Light-Medium body. A nice looking macro, but not worth the money."
"Had during a Halloween party that a friend was having. Someone brought several of these along for some reason. I poured myself a glass and off I went. It was about as pointless of a beer as anything I can remember. No head, kinda smooth but no flavor. Still haven't found a good tasting 40 yet."
"10:00 Am on a Thursday. At only 1.79 just after my wife and I got into a bad fight. Seemed like the thing to do at the time. Looked a bit darker than most light lagers. They lady on the other end of the 800# assured me there was no HFCS. Smelled pretty sweet wth a little alcohol. Tasted too sweet but went down pretty easy. Could have downed anouther if I hadn't had anything else to do today. I agree with most, don't drink it unless you need a cheap buzz."
"Very pale pour, I think this might be the lightest of the malts I have tried over the last week, with the same fizzy white head that disappears almost instantly though the ever present streams of carbonation all seem to still be coming up from the bottom of the glass. Aroma is corn, alcohol, and a mess of wet hay. Just not what you want to come home to. This follows over to the flavor almost exactly as it was just all over the place, but maintained that almost day old bread like taste mixed with astringent alcohol and moldy cereal. Slick feel and just an almost gag inducing aftertaste. Just not built for this one at all."
"Dave"
"Very cheap, don't have to plug your nose to get it down, and it's pretty cheap. Do not mind gettin one of these down and it keeps my pockets thick. Call me crazy, but I'd say this is better than most shit beers. Did I mention that it's quite inexpensive."
"Presentation: Packaged in a forty ounce clear glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"M/D: mouthfeel of sparkling water, and the only reason it is drinkable is because it tastes so much like water."
"D: I wouldnt really drink this again except for memories even then I would have to ""beer pong it""."
"Seemingly par for the Malt Liquor course, I got two fingers' worth of fluffy, bone-white head that fell like they had been struck from behind. Color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was faintly fusel compared to many that I have put away on this hosed-up mission. The style is designed to knock you around on the cheap and I said as much to a fellow yesterday when he commented on my choice, stopping only when I noticed that he had some in his cart. Whoops! Mouthfeel was medium with a dryness that left me sucking for air. Wow! Finish was equally dry with a slight fusel flavor that lingered. Frankly, this was not as obnoxious as many offerings in the style."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can 10112-NB44. Sampled on June 19, 2010. Everything about this is typical for an adjunct high gravity malt liquor although not carried off as well as some. It pours pale yellow with a little thin white head that dissolves right away. While there are malt hints in the aroma, the main smell I get is metal. The mouthfeel is OK but the taste has a bit of corn and malts but the alcohol remains the most predominant ingredient."
"RJT"
"But since I am not sophisticated, I will stick with Mickey's or Olde E."
"I tend to not want to try beers of this caliber, so my rating might be skewered a bit towards the low side but what can I say, this was some pretty terrible stuff."
"D - not the worst malt liquor I can think of, but it really is more a case of worse than...? Not a bad example of the style, just not something that invites you to drink more of it"
"D - This as good as I had anticipated... not very. I can't imagine drinking an entire 40 of this. To quote Bubbles: ""You can barely get 'er in ya, but my fuck it'll get you some drunk!"""
"Go figure, ""40 oz."" isn't one of the serving type choices on the drop-down menu. Anyway, anyone who picks this up pretty much knows what they're in for. It's yellow and fizzy. The only real distinction between this and other malt liquors is that it tastes even more like old boiled corn than most and has a slightly higher alcohol content. The trade-off is obvious and people who have nothing left to live for should almost certainly grab this brand of liver-destroying quasi-beer. The only problem with this is that it's hard to observe brand loyalty when the brand in question makes you throw up on your friends a little bit quicker."
"Poured from a clear 40 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of malts, slightly sweet. Taste is basically of malts and corn. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall not that bad as far as malt liquors go."
"Keeping in mind this is a malt liquor, I didn't hold out much hope for it. That being said, I know I didn't rate it very high, but it was better then I thought it was going to be. It's no where near as harsh as Steel Reserve, which is probably the nastiest of malt liquors out there. Poured into o pint glass its plae yellow in color, with a whole lot of foam. It has a sweetness in the taste thats kind of appealing. All in all no where near a great beer, but if pay day is ways of and you want something cheap to get the job done this will do it."
"Hurricane High Gravity Lager was pale gold in color with good clarity. It had a large white head that quickly disappeared. The aroma was light and clean, just a generic beer smell. There was not much flavor to speak of, but what what was there was not good. It was somewhat sweet upfront with a dry finish. The body was light and watery with lighter than expected carbonation. Drinkability was not good. This is not a beer that I will purchase again. Maybe the regular version would be better."
"I'm not really sure why I bought this. Though it's easy to drink for the first 20oz, the skunkiness starts to catch up, and is ultimately disappointing."
"Final Thoughts - I reviewed this with the style in mind. Not a terrible malt liquor but nothing special either. Pick it up if you need a cheap brew as a single. Otherwise don't bother."
"This beer really doesn't have much going for it. The alcohol content is not 8.10%, that's Hurricane High Gravity which really only has that going for it. It tastes worse and I think is only served as 40's. Try hard to steer clear unless you're really low on cash and just want to get sloshed."
"D 2.5 - almost drinkable for a malt liquor, I would rink it if I am broke or if it is my only beer option, thats about it. Good for the style I guess."
"""Brace for the smooth taste."" What is that supposed to mean? If its smooth I shouldn't need to be forewarned. This pours golden and clear. Very little bubble activity. Smell is clean mostly, with a note of corn syrup. Unremarkable, really, but nothing offensive either. Taste is pretty darn smooth I must admit. Sweet and with a light vinous fruit taste also. This hides the ABV very well especially for style. I was pleasantly surprised to find no fusel alcohol flavors even as it warmed a bit. Mouthfeel is smooth as well, perhaps needs a little more in the way of carbonation. Finish is dry and clean. Drinkability, for 40 standards, is top notch."
"This is beer for getting drunk on, so no need to treat this like a micro and judge it on nose, appereance, ect...What matters here is drinkability and the buzz, which this provides in spades considering the cheap price. This is one of those beers that you wanna make sure your not driving anywhere after a few 40's. This is my cheap beer of choice, and if you hate it, big deal, your only down $1.09. However, I do recommend drinking this out of a glass if you bought a can, the metal taste seems to go away."
"Hurricane pours a golden yellow with a white head from a clear thirty two ounce bottle. The aroma is all adjunct. There is a bit of fruitiness in the flavor, otherwise it's just generic industrial beer flavor, no hops to be found. Okay for what it is, but there are probably better malt liquors out there."
"That being said, after dinner, I'm gonna swing by my local beverage shack and snag two of these bad boys."
"Pours a golden yellow color with not much of a head. Like most malt liquors, I don't think this is meant for glasses. The nose has some corn syrup like malts. Very light though. The taste is of corny alcohol and not much else. Somwhat full, but not at all enjoyable."
"Pours a super light yellow/white color with average head with average lacing and average carbonation. The dominate smell is corn and mild malts. First taste is light, sweet, and lcking in body and taste. After the corn, the dominate flavor is WATER. Not worth buying or drinking. AVOID!!"
"D - It was a lot like drinking water that gets you drunk for a malt liquor it was very light in flavor and mouthfeel"
"Hurricane is for getting wasted, and forgetting about the past, and nothing more. Its smoothness does make it easier to go down though."
"Ahh, the Old Slurricane. For those who haven't had the pleasure(?), drink a couple of these sugared-down dandies and you might be slllurrrinnnggg your words. Or just puking. Now, Bud's other 40 offering is King Cobra, which is hideous, but this isn't as bad. I think it is because it is smoother and doesn't leave a stinging backbite. It is also higher in ABV, so maybe I was just too drunk to notice. I guess if I had to pick between this and St Ides I would take this (although I probably gave St Ides higher marks) since it is not as dirty sweet."

"Good party beer, but not a good beer."
"69% recommended."
"Medium-light amberish-yellow with a small, creamy, off-white, slowly-diminishing head. Smell is a lot of corn husk and good bit of alcohol. Some grain. Taste-wise, we got more corn here and some pretty nasty fusel-like alcohol followed by a light dry finish and a touch of citrus that barely sticks out from behind the lingering alcohol burn. It has a medium-light body, a watery but astringent texture and moderate-low carbonation. Yeah, this is a cheapo alright. No reason to ever buy this one again. This is not for the beer drinker, this is purely for the person that wants to get drunk.... and it's good for putting out in shallow pans in the garden to kill snails."
"Overall. I am enjoying this slightly more than i thought i would, and at $1.50 a 40oz, it was worth giving it a try. I would venture to guess this is one of the better malt liquors, but i am making sure to only have it as cold as humanly possible."
" I noticed on each successive sip that I was disliking this beer more and more. Back in my drunk-on-a-budget days I would have quaffed a 40 of High Life or Steel Reserve over Hurricane, Camo, or anything else whose name has to do with natural disasters/combat. Poured the rest of this one down the sink. The good thing about this beer is that the person seriously drinking this to get drunk couldn't care less about its taste. I believe this beer would be best enjoyed 3 at a time out of a giant multi-valved beer bong."
"Drinkability - not a beer made to experience the enjoyment of beer. Bud on steroids, not totally bad but watch out that next morning."
"Forty ounce bottle yo money yo bash...yep folks those are ol' dirty Bastard lyrics I have to pay homage to one of my seventh grade hereoes...Russel Jones one of the founding members of the Wu-Tang Clan. Appearance is straw golden with a bright white head leaves thin lacing, yo. Aroma is semi sweet no hops grainy sugary tones harsh corn and rice. Taste is not overly sweet mild graininess no hop flavor very mild bitterness alcohol flavors in the finish kinda run of the mill. Mouthfeel light bodied somewhat sticky with residual sugars high carbonation. Drinkability is refreshing just doesn't do it for me as a whole, and I feel like this malt liquor is another bud product for the masses."
"($1.69 / 40 oz. fat clear bottle with a twist off cap)"
"As 40 oz bottles of malt liquor go, this is decent and very competitively priced. I only drink 40s once every couple of months now, but my friend who lives and dies with the malt liquor has a fridge stocked with 25+ of these babies at all times. Sometimes you want a forty, and this is a pretty good one. Recommended."
"Presentation: Packaged in a forty ounce clear glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"I only ave ever consumed or seen this stuff in a 40 bottle. Cler darkish gold color, some head in the bottle. This was, as malt liquors go, not bad. It was sweet and adjuncty, but not over the top, and alcohol was not kicking you in the throat the whole time. Mouthfeel is neutral. Very cheap, not a good experience, but not terrible."
"This is the 2nd (and last) of the crappy malt liquors I found in New Orleans. Not much to really say about this one, it's exactly how a malt liquor usually tastes. Bad appearance, sweet macro smell, and overly sweet, somewhat nasty taste. This isn't any worse or better than most malt liquors, they all seem pretty much the same to me anyway. Something this lame should have higher than 6% alcohol to be worthwhile for those needing a quick drunkening."
"Epilogue: I finished the 40. Then I had a bottle of PBR (baby steps, folks, baby steps). It tasted like a nice hoppy craft brew in comparison."
"Char"
"This is nothing I'm too proud to drink. It poured a urine color and consistancy. Luckily it did'nt smell like that, but it wasn't much better. I had a bottle of skunk. That's all I smelled. The taste was grainy with mild adjuncts. Nothing good here. Move on."
"Pours with a thin, fizzy head that disappears immediately. Some carbonation. Color of apple... well, closer to white grape juice. Aroma of artifical sweetness, apple juice fruitiness; sour, twangy alcohol and little else. Taste of more sour, just sour (!) alcohol and sweetened fruit juice suggestions. Sweet, adjunctly beeriness; nothing really to see here, folks (shudder). Mouthfeel is thin, watery, a bit of carbonated fizz. Mostly just water--hardly even an alcohol kick, just water... Drinkability? Just make sure you give it your best shot before it warms up. Pretty awful. I try not to be too hard on the malt liquors and review them in their proper context, but this went down the drain."
"Haha everyone loves a good 40 ounce of Malt Liquor from time to time. I personally don't have much of a problem with Hurricane, in fact it is probably one of the better Anheuiser Busch Products out there in my opinion. Hurricane has a unique mouthfeel and a somewhat sweet taste. Its' really not that bad considering its a malt liquor."
"Yes, sometimes you do just have to go to the deli where nobody speaks any English whatsoever and grab a 40. This is definitely one of the better malt liquor 40's I have had. Ice cold, it certainly was not harsh at all on the taste buds. There definitely was not any discernible hop flavor...a grainy malt with a mild alcohol flavor just about rounds out the flavor. Usually near the bottom of a 40 I am pushing myself to finish it, but this one was real easy, probably because its one of the weaker ones at 6%. If you're 40 shopping, this isn't a bad choice. ""Brace for the smooth taste."""
"Fellow BA, Genaro picked this 22 oz wide mouth bottle up from a gas station in rural Georgia, so we were expecting this to be a top-notch ""Craft"" brew. Turns out to be a ""Crap"" brew. This has to be the most horrible malt liquor ever brewed. The pale yellow color is no warning for the nasty tasting corn-mealy malt. The hops must be the cheapest available. Sugary sweet and cardboard flavored. It's bland and offensive at once. The pasty and alcoholic aroma is offensive. Shame on the Busch family for producing this beer. Just whom are they trying to hook on this awful swill? I couldn't find the ""Might cause Blindness or permanent liver dysfunction on the warning label. Hiss Boo, absolutely horrible!"
"Nice colouring, medium honey hue, limited head with some glass ring...aroma is non discript and the taste is more than equal to the dollar value...This product is marketable..."
"Sure, this isn't some crazy silly awesome beer, but, it's still ok. I used to get it when I was in college, cause it was $.99 a can! that's awesome. $.99 for a 22oz. and it wasn't toally nasty beer. It was a very light colored beer, with a very short lived head, most likely from carbonation. Had a kind of semi-sweet taste to it, but nothing too noticebale. Finished kinda harsh, but what do you expect."
"sometimes ya just gotta grab a 40 and administer a quick and effective attitude adjustment to yourself.  fortunately i don't do this too often!  hurricane is just another run of the mill malt liquor with the usual sweetness. pretty bland and boring.  i won't ever drink it again, but did this time to get in a review."
"I try to judge every beer I taste on it's specific merits; and I don't bring style or personal preferences into it. In fact, I'm a fan of malt liquors, but... ... this one is not real good. And that's very surprising since it comes from Budweiser, but in a way it all makes sense. This is a very clean (except for the fruitiness) unobtrusive lager. I feel it's a bit too limited for the style! That said, it has a deep gold color with a thick (but not very dense) head and a generic malt & hop aroma. The body is fairly light. I was expecting a little more flavor... it has a fruitiness but limited maltiness - and no hop flavor. Very low bitterness. Finishes fruity but very clean."
