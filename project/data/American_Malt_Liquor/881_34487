1.25,-33.5,,,,,,"I've tasted a lot of beers in my time, but this has to be among the worst.  I know some people mentioning a head, but it had very little for me.  The smell was okay, but the taste was like pure alcohol with a hint of apple to it.  If there were any hops in it, they must have floated to the top and been scraped off because I could taste none.  The ONLY reason I gave it more than a 1.0 is because you could easily hold your breath and guzzle the stuff down---little carbonation or aftertaste.  Skip it!","Uinta","Aug 16, 2014"

2.4,27.7,3.75,3,2,2.5,2,"one of those beers that was given to me as a gag gift awhile back, sat in my fridge for some time, and finally got opened out of curiosity. the looks of it are really nice actually, clear golden in color with an inch of reasonably well lasting head, pure white, and leaving lacing as i swirl it. the nose isn't bad either, not at all. slightly stale and rather sweet barley and dextrose aromas, and some slight metallic oddness, but nothing way off, and not at all super boozy. the flavor is another story. the first sip is rather pleasant, i surprisingly taste grain first. it gets worse from their though. the second sip reveals a ton of sweetness, unnatural and very dense, while the third sip shows just how alcoholic it is. its a mess, and downright revolting by the third sip, more can than beer at this point. honestly on the whole its better than anticipated for so long, but the huge can and huge booze makes me timid. this would be warm by the end of it, which totally turns my guts around.carbonation is fine though the body is sweet and big. lager yeast flashes in, an odd appearance, and I'm wondering why so much residual sugar, just sloppy technique by whatever factory produced this thing. serves a purpose i guess, but not a purpose i hope to ever have...","StonedTrippin","Feb 08, 2014"

3.41,81.4,4,3,3.5,2.5,4,"While it's one of the most bitter flavors I've ever had from a tallboy, CAMO Black Ice will really get you the most bang for your buck. This stuff carries a serious bite. The initial taste, although strong, is actually not that horrible. It WILL, however, give your face an oogly-moogly expression if you're not accustomed to drinking it. The nice thing about it is how quickly it can get you on the level. For the average person a single tallboy will get you a healthy buzz and anything beyond 2 is guaranteed tipsy-status. If you can get past the aftertaste this stuff makes a long day at work seem like less of a big deal at the end of the day.","staticparadox","Jan 13, 2012"
1.16,-38.3,2,1,1,1,1.5,"Harshly astringent and overcarbonated. It tastes like alcohol and white grape juice that has started to turn. Sharp and lip-curling foul taste of fusel alcohol and sickly sweet white grape juice (likely from wine yeast). Just bad, real bad. One of the worse malt liquors on the market, pretty much the bottom of the barrel for a $1.49 can.","emerge077","Jul 03, 2011"

1.94,3.2,3.5,2,1.5,2.5,2,"The eighth entry in SwillFest 2011. It pours a clear straw topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises bubblegum, vanilla, cream soda, and corn syrup. Boo. The taste holds notes of lemon rind, tart mandarin orange skin, corn syrup, and rotten vanilla bean. More boo. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel. Overall, a highly objectionable malt lickah, one that I wish followed the harshly sweet smell.","TMoney2591","Dec 03, 2010"

Even for a seasoned high gravity malt liquor drinker like I am the alcohol in this can take you by surprise.  Of course once you're under Black Ice's influence it can taste, well, acceptable!  I've had one other 10.5% ABV high gravity ice malt liquor, Pit Bull Ice, with the same ABV, style, and price range but Pit Bull Ice is completely drinkable.

1.06,-43.6,2,1,1,1,1,"Another great find of a beer in a ghetto liquor store. Pours golden with a slight haze, big bad white foamy head that dies down relatively quickly to a small cap with a spot or two of lace. Smells of honey, plastic, ammonia, and hot garbage on the nose. Tastes of sour grapes, plastic, corn drenched in rubbing alcohol, and the finish brings a bit of cookie and a roll of pennies. Medium to light in body, not too sure because I can't really keep it in my mouth too long without discomfort, very high carbonation. This is probably the worst beer I've ever had, but one day I want to try Evil Eye. One day. Until then, I hate myself for buying this, even if it was just for a laugh.

1.23,-34.6,4,1,1,1.5,1,"Okay, is this beer capable of getting a head? I poured repeatedly, only to see what little developed devolve into wisps. The hell with it! I moved on. Color was a beautiful golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nice. Especially since it was all downhill from there. The nose had a sharp paint thinner-like quality which is not optimal. OK, I am not stupid, I get the point - it is a cheap buzz at 10.5 ABV in a low-priced 24-oz. can, but ZOUNDS!, does it need to be so obnoxious? Mouthfeel was thin with a hot alcohol burn on the tongue replaced with a green apple flavor. Phew. The finish left me (literally) breathless. It was a really hot beer from start to finish and undoubtedly smoked a couple of brain cells and a region of my liver. Man, I would be hard pressed to crack another of those.","woodychandler","Beers"

2.41,28.2,4,3,2,2.5,2,"The appearance score might put Camo Black Ice over the top when it comes to the final score, but malt liquors are made for drinking (and, yes, tasting), so Schlitz High Gravity is my favorite beer of Malt Likkapalooza X no matter how it shakes out in the end. Looks like Camo 900 High Gravity is the best Camo of them all.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 15, 2007"
2.63,39.9,2,1.5,3,3.5,3,"I really didn't have high hopes for the Camo Black Ice high gravity lager, but I actually found it to be pretty smooth and drinkable from start to finish. It's a malt liquor, through and through, from its clear pale amber color to its mildly dry finish. The smell was the only aspect that really put me off, but the taste was much better than that. It does a decent job of masking its whopping 10.5% alcohol level, and the black ice remains drinkable at a wide range of temps. You'll find that out, as it takes a while to work your through a 24oz can. One thing's for certain, by the time you finish one of these you're going to have a different outlook on things.","86sportster883","May 13, 2007"
1.12,-40.4,3,1,1,1,1,"Originally reviewed July 13 2007. Poured from a 24 oz can. Aroma is a distinctive amalgam of burning rubber tires and gas-station-machine condoms. Estery. Holds clean and clear, in pale gold, with a fresh draught of crisp white foam. Beautiful head retention. Flavor departs from the aroma and grabs more of a wheat fusel line, backed with incredibly alcohol reek, bus vomit, and bushels of corn. You can really feel the alcohol working its evil on you. Bitter for no apparent reason (certainly not hops). Its like having all the bad parts of a poorly craft brewed barleywine, without any of the malt character or hop flavor. Pure concentrated corn sugar garbage. Smacks out in a compost figure.","CharlesDarwin","May 02, 2007"
5,166,5,5,5,5,5,"Camo Black is good for one thing - a high ABV. To discuss its qualities in detail would be akin to evaluating the finer points of Taco Bell. That being said, it really tastes no worse than any other malt liquor I've had, and it is extremely inexpensive.
