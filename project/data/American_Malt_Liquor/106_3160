This brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice white head.  The smell is corn with some grans.  There is nothing bad about this brew so far. There is a lot corn in the taste of this brew but it has a nice balance to it. This brew goes down nice for having a 5.9% ABV. Schlitz Malt Liquor is one of the better Malt Liquors on the market.  There is nothing over powering in this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3.75 out of 5. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Sep 21, 2014"

Schlitz OML has a malty character with slight fusel alcohol note mixed with an apple meets bready overtone with slight grassy character. It is rich by malt liquor standards. Tastes pleasant. Drink only when cold. It is horrid warm. I have drank this in cans and in 40 ounce bottles. I favor it in 40's. Does nothing wrong in malt liquor. Only Colt 45 for me is a better malt liquor, or Olde English 800. I rate this 3.50. A superb cheap drunk. I like this and drink it every so often.","KentT","Jun 20, 2014"

The malt and corn come through with some mild hop bitterness in the back end. The alcohol isn't that detectable in the taste. The body is light to medium with plentiful carbonation. This beer is smooth. The drinkability is very good good. Overall, this is a good beer for the price.

I'm a fan of that bad beer flavour, but it's not usually what I expect from a malt liquor. I usually expect more corn in a malt liquor and maybe a bit of an alcohol taste. Maybe some unbalanced sweetness. Not here. This was super...duper...average. One good thing was the presence of hops for balance. That's odd, but kinda fun in a beer that often goes hopless. It's also nice to have that "bad beer" taste exacerbated more than most cheap "beers" tend to do (as opposed to malt liquors).

Seeing my weakness, she approaches and stands nose to nose. My goodness, I catch a hint of sweet perfume on this temptress ruffian. Wet sweet over a flowery hint. Not at all what I expected. In the moment I struggle with this surprise, she attacks. On her lips I taste memories of honey from her morning toast. Lilac flowers. Perhaps her heart is true? Yet her blue-collar nature shows through. Like drab cardboard, stiff and drab to the world. Yes, she's no pussy cat. She bites my tongue leaving a sting like rough vodka mixed with a fizzy warm un-cola. The encounter continues longer than I'd like, dry and thin on my end, until I'm left repellant.
