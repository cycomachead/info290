"I began with two fingers of fizzy french vanilla-colored head that hung in pretty well in the face of the humidity that is helping to keep me up tonight. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and suddenly Croesus and King Midas were back to their fighting. Knock it off! This is not worthy of your efforts! Nose smelled like a Minhas product and I do not mean that in a good way. Plastics, pink bubble gum, dry cleaning fluid were all perceived. Could it get any worse? Yes! The taste was burnt rubber and a metallic tang that made me wonder from what kind of glass the bottle was made. Whew! Finish was bone-dry and I was afraid to breathe near any open flames. Phew! I will NOT be allowing this to warm up. It might self-combust. M'man, Snoop Lion says that his jawnt ""Works Every Time"" and I would be willing to bet that this gem will work equally well. The best example of a really poor style. Do I now taste eau de cigarette ashtray? I knew I did not want this warming!"
"pours a yellow transparent color with a white head with average retention. sweet corn skunky aroma. More of the same in the taste. Pretty light body considering the abv. Fairly straight forward malt little with a bit of a funk to it. Not looking to drink this again"

"Overall - This is definite a LOT better than most of the malt liquors I've tried.. So I give them props for that. Probably not something I would drink regularly though."
"It has a gross filmy slickness that is like glycerine, literally phlegm-like and utterly disgusting. Low carb levels makes it a chore to drink, with an astringent bite. Dumping the rest now. Nasty. A poor choice, even for a novelty 40 buy. Stay far, far away from this garbage. Calling this ""crisp"" or ""easily drinkable"" is laughable..."
"Been a while since I tried a new malt liquor, so why not something random I found during my last visit to Kenosha? It pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of off-white froth. The nose comprises light hard water, light sweet flowers, and very light grass. Almost no smell going on here... The taste holds notes of corn, sour wheat, spicy hard water (I really hope that makes sense to someone other than me...), and grass. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, not much to see here. It isn't horrid, thankfully, but it's nowhere near good."

"Chilled 40oz'er, drank from a swanky new Alchemist glass. Beer poured a translucent straw yellow with just under a finger of head that soon melted away into nothingness, leaving barely a hint of lace. Nose was sweet, grainy with a hint of corn and alcohol. The taste was much more pleasant than the smell. Sweet, light corn and grain, subdued alcohol, crisp finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Went down smooth, no aftertaste."
"For the low cost and the elevated strength, if you don't mind a bit of repetitive, albeit mild, soulless sweetness, this goes down none too shabbily. But if you just came from downing a Slurpee from the Mac's next door to the liquor store, then I can see why that wouldn't bother you in the least."
"Like most malt liquors, it starts off tasting horrible, but it's not hard to get used to it."
"It is cheap as hell, and it shows in the taste, I bought it more or less as a joke. And I only had 6 ounces of it, that was enough."
"Overall, this beer is nothing fancy, made to get you drunk for cheap. Although I prefer this over other malt liquors as it is fairly easy to drink. The label alone stands out from other 40's."
"Not bad at all. Cheap and easy to drink. Of course, what more do you expect? If I were in a pinch, I'd probably buy it again. The problem is, it's a ferry ride across the lake for it."
"Feel is also very light and crisp, most likely due to the temperature. As this warms, the nastiness comes out, making it hard to drink. I'd say it has average drinkability when cold, decreasing rapidly as this brew warms."
"Never had it before, it was on sale. to be honest i wish i didn't spend the money.The beer left a funny taste in my mouth and and was a bit flat to begin with. As malt liquors go, this one is better then others i've had in the past. all in all....I've had better...."
"...It was 1994. We were on the Michigan State University Campus on a typical Saturday night party search. My buddy Anthony was old enough to buy beer so he did. He bought me a 99 cent 40 oz of Big Bear. I was only 19. Without getting into detail we had a great night that night. By the end of the night I had a huge cut on my right knee. Anthony taped a wad of napkins on my gushing bloody knee at Bell's Pizza on Grand River. It ws 4-20-94. I know that because I kept the bottle from that night and that date was scribed onto the bottle along with our signatures. My blood is still on the bottle. Anyway, I guess the purpose of this site is to review the taste of beers and not the memories behind beers. But in this case the memory is way better than the taste. The taste sucks. The beer sucks. What we did that night was great."
"D - Not bad at all! Just try not to smell it! Heilman makes the best cheapo beer ever! PBR, Old Milwaukee, and now Big Bear!"
"Now for its good points. The label is one of the most awesome out there with a big mean bear. It is a little cheaper than other malt liquors at about a buck fifty. The gravity is just right, one forty on a summer day hanging out on the front porch will put you right were you want to be. It's a classic beverage if only for its low rent appeal. Not ghetto, strictly white trash. I always get one when I visit my old town and hang with my homies."
"Everyone must remember that this is malt liquor... the basement bargain brand of beer. It is what it is, although this is one of the better tasting malt liquors that I have tried. It does not have the characteristic sweet taste from the alcohol that most malts have. It is easy to drink, and tastes great on a warm day with some bbq. It is also rdiculously cheap when compared to other malts."
"Not bad. Not bad at all. Very easy to drink and it packs a punch. Not overly sweet like most malt liquors. Tastes the best when drank ice cold right out of the bottle. For a nice 99 cent buzz, you cant beat it. Oh yeah, and the bear's nice to look at."
"This 40 does what it sets out to do, gets ya drunk cheap, and let's you do it before it gets warm (if that's your objective). Better than most 40 oz's of malt liquor I've tried."
"Bad beer....but cheap."
"Drinkability: Depends on your mindset. You wanna get tanked? This is wonderful, drinkability is a five. Sit back and guzzle and hoot and holler. Aside from that though, this is not the beer to be sitting around with, enjoying with friends. There is nothing to enjoy. It has very little redeeming qualities except it might actually strengthen your face muscles, as I recoiled and scrunched my face up after every sip. Ah well, a good choice for those who like to get bombed cheaply."
"Cheap drunk if that's what you are looking for...but still kinda sad if you are."
