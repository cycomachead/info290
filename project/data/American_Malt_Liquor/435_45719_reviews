"O=Too sweet for my liking...may be interesting as a cheap lager for a snakebite."

"Not exactly sure what they we trying to acheive in this ""strong ice beer"" - high alcohol, low price to compete with other malt liquors. Gold color, fizzy head that quickly disappears to nothing. Almost no aroma, maybe wet straw or grain, kind of sweet smell. First taste is sour on the tongue. Watery and thin, no body, and an alcohol after taste. Should have known better : High alcohol % plus low cost equals no good."

"Could be an average malt liquor, but the sweetness makes the beer disgusting. Only try if your already drunk and can't notice the taste."
"P.S. / EDIT: Clear Creek Ice tastes a bit like ""Earthquake", only watered-down for those who are still at 'entry level' in terms of their appreciation of street life : /"
"However, my drain found it very easy to drink..."
"Good news for those who buy this crap for the extra booze - you can`t really taste it amongst the suckling sweetness. Enjoy your 12 packs, boyz..."
"In comparing it to bold-flavored craft brews, it actually can hold a candle. Don't get me wrong, this isn't 60 Minute, but it a simple, tasty, cheap beer."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, malts. Taste is not so good, plastic, overly sweet, other undetectable flavors,not very enjoyable. Feels light in the mouth and is not very drinkable. Overall this is a sub-par beer."
"After all is said and done, it's exactly what I expected. It has the bare minimum in every category to make it drinkable. Add to it the fact the it is only 50 cents a can and 6.2% abv, and you have a popular beer. If those were the criteria, it would be on BA's Top 100 list."
"Re-Upgrade complete. # 30993 now in complete compliance with Minhas plan Sol3. Lovely beer. Yum yum."
"to quote nwk340 ""do we have to finish this?"""
"MF/D: thin, regretting putting this liquid in my mouth. i may apologize to my taste buds. do i have to finish this? followed by Doritos Late Night All-nighter Cheeseburger chips. might be worse than the beer. oddly they compliment each other well."
"on its own, this was a sickly sweet alcohol bomb with nothing supporting it. with lemon and ice it becomes eminently drinkable. i'm rating the beer as it is sold, though. 0.5 imaginary points (maybe factored into drinkability?) for being economical: $2.29 for a 4-pack."
"D- This is a average drinker. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it but it was there and I had to take my time with the first couple. I think I'll stick with my Pabst as a thrist quencher as I practice with the band."
"D-At the same price point as Mountain Creek and Minhas light I would say it is very drinkable for an ajunct macro."
"I'm very impressed with this beer, and recommend it to anyone looking for a beer that has decent flavor but not the aftertaste of a usual malt liquor. It's a deceiving 6.2% alcohol, which is never a bad thing."
"if price was a factor, this would score extra points as it truly is budget. it passes, but definately not something to drink if you're into flavor and presentation."
"Dark gold with a ton of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass and a lumpy grey tinted white head that fades quick and leaves some scraps of sticky lace on the glass. The nose is mostly grits with a whiff of alcohol. The taste isn't bad, sweet corn, green apple skin and a touch of grain alcohol. Medium bodied and easy to drink. Tastes more like a lighter malt liquor than a typical ""ice"" beer. Not bad for what it is, cheap and high octane."
"This beer looks like a macro lager. Its smell is faint. It lacks scary funk; this is nothing like OE; one might say it is clean smelling. I sort of like the fact that this beer, as its packaging suggests, is quite plain, in a midwestern-american kind of way. This beer should be served cold because it is meant to quench the kind of thirst that can't be quenched by hydration alone. Palate is mildly sweet with alcoholic headiness lurking just below the surface. There is nothing really off-putting about this beer. It is stronger than the typical swill and tastes fresh and unsurprising. I like it and I hope it stays on the shelf around here."
"Although the scores seem a little bit high in retrospect, Clear Creek Ice does what it was brewed to do and does it pretty well. Sure it's sledgehammer simple, but it's also better than any macro lager you'd care to name. Bottom line: training wheels malt liquor."
