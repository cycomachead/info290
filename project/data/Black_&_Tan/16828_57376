2.97,0,,,,,,"This was probably the best of the beers I tried at the scale house, as the roasted flavor was pleasant and muted the rest of the flavors a bit.","Hojaminbag","Beers"
2.87,0,,,,,,"Off tap at the brewery this 'black and tan' was a copper color with wisps of tan foam atop it that quickly faded away. No lacing to speak of. The aroma was slightly nutty with a light dry roasted malt presence. The flavors were almost exactly like the aroma with a touch of bittering from ill-defined hops. OK, but not what a black and tan should be and clearly an extract brew. The mouthfeel was watery, the body medium/light and the carbonation average.","thekevlarkid","0"
