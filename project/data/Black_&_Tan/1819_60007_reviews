"Brown with red highlights, with an off white head with fair retention and lacing. Smells and tastes like caramel, dark roasted malt, and bread. A bit thin and watery, with decent carbonation. Not much aftertaste. Not much to get excited about, but not bad either."

"Pour was lighter side of brown with a slight ruddy tint. Not a lot of head, and lacked lacing. Smell was lightly malty. Taste was similarly malty with a mild sweetness that finished crisp and dry enough not to be annoyingly sweet. Light body. Drinkable. Average."

"O - Not good, not bad...average, at best. Really easy to drink but didn't really intrigue me at all. Wouldn't probably get again...too many other good ticks to be had out there."
"The Two Pull was an interesting combination between the Northern Lights and the Brother Benedict Bock. The combination made for a decent tasting beer. I appearance was average lighter clear amber, not much head and no lace. The smell was a maltier version of the Northern Lights Lager. The taste was much better than the Bock by itsself. The Lager helped to smooth out the heavy grain/barley taste of the Bock. Mouthfeel was good the Bock gave the beer a little body and the lager made teh beer drinakable. Overall it was ok. teh IPA was much better."
"just thought that I would add a few things. here in my city the two pull varies depending on who pours it. varying amounts of the 2 flavors greatly change the taste/drinkability. but overall its a solid choice for me. and at $6 on tues and thurs you cant go wrong with the cost either"
"My brother law shared the growler with me. He picked this one up in Toledo."
"D: this is really not bad at all. drink em down!"
"Note: This is a combo of Granite City's light and bock style beers. This is only the second time I have heard about combining beers like this but it works well this time"
"O: A good beer for a chain brewpub. It won't blow you away, but I would choose this over the likes of your typical macrobrew. I go to Granite City for the food, but I enjoy Two Pulls while I'm there."
"Overall, I am surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. Very easy drinking, yet full of flavor. The 25 oz mug went fast. Give this one a try when you are visiting."
"Tasted On-Tap 05/11/05 at the Cedar Rapids, IA location."
