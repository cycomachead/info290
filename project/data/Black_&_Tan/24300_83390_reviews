"To some extent, I guess that this is the point of such a beer blend."

"O: definitely feels like much more stout than IPA in spite of the reality; didn't get the complexity of flavor that I expected; it's still a really nice beer;"
""
""
""

"O: I would love to try making a black & tan with yin & yang and comparing it to this. As is I'd call if more of a black IPA than a true mixed black & tan, but still a very solid beer"
"From my favorite brewer. Pours almost black. Smells of smoke, sweet, sour with hints of liquorish. Taste is smoky, sweet skunk with a bitter malty finish. Feel is somewhat heavy but lightens up with the hoppy finish. Overall, I'm disappointed and hope that I got an old batch. I will revisit and pay attention to it's age."

"Not a hung fan of stouts, I don't really taste the hops."

"More stout on the nose with a solid feel and a slightly hoppy, almost spicy finish.  Real interesting.  Well done ET."
"O: To sum it up in 1 word; intense. The first few sips are strong to say the least, massive bitterness that is damn near overwhelming. As it warms it mellows out and blends fairly well. At 10% + the strength of the flavors going on it can be a real kick in the face, but a hell of an experience."

"i think as good or better than the sum of its constituent parts. the ipa is still a little intense for me, as this comes across as much as an imperial black ipa as anything else, interesting and unique, getting better all the time as it warms. chocolate notes, dry cocoa, raw dark, and a touch of bitter bakers are all here when it gets to room temperature, and the hops in the finish push bitterness double jeopardy, but they do also compliment each other pretty well. complex and huge, but the booze doesnt show through all that much, its the body that makes this one gigantic, viscous, teeth coating, and almost harsh. lots of big dark beers from evil twin, some better than others, but the intense hop complexion of this one makes it unlike any of his others. creamy in feel, frothy, and drying as it moves along. worth the three bucks and change i paid for a single, no doubt about that, but these beers, all three of them, seem overly aggressive and not as well refined as they probably could be. still, a cool blending project given the hoppy nature of the ipa component."
"Drinkability â€“ Evil Twin stouts are among my favorite, and while this is very nice, I prefer both the Yin and the Yang better on their own.  Still, this about as good as it gets for a black and tan."
"Pours out interesting, with a much darker body on the top and a a lighter (relatively speaking) amber on the bottom. A nice creamy tan head settles down and leaves some nice sticky/soapy lacing. The aroma is a little muddled, which isn't surprising for a bottle black  and tan. The taste, though is a nice blend, with deep roasted malt notes of coffee and hops blending perfectly. The body has a nice thickness to it and there's just a little bite to it on the finish."

"This is beer tan has intense aromas and tastes.  A pure mix of DIPA and Imperial Stout.  Prominent characteristics of both styles.  I was a little skeptical, but was rather impressed this beer."
""

"Seriously awesome black and tan that is kind of a black ipa"
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm not a black and tan guy, but ETs version of an Imp Black and Tan is nice.  This is worth your time if you see it around."
""
""
""
"Overall I'd say this is by far the best bottled black & tan that I've ever had and a beer I will seek out and highly recommend. The overall score of 4.5 may seem high, but this is the best in class compared to other beers in the bottled black & tan category."
""
"Very creamy--almost like drinking a dark chocolate milkshake. I can detect a touch of alcohol in the swallow. The aftertaste shows some bittering hop. Delicious."
""
"Pours a dark chocolate brown with a half finger beige colored head atop.Aromas of roast,caramel,alcohol dipped dark fruit,a hint of roasted nuts,alot of good stuff going on here.An oily slick feel with flavors that aren't as roasted as I thought,chocolate and caramel notes with dark fruit in the finish,there is some earthy roastedness but it's not in your face.I really like this beer,even better than what I was expecting."
"BOD 259/14.  Pours a slightly transparent near black.  Normal head volume, above average retention and excellent lacing.  Nose is as advertised - ale characteristics (pine and citrus hops) over stout characteristics (dark chocolate with notes of roast).  Underneath are notes of caramel - quite nice.  As it warms, alcohol becomes evident as do very subtle notes of dark fruit.  Light medium bodied with a nice smooth texture that has a bit of creaminess to it.   Above normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and more in the finish.  The flavor profile is intense, quite complex and reasonably balanced.  It begins with a burst of sweetness that rapidly fades into a blended bitterness of hops and roast.  As the bitterness fades, grapefruit rind and pine hop flavors become dominant.  These, in turn, yield to a mild coffee flavor over a sweet chocolate note.  The finish is a lingering rind bitterness over heavy notes of alcohol and hints of prune."
" I think I like Yin & Yang a liiittle bit more than I like each on their own. This is a very interesting beer that changes a lot with the temperature. It has a lot of the characters of a rich, hearty stout, but it adds a pretty nice dash of hops to make it taste like an over-hopped imperial stout (again, not quite an Imperial Black IPA, in my opinion). The price is a little high, but so is the ABV, and more importantly, the quality of the beer. This is an excellent beer -- just make sure you get it relatively fresh so you can enjoy the hops that only a fresher bottle of this beer can offer."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, you don't see too many pre mixed black and tans especially ones that are on the stronger side, but this one turned out to be a nice beer.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, slightly warming, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but i think one is enough for me, the bitterness might start to wear on me if I have more than that.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance in the taste and the appearance, to me those were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty unbalanced and I wish the stout aspects showed up more.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone that wants a black and tan that showcases roasted and hoppy flavors.  All in all I was happy with this beer and I ended up enjoying it a little more than just Yin by itself, the IPA brings some balance and complexity that Yin was lacking.  This is one of the better Evil Twin beers I've had and so far it's my favorite Black and Tan.  Nice job guys, this was a tasty black and tan, keep up the solid work."

"Pours a mostly stout appearance with dark brown color and tan/cocoa colored head.  Nice amount of lacing sticks to the glass.  The nose features all of the roastiness of an impy stout with a heavy dose of piney hops.  This is a nice balance between styles.  The flavor starts with roastiness and quickly transitions into heavy bitterness.  This drinks like a really hopped up imperial stout like Storm King or Old Rasputin.  The body is medium to light for style and the carbonation is a touch high. Overall, a delicious beer.  Definitely satisfies the cravings of a nice big stout and a bitter imperial IPA.  More roast than a black ale and definitely more hops than your avverage stout."

"First off, for a black & tan this is boss,  Pours like a stout (33% blend) and it smells hoppy like your IPA.  Call this an imperial black IPA, because thats pretty much what it is.  The aroma has plenty of hoppy notes with pine and citrus melding into a slightly smokey malt profile,  In the taste, stout flavor with the base of charcoal and coffee.  Gives way to a citrusy, grapefruit flavored hop note.  Slight alcohol tingles the throat, but really pretty well hidden alcohol content.  This is the granddaddy of Black&Tans.  Don't be afraid, just be prepared."

"Roast malt, booze, dark chocolate, floral hops, and dark fruit accompany muted citrus in a complex aroma. Flavor reveals dark fruit character of plums and sweet cherries, lots of alcohol, and floral esters, which is juxtaposed by a bitter roasty, hoppy, resiny finish. The booze and bitterness dominate, but the underlying fruit character is wonderful. May age well. Wish hop flavoring were more pronounced. Bitterness overwhelms, as it warms."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/16/2014. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, licorice, floral, grass, pine, light char/smoke, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, licorice, floral, grass, pine, light char/smoke, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine and roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, licorice, pine, light char/smoke, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of big dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; with a great roasted malt and hop bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, moderately sticky, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Black and tan style. All around great balance and complexity of big dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. Definitely felt like an imperial black IPA with the big hoppiness. Would be interested in aging this one to see what happens. A very enjoyable offering."

"Bottle from Maltitude. Pours dark black with frothy tan head. Aroma of dark malt, hops. Taste of strong bitter hops, roasted malts, and a hint of floral. Bitter hops on the back end. Very good black IPA"

"Dark brown ale with taste of cococa nibs, bitter dark chocolate, cigar, liquorish, burnt tasty sugar. Thick, creamy molasis body."

"Overall: Well, I'm glad I gave this style a go. I would like to try a small version, maybe giving me a different experience. Interesting to say the least."

"O: More like a black IPA, but so much more intense. I think the blend is too confusing to the taste buds and even the olfactory. I prefer my Yin and Yang in separate glasses."

"O: This isn't the most harmonious blend I've ever had. But it may as well be the most harmonious pre-made blend I'll likely have. As much as I enjoy this, I'd personally rather just buy Yin and Yang separately. Despite my mild reservations, this one is still quite good."
"i can't say this is a bad beer, by any means.. but it is the least impressive beer i've had from evil twin. it's definitely interesting, but it feels like the hoppiness it was meant to have has gone past its prime. a gamble i lost on i suppose."

"O - Two of the three tasters on this review felt the combination was better than the sum of it's parts. A really nice beer."

"O: This beer is rather unique and seems to have interesting properties from both the IPA and stout used to create this blend. It's definitely a beer to sip and savor. The alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"O: I have had both of the base beers for this separately and have made my own version of this black & tan at home but this would be the first time I've had the black & tan from the brewery - though I do not remember the beer being this big in the past (I wish the alcohol was a little more well hidden). This is a big beer and needs to be sipped and enjoyed slowly."
""
"This is a mess, and typical, not only of the dreaded and stupid Black IPA, but the ""Imperial Black IPA."" This was not enjoyable for me at all..."

"I was excited to see that Evil Twin had bottled a Yin and Yang; I had made and reviewed my own black and tan from 50/50 Yin and Yang a few years ago. Interestingly, my old review indicated that the toasted malt and stout character overwhelmed the barleywine elements in the two-bottle mix. This bottled version seems to have the opposite flavor progression and is much better balanced. I wish I had bought two of these now, although it was pricey."
""
"O: I'd really like to know the IBUs on this... it's definitely on the bitter side and I wouldn't be surprised if it's over 100. Still very nicely balanced and really showcases both beers. Not really like an American black ale or hoppy stout... definitely a style unto itself. For being 11.1%, this drinks dangerously easily. It's a good thing this is only 11.2 oz. Definitely worth a try if you like mixing your own B&Ts"
""
" O - A lot sweeter than expected, doesn't reach the cloying point, but gets fairly close. Don't get much of the Yin imperial stout. I would prefer a 75% Yin, 25% Yang blend."

"D - Amazing balance. Really nice complexity. Better than each of the base beers."

"Bought a bottle of this from Harvest Wine & Spirits in West Hartford, CT. Poured into a Rochefort goblet. Very dark brown with a petri dish bubbling on top. Amaaazing memories of hops, banana, clove, garlic, ginger, and other scents coming off this right from the pour! The taste backs it up with tons to explore. The mouthfeel leaves you with something to remember. Overall, this was an amazing beer -- more of a barleywine than a traditional ""black & tan"" -- and I would definitely recommend trying it!"
""
"That said, I paid $8.00 for a single bottle; I'm not too sure about that element of this Scots-Danish brew."
""
"D - As far as bottled Black & Tans go, this is a pretty good one. I could have used a bit more of the sugary sweetness on the palate, but this is pretty enjoyable stuff. I also liked this a ton better than the individual components."
""
"It's easy to want to pull the beer apart and form impressions on the stout portions as separate from the ipa portions. But together, we get the appreciation of both worlds, yet it can be argued that we get best of neither."
""

"Tasty. Definitely worth checking out, but you certainly pay for it."

"Served from bottle into a Mikkeller Teku (semi-proper!). Poured a massively dark red brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, subtle coffee, dark fruit, subtle citrus, subtle citrus hop, alcohol, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, earth, earth hop, citrus, citrus hop, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I have had a few Black & Tan brews back before I was reviewing beers and I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones Iâ€™ve had. If I am honest the stout portion of this brew definitely dominated this one with all the roastiness and alcohol notes. The â€˜tanâ€™ portion did make itself known throughout though with a nice kiss of citrus to help balance it out. I could honestly see this one getting you in quite a bit of trouble if you are not careful. Definitely a better representation of the style and definitely better than the make-shift one a few of us in my tasting group made. Worth your time trying if you get the chance."

"Overall: Yin & Yang is a fantastic Black & Tan (though it could just as well be a Black IPA). I will have to make an effort to get a bottle of both Yin and Yang and see what a home blend tastes like."
