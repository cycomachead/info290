1.54,-48,2.5,1,1.5,2.5,1.5,"The body was OK, kind of medium-thin, and very carbonated. Drinkability was terrible, due to the butter. Try this beer if you're curious, or a ticker (like me), otherwise avoid.","beertunes","Mar 18, 2012"

2.72,-8.1,3.5,2.75,2.5,3,2.75,"For whatever reason, the bars of a song often sung by Bugs Bunny and his cohorts runs through my mind whilst I ponder this beer. Oh well. This stuff pours a slightly dark garnet-sienna topped by a finger of short-lived glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuit and a light bit of roasted malts. During a few sniffs, the biscuit comes across as mildly charred. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a vague, blunt sweetness, not unlike corn syrup. It's like an artificially-sweetened ""beer"" flavor, the one your non-beer-drinking aunt will tell you all beer tastes like. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly slick feel. Overall, I think I just don't get this beer. It tastes nothing like a traditional black-and-tan, much less one's constituent parts. I think the overarching sweetness and lack of any real character beyond that hinders this stuff from ever achieving much of anything.","TMoney2591","Feb 16, 2011"
2.88,-2.7,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear iced tea color with a 1 inch beige head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random small splotches of lace slide back down into the remaining beer. Smell is of grains, caramel, and interestingly enough - vinegar. Ehh. Taste is pretty watery and is of malt, caramel candies, and a slightly sour vinegar taste as well. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with the weird vinegar quality going on. Not too good.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 20, 2010"
2.55,-13.9,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"OVERALL: This is would be a pretty easy beer to drink if I had more of a sweet tooth, but this wasn't quite my style. That said, it did not completely turn me off of Cold Spring. I would be willing to try another of their beers in the future.","StoneTSR","Sep 26, 2010"
2.81,-5.1,4,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Thinner body, slightly sticky, a little dry. I suppose this is drinkable, but only in the sense of slamming a 32oz can, which can be fun in its own right.","xnicknj","Beers"
3.45,16.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Bob's Market/ LA at a good price for a massive can, like $2-3 bones. Atthat price your expecting crap, this is pretty decent for the price, and I might say a deal. pours a deep brown, has some good malt on the nose. Taste is pretty simple for what it is, bubbly maltt smoothness, i guess that's a black and tan in a can. Good stuff for the price, better than expected.","chickencoop","0"

3.06,3.4,4,3,3,3,3,"Poured from a double-pint can into what else? Two pint glass for SWMBO and me. Nice amber-brown beer with a cream-colored head that fades to a persistent ring that doesn't leave much lacing behind. Aroma of malts and toffee, no hops yet. If I had to put this in a category, I'd lean more toward a session-ABV scotch ale. Lots of caramel and toffee, and the hops are only there in a supporting role. The body a little on the rich side for true sessionability. Over all not a bad effort, and a decent beer in a package that will get into places that ban glass bottles.","MillRat","May 27, 2010"
3.48,17.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability: surprisingly drinkable. The brewer claims this is a mix of a bock and a porter, and I believe it. As pre-mixed black & tans go, this beer fills the bill pretty well for me.","flagmantho","Apr 25, 2010"
2.42,-18.2,4,2,2,3,3,"I do NOT like the construct of these CANs! Short of inverting the CAN, beer drips down the side during the pour due to the placement of the opening. Wotta waste. Onward! My pour created a finger of thick light-tan head that sat like a cap above the beer. Color was a deep amber with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Color me impressed! Nose had a vinous sourness, like grapey vinegar. Oof. Mouthfeel was medium with a lot of off flavors vying for superiority on the tongue. These included that same grapey sourness, a metallic tang (nothing to do with the CAN), and a bitter chocolate flavor. Double oof. Finish was not quite as bad with the chocolate lingering along with a better dried fruit taste as of raisins of prunes. Overall, though, it was not going to replace Yuengling's B&T in my cooler. Next!","woodychandler","Apr 23, 2010"
1.89,-36.1,4,2.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"I could get past three mouthfuls before it went into the sink. Even the wife couldn't stand more than one. Little body, bad finish that tasted of metal.","WolfKeeper","Apr 18, 2010"
2.23,-24.7,3,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Dark amber color with a small tan head with fair retention. Smells of malt with some cherries. Not a very strong aroma. The flavor is light, with watered down sour cherries and some sweet malt. Light bodied, with decent carbonation. Not the worst beer I have had, but I will not be seeking this out again.","hardy008","Apr 01, 2010"

2.9,-2,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of roasted malt, yeast, tart malt, grain, and slight metallic. Barley fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level and noticeable tartness. Tastes of yeast, metallic, slight hops, slight roasted malt, and some grain. Overall, the grain and tart flavors are too off-putting.","Tone","Jun 02, 2009"
3.08,4.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Overall, this is no brown ale. It was kind of sour. It wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't to the style. If I want a brown, I will get some surly.","mothman","Mar 11, 2009"

2.17,-26.7,2,2.5,2,2.5,2,"I like brown ales. Truly, I do. But this has got to be one of the poorest excuses for a brown ale that's on the market. It has a rotten taste and it smells bad. 'nuff said. Some of the other Cold Spring beers are ok, but this one is not.","Strand","Nov 28, 2008"
2.67,-9.8,3,3.5,2,2.5,3,"#3 in the five pack sampler. another brew that might be a step forward for cold spring...but they might have to go back and rework this one.","budgood1","Oct 22, 2008"
4.26,43.9,3,4.5,4.5,4,4," ~ I will be the first to say I am not a fan of brown ales. However, this brew has offered me a new light. I've said to those who don't care for stouts and porters that they need to try one that's very good before they'll realize how much they like them. This is apparently true also with the brown ale. Thank you Cold Spring Brewing Company. And please tell the Clements family, ""hello and Chris hopes to see you all this winter.""","cdkrenz","Oct 10, 2008"
4.17,40.9,3.5,4,4,4,5,"Overall: Real good stuff, as expected from this brewery in general. This is probably my favorite of any of their selections.","Psilo707","Oct 08, 2008"
3.65,23.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Nice auburn tone. Clarity is pretty good. Thin creamy head of light beige froth. Lacing is moderate in amounts. Some dark malts on the aroma with a dusting of cocoa and roast. Here's another even keeled easy drinker from Cold Springs with decent, but not bold, flavor traits. Once again, very light hints of chocolate and cocoa. A little roasted malt character too. Brown malt comes to mind too. A little chalky. Nothing ""off"" about these beers from Cold Spring anymore, but nothing that really grabs my attention either. That said, I'll put em back no prob if offered to me.","Bighuge","Jun 14, 2008"
3.38,14.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Moonlight Ale is another step forward for a brewery trying to distance themselves from the disaster that was Gluek. It's always nice to see a company who is looking to improve their products. This one is at least worth a single or two.","BuckeyeNation","May 19, 2008"
4.23,42.9,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hmmm...this is definately not an American Brown Ale but more like a Euro dark lager or bock. Here's why. Appearance is a clear ruby-brown with an off-white head that settles to a thin ring around the edges. Aroma is a faint caramel blended with barely a hint of noble hops. Taste is a wonderful burst of bready malt full of caramel and melanodins found in Euro dark lagers. Restrained noble hop flavor and bitterness allows those malts to step forward. It finishes smooth and a bit dry so that the sweetness is not overpowering. I could drink about 4 or 17 more of these. Like I said, this is surely in the wrong category of American Brown Ale and definately worth seeking out if you like malty dark lagers.","beerkittycat","Apr 26, 2008"
3.06,3.4,4,3,3,3,3,"The Cold Spring website states this beer is a blend of a porter using Cascade hops as bittering and Tettnang hops for aroma and a bock using Mt. Hood hops. Seems to be an odd combination.","morimech","Beers"
1.83,-38.2,2.5,2,1.5,2,2,"Crisp and dry mouthfeel. Carbonation is good, but it's very light bodied. Not the best brown. Maybe it was the glacial mineral water. Would not drink again.","KeefD","0"
