"Not a bad buy for $3.50 a quart, but not something I'm itching to buy again.  The bottle presentation is pretty neat though, and it would be nice to bring to a picnic."

"Very smooth crisp taste, dark amberish color.  Very enjoyable, I feel it is underrated."

"32 ounce screw capped bottle.  Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear ruby red/brown color with not quite an inch light tan head.  Head retention is decent enough, and there's an OK amount of lacing.  The brew smells like toffee, tea, and grainy malt.  It tastes like grainy/bready malt, caramel, toffee, tea and some herbalness.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and is easy to drink.  It's better than I thought it would be.  $2.99 for a quart of this isn't too bad at all.  For the price, it's certainly worth a try!"
"Quart bottle from Plantation Total Wine - expected more from this...not very robust with wierd (chemical ?) finish..."

"Pours a nice dark amber color, has a nice cocoa, malt smell and light mouth feel. Decent easy drinking beer."
"Color is a bit weak. Almost like an amber. Good flavor.  A little nutty. Reminds me more of a Brown Ale than a Black & Tan. definitely a Saranac product (has that ""signature Saranac flavor""). That's not very technical, but anyone familiar with Matt's beers knows what I mean."
"Mississippi Mud Black & Tan brewed by Mississippi Brewing Co., with an ABV of 5.0% This brew pours out a nice light brown color with a nice off white head. It reminds me of sweet tea, in color. The smell is rich with flavor, you pick up on grains and malts. There is a nice mild sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The smell is real inviting, you also pick up on some caramel malts.  Now for the taste, it is bold with flavor.  A mild sweetness at first.  You pick up on malts, and mild roasted grains.  There is a lot going on in this brew, but it is smooth. The mouthfeel is smooth, but rich with flavor.  Mississippi Mud Black & Tan has a real nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5. Mississippi Brewing Co., did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again."
"A drinkable black and tan. Caramel notes with clean finish."
""
""
""
"I am glad I gave the Mud a second chance. It's not the most complex beer around, but it really is a decent alternative to macro lagers. It pours with a bit fizzy head that retreats to the edges of the glass and lingers. There is a fair amount of caramel malt in the flavour, with a bit of Pilsner zest in the mouthfeel. I would agree that it is a far cry from a pub Black and Tan, but for the price and overall packaging, it's worth picking up from time to time."

"O - 2.75 - This beer would make a fine transition beer from domestic brews to more craft-oriented beers. This would also make a killer, summer day session chugging beer, right out of the bottle. This beer isn't bad, but it isn't necessarily good either, just ""okay"". For an anywhere near seasoned beer drinker, you won't be impressed. But the price tag on it is CHEAP, the bottle is AWESOME and it would be worth grabbing if you're looking for a decent beer to chug down or keep a few around to session on."
"Great beer and reasonably priced"
"A lot better than expected."
"It was smooth and flavorful."
""
"Not the best reviews for this one, but I like it. interesting taste."
""
"Reviewed because I must do so."
""
""
"Seemed more like a plain ol' brown ale to me.  Nice malt flavors with a touch of roastiness and toastiness.  Oddly, I seem to like it more now than I did when I tried it way back in the day.  Enjoyable, if not spectacular."
""
"I remember thinking this was something special before I knew anything about beer. I brought one of these bad boy jugs to a St. Patty's day party. I'm glad those days are behind me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Agreed with other posters that you can do better poured from a tap at a bar.  This beer is good, not great but not bad.  The jug itself looks cool on my bar."
""
"First off, this is nowhere near like a Black & Tan you might order at a pub.  But overall, it's an OK beer.  The mouth feel is very light.  I kind of liked this because it isn't heavy like some porters.  But it is confusing as I was expecting something heavier given the flavor.  You get a hint of nuttiness from the porter but the lightness of a pilsner."
""
"In reading the other reviews here, it is evident those who appreciate exactly what it is; and for the money, I certainly can not complain! Especially since the craft beer craze is demanding what I believe is too much money for average to below average tasting brews. I don't know who is pricing things this high; is it the brewer, the distributor,  the retailer, or all the above? Of course $1.99 isn't high for a full pint of pretty decent black and tan blend. I would actually rate this higher than the Yuengling's version as Yuengling was my first regular store-bought B&T until I discovered Mississippi Mud and how good it tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ruby red, amber color. Flavor is mostly chocolate. Otherwise, a somewhat unbalanced mess. I'd like to try to base beers seperately to see if they're any good one their own."
""
"Price is ok, just don't expect much….I will try the Yuengling in this style also, but again, these are better freshly poured off tap."
""

"Saw this many times but never picked one up.  Picked it up this time, let's give it a whirl.  Unscrewing the top I get a nice smell of cocoa and sweet malt.  Pours to a dark root beer color with a tan head that hangs on for a while.  On the taste the brew hits upfront with a nice heavy mouthfeel.  Continuing the taste the brew has a a distinct dryness of the cocoa from the porter and the pilsner.  Sweet and slightly bitter when it kicks in then the finish is very dry and clean with only mild lingering bitterness.  Very refreshing when one is in the mood for a porter but not the heavy syrupy wallop that it packs.  Also I like the cool bottle, as it reminds me of a growler that always contains good brew, the real beer (32 oz) size."

""
""
"It looks, smells, tastes and feels like a solid 3.5 out of 5."
""
""
""
""
"Very tasteful beer for the value. Picked up a growler for 4 bucks and it looks cool! I love Black and Tans and this was perfect for saving the pouring out of two different beers. Great for when you want a Black and Tan at home without putting forth the effort to make it yourself."
""
""

"Overall: this is a start up beer. Just a smooth easy drink that will be pleasing to the new beer drinker."
""

"The Porter and Pilsner mix just didn't work. I seemed to get the hops from the Porter first and the finish from the Pilsner and the finish was a problem. There was very little aroma and the carbonation was very light. I would not buy this again. The color was the best part of this brew."
"I find this beer to be really refreshing. It has a great combination of thick chewy mouthfeel from the porter and cold refreshing finish of a pilsner. If you looking for a hop bomb this one isn't for you. However if your a fan of a solid mix beer with good malt flavor and a smooth finish give this a try."
""
"Pours a dark black color with ample carbonation. Smell is mostly hops. Taste is smooth no one taste is over powering. Watery mouth feel, easy to drink this one. Nothing too exciting but there is nothing apalling about this beer either. Very good price at 2.99 for a quart at Trader Joe's."

"The packaging is outstanding! The quart size glass bottle has the shape and appearance of a porcelane jug. The screw-on cap has a rubberized gasket so the beer can be partially consumed (why one would do that, is beyond me) and the remaining beer saved for later."

"Pours a deep rich dark brown in color with a good 1-2 finger off-white head that settles down to a thin layer on top and sides of the glass. A good amount of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. The taste has even more going of with a hint of toffee along with the above flavors but is more mellow than the aroma. Perfect carbonation that wasn't over done. No harsh or bitter aftertaste is noted for the finish."

".I bought this beer because it is inexpensive and had an awesome bottle. It tastes great with a nice malty and chocolately base. The off smell was a bit off putting but the flavor makes up for it. I would buy this one again great value for the price and awesome reuseable bottle ."

"This beer doesn’t quite fit the title. I think Mississippi dirt might be more appropriate."
""

"Conclusion: In a world where a gimmicks are needed, otherwise nobody would purchase your product. This is a great introduction to the craft beer world. The bottle is appealing, the taste is light, not too much of everything, but just enough for the starter."

"Simple yet refreshing. Although the smell was lacking, it more than made up for it with taste. I love a good black and tan and I thought for the price I got it (4.99 for a quart) that it was well worth it. Good heavy notes in the beginning leading to a nice crisp finish. I paired it with some pulled pork and homemade mac and cheese and I thought it complemented the meal nicely. And there was enough for an after dinner drink as well."

"O- Overall, this beer is pretty good. I kept eyeing it at the store for years and finally bought it today. It's enjoyable to drink it at night."
""
"Marketing wise this is a very fun beer, coming in a glass mini-growler, shrink wrapped in a tan label featuring black old fashioned font and an illustration of an alligator sitting between the copy. Poured into a pilsner glass, the color is a wonderfully reddish brown with some garnet highlights, a quickly dissipating head and perfect clarity. Aroma is predominantly of caramel malts, roasted grain, cereal; some hops detected at the finish, noble and slightly spicy. The taste is light, malty, and follows the nose very faithfully. Grainy, sweet, caramel and bread, some roastiness, very little hop flavor detected. Mouthfeel is medium-thin and highly carbonated. I'm sure this brew gets a bad rap from being ubiquitous and somewhat small in flavor. The aroma is definitely the best part but it is still a very enjoyable and pleasant session beer that I don't turn my nose up to and would definitely drink again."
""
""
""
"I truly love this beer as I love all porters and pilsners,so it would only stand to reason that I would love them together.this beer was one of my first experiences with craft beer,since then my palate has grown much larger but this beer is special to me.i like to drink this in the fall and winter as it goes well with cold nights by a fire.it drinks easy but has enough substance to keep you coming back,this a good beer for someone to step outside the box with for the first time."
""
""
""
"Mississippi Mud pours an opaque brown color with very little head. There is a light and mellow roasted malt aroma. The taste has a nice roasted malt flavors, that is very crisp as well. Lighter body, but nice carbonation, and nice feel. Overall its very tasty, its like a nice crisp easy drinking porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out to a nice off-white head and brown color. Aroma is a delicious blend of nuts, caramel, toffee and chocolate malt. Flavor is less impressive but good with toasty grains and some pilsner-like hop notes and grainy flavors in there as well. Mouthfeel is light-medium to make it easy drinking. Overall, a decent party brew in a convenient quart package."
""
""
""
"O. Overall this is alway one of the beers that I'll pick up if I see it in the cooler and while it's not a ""go-to"" beer its definitely in it's own league."

"Just had the 1 liter bottle, it has a great taste and for only having 5% ABV it actually feels like a higher content. Good job to those who made a great beer. I would recommend it to all of my friends. I just wish the cost wasn't so high. Other than that keep up the good work and I am looking forward to buying some more of your beer."
"The feel takes more of the pilsner character; it's about a medium body, but focuses on a bright sort of crispness and sturdy, consistent carbonation."

"I wish I knew more about the pilsner and the porter used in this bottle half and half. The beer was okay with my pizza. I poured into a pint jar, the color was dark but not dense, the head was small, quarter an inch. I poured from the 1 quart jug which is a nice novelty, the gator is a nice touch. Beer was decent, but not remarkable. I could drink a couple."
""
""
""
"Finally, I would like to note this is my first beer review ever. PLEASE let me know how I did and or, how I can improve...CHEERS!"
""
""
""

"The Mississippi Mud is an interesting combination of beer....porter and pilsner. The porter provides roast, peat and mild dark chocolate. The pilsner provides grassy like hops and bitterness. Put them together and you have a decent balanced beer that is easy drinking and sessionable. This beer is probably better drank in the cooler spring, fall and winter days. Additionally this beer would go well with spicier foods. Overall a good beer and worth a try."

"I used to drink this beer in North Carolina. It's a good combination of porter and pilsner beers, unusual in my opinion for black and tans as in my experience they are stout and lager like Guinness and Harp. Still, it's very tasty and amusing in name being brewed in Utica, New York."
""
""
"Distinct coffee, chocolate flavors. Sharp bite at the end. The coffee hits first and last. The chocolate taste is there but not overpowering. Nice brown head that holds the glass reasonably well. I enjoyed this beer and will purchase it again."

"one of my favorite beers i tried it once because it was on sale and was real suprised if you like dark beers this is 1 to try. not too pricy, its got a cool jug, and doesnt really go flat or taste bad warm 250 characters is kinda long so iguess i will end it with SCREW FLANDERS"

"Carbonations is lame, so when the muds in ya you know we aint drinking no soda pop. FACT. Lets be honest, if I'm at a party and I got a fist full of mud, shes getting laid. You wont catch me sippin the watered down taste of a peat bog type of brew such as busch lite or others. No pansy IPAs eitha, only that real, raw, smooth, the taste of a Mangrove lagune, canoe gliding ontop of a soup of brown and black clouds. It picked me up like a dust storm in eastern Washington and when that sappy nectar finally endured it's last drop, me and my bussdown were thoroughly pleased, and pleasured. By the mud, see when you give yourself to something bigger than you, you fall back into the mud and let the dirt slowly seep over your body and brown out your sight. It's as if you could go to the local WinCo and pick out an untainted 18 year old virgin, fresh out of high school with everything a pimp knew to, out of a line of well past their golden years milfs, pregnant teenage junkies, and overweight soccer moms looking for some love. That is Mississippi Mud my friends, it's as if mother earths loins were split on the rim of your lips and she let out a stream foggy as the winding meander dumping silts and sands carried from foreign lands down to Mississippi Delta."

"Overall - Starts off great, but sip after sip becomes a bit of a struggle, as the funky metallic flavor muddles up all the good porter character that's present to begin. Halting the drinkage for a few minutes and allowing the bland metallic flavor to dissipate does help to get back to square one, but is it really worth it? It's not all that great to begin with. Props on one of the coolest bottles in the industry, though!"
"This is a very drinkable and thirst quenching beer. But, it offers nothing to really stand out in my memory except the cool and collectable ceramic jug. Find a wash board and a thimble and you are halfway to the making of the next great hipster ""string band."""
""
""
""
"Taste is pleasant, firm, but simple sweet caramelly-toasty barley, light almost root-beer-like woody-grassy bitterness. Feel is a bit thin and nondescript."
"Overall not as bad as I expected it to be. It has the dark malty flavours but is also light and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good example of a black and tan but this style is longing for some expierimentation by the bigger, better breweries. The bottom line is that this is not something memorable enough to come back too."
"i also like the bottle, its a pretty cool design and reminds me of the old moonshine bottles. this brew is pretty easily attainable. most package stores that have craft brews will have this."
""
""

"Found the beer at local deli. I tried it with friends and found it almost perfect. Better to drink from goblet. Nice brown color with tan head. Flavor mellow, taste rich and full, smooth and creamy texture. When in tall glass taste will change as beer is consumed. Smoother than a stout and clean mouth with no after taste. I like it and continue to buy. Thanks for a great product. Keith"

"O- I can kinda see why this is so popular among non-craft drinkers but it just leaves me wanting more of the porter side and less of the pilsner."
"O: This beer does not have much complexity in the flavors but its light body makes it very easy to drink."
"O: This beer is nothing special but it is certainly not offensive either. The last time I had this beer, I was still an undergrad and thought this was quality craft beer - how much the world has changed in the last 20 years, especially in my appreciation of good craft beers. Easy to drink but not something I really want to have more than one during a session. Not sure I will get this one again but it was a nice walk down memory lane."

"I picked up a jug of this from Woodman's in Rockford, IL in summer 2012. Pours a medium brown color with an off white foamy head. Scent is fairly malty as is the taste. Has an overall pretty dry taste but has some nice caramel hints as well. Texture is average as to be expected. Just a reasonable 32 oz jug of beer in a more rare to find style. Probably one of the more plentiful black and tan beers on the market."
"very smooth, good color, nice looking bottle. It is easy to find at carryout stores in our area. Price is very good @ 2.99 a quart. It is well with-in my price range and very tasty. A dark beer with no heavy after taste. you should give this beer a try if you are into dark or great tasting smooth brew."

"I'm kind of shocked to see such low reviews on this beer. I live in Rhode Island and for some reason we cannot get this beer up here anymore. It's very disappointing to me because this was one of my all time favorite beers! I loved everything about this brew. The taste was awesome, the smell was great, there was no nasty after taste and it had a pretty cool looking little growler! I hope some day we get this back up here. Truly a great beer in my opinion and I miss it."

"Overall: Honestly, it's kind of what I expected. It's not horrible and i can drink it but I really bought it because it was cheaper to buy the beer and growler than just the growler alone, kind of like how cassette tapes of Hanson were cheaper than blank cassette tapes."
"All in all, it was a worthwhile investment, but not likely something I'll pick up again."
""

"Ok i saw the reviews, and I am a dark beer drinker, or a brown ale. So when i saw this bottle in the local market, I thought to myself very cool design. Yea the taste afterwards is not to good, it's not a real black n tan. But is a good beer, and when i brought it to a party i was going to alot of people commented on it, some who took a drink said it's ok..and others didnt like but thos ppl where the ones who where drinking Natural Ice beer. I mean wtf..come if i wanted something that came out yellow then i would of.. well you know where i was going with it..But now I dont even see this beer in any market.."

"attractive 32 oz jug from Fred Meyer,N.Salem. $3.78. Wow been years since i saw this one..used to drink it now and again in the late 1990s in Atlanta. I cant remember it being this colour..its a plain darkish amber beer with a large rocky light tan head. Plain but not unpleasant caramel/light chocolate malt aromas. Taste is very plain..some toffee, some caramel and a slight hint of black coffee in the end. Thin on the palate but not horrid. Overall its drinkable."
"O: Decent enough. I could see polishing off one or two of these at a party. Nothing that'll wow you but not bad for just kicking around."

"O-This is very average. Nothing to hate about it but nothing to love. probably will not be having this one again."
""
""
""
"Overall - Don't get me wrong it's by no means offensive in any way, but the flavor is just not there! You'd think that with 2 distinct styles put together that it would create a unique flavor, but instead it just comes off as a boring beer. It's easy to drink, but that's pretty much the only good quality that stands out."
"M: The chocolate and breadiness own the beer, hardly a porter/pilsener combination. Easy drinking though. And a great bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Goes down ok, sort of tasty, not filling, mild kick, average representation of style. I admit - I like simple styles, but this beer bored me and didn't have all that much going for it."
""
"While I had restrained expectations that this would somehow approximate a true Black and Tan in flavor and texture, I did not have any serious belief that this would look like a properly poured Black & Tan at your local beer joint. The appearance was a darker copper, the head was not all that noticible and what did appear vanished rather quickly. On the nose this beer has a light essence of roasted malts, some faint coffee notes and that's about it - not too complex of an aroma with this beer. On tasting this beer the simplicity of the aromas carried through to the taste....some roasted malt flavors...very little hop character which could have provided this beer with a wee bit more depth. The finish was brief...as in barely noticable. All in all a pretty average beer, but still drinkable and would be wotthwhile for a party beer to get the conversation going about the bottle if nothing else."
"M- Very smooth and silky. Just the right amount of carbonation. Weight on the palate is perfect for the style. A very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:Good because its cheep and the bottle turns into a growler you can use at your local brew pub."
"Taste, semi-sweet, kind of thin bodied, no discernable hop presence. Really just kind of dark in color without submitting any real malt flavor component to the palate. Kind of reminiscient of a better looking Newcastle brown ale. This is lots more tan than black."
"Overall: not the best black and tan but definitely a go to beer if you spot this in your local beer cooler. Hope you have all enjoy, Salud.!"

"overall: cool container. would look neat at a party. mild taste. would drink again (no offending tastes or smells), but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
""
""
"Picked up a quart bottle on a whim and drank in a regular pilsner glass. Dark brown with a thick tan head. Smell was a bit musty with a touch of chocolate. Tasted like a weak porter to me with a bit of a bite at the finish. Just a nice drinking beer but nothing to get worked up about."
"Avoid this beer unless you just want to collect a pretty cool bottle."
""
"Not a real enjoyable beer. Seems to be more of a gimmick than anything. I would recommend avoiding this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well, pretty drinkable, but doesn't taste all that good. Best thing about this one was the nice novelty bottle. I picked it up only because I didn't want a six pack of anything at the store and cans of Fosters wasn't doing it for me either. Not recommended."

"Overall: A knockout, in my opinion. I absolutely loved it."

"Porter and pilsner? It's neither this or that. Lacking on both fronts, but it wasn't completely awful. It's not as completely terrible as I remember from my college days. Tastes mostly similar to dunkel lager, or maybe a brown ale like Newcastle. I'd rather do this than Bud, or any kind of Genesee beer. This is really so much about the novelty of the packaging. I can't imagine any other reason someone would buy this."
"O: I bought for the bottle, wouldn't buy again. Some positives in the taste, but the smell is enough to ruin it for me."
"I recommend this beer as a gag gift, but it is far from a ""get."""
"Despite my skeptical outlook, the beer was surprisingly palatable."
"By the end, it's a bit tiring. No. Not a good beer, even though it may look that way until you put it in your mouth."
"D - Decent, but pretty watery. Probably not worth another try. Cool bottle though."
"O - I prefer to have black and tans that are not pre-made. However, this is a decent try at the style. The best part of this was scoring a 32oz bottle of this for $3.00. Haven't had this one in about 10 years, and although my palate has moved on this is still a novelty to try."
"o: what i expected for three dolllars a quart. mainly bought it for the bottle."
"M – Nice carbonation. A light, but not watery, body lends a nice degree of drinkability."
"PP (Price Point) - $7 for a Quart at a restaurant is cool with me, nothing to write home about."
"2.5 D: This reminds me of a typical Saranac brew. Decent appearance and watered down everywhere else. I can say that this is probably a fabulous gateway beer though. The packaging and mild flavors are sure to please."
"O: It's actually pretty good for the price. I wanted a little more flavor out of the deal though. There wasn't a whole lot of ""umph"" to this beer, and I think I was really expecting a little more of that. Tasted more like a pilsner than a porter; like 70/30. I had hoped the ratio would have been opposite to that; 70% porter taste and 30% pilsner taste."
"Final Notes: I can pour myself a much better black and tan than this. It's an interesting concept (a premixed black and tan) but it fails to capture the true complexity and beauty of a layered beer."
"O-any self made black and tan will be better than this, for sure. it isn't bad though...its just boring, very boring. When i consider the fact i paid $3 for 32 ounces of this, there is nothing to dislike at all!"
"Possibly the best bottle presentation available on the market, hands down. From within, this stuff pours a clear light-ruby-brown topped by over a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises toffee, very light roasted malts, white bread, light wheat, and a touch of watered-down coffee. The taste re-examines these elements and adds in a touch of vague fruitiness (mostly akin to honeydew and mandarin orange, I think) in a streak, much like the white bit of Rogue's hair (yeah, I just went all comic book nerd on ya...). It's unexpected, but not really all that off-putting somehow. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta watery feel. Overall, a nice brew, nothing extremely special, but very drinkable. Probably one of the best pre-mixed black and tans on the market (in, as I've said before, the best packaging), however much that really says..."
"O: Not as good as I remember it from having it years ago, but that doesn't really surprise me. Not bad, fun to carry around and drink."
"The CpJ"
"Pours a clear cola brown color with a 1 inch beige head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random streaks of lace form down the glass on the drink down. Smells of sweet malt, mild fruitiness, and slight smoke. Taste is a subdued and watery version of the smell with a roasty flavor coming through on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a bubbly but smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer but it's super cheap at $2.49 for the mini-jug at Trader Joe's. Nothing horrible but nothing great here."
"I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because it's a cool looking bottle, I think. It pours a dark brown and black (makes sense) and doesn't release any particularly compelling aroma, but nothing unnerving either. Very carbonated. The head rises quickly before settling. A little extra flavor is noted if you tease it out with your buds, sort of stoutish, sort of lageryish. Its not unpleasant but I won't really seek it out either."
"Overall: This beer is not bad, but it's not really good either. The idea of this beer is very interesting, and it seems like the complex flavors of the porter and the delicious and flavorful hoppiness of the pilsner could come together for a wealth of complex enjoyment, but this beer doesn't do it. The flavors don't come out over each other or work together in any way, overall producing a rather mild, uninteresting beer without much character."
"Not something that I would show off to my friends, but still, acceptable."
"Moral of the story? Try it, don't expect too much, and be happy with your newly aquired piece of southern nostalgia."
"Overall, the bottle was better. All hype with nothing to write home about."
"O: pretty meh beer. It's available anywhere. Try it once and be done with it, because it's nothing special, but still worth drinking."
"Flavors are here and there, hard for me to remember now. Nothing dominates harshly or favorably."
"O - Nothing amazing, but a decent brew. The novelty of the container and the style itself are more of a draw than the flavor."
"I bought this because the bottle was awesome looking. I thought I'd enjoy this beer much more than I did. The beer is on the light side, not by color but by mouthfeel. I know it's a blend I just think ofnmud as being thick and I was expecting this to be like that too. The color is a dark yet transparent brown. Flavor had too much grass in it and not enough porter/stout."
"Taste-Faint chocolate note, toasted malt, faint hop note. Rather thin-bodied. Very easy to drink, but nothin' fancy. A nice entry-level craft beer for the newbie, or just something a little different from a macro-lager."
" There's nothing about this beer that warrants a return visit,just not much going on in the flavor department.Next."
"D - more drinkable than typical yellow beers but not as much as typical porters."
"Taste like nothing mixed with ash. Me no liky. It has a mild sweet character at the lead off like a some lagers might if you were bad at making them and then a super weak bitter ash at the end of the beer, no after taste, this is a tick and nothing more, not a repeat just a random beer I've never had."
"Drinkability is OK. This was decent to try once and would drink again if offered but not one to seek out."
"Overall, pre-mixed black and tans have never been a huge hit in my world but why not? Probably stick to Yeungling B&T if thats what you're into."
" ~ I'm surprised at the huge range in the reviews for the brew. I think may have allot to do with the lack of guidelines to follow with the style. Overall, I like it. My suggestion with this one is to not judge a book by the cover created with all the poor reviews."
"D never again!"
"overall pretty average, however the bottle is badass with a Alligator layin in some mud. cool"
"Pour yields a dense black brew with a short off-white head and a bit of lacing. The nose begins all the problems. First of all, mixing a porter and a pilsner does not yield a black and tan. Second, even judging this beer on its own, it tastes like a watered-down porter that wasn't any good to begin with. Nose brings forward a bit of roasted malt plus some slight notes of chocolate. Anything resembling hops--Noble or American--is completely lacking. The flavor is similarly plain and one dimensional, containing nothing other than a bit of roasted malt. Feel is thin and a bit watery. This is a bad beer."
"Overall it's ok. Don't know if I would buy it again but my roomate drinks these every once in a while so I won't say no if he offers."
"Notes: I am not really impressed with this Black and Tan and after drinking half of the quart I cap it back up to save for cooking. Its not a bad beer but its just not one that I wanted to keep on drinking when I have so many better beers on hand."
"Overall it was pretty good but definitely not the best."
"D: I personally can't stand the style but this wasn't too bad. It's fortunately weak enough to be somewhat drinkable."
"This is very good and very drinkable."
"Interesting can/cask. A pretty rust color with a thick tan head. Lightly roasted malt aroma is pleasant and inviting. Light malt flavor accompanied by a noticeable tinny, metallic taste followed by a decently clean and warm finish. A little flat. Very drinkable. Lacing is just okay."
"FourthBeer potential: LOW. Not the worst beer in the world, but for a beer that claims to be a combination porter and pilsner, it doesn't seem to have the best characteristics of either."
"Poured a transparent but dark brown with a decent off-white head that left some lacing. Smelled like Bud Light, but with a slight roasted/coffee tone. Very light flavor, adequate notes of a porter and AAL, but nothing standing out amongst the whole. Watery mouthfeel, and only a slightly roast in the aftertaste. I could drink this all afternoon at the rope swing, but why bother?"
"Addendum: It smells like shit."
"D - I would like to try just the porter. The finishing characteristics are far more appealing than that initial blast of adjunct lager. The packaging supersedes the product."
"Some of the best packaging I have seen to date. The bottle looks like a moonshine jug. A full quart (946ml) of beer. About a finger of head over a dark brown beer. The color of the beer matches a 24 on the SRM beer color chart. Aromas of maple, corn, wheat, chocolate and coffee. Tastes are flavors of coffee, malt, corn, and wheat. Not quite up to standards in the mouthfeel category, but still satisfying. I would drink another just because of the bottle, and the beer is not bad either."
"I don't give a Schlitz about this beer. However, the packaging was worth my $3.79."
"Not quite a true black and tan in the classical sense of the term. However, this beer was surprisingly smooth, with a ctisp bitter end to the sip. The beer has a nice light bown color, just the right amount of head and comes in a really unique moonshine style jug bottle. Well worth giving a try."
"Sucked in by packaging. Shouldn't this be a huge-ass gooey stout or something? Considering the name and everything. I don't mind a good black & tan once in a while, but this isn't one I'd return to again...I won't be finishing the rest of this novelty quart bottle/jug."
"D- Overall pretty drinkable. Does taste like a beer that combined a porter with a pilsner. Pretty good for the $3.50 I spent on it. Would pick up again."
"D: Trying to get through this one fairly quickly, this isn't something I particularly am enjoying. Needs higher carbonation and just more everything."
"D - I think the only reason this beer sells is because of the packaging. I paid too much for it and won't be making that mistake again. I guess I would take it over a Bud Light though."
"I've been seeing this at the local shop for a long time now and have always wanted to try it based on how much I like the bottle. I finally picked one up today and I'm wishing I had tried it a long time ago. Pouring into a glass mug creates a light, thick head atop very dark brown beer-quite an attractive brew. Odors of citrus and roasted caramel suggest that the lager and ale used to make this B&T are probably worthy of being enjoyed separately as well as together. The taste is creamy, roasted caramel with undertones of sweet citrus flesh. Mississippi Mud has a thicker, more pleasant body than other Black & Tans I've had."
"Wow, neat bottle...screw top to boot! Beer pours out with a very bubbly tan head, quite dark almost black color. Head then disspated into nothing with NO lacing whatsoever. Dang. Smells a bit sour almost stout-like, kinda reminds me of a Guinness smell, some dark roasted malts, almost peat like maltiness and some faint smoke. The taste, well, kinda reminds me of a Guinness as well, charred malts with some sweet malt in the center, and mild bitter aftertaste. I am not detecting much ""Continnental Pilsner"" in there, no noble hop, but the mouthfeel and effervescence is the giveaway. Much more active carbonation on the tongue than a regular stout from the pilsner base. Hmm, I am tasting some syrupiness too like a cheap pilsner, weird. Must have some adjuncts in there somewhere based on that corn syrup I just tasted. Overall an interesting brew, good conversation piece because of the jug bottle and obviously aimed at macro and Guinness fans alike. I would say it is actually somewhat drinkable once you can get past the adjuncts creeping through the brew."
"drinkability - easy drinking and the novelty jug might get me to buy this again"
"This beer is fine overall, but really nothing to write home about."
"The bottle alone is reason to try this.  It pours a cola brown with patches of froth that hang around for good time.Smells like a mellow porter, malty.Taste is okay not bad not great.It's got a decent feel, got some thickness to it. Goes down easy, but has a bit of an aftertaste."
"Mississippi Mud Black & Tan has a decent amber colour and a head that fades quickly but it maintains good lacing. The smell is of malt and some yeast. It has a weak maltiness to it that fades into a sour tang. This beer is pretty watery in the mouth but goes down ok."
"I have had this beer before and it was good. This time around its delicious!"
"This is easy enough to drink, but is really nothing special. It is however, a bit of a different take on a black and tan."
"D: I could definitely drink two of these bad boys on a cold winter night."
"Pours a very dark amber in color, a large head dies down to nothing. Not much of an aroma, just some malty notes. This beer falls a bit flat in the taste in my opinion. Grain, corn, a hint of porter influences and an off flavor reminiscent of adjuncts gone a bit stale. Theres also something alittle more unnerving, a wretched taste that I've never encountered in a beer before. The beer is interesting enough aesthetically and worth the buy for the cool ""bottle"" alone. The beer inside is just an odd mixture of pilsener, porter and astringency. Next time I'll pass."
"D: Decent drinkability though a jug (32oz) seems a bit excessive especially considering its sweet toasted nature at times."
"D: While quite drinkable and easy to drink, it's not particularly memorable, but it does come in a cool jug and was pretty cheap, $3.50 for 32 oz."
"Drink: All and all a decent beer and at $2.29/Qt. a good value. Based on the price others are quoting here I need to compliment the store owner where I buy beer."
"Cheers.."
"Mississippi Mud is a super clear deep crimson brown beer with a soft, foamy light khaki head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a slightly sweet, grainy aroma. It smells like malt extract with some roastiness. There are notes of coffee and chocolate. It's medium bodied, smooth and a little metallic. The clean, dry finish leaves the mouth a little dusty. It tastes a touch sweet and a little tangy. It's roasty, with notes of coffee and chocolate. It has just enough flavor to keep it interesting and not much bitterness at all. I haven't had one of these in about ten years, so I was kind of expecting to be disappointed with this beer. I wasn't. This is still a fun session beer."
"Notes: Really sweet, malty, nutty flavors. Weird mix of flavors and it doesn't really strike me as a black and tan given the mix of porter and pilsener. Not great and kind of weird, but for the price it might be worth trying."
"Overall, the part that kills drinkability for me isn't taste, it is mouthfeel. Still, no horrible brew by any means."
"This beer deserves better than a C+ rating, considering all of the other truly wretched beers that merit higher ratings on the site. It is a fairly light bodied, slightly watery, brownish ale. It doesn't have much heft to it, the taste is a bit more fruity than is warranted, and there is a slightly musty feel to it, and a slightly metallic cheap flavor in the finish. The beer has a slightly foamy head that doesn't lace nor retain for that long, but its okay. The nose is a bit over processed and more lagery than is warranted, but its okay. The beer is really an okay beer. There is enough brown ales and nutty flavors to keep it reasonably interesting. Am I rushing back to grab another no, do I think the marketing ""jug"" this comes in probably attracts more buyers than if this were in a straight bottle, definitely. Is this a beer you can enjoy without taking too seriously, yes. Enough said about this one."
"D - Pretty drinkable brew, thinner bodied but still drinkable. I drank the entire jug but sitting at 5.00% it was very easy to do so. I got it from my Dad as a gift but I would go out and get this brew. I recommend people trying it at least once!"
"D: Light and non filling for being half porter. But not the most tasty beer combination. Not a huge fan."
"Try it if you would like, but get ready to be disappointed by a sub-par beer with very little flavor."
"Drinkability: this beer is alright, but I don't love it. There are better-executed premixed black & tans out there."
"Even so, this beer is decent for what it is. Inexpensive, it tastes fine (but not exceptional) and looks fine, too."
"D: After swirling 4, normally 2 so... I'll give it a 3."
"D: actually drank very good like I remember cause I use to drink this beer all the time when I was in high school which was 10 years ago. I honestly start blending alll kinds of beers after drinking this one; gooding looking out MM."
"Overall a cheaply priced probably cheaply made beer. Not better than something one could make at home with two high quality beers to mix, but worth the $3.89 for a quart of this stuff. Plus, I don't usually care about this, but the bottle is pretty cool."
"As was to be expected, this is a veritable mish-mash of two distinct styles - the heavier, more complex porter, and the lighter, crisper Pils. While nothing really offends, there seems to be a bit of a confusing experience to drinking this hybrid - but maybe if I didn't know that going in, it would just be perceived as a nice, drinkable, mildly complex, sour, and plainly hoppy dark ale. Or not."
"Given the large number of negative reviews (regardless of scores), the relatively low overall score and the schlocky but amusing packaging; I wasn't expecting much. But how can you turn down a chance at this ""Famous Black & Tan Beer""? However, I was very pleasantly surprised. Mississippi Mud managed to take a style that I'm not particularly fond of (English porter), and a style that pales in comparison to other richer styles (pilsener), and created a fine beverage. At ten cents an ounce, plus another dime for the tacky/cool bottle (Michigan deposit), you get an excellent value. I'll go back for more tomorrow."
"Taste is not very good, this is a bad idea. It tastes like the porter portion of the beer was not very good to start with, a little astringent and not much roast, chocolate or coffee...all tasty components of good porters. There is the light fruitiness and flashes of some darker malts that keep this thing at least more interesting than your average macro. The light lager just seems to further thin out and water the beer down. A guinness and a bass definitely make a better Black & Tan than this. Cool packaging, uninspiring beer."
"D:I Find this beer very drinkable and would buy agian 3 quarts went down rather fast with out feeeing full I may not go out and buy another case this weeek or even this mounth but still will revisit this one agian in the future."
"Its a quart of some decent creamy brew in an awesome jug for about 3.99, give it a try."
"Overall I thought this was decent enough for what seemed like a gimmick beer. Like a light stout or light porter."
"Poured into a pint glass. It has a very clear deep brown color. There was about a finger of fairly white head. There is a very strong malty sweet smell. It is a little too sweet smelling. There are some underlying caramel notes as well. Luckily the taste is a little less sweet than the aroma. It still has a very sweet malty taste, but toned down a little bit. Overall it is dominated by the malts and there is a some noticeable hop notes toward the end of the sip. This is an okay beer. Nothing special or surprising."
"This beer is not the best of the Black and Tans. Its a bit too light for the style, the taste is somewhat watery, as if somebody mixed a porter with a macro lager, I detect a slight roastiness in it. Mouthfeel is light bodied, and its just mediocre in terms of drinkability."
"Very nice for a pre-made black and tan. it is not going to overwhelm you and might be a good one to start out with if you are not accustomed to this style. I believe it is made as a porter/pilsner mix so they taste or mouthfeel is too much. try this and a guinness/bass will won't be a big leap for you."
"(Sampled several months ago and reviewed from notes. I thought I had already reviewed this but then noticed I had either never entered the review or it was lost somehow.)"
"Very interesting jug of a bottle. Poured dark amber color with a medium white head that diminished slowly with fair lacing. Medium malt and sweet aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium flavor of roasted malt and sweet with a short finish. Below average combo."
"Poured out of the 946 ml stylized jug bottle (remember Georgia Moon, guaranteed less than 60 days old?) into a cheap plastic drinking glass. Thin head that went away quickly. The smell promises some sort of standard beer. The taste is of a standard lager with attempts to enhance with more hoppy and malty flavor, maybe like the good old days of dark beer on tap, say dark Brew 66 or dark Oly. Pleasant buzz after the first 10 ounces, but this being 5%, I'm sure it's the same pleasant buzz found after a Bud or Miller. Aftertaste is almost nonexistent, which is a better result than some of the other reviews I read here. I'd have to say it probably is worth the less than $4 paid, and certainly not disappointing. This is good stuff for watching your football or action movies. Get two jug bottles, one for the first half and one for the second half."
"F: A slight sweet flavor mixes with a lingering roasted malt flavor to stick around for a while. Finishes pretty clean though, similar to a light ale. The roasted malt adds a nice flavor, and the light malts add a nice finish. It lacks a little in the aroma and body, which is probably what the light malts take away from the darks."
"This beer should be market below average, but I guess I'm happy I got it...no not really. half of it sat in the fridge for a month before I threw it out. Couldn't even drink it all in one sitting, what a shame."
"Poured from a jug like 32 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and slightly sweet. Taste is mild, some notes of chocolate and malts, not a whole lot of flavor. Feels creamy in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this is an enjoyable beer."
"Pours a clear brown color. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of pale malt, slight hop, yeast, and slight adjunct. Much stronger in smell of a pilsner not the porter. Fits the style of a Black & Tan. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, slight roasted malt, some grain, and slight adjunct. Overall, better body and flavor than aroma, but it would be vastly improved with a better quality pilsner as the 'tan'."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer overall, but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"Overall, the novelty of this beer wore off as soon as I started drinking it, realizing that the beer inside would never be as cool as the bottle it comes in. I'll keep the bottle, but won't purchase this again."
"D: Overall fairly drinkable, the bottle is classic. But a great beer this is not. Good for a backyard BBQ, or as a cheap alternate to More Macro type beers. But I am not going to be buying cases of this."
"Overall I really don't know much about Black and Tans. What I do know is they are best served mixed by yourself. If you must buy the premade stuff pick this up the next time you see it. Not really a bad beer but for me having a bottle a sitting for around 4 bucks is a treat as well as a good deal"
"[Drinkability]: Couldn't drink anymore, it's watery and has a weird aftertaste."
"I must say, I personally think Trader Joes is good but mostly bad for the beer biz. The good is that you find some pretty odd stuff, and when your wife is trying to impress you, she can pick up something that you pretty much would not find or grab at your local bottle shop, but the bad is the cheapening of some better local brews and some bad private label stuff, and questionable code dates. On that note, this beer is a pretty entry level. It pours dark but taste light. There is no head, the aroma is malty but generic. Mouthfeel is all malt with a long sweet finish. Drinkability is ok, the beer is tasty but not much there. This is the beer that your buddy that drinks alcopops brings to a beer dinner, no offense, but the bottle sold him on this and now I have to drink it, thanks chukko."
"Drinkability/overall- not very tasty. drinkable, but not for the taste. watery."
"I was at at a big beer store and found the cute little brown jug.I picked it up for $2.99 and left in in the fridge for a month or so. Curious I cracked the twist cap and poured a very attractive dark amber beer with very little head. The smell is a little coffee alcohol note. Taste was nice and the after taste as slightly bitter. Over all its a nice little brew and worth the money. Is not a black and tan but is drinkable. I may pick up another jug and keep it for conversation with friends."
"As for me this is probably my last trip to Mississippi to play in the Mud."
"D: Meh, just meh."
"D: Goes down smoothly. Would be good at a bbq on a hot day. Although it's supposed to be a black and tan its pretty light and refreshing. And I would say serve it cold cause warming in my jar didn't do much for the overall flavor."
"Drinkability: Versatile and highly drinkable with a meal or in mass quantities"
"D - Not bad for what it is. The idea of a bottled black and tan is a bit pointless since you just end up with a brown ale, but this is a decent brown ale. Nothing special, but drinkable and better than most beers that come in a 32oz, screw-top bottle. It is interesting to note that the Mississippi Brewing Co is in Utica, NY; kind of like salsa from New York City I guess."
"But brought back some memories; hasn't lost its drinkability and would keep some in my fridge during the summer months as a darker beer with some character that acts like a light beer"
"Conclusion: Meh..."
"Poured a clear, red-brown mahogany color with tall, light brown foam that persisted and left some lace as it contracted. The smell was of caramel and cocoa with a bit of grain. The taste was sort of woody and herbal with some chocolate and cocoa and dry caramel. There was almost a whisky barrel taste upfront. Not much in the way of hop flavors. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp with medium body and roasty malt note lingering, with a somewhat woody aftertaste. This was an OK beer at a good, low price."
"Overall, this is a pretty good hybrid beer. It's dark and rich enough to have some body and flavor, and yet refreshing enough for a hot summer day. If you're looking for the traditional Guinness/Smithwicks black and tan, this ain't it, but if you want a nice session beer with a little character, this will serve nicely."
"Drinks very well, solid brew."
"D: Definitely. There's really no bite to this beer, and, like it or not, that makes it very easy to drink a lot of."
"Stay away. Far, far away."
"The most boring beer ever. There is no porter in this, maybe a weak pilsener was used to wash out a weak brown ale, but there are no interesting flavors, it is the blandest beer I have ever drank, I think the Heinz corporation had something to do with this."
"Overall- It's tough to review a pre-made black and tan as normally it's something that gets mixed at the tap as a bit of a niche drink. This bottled version wasn't overly impressive."
"Overall, I recommend this beer. If you find it, it's worth having. It goes well when watching a movie too."
"This is a very easy drinking Black and Tan. The jug rates a 5!"
"Pours a dark brown color with good hea formation and lacing. Smell was not strong and smelled of dark fruits, figs, raisins and etc. Taste was of a dark ale with dark fruits being very prominent over the malt and other flavors. Though the Dark Fruit was not powerfull. Mouthfeel was not bad and the carbonation was pretty minimal. I would probably not purchase this for a little while as this beer just didn't hit spot for me."
"Overall - Not too bad. Better than expected actually."
"Not something I would not seek out again. The cheap price ($3/quart) and flashy bottle is, apparently, the marketing strategy of this beer, clearly not the repeat costumer."
"This beer goes down smooth and has a nice porter feel to this beer but alot of the flavor is a bit muted."
"Beer poured into a Guinness imperial pint glass forms a fluffy off white 3 finger head. Beer exhibits a gorgeous, dark mohagany color. Smell is disappointing, doesn't smell bad, but can't detect much other than some faint malts. Taste starts with some nice malts and then everything just disappears. Almost like a movie where the first 10 minutes is great and then everything else disappoints. Beer is light bodied and smooth. A simple, easy to drink beer and that's about it."
"Looked promising enough, except that the only thing Mississippi about it is the name. Utica NY? Pours a nice foamy head then quickly dies to thin thin lace. Aroma is malty and chocolate. Taste is roasted malts some sweetness. Some weird aftertaste that's not pleasant. Not recommended."
"Is it just me, or does this taste like Schlitz Malt Liquor? Or Olde English 800? Or, well, you get the idea. Swampy smell and taste. Nothing like the package suggests. ""Continental Pilsner""?, ""robust English Porter""? My arse. Definitely won't buy again, BUT will keep the bottle. Very cool bottle."
"A promising start but it turned out to be a drain pour. Never again!"
"I was very disappointed with this beer. The cool bottle and name got me excited, and then the appearance and aroma took me to a new level of anticipation. Upon the first sip, I was convinced that the beer had gone bad. I thought to myself, ""Can oxidation really destroy a beer this severely?"" I checked the reviews on this site, and sure enough, my bottle was not spoiled. Or maybe everyone got spoiled bottles. In any case, if you buy this beer, it will most likely taste like mine did. I live by the philosophy ""Try everything at least once," and I have to say this beer makes me question that advice."
"D. I could drink more then a few of these. Beer is not that good but the bottle will look great in the collection."
"D- Ok brew that doesn't overwhelm you with taste. Pretty easy to drink."
"D- While I won't have any issues drinking the entire bottle of this myself, I would probably rather share some of this with somebody. While this is a flavorful beer, it's not the most refreshing. With that said though, I recommend this one and will purchase this again!"
"Overall: Not a huge fan, I feel that the style can be done much better and not taste like two poor beers poured into a glass...cool just though."
"D- pretty good, love the bottle."
"D: Wow, I thought Yuengling's Black and Tan was uninspired and forgettable. This is one of the most disappointing beers I've tasted in a long while."
"Pours a brown/red colored body. Fizzy looking. Has a smallish head, slightly off-white in color. A nice malty aroma, slightly effervescent. Has a malty taste, slightly fizzy palate, slightly watery. Fresh, portery taste."
"The metallic odors coming from the pint glass foreshadowed what was to come, though the bit of maltiness that also came through gave me hope. Sadly, the taste was all oxidized pennies and rusty railroad ties. I searched for the faint notes of malt and roastiness, but they were few and far between. Only slightly less disappointing was this beer's mouthfeel, which was too carbonated, thin, and watery. I could've finished the entire 32 oz., but its sheer mediocrity made it a drain pour, even after I attempted to mix it with a respectable amber."
"Notes: Not to bad, sweeter than the average B & T, and a pretty sweet looking bottle."
"Overall. The mouth feel is carbonated. and the finish is nil. The beer is watery got funky flavors going on in the beer. I don't even think this is a black and tan, or a poor excuse. I think I will pawn this off to one of my buddies."
"My traditional view of black and tan is Bass (English pale ale) with Guiness (Irish dry stout). Mississippi Mud elects to to combine a continental pilsner with an English porter. The result is an overcarbonated pilsner beating down a wimpy, subpar porter. Tastes like sour cola."
"This is by no means a horrible beer... It is very affordable; I payed $2.99 for a 32oz growler. I would suggest this beer to folks just starting out tasting craft beers. The mild characteristics presented are good fundamental beer tasting stepping stones."
"Don't really understand this beer, seeing that a black & tan is normally 2 beers. Yes, I know the traditional porter is 2 beers that are blended, but still. Pours darm brown with a thin tan head. Cocoa and metal aroma. Thin mouthfeel, not really smoky or nutty or chocolate. Kind of a blend of all three."
"Overall I think my memories are fonder then what this really was, Not at all as good as I remember, but ehh, was worth it for the memories."
"Pretty average beer, the taste is good but there's a little bit too much carbonation and it comes offas being fizzy and forced. Again, I did enjoy the flavor, but it wasn't very deep or complex when compared to similar beers. I'll drink it again if offered but won't go out of my way to obtain a bottle."
"Eric"
"I've never had a pre-mixed Black and Tan, but this is nothing like the bar trick brews I've experienced in the past. Interesting it was a mix of Porter and Pilsner, but not something I would buy again, despite the very low price."
"Hey, how come it's called Mississippi Mud when it's brewed in New York? ;)"
"Drinkability: This is not a good beer by any means, and unless you enjoy the taste of a half-assed black & tan, I'd recommend staying away from this one altogether. Spend your money on something better."
"One more thing - This is a great ""transition"" beer when trying to get swill drinkers to enjoy some better brews."
"Verdict: Watery and thin, with the lackluster taste to match, the brewery has some stones to call this ""Mississippi Mud," it's closer to St. Louis runoff. I'm assuming that the ""Continental Lager"" mentioned on the bottle is clever code for a typical American macro-lager. And it certainly does taste like a middle-of-the-road, bland, Porter mixed with swill and given a fancy name. While I certainly did not expect this to be as good as a real B&T, I had at least hoped it would be a somewhat decent analog. But alas, this beer lets down it's awesome bottle, name and premise. All marketing, no beer."
"Drinkability is good. The mouthfeel is nice, but the taste kind of sits in your mouth in a bad way. This beer is worth a shot, but it isn't the end of the world if you never have it."
"Big tan head with a brown body. It really does have a great head but could use better carbonation. The smell is really lackluster, like a pale lager with a little bit of tootsie roll aroma. Tastes much like it smells. Decent hop bitterness."
"Serving type ""bottle"" is subjective, since its design is a jug. Like the look - not the beer. A good looking beer, light brown with some ruby tints, see thru a little, with a two-figner head that died quickly. A light malt smell of roasted malts along with some butterscotch/caramel and toffee mixed in for a little sweetness. This beer starts to lose it after this. Light-to-medium bodied with some sweetness to it, but it also comes across as a little slick and syrupy. Has a slightly dry finish from some roasted malts and a twinge of hops, although the malts pretty much nullify any significant malt presence. A somewhat dull beer that really doesn't improve while it warms (that 32 oz. bottle sure starts to look dumpable after a while). I might be able to take a 12 oz. bottle or draft, but I can't buy the quart again. Just not that good."
"Bottle material: 100% brown glass bottle with a shrink wrapped label around it to give the appearance of a ceramic XXXX moonshine bottle."
"This is a good brew for a wide variety of strong foods. It also comes in a cool looking bottle. If you don't mind a sweeter beer this one is nice to nurse over a meal."
"good beer, not something I would go get specifically but it is good with just about any food(was having pita chips and humus). if it wasn't for the watery feel it would be higher but still good"
"Clever jug and label which holds a rather boring brew. I had trouble picking up any kind of aroma. Color is a medium deep amber with a thin light tan head and ample lacing. Mouthfeel is rather thin but the finish is clean. The flavor is enjoyable but not at all robust. The flavor starts off as a plain lager but finishes with some roasted sweetness barely reminding me that some porter is supposed to be in here. I'm sure most people can't resist picking up a jug but the novelty soon wears off."
"About what I expected, not horrible, though not something to write home about either. The soft diacetyl character certainly doesn't help. I'll certainly pass an having this again though."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. Not a bad beer for what it is."
"Drinkability here is high. This may not be the best black 'n tan but seriously, its pretty good. Only problems might be..finding it again?"
"I liked this beer. It was pretty satisfying. Price isn't too bad for the quality. The bottle is definitely a keeper. If you want bitterness this one is not good for you. Its more sweet than bitter."
"Certainly not the greatest example of style or a great beer, but it will do just fine for now. Seems more like a dark Am. lager than anything approaching a black/tan. Would I purchase it again?...probably not, but I'm not a worse person for consuming."
"I picked this up when I was on vacation in Florida because it was the only ""micro"" I could find. Should have just stuck with Sam Adams or something I could count on."
"Drinkability: Not at all like a mix of stout and lager. Not at all like mud. Not a drain pour, but overall a rather bland experience. This seems to be a beer that relies on gimmicks to sell and falls well short on the quality aspect."
"D: This was a very unremarkable beer. Nice light body, low ABV but no character or any feature (other than the packaging and that had limited utility) that made it a beer to remember. I expected ""MUD"" not diluted American Brown Ale mixed with an average lager."
"Drinkability & Notes: Very underwhelming but somewhat tasty for the style which isn't my favorite. I would much rather just make a black and tan myself instead of it being homogenized. I would get again just for the bottle and cheap price."
"Must admit that I bought this beer for the bottle. Pours a clear ruby brown color with a decent tan head that settled into a light cap. The aroma is of a light toasted malt with a slight metallic twang. The taste is quite buttery, high in diacetyl, a watery toasted malt and a metallic twang to boot. Really quite a hodge podge of off-putting flavors. At least it is not grainy or adjuncty. The feel is light but not watery, appropriate carbonation, finishes ok, slightly astringent. An average brew at best, very English in style. I still don't understand the whole black and tan in a bottle thing, needs to be mixed right before you drink it. #400 (not sure why I chose this one)"
"Final Statement: This beer held up very well. Still very drinkable after 9 months. Not a great beer, but one that I drank and enjoyed to an extent."
"D - Decent example of a Black and Tan, goes down clean and easy but doesn't stand out to be anything special."
"Of the black and tans I've had this one left a bad taste in my mouth. Bought a case of it and had a hard time finishing it. Apperence was nice in the bottle and went down hill from there. As a dark beer, black and tan drinker I find this less apealing than most. Not awful though!!"
"drinkability - Easy drinking, light like beer, nut much deep flavors going on here."
"overall, not my favorite style but not a bad representation i enjoyed it but prolly wont buy again"
"Poured out of a mason-jar looking bottle. I bought this one honesty because of the cool appearance. It reads ""Mississippi Mud Famous Slow Brewed Black & Tan"". The appearance of the beer was a dark brown/amber color, with an inch and a half off-white head. The smell was of chocolate and roasted malt. The taste was chocolate malts up front, maybe caramel, and hops in the background. Very drinkable, it has the drinkability of a lighter bodied pilsner with the richness of a porter. Overall, a well blended brew."
"32oz growler into pint glasses. pours smooth with one finger of head, amber brown in color. very thin in texture. the pilsner taste overshadows the porter flavor i believe. nothing rich or heavy about it. it actually seemed to taste more and more like a pilsner with every sip, by the bottom of the glass i was through. i had been eyeing this for a while to try it and i am not sorry i waited so long. dissapointing. price vs volume is good, but as always, you get what you pay for."
"A blast from the past of college days--and on sale at Bottle King! Frothy white head sits on a a copper-to-dark brown body in a nonick glass...the blending is noticeably porter/pilsner...the head holds a bit unevenly...a rather nondescript scent of soft malt and soft hops... smooth, almost buttery mouthfeel; effervescent and lively, swift...hops are softened, malts are likewise... crisp and mellow... quite drinkable... that curious combination still wields a pleasant mouthfeel and mood--and that jug's just as attractive to this 31-year old as it was to that 21-year old... even if the Mud's made in New York..."
"d: Why did I buy this again? Was the jug-like packaging really that appealing? Was I drunk? Totally lacking in both aroma and taste. The only possible upside is that the light body and weak flavor make it easy to chug. I would only recommend this if you have already had several beers, were done looking for something to enjoy and just wanted to get hammered. Then, maybe then, this would be acceptable."
"D: having tried a few different black and tans, I have officially decided, it is not my thing. Worth a try though and definitely worth it to have the bottle"
"I liked this one quite a bit actually... I would drink this one regularly if it were available in Tennessee... This would make a good session brew..."
"Appearance is rich amber brown with a nice frothy head. Smell is of sweet malts with a hint of dark fruits. Taste of burned watered down malts that lingers with the bitterness in the mouth. mouthfeel is light and watered down, nothing to get me to excited about, except for the bottle which is probably the real reason why I bought it."
"Beer with non discript aroma, small head with virtually no lacing, that diminished to nothing quickly. Short duration with a sour finish. Body is medium with soft carbonation and a near metallic finish. Only real reedeming quality is the cheap price ($2.99 for a nice sized jug). Bests Miller and Budwiser for taste per price segment, but nothing great. Was curious, now I have satisfied my curiousity but not my taste buds."
"I got this beer because of the unusual packaging - the 32oz jug just spoke to me. It pours a dark brown, which makes sense for a mud coloring. The aroma is of dark roasted malts and some grains like coffee and even some hops. This beer actually tastes pretty good. I like this beer. It tastes of the dark roasted malts and has hints of coffee in it, but mostly the malts. It is smooth as it goes down and has a nice mouthfeel with good carbonation. It is a pretty drinkable beer and it should be because it comes in a 32oz jug."
"D- I have no problem drinking a cold quart or two of this stuff. Too bad I cant find it out here."
"D: An interesting beer, one of the first beers I remember ever having, would be a good introduction into crafts, without hitting someone over the head with flavour, great bottle as well."
"Drinkability: I'll only have the one... no reason to try this again."
"Pours out a hazelnut body with a thinnish frothy head that leaves bits of lace. Smell is a mix of some roasty malts and chocolate malts toned down a bit by the paler malts of the lighter beer. Vague hop is somewhere in the background. I pick up a little graininess. Flavor is a mix of milk chocolate sweetness, pale grains, some buttery tone, and an odd, flat, yeastiness. Not too bad, though. Mouthfeel is pretty watery, but the carbonation isn't wilding out too much. Kind of light in both flavor and mouthfeel, which makes this an easy sinker."
"D- There are notes of porter and notes of pilsner but it taste like they have been watered down and that gives the malt a stale quality. The nougat and hop notes linger making an odd finish."
"Pours a dark brown with a decent tan head which dissipates to a thin layer. This beer's look is the most positive thing I have to say about it. The smell is rather malty... okay, the smell is all malts. This beer tastes like someone took a semi-decent porter and mixed it half and half with sparkling water. Really, the smell indicates it is going to be a thick full beer, instead you get stingy thin swill. Mostly malts, but not a clean taste (I guess that should have been obvious by the name). Again, I really wanted to like this beer. Feels thin and bubbly in the mouth, not pleasant in my opinion, and I rate the drinkability at 1.5 because I can't imagine wanting another drop after I finish the 32 oz that I have. Try it if you must, avoid it if you can."
"Drinkability- It wasn't a great beer but the bottle was cool. I don't know how a northern company can brew a beer called mississippi mud though."
"Pours a dark brown color with a fizzy off-white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. The sweet and malty aroma is extremely faint with a touch of caramel. The taste is pretty bland as well with some malt and a very mildly bitter finish. Overall, this is a pretty dull beer that really doesn't posses anything that makes me want to purchase again."
"Poured from a quart jug into a pint glass. The beer pours a deep amber, forming a thin 1/4 inch head that quickly faded. Light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is very light, but there are subtle hints of roasted malt and coffee. The taste is very light and tasting nothing like a black & tan that I've ever had. Aside from that thought, the taste isnt that bad. Light coffee and roasted malt, along with a slight hop presence. A very interesting taste. Light smooth mouthfeel. If you get past the fact that this isnt what a black & tan tastes like, it really is a very drinkable brew. Overall, I was impressed by the overall qualities of the brew. So it may be mislabeled, but as long as you can look past that, this is quite an enjoyable beer."
"D- I suppose this is fairly drinkable since it is so light but it definitely doesnt leave me running back for more."
"I'm visiting Texas right now,and I stopped in to Whole Foods...and this bottle sort of jumped out.I decided to give it a try,not expecting much,and I was right.Already mixed Black & Tans seem to ruin the experience,and this was no exception.You can taste neither the Porter nor the Pilsner IMHO.It was not a bad beer by any means,but neither was it great,but at $2.99 for a Quart it was a decent buy.I would have it again,but I would not go out of my way to get it..."
"Overall I'll admit I just wanted the bottle to put some homebrew in."
"The drinkability is not so great. Next time I will mix my own. MK"
"I liked the quart ceramic jug. It poured a deep red with a small tan head. Nose of mild malts and chocolate. Mouthfeel was faiirly smooth. Flavor was just what you would expect from a Black and Tan with caramel, coffee, chocolate, and floral hops. Finish very mild. Drinkable, but this is all."
"I will not have this again."
"Note to Self: Ranked the #9 Black & Tan (but in a rather weak field)"
"Really, it is a pretty good deal all-in-all. It is a great beer to share with BMC buddies -- a good compromise beer where both parties can be satisfied."
"While there are hints of good beer in this bottle, it is a struggle to find it. Instead of a harmonious mix of two styles, I find this one to hit a sour note."
"to boot."
"In all of it's blandness, there is something towards drinkable in it - might be the carbonation. Anyway, the lable says a ""robust porter"" - no robustness here, and a ""continental pilsner""...don't know - didn't quite catch that either - maybe they mean as far as carbonation. Had this a while back after having other beers - figured I would try it again on a fresh palate. Nope. Not for me - not much too it - too much like spiked, coca-cola mixed with metal and some sourmix with only hints of being a ""beer""."
"This is a fun black and tan, in a very cool container. It pours a strong reddish-copper with good carbonation and a creamy tan head that retains well and laces nicely. The smell is nice, with some roasted malt and a bitter sweet and fruity. The taste is light and clean, but nothing spectacular. Nice mouthfeel, quite creamy. It's quite drinkable, particularly slug over your hand, drink a la moonshine! Yee Haw!"
"Overall: A good, inexpensive standby beer. Im going to stock up on a few of these. Good one to get your macro-drinking friends trying something new."
"Will I revisit this brew? probably not, see no reason to"
"This beer looks great and smells bad. The distinctive packaging and the average taste add up to a drinkable beer if you choices are limited and you want to look ultra cool."
"Mississippi Mud Black & Tan pours a medium brown with an off white head from a brown bottle shaped like a miniature one quart moonshine jug with a twist off cap. I kind of like the aroma, malty, on the cocoa side. I'm not real impressed with the taste, its kind of fruity, and maybe a little cocoa toward the end. Not bad overall, I really wasn't expecting much based upon the gimmicky bottle. I tried it many years ago and I didn't remember being impressed, so actually its better than I would have suspected."
"Mississippi Mud Black and Tan was a dark amber color and clear. The light tan head had decent retention and left a little lace behind. The aroma was light with a little malt and some toasted notes. The taste was a little roasty, but not much else. The mouthfeel was thin with medium to high carbonation. The best thing about this beer was the jug it came in."
"pours out an amber to dark beer with a tiny head.somewhat carbonated.Smell of a porterlike licorice type smell ,,not bad.Taste is pretty pale somewhat of a watered down porter{which i guess is what a black and tan essentially is} but i like it its very subtle.mouthfeel ,,eh not much.a pretty good brew looks like its good for sessioning."
"The mouthfeel is average. The way to consume this entire jug is to pour a glassful and then put it back in the fridge until the next pour."
"This beer kind of amused me in a way. The look of the bottle and the name on it implies it is from Mississippi, but then you read that it is brewed it Utica, NY. A decent beer, nothing to go out of your way for, but might not be a bad option if you wanted a decent sized beer for a low price."
"This is a beer I have enjoyed many times. Perfect for the occasions when you're just hanging out with friends and need to bring your own beer. Available near me in either 1 pint or 1 quart bottles, either of which is fun to look at and carry around. Never poured this beer into a glass, but the smell from the bottle is slightly sweet, fresh, but not powerful by any meaning of the word. Tastes much like you'd expect, like a black and tan; quite tasty, but nothing to write home about in this case. Very easy to enjoy a quart or two without getting tired of it."
"Poured a crystal clear mahogony color with massive off-white creamy head. Smell is opleasant mixture of dark fruits. Taste is all predominately fruits, and is very pleasant to the taste buds. Finishes sweet and creamy. A very one-dimensional beer, but actually quite tasty and enjoyable."
"Overall, a classy beer to drink in public straight from the jug-shaped bottle, that will still draw ridicule from the monks."
"NOTE: Like many I was taken with the packaging. Mine is a quart jug. I plan to keep it and use it as a mini-growler. It will make a nice travel jug for some of the brews I cant get in bottles."
"One quart bottle with clay-looking plastic coating and ""cellar aged"" is written on the bottle. Says it's a mix of pilsner and porter. It pours a reddish chestnut with a 1 finger ecru head and smells very much like a lager - clean and grainy with toasted malts, faint caramel and chocolate notes, and a touch of paper. The flavor is similar, but a little more bland and it has a light, semi-dry body that leaves a short finish. Not a bad beer, it's just not a good one."
"I have to admit that this beer would be nothing without the unique bottle... however I must give them credit for this, as I still have an empty Mississippi Mud bottle sitting atop my fridge, just for the fun...."
"It's drinkability is fine. Most people can probably enjoy this beer, especially if they are into darker beers."
"Really the only thing that led to me to get this beer was the unique bottling. I just thought it looked cool the way it was shaped like an old jug. Onto the beer though, it poured out a nice dark color with a little bit of a cream colored foam. The smell was okay, nothing too overbearing or impressive though. I personally thought the taste was pretty good. Or maybe not so much that it was good but that there wasn't something noticeable that I disliked. It started sort of sweet and finished with a little of the ale hoppiness one would expect only neither sensation was that strong, which is fine I guess. Mouthfeel was about average, there really isn't anything out of the ordinary to report there. Overall drinkability, in my opinion is actually fairly high for me, mainly because I feel like its something I could drink a lot of and not really tire of for some odd reason."
"My friend is nuts."
"I was given this beer at an x-mas party. Needless the say, while I drank it I was not that impressed but had to put up a good face and drink it so as not to embarass the giver. There is a dark colour, I tasted some roastiness. Sourish finish. The packaging is unique and attracted curiousity. Despite that, with the name mud, noone wanted to share it out."
"Bottle is a 2 pint big mofo , with a gator in a swampy scene. The beer poured a clear , darker brown / auburn , with a creamy , small off white head. Aroma is of slight caramel and other sweet and slightly roasty malt smells. Taste is lightly malty and roasty , with some bitterness and tinge of astringency in the finish. This brew is simple and smooth. It goes down real nice and easy. Mouthfeel is a little light. Quite drinkable and tasty bottled black and tan. Worth a try imo."
"The way I see and taste this stuff is pretty much a novelty, as opposed to an actual ""Black & Tan""."
"I had a feeling that I wasn't missing much each time I thought about grabbing a Mississippi Mud and didn't. It's a forgettable beer that continues to be brewed and sold only because of the novelty and distinctiveness of its packaging. I wish now that I'd been content to remain curious."
"gets a 0 for foam and a 4 for fullness, averaged to a 2."
"I picked this beer up after looking at it for awhile at my local liquor store. Found the jug quite unique and there for I had to buy it. So later on I cracked it open and I was first not impressed by the taste but later on it started to grow on me. It then became very easy to down almost like water. All in all it is a very nice and smooth tasting beer. I recommend it to anyone who wants a little something different."
"Bottle: Poured a dark amber color ale with a huge slightly of-white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of weak sweet malt with a very subtle touch of bitter hops. Taste is sweet with a weak malt presence and not much hops. Watery body and overall a very uninteresting beer."
"A boring beer in a fancy package I would never seek out."
"Bottle is very cool. As for the beer, there isn't anything extraordinary here. Flavors are thin and watery. That said the beer is about what you would expect in a prepaged black and tan. This isn't terrible, but with all the good beer I could be drinking I'll use the other three bottles to boil my brats."
"I though the brew would be a cloudy deep brown color based on its name, but it's a medium brown and a little thin. The smell is strong and off-putting."
"D: Was this worth what I paid for it? Sure. I've at least got a story. But in the future, it won't be worth any more than the price of a bottle of club soda, because that's basically what this is."
"-SS"
"D: I could drink this a lot just because it seems to go fast. The taste is enjoyable, a mild porter in many ways. Bought it for the bottle and price, and found this brew suprisingly good. A good beer to try especially for the price."
"Poor mouthfeel on this one. I expected something with a bit more body. It is very very light bodied. It feels like someone had a half glass of beer left put a bunch of ice in it and let the ice melt, came back an hour later and finished the drink. It is extremely easy to drink, and goes down quite smooth. It would make an ok session beer, that is if the ABV is around 4-5%. The only reason I would buy this again is if there were no better alternatives, or if I wanted some more of the unique little bottles. I think that perhaps I'll get more satisfaction from the black and tan category when I actually make one myself by layering Guinness and Bass."
"I really don't consider 'Black and Tan's' to be a legitimate style of beer, but I'll judge it accordingly anyway. After trying this one a few years ago, I was unimpressed. Now, after knowing a bit more about beer flavor profiling, I kinda enjoyed this brew. Basically a weak, malty sweet American Stout in character. The 'tan' portion seemed to water the stout characters quite a bit, but substituted a moderately fruity sweet caramel malt character. I could also describe this as a big amber beer with cocoa, roasted grain (Porter--sh) and more moderately hopped. Schizophrentic of course, but I don't mind the experiment. Oh yea, the bottle is sorta neat too."
"D - Quite gooey. Very easy to drink. Nothing ""off"" and light in body, makes it a good session brew."
"This pours a dark ruby color,it looks like black cherry soda, with a thin off white head. There is almost no smell, except a very faint malt roastyness. The taste has a roasted flavor,some coffee and chocolate, but little else. The m/f is light and alittle weak and watery. I don't understand the point of this beer. If I wanted a good black and tan I'd mix it myself."
"I may have over-rated this interesting beer a bit, but the group think here has under-rated it. The floral and hoppy aroma is interesting. The taste is not overpowering but definitely interesting. It went great with my pizza this evening. It's definitely worth a try."
"The appearance is a beautiful dark amber with a small head. The smell is very nice and solid. The taste is like a like a porter with a sharpness at the end. The mouthfeel is pleasant and the overall experience kind of reminds me of Rogue Dead Guy. I love this beer and may get it again. More likely I will experiment with making my own black & tans."
"Interesting bottle and a beer that I suspect might be ""manly-looking"" enough to get some BMC drinkers to try it. IMO it's much better than the ranking would suggest."
"A very drinkable beer here. Easy drinking without sacrificing any flavor. This would probably make a good crossover beer for your bud light addicted buddy. Cheers!"
"After poping the screw cap lid, the smell was of weak hops and something else, that I can't put my finger on. The taste had a very weak flavor. Kind of a weak hoppy taste with a hint of whatever. This is a good summer quinch that can be gulp down in a hurry! Please, no more Mississippi Mud ""Black & Tan", for me!"
"Overall i have been wanting to try a bottled black and tan, but it seems this one is either a bad example, or the only good b+t is made at a bar. I kinda wish it wasnt a quart sized bottle, but i will finish it. i could see some people drink this. But hey, ""mississippi mud"" made in New York?! Such a shame. How many new yorkers have seen an alligator like is shown on the bottle? Its a scam."
"Cheers!"
"I can drink this, it's harmless enough, but no thanks."
"Most of the taste of this beer is lager, with the exception of the very end which lingers like a stout. It pours a translucenent brown color with an interesting lace pattern. The smell is overwhelingly of cheap mid-grade malt, which is I guess what you'd expect. A very unimpressive beer."
"This brew is pours a color that is neither black, nor tan, and certainly not both. Instead, it pours a clear blood red color with a small white head. It would look so bad for an amber or pale ale, but it is not what is espected for something called a black and tan. The aroma is rather pleasant; sweet roasted malt, nuts, fruit. The taste leaves a lot to be desired. It is faint, and mildy sweet. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a brew to be avoided. I seriosly can't see myself ever being in a situation where I wanted to drink a beer like this."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Has a decent look to it. Deep reddish brown. Very little head on this one with very little lacing on the glass. The smell is similar to a stout, very big nose of burnt chocolate. Taste is not quite what you'd expect from the smell but you can definitely tell it falls into the black and tan category. Picking up some of the burnt chocolate taste, other than that it's relatively bland and bitter. Mouthfeel is rather bubbly considering there isn't really a whole lot of carbonation evident. Drinkability is average. could make a night out of drinking this but I think I'd probably get tired of it and want something else."
"Just not what I would expect from a Black & Tan."
"I feel like I could drink this one often, especially straight out of the bottle, very simple and refreshing/"
"Well at least we get a full 1 pint on this beer. MS Mud has limited flavor and is not smooth so down on the mouthful although not difficult to drink. I guess if Im in the south there are other beers I would want to try."
"This beer feels very creamy and super smooth in the mouth. It has soft, semi-sweet chocloate and espresso flavors with a medium body. It starts immediately sharp but quickly becomes smooth. When the brew settles in your mouth you'll notice the espresso-to-coffee flavor trend is the heaviest of all the taste suggestions you may experience. The finish is rough and bitter with a long-lasting aftertaste."
"this beer seems not very good to me, its flavor causes a little to me acidity, but nor to speak of its presentation one of the best and but simple ways to present/display a beer, its package, its label, the beer that I take from this mark is the one of a liter, with a predominant flavor to porter but that to they american to lager, it smells or and it leaves good flavor of mouth"
"Pours a cloudy mahogany, with three fingers of off-white creamy head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smells of toasted chocolate malts and floral hops.The taste is a blend of sweet roasted malts upfront, folllowed by a crisp pilsner flavor and dry hops. The pale lager presence is strong, and disturbes the balance, but the taste is still pleasing and complex. Finishes clean and highly drinkable. The light lager gives an even carbonation and medium body and the dark ale provides a malty palate. This smooth combonation leaves the mouthfeel a little dry, a little residual."
"Nothing I would'nt seek out again really. Very average, if not all together boring and forgetable."
"The bland finish prevents any type of session with this beer."
"Notes: one of the best in its class, very good taste and highly drinkable, just keep it COLD"
"Easy to drink, and enjoyable, but a little bit on the boring side."
"I was a little dissapointed in this beer. I had high hopes which it didn't live up to. It has a decent aroma but the taste and mouthfeel is just not there. I will have to give the company a thumbs up for presentation though if that means anything. I bought a 4 pack af these and now wish I would have opted for the single. It is a beer that could be drank but I would take a porter or a stout over this next time. Next time I am in the mood for a black & tan Yuengling would be a much better choice."
"Its an ok beer"
"A weird jug, gawd knows who makes this beer (must be F.X. Matt). Medium brown appearance, translucent, tan head has little staying power. Laces very simply, some downward-directed strings. Light aroma, slightly nutty with some stuffy almost estery notes. Body is very thin and the carbonation medium high, making for a poor presentation. Flavor is dissappointing, too sweet with cheap cocoa and a husky graininess that's at least partly a result of the carbonation. By the time the bottle is done, there is an annoying cider-like tanginess (before this, there are similarities to Leinenkugel's Creamy Dark Lager), but no improvement in body or a counter-tone. Doesn't show good qualities of any beer that normally makes up a Black and Tan...mediocre stuff here."
"The beer is smooth and reasonably easy to drink, but not sure you'd want to."
"My first Black & Tan, I bought this one because it was relatively cheap and I'd heard good things. Pours a dark brown with a thing lasting head. Tastes like what it is: a mixture of pilsner and porter. I don't know if I should blame the beer or the style, but Mississippi Mud combines two opposites with unfavorable results. I want my porters thick and my pilsners thin, and by combining them this brew leaves me wanting more. Recommended to try, it isn't going to hurt your wallet too much, but there are better options."
"The bottle is the best part of the package and was added to my collection. The beer as a whole wasn't too bad with a nice deep amber coloring and a huge head when first poured. The taste is decent but since this is the first Black & Tan that I've tried I don't know what to expect from other breweries B&T's. Overall I found it as highly inoffensive and since the price is right I wouldn't pass it by."
"This beer pours a two-finger head that quickly recedes to one-quarter. I detect a very slight floral hop aroma. It is a very translucent medium brown and leaves a fair amount of lace on an empty glass. Lightly slick mouthfeel. It is heavy on the carbonation making the flavors which are more subtle than I expected difficult to perceive. I get a little caramel that finishes with a wisp of smoky grain. This is a chugger and should be something to savor if it truly conains any porter as this company claims is in the recipe. I think they are wasting their porter."
"It poured about 2 fingers of dense white head, with the beer itself being a dark reddish amber color. It smelled slightly chocolatey, but mostly grainy.. It tasted fairly sweet, like roasted hops and malt, with a hint of barley, also a bit of a caramel taste in my opinion, fairly smooth overall. It seemed a bit watery, and fairly carbonated. This is a very drinkable beer, but not a memorable one.. It doesn't seem much like a black and tan to me.. I must say I do like the bottle though..."
"Dark brown / auburn like color, with a long lived dense white foamy head. Not much of an odor to speak of, but gave hints of dark chocolate and alcohol. Smooth flavor of roasted hops and malt with a bit of barley. Kind of watery as well. I would drink this again, but I would not mistake it as a black and tan. This is more like a red beer that's been over done. Worth a try, but not what I would recommend as a good black and tan."
"Just drink it quickly."
"This beer poured a nice dark brown to black with a firm deep tan head. There were no off smells. Nothing spectacular but okay. The taste was sour almost a vinegar. The mouthfeel must have been okay because it made no impression on me. This looks likd a novelty beer that has not worn well."
"First sip reveals a lite body with average carbonation. The flavor has some anice qualities to it mixing with a bit of chocolate and the same grainy malt from the nose. OVerall a bit less pleasant than expected. Cant be sure but could be the anice as I dont like black licorice. Well the beer is not outstanding for sure and is not even very good, but it has flavor and I like it more than most BMC brews. the bottle is cool unfortunately the beer leaves a little to be desired."
"Bit of a letdown, really. Good thing the bottle's really cool though."
"Drinkability- That funky ""tan"" taste ruins it for me. Would have been semi decent if they had used a good lager for the tan part. Now it's just a below average beer."
"Nothing spectacular as far as drinkability."
"Oh, plus, since when's a pint 473ml? damn US measurements...."
"Quite a different vessel for this one. a moonshine jug, hmm. Poured out a medium brown with a soapy thin head that stayed no longer than the time it took me to pour it out its ""jug"". lacing was nothing to speak of. Aroma was of faint coffeebeans, caramel, and cereal grains. Taste was a little thinner than what i expected. kind of a let down. lightly roasted coffee, caramel, grainy and thin. this was more ""tan"" than ""black"". even though it was a let down, it was still better than any macro brew ive had, so it does have an upside. overall, the best thing this beer has going is its intriguing little packaging."
"Overall, a really nice beer. And where I shop a 32 oz bottle of this actually costs less than a 40 of Bud."
"Wow. What a bland-tasting beer. None of the character of a Guinness & Bass/Harp Black & Tan. This is uniformly blah. Thin mouthfeel with little taste of anything on the tongue. This is inoffensive to the point of being invisible. Allowing it to warm a bit doesn't seem to help, but it does bring out barely-there notes of chocolate and almond. Thanks but no thanks."
"The mouthfeel was also on the tan side. Kind of thin. The drinkability was good enough to put away a jug."
"Drinkability - an enjoyable beer. Nothing to search for at length, but easy to drink."
"Better than I expected. Very thin and somewhat watery, but has a nice, porter-like flavor. It's a little weak, but pleasant. The macro background doesn't detract, and it's actually quite refreshing. Much better than Yeungling's version of the style, IMO.(It is certainly one of the coolest bottles, also)."
"This beer was not very good. It had a decent appearance but the smell was a bit rancid. The taste was not appealing either. It had a very different and strange taste that I am not used to. It tasted like the malt was stale and it also tasted like it may have been skunked. Not a very good beer. It comes in a cool bottle that is great to hold change in."
"The first thing about this beer is the cool bottle, it's the reason I purchased it. I looks like an old pottery jug. The pour was a lighter copper-red tone. Came out with a good half inch head that quickly dissapated to a thin lace that stuck to the glass throughout the drink. The smell was a very light mix of floral and malt. The taste started very watery, dare I say almost macro watery, and continued that way until a light hop and malt kick at the finish. A very clean drinking beer that would make a great lawnmower beer, but that's the best I can say for it."
"Admit it--you bought it for the bottle! I know I did."
"The bottle was kind of cool, in a hickish way, so I decided to give it a try. The appearance was medium brown in color, much lighter than I thought it would be. There was a moderate head and good lacing. The body of this beer seems to be missing though. Tastes like a bad homebrew to me. Too sweet and thin up front with no bakbone. Hops are little noticed if at all. Maybe some earthy flavors arise but this is not a good beer. I'm not wasting my time with this stuff ever again."
"Pours a color that as nothing to do with Mississippi Mud. I live near the Mississippi. This stuff has the appearance of flat Coke. Smells vaguely like a porter, pretty weak. A little hint of chocolate and malt. Tastes like soda water. Tastes of chemicals and fizzy carbonation. Not much of a beer. Not worth buying."
"Notes; very cool jug. Awsome marketing for this brew. I'll be honest with you, the only reason I bought this was because of what it looked like. I was very disapointed for what this brew was supposed to be."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a creamy crystal malt scent that is really quite nice. The taste is good. It boasts of pale and crystal malts. It has a nice sweet malt palate that goes down easy and satisfies. This is a pretty damn good beer for being served up in a glass jug. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer surprised me. I wasn't expecting much, but what I got was a fine black and tan. It drinks well."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a massive cream-colored head that slowly shrinks to a lumpy layer. The smell is faint but consists of light malts with grassy notes and hints of alcohol. The taste is a tad of chocolate, malt, light hops, and a touch of sweetness. This is an extremely light bodied brew for what it's supposed to be. Definitely not great and a few notches below good. Cheers anyways!"
"This is a cola colored brew, with a bubbly white head topping it off. Not much smell, malty. This tastes like a clean lagered brew, with the traditional black and tan taste. This one failed to impress me much, but the bottle is pretty cool. Thats why most people would probably try this, not for a stellar tasting brew."
"I have always had a soft spot for the Mississippi Mud black and tan. Unfortunately for the Mississippi Brewing Co., it has nothing to do with the quality of the beer. History, in this case, influenced my decision to buy this beer again. I have many positive memories with this brew - particularly long nights of Mud and Mario Party with my friend Daniel. So, I was very excited to pick up a four pack of jugs. Really, the jug is the best part of this beer. I could probably drink a few of these and hardly notice. This is because the beer, which calls itself a 'black and tan', is actually a strange flavored amber. It pours into the glass and you wonder for a minute: which beer from my fridge did I just poor? Was it an ale? Was it an amber? But alas, you come to the conclusion that you did, in fact, pour yourself a 'black and tan' beer and got nothing of the sort. The head bubbled up nicely, but for a short duration. I took a drink and imagined the perfect blend of ale and stout - and only in my imagination would this occur. The taste is that of a medium bodied red beer. I have no problem drinking these; its not an offensive beer by any means. In fact, I polished off the four without much whincing."
"My wife picked me up the big jusg of this brew cuzz she liked the jug-like bottle a few weeks agoe and I never reviewed it because it was quite forgettable.Pour is decent a reddish brown color with not much head to it,aroma is very grainy and malty but not much there.I also got a metallic taste but not much just a slight metallic tinge in the finish,some slight caramel malt taste but pretty bland.A beer in a gimmick bottle quite a concept,that how you can sell really bad beer."
"Two big words for this one... METALIC AFTERTASTE!!! I am glad to see that I was not the only one to get the metalic aftertaste/smell. At first, I thought it was the glass, but now I know differently. It had a very nice appearance to it, especially the super thick head. The head lasted a few minutes and then died down to a laceing. If it wasn't for the metal taste/smell, it would have gotten a way better review. Sure, I like metal, but musically, not taste. Other than that, it was an above average atempt at a black and tan. Get rid of the metal and watch the ratings soar!"
"Overall Impression: Cool bottle, but I can’t reuse it for homebrew (twist top). I expected a thicker, more intense flavor. This is basically a thin slightly off porter. I would look at the water source or the cleaning of the metal in the brewing system. That, or a re-evaluation of the hops."
"I gave this beer .5 points for Appearance because of the moonshine-style jug. It pours a ""muddy"" brown with a foamy tan head. There's not much in the aroma department, besides fresh bread dough and mild hop. The lightly smoky body is fairly heavy, but not as thick as it appears. It's a bit grainy and mealy, though still quite fluid. The mildly applied hops have a lime-like flavor, but gets lost as the malt sweetens and overwhelms."
"Comments  This came in a moonshine-type of jug that youd find down South in a backyard still. Its quite a sight. If you collect bottles you HAVE to go out and buy one of these."
"If I want a beer to simply look at..maybe I'd get this...If I wanted a beer to drink...I would never buy this again"
"The most interesting this about this beer is the bottle. The pour yielded a huge off white head that filled my 500ml pilsner glass to the top. Promising. The odor is sweet and somewhat pungent. Normally I am immediately turned off by a big pungent smell, but here its mild so I proceed. To expect a world class beer here would be to set oneself up for certain disappointment. Obviously this is not a world class beer. What this beer represents is a relatively inexpensive alternative to the common dark swill. The taste is subtle and smooth and the mouthfeel is more watery than I would like, but it is definitely drinkable. It has a fair balance between a pleasant sweetness and light roasted flavor. As far as it being the combination of a ""Robust english porter and a continental pilsner' as so dictated on the bottle, I think they are at least somewhat accurate. It is definitely the unique combination of a pilsner (a light light pilsner Urquell) and a porter (NOT robust), but it is nothing to write home about. It is however strangely enough, it is growing on me as it warms up."
"Will not return to this one again!"
"The beer is a light brown color with more clarity than I expected and a thin white head. Aroma is pleasingly of roasted malts. Theres a fruity sweetness up front, and a very light hopiness. Overall, Id describe this beer as watery and uninspiring.another gimmick beer. Its got a cool bottle going for it, but not much else."
"I'm not sure exactly why this beer is so popular in southern New Jersey (I think it's the packaging), but after seeing it time and time again in liquor store coolers I thought I'd give it a try. It pours a clear mahogany body that's topped by a short but creamy tan head. The head retention is only fair, and it drops shortly to a thin collar and whispy surface covering but leaves some lace initially. Fruitiness is prevelent in the nose, backed up by a touch of lightly caramel and cocoa-tinged malt. There's not alot going on, but it's actually quite nice and very welcoming. The body is light and it's crisp on the tongue. In the flavor, assorted fruits (apple, grape, orange, berry) and chocolate/cocoa-tinged malt combine in a mildly sweet cornicopia of drinkability. There's no noticeable hop flavor present, and the bitterness plays only a supporting role. It finishes with a flourish of fruit followed by a soft note of cocoa, and then dries out with a very mild note of alcohol and a touch of hop bitterness. Although it's very simplistic, it is actually quite quaffable. It has more character that most mainstream American lagers and makes a good crossover beer for the uninitiated."
"Yupper, gotta like the bottle at least. A decent mahogany colour with a very impressive choppy foamy tan head. Nose is of sweet, sweet malt, some toffee and caramel. Not a hint of hops to be found. Flavour of sugary sweet malt and carmelized sugar, very watery for a black and tan. I like the alligator for the logo though."
"Drinkability/notes: An interesting beer; while I think that the notion of a black and tan beer in a bottle is a bit absurd, this is nonetheless a pleasant and drinkable beer."
"Appearance was a pleasant reddish tan. The smell was rather mild, but the tast e and mouthfeel were rather weak. Felt more like a light beer. Drinkability was too easy....a bit like drinking water. The bottle was very interesting...that is what intrigued me in my local major market.....suggest you stick with regular domestics rather than paying extra for this offering."
"Not really a bad beer, but if I am going to drink a beer I will definitely not choose this one."
"Probably the strangest looking bottle of beer that Ive ever had. And, why is a beer called Mississippi Mud brewed in New York? Anyway, it pours a clear dark amber color with a frothy off-white colored head that fades into a good amount of sticky lace. Nose is faint with notes of malt and a touch of caramel. Light to medium in body with a sweet malty flavor at first followed by some sour notes. I wasnt impressed at all with this beer, and I still dont understand the concept of a bottled black & tan."
"Well, there is not much black in this black and tan. The roastiness is really lacking with only a subtle dark malt flavor thrown in with a lot of pale malts and grains. The body is very light for the style, and it is really lacking flavor. Mouthfeel is good with light, crisp carbonation."
"If you are looking for an unusual bottle to add to your collection, this one is a must. But this wasn't my favorite bottled Black & Tan."
"You have to love the novelty bottle, hell I bet these things sell themselves just because of the bottle. Well, I know that couldn't have called it New York Mud, but c'mon who wants to drink Mississippi Mud from Utica, New York, hold on who really wants to drink Mississippi Mud. Well, hey I bought into it, now let's see what this beer is made of. It pours a deep dark ruby tint, and the head is filled with very large bubbles and it is cream and color. Head is sticking around for at least awhile, and the lace is clinging to the sides of my glass. The aroma is very faint, I can barely detect some grainines along with somekind of malt thrown in to give off a sweet aroma. No hops to be sniffed here, oh well let's see how it tastes. Very smooth and on the lighter side, but it brings a fruit tone in the finish that I find very pleasant. This is nothing exceptional, but I find it pretty drinkable. A bitterness along with a semi sour aftertaste is left, but I don't think it's a mistake, somebody tried to make it taste like that. Very light body and thin in the mouth, definitely doesn't have the texture of a real porter mixed anywhere in there. I could drink a couple of these and find myself admiring the bottles, but I probably will never buy this beer again. There are too many outstanding beers in the world, to settle for mediocrity."
"The idea of a black & tan in a bottle is absurd to say the least. If you are expecting the taste of an English B&T then you will be dissapointed. I found this a drinkable and good beer. Not a great beer mind you but still very good especially for an american beer. The maltiness is on the very light side. almost non existinet. The hops are mild also. A creamy texture with a good taste. Also a very large beer in a unigue bottle. I have tried this in both sizes and I find the larger bottle has a better flavour than the smaller bottles."
"The first thing that grabbed me was the catchy bottle.  Plus I happen to like on occasion a B/T.  It has a clear incandesant dark red color when poured, a slight head, beige/cream in color, the lace matches.  The aroma has light hits of caramel and malt. The flavor, malt in the beginning, and slightly sweet.  Not very carbonated. Drinkable.  When you are in the mood for that type of brew."
"ruby/garnet in color...very pretty...but no head and no lace and hardly any carbonation....yikes!   odd buttery aroma, a touch of floral hops.  tastes ok....pilsener and porter characteristics wavering back and forth...no bitterness...medium to light in body and a pretty smooth mouthfeel...nothing stands out and i'm guessing that's the way it's supposed to be.  pretty drinkable because it's unoffending.  IMO this is a gimmick beer.  it comes in a pretty cool one quart jug that makes a pretty sweet decoration.  this concoction would be a good crossover brew, but i prefer my black and tans properly poured on tap with guinness and bass."
"Clear shiny brown color. Big fizzy beige head, fades fast. Not much noticable on the smell, faint carmel sweetness barely shows itself. Taste is nothing more than average, some sweetness, but no body. Fairly thin, and mine seemed very highly carbonated. Sweet finish, matched with carbonation made it almost soda like. More pilsener tasting than porter tasting. Cool bottle, looks like an old moon shine jug, with an alligator on the front. Big carbonation burbs haunt me........."
"The beer pours a clear incandesant dark ruby color, the head is modest, beige, the lace wraithish. Nose is malt, light hits of caramel. Front is malt, a tad sweet, the top thin, the finish is shilpit, minimal carbonation, nebishly hopped. Drinkable, and the bottle is ""Cute", and I always find a ""Lady"" that wants the empties, a pleasure in its own right. Does not rank on my current 1000 beer master list."
"Mud in a jug.  Nothing overly exciting, but it isn't bad.  A black and tan with a slight hop bite on the finish.  Somewhat thin mouthfeel, but a decent looking dark black in the glass.  Fairly inexpensive and available in many party stores. A good way to introduce a macro-drinker to a black and tan, as the novelty effect of the jug will get their attention."
"I can only describe this as a gimmick beer, because the bottle was interesting, and the beer awful. Funky metallic/brown sugar nose. Malt had an odd dimension, which, coupled with the alcohol in the beer, hinted at cheap sour mash whiskey. One of the few beers I have poured out half-way through and gotten something (anything) better from the fridge."
"This bottle looks like a moon shine bottle my grandpappy used to use at his still.  Dark brown/black in color with a slight reddish hue.  Tan head.  Taste of toasted malt with a firm hop backbone.  Roasted and smooth.  Very good, but would not drink on a hot summer day."
"The color is brown with a red-ish hue. On the palate is a nice malt and hop flavor. I actually really enjoyed this brew. I only had a true black & tan once and that was long ago. The closest thing I drank as a usual is Yuengling's Black and Tan, which I love. This Mississippi Mud brew is different becuase of the Pilsner quality, I like that also, very different...weird one second I taste all pilsner, second I taste all porter. Anyway I tasted it, I liked it...Overall very enjoyable brew!"
"Sweet molasses on the nose, thick head endures.  Dark brown with a reddish hue.  Nice rounded mouth full of malt, hops bitterness, finishing dry.  Smooth, yet not completely void of bite(highly carbonated).  Despite the poorer reviews by my comrades, I feel this brew deserves more merit.  Rewarding!"
"I got a 4-pack of this from a Bud-drinking friend of mine and by the fourth one I can say I like this beer.  It doesn't have much scent and I prefer a thicker feeling beer, but it tastes good."
"Comes in a quart bottle that looks like an old hillbilly wiskey jug....i like the bottle better than the beer."
