4,15.6,4,4,4,4,4,"one of the best saranac beers and an absolute taste of fall for me. pours thick and dark, like a cup of coffee. has a nice tall lasting brown head on it. notes of coffee and dark dry roasty malt are the featured smells, but chocolate is also present. flavor is much much lighter than the nose indicates. still quite robust, but more laid back. the chocolate notes come forward a bit, and the earthy malts are balanced by a nice crisp lager finish. the mouthfeel is excellent, its so smooth, infinitely drinkable. one of my favorite dark beers to session in the autumn. carbonation is average, and the finish is very dry. overall an excellent beer that is a part of the seasonal flow of life for me.","StonedTrippin","Aug 24, 2012"

Nose is that of caramel, malt, hops, some chocolate, maybe some coffee as well? That's about it really- fairly thin on the nose. Taste is the same as the nose, with some coffee being thrown forefront into the mix. Still, it's fairly thin and weak on the taste front. Feel is pretty thin, dry and flat. Possibly the worst aspect of this brew. Overall, you can find better in the style. This beer isn't horrible, but it's not great either. Still, I've been to the brewery, and I'm glad I got to review this one... Cheers.","jayhawk73","Aug 28, 2011"

3.41,-1.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Black in color tan in head. Color isn't a thick black like a stout but similar to a dark brown, almost mahogany. Faint nose with some chocolate and some cereal malts. No real hop presence. Chocolatey bitterness kicks off the flavor but starts to smooth out to a light caramel creamy body. Lighter than expected for its color. Finishes with only a subtle bitterness coming more from the toasted grains.","DrinkingDrake","Aug 17, 2011"

Smell is of roasted dark malt, chocolate syrup, and caramel aromas. Taste is of roasted malt, coffee grounds, caramel, and slight roasted peanuts. A mild roasty bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a pretty good carbonation level making for a crisp yet smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good black and tan beer that is much better than the Mississippi Mud beer of the same style I have tried in the past.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 06, 2011"
3.48,0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer presents with a jet black coloring, deep and dark, with a slight brown highlight around the edges. The head starts out solid and dense, with a height of about an inch that settles into a film across the top, a beige topping on the blackness. Nose is a creamy sweet blend of coffee and toasted characteristics, with a hint of sweet milk chocolate, also. The beer leaves a decent lacing of thick froth along the glass while you drink. Initial flavors are coffee, mostly, with a dark roast feel to it. The blend of taste shifts to a nutty and chocolate sweetness, with a tinge of bitterness, also. All the flavors stay light due to the carbonation levels in the brew, which increases the ease of drinking. The balance is good enough to keep any of the flavors from shifting into sharpness. The beer has an aftertaste that is a littly tangy and a little cloying, with a smokey resonance to it. The finish clings to the mouth, and the creamy aspect becomes a little too coating. Decent brew, despite the stumble at the finish.","GarthDanielson","Aug 04, 2011"

I haven't tried the Irish Stout, but I don't taste a lot of the Adirondack Lager in here.

One solid color of dark brown, with a surprisingly large head. Smell had a nice chocolate malt aroma. Taste was a nice mix of cocoa and coffee. Mouthfeel was pretty good, but if this beer's body was stepped up one notch, it would greatly improve my thoughts on this particular brew. I would love to see this beer made more along the lines of a porter. Wishful thinking. An easy beer to drink, but after two I began to feel this beer was a bit boring.

3.73,7.8,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Never had a Black & Tan, not at a bar or a pre-packaged one. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep brown color with dark ruby highlights and a thick, creamy mocha head. The head continues to deposit rings of lacing around the glass as it travels down the glass. The nose has the characteristics of a stout, deeply roasted malts like coffee and burnt chocolate but there is also a fruitiness. The flavor brings more of the same with the roasty flavors being subdued due to the mixture of the lighter lager. Black Patent malt, coffee and burnt chocolate are present along with some sweeter notes like caramel and molasses. Mouthfeel is medium in body but the creamy, nitro-like head makes it seem fuller than it is; very smooth. Overall, very drinkable (that's the point isn't it?) with the lighter beer ""watering"" down the Irish stout but still strong enough to get the enjoyable flavors.

Smells of coffee, chocolate, hops and malts, however it seems like the bitters (coffee and hops) dominate the smell a bit too much, still a good smell though. Tastes of coffee, roasted malts, chocolate, and some bitter hops. A bit of alcohol and metallicness in the end of the taste takes away from this beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied (right between a light beer and a stout, maybe a tiny bit light), good carbonation and a good coating of bitter/coffee aftertaste is left on the tongue, alcohol taste toward the end also takes away a bit for me here.

A caramel malt aroma is present throughout accompanied by a little oatiness. Outside of the sweetness the aromas are pretty muted. This brew is a bit thin and the fizziness of the carbonation is a little unpleasant. There is a little rustiness to the finish. I think that the medium body and smoothness of the beer makes it okay. The sturdiness of the brew is above average and keeps this brew on the up and up for me.

The flavor tends more toward the ""black"" end of the black & tan spectrum (I personally prefer it when the b&t scales tip in this direction). Malt flavors that span the spectrum (that are almost balanced by a roasty bitterness) make this a very tasty brew. My only beef is with its body, which strikes my palate as water thin.

There definitely were hints of some chocolate and caramel in the smell, but because of the lager influence it was rather limited. Overall though the beer offers a nice balance of body with a stout-like taste. I would recommend this to those people looking for a stout, but not wanting to be overwhelmed by taste or those looking for a little more than just a lager.","germanbeer1","Nov 24, 2008"

3.95,14.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,3,4,"Out of mixed sixer this bottle (almost two bottles, a Stout and Lager) of beer poured a nearly-black brown. The head was tan, one finger thick and the tiny bubbles clung to the rim of my glass. Moderate retention and scattered lacing. The aroma was unusual; earthy, roasted malt and hints of caramel sweetness with some hints of the Lager lurking in the background. The flavors were at first ""dark," roasted malt and toasted grain. Then a hoppy bitterness appeared and some lager malts with hints of wood. The finish was long and semi-smoky as the toasted malt really came through. Quite complex. The body was medium and the carbonation too high for a beer as dark as this. Not as smooth as it could be the lighter body does offer it some session-ability and a crispness. An unusual beer to be certain, but a good example of the style and one I'd buy again.","thekevlarkid","Oct 30, 2008"

The aroma is slightly weak but I am able to detect some nice malts, a bit sweet to the nose. Poured a very dark amber that allowed a little light to pass through, good head and very nice lacing. Smooth and creamy on the palate, but a little to thin for me to really be impressed.

Again, lots of roasted malt, toffee-ish, with a bit of nutiness (although that's likely just the mix of the caramel malt and the more roasted flavor). A very mild hint of hops. Body's medium, a little watery (something I've noticed with a lot of their beers). Overall, I gotta say these are some nice brews. I guess I was expecting some total garbage out of this mixed sixer (probably cause it came from the random market next door), but these are easily up to Yuengling's beers, and possibly as good as a Magic Hat in terms of the quality (that might be a little extreme).","soupyman10","Jun 09, 2008"

I have never really reviewed this style before, so I don't know what to expect from it. But this one just tastes odd. The two combined styles don't seem to mesh well together and they stand out a bit too firmly against each other. The feel has a fairly high amount of carbonation to it and the liquid is kind of thin.

Caramel sweetness and a hint of smoked wood in the nose as well. Taste starts off with a black coffee flavor which is a bit disturbing. Other than a slight hop bite, there really isn't much else on the tongue. This could use a lot more malt sweetness, a bit too smokey for me.

Moderate hop bitterness, sturdy and solid throughout, with a bit of tart sour cherry flavour up front. Mild, dry roast with malty sweetness. Fairly dry finish with lingering tart bitterness.

As far as taste goes, there is an upfront sweet, chocolate and caromal flavor. There is no discernable hop character. All in all this is a very drinkable beer.

After holding back my laughter about the fancy beer comment, I decided to go ahead and see what brews were available. Saranac black and tan was all that was left. The beer pours a dark brown color with a whitish/light tan head that stuck around. Aroma was coffeeish and malty with just a hint of hop smell in the nose. Taste was chocolatey with some coffee, dark malt and roast malt flavors present. Mouthfeel was fairly light bodied for a darker brew, making the drinkability pretty good.

The nose is primarily malt and bread, which does follow through exactly as you'd expect it too in the flavor. The predominant flavors are roasted malt and bread, with a bit of caramel and maybe coffee. There's a bit of hops in the aftertaste, but primarily just malty bitterness.

The beer is a bit thinner tasting than a stout. It is extra malty with the nice roasted flavors to kick it up at the end. The roast reminds me most of coffee. The malt is sweet and estery. The beer has a typical mouthfeel. A bit astringent and a little over drying. Just nothing exciting. Drinkability is okay.

It has a medium-full body, lightly creamy texture and low carbonation. As hokey as I think bottled black and tans can be, theyÂ’re often good session beers.

A medium tan head forms and leaves a lacing down the glass. The smell is reminiscent of malted milk balls. The taste is disappointing because there really isn't anything there. A malty sweetness with just a touch of a roasted bitterness in the background. It finishes clean with very little aftertaste. It seems like the lager portion of this Black & Tan just waters down the stout portion, it doesn't actually add anything. The mouthfeel begins prickly with a lot of carbonation and finishes very watery and thin. The drinkability is strange because I could drink a lot of it if it was served to me, but it isn't something I'd choose to serve myself.

Not much of a head (pale brown), but I'm not an aggressive pourer. Some minor lacing. At first, the smell is kind of hidden, but after awhile, a hint of coffee beans is present. Subtle alocohol warmth from an Irish stout with a mild and crisp bitterness of a lager. Its sweetness is well balanced with its hoppy bitterness.

It pours a lighter-than-expected brown/ black. Not opaque. Has a mild head that disipates quickly. Aromas are a little lactic in nature, a little grainy (black malt) and a light sweetness (caramel?). Flavors are light for a beer with a stout in it. Flavors are lessened by the lager addition. A bitter from both the black grain and hop addition is less than clean--charcoal-like.

Good retention and lots of lacing. Color is a clear dark chestnut with definite ruby highlights. Aroma is more like a stout, coffee and bittersweet chocolate, and so is the taste. Mouthfeel has some carbonation along with a bitter hop balance. Difficult to zero in on the flavors here, but it's a pleasant sipping brew.

Softly sweet cocoa and light roast coffee comprise the dominate mild mocha note in aroma. Mellow earthy hop nose with an herbal tinge offers contrast. Trace buttery toffee hints. Tame, but pleasant aromawise. Gentle roasted barley bitterness upfront in flavor is bolstered by toasted grain and understated dark caramel malt sweetness. Clean, devoid of esters and quite lagerlike. Mirroring the aroma, stately lightly sweetened mocha is the theme here. Mild hop bitterness is appropriate, considering residual sweetness is equivalent. Almost creamy in mouthfeel, with a dilute espresso quality. Minute burnt grain acidity surfaces late and adds trace tartness, but fades immediately. Finishes abruptly and mostly dry, with quickly fleeting hints of overbaked chocolate cookie. A unique, very mellow brew, with soft roast and cocoa character. Almost clinical it its cleanliness.

Very yeasty and grainy, with the background of malt. Along with a hint of soy and barely noticable hops, and a touch of coffee from the stout, the overall smell is almost meaty, like breakfast sausage. Mouthfeel is smooth at first, but immediately the carbonation comes in, before it smooths out again. The taste is incredibly smooth and mellow, with elements of both the lager and stout. The wheat and malt from the lager smooth in front of the indiscrete taste of roasted coffee and the smallest hint of citrus. The aftertaste is very smooth and slightly dry, with a hint of burnt.

The nose displays some grassy hops over a dark maltiness that's made up of light caramel and hints of deep roasted coffee. The body is medium/light, and it's crisp in the mouth due to a fine, median carbonation. A toasty malt character appears first on the palate; followed by an acidic roastiness and then some caramel notes as it warms. Some grassy/floral hop flavor shows up just as the bitterness starts to rise in the swallow. There's a quick shot of chocolate upfront, and then some passing caramel, in the lingering bitter finish that mainly leaves you with a roasted astringency/acidity and some grassy/metallic hop flavors. - That may not sound very good, but it is. It's a nice, dry and refreshing finish that lets you know you're drinking a dark beer. It makes you want to have another taste, and adds to its drinkability.

Its label says it is a cross between stout and lager, but it was not as pleasing and much too sweet, as opposed to some B&T I have had. The pour was dark and decent with a fair sized head which disappeared rather quickly. The taste however was not to my liking. It tasted watered down with very few flavors that stayed in my mouth for very long. And there was no bitterness to speak of! Overall not a very complex beer that only made me thirsty for a better one.","GreatPondBrewer","Jan 20, 2003"

3.45,-0.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a decent dark brown hue. Combination of lager & dark roasted malt flavor. Not a bad Black & Tan, especially for a pre-fab. Beer #11 of 12 beer sampler is a success. I will not be reviewing the #12 beer of the sampler which is the light, because my sister-in-law drank it allready. Overall the 12 beer sampler was a fun 12 pack of beer.","jtw5877","Dec 28, 2002"
3.01,-13,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Mahogany in color, with a thick, creamy, light brown head. No hop aroma is evident. Has a light roast malt aroma. Sweet caramel malt, with a bit of roast malt flavor. The malt subdues the bitterness. Overall, it is a medium-bodied, smooth drinking beer. Nothing jumps out and grabs me to intrigue me to have another. This would be a good beer for those who are still not ready to jump head into a Stout.","BeerBuilder","Dec 18, 2002"
3.97,14.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The stout/lager mix of Saranac's Black & Tan is quite different than a porter /lager or porter /ale that I'm used to. Beyond this noveIty, I still enjoyed this brew. The appearance of this interesting beer was a dark reddish brown with a thin white head that stuck around for a while, and only a small amount of lacing. Roasted malt and a little bit of hops could be detected in the intriguing aroma. The same roasted malt appeared in the taste, along with hints of coffee and a small trace of chocolate. The fuller body of the stout mixed with the lighter lager made for an almost dual-layered mouthfeel...at first heavy, but lighter than expected during the swallow. My bottle of Saranac's B&T was very enjoyable and very drinkable...complex enough for a stout, but light enough to have several of in a sitting. Nice job overall.","SchmichaelJ","Dec 11, 2002"
3.86,11.6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This dark, reddish brown beer pours with a 1/2 inch tan head that slowly fades to a thin layer of foam which produces nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is of sweet roasted malt with a touch of hops. The taste is strong on the roasted flavors, with a strong coffee note. A fair amount of bitterness is present to go with the malt that lends a touch of sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth and rather full compared to many of the beers in the Saranac line. The beer finishes clean with a nice hop aftertatse. A little touch of the roastiness lingers as well. Overall, this would be a good beer to drink a few of. This is another solid offering from Saranac, who might lead the market in giving drinkers the most bang for their buck. A good beer at a good price.","aaronh","Dec 06, 2002"

This show that most of the Saranac beers are samey, blend two of their beers together and it still tastes pretty much the same as the others give or take a flaw or off flavour. This just happens to be a good blend.","Jason","Dec 03, 2002"
3.88,12.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Tastes just like a meld between a stout and a pale ale should. Pours a dark mahogany with a dense, tan head that laces very well. Crisp, well hopped, fruit at the start, followed by bitter chocolate and roasted grain with a dryish finish. Blends the attributes of both very well.","QXSTER1","Nov 28, 2002"
2.71,-21.7,4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Clear ruby in color. Thin beige head leaves nice lacework. Aroma is weak. Very slight hints of roastedness and chocolate. Mouthfeel is too carbonated to make this an enjoyable brew. (The taste is not that enjoyable anyway.) The taste consists of an assortment of astringent maltiness and husky hoppiness. Not a very pleasant blend. An astringent bitterness lingers on the buds as well. Nothing about this beer (besides the appearance) is enjoyable. On the flip side however, there is nothing absolutely horrible either.","Bighuge","Nov 21, 2002"

3.85,11.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I have said this before -- I am not a big fan of this as a style, and am glad that there are not too many brewers who do this. If you want a real black & tan, it's easy enough to pour one yourself. But enough of that. Anyway, this is a rather dark beer, with a ruby hue that shines through if held to the light. Nice tan head that stays around for awhile. A number of pleasant aromas, including chocolate, coffee, some dark fruits, with a bit of floral hoppiness for balance. Taste is also fairly complex, again with coffee, some chocolate, slightly fruity. A little metallic tasting, but not unpleasantly so. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but otherwise this is not a bad beer (and in fact is one of the better ones I have tried from Matt).","mophie","May 30, 2002"

Seasonal and it just started selling a few weeks back apparantly. I detected a hint of rasberry. Don't drink from the bottle. I had it first from the bottle and was very dissapointed but poured it's a bit better and the color is nice.","packetknife","May 11, 2002"

3.43,-0.9,4,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,"Pours very dark, almost black. Smells like a dark beer should, and has a short thick head that quickly dies into a thin lace. Pleasantly bitter initially but goes down the pipe very smoothly. Not as good as a homemade B+T, but very drinkable for a bottle.","IrishRedRock","Apr 27, 2002"
3.73,7.8,3.5,3,4,4,4,"A nice dark brown with a very thin head that sticks most of the way down.  Bitter aromas of roasted barley are all that is perceptable.  Nice roasted barley and burnt/chocolate tastes present with a lighter body than almost any stouts.  Nice and creamy on the palate and very drinkable.  I have mixed feelings about this style of beer in general.  I don't like the idea of trying to make a black and tan in a bottle but I usually don't mind the result.  I'm not really sure if they actually mix two different kinds of beer or they just try to duplicate the flavor of a black and tan.  Regardless, usually the result is a beer that winds up tasting like a nice very light bodied stout which goes nice even in the summer","Murph","Apr 11, 2002"
3.88,12.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Almost black in color with a long lasting sticky head.  Roasted aroma.  Malty and slighty bitter. Very smooth, slightly oily, dry finish with a lingering aftertaste.

4.03,16.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Very dark but still translucent.  Roasted malt aromas.  Good mix of flavors with the carbonation tickling the tip and sides of the tongue.  Some lingering bitterness towards the back of the mouth and throat (tonsils if you've still got 'em).  A very enjoyable beer!","jermar","Mar 07, 2002"
3.26,-5.8,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Like the label says, there are a number of flavors to ""count""...that said, the dark color promises more than is delivered in terms of impact.  I like this beer in that a porter-like quality is subtle -- but its fleeting and the aftertaste is a tad metallic.  I grew up just 30 miles north of the Matt Brewery in Utica and I always wanted the Saranac lines to be great (Utica Club frankly reeked and their Matts Premium was a taste-free brew)...they seem to be improving though the bottles can be older by the time they get to me in the midwest.","ADR","Feb 19, 2002"

3.51,1.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark, near black in colour with a creamy / sticky head. Aroma has a buttery diacetyl / caramel smell to it. Smooth, medium-bodied with more, albeit slick, diacetyl. An acrid, semi-astringent bite melds nicely with an underlying hop character. A little dry & crisp with traditional lager flavours pulling thru as the beer warms up. Hint of chocolate. Clean finish.","Todd","Jan 27, 2002"
3.51,1.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Much hoppier and less stout-like than I expected.  Pleasant and drinkable, but not really much like a black and tan.  If I'd been handed a glass and asked to guess, I'd tag this as a somewhat mild robust porter.","Brent","Jan 22, 2002"
3.66,5.8,4,3,4,3,4,"dark, reddish-brown in color.  healthy creamy head. caramel arroma.  hoppy, caramel flavor.  seems a little weird compared to a traditional black and tan, but still a nice taste and a medium body.  overall a fine mix of a stout and lager with hoppy/caramel overtones that give you a sense of each brew that composes this mix.","mevans05","Dec 08, 2001"
