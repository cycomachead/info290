3.72,0,,,,,,"This beer is quite fruity tasting with a definite berry note as well as a touch of soft citrus character that must be hop derived. The flavor has a solid malt character to it that provides a nice toasted nuttiness, toasted malt notes, a hint of roast character (though this is quite subtle) as well as a sweet caramelized malt character. This beer is pretty good, I am a bit surprised by how subtle the stout influence is, but this is nicely balanced, yet characterful enough to stay interesting.","Gueuzedude","0"
