4.25,0,,,,,,"Bought a can of this at Alps supermarket in Irumashi, Saitama, Japan. Poured into a Suntory pilsner glass. Suntory explains that this is a blend of the regular Premium Malt's and the Premium Malt's Black, and that it is only available for a limited time in the fall. I have had both beers separately before, but this is one of those rare beers where they really do make up something better than their respective parts do alone. Really wonderful bitter yet refreshing beer that would go great with any kind of meaty dinner.","shigg85","0"
