3.8,0,,,,,,"Poured a darker brownish amber color with a small wispy head. Aroma of sweet dark malts, honey, a mild roastiness detected, essence of indistinct dark fruits. Mirroring the nose, the beer tasted sweet with dark malts and honey, some mineral/phenolic thinness, notes of raisins and smoke, mild earthiness. A little clashy, but not bad once you realize what's going on. Medium body, lower carbonation, and a decent drink overall. I'd estimate it around 6-7% ABV maybe?","Rifugium","Beers"
2.81,0,,,,,,"A bit warming. Thin and strange but drinkable in it's own way. Medium to light in the feel with smooth light carbonation. I don't know what to make of this brew. It isn't your typical black and tan.","stakem","0"
