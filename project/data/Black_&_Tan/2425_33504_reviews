"D: A beer that's all over the place - it tries to have a little of everything. It lacks hops - if you buy a Czech beer you should be able to expect more hops than this. However, it goes down really smoothly."
"An odd beer with an odd slight taste. Will not buy again!"
"Not so exciting. Could be a good everyday beer were it not for the thin mouthfeel and unbalanced mix of flavors. Pity."
"I'm not sure if this new half n' half is a good idea by Zlatopramen. But then this is a a weird style. My bottle poured with about two centimeters of foam and with a very dark amber color. The aroma was first dominated by a sugarcane sweet smell gradually taken over by flowery hops. The taste was a strange mix of roasted malts and red berries. To it's advantage I must say that it has a pronounced character and a taste that doesn't leave any empty spaces. Not for my palate, though."
