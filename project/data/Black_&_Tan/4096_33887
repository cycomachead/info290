3.48,0,,,,,,"Sampled at the brewpub, this is their fall seasonal for 2006. The name means ""mixed," but it is not mixed at the bar, but rather brewed as a mix of pale and dark. It comes out a cloudy dark amber under a 1.5 finger beige head with goor creamy body and a few lace strings. The nose is very mild, with just a hint of caramel. The mouth is light and very prickly. Mild all around, but all elements are here: caramel sweet, roasted nut, floral hops that leave a slightly dry bitter in the aftertaste. While I want more of all of the above, it is a good drinkable brew with wide appeal. Certainly solid.","Globetrotter","0"
