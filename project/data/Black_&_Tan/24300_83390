3.91,-2.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.75,"i think as good or better than the sum of its constituent parts. the ipa is still a little intense for me, as this comes across as much as an imperial black ipa as anything else, interesting and unique, getting better all the time as it warms. chocolate notes, dry cocoa, raw dark, and a touch of bitter bakers are all here when it gets to room temperature, and the hops in the finish push bitterness double jeopardy, but they do also compliment each other pretty well. complex and huge, but the booze doesnt show through all that much, its the body that makes this one gigantic, viscous, teeth coating, and almost harsh. lots of big dark beers from evil twin, some better than others, but the intense hop complexion of this one makes it unlike any of his others. creamy in feel, frothy, and drying as it moves along. worth the three bucks and change i paid for a single, no doubt about that, but these beers, all three of them, seem overly aggressive and not as well refined as they probably could be. still, a cool blending project given the hoppy nature of the ipa component.","StonedTrippin","Jan 30, 2015"

4.04,0.7,4,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Pours out interesting, with a much darker body on the top and a a lighter (relatively speaking) amber on the bottom. A nice creamy tan head settles down and leaves some nice sticky/soapy lacing. The aroma is a little muddled, which isn't surprising for a bottle black  and tan. The taste, though is a nice blend, with deep roasted malt notes of coffee and hops blending perfectly. The body has a nice thickness to it and there's just a little bite to it on the finish.","delta490","Jan 27, 2015"

3.92,-2.2,4.25,4,3.75,4,4,"BOD 259/14.  Pours a slightly transparent near black.  Normal head volume, above average retention and excellent lacing.  Nose is as advertised - ale characteristics (pine and citrus hops) over stout characteristics (dark chocolate with notes of roast).  Underneath are notes of caramel - quite nice.  As it warms, alcohol becomes evident as do very subtle notes of dark fruit.  Light medium bodied with a nice smooth texture that has a bit of creaminess to it.   Above normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and more in the finish.  The flavor profile is intense, quite complex and reasonably balanced.  It begins with a burst of sweetness that rapidly fades into a blended bitterness of hops and roast.  As the bitterness fades, grapefruit rind and pine hop flavors become dominant.  These, in turn, yield to a mild coffee flavor over a sweet chocolate note.  The finish is a lingering rind bitterness over heavy notes of alcohol and hints of prune.","tillmac62","Dec 28, 2014"
4.17,4,4.75,4,4,4.75,4.25," I think I like Yin & Yang a liiittle bit more than I like each on their own. This is a very interesting beer that changes a lot with the temperature. It has a lot of the characters of a rich, hearty stout, but it adds a pretty nice dash of hops to make it taste like an over-hopped imperial stout (again, not quite an Imperial Black IPA, in my opinion). The price is a little high, but so is the ABV, and more importantly, the quality of the beer. This is an excellent beer -- just make sure you get it relatively fresh so you can enjoy the hops that only a fresher bottle of this beer can offer.","Alextricity","Dec 26, 2014"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, slightly warming, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, but i think one is enough for me, the bitterness might start to wear on me if I have more than that.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance in the taste and the appearance, to me those were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty unbalanced and I wish the stout aspects showed up more.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone that wants a black and tan that showcases roasted and hoppy flavors.  All in all I was happy with this beer and I ended up enjoying it a little more than just Yin by itself, the IPA brings some balance and complexity that Yin was lacking.  This is one of the better Evil Twin beers I've had and so far it's my favorite Black and Tan.  Nice job guys, this was a tasty black and tan, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Dec 15, 2014"

4.1,2.2,4,4,4.25,3.5,4.25,"Pours a mostly stout appearance with dark brown color and tan/cocoa colored head.  Nice amount of lacing sticks to the glass.  The nose features all of the roastiness of an impy stout with a heavy dose of piney hops.  This is a nice balance between styles.  The flavor starts with roastiness and quickly transitions into heavy bitterness.  This drinks like a really hopped up imperial stout like Storm King or Old Rasputin.  The body is medium to light for style and the carbonation is a touch high. Overall, a delicious beer.  Definitely satisfies the cravings of a nice big stout and a bitter imperial IPA.  More roast than a black ale and definitely more hops than your avverage stout.","homebrew311","Dec 13, 2014"

The aroma has plenty of hoppy notes with pine and citrus melding into a slightly smokey malt profile,  In the taste, stout flavor with the base of charcoal and coffee.  Gives way to a citrusy, grapefruit flavored hop note.  Slight alcohol tingles the throat, but really pretty well hidden alcohol content.  This is the granddaddy of Black&Tans.

Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, licorice, floral, grass, pine, light char/smoke, and floral/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, licorice, floral, grass, pine, light char/smoke, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine and roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, licorice, pine, light char/smoke, and floral/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of big dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; with a great roasted malt and hop bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, moderately sticky, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Black and tan style. All around great balance and complexity of big dark/roasted malt and citrus/pine hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. Definitely felt like an imperial black IPA with the big hoppiness. Would be interested in aging this one to see what happens. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 09, 2014"

This bottled version seems to have the opposite flavor progression and is much better balanced. I wish I had bought two of these now, although it was pricey.","LiquidAmber","Jan 18, 2013"

4.03,0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Served from bottle into a Mikkeller Teku (semi-proper!). Poured a massively dark red brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, subtle coffee, dark fruit, subtle citrus, subtle citrus hop, alcohol, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, earth, earth hop, citrus, citrus hop, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I have had a few Black & Tan brews back before I was reviewing beers and I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones I’ve had. If I am honest the stout portion of this brew definitely dominated this one with all the roastiness and alcohol notes. The ‘tan’ portion did make itself known throughout though with a nice kiss of citrus to help balance it out. I could honestly see this one getting you in quite a bit of trouble if you are not careful. Definitely a better representation of the style and definitely better than the make-shift one a few of us in my tasting group made. Worth your time trying if you get the chance.","thagr81us","Beers"
