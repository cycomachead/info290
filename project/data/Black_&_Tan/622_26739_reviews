"Pours a clear orange/brown, thin off white head, no lacing, head disappears right quick. Smell is weird, sweet, soft malts, citrus, stale almost vomitous aroma, not sure whats going on here. Taste is metallic, cloying sweet, toffee, weird and unpleasant bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium body with high carbonation, very bland and strange flavours/aroma. Trainwreck."
"D: Quite good. Should appeal to a large audience, but still have enough flavour for the enthusiast."
"Okay drinking, but a bit too carbonated. Haven't tried any of Shaftebury's other beers."
"This replaces the lackluster Winter Solstice and IMO it is now Shaftebury's best beer. Dark Caramel coloured and nosed this beer is in steep contrast to the pale lagers that now make up their collection. The nose is malty with some hops on the second sniff. The taste is a nice malty main body with a clean finish. Very drinakble and comparable to Nelson's After Dark or Fat Cat's Black and Tan. Worth buying a six pack for the cold season."
