"Amazingly dark in color, half stout supposedly, half eye of the hawk which is a dark coppery red, impressive color considering the combo. Light frothy head dissapates quickly., Smells decent like any other stout but light and modest. Has a strong metallic taste to it, quite strange. other than that eye of the hawkesque stout flavor is remarkable. mouthfeel is pretty nice, in the middle there. Overall I say 3 an a quarter although the metallic taste is strange."

" There's good roast character, not overpowering, and somewhat substantial malt backbone, but there's a minerally, acidic character that is offputting. Becomes somewhat metallic. May be the roast acrid notes and citrus hops clashing."
""
"An easy drinker. The metallic notes took some points away, but not good overall."
""
"Pours an opaque dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and a mild char aroma. Taste is much the same with a slight soy sauce taste on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that seems to be much more stout forward compared to the other beer it's blended with."

"O: I was a bit weary of buying this bottle simply because it looks kind of cheap and tacky at face value, also I had no idea how long it had been sitting on the shelf for since there was no bottling date, quite pleasantly surprised by this well balanced beer"
""
"Excellent with food. I would follow this beer anywhere."
""
"Overall - This is a pretty good Black and Tan, especially as pre-bottled B&T's go. I can't help thinking, though, that Mendocino would be better served using their Imperial Stout as opposed to the Black Hawk."

"Aroma is hoppy as heck. Deep citrus and pine hops lead the charge here. Crisp, clean and definitely very full. I was quite impressed with the way this one was starting off now. Warming allowed some nice touches of roasted malt and light cocoa to balance in. First sip though left no doubt in my mind as to the direction this one was going in. Rich hop notes dominate every ounce of flavor here. Piercing at times with pine and grapefruit taking turns with the destruction of my taste buds."
""
""
""
"Overall I didn't have much expectation for this but it was a very tasty black and tan in fact one of the best I had so far (out of only a few) Try it if you like the style!"
""
"O: My first black and tan, good experience. I enjoyed it."
"Notes: Drinkable and pleasant with slightly more assertive hops than you find in East Coast blended Black and Tan's."
"Overall: To be honest I was hoping this one was going to be just a bit better in the flavor department. It wasnt bad but good either so it kind of let me down"
"Split this with my roomie. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Pours a dark, nearly opaque black. Head was minimal despite a vigorous pour. Lacing is half-assed at best. The smell is malty and sweet. Almost reminds me of a bock. The taste is actually pretty decent. It seems to have a pretty hefty cherry component somewhere, with some caramel and toffee. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, and leaves behind a bit of a tart cherry aftertaste. Overall, this is an alright beer. I wouldn't seek it out, but...I can drink it."
"O- I really like Black Hawk Stout, and Eye of the Hawk seperately! This is a unique and bold attempt to bottle a black & tan. Imagine if you just put Guinness and Bass together in a bottle... yeah that! I was told I can order one of these fresh off of the tap right at the brewery near my house in Saratoga Springs. I might have to try it that way and review it again."
"O: Excellent value at ~$3 a 22oz. It actually tastes like a good beer. Not an award winner, but this is on a different planet when compared to most swill in this price range."
"I think if I were to choose I would rather have an eye of the hawk or black hawk stout alone as opposed to this blend. Instead of craving another sip I find myself craving the more complex flavors of a nice stout, which the black eye cannot live up to."
"Overall, this beer was excellent. The price was perfect at $2.99 and the flavors really popped. This is really a gem to find in a store and I am blown away by this brewery. I must try more!"
"Like a true black and tan--stout flavors are mitigated by a pale ale. My only complaint is the body which is on the thin side. The darker malts are light enough to allow the hop to pleasantly blend in. The aftertaste continues this blend and it lasts a long time."
"Overall I really liked this beer it is worth the try it was a good my I would definitely repeat and would recommend it to people who like porters/stouts"
"Is Black and Tan really a style? Not really. It's more of a marketing thing while many beers are blended, B&Ts are an odd concept and I'm not sure of the make up of this one and apparently are too lazy to use google. It's light in body and finishes like a porter with some mild sweetness at the front. The beer is boring overall but its quite drinkable. A passer on a highway, nothing to notice."
"Mendocino Black Eye Ale is a pretty average beer. The roastiness of the ""Black"" was not very pronounced with little acrid, coffee, or chocolate. The ""tan"" provides a nice clean crisp body. This beer doesn't have a distinct flavor or a special character, but unoffensive and easy to drink."
"Pretty good beer whatever style it is or it's being called. Poured with a great, foamy, frothy, thick, tan head that lasts and lace. Color is a clear to almost opaque very dark brown. Aroma is a clean roast, malt, toffee, cocoa. Flavor is like aroma plus bittersweetness stands out. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor, of medium length. And leaves me with a wish for another swallow. Session beer."
"Honestly, en route to putting up $200 in beer purchases a little while back, I grabbed this intriguing little item so I could have a bottle in the basket (carts are for the weak and smart) that didn't have a cost in the double digits. Not a bad little investment. It pours a barely translucent dark ruby brown topped by a finger or so of ecru foam. The nose comprises chocolate powder, light roasted malts, and some very light coffee. The taste is nearly identical, though some creamy caramel flows nicely into the finish. The body is firm medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Overall, nice bit o' brew, one that I would recommend as a not-so-roasty darker beer. Get some!"
"D: Nice beer, at $2.79 a bomber this is a really good value brew."
"This Black + Tan has a decent chance of being ordered again, but the slightly acidic, dry aftertaste will get tiresome."
"All in all, a great beer to finish up a day spent out in the cold: ice climbing, skiing or snowshoeing. This beer refreshes, and I could definitely see myself going back for more!"
"Mendocino Black Eye Ale is just on the edge of brown and black. The big, fluffy, beige head has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a slightly sweet, roasty aroma, with tangy malt on the nose. There are notes of brown sugar and something slightly herbal. It's medium bodied and smooth. The finish is a little scratchy and metallic. It's a little sweet, a little bitter; good balance. It tastes roasty with notes of dark chocolate, licorice and black cherry. The rumbly, boozy finish makes it taste stronger than it is. Green bitterness provides the aftertaste. It's reasonably complex; not for chugging."
"M/D - This is a very easy drinking black and tan, but by no means a great example. Very heavily skewed to the dark side. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but it is a refreshing beer."
"Pours a very fark brown with tan colored head. EXtremely strong malt smell to the beer. Mainly smells of caramel with some choclate as well, but the smell is intense. The beer is extremely sweet, possibly a little over-sweet. Just a little bit of roasted malt aftertaste as well. Overall the beer is a little thick for easy drinking and the sweetness is a little too much for my taste."
"Drinks great very sessionable."
"All in all, not a terrible beer, especially for the $2 I payed. Hopefully the Talon I bought with it for $3 will be better."
"Had my first one at the brewery, was a little skeptical of how it would taste out the bottle, but its damn good. A value too, as it can be had for less than $5 a bomber."
"D- A great hoppy stout that drinks nicely. More flavorful that many beers at this ABV. Quite the steal at less than $4 a bomber too."
"Overall, different, and well worth a try."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonate, rich and smooth. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This is a tasty beer, well rounded flavors and easy to drink."
"The mouth is a bit thin, but drinkability is decent. The sweetness may limit you to a couple of glasses. This is a pretty good ""pre-mixed"" black & tan. I would buy and consume on an occasional basis. The price was $3.09 at Sam's in Downers Grove and that is a good deal."
"D= there just isn't enough here overall to inspire me to drink more than a glass. At US$3.99 for a 22-ounce in 2009, I'll probably look elsewhere for my beer next time around. Still, worth the try."
"Skip, skip, skip."
"Pours a nice dark brown color with some nice head and lacing. Nearly neutral scent, not much there except a slight malty sweetness. Nice taste, good mixture, hints of burnt grain, but really nothing outstanding; nothing great, nothing bad. Goes down very smoothly, especially as a higher ABV black & tan. A bit expensive, though, for an average beer."
"D - @ 6.5% this one won't lay you down after a bomber, so fairly high. I enjoyed this beer very much."
"D: not a fan of the milky aftertaste, but this brew isn't bad!"
"Good stuff."
"Pours black with thick head that falls quickly. Aroma is dark woody, slightly chalky. The flavor is dismayingly thin. Woody, chalky, roasted malt, with a woody, cherrylike feel. The finish is super dry, not particularly pleasant,. A disappointing offering."
"Mouthfeel is very thin with a bit of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty high if you like this style"
"Drinkability: I love this beer and it's very easy to drink."
"D: It's not bad but it's not great. I wouldn't go back for it again nor would I turn it away."
"Pours dark with a finger of tan head, very little lacing stays behind. Some hints of chocolate and coffee beans hit the nose, but not strongly. Flavor begins with burnt chocolate and ends with some hop bitterness. Not much special to this beer really, other than how easy it is to drink."
"Drinkable, but bland."
"This beer porued a very dark brown with a two-finger tan head. The smell is mostly toasted malt with a little burnt coffee. The taste starts off with some bittersweet chocolate and coffee flavors that are cut by some citrusy hops towards the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some pretty minor carbonation. This beer is fairly drinkable for black and tan, but I can't imagine I'd want much more in one sitting than what was in the big bottle."
"Popped this opened after a 3 store beer run today after being snowed in for days. Beer had a big head - much like my own. Mouthfeel was ok. While it's not bad, I can't find much to recommend it, either. It is rather drinkable. Very unremarkable. I won't be buying this again."
"22 ounce bottle purchased from Texas Liquor in Carlsbad for four dollars, split with my dad tonight, poured into a Stone pint glass, color is medium brown or dark mahogany, head is 3/4 inch, off white, and creamy, decent retention, not much lacing, aroma is roasted malts, light hops, caramel, grapefruit and lemon, charcoal, and bread, flavor has more of a roasty profile than anything, you almost pick up a slight coffee taste at times, malt presence is similar to an amber but again roasted, lots of barley in this one, mouthfeel is roasty, chewy, and dry, medium bodied, could have probably used less carbonation, taste does not linger very long, could have finished the bomber individually, light in alcohol and on the stomach as a result, not a bad brew for the winter, always interesting to have a black and tan that is bottled and not poured by yourself, would probably drink this again, especially with how inexpensive it is, worth trying"
"Surprisingly good. Pours dary brown with a short tan head. Great lacing. Aroma of burnt coffee, nuts, toasted rye, and some cocoa. Bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt in the front that blends slowly with a malty caramel and peppery hop back. Creamy mouthfeel that is a little thin."
"Drinkability is pretty good, this isn't my taste in the style, but not something I was gonna pour out. I haven't had either of the base beers so I can't really comment on my thoughts on the blend. Overall I'm glad I gave it a try, but am not sure I'll be having it again anytime soon, or honestly, if ever!"
"Drinkability- One of Mendocino Brewing's less successful brews."
"I can't help but wonder if the stout is the winner here and the ""tan"" is bringing down the beer a little."
"I could see enjoying this as a pint out but I still am perplexed that there is even a black and tan category. I checked BJCP and ... ok, kidding on that note but this is a nice blended beer."
"The taste is similar to the aroma with mostly dark toast with hints of caramelized prunes, chcoclate, and fruity wine. The elements are nicely married and it is pretty drinkable and smooth. However, it is a bit flat and one-dimensional in character, with a little too much dark toast. I find the latter kind of confusing since neither the supposed constituent beers has much of a strong, dark toast character to me. Ultimately, while this is good, I prefer the constituent beers separately."
"D - Eh, this beer does little to excite me. It's not bad, but it's fairly uninteresting which is a shame because I really liked the Eye of the Hawk. The flavors just don't mesh terribly and this brew ends up tasting like a strange porter."
"On the full side of medium-bodied, the drink is nicely carbonated and very drinkable. I must say I didn't hold out high hopes for this bomber and am not real big on black-and-tans in general, but this was a fine drink that really hit the spot and went just fine with a breakfast of medium-rare strip steak, over-easy eggs and toast."
"Interesting beer here. I really appreciate the distinct discernability between the ale and the stout. With each sip you may taste one, the other or both. There is not enough presence in the nose to have this same quality in the smell, as there isn't much there in that regard. The offering is very drinkable as well, a bit lighter in the mouth than I would prefer but good nonetheless. This makes me want to try the two separately to see how the whole compares to the sum of its parts."
"Body is medium, well carbonated and somewhat thin feeling. $2.99 a bomber @ local foody."
"It's interesting. The aroma is wonderful, big and brownie-like, you really feel like you're in for a treat, and then the collision happens (consider the style). Still, I was sold by the end of the bottle. Mendocino stuff is typically very affordable, so there's no reason not to try it. They call this Black & Tan ""The Ultimate Blend", but as likable is it is, they've got serious competition from Black Sabbath & Bongs, Orange & Vanilla, and Baseball & Sunday Afternoons."
"This is a little better than I expected and wort trying. However, the alcohol will slow you down a bit which is a slight drag on drinkability."
"It's like a light tasting stout, but filled out and balanced with the bitter ale side coming through; knowing what it is while drinking it, I can really appreciate it (if in a blind taste test, I might just think it's a weak stout)"
"Poured a deep brown to black with a small head Nose is toasted, grainy and skunky with a caramel and a slight hint of coffee and chocolate but very little of it. The taste was just off. No real notes, no body, no charcater, no hops nothing but a skukned taste that was old and roasted. This beer should have never been brewed and glad its retired."
"D - Easy drinking, I haven't been disappointed with Mendocino at all. Clearly one of the most underrated breweries out there. Highly recommended."
"Recommended..."
"D - Not bad, but kinda boring. For the price I paid ($2/22oz) it's pretty good, but I would not seek it out."
"The feel is syrupy like cherry juice. A little dry at the end but felt inappropriate for style. Overall it's not that balanced. It's overly sweet with only a bitter accent. Pleasant enough, but not that memorable."
"22 oz. glass bottle- color of black, with a thick frothy tan head - nose of red fruit, malts, and roasted coffee  taste of chocolate, subtle red fruit, malts, and roasted coffee- body is slightly watery, and with medium high carbonation  aftertaste of red fruit, malts, and roasted coffee"
"Final Note: this brew may be a 'rotating release' but you can always buy Black Hawk Stout & Eye of the Hawk and make your own version of this tasty B & T."
"Regardless, the stout dominates the flavor more and it's not too bad either. Very drinkable and it's great if you want a stout with the lines of a typical ale and visa-versa."
"This beer may be retired, but it is still quite available. A little searching either at the store or online will get it for you if you are interested. I found mine at a whole foods in the Atlanta area. Not the greatest beer in their stable, but interesting. Pours a blackish brown with a thin head. Smell is roasty, followed by a yeasty tang and piney hops. The taste is smooth and malty up front, with spicy hops on the back end. Smooth and slightly sweet in the mouth, this is better than your average pre-mixed black and tan."
"It's pretty good for the price; I pick it up from time to time."
"Drinkability: Didn't expect to care for this as I have never been that impressed by Mendocino beers; unlike other reviewers, I think this beer is greater than the sum of its parts; not sure whether it is retired but that would be a shame"
"The aroma to the beer is very malty. It tastes of a stout with a bright hoppy finish. It is strong on the tip of the tongue and roof of the mouth. This would be the first black and tan I have had from a bottle."
"It's an interesting blend of two brews. I've had both the Black Hawk Stout (which I thought was decent) and the Eye of the Hawk (good) - this is a mix of both. Not a bad ""experiment"" and the two work together fairly well, though in two somewhat different directions. I expected it to be a bit heftier. Anyway, it is smooth and ""interesting"" so it's worth trying, especially if you have had both the brews that were mixed together to make this."
" ~ There is something a bit strange to this brew. I can't pinpoint it but I recognize the oddity. I would like to give it a try straight from the tap someday."
"All in all a very tasty brew, will definitely look for this in the future."
"Jen: So I was expecting a lot more from this beer, being that the ""bird"" series is usually pretty decent. This one just seems to fall short. The aroma, which seems to consist mostly of roasted malts, is very light and barely there. It tastes of more roasted malts with a slight coffee and bitter chocolate backbone to it. It seems to have a very mild hop ending, that I almost didn't catch. To me, this feels thrown together. I wouldn't say this is terrible, but I won't be hunting it down."
"Perfect!"
"Poured into a 22oz mug a nice almost black with a decent diminishing head. The aroma was of roasted malts and burnt caramel. The taste was an interesting blend of roasted malts, caramel malts and some earthy hops lingering in the background. The beer was medium bodied and was very refreshing for a dark beer on a hot summer night. This one is rather enjoyable and probably one of the best beers I've had by Mendocino."
"Overall, although very pleasant, it seems like an odd combination. It's like a very sweet grainy yeasty light sweet porter. ...with hops. Very distinct flavors, but very scattered and uneven. Somehow the separate beer items are greater than the sum as a whole..."
"D - Very drinkable as far as blended ales go. I consider it adventurous move since you don't see many bottled 'Black and Tans' any more and I like having the best of both worlds in one glass. I would recommend pairing w/ barbecued beef or cedar grilled salmon."
"Dark brownish black with a minimal tan head, very short. It smells like alcohol and tastes like alcohol despite the 6.5% ABV. It also seems to have a malty quality I usually detect in barleywines with an aftertaste like your standard stout. Carbonation is prickly on the tongue. This is a good blend and a very good value. This bottle can;t be more than a year old because I didn't see it on the shelves when I was at this particular store last year."
"Not a traditional black and tan. Tasty and enjoyable. Plenty of flavors to keep things interesting. Certainly worth a try."
"Try this one."
"D - A solid Black and Tan. Since it's just two of their regular releases in the same bottle, it's easily duplicated despite the (supposedly) retired status. Worth buying in the bottle."
"A great beer, especially when made on site, it has a great blend of the stout and the eye of the hawk, which is one of the best beers that mendocino makes. The taste is crisp and smooth, and it has a great blend of the flavors of the stout, and of the eye of the hawk."
"Tad on the sticky sweet side  like the sweet Sam Adams dopplebock."
"D - This is a pretty good beer, but I guess it has been retired. Mendocino products just showed up here in Columbia, MO."
"This is a great beer, maybe perfect for someone who is not sure if they ready for a stout."
"Good job Mendocino Brewing!"
"An OK beer, but nothing spectular."
"All in all a fine sipping Black& Tan."
"The flavor displays some very nice notes of soft roastiness and chocolate upfront, followed by sweeter toffee and caramel as it warms. A flash of yeasty fruitiness appears, and carries over to the finish, but bitterness and a bit of dark malt acidity take flight at mid-palate. It finishes dry and acidic with a lingering note of almost-burnt roastiness and some yeasty fruitiness (berries, some cherry, dark fruit). A very very light touch of alcohol is present, which is odd because it's not really that strong... perhaps it's being carried over from the Eye of the Hawk."
"If this beer was more expensive, I probably would not reccomend it. I would rather reccomend another beer with a little more character. In short, for the price this is a great beer. Take away the value, and you have something that does not have much character but may be good for people who do not like stronger beers."
"This drank okay, about middle of the road for black & tans"
"Overall- A nice Black & Tan that stayed a little too conservative. Not bad, worth the $2.75 for a bomber!!"
"*Edit: As this beer warms, the drinkability and mouthfeel both go downhill quick."
"too bad they retired this tasty treat...maybe if I had tried it earlier I would have bought more."
"D: Overall quite drinkable -- wish this wasn't retired."
"A rather enjoyable beer that doesn't necessarily have to be a novelty - it stands strong on its own points. Best part is, despite the fact that it's a limited release, it's easy to make your own."
"Listed as a Black and Tan, I guess because it is a blend of a Stout and a Pale Ale. But, the flavors are much better than expected from most failed attempts of a B and T. I'd rather describe the beer as a firm American Stout with a heavy malt undertone. Or, as a Strong American Ale with a firm roasted character. I beleived that the individual beers of Eye of the Hawk and Black Hawk were good, but were a bit characterless. The blending of the two became a powerful, bold, sweet, and well balanced brew. The color was a very dark brown with faint amber highlights. Held firm retention. And, left a strong malt flavor and aroma that became almost syrupy. The hops balanced nicely, leaving a bold and crisp brew. Great for those cool spring nights. Hate to see that it is retired."
"I like most beers from Mendicino, but will not get this one again"
"I was very impressed with this one! Sad that it was simply a one-off release. The colour was much darker than I had expected. I was thinking a little bit darker than Newcastle, but this poured nearly black. The smell is pretty malty with a ""chewy"" stewed prune smell and just a tiny amount of hops hiding in the back. Very appealing smell. The hops lay siege to your taste buds immediately upon your first sip. So much for their weakness in the smell. There is a wonderful roasted malt that leaves a dryness in your mouth on the finish. Nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is very smooth with only a slight hint of carbonation. Very nicely produced brew. I'm sadened it will be no more."
"Drinkability- A little to string to be an session beer. But worth about 3 22oz bombers a day."
"I really enjoy this offering, too bad it was only a one-off. I'll experiment and see if the blend was 50/50 and concoct my own Black Eye stash."
"A pleasant Black and Tan; a bit heavier on the Black Hawk side of the equation with the abv% of the Eye of the Hawk. A good blend of two quality ales."
"Pour looks black and opaque at first, but when held to the light, reveals a transparent garnet body with a light khaki head. Nose is subtle toasted malts, with a bit of a metallic astringency. Taste is woody, bready malts, hints of burnt coffee and bittersweet chocolate with a faint warming caramel finish from the strong ale. Nothing spectacular here, a predictably light stout/dark ale. Toasted malts/bitter coffee dominate the flavor palate of a rather unexiting style in general. Drinkable, but I'd probably prefer either a stout or a strong ale over a watered down blend of two mediocre versions of their styles. Worth a go I suppose."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sturdy maltiness that makes itself known. Carbonation works well throughout and makes this one quite easy to drink. A bomber is no problem. An easy drinking, flavorful brew that I wouldn't mind having on occassion."
"Black Eye Ale was a worthy experiment in mixing. I don't believe, however, that it's superior to either beer individually. Mendocino Brewing Company has rarely impressed me, so it's not that surprising that a mating of two of their 'good but not great' beers would produce an offspring of the same general quality."
"A nice concept blending a strong ale with a stout I think,pours a near black except for some ruby highlights with a thin almond colored head.Aromas and flavors of this beer lend more to the stout side of this beer,aromas are roasty and unsweetened chocolate with a touch of hops but subdued.Like the flavors going on lightly smokey and caramelly with a touch of alcohol zip in the finish.Not an outstanding beer but not bad I would have again."
"I certainly intend to try."
"Very appetizing looking ale in my Imperial pint mug, very dark almost total blackness, topped by a rather bubbly,frothy tan head, that sticks. The aroma is a bit subdued but is rather pleasant and mainlly of malts, dark roasted. Thids is actually not a bad tasting beer, mostly burnt,roasty oat like flavours with a nice hoppy undertones and a pleasant alcohol sensation near the end , some faint fruitiness throughout. Very pleasant on the palate..its a very varied mouthfeel,nice. I liked this unusual ale..the first beer from this brewery that has impressed me."
"If this is typical of this Black and Tan suggest you pass it up."
"Drinkability- About average for a black and tan. Surely blows away Mississippi Mud, but then, what doesn't? I can make a better one on my own though. Still, worth a try."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry and slightly metallic scent that boasts of pale, crystal, black, and roasted malts. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry and malty flavor that boasts of stout malts and a warming finish. It also has a metallic off-flavor that really brings the taste down. It lingers in the aftertaste with the black malt earthiness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a beer with great potential. It's a fine concept, but the metallic character ruins it for me. It drinks decent, but this will be the last one I buy."
"This is my first beer from this brewery, and is also one of my first black & tans. This poured a dark brown, and created a nice head that lingered for a few minutes. The taste is rather strange and bitter sweet, but pleasant. It has a clean taste, with very little hint of alcohol in its flavor (surprising for something with 6.5% ABV). I was pleased with this beer, and I recommend that you try it."
"Black in color with some thin lines of red highlights; bubbly tan head, streaky lacing noticeable. The aroma is somewhat toasty  toasted wheat bread, some caramel undertones. Sweet and perky; pinpricks of hops are tucked into the body, along with chocolate, black licorise and coffee beans. After the introduction, it takes on a thick, smoky feel, warming releases more of the mentioned flavorings. Espresso and hazelnut tastings, just a tinge of bitterness rolling off the tongue, there is a semi-belly-warming affect. All in all, this is not a bad effort for a style thats hard to find (bottled)."
"The beer is a 22 oz bomber and I am drinking a room temp in a pint glass. The beer pours clear rich brown with a rocky tan head foaming up very large even with a gentle pour. The head fades very quickly to an edge layer. The beer exhibits some ruby tints when held to a light. Aroma is a mix of chocolate and coffee with light grassy hops mixing in. I also get some general roasted malt and actually a bit of dark fruit. FIrst sip reveals an average body and very fine carbonation. Flavor is fairly mild but roasted malt and chocolate are present with a bit of brown sugar sweetness. Very easy to drink with no hint of ABV. Pretty nice brew overall."
"Drinkability - goes down easy and has lots of rich flavor, I will have to try the two beers that make up this tasty creation."
"One could easily drink a bottle of this, but it isn't something that I would seek out. Except the price is fair, and like Mendocino's other brews, it'll do at the end of the month when the wallet is thin."
"I haven't had the 2 beers separately to know for sure who the culprit is here. But, I've got the notion that we're all a little guilty here. So, Mendocino, up yours for making this. And, up mine for drinking it. I finished the bomber because I figured ""What the fuck. I'm poor."""
"Brought this beer back from a trip to Tennessee. ...turns out I can get it here now. Oh well. Pour a brown color with a very tall head that has decent retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is very subdued, but roasted malts. The flavor is much more smooth than I expected. Very well blended. Has a mouthfeel that is thin for a stout and thick for a lighter beer. Finish is bitter. Good beer."
"This beer pours a dark brown, letting just enough light through to let me know its is brown. The head is about 3 fingers, tan and leaves a nice bit of lace as it retreats. The nose is a bit subdued, with hints of roasted notes coming through. The flavof is nice. There is a good harmony between the roasted character from the 'black' and the sweet caramel from the ""tan"" in this one. The finish is a good coffee bitter that keeps me going back for more. The feel is a shade shy of moderate, but it works for this beer. Drinkability is also good on this one. I will definately try both of the beers blended to make this one."
"Pours a clear burgundy under a 1.5 finger light beige head that has a very nice creamy consistency and settles very slowly, leaving great lace. The nose is fairly mild at first, with a bit of rasted nut and caramel, getting stronger as the brew warms. The mouth is well carbonated and fairly heavy. The first taste demonstrates that this is a good blend, with caramel malts and roasted nuts followed by a distinct espresso bitter. There is a very tingly sensation on the tongue, even after the liquid is gone, thanks to the hops. There is a quite bitter lasting impression, with a note of sweet caramel behind. The espresso impression might be a bit strong for some, but I would gladly have another."
"Appears much like a stout, extremely dark brown body, but there is a little more translucency than most stouts. Big off-white head, that fades to a rocky surface. Smell is slightly of coffee, and roasted malt, but there is a trace of doughiness and hops. Taste has a rich coffee flavor that is strongly cut with hops. This beer is definitely different enough to represent and affirm the black & tan is worthy of its own style."
"Pours a dark brown with some red showing. Thick, light brown head. Smells of mild chocolate, coffee, and carbonation. Good balance of roasted malts and a crisp, dry finish. Flavorful mouthfeel; not too heavy. A good session beer. Hope to try this one again. Worth a try."
"bomber bottle, with no freshness dating noted.. Pours dark molasas ark amber, white head, that dissolves to a tiny bubble film and leaves typical lacing. Nose is malty, with a hint of cocoa. Blend of two fine brews results in a middle of the road, brownish ale, nothing too spectacular in the result. Quaffable, sessioner."
"Drinkable? Yes. Enjoyable? Yes. A good combination? Not necessarily. Combine two decent beers and you get a decent beer, no big surprise. Still, it goes down smooth and provides some nice flavors for you to reflect on."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Excellent for a blended beer. Very drinkable, and a bit of fun trying to pick up the characteristics of the stout and ale used here. Nice!"
"Clear, shiny black in hue with easily apparent ruby influences. I did not need to hold the glass to a light to notice the crimson. It is a lovely color, I suppose. The head was beige in color and a healthy finger in height. The head retention was excellent as it only faded a smidge. The remaining head lasted for the entire consumption. Impressive. And this says nothing about the sheeting lace that was produced. Awesome! As the label states it is a mix of Black Hawk Stout and Eye of the Hawk but the nose doesnt provide aromas that would lead me to the same conclusion. In other words, I cant detect the roasty qualities; aside from a weak suggestion of chocolate but this was only at the back. The beginning is airy, then mineraly, and then weakly hoppy. The bouquet is apathetic, I mean purely pointless. It is not inviting because it doesnt say a word. The palate has many of the qualities of the nose. That is not necessarily a good thing. Why? I cant taste the stout, aside from a weak coffee-chocolate note at the finish that lingers into the aftertaste. This is pleasant but a bit weak. Luckily the other beer in this Ultimate Blend has enough flavors to keep me interested. There is a modest citrusy bite of hops. Caramel notes. As mentioned previously the stout qualities are found in the aftertaste and this melts wonderfully with the bitter afterglow. Obviously this is not a traditional Black-n-Tan but it works and quite well I might add. It is not World Class but it is tasty, especially considering it only set me back $1.99 for a bomber. This is a good quaffer, session beer material (okay, aside from the 6.50% abv) and tasty enough to match with a juicy burger. Medium in body, modest carbonation, the mouthfeel is decent, nothing special but it is not a hindrance either. It could be a tickle fuller. I consumed the bomber with ease. I purchased this beer in Minneapolis, MN. This is a good, simple beer. Worth a try."
"22 ounce bottle (Saratoga Springs, NY). Interesting, the mixture of stout and old ale make a nice blend. Definitely not your average everyday black and tan."
"Wyll-"
"Pours with a three-finger light brown head that fades slowly and leaves a little lace. Deep amber color, heavy bodied. Good carbonation. Nose is coffee/caramel. Unusual black & tan closer to a porter, nice rich taste. $2.49 for a 22oz bottle from Hoosick Street Discount Beverage Troy, NY."
"My experience with pre-mixed black & tans has been less than stellar thus far, so this beer did not have a particularly high mark to shoot for. While not a stellar beer, Black Eye made the mark with room to spare. Poured a rich black, with very little head. Aroma hinted of coffee. Flavor was an interesting counterplay of some richness, with coffee and unsweetened cocoa in the stout, and a thinner, slightly acidic hoppyness from the ale. The net effect, rather than a black & tan, was more of a robust porter. The strong ale component was a little harsh, but hung in the background."
"Drinkability  My first really drinkable Black & Tan. The style seems to be the whipping boy of microbrews, but Mendocino did it justice by mixing their Eye of the Hawk with their Black Hawk Stout."
"Mouth-feel is pleasant but not awesome. Drinkability is OK."
"Very nice appearance...dark with a chunky light chocolate head. Smell is a hint of malt with some smokiness. Taste was as expected, a blend of malts and hops with a light mouthfeel. Malt sweetness on the font palte finsihed with a nice tart hop finish. Mouthfeel was a bit light, but pleasant. Smooth enough on the drinkability scale...worth a try."
"Saratoga Springs version...dark, dark brown with mahagony highlights. Tan head with a creamy texture. Laces in thin sheets on the glass. Doughy aroma, lightly oily with a hop sense. Starts roasty, lots of mixed grain, a bit of smokiness. Well-balanced approach, pithy hoppiness asserts mid mouth, decent marriage with dark grain. Slight coffee on the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat compromised, slightly wavering and watery at the end. A bend of Black Hawk and and Eye of the Hawk Old Ale, it seems that the Stout is bringing most everything other than alcohol to the table here -- but at the same time being a little light in texture."
"I know better than to judge a beer by its label, but I must comment that I really dont like the look of this bottle. The bright silver packaging is reminiscent of malt liquors and light beers and radiates an instant cheapness. That said, this is actually not a bad beer at all. Its fairly drinkable and the flavor is respectable though limited. But I would easily choose a stout or an ale on the basis of their own merits and pass on this pre-configured mix. Meanwhile, this beer should seek professional counseling to sort out its impending identity crisis."
"Drinkable works well with Olive oil rich foods."
"Decent. This stuff is a dark black colour with ruby highlights and a small white/tan head. The aromas are overly malty with some nice roasted chocolate and caramel flavors in the mix as well. The taste is chocolatey, caramely, and vey roasted with some slight citric hops in the background. The drinkability is excellent and the mouthfeel is great. Similar to Yuenglings B&T and at under $2 a bomber, it is also similar in cost."
"Thanks to el mocoso for the bottle!"
"I'll admit to being a ""blended beer"" novice, but this just isn't working for me. It looks more or less like a stout, smells like a mediocre porter, and tastes like compromise. It doesn't taste completely offensive. It just tastes like something struggling to figure out what it is."
"(Bottle- GBBF 03')"
"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is malt, touch of fruitiness. A black and tan that mixes Black Hawk Stout with Eye of the Hawk Ale. A interesting blend, both beers are there and you can pick out each one, but they blend together into a whole new beer. Malts are nutty, roasted, coffee and choclately. Hops are kind of subtle, spicy and grassy. Nicely balanced. Well done. Good stuff. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"A thought. Maybe black and tans should not be bottled? Poured from the tap to order seem better to me than this one. Anyway this is a good effort at bottling one."
"I admit I want to like Mendocino Brewing Co's beers more than I actually do. This 22oz. bomber was supplied most kindly by a friend. Color was stoutlike but no head or lacing was a downer. Aroma was actually quite good with some roasted maltiness. Pretty smooth roasted taste with a smidge of hops, not bad, just kind of mainstream. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, might be a better winter brew but I doubt I will have it again."

"Mendocino should do the same, when making it, I think."
"This is a blend of Eye of the Hawk and Black Hawk. Now I really like both of those beers (especially the EOTH) but I really don't think this is a good blend. It's not bad but I don't think they complement each other well. The Eye of the hawk tends to make the stout to hoppy and the stout drops the intensity of the Eye of the Hawk. Nice concpet but in this case I don't think it worked all that well."
