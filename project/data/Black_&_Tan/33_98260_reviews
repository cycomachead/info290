"Not a fan of this beer at all. Totally disappointed."

"O - Overall this was not my favourite shabadoo offering from Berkshire. Still, not bad."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good variation of style, this is a very good flavorful beer to drink for a long time if youâ€™re looking for something different."
