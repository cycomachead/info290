"A mix of Phoenix Pale Ale and O'Reilly's Irish Stout. The combination ends up a clear chestnut colour and came topped with a thin, light tan head. Good retention with some lacing throughout. The aroma was basically roasted barley and grapefruit hoppiness, kind of a weird combo, but appealing. Solid bitterness with light caramel, some roast and burnt character, and lingering citrus. Medium/light body and carbonation, fairly dry. This really works. The flavours meld quite well, producing a highly drinkable beer."
