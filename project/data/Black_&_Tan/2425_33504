2.84,6.4,4,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"I'm not sure if this new half n' half is a good idea by Zlatopramen. But then this is a a weird style. My bottle poured with about two centimeters of foam and with a very dark amber color. The aroma was first dominated by a sugarcane sweet smell gradually taken over by flowery hops. The taste was a strange mix of roasted malts and red berries. To it's advantage I must say that it has a pronounced character and a taste that doesn't leave any empty spaces. Not for my palate, though.","JanM","0"
