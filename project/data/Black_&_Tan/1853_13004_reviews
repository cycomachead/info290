"D - Drinks more like a pale ale than a stout. I would be more inclined to drink more of these than plain stouts in one setting, though. Overall, it's quite a good offering."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thin off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a slightly malty scent with a nice hop aroma. The taste is great. It has excellent malt complexity and balance. It also has a great hop flavor that really makes this beer. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks great. I love the hops here; an awesome black and tan."
"Wow what a great pour!The pour starts out out black on top and light on bottem but u can watch it come together to this great deep amber with a 1/2 inch head that never leaves and leaves some great lacing.Aroma is of highly roast malts with a nice intertwined roasty flavor with some light hoppiness coming from the pale mixed in.Very drinkable and definently tasty just a great beer."
