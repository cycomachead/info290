3.5,0,,,,,,"I didn't really know what to expect, but this is an interesting, if ultimately light and inoffensive offering.","biboergosum","Jun 15, 2009"
3.72,0,,,,,,"This is one strange duck, and had some things going on that I would never expect in a black & tan. I think I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I would if it had followed the style more closely. I feel like I drank some bizarro Belgian take on the style from a Quebec brewery, which is probably exactly what I did. Weird, and you know what... kinda good.","bobsy","Sep 11, 2008"
3.63,0,,,,,,"Quite a dark brown with ruby highlights. Solidly dense foam. Nose is.. interesting. Fruit and horseblanket, lambic-light sourness. Flavour is tart and dry with earthiness and toasted and husky grain. Raisins and dark fruit, mild hops. Moderate body with a sharp carbonation. Finishes fairly clean and crisp. Kind of an oddball Belgian styled? black and tan.","allergictomacros","Beers"
2.59,0,,,,,,"Bottle: Poured a light black color ale with a good size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light dry coffee is some what bland. Taste is a mix between some light dry coffee notes with some lightly roasted malt. Body is just too thin for the style with some good carbonation. No fundamental flaws but not a whole lots of character as well.","Phyl21ca","0"
