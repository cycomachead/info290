Head retention is decent enough, and there's an OK amount of lacing.  The brew smells like toffee, tea, and grainy malt.  It tastes like grainy/bready malt, caramel, toffee, tea and some herbalness.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and is easy to drink.  It's better than I thought it would be.  $2.99 for a quart of this isn't too bad at all.  For the price, it's certainly worth a try!","bluejacket74","Mar 10, 2015"

4.41,40.9,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mississippi Mud Black & Tan brewed by Mississippi Brewing Co., with an ABV of 5.0% This brew pours out a nice light brown color with a nice off white head. It reminds me of sweet tea, in color. The smell is rich with flavor, you pick up on grains and malts. There is a nice mild sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The smell is real inviting, you also pick up on some caramel malts.  Now for the taste, it is bold with flavor.  A mild sweetness at first.  You pick up on malts, and mild roasted grains.  There is a lot going on in this brew, but it is smooth. The mouthfeel is smooth, but rich with flavor.  Mississippi Mud Black & Tan has a real nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5. Mississippi Brewing Co., did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Feb 26, 2015"

It pours with a bit fizzy head that retreats to the edges of the glass and lingers. There is a fair amount of caramel malt in the flavour, with a bit of Pilsner zest in the mouthfeel. I would agree that it is a far cry from a pub Black and Tan, but for the price and overall packaging, it's worth picking up from time to time.","Bunman3","Feb 19, 2015"

I kind of liked this because it isn't heavy like some porters.  But it is confusing as I was expecting something heavier given the flavor.

Especially since the craft beer craze is demanding what I believe is too much money for average to below average tasting brews. I don't know who is pricing things this high; is it the brewer, the distributor,  the retailer, or all the above? Of course $1.99 isn't high for a full pint of pretty decent black and tan blend. I would actually rate this higher than the Yuengling's version as Yuengling was my first regular store-bought B&T until I discovered Mississippi Mud and how good it tasted.","Ricko","Dec 18, 2014"

Pours to a dark root beer color with a tan head that hangs on for a while.  On the taste the brew hits upfront with a nice heavy mouthfeel.  Continuing the taste the brew has a a distinct dryness of the cocoa from the porter and the pilsner.  Sweet and slightly bitter when it kicks in then the finish is very dry and clean with only mild lingering bitterness.  Very refreshing when one is in the mood for a porter but not the heavy syrupy wallop that it packs.  Also I like the cool bottle, as it reminds me of a growler that always contains good brew, the real beer (32 oz) size.","mooseisloose","Nov 26, 2014"

Poured into a pilsner glass, the color is a wonderfully reddish brown with some garnet highlights, a quickly dissipating head and perfect clarity. Aroma is predominantly of caramel malts, roasted grain, cereal; some hops detected at the finish, noble and slightly spicy. The taste is light, malty, and follows the nose very faithfully. Grainy, sweet, caramel and bread, some roastiness, very little hop flavor detected. Mouthfeel is medium-thin and highly carbonated. I'm sure this brew gets a bad rap from being ubiquitous and somewhat small in flavor. The aroma is definitely the best part but it is still a very enjoyable and pleasant session beer that I don't turn my nose up to and would definitely drink again.","Aaron_Ramson","Oct 15, 2013"

You wont catch me sippin the watered down taste of a peat bog type of brew such as busch lite or others. No pansy IPAs eitha, only that real, raw, smooth, the taste of a Mangrove lagune, canoe gliding ontop of a soup of brown and black clouds. It picked me up like a dust storm in eastern Washington and when that sappy nectar finally endured it's last drop, me and my bussdown were thoroughly pleased, and pleasured. By the mud, see when you give yourself to something bigger than you, you fall back into the mud and let the dirt slowly seep over your body and brown out your sight. It's as if you could go to the local WinCo and pick out an untainted 18 year old virgin, fresh out of high school with everything a pimp knew to, out of a line of well past their golden years milfs, pregnant teenage junkies, and overweight soccer moms looking for some love. That is Mississippi Mud my friends, it's as if mother earths loins were split on the rim of your lips and she let out a stream foggy as the winding meander dumping silts and sands carried from foreign lands down to Mississippi Delta.","MatBigDogPELLI","Dec 19, 2012"

On the nose this beer has a light essence of roasted malts, some faint coffee notes and that's about it - not too complex of an aroma with this beer. On tasting this beer the simplicity of the aromas carried through to the taste....some roasted malt flavors...very little hop character which could have provided this beer with a wee bit more depth.

It's unexpected, but not really all that off-putting somehow. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta watery feel.

Odors of citrus and roasted caramel suggest that the lager and ale used to make this B&T are probably worthy of being enjoyed separately as well as together. The taste is creamy, roasted caramel with undertones of sweet citrus flesh. Mississippi Mud has a thicker, more pleasant body than other Black & Tans I've had.","keeganfrank","Nov 10, 2010"

Head then disspated into nothing with NO lacing whatsoever. Dang. Smells a bit sour almost stout-like, kinda reminds me of a Guinness smell, some dark roasted malts, almost peat like maltiness and some faint smoke. The taste, well, kinda reminds me of a Guinness as well, charred malts with some sweet malt in the center, and mild bitter aftertaste. I am not detecting much ""Continnental Pilsner"" in there, no noble hop, but the mouthfeel and effervescence is the giveaway. Much more active carbonation on the tongue than a regular stout from the pilsner base. Hmm, I am tasting some syrupiness too like a cheap pilsner, weird. Must have some adjuncts in there somewhere based on that corn syrup I just tasted. Overall an interesting brew, good conversation piece because of the jug bottle and obviously aimed at macro and Guinness fans alike. I would say it is actually somewhat drinkable once you can get past the adjuncts creeping through the brew.","Star80","Nov 09, 2010"

Pleasant buzz after the first 10 ounces, but this being 5%, I'm sure it's the same pleasant buzz found after a Bud or Miller. Aftertaste is almost nonexistent, which is a better result than some of the other reviews I read here. I'd have to say it probably is worth the less than $4 paid, and certainly not disappointing.

A light malt smell of roasted malts along with some butterscotch/caramel and toffee mixed in for a little sweetness. This beer starts to lose it after this. Light-to-medium bodied with some sweetness to it, but it also comes across as a little slick and syrupy. Has a slightly dry finish from some roasted malts and a twinge of hops, although the malts pretty much nullify any significant malt presence. A somewhat dull beer that really doesn't improve while it warms (that 32 oz. bottle sure starts to look dumpable after a while).

History, in this case, influenced my decision to buy this beer again. I have many positive memories with this brew - particularly long nights of Mud and Mario Party with my friend Daniel. So, I was very excited to pick up a four pack of jugs. Really, the jug is the best part of this beer. I could probably drink a few of these and hardly notice. This is because the beer, which calls itself a 'black and tan', is actually a strange flavored amber. It pours into the glass and you wonder for a minute: which beer from my fridge did I just poor? Was it an ale? Was it an amber? But alas, you come to the conclusion that you did, in fact, pour yourself a 'black and tan' beer and got nothing of the sort. The head bubbled up nicely, but for a short duration. I took a drink and imagined the perfect blend of ale and stout - and only in my imagination would this occur. The taste is that of a medium bodied red beer. I have no problem drinking these; its not an offensive beer by any means. In fact, I polished off the four without much whincing.","GuinnessSmurf","Oct 17, 2003"

If it wasn't for the metal taste/smell, it would have gotten a way better review. Sure, I like metal, but musically, not taste. Other than that, it was an above average atempt at a black and tan.

2.66,-15,3,2,3,2,3,"The most interesting this about this beer is the bottle. The pour yielded a huge off white head that filled my 500ml pilsner glass to the top. Promising. The odor is sweet and somewhat pungent. Normally I am immediately turned off by a big pungent smell, but here its mild so I proceed. To expect a world class beer here would be to set oneself up for certain disappointment. Obviously this is not a world class beer. What this beer represents is a relatively inexpensive alternative to the common dark swill. The taste is subtle and smooth and the mouthfeel is more watery than I would like, but it is definitely drinkable. It has a fair balance between a pleasant sweetness and light roasted flavor. As far as it being the combination of a ""Robust english porter and a continental pilsner' as so dictated on the bottle, I think they are at least somewhat accurate. It is definitely the unique combination of a pilsner (a light light pilsner Urquell) and a porter (NOT robust), but it is nothing to write home about. It is however strangely enough, it is growing on me as it warms up.","TripelJ","Jun 21, 2003"

It pours a clear mahogany body that's topped by a short but creamy tan head. The head retention is only fair, and it drops shortly to a thin collar and whispy surface covering but leaves some lace initially. Fruitiness is prevelent in the nose, backed up by a touch of lightly caramel and cocoa-tinged malt. There's not alot going on, but it's actually quite nice and very welcoming. The body is light and it's crisp on the tongue. In the flavor, assorted fruits (apple, grape, orange, berry) and chocolate/cocoa-tinged malt combine in a mildly sweet cornicopia of drinkability. There's no noticeable hop flavor present, and the bitterness plays only a supporting role. It finishes with a flourish of fruit followed by a soft note of cocoa, and then dries out with a very mild note of alcohol and a touch of hop bitterness. Although it's very simplistic, it is actually quite quaffable. It has more character that most mainstream American lagers and makes a good crossover beer for the uninitiated.","NeroFiddled","May 05, 2003"

Well, hey I bought into it, now let's see what this beer is made of. It pours a deep dark ruby tint, and the head is filled with very large bubbles and it is cream and color. Head is sticking around for at least awhile, and the lace is clinging to the sides of my glass. The aroma is very faint, I can barely detect some grainines along with somekind of malt thrown in to give off a sweet aroma. No hops to be sniffed here, oh well let's see how it tastes. Very smooth and on the lighter side, but it brings a fruit tone in the finish that I find very pleasant. This is nothing exceptional, but I find it pretty drinkable. A bitterness along with a semi sour aftertaste is left, but I don't think it's a mistake, somebody tried to make it taste like that. Very light body and thin in the mouth, definitely doesn't have the texture of a real porter mixed anywhere in there. I could drink a couple of these and find myself admiring the bottles, but I probably will never buy this beer again.
