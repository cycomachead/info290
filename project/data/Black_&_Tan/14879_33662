I am assuming this bottle is a little older than is optimal, but that's OK. Aroma is really interesting. Pine and citrus up front with string sweet roasted malt notes and hints of chocolate and molasses. Flavor is big sweet notes, followed by lingering roast. Only a bit of bitter pine, and it is just a bit overly sweet, but not undrinkable. Medium slick mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. Cool beer.","BMMillsy","May 12, 2013"

3.3,-14.1,4.5,2,4,2.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is similarly an exercise in extremes. The oatmeal earthy character and acidity is really nice, and goes well with citrusy hops in the middle, but the excessive burnt flavors don't combine great with the hoppy dry bitterness. Body is smooth, fluid, and crisp at least. Drinkability suffers due to the excess in everything, but the beer isn't tough to down over time. This is a tough style to judge, but this beer is probably a good representative of it.","veinless","Apr 02, 2011"
3.83,-0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours very dark, bordering on black with a good tan head. Nice retention and a bit of lacing is it goes down. The nose brings forward lots of roasted malt along with some mild piney hops. Touch of earthiness in the background. The flavor consists mostly of roasted malt with some mild bitterness coming through in the finish. A bit of an alcohol presence on the swallow as well. Pretty drinkable; probably the best bottled black & tan that I've had and worthy of the #1 slot here on BA.","Thorpe429","Mar 07, 2011"

The 33% B.O.R.I.S Oatmeal-Imperial stout presents itself boldly at times and it seems like it is actually a higher percentage than stated. The bitterness on this beer is perfectly balanced and the best 'bitter' taste I've ever experienced. I have not had very many black and tans before, but this one was by far the best.","Jesse13713","Feb 22, 2011"
3.93,2.3,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Medium bodied that is pretty hop forward with hints of earthy pine and sweet citrus flavor. Slightly bitter and floral but balanced by roasted chocolate malt, licorice, hazelnut and toffee. This beer is aggressively hopped and seems more like a black IPA up front with hops that linger throughout into a dry finish. Slightly smokey toward the end of the palate with hints of licorice and roasted malt. Slightly sweet dry finish. Weird!","corby112","Jan 12, 2011"
3.55,-7.6,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"D: Not a bad beer overall but not something I'd like to drink everyday. I think half of the reason people like black and tans is for the ascetic appearance of the two beers being layered. This just tastes like a hoppy stout. A great and unique stab at the ""style"" though. I dig it.","scottfrie","Jan 12, 2011"

5,30.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Aroma is strongly hoppy, with a background of smoky, oily mocha and hints of charred wood and brown sugar. It pours a lovely dark-chocolate brown with a VERY thick light tan head that hands around for a bit and leaves some substantial lacing. Flavor has the hoppiness and grapefruit hint of a good IPA, and the roast quality coffee, unsweet chocolate and molasses tones of a good stout. The disparate flavors do not fight, but complement each other very nicely. It has hints of both hoppy bitterness and molasses sweetness that are nicely balanced. Texture is smooth and tingly, leaving behind both subtle hop bitterness and a whisper of sweetness, as well as a fairly persistent fizz. The stout and IPA elements are all very good, and the mixture of 2/3 IPA and 1/3 stout makes them balance very well. I love both stouts and IPAs, and this beer has the best of both worlds. Bodacious indeed!","Cyberkedi","Nov 08, 2010"
4.15,8.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Although, the strong bite at the finish pretty much wipes out any residual roasty malt-ness. Overall a very nice beer. Perhaps this is a black IPA?","Mebuzzard","Oct 23, 2010"

4.62,20.3,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Final notes: However you drink this, it's a great beer, and likely the best Black and Tan that's commercially brewed you'll ever find. If you like a super hoppy and bitter beer, drink it fresh and it's a perfect Black IPA flavor-wise. If you prefer to get more of the B.O.R.I.S. flavors, then age this beer a few months to mellow the hops enough that they don't quash all the wonderful stoutness. This is how I prefer this beer...","Spider889","Sep 23, 2010"

4.14,7.8,4.5,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability - Great drinkability. I finished my 22 oz bomber in about an hour, and I was upset that I didn't have another. I would love to drink more than 1 in a night, but it gets to be pricey when you can only buy $8 bombers of it. This one hides the alcohol nicely and is a treat to drink. If you have not tried a black and tan brew, this IS THE ONE that you should try, hands down!","Bonis","Jul 29, 2010"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Quite a nice black and tan, but then again, a black and tan is only as good as its base components, and both base beers for this one are excellent. The stout brings some nice roasty and chocolate flavors and the IPA brings some nice citrus fruitiness and sweet malt. Pours black with a nice initial head and some scant lacing. Smells dry and a tad dusty with cocoa and citrus peel. Nicely balanced flavors with the dry chocolate of the stout and the juicy citrus of the hops combining very nicely and creating a long, pleasant, bitter finish with a touch of rich but dry sweetness at the base. Bitter and dry in the mouth. Quite nice.","Georgiabeer","Jun 16, 2010"
3.92,2.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"As I mentioned earlier, I was unsure of what to expect with this one, but it turned out very nicely and I can see myself purchasing this again. At $9,99 / 22oz, however, it could be a little bit before I pick up another. Ten dollars is totally worth it, though, if you've never tried this.","SilentSabre","May 22, 2010"

4.1,6.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this beer, which is surprising because I enjoy both of the base beers. I was shown to be incorrect in my assumptions, the juxtaposition of flavors and aromas work very well. Worth a shot.","glid02","Apr 27, 2010"
3.88,1,5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinks pretty well. One of these would be enough for me. I really enjoy the attempt at this beer, but the flavor just doesn't mesh as well as I'd hoped. A unique beer that is worthy of a try.","jera1350","Mar 31, 2010"

4.09,6.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"pours pitch black with a nice and fluffy tan head. aroma is mostly pine tree and pine needle smelling with a hint of coffee and caramel. when you drink it, its mostly stoutish, as is tastes very coffee like, roasty, full bodied and malty with a hint of hops. this stuff truly is a beautiful mix of a great IPA and a great stout.","caresville","Oct 26, 2009"
4.34,13,4,5,4,4,4.5,"D - I'm impressed, this may be the first black and tan that I have ever actually liked. The blend is well done with noticeable contributions from each beer. It is a testament to the obscene intensity of the stout that it dominates the flavor even though it is only 1/3 of the blend. Despite the stouts flavor dominance, the IPA makes a significant hop aroma contribution and adds a hop flavor backbone that was sadly lacking in the strait Imperial Stout. In the end, this really comes off as a weaker version of what I had hoped BORIS would be. The IPA dilutes the overwhelming, sticky malt soup of the stout and balances it with a hop character that not only makes it more drinkable but also works with the dark malts to add complexity, especially in the finish, that was simply not there before. If they brewed this as one beer, turned everything up about 20% and called it an Imperial Porter, it could be their best beer and it might even live up to the hype that BORIS has somehow generated.","nickfl","Oct 16, 2009"
3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The aroma is both very hoppy and very toasted with chocolate, coffee, and molasses. The appearance is dark with a tan head and a few particles.

Aromas are of citrus, pine needles, and roasted malts. At 67% IPA, there is a good dose of hops up front. The stout flavors then kick in, and at only 33%, it seems to balance everything out quite effectively. Overall, Satisfying. ~","Goldfish19","Oct 02, 2009"

The majority of the smell seems to smell like chocolate covered cherries. The taste is very unique, I have never really mixed any craft beers before, but this shows me what it could bring, you get the nice chocolate and cherry flavors from the boris with an IPA bitter end to it... very interesting.

This is tremendous, delicious, and a fine concoction. Creamy but also rough-hopped, smooth and a bit sweet, a great mouthfeel.

The aroma is a very spicy hop citrus with some light lingering notes of marshmellow, chared malts and some coffee. Makes me think of a black IPA. The taste fits the perception of a ""black IPA"" perfectly. Very unique favors. The hoppy bitterness mixes with dark toasted malts of the R.I.S. The hops take up most of the flavor profile notes of grapefruit peels, maybe a little licorice with some vanilla toffee malts. Almost brunt malt profile. Very Roasty, bitter and oily palate.

Aromas are quite nice mixes, giving it its ""bodacious"" title I guess. Nice subtle hops and malts combined with a bready, wheaty textures that are nicely roasted and chocolate-wrapped. What's great is that all of these smells really are subtly combined, so that nothing is either overpowering or strange. Taste wise is smoother and cleaner than the smell would have you believe. More roasty and mocha-coffee flavors than what could have been with the IPA flavors. Mouthfeel works well with this drink, giving it a smooth creamy texture, gelling all flavors together.

Flavors collied bringing upfront chocolate roasty notes this is basically BORIS the Crusher lite, the IPA gets over shadowed by the roasted malts much like this years Stone Anniversary black IPAs are somewhat of a contradiction. This mix of the two works so well 67% Hoppin' to Heaven IPA and 33% BORIS RIS. Big roasted malt with dark chocolate dryness blended with sweet fruity citric hops, mild alcohol finishes so lucious and juicy with hop flavor more so in the pine department. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied creamy textured, evenly carbonated and just plain kick ass. Butter smooth like a couple of slabs of Parkay, even flow till the 22 oz disappears. Drinkability is caseworthy or just buy a case of their IPA and Boris and blend yourself that way you will have three different beers from two cases, I like that idea.","WVbeergeek","Jan 16, 2008"
4.25,10.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours an inky black with a two finger brown sugar-tinted rocky head of dense cream. Excellent retention leaves spiderweb lacing. The aroma of stout prevails here; dark chocolate and deeply roasted barley; dark caramel and blackstrap molasses with some light toffee; an american citrus hop note is just perceivable in the background. The first sip is sweet with dark crystal malt and caramel. The flavor slowly turns to coffee and dark chocolate, and finally ends with a drying charred taste and a solid fruity american hop aftertaste. A complex beer for the style, with much greater depth and range than average. the sweetness tickles the palate upfront, then transformes into rich chocolate and coffee, and is well-balanced by the burnt character and hop bittnerness that eventually dries the tounge and halts residual sweetness. The body is a standard medium and ligter than the nose suggests, and carbonation is light allowing the robust flavors the linger a moment before being swept away. While this is surely more formidable a beer than most black and tan's the drinkablity is good so long as you like a good stout or IPA on its own. If one were looking for a B&T to crossover from macros- one should look elsewhere. The finish is dry and holds onto the roast character with a hint of cascade, but nothing overpowering. A terrific and innovative twist on the style as well as a solution to turning out an addition offering from a new brewery operated by one man. Ask him about serving this beer through coffee beans or fresh hops.","PBRstreetgang","Jan 04, 2008"

Head is going nowhere fast, coating the glass with a solid thin layer of lace. Aroma is roasty dark malt with pine hops character.

Th e malt comes out at the start with chocolate and coffee flavors, maybe a hint of some dried fruit. Then, halfway, an intense grapefruit bitterness hits the palate, folowed by some grassy and earthy flavors at the end. The is surprisingly medium bodied, it does gain some weight after each taste.

The black malts and hops combine for a huge bitter blast. It's got the stout feel, but is lighter and easier to put down. Nevertheless, it's still rich and filling. The mouthfeel is fine.

It tastes pretty much the same way it smells, except that there's some coffee in the taste too. There's a nice mix of sweet and bitter with this beer, however the bitterness is a bit stronger which isn't a bad thing at all. There's a lingering bitter aftertaste. Good balance between the IPA and stout. Mouthfeel is medium, and it's creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it's nice and easy to drink.
