"Pours a slightly murky honey brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and brewed coffee. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great aroma and tasty flavor but the Grazias part of the beer is lost in all of the coffee aromas and flavors."
