"Final Thoughts: All in all, it was an interesting experience, but i wouldn't say I'll be eagerly awaiting my next black and tan. All it all, I think it was a posistive experience, but really the rummy, carbonation note needs some work."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with okay flavors and aromas."
"O- I've never had anything from Hockley in the past, this is okay, unfortunately somewhat forgettable."

"The flavor is better than the smell would indicate. There are elements of a stout (black coffee and burnt grain) and a pale ale (nice hop finish). The body is too thin for any beer, closer to soda. Good aftertaste of mocha and white pepper."
"This poured with a finger of foamy-soaping head which reduced quickly and leaft no lacing. It has an opaque black body. On the aroma I get mostly licorice but also dark (and cold) coffee and rootbeer. I find the taste to be tangy with the flavours of roasted malts, with the the coffee and licorice. It ends with a hit of hops. I find both the body and carbonation to be low-to-medium but it has a very silky smooth feel. Overall, I find this to be a good pick."

"B&Ts are scarce around here, but if anyone were to ask me to recommend one, this would probably be my first choice. I'll probably get it again at some point, too. People hoping for a sweeter dark beer like typical brown ales or (maybe) some stouts/porters may be disappointed, but I still like what Hockley has done here. Worth a try."

"Overall, a perfectly pleasant and well-rounded example of a black and tan, but it doesn't set the world alight and make me wish I had more!"

"Mouthfeel - aggressively carbonated."
"okay carbonation. overall a decent drink."
"O - surprised to see this as a packaged beverage, props for creativity, a decent enough drink worth a purchase, but I'd rather have it made at the pub"
"This is an interesting beer, comes off strong but very light tasting. Carbonation makes the beer a little unbalanced, but overall tasty and drinkable. Worth a try."
"O - another decent offering from Hockley I grabbed in their summer mixer pack"
"no reason not to try this one and the price is right so that's a selling point"
"a nice tasting beer. worth checking out."
"A decent enough, robust blend of a beer - except for the dodgy, somewhat unpleasantly pithy bitter character, perhaps. Hard to say exactly from which side of the dual inputs that this originates, but this would be all the more enjoyable in its absence."
"Black and Tans haven't really hit the spot for me yet. This is just an okay beer that really looked good when poured."
"This one really surprised me, there's a great dark beer hidden away in this can that hits all the high notes for an easy-drinking dark ale. And the abv% keeps it well within session beer range, of which it will make a very satisfying one indeed. I'll be going back for more of this for sure."
"There are no off flavours and the too-light body does come with the benefit of added drinkability. I can't say I'm a fan of black and tan but it is certainly drinkable; I can even see this being enjoyable if you're in the mood for such a beverage."
"D - Pretty good drinkability. Being light and dry makes this an easy quaffer, but the darkness adds some nice flavour."
"Drink - The beer had a nice smell and taste but it came across as too thin and watery. With a little tinkering this could be a really good beer."
"For a cold beer on a surprisingly hot day, from my local LCBO, this was not too bad. Pours brownish, with spider with a lacing trail. A significant sour edge that builds up, it is medium mouthfeeled, and sweetish but not too sweet. Has some interesting notes that contribute to drinkability.Malt aroma."
"I'll get this one again."
"Overall, a pretty drinkable beer. It would be easy to put a few of these back in a pub or on a deck. Or a couch."
"I think I cellared this can of beer a little too long but overall it still impressed, I'd like to try it fresher next time."
"Hockley Valley had done two delicious one-offs for a local cask festival, dubbed 'Black Forest Stout' and 'Peanut Butter and Jam Ale', both of which I enjoyed tremendously. This strongly reminds me of them, not the least because it's flavourful, sessionable and appreciably well-crafted. Fortunately, unlike the other two, this is one I can have again!"
"This marks my first Black and Tan and Hockley Valley provided me with a decent interpretation of the style. It's not all that exciting but I find the concept pretty interesting and I'm happy I could get my hands on a rare style. Like I said earlier, the stout in the beer is much more dominant then their golden ale, and I think overall this probably helped the beer. I'd be open to trying other interpretations of the style but probably won't be buying this one again."
"Nothing really remarkable here. Basically an irish stout that has been mellowed out a bit. Not quite my thing, but an interesting change of pace."
"Nb. This is rated to style. All things being equal I'd have scored this a lot lower, but for a black & tan its surprisingly decent."
"Front side is malt forward you get roast and toastiness some nut-like tones all well balanced with a sturdy pleasing hop bitterness...finish remains roasty-toast with good hop balance then a quick dry bitter end, Very pleasant, very rounded, balanced and finished. Like a porter with more pale malt instead of caramalt or crystal. Very drinkable...a dark sessioner."
"Pours a dark brown with thin tan head that dissipated quickly. Smell is very subtle, a bit of roasted malt. Some roasted chocolate taste, with mild bitterness. Nice carbonation level and I could drink several of these. Nothing really great here, but it still is pleasant enough."
