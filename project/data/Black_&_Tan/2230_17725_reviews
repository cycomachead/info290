"The carbonation is strong and lager-like with small bubbles. The liquid is mid-smooth."

"D: Not a beer I'll buy again. Not bad, but not the opposite either."
"Nothing really stands out, but nothing is really bad. Goes probably well with the traditional Swedish cuisine."
"The gaudy label with bright colours made me keep lowered expectations, but I think it's an okay, but average, beer. I wouldn't turn it down, but I won't go out of my way to get it either."
"This Sweedish offering is okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find more and it definitely fails to achieve the Alt-style it seems to want to emulate."
