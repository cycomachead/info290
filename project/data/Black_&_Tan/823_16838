The taste was great with nice notes of the malt and a lot of chocolate flavors in the beginning which then led to a very clean finish. Easy drinking but with a lot of flavor. My favorite part though was the feel of the beer. Not overly thick, but a nice consistency that coated my mouth. I liked it a lot and would definitely recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","May 01, 2014"

About as good as I remember, though I keep waffling on whether I like this or Ten Penny better.

3.16,-11.5,4.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Sampled on October 6, 2011 from an over-the-counter growler available in a local beer store. The pour is a nicely dark brown color with bubbles collecting at the bottom and slowly sneaking up top to the tan, silky head. The aroma brings out malts, earth, and a dark fruit like plum. The body was thinner than I would have liked considering 40% of this black and tan is from a stout. The taste had this sickly sweet flavor which might have been more from yeast that hadn't quite matured. Connecticut recently allowed growler sales outside of pubs and I wonder if the trip to New Hampshire via a distributor might have tainted it. I bet it is bette on tap at the brewpub.","puboflyons","Jul 29, 2011"
3.63,1.7,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"O - Not bad. I always pass on this in stores due to the price and sizes. I'm pretty sure its only available in growler or flip top bottle. It was nice on tap though. I was actually shocked to find out it was a black and tan as the taste reminded me of a milk stout.","davey101","Jul 19, 2011"
3.9,9.2,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"D - A very nice brew... Lots of flavor and character... Super sessionable given it's 5% ABV...

3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A side note, this beer is a 60% blend of the Ten Penny Ale and some stout, and the beer comes across as a Scotch ale to me at least, almost no roast or anything dark about this beer at all. Interesting but I doubt it is a repeat for me.","drabmuh","May 07, 2011"

4.32,21,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Just found my notes recently from last summer's Northwest Connecticut Brewfest. I was told that this 'black & tan' brew consisted of 60% Ten Penny; 40% stout. Poured a dark brown hue, with over a finger of beige head, good retention, and good lacing. Detected all of the same essence in the nose from Ten Penny, e.g. coffee and caramel, as well as a big chocolate/mocha presence. Great, great aroma. The taste began with more of a caramel/malty tone, and then eventually progressed to a mocha flavor with a dry coffee/chocolate finish. Thick yet manageably smooth mouthfeel, with low carbonation. Very sessionable, and again, another one of my few repeat table visits during the 'fest.","donniecuffs","Apr 14, 2010"
3.75,5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark brown pour with a above average tan head. Smells of sweet caramel and toffee. Toffee malt dominates the taste. Also hints of caramel and roasted coffee. Not much hop profile. High carbonation and a lasting sweet after taste. The toffee is the major player in this beer.","uustal","Apr 06, 2010"
3.78,5.9,4.5,4,3,4.5,4.5,"Notes - On the last glass I noticed a LOT of dead yeast at the bottom of the glass. Usually I just drink it down, but it was unusual to drink it in anything besides an unfiltered wheat beer. I had a little before pouring the rest down the drain. The next day I woke up with a bit of a stomach ache. Not sure if the two are related, but I advice always keeping the growler standing up so the yeast stays on the bottom and then trying to avoid pouring the yeast in the end into your glass.","MikeBrandman","Mar 29, 2010"
4.33,21.3,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"D - Goes down so easy. Very refreshing. I could have multiple pints of this. I've never really had a beer like this one before. The only other beer I've tried from this brewery is the ten penny ale. Can't wait to seek some more out.","DNICE555","Beers"

Lacing about the glass from a slow and steady recession of the thick head of foam. Nose is hoppy with citrus and some malt. Also includes some sweetness and burnt grain akin to chocolate. Taste is minorly bitter upfront. Little bit of the chocolate character comes through as well. Med feel and low carb. Finish is quite crisp.

I tasted dark caramel, rich molasses, coffee, chocolate, hints of wood, roasted malt and caramel. Yum. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body full and the carbonation perfect.

It has a mild caramel/roasted scent. The taste is average. It has a light and easy drinking flavor that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It goes down easy, but it has a sour finish. I guess the yeast has given it some off flavors. Anyway, the mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I would have liked to try this one fresh out of the tanks.

On the palate, heavily bitter malts and fruity bittering hops hit first off, then doughiness comes in at the mid-palate before the beer finishes long and dry. Mouthfeel is quite thin and just a bit watery; I could have used more body in this beer. Overall, this is a drinkable beer that is only OK in the taste department.","geexploitation","Aug 18, 2006"

Also smells of soething in between bacon, liquid smoke, hickory, or bbq sauce. This bbq sauce flavor frames the flavor of the beer, but now also with some chocolate and a tiny bit of hops. Starts thick and luxurious, then finishes clean and crisp, wth a tiny bit of lingering bitterness.

There was also an incredible amount of lace. The glass was pretty much coated. The aroma was burnt malts, kind of like putting my nose into a wood fire. The flavor is kind of wierd. It has the mellow malts of a pale ale, but the bold and rich flavors of a porter. Dark chocolate, smokey malts, toffee, vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel was very full, chalky and cloying.

Aroma is creamy dark malts. The taste is upfront dark malts, coupled with the lighter body character of the ""tan"" portion of the brew. Closes with an almost slight citrus crisp hops bite.

The aroma is a rich, roasted malt. Mouthfeel is just a bit watery, not overly carbonated, but enjoyable. Flavor is a little smokey upfront, perhaps a bit chalky, with dark malts swirling in with brown sugar and dark chocolate. An understated hoppy undercurrent flows beneath and lingers a bit in the aftertaste. Yeast flavors seem under control on this one, and a pint is able to be poured without it foaming over. If this is truly the next incarnation of the Tartan Ale, it's a vast improvement.","far333","0"
