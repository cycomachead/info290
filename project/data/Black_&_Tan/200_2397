Light frothy head dissapates quickly., Smells decent like any other stout but light and modest. Has a strong metallic taste to it, quite strange. other than that eye of the hawkesque stout flavor is remarkable. mouthfeel is pretty nice, in the middle there.

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and a mild char aroma. Taste is much the same with a slight soy sauce taste on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Warming allowed some nice touches of roasted malt and light cocoa to balance in. First sip though left no doubt in my mind as to the direction this one was going in.

The smell is malty and sweet. Almost reminds me of a bock. The taste is actually pretty decent. It seems to have a pretty hefty cherry component somewhere, with some caramel and toffee. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, and leaves behind a bit of a tart cherry aftertaste. Overall, this is an alright beer. I wouldn't seek it out, but...I can drink it.","Retail1LO","Jun 09, 2011"

3.98,9.3,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,"Like a true black and tan--stout flavors are mitigated by a pale ale. My only complaint is the body which is on the thin side.

It's more of a marketing thing while many beers are blended, B&Ts are an odd concept and I'm not sure of the make up of this one and apparently are too lazy to use google. It's light in body and finishes like a porter with some mild sweetness at the front. The beer is boring overall but its quite drinkable.

3.63,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Mendocino Black Eye Ale is a pretty average beer. The roastiness of the ""Black"" was not very pronounced with little acrid, coffee, or chocolate.

Color is a clear to almost opaque very dark brown. Aroma is a clean roast, malt, toffee, cocoa. Flavor is like aroma plus bittersweetness stands out. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor, of medium length. And leaves me with a wish for another swallow. Session beer.","drpimento","Mar 14, 2010"

Not a bad little investment. It pours a barely translucent dark ruby brown topped by a finger or so of ecru foam. The nose comprises chocolate powder, light roasted malts, and some very light coffee. The taste is nearly identical, though some creamy caramel flows nicely into the finish. The body is firm medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Overall, nice bit o' brew, one that I would recommend as a not-so-roasty darker beer. Get some!","TMoney2591","Feb 04, 2010"

3.71,1.9,5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mendocino Black Eye Ale is just on the edge of brown and black. The big, fluffy, beige head has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a slightly sweet, roasty aroma, with tangy malt on the nose. There are notes of brown sugar and something slightly herbal. It's medium bodied and smooth. The finish is a little scratchy and metallic. It's a little sweet, a little bitter; good balance. It tastes roasty with notes of dark chocolate, licorice and black cherry. The rumbly, boozy finish makes it taste stronger than it is. Green bitterness provides the aftertaste. It's reasonably complex; not for chugging.","yesyouam","Jan 17, 2010"
3.38,-7.1,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"M/D - This is a very easy drinking black and tan, but by no means a great example. Very heavily skewed to the dark side. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but it is a refreshing beer.","mwa423","Jan 17, 2010"

There is a good harmony between the roasted character from the 'black' and the sweet caramel from the ""tan"" in this one. The finish is a good coffee bitter that keeps me going back for more.

The first taste demonstrates that this is a good blend, with caramel malts and roasted nuts followed by a distinct espresso bitter.

3.74,2.7,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Clear, shiny black in hue with easily apparent ruby influences. I did not need to hold the glass to a light to notice the crimson. It is a lovely color, I suppose. The head was beige in color and a healthy finger in height. The head retention was excellent as it only faded a smidge. The remaining head lasted for the entire consumption. Impressive. And this says nothing about the sheeting lace that was produced. Awesome! As the label states it is a mix of Black Hawk Stout and Eye of the Hawk but the nose doesnt provide aromas that would lead me to the same conclusion. In other words, I cant detect the roasty qualities; aside from a weak suggestion of chocolate but this was only at the back. The beginning is airy, then mineraly, and then weakly hoppy. The bouquet is apathetic, I mean purely pointless. It is not inviting because it doesnt say a word. The palate has many of the qualities of the nose. That is not necessarily a good thing. Why? I cant taste the stout, aside from a weak coffee-chocolate note at the finish that lingers into the aftertaste. This is pleasant but a bit weak. Luckily the other beer in this Ultimate Blend has enough flavors to keep me interested. There is a modest citrusy bite of hops. Caramel notes. As mentioned previously the stout qualities are found in the aftertaste and this melts wonderfully with the bitter afterglow. Obviously this is not a traditional Black-n-Tan but it works and quite well I might add. It is not World Class but it is tasty, especially considering it only set me back $1.99 for a bomber. This is a good quaffer, session beer material (okay, aside from the 6.50% abv) and tasty enough to match with a juicy burger. Medium in body, modest carbonation, the mouthfeel is decent, nothing special but it is not a hindrance either. It could be a tickle fuller. I consumed the bomber with ease.

Slight coffee on the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat compromised, slightly wavering and watery at the end. A bend of Black Hawk and and Eye of the Hawk Old Ale, it seems that the Stout is bringing most everything other than alcohol to the table here -- but at the same time being a little light in texture.","ADR","Feb 19, 2004"
3.38,-7.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I know better than to judge a beer by its label, but I must comment that I really dont like the look of this bottle. The bright silver packaging is reminiscent of malt liquors and light beers and radiates an instant cheapness. That said, this is actually not a bad beer at all. Its fairly drinkable and the flavor is respectable though limited. But I would easily choose a stout or an ale on the basis of their own merits and pass on this pre-configured mix. Meanwhile, this beer should seek professional counseling to sort out its impending identity crisis.","RedDiamond","Jan 21, 2004"

3.5,-3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Decent. This stuff is a dark black colour with ruby highlights and a small white/tan head. The aromas are overly malty with some nice roasted chocolate and caramel flavors in the mix as well. The taste is chocolatey, caramely, and vey roasted with some slight citric hops in the background. The drinkability is excellent and the mouthfeel is great. Similar to Yuenglings B&T and at under $2 a bomber, it is also similar in cost.","francisweizen","Oct 28, 2003"

It looks more or less like a stout, smells like a mediocre porter, and tastes like compromise. It doesn't taste completely offensive. It just tastes like something struggling to figure out what it is.","mickeymac","Sep 01, 2003"

3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is malt, touch of fruitiness. A black and tan that mixes Black Hawk Stout with Eye of the Hawk Ale. A interesting blend, both beers are there and you can pick out each one, but they blend together into a whole new beer. Malts are nutty, roasted, coffee and choclately. Hops are kind of subtle, spicy and grassy. Nicely balanced. Well done. Good stuff. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Jul 25, 2003"
3.21,-11.8,3.5,2.5,3,4,4,"A thought. Maybe black and tans should not be bottled? Poured from the tap to order seem better to me than this one. Anyway this is a good effort at bottling one.","Rumrunner","Nov 27, 2002"
3.71,1.9,2.5,4,4,3,3.5,"I admit I want to like Mendocino Brewing Co's beers more than I actually do. This 22oz. bomber was supplied most kindly by a friend. Color was stoutlike but no head or lacing was a downer. Aroma was actually quite good with some roasted maltiness. Pretty smooth roasted taste with a smidge of hops, not bad, just kind of mainstream. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, might be a better winter brew but I doubt I will have it again.","Mark","Oct 18, 2002"

3.6,-1.1,3,3,4,3,4,"This is a blend of Eye of the Hawk and Black Hawk. Now I really like both of those beers (especially the EOTH) but I really don't think this is a good blend. It's not bad but I don't think they complement each other well. The Eye of the hawk tends to make the stout to hoppy and the stout drops the intensity of the Eye of the Hawk. Nice concpet but in this case I don't think it worked all that well.","mattmaples","0"
