"O: A decent choice for those who enjoy sweet, malt forward beers. Carbonation keeps the beer slightly refreshing yet does derail the direction that the taste implies."
""
"It's a sour. Not bad but not expected."

"Overall bad. I'll have to try this again sometime since it's obviously not at its prime, but just a bad beer."

"It's always nice to get a growler of something. The appearance was nice and black with a coffee colored head. The smell was a lot of malt and very sweet. The taste was great with nice notes of the malt and a lot of chocolate flavors in the beginning which then led to a very clean finish. Easy drinking but with a lot of flavor. My favorite part though was the feel of the beer. Not overly thick, but a nice consistency that coated my mouth. I liked it a lot and would definitely recommend."

"Would you believe that I used to drink these right from the growler? My little joke was that I could say I ""only had one beer."" About as good as I remember, though I keep waffling on whether I like this or Ten Penny better. Maybe it's just that I had several of these in a row, but I felt like the stout started to dominate after the third pint. Kind of curious what it would be like on its own."

"Overall: This drinks almost like a good Euro dark lager or schwarzbier. For a black and tan, this is fairly good and would be one of the first black an tans I would reach for. For an overall beer this is ok. I much prefer Olde Burnside's Scotch ales more."
""
"Cheers!!"

"O: Drinkable, but not the first beer I'd reach to in the taproom. Definitely a good session beer, however, and I find Black and Tans notoriously hard to pin down as a style, so all things considered, give it a try!"

"Sampled on October 6, 2011 from an over-the-counter growler available in a local beer store. The pour is a nicely dark brown color with bubbles collecting at the bottom and slowly sneaking up top to the tan, silky head. The aroma brings out malts, earth, and a dark fruit like plum. The body was thinner than I would have liked considering 40% of this black and tan is from a stout. The taste had this sickly sweet flavor which might have been more from yeast that hadn't quite matured. Connecticut recently allowed growler sales outside of pubs and I wonder if the trip to New Hampshire via a distributor might have tainted it. I bet it is bette on tap at the brewpub."
"O - Not bad. I always pass on this in stores due to the price and sizes. I'm pretty sure its only available in growler or flip top bottle. It was nice on tap though. I was actually shocked to find out it was a black and tan as the taste reminded me of a milk stout."
"D - A very nice brew... Lots of flavor and character... Super sessionable given it's 5% ABV... This one blurs many a style guideline, but there's no denying it's a rather good brew... I can easily recommend picking this one up and will gladly do so if I'm every passing through CT again..."
"A side note, this beer is a 60% blend of the Ten Penny Ale and some stout, and the beer comes across as a Scotch ale to me at least, almost no roast or anything dark about this beer at all. Interesting but I doubt it is a repeat for me."
"Pours dark brown with a good light tan head and some spotty lacing along the sides of the tulip. Thin cap throughout and a bit of a collar. The nose brings some light diacetyl and toffee. Mostly the latter, though I think the former was present was well. Roasted malt there as well. The flavor is better with a nice combination of roast and some light caramel and toffee. Medium body and light carbonation. Good roast in finish. Pretty nice beer."
"t- nice nutty and toffee taste. Crisp and malty. Has a nice smooth and balanced very. Very easy to drink. Very good on a spring day"
"O/D: Quite a bit of flavor packed in this brew, not something I'd want over and over again, but worth giving it a shot. Light, but a decent offering."
"More notes: I understand that this is a blend of their Ten Penny Scotch ale and a house-special stout. I would really like to try that stout."
"Acidic flavor and quite thin. The darker, bisuity flavors are present but muted. Light hop throughout the taste, but the finish sour and citrusy."
"Dirty penny is absolutely a sessionable beer. I like this because it isn't light in color, it is full flavored, and local! Despite the fact that I wish my local beers offered better taste qualities and more variety, I will always support them. I will be picking this growler up again soon."
"Sk√ÖL!"
"Just found my notes recently from last summer's Northwest Connecticut Brewfest. I was told that this 'black & tan' brew consisted of 60% Ten Penny; 40% stout. Poured a dark brown hue, with over a finger of beige head, good retention, and good lacing. Detected all of the same essence in the nose from Ten Penny, e.g. coffee and caramel, as well as a big chocolate/mocha presence. Great, great aroma. The taste began with more of a caramel/malty tone, and then eventually progressed to a mocha flavor with a dry coffee/chocolate finish. Thick yet manageably smooth mouthfeel, with low carbonation. Very sessionable, and again, another one of my few repeat table visits during the 'fest."
"Dark brown pour with a above average tan head. Smells of sweet caramel and toffee. Toffee malt dominates the taste. Also hints of caramel and roasted coffee. Not much hop profile. High carbonation and a lasting sweet after taste. The toffee is the major player in this beer."
"Notes - On the last glass I noticed a LOT of dead yeast at the bottom of the glass. Usually I just drink it down, but it was unusual to drink it in anything besides an unfiltered wheat beer. I had a little before pouring the rest down the drain. The next day I woke up with a bit of a stomach ache. Not sure if the two are related, but I advice always keeping the growler standing up so the yeast stays on the bottom and then trying to avoid pouring the yeast in the end into your glass."
"D - Goes down so easy. Very refreshing. I could have multiple pints of this. I've never really had a beer like this one before. The only other beer I've tried from this brewery is the ten penny ale. Can't wait to seek some more out."
"Another winner by Olde Burnside. A nice roasted coffee flavor and extremely drinkable. Unlike any other bottled black and tan I have ever had, but I like it enough to buy it again. As with the last growler of theirs that I bought, this one is super fresh, and my buddy and I had no time polishing it off. I really want to eat this with some steak and potatoes. Highly recommended!"
"My buddy loved it, so it must hit the spot for some people. Just not for me"
"The feel of this beer was a bit of a medium feel. It was pleasing but not too exciting. It did go down pretty smooth and would make a good beer for food pairing."
"An ok beer, way too highly carbonated, luckily this faded with some time. Fairly sweet and pretty one noted, but definitely drinkable."
"Growler care of my frend Dan who was paying a visit from CT. Pours a dark brown with more than two fingers of tanned creamy head. Lacing about the glass from a slow and steady recession of the thick head of foam. Nose is hoppy with citrus and some malt. Also includes some sweetness and burnt grain akin to chocolate. Taste is minorly bitter upfront. Little bit of the chocolate character comes through as well. Med feel and low carb. Finish is quite crisp. Overall not bad and one of the more flavorful ""stock"" black and tans."
"D- Fairly high, would have liked a better, fuller mouthfeel, although I'll have no problem finishing off this growler. I can't say I'd buy it again, though, @ 11$ I can get many better growlers for a few bucks cheaper."
"great beer to drink by your fire place with your dog. throw your sweater on throw on some football and indulge in a growler of TPA's Dirty Penny."
"Off the tap at the Bluebird Tavern this beer was an opaque, burned-caramel color with a skim of mocha-like head. The retention was pretty good and the lacing in sliding curtains. The aroma was of mocha, roasted malt, toffee and chocolate. The flavors were equally complex and tawdry. I tasted dark caramel, rich molasses, coffee, chocolate, hints of wood, roasted malt and caramel. Yum. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body full and the carbonation perfect. Sweet and satisfying."
"Cheers!"
"D- bought the growler hoping to split it between two nights, but enjoyed it too much to put down. Just subtle and not overpowering enough to pour glass after glass, but not weak enough to mistake for poor quality. I will gladly get it another one!"
"Taste is smooth, with roasted chocolate flavor, and very drinkable. Not so drinkable that I can pound away the whole growler in one sitting, but very enjoyable as a refreshing beverage in warmer weather."
"Bit disappointed but hopefully I'll get a chance to try some of their other offerings in the future."
"Overall, you can put these down. Wish it was available in a bomber or smaller, and not in a $10.00 growler, but hey...why am I bitching -- right next to it was a $16.00 Rogue Dead Guy Growler! This was very decent. Worth the try."
"Pours a dark brown/black from the growler with a light airy caramel colored head that is huge - something like 3 fingers. It smells of dark malted grains and some light hoppiness, almost a homebrew smell to it. The taste is pretty good. Mostly a roasted grain taste to it with a hint of chocolate aftertaste. Not much hop flavor to it, but it seems to be there. The mouthfeel is nice and velvety and it is a decently drinkable beer. Definately worth a try."
"I think Ten Penny is one of the better Conn. breweries, but still has a pretty limited scope in terms of styles. Though I'm used to drinking layered Guinness and Harp black and tans, I think their blended version is better than average."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is sour almost lambic like. I think this might have sat a while. It has a mild caramel/roasted scent. The taste is average. It has a light and easy drinking flavor that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It goes down easy, but it has a sour finish. I guess the yeast has given it some off flavors. Anyway, the mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I would have liked to try this one fresh out of the tanks. As it is, I think I drank a sat beer that was past it's prime."
"Just as a note, his growler was given to me as a gift and sat in my fridge for over 3 weeks before I got around to drinking it and the carbonation and taste seemed to hold up very well, which has not been true of other beers I've bought in 64-oz jugs."
"Pours the color of motor oil, with a thick, big bubbled tan head that sinks into the beer to form a thin dusting on top of the body. Some soy sauce smells in the nose, along with heavily roasted, coffeeish malts and freshly innocculated dough. On the palate, heavily bitter malts and fruity bittering hops hit first off, then doughiness comes in at the mid-palate before the beer finishes long and dry. Mouthfeel is quite thin and just a bit watery; I could have used more body in this beer. Overall, this is a drinkable beer that is only OK in the taste department."
"Poured out as a dark brown ale, with bit uneven off white head that leaves good lacing behind. HAs some alcohol in the nose along with malt, caramel, and mollasses. Also smells of soething in between bacon, liquid smoke, hickory, or bbq sauce. This bbq sauce flavor frames the flavor of the beer, but now also with some chocolate and a tiny bit of hops. Starts thick and luxurious, then finishes clean and crisp, wth a tiny bit of lingering bitterness. For something that borders on smoked, this is a good beer to have a few rounds of, but I can see how it might grate on people."
"Overall a slightly above average offering. This would be a nice offering to complement a dessert course involving chocolate. Another solid offering from Olde Burnside."
"M&D - very smooth and balanced beer, as with other Olde Burnside brews, my father likes them as well, and he is a prototypical High Life Man, a great session beer for any hard worker, or oaf like me"
"Cheers!"
"Great appearance with a head that lasts! Color is real dark almost black.Has a great smokey taste. Thick lacing circles the glass with each sip. Dry finish with great carbonation. Small amount of bitterness. Medium bodied with a nice malt taste. Other than the mouthfeel and appearnce there is not much to the taste other than a malty smoke. Very drinkable. No real hop character other than a touch of bitterness. Not a bad black & tan. But i'd prefer a guinness and bass."
":-)"
"This was quite a drinkable black & tan, and I wouldn't mind picking up a growler (if I found a place around that carried this one)."
"Draught @ Connecticut Brewfest: This one pours an opaque brown color, with a little bit of head. The nose was fairly weak on this one. Some roastiness to the nose, but not much else. The taste was a hint of sweet malts, with roastiness and a hint of chocolate. Good, but a very unexciting beer."
"Picked this up on a whim. Growler. Did not realize it was a B&T. Kind of liked the name. It poured dark, dark brown in color with a stubborn head. There was also an incredible amount of lace. The glass was pretty much coated. The aroma was burnt malts, kind of like putting my nose into a wood fire. The flavor is kind of wierd. It has the mellow malts of a pale ale, but the bold and rich flavors of a porter. Dark chocolate, smokey malts, toffee, vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel was very full, chalky and cloying. Just takes over the palate. Still very easy to drink and I wished I was closer to the brewery."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a frothy 1/2"" tan head above the barely translucent dark caramel-hued brew. Head hangs on at 1/4", with nice lacing. Aroma is creamy dark malts. The taste is upfront dark malts, coupled with the lighter body character of the ""tan"" portion of the brew. Closes with an almost slight citrus crisp hops bite. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great, an obvious result of the creaminess of the overall package. Nice one here."
"A fine tasting beer seems a bit confused as to what it is. A little too heavy for what it is."
"A pretty good offering from Olde Burnside even though it takes the fun out of making a Black & Tan yourself."
"i had a bowl of cherry vanillia ice cream taht went very well with this. i was surprised becuase i dont even normally like beer with ice cream, even an appropriately matched beer. but for some reason this went really well, very enjoyable and somethgn i will surely try again."
"Root beer colored with a light brown/beige foamy head that rises up to a thick half-inch that longers long, and leaves spotty lace down the sides of the glass as I drink. The aroma is a rich, roasted malt. Mouthfeel is just a bit watery, not overly carbonated, but enjoyable. Flavor is a little smokey upfront, perhaps a bit chalky, with dark malts swirling in with brown sugar and dark chocolate. An understated hoppy undercurrent flows beneath and lingers a bit in the aftertaste. Yeast flavors seem under control on this one, and a pint is able to be poured without it foaming over. If this is truly the next incarnation of the Tartan Ale, it's a vast improvement."
