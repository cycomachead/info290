3.16,-15.7,2,3.5,3,3,3.5,"I'm sure I'm not the first to point this out, but bottled black and tans don't make any sense. The whole point is to float a light bodied pale beer on top of a heavy bodied dark beer. It's a bartender's trick. Whatever, I'll drink it anyway. Not a very good looking beer. Opaque brown almost grayish like cocolate milk. Thick creamy tan head. Good head retention. Smell is bready dry yeasty along with a little sweet floral fruity herbal hops. Not bad. Drinks pretty good. A little toasted sweet burnt malts up front that lightens up with some fruity rasin flavors in the finsh. A little bitter hoppy aftertaste. Nothing too exciting. It's alright beer. I have had much worse. It seems like a stupid marketing gimmick though. Why not put beer in a bottle of bourbon and sell ready-made boilermakers why they are at it.","lester619","Oct 22, 2004"
4.23,12.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I tried a bottle and was pleasantly surprised. It poured a reddish, copper color with a medium head. Found it very well-balance and flavorful. Tasted rich, nutty, malty, and was both sweet and bitter. Reminded me of a Scottish ale or porter. Would buy it again.","CherylM","Jun 10, 2004"
4.35,16,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall a pretty great beer. I wouldn't say it actually tastes like a black and tan, but I wouldn't hold it against it. Tastes more like Newcastle with an amber infusion. Good stuff!","swamiswamu","Jun 04, 2004"
2.68,-28.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Clear, brownish-amber in hue, it is a lovely color, quite shinny too. The head was beige in color, quite foamy, at the apex the head reached two fingers in height. The retention was decent; it rapidly faded to a foamy residue that lasted the entire consumption. The subsequent lacing was basically none. The nose has its moments; the potency really isnt that loud. It took some hard sniffs to really get what the bouquet was saying. I could detect some coffee notes, light chocolate hints, caramel dashes, and roast. I assume the roast create the astringent notes I smell. There is an odd metal undercurrent but I can get past it. The smells are decent. Im not sold yet? I must admit bottled Black & Tans are lame and not a style. The taste of Grays doesnt do much to persuade me to say otherwise. In a word the palate is good. Nothing great and far from noteworthy, the maltiness is very modest and kind of weak, if not overly slick. There is nothing to sink my teeth into, the roasty flavors are small, and so are the coffee and chocolate. These are really the only flavors of significance. This beer falls apart at the finish, in a major way. It becomes slippery with a lager-like cleanliness and some distant hops that try to add a grassy flavor. It is not working. The fact the mouthfeel is so damn watery and the carbonation is so damn low only hurts the palate. Light in body. I cant say this beer is offensive, I can say it is bland and thus pointless to drink. Enough said. I purchased one bottle in Iowa City for $1.30. That is enough for me.","bditty187","Nov 08, 2003"

3.7,-1.3,3,3,4,4,4,"Pours very dark, but has a hint of redness to it, when held to a light. Heavy malt presence in both the aroma and taste. This beer starts heavy on the tongue, but finishes with a smooth follow through. Not bitter at all. A very nice after dinner beer.","BobLuvBeer","0"
