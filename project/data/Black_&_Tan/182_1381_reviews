"Pours a nicely dark almost coke like color with a tan finger and a half almost two head.smells of chocolate and traditional lager behind it. Taste of chocolate and Maybe a little bit of coffee with the flavor of the traditional lager in the back ground very ever so slightly creamy and goes down smooth and very refreshing for a dark beer compared to most I've had not quite a craft beer but not just your normal either definitely recommend it to someone who wants to get into craft beers excellent place to start"
"Pours a dark brown color. Holding it to the light it appears burnt red in color. Very little head, minimal lacing. Aroma is roasted malts some cocoa and coffee, but a main wiff of corn resides.  Tatse follows the nose, slightly more pleasant than the smell. Mouthfeel is light, somewhat watery but overall not bad. I would just rather thier porter. For black and tans i just make my own. its not bad for the price, but it is what it is."

"Pours dark brown little creamy tan head, smells roasty with crisp crackery malts, tastes of malts slight sunflower seed, smooth lasting finish. Decent beer for less than a dollar a bottle."
""
"A nice dark nearly black color. it is an entirely enjoyable beer considering the price.. I got a dozen of the the 16 ounce cans for one dollar each the other day.. No, not the best ever but I enjoyed them. Not a top of the line brew but you know that when you purchase them..."

"Grainy and burnt flavors from the porter mix with the base Yuengling that just doesn't hold up to the porter flavors. A bit metallic with some cocoa, drinkable, but not the easiest to get through."
"My go to cheap easy drinking beer."
""
"Easy drinking. Smooth finish. Good price"
""
"I like the darker beer and this was great. Strong beer flavor. It wasn't that heavy either."
""
"There is nothing really special about this one. the lager is so much better."
"O - Not a favorite.  Too light for a good porter."
"My go to. Good all around decent flavors, drinks like a porter. Heck @ $4.99 six pack! Bring them on! Nice & kool!"
""
"Liked this as a nice cheap every-day type beer as I always enjoyed black and tans.  Then made the mistake of drinking one after having some very good IPA's.  It's exactly what the ratings give it, an ok alternative to a black n tan draft."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice change from the typical yuengling beer. I would have it again."
""
""
"Not an easy drinker or exciting flavor profile."
""
"this is really a go to beer for me when I need a break from hi octane craft brews. It's not the greatest beer in the world, however, for an everyday affordable beer this is definitely one of my favorites."
""
""
""
"Blah... What a waste, if you want a good black and tan... Just make one."

"Glass- SA Perfect Pint Glass"
""
""
"Overall:  This is a decent beer, possessing some nice roasted malt flavors, mingled with some semi-sweet and semi-sour (due I guess to corn adjuncts).  It’s pleasant, but very forgettable.  I’d much rather have a traditional Black & Tan (half and half of Guinness and Newcastle) or a Yuengling Porter or Oktoberfest over this beer, but I wouldn’t turn it down if offered."
""
"Smooth and flavorful. Has nice sweet tones. Not bitter at all."
""
""
"I've had this a couple of times. Never did really like it."
""
""
"I like this beer except for that sweetness in the middle. Price makes this a high value beer and the low alcohol content (4.7 on this site) is a bonus for me."
""
""
""
"I love this beer in cans only."
""
""
""
""
"12/14...pours dark brown, light reflects a deep red. Fast fizz, little foam. Small roasted nose, lighter malt. Taste is a lighter dark malt that fades fast and finishes like a lager. Kind of exactly what I expected."
"Not bad for a pre-mixed black and tan beer. Dark with a slight bitterness."
"Overall, I'd say that I liked the ""black"" half of this beer but am unsure that the ""tan"" really added much to the mixture.  I haven't had Yuengling Porter and Yeungling Premium Beer individually (stores around here only seem to carry their Traditional Lager, Black & Tan, and Light Lager) so I can't really compare the Black & Tan to each of its component parts just yet, but I'm assuming I--and anyone else who likes those chocolatey ""darker beer"" flavors--would probably prefer the Porter over this one."
"O: Good flavor and a great lightness and crisp taste. Great for the summer months if you want a darker beer. Cheap as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer.  Real similar to the traditional lager so if you like that then you will probably like this.  Gives a little something different from the traditional however it is ever so slight."

"Well the black and tan was what it was."
""
"I was disappointed with this one a little, I was expecting a little bitter more from my first beer from a brewery with such a long history but this one failed to deliver; hopefully if I ever get to try their Dark Brewed Porter or their Premium lager individually they will come out better than this combination of the two did. The beer was too basic for my liking and the porter part seemed to dominate but when the lager did making an appearance it wasn't welcome and seemed to negatively impact the taste; this one isn't a beer I'd be eager to try again but I wouldn't mind get my hands on some of the brewery's other beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Worth a try, although I could pick 50 different products I would rather have than this if I were to take a trip to PA and bring back beer. Hell just standard Yuengling is better, although I think this is rated a bit low on this site. At least I got to watch the Chiefs take it to the Pats whilst drinking this brew."

"Poured from a bottle into a glass. Much darker than I thought. Had been drinking right from the bottle so I didn't realize this. Malty sweet aroma. Ok taste. Not much there. Kind of reminds me of a porter I made. Easy drinking, but not much to it."
"Serving type: bottle."

"Meh. It's drinkable, though it's not a spectacular beer."

"Not as flavorful as Yuengling Traditional, which I prefer. Nice color, nice head. The phrase ""drinkable"" comes to mind, though cliche, in the sense that this stuff actually has some flavor, isn't too light, and isn't too bready. In the area of being good but not great, it's even more Yuengling than Yuengling Traditional."
"full of sodium, skunky, and lack of any true porter character"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I drink this one a bunch combo of their porter and their premium, which is a misnomer because it's their low end beer, mixes well however,typical black and tan,that mixes a dark with a adjunct."
""
""
"Meh. Appearance is a dark brown with very little in the way of carbonation. The smell was very subtle although I did get some toast. The taste was mellow with very little in the way of noticeable flavors, mostly just a little bit of toasted malt. The mouthfeel was also way too thin for the style for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"I drank this one time and that night my body was sore. I had aches on my muscles, it was the strangest thing. It felt like I worked out and my body was exhausted. That can't be good since I've never gotten that feeling from any other beer."

"Overall: An average to slightly below average black and tan. Since Yuengling has been reintroduced to Massachusetts, I have been thinking there beers have been better than I remember them being. That is not the case unfortunately with this one. It is not a bad beer, but just one that does not stick out. I would not turn it down if it was offered to me, but would not pick it up either."

"O- a very enjoyable beer that tastes like yuenglings flagship beer mixed with a porter"
""
""
""
""
"The dark half of the beer actually seems to open up a bit with warming but never overcomes the feeling of being watered down with neutral lager. The final product is decent but nothing I would have again with better Black and Tans being made locally."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a burnt amber color, a tan head. The head is dissipating rapidly... and now it's gone. Smell is fruity, almost like raspberries.Taste is slightly smokey and a little roast, and malt. Just a hint of caramel, thank god that fruity smell has worn off, but I do pick it up a little in the taste. Mouthfeel a thin and fizzy."
""
""
""
""
"Picked up some Yuengling Black and Tan since it's new to Massachusetts. I've had their flagship beer before and it was ok. Was not very impressed with this. Poured well but had a very light smell. Upon drinking, I began to wonder if I had come down with a cold because I didn't taste much. It's very light-bodied with only hints of hops and the roasted flavor I would expect. Didn't taste any of the caramel the label promised. Over all, not an awful beer but definitely not a great beer either."

"Yuengling Original Black and Tan. For starters it's very good. Let me tell you what. If you do not like we'll there's nothing I can do. So enjoy that shit. It's not heavy to heavy per say. This beer is smooth. Bottles never cans and always Draft if u you can."

"Yuengling Black & Tan brewed by Yuengling. This brew pours out a dark brown almost like black coffee. Also has a light brown head on top. The smell is rich with flavor. There is nothing bad about the smell of this brew. The taste of this brew is good nothing bad real smooth. There is a lot of flavor to brew but it is not over powering. Clean smooth finish nothing bad at all. I'm not really a big fan of dark beers but this one I like. I'm more of American style Lager kind of person but this porter is just right."

"anyway,Yuengling B&T is a Good Beer,Not Great Mind you,But Good,and also priced right,$6.29 a 6er,that is a Deal and a Half for a smooth easy drinking Black and Tan,it won't fill you up or bloat you,it has enough flavor without slapping you across the face with it,it is mellow and highly drinkable,also a nice change of pace for those backyard BBQ's and cookouts,when all the yuppies are drinking coors light or Bud Light,you can have your own cooler of B&T and laugh @ those silly mineral water sipping twats..mwahuhuhuhu! cheers and peace2all;)"

"This is probably one of my favorite black & tan's that has crossed my palate. I look for Yuengling in the places I can find it and typically look for this style. Smooth for a dark beer with the elements of dark malts and bitter hops. There is also a pleasant aftertaste which aids in the enjoyment of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I remember when I used to think highly of Yuengling's Black & Tan. Now, I simply question my judgement as a younger beer drinker - among other things... While it pours thick and presentable, it drinks thin and forgettable. With little to no hops and a lack of roasted flavors, it tastes comparable to a straight forward, low ABV, watered down, and don't forget flat, Lager. The hints of caramel and coffee mentioned on the label, well those ingredients didn't make it into the batch I received. Long story short, don't drink a traditional layered beer from a 12oz bottle. It will always end in disappointment."

"The bottle pours out the blackest of black liquid I have ever seen - very nice in my opinion. It's aroma is a nice mixture of hops and caramel, where I do taste a good amount of bitterness (nothing bad mind you) but unfortunately, no caramel. It's highly carbonated, but swishes around good. Overall, it's rich, it's bold, and definitely refreshing at the beach. I'm glad I still have a few to go through in the fridge."
""
"O - Would be a great gateway beer for someone looking for something a little darker than your average BCM product. Nice warm weather dark. Thin enough to quench, but with a little extra flavor. The price point on this is ridiculously low. I'm always impressed when a cheap beer sticks out from crowd, even if its still one dimensional. Solid brew, if you keep some perspective of what its meant to be... a nonoffensive dark for the populace."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is probably an intermediate step into darker more full-bodied dark beers. I find it very affordable and extremely drinkable when I'm in the mood for a beer of this type. I have found it this week for just under $20. Never has good flavor been this affordable."

"Yuengling has pulled through yet again! First off, drink this beer out of a glass rather than a can or bottle. The pour is great. The beer is darker than I had expected and holds a nice head after pouring. This beer smells similar to the Yuengling lager, but with a hint of roasted malt. The taste is very similar to the Yuengling Porter only milder. I enjoy the Porter's flavor but it is too strong for my preferences. The Black & Tan is more mellow while still having that roasted malt taste. The mouthfeel is slightly heavier than the Yuengling lager but is still very drinkable. Overall I give this beer slightly under a 4. For $22 bucks a case it's a great beer. Good micro-brew type flavor at a very reasonable price."
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours brown with short lived, beige head. Nose is of bready malt, ripe fruit and lemonade. Body is medium, smooth and astringent. Taste is of toasted malt, chalk, metallic, very astringent. Finish is long and astringent. At least I did not buy this crap."
""
""
"Got a sixer cause I thought it was time to give it a try. Won't do that again. Expected a little more from Yuengling. Drank from a bottle so not gonna comment on appearance. The taste was a little bland. Thought there would be more complexity. Finish was ok, about the only part of it that I enjoyed. Got less than I paid for."

"Overall - so-so, about on par with Yuengling offerings."

"Taste is surprising dry and crisp. You get some relaxed sweet notes but mostly on the dry bitter side of things. The feel is light and very easy to drink. One could put down several of these and still function. This beer sits right in the middle of bad and good. I haven't had the porter by its self, however I have had their lager and it is much better then this mix."
""
"12 pack for $10 where I shop. Best beer I have found at that price! Shouldn't be compared to craft beers. Provides a beer with substance for people who can't afford more than a dollar beer. Thanks Yuengling! For Christmas I'll get Bell's, Founders, Anchor,...."

"A decent beer pretty sort of sour. That is the only thing I really don't like about it. The Yuengling porter on it's own is good, so maybe it's the premium beer that gives it the sour taste. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind. A nice beer to grab if you want something cheap and dark, and cheap dark beer is hard to come by so this automatically gets a go-to badge.

""
""
""
"Would I buy this again? Yes and no. I don't hate it or even dislike it, but I'm not impressed by it. For a mass-produced beer aimed at being somewhat fancy or craft-beer-like, it serves its purpose. I do not feel, however, that this beer is worth paying nearly fifteen bucks for a twelve pack."

"This pours a ruby amber color with cocoa colored foam. The aroma has a malty caramel tinge to it. There’s a malty flavor to it on the sweeter side which makes it an easy drinker. It’s perfectly acceptable."
"I have only enjoyed it in a bottle , but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had a pleasant aroma upon opening but a less than average head when poured into a pint glass . I liked the flavor enough though it lacked a bit of body . I realize that Yuengling may not be as bold in flavor as some of the other beers here , but as far as middle of the road brews go , I think it does quite well. It is smooth and palatable without being overpowering , so i can enjoy it with a meal without being bloated."

"Pours dark brown with a redish tinge. It has a tan head lasts about 30 seconds with poor lacing. Very light aromas of chocolate with a bit of a vegetative quality. Heavy carbonation with a light mouthfeel. The flavors are even lighter than the smell with a slightly bitter finish. In my opinion, it's a lighter beer than it lets on. It's a good middle of the road, easy drinking, easy-to-get beer."

"for the price there isnt a better black and tan going. the 16oz cans are nice too. the pours a really dark, just like the porter, a little less thick, but equally dark, hersheys brown with a small off white head lastign just seconds. smells chocolatey, i think much more porter in this blend than 50/50, at least thats what the nose tells me, with all that dark roasty malt. the flavor is also favoring porter, but its lighter in feel, and there is a paler malt profile the the look or the smell give away. a little dark cocoa, a little burnt toast, there is a slightly bitter finish on it. smooth feel, maybe a touch heavy on the carbonation, but the body is medium as it should be, and its easy to put a few of these away, especially in the fall. far far superior to the regular yuengling lager."

"So this is another one of those beers that is a ""get what you pay for"" kind of thing. Not a craft beer, but better than a Bud or Bud-type product. I like this one the best of all the Yuengling flavors I have tasted so far. This is a good go-to beer for parties, bargain hunters, or people that may be upgrading from Bud Light."

"This brew poured with a seriously thick tan head, about two fingers worth, that dissipated slowly and left lots of lacing on the glass. The body was a dark brown with no visible carbonation due to the color. The nose presented with mostly roasted malts, grain and then a hint of coffee. Smelled good to me. The beginning of the sip hit me with mild coffee up front and then roasted malts came through. Some sweetness and bread also came through on the subsequent sips. The sweetness mostly manifested as brown sugar, but was altogether mild. The body was a medium thickness with middle of the road carbonation. The finish was relatively long with the roasted malts apparent in the taste. It was an easy drinker with some flavor that I wouldn’t mind having again. I think the style is generally towards the boring side, but this one was probably the best of the style that I’ve had. Add to the fact that this beer tends to be cheap…worth a sip."

"Overall - It has a promising scent but doesn't really deliver taste wise. It smells like a porter, but basically tastes like a lager. Still an easy drinking and non offensive brew."

"Overall a decent average beer. If I were drinking it from a tap where I didn't know what I was getting, I would get excited by the color, then disappointed from there on out. Price/availability is a semi redeeming quality. Where it's plentiful, it's a safe choice. Where Yuengling is a rarity, I would probably stick to regular and let the novelty guide my tastebuds."

" O- Overall this beer is one of my favorites and always will be. The look and the taste is what makes me really love this beer and its definitely a plus that its brewed by the Oldest Brewery in America. Definitely my second favorite next to Guinness Extra Stout."
"O: Not a great Black & Tan, considering the parts that went into making it; Yuengling's pale lager and sub-par porter. I see this as a novelty beer and would almost want to drink either their straight porter or simply the amber lager."
""
""
""
""
"Yeah, this is especially boring, especially for a dark beer. It takes no risks and tastes a little mass produced. The appearance is average, nice color and an ok head. Smells like an average, not bold, dark lager. Taste is watered down. A little malty and a little citrusy, and a little hoppy. Everything about the taste is just not bold. Too carbonated, and not very creamy. This beer needs help. It's not terrible, but I expected more. It's not even as good as a normal Yuengling which is also not bold, and a little boring. Oh well."
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is not a bad beer. I definitely rate it above average and have no problem drinking more of these in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked it. For the price it is amazing. I prefer Yuengling's Lager though. I would also choose Michelob Amberbock over this for the factt hat it is so similar but this has a bit less bite, and if Im getting this kind of beer I want more than just a slightly roasted lager. But overal a good beer that I will have again."

"This is an easy barstool beer that could make up a session while watching football and eating wings."

"Pours a deep brown with a black appearance. Short and bubbly light tan colored head with weak retention. Cream, milk chocolate, roasted malt, rye spices and roasted coffee on the aroma. First sip is a moderately carbonated heavy cream flavor with light notes of milk chocolate, brown sugar and rye bread. Turns into a flat, roasted nut flavor with an even flatter aftertaste. Oddly light body, awkward overall flavor. Yuengling lager is so delicious i was definitely expecting greatness with this black & tan, sad to say i didn't get it."

"O: Ok. Cheap, so it gets the job done. Not stellar. Stick with Yuengling Lager if you're going to buy Yuengling."

"Overall, this beer is not very good at all, but I used to buy and drink a lot of this stuff because for the price the case of pounders is a good deal. It is pretty ho-hum though and not much better than any macro lager. There is just a touch more flavor than standard macro beers. Being a Pennsylvanian, and given that people around here really appreciate Yuengers, I still have a place in my heart for Yuengling."

"Review from notes. Pours a dark cola like color into pint glass with a small quarter inch tan head on it. Smell is a mix of stale lager and dull malt and taste wise much of the same. Kinda what I expected it tastes like a literal mix of their lager and porter combined and frankly I'd reach for either of those before another sixer of this overall it's average and finishes clean and the price is right as always for Yuengling product. Honestly, black and tan's are best made and served by the drinker, a brewed version that combines the 2 perfectly I have yet to encounter. It's a balance that is best left to the drinker, much like adding salt or pepper to a dish everyone's palate is a little different. I'll stick to their porter."

"Overall, nothing to see here, move on, you have better luck mixing your own, and having more fun. At least it would LOOK like a black and tan, but this just comes off as a real dumbed down porter."
""

"Overall: I'm usually a fan of darker beers but this one was a little off. The aftertaste was bitter and unpleasant. Not as smooth as their lager."

"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is definitely has drinkability on its side. The body allows this beer to be drank in big swigs and never becomes coating or sticky. The carbonation is not immediately noticeable but is undoubtedly doing a lot of work in the background."

"O - Of what is available currently in Ohio this is easily the brewery's best. That said, this has no real bearing on the score of any particular beer's review. There are few commercial examples to compare this to, but the best I have yet had isn't even in the same league as this beer (that is to say that this beer is not enough to consider Yuengling as a craft brewery) - and that beer is Hoppin' Frog's Black and Tan. Then again, how many beers of any style can compete with something that is half BORIS the Crusher?"
""
"Pretty basic offering from Americas oldest brewery"
""
""
"12 oz bottle pours a rootbeer color with inadequate head and lacing. Yes, it has an aroma, light roasted malts, a little bacon perhaps. Taste is american light beer with a smidgeon of roasted dark malts and coffee. Very thin mouthfeel, without much finish. Better than BMC, but essentially a variant of American mega-lager swill."

"12 ounce bottle, bought as part of a mixed 6 pack at a local Kroger. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear ruby red/brown color (when held up to the light) with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is sweet and malty, the brew smells like sweet, roasted and caramel malt, and a bit of coffee. The brew tastes like coffee, chocolate and caramel malt, and a little bit of toffee. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with good carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. For what it is, it's a decent enough brew. Yuengling says this is a mix of their Porter and Premium beer. It's worth trying, and I might buy this occasionally in the future."
"O- A black and tan that is mixed and bottled is a far cry from one poured fresh from a tap. Its easy to drink"
""
""
"Overall - It's not bad. It's a pretty crisp and refreshing beer and one of the better ones in the Yuengling lineup. It's not a great beer by any stretch of the imagination, but unoffensive and decent."

"I was quite surprised with this beer. I did not expect much, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. First time was out of a bottle the other night, the head was foamy, the beer was smooth, it actually had a very good flavor to it. Quite dark in appearance (as the name implies) but taste is not overbearing. I was definitely sold."

"Only reason that most people from NEPA enjoy this one is because it was a beer everyone grew up/were raised on, living 40 miles from Yuengling Brewery in the PA Coal region I know this first hand."
"Overall, a good beer for the price, something worth keeping in the fridge."
"Overall, I'd say I wish we could get this at liquor stores here...might be a good alternative to darker ales like Newcastle to switch things up a bit."
"D: This is one of my favorite sessionable beers that is easy to put down and overall pretty tasty for what it is and the price. Of course, we can't get it here in Mississippi, but it's something that I enjoy anytime I'm back on the east coast or family comes to visit. Wonderful beer for the weekend."
"o - a decent beer, especially considering the price. much better than other black and tan blends i have had. if they distributed this in michigan, i'd have a new session beer."
"A decent black and tan, but not one that I would go out looking for."
"Pours a dark brown, with ruby edges. Fine, tan head. Faint scent of hops and malts. Taste is acrid and nutty. Lager has some bite, carbonation-wise. Not much taste. Acrid finish. Drinkability was not that high.."
"O: Nothing wrong with this beer, aside from the closed aroma. AN easy drinking black and tan. While not my favorite style, this is one that I could drink easy enough, especially from the can at some sort of BBQ or tailgate."
"$7.00 for a 6-pack = win. (Keep in mind, the average craft beer where I live is $9-$10 a sixer)"
"O: This is a decent beer for the price. Not one that I would openly drink everyday but worth it occasionally."
"overall: pretty good beer, I wasn't overly impressed with it but it is definitely drinkable. Not too bitter, not to sweet which I like. It just didn't wow me. Given options this wouldn't be the first beer I'd buy but I definitely wouldn't say no if it was offered."
"Pours a dark brown with 1/4"" inch of soft, foamy brownish head. The smell has notes of roasted malts and faint coffee. The taste is roasted malts, faint coffee, and faint chocolate. There's a faint, bitter hoppiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little highly carbonated, and at times a little thin."
"M- Very creamy and properly carbonated for the style. Surmounted my expectations."
"I find this beer to be very enjoyable - the quality is comparable to the price. It is certainly not the best beer I’ve had in this style, but it is a good beer nonetheless. Great for parties on a budget; plus at 4.7% ABV, nobody should end up too blitzed."
"O- I drink several of these at a time not something terribly complex but my choice when it comes to macros"
"Pours an oil slick black, with an inch of creamy deep tan head. Reasonable lacing. Aroma is yeasty, with some nuts and malty notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Taste is yeasty, malty, somewhat nutty, a hint of coffee, and fairly metallic tasting. This is certainly nothing special, but it is a good, cheap brew that I could sip all day with some friends."
"Overall: A stepping stone to the really burly black and tans. Smooth and sessionable alone or with burgers or BBQ. Perhaps a chocolate chip cookie. A very cool beer surprise."
"Decent drinkability on this one (I like it far more than their flagship lager). Some complexity, but still fairly simple. OK beer."
"Tasting the beer I was slightly disappointed. Up front you have caramel and roasted malt. In the middle some brown sugar and at the end maybe those hops. Overall the taste was weak and flat. Not much complexity, but drinkable."
"Purchased a six pack over this past weekend. Poured into a glass, brew has a deep black color with a little lacing and a smooth taste that was somewhat bitter. Taste had hints of chocolate, toffee and coffee. Not a bad beer overall just not my style. Probably a better beer for winter time with soups or stews not a summer time brew."
"The best beer choice in a dive bar in Alfred NY, this one called to me. Pours a solid reddish brown with a thinnish tan head. Smells of toffee and slight earthy hops. Smells like someone mixed Guinness with Michelob. Earthy toffee taste slight darker grainy taste. Faint hints of chocolate are a nice surprise while the metallic off taste isn't. Spirited carbonation with a medium thinnish body, watery chalky mouthfeel. I could drink this if I had to, but wouldn't seek this out."
"RJT"
"O-a decent everyday drinking beer at a great price"
"I'm unbiased, this is a great beer. I will be drinking this again."
"Overall this isn't great, but it's certainly not as bad as a lot of its price range."
"O: The beer goes down very smoothly and is easy to drink because of its light body and low alcohol content."
"overall; ehhh, not disgusting but pretty lousy. Try it when offered but don't spend money on it. I remember having this on tap and it was a little better."
"O (D) - this is kinda bad. must be old."
"Not sure what i expected with this but it is really not very good... Pours a fairly pretty dark brown with a good amount of tan head. Looks acceptable but not stellar. Smells weird... Roasted coffee and some light dark malts with atouch of hops. Overall not that good on the nose or the tongue. Off flavours prevail eith some strange aftertaste. The beer itlf isn't horrible but lacks anything to s it apart overall not something i wold seek out again"
"it poured a stout like color beer with a brownish foaming head. It smelled of slight chocolate with smoke notes. I tasted some banana aromas and bitter chocolate with a bit of fruitiness in the finish. remind me of guiness extra stout which is a average beer."
"overall, a good bargain beer. while I prefer it to the Traditional Lager, the plain Porter is better."
"O: As far as pre-mixed black and tans go, it exceeded my expectations"
"Overall - A beer I often choose when looking to not spend much money on booze. The flavor is satisfying and at almost every bar in Maryland. It has that dark beer taste but with the refreshing end of an Ale. A good drink for relaxing with in the early summer months. I have gotten many times and will get it many times again."
"O: Not the most drinkable. This doesn't do much of anything for me."
"I would drink this again if offered one."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer with some nice light flavor. A good introduction to the style."
"This beer is brown to light black with some garnet hues throughout. It had three fingers of beige head with no retention and a few wisps of sticky lacing. The smell is any thing but impressive, harsh and chemical like, smelled a little of bile. Had some coffee, cocoa, and smoky molasses flavors but they feel thin and watery. The mouthfeel is thin and forgetful. Overall this beer is just not unremarkable. It's artificial sweetness bookended by flavorless swill."
"Overall better than I expected. It's not particularly strong or hoppy but it's a nice smooth, crisp black and tan."
"Drink - A touch bitter to start. Decent carbonation."
"I'd had one at room temp before I think had more scent and flavor, but this was no less than 50 degrees so it shouldn't be that hidden..."
"O: I was surprised how drinkable this beer was, and by that I mean how much I want to drink it. I was skeptical before I tried this one as I usually only like black and tan that I create, but for what this was, it was a simple no frills mixture that was a pleasure to drink. Thanks again Woody for hooking it up!"
"pours a dark, dark brown with ruby highlights and a two finger head that was tan and fluffy. smells of roasted sweet malts, light bitter coffee and slight chocolate. tasted like roasted malts and coffee with slight chocolate and vanilla. mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. overall not the best black n tan, but not the worst either. i would drink it again."
"Brought in a chilled, not frosted mug. Head was almost two fingers of soft, white foam, which left little lace. Color matched a 30 on my pocket SRM beer color chart. Smell was that of roasted coffee, roasted wheat, molasses, sweet corn and malt. The taste was a little less harsh, but still had the flavors of rich black coffee, burnt wheat, molasses, coco, corn, and malt. Mouthfeel was bold, but lacking in body and smoothness. Seems to be missing a good amount of carbonation. Not one of my favorite tasting beer, but it is a good change from the BMC that most offer on tap."
"Overall this beer is OK, and I'm glad to have tried it from such a classic brewery that I can't get out here on the west coast. That being said, I would take a Guinness black and tan over this one any day."
"This beer pours a very dark brown with amber highlights. It smells like a flat porter or dry stout. It has a light roast aspect, slight bitterness, and subtle malty sweetness. It's pretty standard. The taste isn't too shabby though. It's like a like porter and easy to drink. It has the light roast and malt combining to give it enough flavor. The light coffee and malty sweetness do their part. It is a little light in body for the style but it's actually pretty smooth. It actually went really well with my grouper. It's an ok Black and Tan, but pretty good considering it's probably the cheapest one around in a six pack. Not too shabby..."
"O - This has decent drinkability. The flavor is alright and it goes down easy. This is the first beer of this style that I've had, and I thought it was alright. I would try this one again, but I wouldn't Pay for it."
"I hated the Black & Tan the first time I had it. I thought it was horrible on every level. I'm not sure what made me try it again but it was surprisingly much better the second time around. The pour of this beer is a deep brown, nearly black with a tan head. The aromas are a mix of hops and burnt charcoal. The taste is very toasted. Toasted heavily to say the least. The mouthfeel is bitey and carbonated. Pretty good stuff."
"Frothy tan one inch head, amber brown body with ruby highlights. Roasted malt aroma. Lightly bitter taste, not as much taste as expected, almost like a light lager. Mouthfeel was watery, lightly fizzy. Nothing offensive, but nothing outstanding either."
"12oz bottle. Pours a super dark brown, almost black color with ruby hues and a half inch of head. Minimal lacing. Aroma of grains, some coffee, and a bit of chocolate. Taste is malty. Lots of roasted malt flavor along with hints of chocolate and a very small amount of coffee. It is a good attempt at putting a black and tan in 1 bottle, but obviously doesn't quite deliver. Easy to drink and has a decent amount of flavor. Overall there isn't many Black and Tans beers out there and this one is worth grabbing."
"Overall, I'd rather just drink Yuengling Porter and leave this one of the shelf."
"Notes: Overall its easy to drink with no off flavors but a little boring and very average."
"O- this is a little less than average IMO. The metallic taste kind of puts this off for me. Would not have this again as a choice unless everything else was somehow worse. Would seek out in a dive bar I guess you could say."
"Personally, I think I will just stick with the base beers. Mixing them together creates somewhat of a dissonance that I did not enjoy."
"Notes: Yuengling makes good use of its less stellar, Premium brew, as the tan, matched up with their, better than decent, Porter (actually a lager). I really enjoy this on-tap (in some respects it reminds me of Sierra Nevada Stout), and I have no complaints about it being poured into a glass from a tall boy can (pint)."
"This would be a good beer to try if you have been intimidated by dark beers."
"D: A very drinkable beer, just not anything special. A good representation of the style, being that it is about halfway between a light beer and a dark beer, but it just doesn't have much flavor."
"Kind of an earthy musty smell. It neither entralls me nor does it repulse me. It's kind of ""ho hum"". Taste like a watered down porter. Faint hints of coffee, chocolate, and caramel. Mouthfeel is crisp but a bit too thin. It's drinkable. Something to go after if you are looking for a lighter bodied dark beer."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a thin, brown head. Smells of coffee beans and roasted malts. Tastes a bit bitter at first, but finishes with a sweet caramel flavor. Very smooth mouthfeel. Medium body and little carbonation. Not exceptional, but a refreshing beer."
"I remember the taste being more delicious in the past. I'm thinking if I reviewed this when I first started rating beers, it would have a much higher rating. My palate has changed quite a bit."
"A dark amber color with a finger-width head that fades slowly. There is a bit of hops in the smell as well as roasted malt. In a way, the beer starts like a lager and finishes like a porter. Hops can be tasted but are mostly in the background. A toasty finish suggests the source of the dark part of the beer. Some corn is noted as well. In the mouthfeel, carbonation is present but not overwhelming and medium bodied overall."
"Dark mahogany color with thick, creamy tan head. Lots of carbonation, good head retention. Malty, corny aroma, grainy with a bit of caramel. Some roasted malt. Taste is much smoother, more roasted malt and caramel but still a lingering grainy/corny characteristic. Light to medium body, crisp and smooth mouthfeel."
"This is ok. I haven't had a black and tan in a long time... This one will hold me over for another few years. The flavor isn't awful-- but it certainly isn't something I want to drink."
"An astoundingly good dark beer for the price: 10 bucks for a 12-pack at Wegmans in State College, PA. I found my new standard. It brings some of the unique flavors found in Yuengling porter to a slightly lighter beer, but make no mistake; the stuff is not weak. It might not be the most delicious beer on the planet, but the combination of good flavor and low price are unbeatable for me as a beer-enthusiast college student (not a drunkard!) Everyone else has described the taste well enough. My review is mainly economic."
"D: Could drink this one quite awhile on a cold winter night. Very drinkable (& affordable)."
"The drink-ability is good as far as I'm concerned. For the cost I think it's a fairly balanced black and tan. Not too heavy and doesn't leave a very strong aftertaste. Definitely something to enjoy in warm or cold weather."
"D- This beer was a nice drinking beer overall. The ABV was low enough that you could drink these all night. The overall aroma and flavor is muted but average at best."
"Now when i have 6 bucks to my name this beer comes first, much rather have this over anything i can get for the price i can get this at. not a bad buy, but def not the best."
"UNDRINKABLE!!!"
"D- Better than average drinkablity make this one a session beer and a great keg beer for a BBQ. Cheers!"
"D: A good darker beer without being huge like a RIS or even a robust porter. This might be a good intro to darker/roastier beers for someone who likes brown ales but is afraid of a porter or stout. Not bad, not great, can't believe I never tried this when I lived in FL."
"Drinkability: Well the drinkability is very good seeing how thins this beer is. Would be good on a hot summer day and very refreshing. The carbonation and slight astringency I got I found a little offsetting but overall not a bad beer. So many better out there though."
"D- This is what it is, it's a great beer to provide or serve to a large group of people, as it can appeal to a wide range of tastes, but there's nothing too incredibly special about it."
"D-definitely not that most enjoyable beer but i've found that when selections are low, this isn't a bad beer. classic black and tans with guinness and harp/bass are still the way to go"
"Black and tan pours out mostly black looking, Resembling a cola look with some dark reds through some light. A fairly minimal head about a half inch up looking light tan and wispy. Nothing on the glass. Smell is a fairly roasted scent with faint vanilla and grain out the wazoo, especially with warming. It taste exactly the same but maybe not in that order. Funny that I dont pick up any chocolate at all, this is not a sweet beer by any stretch of the imagination. Besides the huge grain bill this remains fairly balanced and drinkable and simple. A good local brew for when your in the mood to just DRINK."
"Verdict: Pretty average. Nothing I would get again, but nothing I seriously regret purchasing one bottle of. This is one of the most commonly available Black and Tan beers on the market, so consider this a welcome mat to that style. I wasn't impressed. C (2.9)"
"d - An ok beer but not very good. A below average black and tan; wouldn't seek out again."
"Pours near black with a fairly thick tan head. Head is quite bubbly and leaves some pretty good lacing. The nose is not terribly good. A slight bit of roast and maybe mild chocolate. The flavor is a bit worse than that. Tastes like someone threw a bit of black malt into a regular Yuengling. Feel is light and prickly. Not a terribly good beer and I will say that I was expecting more."
"When i poured this beer into a glass, it had a very dark brown color to it, with not a lot of head to it. The smell is of a little bit of chocolate and not much else but a mix of lager and a porter. The taste is of roasted malts and has a sweet bitterness to it, not much else to say. This one has a decent mouth feel and is not one the best one i have tried but is ok."
"D: Meh, glad to get to try this, but I don't think I would seek it out quite that often. I think I'll continue to blend my own black and tans when I feel like it. Decent."
"Served in regular pint glass. This is dark brown with little light percing the edges. Smallish head and teh retention of the head is weak. Toasted and roasted notes come to mind in the aroma. The taste is closer to a porter than anything else. It reminds me of their lager being mixed with their porter and this is what you get. Body is medium and not much carbonation. It's decent, but nothing I would buy from a store just a good alternative to macros at a bar."
"Overall: Believe it or not this is my first Black and Tan from Yuengling and I've lived in PA my whole life. While nothing earth shattering this isn't terrible beer. Or even bad beer for that matter. It's very drinkable. It has some nice roasted malt flavors and is super approachable for anyone. For the price you can't beat it."
"Thinner medium body, mild carbonation, some sticky dryness. This is pretty much ""eh"" from top to bottom, and the adjunct metallic component really doesn't help. I'm usually a Yuengling fan but this is a no go."
"D- Ok for this style."
"drinkability: very drinkable, great example of the style, bold while not overly intense, could serve to have a slighter abv that would give it a bit more character."
"Pours a dark brownish-red, two-finger tan head. Head dissipates, leaving slight lacing. Aroma is modest, mostly similar to the Porter with faint roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium-thin, carbonation is medium as well. Drinkability is pretty high since I don't find it especially filling or strong. I think that the ""Black and Tan"" style is better made with more flavorful beers and not premixed like this. Another average beer from Yuengling, this one would be a good alternative to a BMC lager for me, but I won't likely buy it often."
"D: Goes down rather easily, mild kick, ok representation of style. This isn't a beer to sit down and really aprreciate but to just kick back and watch the game, I could sit with a few of these."
"I really like Yuengling B&T for the price point. I do taste an English style ale when I drink it, and the stout also seems solid. I order this beer when the ""Big Three"" are otherwise available, and I want to subject myself to more flavor and ridicule. In other words, this beer is sometimes available when more obscure craft brews may not be, so it is nice to have it as an option."
"Overall- Pretty good beer, not my favorite black and tan but isn't too damn shabby for a $5.99 six pack at your local grocery store. Cheers."
"Color is a cola like, dark brown with ruby highlights. Medium, khaki colored head with a soft pour. Not alot of lacing. The nose isn't overly impressive. The pale lager smell comes through the most, followed by a little chocolate malt and roasted barley. Palate is more porter than pale lager. The chocolate and caramel malts is showcased in the front and finishes clean and mild like a lager. Body is fluid and crisp. Decent, drinkable blend at a good price."
"I really like the flagship from this brewery, now time to try a rare style from them. Beer pours a very dark red color. Not much head to it. Faint aroma. Taste is medium bodied, kind of a subdued flavor to it and nothing really 'stands out'. Very smooth and drinkable none the less, but just a bit bland to me. Definitely a beer that's smooth and easy to finish, but I feel it could use a better hop kick to it or at least some more maltiness flavorwise, kind of stuck in the middle. Meh,"
"Overall: Okay beer. I wouldn't turn it down, but I wouldn't seek it out either."
"Drinkability: I would drink it if given or no other more interesting choices were available. Not really one I would go searching for. Not bad, but not good enough to choose when others are available."
"D: Yes, but I don't particularly want to drink more of it."
"Taste is better than the aroma. Starts with a hit of bittersweet chocolate, then sweetens up a little bit and shows some biscuity malt and then a light burst of lemon hop citrus shows itself as the carbonation becomes more noticeable. Not a bad beer by any means, and a step up from the original yuengling lager. Great for the price ($5.49 a 6er.)"
"This beer has a good mouthfeel, has a good lager full feeling with the crispness of a stout finish. Rather well blended but it losses too much. Good sessionable beer, would go well with spicy bbq."
"Has a decent drinkability."
"D - Very good. Clean with a light roastiness and dry finish. Pretty refreshing and easy drinking."
"12pz bottle, I think it cost a dollar. Dark black color, decent head, looks good. Smells oddly like lager and then some toasty porter notes. The taste was exactly the same but nothing special. This beer actually made me wish I had just the yuengling porter. This wasn't bad but it wasn't great, average overall."
"Over all a damn good beer. It has an impressive look and a strong n, not bitter taste. It seems to lack sustainability to temperature though. After 5 minutes or so, it has lost alot of flavor and chill. Better out of the bottle than in a can or on tap. Has some thickness and a pleasant after taste."
"D..Easy to drink in my opinion (though keep them to a minimum if you are playing chess since I just lost a game online while writing this review)."
"D - Pretty easy drink, although I wouldn't personally want more than a couple in a night. I guess this could be a good session beer."
"I could have a few of these."
"D - Easy drinking, not unsatisfying. Not the tastiest B&T, but not bad either, but it is a bottled B&T!"
"Viva la CAN!"
"Sorry, eagle. I will not come and visit you ever again. Your price may be attractive but your lone barrel sucks. Bring something better to the mountaintop next time."
"I first tried this beer after going on the Yuengling Brewery tour in Pottsville, PA. I bought a six pack the next day. This is one of the better dark beers I've had. When poured out of the bottle, it has a thick, foamy head that dissolves quickly. It has a roasted smell like bold coffee. I can taste hints of coffee, chocolate, and caramel. It is not too bitter or too carbonated. It has a smooth, full mouthfeel. It is easy to drink two of these, but I wouldn't drink more than two in one sitting."
"Dark, dark, brown bordering on black if not backlit. Has a tannish head. Some roasted malt, little chocolate, little bit of hops. Nothing really jumps out at you, it's a jack of all trades but a master of none. On the light side of both mouthfeel and carbonation. Pretty average all around. I'll take this only over BMCs."
"I'm from the west coast so Yuengling to me is awesome, that will be lame to you hipster types but I like these guys and it's only beer. This beer looks and smells great. The taste and the mouthfeel are ok, just average. But the drinkibility of this and every Yuengling beer is great, seriously, these guys are built to last and support them. Good medium alcohol beer that has some flavor."
"Overall, the beer is quite drinkable. Perhaps a bit on the sweet side to be a beer that can be enjoyed through the evening, but one that sits fairly well on the palate. A good dark beer alternative that is pretty light for a hot summer day."
"D: Nothing special, but far from bad. Considering the price and decent taste, this isn't a bad way to go."
"The beer pours a brown color with a white head. The aroma is a lot of toffee. The flavor is toffee, earthy hops and some dirt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not very good, but not as bad as other black and tans I have tried."
"Not a big fan of black and tans, but this was ok. Woudl not seek it out, but wouldn't refuse a freebee."
"Pours black with a quickly fading light brown head. Minor lacing if any. Weak aroma, a little bit of caramel and some hops. The caramel yuengling malt dominates the flavor. A bit of roasted chocolate/coffee and some bitter hops as well. Nothing too strong. Pretty standard flavor profile. Medium bodied."
"D - A decent brew, but nothing more... Mildly interesting... A quality session brew... I wouldn't hesitate drinking one again, but not quite sure I would invest in a sixer anytime soon either..."
"Drinkability - Overall this is a decent brew. - My favorite pairing with this beer is a good pizza - Definetly worth a try though."
"D- Hard to say really. Slightly on the expensive side so unless I ever see it on tap somewhere I doubt I'll ever buy again. One of those, hey never seen this before, I buy it and then I'm not that impressed. However, points for trying. Same as comparing draft to bottle, having a mixed beer drink is going to be different in a bar vs bottled. Overall not good or bad in my opinion, just mediocrity."
"One of my go-to everyday drink beers; it never disappoints."
"D:its not my preference but hey its all up to you. I wouldnt buy it but if you wanna give it to me for free hell yeah I'd take it."
"The best of all Yuengling beers. Sister and Brother-in-law bought me a variety pack with Traditional lager, light lager, and Lord Chesterfield Ale. The unusual taste made me want more and more. Only wish it was available in Ohio. After drinking the finest of the finest, it is hard to drink a Bud or Miller product."
"This was tough to drink, I took 2 sips and wanted nothing more to do with it. I think the Premium is to blame. I may try the old recipe of Porter and Lord Chesterfield on my own. It couldn't be worse."
"very drinkable, even on a summer night. i still prefer the porter on it's own. and much better than the premium on it's own..."
"Drinkability- It's good to try, but given the choice between the two, stick with traditional Yuengling Lager or make your own Black and Tan the way they were meant to be made-- on the spot, not mixed beforehand."
"D- I'm not much of a fan of this beer. It esentially took a good porter base, but made it not quite right. The mouthfeel pulled this down for me. just kind of an average beer in my eyes."
"D - Over all this is a decent beer that has a good taste thats pretty easy to drink so I could have a few of these in a night"
"All-in-all this is pretty drinkable."
"The brew seems to lack depth, and just continues to refuse to give me a reason to come back to it more than a few times. Overall not a bad beer, just not one that I would go out of my way to find."
"When I poured this beer, I poured it a little too vigorously, resulting in a huge fluffy off white head. Looks dark, but not stout dark . It smells a bit macroey with very very slight hints of the roasted malts from the porter used. The porter comes through more in the taste than it did in the nose. I definitely get the roasted malts used in the porter and a pleasant bitterness. This is a nice smooth beer, and is one i could definitely drink a 3 or 4 of without blinking an eye. Very enjoyable, and if not for the poor smell, would be even more so."
"Drinkability: It does go down rather easy, but I just never fell in love with this beer. I really would like to try just the porter that goes into this beer."
"D: Pretty ""bleh"" offering here. The adjunct lager is really overdone in this beer and just detracts from any part of it that could be enjoyable."
"D - Nice for a change, but I'd rather just drink the normal lager from Yuengling."
"...seeing a bladder of a portuguese man-of-war floating near him he said ""agua mala, you whore""..."
"Drinkability - well considering that I do not especially enjoy this beer, I would say not very drinkable, however like I mentioned above the beer is light on the mouth and the stomach, so if you like the taste then I would say very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was light and creamy that finshes pretty smooth. Quite drinkable."
"Meh. That's what I have to say. It's an exact cross between the Traditional Lager and the Porter. It's difficult to say which one I like more, because I, like most of you probably, like different beers for different occasions. I mean, the Yuengling Black & Tan isn't bad, it's just not good at either. It doesn't taste like a real black and tan (obviously), yet it's not light like the lager, or thick and creamish like the porter. I would rather do one or the other. I probably won't keep this in the fridge unless it's the only Yuengling available at the store."
"Overall, a fine beer, within it's limitations. For years I was of the opinion that this was the best canned beer available. Now with more micros being available in cans, that is no longer true, but this is still a fine beer. You should try it."
"The beer itself looks pretty sexy, though the head isn't as dark as I would have expected. Smells a bit too familiar, almost like a traditional Yuengling. Tasted like a Yuengling as well, just...darker. I've been recommended this beer by many people, however it's just too close to a regular Yuengling to me."
"SkÅl!"
"Taste starts off with some mild grain astringency. Light roasted malts follow with some semi-sweet chocolate. Nutty, with some caramel toward the finish. Faint roasted bitterness in the finish. Not much hop presence, other than some vague lingering bitterness. Moderate body with a slightly creamy feel. Not bad."
"This bottled brew shows a very dark black mohogany color with a goodly amount of oatmeal colored head with very prevalent lacing. The aroma is charcoal and leafy hop with sweet malt. The flavor suggests maple malt sweetness and dry charcoal woodsy hop. Approximately a mid to mid-light body for the style, taastefully carbonated and pretty refreshing. It has a bit of a resinous feel. All around a very passable combo brew mixing porter and lager, quite drinkable. It's a bit of a macro but has enough redeeming qualities to be passable for an evening of having a few brewskis."
"I take it at face value - a black and tan, in a can, from a brewery whose lager is legendary where I live (but, in my o-pin-ion, the lager is bleck-retch-heave - if you're a sadist, chug a warm pitcher) - Yuengling's porter I've always dug, even straight out of the bottle. This black and tan is a blend of their porter and some other lighter ale, I suppose. Anyway, as far as black-and-tans-in-a-can go, it's purdy darn good. You mostly taste a thin version of their porter but a couple and yer set. Great chillin' brew."
"Taste, decently agreeable, warms on you. Just isn't satisfying enough, tastes like they stretched the bottom line and watered it down from what would be a very good beer. Decently priced."
"Notes - Good mouthfeel, but neither great nor bad."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but relatively uninteresting. Real Black & Tans are fun to drink due to the transition; just blending the two ruins the experience. Overall, drinks like a light Brown Ale."
"This is a classic brew from Yuengling - and one that my wife and I drank so much back in the day that a pitcher would appear at our local bar without having to ask...think Cheers and Norm..."
"This would be a nice party pleaser to satisfy casual drinkers looking to try a dark brew. Tastes pretty good, goes down very easy and would not offend. At this price $17 a case (hate PA beer law)you cant go wrong."
"I think it may be groundbreaking, because it is the best B&T than I have tasted that I haven't mixed myself. But there are too much unfamiliarity that I usually enjoy in my beer drinking."
"T/M - excessive carbonation, at first there is a hint of chocolate, but it later tastes charred..."
"The taste kind of falls apart where the aroma wasn't bad. It's slightly metallic with more dirty roasted malts, a hint of sweet caramel in the middle, before a medium finish that leaves a little chocolate and not a lot to look forward to in the next sip. At least it's priced accordingly?"
"d- gotta say that this is my first black and tan, i didn't go in with any expectations but was suprised at what i found. it does go down easy, and is enjoyable. this is a very reasonable beer and i'm enjoying it for what it is, i will have no problem polishing off the six-pack."
"Mouthfeel is thin, not much body. Drinkability is fine, as its basically a light porter."
"Yuengling Black and Tan poored a black color, with a decent head, similar to any stout. There wasnt much in the way of smell. It taste rather light, but not too light, kinda of like a lighter stout. There was no aftertaste and it was very easy to drink. Overall it was one of the better Yuenglings, and it was cheap, so not a bad choice for a budget."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Smooth to drink, decent carbonation. Not a thick brew by any means."
"Drinkablitly- I find this drink from the can to be just so incredible in drinkability, its so refreshing and so enjoyable, its something I often now seek out for a unique and refreshing beer, and it has to be stated that it such a value!!!, its 8.99 for a 12 pack and its really a nice beer for the price even though its cheaper than most other macros, a beer i will always have a round to me a classic"
"Bah. What possessed me to buy this, I'm not sure. Will never buy again, and will probably cook with the rest...or give away...or toss."
"This beer is hardly worth pouring into a pint glass, but a high pour will at least get it a bit less fizzy. Head lasts about twenty seconds before it shrinks to nothing. No lace. Color is dark brown, around 33 SRM. Smells like funky sweatsock yeast. Tastes much better than it smells: a good dark roast with palatable yeast, no hops, no ethanol. Mouthfeel thin and fizzy. If you don't want to bother washing that pint glass, save yourself a dishwashing chore and just swirl it in the bottle as you drink. This beer is so affordable, it's worth having for when you're just thirsty. Tastes better than our tapwater, which from Cayuga Lake, is pretty good, too."
"I feel good supporting an American family owned brewery; and this brewery can make some decent brews. One of my favorites, B&T, pours a dark red tinged mahogany color with a mocha colored head with fair retention. The nose, perhaps my least favorite attribute is one of clear malts and wallpaper paste enveloped in a cast of cocoa powder. But unlike the brews from Saranac, which are a insipid mess; many of which have this particular characteristic,(without the cocoa element) redeems itself with flavors that are enjoyable and result in true drinking satisfaction. Sweet dark roasted malts, a touch of hops provoke a nice balance between sweetness and acidity. Never heavy nor overwhelming, this brew drinks nice in any season or during any session."
"D: Very drinkable. The best quality/cheap ""grocery store"" beer I've found"
"Drinkability: If you aren't thinking about the mouthfeel of this beer then it is an overly generic extremely drinkable beer. It has the possibility to be good but if the beer that is being mixed to make this is poor then the black and tan won't be any better."
"Taste is pretty good for a premade B&T I'd rather mix it myself, but for what it is, it's surprisingly good! Worth giving a shot."
"The beer pours a deep reddish brown with a somewhat sizable khaki colored head that fades to a small lace. It appears very dark but when held up to a light source you can see through it clearly. The smell is a smoky roasted malt aroma. It hits the tongue sweet and finishes bitter with a malty flavor prevalent throughout. It has a creamy, moderate body and is quite drinkable. As a fan of Yuenglings Traditional Lager I had to try this beer. I had my first a few years back and I still drink it occasionally. While it's not one to blow you away, if you like a Black and Tan it's not bad for a pre-blended bottled version."
"D-Very easy to drink, would totally keep this in the fridge as a daily drinker if I had regular access to me. Not worth going out of your way for, however."
"Overall - A good beer for the price"
"Pours dark and translucent with a finger of tannish rather normal looking head. Aroma has both component beers in it, the lager providing a slightly hoppy, somewhat grainy note and then a touch of darker, sweeter malt with a bit of roast from the porter. The crispness and light grain of the lager dominate the flavor, backed up some chocolate malt that solidifies the finish. Body feels medium with a moderate amount of fizzish bubbles. Black and Tans aren't exactly the most illustrious style, but even for this category it is a fair to middling brew."
"D - Great drinkability. Not too heavy, nor too light."
"D - Very drinkable. Great session beer. Not something I would really have when I'm trying to appreciate beer, but always a welcome brew in a social setting with minimal options."
"D- Could drink a few of these, but I probably wounldnt want to"
"Pours dark amber/brown with one-finger off-white head. Aroma and flavor aren't terribly impressive...light roasted malts, light coffee & toffee. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Not terribly impressed, only saving grace is the price. Used to letting porters warm a bit, but this one is best served cold."
"Pours dark brown color with an average light brown frothy head that slowly diminishing with fair lacing. Good balanced aroma. Medium body with a creamy fizzy texture and soft carbonation. Light bitter flavor with a light to medium balanced flavor. Good balanced brew."
"Pours black with red highlights and a off white head that fades quickly. The smell is subtle, mostly malty, and a faint burnt character. The taste follows suit, strong malt flavors, not much depth, with the burnt characteristic coming in the aftertaste. This has a medium/light mouthfeel, could be a bit heavier for added depth. This one is an easy drinker, enjoyable, could get monotonous."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the clear reddish brown brew. Head lasts alright, with average to good lacing. Aroma is light to medium in intensity of sweetness and coffee bitterness. Taste starts with the malts, then rounds out with balancing hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is definitely easy. A reasonable fallback."
"Summed up in a word - inoffsive"
"D: Well, it's my dad's favorite easy to get beer, so it's a regular in my fridge by default. And I could do way worse."
"Overall, this is a serviceable black and tan when money is tight."
"Poured from the tap to a dark brown atop the golden lager, with one finger tan head that lingered well and left okay lacing. Aroma was muted, but was mildly malty roasted nuts, toffee and slightly spicy. Mouthfeel slightly tingly and pleasant, and the taste sightly accentuated the flavors of the nose. Finish was fairly long, and decent, not watery like some lower price dark beers tend to be. Not bad at all, especially given the price."
"M/D - Very thin mouthfeel, bit overcarbonated. I could definitely keep some of this around to drink when I was in the mood for cheap, easy, and quick (and not light)."
"Overall, it's fairly drinkable in that there's nothing objectionable to it. It offers a little bit of flavor, and a fairly nice appearance. Not bad."
"Served in a 23 ounce glass with about an inch of head and minimal lacing. Very dark like cola appearance. Light chocolate malt aroma along with slight coffee and caramel scents. Medium bodied mouthfeel warm yet crisp malts. Nicely balanced with a kiss of hops on your tongue as you finish. Very drinkable, paired well with grilled chicken and sausage pizza."
"An okay beer. If they are being offered up, I'd never turn one down, but not something to keep on hand as a rule."
"Drinkability is good because of the nice mouthfeel. However, there is not a ton of taste going on here. I would not drive far to get my hands on this, but grab it at a party and you will not be upset. I have had many more beers a lot more expensive than this choice that aren't as good."
"Pours a dark brown color... light shines through with a amberish hue present towards the bottom of the glass. Scent is is of dark roasted malts with an odd metallic like whiff. Taste is a blend of dark roasted watered down coffee and the sweetness of watered down cola. Metallic like taste present as well. Medium bodied, small aftertaste, fully carbonated. Tastes more like a watered down porter than a black and tan. The only non porter quality i get is the faint metallic scent and flavor. Not horrible, mind you, but nothing special. Beats a BMC any day."
"D: Can't have too many they are kind of filling."
"D - Good drinkability with low abv."
"D: Rolls down pretty easily."
"Feel and Drinkability: The feel is all wrong. Carbonation is too prickly, too coarse, too fine. It calls attention to itself and takes away from the beer. This should be creamy, instead the carbonation gives it a sharp feeling. This is easy to drink, and I happily finished off the twelve pack I had that came as a gift, but there was something I recalled and am kinda getting now that I didin't like. I feel that this beer is a bit acidic, just a touch in taste but moreso in feel, it kinda creeps up the throat, like heartburn, after a few of these. I also don't like the finish on this one...dry yes but just not a great aftertaste..almost woody with those chocolate notes fading in the back to something like cardboard. Not very impressive. Easy to drink? Yes, but as far as will I buy this ever?, no. I don't see why people go bat shit crazy for Yuengling. Its okay, maybe good at best....and thats cause the price for something of this quality is unbeatable. I mean look at Berghof, from what I hear Yuengling is cheaper, and its definitely better. For a dollar or two more than Bud, hell yeah its good. But as far as being a craft brew, no its not. Its not something to seek out. It is the best cheap good beer that you can get."
"Still it is mild and very easy to drink so the 12-pack was not a complete waste of money."
"An enjoyable and very drinkable brew with a pleasant malt profile."
" Next."
"Pours a dark brown color with amber along the bottom of the glass. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of slight roasted malt, sweet malt, hops, and yeast. Fits the style of a Black & Tan. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, slight roasted malt, slight sweet malt, yeast, and a finish of roasted malt. Overall, an interesting flavor, but I really don't know how to rate this type of beer."
"Just avoid Yuengling brews in general."
"Overall I was hoping for a bit more from the porter side as I hadn't had it before. Not the worst effort ever but I wouldn't go through too much trouble seeking this out."
"I wouldn't turn this down if it were my only choice, but I won't go out of my way to try it again."
"D. A great session beer, good flavor, nice balance. I do drink this beer quite often. The price is low, and the quality is good. I like to have these while watching a game."
"D: I don't see the point of paying extra for this black & tan if you're just going to get a slight variation on the Yuengling lager. Somewhat of a disappointment."
"Extremely easy-drinking and much tastier and more characterful than expected from my first black and tan; the porter shines through the mix, and leads me to desire a taste of that concoction. It's only sad that it isn't available in this area."
"Drinkability is super high. I could, and have drank these all day. Just enough taste to satisfy but still keep it highly sessionable, the benchmark a B&T in my opinion. One of the few beers I prefer out of a can."
"I got a finger of mocha-tan head before it started to fall away. Color was a deep, dark brown with ruby highlights. As to the nose, as soon as I cracked the CAN open and began to pour, it smelled like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory in my humid kitchen. Leaning in, I got anise, dark chocolate, raisins, plums. Zounds! Yoi and double yoi! Smell is gettin' a 5 and any a yinz jagovs wanna argue, I'm swingin' a six of CANs atcha! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a definite chocolate taste on the tongue. It was not as pronounced as on the nose, but this was quite good. My brother always swore by YB&T in a CAN, but I never understood why until now. Finish had a lightly smoky quality along with the chocolate. Is it too late to take this off of my ""Gots"" list? Come and get it!"
"D: I kinda thought this would be an abomination of two styles: in a way it is, in a way it isn't. Any B&T I've had before (and granted it's been a few years) was always mixed on the spot (Guinness/Bass as an example); this pre-mixed version lost some of that mixing 'magic' if you will, but still is tasty, drinkable (i.e. sessionable) and isn't nearly as bad as I thought it could be. Pretty enjoyable all told, wouldn't be opposed to more, though wouldn't seek it out either."
"D- Easy drinking but not bursting with flavor."
"I poured into a nonic glass to a half inch of light tan head which fled in a hurry. It is a dark reddish brown. It smells like an American macro, maybe a hint of roasted malt. It tastes like a watered down Amber Bock. It looks a lot better than it tastes. There is just not a lot going on with this beer. It's not a bad tasting beer because it has little taste."
"D- A decent beer that you could definately drink a lot of, not something that you would take to your boss's house for dinner."
"Poured a very nice deep brown color with some nice head and lacing. Good scent, malty with some deep porter scents, a little light from the ""tan," and not as deep as it could've been. Nice taste, refreshing for a dark beer; had nice burnt grain flavors, decent porter with a nice lightness from the lager with it. Goes down very smooth, a very nice beer."
"D - Really great. Goes down smooth and doesn't feel substantial. No problem drinking a few of these (which I'm about to do)."
"Easy to drink and reasonably priced."
"Poured from a 12 zo. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Good aroma. Hints of malt and coffee. Taste is smooth, roasted malts,some coffee notes, a hint of chocoalte. Medium bodied in the mouth and decent drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"nice easy drinker and have enjoyed this one during some long nights playin beer pong. worth the try for a party or something. about the same price as any other macro."
"This is what it intended to be. A pretty conservative, play-it-safe beer targeted toward a wide audience. The real black and tan mixtures (Guiness and Harp) usually have more flavor and a better texture. There's definitely room for improvement (especially the porter component) but props to Yuengling for being one of the few breweries to put out this style of beer."
"A - a standard/basic black and tan w/ too much sweetness for my taste. but is a choice that is good for a beer that is sort of a tweener. I like the fact it has some hop flavor from the Premium, but wish it had mor porter character"
"D- Nothing awesome or terrible its just kind of there. Fairly easy to drink just a lot better out there. Think I'd probably pass on this one in the future."
"I poured a 12oz bottle into my Hennepin globe. This beer pours a dark mahogany with a normal-ish 2 inch tan head that leaves just a bit of lacing. The aroma reminds me of a mild porter. Hints of roasted malts, a bit of chocolate and just a bit of that pale malt aroma (don't know if their is actually any pale malts used in the manufacture). Really it just smells like a watered down mild porter. The flavor is about the same. Watered down porter. Chocolate, roasted malts, a bit of cherry and that's about it. All watered down. I really don't get any of the 40% in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is a bit crisp for me. The carbonation is rather biting and nips at the tongue with every gulp. This is a decent beer, but I really don't understand the style. If I want a crappy porter, I'll drink a crappy porter. I don't need a Porter mixed with a Lager (or whatever it is)."
"D- Good not great beer. Not a real common style. Certainly worth a try since it isn't very expensive."
"The one piece of advice that I can give about this beer is drink it out of the can! I don't know what it is, but this beer from the can is far better than this beer from a bottle (I've never found it on tap). I do not like it in the bottle, but I think the can makes it rather tasty."
"Deep black hue with large off-white head. Subtle chocolate, peanut butter, oats, grass in the nose. A bit offensive and unsatisfying in flavor: echoes of roast, syrup, nuts, oats. Light in body and not true to an authentic black and tan. Don't bother with this one."
"D: It's Okay I guess if it's your thing, not really mine."
"Nikki"
"Taste is, again, just like the porter, but watered down. Frankly, it is a watery brew. Really not appealing, and I just don't know what they were going for here."
"D: Whatever; I'm done with this review."
"Clear dark chestnut brown with a khaki tan head that leaves a little fine lace on the glass. Mild roasted malt and faint euro smelling hops. Tastes okay, not a bad brew and maybe better that either of these beers on their own. Watery, crisp mouthfeel, a good lawnmower beer for sure."
"a drinkable beer. im not too much a connoisseur or even a fan of pre-mixed or bottled black and tans. to me the idea seems silly, and kind of removes the whole point. your better off just drinking an average porter, which i guess is pretty much what this is. thats me though..."
"Overall it's not a terrible beer, but I don't see myself ever drinking this again, especially since it isn't available in Ohio."
"It is mildly drinkable."
"Poured from a 16ounce can into my nonic pint glass. Appears a deep dark, nearly opaque brown color with about an inch of creamy tan head. Smells and tastes of roasted dark malts, sweet caramel malts, and a touch of chocolate and coffee. A notch above medium in body with ample carbonation. Very flavorful and drinkable, especially at it's price point and availability for me."
"Pours a dark jet black with hints of dark amber. Smells of sweet malt and perhaps some hints of coffee. The flavor is also mildly sweet with a hint of chocolate and has a nice malty-ish aftertaste. It's got a decent body too. I'd say it's pretty drinkable. A tasty little brew. Also my first bottled black & tan (in one). Pretty interesting."
"Final Thoughts - I really liked this brew. We don't get Yuengling around my area so when we visit relatives its a treat and only $9 for a 12. Very affordable, and potentially sessionable if I get the chance."
"like it and buy some more the next time i see it"
"This beer is a really nice and smooth porter. It is quite easy drinking and goes down easy"
"Dr. Very much so. Tasty and pleasant and goes down easy. A Pennsylvania standard."
"Notes: Overall this is a very non-descript beer without much going for it, but without much against it, either. It's still a lot better than some of the other easily-approachable ""dark-beers"" I see people drinking, and it beats the pants off of Guinness. Average at best."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Compliments the creamyness very well. Medium, but not very intense carbonation. Very very drinkable and appealing. This is one of those ""please drink me"" beers that is really great to get a 6 pack of and drink all in one night."
"""See, I told you."" (aside) ""Two more rounds, please. Yes, we'll be here all night."""
"BnT reminds me of bonfires and halloween parades and parties in the sticks. It is a good-timing beer with an unassuming heartiness and opaque splendor."
"This is definitely not the best beer I have ever had. But for the money, it's ok. If you are hurting for cash and still want to avoid any BMC's, Yuengling Black and Tan will do the job."
"OK, it's not bad. I haven't had many Black and Tans lately. It's pretty good. It has a little bit of a nasty aftertaste, but I would get it again if there wasn't anything better. Not a glowing endorsement, but an honest one."
"D: I had a number of these with some co-workers while I was out of town. It was cheap and clearly more superior than other choices we had. I had no idea what this style was until I read about it this site (only to find out it is nothing traditional). For what it is and for the price I have to say I had a pretty nice time drinking it. However, I plan on leaving it in the past."
"Not a fan of this one."
""
"Black beer with a decent tan head. This is a very smooth beer with a decent nut taste to it. While it is a dark beer, it isn't heavy at all. In fact, it's quite easy to pop these down one right after the other. It's cheap and has some quality to it. Not too bad at all."
"D: Can't complain, this isn't amazing. If you're looking for a dark Yuengling product Porter is a better choice."
"Strong taste with a hint of coffee that isn't overbearing, finishes light and leaves a nice after taste...not much else i can say but me and my friends are enjoying it."
"Overall, this black and tan seems a little light for the style. Not a bad drink- not spectacular."
"on sale for $4.99/ sixer, pours a clear dark reddish brown w/ a thin light tan head which dissipates immediately leaving little lacing in my nonic ; not much of a smell, cereal grains and hints of alcohol, faint notes of darker malts as it warms ; taste follows suit, rather weak with a faint hop bite, some roasty undertone too weak to describe, more of an adjuncty vinous alcohol flavor than anything else, i do detect some vague dark fruit notes towards the end ; a slightly dry, light body with a good bit of carbonation ; quite drinkable, not a bad brew, just not a good one either, prob. the best you can get for $5 a six pack..."
"M&D: carbonation is decent, but the beer is too watery; it's a very drinkable beer"
"A poor example of a black and tan...but then again, what can you expect out of a can?"
"Pours a dark brown with a small head leaving minimal lacing along the glass. Not getting much on the nose except for some burnt malty odors and a very faint whiff of hops. Taste is much of the same, some dark malty flavors and a very small amount of hops. Very thin and watery must be something like I used to drink in college. Well maybe slightly better than stuff I drank in college at least this came in a bottle."
"If it's the best of what's around, it'll do. But I don't see myself buying this beer again."
"D: Well, not the best beer I have ever had, but not the worst. With the selection we had on x-mas day, I drank it and was happy with it."
"D: While not outstanding or even great this is a nice easy drinker. This may be a goto beer when I am low on cash."
"D- This is where this beer shines, it is easy and relatively cheap to consume. Definitely nothing special, but it is nice to see a darker style beer that is offered at the same price as most of the big boys lovely lagers."
"I always keep a cold twelve pack around to break in my Coors Light drinking friend. Special, because it beats the hell out of the rest of the mass produced domestic beers."
"(rated Feb 26, 2007)"
"This is a great go-to cheap, everyday beer. It's nothing special, but nothing to be scoffed at. On Sunday's when the boys are swilling High Life, I love to pick up a big can and get busy. A great session beer. Creamy, smooth caramel taste, mostly malt, but a hint of hops in the background. Deep amber color, with a head that doesn't stick around for long, but I suppose I'm not looking for that celebratory special beer character in a Yuengling. Gotta love the underdog."
"Overall: Decent beer and very easy to knock back a few."
"D: Easy to drink for sure. Just not real special."
"I am not a huge black and tan fan, but I do like this one for a ready to go version in the bottle. It's good on a cold night or for fall/winter vibes."
"for the price and taste of these beers anyone would be crazy not to get this over bud,miller,or coors"
"Ok drinkability, nothing terrible or great about this one. Yuengling always brings back good memories though."
"(bottle - 12 oz) Has a faint hint of coffee and chocolate. Pours a rich creamy dark black with a thick head. Reminds me a little of Guinness being poured except not as dark. Has a reddish tint to it when you look at it in light. Has an initial sweet/coffee taste with a slight coffee aftertaste. Goes down smooth. Very easy to drink. I was very impressed with this. It was much better than I expected it to be. If you're drinking it from the bottle (and you leave the bottle standing upright for a few days) you can actually taste where the division between the porter and the lager is. Very good to drink. Made me a fan of dark porters again."
"Drinkability: Lacking and thin as a black & tan or porter or even just a beer. In all honesty, I would rather just reach for their Traditional Lager."
"The flavor was very burnt, almost like old coffee. Harsh on the palate with an unpleasant aftertaste. Looks and feels a little like Diet Coke. A pretty average brew."
"It is a nice blend between a porter style and a lighter beer, successfully making a lighter, drinkable beer with porter qualities."
"Still a soft place in my heart for a Pa. brew."
"Notes: I used to live in Hershey, PA (1998) and I bought this a few times. I recall enjoying it then. Of course it tastes the same 10 years later but I am not as enthusiastic about it now than I recall being then."
"I am not a huge black and tan fan, but I do like this one for a ready to go version in the bottle. It's good on a cold night or for fall/winter vibes."
"The taste is slightly malty with toffee-like sweetness, chocolate, a touch of grain and it curiously finishes with what tastes like roasted barley bitterness. It's like having a light stout. It'd be good for those summer days when you want a light, dark beer but can't find a schwarzbier."
"D: It's certainly very sessionable, with a low ABV and a really nice mouthfeel, but the flavor is just so weak that it's difficult for me to really recommend it."
"D- A session beer for sure and easy on the budget. Not a bad offering and the best these guys offer in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture, light and airy yet nicely carbonated, is really terrific. It holds its own throughout the entire session, becoming creamy towards the end. I'm glad to have tried it, it's a drinkable, decent beer... just nothing I'd ever go back to in the future."
"Proof that a beer can look and smell excellent, yet lack everything it needs to the other senses that allow it to set well for future endeavors."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this blend and will obtain more when the time arises."
"Not bad. Yuengling for the most part is decent enough, especially for the price. Pours a black-amber color with a moderate tan head. Aroma is malty and a bit roasty but rather subtle. Mouthfeel is creamy and lighter than it looks. The flavor is toasty malt with coffee and light bitterness. Not complex but definitely drinkable and at a great price."
"Black and tans are not my favorite style, but they are decent from time to time. This is one is fairly decent and I could have a few of these."
"D - Nothing special, but easy to drink and pretty good for a dark macro beer."
"Overall, this is a good beer to get if you are looking for a session with a cheap change of pace. Although not as good as Yuengling's Traditional Lager as far as drinkability goes, it is still a decent standby because of the good price/quality ratio."
"I was surprised by this beer. It's better than I expected, which confirms an old friend's belief that you can't mess up a porter (one of the two beers that make up this Black & Tan)."
"D: Easy to drink and very sessionable. Would be a decent stand by beer."
"D: Session beer"
"Avoid."
"Its much better then the standard Yuengling. I wouldnt even have known it was the same company if I didnt see the lablel. Well done."
"D: I could drink it, but honestly why bother, light, watery body is a turn off especially for a porter. Goes down easy enough I guess so we will call this a wash."
"A good beer overall, and a good value, too. Refreshing and easy to drink, but offers a nice change of pace from the typical less-expensive drinking beer."
"D - I could drink this all day, if it were available in my hometown. I usually only get it when visiting relatives or traveling to the east coast on business. Picked up two cases a couple of weeks ago, and it's almost gone."
"I'm going to keep this nice little brew around, I think. Its very accessible and tastes better than 90% of thee other macros out there."
"Pours black with a short lived head. Slightly less than opaque. Smell is soy sauce and roasty malt. Taste is soy, mostly and not good at all. Just roasty soy sauce and is undrinkable, really. Not enjoyable in the least."
"The taste is magnificent, one of the few beers I've had that actually make you want to lick your lips. It reminds me of a Starbucks Frappachino of sorts. Think Guinness but less bitter and filling. All in all, this is a fine domestic beverage that I will be enjoying in the future."
"Could have 1 or 2 at a time, no more..."
"D- I really like this beer and could drink several at a sitting. I wish it was available in my home town."
"Drinkability: I prefer the Yuengling lager, especially since I'm originally from western PA, and I have a soft spot for it from college. I'm not the biggest fan of the style to begin with, but it's not bad if you're craving a brew as such, especially an easy-going darker brew in warmer weather."
"D: I guess you could drink it but the taste turns me off completely. I have revisted this beer many times and all to the same result. I will avoid but I am sure there are folks that love it. I guess I will have to go to Penn and try it there."
"Pours a dark brown near black until held to a light which reveals a very nice looking cherry stain color along with a small milk chocolate colored head that looks inviting,but is unable to produce any visible lacing.The aromas are powdery and mineral like,with some burnt coffee notes.Mostly a weak watery coffee taste with some hints of bitter chocolate and slight caramel that is terribly understated in this gritty and borderline dirty brew.Seems like a watered down Stout,not a Porter.I had some expectations for this black&tan and I must say it was very dissapointing.Until I get to try a bottled b&t that is better than this,I will stick with the real thing."
"D - I loved sessioning this stuff last night, but after really evaluating it right now, I wouldn't have another. A decent and cheap session beer, especially with folks coming over."
"Mouthfeel pretty good as well"
"Well I am pretty happy with this black and tan in that it provides decent porter muscle with all the malty goodness involved and a real drinkability from the lager part. Seems this is well priced in the States where it is available which to my mind makes this good value and a nice drinking beer."
"Really a good drinkable beer, easily sessionable on a hot Memorial Day weekend. I don't see any reason why I won't drink this again and stock up on it given the opportunity."
"D. We pounded quite a few of these before a sports game, and though they were pretty heavy, not too bad at all going down."
"As with all Yuengling beer, I buy and drink it because it is cheaper and tastes better then other cheap beer. But it is lacking in taste."
"D - This would be a good ""pick your pony and ride it all night"" session brew since it's light and refreshing enough to drink for long periods of time, but it's interesting enough to keep me interested sip after sip. In this way, it sort of reminds me of a schwartzbier in it's lightly roasted but highly drinkable nature."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth and almost watery, and this could definitely be a session beer."
"Yuengling Black N Tan is a mix of Yuengling Porter and Yuengling Premium. This beer was a big deal back in the late 80s when it was introduced, back before there was any sort of craft beers to speak of other than Sam Adams in my neck of the woods. A better mix you can do at home is the half n half of Porter and Lord Chesterfield Ale. The Ale has more flavor and aroma than the premium and I think it is a better balance with the porter."
"Feels a little dry, but has some milky thickness. A little weak. It's too sweet for me to drink all night. Could use more balance. Still, it's a decent brew."
"Drinkability - a sessionable b&t, the sixer was a good decision."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, especially at $14 a case"
"Drinkability: Drinkability is ok, not great. This beer just doesn't seem to have many qualities that would make me want to drink it very often at all."
"Was at a local ub ordered a black and tan from a new bar tender, expecting a truse black and tan draft!...got this instead, figured I 'd try it and see...wasn't impressed, finished it and had anohter before decieding to stop at two. Wouldn't dump it by any means but have had a lot better over the years!!"
"Drinkability- This beer really shines with it's drinkability. There is a reason why it is sold in 12 pack cans. This could easily be drank with friends in the backyard playing horseshoes. I'll try to pick a little of this up when and if I go to Pennsylvania any time soon."
"D - I could have many of these in one sitting. It's a very easy drink."
"after a business trip to Pennsylvania, the singer of my band, the ill mayhem, brought back a few cases of premium yuengling beers. one such flavor that we sampled as premium yuengling black and tan, a local stalwart ( and vastly under-represented beer, outside the PA Area, as well as being the oldest brewery in America, according to the bottle) but it does not measure up to previous recommendations by notable friends. this beer is oaty, simply put, with a brownish amber hue. its slightly bitter aftertaste is in direct relation to its dark nature. the beer doest not overpower the taste buds, on overwhelm the lounge, as i find happens with some other beers of the yeungling distinction. the mild carbonation of this brewing classic makes this beer an excellent ingredient to any boilermaker. honestly, beyond that it isn't exemplary"
"Taste isn't much better, but it's not awful by any means...some pale malts & bland chocolate notes, a sprinkle of hops and sourness. The mouthfeel of this beer is well-carbonated and light on the palate, with a surprisingly decent crisp & bitter, finish. Would I have this again? Sure. Buy it? Definately not."
"Dark in color with a thin head. Aroma is caramel, with a bit of roasted porter-like hints. Taste is some sweet malt with roasted flavors that linger in the aftertaste. Minimal hop bitterness. A little thin, but very easy to drink. This was the fallback beer in the cooler and went down quickly. I wouldn't seek it out, but wouldn't avoid it either."
"Dark colored beer with quickly fading head.Aroma is caramel and roasted malts.Taste has slight caramel with a heavier roasted malt taste.This is one of those few beers that both macro and micro lovers can agree on.I always enjoy Yuengling products and this is no exception.Highly recommend!!"
"This beer poured a pretty purplish-tinged dark brown with a very slight tan head. The nose is very mild, with just a tad bit of porter coffee-scent if you really strain. The taste is mostly malts with a slight-bit of roasted character. The mouthfeel is nice and makes for a drinkable beer."
"Clear and brown with ruby highlights. It had a light tan cap of fine bubbles, some stickage and decent head retention. Very mild aroma, a little malty with thin roast. Low bitterness with sweetness and a hint of fruit. Caramel, a bit doughy, hint of chocolate with light roast, and all of it seems to linger. Light bodied with fairly high carbonation. Drinkable, but a little thin."
"Body is on the light side and has a very macro mouthfeel. Eh."
"Overall I thought that Yuengling Black and Tan was decent for the money but not really a winner. I think I will stick with their lager when my wallet is thin and try something more exciting for my next review."
"I had several of these and while they're far from bad, they're a middle-man between a pretty okay porter and a watery macro-lager. Honestly, I think I'd rather have the individual items or better yet, their pretty good amber lager."
"I'm revising my review on this one based on further, um, research. It's really very enjoyable and this is the sort of beer that's cheap enough to keep on hand all the time, and good enough to drink it."
"Id suggest Saranacs Black & Tan over Yuenglings."
"the pint is black, the head tan(ish) and it is damn good. the smell is a touch bland (though i'm begining to wonder about my own sense of smell), the taste is wonderful, the thickness of a porter and the crisp lightily hoppy flavor from the permium(which by it self is ""pong"" beer) and a nice quick finish when compaired to the porter by itself (another recomendation of mine). the mouth-feel: see taste it explains both. and this beer seems to always be lower in the glass than i remember it, goes down Real easy. much better than just a ""good call"""
"Overall, not bad at all. I like the balance of the ingredients and the relative complexity of the flavors. While certainly slanted toward the malt end, there is sufficient hop character to go along. The taste, along with the comparatively cheap price, make this one definitely worth a try. I could and will have another."
"Jet black body...pillowy half-finger brown head settles to a tracing...soft toasted malt...not much of the pale ale hops...milky sweetness with a fizzy carbonation...medium body--can I say intriguing? Definite caramel tones and toasted scents when exhaled...light for a porter...once a dollar pitcher college pleasure at the G.O.D. in Bloomsburg, now the Black and Tan is smooth with just enough dimension to still be a serviceable, inexpensive brew..."
"D: I love this one. I used to drink a case every week when I was younger and then almost forgot about it. Back in my life again, I love Black and Tan. Great with food, camping or just hanging out."
"Again, a slightly below average beer but a great deal for your buck."
"I'm drinking this beer as we speak. I love this beer as a standard stand by I can always count on at my local shell station. The full sized shell stations (the ones with a subway) actually have a decent selection of beers for a gas station. I usually buy a 6 pack of something like Sam Adams Boston Lager, Becks, or Leinenkugel and a 6 of Black and Tan to balance it out. Yuengling Black and Tan is a good training beer for people that are getting into dark beers. You would think that a macro beer couldn't stand a chance to the world class beers mentioned above or anything else for that matter. I feel that Yuengling B/T is a good beer compared to regular Yuengling and deserves respect amongst drinkers of good beers."
"Nice color, nice head and laciness. Very pleasant, nutty aroma. Disappointing taste however. When it hits my tongue I anticipate a deep, rich flavor, but a second later it falls flat into a sour aftertaste I don't like. I haven't had YL porter, but I imagine I wouldn't like it for the same reason. Okay choice if you want to down a 6 pack for the price, but I'd say overall you get what you pay for, rather cheap and not ""premium"" as the label says, in my opinion."
"When trying this sort of Black and Tan, you get the feeling that you're falling into another cheap Black and Tan trap. Not so. Yuengling does a great job of providing Black and Tan fans an easy and affordable way to try their favorite brew. It's a lighter verions of a Black and Tan and the way the porter blends brings out a good aroma. The beer has a smooth taste and is not strongly acidic. When going with Black and tans, we always have a choice. But when choosing Yuengling's take on it, you're making a good one."
"I'm not sure about ""black and tan"" in a bottle. I thought it was only a draft phenomenon where one beer sat distinctly on top of another. I also thought it meant strictly Guinness and Bass. But I guess that well known mixed drinks call for vodka, gin, bourbon etc. and don't specify the brand just as long as it is the right ingredient, so I also thought a black and tan was a stout on top of a pale ale. Not here though. It says they blend Yuengling Porter with Yuengling Premium, which are significantly lighter than the commonly called-for ingredients, and one is even a lager, so shouldn't it be more of a half and half? It tastes closer to a dunkel - a macro dunkel from the States. That would be closer to the truth I think. What if they just called it ""Yuengling Dark""? This beer is ok - it has some faint faint roast somewhere in there, and it is smooth and quite drinkable. This would make a superb training wheel beer for breaking neophytes into darker lagers and ales."
"Color of a black cherry when held up to light. Nothing spectacular in the smell, decent taste but nothing close to any black and tans I've had made to order at a pub. Mouth feel was watery and not really chewy at all. Drinkable but definitely prefer Yuengling's lager."
"First off,let me say that I'm not real big on pre-mixed Black & Tan's.Having said that,this example falls short of being a ""good"" mix.It is decent,but nowhere near as good as making your on from various different Porters/Stouts and assorted Ales/Lagers.I make mine with Murphys and Bass...not the most traditional,I know,but I like 'em.Still this is drinkable and reasonably priced,so all and all not bad...just not real good either."
"Deep amber color with moderate lacing and decent head retention. Metallic notes mixed with floral in the scent with a touch of roasted chocolate. Roasted taste with metallic, floral finish. This beer is a little overpowered by carbonation making it lean more toward the premium beer in it with less of a porter balance. Not much on the thick smooth side. A beer that has an easy flow with moderate taste and not overfilling for a good price."
"Yuengling Black & Tan is nothing if not predictable beer. Having had the lager and the ale that create it, I pretty much knew what to expect. The most enjoyable, drinkable versions of this style combine the best attributes of their base beers. This one, unfortunately, had no chance from the word 'Go'."
"All this said, Id actually prefer drinking the standard Yuengling lager."
"One very classy beer made up of the porter and the premium. It hits the spot on a cold winter day. Very dark color, but lighter in taste than expected. Very malty and not too hoppy with a hint of coffee at the end of the sip. Very bitter and very delicious. Also fairly cheap for a beer this good. If you like beer, you will like this one."
"Drinkability- This isn't a bad beer. Not as good as their lager which I really enjoy."
"Overall a decent dark macro like offering. Certainly not overly complex, but not bad for the price either. A good gateway beer."
"Poured a nice dark almost burnt sugar like color. A mild smell and a robust tremendous taste it finishes clean and just seems like it would be amazing with a steak(from Penna please) steak. It also finishes off any meal, day, or anytime of the day you want. It is tremenedous!!!"
"D: A decent, but not great, beer. However, I've had this in large quantities before I could afford (and before I knew about) better & am no worse for the wear. It was usually the best beer available on $1.50 pitcher nights all around State College (back in the early 90s). If I reviewed based on price, I could probably raise the score half a point."
"Pours a deep brown. Smells of malt and toast. The taste is like thier standard ""Lager"" at first, corn overides, then the porter comes through, pleasant enough, a bit of toasted taste you'd expect, but no coffee or chocolate which is the mark of a great porter. The mouthfeel is where this beer fails miserably, it's like soda, a harsh fizzyness. Drinkable beer but nothing to search out."
"I had this one ice cold and it still tasted horrible. Ever again."
"From the tap it is a rich deep sable, almost black. Aroma is malty and smoky with strong coffee overtones, very inviting. Flavor is rich and satisfying, tasting of burnt coffee with hints of chocolate - what I call a ""stouty"" flavor. It is smooth yet lively, very pleasing and drinkable."
" Overall, let me get it out of the way by saying I would not really consider this a black and tan. To me this is more of a light porter in both feel and flavor. It was though fairly decent for a Yuengling lager, which I normally really cannot tolerate at all. This was the very least a pleasant suprise. Quite refreshing later in the evening and really just not that bad at all. I would definalty be very open to giving this another try. Seems to be very enjoyable and a good suprise at the end of the night, but again not a true black and tan, I would call it Yuengling Porter."
"This is my first experience with a pre-mixed black and tan. It's never been a style that I crave, and even this ""classic"" rendition certainly didn't raise my opinion. I'd probably 'leave it' rather than 'take it'."
"Pours a dark brown, nearly black color with a decent foamy brown head. Aroma is part lager/part porter with a mix of fruitiness and malt. Taste is roasty with the characterstics of a lager underneath. Somewhat thin but leaves a malty aftertaste. I've never had a black and tan so it's an interesting style to say the least. I think this example holds up for the style. At least, until I can sample more of the style. Pretty good."
"Yuengling does a few things, does the same things, and does them very well. Yuengling B&T is easily the best of what they do. Here is a deep, rich mahogany-colored glass with a moderately foamy head and the unmistakable scent of roasted porter malts when you raise the glass. And yet when you take your first sip, you're met not with a sticky, rich porter but a lighter-feeling, bubbly, tingly mouthfeel and a mild roasted malt taste that is really refreshing. There are hops --somewhere-- because you sense a bit of fruity/veggie background and touch of bitterness in the aftertaste, but the smooth balanced taste of both the premium beer (which is not much to write home about all by itself) and the porter (which is nicely toasted) is irresistable. Great on tap too, if you can find it. (Hint: Texas Roadhouse in Westminster, MD)"
"I am new to the beer tasting game but to this point I must say that Yuengling makes a pretty good beer. Yuengling Black & Tan was my favorite until I found Yuengling’s Porter. Yuengling Black & Tan has a little more bite to it then Yuengling’s Porter."
"An average beer. Good to try it out since I've heard so many things about this brewer."
"A mix of Yuengling porter and Yuengling Premium beer. Its a very popular bottled black and tan in the Pittsburgh area. I know a ton of people that are crazy about it. The taste and the mouthfeel are a little too watery for me and the flavors don't seem to mix well. It is still a very drinkable beer and gets people away from the typical marco lagers."
"Poured a dark reddish amber color with a generous 1 inch head that took a while to subside. Aroma was nice and malty with good hints of coffee and roasted malts in the nose. The taste was a disappointment however. I could pick up on some definite roasty flavors, malty sweetness and slight bitterness, but they were muted due to a thin and bland mouthfeel. I expected a more complex beer since the aroma was quite good. Drinkability was average. Given the choice between this and your standard macro lager, I'd definitely pick the Yuengling. But I wouldn't go out of my way to seek this out again."
"Pours a murky brown color, with some ruby edges. Thick fizzy tan head disappears immediately. No lace left on the sides of the glass. Slightly roasty and grainy aroma. Thin and watery. A slight hint of roastyness, combined with the grainy flavors of an average lager. Lots of carbonation. This one was pretty bland. I don't think this style works in a bottle. Not very good."
"This underwhelming brew reminds of the awful Honey Brown: grainy sugar water. The Black and Tan in a bottle gimmick just doesn't work."
"Overall: A good representation of the style of black and tan, if there is such a thing. Elements of lager and stout are clearly represented along with good drinkability. Worth a try, and definitely a cut above whats usually available on tap."
"This beer poured a black color with a red hue. The head was thick and cream color, it dissipated quickly. The smell is mostly sour with some malt. The taste is bitter with a slight coffee aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full, but not heavy. This is a decent drinking beer which Id recommend trying."
"Don't drink and review."
"One finger head that fell pretty fast.A reddish/brown body with a ring of a head left.Smells like Saranac b&t and some hop presence in there.Minimal lacing on the glass, I can smell the dark malts in it.Taste aint bad,I really cant taste the hops.I taste the roasted malts.Carbonation is pretty easy.I would have this again,its not bad but WAY better then macro lagers that I used to drink and for the price ($20.00) for a case its a steal for a night of cheap drinking.Go Yeungling!"
"I know that Black & Tan is actually a blend of Yuengling Porter and Yuengling Premium. I believe it's a 60-40 ratio? Anyway I'll have to go against my sentimental attachment to this stuff (which I currently have in 12 oz bottles) and say that it's really a bit bland-tasting for a dark brew. Thin, watery, metallic and not much of a roasted aroma to speak of. It's a shame, really. This beer and I have had some good times. It was the perfect compliment to pizza. But I guess I've moved on."
"Drinkability - From one of the oldest brewery? Surprise they still sell beer. Was watered down, was not impressed."
"Cheap enough filler, but it's just so mundane. All those quality over quantity speeches have taken there effect on me."
"Great beer for the price overall!"
"D - A good beer, especially for the price (6 pack of 16 oz cans for $8); it's got a fairly nice taste although it's nothing that really stays with you for too long"
"I really don't understand the ""black and tan"" genre, but even so, this beer is nothing special. Not awful, not great, just, eh."
"Solid beer. Pretty inexpensive -- a 12 pack for $8.99. Poured a dark brown with ruby hints and a one inch foamy head which dissipated quickly. Slight lacing on the glass. A nice roasted malt smell to it, and the taste was strong with not that much bitterness. As a porter/lager, the taste is thin--definitely less than what one would call ""robust," but it is enjoyable and would be an excellent session beer."
"Excellent choice for the price. At $5 for a 6 pack it sure beats all the other run-of-the-mill beers for just about the same price. I could definitely drink this beer all night and it could easily become your everyday beer."
"Flavor is fairly straightforward. Malts blanaced with a sulphiric, magnesium tang. Not much in the way of piney or citrusy hops. Just a slight hint of molassses. Thin mouthfeel that just has no consistency. Essentially flat but I do not beive this beer would improve much with increased carbonation. Still easy to drink though."
"Overall, it's on the bland side. Not terrible for only $5 a 6-pack, but nothing noteworthy. It's borderline blandness and the aftertaste make it not worth it, for me."
"12oz brown twist off bottle with no freshness date. Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights, has a 2 finger head with just OK longevity but good lace. Definate raosted malt smells but not as strong as I had anticipated - rice and corn flavors are present as well. Again there are some definate roasted malt flavors but not as strong as they need to be. A watered down black and tan. Definate macroness flavors as well. Not a bad beer, espesially considering the price but there are much better choices out there. This is a beer for those who are just dipping their toes into the BA waters."
"D: Not very filling, easy to drink but mostly because of the lack of flavor. It wasnt bad, but it would necessarily be my first choice, even if Im trying to be frugal."
"This is a working man's beer for beer lovers."
"Drinkability: Easy going down, good session-type beer."
"This one is what it is. Don't expect much and you won't mind it. There's nothing inherently wrong with it but nothing terribly great about it either. A decent bang for the buck..."
"WOW! This was very disappointing, and considering I didn't have very high expectations for this to begin with, that really says something! It poured a very dark mahogony colour, but was crystal clear. Khaki colour foamy cap rested nicely on top for several seconds before subsiding into a patchy covering. Looked very average. Neither appealing or offensive. Smell was almost like something akin to a Honey Brown or some other such sweet nonsense. Reminded me a bit of BMC with a bit of syrup added for sweetness. The taste is more of the same with a quick malty dryness at the end that seems to say, ""Ha! Had you fooled..you thought there was about to be something pleasant here, didn't you?"" This is not very good. In fact, this may get sacrificed to the kitchen sink. As I always say, in total fairness to the brewer and his (or her) intentions, this may have its fans, but it most assuredly is *not* for me..."
"D: Ok, due to its light abv and body I could easily put down 6 of these if I were in the mood to. Easy drinking without a terrible taste (BMC)."
"Makes for a decent fall-back beer at $9 a 12 pack."
"Not a lot to smell and taste but its ok. Its good especially for the nine dollars I put down on this twelve."
"Drinks pretty easy, not bad. Went well with sushi"
"Am I overstating the mediocrity? I don't know, but I will say that there's nothing inspirational here. The style leads one to expect more, but it falls short of any real anticipation. To make a long story short, I like the brewery, but not this beer, especially."
"I had this one from a half litre can. It pours a dark brown with a decent head about 2 fingers but it does not last long. turns into a light foam for the duration of the beer. the smell is good, like dark roasted coffee and roasted malts. the taste could be a lot better. it's kind of hard to describe but the after taste is like metal, not too good in my opinion, it keeps you drinking to get the after taste out of your mouth. I would not make this a beer to drink for long periods of time as the after taste lets me down and this beer can fill you up really fast because it's really heavey. not good for a hot summer day but better for a cold winter night. but I would recomend at least trying it once."
"Pours a dark brown color with a quickly dissapearing head that does not last long. Aroma is light with sweet malt and diacetyl. Taste is really hard to describe. It is not bad but not something to write home about either. Overall an average brew that is not something I am dying to get again."
"I was expecting a little more after it had been talked up by a friend from PA. It's certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability: light mouthfeel, dry finish contribute to good drinkability. could be a good baby-step into ""dark beer"" for someone not accustomed. Take a macro lager, and add some chocolate malt flavor and you get the idea."
"Yuengling Black & Tan pours a very dark brown with a minimal off white head. The aroma is sweet malt. I like this one, I wasn't expecting much either. Some roasted malt is noticeable and the finish is hoppy. I could see keeping some of this in the fridge on a regular basis. Definitely worth a try."
"D - It's drinkable, but if I'm going to have a Black & Tan it will be a traditional one."
"Thin mouthfeel and very carbonated. Easy drinking though."
"I had this beer from a cold bottle. This was my first ever B&T from Yuengling. Poured into a chilled glass. The head was not huge about an inch cream colored which contrasted nicely with the dark almost chocolate like color with two or three small bubble trails. Overall a very good looking beer. There really wasn't any scent so I was very surprised by the strong dark malt and chocolatey flavor. The mouthfeel wasn't what I expected more like what I would expect from a light beer(kind of watery). It drank very well and it was very hard not to order another. One of the few pleasant surprises I have had from this local pub. I would definitely drink this beer again"
"A thin lager taste up front. Gives way to a roasty dark malt. Milky and chocolatey. Smooth finish, smooth all around. Light bitter chocolate aftertaste, roasty finish. A very tasty and drinkable brew. Still one of my old favorites and a fine session beer."
"This beer is on the mild side, but still some nice flavors come through. If I'm looking for a cheap session beer, I'd say this is it."
"This is a great ""outdoors beer," because it tastes real good out of the can. The bottles taste noticably different, like they're less smoky, so I prefer the cans anyway. Worth picking up some."
" Tastes well balanced with nice chocolaty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slighty watery but otherwise okay. This is a pretty good black and tan because it is dominated by it's porter characteristics and not it's lager ones although it has a refreshing finish. Worth it."
"Thanks for the bottle Len!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color ale with a huge foamy head with average retention. Aroma of roasted malt is mildly entertaining. Taste is bitter from the roasted malt with some sweetness. Not much hops were discernable and body was a bit too light for my own taste."
"D: Easy and fun to drink, but a little sweet for my tastes."
"Poured a dark but translucent black/brown , with a tan and quickly leaving head of an inch. Smell is of slight malt , hints of coffee and chocolate. Taste is a fairly thin blend of slight burnt flavors including coffee and chocolate , can taste the porter and the ""premium beer"" lend a tad bit of astringency. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with a crispness to the finish. A very drinkable brew which i gladly choose over BMC and yuengling traditional."
"Bummed a bottle off a field who had a 12-pack of this. It looked promising, but went downhill quickly. Smells of sour malts and a touch of macro lager. Taste hints at having chocolate and nutty flavors, but they are very minor. Overall, its fairly tasteless and a little unpleasant. Drinks like a lighter beer, but I dont want to drink it regardless. Pass on this one."
"I get this beer every once in awhile since the brewery is right here in PA. I've had the bottle and the cans. May favorite would be the 16-ounce cans that are availabe. This beer is just nice for kicking back on any occasion. It is a good affordable beer for everyday."
"Smoother and lighter in flavor than the appearance indicates. A solid brown with ruby highlights brew that shows low levels of lossely knit carbonation--looks a lot like cola. Aromas improve. There is a light toasted malt flavor with a mild caramel hint. Tastes moderately malty, caramelly, toasty, nutty, and a bit buttery. All flavors are a bit on the bland side, but provides smoothness. The finish holds a good bit of graininess, then waters into the aftertaste. Not bad, just a bit weak and grainy."
"Quite drinkable, just unimpressive.... not nearly as heavy as I would have thought it would be."
"I had this in a bottle at my local bar. The appearance was pretty dark like a chocolate hue and there wasn't a whole lot of carbonation. The smell wasn't actually that strong and had a slight roasted scent to a it. The taste, in my opinion, wasn't that bad considering it's a black & tan. I found it to have an adequate amount of flavor, yet wasn't too overpowering and had a roasted full-bodied taste. The mouthfeel was pretty normal with not alot of carbonation. As long as you aren't expecting a full porter, this beer won't let you down. I found it to be very drinkable and is a great beer to relax to if you want more body then normal."
"Silky chocolate beer-water. This is a delightful beverage made for the beer drinker on the go. Not a lot of pre-mixed black and tans on the market that could hang with this. It smells softly-sweet much likes its initial taste. Has a little taste for your entire tongue. Obviously a rather dark beer. A nice beer to relax to, it warms you body and soul."
"Regular mouthfeel. Nothing stands out about this, good or bad."
"I like other stuff form the Yuenglibg brewery, so i was like why not. It has a almost milk chocolate color, like chocolate milk but not as thick. For a beer like this it smells really good, so good that they should make a scented candle from it. But for a pre-made black and tan in a bottle the taste was well for lack of a better, could use some improvement. But you can feel it bouncing on your tongue and doesn't taste overly bitter. The only bad thing is it is very filling, so if your in a mood to nurse a beer back, this is the one. other than that Enjoy!"
"Yuengling Black and Tan pours a dark chocolate color with a decent head and very little lacing. Scent is weak but one can note the hops and the roasted nature. Taste is decent to fair with a few sweet notes carmel, chocolate etc. but is quite watery for a porter. Mouthfeel is smooth to drink. Overall, for the money this is a highly drinkable beer. Not big on taste but definately big on value."
"I tend to like my Black black and my Tan tan. The funny part is that this isn't a bad drinking beer."
"Yuengling Traditional Lager is one of my regular beers when ordering a a restaurant. The only times I have had the Black and Tan before yesterday is at Command picnics, usually drinking right out of the bottle. The black and tan is Coke colored, clear, and has a small head that quickly disappears into a ring around the glass. No lacing. The smell is very mild. The taste is ok, very smooth and balanced. Other than a mild malt taste and some sweetness, nothing stands out. Mouthfeel is good, not too thin. Drinkability is high because it is smooth and goes down easy. Still like the lager better, but I wouldn't turn a Black and Tan down."
"Very drinkable and very good for the price. Try this one when want something different but arent looking to try something too unusual. Recommended."
"it pours a humble black/brown with a nice beige creamy head with a slight hint of chocolate, and malty roasted smell[nice flavor vs aroma composition] and tastes great either at the bar or the dinner table."
"Conclusion- This is almost beer-cola. When you look at it up close its really hard to tell from coke, its got the same bubbles and almost the same transparency. Its a little more interesting than a Pils, but certainly not something you'd mistake for a real Stout. If you really like dark beer but its 95 degrees you just mowed the lawn, this is what to reach for. Other than that I can't think of a lot of uses. Maybe if you want to look like you're drinking something badass without actually doing it. Mostly this makes me want to try the porter. Its pretty good but the Traditional Lager packs more of a punch. And if anyone wants to know the recipe and is too lazy to read it themselves its a mix of the Porter and the ""Premium"" (read Macro). Since this is inexpensive like all Yuengling products you can't go wrong, but they make better imo. As a B&T I guess they do a decent job, but this is my first experience with the style excepting McSorely's which I didn't like, but I also haven't had in so long I can't review it."
"Cheers!"
"This was a thin average beer. As black and tans go this one is generally bland and featureless. Appearance was sad. No real head, color was a deep caramel with little or no carbonation. Taste was hints of fruit, hints of malt , hints...hints... hints. Generally bland ...and well easy to drink as it has little body and little taste. Not as good as the porter, but better than the other offerings of this brewer."
"Wasn't sure what constituted a black and tan in a bottle so i brought back a twelve pack from a NY gas station last week. Pours dark with lots of carbonation and very little head. Taste is malty with a bit of chocolate but not really a lot of flavor. A bit strange to drink and not really great, with the carbonation actually being slightly distracting. I prefer regular Yuengling lager."
"drinkability: Mediocre, but easy to drink."
"Poured a pitch black color but when held up into the light it's actually a dark ruby color. The head of foam was a bit disappointing, by coming up very fast and then dissipating into small bubbles right in front of my eyes. There was just a slightest bit aroma of roasted malts with possibly some caramel in the background. The taste was dominated by the roasted malts but with a slight dark chocolate aftertaste. Nice and Malty! The mouthfeel was kind of weak with a low level of carbonation, but went down nice and smooth. This made for a nice representation of the style for me and considering the price would also make a nice choice for a Black & Tan session beer."
"I've never really cared much for the Black & Tan style, but I find this one rather quaffable. Poured out to a dark black color that had a mahogany like hue when held to the light. Medium low level of carbonation. Aromas were hard to distinguish, but some malt and roasted elements made their way to the nose. Taste is satisfying if not well crafted. Flavors of smooth malts and grain are dominant with a cream like element that adds an almost chocolate milk quality. Different. Mouthfeel is fair, slightly creamy and smooth. Decent drinkability, i'd have this over many other higher priced beers. Recommended for the style. Special thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the sample."
"overall- i wanted something cheap (9.50/12 pack) that wasnt horrible, so i tried this out. Definitely a nice everyday beer to have with dinner or drink watching tv. Not a whole lot of flavor going on but what is there is pretty good. very refreshing and goes down easy."
"I poured this into a mug and was immediately surprised at how little head it poured. It reminded me of coca-cola but the head was even less. The smell was pretty good so I had hope for it. Unfortunately, the taste was not impressive, kind of like a flat coke, the mouthfeel was the same or worse. I mistakenly bought a 12 pack of this and its going to be hard to drink all 12 before buying another 12 pack of something else. I was in the mood for something nice, like Guiness or London Porter and decided to try something new.... big mistake"
"Poours dark ruby, with a dense two-finger head. Dense consistency, and retains well leaving light lacing. Both pale and chocolate malts int he nose, with some light floral hop aroma. Crisp pilsener malt and chocolate malt form a sweet malt base that creates a great balance that is an excellent example of the style. Germans hops are perceived as the dryness sets in, and a vinous sweetness comes out in the aftertaste. High carbonation and light bodied for a smooth drinkability and an extra clean finish."
"edit: I feel I was a bit too harsh on this beer, and as I've had it a number of times since this review I am adjusting the numbers accordingly."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served chilled in a nonic. Pours like a dark brown ale - similar to Dr. Pepper - and looks blood red when held to the light. Has a finger of tan head that laces then disappears completely, which is disappointing. Smells of roasted/toasty and buttery malts with some dark fruits, floral hops, and a bit of metal. Taste is the same but less pronounced. The body is light to medium and tingly. Overall a good beer for the price but nothing to rave about."
"There isn't really a bite to it at the end, and it leaves a short lived sweetness behind. At least it is easy to drink, easy to find, and cheap. Not terribly complex, but I'd be able to drink a few and not get too bored with the taste."
"Overall: For the money this is excellent. I'd even drink it if it were a bit more expensive."
"Notes: relatively poor brew, the only ""positive"" thing, it is cheap"
"What a nice looking beer. Pours a beautiful deep dark brown with a good, thick tan head. Not much in the aroma department however, just a little roasted malt. The taste is much smoother than one would think. Pleasant sweet malty taste with just a touch of caramel in the background. A good solid beer drinkable beer at a great price."
"D- This is my first black and tan and it's not what I expected. It has many of the qualities of a American adjunct lager with a slight roasted malt note in the end. It doesn't have any complexity or any interest that makes me want to drink it as a session beer."
"It looks like a porter with a poor head and little lacing. It smells fairly decent a mix of dark roasted malt and a clean lager leftovers, there is a bit of complexity here. The taste is very clean crisp but there is a background of flavor that is porter like. Overall I like the taste and can't find too much fault except I would like more of it. This is a rather thin beer, but that makes it easy drinking any time of the day."
"Drinkability: Now I remember why I drank a lot of this in college. One of the best quality bargain beers. This is a highly drinkable transition beer. I was thinking there was something missing from this beer, but it does taste like what it is, half Yuengling Porter, half Yuengling Premium."
"This is a good beer for the price, and quicker drinking than say Guiness and Harp."
"poured a deep brown color with large off-white puffy head. Smell is moderate of coffee and dark fruits (cherries) . taste is slightly dry with the porter overwhelming the lager (thats ok to me) . Leaves a nice aftertaste. A cheap acceptable brew thats easy to find in my area."
"Would make a decent introductory beer to a macro drinker."
" A good beer to offer friends who would generally run from the dark!!"
" Pours a nice dark brown color with a single fingered head that seems to stay around for quite some time. Aroma of fruits, chocolate malts, and hops, and the combination results in smooth taste with no flavors competing. Not bad for a bastard beer. Burnt grain and hops give an agreeable aftertaste."
"This beer pours a really nice and dark with a good tan head. The smell was sweet and malty with a hint of coffee and chocolate. Not too bitey. The mouthfeel was medium, but ALmost a little too watery. I didn't really notice much hoppage here but it is a nicely drinkable dark beer. malty as hell. Musty too. Affordable."
"Not bad"
"Drinkability/notes: Very pleasant and a quite drinkable session beer.."
"There's much to like about this beer, especially when it is on-tap. My experience with the cans and bottles have been somewhat hit-and-miss, but a fresh cold keg usually makes for a good night."
"This is actually a decent beer, better than average I'd say."
"Drinkability: Since it's crisp, it goes down real quick"
"Label stated: *Dark brewed porter & premium beer* Now your talking!, its certainly not a *black & tan*. But damn nice mahogany pour with tan head and laces. VERY malty with chocolate tones (for a $9.69 for 12 pack brew). For a porter, not much hop to start but small hop finish. Good session brew, found these in Florida, wish they were readily available in St. Louis  would make for a great grilling afternoon."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and dry. Thin bodied. OK drinkability, but bland flavors don't entice me to have another. Have the Lager, have the Porter, but this Black & Tan just doesn't do it for me."
"Pours a brown with a slight tanish headskie. Nice and easy oh so very easy to drink. The chewy malt bill isn't perfect, but this brew is well balanced enough that you do not care about the lack of perfection. It's a perfectly simple blend: black plus tan. Yuengling doesn't make great beer, but this one is worth checking out at the least."
"I am a fan of the Yuengling brews and the Black and Tan is much better than the light but not the traditional lager. rather have a real Black and Tan and this is left over from our Super Bowl Party. Mix of caramel and choclate with some hoppiness. No lacing, carbonation, or head to speak of. Average at best."
"A pretty good brew from America's oldest brewery."
"Not much mouthfeel. The carbonation is low and just a hint of lacy foam on glass as I drink it. I think the taste is OK but not special. I was expecting much more body as it is dark beer. Not the case. It is drinkable but I won't drink more than two in a session. I can't put my nose on it, but there was a wierd smell and initial taste. But the aftertaste is good and then you can taste the coffee. It was OK, but I wouldn't buy more than a 6 pack."
"Oh yeah, I gave the appearnace a 3.5 based on the bottle."
"Cheers"
"Not bad."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, yet malty scent with a dry lager yeast aroma. It has a decent dark malt scent with a slightly skunky aroma. The taste is decent also. It has a thin malty flavor that boasts of pale, and patent malts along with a dry finish. It goes down smooth and light. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent black and tan. It is simple, but highly drinkable."
"very drinkable and a good session beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: Blah. A below average beer, that doesn't have any real flavors. Tastes like a macro. The flavor gets worse as the beer warms, sadly. I wouldn't have another."
"Drinkability: Average ABV, but the flavor wears on you and I could easiliy tire. An average stab at the style although I should note that the B & T single bottle is not my favorite offering."
"Pretty good black and tan, overall I enjoy it roughly the same as Saranac Black and tan..perhaps slightly more. Pours just what you would expect a nice black. I find it is a nice mix of tastes and has little bitter aftertaste. Worth its price for sure."
"From an aggressive pour I produced a huge 3-finger head and had to slurp it up before it spilled all over the place. Otherwise, this beer poured a dark reddish brown. Light could be seen through the beer. The smell was roasted malt with some chocolate hints. Upon first taste I got a strange tobacco sensation which yielded to light coffee and chocolate notes. A slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel was a little lighter than I would've liked. When I was younger this beer was the end all, be all, but since I've gotten older my tastes have matured and I'd rather have something with more body and flavor. Overall, a pretty ok beer."
"Pours a dark with red hues, decent head that dissipates and faintly remains throughout.Smells like a malt liquor to me.Taste is bland slightly tart,its pretty watery too,i dont pick up any hops in this brew.Better than BMC and not badly priced but nothing to go out of my way for."
"Very weak mouthfeel, but it finishes clean. Not bad, so I could have a few more."
"Predominately chocolate malt in the flavor. The hop is muted. Overall, the flavor is weak. It's a little watery--a very thin beer. The aftertaste is short-lived. In some ways, this is a very ""drinkable"" beer, but I find it one-dimensional and uncomplicated."
"I'm not such a big fan of black and tans, but this one is still worth trying."
"Pours with a three-finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving hardly any lace. Deep amber color. Good carbonation, medium bodied. Nose is a smokey roast. Starts with a roasted sweetness and finishes fairly smooth. 95¢ for a 12 oz bottle found at Vintage Cellar, Blacksburg, VA."
"Mouthfeel was thin, almost watery, with little carbonation. Easy to drink but why? These combo black & tan's are a poor substitute for either the porter or the lager and aren't really worth doing as they come out a distant second to to either half of the intended result. Skip this beer, spend your money on something more deserving."
"Final Thought: For the price of this stuff it's hard to beat, especially for a rare style of beer like the Black & Tan..."
"Update 06/04/06- Actually bought this for consumption at home and changed my opinion of it. This can't be beaten for the price. The premium beer had less of a pronounced flavor and let the porter dominate. Also was very dark in the glass, but could still see light through it so I was right on with my better than average number from the restaurant. Upped ratings for taste and drinkability and will get this again."
"I was raised in the town this beer is brewed and the smell on hot summer day could make you want to quit drinking, however, this is excellent for a porter mix! This is really taking off in our area - on draught in many taprooms now! Worth stopping and trying if you are on the East Coast."
"Yuengling makes some great brews and the Black & Tan doesn't disappoint. It's as smooth a Black & Tan as I've ever had with a great coffee like after taste. Pours a lovely dark color and the smell is just as great. This will be a constant in my fridge for years to come."
"I wouldn't buy it again, but I would take it over a Killians or other crap beer."
"Nice deep dark ruby color.Very small tan head that quickly receedes.Very subtle aroma of chocolate malt.Slight caramel aroma.Good balance of roasted malt flavors.No real hoppiness.Very smooth beer.Nicely balanced.A good cheap""er"" alternative when you need it."
"This is a favorite of mine for the summer time. As I stated when i reviewed the Yuengling Lager, I favor these when i am home in NJ because it is unavailable in Massachusetts. Enjoy."
"Drinkability-Easy to drink. Perfect summer ""dark"" beer."
"Pours a very dark brown, transparent near the edges of the glass, with a thin white head which quite quickly fizzes away to almost nothing. Smells of chocolate with some fruitiness as well (cherries and plums?). Feels quite thin and almost watery in the mouth. A very unimpressive taste overall, slightly of malt but mostly nondescript--coffee flavors emerge slightly as it warms. The finish is dry with some unpleasant bitterness (almost like a burnt flavor), which in particular comes out as the beer warms. Overall a very ""average"" and unimpressive beer which I would not recommend."
"The aroma on this is intriguing. It's initially a little drier and less flavorful than one might hope from the aroma, probably due to the use of some adjuncts. But overall it's tasty and refreshing, and should make a great alternative summer session beer to many lighter American beers."
"--Joey"
"I've tried this style now a few times and I just can't seem to like it too much. I usually want either a porter or a lager, not some off tasting mixture of the two. They don't really seem to complement each other too well. And that is what happened here. I got these in Florida on vacation and was amazed by their cheap price. Well anyways, the flavor is definitely better than a macro produced beer, but I think next time I will get either the porter or lager by themselves. Porter aspects were nice and sweet with chocolate being dominant. Lager aspects were refreshing for a time. But these two flavors created an off flavor, kind of a pungency that I couldn't handle. I could only drink a couple of these before it was time to move on."
"It is a nicely made beer. Not astonishing or amazing, but sometihng you can relax w/., or, give out to the masses. Enjoy!"
" This is one of the better, American bottled Black&Tans. It's better on tap, but the bottled version has fine drinkability, even though it seems slightly watery at times."
"Appearance: Dark ruby brown with a decent sized tan head dwindles rather quickly leaves behind specks of lacing. Aroma: Mild cocoa and coffee tones peek through with some fruity softness present as well. Taste: Dark roasts are pleasant very mild flavors some fruit and caramel notes with the dark chocolate and coffee accents, it finishes a bit dry. Mouthfeel: Medium to light body decent carbonation. Drinkability: Much rather have their porter, but this isn't bad in the realm of macros or preblended Black and Tans."
"Char"
"Overall- this is a Black & Tan to give your friends as a step 1 to introducing them to Black & Tans. No real flavor. I could pound these like I used to pound PBR's!!!"
"12 ounce bottle. Stenciled date on neck of bottle impossible to decipher."
"This beer pours neatly into the glass; little to no head. The flavor of the beer sets in immediately but does not last in the mouth. I found myself drinking a few rapid gulps trying to get a feel for the flavor, but having the flavor quickly run off my tongue. I was expecting a lot more body out of a beer that had 1/2 porter in it."
"Label States: ""Dark brewed Porter and Premium Beer"" & ""Since 1829"""
"Drinkability: Glad I only have one bottle of this one. Not impressed at all. Needs more flavor IMO. Won't try again."
"I'm going to annoy people from Philadelphia with this, but it really didn't taste anything like what a black & tan should taste like. It was bland and the stout portion was overpowering. Yet, for reason's I don't understand, the people I know from Philadelphia all seem to love this beer. I was disappointed."
"Drinkability: Not so great. Lacks any redeeming flavor to make me wnat this over an authentic black and tan. I wouldn't try this one again."
"12 oz twist-off bottle. A combo of their premium lager and porter. I've had the lager often, never had their porter by itself. Dark, as expected, with some reddish tints. Nice head. Aroma is of roasted malt and carmel..smells nice and rich. Taste is roasted carmel malt with some bitterness, smooth drinker. Kind of highly carbonated..just seems a little odd with a beer that color, but its nice. Feels like a dark lager all the way, the porter (ale) influence doesn't show up in the feel. Good brew."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 31AUG03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"This lager is so great, it tastes like liquid candy once it reaches my tongue. It was a little bit sweeter then other domestic beers. Although it is a little expensive, it is definitely worth every penny spent. I would recommend this lager to anyone."
"Taste is toasted carmel malt, sweet and smooth. Nice underneath bitterness too. Kind of a lively carbonation for a dark beer, Iight and bubbly. I expected a bit fuller body and feel. More of a dark lager taste overall, the porter seems to blend in and fades to the back. Overall a very drinkable beer, a six pack was gone before I knew it."
"Much better on tap then in the bottle, better head (light tan) that stays this time no lace though. A little watery on the mouthfeel portion, btu not overly watery by any means. Very malty, and alomost a little smokey, with the hops sliding in at the end. I let this one warm up a touch for a bit more flavor to come out, but it didnt do as well as i expected, still good though."
"Attractive dark, opaque beer with a mid-sized, sticky head. Nutty and roasted grain flavor. Mild sweetness up front with a wonderful grainy charachter. Medium body with porter-like taste. Clean finish. This beer is worth having again."
"Not much going on with this beer medium size head not to thick. The body could be a little more dense with a little more substance to it. It had a nice sweet like quality to it but not till the finish. Their was a nice dryness to it, even a little bitter.may be a little to carbonated, but nothing I couldn't handle. Nice average taste would not refuse another!!!"
"This is a good stand bye for a quality cheap beer. It's not strong like a ""regular"" black and tan, but rather lighter on the buds. The color was a nice rich dark color, with a little bit of a head that lasted a few minutes. The taste was very malty and roasted nutty like. The smell was like roasted nuts, but with a hint of alcohol. I really dig this beer and plan on drinkin' it for years to come."
"Not half bad, really. A drinkable beer, if somewhat lacking in weight. This one's one of those rare decent beers you can just walk into a supermarket and get. Drink up, buddies!"
"This one pours a deep brown with a light head,the aroma is a little fruity and roasted.The taste is lightly malty and a little chocolaty not much complexity but straight forward.A little thin for the style but for a cheaper beer its a pretty good buy when you dont have much cash but want something darker."
"John"
"Mmm, B&T. I remember growing up seeing cases of this in my dad's basement. Pops was on to something. Now, I know its tough to package a black and tan, and I do miss the neato floating stout on the ale, but this is an accesible offering that stacks up pretty durn well. It pours a deep brown, with a small tan head. There is dissapointing retention on the head, but its not real noticeable as the beer is so smooth and drinkable. The taste is nice, maybe a but thin, but this is a b&t, not a stout or porter. I know they mix the premium in with this, so yeah, there's your thinness, but I really dont care. The taste is there and for being so dark, the beer sits well. This is the perfect beer for evenings, football, and for enojying with company. Delicious, and nothing else to say."
"This black and tan pours almost black. It had a small head that fades fast with little to no lace. The aroma was nice. Roasted malts a slight hint of chocolate and some hops are present. The taste is the roasted malt up front with a bit bite of bitterness at the end. A nice mix of the malt and hops. I could enjoy quite a few of these. Very nicely done."
"This was obtained as a single bottle at Premier Gourmet, but I wish Yuengling distributed normally here. This is every bit as good as Saranac's black&tan; the two would make good competitors."
"F."
"I don't know about the rest of you, but where I am, this stuff is as cheap as Budweiser. So it is most definitely the best bang for your buck in New England, or however far Yuengling's distribution reaches. I'm not sure if it fits the traditional black and tan role, but regardless, it's one good beer. Dark, bitter, and smooth. What else could you ask for when you're talking about $8 for a 12 pack?"
"It has a certain creamy taste mixed with the more traditional American beer taste that just works with me for some reason."
"Yuengling's Black & Tan consists of a 60%-40% mixture of the regional brewer's porter and premium beers. While a stout would have made the B & T even better (and mixing the porter with the Chesterfield Ale actually makes a tastier drink, IMO), this formula allows for a pretty decent beer. From the bottle, it poured a very dark color with hints of red. The small head, quite fluffy at first, disappeared quickly. A very subdued fruity odor was masked by a slightly stronger, but still fairly weak caramel malt scent. Tasty chocolate / roasted malt clearly dominated, but some bitterness made an appearance. Good overall balance, and I kind of enjoyed the malty sweetness in the aftertaste. The beer was a bit thin, however. The medium-to-lighter body really could be filled out a bit more. Still, the B & T is a good standby. For a slightly heavier beer, this won't fill you up too quickly, and will even save some room for a couple more. Maybe that's what Yuengling had in mind."
"Simple and unextraordinary, yet no apparent flaws. Easy to drink. I hear that the tap version is a bit better (I never tried it at the restaurant), and I also hear the pure, unadulterated version (the Porter) is much better. I will make it a point to try both, and in the meantime I would recommend this with some good ol' hamburgers."
"Pours a deep mahogany color, with a thick tan head that gradually fades to a thin layer of foam. The aroma is very faint, with just a touch of caramel malts. That's about it for the aroma. The taste is a hint of roasted flavor and just a touch of sweetness, followed by a restrained bitterness on the finish. Again, nothing particularly outstanding, although a bit more caramel taste comes through as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is average, with decent carbonation and a smooth profile. The drinkability is also average, as the odd roasted bitterness that lingers around in the aftertaste starts to wear on you after a while. Overall, a decent beer from a good regional brewery. Not a flavorful as I remember. Could Yuengling be toning down their beers to appeal to the masses? Can't say, but I can say that this beer would suit many of them just fine. As for me, I doubt I'll have it again any time soon."
"If you've never had a Black & Tan, try the bottled version first. Otherwise, you're likely to be disappointed."
"This beer is not great but I seem to come back to it quite often. Regionally, it is often the only dark beer that is available for drinking. It has a bitter, grassy smell that continues through the taste. The head is very thin and leaves only a little lacing on the glass. It pours very dark brown with lots of red showing through. There is a good hopiness to the beer but there seems to be some corn taste that overpowers the hops. This is their Dark-brewed Porter, which is one of my all-time favorite Porters, and their Premium, which is truly terrible, mixed together. Knowing this, I always choose the Porter over the Black and Tan when it is available. This beer is decent but definitely not well-thought out. I have made Yuengling Black and Tan with the Porter and the Lager and it is much better. Try it if those two are available in your area."
"The only way I could rate this beer, was out of the can and I don't usually drink beer out of the can. But, it the only way I could test this beer. It poured a dark brown, on the verge of black. Taste and smell of roasted malts and a hoppy flavor that disapated in a instant. Not a good beer, not a bad beer either. I have had worst, but, I've had better also! I rated this low only because its in a can and I can taste that in a beer!"
"The beer was highly drinkable and better than the breweries lager. Ill have to get a few more and see if they grow on me more."
"Slight chocolate malt in the flavor with some odd earthy notes as well. Not very heavy, and I felt it tasted very similar to Yuengling's porter, meaning also that I found it a tad thin as well. Nice mild hop bitterness precedes the dry finish. This is a drinkable brew on tap, but nothing spectacular. However it is a tad more interesting than their lighter brews."
"I've yet to find a bottled black and tan that was distinctive. This is a pleasant enough beer, but nothing I'd go out of my way to get."
"Drank out of a 'guiness draught' glass. Pour a small head effortlessly. Head disapates fairly quickly and leaves a tiny carmel colored layer of lace. Color is a ruby tinted blackish brown. Flavor is heavier on the porter side than lager. Roasted malts are primary flavor with a sweet aftertaste from the lager. Mouthfeel is nice but much better on tap. Can drink a lot of these but have to let off a few burbs--pretty carbonated."
"However, it's still a pretty descent brew when you want something with a bit of character, drinkable and its best attribute, CHEAP.  It has a nice dark brown-red color with a descent, if short lived, tannish head.  Taste is clearly Yuengling, and starts off being very close to the lager in overall flavor. You realize it's a different beer in the middle palate when you pick up some roasty character and some burnt sugar sweetness.  The finish is quick and not altogether smooth, but not objectionable either.  Overall light mouthfeel and flavor wise a bit light as well.  A good introduction to porters and stouts.  Nice, but definitely not a heavy hitter."
"This is a good porter to start.  I will have to say out of all of the beers that they make, this is the top one.  It has a nice dark ruby, dark caramel color.  The head is a beige color and is fairly thick.  I leaves a small lace on the edges of the glass.  The smell is of malt, chocolate and alittle fruit.  The flavor reflects the aroma to a tee.  A good beer."
"Not a bad offering,  more tan than black however, the lager dominates the flavor, while the porter provides the roasted malt color.  By no means a bad beer, but I want more flavor in a black & tan than this provides.  It is alot like Michelob Amber Bock.  It looks good, but it doesn't pack much of a punch."
"Great tasting porter!  Complex flavors, heavy on the chocolate make this a very good full-bodied beer.  Take your time with this one as savoring it really brings out it's complexities.  I have consistently enjoyed this B&T."
"Pours with a nice looking tan head over very dark red/brown beer. Nose is lightly roasted malts, some slight chocolate notes & very slight flowery hops. Taste reveals light to medium-light mouthfeel, prickly carbonation, clean roasted malt & a small amount of chocolate. Finishes clean with a bit of dry roastiness. Well-made beer at a great price...costs me $8.50 for a 12-pak, one of the greatest beer bargains you'll ever come across."
"Very dark ruby red color.  Huge foamy off white head that dissipated to a thin layer w/lace till the end.  Malty nose.  The flavor has a slight bitterness intially, which turns semi-sweet.  The porter is very well defined.  Where's the chocolate?  The flavor was good, but a little too weak and the body is a tad too thin.  Plenty of carbonation.  A light bitter-sweet, dry, astringent finish.  Nevertheless, not a bad beer, easy to drink, and at around eight bucks a 12 pack, it is a good buy."
"Drank this one when I was in Philadelphia on business. It was highly recommended by the waiter when I asked about their dark beer selections. Nice flavor mix but nothing particularly outstanding. Chocolate and roasty malt flavors diluted down with fizzy yellow beer. There are better beers than this but this is not bad, either."
"Ruby-black, off-white somewhat rocky head. Appears to have sediment in suspension when held to the light. Result of the blending of the two beers? That surprises/worries me. Lot of chocolate in nose. Unfortunately, the beer is better on the table than in the mouth. Only hint of that chocolate in taste. Overly astringent, particularly in aftertaste.  Very thin. Porter/Premium Lager mix. They probably should have used their Traditional Lager. Personal preference for Black & Tan: Guinness Draught and Sam Adams Boston Lager, which I call an Irish American."
"Not much of a head with soda like carbonation. A little too harsh on the palate, astringent with both grain and burnt flavours. The crispness helps not bring these faults out too much but they are there. An odd sweetness is in the middle, some dextrins that lost their way? Average at best."
"Good beer. This is a blend of 60% Yuengling Porter, and 40% Yuengling Premium.  Distinctly dark in color, with a slight reddish brown hue.  Toasted malt taste, with a thick mouth-coating mouthfeel.  Finishes with a slight hop bite."
"A rather odd offering, IMO, and I'm glad there aren't a lot of brewers who do this. That being said, I think this is one of the better beers to come out of Yuengling. Dark in appearance (I've never seen the separation between the porter and the lager), not altogether unappealing. Slightly malty aromas, with a bit of chocolate (the porter is definitely more prevalent). Taste is like a rather light porter, with toned down chocolate and some burnt dark fruit. Finishes slightly bitter, but balanced. Its lightness makes it rather drinkable, if not necessarily memorable."
"Not too bad, but kind of weak on flavor. Keep in mind, when they say ""black and tan"" they are not talking about a stout and an ale. This is their Porter mixed with their Premium Lager. I cant help but wonder if this would be better if they used their regular Lager.."
"I think Yuengling has a most excellent Black and Tan. Pours a nice brown color witha nice creamy head. Slight malty roast smell and flavor.Hints of chocolate and slight bitterness, mild flavors that become better as the brew warms a bit. Very easy to drink. At $13.00 a case here in Philly, this is a regular in my frig. One of my favorites from Yuengling."
"Pretty good as these types of blended brews go. Nice semi-sweet, roasted malt character."
