"Poured mahogany brown, with less than a finger of beige head, poor retention, and spotty lacing. Like the Ale brewed by this company, very sweet in the nose, with milk chocolate dominating. The taste was similar, but also detected a hint of earthiness and cocoa powder, and a semi-sweet finish. Thinner than expected, but this was again a little hidden mentally by the overall sweetness of the brew."
"Pours deep brown with a fluffy white head that falls quickly, with almost no lacing. The aroma is pleasantly chocolate and roasted, though there is a faint whiff of the mass produced behind it. The flavor is decent, with an appropriate amount of roasted, porter-like character and a backbone of pale-malt-based ale. There is some mild hop character and a hint of bitterness on the back end. This is clearly not a carefully-crafted microbrew, but it is certainly better than one would expect from Pabst, and clearly better than similar offerings from the equivalent Michelob craft brew line. The mouthfeel is slight, though there is a bit of cling that keeps the roasted character in the mouth longer than you'd expect. Unfortunately, the overall product is marked by that indefinable sourness late on the finish that afflicts many mass market American beers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Active right away, becoming more and more carbonated and finally gassy to the point of being bothersome. A poor attempt at the style, and a rather weak offering from Pabst."
"D: Ok drinkability, but unimpressive mouthfeel and taste hurt this one. A little easier to handle, but I was not dying for a second beer after the first."
"D: Overall impression, a moderate beer, decent flavor but nothing to exciting here."
"This is a run of the mill brew at best. No huge flaws save for a slightly sub par mouthfeel, but just nothing beyond average going on here really. This one might work in a pinch if you're on a strict budget, but I'd look elsewhere for something with more flavour."
"First time I have ever given McSorley's a try. It poured to a dark brown color, hedging on black with a nice sized light tan head that breaks down quite quickly but did leave some lacing down the side. The aroma seems nice but light, slight roasted malts, some chocolate smell come out. The taste is where this beer breaks apart in my opinion. Very watery, some malt flavors but a metallic flavor that seems to be very prominent, but not a good flavor. Overall this is a ok beer at best, has some character but based on the Black and Tan offering from Saranac this just does not cut it."
"This beer poured a dark brown/near black hue with a slight off-white head that dissipated relatively quickly. Very little lacing was left on the glass. The smell is of strong malts and slight yeast. The taste is bitter and malty with a good amount of carbonation, which might turn off some. Although the bottle says 85% stout/15% lager, there are not too many stout characteristics to this beer. That said, it is pretty robust and fairly smooth, which makes it drinkability high in my opinion. I'd enjoy having this with a plate of wings and watching a game with friends. At $5.99 for a six-pack, this might be the most affordable ""strong"" beer to get for your money."
"Overall not horrible, but not what it is advertised to be either. Had a nice setup, but just nothing in the flavor department. Black macro - blackro - maybe I just coined a term."
"D- damn good"
"This beer is a complete car crash. Stay away nothing like you will get if you went to the actual Mc Sorley's pup in Manhattan It's a shame this beer bears the same name"
"Tastes very pale lager-like with some artifical sweetner and that stale warm cheap lager taste I have never been able to compare to anything else. Its pretty bad tasting. Its very thin and it leaves a stale unclean aftertaste. Unless you just want to try a new beer, save your money and buy Yuengling Black & Tan."
"It smells better than it tastes. It was quite watery with only hints at flavor. The flavor wasn't bad, some hints at perhaps chocolate malt, but quite weak. It is refreshing and perhaps a good alternative to a thicker dark beer on warmer days. There are better black and tans, but this isn't too bad for the price. Nothing much exciting about it though."
"Final note: If you see this at the distributor next to Yeungling B&T grab the Yeungling, otherwise this is probably one of the top five brews in the case."
"Thanks to tgbljb for the trade!"
"Meh. Not wonderful, not horrible. Cheap, good bang for your buck, but nothing special going on here. Very little in the way of the nose; taste is not offensive but nothing delicious. Mouthfeel is so-so. Fairly drinkable, goes down easy, but nothing exciting here."
"Drinking this reminds me of drinking Jack and Coke without too much Jack involved."
"Poured a clear reddish-copper color with nice tannish head. Smell is fruity, toasty, maybe some dark grape taste present. Taste is very nice with a large amount of maltiness. Good and creamy. Finish is mainly malty with little hops to be found. Very thirst quenching, easy to drink."
"12 ounce bottle. No freshness dating offered. This brew pours cloudy dark brown, with some fairly active carbonation as it comes out of the bottle. Settles down to a light tan head with some scattered lacing. This is not a subtle brew, just a load of sludgy caramel on the palate. Prickly on the tongue. Also some burnt sugary malt also picked up. This is a gimicky brew, playing off the Mcsorel's name. I wouldn't waste much more time on this one."
"Medium bodied and highly carbonated. It is also a bit watery."
"Only real complaint is that the mouthfeel is pretty watery; this one would really benefit from a little kicking up. Other than that, extremely drinkable, and not a bad cheap choice to kick back with some friends who need a good crossover beer. They'll be confused; it looks dark, but it's so mild!"
"Pours translucent brown with a partially creamy, partially effervescent head. Smell has toasted malts, some alcohol. Taste is rather mild for a black and tan, the balance is good though. Not very strong, good for drinking. Mouthfeel is a little weak. Easy to drink."
"This is a typical example of the style. A nice mix of flavors, but not the strongest tastes I've found. A decent, mellow offering in the style."
"ruby brown with a tan head. grainy smell, with slight chocolate and raisin notes. graininess in the taste as well with a slightly vinous character, with brown sugar and then a little chocolate in the aftertaste. very little hops present. slightly thin medium mouthfeel. not bad. cheap enoughand has enough taste that it was worth buying and possibly worth buying again."
"I thought this Black-n-Tan had a impressive appearance as it pours a dark ruby color. The head cascades to finally settle at a nice tan, while a web of a lighter tan coats the glass. It all maintained well. The aroma of sweet toasted malt hits the nose while hints of grain back it up. The sweet toasted malt comes along in the taste as well as mild hints of molasses, dark chocolate and smoke. Although the tastes hint there way in, the beer is abit mild for the style. The body I thought was weak, abit on the watery side. The drinkability is mildly smooth. I agree with other reviews, this makes a good, not to strong crossover beer. Another thought, a good cold dark offering on warmer days."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a lacey off-white head. The aroma is weak. There obviously is alot of specialty grains here, but they are not very aromatic. The taste is decent, but nothing to write home about. It tastes a bit strong on the malt side. The mouthfeel is average. The beer is medium to heavy bodied. It is not that smooth and is heavily carbonated. It goes down like cough syrup. This is probably the worst black and tan beer that I have ever tried. It is one and done for me."
"Dark brown color, with a fizzy light brown head that runs away too quickly. Aroma of dark malt, molasses, and a hint of raisin. Flavor is of dark malt, molasses, and a bit of brown sugar. Not a very full flavor, and very little hop influence. Mild aftertaste of sweet brown sugar and sweet malt. Mouthfeel is round and smooth. Moderate carbonation. Flavor could be deeper, but this is a very drinkable beer, especially for the price."
"Drinkability: OK...I could have a few"
"F."
"All in all, a very drinkable black & tan. Of course, they could have done more with this, but for what it's worth, it's a very drinkable dark American beer."
"Pours a very dark brown with ruby highlights and a creamy tan head that holds OK. The aroma is clearly fruity, and even wine-like, but offers only a slight chocolatey maltiness to those who seek it out. The body is medium with a fine carbonation that leaves it smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor offers fruitiness up front and then reveals some caramel and mild chocolate before fading away in a finish that expresses only a minor note of lingering chocolate. The hop bitterness is quite restrained and just balances the thin maltiness. Overall a very mild and basic cross-over beer that might make a nice change at summer outings or with groups of people who aren't accustomed to stronger flavored beers."
"Brown body, ruby red when held to light. Tan head holds at two finger for a while, then subsides to a tapletop. Coffee and cream and light chocolate dominate the aroma. not big, but nice. Nice chocolate notes in the taste. Mouthfeel: it's thin for a stout, creamy for a lager, how do you judge? Easy drinking though, and good for those intimidated by a Guinness. Still, it's hard to get excited about pre-mixed Black and Tans. I'd much rather have the layers floating so you can experience the individual components, along with the mix in the middle."
"Pours dark, not black, with a decent head that leaves little lace. Malty taste that goes down real smooth. Real nice mouthfeel, kind of thick. Very easy to drink, the lager really makes the stout go down easy. Now I must try more black & tans."
"Black and tans, one of my first loves.  This is really not a bad brew.  This is one of the beers I had at my wedding.  Very dark with a respectable head.  The taste is malty, sweet, and thick.  A nice black and tan to try for a decent price.  Prost!"
"A good black and tan, a mix of a golden lager and a stout.  Some maltiness.  Brewed in San Antonio, TX.  Unable to find a web site.  The style is a true mix."
