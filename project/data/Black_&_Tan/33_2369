3.86,1.3,3.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,"I've always liked Berkshire Brewing Company, they've made some great beers, but when I see them, this is always the one I go for. The appearance is a little thin, mostly a dark-ish brown with a light head but the smell disproves that and shows the beer to have nice hop and malt in it. The taste is a great balance of light flavor in the beginning with sweet malt and almost coffee flavors on the back of the tongue. For a company that makes a lot of good stuff, there always seems to be one or two of these guys in the fridge with everything else.","WhiteHillsStore","May 10, 2014"

This had a lovely mahogany amber brown pour with ruby red highlights. the nose is entirely sweet with caramel malts and a little cocoa due to the Porter influence. The body was medium.

Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, for example, is phenomenal on tap, but surprisingly average out of the bottle. I think Shabadoo might be a better on-tap beer, too.

4.3,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This could be dealt as a porter, but the thin body and easy-drinking manner would give it away pretty easily. Dry, roasted husk malts blend with a sweet grainyness from the pale ale to give this one an uncommonly smooth mouthfeel. There is more than enough hops to dry out the finish and they even provide a nice bit of floral/herbaceous flavor. Slight astringency is the only issue I have with this beer, and that is very minor. Pretty nice brew here, and easily the best Black & Tan I have had. Recommended, for sure.","twiggamortis420","Apr 02, 2010"

Some medium lacing is left behind as I drink this one. Smell is very, very weak. I just pick up some faint roasted malts and thats about it, even when I smell the bottle, it's strange considering the taste. This is one of the weirdest tasting beers I have ever had, it might be too warm but I don't think so. Lots of good roasted malts, definitely some earthy hops, some alcohol, some rye like grains. The balance is pretty well done, some sweets in there too. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied with nice carbonation for the style and some alcohol warming. Not sure about drinkability here, the flavors are starting to get a bit too much after my first glass of the bomber.

This one, however, knocked my socks off. It poured dark, but settled out lighter towards the bottom, with a decent head...all pretty surprising. The smell included cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toffee, and vanilla, and the taste was an excellent balance of all of these flavors. I was super impressed. The feel was creamy, yet not overpowering, so as to allow sessioning. A very pleasant surprise overall.","donniecuffs","Sep 24, 2009"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours dark brown and gets a bit lighter at the bottom of the glass almost as though it was blended off the tap. Smells like both a porter and a lager, as crisp as a nose gets. the taste is consistent all the way through, some coffee, or perhaps chocolate flavor, and some lagerish ""paleness"" if you will. The mouth-feel starts off smooth and becomes very crisp as it goes on to the finish.

Shabadoo appears a translucent deep chestnut color with at least two fingers of creamy ecru foam. Nose and flavor consist of medium roasted grains, earthy bitter hops, slightly nutty, both milk and dark chocolates, caramelized malts, and a touch of mild coffee as it warms.

Fruity aroma with a fair bit of chocolate, cotton candy sweetness, toffee, nuts, light leafy hops. Same in the flavour, but with more of a dry cocoa rather than chocolate character. Bitterness was mild up front and lingered in the finish. Notes of toffee and caramel, dried fruits, and light hops. Medium/light bodied with carbonation a little lower than average gave it a smooth mouthfeel. Good stuff. Quite drinkable.","DrJay","May 18, 2009"

There is a particular hop bite to the beer, that is a bit strong for what would normally be a stout or porter, the ""dark"" part. The hoppy bite comes from the ""tan"" part of this duo. This isn't a bad beer, but there is a definite ABV presence that compromises an otherwise decent beer. There is a tinge of the ABV throatiness that just shouldn't be there.

Clarity is poor - some light penetration and translucency when backlit. Some lacing, but weak legs. Picked up some pale malt in the nose, as well as roasted coffee and a light fruity ester towards the back. Taste follows nose with the addition of some mild hops bittering detectable in the middle. Mouthfeel is between light and medium with carbonation that provides a slight burn across the back of the tongue and roof of the mouth.

A decent khaki head topped this brew and fizzed away after few minutes to a clingy ring. Moderate lacing. The liquid was a dark brown color with ruby highlights that appeared against sunlight. The nose was toffee and maple. The flavors were quite enjoyable, sweet like caramel at first, almost like an alcoholic root beer. Then some alcohol esters come through, followed by some subtle vanilla, roasted malt, then a bit of semi-sweet chocolate (think Nestle chocolate chips) just before the long coffee finish. Distinctly layered flavors and quite complex. Reminds me of a fortified wine or a bourbon, especially as it warmed up. Very light carbonation (but that's the casking) and smooth for the same reasons. Challenging and enjoyable.","thekevlarkid","Aug 29, 2008"

The first thing that I notice is the creamy texture on the tongue that is mixed with a sweet flavor from the Malt, think it would be from the malt? The sweetness is actually a little subdued from what I was expecting from the aroma. I am also picking up a deep roast to a burnt flavor also from the malt. Also in the middle there is a nice hop bitterness that is carried through the end leaving a nice aftertaste. Over all this is a great brew, like the roasted flavors mixed with the hop bite as they complement each other very well. Also it is had to believe that this brew is at 6.3% ABV, as with most of the BBC brews it does not drink like a brew of this high ABV.","Stimack","Oct 31, 2006"

Mint, cloves, pine, pot, an incredibly complex chocolate, and a hoppy base all shine on first taste. Malts are smooth, without bitters probably due to the mixing, and filling. Tastes better this second time around. Only problem is the carbonation, which feels like although it imparts flavor as it passes, is also powerfully bloating and makes the body thinner than need be. On the other hand, it allows for excellent drinkability, which in turn brings out the peppermint and marijuana flavors.","cooter","Jan 17, 2005"

For some reason though this beer doesn't quite click with me. It seems to be sort of flat (not meaning no carbonation) and uninteresting. No real challenging flavors jump out at me. And it doesn't really strike me as a black and tan. I don't really trust black and tans out of the bottle anyway. It tastes more like a brown ale or something, but a struggling one.

3.5,-8.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark brown appearance, small head with minor lacing. Light malty aroma. Tasted a bit like a dark lager IMHO. Slight coffe notes...sweet with a light tartness at the finish. Somewhat chewy in the mouthfeel, with a lack of overall smoothness. Not as good as others I've had by them.","edchicma","Mar 15, 2004"
4.11,7.9,4.5,3.5,4,5,4.5,"Notes: This has to be the best bottled black and tan I have had to date. So drinkable and the 6.3% abv is not noticeable at all. Very versatile, have it around for game time as a session brew or pair it with a chocolate dessert. Either way this one is a winner in my book.","Jason","Jan 22, 2004"
3.32,-12.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Tastes of caramel malt. Tastes malty sweet. Very sweet and tastes a bit of candy corn. Mouthfeel is sticky and lingering. This is OK but it does not quite do it for me. Too syrupy sweet and malty for me. Not very balanced for my tastes, even for a black and tan.","ViveLaChouffe","Dec 17, 2003"
3.82,0.3,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours out brown with a short head. Tastes a bit like stout; tastes a bit like pale ale. Thus the black and tan. Not as good as a real poured black and tan, but a well blended brew. The balance is quite nice. Good mouthfeel and flavor. Worth a sample.","scottum","Jul 30, 2003"
3.45,-9.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Personally, I don't know how you can bottle and label something as a ""black & tan""? -- it lacks the skillful pour and visible seperation achieved at bars. This aside I found the offering to be very drinkable, smooth, malty and leaning towards the sweet side -- like their other brews.","Todd","Mar 14, 2003"
3.3,-13.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"I'm not a big fan of bottled black & tans, and this one failed to change my views.  This one was kind of like a dark brown ale with an overuse of hops and strong aftertaste.","beernut7","May 03, 2002"
