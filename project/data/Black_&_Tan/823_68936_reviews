"Packy (package store) is CT lingo for a liquor store. Funny, when we go out of state and ask directions for a package store we're always directed to the local post office."

"Overall this was a unique beer and certainly the rum barrel adds vanilla and sweetness that sets it apart from boubon barrel aged beers. The barrel overpowers the beer a bit and it is perhaps a bit boozy, but at 12% what do you expect?"
"O- A very fine beer. The bourbon flavor and aroma is there, but in no way overpowering. You'd never know that this is a 12% beer. Another fine job by the guys in Hartford!"

"Black & Tan? Really? I don;t see that from my meager experiences with Guinness and Bass. This stuff is far supperior I'm happy to report, a whole nother category. A solid dark brown color with a fair light tan head with streaky modest lacing. The aroma brings out big time caramel chocolate, vanilla toffee and sweet prune over nutty peat. Wow - Home Run for the nostrils. The flavor is another heavy hitter bringing out deep dark fruits with a maple-vanilla sweetness and a caramel touch. I get some root beer and fermented licorice. This is a chewy beer in flavor but the body is more of a medium light deal with a bit of a syrupy touch that is nicely cut by an active carbonation. Just a delightful dark brew full of sweet and earthy goodies that will put a smile on your face. Awesome brew!"

"THe cobalt blue bottle is a cool presentation but the cost is a little high, still worth it in my opinion, I just wouldnt make this my nightly beverage."
"O- I went into this beer expecting something a bit bigger bodied. Like i said before a little sweet tasting for me and the price tag is just to much. Its not a bad beer but for $12.99 it wont be in my fridge again. This is a one and done for me."

"16.9oz swingtop bottle. Pours a very dark brown color with an inch of tan frothy head. Lots ofof lacing. Aroma is boozey with some vanilla, coffee, oak, whiskey and earthiness. A lot going on here. Taste is vanilla and some whiskey and oak up front. Some of the chocolate and earthy flavors towards the end. Vanilla oakiness throughout. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Almost like its a boozey vanilla and coffee milkshake. Very sweet, but the booze balances it out somewhat. The little card that came with this beer says it is an Imperial Black and Tan, and I am on board with that. At 11.99 plus 1.50 deposit this is a pretty pricey beer. However, the higher abv and the solid taste make it more justifiable. Overall, I wouldn't buy it all the time, but once or so a year would be perfect. Solid beer."
"I don't regret my purchase, but Highland Wild is the star of Olde Burnside's recent 2 barrel aged releases."
"O- Overall i am very impressed with this new offering from the boys up in East Hartford CT! I hope they keep making this as i believe it is supposed to be a one-off. Anyway, I highley recommend contacting a CT trader to get your hands on one of these."
