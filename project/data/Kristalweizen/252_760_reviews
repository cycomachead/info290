"Too light-bodied and low in flavor, compared to the unfiltered version."
""

""

"Very different style from what I usually drink, but this was a pleasant change of pace.  It was very clean and looked like a Pilsner.  The foamy head was white and creamy.  The taste threw me.  It has the taste of a almost creamy wheat beer that you would normally expect to be cloudy and unfiltered.  This was a great taste.  Creamy and had a lot of fruit notes.  Very refreshing and I would suggest trying this in the warmer months."
"Oh and yes. Totally see-through."

"I thoroughly enjoyed this one. A little expensive but great taste."

"This is a really unique, well-made beer, a home run. As advertised, crystal clear and golden, yet packed with huge flavor. It pours a brilliant white head that stays around throughout. The yeast is the ticket here, yielding a big bold aroma like a bouquet of sweet fresh cut flowers. Slightly fruity, with a bit of hop bite. Maybe it would be better if slightly more crisp and hoppy. Yet as it stands, I'll definitely seek this out again."
"Great taste, hoppy, filling beer."
"Beautiful floral taste.  Nice pale golden color."

"Overall : this obviously is still an awesome beer. Weihenstephaner does no wrong! However I was rather disappointed in this beer. My least favorite from Weihenstephaner, but better than most beers."

"Half litter bottle poured into tulip glass-clear wheat color with good 2 finger head with and lacing going all the way to the bottom of the glass; delicate smell of yeast, malt and light banana- very pleasant taste of same with smooth feel and perfect carbonation with all those tiny bubbles"
""
"Smelled of soapy dishes. Tastes of banana and clove.  Very crisp"
"I love hefs and this beer is everything I'm looking for in an easy drinking beer. It goes down smooth, crisp, and clean. Unlike many light beers, though, there is a defined, full-bodied wheat flavor, with a touch of banana sweetness in the background and no hops to speak of. An absolutely perfect beer for drinking a few pints outside in the warmth of the spring or summertime. It went great with the rich German food I paired it with, but it could go just as easily with something as light as a tuna sandwich. It's beers like this that make me proud of my Bavarian heritage!"

"Well I have to admit that this is probably my favorite beer just for drinking on  a hot ad sunny day....always crisp, clean and refreshing, Kristallweiss never disappoints....what I really love about this beer is the feel....it stays perfectly carbonated til the last drop. Those 4 tiny rows of tiny bubbles constantly rising in the glass...it's something to behold. How do the Germans manage that? Nobody carbonates like the Germans....."

"The best of the Weihenstephaners."
""
"O – I actually tend to like this, the filtered version, better than the traditional hefeweissbier from Weihenstephaner, in part because I prefer the less dense mouthfeel and the clarity of the colors/appearance.  Either way, a wonderful, refreshing German standard."
""
"My first bottle tonight is a crisper/dryer version of the normal Weiss version. Remarkable, delicious tart pear or green apple finish. Lacks the weight or depth of the regular weiss, but I could drink this all night. Based on other reviews I must have purchased a fresh bottle as this is a no brainer."
""
""
"Overall: as this is a Weihenstephaner, I've no doubt that this is a well-made kristallweissbier. It is also the first kristal I have had to date, and judging by this experience it will be the last. It feels flat, flaccid and with the usual wheat beer aromas and flavours dulled down almost to nothingness. The style comes across as a low carb beer is to a lager - pretty pointless. Since I can get their hefeweizen for actually less than the equivalent price of AU$68 a case of 24 x 330mL for the kristal, it's a no-brainer."

"Much like the dunkelweizen, it has taken me far too long to try this stuff.  Again, let's do it.  It pours a clear brass topped by over a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises light orange zest, clove, mild banana, and a twinge of caramel.  The taste brings in more of the same, with the caramel character mostly morphing into one of cracked wheat.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a rather tasty and enjoyable kristalweizen, no surprise given the caliber of the brewer.  Good times."
"Massive white foamy head - we're off to a great start! Crystal clear (duh) and golden with great constant effervescence. The only less that 4+ attribute was the smell, only because it seemed a little muted with just a fraction of the banana clove coming through, and didn't really pick up while drinking. Taste was thoroughly superb. There's the banana, clove and wheat-y backbone I was craving. All perfectly balanced and way too drinkable.  These things could disappear within seconds of pouring. Body matched the clean clear visual with a light body but still not overly thin. Finish was perhaps a touch on the dry side absent of any aftertaste."

"Poured from a half liter bottle into a weizen glass - nice two inch fluffy white head, straw yellow and crystal clear.  Smell is wheat, banana and cloves.  The taste is identical to the aroma, with the cloves and banana very prominent.  I also get a big bubble-gum tone as well.  The mouthfeel is very nice and light, as a kristalweizen should be. The prickly carbonation adds just the right touch.  Overall, this is a very under-appreciated style - everyone has their hefeweizen, this one really fills a niche. Great beer!"

"This 'Kristalweizen' ( From BA: ""A filtered version of a Hefeweizen, showcasing bright and clear bodies from pale straw to light amber. Overall character will be more clean and softer on the palate, and the common banana and phenols will be more subtle."") pours a clear light golden-yellow in color with a thick 3+-finger foamy white head that finally settles down to a good 3mm or so. Lots of lacing is seen when sipped, even ring-like and sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of wheat but doesn't look like one and has some spice in there also of bananas and cloves. The same with the taste with some nice sweetness. Lighter to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very tasty with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Never had this style of brew before but it is good. PROSIT!"
""
"I believe this is my first kristalweizen, and it's pretty solid. I think I generally prefer hefes, though."
""
""
"Overall, this is a first for us, in that we’ve never rated a Kristallweissbier.  The resounding feeling is that this would be best served at a large festival in Germany, with long wooden tables, and beer maidens serving it up in huge, sloshing mugs.  The glugging type of swill.  The malt profile is unique in its richness, but it does sing of your standard Weissbier with all of its soured, metallic wheatiness, and watered afterflow.  Residual sugars are also increased, leaving more for the feel than for the taste.  This was a welcomed introduction to the style, and we shall look for other beers of the style that parallel this type of authenticity and craftsmanship"

"O:  A very tasty wheat beer with good flavors and excellent balance.  Try it if wheats are your thing"

""

""
""
"A very good and easy drinking beer. One of the best."
"The differences between Weihenstephan Kristallweissbier and Hefeweissbier are fairly subtle, and I say this having had both back-to-back. Either one is a great version of the classic German wheat beer."
"T: Follows the nose but with more of a bubblegum aftertaste to it. It's a little too bubblegum pronounced for my liking, but good for style. Has a good malt sweetness, and although I detect little breadiness, combines with the bubblegum flavor to make it chewy for me."
""
""
"Bottle from Gator Beverage. Pours slightly hazy but nearly clear light golden yellow with a big fluffy white head. Aroma of yeasty banana esters, hay and wheat, pears and light fruits. Flavor is banana, yeast, hay, a honey sweetness that makes this sweeter than a hefe, pears. Pretty much tastes like it smells. Very light bodied with plus carbonation with a lingering sweetness on the tongue. A nice brew overall that I would never turn down."

"Reminds me of vitus but with a dominant lingering bitter flavor."
"Kristall Weissbier pours a golden color with a very very small lacing head, with lots of bubbles. There is a earthy and meaty aroma. The taste has a nice strong but pale sweet malt backbone with some smoked meat flavors, and some creamy wheat like notes. Good feel, and nice strong flavors. Overall its interesting, strong almost meat like flavor, crisp and easy to drink."

"Appearance- Pours a bubbly/carbonated two finger head. Bright gold in color and completely clear as expected. Looks like a pilsner, but has the distinct hefe taste with big banana and spicy yeast. The spice and fruit flavor are mellow though and blend into a refreshing smooth beer. Mouthfeel is bubbly and smooth. Overall this is perfect beer for just about any purpose. I would highly recommend this one."

"O - This is a very lite easy to drink offering, probably perfect for a hot summer day. It just isn't very bold."
""
""
""
""

"Overall, i have walked past this several times and finally i said i'll give it a try. I should of just walked by to get some original hefe. Or the new Yuengling summer wheat, which is an amazing budget hefe. Would i buy this again? no. Its not the hefe style that i am growing to love. I would take some summer wheat over this any day."
"Overall; An alright beer, but as stated, not a fan of the stronger ""wheat"" beers."
"O- as with most of their beers, this one is the standard when it comes to the style. Similar to the regular hefeweizen, but a cleaner palate. Perfect for a warm day with all day drinkability"

"O: wheat beers aren't my bag, but man is this good; super drinkable and fun to look at ... it puts on a show. it has just enough tartness to take a little off the sweet banana thing, which for me is perfect. at some point I'm going to get more serious about trying more of the wheat beer family, and I have a feeling this brew is going to stick in my top five ... right now it's No. 1."

"Another tasty beer from Weihenstephaner, heave on the banana and clove. I'm a bit more partial to the darker beers with a bit more nuttiness and malt, but this is still a superb beer."
"Pours a crystal clear light golden with a massive head and lacing. Light nose of yeast coupled with lemon and banana. Light medium body with a smooth texture that is attacked by the effervescence of this well carbonated ale. The flavor profile begins like the nose then progresses to a subtle clove spiciness. The finish is clean with a nice clove twinge that lingers. While outstanding in its own right, it tastes like a light version of Allagash White."

"Tried this a couple days ago. Just such a great flavorful beer. Not that bitter and I can now remember the banana notes. I almost confused it with a buttery quality, that tasted great, but makes more since of banana. Over all great beer and great brewer. Also one of the best looking beers i have seen in a while."
""
""
""
""
"O: Just a perfectly crafted beauty. Can easily drink a few of these at 5.4% in the summer time on the porch but I'm fine with drinking this in the blizzard right now too. Not a fan of wheat beers really, but this is magnificent."
""
""
""
"O: Very good refreshing brew."
""
"Overall: Finally, a Kristallweizen I can get behind. This one maintains all of the banana-clove flavors traditional to the style and rather than tasting like a diluted hefeweizen, this one drinks crisp and clean leading to a dry, but refreshing finish. A great beer, and the best Kristallweizen I've had to date."

"DATE TASTED: December 31, 2013... GLASSWARE: Weihenstephaner weizen glass...OCCASION: home fore New Year's Eve and hoping this beer delivers like champagne... APPEARANCE: as advertised, crystal gold, mildly effervescent base; thick, cumulous white head; good, persistent, wavy lacing... AROMA: banana, clove, bubblegum and yeast; unmistakably wheaty... PALATE: bubbly, beefy body--yet light and fluid; crisp and clean, with an almost medium-bodied presence...TASTE: bubblegum esters front and center; apple, pear and some clove--an enjoyable experience... OVERALL: a fantastic filtered version of the vividly unfiltered offering; a great combination of drinkability and character; champagne indeed! its refreshing zest pairs well with light cheeses and crackers..."

"I'd go their Hefe every time, but a minor niggle in comparison"

"I am not an expert with this style of beer so I am rating it per my tastes and not so much how it ranks against others. The beer poured a lighter golden fairly clear with thick head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent carries clove and biscuit. The taste is strong clove with some banana and bread. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with smooth carbonation. Overall the beer is decent but I would not drink a lot of it."
"Better than 95% of wheat beers on the planet. Only eclipsed by a few hefeweizens."

"Mouthfeel is light crisp and highly carbonated. Very refreshing."

"Atmosphere is excellent. Giant, persistent head, neverending effervescence, and some nice lacing. Nose is hay with a little citrus. Pungent sourdough accentuated with a little honey and lemon citrus. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, my first sampling of the style, so it seemed fitting to try one from the king of kristalweizen's unshaven cousin, the hefeweizen. Personally, I think I would choose the latter for just sitting and drinking, but for fine dining, the kristalweizen is an excellent idea to take the place of wine, due to it's refinement as well as the fact that it would work well with a number of different cuisines."

"3.5 D: If you haven't noticed the theme yet, this is a shell of it's normal hefe self. It's still a pretty damn good shell, but I don't see a reason to ever buy this if the hefe is available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very sweet citrusy beer. It reminds me of some belgian sweet champagney style beer. I tried this during a blind tasting and liked it a lot."
"overall: You don't see this style very much in the US, but it's obviously very popular in certain parts of Germany. As a hefe is already a pretty smooth beer by definition, this is basically an even smoother version. If you like hefes, you will like this, but this will also appeal more towards lager drinks as well as it's clear without any particles (if that's not your thing). A truly amazing perfectly balanced beer from one of the worlds oldest (and best) breweries."
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. Super drinkable and refreshing. I do agree with some prior posters that this does lack the body and vibrancy of many of Weihenstephaner's other brews. I guess that is the point of this style though. Great beer, but I'll choose most of the others before it."

"Do yourself a favor and drink the unfiltered weissbiers...or have a lager instead if you must."

"Pours perfectly clear the color of light straw yellow with a tinge of something green. Champagne effervescence and a billowy white head that is loathe to recede and just stays with a thick collar and cap. Soapy wet lace. Very beautiful. Nose is yeast, banana, clove. fruity lemon and peppery with a little skunk. Taste is light as a feather and follows the nose. Banana, sweet grain, bubblegum, a touch metallic and just a little bitter to end. Malt comes forward as it warms but never becomes too sweet. Finishes dry with a hint of apples and pear. Soft, creamy and earthy. Delicate."
""
""
""
""
"Straw yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a huge white, billowy, yet slighty fizzy foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Wheat bread aromas up front followed by sweet banana and light peppery spice beneath. Medium bodied with light, but rich, tangy carbonation. Balanced combination of wheat malt, sweet banana, and light peppery spice up front and into the middle. Tart flavors and a spicy, tangy bite thru the middle to the end with hints of banana sweetness. Finishes with a clean light tartness with sweet notes overtop. Fabulous delicate textures and flavor nuiances. Can't go wrong with Weihenstephaner."
"Tastes light and refreshing with a full body lurking in the background. Banana and clove notes are there with some lemon zest bitterness. Backed by some earthy wood cedar notes. A solid brew."
""
""
"O - Again, not a big fan of the style, but I didn't care for this beer. Too much wine-ish taste, and not enough ""beerness"". Certainly not a bad beer, and it's rating in my book improved the 2nd time I tried it."
""
""
"o: great stuff. their hefe is still my favorite, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with this and is super delicious and refreshing. no reason not to drink this."

"This is a great brew. I've never had a Kristalweizen before (I don't believe), but it is quite refreshing. It is crisp and smooth, and has a banana and citrus taste and smell. This certainly has the earmarks of a Hefe, but is more refreshing than most. I would get this again."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Crystal clear, with a nice white foam. Easy on the mouth a crisp and refreshing gentle giant."

"Overall these are the best examples of the style. Not as tasty as the Weizenbock but I think I prefer it to the Hefeweizen simply for it's easier drink ability."
""
""
""
""
""
"A delightfully light beer, great example of the style and one hell of a deal at $2.50."
""
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a voluminous cap of white foam. Aroma smells prominently of banana and clove, with some yeast as well. Taste is consistent with the aroma--banana, clove, and a velvety mouthfeel courtesy courtesy of the character of the yeast and perky carbonation. The appearance is obviously a stark contrast to that of the unfiltered hefeweiss, but the flavor holds up admirably in spite of this. It's noticeably thinner in body and slightly less full of flavor, yet it captures that signature hefeweiss essence. A flavorful and refreshing brew."

"overall, it has a very successful air to it, but commercial still. very nice after a long day at work. everything from the brewery is superb in quality and taste. a nice uneven lace down the sides and the foam clings perfectly. the taste gets thin after it drops toward the belly, but it's a great beer on all sides. straight 4.5's all the way across for me..."
""
"The mildest offering I have had from this great brewery but still so incredibly solid. Just try the whole Weihenstephaner catalog if you are new to German beer, so nice."
""
""
""
"Overall, there's no doubting this is a well-crafted and well-made beer. It's also a very good Kristalweizen, a style which I feel is often overlooked. Of the ones I've tried, I think Schneider's is better, but this makes a very worthy stablemate to Weihenstephaner's other excellent beers."

"500 ml bottle into signature weizen glass, bottled 7/24/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy bright white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pear, banana, clove, wheat, pepper, bubblegum, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with nice strength. Taste of lemon, pear, banana, clove, wheat, pepper, bubblegum, floral, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of banana, light fruits, clove, wheat, pepper, bubblegum, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity and spicy esters; with a good amount of robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, smooth, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic kristall weissbier! Great balance and complexity of fruity and spicy esters; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"you just don't see a lot of these in this country. a hefe that's been filtered out perfectly clear, hence ""kristall"". it really is a lovely brew, full flavored but delicate and light. I could drink this from sun up til sun down no worries. the pours is a bright and clear sunshine yellow color with a good two inches of white head. the nose is all the same yeasty banana and spice flavors im used to in their hefeweiss, but there a certain crispness to this one. the flavor is wheat malt on the front end with very little sweetness, and a familiar and refreshing fruity yeast finish. weve been drinking a lot of these kinds of beers lately, since my old lady here really likes that banana flavor. this one has a ton of that, and we both really liked how clean it drinks. one bottle was definitely not enough, but you do have to drink it when its cold. the warmer it gets the more it falls apart. great carbonation and a very light body, maybe a little thin, but I think that's the point here. taking out the yeast really makes this an all day drinker that doesn't fill you up a lick. impressive stuff again from weihenstephaner."

"OVerall - Very light, smooth and easy to drink. A Step down from a hefe, lacks the flavors, crispness, and overall feel. Still tasty and soild and for sure worth a drink."
"To summarize, this is crisp, refreshing, and simple - but still a great product as always from Weihenstephan. This is very easy to drink and should do good for any occasion that I want a world-class take on a kristalweizen when I'm not feeling like packing myself with the far breadier characteristics of a hefe. If there's any beer I'll drink representing this style... This is the one. Prost!"
"Overall this is a very good introductory beer. Also is a great cleanser between different beers and I can see it going with loads of different foods. Not over powering but not bland either. Fits the style perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think it'd be a great summer beer, and I may try it again on a hot summer afternoon. Then again, if I like the Hefeweissbier better and that's the same price, I'll probably skip this and go with that, as that's still light as well."

"The beer pours superbly clear, like ginger ale in color, with yellow straw tendencies. The head is massively smooth and white with tightly packed bubbles. The body is extremely clear with lots of bubbles running up from the bottom of the glass. Lacing is slippery, sticky with fat and thick with walls along the sides of the glass like latte foam. On the nose the beer smells cleanly of wet banana and clove with nice light yeast notes and slight spices from the wheat. The beer tastes similarly bananay with clove notes with slight tingly mint in the aftertaste. The beer begins as clean light wheat malt before opening into heavy banana notes with light clove hints, and slowly closing out into minty lingering. On the mouth this beer is superbly clean with light bubbling prickles. The beer turns slightly syrupy as it moves over the tongue with light to medium body, and it leaves the tongue slightly dry and very clean. Overall, this is a superbly clean weizen beer. I admittedly have never had a kristalweizen before, but as far as I can tell from style descriptions this beer meets them beautifully, marrying clean mouthfeel with the banana and clove flavors of a hefeweizen. A great beer with awesome wheat character."

"This is a great drinking beer on its own, with lively conversation, or with a meal."
""
"O: Decent, but truly an ""also ran"" compared with a good Hefeweizen."
""
"Overall --- I enjoyed this offering, it is a nice change of pace offering from Weihenstephaner. I would definitely recommend trying, to say the least. This beer has definitely earned its way into my rotation. With that said, I still prefer their not filtered weizens."
""
"O - Refreshing. Not overly complex. Simple, well-balanced, doesn't demand a lot out of you but satisfies. Good stuff."
""
"Very good - the essence of a classic weissbier is captured perfectly in the flavour and aroma. It looks great, while the smell and taste meet expectations. Only the mouthfeel falls short of the mark: it just doesn't quite have the body that the unfiltered version of this beer possesses. Ultimately it's depth of character that is reduced in this kristall; the hefeweissen just has something extra. However, it remains beautifully crafted and highly drinkable. Well worth sampling."

"Style rating : 4.25-4.5 overall. Personal preference: 3.25."

"Food match: Paring with some sort of a Helles-Weizen hybrid could be a living Hell (puns; Germans love puns!), but I think it is safe to say a plate of Weisswurst, Sauerkraut, Spaetzle, Bratkartoffeln and a healthy dollop of Senf would go quite well with this."

"Overall a very nice lighter beer. It's an easy drinker and way better than other light beer I've ever had. Not something I would have another of due to the light nature of it but the execution is killer."
""
"Very nice hefeweisen. Easy to drink, sweet, and overall tasty. Slightly lacking in flavor compared to other hefes out there (including more by Weihenstephaner), but good nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a style I'd go after again, but this was enjoyable. I'm still preferential to the Hefe."

"Banana up front along with sweet bready malts. Cloves comes thought the taste, I get some hint of apples, raw cookie dough, slight touch of lemony towards the finish. Body is almost creamy, very soft carbonation."
""
""
""
"Delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Gushing carbonation on opening. Pale straw colour. Large, finely-textured white head is retentive and leaves a patchy lace. Wheat cracker aroma with hints of lemon and banana. Flavours of sweet white bread, clove, and banana. Light-bodied and heavily carbonated. Carbonation, though abundant, is soft and very finely textured. I prefer the richer mouthfeel and stronger flavours in the regular weiss, but this still succeeds on its own merits."

"O: A great beer that I would definitely try again"

"Poured into a Pilsener glass. Like the name says, crystal clear. A pale straw/yellow color with a tornado of carbonation. The carbonation looks like wisps of smoke coming up from the tapered bottom of the glass. A huge hand width of shaving cream white head on top that stands on the beer due to the neverending carbonation. That's a good lookin' beer. The aroma coming off of the beer is very similar to the Hefeweizen. Some wheat, banana and bubble gum. Bubble gum/banana flavors, the taste is similar to a Hefe with a little bit more honey malt and grassy hop flavor. Feel is very light and spicy from the carbonation. There is a big difference in the feel. The smoothness of an unfiltered wheat beer is not there. This makes the beer kind of thin. Definitely a tasty, well-crafted beer. I'll be having more of this during the many German Beer fests in the coming months. Prost!"
""
""
"A good job of filtering the beer to make it look nice while keeping the important flavors in the beer. While I would not make it a habit to drink this beer because I prefer traditional hefeweizens, this is a nice beer in its own right and is a good alternative to a hefeweizen if someone prefers a crisper-tasting and cleaner-looking beer."
""
"Pours clear golden with a large white head and plentiful rising tiny bubbles from the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates slowly. The beer smells banana and clove forward, though not as intensely as it is for their hefeweizen. It smells cleaner and the wheat malt presence is bready in the nose. the taste follows the nose. The wheat and barley malts bring a bready taste. The clove provides spicy balance and the banana flavor is also present. Both are milder than in the hefeweizen, allowing the malt profile to shine. This is expected for the style. The body is light with strong carbonation. The finish is smooth. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent, refreshing beer."

"I’m really much more familiar with hefeweizens than I am with krystalweizens, but this was a great example. Whereas a hefe is somewhat more substantial in both flavour and body due to the suspended yeast, I found that this one was a lot lighter and went down much smoother. This is a great summer brew is served cool enough. I still prefer the hefe that these guys make."
""
""
"500ml bottle. Pours a crystal clear pale yellow with a large lasting fluffy white head. Aroma and Taste of wheat, banana, some citrus and grassy notes, with some mild bitterness. Palate is a light to medium body, a crisp clean mouthfeel with good carbonation. Finish is a combination of wheat, sweet citrus and banana flavor, a bit of tart notes with some bitterness on the end for balance. Overall a very good, crisp and refreshing brew. Nicely done"

"This beer pours with a four finger head that lasts and leaves lacing on the glass. Pale yellow in colour and very bubbly. Smells of cloves, bananas, wheat, citrus, and sugar. Tastes just as it smells. Moderate banana, cloves, citrus, wheat and a touch of ginger. Mouthfeel is a tad watery, dry and a bit champagne like. A nice session ale."
""
""
""
"O: Another great summer beer"
"Overall: Bold aroma, lighter taste. A bit overcarbonated, which ends up stinging the tongue and covering the taste a bit."
"Overall: I am new to Kristalwiezen beer style and this is a really enjoyable brew! Had this beer with lunch at a german restaurant the beer was pared with a sausage sampler platter. Fantastic pairing; for a moment I felt like I was in Germany."
"Final Grade: 4.15, an excellent A-. Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier combines the delicious, complex flavour profile of their flagship hefeweizen with the clean, crisp drinkability of a German pale lager - a fabulous combination. If push came to shove I'd probably prefer Weihenstephaner's regular hefe during much of the year - but in the heat of summer, this stuff's fresh, crisp mouthfeel must earn it some strong consideration. Definitely worth a try - if not a must-have."
"(originally reviewed: 09-16-2011)"
""
"O - The aroma & flavour is more muted than the Hefeweizen. I love wheat beers but filtering it seems to take away some of it's unique characteristics. Despite that, this one still has plenty of flavour and is certainly quite drinkable on a hot summer's day."
""
"Marked high, because it's the best of the style I've had, but still not a fan."
""
""
"Clear golden yellow in body with gigantic frothy white head that stays. Aroma of vanilla, banana, clove, floral notes, some honey. Tastes of vanilla, floral notes, slight honey and a light bitterness. Mild banana in the aftertaste. Big carbonation, bubbly mouthfeel, light bodied. Wonderful, really."
""
"This beer was good, but a far cry from what I remembered. Judging by the date code of 4151, it was past it's prime. The first number, ""4" indicates day of month in conjunction with the second two numbers, ""15"" which indicate the week of the year, and the last number ""1" indicates the year, so the born on date is April 14, 2011. Weihenstephaners are said to have a shelf life of 12 months."
"Final Thoughts: Weihenstephaner markets itself as the world's oldest continuously operating brewery, which may in fact be true. Regardless of that though, it is easily one of the best brewery's around. This stuff is an incredible beer and practically the perfect example of the Kristalweizen. This is another exceptional beer brewed by the undisputed kings of Wheat beer."
""
"O- I am surprised by how close the Hefeweissbier and the Kristallweizen are. The Kristallweizen seems more light and crisp than the Hefe, although both are solid beers. Another one well done from Weihenstephaner."
"I still prefer the classic hefeweizen, but this was an enjoyable summer brew. I've never understood kristalweizens, but now I can certainly understand the appeal. Will be back for some of these during the hottest days of the summer."
""
"I tried this beer on May 30, 2012 after purchasing from the King and Spadina LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent light gold colour with a generous bubbly snow white head that quickly dissipated. The aroma was mild wheat, some hops, and some spiciness. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and medium carbonation. The flavour was sweet wheat malt, some spiciness and some fruit tones in the mix."
""
""
"Overall - Similar to it's hefewiezen cousin, but with a few distinct differences. Gone are the yeasty bubblegum flavors, and it opens the door for the wheat to shine through more clearly. The finish is more crisp and clean. That said, I prefer the former. This is a great beer, but I'd rather have the hefe or the dunkel."
"Overall, nice, but to me it is just a muted version of the Hefewiezen, which is excellent. Really can't see why I would ever pick this one over the standard. Perhaps this is just to say that kristalweizens are not my bag?"
""
""
"O- Sometimes when I buy a new beer I never check the style guide to read up on it. I would have never expected something as simple as filtration can make such a difference. This brewery has been around the longest for a reason."
""
"A gold standard for the style."
"O - A tasty ale with loads of flavour, but not to be interpreted as overwhelming. Nice summer ale, quite fruity and sweet and well worth grabbing."
""
"Very pale light blonde colour, 2 fingers of dense rocky head, quite a bit of lace left on the glass. Smell is of banana and spice, a pretty generous helping of malt, some bubblegum and yeast, clove and quite fruity as a whole. Taste is spicy with biscuity/cracker like malt, banana and cloves, some yeastiness with more banana in the aftertaste. Medium carb, light-med feel, decent enough but room for improvement as far as mouthfeel goes. Overall I was pretty impressed with how flavourful this was as my expectations were not super high for some reason, would gladly have this again."
""
"O - Another Weihenstephaner winner, Kristallweissbier removes the ""unsightliness"" of the yeast sediment and wheat proteins but keeps the core essence of the beer intact. Plenty of yeast characteristics have been infused so deeply into the beer they can't be taken away; earthy spice and boat-loads of bananas. While the wheat still plays a roll, the pale malt is more pronounced in this crystal clear wheat. Fantastic to the last drop, just make sure it doesn't erupt all over your table!"
""
"D: Enjoying this quite a bit, and would certainly recommend. Appropriate as a spring-time indulgence with such a clean and crisp taste coupled with a refreshing spritzer-like quality."
""
""
"O: Weihenstephaner just doesn't disappoint. Price point, quality, and craftsmanship just can't be beat, which is saying a lot for an imported beer (price-wise of course; quality and craftsmanship are expected from a brewery this old). Certainly worth a try if you've never had it before"

"overall - I like it better that most hefe's, but I still wouldn't seek it out again."

"Overall, ups and downs with this one. The appearance is outstanding, and the beer is clean and crisp. It was fun to try and this would be great on a sunny, Saturday afternoon on the deck with some bratwurst."

""
"A hazy orangey color smell of bananas and cloves....tastes great. mouthfeel crisp and well carbonated...more crisp than the regular hefeweiss due to filtering...this is becoming my favorite brewery....this is an awesome beer. all their beers are great and have a similar taste. glad i tried it, it is a bit pricey though, but worth it."

"O: I still enjoy the hefeweizen more, but this is no slouch. Really an enjoyable pint. Definitely will drink this again come summer time."
"O: Typical wiessbier flavour but more lager like. A very sound but unremarkable beer."
""
"O: I really like this beer - very delicious and a great example of the the style. Very sessionable, I could literally drink this beer all afternoon evening and not tire of it. What a ""light"" beer should have been in America - a slightly lighter version of something great."
""
""
"Appearance is a crystal clear straw color with a big billow head on top. The scents are of bread and lemon and clove, with a slight alcohol scent too, but a bit on the weak side. The taste is banana and clove, a touch of floral/grassy flavor, with a slight bubble-gum sweetness. Carbonation is high. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbeir is one of my all-time favorites, so I can't help but compare the two. Kristal falls a bit short of its cloudy brother - the smell and taste just seem more muted (maybe an older bottle?) - but is still very good."
""
"My first kristall Weiss. Strange having that wheat beer taste in a crystal clear beer. Good though. Very good."
""
""
"O - This certainly tastes like it was made. A filtered Hefe could not be any better, but I will stick with the original or the dark version. If you prefer a very light brew (perhaps progressing from the Bud Light, Miller genre) this is for you."
""
""
"An OK Weissbeir, but too much carbonation for my tastes."
"Hard to find fault with this as an example of the style, though I still strongly prefer unfiltered wheat beers..."
""
"O- I would imagine that this is the gold standard for the style. Nice, light and bready-like a much milder hefe weizen. Good beer overall."
""
"O- i do like this beer, but i find i rarely purchase it, i prefer the hefeweizen, and this is slightly less flavorful. still damn good though."
""
""
"The body is light and crisp with appropriate carbonation. Light and enjoyable. Overall a nice one to have. One doesn't really go wrong grabbing a beer from Weihenstephan; especially with their reasonable pricing."

"Overall Impression- While not being able to compare this beer or this style of beer with anything I've ever had before, I enjoyed this tons! It had a great banana flavor with a light and easy going mouthfeel for the entire time. Will be looking out for many other in this style again! Would suggest if your looking for a refreshing beer to start your night with."

"O- my first for this style and i enjoyed it alot. will try to seek out others to compare to. a very solid beer i would love to have around all year."

"O - Overall this stuff was rather tasty. Glad I finally got to try this style. Its pretty good, would buy it again for the price and would love to try this stuff legitimately fresh from Germany."
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. I prefer the unfiltered."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: very tasty brew. easy drinking with plenty of fruit presence. wouldnt hate to come across more of these in the future."
"o - Overall I thought this was a good beer and I enjoyed it. It isn't my favorite Weihenstephaner beer, but for the style it was exactly what I was expecting. A good beer I'd certainly have agan, though personally I'd get their classic hefeweizen over this."
"Overall I'm glad I finally decided to pick up this style. It is slightly different but no worse than the non filtered version. I would prefer this with a big burger as it seems to not fill you up as much."
"Finish-Wheat, sour citrus notes, excellent, certainly my favorite wheat beer out of several tasted by far"
"Flavor is also distinct and light but still yeasty and spicy; coriander and clove are in there with the wheat, mildly sweet malt, and mostly banana amongst the fruits. Finish is very clean, carbonation is lively, goes down easy. An exceptionally quenching brew but a bit less interesting than the original hefe. Probably wouldn’t buy this one all that often; the standard is light and refreshing enough for me with a bigger and better taste and aroma."
"500 ml bottle. Pours clear golden with a huge, foamy, white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of yeast, wheat malt, cloves and banana. Light, creamy body. Wheat malt, yeast, a lot of cloves, banana and some bubble gum fill the mouth. Medium, spicy finish. All attributes of good Hefeweizen are present in this brew except hefe in the bottle."
"O-Pretty good beer here. There beers are perfect examples of what the style should be. Really setting the benchmark."
"O - A very nice refreshing beer that can be enjoyed at any occasion. Not as full on in flavour as the Hefe but very nice nevertheless."
"Very similar to their Hefeweizen, just a bit more subdued in the flavors and nose. Still quite enjoyable overall."
"O: Very clean flavors throughout. I do enjoy this but I think I do care for the original more."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. It's hard to go wrong with anything Weihenstephaner offering. This is no exception."
"This has tons of subtle character and is basically the definition of the style. I love it and would highly recommend this."
"I can't quite put my finger on it, but I didn't care much for this beer. It's ok with all the scores, but it did nothing for me. I think it was the slightly watered down finish that brought the overall score down."
"overall i'm enjoying the hell out of this beer. maybe it's because i haven't had one in a few days and so my perception is distorted, maybe it's because i was just in the mood for a lighter beer, or maybe it's simply because this is a great brew. there's a certain 'the whole being more than the sum of its parts' quality to it. drinks very easily. perfect for those occasions where you're in the mood for something lighter, crisper, and yet still very flavorful."
"This is so drinkable I'm kicking myself for not buying more."
"O - wow this is definitely one of my favorite beers by these guys and i wish it was available all the time (but i guess the fact it isn't just adds to it)."
"Overall, I would want to try more beers in this style, but I really was enjoying this one. I would drink it more, and I definitely will want to compare this to their Hefeweissbier someday."
"Taste- A very good light crisp clean beer for 5% I really enjoy all of Weihenstephaners offerings and cant beat the $ point."
"O: I'll need to go back to this one and give it another shot to be more fair. From what I could tell, it's a very good beer in its style but I think I still prefer the Tucher Kristall."
"An outstanding example as I would expect from Weihenstephaner. Not overpowering on the clove which is usually what kills most beers of similar styles for me."
"Very agreeable. Tasty yet light. Went well with prosciutto and pineapple pizza. ""Summer ales"" step aside – kristallweiss is here."
"Overall: This is the lighter alternative to the standard Hefeweizen and a kindred spirit to the American Pale Wheat Ale style. Light wheat elements and pleasing overall character makes for excellent drinkability. Still, something inside me is saying ""they filtered the good stuff out", but that is because their Hefeweizen is nothing short of amazing. This is good, however, and a solid choice for a summer session beer."
"A solid german wheat beer, though the clarity is quite impressive. Not quite as tasty or aromatic as the standard weihenstephaner hefeweissbier, but quite good anyways."
"O: I’m glad that there are two distinct styles for filtered and unfiltered hefe’s; they really aren’t in the same league. I would definitely prefer the yeast tastes that I got from Weihenstephaners unfiltered offering every time. This is a still a good beer, though; I especially like how drinkable it is (which would not have been possible if the yeasts were not muted). This isn’t really a style that I’ll be too keen to explore, though, due to the large number of excellent hefeweizens out there. These shining, filtered beauties do have their place, however – what’s a better German party beer than this?"
"This was great for the summer. It was very sessionable with only 5.4% alcohol."
"Tastes, not surprisingly, like a very nice hefeweizen. I haven't had any other kristalweizens but I would certainly recommend this one to anyone looking to try one for the first time."
"Overall-I prefer a hefeweizen. However, this was definitely alot less filling and very very easy to drink. This is the only beer I've had of this style, but I can't imagine one being much better."
"O - Overall a fine beer, but not nearly on the level of some other Weihenstephan beers."
"Overall a decently tasty ale. The sweetness was a bit offsetting."
"Overall: Nice brew, would drink this one again. Bit more bitter than most in the style"
"Drinkability: Very good stuff. Having never had kristalweizen before, color this hefeweizen lover impressed."
"Overall a solid beer. Good for if you want. A bit of that hefe taste but a bit more refreshing for the hot days."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a huge 3 inch stark white head that fades to a small puffy cap. Nice rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of wheat, spices, and slight banana. Taste is of wheat, spices, and a subtle banana flavor. There is a nice spice aftertaste with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer from the world's oldest brewery."
"Perfectly clear, a delicate pale yellow with a thin, white head. Huge punch of banana pancakes leads the aroma, with some solvent notes, a twist of lemon, cinnamon, and clove in tow. Judging from the smell it would be equally at home on the Christmas dinner table as it would be on a beach in the South Pacific. The flavor matches the aroma's powerful banana and clove profile, and adds to it a note of refreshing pineapple, making this at once tropical and Germanic. Smooth and lush with a full, fresh bread finish; bitterness is low, but it is balanced by good attenuation, spice, and a faint, fruity tartness. Very nice - full flavored like a hefe, crisp like a kölsch."
"Pours a clean golden yellow color with cap of frothy white bubbles. Scent is Fantastic and best described as a blend of white bread and mineral waters - not terribly exciting to read I'm sure but great none the less. Taste mimics scent. Fresh yeasty white bread, light hints of white pepper, clove, mineral water and banana. Lighter side of medium bodied, light creaminess and good carbonation. Very nice presentation of style - enjoy how the filtration moderates the yeast and allows notes of grain and water to stand out."
"O: Enjoyable, but a little less satisfaction drinking this one in contrast to the Hefe for me. While it has the mineral quality, and balance, it lacks as much clove, and malt body of the Hefe. Likely it is just the style that is not as enjoyable to me, though I rarely see Kristalweizen's on the shelf either, and this being likely the epitome of the style, may just not be for me personally."
"Drinkability is high. A tasty summer quaffer, the dialed back esters crank the sessionability up a notch regarding palate fatigue and quenchability."
"Pours a deep golden straw color with a huge fluffy white head that sticks itself to most of the glass. Endless carb. streams come from the bottom of the glass. Smells of clove and spicy wheat malt along with hints of sweet malt and banana. Taste is light and refreshing with lots of clove and spicy wheat malt. Lemon, sweet bready malt and banana play a supporting role as well. Creamy firm mouthfeel, medium body and an ample amount of carbonation. Great light summer type beer."
"Refreshing drink, I appreciate it, but it's probably not a favorite style for so I can't rank it much higher personally."
"Overall: Definitely a good change of pace and a good transition beer."
"O - Delicious as expected from a Weihenstephaner. Refreshing and delicious"
"O - My first kristalweizen, and I have to say I'm a fan. A little less yeast flavor than its 'mit hefe' counterparts, but still delicious."
"This brew pours out as a clean and clear looking yellow color. The head was fluffy and had a pretty good retention. The smell had a pilsner-ish aroma, a little earthy too. The taste was pretty good, some malts and a hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side and had a crisp feel to it. Overall not a bad brew, worth trying."
"D-Never have been a fan of the German weissbiers, and this is no exception. Although they're not my favorite, I can always appreciate a well-crafted brew."
"Overall, I like this beer well enough but the drinkability just isn't quite there for me. It tastes fine and has a great feel but it just isn't something I picture myself reaching for very often."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and the flavor is great. Overall, I thought this was very enjoyable beer. It is refreshing, and great for a hot day. This is my first beer of this style, but I can't wait to try another."
"Drinkability: Light body, moderately low ABV, good flavors that aren't overwhelming with a sweet and spicy touch with just a hint of bitterness, this beer begs to be drank all day long. It's really a great summer beer and I'm kind of bummed that I've waited this long to try it, but when it's 92 and humid outside, this is a great way to go."
"O: As mentioned early on, my first (as I recall) of the style. Embarrassing as that is, the fact that this so damn tasty and drinkable only compounds the error of my neglect. As quickly as mine disappeared, S's was gone twice as fast. It has been declared worthy. Now bring on some summer, weatherman..."
"If I could buy the world a Coke... it would actually be a German wheat beer, and why not this one? If the Germans know one thing about brewing it's how to make a beer that is appealing to just about anyone and infinitely drinkable with breakfast, lunch, dinner (or any time in between). This is a full-flavoured but easy drinking beer perfect for those hot, dog days of summer. Like every Weihenstephaner offering, it get's my recommendation."
"This is a very good beer and a great quencher for a summer day. The flavor could be a little better perhaps, but it's still quite nice. I'd get it again for sure. Recommended."
"O - Nice example of the style, easily one of the best. Not as harsh as some other kristal beers but still not exactly comforting."
"""-and so most gastropods stomachs aren't technically their FOOT as the latin name would connote"" Oh shit, he is still going, I dont know what is worse, a memorable date for the wrong reasons or a forgetable date for the right reasons. ""Check please."""
"Overall: Very good. I would more likely go for other styles by Weihenstephaner, but I could see myself getting this again."
"Bought a 500ml bottle and poured it into my wheat beer glass at a 55 degree serving. Pours out very clear straw color with plenty of carbonation and a rich frothy white head that lingers and laces, truly beautiful. Smells of rich banana bread and apricots and fruity esters. The taste is of rich malts, banana, apricot, and bread like a great wheat beer should. Mouthfeel is bubbly, cloying and has a balance of wet/dry feel. Overall this is an excellent Kristalweizen. Its beauty is one to behold drinkability is high and overall a world class in its style."
"I like to let it sit a bit to allow some of the carbonation to pass. The overall mouth feel coupled with the aroma equates to one of my all time favorite beers. It is almost close to perfection."
"Kristall Weissbier is apparently one of the signature brews of Weihenstephaner ... no doubt this is an interesting even great brew, however, personally I prefer the unfiltered version of wheat beers ..."
"Pours a bright crystal clear golden color with a big thick soapy frothy head which gives way to skim and leaves lines of lace. The aroma is of bananas clove and yeast, a nice inviting but not over powering aroma. The taste is much like a hef it is yeasty with nice notes of banana and clove. Not as roasty and smoky as a hef. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a very good beer and very easy drink. You could easily make it a session beer."
"D. Another solid beer from Weihenstephan."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with high carbonation. Good for style I would imagine, but still not the most pleasing to me. Still, pretty good. Overall, a nicely crafted beer. Softer and more subtle than their hefeweizen (by design), but still quite nice."
"D-Overall this was a good beer. Nothing really special about it. Would drnk again but wouldn't pay for again. This company makes many more beers that are better."
"poured from bottle into pilsner glass. poured a clear gold color so you could see all the bubbles and had a three finger head that lasted for some time. with the smell i picked up on bananna bread, yeast, and slight wheat and spice. tasted bananna up front, yeast all the way thru with slight spice on the end. mouth feel was bubbly like champaign. overall a good beer and a easy drinker."
"O - Prefer the heffe but this is still a great drop."
"overall this beer is drinkable as a session beer."
"The taste is top notch for this style. It is like a Heffe lighter on the spice. Balancing more banana than clove. Fruity. Hints of pear and melon. Hints of vanilla and a touch of citrus like orange peel. Clove takes a backseat as more sublte. Nice light, crisp, refreshing body with a rich, creamy, slightly grainy edge and nice carbonation effect. Overall, may be my favorite wheat beer. I'm not the biggest fan of cloves and love bananas so take my judgement with that grain of salt. Very well done beer."
"Maybe the appearance and nose are deceiving, but this is a delicious and notably fine wheat beer. High marks!"
"Pours a very light golden yellow, very easy to see through. Big fluffy pure white head. Nice lacing and retention. Aroma of wheat and banana, light. Nice refreshing taste. Very light version of the hefe. Crisp wheat and banana flavor, less pronounced than the hefe, spices are very light as well. Nice sweetness. Sessionable."
"O: flavors are still there, this is what the germans should have meant light beer to be."
"First time trying this sub-style of weissbier. Previous reviewer hit it on the head, Good and simple. Nice color, good head, pleasant aromas and clean taste. I prefer a traditional Weiss over this, but I'm really enjoying the difference found here. Very thirst quenching and with the abv, I could hang and watch the Giants with a six of these...I miss football season..."
"O (D) - very drinkable, easy to enjoy beer."
"This is a drinkable, but leaves an undesirable minerally aftertaste."
"This beer pours a clear pale golden color with a froth white foam on the surface. The nose is a combination of clove, banana and brown sugar sweetness that can only be found in this brewery's wheat beers. The taste is best described as hefeweizen light. There is that wheat flavor with the sweetness coming from the floral yeast, but it's much more subtle on the palate than would be expected. The mouthfeel is much too thin for my liking, but then again I'm a hater on anything that's too thin, but overall this is a quite enjoyable brew. I can easily see how this could be the pinnacle of it's style."
"Hugely enjoyable. Love it."

"A comment on the style, the extra carbonation add to the flavor of the beer."
"D - This is definitely a late spring and summer beer with great taste. It's very well balanced and will only leave you wanting for more."
"d- very drinjable. So light my taste was gone in no time."
"Pours a golden yellow. Lots of white head. Very well carbonated. Smells wheaty and sweet. A very interesting yeasty aroma. Tastes sweet and strongly of yeast. There is a nice combo of light fruits and sweet almost floral flavours. A solid mouthfeel and the high carbonation matches the beer nicely. Vry drinkable as i would expect for the style"
"16.9oz bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours a crystal-clear straw-yellow body with nearly two inches of rather persistent white head. Fruity, nutty and spicy aroma. Banana, lemon, nut, and clove bombard the palate leaving a fairly dry and clean finish with a hint of nut. Light bodied with effervescent carbonation. A super easy drinker and it went away too quickly. Excellent."
"Pours a ""crystal"" clear golden blonde, with a thick, retentive foam. Aromas of wheat and pilsner malts project from the foam, but die along with it. Moderate body for such a clear weissbier, just a hint of spice, with a light creamy wheat swallow, and a mild, wet aftertaste. ""Kristal"" fits the picture, and this brew is true to the style to the letter. Worthy of a go, if this is your thing, but I personally prefer brews to be a little darker and with some more character. Personal feelings excluded from ratings, of course."
"Crisp and refreshing, amazingly drinkable with medium amount of carbonation; this is another fantastic beer offered up by Weheinstephaner - but I think I will stick with the unfiltered stuff."
"D - Very drinkable.Very refreshing, An outstanding version of the style. This is my favorite German brewer. Epic stuff. Nonetheless...I prefer a Hefeweizen over the Kristal...just something missing without the yeasty haze and chewiness. However...a great gateway for a BMCer into the Germans."
"The bottle says ""crystal clear"" and boy do they mean it. This beer pours a perfectly clear, apple juice like golden yellow with a two finger, quickly dissipating head. The aromas aren't very present whatsoever, and certainly not when compared to their other beers. There is some light yeast and also this aroma reminiscent of sparkling soda. The flavor boasts the rich and sweet yeast similar to their Hefe but in a dialed down manner. It is very, very light in body and drinks very well. It's almost a watered down and lighter version of their Hefe which makes it one of the most drinkable and sessionable beers around. All in all, this is yet another good beer from Weihenstephaner."
"Drinkability is good, but I prefer the unfiltered brethren of this puppy."
"Loved drinking this and it went down quite easy. A beer I'll have to remember to pick up again in the spring."
"Poured about 2/3 of the bottle into my perfect pour glass with 3 fingers of white fluff capping it. The nose is bready with honey and some banana. The taste, really good. Bready with honey like the aroma but with less banana and more clove. The body is a bit on the lighter side. Aftertaste is fairly smooth with a slight citrus twinge that lingers. It does a good job of keeping its carbonation and making you want more. This is a definite repeat."
"D - Inredibly drinkable and refreshing. Not as good as its unfiltered brethren but still pretty tasty. Weihenstaphaner just can't seem to make a bad product."
"This is a softer version of their original Hefeweizen which filtration process eases its conspicuous fruity characteristic while supersedes with more clear and fresh and malt to overpower anyway still good and high drinkable."
"Verdict: Light, clean subtle flavor and character. It does well and the ingredients are pure but the result is not something I personally can connect with. I know there are Kristalweizen fans out there which is why I will recommend the beer anyways, as it does well in maintaining complex flavors despite losing much of the fine details in the filtration procedure. Plus if the drinker specifically enjoys filtered beer with light body and character, there is probably few better attempts at getting it right than this beer here. Worth a shot to most to see if it hits the spot, but I'll stick with the Weissbier any day! B+ (3.9)"
"Drinkability - Could drink this all night. Not heavy, and complex enough to keep me coming back for more."
"D - very easy drinking and an all round enjoyable beer that rightfully stands alongside other great Weihenstephaner beers. If they were more affordable, I might never touch another brewer's produce."
"D: Pretty much tastes like a filtered, watered down hefeweizen. I'd probably take the full version over this style. Still, for what it is, this is damn good."
"Drinkability is similar, but for different reasons. They contrast each other well."
"I bought this beer for no other reason than it's claim to be made by the world's oldest brewery. However, now that I've had it, I would definitely purchase this again, especially the next time I have guests who are not as adventuresome in their beer tastes. Perhaps the beltway to describe this beer is that, it is a beer which beer aficionados and casual beer drinkers can both enjoy."
"Drawing a full sip reveals more pepper accents over a solid cereal grain base. Generous, smooth carbonation adds some depth to this straight-ahead wheat beer, with just enough hop bitterness in the end game to make it interesting. Tasty and well presented, this would be in good company with planked whitefish, oysters Rockefeller or scallop scampi."
"D - Falls short of its magnificent unfiltered brother, yet another tick for the boys at Weihenstephaner."
"D - It is a tasty beer but just seems lacking compared to a hefeweizen. But it is not a hefeweizen so I think it is spot on for the style. I wouldn't hesitate to have it again."
"D: Considering the pleasant mouthfeel, mild (at least in comparison to your average beer with a high score on here: stout, IPA, sour, etc.) flavor, and refreshment factor, this is extremely drinkable. Newcomers to craft beer should be able to handle this one with no problem."
" In the end... the feel becomes much too relaxed, i would have to say flat, but way to quick. The jazzy, light feel just doesn't keep up, and the malt becomes a bit to slick and heavy. Otherwise, a really nice experience."
"D-This is a super drinkable beer. I only have one, but I could see me drinking a few in a row, especially on a hot day."
"D: Everything I wanted and expected from the style. Clean, refreshing and easy drinking. This sucker goes down very easy."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color weizen with a huge pure white foamy head with good retention and excellent lacing. Aroma of light banana ester and light sweet wheat malt note is pleasant enough. Taste is dominated by banana ester with a light wheat malt backbone and medium sweetness. Body is a bit light with great carbonation. Refreshing and well brewed though not as tasty as its bigger cousin."
"Like it. a go to beer for something on the lighter side. at 5% Ill drink this all night if needed."
"Very drinkable beer. Still loving all the beers from this brewery."
"All in all, a big time winner from a brewery which seemingly does no wrong."
"This bottle was obtained from Jacob's corner at Changi Village; generally not too easy to find Weihenstephaners in Singapore unless it is the Oktoberfest season."
" tall white head. Smells of the traditional clove and banana, of course not as much of a yeast smell as the Hefe. Flavor is a little less complesx than the hefe, it retains the same elements of clove and banana, I can taste a little more hops in this than I recall in the Hefe. Mouthfeel is great, very clean and refreshing. Overall, a very drinkable beer. I think personal preference would decide what you may like more this or the hefe. This will certainly be a beer that I share with friends in the future to get them more interested in craft beer."
"I love the light, fizzy mouthfeel. Drinkability is good. This would be a nice session beer for a hefe lover."
"Drinkability: Easily a very good hefe, bubbly on the palate but smooth and enjoyable."
"D - As stated before this beer is delicious. I would have it very often."
"Picked up at a corner store somewhere between San Franciso and Los Angeles. I haven't had a kristalweizen before, and I've liked other beers from Weihenstephaner, so figured it would be a good chance to try this out. Pours a pale orange colour with huge white head. Smells of clove and banana. Flavour has some tartness to it, yet it remains sweet. Very high carbonation level, as evidenced by the slight gushing after opening. A nice easy drinking beer."
"D - Good beer that would be a refreshing summer thirst quencher. Maybe lighter in mouthfeel than a standard hefe but all the flavor and aroma still remain."
"Pretty drinkable overall. Warms me up with the spices - low ABV. Good summery beer. It is a clear wheat beer."
"A great beer overall. I definitely need to do a side by side compare and contrast session with this and the Hefeweissbier. Weihenstephaner just might be the best brewery in Germany."
"D: Super easy drinking and plenty of flavor. For the price this could easily be an every day drinker in the summer."
"Verdict: Even at $2.79/bottle, not truly worth it unless you want to drink a lot of beer on a hot day."
"D: This is flavorful, light, and easy on the stomach. Nice."
"Poured a huge head which took forever to dissipate. Straw yellow in color. I'm not getting quite the same flavors others describe. I can get the citrus, the banana totally escapes me. And honestly to me there's some smoky or bacony aspects to this. Not unpleasant at all, I pretty much enjoyed the latter descriptors, and a pretty unique beer. B+ to me."
"This beer pours a bold, clear, dark yellow color with thick foam that lead to lacing that stayed until the end. The aroma begins with citrus and includes hints of vanilla and banana. It's flavor is well balanced starting with banana and lemons giving way to oranges and dough as it warms. It has a medium mouthfeel with good carbonation and is very smooth. Weihenstephaner Kristall Weissbier is filling, no more than two or three. It's a perfect match for sourdough pretzel chunks. Highly recommended!!"
"D: i love weihenstephaner and once again they did not disappoint despite my high expectations...it would be a tough call between this and their hefeweissbier, both are fantastic"
"Excellent summer beer. Highly drinkable and great for the style."
"Drinkability: Very good with a meal (slow cooked cabbage and noodles with paprika, onions, and sour cream), and I think it would be very good all by itself. An overall very good beer."
"Overall, a very nice session beer, would go well before BBQ food on a summer's day."
"Always worth point out the price point on the beer in question. 16.9 oz at 2.99. That works out to 12.73 for a 6 pack. Or 11.89 if they were in 11.2oz bottles. Not a bad price really. You factor in that expected marginal discount and you might very well in 11.2 oz bottles see this for 9.99 which imo would make it a great deal. Marketing departments, I'm doing the work for you!"
"Superb in it's drinkability, dare I say even more so than the hefeweizen. I wish summer was starting so I could buy a case of this."
"MF/D- Very crisp and light on the palate. Carbonation level is very good. Could drink this a lot more if CT would carry it."
"A beer for a warm summers day. Compared to the hefe big brother it however has less smell, taste and body, sampled at beer tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"From the 25 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on September 19, 2010. It pours golden yellow with a full two-icnh foamy white head that simmers down to about a quarter-inch and hangs around. The aroma is bold with wheat, yeast, and just a small note of hops. The taste also has a toasted wheatiness to it with some wholesome malts and a spirited but light hoppy ending. A very nice beer."
"D - I could drink this stuff from dusk till dawn no problem."
"Cheers!"
"This is a really good Kristalweizen, as you might expect from one of the world's best breweries. That being said, it only confirms my distaste for the style, because even when done at its best, it just isn't for me. A tamer and less interesting version of their hefeweizen, which is a beer to die for. Similar cloves and bananas in the taste and smell to the hefe, but not nearly as pronounced. Quite refreshing. You could drink this one all day, but you'll probably get bored after one or two. A brilliant version of a style that I just don't care for at all."
"Pours a a clear gold with a constant upward stream of fine white bubbles and an extremely long lasting, frumpy, pure white head. Aromas are ordinary for the style: bananas, cloves, and yeast. Flavors are good and consistent with the aromas. What stands out about this beer is the mouthfeel. It's difficult to get a sense of its body because it is hypercarbonated to the point that it erupts in plumes of foam the moment that it touches the tongue. The overall effect is of a beautiful looking beer that is interesting to taste but that I wish would stand still for a moment so that my palate could peg it down."
"Taste is decent', it's a bit yeasty and sharp for me but quite tasty. If you like the banana yeastiness of their Hefeweissbier you'll like this."
"D: Excellent summer quaffer."
"This is a very solid beer, light but lacking nothing, and given how easily it drinks, how enticing the flavor is, and the low alcohol level, I can't give this anything but a perfect score for drinkability. Another fine beer from one of Germany's best."
"Poured from bottle into weizen glass. Appearance was nice and golden. Very fluffy white head. Low IBU beer, around 16 I believe. Very good taste and nice and smooth. Good session beer at 5.4% ABV. Very light beer and would go well with seafood or a lot of other light dishes."
"Crystal clear and gold with a fluffy, bright white head. Lots of carbonation is apparent in the body. Clumpy lacing. Sweet aromas of ripe mashed bananas, wheat crackers, lemony with a bit of clove. Lemon zest up front in the flavour, more sweet bananas, followed by drying wheat and spice. Light to medium bodied with perhaps a bit more carbonation than needed. Very refreshing and quite tasty."
"The taste is clove and bananas. The malts and yeast notes are secondary, but definately there. I also get some light pineapple and citrus notes. Light bodied and well carbonated, creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"the nose and palate of a hef and the quality of the gritty helles in body. straw color and crystal clear. note of banana and clove with a light weight that brings forth a hop wheat husk quality that you find in nice wheat beers. not creamy at all. mild caliber wheat with a lager feel. although when compared to hef light and helles not as bright. quite a bit drier in quality too."
"D - weird drinking a 'hefe' without the killer haze. like a nice light version of the common style, drinkable and refreshing."
"Poured a clean, deep golden, with a substantial head which settled down to a half inch layer of foam. Not much lacing in evidence. Smell is pleasant and restrained. Classic notes of clove and banana are faintly detectable. The aroma also features a malty wheat presence, and grainy/maize notes which are quite good. Taste is subtle, but good, featuring classic weizen aspects. Mouthfeel is decent, if a bit thin. Overall, a very drinkable beer."
"M/D: Light, crisp, and smooth with a healthy dose of carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing. A bit too heavy on the banana, I wish it had some citrus or something else to give it some depth."
"Weihenstephaner delivers as usual. I love American Craft, but sometimes nothing beats the mastery of the Old World's finest. When in the mood for a mild beer that won't bore you, grab one of these."
"Toasted wheat malt up front. Grainy wheat bread notes follow. Banana and clove flavors mid-palate. Spicy, peppery [hop] accents into the yeasty, bready, banana-aftertaste finish. Moderate body with a spritzy, light, refreshing feel. Not as creamy and thick as it's unfiltered cousin. Still tastes good, but I prefer the classic, cloudy weizen."
"MD- This is as creamy as the Hefe and just as easy drinking. This is an all around fantastic beer."
"Light, easy to drink. A bit too estery for me maybe. Pretty decent beer though and worth trying for fans of lighter wheat beers."
"Defiantly drink again. Always in season and never a bad pairing"
"Still, a nice beer and a benchmark in the style. Low in alcohol so you can drink many, but not the lawn mower beer I had hoped for. Zatec still holds the title for me in that role."
"Drinkability: A pretty good beer, but a bit too heavy on the yeast. I may have gotten a bad bottle, so I would be willing to try this again."
"D- nice on a hot day. Not something I would drink while im out though."
"D: Another winner from Weihenstephaner. I was a bit apprehensive about a filtered version of such a yeast-forward beer, but this is subtle, refreshing, and enjoyable."
"My first Weihenstephaner in my 5 pack.... Great start !!"
"Not my cup of tea--this beer has no flaws but is otherwise very pedestrian."
"Not a beer to let sit too long. At a relatively warm temp, the last few sips reveal more of that bubblegum flavor mentioned here and there. Allspice, too. Loses the refreshing factor, for sure. Definitely best fairly cool. Definitely tasty and would be great with warm rolls and an earthy, peppery salad."
"D: Easily drinkable and a great beer. Just scaled-down relative to its bigger brother."
"Tried this, based on the recommendation of the authors of Naked Pint (highly recommended). As I expected, this is basically like a lighter (less intense) version of a Hefe. It's perfect for those times that you want something like a hefe but with less spiciness. It's more carbonated, more crisp than a crisp. Would be an excellent beer with meals and on hot summer days."
"D- Very refreshing and light. This is an easy drinker. Great for a summer day."
"Weihenstephaner Kristall Weissbier is a fine example of the style...it is one refreshing thrust quenching brew."
"Good beer."
"There is a little more carbonation than I would like, as it interferes with the flavor. I find this very refreshing and perfect for a hot day. Great for the summer."
"D: This is the only kristallweissbier in my store of 1100 brews, so I had to give it a try. not to discredit the style at all, but I think I will be sticking to my hefe's, as they have a much broader flavor profile, more vitamins, and a much better mouthfeel due to the yeast."
"M&D- A nice spritzy mouthfeel from the carb when first poured although that got lost as this warmed to almost nothing. Light bodied and refreshing. I suggest drinking this as cold as possible to keep the crispness on the tounge. This gets dull in feel with warmth, but the fruits come out a bit more. I can and will drink this all day someday and maybe stretch it into a weekend. Good stuff and light in alcohol too."
"D: The beer is very refreshing and easy to drink; it's both crisp and thirst quenching."
"the more muddled taste of Hefeweizens."
"D: I love how the bubblegum aroma grows as this brew warms in the glass. This is a good beir, more than likely better left unfiltered, but for the newbies out there that might be put off by sediment und yeastiness; this is a good platform to leap from. A good beir! Weihenstephaner is the Scheiße!!!"
"D- Hugely sessionable. These beers make me want to go sit outside."
"Medium to thin body, with a grainy mouthfeel, due in part to the rough carbonation. It really adds to the flavor profile, IMO. Superbly drinkable."
"A very nice, refreshing beer. Can see this being a great summer beer for me."
"D: A very-easy drinking beer, and would be excellent on a hot day. Flavors aren't as powerful as with some other weizens I've had, but in a way this works to an advantage of sorts."
"Light bodied and carbonated. It makes it very easy drinking, but that differs a bit from drinkability. I could see how one could put many of these down if they were available to them. My only drawback to this beer is...why drink this style at all? The flavors that I enjoy in this are found in more robust versions, so why do this? Probably pairs great with food, and would never get in the way of stronger flavors while cleaning the palate. I encourage people to try this, just because it is very good, but I don't know when I'll revisit again."
"D- Lighter and crisper than its hazier brother, this is a highly sessionable beer. Warm weather and/or sausage and sauerkraut are recommended."
"D- A surprisingly complex and enjoyable beer. Drinks nicely and is most definitely worth a try."
"Who needs the yeast?"
"I've always preferred hefs over kristall but I won't let that prejudice my opinion. This is very good. If you didn't know, these folks really know how to brew a weizen; better than most. Bananas, clove, spice, bit of citrus. Perfectly carbonated. A little light on the body for my tastes but thats a very minor thing compared to all the goodness in this beer. Awesome stuff."
"Notes: Really nice beer, but I would probably just go for their normal Hefe. That isn't a slam on this beer as the normal Hefe is amazing and this is a lot like it. I guess if you wanted a clean/lighter version go for this."
"O: The lack of suspended yeast [mildly] impacts the body, but never the flavor. This one exceeded my expectations in almost every way as I thought this would just be a filtered hefe, but it is more than that. This is the first German wheat I've had that I would truly designate as a ""clove bomb"". If you love clove, you gotta try this beer."
"Pours a very clear yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is biscuit malt with some banana and bubble gum. The flavor is more of the same, with pronounced banana, bubble gum and citrus notes. A very flavorful beer. The mouthfeel is medium and is very soft. The carbonation is low-medium."
"D: wonderful although i like my weizen beers a bit cloudy but it is tasty. and highly drinkable. great with a meal cleanses the pallet"
"D-very refreshing. good beer with food."
"Overall: Weihenstephaner's unfiltered weissbier is one of the best of that style I've ever had. The kristall still has much of its flavor, however, it is a bit lighter."
"D- This beer defines drinkability. It does down so smooth..."
"if you like weissbiers, be sure to get this."
"D- give me the unfiltered version any day. i dont think id buy it like this again."
"Value: Excellent. I wonder how they price these so low. I think I paid around $3.00 for a big bottle."
"D: Very drinkable, would definitely have another (in fact, I wish I had another *to* drink)."
"Drinkability: About as clean a beer as I have ever had. What a nice refreshing and crisp taste. I could have several especially in warmer weather. Way easy to to drink."
"D - Very very drinkable. Weihenstephaner is one of the most excellent."
"A great beer with lots of really nice flavour. I prefer the hefeweizen but this is still something special."
"D- Could enjoy these all night, a top session beer for sure."
"D: I've really been missing out with these German wheat ales. Such an easy drinking and flavorful beer."
"Drinkability- Another fine beer from a fine brewery, after almost 1000 years I would hope this brewery knew what they were doing, and they most certainly have perfected their beers. I've never been disappointed by a beer from this brewery yet!"
"Drinkability: this beer is a pleasure to imbibe. It's not complex or challenging; it's simply an extremely tasty well-crafted beer."
"Too expensive ($5) per bottle to warrant a return."
"M/D-highly carbonated with a very light clean body yet has a hint of a creamy finish overall this beer is highly drinkable and is delicious, crisp, and very refreshing"
"I could see this one going great with fish, chicken or a vegetarian dish, but it would just as well make a great session brew and seems to be a good one for just about any mood unless one really needs something huge or dark."
"Going to update this the next time I have one warm."
"Quite drinkable. This one could be a pounder."
"Smells like the first day of summer. Green apple, grass, lemon, and farmy must with the usual banana and clove phenols. At first sip light and fluffy malt caresses the palette. Banana milk and clove with a sugary swallow like a goodbye kiss. Ah, l'amoure."
"D - Absolutely nothing bad or even flawed about this beer, for how clean and low ABV drinkability is real high on this one. I wish this is what light beer was in this country."
"This beer is thin, easy drinking, light, finishes cleanly, has nice sweetness on the front and carries to the back with the wheat flavors. No hop bitterness or aftertaste at all. Drinkability is as high as a beer can beer. It is excellent."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a pale gold color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of mild bananas. Taste is good, bananas and spices well blended, very flavorful. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is an enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and the carbonation was almost perfect in the palate. An awesome beer to drink on a hot day for its refreshing qualities. A great alternative to the unfiltered hefeweizens on the market."
"D - The malt and hop balance of this beer is reminiscent of a nicely made German lager, but on top of that we have a world of wheat beer yeast character. There is a nice balance between banana and clove here with some creamy vanilla and spicy wheat thrown in to round things out. This is an excellent and very drinkable wheat beer with the added bonus that the lack of yeast prevents the gaseous side effects that the little buggers can have for some of us."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, light, and refreshing. Very good for the style..."
"The mouthfeel is nice an refreshing. This is a Hefeweizen for a summer Grillfest"
"Out of a 500ml bottle and into my Harpoon UFO weizen glass. Appears a clear straw yellow color with about an inch of fluffy, dense bone white foam. Nose and flavors consist of ripe bananas, cloves, sweet malt, bread, maybe a hint of lemon and apples. Light bodied and very clean with decent carbonation levels. Great drinkability. Worth tracking down."
"D - A very drinkable wheat beer which would be great for a hot day or not, creamy smooth and refreshing qualities. Lighter feel than that of a Hefe w/ all of the flavor of wheat - I find this to be very drinkable wheat - Prost!"
"Notes: This was my first Kristalweizen and I was very impressed with the bright clean flavor and good solid yeast flavor. There was much more yeast character than I was expecting in this crystal clear German wheat beer."
"Pours a straw color with a nice white head and a good amount of lacing as it goes down. The nose has a slight sweetness from the malt and hints of clove, banana, and bubblegum coming from the yeast. The taste is quite similar with the yeast's characteristics really shining through. Light body with good carbonation--this one is quite drinkable."
"A classic Kristalweizen. One of the best, without a doubt."
"D: Good, I like bolder beers so I would take a hefe over this one, that being said this one is solid."
"Here's hoping that it was a bad bottle because this is the first Weihenstephaner brew I haven't liked."
"As for my first kristalweizen, I was hoping for a bit more than what I expected, especially from the Weihenstephaner brewery. Maybe it's how all kristalweizens are, but I'll go the extra effort and go for the hefeweizen instead. I truly hope this was just a bad bottle or something."
"This is nicely carbonated and light bodied. Drinks very easily. This is another great beer from Weihenstephaner. Picked up at Friar Tuck Beverage in Springfield, IL."
"Second wheat beer of the night, and both have gone a little overboard in the carbonation department. Again, I know the carbonation is meant to be a little higher, but this is just a bit too much. That said, there's still a creaminess to the texture, and it's a refreshing beer that's easy to drink."
"It certainly has a lot of similarities to the regular hefeweizen version, but with the slightly toned down sweetness, and a heightened sharpness, it seemed more thirst quenching. This would certainly make an excellent summer beer."
"Moderately light body with fine carbonation."
"Overall the flavors in this beer are similar in profile but lesser in scope than the full-fledged hefeweizen, however both are absurdly drinkable. Worth a shot."
"D: A very good beer, owing mainly to the bigtime maltiness, although I miss the wheaty twang and estery fruit flavors the yeaast haze adds. It would be a good wheat beer for drinkers who don't like the perfumy esters of hefes and who like their malty beers."
"I poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a weizen glass. The beer pours crystal clear with a large white head. Cloves and bananas dominate the smell. The taste follows, there are also bubble gum notes. The beer is highly carbonated, light in body, and way to drinkable. IMO this and the better hefeweizen's are interchangeable."
"50 cl. bottle. Pours a kristal clear golden-yellow color with a fairly tall but, quickly diminishing fluffy white head, fair lacing. Aroma is grain, straw, wheat, yeast, and some light banana esters. Flavor is sweet malts, caramel, yeast, and a touch of spiciness. Light to medium bodied, fairly lively, sweet on the palate. Pretty good kristall, refreshing."
"I view this beer as a strong representative of the Kristalweizen style. Light and refreshing like some BMCs strive to be, but with some added subtleties that set it apart from the swill-du-jour."
"Drinkability is high. This is tops as far as filtered wheats go. I still prefer the flagship hefe."
"D-- drinkable but got a bit samey near the end of the beer. I thought it was pretty front forward in drinking, better in the beginning than in the end. Good beer for sitting on a balcony in the summer."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Light bodied and very crisp and clean."
"(D)- A plain and simple wheat beer, yet solidly made. This goes down smooth and crisp. Great on a summer day."
"MF&D - the beer feels almost like my homebrewed weizen. the carbonation is lacking a slight ammount, and the body is just a bit too thin. its not watery, by any means, but the beer should have a bit more slosh to it. either way the brew is great fun to drink and the low abv keeps em coming."
"This is a great beer to drink on a hot summer day. In addition, this is a good beer to wean the Bud fans onto real beer."
"Great beer that I recieved in a beer of the month package. Will definitely try again!"
"Very good Weissbier, can't wait to try other from this brewery."
"D - can you say, ""lawn mower beer""? I could drink this by the liter."
"I'm maybe being a bit harsh by comparing this to the hefeweizen, because they're obviously meant to be different, but I just feel this can't escape the shadow of the bigger, better beer. This is probably more of a chugging beer than its big brother, but I just prefer the more full-flavoured one."
"Notes: Interesting but I like Hefes to be a bit thicker than this."
"A bit sweeter than anticipated on the taste but quite pleasant. More banana for the most part and with a long finish. Light background touch of cherry or grape rounds out the banana notes well. Quite smooth on the feel, carbonation is supportive but not overdone after the blowoff of gas on the initial pour. Has enough body and texture to keep things interesting, yet doesn't overwhelm with sweetness. Closes with a brief return of ripe banana. Drinks quite easily though 'may' become one sided as a session beer. Very nice brew, will purchase again."
"For a ""lighter"" wheat beer this one still packs a lot of great flavor and is very refreshing!"
"Overall the best kristalweizen I've had. One can't ever go wrong with these brewery's products."
"500ml bottle. Pours a perfectly clear gold with a large white head that settles soon after to a half-finger cap. Smells heavily of banana and tart wheat, with plenty of yeast character that hints at clove. The wheat dominates the taste, with light clove in the background; the banana is all but gone. None of the flavors are very strong. Light body with heavy carbonation. Crisp and refreshing, but reminiscent of a normal hefe that's been watered-down."
"A very nice beer for this time of year."
"a hell of a refreshing beer, this one is gone before you know it. think of it as a crisper hefeweizen, it's delicate, robust, and quenching all at the same time. this seems to be a spot on example of a style that seems to be oft neglected."
"Very drinkable and nearly as good as the Hefeweissbier, but the citrus in this one goes a lot further than it should."
"Weihenstephaner does it again, and no surprise there seeing as they are the oldest brewery in the world - they have had quite along time to perfect their craft, and perfect it they did. Definitely nice to compare to the traditional Hefeweizen and the Dunkel... which I conveniently have a pint of chilling on deck."
"drinkability is huge, just got out of the pool and this one hits the spot for sure, another killer beer from Weihenstephaner, haven't had a bad one yet and always can't wait for the next."
"500ml bottle served in my Weihenstephan weizen glass. Gusher upon opening. By the time I got it in the glass it poured a translucent pale gold with a four inch creamy, bright white head. Bands and heavy spots of lacing are exposed as the brew is consumed. Some banana and clove in the nose. Taste follows nose but flavors are very mild and somewhat watered down. Also get a little residual wheatiness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light, lively and a little watery. Not my favorite from Brauerei Weihenstephan, but this sure is an easy drinking brew on a hot day."
"Even in the summer, I'll take a nice fresh pilsener, or even a bold IPA, but keep the wheat to yourself."
"drinkability- the feel almost reminded me of drinking a becks or something similar. the taste was just not what i would hope for"
"overall - It's definitely not as complex or full bodied as its unfiltered brother, but this one was very satisfying nonetheless. Now I just wish I could find this one in my local beer stores. At least now I have an excuse to go to Zum Stammtish more often."
"A clear golden color with a huge fluffy white head that lasted quite a while. Aroma is yeasty,banana, clove,and citrus.Flavor is bready,yeasty,more of the Belgin yeast,clove,banana, grass,and grain.Crisp mouthfeel,high carbonation,light body. A good drinker on a nice Spring day,kind of like a spiced Lager."
"Poured a clear light gold color with a huge white head. Nose has smell of cloves and a slight wheat and funk. Taste is light, slightly malty with a hint of banana, smooth finish. Excellent drinkability, a good session beer. Good beer overall would recommend to anyone who desires the style."
"Drinkability.... one nice beer that would go well with a spicy meal or a meal with variety that demands a palate cleanser"
"Another great on from Weihenstephaner. The lower abv coupled by its refreshing character make this a great beer that I will seek out many more times."
"Another one I can check off as I try to review all that Weihenstepaner offers..."
"This beer is very clear and a light golden color. The head is quite airy and bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Not real exciting for the looks of things. The smell however is great - you can tell this is an old recipe traditional German beer. Boom - got some cloves with the first taste out the chute. Got some sweet malt and a hint of hops. Talk about well rounded. Maybe some fruit in there too ... like apples. Mouthfeel is smooth and isn't bitter but holds in the tastes and coats your mouth. As you drink it down the flavors change shape. Drinkability is very high."
"drinkability is high how could it not be with the taste and mouthfeel"
"Poured into a Hefeweizen glass; the enormous head filled the glass from foot to rim without my trying. All that foam released a subdued aroma of bananas and cloves, as you'd expect from a beer of this style. Once it settled back (about 5 minutes, still leaving a good two inches for the ride to the bottom of the glass), it revealed a lovely, shimmery beer with mild carbonation and mild wheat-beer flavor. This makes sense, since it's filtered. Ever so slightly bitter at the finish, with a light body and a fragrant, easy style. Mild and subdued are all over this beer, which is a nice change from more powerful (yet still very tasty) unfiltered wheat beers. If you know someone who is afraid of Hefeweizen, buy them a bottle. You'll have a convert on your hands in no time."
"Very refreshing and drinkable. Definately not nearly as exciting as a hefeweizen though!"
"D - I like the 500ml serving size, as this brew goes down quick and easy. It's been an afternoon of lighter brews in preparation for DLD parties, and this was the best of the bunch. I just wish this had a little more depth in the taste."
"Cracked this bottle open and it foamed all over the place! Quickly poured into large Hefe glass and watched the giant white head rise out of the pale yellow beer. The head was some what disappointing, it dissipated quickly and left almost no lacing. However the aroma made up for the lacking appearance. Bananas, strawberries and other ripe fruit make the aroma of this beer special. Light grassy and hay aromas also come through. The flavor is light and subtle. Bananas up front then some nice grassy hops then bananas make another appearance and ends with a grainy crisp aftertaste. This is a light bodied beer that has a nice hop and carbonation presence that makes it quite refreshing. This is the first Kristalweizen I have ever had so I do not have much to compare it to but I would say this is a pretty good beer. I will be buying more of this in the summer."
"Pours clear and golden with a huge, almost unmanageable airy white head. Smels of malts and straw initially, with some banana and cloves lingering underneath. Tastes like a thinner version of the regular hefe, with some bananas and spice mixed in with some very slight phenols. Mouth-feel is light to medium, and there's plenty of cabonation as evidenced by the head. It's not that this is such a bad beer, just a bit innocuous, and begs the question, why mess with the best?"
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a big foamy white head that lasts through out leaving chunky lacing in the glass. Crisp light fruit aroma with wheat, apple, citrus peel and banan notes. Very carbonated up front with crisp citrus fruit and slightly sour finish. Flavor similar to aroma with hints of golden apple, lemon/orange/grapefruit peel and banana. Crisp sour fruit presence with a slightly dry finish. Very refreshing!"
"D: Very good. Solid! I would do it again and with spring in the air i can see my self with a big bucket of these guys on the beach in the months to come. The big bottle style was nice and it was very coast affective at under 3$ per."
"Very easy to drink as well as refreshing."
"Flavor mirrors the aroma well, with a bigger presence from the malts that lends notes of honey, wheat, and biscuit. Hops are saved for the back of the palate, where they deliver a spicy, gentle bite of floral grasses. Mouthfeel is perfect, with a light body and a crisp finish that ends semi-dry thanks to a vigorous carbonation level. I really enjoyed this Kristalweizen: very easy drinking that I would have again without a moment's hesitation, especially on a hot summer day."
"Pours a very light golden yellow color, very clear, not cloudy at all, and lots of bubble action. Big foamy white head, frothy, very lasting. Malty, sweet, light flowery aroma. Some alcohol, but a lot of malts. Reminds me of a belgian. Light, banana taste. Floral. Very clean aftertaste. Very light taste, soft mouthfeel. Nutty. Tasty, but not as much as it warms up, more..eh."
"Kristallweissbier is good. This is my first go with a Kristalweizen. It's interesting in that it is reminiscent of Hefes and Weizenbocks, but isn't quite as good as either. The flavor is not as pronounced or satisfying. At the end of the day, Kristallweissbier is a good beer that's well worth checking out."
"D: Very drinkable. Not heavy at all, not meant for sipping, but for regular drinking. Perfect example of drinkability IMO."
"Scott"
"M/D - Light bodied and very crisp. Alot like a typical German hefe, without the chewiness. A definite easy drinker."
"I've never had this style before. I think that a hefeweizen loses certain characteristics when it is filtered. Otherwise, this is very nice and drinkable. It reminds me of a kolsch in terms of drinkability. I like this."
"D: This is my first beer of this style, so I didn't go in knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. Mild taste and low ABV, make this an exceptionally easy drinking beer."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer, especially for people like myself who aren't big fans of the bold yeast in a Hefeweizen. Definitely a good choice for someone looking to develop a taste for hefes, as you get a touch of the banana/clove goodness, but it doesn't blow you away."
"Extremely clear light gold in color. Large head, good lacing. Good head retention, miniimal carbonation. Slight smell of cloves. Light tasting slightly malty with a hint of banana, smooth finish. Excellent drinkability, a good session beer. An great alternative to American Macrobrews."
"M&D- Light, sparkly, and easy to drink"
"D: This goes down dangerously well. Almost too dangerous."
"This a truly great beer, from one of the worlds great breweries. Hefes out of this brewery have just enough of the tradional banana clove flavor without being overpowering. This can be a delicate balance. A smooth clean finish make this a excellent choice."
"D - Perfect Super Bowl beer!"
"Obviously, the original is a fuller, better beer, but is a nice beer in its own right."
"Overall a great surprise but, then again, I've never had anything from Weihenstephaner that I didn't think was exceptional."
"great drinkability."
"This beer is nicely carbonated, small bubbles feel velvety but keep it crisp & extremely drinkable. This would be an awesome summer beer."
"The taste is hefeweizen for sure. There are the nice floral notes, the light and pleasing sweet wheatiness and thin, smooth grain. There is a load of carbonation, some earthiness in the mid section, and a more drying and touch of hop in the finish. There is a touch of clove in the beer as well more up front though. The aftertaste is quite sweet, refreshing, light,"
"Really drinkable, something I could drink a ton of and pretty quickly. I'm not sure if I prefer this to a hefe or not, they are really similar. I could definitely see prefering this at certain times or when I'm in a certain mood. A pretty good beer."
"Refreshing above average beer."
"D: As for style, well... it's spot on. I just don't understand why you'd want to drink an unfiltered Hefeweizen. Drinks great as expected though it makes me want the unfiltered version."
"Unmistakelable aroma of weizen yeast: banana, clove. The mouthfeel is crisper and a bit lighter than the hee-weizen, witha clean finish. Clove and banana flavors are well-integrated into a fresh and lively brew. Would be perfect for summer."
"The flavor is initially masked by carbonation burn but eventually the weizen flavors take over into the aftertaste. The texture and finish are smooth and clean once the bubbles pass. Overall, the beer is tasty and satisfying but not exceptional. A bit of a disappointment for this brand but still pretty good."
"This is a filtered version of their normal weissbier(which is one of the best). If you like their unfiltered vesion you are sure to enjoy the Kristall too. Its crisp and flavorful, but in the filtering process it loses a bit of its character. Something to try but if you are a weissbier drinker you will def enjoy the unfiltered a bit more."
"Very easy to drink clarified version of Weihenstephaner's hefeweizen. I love their hefeweizen, and while this beer doesn't live up to the unfiltered version's flavor, it's still very good. This beer looks great in a tall weizen glass. It's a pale gold to yellow with an excellent head. It certainly takes advantage of the glassware. I'll admit that it does look a bit like a boring old lager with a huge head, but as a part of the Weihenstephaner lineup, it shines. In nearly every other category, it's a slightly muted version of the Hefeweissbier. It has the great spiced wheat character and a somewhat drier feel. On the other hand, the beer drinks just as easily if not easier than the Hefe. It's the perfect beer for a light lunch."
"D: A very clean finish and light drinking weiss."
"Overall: A clean and crisp easy drinking beer. There is some carbonation and a chalky/powdery. The finish is slightly astringent. It is a little bit lighter than a regular heffe. I enjoyed this beer and spot on for the style of beer."
"(rated Jul 15, 2008)"
"Drinkability: Nice light, refreshing delicious beer. I could drink more and more of this beer.. if only I picked up more at the store... :("
"It is very smooth in the mouth. Lively and long. Light but not insipid. It has a heavy carbonation."
"Taste: Very fruity. Much like the smell."
"Pours a clear yellow color with a large white head. Subtle nose of soft toasted wheat, esters of cloves and yeast. Light in body, a very pronounced wheat character dominates with flavor of banana, toasted barley, a subtle hop character and a mild soapiness throughout, very nice. Extremely drinkable but surprisingly filling for some reason... Definitely worth trying!"
"Drinkability is high. It's a solid beer, and appropriate for a Kristalweizen. I swear, Kristalweizens were made for summer enjoyment."
"Prost!"
"First Kristalweizen I've tried. Clear yellow, lots of carbonation, and a foamy white head. Lighter aroma of wheat, bananas, and bubblegum. A clean taste of banana, yeast, wheat, and some citrus. Dry finish. Very refreshing. Nice; kind of like a hefe light."
"D: Strong."
"drinkability is good. krystallweissbiers usually get negative ratings for the lack of flavor and body, but this brew is curiously pleasant on the palate with a nicely composed profile; though nothing less would be expected from Weihenstephaner. cheers!"
"Poured from bottle into pilsner glass. Nice and clear (duh) and pretty yellow too. Head was about 6 inches tall I think. Either I poured this one wrong or it was massively carbonated. Good retention and some lacing. Smell is of yeast, bread, and banana pretty much like a good hefe. Taste was ok, but I wasnt very impressed. It had the typical hefe qualities (yeast, bread, banana, some bubble gum) but a very strong hay-like taste as well with a bit of a metallic bite to it. Mouthfeel was light and pretty dry. Overall a good beer."
"Drinkability was simply off the charts. The beer was crisp, light, refreshing and packed with an array of interesting flavors. Overall, an outstanding summertime brew."
"Picked this up in a 20 oz. bottle for $2.99; gotta say, for such top-shelf quality Weihenstephaner's beers are an amazing value. Pours a magnificent pale pilsener-like gold, the ample carbonation making it look alive in the glass. Head is about one centimeter and dissipates quickly, leaving practically no lacing. Smell is very clean, think subdued hefeweizen and you've got it. Taste is like the smell: a cleaner hefeweizen. Flavors are all similar but less pronounced: banana, apple, some wheat and not a trace of hops. Tasty and refreshing, to be sure. Mouthfeel is excellent, the generous carbonation tickling your tongue until fading to leave a clean aftertaste. Drinkability is likewise exceptional. Great for the style, altough I don't think I'd choose it very often over Weihenstephaner's Hefeweizen."
"This beer poured a nice golden color with a fluffy, pillowy white head that lasted throughout. Aroma was dominated by banana with hints of vanilla and spice. Not a whole lot different in taste from the hefeweizen, but the mouthfeel is different. Pretty good beer."
"Lively carbonation and light, refreshing body. Nice summer beer. The smoothness and well-craftedness harken back to the unfiltered version of this beer, and are hallmarks of Weihenstephaner."
"D - A very refreshing and pleasant beer. Nice for a summer day or on those rare occasions when and IPA would be too much."
"Drinkability- Amazing. Although at $4 a pop this unfortunately limits the number I can consume."
"D: Not bad, but I think I enjoy the extra yeast in the bottle of hefes, but keeping in line with the style, and being that this is my first kristallweissbier, but the look of this beer brings down the drinkability for me just slightly."
"As drinkable as a pale lager. Not a bad beer by any means but in a sea of wonderful, complex, full flavored beers (Lukas Liquors) it is not anything that really stands out."
"Would like to session this."
"Overall, a great kristallweizen, and a great example of the style. Highly recommended."
"Light, refreshing and easy to drink, with a nice balanced taste, lightly sweet, with all the flavors expected from the aroma except for the bubblegum (it is just lightly sweet)."
"Taste & mouthfeel: As the aroma suggests, this is like a lighter, crisper version of their hefeweizen. Barley malt is more prevalent, giving a biscuit-like backbone to the banana and clove at the forefront. The light body, dryness of the finish and crisp texture make this ideal for quaffing, though it's not as interesting as Weihenstephaner's hefeweizen."
"D - Until now I thought of kristals as a ""weak-weizen"" but this has blown my mind. The difference between this and lesser hefes is nearly indistinguishable. The perfect kristalweizen."
"By the way, why is it that I type 5 letters in a row and only 3 show up? Can someone help me with that? C-Bob - figured you'd ask this already...'zup widdat?!"
"Drinkability is almost off the charts, just short of a 5 for me. A great session beer like any good weiss type should be. Just a great beer."
"Pours a pale yellow, very lager looking brew with a very hef looking fluffy white head. Nose is nice clove spice with some banana and a bit of straw. Taste follows with good wheat beer flavor, banana, plenty of clove, slight slight bubblegum, and wheat yeast. A nice mouthfeel, thicker than one would expect judging by the appearance. Drinkability is quite good, very sessionable, and certainly a good choice for the summer. Sort of a hefeweizen lite, but really does pack a nice punch of flavor. My first of this style, but I like it. certainly an interesting style. If someone handed me this and said, hey, try this wheat beer, or try this german weizen, I would look at it and say, WTF? this already looks like shit, but after trying it, you will see, you will see. I think I may try to brew one of these, just to F with my friends. A good and interesting beer."
"D: If this poured freely, I would pull from that stream each day. This brewery is amazing and it shows you why they have stood the test of time. All of their brews are great, this is no exception. Drink up, can't wait for my Vitus!"
"Pours a very clear golden yellow with lots of carbonation. The off white head is about 1 finger-width deep. The aroma is quite fruity and yeasty with a nice hint of clove. The spices are very nice. This tastes similar to how it smells. It is not a very exciting beer but it is very pleasant. I could drink a lot in one sitting. Quite carbonated."
"All and all, a good beer."
"For $2.69 at bevmo its hard to beat."
"Very clear golden color and pours out with a big fluffy white head. Aroma is fruity (banana & lemon) and yeasty. The beer tastes fruity and a little zesty with some spice and yeast. A bit watery and thin however. Not nearly as good as their regular hefe but still decent and definitely refreshing on a hot day, which it is here today."
"D- a very agreeable beer, very typical in smell/taste/feel but definitely above average. low abv and sheer refreshingness say all that needs to be said."
"I really only got this because A. I'll drink anything from The World's Oldest Brewery, and B. I've never reviewed a kristalweizen. Now I've tried all the Weihenstephaner's and reviewed a Kristal. Huzzah, and huzzah for well-crafted traditional beer."
"This beer is damn good. Perfect with beer brats and kraut. I would love to hang in Freising with a big ass 2L stein of this...or 2...or 3. Git 'cha some of this if you have not tried it yet."
"D- Alright beer just not one of my favorites and I think I'd rather have the Hefe than this."
"This is the first Kristalweizen I've tried and I can definitely say I prefer the Hefe. This is like a ""lager"" version of the Hefe, in that it's flavors are very clean. Still, it's a tasty brew that's worth trying."
"Very refreshing and an unexpected explosion of taste from such a light beer. Weihenstephaner is bar none world class."
"D - Overall, a very easy drinker. Smooth finish and great flavor. Average alcohol. This is my first Kristalweizen, and I have to say its not only delicious, but highly drinkable!"
"i have been very partial to Hacker-Pshorr recently but this is definitely a new winner. German wheat beers strike again!!"
"I don't really like hefeweizens so I much prefer this, which seems to be a lighter version of that style. Solid brew."
"Pours a crystal clear light golden hue with a three finger bright white head that takes a while to die down to a thin layer of bubbles. After swirling the glass, what lacing is there falls pretty quickly leaving just about nothing on the sides. Smell is banana, pear, and crispy wheat. Some clove and a touch of sweet bubblegum in the nose as well. Aroma seems sharper than a typical hefe. Taste begins with spice and clove followed by light banana. Clean wheat and faint pale malt midway on the tongue. Aftertaste is somewhat dry with a funky sweetness. Very crisp and refreshing light body with a soft feel. Carboantion is very steady in the mouth which seems to fit this beer and style very well. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. Unique beer for sure, one I would like to revisit again down the road."
"Picked a bottle of this up during a visit to my fovorite beer store. Had no idea what to expect especially since I am not familiar with kristall weissbiers. I was able to conclude that it was German weisbeer. The appearance was fantastic, very light golden in color with plenty of carbonation. The bubbles seem to be infinite. After a couple of glass fulls I was still confused as to the unique ingredient. It wasn't until I began to read the reviews that I learned that banana seems to be the main influence here. Interesting to say the least it is an extremely unique beer. So far I can take it or leave it. Of course it is the middle of winter in Ohio so perhaps I will re-visit this one when it is at least 70 degrees outside and I can sit out on my deck and feel refreshed."
"D- Yes in deed, great summer beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with decent carbonation tickling the palate during the swallow."
"I really enjoyed this beer. And it brought back memories of the gallons of Weihenstephaner I drank in Deutschland last year during Oktoberfest."
"Nice beer...would like to session this on a hot summer day."
"Pours a clear golden color. Huge frothy head, somewhat fizzy. Not as much retention as expected, fading quick. Smell is nice. Cleaner version of a Hefe. The spice is toned down along with the banana. Light grain. Faint bubble gum. Taste is similarly soft. No sharpness from spices. Very clean and easy going, soft around the edges. A light banana and again bubble gum are present. Some doughy bread. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Slick going down. Again, very soft. This brew is meant to be consumed in large amounts it seems. Light, refreshing, and simply enjoyable."
"Clear, bright golden yellow, with the same wonderful aroma as the Hefe. The Hefeweis flavor has a tendency to overwhelm because it has so many strong flavors, while the Kristalweis doesn't have the same complexity. The edge on the tartness and spices aren't present, but it is very clean and crisp. The wheats, banana and light bitterness combine very well. While the Hefe punches, the Kristalweis slaps your taste buds."
"D: I'd DEFINITELY drink another!"
"Drinkability is excellent. A great choice for a summer drink"
"D - easy drinking brew."
"This brewery is incredible. Possibly my favorite from the other end of the pond."
"MF&D - At hin to medium body and good flavor make this one great beer all around. Grab this one for your next BBQ, you won't be dissappointed."
"A great brew for the summer, easy drinking, but I prefer the spiciness of the hefe over this polished version. Still an awesome beer that is a nice change."
"D: Definitely a very drinkable beer. As noted above, an excellent summer beer that is very nice to hang out with an cool off. I felt that, overall, this was a very good example of a Kristalweizen."
"I have typically steered clear of Kristalweizens because I go for full-flavored / bodied wheat beers when I crave those esters and phenols. However, this beer truely impressed me. pours like a very strong Pilsner underneath a froathy head-stand and great retention. Standard straw in color with soft carbonation in appearance. Very fresh, fruity aroma rounds out the hearty pilsner malt flavor. Low on the bananna-clove character but bold with a lemony, orange, pineapple note that allows the herbal hop flavor to rise a bit. The filtration has lessened the intense hefe flavors, but balance well. Textures are also less creamy, but very easy to drink-- far from watery, grainy, or vegetal. Finishes very clean with a soft grassy hop dryness. I will certainly buy more of these during the hot summer months."
"Poured crystal straw yelow orange hue with a blast of bubbles rushing up in the center of glass leaving behind a two finger frothy white head. Also left behind a good amount of lace. The aroma, although subtle has the same banana, clove, hay, wheat malt and dough scent as it's fellow hefeweizen. The taste on the other hand is more crisps, sharp, and fizzy upfront. The lighty sweettart wheat malt, clove and dough came through the middle. Ending with a hint of green apple bitter from the hops. Overall, this brew rocks, with all it's tasteful and aroma characters one could drink it all night. Enjoy"
"O'all - Highly drinkable, but at $2.99/half liter I need a bit more taste. Many other hefeweizen's have a lot more character, and are more worth drinking."
"D - excellent choice for summer day"
"Poured from a .05L bottle into my Kloster Andechs weizen glass. My first kristalweizen (I think) and the last of the easily available Weihenstphaner beers for me to try. I guess I've enjoyed hefes so much that I was predisposed against the clear version, but this beer proves itself. The beer is golden colored, good clarity, lots of bubbles and a thick creamy poofy foam. The smell is classic German weizen, bananas and so forth, very nice. The taste is the same, with a creamy mouthfeel. As I drink it the glass shows thick lacing of dry-looking foam. A very good beer overall, as are all the Weihenstaphaner beers. Some of the best from Bavaria."
"Ah, what a nice fresh tasting beer this is. Pours golden with good clarity and a very nice white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of fresh wheat, and lightly of banana and clove. The taste is wonderful. Not grainy at all, and slightly sweet with banana and pear and with a lightt wheat flavor with sweet banana on the finish. Very lightly spicy and fresher then their hefeweisen in flavor but perhaps a bit less creamy. The clove is definitely more restrained. Crisp and smooth and a pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability: A fine, refreshing kristal."
"Poured into hefe glass and received a light, straw gold body w/ good carbonation and a one-finger head thatleft a lace ring. A sharp smell of clove mixed with orange, pear some hops and a faint bread malt. Light on the fruit and a tad neavier on the spice and hops, this light to medium-bodied brew goes down slick and smooth with a dry backbite from some malt (bread again, I think) and the wheat. A good summer beer, I guess. I enjoyed it, but would prefer a more fruit/spicy hefe myself."
"The taste is fine. Lots of bread, cloves and tart fruit. Carbonation and mouthfeel is exceptional. This is a fine beer."
"This large bottle pours a medium bright golden with a little cloudieness when held to direct light the head was bountiful and white,it disapated quickly leaving some circular lacing as it fell to a thin cap.The nose was malty and sweet with fruits and bubblegum.This brew is a smoothe easy drinker,the warmer the weather the better for this refreshing under flavored beverage,mostly grainy with some raw bread dough tandencies,some banana and apple give a nice toned down sweetness,its easy to forget this is a wheat brew,it seems over filtered in a way,not as much of the wheat flavors I have come to expect,but a light body and clean finish make for a enjoyable overall expirience."
"D: Aside from the mouthfeel that could be beefed up a little bit, a really tasty weizen beer from Weihenstephaner, would buy again."
"This wheat is very easy to drink and perhaps the only wheat I could see becoming a session beer for me. That being said, it is very simple so it does not stand out, particularly, against the field of great beers."
"Although not as much character as a regular weiss but, this version adds much more refreshment making it perfect for a hot summer day."
"banana and wheat with a little bit of bitterness and a bubble gum finish. This was a pretty good weizen. Not my favorite German weizen, but it is still pretty good."
"Poured from a bomber into a weizen glass. This beer as the name states poured a crystal clear gold so much so you could read a book through the glass. The smell was sweet banana now&later. The taste was awesome, pure banana. Such a clean great tasting beer. Light and crisp, a perfect representation of this style. A close tie between this and the Dunkel as my favorite of this style. Great beer and a great brewery. A must try for any Weiss fan."
"The beer was poured straight into a weihenstephaner glass with a bubbly crystal gold color and a two finger white head. It smelled of wheat, honey, and citrus. The taste was similar to the weisse but much more crisp. It was made up of honey, citrus, honey, and hops. It was a crisp and refreshing beer. A great beer to have on a hot summer day!"
"D = Good drinkability, this one has nice refreshing flavors in a clean package, but still with good weight."
"The taste is similar, with strong, persistent, but it's light and crisp. There is a hint of minty bubblegum in the middle, before a crisp finish and a long, mellow grain aftertaste. It has light bitterness. This is delicious and full of flavour but refreshing and highly drinkable, light and crisp."
"This is a very drinkable beer. This was my first beer from Brauerei Weihenstephan; I enjoyed it a lot, I will be trying this again as well as their others."
"Mouthfeel is quite thin and a tad watery. It's easy to drink, but no that interesting."
"It felt great and was very very easy to drink. I could easily have several of these."
"That being said, this is a pretty drinkable beer. Wouldn't mind having a couple of these with a dinner."
"D - Like other Weihenstephaner brews this is very good and pretty easy to drink worth trying sometime"
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Appearance clear golden yellow in color with a huge white head that went down to a thin layer that left a nice lace. Smell bannana clove and and lemon. Taste no bannana in the taste to my suprise hints of orange and lemon zest with firm malt bread and a bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel mediem body and high carbonation. Drinkability with out a doubt an outstanding beer for a summer day buy the pool or at the beach."
"D - Impressive on every level. Extremely well balanced and rounded. A definite revisit for me, and a big recommendation here."
"Drinkability: Where has this beer been all my life! Not only did this beer make me hungry for banana bread, but it would make an excellent choice for a session beer. It doesn't matter what season you're in. This beer would suit any season. I glad I didn't throw this beer away!"
"This is an immensely drinkable beer. It goes down easy and has a taste that never takes over your palate."
"Drinkability: This beer can be enjoyed all night long. Easy to drink and feel familiar with but in my opinion the first alcoholic odor is too strong for me."
"Nice pour with head about 50% of glass at the start, could be how I poured it though. Smell of fruit, banannas and pears. Soft head with fluffy cloud likeness. Nice sustain. Rusty in color, not quite the soft weissbier color, but that should be expected. On the taste, I am getting mild banannas with slight carbonation. Great as far as taste goes and mouthfeel and drinkablility are up there. Another great beer from this brewer."
"Poured a 16oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. Pours a straw yellow with a billowy creamy head. Aroma is very light. Wisps of banana and vanilla come to the nose. Taste is sweet throughout with notes of banana and vanilla. Very straight forward. Extremely tasty. Mouthfeel is full bodied, yet light finishing with dryly. An exceptionally drinkable beer."
"Overall - This is very good, but seriously, get the Hefe instead."
"Pours a clear straw color with no head after the little bit that first shows quickly dissipates. Nose is yeasty with a touch of lemon. Taste is sweet and evenly so. Even as it warms the flavor stays constant. Mouthfeel has a good carbonation to it and an even feel. Highly drinkable."
"Very drinakble Clovey and bananas, a good summer-time quincher. Fans of the hefe genre will love it! hit-o belgie style!"
"as the name suggests, this was a crystal clear pale gold with a nice head. it bubbled like champagne in my weizen glass. traditional german weissbier aromas of bananas, cloves, fresh bread dough, and lemons with some herbaceousness to boot. sweet bready malts upfront led to a crisp, drying finish. mouthfeel is spritzy, somewhat chewy, and light-bodied. a classic."
"Drinkability: Wonderful, this is a fantastic and refreshing session beer."
"D - This is a very good Kristal Weizen. Nice flavors and a good aroma."
"Light fruit with hints of banana, pear, peach. Spices blend in well with the addition of a lemony tart. Fruit and spices cling to the back of tongue after a gulp. Smooth and soft on the palate and very smooth. A very nice example of the style. Easy drinking with a light body."
"First time I tried a so called kristal weizen, and I really wasn't too impressed... although this brew definitely scores for appearance, with a nice frothy head that def has staying power, the smell is only slightly appealing, and the taste is about average compared to some other brews of similiar style... definitely prefer the hefes over this one... the taste is more subdued, and the citrus and wheat flavor less apparent in this particular type of brew... a little more bitter than what i was expecting... A little better than average sample, but not too sure if I'd purchase this one again, especially considering the fact that a 16.9 oz bottle ran me $2.50..."
"Nice golden color with plenty of carbonation. The head of foam was really thick and creamy, but it dropped down to a this lace in about 15 mins. At first I wasn't crazy about the taste, but about 3-4 sips into the beer I changed my tune. It is not like any beer that I typically drink, so I didn't what to expect.Interesting brew, I would buy this again."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability : une bonne bière dans le pur style kristal weizen"
"This beer pours a light golden color, with a very nice head. Good lacing as well. The smell of this beer is light and fruity. The taste of this beer is very good. Good sweetness and fruitiness. Mouthfeel is good. The drinkability of this beer is excellent. Its light, but flavorful. Overall I found this beer very enjoyable. Light and refreshing, yet still flavorful. Nice change of pace from a hefe. Another great wheat beer from this brewery. Will purchase again."
"poured from a 1pt 9oz bottle. Light, creamy head that had mild retention, dissapated rather quickly. great aromas of spices and fruit. initial taste of wheats and hops, followed by a long aftertaste of bananas and bread. light mouthfeel, good bite with a pleasingly clean finish, great drinkability, could sip this on a hot day, or a cloudy fall day such as right now. Had this beer on tap in Germany, they added a lemon wedge but i prefer it much more without to experience the full flavor."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not filling at all, decent kick, its the first Kristal Weizen that Ive tried, but this beer has certainly made me look forward to trying more of them. This is a nice refreshing beer that I could drink several of, no matter what the situation. Im also looking forward to trying more stuff from Weihenstephaner since Ive now had two excellent beers from them."
"Pours a light gold color with lots and lots of bubbly white head that just doesn't want to go away, and clings to the glass. Smells heavily of yeast and a little of noble hops, sweet and spicy. The taste is also sweet and spicy, not a lot of hoppy flavor, but it's wheaty and malty with some banana and cloves, very nice. Mouthfeel is light and creamy, not very fizzy or tingly like a hefe can get. This is a very tasty and easy to drink, I'll definitely be looking for it again"
"Very easy to drink. It would be a great beer on a hot summer afternoon. There is too little flavor to rate it extremely high, but there's nothing really negative about the experience either."
"Pours with a slight chill haze, otherwise a brilliant straw colour, very healthy looking, wine wine colour, thick white head, nice lace spots, settles to a thin layer. Smell is light banana, some clove, bread, bisuity malts, mild aroma but quite nice, refreshing. Taste is sweet and malty, honey, light banana, light spice finish, wheat, bread, again very refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, very lively and quenching. Nice beer, not as complex and flavourful as a weiss but very enjoyable. Thanks Jan!"
"Overall, very drinkable. I would recommend this as an entry into true German hefeweizens."
"Drinkability: Hmmmm...it's drinkable and good at cleansing the palate. Enjoyable enough but is a bit ""tame"""
"D: Very good session beer. Low ABV and mild flavor, yet not boring, makes this a perfectly drinkable beer. Takes all the good characteristics of a hefe and mixes them with a pilsner. Great style."
"With so few authentic kristallweizens out there, this one was a refreshing summer beverage. It pours a very light golden color, almost looks like a light offering from an American mass domestic, but the pour produces a beautiful frothy white head. The head lasted for quite a while on top of a mildly fizzy beer. The aroma delivered the pleasant and expected estery and fruity notes, predominantly banana. Taste of wheat, but a nice crispness to it and finishes clean. Its rare to have a tasty beer that really quenches your thirst AND provides a balanced flavor as well. Nice with lemon chicken dish."
"Have had this brew a number of times in the past. Pours to a nice yellow color that was very clear. Nice large white head that had good retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is nice, very hefe in its scents of banana and cloves but in a laid back way. The taste is very smooth, giving it an easy drinking feel. The clove seems to dominate over the banana taste but overall this is a very good brew. This is a great summer brew IMO, one that I will look for."
"Drinkability was good, but there are so many others, I wouldn't bother having another of these. Recommended to try."
"As I said, a new style for me but one I will search out other examples to compare and explore."
"Overall: A good looking, solid Kristall Weissbier thats not terribly complex, this ones worth a try. Possibly a fresher sample would prove more impressive."
"D: The moderate abv and strong flavor profile make this a great choice in the authentic German wheat beer realm."
"Very solid all around. Would pick this up again, and it was a nice beer to drink on a warm day."
"Lately it has been all beers German for me, so I decided to review a beer that I hadn't sampled in a while. I poured this one into an Erdinger Weizen glass, which resulted in a nice large white heading, and a coloration that truly looks like champaign. Tiny air bubbles raced towards the top of the glass throughout. Smell had some spicy character, but also had some fruit such as pear. Again, a champaign aroma comes through, which makes it seem similar to a Tripel. Taste starts off with pears, then ends with crisp green apple, leaving the palate feeling a little dry. Carbonation was right on par with this one, making this one really refreshing. Keep in mind to let it swish around a bit when drinking, as new complexities come through. I love this beer, and will need to search for more examples of this style. Weihenstephaner delivers again. Cheers"
"The beer pours a thick foamy head. It certainly lives up to its name of Kristal...as in crystal clear. Overall I was disappointed in this beer in comparaison to their unfiltered hefeweizen. I prefer the unfiltered qualities as opposed to the filtered. The beer is light, tasty, and refreshing but it is something I would pass up for the unfiltered."
"I would highly recommend this beer."
"Wei's Kristallweissbier scores pretty well here in the first of four samples, and we'll be back as soon as their Hefeweissbier flexes its muscles..."
"Again, not as good as the Hefe, but possibly the best example of its kind. A very good beer."
"M&D - super smooth, with an easy but lively carbonation, a great summertime session brew, a great beer"
"Light, almost too light in the flavor department- I think its just the mouthfeel that makes it seem so thin to me though."
"Served in a bottle at Concordia Ale House, Portland, OR."
"Nice Krystal. Quite tasty and highly drinkable."
"Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier pours a golden yellow with a thick white head and very active carboanation from a brown 500 ml bottle. A pleasant banana and clove aroma emits from my glass. The carbonation is a bit too strong, it's kind of killing my tastebuds. There is a nice clove flavor and some banana too. A nice summer beer, but I'm not sure why I would drink this rather than a hefe."
"Served in a Weizen glass, the beer pours a clear light gold color with an inch and half white frothy head. Head retention is very good, lacing is OK. It smells like wheat, yeast, bananas and cloves. It tastes pretty much the same way it smells, too. The beer has a nice sweetness which isn't too strong, along with a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel is light, but very fizzy with a lot of carbonation, but in this case the carbonation fits the beer pretty well and doesn't take anything away from the beer at all. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and dry, and finishes clean. I think this is a pretty decent beer, I'll have to pick one up again soon!"
"d: light-drinking beer weissbeer. enjoyable, especially on hot days."
"Poured a little too cold into a weizen glass and was impressed by the clear clean appearance. A phenolic rich head that lasted a while was nice and the aroma lasted throughout the glass. The taste was magnificent. I know some like more subtlety in their hefes but I don't. I like big banana as long as it's nicely balanced and this is. Beaut cloves and malt. This is a great beer with great length that leaves you looking for more."
"Highly recommended"
"More used to the cloudy wheat beers so this one a little different. Feel that the filtering has removed a little of the character of the beer. However, that aside, this remains a genuinely good example of the wheatbeer style."
"500ml bottle: Yellow straw colour beer, with a huge frothy pure white head, generous carbonation visible. Wheaty nose, sweet with hints of lemon, some spicy esters also apparent. Light flavours of spice and banana esters, wheat is at the fore smooth, rolls along the tongue effoertlessly , some citric elements come into play, fast dry finish. A very drinkable beer from Germany and my first Kristallweizen.."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and rounded with zippy carbonation."
"Poured a clear golden color with a rather small white head that did not leave much in the way of lacing. The smell is of banana bread, not as much clove like their hefeweizen. The taste is of banana as well, a nice mellow sweetness. The feel is a bit fizzy and crisp. This is a very drinkable beer and a great beer for folks that maybe wary of the cloudy nature of a hefeweizen."
"D: Excellent warm weather beer. Very refreshing. Perfect for a session. Perhaps not as complex as an unfiltered hefeweizen, this would be a great introduction to wheat beers for a novice."
"Pours a slightly cloudy straw yellow, with a huge head, and sticky lacing. The smell is fresh with a subtle aroma of banana and cloves. Taste is fresh and creamy with a spicy bite at the end and a nice bitter finish. The mouthfeel hasn't been affected by filtration, and is quite luxurious. Highly drinkable."
"D - Drinkability is decent. Very average wheat beer overall."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color, awesome carbonation, nice small foamy white head, nice lacing afterwards. The nose is of malts, hops, yeast, banannas, clove, and some spices. The taste is malty/hoppy, the belgium yeast, and a little spicy. The finish is smooth and slightly dry. Light-Medium body. Very drinkable, another very good brew from Weihenstephaner."
" Nice aroma of clove, banana with hints along the way of soapy malt. Same with the taste, same as above but just on a lighter scale. Good beer and it was very enjoyable, drinkable  but if the <regular> Weissbier is available, go for the total gusto."
"A very tasty Kristal Weizen. I actually prefer this one over Weihenstephan's Hefe Weizen. Recommmended."
"A nice Kristal Weizen. The only thing disappointing about this brew was the head that faded fairly quickly, however it stays very bubbly throughout the experience. Has a nice dryness to it, a little funky a little belgian like almost. Clings fairly well to the mouth and is easy to drink. It's definitely a nice wheat beer. It's definetly worth a try. Nice stab at the style."
"I will definitely drink this one again."
"D: At first I saw this beer as some stander German weissbier. This was nicely balanced, refreshing yet flavorful. Good stuff."
"D- No alcohol apparent here at all, could drink this all summer long, so refreshing and crisp while retaining all the good weissbier character. This is definitely the benchmark for Kristallweizens everywhere. This beer is one of my first memories of getting into the world of better beer and its probably my all time fav summer day beer. Prost!"
"This beer was drank, as I reviewed it, on a Sunday afternoon at home (19 Nov 2006)."
"Drinkability and Notes: Well, this beer is supposed to be noted for its crystal clear appearance. But it goes beyond that there are some interesting hidden smells and a few tastes too. Suprisingly over 5% alcohol as its not even close to noticable. Won't have any problem ending this 16.9oz bottle but thats enough for me. Always interesting to see what the boys over in Germany have been coming up with for hundreds of years holding to the Purity law of 1516."
"There's a slight oilyness in there but for the most part it's a refreshing, tasty brew."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Lemon/yeast nose. Starts sweet lemony, with wheat and yeast flavor, finish is squeaky clean. Would be a great summer beer. $2.99 for a 500ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia."
"A very good kristal weizen. I'm quite impressed with this little dandy, but not too surprised at the quality considering what I've come to expect from this fine brewery. Definitely recommended, and an almost undefeatable treat to beat the heat! (Rhyming not intentional)."
"Mouthfeel is very good, and drinkability is high. Refreshing, not overpowering, a well balanced beer, and another one of Germany's best from the Brauerei Weihenstephan."
"This is one hell of a beer. I could see myself quaffing alot of these. If i close my eyes i can picture myself in the English Gardens. This is a great beer for all hefeweizen and weiss lovers"
"This pours golden yellow with great carbonation and brilliant white head. One of the best looking beers I've seen. The smell is alright, but is mostly wheaty malts. However, it does have a hint of melon to it. The taste is basically the smell with out the melon to make it interesting and the mouthfeel is plainly smooth and light bodied. Overally, I could session this, and might if I got it fresh on tap, but will pass from the bottle next time."
"Pours to a nice golden yellow with good carbonation and a medium white head, which dissipates very quickly and leaves no lacing. Aroma and flavor were very strongly bread and wheat, with clove spice playing a big part in the taste as well. Unfortunately, palate was much too dry, and even slightly metallic. But a good beer."
"Medium bodied, smooth and very easy to drink. Excellent with food."
"A clear, crisp, bright gold with great head retention and good lacing. The smell is a little clove and lemon with some breadiness with only a slight aromatic banana. The taste is clovey and lemony with a slight breadiness. Mouthfeel is crisp and very carbonated, almost too crisp. Overall it's very good. I would have another."
"Clean, crisp, very complex yet balanced, and refreshing."
"This beer pours a crystal clear golden with a decent white head that leaves a nice film and little lace. The smell of sweet wheat and pale malt. The taste is also sweet and malty with wheat flavor but not much by the way of hops. The mouthfeel is pretty good as well, not overwhelming. Overall, just an average forgettable beer."
"This beer really did go nicely with dinner and I'm glad to have tried it, but to be honest I'm not really sure who this beer is for - hefe fans will want the real thing, yeast and all, and non-hefe fans like myself will want something altogether different."
"Drank this with Erdinger hefe, and Schofferhofer Krystal. This was the clear winner."
"D: Nice weissen although a bit grassy but I'm sure this one could grow on me."
"Filtered or not, this beer is awesome and extremely easy to drink. Could be a great ""Crossover"" beer to the unfortunate BMC ones."
"Pours a crystal/kristall clear gold in the 0.5 SOHM Erdinger Weissbrau glass with a stiff white pillowy head. Banana, wheat and bready aromas a little dimished by filterings as is the over all flavor. Less sweet that the standard heffe with lighter mouthfeel from the missing proteins. Still in all a very drinkable summer offering from Weihenstephan that some may prefer until they aquire the taste of the fuller unfiltered version."
"First, I have to say, this is a very pretty colored beer, though a bit mainstream these days. And while what followed was just a bit lesser, that's not a damning thing. It has the crisp wheat thing going on, and the ABV is nothing intimidating, so that means it goes down smooth and easy. So it's summertime, and the weissbier's fine."
"Sample at Whole Foods Market. Pours a clear pale gold color with a thin white head and fair lacing. Wheaty aroma along with a noticeable banana smell. Medium-bodied and smooth with flavors of wheat, banana and light spice. The finish is clean, wheaty and a little watery. Light spice and wheat aftertaste. Fairly enjoyable overall."
"Drinkability was also very good I could have this just about any time. Mk"
"Drinkability - good mellow beer for a really hot day, easy drinking, fairly satisfying, rather sessionable."
"It's a good brew from a great brewery. Personally, I would choose the hefe-weiss over this if given a choice, but this one is certainly worth drinking!"
"Pours a filtered pale yellow with lively carbonation rising to a quickly fading white fluffy head. Smell is of slight banana and clove with hints of a nice yeasty quality in the nose as well. Taste is dry and crisp and very easy to drink. This seems to be a ""light"" or toned down hefeweizen. While it is a very good and refreshing brew, I keep thinking how much better the hefeweizen is."
"taste and mouthfeel are very predictable. just what you would expect. it's crystal clear! smooth. perfect balance, highly thirst-quenching and tasty. interesting note: this would probably be a good beer to give to a total rookie, as it is closer in appearance to a boring macro. as opposed to a cloudy, foggy hefeweizen which can definitely scare some noobs. i have a new mission for converting my macro-swilling co-workers!"
"A summer favorite! It looks like a Miller Lite but it pours like its Hefe sibling in a weizen glass with a substantial head. Very smooth. Low hop notes. Very clean. Without the suspended yeast and proteins a lot of the citrus and fruit flavors are missing. Some people may find this too bland if a DIPA is a favorite."
"Very tasty filtered hefeweizen and the first I've ever had of this particular style. Super easy to drink and refreshing. Do these guys make a bad beer?"
"Nice mild and easy going for any hot summer day. Pleasant and refreshing taste."
"Pours a light golden with perma-bubbles and a great head, not much lacing. Smells of bananas and other medium fruits, a little grain, and light malt in there. At first I thought 'huh, this is like a hefe-light.' As I drank on, I felt almost guilty for that, cause while it is a little lighter with the wheaty banana, its nonetheless a deliciously crisp and clean, a very active beer on the palate. Overall, a great beer for when you need something lighter."
"Pours out a pale golden with very active carbonation and a thin, fizzy head that comes and goes. What a shitty head. What comes out most in the nose is, of course, the wheat character and a strong banana phenolic presence. The flavors begin slightly phenolic then move on to an apple sweetness and then onto what reminds me exactly of wheat crackers. Very drying in the finish. Mouthfeel is lively enough to keep the somewhat muted flavors alive on the palate. Light-bodied enough to make this a very quaffable beer, but can be a bit sticky."
"D: This is my first time with a kristall weizen, and I can't figure out why anybody would want to drink this as opposed to a hefeweizen. This brewery's original hefe is one of my all-time favorite beers, but this one is lacking the intense taste and aroma of its contemporary. I can't think of any reason to buy this one again."
"Very drinakble once you get past the bananas, but a good summer-time quincher. Fans of the hefe genre will love it"
"Overall Impression: A very enjoyable beer. The carbonation level is the only thing I have some problems with. Its pretty to look at, has a pleasant and simple taste, and a fair nose. A good lawnmower in my book."
"Overall- maybe a beer to use for a celebration toast but other than that there's no reason to really drink the light sugar water. Wasn't bad but not 1 I'll revisit."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... Recommended..."
"O - great example of the style."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Fantastic mouthfeel... active, alive, foamy. It's just that when I bury my nose in the glass, inhale, and take a sip, I am not sold on this. Stay with their superb, masterful Hefeweizen for a classic beer for all times."
"This is my first kristal weizen. I will try, and review them all."
"this is a crisp, clean beer for the weiss styles. I wasn't really keen on the smell, but maybe I'll have to revisit this one in the summer when I'll appreciate the style more."
"Overall: I always expect less from Kristall Weiss brews, but this did not disappoint, clearly one of the very best examples of the Teutonic variant for sure. Superb stuff, and very tasty. Recommended!"
"This is a very enjoyable brew. Worth exploring for anyone who likes this style."
"Plenty refreshing. Nice with sesame chicken."
"500 mL bottle with no freshness date - served chilled in a weizen glass. Pours a brilliantly clear gold that looks like a pilsner and it's topped with a 4 finger head of medium bubbles that make some noise and leave little lacing. Smells of bananas, spiciness/grassiness, wheat, pepper, and some cloves. Flavor is similar but with less banana and a bit of metal, and a medium body that is fairly smooth. It's a familiar flavor, but it's just not the same without the yeast."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle with a code on the back label into a weizen glass. Had a clear pale straw color with a lot of head and carbonation. The smell was a watered down Hefe with no dominant aspects. The mouthfeel was okay - it goes down smooth with a touch of carb. Overall it had a pretty average flavor and aftertaste. It doesn't really excite but is kind drinkable in the just want to quench the thirst with demanding a lot of flavor. I find this to be the case with most kristal's so I still prefer the regular hefe's. Ok as a rare change of pace. (3.5, RB, Tie, O)"
"Kristallweissbier is the last of the (commonly available) offerings from 'The World's Oldest Brewery' to enter my glass. It occurs to me, as I look forward to finishing the last several ounces of this one, that this brewery may just be my favorite in all of Germany; assuming that top to bottom quality is the overriding criterion. If it says Weihenstephaner on the label, then I know a quality experience awaits."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but not as good as their Hefe in my opinion. Worth a try if you're into the style, but this is probably not a beer I will buy again."
"Beautiful Beer. Pours a golden colorcompletely clear, with a tall, puffy white head. The aroma is much more restrained than a hefe, but the same qualities are present: banana, citrus, yeast, phenolics, fruity-tutiness. This is a mild, careful beer, but very tasty. It has a medium to light body, with a nice refreshing wheat-citric quality. Theres a notable hoppiness, that becomes more prominent in the finish (no discernable hop aroma though). Crisp and firm finish. This is a good wheat beer, solidly good."
"Honestly, weizen is not one my favorite styles. This is a pretty good example of a kristal, and fans of the genre will undoubtedly score it higher."
"It developed through the palate which made it interesting and drinkable but far more like a hefe weizen than I was expecting"
"This is a great Kristal Weizen. Poured out to a pale straw color with a nice, white foamy 1/8 inch head. Medium high carbonation. Aromas of malt and yeast are quickly noted, as are milder elements of hops and sweetness. Taste is well balanced, with notes of malt, hops and a sweet bread like finish. Some yeast flavors are noted toward the start, but give way to a mild and smooth bitterness. Good mouthfeel, with carbonation lighting up the palate in anticipation of what is in store. High drinkability, this brew is a solid example of the Kristal-style. Recommended."
"Fits the description of Kristalweizen to a tee: Clear golden colour. Pleasing (although very mild) aroma of banana with just a hint of spice. A bit of fruitiness, but it finishes short and clean with lots of carbonation. This is probably a good introduction to the world of Weizen, but I prefer a more classic style of hefeweizen. I'm not entirely sure why someone would choose to drink the less flavorfull style, but I guess that's just me. I guess this would be a good starter beer for someone wanting to try better beers"
"D - This beer is pretty good around the board. With a bolder flavor and a more pleasant odor, this would not only be the archetypal Kristal Weizen, but also quite possibly my favorite beer. I really wish there were more Kristal Weizens around."
"Very drinkable, no falts for the style, nice aroma while drinking, and definitely a session beer."
"Very impressive. I haven't really had a lot of experience with this style. Lovely mellow, smooth flavours. I think the Banana really stands out in this one. Extremely refreshing and almost relaxing flavour. Dosen't feel too soft in the mouth though, and that's a big thing for me. Carbonation is near perfect. Leaves a nice sticky feeling in the back of the throat too. Nearly clean aftertaste, just a hint of mellowy goodness. An extremely quaffable beer."
"Mid sized bottle, no feshness indication to be found. This brew pours quite light straw and very clear. Expansive white head early, minor head late and minimal lacing. Nose is crisp and clean with a hint of lime and yeast picked up. This is a fresh tasting beer, citrus, light banana, yeast picked up. This is a fine summer brew, great for newbies, refreshing. Easy style and beer to like. well worth enjoying with light food."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and cleansing on a very hot day"
"Bottle at Andys. Poured a crystal clear yellow in color with a nice fluffy white head. Hoppy and malty aroma. Banana and clove notes. Spicey and. Yeasty. Sweettasting. Malty and hoppy flavor. Crisp and refreshing. Spicey. Finish is smooth. Drinkable. Nice beer."
"Banana like esters up front with flavors of clean wheat malt. Some hints of yeast and phenols are hiding in there. Finish is clean with some esters and spiciness lingering. Small hop presence in the middle of the sip."
"I've often wondered why this style hasn't caught on at our local brewpubs and breweries. Its a great craft beer that I would love to see made by some local breweries."
"Presentation: Packaged in a sixteen ounce brown glass bottle with a pop off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"This is the first Kristal Weizen I have had. Appears a crystal clear straw yellow in tall full fizzy white head. Streaming bubbles from the bottom feed the head and keep it in tact. Light banana notes with a light doughy yeastiness as well. Some wheat scents in the aroma as well, good stuff. Banana and wheat flavors with a slight bitterness on the finish. May no be the most complex thing but its pretty darn tasty. VERY clean, crisp and refreshing with a solid body. This is all about the drinkability so thats not an issue. Great summertime beer or anytime beer, very refining and clean all around."
"This one pours a clear golden color with a good white head that hangs out for a bit. The aroma is estery (banana) somewhat refreshing. The taste is also a little on the estery side, not a bad thing. light hops. Good mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Its pretty damn good beer. For it's genre its about a B+. But Overall I'd definately recommend it."
"Holy shit, this is my first Kristal Weiss and it was weird pouring this thing. Pours absolutely clear like a macro lager. Impressive 3 finger fluffy weiss head on top of the straw yellow body. It's weird not having to agitate and pour the remaining yeast. Aroma is a little lighter than it's nonfiltered brother but the yeasty banana notes still come through. Taste is extremely light and well balanced. Notes of bananas balance the wheat perfectly. Finish is extremely crisp. Mouthfeel is surprising creamy. Very good beer in its own right, but I prefer its brother. I might pick up every so often just for the kick of pouring this perfectly clear beauty."
"Crisp light body, perfect for summer, I would have it again on a hot day, but not the most flavorful of beers in the world."
"Quite refreshing and quaffable, a real nice brew on a warm day. I found myself having to stop comparing this to their incomparable hefeweizen. Still, this is the quintessential beer for the style, IMO. Well worth picking up."
"Pours cyrstal clear with many streams of effervescent bubbles racing to replenish the foamy, rocky aromatic head. This hue of the brew is deceptively light. Remarkable head retention. Aroma is very appealing. The bananas and yeast don't pull any punches. Lemony fragrances grace my nostrils, as do a little grainy wheat. Taste is typical of the quality of I have come to expect from Weihenstephan. Slightly more refined than their regular hefe weizen, to be expected from the filtering process. Flavor begins mildy acidic, with the bitter lemons up front. Gritty wheat compliments uber-smooth pale malt flavor. Towards the end, the clovey bananas jump up and linger into the finish. Moderate carbonation works well with this style, adding a crispness that even affects the aftertaste. After swallowing, you are left with spicy, sparkling bananas. Very pleasing to the palate. Easy drinking weizen bier, Weihenstephan has another winner here."
"It isn't very expensive either, making it a good beer to have on a summers afternoon."
"Drinkability: Drinkability is fine, this would make a good session beer, I've had hefe's, I like better, but this one is just fine, and I would drink again."
"Pours a cristal clear pale yellow into the weissbier glass, with a frothy head which diminishes relatively quickly. There seems to be an endless stream of bubbles - interesting to know that a filtered weissbier looks like ginger ale. Mellow hints of clove and banana in the nose. Similar in the taste. The standard banana esters and spices associated with weissbiers but very mellow. Too mellow for my liking. I suppose it is just the style, but it just seems like a dumbed-down hefe. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Technically there's nothing really wrong with this, I'm just not a fan of the style I guess. Think I'll stick to hefes."
"Overall a good solid brew. This bottle was given to me, and I believe I'll be returning to the Hefeweissbier next time. I would bet this style would grow on me if I revisted it a time or two over this summer (?)"
"Overall, this is a darn good beer. I'm definitely going to be drinking more this summer. The only real quibble I have is the price: $4 for a 16-oz bottle. Other than that, yum!"
"Pours a light carmel color with alot of carbonation. Smell is mild wheat aroma. You'll feel the carbonation when this goes down. Although is seems highly carbonated it is surprisely pleasing. Taste is moderate, but you can definately taste the wheat in this beer. Drinkability is moderate and I don't care for wheat beers all that much, but I did enjoy this and I do believe I'm going to give this a try sometime soon."
"Overall: Very good weiss. I will be getting more of this."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades. The aroma is a good. It has a dry, yet sweet wheat malt scent with some clove and banana hints and a fruity aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a very light, yet flavorful feel. It boasts of pale wheat malts and a fruity yeast finish. This is a good beer for the casual wheat beer drinker. It would be great on a hot day with some lemon. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a great drinking wheat beer. It's light and flavorful. How can you go wrong?"
"I prefer the unfiltered wheat beers, but I do enjoy this beer. Well done."
"This kristal weizen poured a clear, golden color with tall, fluffy, white foam that persisted and clung to the glass, and with a good steady carbonation. The smell was mildly citrus with a hint of banana and something that tickled the nose. The taste had a mild banana flavor with some tangy citrus (lemon) as well. It was sweetly malty with a touch of phenols and a touch of yeast. The finish was fruity with a very mild hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and medium carbonation. It was relatively clean with with some citrusy tanginess and a very light hoppiness lingering on the tongue. This was a very nice, easy to drink beer."
"Drinkability- Wish I had bought a few more of these. Outstanding tasting brew. Have a hefe in the fridge of this brand that I can't wait to try. Maybe sometime this week. Grab this bad boy if you see it."
"A beautifully crafted beer, no question."
"A nice clean, not at all cloudy for a wheat beer, yellow beer with a big bright white head. A good strong bannana and clove aroma, which I expect from a good wheat beer. The mouth feel was a little light. The flavor was again light with a light spiceyness and a hint of clove on the finish. The aroma was German Weiss beer. The flavor was American Wheat beer."
"Not the greatest of beers, but worth what I paid. I can't wait to try out some more Weihenstephaner brews."
"This doesn't exactly taste bad, but oy, the bananas! There's no way I could drink more than one bottle of this stuff. If you love bananas, then here's your drink. Otherwise, steer clear."
"Not very complex, but a nice refreshing beer."
"Pours a crystal clear gold color with an excellent head and a respectable amount of lace. The smell is a bold mix of bananas, lemongrass and cloves. The taste is of bananas, cloves, some other herbs, bubblegum from the yeast and a great hop bitterness in the finish. The hoppyness is definitely more pronounced than any weissbier Ive tried, Im not sure if this is a kristal thing or a Wehenstephan thing, but its definitely a thing. The mouthfeel was surprisingly fullbodied for such a light looking beer (like a lager really). It wasnt as crisp as Schneider Weisse, which is unexpected considering it has no yeast in it. A nice beer but I prefer the hefes more."
"Pale golden with lotsa chunks floating through it. Lots of white frothy head. Some beading going on with the carbination. Scented like a gueze, lightly soured and slightly musty, -like a good wine cellar. Very light mouthfeel- so feather-light and gentle, so soft. Not creamy. Just... there. Same with the tast, not much is jumping out with the flavor, this is so very balanced. Some light malty flavors, but barely. Kind of like a watered down saison maybe... The more it warms, the more the flavor devolops in here. Easy drinking since it is so mild. But if you are searching for flavors, you may find this one lacking."
"Beer is good. Happy exotic beering."
"Weihenstephaner's hefeweizen is possibly my favorite German wheat beer, and while the kristalweiss does not quite match up to it, it's still a very good, very drinkable beer."
"A different type of wheat beer. Wheat smell, taste but not creamy on the tongue, rather drops and powder texture. Malt, lemongrassy and cloves and banana and yeast. Light gold and white head that settles in. A natural carbonation.Lightly bitter. Not my flavours."
"Price: 1pint $4.99"
"This beer poured a light golden color with a large foamy white head. Lots of bubbles racing to the top and good amount of lacing. The smell is more yeasty than I would expect and had some citric qualities to it. I could tell that this would be a crisp, clean beer just upon smelling it. The taste had a citric sweetness upfront with wheat undertones. Banana and clove come forward with the yeast. Long, dry finish. Very crisp and clean. This beer is great to have cleanse the palate while eating or just to enjoy in the summertime. I love this brewery."
"Maybe I lose some B vitamins but this is a very good summer beer."
"I did enjoy this beer. It served its purpose as a thirst quencher effectively, and overall it wasn't heavily flawed. In a sense this was like a ""hefe-light," while still maintaining many of the qualities a wheat beer with yeast would have."
"It poured a medium wheat yellow with a lot of white foam. The smell of spices and wheat filled the nose. The taste was of wheat and spices, especially the taste of cloves was evident. An effervescent and refreshing beer, with little of the bavarian wheat fruit and spicy character."
"Great to see Weihenstephaner in Australia, even though its only the Kristal. Having said this, this is a nice Kristal. Still has those fruity banana esters of the regular heffe, and still a huge cloveyness. Really smooth, soft, and manages to cover most corners of the palate quite nicely, tart flavour, with some welcomed saltyness. Nice one. Definitely one of the better kristall weissbiers i've had."
"I won't likely buy this again."
"Good, but I really enjoy the full flavours of the hefe, yet still an enjoyable beer."
"Good mouthfeel, and drinks brilliantly on a hot day."
"The head was thin for the style and faded quickly on the so clear and pale golden color body. Big bubbles. Very nice smell: wheat, yeast, banana, and a hint of something roasted. Very sweet. Slightly iodated too. The taste revealed more citrus than one could expect from the smell. Very sweet, almost artificial candy-like. Banana and wheat. Mouthfeel is very clean and kind of light. Watery. The aftertaste is of subtle fruity hops. Drinkable but not overly complex."
"The mouthfeel was crisp. Some wheat and yeast lingered for a moment after swallowing. Very drinkable as this is extremely light and refreshing with a nice flavor."
"A nice beer, although I prefer a non filtered wheat, its still very drinkable and refreshing"
"Perfect day for this beer. Hit about 80 degrees today so I decided to rotate the beer line up quickly. So I decided to crack up this great kristall beer. There was no freshness date on it so I was a little scared that it might not be good, but when I poured out this beer, a huge head developed so my worries were put out quickly. Poured out a nice light golden color, one of a kind. Smell consisted of bananas and pears mostly mixed in with some other light citrus notes with a touch of yeast. Taste was crisp and clean. Soft fruit hit the palate gently mixed with some ever so slight hops towards the middle with some wheat and malt going towards the end. And just like their Hefe, this beer has the right amount of carbonation in it. World class beer."
"This beer is truely a sight to behold. Poured into my Hacker-Pschorr Weisse glass, with a 2 1/2"" head billowing over the top of gold liquid that is not surprisingly ""Kristall"" clear. The visible carbonation is also very beautiful. Cloves, bananas, malt, and a little hops are all present in the nose of this beer. Taste is very malty , with spicy clove flavors making themselves evident again, smooth aftertaste, all the flavors come together to make this a light, flavorful, very drinkable beer."
"Crystal clear (surprising due to the name) and powerfully carbonated, this beer pours a pale straw color with a voluminous white head. Bannanas and clove are evident in the aroma as well as the flavor. Carbonation and spicy hops provide a prickly mouthfeel. Mothfeel is medium, striking a good balance, refreshing without feeling watery. Great beer. Seems to taste cleaner than a Hefe without losing much of the character."
"This brew is a very clear golden color, with a well-crafted white foam head on top. Light malt scent, citrusy. Very crisp clean taste, with some elements of a hefe that im more familiar with, but not all of them . A nice combo of wheat, sweet malt, some fruit tones, not a lot of hops that i can find. Somewhat acidic, somewhat spicy. Overall im quite impressed with this one."
"The hops have a lemony sourness along with the flavor of orange zest. The taste of cloves is fairly potent. A light peppery finish and a taste of coriander provide an interesting aftertaste. It has a dry, refreshing finish."
"Very drinkable brew, good any time any place."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Pours a pale golden color with a monstrous foamy head that expands and stays put in the glass. Wonderful nose of yeast, European hops, and slight astringency. Palate is a nice blend of floral hops, tangy, lemony citrus, and yeast. Very clean taste, a bit thin in the mouth, but definitely lets its presence be felt. Not much aftertaste. A wonderful beer, the standard for its style."
"Appearance: The filtered approach leaves me feeling empty b/c it looks like an average lager not the world reknowned oldest brewery in the world's weiss bier. Filtered golden tone with a nice sized fizzy white head leaves sporadic lacing not bad though. Aroma: Lacks upfront banana and clove tone more two row grain then anything else with a touch of Hallertau hops. Taste: Decent flavor definitely the best filtered weizen I've tasted, does coat the palate with the familiar banana and clove tones but I will admit seems a bit unrewarding. Mouthfeel: Spritzy effervescent carbonation levels, medium to light bodied wheat ale. Drinkability: Is pretty good but hand me a regular hefeweizen anyday, just had the Weihenstephaner on draft at the Sharp Edge awesome stuff."
"poured a straw golden color with a tall white fluffy head. Aromas of malty sweetness, nothing else. Good body to this beer revealing the delicate and quality ingredients found from this brewery. The taste was in suite with the style and the aroma, sweet malty flavors with very little hops, until well after each mouthful. Overall a good example of this style and well worth drinking"
"This nose is just huge. I dont remember it being this big. Its gorgeous, really, and heavy on the yeast which is how I like it. Its the same at the taste. This is a solid 4.5 overall and by far my favorite example of the style that Ive had in the US. Nothing else that Ive sample even comes close."
"What a surprise to find this strange pint bottle at my local beer store just across the Virginia state line. Never heard of this one, but label proclaims ""oldest brewery in the world"". Bottle doesn't look all that dusty and it's been refrigerated out of the sun. Pours an almost clear golden yellow..average head doesn't hang around for the ride. Citrus to the nose. Banana soda immediately comes to mind with the 1st sip. Very satisfying taste as the wheat grain grabs hold. Some sweet malt in the background and some mild hoppy carbonation come forth. This is very drinkable. Had no idea what I had here, but I'll be returning for more of these. A very clean finish makes this an excellent clear weiss. I may rate this one a few notches higher the next time around."
"this pours a wonderful clear gold with a big thick white afro of a head. aromas of bananas, bread and light malt rise up none of them overpowering the other. light malt and citrus flavors come in with the slightest hint of banana, more bready flavor than anything. extremely clean and crisp, oh so refreshing. reminds me of a wheaty pils? this isn't a complex brew, but its clean, crisp and refreshing as hell."
"I think as I love the Hefe from these guys so much, this one came up short. I think I had higher expectations. Exposive headage that nearly consumes the glass, starts things off. Cristal clear with a deep straw color.On the nose sweet bananna malted. Clean and simple in the mouth-very simple and void of complexity or depth. Decent brew, but I'll plop down my cash for this breweries other products before I'll by this one again-just my personal taste mind you."
"Drinkability: If the taste and smell doesn't bother you, this is eminently quaffable. I wonder what the non-filtered version tastes like. Can't wait to try it!"
"Still, nice."
"I'm not a huge fan of many hefe wheat beers (although I do like some), but I find this beer quite palatable as a regular day-to-day drink, rather than as a novelty (e.g. I wouldn't sit and drink 3 or 4 framboise or cherry beers one after the other)."
"Drinkability - very refreshing and enjoyable to drink. A solid thumbs-up here."
"Altogether fresh and refreshing, this beer was a big hit with my companions who gave it a try. A great summer, warm season beer."
"Beer pours with a tremendous head that almost over flowed the glass with only a slight pour. I had to pour this brew extremely slowly down the side of the glass, and even then a great white head formed on top of the brew. The head becomes rocky and eventually dissipates to a perpetual thin lace that is maintained by carbonation that continuously streams from the bottom of the glass. True to its name, this beer is crystal clear with a nice straw color. Malty, wheat aroma is quite noticeable, with only a slight hint of hops. The taste is very clean and crisp with moderate carbonation. The carbonation on the tongue isnt nearly as strong as the appearance would first indicate. Restrained malty sweetness arrives first with a nice wheat flavor. As the beer warms, the malt sweetness takes on more subdued banana and clove characteristics. Theres a crisp, sharp, tart taste towards mid swallow that passes nicely by. Very slight hops in the end along with the malts making one last appearance. The finish is quite short with no real aftertaste. This is definitely a very drinkable summertime brew."
"On a hot summer day, this is one that you should reach for. A light in body and color, clear wheat beer. The taste was refreshing with its subtle banana esters and slightly in the back malt taste. Very little hop taste or aroma to speak of. Finishes with a dry, crisp and clean bready, citrusty taste... all in all a great light summer beer, and a very nice representation of the style."
"Poured a light golden, perhaps a little pale for the style. Aroma is bright wheat malt and a suggestion of clove. Very active, tight carbonation, sharp and tingly on the tongue. Broad wheat malt, a little sharp and acidic, tempered somewhat by the yeast, not strongly phenolic, but suggestions of clove and allspice. Pleasant, but next time I'll reach for the hefe and the additional depth of flavor."
"Feel starts out kinda spirtzy and full textured with a gradual turn into a light bready crisp and clean dry finish. Very drinkable and easy, excellent summer wheat brew to quench down."
"Clear pale gold body with good carbonation, topped by a huge billowing rocky white head. Good hefty dose of banana in the nose. Taste is a bit overly bland: a little hint of the banana, and not a whole lot else. Little or no wheat, hops, yeast, cloves, or anything else I might have expected. Some wheat comes through in the after taste. Refreshing on a hot day, but not satisfying."
"This beer had a large off-white head when it was poured into my glass.This was just an okay beer to me.Nothing all that special in my opinion.I picked up an aroma that reminded me of bananas.Definitely not one of the better German Wheat beers that I have tasted."
"This brew has a mild fruity banana aroma. A very lively pour resulting in a very large off white head that last lasted a fairly long time but left little to no lacing. It's body was a very light transparent yellow orange color. This brew has a mild banana flavor to boot. Mild carbonated taste with little to no after bite. Not enough character in this brew to make me appreciate it fully."
"I had this one in a half a liter glass poured into a weizen glass. It pours a pale, clear, golden color with a 3 finger head. It looks like a pilsener. There is good head retention and lacing. There is a spicy clove aroma present, with a little fruitiness. The taste is spicy up front with some citrus maltiness. It seems to have a lighter mouthfeel than the Hefe, with more carbonation. It has a really great drinkability, and is good if you don't like yeast."
"Drinkability: While this brew is not on the level of it's cloudy and considerably more complex brothers, it's still a fantastic summer refresher. Good stuff from purportedly the oldest brewery in the world."
"In this heat, though, it'll so, but it will be largely forgotten, especially as I down it quickly in order to get at the Weihenstephaner Dunkel Weisse in the fridge!"
"The pour from the brown pint bottle was a very clear, very light straw and an aggressive pour provided a fluffy white head which quickly evaporated into a nice short ring surround the glass. The aroma had plenty of malt with some cloves. The taste featured the cloves with a sweet lingering on the tongue. Although this kristall weissbier had most of the aspects of a traditional weissbier, it is more subtle. I found no bubble gum nor banana in either the aroma or the taste. The bier had a medium mouthfeel and the carbonation dance upon my tongue. I find this a very drinkable beer and would recommend it to all but particularly to someone experimenting with wheat beers."
"Very similar to the Hefe but not as good in my opinion. Crystal clear gold with large snow white head. Filtration seemed to take the body and yeastiness out of it. Therefore lacks the flavor the hefe brings. Almost like a light version of the Hefe. Still a quality brew just not my idea of a classic wheat."
"Cheers to the BA Victory Beer Exchange for the sample!"
"Mmmm, nice spicy smell with a little citrus, a little dust. The front is spicy leading to a fruity middle. The feel is tingly, foamy. Toward the end a slight sour note creeps in. The finish is dry and fresh, getting a little buttery with temperature. I think I still like the Hefe a little more, but this is a great beer: fresh, spicy, subtly fruity."
"This beer poured dark clear(crystal clear) yellow color and formed a huge white foamy head that latticed lace as it slowly, and I mean slowly, subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, hops, cloves and bananas. The flavor was of malt, hops and yeast/bread. The finish was a touch doughy and light. Not as good as the hefe, but not a bad beer."
"The flavor is a bit more balanced than the aroma. There is a whole lot of yeast flavor and bready grains. Citrus comes in a bit to balance. The flavor is a bit toned down from what I would like. I am very surprised at the amount of yeast in the aroma and the flavor despite it not sitting at the bottom of the bottle. The mouthfeel is very crisp. It is light and refreshing which makes it a great drinker. You could surely sit back with a few of these. It may get a bit boring with very little complexity, but it is still a good brew."
"Pours a clear gold, with quite a bit of carbonation racing to the top. Has a big, pillowy white head, that leaves sheets of lace behind. Aroma is exactly as I expect from a weizen style... sweet banana and clove esters, and a touch of herbal hop notes... I wish someone would come out with weizen cologne. Flavor is slighlty more subdued than the aroma... some notes of clove, with just a touch of banana. As the beer warms, you lose more of the esters, and get a more herbal hoppy bitterness. This beer is very clean and smooth, with a light body... another top notch beer from Brauerei Weihenstephan."
"An excellent Wheat. clear and light in color, with a citrusy, clove smell. Refreshing and quenching, and a head that won't quit like most Wheats that are made well.The clove taste is apparant early in the beer and since it is a Krystal there is no yeast at the bottom which makes it clear and not cloudy. A good Krystal from the oldest brewery in the world."
"Pours a clear light golden color with a pillowy white head that slowly dissipates in chucks leaving a rocky lace. Nose is sweet and fruity with notes of ripe banana, vanilla, and clove. Light to medium in body with a good amount of active carbonation. Taste follows the template laid out in the aroma with flavors of creamy banana, spicy clove, and a bit of nutty yeast. Very refreshing and the best of this style Ive ever had. Perfect for a warm spring day like today."
"Delicious. Best of class."
"A great brewery making a great kristall.Brilliant gold color,nice clean looking,fruity with a little mineral in aroma.Nice kind of herbal mineral quality in the flavor,goes down incredibly easy.There is something about the house yeast that imparts a tropical flair to their beers.A great summertime beer but just happened to drink one here in winter,good year around."
"I'll redo this with a fresher bottle next summer. This was a dissappointment and I know it could be better."
"Overall, a very good selection for a warm summer day."
"Probably my least favorite brew from Weihenstephan (that I've been able to find here in the States anyway), but that's not really a slight against it as much as it is a compliment to the rest. About what you would expect out of a Kristall Weizen, very light in color, with a nice clean wheat taste that is light on the palate but with a slight bite to it. Keep in mind when I use the term ""light"" I don't mean it in the ""american light"" sense, this beer definitely has a very solid and good taste to it and would be a perfect selection iof you're not in the mood for anything too strong or heavy."
"The beer pours a cloudless light gold color, the head prestigious in size, the color a dazzling white, and the lace diaphanous sheets that cling steadily to the glass. Nose crisp and clean, malt dominates with light hints of citrus, and maybe a touch of yeast. Malt sweet at the start, with a middling mouth feel, the finish is curtly acidic, the hops purposeful in the spiciness, aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. The delicate balance of hops, malt, wheat, and perfection maybe another word to describe this beer"
"This German kristall weiss pours a clear gold color with a sizeable white head, which subsides quickly. Clarity is excellent, as this is a ""crystal clear"" beer according to the bottle. Steady carbonation is present throughout the duration of the brew. Nose is rather earthy, with notes of yeast and clove making their respective marks. Taste is a touch bland, but still pretty good, with spicy notes and mellow hops. Mouthfeel is rather prickly and carbonated. This would be a near-perfect summer thirst quencher."
"Notes: Drinkable without a doubt with a palate cleansing quality, certainly good drinking and a great lunch time brew. Goes excellent with a cobb salad."
"Like Weizen-crack. Everytime I lay my eyes on a Weihenstephaner my mouth goes to slavering and I imagine myself sinking a hatchet into the melon of the beer store guy and running off with the lot. Profoundly balanced between the sweet malt and phenols and small dose of bittering hops. Each swig has your buds wailing for more. Peppery nose with the slightest hints of strawberry and banana. As tasty a Kristall as has ever been produced. When the Pope is not kicking out stained-glass windows it's likely he's kicking back with some serious German Wheat beers. Get some."
"Golden in hue, w/ brilliant, lager like clarity from the filtration.  Beautiful, persistent, thick head akin to egg whites whipped to a soft peak.  The aroma is comprised of soft banana esters, smooth wheat tartness and hints of bready pilsner malt.  Clove phenol is present at a trace.  Flavorwise, a combination of light wheat derived tartness and graininess is discernible initially, then is ensued by muted signature weizen esters.  Malt sweetness is low and is correspondingly balanced by an equally low hop bitterness, leaving this brew somewhat dry overall.  Although the filtration and lack of protein conducive to viscosity has lightened the body and mouthfeel versus a hefeweizen, this brew retains a quenching, refreshing nature.  Finishes dry w/ a hint of clove ending abruptly.  Although I enjoyed this brew, I prefer my weizens unadulterated.   The filtration diminishes the ester profile and body, yet maintains and perhaps adds to drinkability."
"This brew really is a crystal clear light straw color.  Big rocky white head with nice retention tops the brew.  Really nice nose.  Some wezen characteristics like banana and vanilla, but also a nice scent of belgian-like yeast.  Very solid vanilla and banana tastes on the palate.  Spicy, peppery notes also dance around.  This is a little more subdued in the tastes than a great German Hefe-weizen.  But this is really nice.  I like this a lot.  I haven't had many kristall weiss beers.  I must say that I will be trying more in the future to see how they compare to this one."
"16 oz bottle. The guy at my local beer store loves this one, and always has it in stock. Pours kristall clear, as advertised, with the same big fizzy head as the other kristalls. Nice wheat, yeasty smell, some citrus, then a certain sourness took over. Some very noticable yeast flavors, but again, a very bitter sour finish that wasn't expected. Not as crisp and clean as the other kristalls I have had, and a bit heavier. For some reason the sourness, (maybe stale ?) flavors dominated. I would choose the franziskaner club-weiss over this one."
"What a clear beer.  I figured that it would be, not not this clear, and for a Wiezen!  I don't know how they were able to come up with such wonderful yeast flavors, without seeing the yeast.  Slight banna, clove taste, but more subtle than other Weizens.  Although I liked this beer and found it of amazing high quality, I think I prefer the richer Weissbiers, that have more of a body.  This is a light beer, but packed with lovely flavor."
"A one pint bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner Glass with lemon on the rim->The head pours a initially huge, frothy, white, that is l fairly long lasting. The body is sparkling clear ( filtered wheat) golden. Aroma is moderately yeasty (dough), moderately malty (light bread), with a note of clove and a hint of banana. Flavor is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Overall I thought it was a excellent brew!"
"It has a snappier finish than the hefe. The carbotations seemed to bother me a bit, it gave it too much a a foamy texture (maybe mine was a little too warm) Good for the style, not my type of beer though."
