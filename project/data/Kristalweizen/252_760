The taste threw me.  It has the taste of a almost creamy wheat beer that you would normally expect to be cloudy and unfiltered.  This was a great taste.  Creamy and had a lot of fruit notes.  Very refreshing and I would suggest trying this in the warmer months.","JPowell712","Mar 22, 2015"

It pours a brilliant white head that stays around throughout. The yeast is the ticket here, yielding a big bold aroma like a bouquet of sweet fresh cut flowers.

An absolutely perfect beer for drinking a few pints outside in the warmth of the spring or summertime. It went great with the rich German food I paired it with, but it could go just as easily with something as light as a tuna sandwich. It's beers like this that make me proud of my Bavarian heritage!","plaidowl","Jan 18, 2015"

It is also the first kristal I have had to date, and judging by this experience it will be the last. It feels flat, flaccid and with the usual wheat beer aromas and flavours dulled down almost to nothingness. The style comes across as a low carb beer is to a lager - pretty pointless. Since I can get their hefeweizen for actually less than the equivalent price of AU$68 a case of 24 x 330mL for the kristal, it's a no-brainer.","SmashPants","Dec 07, 2014"

The nose comprises light orange zest, clove, mild banana, and a twinge of caramel.  The taste brings in more of the same, with the caramel character mostly morphing into one of cracked wheat.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a rather tasty and enjoyable kristalweizen, no surprise given the caliber of the brewer.  Good times.","TMoney2591","Nov 21, 2014"
4.19,4,5,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Massive white foamy head - we're off to a great start! Crystal clear (duh) and golden with great constant effervescence. The only less that 4+ attribute was the smell, only because it seemed a little muted with just a fraction of the banana clove coming through, and didn't really pick up while drinking. Taste was thoroughly superb. There's the banana, clove and wheat-y backbone I was craving. All perfectly balanced and way too drinkable.  These things could disappear within seconds of pouring. Body matched the clean clear visual with a light body but still not overly thin. Finish was perhaps a touch on the dry side absent of any aftertaste.","gopens44","Nov 21, 2014"

Lots of lacing is seen when sipped, even ring-like and sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of wheat but doesn't look like one and has some spice in there also of bananas and cloves. The same with the taste with some nice sweetness. Lighter to medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very tasty with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all.

The malt profile is unique in its richness, but it does sing of your standard Weissbier with all of its soured, metallic wheatiness, and watered afterflow.  Residual sugars are also increased, leaving more for the feel than for the taste.

Looks like a pilsner, but has the distinct hefe taste with big banana and spicy yeast. The spice and fruit flavor are mellow though and blend into a refreshing smooth beer. Mouthfeel is bubbly and smooth. Overall this is perfect beer for just about any purpose. I would highly recommend this one.","CTbrew32","Jun 15, 2014"

PALATE: bubbly, beefy body--yet light and fluid; crisp and clean, with an almost medium-bodied presence...TASTE: bubblegum esters front and center; apple, pear and some clove--an enjoyable experience... OVERALL: a fantastic filtered version of the vividly unfiltered offering; a great combination of drinkability and character; champagne indeed! its refreshing zest pairs well with light cheeses and crackers...","dacrza1","Jan 13, 2014"

Taste is consistent with the aroma--banana, clove, and a velvety mouthfeel courtesy courtesy of the character of the yeast and perky carbonation. The appearance is obviously a stark contrast to that of the unfiltered hefeweiss, but the flavor holds up admirably in spite of this. It's noticeably thinner in body and slightly less full of flavor, yet it captures that signature hefeweiss essence. A flavorful and refreshing brew.","MaximalC","Apr 22, 2013"

Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy bright white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pear, banana, clove, wheat, pepper, bubblegum, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast esters with nice strength. Taste of lemon, pear, banana, clove, wheat, pepper, bubblegum, floral, and earthy yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of banana, light fruits, clove, wheat, pepper, bubblegum, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity and spicy esters; with a good amount of robustness; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a crisp, smooth, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic kristall weissbier! Great balance and complexity of fruity and spicy esters; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 06, 2013"

I could drink this from sun up til sun down no worries. the pours is a bright and clear sunshine yellow color with a good two inches of white head. the nose is all the same yeasty banana and spice flavors im used to in their hefeweiss, but there a certain crispness to this one. the flavor is wheat malt on the front end with very little sweetness, and a familiar and refreshing fruity yeast finish. weve been drinking a lot of these kinds of beers lately, since my old lady here really likes that banana flavor. this one has a ton of that, and we both really liked how clean it drinks. one bottle was definitely not enough, but you do have to drink it when its cold. the warmer it gets the more it falls apart. great carbonation and a very light body, maybe a little thin, but I think that's the point here. taking out the yeast really makes this an all day drinker that doesn't fill you up a lick. impressive stuff again from weihenstephaner.","StonedTrippin","Mar 02, 2013"

4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours superbly clear, like ginger ale in color, with yellow straw tendencies. The head is massively smooth and white with tightly packed bubbles. The body is extremely clear with lots of bubbles running up from the bottom of the glass. Lacing is slippery, sticky with fat and thick with walls along the sides of the glass like latte foam. On the nose the beer smells cleanly of wet banana and clove with nice light yeast notes and slight spices from the wheat. The beer tastes similarly bananay with clove notes with slight tingly mint in the aftertaste. The beer begins as clean light wheat malt before opening into heavy banana notes with light clove hints, and slowly closing out into minty lingering. On the mouth this beer is superbly clean with light bubbling prickles. The beer turns slightly syrupy as it moves over the tongue with light to medium body, and it leaves the tongue slightly dry and very clean. Overall, this is a superbly clean weizen beer. I admittedly have never had a kristalweizen before, but as far as I can tell from style descriptions this beer meets them beautifully, marrying clean mouthfeel with the banana and clove flavors of a hefeweizen. A great beer with awesome wheat character.","Maxwell","Dec 08, 2012"

The carbonation looks like wisps of smoke coming up from the tapered bottom of the glass. A huge hand width of shaving cream white head on top that stands on the beer due to the neverending carbonation. That's a good lookin' beer. The aroma coming off of the beer is very similar to the Hefeweizen. Some wheat, banana and bubble gum. Bubble gum/banana flavors, the taste is similar to a Hefe with a little bit more honey malt and grassy hop flavor. Feel is very light and spicy from the carbonation. There is a big difference in the feel. The smoothness of an unfiltered wheat beer is not there. This makes the beer kind of thin. Definitely a tasty, well-crafted beer.

The wheat and barley malts bring a bready taste. The clove provides spicy balance and the banana flavor is also present. Both are milder than in the hefeweizen, allowing the malt profile to shine.

This is a still a good beer, though; I especially like how drinkable it is (which would not have been possible if the yeasts were not muted). This isnâ€™t really a style that Iâ€™ll be too keen to explore, though, due to the large number of excellent hefeweizens out there.

Smells of wheat, spices, and slight banana. Taste is of wheat, spices, and a subtle banana flavor. There is a nice spice aftertaste with each sip.

4.27,6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Perfectly clear, a delicate pale yellow with a thin, white head. Huge punch of banana pancakes leads the aroma, with some solvent notes, a twist of lemon, cinnamon, and clove in tow. Judging from the smell it would be equally at home on the Christmas dinner table as it would be on a beach in the South Pacific. The flavor matches the aroma's powerful banana and clove profile, and adds to it a note of refreshing pineapple, making this at once tropical and Germanic. Smooth and lush with a full, fresh bread finish; bitterness is low, but it is balanced by good attenuation, spice, and a faint, fruity tartness. Very nice - full flavored like a hefe, crisp like a kÃ¶lsch.","soulgrowl","Jul 05, 2011"
4.12,2.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clean golden yellow color with cap of frothy white bubbles. Scent is Fantastic and best described as a blend of white bread and mineral waters - not terribly exciting to read I'm sure but great none the less. Taste mimics scent. Fresh yeasty white bread, light hints of white pepper, clove, mineral water and banana. Lighter side of medium bodied, light creaminess and good carbonation. Very nice presentation of style - enjoy how the filtration moderates the yeast and allows notes of grain and water to stand out.","rfgetz","Jul 04, 2011"
3.68,-8.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: Enjoyable, but a little less satisfaction drinking this one in contrast to the Hefe for me. While it has the mineral quality, and balance, it lacks as much clove, and malt body of the Hefe. Likely it is just the style that is not as enjoyable to me, though I rarely see Kristalweizen's on the shelf either, and this being likely the epitome of the style, may just not be for me personally.","Retsinis","Jul 01, 2011"

There is that wheat flavor with the sweetness coming from the floral yeast, but it's much more subtle on the palate than would be expected. The mouthfeel is much too thin for my liking, but then again I'm a hater on anything that's too thin, but overall this is a quite enjoyable brew.

The flavor boasts the rich and sweet yeast similar to their Hefe but in a dialed down manner. It is very, very light in body and drinks very well.

It's difficult to get a sense of its body because it is hypercarbonated to the point that it erupts in plumes of foam the moment that it touches the tongue.

All that foam released a subdued aroma of bananas and cloves, as you'd expect from a beer of this style. Once it settled back (about 5 minutes, still leaving a good two inches for the ride to the bottom of the glass), it revealed a lovely, shimmery beer with mild carbonation and mild wheat-beer flavor. This makes sense, since it's filtered. Ever so slightly bitter at the finish, with a light body and a fragrant, easy style. Mild and subdued are all over this beer, which is a nice change from more powerful (yet still very tasty) unfiltered wheat beers. If you know someone who is afraid of Hefeweizen, buy them a bottle. You'll have a convert on your hands in no time.","gfreed","May 01, 2009"

The head was some what disappointing, it dissipated quickly and left almost no lacing. However the aroma made up for the lacking appearance. Bananas, strawberries and other ripe fruit make the aroma of this beer special. Light grassy and hay aromas also come through. The flavor is light and subtle. Bananas up front then some nice grassy hops then bananas make another appearance and ends with a grainy crisp aftertaste. This is a light bodied beer that has a nice hop and carbonation presence that makes it quite refreshing. This is the first Kristalweizen I have ever had so I do not have much to compare it to but I would say this is a pretty good beer.

It's a pale gold to yellow with an excellent head. It certainly takes advantage of the glassware. I'll admit that it does look a bit like a boring old lager with a huge head, but as a part of the Weihenstephaner lineup, it shines. In nearly every other category, it's a slightly muted version of the Hefeweissbier. It has the great spiced wheat character and a somewhat drier feel.

Smell is very clean, think subdued hefeweizen and you've got it. Taste is like the smell: a cleaner hefeweizen. Flavors are all similar but less pronounced: banana, apple, some wheat and not a trace of hops. Tasty and refreshing, to be sure. Mouthfeel is excellent, the generous carbonation tickling your tongue until fading to leave a clean aftertaste. Drinkability is likewise exceptional.

After swirling the glass, what lacing is there falls pretty quickly leaving just about nothing on the sides. Smell is banana, pear, and crispy wheat. Some clove and a touch of sweet bubblegum in the nose as well. Aroma seems sharper than a typical hefe. Taste begins with spice and clove followed by light banana. Clean wheat and faint pale malt midway on the tongue. Aftertaste is somewhat dry with a funky sweetness. Very crisp and refreshing light body with a soft feel. Carboantion is very steady in the mouth which seems to fit this beer and style very well. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. Unique beer for sure, one I would like to revisit again down the road.","BeerTruth","Jul 29, 2008"

I was able to conclude that it was German weisbeer. The appearance was fantastic, very light golden in color with plenty of carbonation. The bubbles seem to be infinite. After a couple of glass fulls I was still confused as to the unique ingredient. It wasn't until I began to read the reviews that I learned that banana seems to be the main influence here. Interesting to say the least it is an extremely unique beer. So far I can take it or leave it. Of course it is the middle of winter in Ohio so perhaps I will re-visit this one when it is at least 70 degrees outside and I can sit out on my deck and feel refreshed.","kinger","Jul 29, 2008"

Very fresh, fruity aroma rounds out the hearty pilsner malt flavor. Low on the bananna-clove character but bold with a lemony, orange, pineapple note that allows the herbal hop flavor to rise a bit. The filtration has lessened the intense hefe flavors, but balance well. Textures are also less creamy, but very easy to drink-- far from watery, grainy, or vegetal.

The beer is golden colored, good clarity, lots of bubbles and a thick creamy poofy foam. The smell is classic German weizen, bananas and so forth, very nice.

I poured this one into an Erdinger Weizen glass, which resulted in a nice large white heading, and a coloration that truly looks like champaign. Tiny air bubbles raced towards the top of the glass throughout. Smell had some spicy character, but also had some fruit such as pear. Again, a champaign aroma comes through, which makes it seem similar to a Tripel. Taste starts off with pears, then ends with crisp green apple, leaving the palate feeling a little dry. Carbonation was right on par with this one, making this one really refreshing. Keep in mind to let it swish around a bit when drinking, as new complexities come through.

Remarkable head retention. Aroma is very appealing. The bananas and yeast don't pull any punches. Lemony fragrances grace my nostrils, as do a little grainy wheat. Taste is typical of the quality of I have come to expect from Weihenstephan. Slightly more refined than their regular hefe weizen, to be expected from the filtering process. Flavor begins mildy acidic, with the bitter lemons up front. Gritty wheat compliments uber-smooth pale malt flavor. Towards the end, the clovey bananas jump up and linger into the finish. Moderate carbonation works well with this style, adding a crispness that even affects the aftertaste. After swallowing, you are left with spicy, sparkling bananas. Very pleasing to the palate.

Restrained malty sweetness arrives first with a nice wheat flavor. As the beer warms, the malt sweetness takes on more subdued banana and clove characteristics.

3.91,-3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The pour from the brown pint bottle was a very clear, very light straw and an aggressive pour provided a fluffy white head which quickly evaporated into a nice short ring surround the glass. The aroma had plenty of malt with some cloves. The taste featured the cloves with a sweet lingering on the tongue. Although this kristall weissbier had most of the aspects of a traditional weissbier, it is more subtle. I found no bubble gum nor banana in either the aroma or the taste. The bier had a medium mouthfeel and the carbonation dance upon my tongue. I find this a very drinkable beer and would recommend it to all but particularly to someone experimenting with wheat beers.","LarryKemp","May 30, 2003"
3.4,-15.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Very similar to the Hefe but not as good in my opinion. Crystal clear gold with large snow white head. Filtration seemed to take the body and yeastiness out of it. Therefore lacks the flavor the hefe brings. Almost like a light version of the Hefe. Still a quality brew just not my idea of a classic wheat.","BierReise","May 22, 2003"

4.27,6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Mmmm, nice spicy smell with a little citrus, a little dust. The front is spicy leading to a fruity middle. The feel is tingly, foamy. Toward the end a slight sour note creeps in. The finish is dry and fresh, getting a little buttery with temperature. I think I still like the Hefe a little more, but this is a great beer: fresh, spicy, subtly fruity.","kbub6f","May 11, 2003"
3.98,-1.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured dark clear(crystal clear) yellow color and formed a huge white foamy head that latticed lace as it slowly, and I mean slowly, subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, hops, cloves and bananas. The flavor was of malt, hops and yeast/bread. The finish was a touch doughy and light. Not as good as the hefe, but not a bad beer.","Wildman","Apr 27, 2003"
3.68,-8.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The flavor is a bit more balanced than the aroma. There is a whole lot of yeast flavor and bready grains. Citrus comes in a bit to balance. The flavor is a bit toned down from what I would like. I am very surprised at the amount of yeast in the aroma and the flavor despite it not sitting at the bottom of the bottle. The mouthfeel is very crisp. It is light and refreshing which makes it a great drinker. You could surely sit back with a few of these. It may get a bit boring with very little complexity, but it is still a good brew.","ElGuapo","Apr 14, 2003"
4.15,3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear gold, with quite a bit of carbonation racing to the top. Has a big, pillowy white head, that leaves sheets of lace behind. Aroma is exactly as I expect from a weizen style... sweet banana and clove esters, and a touch of herbal hop notes... I wish someone would come out with weizen cologne. Flavor is slighlty more subdued than the aroma... some notes of clove, with just a touch of banana. As the beer warms, you lose more of the esters, and get a more herbal hoppy bitterness. This beer is very clean and smooth, with a light body... another top notch beer from Brauerei Weihenstephan.","zerk","Apr 10, 2003"
4.42,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"An excellent Wheat. clear and light in color, with a citrusy, clove smell. Refreshing and quenching, and a head that won't quit like most Wheats that are made well.The clove taste is apparant early in the beer and since it is a Krystal there is no yeast at the bottom which makes it clear and not cloudy. A good Krystal from the oldest brewery in the world.","bierman2000","Apr 09, 2003"
4.57,13.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a clear light golden color with a pillowy white head that slowly dissipates in chucks leaving a rocky lace. Nose is sweet and fruity with notes of ripe banana, vanilla, and clove. Light to medium in body with a good amount of active carbonation. Taste follows the template laid out in the aroma with flavors of creamy banana, spicy clove, and a bit of nutty yeast. Very refreshing and the best of this style IÂ’ve ever had. Perfect for a warm spring day like today.","Morris729","Mar 25, 2003"

4.23,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Probably my least favorite brew from Weihenstephan (that I've been able to find here in the States anyway), but that's not really a slight against it as much as it is a compliment to the rest. About what you would expect out of a Kristall Weizen, very light in color, with a nice clean wheat taste that is light on the palate but with a slight bite to it. Keep in mind when I use the term ""light"" I don't mean it in the ""american light"" sense, this beer definitely has a very solid and good taste to it and would be a perfect selection iof you're not in the mood for anything too strong or heavy.","mikes2923","Jan 10, 2003"
3.87,-4,3.5,4,4,3,4,"The beer pours a cloudless light gold color, the head prestigious in size, the color a dazzling white, and the lace diaphanous sheets that cling steadily to the glass. Nose crisp and clean, malt dominates with light hints of citrus, and maybe a touch of yeast. Malt sweet at the start, with a middling mouth feel, the finish is curtly acidic, the hops purposeful in the spiciness, aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. The delicate balance of hops, malt, wheat, and perfection maybe another word to describe this beer","Gusler","Dec 02, 2002"
3.75,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This German kristall weiss pours a clear gold color with a sizeable white head, which subsides quickly. Clarity is excellent, as this is a ""crystal clear"" beer according to the bottle. Steady carbonation is present throughout the duration of the brew. Nose is rather earthy, with notes of yeast and clove making their respective marks. Taste is a touch bland, but still pretty good, with spicy notes and mellow hops. Mouthfeel is rather prickly and carbonated. This would be a near-perfect summer thirst quencher.","Jon","Nov 06, 2002"

4.8,19.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Like Weizen-crack. Everytime I lay my eyes on a Weihenstephaner my mouth goes to slavering and I imagine myself sinking a hatchet into the melon of the beer store guy and running off with the lot. Profoundly balanced between the sweet malt and phenols and small dose of bittering hops. Each swig has your buds wailing for more. Peppery nose with the slightest hints of strawberry and banana. As tasty a Kristall as has ever been produced. When the Pope is not kicking out stained-glass windows it's likely he's kicking back with some serious German Wheat beers. Get some.","inebrius","Oct 05, 2002"
3.83,-5,4.5,4,3.5,3,4.5,"Golden in hue, w/ brilliant, lager like clarity from the filtration.  Beautiful, persistent, thick head akin to egg whites whipped to a soft peak.  The aroma is comprised of soft banana esters, smooth wheat tartness and hints of bready pilsner malt.  Clove phenol is present at a trace.  Flavorwise, a combination of light wheat derived tartness and graininess is discernible initially, then is ensued by muted signature weizen esters.  Malt sweetness is low and is correspondingly balanced by an equally low hop bitterness, leaving this brew somewhat dry overall.  Although the filtration and lack of protein conducive to viscosity has lightened the body and mouthfeel versus a hefeweizen, this brew retains a quenching, refreshing nature.  Finishes dry w/ a hint of clove ending abruptly.  Although I enjoyed this brew, I prefer my weizens unadulterated.   The filtration diminishes the ester profile and body, yet maintains and perhaps adds to drinkability.","marc77","Sep 24, 2002"
4.47,10.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This brew really is a crystal clear light straw color.  Big rocky white head with nice retention tops the brew.  Really nice nose.  Some wezen characteristics like banana and vanilla, but also a nice scent of belgian-like yeast.  Very solid vanilla and banana tastes on the palate.  Spicy, peppery notes also dance around.  This is a little more subdued in the tastes than a great German Hefe-weizen.  But this is really nice.  I like this a lot.  I haven't had many kristall weiss beers.  I must say that I will be trying more in the future to see how they compare to this one.","Bighuge","Aug 08, 2002"
3.73,-7.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"16 oz bottle. The guy at my local beer store loves this one, and always has it in stock. Pours kristall clear, as advertised, with the same big fizzy head as the other kristalls. Nice wheat, yeasty smell, some citrus, then a certain sourness took over. Some very noticable yeast flavors, but again, a very bitter sour finish that wasn't expected. Not as crisp and clean as the other kristalls I have had, and a bit heavier. For some reason the sourness, (maybe stale ?) flavors dominated. I would choose the franziskaner club-weiss over this one.","StevieW","Jun 19, 2002"
3.95,-2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"What a clear beer.  I figured that it would be, not not this clear, and for a Wiezen!  I don't know how they were able to come up with such wonderful yeast flavors, without seeing the yeast.  Slight banna, clove taste, but more subtle than other Weizens.  Although I liked this beer and found it of amazing high quality, I think I prefer the richer Weissbiers, that have more of a body.  This is a light beer, but packed with lovely flavor.","AaronRed","Mar 26, 2002"
4.1,1.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A one pint bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner Glass with lemon on the rim->The head pours a initially huge, frothy, white, that is l fairly long lasting. The body is sparkling clear ( filtered wheat) golden. Aroma is moderately yeasty (dough), moderately malty (light bread), with a note of clove and a hint of banana. Flavor is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Overall I thought it was a excellent brew!","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 10, 2002"
4.3,6.7,4,4,5,3,4,"It has a snappier finish than the hefe. The carbotations seemed to bother me a bit, it gave it too much a a foamy texture (maybe mine was a little too warm) Good for the style, not my type of beer though.","mattmaples","Nov 21, 2001"
