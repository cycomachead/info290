2.26,-32.7,3,2,2,3,2.5,"Light gold, almost light brown in the glass. Did look quite largerish. Ok head hangs around a while. Nose is true to type with some spice and clove, although a little subtle. Palate is ok - I can see the wheat beer character trying to emerge very early with some nice spicy and sweet notes but just fades to a thin, no descript finish. I’ve seen worse examples but this is no excuse to not chase the real thing.","Stew41","Jul 20, 2011"

4.25,26.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"I must admit, this is the beer that enabled me to finally appreciate how good beer could be. I lived in the Perth/ Freemantle area for a number of months in 1999. Although i had drank plenty of it, before that time i wasn't much of a beer drinker. Until one late June day that i stumbled into the local Kalamunda (its a town) liquor store and decided to sample some beer other than those i had before. (i spent my first month there deciding my personal winner in the ever long struggle between VB and EB- congrats EB) Redback was my first choice, being from Louisiana i could appreciate the poisonous spider salute, and i was bitten at first sip. This beer has a excellent color to it light golden yellow it practically exudes wheat. Clear as day, it was something i wasn't used to only being familiar to yeasty hefe-weisen. Truly liquid bread. Upon smelling it i was delighted by the balance between the clove and banana esters. Most Australian wheats that i tried were without a doubt on the far banana side i assuming as a result of the climate. This one was different. Its makeup was surprisingly smooth; with a light mouthfeel this beer is extremely drinkable. Its taste is nice and wheaty with subtle light malt aftertones. And the hops! Now, i know that many folks say that the high alpha hops grown in the southern pacific region tend to be too ""dirty"" tasting, but i am a firm believer in their earthy, spicy bitterness. In this beers case they should have Pride in the Ringwood (sorry : ) but the Saaz hops used in addition to the australian hops lends to a nice mild spicy bitterness. In hindsight this is the ultimate beginners wheat beer, not that it won't stand up to many of the worlds great wheats. Three cheers for one of Australia's first great craft wheat beers!","Kuemmelbrau","Dec 05, 2007"
4.03,19.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"very enjoyable. wonder if this is brewed down the road at cascade?? bottle doesnt mention anything like that, but this certainly seems fresh.","joecast","Oct 27, 2007"
2.5,-25.6,3.5,3.5,2,2.5,2,"I've tipped the rest of this out, but I'm sure there's a big demographic of people who will enjoy this. As far as wheat beers go, I'll stick to German hefeweizen's.","rec","Aug 26, 2007"
3.63,8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This one is Australian's attempt at a typical wheat beer style brew. I got the Redback together with my bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale from Beercellar. I was a little curious about this one as I am a fan of wheat beers, be it Belgian or German. The Redback pours out a little surprisingly; it was a typical bright golden pilsner color that is ""see through"" as opposed to the cloudy and murky hefeweizens. The head was a little more bubbly than the usual Hefeweizen or Witbier heads and mild retention on that one. The smell was wheat malts and yeast; taste was also somewhat along those lines but significantly stronger on the malts with some spices and there was also a bananna tone peeking out towards the finish. The slightly dry finish move into the after taste which was initially dominated by banannas then apples and finally the familiar grapes. The malt backing was present all the while and the after taste was fairly strong and lasting. The mouthfeel was between thin and medium for the body with an apt amount of carbonation and the smoothness was the water smoothness rather than creamy smoothness that many of the european witbiers exhibit. This one's not bad but in view of more readily available German Hefes and Belgian Wits, I will pick those.","basica","Aug 03, 2007"
3.6,7.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I have heard bad things about this beer in the past, but after drinking, I don't believe them (and think they probably came from lager swillers who were scared by something different). As far as I can tell, this is a solid, highly drinkable wheat beer. Price is decent, as is the quality. There are tastier, more interesting what beers out there, but not as readily available or for this price in WA.","LittleCreature","Feb 26, 2007"

3.53,5.1,3.5,3,4,4,3,"I really enjoy this brewery, they seem to be on the ball with all of the beers i've had so far. This one poured a decent enough looking orange color with a small white lacing. Smell was of cereal grain, some sugars here and there, not much else. Taste was pretty good, very hoppy with some biscuit notes. Mouthfeel was probably the highlight of this beer, as it was very crisp and refreshing. Although this beer would be great for a hot summer day, I don't know if I would get it again. It wasn't a bad beer but perhaps a bit boring. Happy Trails.","jamie2dope","Dec 26, 2005"
3.47,3.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear pale gold colour with a large white bubbly head. Some retention. Aroma is appetizingly lemony and wheaty. Tastes of refreshing citrus fruit (lemon), malty wheat and barley, some banana and has a crisp finish. Light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Good West Australian beer and definitely best without the lemon that's usually squashed in the neck of the bottle over the bar.","ohitsbrad","Dec 04, 2005"
2.8,-16.7,2,2,3,4,3,"Pours a nice golden color with absolutely no head. Smells slightly of yeast and esters and not much else. The taste is estery and a very sweet. Pretty much par for the wheat beer course. The mouthfeel is very creamy and heavy, very nice. It's fairly drinkable, it's sweet, with just enough bitterness to balance it out. I don't mind it, but I probably won't be buying it again anytime soon.","Kulrak","Nov 25, 2005"
