"D: This is certainly not the worst beer I've ever had. I tried it due to my lack of experience with the style. I wouldn't turn it down if offered, but I think I'll stick to the unfiltered weizen from now on."
"This brew pours quite nicely with a golden clear body and a decent head that sticks around for a bit. The aromas are mostly dominated by fruity esters and lemon drop. The taste is bready and lemony with a smooth crisp feel. This is not a bad interpretation of Kristall."
"Pours a dark straw color with a large white head and lots of carbonation. It appears to be a more solid brew than most kristal weizens. The smell is of citrus, and, like the appearance, is richer than can be expected in this style. Unfortunately, the taste does not live up to the appearance and aroma. The taste is like citrusy carbonated water with foam in it. The mouthfeel is thin. Perhaps, my expectations were set too high after seeing and smelling this beer. Afterall, kristals are not known for big flavor, but this beer was still hard to finish."
