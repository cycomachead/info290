"This is a proper beer. Not exactly ""Mexican"" but a very accurate representation of a great German style. I really didn't expect this to be so good and it makes me wonder how many good beers this brewery could produce if it had the market here in Mexico. This beer and Noche Buena are my favorite beers in Mexico. And the price (converted to about $1 a bottle in late Feb 2015 in Xalapa) makes it a go-to when I'm craving a well-crafted beer in a sea full of Tecate and Corona."
"This is the only industrial weizen in Mexico and that´s good, not a very good one compared to craft or imported but it´s something."

"But I also feel it is not a real wheat beer, like they probably used 10% wheat grains and called it a wheat beer. But feels like as if the company has no idea how to produce wheat beer at all."
"A passable beer. A little better than the standard Mexican macros, thanks to the wheat, but not much better."

"O = A pretty refreshing beer. For being a Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma beer it is actually not that bad. Right now it's around 90 degress here and after playing basketball it is a good beer to have. It taste very refreshing."

"Overall no real yeast influence, just a fruity and easy drinking warm weather brew."
"M: Well, it is refreshing that is nice and it could be according to the stile."

"O: This is actually definitely some steps up from a generic no-beer-ingredients-macro. However, I think the execution is a bit suspect. I really don't understand the flavor profile of this beer, and it really seems unnecessarily soapy. The mouth feel really isn't bad on this beer, but there seems to be an odd relationship between the duration of the flavors and the light drying body of the mouth. I want to like this beer, as it's really not so bad at all, but at the same time it wins me over in no category. It will just have to settle for simply ""better than macro", but far too mediocre to be considered anything else."
"Carbonation is high, makes a refreshing drink. It's super light all around, but the taste is good enough to make it worth your summertime while."
"O: Pretty good, was excited to find it down in Mexico, not sure if this offering makes it to the US or not, but would pick it up again."
"I'd stick with regular bohemia which at least has some noticeable hops in there."
"D: Excellent for lunch or hot summer nights, i hope CCM sell this one all the year."
"I pray that Cervercería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma continues to produce this one."
"Drinkability: Good for a mexican macrobrew."
"¡Salud!"
