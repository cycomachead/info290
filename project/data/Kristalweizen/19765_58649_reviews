"Overall:  quite refreshing indeed.  While the graininess is just a tad harsh up front, the wheaty character really smooths out the finish.  Quite drinkable, but otherwise unremarkable."

"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a light, clear straw amber with a fine half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, wheat, light lemon and a hint of banana. Flavor is wheat, mild biscuit malt, light lemon and banana with a biscuit wheat finish. Starts slightly sweet, finishes semi-dry. Light bodied, but peppery carbonation creates a pleasant mouth feel. A nice weizen style beer that's great to have fresh from a brewery. I lean more towards unfiltered wheat beers, but this has lots of wheat flavor and nicely subtle citrus and fruit flavors. Flavor is a bit on the light side, but a refreshing light wheat beer I will revisit again."

"Very drinkable and a good thirst quencher."
"This is a very refreshing and tasty beer. The pilsner malts give it a little body and the finish is smooth. Great for a hot day or if you just want something light. I easily drank a 20oz glass before I knew it."
