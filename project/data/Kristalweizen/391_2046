3.09,1,2.75,3,3.25,3,3,"Can poured into a shaker pint glass, a pale straw yellow with billowing white bubbles, exactly as I remember this beer from my grad school days when it was a staple at the pub, complete with horrid citrus wedge floater. None of that this time, although after concentrating on this beer's flavor I can kinda understand where the urge to apply further seasoning comes from. Aroma is sweet and buttery, more so than its counterpart Big Rock Velvet Fog, with a saccharine fruitiness that recalls fermented apple juice, faint lemon and lime rinds, and white bread barley malt ... No real wheat spice on the nose although there is more of this on the palate, with apple and faint lemon starting things off and musty white peppercorn spice showing up late, along with a little root cellar funk and metallic notes. Thin, fizzy yet with a diacetyl slickness, and generally unoffensive and easy drinking. Finishes semi-dry. I prefer Velvet Fog, which has more wheat character and a more assertive flavor period, although with this style of beer we aren't expecting anything too robust. I have a few more cans squirreled away for a sunny day.","CalgaryFMC","Beers"

There are no off flavors present, but there's so little flavor here it would be hard to get it wrong. This is just another example of an pseudo-micro brewery product that would lend itself a hand in the rating department if it was marketed under the proper style; that is, a lager. It's because of beers like this that people are getting the wrong idea about craft beer. Oh, and insert generic and obligatory 'it's a step above Bud but nothing special' comment here.

Clean, but bland and devoid of character to the point of being insipid. It feels thin and watery with a light body and low carbonation.

While light and excessively easy to drink, it is by no means unenjoyable. If I was in a meat market beer bar, I'd order this over other macros.

The taste was that of a hefe with subtle banana flavors. Flavorful with elements of fruits and citrus/lemon while still having bread & grain characteristics underneath. Good texture with the carbonation; refreshing and engaging. Good drinkability, had a few of these without a problem.","jaluria","Feb 03, 2006"

Big Rock Grasshopper Wheat Beer is most definitely a brew that you'd have while enjoying the company of friends in the dead of summer; perhaps out by the pool or on the patio. Multiple drinks are the name of the game, and while Grasshopper is far from an ideal in terms of representing its' style, its quite tasty, and no doubt a catalyst in good times. If only for that reason, then, it's worth a try.","headlessparrot","Nov 19, 2005"
3,-2,3,3,3,3,3,"Rather weak looking pour, nothing like the beautiful violent carbonation I've seen in this style before. Head subsides quickly to nothing, with not much lace to speak of. I find that a lot of Big Rock's beers tend to pour rather weakly and then have good zip in the mouth...we'll see. Smell is a bit sour, obscuring the natural pear/banana notes i'm hoping to find. Taste is nicer than the smell though. Good, wheaty/bready malts, banana, sour notes after. Taste weakens quickly and feels thin, slides down real easy. This is a pretty clean and refreshing beer, but not very exciting. A straight average offering from Big Rock.","trevorwideman","Oct 11, 2005"

The beer came in a mug with a lemon wedge already there, the filtered appearance saddens me with the golden orange tone of the beer and fizzy thin white head, leaves behind some specks of lace. Aroma: A nice citrusy zing doesn't have any of the great yeast characteristics I have come to enjoy from the German hefeweizen, but it's not bad sharp sweetness decent. Taste: The flavor is a spritzy mix of sweetness and citrus tones but a bit bland, when I added the lemon to my beer (which I never do) it actually improved this one. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body with very fizzy carbonation, not bad but again I was looking for a fluffy textured hefe.

3.62,18.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"This poured with very minimal head, and one which disappeared very quickly, leaving only the least bit of lace. In appearance it resembles a classic Pilzen type style: it is exceptionally clear. The colour is honey, with faint hues of yellow. A grainy, lemony smell greets the nose at first. Slight sourness. Some very slight flowery hop aromas exist. Appetising. The taste is definitely wheat-filled, producing a strong grainy feel on the palate, with a pleasant citrus note in the middle of the tongue. The hop presence is subtle, yet well-balanced. Initially on the tongue one can sense the slight sweetness and delicate sourness so highly beloved in wheat beers. The drinkability of this brew is exceptional: it can be quaffed easily, and has enough flavour to mildly please knowledgable drinkers. No, it is not overly complex, or even exciting, but it IS highly refreshing and drinkable. It would probably be a good beer to start some sewage-water beer drinker off on the road to better beer drinking.","Cwrw","Oct 13, 2003"

Hey, this is a wheat beer, no? Unfortunately, I didn't taste that much wheat. It was more like an above average pilzner. A little disappointing. Granular mouthfeel, slightly oily.

It pours out a darker golden hue, with a big white head, which dissipates after a couple of minutes, and then leaves a bit of a lace. Nose is sweet and citrusy, and the flavour matches that, a bit crisp as well. Smooth mouthfeel, I can drink a lot of this stuff, and that's not just a hypothetical statement. Not exactly a traditional weiss beer, but a good stepping stone into the style for those who are apprehensive at first. Also my favorite beer to ween people off of macros at first.
