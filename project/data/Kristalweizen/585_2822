3.02,-17,3,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Poured a medium yellow with a large white frothy head that was mostly diminishing and had poor lacing. The aroma was strong of yeast, light flowery hops and a straw malt with notes of banana. It tasted very light with the flavor being very yeasty and slightly bitter in the beginning and mellowed to a mild yeast flavor with a hint of banana and some spice. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall an OK light kristall weisse.","KajII","0"

2.48,-31.9,3.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,"This is the first Kristalweizen that I have ever really attempted to evaluate, so here it goes. It pours a clean, golden color that is very similar to a Helles with a head that is much smaller than the normal Weissbier. The smell is rather neutral and seems kind of like a light Weissbier. The taste I thought was rather skunked with some very faint traces of fruitiness. The overall mouthfeel though is pretty smooth, but this can't really compensate for the taste. Easy beer to drink, not so simple to enjoy.","germanbeer1","Aug 24, 2008"

3.53,-3,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Taste is wheaty-- lightly tangy and sweet with a nutty touch-- plus the barest hint of ripe banana, with a slightly powdery dry finish. A light body with lively carbonation makes it a very light drink easily quaffed.","cvstrickland","Feb 10, 2008"
3.35,-8,4,4,3,3.5,3,"D - I could drink a few of these for sure, but it isn't very interesting. If I was itching for a flavor like this, I'd probably reach for a Czech or German pils anyway.","PatrickJR","Dec 01, 2007"
3.85,5.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Very light and clear straw color with a white, rocky, creamy, thick head. Aromas of baked apples with cinamon and brown sugar followed by bubblegum. Flavor is a slightly subdued version of the aroma, except the addition of a mildly tart wheat bite. The mouthfeel is lighter than a regular hefeweizen due to the filtration, yet this one seems to have more flavor and elegance than other Kristalweizens. Finishes with some firm pilsener malt and a touch of apples. This bottle is only the second Maisel's Kristall I've had, fifteen years after the first one in Germany. I just picked it up tonight at a Harris Teeter, because I haven't seen it in so long, and I immediately thought of the fun night so long ago when I had my first one. Fresh too.","dedrinker","Nov 17, 2007"

3.63,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"500 ml bottle. Very pale golden colour, pours an enormous and vigorous head that will accompany you forever. Aroma of banana and cloves, as one can expect of the style, and the same goes for the taste, with some lemon flavor. Clean and smooth beer, refreshing, very drinkable, but I like more the non-filtered versions of this kind. Body is lighter than not filtered ones and it doesn't give you that feeling of full stomach that non filtered gives.","janubio","Apr 28, 2007"
3.23,-11.3,3.5,3,3,3,4,"Ok now this was a somewhat abnormal pickup for me, well not really in the sense of the style, just that I normally would not have picked this up at this time of year, but whatever, I love them so go for it right. Poured a vigorous pale golden yellow with a huge head of fizzy white lace, took several pours before the entire bottle could be released in a very tall glass. Lots of carbonation was apparent from the start through the absolutely flawless crystal clear nature of it. No sediment and no haze at all. Head settled down to just a thin film and that lasted throughout, but leaving copious side lace. Smell was very light, almost non existent at first but then some nice grain aromas broke though with a touch of yeast to add. Light flavor as well, just a nice light wheat flavor is really all that can be said about it. Mouth feel was again very light with ample carbonation it went down like water. Huge session ale here, this had all the earmarks of a hot summer day in the backyard brew. Overall not the best I have ever had but nowhere near the worst. An average Hefe is better then a macro any day, and this was no exception, a fine, but average selection.","mikesgroove","Dec 17, 2006"
4.47,22.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drank a bunch of these in half pint handles at the Germania Club in Newcastle. Poured crystal clear with a nice head laden with phenolics. Immediate and intense banana aroma that was like a banana malt milkshake. The taste had perfectly balanced banana/malt/clove that was consistent to the end. I can't say how it stacks up against Weihenstphan and others without side by side tasting but this Maisel gives seriously good competition. We had this with Schlattesplatte and mustard bread and there was much merriment. Brilliant!","rjimlad","Dec 05, 2006"
3.95,8.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured a huge, smooth, bright white head leaves a few thick strands of lace. I wasn't sure what to expect in from the aroma, but I got some nice banana and bubble gum. Maybe it's just the light golden color, but the flavor seems to be a toned down version of a Hefe. Sounds about right for the style so far. Light, almost crisp flavors of bubble gum and a bit of zesty wheat and lemon towards the finish. A little flavor hangs around through the finish tempting me to take another sip. Light, soft mouthfeel with a bit of fine fizz as I swallow. A delicate weizen. Not for those looking for a beer bursting with flavor, but then that's not a bad thing either.","HappyHourHero","Aug 24, 2006"
3.96,8.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Filtered to within an inch of its life, pours like a perfect wheat, rich burnished gold with a creamy white head though slightly coarser than I'd like. Buttery bananas on the nose that carries through to the flavour along with a hint of caramel. Carbonation is moderate and mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Quite refreshing but perhaps a little too aged.","goodbyesoberday","Feb 27, 2006"

3.72,2.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear golden color with a large head. Head retention is pretty good. Smells malty with banana notes. Hints of banana and cloves come out in the flavor. Plenty of bready malts too. There is a good amount of carbonation and a light-medium body. Everything I look for in a German wheat beer is there (minus the yeast). A very German and tasty wheat beer. I ussually go for the unfiltered-wheat beers, but I did enjoy this beer and it goes great with any heavy meal.","Luigi","Sep 16, 2004"
2.89,-20.6,2,3,3,2.5,3,"Pale sunshine gold, shining, all clear. 1cm white head. Big banana bouquet, bready crisp wheat. Obvious banana taste, sweet/tart combo works rather well. Not much to seek further into. Lively carbonation, thin body. This is so simple it's not very funny, I wouldn't think there's a market for this, but it's worth trying one.","Rastacouere","Beers"
3.57,-1.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"50cl. bottle: This one pours a clear, golden color. There was a fairly large white frothy head, but it did subside quickly. Quite a bit of bubbles in the beer. I get a bit of clove and banana to the nose. A slightly lighter beer, with notes of wheat, banana and a weak spiciness. Maybe a touch of dryness/sourness in the aftertaste. Good, but I¬íll stick with a regular Hefe.","Boto","0"
4.02,10.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Fine foamy head on a light golden and transparent body. The beer¬ís highly carbonated. Very good smell, wheat, banana, citrus and sweetness. Some aromas also remind me of a Belgian triple. There¬ís something very surprising in the taste: first, you get everything you could expect from the smell, a refreshing wheat aspect , a nice banana flavor, sweet hints of citrus, yeast. And then, suddenly, it all disappears. Nothing remains. And then you get a very very thin hoppy aftertaste, but it¬ís quickly gone too. Very drinkable and enjoyable.","tjd25","Oct 14, 2003"

3.23,-11.3,3.5,3,3,3,4,"This beer pours a golden yellow. A thick white head is present after the pour, too bad it doesn¬ít last long. The aroma is a week weissen beer, hints of cloves and bananas, no yeast. The taste is good to say the least. It matches the aroma pretty well. For a Kristall Weisse it is not bad. Maybe a beer for those who do not like the full yeast flavor of the heffe weisse. I prefer the heffe weissen over a kristall any day of the week. Still a good beer for a nice summer evining. A above average beer.","Stubbie1","Aug 09, 2002"
3.47,-4.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear gold. Looks and smells just as if you filtered a Hefe Weizen ;-) Of course Kristal is exactly that. The filtration of the yeast yields a lighter beer and yet maintains some of the flavor characteristics of an unfiltered weisse. Hints of lemon, banana and clove gently interact to create a light and dry but tasty Kristalweizen. Not a favorite style of mine but I could see this doing fine as a summer brew. By and large many US craft brewers model the American wheat style after the Kristall style.","John","Apr 18, 2002"
3,-17.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Sweetsi apricoty flavour, low bitterness. slight acidity, quite light and smooth, not overly interesting, but very drinkable, but quite expensive here in Australia for what you get, Redback is probably better at a cheaper price.","rastaman","Beers"
3.05,-16.2,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Pale yellow, clear and very clean look with medium white head.  Rather large bubbles, head is short lived.  Slight scent of vanilla  and wheat malt.  Very light tasting with little mouthfeel.  Tones of wheat malt and clove but you are left wanting a more profound impact. Overall it is quite drinkable and would be good if eating alot of food.","frank4sail","0"
