Flavor is very bready, with wheat crackers, and apple juice. I like how, with each sip, I get that tart feeling in the back of my mouth near the molars. Like drikning cranberry juice (in the sense of the tartness only). This is all brought down in the aftertaste of band-aids. The band-aids are killing this for me. Crisply carbonated with a moderately light weight on the tongue. This is decent enough, but the weird aftertaste ruins the drinkability on this one.","goochpunch","0"
4.07,10,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a crystal clear fairly deep gold under a two finger white head that recedes every so slowly, with lots of body, leaving lovely sheets of lace. The nose is full of spice and citrus, with clove and lemon the predominant strains. The mouth is well carbonated and fairly heavy, almost sticking to the tongue. The taste is tart, with the lemon dominating. Lots of clove, too, and perhaps a bit of coriander. A touch of bitter hops emerges very late, but the overwhelming impression is slightly sour and very spicey, with a definite touch of wheat. Nice summer quaffer.","Globetrotter","Nov 10, 2005"
4.04,9.2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4," This is a nice, methodical, organized taste. The wheat is subtle but still intregal, and the mouthfeel is slightly overcarbonated but otherwise spot on. This is a good hefe if not such an especially strong one. I find myself missing the sediment but only from a visual perspective as the taste and smell are textbook. Not one of my very favorite hefes but I wouldn't turn this down on a hot day.","daliandragon","Aug 09, 2005"
3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Excellent drinkability here. Much closer to a lager than a Weizen in experience this is a very good choice for when some summer bays you are just tired of HefeWeizen and need a change.","Zorro","Jun 27, 2005"

The nose is nice and aromatic, with banana sweetness and clove. Slight creamyness as wel. The flavor is more mellow than the regular. Banana is more weak, clove is a little more forward. The flavor is clean, very refreshing. The feel is creamy, moderate, where I expect it to be. I am a big hefe fan, so the kristal is another that I tend to enjoy. I think I could drink more of these than the standard franz. I like the way this beer is built.","kmpitz2","Apr 08, 2005"
3.57,-3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer is clean and crisp, nice wheat and citrus flavors, but just a little too carbonated.

Club-Weisse's color is golden yellow, carbonation is moderate, and the head is huge and sticky. The aroma is of an average strength mix of cloves and bananas. Not much different in aroma than the Fraziskaner Hefe. The taste has an initial strong bite of banana-clove which then settles out to a more average level. Overall taste is enjoyably fruity and spicy. Mouthfeel is probably the standout feature of this beer. Club-Weisse is very active and crisp on the tongue. I was expecting this beer to be a lighter flavored version of their Hefe, but I was pleasently surprised with a very tasty and easy drinking beer.","Gagnonsux","Feb 09, 2005"
4.08,10.3,4,3.5,4,4,5,"So crisp and delicious. A fluffy head with healthy carbonation that rose up in lines from the bottom in my tall Weisse glass. Really nice citrusy and tart flavors. Has a light grainy malty taste and sourdough aftertaste.It does have a surprisingly substantial mouth feel for a filtered hefe. This club weisse will see itself on my summer beer roster, and I agree with venom don't ask for a lemon on my watch, it's best when drank alone.","OatmattStout","Jan 11, 2005"
3.78,2.2,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"Interesting. Pours a very light yellow into my tulip glass (all that was clean at the time) with a huge white head that doesn't ever fully settle. Smells were definitely of wheat and french bread, with a wee hint of green bananna. Taste is of wheat, very light freshly baked sourdough, a hint of apple. A bit more complexity develops as it warms, but there's not too much to describe here. This beer is lighter than a hefe-weizen, and looks like an american macrobrew, except for the huge head. A bit too light in taste and texture for me, but the mouthfeel did boast a bit of pepperyness due mostly to the carbonation. Very drinkable, as it is so light. You could easily knock 2 750ml bottles out. Not my favorite, but I suppose that it is good for the style.","kosmoraios","Nov 30, 2004"
4.1,10.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,".5 L bottle. Pours a clear golden with a big rocky head that is almost pure white. Endlessly rising bubbles. Citrus aroma. Solid wheat flavor. Slightly fruity. The high carbonation makes it taste spicy. Fuller mouthfeel than I expected  probably because the color is similar to many cheap American lagers. This is my first Kristall-Weizen, and Im now curious to try other versions.","beveragecaptain","Nov 16, 2004"

Overall, a very satisfying brew with a full taste and an excellent finish.","WTexas","Oct 03, 2004"

3.58,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a brilliant straw color. It is well carbonated and is topped by a thick off-white colored head. The aroma is lightly sweet with a mix of clove, grain, banana, and a bit of hoppy spiciness. The beer is quite crisp up front, it is followed by a soft fruity middle and finishes with a light astringent bitterness. There is some banana and clove notes here, they are a bit muted. This is a nice quaffable beer, nothing to get too excited about, but it is a good quality beer.","Gueuzedude","Aug 26, 2004"

But thats what Kristall Weissbiers are all about, for the benefit of people who wouldnt dream of drinking a beer they cant see through. With Franziskaner Kristallklar they get at least a decent aroma of banana and cloves, the beer is pale yellow and crystal clear indeed, pours with an enormous head.

It goes down easy, but has a lingering fruity aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a low/medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good drinking beer.

3.12,-15.7,3,3.5,3,3,3,"This is the first Kristal-Weizen I've ever tried. Super-clear yellow-gold color, looks like an American Pilsner except with a big puffy head. Smells like grass and lemons, taste was kind of lemony as well and somewhat spicy, but too mild. This beer was OK but just not enough flavor for me, tasted almost watered down. The fizzy mouthfeel and clean finish will slake your thirst, but if I had a choice I'd take their Hefe-Weisse or Dunkel over this one.","PopeJonPaul","Feb 29, 2004"

Taste creamy and crisp full banana and clove yeastiness so good, the sweetness from the malted wheat is very tasty as well and perfect balance with the bittering hops thrown in can't ask much more from a filtered weiss.

4.42,19.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer was received a creamy/cloudy pale yellow banana color, carbonation could be seen through the glass. The head that was produced was a creamy rich white color that was thick and lasted through the last sip. The lace that was left behind was in sheets through the top portion of the glass and then broke off into a beautiful delicate lace in the latter portions of the glass and was very sticky as well. The aromas were fairly simple, fresh yellow bananas, cloves, some wheat and a hint of hops at the end. Very traditional. The flavors that rolled across my tongue were of light wheat tones, some vanilla, fresh picked ripe bananas and cloves, which gave it a spicy finish. There was little aftertaste was light to none. But this was ok. Probably one of the best examples of the style I have had to date. Well balanced, refreshing all rolled into one. A staple for me when I go to this locale restaurant, ask me what I want and I say Franziskaner Weissbeir, and Hurry !","Jarod","Apr 06, 2003"
3.8,2.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability/notes: A very nice example of this style and well within character. Not the best wheat that I have ever had, but certainly worth a try.","Pegasus","Mar 30, 2003"
3.75,1.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"It would be unfair to compare this to any of its unfiltered cousins. I'll admit that this is the first filtered wheat that I've tried. I'm looking forward to trying some more, so I can get a better feel for the style.","Marty","Mar 15, 2003"
3.21,-13.2,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured from the bottle very clear golden with a good white head. My friend was drinking a Bud Light and they were very similar in liquid and head color. The aroma was subtle. The banana/clove smell was present but not very strong. The taste was similar in character. I would suggest that this beer be given to someone experimenting with this style of beer. It has the characteristics of the style but is not pushing in of its aspects.","LarryKemp","Mar 11, 2003"
3.23,-12.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Club Weisse: A crystal clear weiss beer. Huge, thick, pure white beer with substantial staying power, and leaves thick lacing down the sides of the glass. The beer is a pale golden color, and as one would expect, is absolutely clear. The aroma is pleasant, with oranges and bananas. The initial taste is very sweet, almost sugary, that melds quickly into a light weisse beer taste, with emphasis on yeast ( oranges and bananas). The taste is light, and very pleasant, although I’d go with an unfiltered if I had the opportunity.","jackndan","Mar 10, 2003"
3.57,-3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I'm not a huge kristall weiss fan only because it so often tastes like a watered down version of the hefe, and in this case it is a semi-accurate assessment. Obviously it carries the taste of a weiss beer with it's wheat and banana flavor, without the bite of it's cloudier cousins! It's a good solid, drinkable lighter flavored beer... would've been a lot better after a long day in the sun! Hmmm.. maybe for our camping trip next year...... :)","mikes2923","Feb 20, 2003"
3.33,-10,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"I expected a little more complexity with this one,poured nicely golden color with a well retained head.Banana was the dominant smell from what I got.Taste was not very complex a little smokey with some banana notes.Easy to drink but nothing to write home about I think.","oberon","Feb 11, 2003"
3.13,-15.4,3.5,3,3,4,3,"To me this was a overly complex budweiser in a lot of ways. Definitely more craft and taste, but still lacking. It pured a middle of the road golden witha thick white head that did not fade for a long time. The smell was sweet with strong scents of bannana. The taste was more dried bannana as well as some dried apricot flavors. I felt that the mouthfeel was the best part of this brew. It was thick and creamy, which is not what the appearence would have indicated. A decent beer, but not one I am keen on trying again.","GreatPondBrewer","Jan 15, 2003"
3.2,-13.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"I suppose this is the equivalent of a light version of the hefe-weisse. I definitely was not too keen on this beer. Pours a very clear and pale yellow with a good sized head. Very light smell of banana. Not a whole lot of taste going on with this beer. Mouthfeel is crisp, pretty much just like any light-bodied brew. More of a summer beer than anything else. I have a feeling this had been on the shelves for a while - probably did not help matters. You could drink a whole lot of this without much problem, although I don't see myself going back to this anytime within my lifetime.","Admiraldinty","Dec 04, 2002"
3.92,5.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Although maybe more of a summer beer, Im going to review it in January. This one pours a very clear and very pale yellow with a massive pure white head. The aromas of wheat, malt, and light hops make the mouth water. The taste of a pleasant earthy grain and wheat combined with light hops make this one enticing brew. The mouthfeel is that of a light bodied brew and finishes crisp and clean. Very good beer! Prosit!","BeerAngel","Beers"
4.5,21.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear light golden color with a thick and frothy white head that dissipates into a nice lace. Nose is dominated by ripe banana with notes of vanilla and clove. A sweet maltiness comes through in the taste mixed with ripe banana. Light and clean in the mouth with lots of carbonation. Very refreshing and very drinkable.","Morris729","0"
4.28,15.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The taste is refreshing and quite refined it has all the properties of a weiss but the clear body hides some of the taste good in it's own right but nothing like the hefe wiess, good but not great!","Kwak","Dec 02, 2002"
3.92,5.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Bright translucent gold color as it sets in my glass with a prestigious head and oodles of fine lace slipping down the side of the glass after a fresh sip to savor its pleasures. Nose is malt with yeast and citrus aromas, certainly pleasant to the senses. Front is slightly sweet, the top minimal in its mouth feel, the finish somewhat astringent, meaningful in the hop spicy bite, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting. Quite a pleasure to drink and one I sample often, but still like to see the Chill Haze, an idiosyncrasy of mine I guess.","Gusler","Nov 26, 2002"
2.82,-23.8,5,3,2.5,4,2,"As you'd expect, this pours crystal clear, pale straw in color with a hige frothy head. Strong wheat aroma with hints of banana and cloves, though milder than in its full-bred hefeweisen brother. The taste starts off nice, with a good spicy beginning, and a sweet mid-palate. High carbonation lends to a very light feel in the mouth. Hardly any hop bitterness in the finish -- this leaves a rather empty feeling in the back of the mouth, and while the finish is fairly dry, the aftertaste is a bit too sweet for me. I just don't get this style. You take a perfectly good hefeweisen like Franziskaner makes and you take out the yeast thinking what, that it'll make a good session beer? The yeast contributes a lot to the flavor of Franz's hefe, and when you take out that and the hops, you're left with a beer which relies too heavily on sweetness for effect to be anything I'd want to drink a lot of.","mzwolinski","Nov 20, 2002"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Skeptical as I poured it. Almost too light, although cloudy. Good carbonaton. It tasted light, yet oddly satisfying. A good ""quaffing"" beer. It tasted quite refreshing, could be my new ""summer"" brew.","bewareOFpenguin","Nov 16, 2002"
3.4,-8.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"A pleasant enough beer, but it far from impresses me. Is this German Bud??!??! Sorry couldn't resist that.","TheLongBeachBum","Oct 29, 2002"
4.38,18.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Even a gentle pour brings up a huge and pillowy bright-white head. The body is crystal clear and light gold in color - even yellowish when held to the light. Streams of tiny bubbles race to the surface continually reinforcing the head, and adding some ""entertainment value"" to its appearance. The nose is sweetly grainy with a soft ""very ripe banana"" note and a mild and very lightly spicy clove note. It's smoother than the standard Spaten hefe weizen with less actual yeastiness. The body is light/medium and there's a gentle caress on the tongue from a very fine and effervescent carbonation. The flavor starts with a well balanced malt that's gently sweet at first (entwined with some lightly spicy clove) and reveals a moderate bitterness as it crosses the palate. It dries out and cleans up in the finish leaving just a mildly lingering soft banana followed by light clove. The drying balance that makes the Franziskaner weizens so recognizable is clearly present, but this kristal version is lighter in character due to the lack of yeast. But that can be a good thing on a very hot summer day when you plan to have more than a few. Or, particularily for people who's digestive systems don't handle the yeast too well. In fact, I'd like to have one or two on hand to switch up to after having a few mit hefe. Very nice. An excellent beer from one of Germany's premier breweries.","NeroFiddled","Oct 05, 2002"
4.23,14.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This is the best Kristal Weizen I have had.  Franziskaner Club-Weisse is not any better or any worse than a traditional Hefe; it is just different.  If you judge this beer based on the style, I think, you will really like it.  This beer will be recommended to all.","bditty187","Aug 26, 2002"
4.2,13.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"A vast, crowded and fluffy head lays over a pale wheat body. A whopping dose of spicy and peppery phenolics snuggles up to your probing snout. Breathe it in as you drench your buds with a liquid sweetart that at once soothes and dances across your tongue. A brew as suitable for hot Summer days as cool Autumn evenings. A brew that sets you in a Munich Biergarten, where everything is soft edges.","inebrius","Aug 15, 2002"
3.8,2.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Nice medium yellow in color with a nice white tight foam. Nice for a hot summer day. After taste was a bit to short for me. Not a lot of wheat taste, but a hint of cloves and vanilla. Have had it before and still do not put it among my favorites!","BeerManDan","Jul 23, 2002"
3.83,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Crystal clear with a nice foamy white head, this beer is completely filtered.  I have never tried a Kristal Weissbeir, and found this one very refreshing.  It doesn't have the yeasty kick of regular Heffeweizens, nor the banna or clove flavors.  However, it is a great summer beer and drinking this outside in NY when it is 95 degrees, is a wonderful experience.","AaronRed","Jul 11, 2002"
3.5,-5.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very large stiff foamy head over a crystal clear light golden body. Constant streams of bubbles remind of glasses of champagne.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"This is one very good weisse brew.  Nice and cloudy with a great golden color.  One of the better wheat bres I have had in quite some time.  A nice wheat flavor on the tongue.  Extremely drinkable.  Prost!","goindownsouth","Jun 01, 2002"
4.48,21.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"16 oz bottle. Super big explosive head, despite my best efforts of a deliberate pour and wetting the glass. Head fell down the side of the glass forever. Clear straw color and the big white head had me thinking it would be flavorless. Subtle wheat, citrus smells. Very light, crisp wheat taste, although, not like the hefe-weiss flavor I am used to, this is very good. Some familiar banana, clove tastes, unbelievable crisp and dry finish. No sourness that is  evident in some the other kristal wiess I have had. Very, very drinkable. IMO, a summer slammer beer after a round of golf, etc. Although I prefer the big flavors of a hefe-weiss, this is a very good beer.","StevieW","May 17, 2002"
3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Tremendous, monstrous head.  The beer itself is very clear, highly carbonated.  Aroma has distinct wheat characteristics, although I seemed to sense fleeting sour esters.  Taste is immediate soft sweetness.  This is a nice, refreshing wheat beer.","Suds","Apr 23, 2002"
3.29,-11.1,4.5,3,3,3,4,"The extremely dense and persistent head tops a gorgeous golden hued brew. The brilliant clarity is indicative of ample filtration and/or fining agents-- it approaches lager - like clarity.  Banana esters and malt sweetness dominate the aroma, but lemon - like fruit notes hit the nose as well. The mouthfeel lacks the thick viscosity that a traditional German Weiss should have.  The finish is much drier than other examples for style... Crystal Weiss's are an odd style of wheat. Personally I love cloudy, yeasty, and unfiltered Weisses.  Although Club - Weisse is a tasty brew, it left me longin for a German Weisse with more character all - around.","marc77","Mar 24, 2002"
4.08,10.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This is not a hefeweizen. It is a kristal weizen and should be categorized as such on this website. I wonder why it is called ""club-weisse"" in the US. Perhaps to remind the consumer of club soda. That is certainly an appropriate comparison, for it is a thin, light, clear, clean weizen and might surprise weizen drinkers with its resemblance to pilsner/lager/helles/export type beers. It is quite drinkable and eminently refreshing, with wheat characteristics (banana, bubble gum) buried deep down in the brassy, complex taste.","Thrasher","Feb 24, 2002"
