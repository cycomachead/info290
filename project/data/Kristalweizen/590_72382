Aroma is strong pears, wheat, funky yeast, banana, more sweet pears. Very nice. Light mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Tastes like biting into a fresh pear. Hints of cinnamon that do not overpower, but supplement the beer very nicely. Not overly sweet at all and is quite refreshing. Nicely balanced brew that one could drink all night. This is really fantastic.","BMMillsy","Oct 14, 2013"

Malty sweetness comes out strong but settles as other aromas including wheat, spice, banana, clove, and a touch of cinnamon join the party. The pallet experiences many of the typical hefeweizen flavors of banana, wheat, clove, and lemon zest while new flavors of cinnamon and biscuity malt dance underneath. Spot on mouthfeel for the style; medium bodied and highly carbonated. Another New Glarus brew, another rave review - not just a coincidence.","phishsihq","Dec 22, 2012"

This is darker than I had anticipated, but it's a good color to go with the 'Fox' moniker. Sweet aromas stand out. Banana, clove, sugar cookies. Mellow feel. Carbonation is low-to-moderate. Sweet banana bread, mild caramel, clove, bready finish. This was an easy drinker. Sweet beer that was refreshing and uplifting.

Head settled down to just a thin film and that lasted throughout, but leaving copious side lace. Smell was very light, almost non existent at first but then some nice grain aromas broke though with a touch of yeast to add. Light flavor as well, just a nice light wheat flavor is really all that can be said about it. Mouth feel was again very light with ample carbonation it went down like water.

3.92,1.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I keep getting a very distinct aroma of fresh cut green apple slices hovering under the heavy blanket of clove/cinnamon spiced weizen wheat-bready goodness. Also noted, this one is not nearly as heavy on the banana notes in the nose as New Glarus's other weizens typically are. Taste is solidly wheatey and medium-low in yeastiness but really, that is plenty enough to compliment the delicate dry mead and apple tones I keep picking up here and there. In some beers, I understand apple flavors and scents are considered to be an off-flavor, but it fits so well in this brew that I cannot imagine it wasn't done on purpose. Finish is not particularly long per se, but it is enjoyably dry while it lasts. Light in body, really easy to session at 4.5% ABV, but one should take the time to appreciate the tiny subtleties held within.","WastingFreetime","Sep 02, 2011"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Light bodied, slowly effervescent. A Dancing Man Light. A nice quaffer that still rings with the hallmarks of New Glarus' excellent Weizen heritage.","cokes","Sep 02, 2011"
3.93,1.8,5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a snifter, this beer pours brilliantly clear copper with a thick, ample off-white, beautiful! The nose is dominated by bountiful spice and clove yeast character with some sweet malt in the background. The flavor is like the nose, but much more subdued. The yeast character is subdued, yet still noticeable, with some bready, sweet malt in the background. The beer finishes pleasantly dry. Given the wonderfully strong nose I expected more body/mouthfeel, it doesn't need to be chewy, but it just misses as too thin, and this even with a medium-high carbonation. Overall a beautiful, great smelling beer, while the flavor is a bit too subdued and mouthfeel a bit thin, it is a highly drinkable refreshing beer.","uwmgdman","Aug 31, 2011"

3.69,-4.4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O- It's hard to knock this beer but it doesn't measure up compared to some of Dan's other wheats. With that said, this would be a decent substitution for anyone looking for Dancing Man with a lower alcohol content(but who would want that?).","Wisconsinality","Aug 23, 2011"
