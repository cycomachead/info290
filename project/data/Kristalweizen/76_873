3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Comes out of the tap a hazy honey golden with a fine-bubbled eggshell head that leaves some good lacing. Wheaty, yeasty aroma has a strong citrus overtone and is quite inviting. Wheaty flavor has a strong lemony note, more sweet than sour, and a yeasty underpinning. Overall it is quite refreshing, perfect for a sweltering summer day. Fizzy texture has average body and leaves a wheaty and fairly tingly finish. Prosit!","Cyberkedi","Aug 28, 2011"
4.18,8.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall is was a very nice beer, could see it as a session","Brysky","Aug 09, 2011"
3.99,3.6,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"This one is alright. Might be good to finish off an evening with, or as the only drink during a fireplace session. There's something soothing about this beer, and as such, I've gotta give it props.","Lauthaha","Aug 17, 2010"
3.5,-9.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dirty opaque gold. Smells of banana and banana. Taste like a Tropican Twister. The banana one. Got a lip-smackin sticky taste feel to it which is kinda nice. Cloves in the tail. Mild carbonation. Nice change from the heavies I've been drinking.","PatronWizard","Apr 23, 2009"
3.98,3.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I see on the label that it says produced on 04.06 April 06 or June 04? I doubt the latter as this tastes reasonably fresh to me.","Bitterbill","Oct 07, 2007"
4.92,27.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"The flavor of this brew was outstanding as well, with a light malt sweetness in the front and a slight bitterness in the finnish that was excentuated by the great carbonation of the beer. A wonderful drink for sure, very recommended.","Dmann","Aug 23, 2006"

3.58,-7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Much like Hacker-Pschorr's Hefe, there's not much here to criticize, but it doesn't stand out either. Nice, refreshing but undistinguished.","allengarvin","Apr 01, 2005"
2.48,-35.6,3,2.5,2,3,3,"Pours amber with a thin head that drops fast.. Clear (duh). Smell is light fruit and malt. Taste is the same. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly fizzy. Drinkability: Eh. Nothing special, really makes me reconsider my purchase. Should have gone with something else. Well, there is always next time.","PorterLambic","Feb 28, 2005"
3.95,2.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Kristall Weisse is my first kristal weizen and is about what I expected. It's tasty, drinkable beer and is clearly quality made. That said, I still greatly prefer those yeasty, banana and clove-like hefe weizen masterpieces brewed by the likes of Brauereien Weihenstephan and Aying. This one is a bit tame for my tastes, but is good beer nevertheless.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 05, 2004"
4.05,5.2,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This brew has a clear pale gold/straw color, with a volumous cream foam head on the top. Nice wheat characteristics with some lemon zest for the scent. Soft bread, lemon, wheat, banana, spice. Great taste, some acidity on the tounge, hail the german wheat machine.","Tballz420","Oct 03, 2004"
3.98,3.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"All in all a very clean and refreshing wheat beer.","smcolw","Jul 03, 2004"
3.65,-5.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"this pours out a clean and clear golden with a fat white head that leaves behind some nice lacing. the nose is very clean, light, hints of malt and yeast. crisp in the mouth, refreshing and smooth. flavor wise its a winner as well. much sweeter than anticipated with a strong honey character. a little grainy and some yeast is in effect as well (think subdued heffe). slightly metallic and ends on a sweet note (vanilla?). not a great beer, but good. clean and crisp, enough flavor to fit the bill....not bad.","DESTRO","May 12, 2004"
3.75,-2.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I was actually surprised that this turned out to be a nicely flavored beer. In Germany, the kristallklar weizens are the ones generally served with a lemon nice. Trust me, you do not need lemon with this one. Another fine Hacker-Pschorr bier.","Beastdog75","Apr 27, 2004"

4.08,6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This weiss beer poured a clear, golden-amber color with creamy, slightly off-white foam that clung to the sides of the glass. The smell was wheat, floral hops, and bread. The taste was a very lightly sweet, biscuity malt with light floral hops with notes of grain and a delicate, toasted banana flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and medium-low carbonation feel. There was a nice, lingering aftertaste. This was a nice weiss and very drinkable. It had also held up remarkably beyond its "expiration" date.","UncleJimbo","Aug 02, 2003"
4.25,10.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Crystal clear light straw color. Streams of carbonation make their way to the surface quite rapidly. A long lasting small sized white head sits on top. The aroma is really big on the vanilla. Banana esters and clove are present to a smaller degree. The taste takes the cue from the aroma. But it's a little more balanced. Vanilla, banana and clove mingle together nicely in this hefe. And there's also a little bubblegum to accentuate. Overall, this is quite the tasty Kristal. Hacker-Pschorr usually does not disappoint.","Bighuge","Jun 22, 2003"
3.73,-3.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability/notes: A really solid wheat beer, and quite nice for a lazy summer afternoon.","Pegasus","May 07, 2003"
4.07,5.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours Golden and 99% clear. The head is white and fluffy like whipped egg whites that settles very slowly leaving faint hints of lace on the glass. The nose is really good and notably sweet and fruity malt. The hops are subtle and spicy. The taste is a sweet/dry that is tart and sweet and the same time. The Hops are mid level for bitterness and have a presence in the finish that starts with notes of a mid-level lemony/citrus taste. Overall this is an enjoyable beer.","AtrumAnimus","Apr 18, 2003"
2.86,-25.7,3,2,3,4,3,"While this is not a bad brew (the corny smell and the sweetness are what hurt this beer's rating), I won't be picking it up again. Especially not when there are so many great wheat beers out there.","Quaffer","Mar 18, 2003"
3.75,-2.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear golden color, and a bodacious, blooming, beautiful white head. Nose is redolent of vanilla, bananas, and a touch of citrus. Extraordinarily smooth and mild, so much that I doubted that I was downing an ale. Full of the flavor of a weizen, but lacking some of the texture.I normally like my weizens with the hefe, but you can't argue with a refreshing kristall such as this.","feloniousmonk","Mar 06, 2003"
3.18,-17.4,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear golden hue with a mountainous head that won't quit. Finally settles at about one finger leaving a thick lace. Sweet malty aroma with citrus and clove at the forefront. Smells clean and refreshing. Piney taste with a sweet bite. Fairly well carbonated with extremely small bubbles. Towards the middle the taste thins out to be pretty bland. Very weak finish. Started out strong, but left me very disappointed.","cretemixer","Jan 06, 2003"
3.87,0.5,3.5,4,4,3,4,"A beautiful opaque gold color as it sits in the glass, the head creamy in texture white in color, the size impressive with endless sheets of lace to blanket the glass. Nose has aromas of citrus, wheat, and dominated by the malt. Begins sweet, the top skimpy in feel, the finish is mildly carbonated, the hops pleasant and the aftertaste dry and lingering. Very refreshing, crisp and clean, a great beer for the end of the workday treat.","Gusler","Dec 02, 2002"
3.98,3.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Purchased a bottle without examining the expiration date - which is long since past, and there were black markings on underside of bottle cap. It's not primo fresh but it actually hasn't been ruined either, just muted a bit. Despite this wheat beer being filtered, it still has some heft to it. Dark golden, almost copper colored, fine head. A subdued brew, malts are present and wheat/yeast characteristics are noticeable but not overpowering. Will try to find a fresh bottle and re-review; I'm amazed that this old sample was drinkable let alone enjoyable.","Thrasher","May 22, 2002"
3.9,1.3,4,4,4,3,4,"Weisse Kristall is almost lager - like in clarity-- only a slight haze can be discerned.  The head is not as thick as that of a hefeweizen, probably due to the filtering of proteins conducive to head formation.  The expected German wheat yeast esters are there and are comprised of banana, clove and a bit of bubblegum notes. The mouthfeel is a tad thin as a result of the filtration, since residual proteins are quite important in mouthfeel.  Hop flavor is absent, but perceived hop bitterness seems above the norm for a Weizen, perhaps due to the lightening of body.  Musty notes and fruitiness from the yeast are present and akin to that of an unfiltered hefeweizen.  Finishes dry and estery.  Man-- what an odd beer.  Weisse Kristall is tasty, but I prefer my German weizens unadulterated.","marc77","Apr 17, 2002"
4.24,10.1,4,5,4,4,4,"A refreshing and lip smaking brew, one of my favourites.","Jason","Oct 24, 2001"
4.28,11.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Notes: An outstanding Kristall Weizen beer. Extremely flavourful and complex, while remaining refreshing and just an overall pleasure to drink.","BeerAdvocate","Oct 23, 2001"
