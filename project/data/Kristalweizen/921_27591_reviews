"O - This is a pretty tasty German brew. I had never had anything from Bischoff so I had to try it. I wasn't disappointed."
""
"My expectations where not met."
"I wasn't really sure if this was a Hefe or Kristall, but as it turns out, I bought this and the Hefe without even knowing it. Poured from a capped green bottle a vibrant golden color, with just a tinge of murk, and a decent sized white head. Smell is a bit strange in that it has a sort of husky grain/skunked character that reminds me of a macro lager like Heineken. It isn't exactly unappealing, in fact it gets better as it warms, but it really doesn't smell like any other example of this style I have encountered. Taste is lively with carbonation, with a sickly sweet taste accompanied by a mild skunked flavor. Traces of banana and wheat are there, but very much masked by the off flavors that are present. Body is an improvement, with a good dosage of carbonation, and a light refreshing crispness. I have to say that it was difficult to finish this bottle. I toyed with dumping it, but decided to let it unfold a bit more. It took on some of the characteristics that the Hefe did, but ended up falling short in comparison. A strange beer IMO, not completely a waste, but Im not gonna recommend it. Cheers"
"Drinkable...yes, but i don't know if it makes me want another. Something nice to try, but i love yeast and all the vitamins that come with it, so i would pass on this one again but am glad to have tried it."
"Drinkability: I will certainly be trying another one of these beers, very tasty and enjoyable."
"The brew tastes quite light: a little lemony and it has a bitter finish. There is not a whole lot of sustenance here, but is quite refreshing."
"This was my first taste of a Kristall Weizen, and it's possible that I just don't enjoy the style, however as a big fan of Hefe Weizen I will not accept this after trying only one example of the style."
"Quite drinkable and thirst quenching, though lacks the real punch of a true wheat beer."
"This beer pours a light copper color with a thin white head. Smells like a pilsner with a touch of wheat and some sour honey. Tastes like a crisp pilsner with a touch of smoky skunkiness. There is only a hint of wheat detected as well. Finishes dry. The mouth feel is light with a medium carbonation. Im not impressed. Tastes like a Deutsch attempt at an American macro lager, but the bottle says kristall weizen. I suppose every German beer cant be amazing."
