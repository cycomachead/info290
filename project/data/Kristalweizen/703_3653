Looks alright, however the aroma and flavour are a lacklustre blend of fruity yeast notes and subtle wheat. None of the bold fruitiness and spicy character that would be expected from a better weizen. Body is OK. Drinkable enough but equally forgettable.

Smell is of malt, wheat, sugar, and slight fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and slight fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and somewhat medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is pretty lacking in traditional weizen aromas and flavors, even for the style.","UCLABrewN84","May 25, 2013"

The taste is sweet but fairly clean. Seems to have a corn or adjuct type flavor and sweetness but none of the gross aftertaste. Any of the yeasty goodness has been filtered out of this brew, perhaps a very light banana creme pie flavor but that is it. The weizen has a light but not watery body, fizzy carbonation which leads to a crisp feel. Sweet overall but not cloying. This is quite a refreshing beer but it is boring. Definitely needs some more of the yeast flavors to come through.","Gmann","Oct 02, 2010"

Hints of bubble-gum, bananna , and clove dance in the background, but never gain prominence. Light hopping allows the grain / bread flavors to become dominant.

The flavor is very fruity, with bubblegum, bready malts, and some late grassy hops. It has a light, dry, not-quite-tingly body that leaves a short finish. Interesting - tastes decent but doesn't really remind me a whole lot of a kristall. As to the comparisons with the hefe, this one looks much better, but the other tastes more authentic.

The taste starts sweet and malty as expected, there is a very slight hint of the banana in the aroma, and it finishes with just the right amount of bitterness and a little toastiness. Although it is more subtle than you would expect from a hefe, this is more than made up for by the balance.
