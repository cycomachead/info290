I get some sweet wheat and general graininess, but not much else besides some light bananas and cloves. The banana and cloves express themselves more distinctly on the palate, which is sweet up front before leading to a very chalky finish with an unusual texture. This is an intriguing beer. One well worth investigating to see if one of its challenging corners is particularly appealing to you.","droomyster","Nov 02, 2011"

Nose is fruity and spicy, mild banana predominates w/ a hint of allspice or clove. The flavor here is a little watered down w/ a hint of tartness and alight banana cream flavor being just about all this has to off. Lack of off flavors and brisk enough carbonation keep it quaffable which is I guess pretty much what you want out of a kristall.","CuriousMonk","Jul 18, 2011"

The aroma was heavy with yeast, a mild herbal hop and a straw malt with a slight note of banana and clove. It tasted midly bitter yet very smooth at first and finished with a nice yeast flavor with just an ever so slight hint of banana that stayed with you only a short time.

Color is a 3 on the SRM beer color chart. Started hazy, but cleared in a few minutes. Such flavor in such a light colored beer. Smells like lots of malt, roasted wheat and oats and some hops. Taste is great, well balanced, flavors of malt, citrus, wheat, barley, corn, vanilla, and pepper. Lots of body in my mouth. Not easy on the wallet, but great for the price. Shell out the green for this one.","beerprovedwright","Dec 25, 2010"

It is a golden straw color with plenty of evervecent bubbles. Smells slightly of bananas and grain. Tastes like a sweet banana bread much like the natural weizen and of a fruity wheat mix. This beer is a little dryer than the natural. Mouthfeel is a little watery and bubbly. Drinkability is good but I prefer the natural weizen over this.

Smell is a classic malt liquor that is not weak, but not extreme either. Taste is a little watered down malt liquor. About the same after taste of a classic malt liquor and as drinkable as a classic malt liquor.

3.63,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"When I usually think of Kristall Weizens, I think of American Pale Wheat Ales, but better. As this beer opens, a good healthy dose of Pilsner malts, medium wheat aromas and flavors, and a mild hint of grain flavor. While the esters, phenolics, and overall strong yeast character is timid, the bready / malty notes shine. The beer isn't without all esters though; I get a nice lemon character, followed up by a peppery, bubble-gummy note that gives a lot of variety to the beer. The filtering does strip much viscocity from the beer, making it less creamy and full, but does make for a beer that is easier to drink without bloating. Finishes quite clean, but with a light grain / wheat blend and a lingering lemon flavor. Nice beer.","BEERchitect","May 29, 2008"

The taste was more pils than weizen, with a slight sharpness that reminded me of sterling hops. The mouthfeel was average, and the beer was very well carbonated.
