"Good sweet taste. Better than original."
""
"This is one of my favorite beers. Tastes great, not too sweet and with a good amount of malts. My favorite Leinie."
""
""
"Overall : a very mediocre beer. You can drink it but it's far from impressive in any way. I probably wouldn't have it again unless there were no better options. One of Leine's worst offerings."
""
""
""
""
"Better than an AAL. Cheers!"
""
"Delicous this beer is that is all"
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful looking, the taste does not match up to it. Fairly innocuous and not particularly memorable.. It is a passable beer. If you want to try all of the Leinie's there are better and worse than this one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad for Leinenkugel. This was one of my first beers and it's fun to go back to. I was surprised by the appearance and smell, but the taste did not quite deliver in my opinion. A good summer beer nonetheless."
"One of my summer favorites"

"I really started enjoying these after a few, but all and all, this is just a very decent, light bodied beer and not much more. It's not bad and it's not great, but it is very drinkable. It's better than a lot of mainstream beers for sure."

"Appearance was dark yellow with a thin head. The smell had the sweetness from the honey as well as a little bit of a bite from the hops. The taste was a little skunky but had a nice aftertaste and a good finish for the beer. The mouthfeel was light but refreshing. Overall an okay beer."

"O- filtering a Hefe seems to also filter out any flavor as well. This seems like it would be more fitting in a summer variety pack, it's easy to drink on a hot day but doesn't really fit in to a fall pack"
"So I've seen and heard about this beer quite often. I finally tried it and I really wanted to like it. However, this was just a deplorable attempt by Leinenkugal. The appearance is ok with not much of a head and no real lacing but the color may lead you to believe the are some layers of flavor in the glass. The scent is an overwhelming aroma of corn and every other type of cheap filler you can think. Call the smell rancid, skunky or just flat out cheap...it wasn't pleasant. The taste is so disappointing. I can't say it's too horrible as you can drink it...if your Nicholas Cage in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and need a ""fix"" but the corn and grassiness hits you right of the bat and you then quickly get some nasty honey flavor. In my opinion there is balance here and it's all bad! The mouth-feel reminds me of tap beer from rusty pipes in a dive bar. Avoid this one! It's too bad , some of Leinenkugal's stuff isn't bad, but they crashed and burned on this one."

"D - acceptable but not outstanding in anyway. Besr Served cold and when out of better beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well I got a case of this for free from a guy who works at MillerCoors, I'll probably give it away, too me this is like a Budweiser equivalent but I think this tastes a tad bit better but that doesn't say much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I quite enjoyed it, would suggest, good to just sit down and chill out with, not overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a complete wreck, but it's definitely nothing to write home about. If you're looking for something light for back to back drinking, there are plenty of others out there that offer more character and a more enjoyable experience. I couldn't in good faith recommend this to anyone."

"O- I'm disappointed in this beer....its not that it's a bad beer...it's easy enough to drink and perhaps with the recommendation of trying this with a lemon wedge, it would be quite refreshing. My biggest concern is that this looks, smells and tastes very similar to any other American macro brew out there....other than having a slightly sweeter aftertaste...leaves a lot to be desired....Meh...."
"Final Thoughts: Your basic macro lager but with that small town flair. Would I drink it again? Oddly enough, yes. But I never seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"This was actually a very good beer in my opinion. The aromas of honey when you open the bottle were very noticeable. The taste of this was also very good and will continue to drink this beer when I am able to do so. This is very popular in my area as well."
""
""
""
"I remember this as one of my very first beers many moons ago. Let's see how things go today: It pours a clear golden-straw topped by a finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly-buttered biscuit, light wheat, and the lightest kiss of dried honey (which, admittedly, might just be there due to advertising getting the better of me). The taste brings in more of the same, with less of a buttery quality and more of a sweet one. It helps, but it doesn't elevate matters too far. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, an okay beer at best, nothing close to special, but strangely drinkable enough..."

"O- Huge dissapointment. I expected something respectable. I know I have high standards but even an average beer drinker deserves better then this."

"Nothing spectacular about this one. Personally, I like the smooth, refreshingness of the honey wheat beer. So I have no problem putting these down. Would I buy a six pack for myself? Nah. It's kind of dull, but it seems like it would have mass appeal if it were more widely available."

"A mediocre wheat ale, and hardly a kristalweizen. The honey flavor is not entirely forgiving, but at least it gives it character. I'm not a Leinie's fan, but this one was a big disappointment. Regrettable last beer of the night."

"O: Too sweet to enjoy. Not a fan of the style."
""

"O: well it's not a bad beer, just not something to scream about. Weird, how I thought this was a better beer, maybe it tasted better when I lived in Michigan and I was closer to Wisconsin? Not sure."

""

"O: im not overly familiar with this style but i do find this example to be very bland and unfortunately reminiscent of adjunct lagers, honey was nice but not much else was worth mentioning"

"12oz bottle out of a summer sampler, pours golden with excellent clarity, bubbly white head with decent retention and leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas are muted but sweet with wheat and biscuit, but that's about it. Tastes are sweet honey, biscuity, nutty, wheaty, delicately hopped. Mouth-feel is thin-to-medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and finishes slightly dry. Overall, I think ""Kristalweizen"" isn't the proper style category for this one, as I would tend to think Kristalweizen = filtered German Hefeweizen, where this beer has no German influence at all. Kristal American Pale Wheat Ale? Whatever it may be, my values above represent it as an American wheat, and it's a decent beer if you want to think of it that way."
"Overall: Try it"
"Overall it's not that bad of a beer. Much better than Bud Light or a big mainstreem beer..but not far off from them. Give it a try."

"Honey Weiss poured a cloudy bright yellow color, with not much head. There really wasn't much of a smell, hints of honey were present but not much else. The taste had hints of lemon and honey, but had a grainy and unpleasant after taste. Light flavor, and not very enjoyable, overall stay away."

"Okay, easy to drink to the point of being flavorless. Better than bud/miller/coors, but still in that category."

"They call this a honey weiss, it's basically a deep pale golden hue with a bright white head that dies quickly to nothing but speckled lacing. Aroma is minimal very muted sharp wheat notes with little to no citrus or honey notes. Thin body easy to sip on but the wheat notes give it some actual nice breadiness, I don't get much in the way of honey on the palate, a bit of hash grainy character in the finish. A touch of fruit, maybe at this point I will call it citrus. Mouthfeel has heavy carbonation but a lighter body, adding to some unnatural effervescence. Overall, the beer is unlike any other beer, out there a wheat beer that is crystal clear and tastes clean like basically nothing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pass on this for sure. There aren't really any good flavors to it other then the astringent alcohol and lingering yeast. Honey sweetness does not come through. A poor showing"
""
"M: I gulped through this pretty quickly; it caught me off guard. Very refreshing and sweet; Leinie's has a way of sneaking up on you like that."
""
""
"poured out a light honey color. clear body with a thin white head that quickly fizzes out. has poor retention and lacing. smells like wheat and honey. tastes like watered down honey and wheat. has a thin watery mouthfeel with little carbonation and no hops presence what so ever. overall this is a poor example of what a kristalweizen can be."

"D: A light summer thirst solution. Not all that different from macro swill. Floral honey sweetness and lemon hops don’t really work well together, and – along with the appearance- contribute to a diluted, honey-sweetened shandy impression."

"Overall: This beer is a lovely summertime brew. I prefer this over Summer Shandy, Leinenkugel's ""summertime"" beer because this contains far less fruit and is not sweetened nearly as much. If the price is right and the weather is warm, try a few of these."
"Overall - would not buy again."

"Pours a clean pale yellow, with a white head. In the aroma, wheaty and sweet to dry honey. In the taste, lemon citrus, a wheat like bite, and rounded out with honey flavors of clove. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry wheat and clove like aftertaste. Looks more like a pils, kind of thin and domestic like."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad beer. It could be refreshing on a hot day, better than something really heavy like a hefeweizen for a day like that. You an certainly tell its filtered, because it comes out like a lager in appearance and finish. I wouldn't recommend it, but wouldn't turn one down given the right situation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Looks to me like a lite lager in appearance. The flavors in the taste could be nice, but are thin and watery, and are quickly scrubbed from the palate with higher crisp carb. I picked up some of the alcohol in this session and was left a bit head-achy. This might taste pretty refreshing after mowing the lawn on a warm summer day. Seems to miss the style a bit for me, can't recommend this one."

"Overall it's a lawnmower beer. Best straight from the bottle when you just want a no think beer. The flavor profile is so mild in nature it feels as though you're drinking a perrier at times."
"O: Easy to drink, clean finish, one of the more fuller-bodied Kristalweizen's but was still a little too watery. Overall a good beer with common flaws, so compared to others, one of the better ones."

"This beer is not okay with me. I like a sweet beer, but this is over the top sweet for me. I really felt like i was drinking a bud lager with a couple of tablespoons of honey stirred in. I have to place the beer on the low. I hope to try a better beer from old Jacob soon. So stayed tune."

"The guys on my hockey team really like the Leinenkugels beers. So they recently brought the Honey Weiss to our recent game. The Leinie's Honey Weiss was very thin, weak aroma, flavor and mouthfeel. There is honey present and also a toasted wheat flavor. But you're really straining to get either - comes out mostly in the aftertaste. This beer's just about as thin as any light lager - has a bit of a bitter, corny taste to it as well. It's okay drinking on a hot day, I'm sure, but don't look for much dazzlement on your tongue."
"O: The beer is easy to drink and has more flavors compared to other kristalweizens."
"kind of looks and feels like a Budweiser defiantly has a little more flavor and the honey after taste is a pleasant surprise , there is nothing special as far as appearance really looks like a miller lite or bud , has a decent head but dissipates quickly leaving no lacing If this beer was a little cheaper I wouldn't mind throwing these down to get a good buzz on or maybe grab 9 for a game of golf but besides that these aren't as crafty as they may appear"
"Tastes like it smells, faint weak wheat with a whisper of barely-there honey. It also has a watery thin body, which is refreshing as a summer thirst quencher, and the carbonation is quite appropriate...crisp and clean finish...I just wish there was more flavor in it. I believe that it is a good lawnmower beer, at least it is better than a BMC, but really mostly only by the virtue of not having any strange off-flavors."
"Pretty average overall. Actually, just below it. I did have another one later in the week and it tasted a bit better, but I think my ratings will stick."
"Overall: A very light but fairly tasty brew best had in the summer."
"Pours a crystal clear pale golden color with a big thick head which stays around. The aroma is of grains and sweet malt, there is not a lot going. The aroma is faint and hard to get. The taste is much the same grainy with a hint of sweet malt and a touch of honey. The taste seems closer to an adjunct than a kristal. The taste is muted and hard to identify. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and crisp. Overall it is okay I probably wouldn't have this one again. The taste and aroma just weren't there."
"O- It's a decent intro beer, but it's not one that I regularly pursue. The honey flavor is kinda nice but it doesn't go anywhere. A beer stuck in first gear I would say."
"This beer is not really a good beer. The only thing I would recommend this beer for is possibly a transition beer. People just getting off mass market beers may be interested in this. I would not recommend it to anyone else and I won't be drinking this beer again."
"O: One and done. Stop those ads making this sound like a good beer."
"This beer pours a clear yellow with half-inch head and lasting lace. The aroma is of citrus, honey, and flowers. It's flavor has lemon, vanilla, and honey notes. Well balanced. The mouthfeel is light and smooth. Leinenkugels Honey Wheat is a good beer, very dry, crisp, and refreshing. Recommended."
"The beer pours a very pale golden color--almost anemically so--but had a nice cap of foam. The aroma is an admixture of lightly toasted malt and honey. The flavor profile is similar to the nose. The beer goes down easy, but the sweetness from the honey becomes a bit much more my tastes. The beer is a little light through the center and finishes with not more than a whimper."
"O) This is okay. If you're at a summer get together, and this one is on the top layer of ice in the cooler... Well, I say dig to the bottom and hope for the best."
"A big shout out to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of wheat and grains, a touch of honey. Taste is also big on the wheat, some honey is present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent brew."
"Not a good beer at all in my opinion. Pass."
"O: Nothing out of this world, but very solid. What it lacks in complexity it more than makes up in being a straightforward easy to drink beer, which sometimes is all you ned."
"All in all, I don't think I will buy this beer again, it just doesn't have much going for it other than you could drink a lot of this in one sitting."
"Overall: This beer doesn't promise much, but it overdelivers. Not an everyday thing, I don't think, but certainly one of the better options out of the Leinie's variety pack."
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it has a very small white fizzy head on it. The body is a nice golden color body. The smell is sweet of honey and some wheat. I don't taste any wheat, but i get a sweet start and a little hop finish to it, very crisp though. The mouth feel is nice and crisp on the tongue. Overall i think this is a good summer time beer."
"This stuff is alright. Less sweet than expected which is good. It is light and refreshing but lacks in complexity."
"Overall, it's easy to drink and pairs well with most foods. On the other hand, it's a bit boring and uninspiring."
"Notes: This light-bodied beer is another example of a product that is meant to be craft, but geared towards the mainstream crowd. Drinkable, and not horrible, but not a beer for my liking."
"I cringe to see this grouped in with the Weihenstephaner Kristallweizen - that's a great beer, this ain't. Honey Weiss doesn't recall the style much - very thin, weak aroma, flavor and mouthfeel. Yeah, there's honey. Yeah, there's kind of a cereal, toasted wheat flavor. But you're really straining to get either - comes out mostly (but only minimally) in the aftertaste. This beer's just about as thin as any light lager - has a bit of a bitter, corny taste to it as well. It's okay drinking on a hot day, I'm sure, but don't look for much dazzlement on your tongue."
"The Honey Weiss pours out at a crystal clear yellow color with a fizzy white head that leaves a little lacing in the beginning but trails off by mid glass. The smell is slightly sweet with a mix of grains and malts. The flavor of the beer doesn't scream honey like I would have liked it too. The taste is clean and fairly refreshing on a hot day though. The body of this brew is light and easy to drink. Overall I'm not the biggest fan of this brew but I wouldn't turn this beer away if it were offered to me."
"Drinkability- this beers not hard to drink as it is so light but its just lacking enough enjoyability for it to be a good go to choice, flavor profile is just to thin and simplistic, just not enough going on here and I think probably the weakest of there line in my opinion, its not the worst beer in the world but certainly nothing special"
"Just cracked one of these on a great spring day...can't get much better for the bargain. Sure there's better beers but this one hits great price point and is a quality brew. Great notes of Honey...go figure. Just enough sweetness in it to get you through a warm spring/summer day. I'd take this over the Shandy any day....the shandy is too sweet and fills you up so fast. This is a great session beer."
"I do not give a Schlitz for Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss."
"Overall Drinkability - Seriously not impressed by this beer. Not one of Leinenkugels best. I definitely do not recommend this beer. I can see some redeeming qualities for BMC fans, but not for anyone with any palate development whatsoever."
"O - Pales in comparison to the Sunset Wheat. If I wasn't a cheap ass in need of a buzz I would've probably set it aside."
"I've drank a lot of this one in my day. My favorite from Leines. They seem to have become more interested in making a buck vs. complex beers with a lot of their recent offerings. Honey weiss is one they have had in their rotation for many years so making it efficiently was probably less of a concern before being bought by Miller. Perhaps this is why this beer has more complexity, albeit not much, vs. their new offerings."
"Nothing special nor offensive. I doubt many BA's will seek this out. It's better than having macros, so if you're at a bar in the upper midwest and this is available, I'd say to go for it."
"Pours a very pale yellow color with quickly diminishing head. Has a decent scent of wheat to it. Taste it rather simple as it is basically a lighter flavored wheat beer. I'm really searching for the honey taste in it and can not find it. Definetly a summer beer, but essentially is just a glorified Miller Lite taste wise. Certainly not unique by any means."
"Overall its very drinkable but would have liked to had a stronger honey flavor. I would drink it again but only in a variety pack, I wouldn't buy a pack of just this beer."
"Overall, not terrible, but not good either."
"Grab the fishing pole and a cooler of these and you will have a great day. I do not know what it is but I always relate a Leinies to an outdoor activity. What's wrong with that? I guess it is not too bad. Honey and beer go together like PB & J. A great combination. This beer is a clean crisp and refreshing wheat beer. Not to exciting to look at or smell but it taste pretty damn good. Great session beer. My best friend from Minnesota likes to put a lemon with it."
"Ending notes: Overall, not too impressive. I didn't hate it, but I won't be getting this one again anytime soon. Average summer beer at best."
"If you've never had Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss, it's definately worth a try. I recommend Leinenkugel's Spring Variety Pack, which includes Honey Weiss."
"The CPJ"
"Not something I'd search out. Leinenkugel needs to cut the lemon flavor and add some more malt. The ""crispness"" of the beer does not seem to come from the wheat so much, I think lemon juice was added to give it the crisp zing; a really bad call, as it throws off the flavor. Worst weizen I've ever had."
"Now here's a brew that makes me drool a little and say mmm. . .beer. There is nothing special at all about this beer. In fact the honey taste is either hidden very well or non-exsistant. This isn't a bad thing but makes this beer rather boring. This one is best enjoyed as a 12 pack. Honey Weiss goes down smooth and tastes pretty good."
"From notes on tap: Pours golden with minimal head which quickly diminishes. Initially smells like burning plastic but warms up to a slightly sweeter aroma with floral overtones. Easy to drink, no flavor to speak of other than a slightly sour finish and a fake sweetener-like aftertaste. Not remarkable, not out of the ordinary and not something I'd go out of my way to drink again."
"It isn't a bad beer but not one I'd go after specifically."
"I'll not be having another!"
"Overall, nothing outstanding. But on a hot summer day of mowing grass, it'd be great. Was expecting a little more honey taste, not sure how that would affect the beer overall, but an interesting thought. In the end, I would recommend this brew, for someone looking for an easy to drink weizen."
"Golden straw color beer that isn't quite as pale as most American lagers; It has a bit more of a golden hue to it. This beer keeps its carbonation launching and will keep decent head retention if left alone. I smell herbal notes and honey with just some malt. This beer tastes of the herbal honey notes along with very little hop bitterness and a sweet malt backbone. This is a bit lighter than the beers I've been drinking lately so it's a very nice thirst quencher and drinks very easily. This is the first and only kellerweis I have tried but it is a pleasant one. The wheat is also a noticeable difference from the barley"
"Can't believe this stuff is going for $7+ a 6er now, not worth it at even half that price."
"Drinkability - drinkable brew, but not complex at all in the taste. Still not bad-tasting either. Had one yesterday in the bottle and tasted completely different."
"Pretty good beer. Admittedly my tastes are a bit on the week side but I really like this beer."
"D - Kind of boring, one dimensional and body was way to light for me to consider a second purchase. Still it was cool to try and overall a tasty beverage."
"D: While it is nothing special as far as taste I could go through a six pack easily. It would be a remarkable hot weather beer. On a cold night though it leaves something to be desired."
"D - Drinkable is one positive attribute of this beer. It would be good on a hot summer day where refreshment is as important as taste."
"Taste: Really pleasant taste. It has a little bit of a bread like taste mixed with a little bit of sweetness. There is very little bitterness to balance the sweetness but the sweet flavor is not overpowering."
"D: Excellent drinkability. A good middle ground for those of us who like good flavors and those who drink the ""big 3"". I can't say I order or buy this one a lot but I always enjoy it when I do have one."
"Verdict: Looks very good, tastes above average. There isn't much to distinguish this beer above the crowd of honey and wheat brews. You shouldn't be disappointed, but then again you shouldn't be astounded either. Not a bad Leinenkugel brew. I wouldn't mind running into this one again. B (3.65)"
"D - This is one of my favorite Leinie's; good summer beer and many non-beer lovers may enjoy it. Very sessionable. Great post grass-cutting beer."
"Not very drinkable, but would do in a pinch."
"D - As far as drinkability, this is a quaffing beer when you're looking to hydrate while mowing the lawn on a hot Summer day. It's too rough to even be served in good glassware, this is one you drink straight from the bottle. There are much better beers out there...go for those beers before you pick this one up."
"very crisp and fresh with a lightness and drinkability. great beer on a hot day, maybe after some yard work. very smooth with a slight mild honey comb finish. i find this beer dangerous cause i feel like i could drink quite a few in one sitting with ease."
"drinkability good. i could have a few of these. not that i would choose to, or want to."
"This beer pours into a nice golden yellow beer with a small white head that has excellent lacing, retention and carbonation. I can smell a little wheat in this beer, but not much else and when tasting this beer with a nice creamy feel that clings to your tongue and cheeks all I can say is that I do taste some wheat followed by a malty taste with a little bit of honey in the aftertaste. This is a good beer for someone that wants an easy drinking beer that has a very good mouth feel that isn't too strong on the taste buds. To me this is another Leinie that is fine in a variety pack, but just like Creamy Dark I would not get it in a six pack."
"Overall: This is an alright beer, but spend a few $ more and you can drink the real thing imported from Germany, and the difference is readily apparent. If you simply want a clear yellow easy to drink beer with the usual lager flavors, pick up some Miller High Life for much less, and you won't notice much difference."
"Poured into a pint glass. The color is a moderate golden with a thin white head and no real lacing. The nose is some fairly-strong honey sweetness and a bit of grain. The taste is sugar, honey, and light grassy grain. Pretty cloying body that makes it seem a lot heavier than it really is. Not terrible, but not something I want much of."
"Final Notes: This beer was all-around bad. I did not like it at all. Yet another letdown by Leinenkugel's Brewery. Sad day."
"Not a favorite of mine, bought it in a winter variety 12 pack."
"Following the Crack & Glug, I was going for maximum head, so I utilized my soon-to-be-famous inverted pour, resulting in a finger-and-a-half of fluffy, bone-white head with great retention. Color was like liquid sunshine in a glass. Beautiful! Deep golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. King Midas would have been envious of the gold. Nose was very malty sweet. As a previous reviewer put it very succinctly - it smelled like being on a tour of the brewery! Dig that! I like brewery tours, BTW. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a wheat beer taste initially, followed by a lingering honey taste on the finish. Man, this was very tasty and a definite CANdidate for the imaginary cooler that I am continually filling for a beach outing. MUCH better than their Summer Shandy, which just begs to be blended with Furthermore's Knot Stock to become a Lemon Pepper Beer. Suddenly, I want to try the Berry Weiss that much more."
"Overall, I'm not impressed with this beer. While mildly drinkable in that it's not harsh to drink, it's not as pleasant to drink as better beer. Try something else, even something else from Leinenkugel's... they have better stuff from that brewery."
"D- I always rate the drinkability high for beers with low alcohol and light flavor."
"O: Solid summer beer, and good stepping stone to more flavorful selections."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into my Coors Banquet tasting glass. Some foamy white head that popped up and went down quickly. A clear golden colour. Not the Weisse cloud that I am accustomed to. Smells yeast and malts with some fruit overtones-noticed the honey faintly near the end. Tastes as expected; light honey, light fruits, and malts. Mouth feel is light bodied and refreshing. Drinkability is fine, I got three in the box so I guess I'll drink three. I like this better than some of the other varieties in the Leiney sampler."
"D: A decent summer beer if there is nothing else to be found. Not bad, but not my thing. Boring."
"Overall- this beer is as bland as bud. i've said it before and i'll say it whatever amount of times that the only thing good coming out of leinenkugel is the sunset wheat."
"Drinkability: Fairly mild taste with a light body makes this easy to drink in the summer heat, but I wont be craving it anytime soon."
"Maybe I'm just spoiled."
"Drinkability: A simple and easy-to-drink wheat beer. Not a lot going on in the flavor department but still refreshing and pleasant to have on a hot day."
"D: great lawnmower beer, and goes well with the polish sausage and grilled onions at the Cell."
"overall not bad at all, really quite nicely done and something i would have no issue with again, though i doubt i would pay for it."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with above average carbonation. This is fairly drinkable, goes down pretty easy, but the taste isn't really something that makes you want to go back for more."
"The feel of this beer was pretty light and felt like there wasn't a lot there. It did go down real easy and was pretty drinkable so in the end it was a good summer beer but one that I will not have too often."
"Very good looking amber beer Slight head to it very low carbonation The smell of it was very malty The taste of the beer was very bitter which is why I didn't really care for it to me it wasn't very drinkable I probably won't have it again any time soon"
"Pretty good for this style of beer. The flavors are there but light and watered down. It's that weird lemon/honey cut with a light beer. The aftertaste is an imitation lemony flavor."
"D: For the style this is not bad at all. There is actually some nuance in the flavour, a slight hint of honey. But don't expect anything more than that. I could drink a few of these on a hot AZ day and not be upset. It is a drinkable beer, which is a lot better than many macros."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but I expected more of a honey profile in the beer. There's a bit of honey in the nose but It's barely perceptible in the beer itself. Overall the beer is good, but the wife and I just didn't pick up much of it's namesake in the profile. It's very drinkable, but I'd rather have a sunset wheat if I had a choice."
"MD- On the thin side, and very easy drinking a good summer beer."
"D- For what it is, it is an extremely drinkable beer, nice on a hot summer day."
"Overall: Underutilized and underappreciated."
"This beer reminds me of Summer in Wisconsin. Not great, owned by Miller, but good enough. Had it most recently on tap at the La Crosse Loggers game Sunday. Not much head to speak of, retention was pretty weak. golden in color, translucent. Smell of honey, would have been better with a lemon in at as it's sometimes served. taste of honey and light citrus. solid lawnmower beer, but it's not going to change any lives. Interested to try it half and half with the berry weis; I've heard it's better than either alone."
"Overall, might be better if served very cold on a hot day in a frosted beer mug, which is about the only way I can ""enjoy"" an American Adjunct Lager."
"D: There is not enough flavor in this beer an will quickly become a session beer in the hot sun in my book."
"Drinkability: ugh. I wouldn't have another."
"D-could definitely drink a few of these if I was in the mood, but not a great beer"
"D: Pretty good, again. There is a certain fullness to this beer, but it isn't heavy by any means. I think it is just the carbonation. It is definitely a refreshing beer, and one of the better beers in this aspect, in my opinion."
"Not a great beer, but might be worth a shot if you see it."
"d-lighter body and good flavor combination that are not to overpowering make this beer good to drink on thous warm spring/summer days"
"Drinkability: As a pale wheat ale, this actually is not all that bad a beer. It tastes like a pale wheat with honey--not overly fruited. A different take on the style, that I could session."
"D- Easy to drink maybe on a hot day. Overall, I thought it was kind of boring."
"The Honey Weiss is of course a honey wheat beer, it's got a little bit more of a bitter flavor than can compare to Michelob's Honey Lager - but of course we're talking ales vs. lagers here. It's a good flavor, and readily available around where I live."
"Generally not a huge fan of this category, but Leinie's strikes a good note with this one -- at least in my book."
"Notes: They should call this beer Lemon Weiss instead of Honey Weiss, because that is the dominant characteristic I taste in this beer. In fact, this beer is so lemony, that it encroaches on Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy territory. If this WAS the Summer Shandy, I'd be understanding of the lemon taste, but since it's not, it comes off as a rather generic pale wheat beer with too much lemon."
"Honey Weiss is a fairly average beer. It smells sweet. I almost thought it taste a bit lemony. Other than that, there wasn't a great deal of flavor. It didn't have an overly appealing look, just a light yellow color with little to no head. It wasn't necessarily a bad beer, but there wasn't much that set it apart from others."
"Taste is lightly sweet and wheaty. Very clear for a wheat beer but it's really quite easy to drink and really light. It's got a bit of that BMC twang but better than most macro lagers."
"This one pours to a golden color, with a small head that fades away rather moderately fast. It has a slight sweet aroma, honey is definitely there. Palette is slightly sweet with a bit of a bitter character. It has a smooth finish, and no harsh aftertaste. It is decent, but not a regular."
"(Bottle into pint glass) Poured a nice golden color with a moderate frothy head. Aroma contained notes of citrus and malt, with a very slight hint of honey. Drink was very crisp, but the honey sweetness was not present as advertised. I think this may have looked at honey once, but that was about it. That aside, it was a very refreshing drink with a slight bite at the end. Not recommended for those looking for the sweetness honey implied, but a very good summer standby."
"D-I could probably do two of these of an extremely warm summer's day, but other than that I wouldn't waste my money."
"Cheers!"
"Can recommend this for the most part, enjoyed it a little more than the Classic Amber Leinenkugel."
"Bottle: Poured a clean golden color ale with a large bubbly white head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of honey and light wheat malt is mostly bland. Taste is dominated by light sweet honey malt with not much wheat being noticeable. Body is kind of light with good carbonation. Very bland and ordinary and almost taste like a macro."
"Final thoughts: Decent summer beer that would quench your thirst very well and has good drinkability. Some light honey and sweetness that finishes dry and crisp, its very much like a mead crossed with very light wheat beer crossed with sauvignon blanc. I wouldn't recommend it for people that have taste buds and know what beer actually tastes like, but in a choice between this and water to rehydrate on a hot summer day, I would go with this."
"this beer pours a clear golden color with a tall white head that recedes to a film of lace. the aroma is malty and a bit on the lagerish side, I'm not sure if it's the honey that's responsible. the taste is sweet with quite a bit of malt. the crisp mouthfeel seems right for an american wheat. not a terrible drink, but not one that I'll look for."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down easily and not too filling since it's on the lighter side, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are a lot of other wheat beers or lighter beers that I would choose before this one."
"Drinkability: Nothing special, but not bad, and it certainly is refreshing."
"it has no distint aroma or taste for that matter. Its light summer beer, a total sessional that I enjoyed more than I would a Miller lite. Over nothing special, but it is what it is."
"drinkable? not in my mind. the flavor is pungently underwhelming, and sour to boot. combine to that the lack of decent other qualities, and this becomes one wasteful soul short of a drain pour."
"Dr. It will be a struggle, but I'll finish it."
"Golden color with a foamy head and mild presence of prickle. Served with a wedge of lemon, which I assume to be customary though I don't care for it. I have had it in the Metrodome without the lemon, but I wasn't reviewing then. The nose is refreshing and light, almost cool with a definite floral presence about it. The attack is fresh and cool on a warm afternoon. The flavor is pretty smooth and reasonably pleasant, but not to die for. It is somewhat undescript in both a good way and a bad way. Its a ""light"" beer in the sense that I would say it has broad appeal. There are hints of honey and lemon in the flavor. The finish resonates with characteristics that I would associate with a macrobrew. I can't complain about it, it was available at Applebee's."
"D: This is a pretty drinkable beer, but it is just too light in flavor for my taste.."
"Poured a piss yellow with very little head and no lacing. Smelled of artificial honey, rice, corn, steamed veggies. Taste of lemon and grainy. Thin body. This was my first drain pour. I thought it would be a good beer on a hot day but after drinking the quality of beers that I have been drinking there was no way I was going to was my taste buds on this crap."
"Pours a golden yellow color. The head has poor retention. Smell is of wheat and some sweetness, can't say the sweetness is from honey though. The taste is the same, but I don't taste honey. Kind of a bland beer overall. Clean mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Light bodied. Not offensive, also not special. Decent drinkability. Nothing special. Kind of eh."
"Nikki"
"mouthfeel is clean and crisp. it's drinkable."
"D - As one of their flagship beers, it's a solid brew for a lighter beer. Decent flavor and aroma coupled with a fantastic drinkability lends this beer well to the session brew category."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of white head. Faint citrus smells. I have to really stretch to get the honey. I was very disappointed in the taste. Not much going on here, very watery. I guess you could sit and drink this all day because there is no offensive taste, really no taste at all for that matter. I'll stick with the shandy."
"It is def. a easy to drink beer that is a good change of pace from your typical american beer and when you need a break from the great german variety that I get to enjoy, however, I enjoy some of the other leinenkugel"
"Altogether this is an enjoyable beer that offers not too many complexities to ponder. It's a good trade over from the BMC scene."
"D- Easy to drink because of how light it is. Not horrible, but not that good either."
"D: Very easy drinker. Really, there's just not that much going on with this beer. It's weak, very simple and non-offensive. Only slightly better than the typical American adjunct lager."
"This beer poured thin, with pretty much no head. The color is a pale yellow and the beer seemed very carbonated with tons of bubbles sticking to the glass. The first smell was some what disturbing. Smelled of rotten wheat. The taste was similar to a cheap light beer. There was a little bit of hoppiness in as it hit the tongue which was the highlight but other than that very light and watery. Easy to drink, but not very enjoyable."
"A good wheat beer. No bitterness makes it easy to throw back a few."
"D- Easy going beer without alot of overpowering taste. Nothing wow about it, but nothing particularly bad. Average all around."
"D) A decent wheat beer, but no unique characteristics to make it a stand out."
"pretty uninteresting beer. easy to drink and probably refreshing if it were warmer out. however better for getting hammered than savoring"
"Leinenkugel's also has a wide variety of other beers in their lineup, and most of them are good as well. In my opinion, Leinenkugel's has the best batch of variety beers (Sam Adams being a close second). To the people in Leinie country, I say thank you, and keep on brewing. To the people who have never tried a Leinie's, I say what are you waiting for? Drink up!"
"I am somewhat unfamiliar with its supposed style and not a genuine fan of the wheat beers, but none the less I have had some. This beer was very very pale, with an almost macro taste. I did pick up on faint scents and tastes of honey but not nearly at the levels that one would anticipate. Appearance scores this beer a few points simply because the head retention is good...but that's it. The worst Leinenkugel I have had yet...worst part is I cant use the bottles for homebrew because they are twists ERRGH!"
"The honey wheat taste definitely comes through. But the big drawback for me was that it left a pasty aftertaste. Worth a shot, but not a big fan."
"Decent atmosphere. A nice distinctive nose. Flavor is decent, but the honey (as the name suggests) doesn't really come out in the flavor. Feel is okay. When it's all said and done, a solid quaff."
" The 4.90% ABV can hardly be felt here and this has ""session beer"" written all over it. Sure, I like my beers complex, but once in a while, it's good to veg out and have something without thinking about it. Now where did summer go?!?!??"
"Like many of Leinenkugel's flavors, this is a great stepping stone brew. From here, I am excited to try some of the Mead beers that are out there."
"Aroma was very faint. There wasn't much honey. It was much drier than I expected. Not much body either. Carbonation isn't as rough as some macros, so i guess that's a plus. So if you like the high attenuated dry macro type, This is an easy drinker. I just hoped for more flavor and body."
"A little fizzy, but not a bad light refreshing beer."
"Not too far from expectation, but not exactly on target either. The honey is there but more difficult to detect than I would have liked. Light flavors of wheat and a little sweetness. Very light head of foam that dissipates quickly with minimal lacing. It's a little more watery than I would have liked, but otherwise okay."
"I know there's a difference between pale ale and India Pale Ale, but for regular pale ale I'd rather have a Sierra Nevada, also I couldn't detect the honey, should I have another? It was worth a try, but I was a bit disappointed. Good thing I got a deal on the stuff .."
"This beer poured an orangish yellow with a two-finger head. The smell is faint but sweet, with a little honey and grain. The taste starts off with some corn-tasting sweetness that gives way to honey, reminds me of a standard American lager with some honey in the bottle. The mouthfeel is watery with some fine carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable beer, but really not what I expected from the label."
"D: This beer is simple and a bit of a let down. If that is your thing, this the beer for you. Personally, if I want a macro, I'll buy a 12 pack of High Life for the price of this six pack. Flavors, look and smells are all basic and kind of crappy. This doesn't stand up the the style at all IMO. Not a fan, but hey, at least it doesn't have the crazy fruity pebbles flavor the Berry Weiss and Sunset Wheat had."
"Pours a pale yellow slight hazy and no head, someone had thrown a piece of lemon in it. I cannot get my head around why, I tried to pull it out straight away but the beer tasted of lemon afterwards anyway. No real aroma, slight sweet and corn. Honey? Not in my flavour, almost no flavour but the lemon and a bit of wheat notes, rather watery."
"Drinkability: Taste is fairly unoffensive, and the mouthfeel is average, so this is good for this. I wouldn't have a huge problem with a couple of these, its just that I can get much better beers of the same style. Nothing special"
"Pours a nice straw color with a bit of head, although no lacing and no floaties. Taste and aroma were like lemon dusting spray. Couldn't finish it, but had to pour it out. It was pretty horrible. I went down fine, but that's second to the taste. I couldn't even get the honey flavor from it."
"Overall I would only recommend this because it has decent flavor and feels like you could drink an endless amount. I know Leines makes some decent brews but I wasn't a huge fan."
"D- certainly not one of my favorites, but something i could see myself drinking several of while camping or in an other situation where im ""roughing it."" easy to drink and reminds me of summer."
"D-This would be an OK session beer, but it's not a spectacular brew. The flavor is rather plain, the characteristics are unremarkable. Regardless of this, I'll likely continue to drink it, as Leine's Honey Weiss is a staple throughout Minnesota and the Midwest. Not bad, but not good."
"On-tap at the Vikes games for the same price (seven bucks) as lesser macro options. I mean, as macros and adjucncts go, this beer is pretty decent, but as an American wheat, it kind of sucks. The aroma has typical DMS/cooked corn like other Leinenkugel brews. The flavor does start out with a mix of Triscut-wheat taste and a drop of honey flavoring, but it's followed by adjunct off-flavors. To reiterate, for cheap beer, its not bad, for craft beer, it sucks."
"Don't drink and review."
"Carbonation affects the mouthfeel as always, and the drinkability is hampered. Not a good track record for Leinenkugel's thus far from me, after this winter pack I'll probably never try another brew from them."
"Sort of a deep straw color,with a faint yeast aroma,maby straw. A light crisp flavor but lacking in any thing that really stands out,very little in the way of hops or malt in the aroma or flavor,and where is the Honey promised on the label,very average,drinkable but very average."
"D - Decently drinkable. Best consumed ice cold and on a hot summer day."
"On a sidenote I should mention that a guide during my tour of the Leinie's brewery said there are only two drops of honey in each bottle - I can tell. Good to drink every now and then but not something I would do constantly."
"Poured into a snow white head that disappated very fast. Very light yellow in color and brew was very clear. I dont know if Ive seen a more clearer beer or not. Virtually no lacing to speak of. Just a couple of white blothes here and there. Very light smelling. Maybe a little sweet honey. Tasted very light also. Had a little taste of honey and maybe a hint of lemon. but not much. Had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Felt ok in the mouth. It was almost like it had little or no carbonation. Very thin and watery. I dont think Ill buy these again. Really had no flavor to speak of. There was nothing to draw you back to the beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. Crystal clear, pale yellow. Weak little white head that fizzes away to nothingness. No lacing. Grainy faint aroma with a touch of tartness. Pretty weak, no real detectable wheat influence. Flavor is sort of like a really wimpy berliner weisse, a little tart and a little sweet and grainy. Quite watery, thin body. Borefest."
"Taste: Tastes like a macro with some honey. Overall this is a very disappointing beer."
"D - Easy to drink for beginners ;-) my girlfriend enjoyed this one. Not as high on my scale, but a good wheat."
"Out of bottle this beer was a perfectly clear golden color with a little visible carbonation. The head retained itself well and left decent lacing. The aroma was odd, slightly spicy and slightly weizen-like but it was notably soft. The flavors were washed out too and slightly skunky, some fruity malt and generic grains trying to cover the unpleasantness up. A very weird effort. The honey never came through. The body was light and the carbonation ok, but I would not buy another."
"D: While a poor example of what a ""honey weiss"" should taste like, this is quite drinkable. I could probably drink a few of these at a party or something instead of a whatever light."
"D= High, a good session beer that you can drink a lot of."
"Definatly drinkable, but would go out of my way for it."
"Boring beer. Couldn't find anything totally offensive about it, but I would never return to it. Even if pressed I'd probably opt for a water or soda, and that is absolutely not snobbery. It's just a matter of only wanting the best beer possible, whenever possible, and not supporting a below-average product. Leinenkugel's will never be mistaken for Bell's or Stone, but they've surely done better than this."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"D: Definitely drinkable. Unlike some, the mild sweetness would make me tire of the taste (that said, I still think it could be a little sweeter)."
"Mouthfeel is like watered-down tea. Little taste, and nothing in the finish."
"At 4.9% ABV, this beer is drinkable, but the question would be, ""WHY?"" I'm unimpressed."
"I drink this stuff if it is the right price, but it would not be my first pick in Honey Wheat beer. It does have less overwhelming honey notes, which I do like that part. It is highly drinkable when it's on sale fro $4 a sixer in the fall. It is a solid session beer for the right price."
"This was much better than the Berry Weiss, the honey flavor is a bit subdued and makes for an overall better beer. Still feels a bit lackluster but not too bad for a honey flavored beer. Drinkability is high as it's so light but taste wise and body wise it can improve immensely."
"If it was hot as balls out I would really enjoy something light like this, but I won't chase one down. A quencher."
"Pours from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass. Pale straw yellow color with very little white head that's gone in a flash. Almost no aroma to speak of. Taste is that of a mild, sweet, wheat beer. The honey flavor is there but it's all very muted. I keep taking sips to see if there is anything else but that's about it. Mouthfeel is fine and drinkability is ok. It's really just an average summer lawnmower beer."
"If I were served this beer in a blind taste I might not be quite as harsh, but for a beer that is marketed as a premium ""craft"" beer, this is a shameful product, really average beer at the price of good six pack. The flavor is muted, the mouthfeel flat, and aroma and aftertaste are pretty much MIA. I've had their northwoods lager and other phonies and would pretty much say the same thing: these beers are macro quality masquerading as micros."
"Poured at the the former Thunderbird now Ramada Mall Hotel in Minneapolis this one shows a clear gold with nominal bubblage, a modest white uneven cover and a reasonable bit of lacing. It has a simple cereal wheat aroma with a touch of citrus. The taste is a fairly healthy grainy grass and a hint of malt. Modest carbonation and plenty drinkable."
"I poured this one after a tiring day of work followed by lawn-mowing, edge-trimming, 100-degree sweaty, dirty Georgia goodness. It's quite refreshing, but seriously lacking in flavor. I almost think an A-B Budweiser has more character."
" A drinkable beer. It would be a fine beer to have a few of on a summer day sitting with your friends. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, but I wouldn't avoid it either."
"Drinkability- Not so good, if not for its cheapness Id never buy this."
"Pours an almost crystal clear pale straw color and is topped by one and a half finger white head which fades quickly leaving a modicum of lacing behind. Smells of bananas, grapes and lemons with a biscuity aroma in the background. There's not much going on with the palate on this one. Has a hint of wheat and biscuity malts. No hefe-like fruitiness to speak of. A sweet undercurrent of honey exists as does a hint of spice. Very easy to drink, but lacking in the creamy and fruity goodness involved in most good hefe's."
"This brew poured a slightly hazy yellow. Decent head on top that vanished quickly. The honey flavors were lost on me, but there was a cloying sweetness that was ubiquitous throughout tasting. It seemed like a very mediocre light beer that was just too sweet tasting."
"After about half of the glass, the flavor develops a bit more. The honey is more noticeable, with a hint of lemon. I suppose it would be an okay session beer, but it doesn't taste good enough to be worth it. It barely differs from the standard American macrobrews."
"Could easily do a session, but wouldn't necessarily want to."
"Drinkability - pretty good session beer for summer, I wouldn't turn another one down."
"Pours a golden pilsner body that has minimal bubble or sediment... head is generous and two-fingered in its cumulous cloud effect... honey hints with lemon zest that are overpowered by lager malts--not as bright or sweetas expected... rather watery initially, with a hint of depth at the throat...light-bodied, almost a pale pilsner in comparison... iced tea sweetness evaporates the initial honey approach--lacks the strength to significantly rate higher in the taste category...won't be remembered for much more than another Leinie fruit beer that refreshes--but this close to Mike's Hard Lemonade makes me wonder if I should juts have one of those..."
"There are better American wheat beers made out there but I still respect the small craft brewers even if they sell out to the big boys."
"I could enjoy a few of these beers during the evening on a summer day if I wanted to. Nothing, I plan to buy a lot of."
"drinkability - I though I was tasting a macro lager here. Goes down like water, not fond of this one."
"D: Nothing too impressive or good. Just a thin, overcarbonated beer with no taste. I was not impressed at all with this one."
"Decent, but not as good as Sunset Wheat in my opinion. Not bad after cutting the grass on a hot summer day, if nothing else."
"Very easy to drink. Pretty smooth and refreshing beer. Not much stands out, but I wouldn't mind having a few."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but it wouldn't be the first wheat I'd reach for. Not a bad beer, nothing really fantastic though. 3.0"
"Truly not worth the calories. What a huge disappointment after I was strangely intrigued by the Sunset Wheat. I actually liked that. This on the other hand is a total waste of time."
"Leinenkugel got it right with this brew. The honey is blended perfectly with this wheat beer. Crisp, clean, and extremely refreshing. Pours a nice golden color with decent head and good carbonation. Easy on the taste buds, the honey is just right and does not overpower this beer like the others that I have had. Not a lot of complexity to this one, which is what makes it a great choice."
"All in all, this was a refreshing brew, but was a far cry from the style it claimed to be."
"A hard pour delivers a good size head in my pint glass. The head quickly shrinks to just enough to cover the surface. A steady stream of carbonation keeps this coating through out the tasting. Light yellow in color due to being filtered, I place my nose in the glass. A very faint aroma of honey is detected. Tasting it shows though even less of a honey flavor. Just enough sweetness to be refreshing.Not really picking up any of the usual weiss flavors (clove, banana). Not really getting a hop taste except a little in the aftertaste. I can see having a couple on the patio."
"Pours a crisp light orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma was very slight sweet malt, but barely even that. The taste was just a slight bit better than BMC, really nothing special, not even any characteristics of a wheat beer. The beer was very light, but very watery. This is not one I'd try again, but not quite a drain pour either."
"I'm lost on the popularity of this beer? The marketing VP at Leinies s/ get a big raise, cuz there is no way this beer got this popular by its' taste alone. I can handle a couple glasses from a really fresh keg if someone else is buying but that's about the nicest thing I can say about it."
"D - A good wheat beer with the honey adding some slight sweetness and keeping it from becoming too dry"
"Drinkability is moderate, a nice unoffensive light wheat ale with a touch of sweetness, subdued flavors but easy-drinking"
"pours with small head that actually stays around for 20 seconds or so. Aroma slight hint of honey and alcohol smell. Appearence clear blonde color. Flovor was average. It's not a swill beer, but nothing there to really get your taste buds going. decent price at 5.99 a six. Could hardly taste the honey in this beer. I've had way better wheat beers before. Nothing special."
"Clear lemon pour, not much in the way of white head. No aroma at all - nuttin happening here. Taste was more of a soapy pilsner than a honey wheat. Body was crisp and thin. Decent drinking in the summer heat, but find a beer with more taste."
"D - Refreshing, but not tasty."
"I was dissapointed with this beer. It really seemed more like a normal run of the day lager, no fruity esters or wheat taste...I wonder how much wheat is in it, I'd venture to guess less than 50% which in my mind disqualifies it as a wheat beer. Sorry."
"D- Not nearly as drinkable as the other Leine's. I finished a six pack but it took over a week to have the desire to sit down for each one (and I could only take one at a time taste wise)."
" I do regret paying the $7.99 for this sixer."
"M/D: Not to light and not to heavy of a feel. The head is creamy and the brew doesn't leave your mouth super dry. A superb thirst quencher and good drinkability."
"This honey weiss does not improve much on their other pale wheat. It shares a similar yellow color and has a marginal beige head. The nose and taste were both light and grainy. A decent body has to open up to loose some of the carbonation. The honey flavor is a bit artificial to balance well."
"D: Light. Interesting light complexity. Basically enjoyable and relatively thirst quenching. Not bad."
"D: It is quite drinkable, but since the flavor is not that impressive, I would not have many more of these."
"D: Although drinkable, not something I'd buy a full case of. I have six bottles from their Adventure Sampler and that's plenty for me."
"The feel is a slightly bubbly lagery feel. Somewhat dry. It's a light, minor drin. Pleasant enough, though. Good for summer. Goes down easy for sure."
"M&D- Feels real good with a light-body and slight carbonation that downs easy"
"D: Moderate and one for the beach or for newcomers to beer and the lassies."
"The mouthfeel was almost like some sort of beer/soda hybrid that was very light and very carbonated. Highly drinkable, but I just wouldn't want many more."
"Drinkability: This is what the beer was obviously made to do. Very drinkable and clean, too much so."
"D-would be better on a hot day I'm sure,overall very average"
"D: Very drinkable beer. Easy to handle and a good transition beer. With no strong taste will make for a good beer to relax with."
"D- Not my favorite Leinenkugel offering. It's refreshing, but it tastes just like an american wheat with nothing spectacular going for it. It is a warm day and I am enjoying it though."
"D: Drinkable enough but there is not a lot of uniqueness in this brew to suggest it."
"A seethru, straw yellow body with a one-finger head that died and left no lacings (the first time I got a small head with my hefe glass). A very strong citric smell, tart even, with some spiciness also hitting the nose. The tart, citric smell is also in the taste, but it is a little too much and this beer is not as smooth as it should be, as the honey seems to be overpowered and it is a little too crisp. I am a huge fan of hefes/wheat/weiss beers, and summer seasonals are my favorite, but this is one that I will skip in a crowded marketplace."
"12oz twist-off bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a . The aroma is sweet honey, faint grainy malt and a touch of hops. The taste is sweet honey up front followed by the grainy malt and a mild hop finish. The taste is a little too sweet for me, and could use a little more hops to balance out the sweet flavors. The mouthfeel is thin and fizzy from the high amount of carbonation. Overall, this tastes pretty much like a macro lager with some honey added. I doubt I would purchase this one again."
"Pours a clear golden straw yellow color with 1 pinky of bubbly white head, some retention, spotty lacing. Smells of wheat with a touch of honey and some lemon. Taste is very biscuit-like with honey and vanilla, and a finish of lemon. Light in body with good carbonation, sweet with a crisp finish. Very refreshing and easy to drink, but not much going on to really excite the palate."
"When I picked this one out I expected what I got. Pours a bright, clear gold, with an unusually white head. Smells of honey off the comb and a little wheat esters. Tastes a bit thin but up front honey and a little wheat undertones. Pretty easy drinking and an alright after dinner drink."
"pours a crystal clear straw yellow color with a short white head that quickly faded to the beer and no lace. weak smell of cooked veggies matchs the taste thats all i want to say about that. mouthfeel was watery and carbonation weak. drinkability zero."
"Before I drank this I didn't know leinenkugel's made a beer not infused with fruit so I had to try it. It has a nice subtle honey taste, but no extreme flavors popping out on your tongue. Nicely carbonated and an average head...about 1.5 fingers. Overall it's a little bland for me...like a fizzy yellow american beer with a little better ingredients with honey added. I think I'll stick with what Leine does best and that's fruit infused beers."
"Top it off, overly carbonated and watery."
"12oz bottle from Tiger Town in Gardiner. Pours a very light yellow translucent body with virtually no head. Smells of some lemon and vanilla, faintly... Tastes like biscuit malt, with hints of lemon and hints of diacetyl. Very light in body with ample carbonation to make this a refreshing easy drinker. The flavor though, while okay, isn't great and certainly isn't the best of the style I've had."
"This isn't a bad brew, it's just not memorable and basically average all around. It's easy as hell to drink and makes for a decent thirst quencher in the summer, but I can still think of many others that I'd grab in the hot summer months before this one."
"D - Would not drink this beer again. This beer had good potential but did not live up to anything. Easily a below average brew."
" ~ I enjoy this beer and am proud to say it's brewed only an hour and a half away from my home. If you haven't had a Honey Weiss, you need to try one and see what the buzz is about."
"D= for me, not much, but on average probably acceptable to most."
"D - Nothing too suprising here. Not great, but not bad. Seems a little typical, but ok for the style. I'm a little biased, though, because it takes something extra for this style to impress me."
"Leinenkugel's did nothing for me. It wasn't complex in taste and certainly didn't distinguish itself in any way."
"Quite refreshing and thirst-quenching. Honey aspect pretty well-incorporated into the wheat aspect. Not bad for a basic American Pale Wheat Ale."
"This beer was a ""honey"" color with a relatively transparent body. No real head, minimal at best with no real lacing. This beer didn't have much of of a smell. There was some notes of malt and in no way any sweetness as expected in the title. This is an average beer at best. I enjoy Leinenkugel's beer, however this is not one of the best examples. There is a higher amount of carbonation and a slight bitter after taste with this brew. Ok in a variety pack, but not much to buy on it's own."
"It looks like a macro, but it's not, really. It smells like a macro, but it's not, really. What saves it from macro-hood, though, is the flavor which, while far from impressive, is at least well tastier than most macros. And this helps make it roughly average (read, mediocre) in its drinkability. Sure, sucking down a couple of these on a hot day might be doable. However, I'm not sure I would look this way because it's not often this would be the best I have on hand."
"Verdict: Similar to J.W Dundees Honey Brown due to being a beer with honey in it. Just not very impressive here. Drinkable but you aren't missing anything if you haven't had it already."
"All in all a decent, refreshing beer, nothing more."
"Could drink this beer all day in the heat. The only problem is that it is a little too boring to drink more than a couple of these."
"Poured this into my weisen glass. Absolutely clear light orange. You literally could read through this. A thin layer of suds lay on top and left zero lacing. Smell is comparable to a musty barnyard but with hints of some zesty fruit, mainly lemon. Not very appetizing. Taste is essentially nonconfrontational. There isn't too much there. I noticed some honey as advertised, but it's quite subtle. Some citrus is apparent. I didn't even notice any wheat until the aftertaste. Body is extremely light and it is overly carbonated. Boooring!"
"Prosit, MK"
"This brilliantly clear gold beer (w. 3/4 inch head that recedes) is not an ale at all, I would bet, but a lager. There is some subtle malty flavor that makes it reminiscent of a german lager, and the maltyness alone makes it better than the american lagers, but it has no wheat beer flavors (American and especially Bavarian). That said, its subtle barley sweetness tastes better than many American lagers and it's easy drinking, smooth in the mouth, and there's nothing wrong about that!"
"D - This isn't great but it would make an okay session beer. It certainly is easy drinking."
"D: The aggressive carboantion distracts and hurts the drinkability of this beer. Drank like a macro produced American wheat, then again AB does have their hand in the pot."
"In a word? ""Watery."" I really wanted to like this one. (I'm a Leinie's Lodge card holder.) It looked great (nice gold color) in the glass, decent head, nice carbonation, a bit of sweet wheat (very little) in the nose... smelled like beer. And it tasted good (e.g., refreshing), but a bit watery in the taste department. You could throw back a bunch of these and really enjoy them. Nothing bad in the taste dept (no metallic, no strange bitterness, no stale flavors, etc.) but when you start rating a beer by what it's NOT, you had probably better move on to something more flavorful. That said, I'd definitely buy this for my summer BBQ parties. It would go well with food."
"Pours light yellow with short lasting white head. Looks like a light lager basically. Smell is light but slight honey and malt. Taste is decent, crisp from the moderately high carbonation, and mildly sweet from the honey and lingers for just a bit in the after taste along with just a touch of wheatiness. This doesn't taste bad by any means, but is very light and simple. A good replacement for a cheap lager, and it is easy to drink, crisp and refreshing, but nothing to blow you away."
"Leinenkugels Honey Weiss is best quaffed during a hot day. Very easy drinking and refreshing, making it a good session brew."
"Buy Honey Brown."
"Drinkability- This is a great session brew as it is low in alcohol, light and tasty, and it also is a great crossover brew leading some BMC drinkers to the craft brew world."
"Sparkley gold with a thin white head that fizzes out quick. I don't smell much of anything. I detect a kind of grainy earthy odor but that's it. No honey or anything special. It kind of just smells like a Miller High Life... Eh, a little better than that, maybe, but not much. I think I can pick up a subtle hint of honey in the taste, however. It has a grainy aftertaste. Anyway, it's light, a touch of sweet, and easy to drink. A gimmick beer I think. With Leinenkugel's beers I'll stick with the Sunset Wheat and Big Butt Dopplebock. Those are good. But I'll avoid the Red and the Honey Weiss. And those are the four that I've have had from this brewer so far. But at prices similar to Bud, Miller, etc. I'd take Leinenkugel's for sure."
"Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat is one of my all-time favorite brews... had high hopes for their Honey Weiss, which didn't disappoint... pours a lucid, clear, apple-juice color, average appearnce with minimal head that soon dissipated... not much to talk about in way of appearance... Overall, the smell was rather bland and not too enticing... more average than anything else... taste was very crisp, clear, and refreshing, with a nice sweet, honey taste... citrus, fruit-like flavor that was typical of the brewery, very satisfying and would be perfect on a hot Summer day... definitely a beer for the warmer-weather months... good mouthfeel although slightly light and watery and very easy drinkability that went down like Gatorade... no alcohol or bitterness deteced at all... an average sample from Leinenkugel, although their Sunset Wheat is certainly a clear winner... Worth a try..."
"Overall i liked the beer even though i am not a Pale Ale lover."
"It was okay, I'd drink it again. But I probably won't go out and buy it myself."
"I really didn't like this one the first time and like it less this time around... If it was available in Boise, I would buy a few and try to turn my macro drinking coworkers and then chastise them for ever liking it."
"Overall: Very middle-of-the-road."
"I expected more out of this one--I should have read the reviews here first. Slight honey aroma. Pours very clear and pale yellow with a diminishing white head. Flavor is very light with nothing that stands out. I don't get any sweetness or honey flavor--it is pretty much flavorless with a light mouthfeel. Very dry with no aftertaste. This beer is easy to drink, but not something I'm going to buy again."
"Pours crystal clear with a firm gold color. Minimal head and minimal lacing. Smell is mild with just a tiny bit of sweetness, most likely from the honey. Taste is definitely honey influenced, but not that much in the grand scheme of things. Overall it seems like a typical beer that just got a shot in the arm with the honey. I have never had a wheat brew that was this light before. Something to try once, but nothing worth running to the end of the Earth for."
"Leinies Honey Weiss is what it is, an average American wheat beer. Everything about it is pretty unimpressive. The main thing I can say to its credit is that the honey aspect is nicely done. Its not at all a cloying, sugary honey flavor. The beer is very light gold/yellow in appearance, without much head to speak of. Its fairly smooth tasting, with grass being the prevalent flavor on my tongue. A good yard beer."
"Very clear golden color, disturbingly clear and gold, much like an american macro (or piss). White head disappears to a very thin collar and leaves no lacing. Smell is pretty close to a macro, too, with something else, maybe green apples. Not really much honey there, i don't know if it would have helped, though. Nothing interesting in there. Taste is very similar. I don't think i will ever have this beer again, even if the GF wants a couple more bottles. Truly not a good beer, well below average."
"Its a nice golden color and is very clear; it has some mild carbonation and a good thick head that thins out and has a little lacing to it. It smelled a little sweet and I could barley pick up on the wheat in it, it just wasnt very big on aroma. It has a smooth semi-crisp sweet flavor and is a little bit bitter with a fairly light mouth feel. The aftertaste certainly brings out the bitterness in it, but its not overwhelming."
"Overall, a quaffable beer, but not one i would want much of."
"D - Its a step above a macro but not buy much I'd rather drink this than BMC"
"Poured a macro-lager-looking yellow with little head that dissipated very quickly. Aroma was weak with a bit of skunk to it. This tastes nothing like a wheat ale to me. Slight hint of honey in the taste, but the flavor is weak. Not offensive by any means, just a little weak for my tastes. I would not seek this out."
"i was excited to see this for sale in philadelphia in a variety pack since i can only get the sunset wheat in new york . well the honey weisse was a big disappointment i mean big . there was nothing to this beer i think id even drink a rolling rock over this im just wondering if i got some bad ones because the red lager and sunset wheats in the pack were very nice . p.s the other beer in the pack was the creamy dark not that good either"
"I am not very big on this beer. Tried it several times, and its actually never been very bad, but its also never been good. The idea that they even include honey, or weiss, in the name of this one is beyond me, as it doesnt seem to include either. Just a plain, run of the mill, macro lager for all I'm concerned."
"d-one of my favorite light beers, like i stated above the honey is very light and can easily drink a few of these beers"
"Pale colored beer with an almost non-existent aroma.Taste is water with a faint hint of honey although no sweetness is detected.I can't slam this beer because although it's tasteless it is by no means repulsive.You can get the same taste from a ice cold coors light for half the price."
"This beer is probably my least favorite of Leinenkugel's main offerings. Smell is not very strong, and not very distinct. This is refreshing, but fairly basic. I can taste a hint of honey towards the end. Mouthfeel is a bit weak, though I have to say given the very dense taste of the Blue Moon honey beer I had recently, maybe it is better to err on the side of less-dense rather than more dense for a honey-laden beer. Overall, though I'm a Leinie's fan, this is not particularly special."
"Overall this is another ok beer from Leinenkugel. The crispness and thirst quenching qualities would probably be better served at a cooler temperature."
"Again, I wish Texas could get some of Leiny's good beers (like Creamy Dark). As it is, I like this better than the Sunset Wheat, but that is not saying much. I can make out an odd distinct champagne like sweetness and carbonation for some reason, and it is a turn off for me."
"Don't know what to say. I was pretty excited about trying this delicious Wisconsin brew, but was a bit disappointed. Nice color with nice head, but the smells are of a regular plain hoppy ale or even a lager. Tastes have hints of honey and sweet malts, but not a lot. Mainly hops and a milky taste, but nothing too spectacular. Oddly enough I agree with many reviews when they say it reminds me a macro, because the honey and sweetness is not present enough to say that this is a wonderful craft ale. Overall, Wisconsin has much better brews to offer, don't settle for this rather plain one."
"drinkability is great. there isn't much here to lower drinkability; this is a light brew without any bold or excessive flavors. mild and refreshing, which is just what it is trying to be."
"Leinenkugel's Honey Weiss pours a golden yellow with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma reminds me of honey and cheap lager. I guess there is what you could call honey sweetness in the flavor. It also has a cheap lager type flavor to it. I'm not impressed."
"Easy to drink, but why bother..."
"Drinkability- I would drink it again."
"D: I can't believe I used to like these, we all grow up I suppose but if I were going to drink a Leine I'd stick with a red."
"Uninteresting, hardly more flavorful than sweet water."
"D: Accessible, but not enticing."
"D- This one is drinkable but not very enjoyable. Drinkability on the same level as your average macro lager. This beer was unoffensive but a letdown. I probably won't have it again. Sunset Wheat is a much better offering from Leine's."
"Eric"
"This beer is easy to drink. Because of the sweetness, one is enough."
"Drinkability- This beer is refreshing and goes down easily, perfect for summer"
"Overall, this seemed like a very insipid and uninspired beer. It has some flavor, but nothing amazing."
"Wow, where to begin with this one. Leinenkugel has brewed some fine beers that I really enjoy (Red Lager, Sunset Wheat come to mind). So I figured why not try this honey weiss. This beer absolutly reeks! It more or less tastes like a water-down stale natural light! There was little to no head, mouthfeel was non-existent, and it looks like a Falls City Lager on its best day. I picked up a bottle while shopping at Target of all places. Stay clear of this one fellas. If you are gonna try something from Leinenkugel try anything but this."
"Will not buy again. Second of the sampler pack. So far, so bad!"
"Fizzy yellow with very little head. Lacing is okay, head retention is not. Aroma is a little sweet, maybe slightly skunky. Smells of adjunct. Flavor is more of the same, no honey at all, mild wheat but also other weak grain tastes, very thin. Having had Sunset Wheat before this one, I thought Leinenkugel's might actually be decent at that style, but this one proved me wrong. No honey, no weiss, no Honey Weiss."
"Light malt aroma, with some residual citrus fruit smell. Very crisp and clean flavor. Slight honey taste, but not enough to be overly sweet or cloying. Clean, wheat malt with a dryish finish. A very easy to drink brew, a good summer time beer."
"overall this is a very good beer that i can see as a session beer"
"Maybe your buddies who drink nothing other than Miller Light will enjoy this one."
"out this one again, when there are so many better alternatives out there."
"D - This stuff sucks."
"Light flavored, not quite as malty as some of this style. I think one problem with this is the glass that it came in. I ordered the 22 oz size, draught, and it came in a large thick soda glass, not a large half-liter weizen glass that it should've been served in. I will hold that against Tony Roma's at the Mall of America, not Leinie's. This had a light lagered flavor, so to give it a kick I went against the norm and dropped in the lemon wedge that came with the glass. It did help a little. If you want a good summery beer, and you live within the Leinie's distribution area, I will give this a good recommendation. Once summer is over, you'll want to switch to something different, but this will do nicely during for the season"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a light yellow-golden color with a glistening white bubbly head. Smell is mostly of the wheat malt and slightly sweet of honey. Taste is like the nose, no apparent hops but well balanced with a clean finish. Body is very light with lots of creamy carbonation. This is an easy to drink beer, light in body; not too much on the flavor, but what is there isn't bad."
"D: Fairly drinkable beer. To me it leaves a bit of an aftertaste that is slightly unpleasnt but I still enjoy this beer."
"Big, puffy, inviting white head. Clear, golden yellow; the yeasts have definitely been filtered out of this beer. Why? Wheat detectable in the nose, along with aged apples, frosted Christmas cookies, tangy honey, half-baked bread. Not bad., though not as distinctive as that probably makes it sound. The taste-pretty much what I expected from the smell. Better than your average Leiney, but a little bland. Dry mouthfeel; a little watery. Sticky honey finish; I would have preferred it a little cleaner."
"Clear yellow gold. Short head of bright white foam drops readily. Limited lacing at best. Sweetish malt in the nose with a flicker of yeasty sulpur and some delicate honey. Medium-light bodied. Delicately crisp, smooth. Flavor offers a drizzle of honey flavor, some mild wheat character, and a sublime but balancing bitterness. Well-rounded but on the sweet side. Finishes clean and semi-dry with a touch of residual honey-like sweetness. Never cloying. Accessible. Enjoyable and refreshing!"
"Not a bad beer, not a good beer. very average. A little watery on the back of the palate. Not a lot going on. Some honey and wheat characteristics. No real bitterness to note. A no frills beer, best saved for the summer time. I got a leinenkugel's sampler case for 20 bucks, never having heard of their beers. I may have some every once in a while and will offer them to my friends as well. Not bad. Eh."
"Pretty good-sized head and a nice, golden color. Yeasty, sweet aroma. Taste is sweet, with a bit of wheat character and yeast. Has a lager-like clean character in the taste. A bit of hops in the finish. Light, bubbly mouthfeel. Drinkable, but pretty straightforward in its sweet, light character."
"Overall a very drinkable and refreshing beer. Certainly not a wheat ale, but with the lemon element, more like a very drinkable macro summer ale. Thanks to makeitavintage for this one."
"The appearance is a light golden with mild carbonation amounting to little to no head. The smell is slight maybe a hint of the honey. Tastewise, I found it average, medium bodied at best, a bit tinny as well. The mouthfeel was light, a bit watery. Overall, it is a beer that you could sit down with and tip back a few, worth a try, fair price as well."
"CONTAINER TYPE: bottle FRESH: y PURCHASED @: cub foods COST: 7/6pack HEAD: slight LACE: minimal COLOR: REFLECTED- yellow TRANSMITTED- yellow/org hue AROMA: grains MOUTHFEEL: light PALATE: somewhat adjusts TASTE: I cannot detect the honey CONDITIONS: MOWING/WORKING ON CAR- n WITH FRIENDS- n SIPPING- n GET MY BUZZ ON- n"
"This is on odd beer. Doesn't look, smell, or taste like a wheat. Not even an American wheat. Buy a single, not a six pack."
"I seemed to have liked this beer better from the bottle. On tap, I didn't get much wheat or honey out of the flavor, aroma, or texture. The beer shows up as clear as any other pilsner that I have drank. No real head retention to mention. Smells and tastes like cereal grains with no wheat esters, sweetness, or breadiness. The there is an additional (artificial) sweetness that may loosely resemble honey. The beer falls weak and watery quickly leaving a bitter grain-husk bite-ey sensation that lingered into the aftertaste. Didn't really care much for this on tap."
"The beer pours a nice clear golden color with nice carbonation and weak head. The mouthful is nice and crisp. The wheat taste is crisp without the grainy yeast texture. The honey sweatens the deal a little without being overbearing. The hops are nicely matched and even out the finish. Good beer for summer or those wanting to try craft beers for the first time."
"Honey Weiss is an attractive golden color with an average level of carbonation. Head is of a medium height and is somewhat thick. Retention is weak. Taste is a combination of a moderately crisp wheat flavor and an underlying honey-tinged malt sweetness. The honey is used well here, it enhances the malt flavor without taking over. Wheat flavor becomes most apparent in the finish. Drinkability is high, this is a nice stab at the American pale wheat style."
"Mouthfeel was average as average could be. Not too carbonated at all. But average weight on the tounge."
"Im not a real Weiss beer fan, and this beer sure as hell didnt convince me otherwise. Yellowish-red appearance with a nice head was about all it really had going for it. Not a bad tasting beer, but just not anything that made it special. Most likely wont be drinking this again, since there are way too many beers that are so much better."
"Overall, a very light bodied but highly drinkable beer. Carbonation reminds me very much of a macro, but it does have a nice clean, crisp finish. Nothing really good or bad about this beer."
"Drinks okay in the spring, but not sweet or complex enough to reccomend to other than fans of the style or curiosity seekers"
"Part of a Leiny giftpack I received as a gift. Quite a light golden color with a medium creamy white head. Moderate carbonation and lacing. Aroma is lighter with a honey touch and maybe a bit of a grassy note. Taste is also light. I don't taste too much wheat but more of a lighter honey aspect and a bready kind of taste. There is a lighter grassy aspect towards the finish and somewhat in the body. The honey seems to be done well, I notice it but its not too cloying like I thought it might be. Still, this is a take it or leave it type beer. Fairly average by all accounts. I don't think I'd buy this again, but it wasn't bad."
"Very easy drinking beer. Good for those who want an alternative to the typical macros, but more experiences beer drinkers will probably find this bland."
"D- A very easy drinking and simple brew. An obvious pick for a summer time beer, or even a stepping stone brew for the drinking impaired. Paired well with some pickled herring and stone ground wheat crackers."
"Dits ok, as I remember. It works pretty well with the buffalo wings that I am eating. Might be good for the upcoming warm months, but it lacks dominate flavors."
"I'm re-reviewing this brew as I feel my first review was too critical, and perhaps the bottle I had wasn't the freshest. Poured out to a fairly typcial yellow color with vigorus carbonation and a small head of white foam. Aromas of honey and hops, some watery malt. Taste is quaffable for a hot summer day; malt, hints of wood laden honey, earth, a touch of spice. Mouthfeel is ok, very macro-carbonated, if you will. Fair drinkability. It's not bad, it's just not all that good."
"smells like a pale lager, looks like a pale lager and tastes pretty much like a pale lager. booorrrring"
"The drinkability is okay, but nothing great because of the wierd hops. This whole beer is just average."
"drinability: its a session, thats fo sho"
"Pale yellow color, thin white head that doesn't really leave much lacing. The smell is light pale malts and a hint of spiciness...couldn't pick up much honey, but there may be a bit lingering there. Flavor is weak malts and tastes quite cheap and macro-ish. No real hearty wheat character...if there was more honey flavor and more wheat to round this thing out, this might be a respectable brew. As it is, it was ok to have a few free glasses on the house, but it's not something I'd run out to buy."
"This beer came a bright gold with a touch of orange with a haze of bubbles sustaining a thin larger bubbled head. Smells of dirty corn with a comical honey flavor and candy sourness. Tastes of more dirty corn with a sharp sourness (an added lemon makes this a bit more manageable) with a decisive honey-like finish. Mouth feel is medium with a medium carbonation. This is a non-intrusive and relatively flavorful beer that is very easy to drink."
"In my opinion this is just a ""good, solid"" beer. It's not fantastic and won't set the world on fire, but it's good. I think it has a very clean flavor. The color is also good...more clear than I'd expect for a wheat beer. The smell is also good...I also smelled a yeast/wheat smell. The mouthfeel and drinkability are also good. Like I said...it's just a good, solid beer. I'll say it ranks as ""better than most"" in my book."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy, but at the high price of flavor. Not bad, but you could do a lot better with a different Leinie's."
"Finishes very slightly dry. Easy to drink, fairly smooth. Drink it with spicy food and save the good stuff for another time."
"Drinkability - Not real good, not something I'd keep around."
"The taste was rather plain. Similar to a macro with no hops. The malt was really the only flavor, and it tasted more like pale or base malts. No real wheat flavor and no real weizen flavor. The body was very light and really more of a watery taste to it. I was not impressed with this beer at all."
"Pale golden and bubbly in appearance, looks like your standard macro. Smells adjuncty and malty sweet, that's about it. Tastes adjuncty and malty/honey sweet with a bit of a metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is macro bubbly and thin. It take it over a BMC any day, but there isn't much to praise here. A sweet malty drinker, gets the job done."
"Drinkability: No this is not a great beer. Not really all that good either but that bad. Just boring. But this price is nice, so you could spend more and end up with something worse I guess, but its still a beer I wouldnt recommend bothering with. Not a good representation of the style either."
"Paid $4.99 for a 6 pack"
"Pours a clear pale golden color with no head. Isn't thsi supposed to be a wheat beer, and thus have a cloudy appearance with a big head? The stench is of aour piss. The taste is not unlike the stench. The mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Overall, this is a horrilbe beer. My speculation is that the people at Leinenkugal call corn wheat and wheat corn. There is certainly no detectable wheat in the beer."
"Straw yellow color, fluffy white head. Not a bold tasting wheat. As for honey in the flavor I'm hard press in finding it with this beer. If sweetness was what the honey brought to the table it's there. The beer had a very dry finish which I though took away from it being a refreshing beer on a hot summer day."
"Appearance is clear yellow, and an aggressive pour yields a decent white head of foam that disperses quickly. Aroma is not pleasant, containing a little malt and other unidentifiable ingredients  but honey isnt one of them. The taste is BORING, and unbelievably lacking in one ingredient  BEER!! Over carbonated and a dismal disappointment."
"Nothing impressive and is it just me or can anybody really taste the honey? Being from Minnesota I see this stuff everywhere and I have to admit it is an affordable brew for those last few days before the next pay check. Definatly does not stand out amoungst other simiar beers in its class."
"Real glad to try this one...thanks again ZAP."
"Finally getting around to reviewing this stuff, have had it many times in years past. Found a Leinie's 12 pack sampler for $6.99 on closeout, probably the only way you could convince me to buy it. Clear gold in color, almost no head, just a couple bubbles. Smell is of nothing much, light malt and something adjuncty. Taste is unimpressive and boring. The little sweetness that the honey imparts doesn't make up for how poorly crafted this stuff is. Not a very good beer, aviod unless you get a deal like I did."
"Brought this back from my trip to Minnesota along with quite a few others from Leinenkugel's. The body to this brew is like no other, and I can't say its particularly good. Its lighter than golden and literally is almost water colored but slightly hazy. Very strange. There is a good frothy bleach white head however. The nose is mostly pale with some hints of honey to come. The mouthfeel has an edgy, pin prickly feel. There is certainly a full malt character in this offering and the honey notes are a lot more subtle than I would have suspected. In the finish, you get a nice peppery compliment to the mellowing honey character. Very average overall."
"This brew tasted like a very average lager to me. If it had some honey for weiss qualities it would be a bit more enjoyable, but it almost seemed like false advertising. A very unmemorable experience."
"By and large an unimpressive beer. I know a lot of people who drink this as their beer because it's affordable, but you get what you pay for. It's drinkable, but only as a last resort. The flavor is very bland, with little distinction, but it isn't distinguished or otherwise worthy of note."
"As far as Leiney's beers go, I think this is one of the better. The beer pours a clear, pale yellow color with a 2 finger head that falls to oat the beer, with a nice active carbonation as well. The nose is slightly honey sweet, but also a little harsh grainey tones as well. The flvor is strong grain with a honey sweetness on the finish. Not bad for an American wheat. The feel is on the light side of moderate, with a little too much carbonation. Overall, this beer is easy drinking and refreshing. There are some shortcomings, but its servicable."
"Thin on the body, like a macro, but it's pretty darn smooth and you can pound these all night."
"It has a straw color apperence with little head or lacing. Its suppose to taste like honey but I tasted only hops and wheat. Basically, the good thing is its a beer and not water. But the taste is average for a wheat ale of its kind. I was not great but not bad. I would drink it if thats the best you have."
"This is a pretty beer, bright straw in color with a white head (not much lacing however). Not much in the aroma, some maltiness and yeast, but no hops and no honey. The flavor is nice, sweet and then yeasty with that wheat aftertaste. How much honey is in this I wonder? This is a decent summer beer, good at a picnic, a ballgame or the golf course."
"Pours a nice light color with a foamy white head. I could barely taste the ""honey", drinking it both at room temperature and cold. It tasted, like well, a good german beer. Smooth, very little hops, a little malt, but overall, very neutral. Went good with the hot food I was eating. This is a ""dead of the summer"" type beer."
"Had on-tap at the Miller Factory in Milwaukee."
"12 oz bottle, this stuff pours LIGHT straw,clear with a tiny bubble,creamy head and leaves nice lacing. Nose is sugary, so far so good, so how does this stuff taste? Very little taste, too bad. light, sweet, a wiff of honey and that about it, no yeastyness, no hops, not even slight malt notes. Just light, watery and boring."
"A bottle brought back from vacation by a good friend who was home for the summer. It's a local favorite in Wisconsin. Thanks doofusboy!!"
"Pours fizzy, clear yellow with a small head that doesn't last long and leaves no lacing. (Where's the haze normally associated with a weiss?) Aroma is mild malt with a bit of honey. Taste is slightly malty, honey lends a cidery aftertaste. Little hop flavor. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Really not that bad a beer... nothing offensive about it... but nothing really outstanding about it either."
"Is this really a wheat beer? Don't think so. When poured in the glass this brew virtually had no head. Taste like a macro style pilsner. It goes down good, and taste great ice cold on a hot Kansas summer day, however, I don't think this will be a brew that visits the ol fridgo very often."
"Nothing I'd go out and buy, but it sure beats a bottle of Bud. Really boring. The label is nice, with that old-time sort of look. Nothing like what I'd call a weissbier, but it's an ok beer for after a long day of work. Thanks to oldcrustacean for the bottle."
"My first Leinenkugel, courtesy of my next door neighbor whose old friend from Wisconsin brought some of these by. Pours a clear, very light yellow body with a smallish white head that drops immediately. No lacing. Aroma is sweet clover honey and some sweet malt. No hop presence here. Mouthfeel is light bodied and low on carbonation. Carbonation could have been affected by the long journey in a car trunk. The taste is sweet. Malty sweet, honey sweet, and some wheat grain in the background. Again, no hop presence. Drinkability suffers from the sweetness, which is almost one dimensional. Not a Weiss that I would care to have again."
"This is an extremely light and clear yellow liquid. The head is white and initially large, but quickly fades into nothingness. The aroma is faint, but its got a little citrus-like wheat character and a touch of honey. Not much else. Its heavily carbonated, and has a very light mouthfeel. Theres a bit of grain and a moderate maltiness. All in all, this is a little too sweet for me. I hope for a wheat beer to be refreshing, but this one seems to finish with too much of a sugary, honey-like sensation. Its drinkable, but nothing special."
" Overall: Wow! What a crappy beer. This is one of the worst micro/craft brews I've ever had. I had a stomach ache after just three of these. I will never buy this beer again, and I urge you to save yourself from the bad beer blues that this crap induces. This beer is subpar in every aspect - gross, to say the least."
"Poured to a very pale yellow almost like grapefruit juice, with liitle to no head to speak of. I'm no chemist, but honey+wheat do not equal skunky (normally). The merit of this beer is its longevity. Tasted exactly the same (maybe even better) when room temperature was achieved. Macro brewing personified. Lifeless and redundant."
"I'm usually able to appreciate Leine's ability to make somewhat different pseudo-micro stuff, but this was a disappointment from the get-go. First, It poured CLEAR yellow, with little white, foamy head. Not at all what a wheat beer is ""supposed"" to be. Very sour, sickly sweet smell, not at all endearing. Tastes vaguely like honey, but overall, more like a honey lager, and not a honey wheat. Mouthfeel is almost greasy, coating the tongue and throat, not enjoyable and definitely making this a one time beer."
"The appearance of this beer is a light golden color with little head. It had a faint hop smell, and a slightly sweet taste with a hint of a hop taste. There was a smooth mouthfeel, but overall it is not an impressive brew. Though when there is limited choice, or your low on cash not a bad brew to have by far."
"Draught: This beer is a pale yellow color. I was expecting a large white fluffy head, but didn't get it. The aroma is somewhat non-descript. Some hints of sweetness, most likely from the honey. The taste is basically a little sweet, with a thinner body. Hops? I really didn't get any, but then again I've been drinking a lot of Imperial IPA's lately. Suprisingly, the beer was fairly satisfying: good for a hot day of drinking for no special reason."
"Pours a deep yellow with not much head to speak of,aroma is a little skunky with some fruity malt undertones but a rather unpleasant.Taste is real grainy with some fruity flavors with a biscuity malt flavors in the finish.Not as bad as I thought it would be it was given to me so I didnt have to pay for it so not a bad deal I guess."
"You can do better than this. Feel free to avoid it."
"This is a very plain and easy to drink beer. Flavor isn't bad but it really doesn't seem like a wheat at all. Easy going down."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is rather thin, but I think they carbonate this beer a little too much which tends to fill you up fast. Not a bad beer overall."
"If you don't want to be seen with a Budweiser or a Miller in hand and want to put on a ""microbrew"" facade, then perhaps this is the pale yellow beer for you. If you want real honey and wheat characteristics, look elsewhere."
"A rather dull, bright off-yellow hue, no carbonation, no head, very little action coming from this beverage. Somewhat of a wheaty aroma, faint at that. Just a touch on the creamy side, some wheat flavoring most noticeable in this character-lacking brew. Some sweetness, little to no hop presence, or malt presence for that matter. A grassy palate, nil honey detection. Could quench or refresh on a mild to warm day, but extremely masked flavorings, the honey and the weiss should be removed from the label as they do not exist in this line. A bland offering from a bland line of beers."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is not that bad. It has a slight weisen scent, but it seems a bit watery. There also seems to be a small light honey aroma as well. The taste is awful. It is quite watery and skunky with a small honey flavor. I don't taste much wheat here, but I guess it must have some. The mouthfeel is above average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks average. It is a terrible weisen. It's one and done for me."
"The High Falls Brewery of Wisconsin?"
"Pale honey-straw body with a small fizzy head. Faint cereal smells, maybe a hop or two. Taste is slightly sweet. Maybe some adjuncts in here... Honey? Well, perhaps, but it's not much different than Grain Belt's sweetness. Finish is short, but quenching, with a crisp wheat tang. I've had better glasses of this on tap, and it's sometimes the best choice among local bars in MN, especially in the summer."
"It can't be that hard to brew decent beer, can it? Give Honey Weiss a wide berth."
"It's really not horrible. there's very little to be offended by. has a slight sweetness in the aftertaste that's alright, but no honey. very little other flavor, medium-light body. This would be a good choice for people who drink a lot of miller light."
"Final Thoughts: Not what I expected. Definitely worse...but don't even get me started on the Berry Weiss."
"Skip this, let my the sacrifice of my tastebuds not be in vain."
"Overall: Leinie's is something I'd drink if the only other choices were macros, but given a choice, I'll stick with one of my more usual brews."
"On-tap at Upper Deck. Crystal clear golden color, small head that dissipated too quickly. Smell of fair grains, touch of mile hop and some sweet twang. No wheat beer aromas to speak of. Taste is watery with a touch of honey sweetness and hardly any hops. Kind of tasteless. Not impressed by this one at all, I was imagining a German style Weiss beer with real honey flavor too boot. Alas this is not one such nectar."
"You wouldn't know this was a wheat beer if the bottle didn't say. I mean, its appearance isn't your typical cloud or haze. Rather this beer is pretty clear, straw in color with a small, non-laceing white head. The aroma is not overly sweet, but about average. The taste is crisp, just a touch of honey blends this brew to a nice balance between the slight hop and the wheat malt. The mouth is left alittle dry, wanting more. Im not big on over-sweet brews, thisone just hit the spot. I'll buy thisone again."
"Another bottle from the Leinie's Lodge Tackle Box improved my opinion somewhat. There actually is a slight spicy weizen aspect in the nose that improves the tasting experience. Still can't say where the ""honey"" part comes in."
"Nice, sweet malt aroma, but not much to announce that this is a wheat. Very clean flavor - nothing noteworthy, other than the fact that there are no off-flavors, and ""technically"" pretty well made. Honey does seem to lend some sweetness, but no particular honey flavors are evident. A refreshing American pale wheat, but quite average."
"Clear golden. Thick, dense white head. Good retention. Aroma is a little spicy of all things. But I also get a little of that honey sweetness and pilsner like malt qualities on the nose. This is a refreshing beer, if a bit bland. Not really a lot going on that I like. Sweet qualities are really subtle. Matliness almost absent. Bitterness barely perceived. I'd take the Leiney's Original in a heartbeat over this one."
"i don't have much experiance with wheat beers, but this definately is not like the others i've had. pours very pale just like a mass produced lager with no head at all. there was no cloudiness as i've seen in other wheat beers. very slight honey flavor, but not too noticeable. save your money and just buy bud or miller, this really isn't any better and i don't thionk you're realy getting a wheat beer."
"This brew poured a large head of fine white bubbles. It has a transparent light lemon yellow body that left very little lacing. You can smell the honey flavor in its aroma. Its flavor is nice with a little mild honey flavor to it. It is initially smooth and stays that way through the finish. Overall, it was a nice beer to drink, but in this category I would rather have the Michelob Honey Lager."
"This was a pale gold colored beer, looks like most macros you would find. No head to be found. Theres a pretty watery taste to this drink, along with a slight wheat flavor. This isnt something you would be looking for if youre looking for a good tasting brew. Maybe if its hot out and youre looking to put down a lot of drinks, but other than that stay away."
"Very lite in color. Medium head, slow fade. Slight hint of wheat in the aroma. The characteristic rusty Linny taste is present. Just smoothed out slightly by the addition of honey. I would never classify this in the wheat family. But as the Linny family goes, it is one of their better offerings. A good summer, hot day beer. No fresh date."
"Leinie's Honey Weiss gets a bad rap and justifiably so. The name and idea of this beer are more appealing than the final result. It's too tame and certainly lacks many of the characteristics of a good weiss. Almost more like a lager. Despite that, Honey Weiss can be enjoyable on a hot summer day, if properly chilled. Goes down easy and hits the spot."
"Went well with the pizza & ribs I had for dinner. Not a beer I would search out on a regular basis. Seems to be popular with the macro drinkers who sometimes venture a little further afield."
"This brew poured a white foamy head. There was very little lacing on the sides of my glass. It had a honey aroma to it. There was carbonation rising to the top. There was no bitterness or aftertaste to this brew. This is not a brew that will be at the top of my list of favorite brews."
"Pours to a clear, brilliant straw color with a white head that quickly diminishes. The aroma is semi-sweet, with a touch of honey and a bit of grain. The flavor is light, with a barely noticeable touch of honey. It has a grainy flavor as well. It is light in body, smooth and easy drinking. A good session beer."
"Light golden yellow in color, with a good white head, some what lacey. Smells of grassy hops and grains, somewhat citrusy lemon-like, with just a hint of the honey. Taste is a bit watery with a good hop dryness and a touch of honey and lemon. You could easily drink a ton of these, but why?"
"Carbonation and body are average as is the drinkablility. There are much better beers out there though in this price range."
"Slightly cloudy light yellow in color with virtually no head to speak of. This is unexciting to drink. I taste just a faint honey and it's not natural. The mouthfeel is very thin and watery. This beer is refreshing though. It definitely would be a good tight budget summer session beer. But I'd rather cough up a couple more bucks for something better, like a weiss beer that tastes like a weiss beer."
"I am not a fan of Leinenkugel's. maybe it's the healthy Minnesota/Wisconsin rivalry. Poured straw yellow, with almost no head. Taste is very sweet. The honey is there, but also a faint fruitiness. Finishes sweet and syrupy. Overall, I had heard bad things about this beer. I did not hate it, in fact it was a nice change of pace. Wouldn't recommend it, but wouldn't turn down a bottle either."
"i'll continue the whipping of this beer............bright yellow color, thin head.  very muted aroma of honey and lemon.  tastes like nothing.  my taste buds are straining to pick up the wheat and honey characteristics..........oh well, it's pretty slammable which gets it a slightly higher drinkability score.  a good summer brew for the masses.   a bad anytime brew for the advocates."
"This brew lacks balance, honey and a sense of direction, which is not indicative of Leinenkugel."
"Actually, this beer may have wheat and honey but their distinctive traits have been strategically removed during the brewing process, what is left is a gold beer with a light head, a mild unoffending taste and aroma with a hint of lemon and sweetness.  The beer goes down smooth without offending anyone.  I guess this is a ""bier"" meant to be drunk when the temperature hits 85 and your cooler is empty of everything else."
"This doesn't hold a candle to Leine's Creamy Dark. Passable wheat beer but there just isn't much under the hood. Faint honey aroma. Straw colored with thin head. Very light flavor with little character."
"Surprisingly clear darker yellow color.  Head is sparse after 20 seconds.  A little estery aroma.  Certainly not an overbearing sense of honey (like a Michelob Honey Lager), but then there's not an overbearing sense of any flavor.  Vague maple sweetness, a little hazelnut in the aftertaste but little to no spice or any other Wheat characters.  This beer is pretty dang bad -- like many ""Leinies"" products, the flavors just aren't there."
"In some odd way...this beer reminds me of Corey Feldman.  I am just not sure why this was/is popular around here."
"This is a pretty popular beer up around these parts.  Big full head.  Light malt and lager  type aroma.  Clear and yellow-gold.  Can't taste honey or wheat in the flavor.  Really doesn't taste much different than a typical American lager, maybe even light beer.  Occassionally get a hint of wheat, but not much beyond that. Some bitterness to the finish. Medium fullness and carbonation.  Largely a summer thirst quencher.  I'm sure this brewery can make a better beer than this."
"Leinie Honey: this is arguably a Weiss beer, but it neither looks nor tastes like one.  It has a sweet aroma, and a nice light taste that you can drink all day.  But it is clear, and is nothing like any Weiss I’ve ever had, seen, or heard of.  Try Sammy’s new Weiss if you want to get close to the style."
"Not a bad beer if you want to wash down food or you want to quench your thirst. Not much there in the way of flavor or complexity."
"The flag-ship of their line I believe. At least it's the one everybody in MN goes for first. A good summer ale, sweet, nice light smell. A bit thicker than you'd expect, which is good. Goes well with large grinder sandwiches."
