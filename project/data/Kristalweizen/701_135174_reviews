"A nice wheat ale.  German yeast makes it a bit of a crossover between American Wheat Ale the Bavarian Style Hefe."
"Smells of tangy wheat and bubblegum mostly, some light spice as well perhaps. Very enticing. Tastes every bit as good as it smells. Sweet/tangy wheat dominates with enough bubblegum and banana to keep me thinking. As it warms, light, flowery spice and citrus emerge. God I love a good wheat beer. The only negative for was that the carbonation level seemed a bit low. Ramp it up and I would buy this by the case."

"I've got to say I'm really digging this. So well crafted and so drinkable. This would be great to session. I feared that having so many cooks in the kitchen might hurt this brew but my fears were unfounded. Delicious."
"Wonderful beer, all you could ask for from a wheat ale made with top quality pilsner malt, refreshing and satisfying.  4.0"
"Not exactly a flavor bomb, but ridiculously drinkable! Iâ€™ve only ever had one other Kristalweizen, and this one sends that other one fleeing home in shame. I could drink this all day long."
"I find the simplicity of this Hefeweizen very much to my liking. I'd drink more."
"3.75  3.5  3.75  3.5  3.75"
"Really a solid effort, and a worthy representative for Bellingham Beer Week.  I liked this one quite a bit."
"This could be the only domestic Krisalweizen I have had and it is world class!  Thank you @Beertunes for the chance to try this beer. I would drink this everyday."

"Poured  from a 16 oz. can into an Euler stange. Pours a light golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to patchy foam and thin ring around the glass, no lacing. Aroma is sweet wheat, a hint of citrus and an unexpected hint of caramel. Flavor is wheat, light biscuit malt with hints of caramel and toast, light lemon, interesting. Light to medium bodied with peppry carbonation. An interesting take on a weizen. My glass had a faint haze, but certainly not as cloudy as a hefeweizen, don't remember if this is typical of this filtered variety. Although all the weizen characteristic flavors are here, they seem to be melded with a biscuity malt, which is not something I've noticed in a weizen before. This kinda reminded me of a kolsch, albeit a mildely weaty and citrus one. Not quite to style, but I really liked the flavor here, the wheat/malt base is pleasant and more substantial than I expected. Nicely done. I would gladly get this again for a hot summer day."
"Big thanks to beertunes for sending this one down for me to try!"
