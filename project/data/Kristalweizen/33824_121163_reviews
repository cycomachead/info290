"The ratings here are as another example of how silly this user base is. This beer is absolutely perfect in what it is trying to accomplish"

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, fruit, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and really easy to drink."
