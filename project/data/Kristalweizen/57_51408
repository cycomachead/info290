4.09,21.7,4.25,4,4,4.25,4.25,"This is a proper beer. Not exactly "Mexican" but a very accurate representation of a great German style. I really didn't expect this to be so good and it makes me wonder how many good beers this brewery could produce if it had the market here in Mexico. This beer and Noche Buena are my favorite beers in Mexico. And the price (converted to about $1 a bottle in late Feb 2015 in Xalapa) makes it a go-to when I'm craving a well-crafted beer in a sea full of Tecate and Corona.","Gatch","Feb 01, 2015"

3.17,-5.7,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"O: This is actually definitely some steps up from a generic no-beer-ingredients-macro. However, I think the execution is a bit suspect. I really don't understand the flavor profile of this beer, and it really seems unnecessarily soapy. The mouth feel really isn't bad on this beer, but there seems to be an odd relationship between the duration of the flavors and the light drying body of the mouth. I want to like this beer, as it's really not so bad at all, but at the same time it wins me over in no category. It will just have to settle for simply "better than macro", but far too mediocre to be considered anything else.","Cavery","Jun 18, 2011"
