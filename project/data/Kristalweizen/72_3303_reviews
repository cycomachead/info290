"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Beautiful crystal clear straw yellow pour with a three finger foamy pure white head with decent retention and lacing. The nose is typical Weizen, but much more subtle. Hints of grass, yeast, wheat, straw, cloves, and just a touch of banana and bubblegum. The taste follows suit with lots of grass along with hints of clove, banana bread, wheat, yeast, lemon, and subtle bubblegum. The mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp, subtly sweet, with a nice dry finish. Overall, a nice refreshing alternative to the normal Hefeweizen."

"Not a bad beer, naturally lighter than a hefeweizen but also very similar in most aspects with the same combination of banana, clove and citrus notes although none come across as strong they would in a hefeweizen."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"O: I like beers a lot and so like to try new ones, this isn’t one I would choose again, but really it is from a great company. The bottle is cool, I like their style. If you can’t stand the yeast floating in your beer, you could try this, but its not as good as Weihenstephaner’s Kristall."

"O- Not super complex, but drinkabilty is even better than in common hefes. Overall an highly enjoyable, easy beer"
""
"This however is definitely much better. As others have said, it's crisp and clean but still tastes great. The carbonation is bit much but overall this is still one of my favourite beers."

"Had a .5L bottle in Germany. It's crisp and clean, almost like a kolsch, or low bitterness pilsner. There's still a soft, bready aroma with a peppery, clove edge. There's a hint of banana mixed in too, and as you might expect, this tastes like a cleaned up Schneider hefe. A slightly sweet, bready malt flavor rolls over the tongue, but there's a drier finish. This beer seems a little more crisp and refreshing. I'd prefer Schneider Original, but this was a pleasant change of pace while traveling."

"O - Lovely and crisp with pure, clean flavours. A great example of the style."
""
"O: I was blown away by my first bottle but I drank it when I was parched, so I was overly astute. The few I've had since have not been very tasty. Definitely better when thoroughly chilled and left out of the fridge for 10 mins. A very refreshing beer if you've had a busy day in the sun."

"O - As this beers warms it becomes remarkably more peach flavoured. At first this was scarcely detectable but as I consume more it's becoming much more obvious in both taste and aroma. The sweetness could be slightly overpowering for some but otherwise this is a very interesting example of this style of beer."
"A really, really good kristalweizen. I'm not sure I've had a better one; one with more flavour and character, or so well constructed all up. Schneider do do an excellent range of wheat beers, and with this they show what can be done with a style that is often neglected."
"Taste is very fresh. The wheat is light and has some grainy notes. The yeast is most dominant in the beer, giving banana, lemon and some pine-apple. The mouthfeel is smooth. Aftertaste is light and crisp."
"Moderate carbonation, but body quite light... slips away fairly quickly... gives the impression of a creaming soda or similar. I'm not overly impressed with this."
"A bubbly pale body with a fluffy white head that settles down in short order. Nose is sweet and malty. Not much hops noticable. Schneider Weisse Kristall sports a clean, sweet taste with a familiar wheaty aftertaste. The beer is pretty heavily carbonated and I think this hinders drinkability a bit. Mouthfeel is similar to champagne carbonation, but with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. A good warm weather beer, but not fantastic."
"Bottle. This one surprised me. I was expecting it to be inferior in all ways to the hefe version. Significantly lighter than the hefe version, crystal clear light gold with plenty of efferescence as expected, and a big white head that I had trouble controlling on the pour. Aroma was true to style, very much like its hefe brother. I was expecting a somewhat muted taste, but was very surprised as it was full of flavour, cleaner but less complex than the ""mit hefe"". Felt a bit lighter in the mouth, but I guess that is to be expected. Very nice Krystal! Would be a good way to introduce the style to those unable to cope with cloudiness. I really need to try this one again alongside its hefe brother."
"Poured a clear and very bubbly gold under a 1.5 finger white head with some body and good staying power. I didn't see much lace, though. The nose was strong with yeast and spice. The mouth was very prickly and light. There's a slight tart citrus flavor accompanied by some coriander on top of a good wheat and yeast base. The yeast and spice linger longest into the aftertaste. No appreciable hops, but they really aren't needed. I found this brew surprisingly yeasty for a Kristall, but pretty darn good nonetheless."
"Overall: I rate this beer well because it is so dynamic. This is the beer you serve at a classy party after the main coarse to finish a good meal."
"I often never understood the kristall wheat style, but this is an exception, more to it than most german kristall wheats, hints of honey, apricot and banana, the best kristall wheat i've tried."
