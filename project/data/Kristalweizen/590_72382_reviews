"My first of this style. Got from a trade. Pours a deep orange red with large creamy head that has just a hint of orange color to it. Aroma is strong pears, wheat, funky yeast, banana, more sweet pears. Very nice. Light mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Tastes like biting into a fresh pear. Hints of cinnamon that do not overpower, but supplement the beer very nicely. Not overly sweet at all and is quite refreshing. Nicely balanced brew that one could drink all night. This is really fantastic."

"Really refreshing and drinkable, perfect pair for this sticky muggy summer night."

"O: A nice beer. My first true Kristalweizen. Nice flavors all around. Well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect. Sublime. I could drink this all day, every day. When this was out (this is my last bottle), I bought it EVERY time I got a chance. This redefines Kristalweizens for me. NOW I love them as much (or more) than a hefeweizen."

"D - This is the first beer I've had in the style. A departure from your typical wheat offering, but definitely worth a go. I'd have it again."
""
"Great easy drinkin' wheat beer with terrific flavor. Well done New Glarus!"
""
""
""
"O- Another solid offering from New Glarus. I'm still of the opinion that they do not make a bad beer. If you want all the flavors of a great hefeweizen with a lighter body, seek this out."
""
"O - really attractive beer, pleasant aroma and easily drinkable. havent had many Kristalweizen's prior to this, but enjoy the style, have always been a Hefeweizen fan. the carbonation is spot on, and this is an emjoyable beer. i see this as a good beer for late spring time."
""
""
""
""
"O: like most brews of new glarus, this is well crafted and one you should try. This stands up to any imported kristal weizen. Prost."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid take on the style. A good mix of wheat, spice, and fruity esters."

"The beer pours a deep copper-golden color with big head of off-white head that clings to the glass. Darker then expected, but intriguing none the less. Malty sweetness comes out strong but settles as other aromas including wheat, spice, banana, clove, and a touch of cinnamon join the party. The pallet experiences many of the typical hefeweizen flavors of banana, wheat, clove, and lemon zest while new flavors of cinnamon and biscuity malt dance underneath. Spot on mouthfeel for the style; medium bodied and highly carbonated. Another New Glarus brew, another rave review - not just a coincidence."
""
"Overall I am real impressed with this one unique brew, and a great play on a classic old school German style that is American crafty. I'd drink this often in the summer if I could."
""
""
"A nice easy to drink beer. Really goes down easy, and has the taste I expect from this style. Wheat beers are one of my favorites, and this is a nice example of the style."
""
"fine representation of a hefe style beer. aroma and taste remind me of banana bread with cinnamon streusel topping. great malt profile, and taste is off the charts in the fresh grain and malt category. i cant see how they could improve on this one very much. i would definitely buy it again."
""
""
"I don't have much experience with the style but this has to be one of the best representations out there. It's definitely the best I've had."
""
"A-"
""
""
""
"O: A great, easy drinking beer with some good fruit and Belgian notes."
"12oz bottle: This one pours a crystal clear amber color. There was a good sized light beige head on it. It didn’t linger long, but did leave some lacing. It has an interesting nose. There is a slight sourness to it. Get some apples in there, along with some faint banana. Faint hints of clove and cinnamon. Also a touch of wheat. The taste is very good. A hint of sourness to it. Wheat, some of the clove and cinnamon, faint apple and banana. An excellent beer!"
""
""
"Not your typical kristalweizen, but immensely enjoyable and another great offering from what is rapidly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"o - Overall a pretty nice beer. Loads of bananas and bread, especially in the taste. Also a good amount of fruit and apples to it, and easy to drink. Would like to have it again."
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured out much darker than I expected. The color of this beer was a nice looking amber color with a fluffy white head on top. The retention is moderate and not much lacing at all. The smell of the beer is much like a traditional Weizen brew, there is an additional caramel sweetness in there too. The taste has the typical banana and clove upfront with a very nice sweet malt finish. Very nice flavor on this beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, decent carbonation, light bodied, drinkable. Overall I was impressed with this beer. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did."
"For a mild easy drinker, this is a great beer. Smooth, but plenty of personality here."
""
""
""
"O-A solid brew although not as prefered as some other unfiltered versions. I think I'd rather drink the unfiltered versions that have a little more creaminess and stronger clove notes."
""
"O - Definitely an afternoon/evening beer, and great for a fall picnic or campfire. My first Kristalweizen, so I wasn't expecting the slight ""cleaning solution"" flavor of the phenols, but somehow it manages to be pleasant."
"O - Great looking beer. Smells show a good depth of complexity. Flavor is huge on wheat and hefe-like. Carbonation works well and has perfect feel. Another great beer by New Glarus."
"Overall this is a cut above most american wheat beers. New Glarus makes the best beers in the U.S.A. When will they sell in Chicago???"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A departure from my usual, and I found it enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall: Dan and Deb give a nice twist on a classic Bavarian-style ""kristall"" wheat beer. Big props for the darker-than-usual color, and although it has all the required components of a classic German wheat beer, I don't think I'm lying when I say that there is some (at least a hint) of smoke/rauch in this too. Very good indeed!"
""
""
""
"O - I really liked this offering from NG, definitely not just a filtered version of Dancing Man, a unique beer of its own and one I could definitely throw back a few of."

"What exactly about this beer makes it a kristalweizen? Is this from the same brewery that makes Dancing Man? Why not make that into a kristal? What is this thing? I had assumed it was another boring amber until someone told me it as a kristal and then I sort of went crazy railing against the beer. I know it is open to interpretation but seriously? It is RED, it is uncarbonated, the yeast and the wheat don't come through, there is nearly nothing about this beer that tells me that it is a kristal."
"Pours a medium golden-copper color. Not sure how a Kristalweizen ends up this way, but it's far, far too dark. Short white head. The nose carries some light yeasty notes plus a bit of grain. Not too much going on. The flavor is is similar, with a bit too much bready malt coming through. Body is medium and a bit heavy."
"The beer is dark golden colored with a lasting white head. Too dark for the style. The aroma is similar to a dunkel weizen, with wheat and some dark fruit presence. A bit sweet and malty. I would prefer a lighter color and body, with less malt presence. Not what I look for in a beer of this style. Overall, this was just ok."
"M: Very juicy with great mouth coating. Tingly carbonation and pleasant aftertaste."
"Fun, different than average fall/winter beer."
"Might need another sample of this one. Seems out of character for NG."
""
""
"Overall this is a good, solid beer that seems like it was designed for cool nights around the campfire, with a s'more dangling over the coals. Very nice, sessionable beer."

"I really do understand why people like wheat beers, but they're just not my cup of tea especially the German style examples that feature the estery yeast notes."
""
"The aroma of this brew is appetizing with notes of clove and banana bread. Some fresh fruity notes are deposited on the palate as the lively copper-hued brew moves through the mouth. The flavors are nice and fresh with orchard fruit and spice. It's earthy and refreshing at the same time. Another nice beer from the folks at New Glarus."
"Poured into a tall weizen glass. This beer pours with a massive amount of foam, which dissipates to leave a thick beige head capping off a clear dark amber beer. This is darker than I had anticipated, but it's a good color to go with the 'Fox' moniker. Sweet aromas stand out. Banana, clove, sugar cookies. Mellow feel. Carbonation is low-to-moderate. Sweet banana bread, mild caramel, clove, bready finish. This was an easy drinker. Sweet beer that was refreshing and uplifting. Not a go-to for me, but a pleasant beer anyways."
""
""
"Overall, for the style this is an outstanding beer. Despite the appearance the flavor is that of a very traditional hefeweizen. I thought the filering would change the flavor but this still has the flavor of a traditional German hefeweizen. A very good beer for the style."
"O - a really nice surprise of a beer.. never really had anything like it before so i'm very partial to it. great flavors, great looking/smelling. no complaints in any department."
""
"Toasted grains with a hint of nuttiness up front. Banana and bread dough flavors follow, framed by hints of clove, bubblegum, and peppery hops. Yeasty, doughy finish, with lingering banana. Medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy feel. Another great wheat beer from New Glarus."

"O- like a hefe this is delicious very session able, a great brew from NG"
"Overall - Light and refreshing with a nice, non-insipid flavor."
"Smallish head, with no sediment. Definitely a little too carbonated for my taste - the mouthfeel was a little too creamy, masking the flavor. I was hoping for something a little bit bolder in flavor - there's a little bit of clove spice going on, but no banana or cinnamon. As it warms up a little and de-gasses, it's more enjoyable. Nice beer."
""
""
""
"O - The empty glass, showing the fox's quick departure, is coated with lace and leaves a nice flavor lingering on my palate. Laughing Fox, like all other wheat beers from New Glarus, is outstanding; just world class! Surprisingly toasty, cunningly balanced, and delicious all around, it's a great seasonal with plenty of character!"
"Super session ale right here."
""
"Overall this is a good beer that grows on me. Seems a little dark for the style. Definitely a beer I could have a few of"
"Thanks to Crass3000 for this one!"
""
"O - Overall a fine brew. A nice example of banana esters developed purely from yeast, paired with fulfilling bread and a bit of spicy clove. Yum!"
"O -- A very well made take on a seldom seen style. Has all the characteristics you'd expect in a Bavarian Hefeweizen without the cloudy yeast."
""
"O: Clean, slick and smooth flavor that goes down easy. Nothing super special about this one, but there’s nothing wrong with it either."
""
"vigorous pale golden yellow with a huge head of fizzy white lace, took several pours before the entire bottle could be released in a very tall glass. Lots of carbonation was apparent from the start through the absolutely flawless crystal clear nature of it. No sediment and no haze at all. Head settled down to just a thin film and that lasted throughout, but leaving copious side lace. Smell was very light, almost non existent at first but then some nice grain aromas broke though with a touch of yeast to add. Light flavor as well, just a nice light wheat flavor is really all that can be said about it. Mouth feel was again very light with ample carbonation it went down like water. Huge session ale here, this had all the earmarks of a hot summer day in the backyard brew."
""

""
""
""
""
"This is the final bottle in the 6-pack. The other five made no impression on me, really, and at this last one, I feel I won't be missing it. New Glarus continues to be a brewery that misses almost as much as hits with me. But the hits deserve their accolades, don't get me wrong. This one? Eh."
""
"overall I'm really not sure how to rate this - at first, from the appearance and smell, I had high-hopes, but the taste was so subtle and almost bland for me that I'm not really a fan at first tasting."
"I'm not a huge fan of most wheat beers, but I always come in with an open mind. This is a very clean, very drinkable beer. Solid, if not particularly memorable."
""
""
"O-my wife picked this up for me and when I saw it was sort of filtered hefewiezen I wasn't sure I would like it since I don't care for most hefeweizen, but I was suprised to find it was better than I was expecting"
"I love a good take on a more traditional style and New Glarus usually pulls it off better than anyone and this is no exception. Very good beer."
""
""
""
"Pours an amber orange color with a fluffy white head. Scent is full of wheats with a slight bitter scent mixed with bananas. The taste has a similar taste that reminds me of biting into an apple. I know there is a lot of wheat to this beer but I'm getting more apple tasting hints. This is a smooth, tasty brew that is a great drink for the fall harvest weather."
""
""
"O: A good beer. Nothing special. Light, tasty, sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't say that I've had many examples of this style but I certainly can say that I enjoy this example!"
""
"O: A refreshing, very light brew. A good quaffer, with some complexity."
""
""
"D - solid wheat beer. Packed with lots of flavor in all of the right places with a nice look and aroma as well. Too bad I only have one bottle of this as I would love to drink some more of this."
"Drinkability- Not bad but the smell is much better than the taste. I feel like it’s sort of boring. Almost like it’s washed out – one flavor needs to shine a bit more than the other but neither does. Glad I tried but not my favorite."
"When I think of Fall, wheat beers like kristalweizens don’t tend to come to mind, but the combination of 50% Wisconsin red wheat seems to work here and gives this beer a little heartier feel in both taste, and certainly appearance to match the cooler weather. Impressive Autumn release!"
"O- A good beer, but I think it falls short for New Glarus. If you're a big wheat beer fan certainly pick it up. Otherwise it's still good, just not a ""must try""."
"Bottle from Reilly's in Madison. Pours a gigantic white head on light orange body. Retained one-half inch of head. Spicy, slightly yeasty aroma. Mouthfeel is a tad above average. Taste is spicy and catchy, a little yeasty. Nothing like I expected, it was most drinkable. Got good cinammon."
"(D)- Overall, yet another tasty beer from New Glarus with their typical subtle twists on a traditional style."
"O: this is a well balanced and flavorful weizen beer. This is my first Kristalweizen so I don't really have a point of reference. I imagine its not much different from a hefe or dunkelweizen, just somewhere in between with the color"
"Laughing Fox pours a deeper golden color, with a big lacing white head. The smell is full of spices, and has a nice sweet note. The taste has a very full spice and belgin candy flavor. Very crisp and very full. Nice carbonation, very clean crisp flavor. Overall I had no clue what to expect from this beer. It is like a strong belgin whit beir, but much crisper, and stronger sugar notes. Overall a pretty good beer."
"A very interesting, well-rounded beer. Have not had many examples of this style but by acting as a unique and well-balanced beer, this beer seems to paint a picture of the style should be."
"Overall a very solid brew."
"I'm not very experienced with the style, but I really enjoyed this. A pretty delicious German-style beer from a brewery I love,I'd certainly stock up on this if I could."
"3.5, 3, 3, 4, 3"
"An all around great beer, New Glarus wielding local wheat with this one. They just raised and alterer the bar for the Kristalweizen style."
"D/O: This amber-weizen beer smells convincing enough, yet never really is able to build much momentum in its flavor profile. Certain features stand out, such as the slight savory roast at the end, but no part really wows. It could be a really worthy beer for cooking, and its sessionable nature means that it is easy on the palate, if not particularly compelling."
"Tastes a bit more substantial. The same cinnamon flavor of Spotted Cow, only applied to peppery wheat malt. Nice, crisp, and warm, but nothing too fancy or adventurous. Also a bit too fizzy, and that cuts into the flavor a tad."
"D - Very drinkable.Very refreshing, An outstanding version of the style."
"Overall: New had a Kristalweizen beer, but I trust that new glarus did this beer style the right way. Enjoyable beer."
"Easy drinking beer. Would not mind having this year round."
"Pours a beautiful bright orange with a thick three finger head, lots of exuberant carbonation, translucent body, modest head retention and lacing. Estery, strong dark fruit berry like aromas, ethyl acetate, subtle giner, spicy, mild caramel. Tastes as it smells, grainy backbone more pronounced, lots of fruity berry and banana esters, spicy, a bit tart and piquant in the finish. Good body, a bit cloying and alkaline."
"I'm impressed."
"What a beer to enjoy on a mild sunday evening. A nice creamy head delivers in a medium-bodied and well carbonated avalanche of tamed wheat, clove, cinnamon, banana, corn and a tad of aged cheddar cheese. Really cant get enough of these great new glarus brews. This brewery is really showing that it can be calculated, balanced and masterful in its measurements in addition to creative, artistic and extreme. Absolutely recommend this!"
"Bottle. Poured into a Duvel glass a clear, dark copper color with a very large 3 finger foamy, frothy white head. Very fruit, belgian yeast aroma in the nose with bubblegum, banana, pear, and clove. Medium mouthfeel with lively carbonation. Sweet fruity upfront flavors with a more than expected bitterness popping in. Caramel notes as well. End dryly with a linger bubblegum and bitter aftertaste. Laces the glass."
"O) This is pretty darn good. I had a few folks compare this to Dancing Man Wheat. This is not as good, but if Dancing Man isn't available, this would be an acceptable plan B."
"A very drinkable beer with lots of flavor. I could see myself drinking several of these easily and doing so nearly year round except for the bitter cold winter months. Another solid beer by NG."
"Clear copper colored body. Nice beige head. Leaves some nice lace. Very nice aroma. Weizen yeast properties like banana and clove come through nicely. A little cinnamon too. Mouthfeel is just a titch gaseous. Nothing too serious though. Light in body. Flavor is decent. The clove adn cinnamon come out in the flavor slightly as well. Bready malt base with some yeast notes as well. Good beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and will recommend. I’m enjoying the 6-pack I picked up even though this is octoberfest season."
"i might not be the most well versed in this style, but I have had enough hefeweizen to know that this guy is delicious. once again new glarus has shown that they are the US king of classic german styles."
" ~ As I mentioned above, this is a beer that I would certainly sit down and session. I recommend any beer fans give this a sampling."
"O - I could drink a lot of this beer (and considering the strength, can't say I'd regret it), not way out there but very clean and fairly well balanced, perfect summer session beer, don't know why they released this one just as fall was approaching"
"Overall I think it's a decent beer, pretty drinkable with fairly mild flavors. I think of it as an introduction to Dancing Man. It's not up to par with the other New Glarus wheat beers in terms of flavor and enjoyment but it's not disappointing either."
"Easy and enjoyable to drink. Another good offering from New Glarus, although not in my top 10."
"O - light is the name of the game. It's a masterpiece of lightness (not thinking of calories). Great beer."
"O: Overall this is a very well rounded brew, a nice welcoming beer, with a substantial body, while holding a very nice weizen presence. Very nicely done, will be returning to this one many times."
"I'll have to try this and Dancing Man back to back to decide which I prefer but the fact that it's even close says volumes about this beer. The lower ABV gives it a boost for me, Dancing Man's slightly punchier flavor is in it's favor. Absolutely wonderful - I wonder if there's any chance that they'll do this one year round."
"O- meh, I like New Glarus, but not a fan of this beer, bought a 6 pack hopefully, I can do some trading in my homebrew club for it."
"Pours a clear yellowish orange. A bit of light head. Smells wheaty and yeasty. Smells very sweet. Tastes sweet and yeasty. Love the taste and aroma! Clean and very enjoyable. Good mouthfeel. Overall quite enjoyable. Thanks LeAnn for bringing this one!"
"O-nice beer that I didn't expect to like. Would have again"
"This was nice and light and balanced. Nothing extreme about it, just nicely balanced and well done. I'd like to show this to some bud light drinkers."
"Thanks orbitalr0x for the bottle!"
"Pours a clearcopper body with a fluffy tan head. It smells full of spices like cloves and cinnamon. The taste follows the aroma. A little sweet and bready. An easy drinking beer and one I could have a few of on a nice summer day in Florida. Thanks to JoePeesie for the sample"
"This is a great beer in my book. Unique taste and real easy drinking. Although I would rather have the older brother Unplugged Imperial Weizen since it has more of a warming sensation and high alcohol content. This beer is perfect for those who want to taste something new with a couple friends."
"Yeah, this is really good, it's got a clean, buoyant, natural vibe that just screams ""All Right in the World"" as you sip on it."
"All in all, this beer is an awesome release from New Glarus. I highly recommend picking this one up, because if there is one thing New Glarus does exceptionally well (besides their fruit beers) is their wheat beers. I just wish they would not have ceased production of Crack'd Wheat."
"D/O- Highly drinkable beer but not enough flavor to drop everything and seek-out. Refreshing and quite-enjoyed a lot. Not well-versed on this style so take these ratings with a grain of salt."
"Not super duper true to style, but for the style it isn't bad."
"VERY REFRESHING, PICK THIS UP!"
"Overall Who ever described this as a Dancing Man light was right on. A lower abv beer packed full of flavor."
"I keep getting a very distinct aroma of fresh cut green apple slices hovering under the heavy blanket of clove/cinnamon spiced weizen wheat-bready goodness. Also noted, this one is not nearly as heavy on the banana notes in the nose as New Glarus's other weizens typically are. Taste is solidly wheatey and medium-low in yeastiness but really, that is plenty enough to compliment the delicate dry mead and apple tones I keep picking up here and there. In some beers, I understand apple flavors and scents are considered to be an off-flavor, but it fits so well in this brew that I cannot imagine it wasn't done on purpose. Finish is not particularly long per se, but it is enjoyably dry while it lasts. Light in body, really easy to session at 4.5% ABV, but one should take the time to appreciate the tiny subtleties held within."
"Light bodied, slowly effervescent. A Dancing Man Light. A nice quaffer that still rings with the hallmarks of New Glarus' excellent Weizen heritage."
"Poured into a snifter, this beer pours brilliantly clear copper with a thick, ample off-white, beautiful! The nose is dominated by bountiful spice and clove yeast character with some sweet malt in the background. The flavor is like the nose, but much more subdued. The yeast character is subdued, yet still noticeable, with some bready, sweet malt in the background. The beer finishes pleasantly dry. Given the wonderfully strong nose I expected more body/mouthfeel, it doesn't need to be chewy, but it just misses as too thin, and this even with a medium-high carbonation. Overall a beautiful, great smelling beer, while the flavor is a bit too subdued and mouthfeel a bit thin, it is a highly drinkable refreshing beer."
"D - A solid beer that would make a nice summer thirst quencher."
"O- It's hard to knock this beer but it doesn't measure up compared to some of Dan's other wheats. With that said, this would be a decent substitution for anyone looking for Dancing Man with a lower alcohol content(but who would want that?)."
