2.64,-17,4,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"I wasn't really sure if this was a Hefe or Kristall, but as it turns out, I bought this and the Hefe without even knowing it. Poured from a capped green bottle a vibrant golden color, with just a tinge of murk, and a decent sized white head. Smell is a bit strange in that it has a sort of husky grain/skunked character that reminds me of a macro lager like Heineken. It isn't exactly unappealing, in fact it gets better as it warms, but it really doesn't smell like any other example of this style I have encountered. Taste is lively with carbonation, with a sickly sweet taste accompanied by a mild skunked flavor. Traces of banana and wheat are there, but very much masked by the off flavors that are present. Body is an improvement, with a good dosage of carbonation, and a light refreshing crispness. I have to say that it was difficult to finish this bottle. I toyed with dumping it, but decided to let it unfold a bit more. It took on some of the characteristics that the Hefe did, but ended up falling short in comparison. A strange beer IMO, not completely a waste, but Im not gonna recommend it. Cheers","jamie2dope","Oct 29, 2007"

3.48,9.4,4,3.5,3,4,4,"The brew tastes quite light: a little lemony and it has a bitter finish. There is not a whole lot of sustenance here, but is quite refreshing.","TheSarge","Jun 21, 2006"
2.39,-24.8,3.5,2,2,3,3,"This was my first taste of a Kristall Weizen, and it's possible that I just don't enjoy the style, however as a big fan of Hefe Weizen I will not accept this after trying only one example of the style.","HugoGrim","Dec 30, 2005"
3.28,3.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"Quite drinkable and thirst quenching, though lacks the real punch of a true wheat beer.","shertzogovina","Beers"
3.33,4.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This beer pours a light copper color with a thin white head. Smells like a pilsner with a touch of wheat and some sour honey. Tastes like a crisp pilsner with a touch of smoky skunkiness. There is only a hint of wheat detected as well. Finishes dry. The mouth feel is light with a medium carbonation. Im not impressed. Tastes like a Deutsch attempt at an American macro lager, but the bottle says kristall weizen. I suppose every German beer cant be amazing.","DarkerTheBetter","0"
