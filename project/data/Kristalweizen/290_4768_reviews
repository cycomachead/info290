"The taste was a letdown."

"Food match: Kristals tend to be a lighter palate Weizen, with this one there is a Lager grass note thrown into the mix so the food match has a bit more scope. I would see this working well with light BBQ fare more than anything else; grilled steak/sausage, coleslaw and potato salad."
"O-Decent. Classic German pilsener."

"Poured a 500ml bottle into an Imperial Pint glass (it's all I've got that fits the bottle). Pours a moderate gold with a big creamy white head that lingers on and left some lacing. This might be entirely due to my chosen glassware. Aroma is nice, but somewhat underwhelming, with notes of fruity esters, a slight whiff of banana and a little spice. The taste is about the same. It has a nice mouthfeel, not to thin or thick and just a little tickle of carbonation. A solid, well-above-average weizen."

"I liked the fact that this beer has in average a higher drinkability than other Weiss given it is a bit less sweet and you can better feel its bitterness and malts. Light beer for a summer day and to get some rest from traditional Weiss biers."
""
"Overall: I think a bottle or two would go down quite well on a very hot day, but it is still not a beer I would buy again."

"Overall, a pretty good beer but nothing stand-out. I'd say about average in the style if I had to guess."

"One of my all time favorite beers."
"Dr: It does hide its ABV well, and you could down a pint easily as it's not overcarbonated, but you wouldn't want to unless your only alternatives were American macro shitebeer (can we go ahead and make this a style on beeradvocate?)."
"Looked and smelled good, but a little lacking in the flavor and body departments. Poured with a nice, large, white, thick, foamy, frothy head and some lace. Color is a clear yellow. Aroma is standard Bavarian weiss- malt, bananas, spices, bit of lemon. Flavor is where it gets a little shallow and has a bit of a metallic component. Body is good and carbonatioin is ok. Finish is like favor. Nothing too special here."
"It's a light and drinkable beer. Forgive it its sweetness, and it's mellow, very smooth and easy to imbibe."
"Limited time offer at the PX in Korea. I don't recall ever getting that much head out of a bottle of beer. Slightly fruity and sweet. Very drinkable kristal. Drank out of a pint weizen glass and although I poured carefully started off with about 4"" of light foam. It dissipated quickly and did not attach to glassware. Would recommend."
"I remember really enjoying this in the past, but I think it's because it gives vaguely pleasant wheat flavours, without the spicy and tart potency of the hefeweizen. It's a weaker, more ""accessible"" beer maybe, drinkable but not impressive."
"Overall, it is good, but somewhat seemed too mild and lacking flavour in the beginning, but I started to enjoy it much more towards the end of the glass."
"I didn't buy this beer in the good 'ol U.S. of A. Instead, a good fried of mine picked this up for me while they were in Germany. Am I glad he did? Yeah, I really am. This was an easy drinking crispy session Weizen."
"Drinkability- Very pleasant to drink but lacking in complexity and any depth."
"If this were an Australian wheat beer, I would be saying that it isn't a bad effort. Fact is, this is a German wheat beer, and while kristalweizens tend to have less flavour than hefes, there is no real excuse for this beer being bland. No real flaws, it just doesn't excel or excite in any way."
"It has a straw yellow colored body with lots of creamy white head. The aroma is sweeter than the hefe and not as spicy. The taste is not as banana and or orange like but is equally as fruity with different fruit esters that were hard for me to put my finger on. Maybe more lemon than orange in flavor. There is still a little bit of clove tones. It is on the heavy end of being light bodied with smooth carbonation. It a refreshing beer for a day of bahnhof hopping."
"Sometimes heffeweizen's can become too much banana flavor for me, so this is a nice, lighter alternative. A great full-flavored light beer!"
"Pours a blonde colour with light head which laces the glass. Smells very fruity, wheaty and sweet with a hint of banana. Very crisp clean taste with a mild banana/yeast flavour. Mouthfeel is fizzy and makes the tongue come alive! Very drinkable. Nice drop!"
"drinkability is decently refreshing, but lacking character. this brew leaves a bit to be desired, and the lemon it was served with did not help the situation at all."
"I like it and highly recommend it. Can't beat this for the price!"
"Pours a light golden color with a decent amount of foamy white head that laces the glass. Smells of wheat malt and sweet yeast, with a faint hint of banana. Tastes clean and sweet with some banana and yeast flavors there. Mouthfeel is fizzy with lots of tingling on the tongue, just like a weizen should be. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer, and a very nice kristallweizen."
"Drinkable enough but for the same price the regular hefe has a lot more character. I guess thats not really all that suprising though."
"having this beer again.)"

"I'm tasting this in parallel with Weihenstephan and Erdinger (hefe). The toasty nose is the real difference here... not sure how that aligns with style. It's still a nice drop."
"I had this in winter and look forward to trying it on a hot summers evening when it is likely to excell"
"This beer is made in the state of Hesse, and it makes a great wheat beer. It is the national group of Binding in Frankfurt. The orignial brewery site was the home of Peter Schoffer, a pioneering printer from the same deal as Gutenberg. This is very dry with a plummy, damsonlike fruitiness and a suggestion of grapefruit zest in the finish. It is widely available in Germany and can be drunk at any time of the day (trust me). It is not quite as good in the bottle as it is on tap, but really very good. If you like wheat beers, it truly doesn't get any better. (or rarely better)."
"Drinkability/Overall: A very nice refreshing brew. Again this brewery seems to produce classic brews for their style. This brew and its brewerys Weizen line is a great starter for anyone curious to the style."
"Drinkability: The metallic aftertaste kills the chance of me trying this beer again."
"Unusual, but not overpowering, banana notes, stone fruit - perhaps apricot, vanilla, wheat. Easy supping. Tastes a little watery, a little acidic and the banana comes thru tho' not again not overpowering. Much like other mid quality kristallwiesens. Mouthfeel is good, quite carbonated. Nice on a hot day, and a slice of lemons tones down the 'nanas and gives it more bite."
"overall, this is pretty darn good. just lacks the punch of the hefe."
"Kristall golden colour with a tall rocky white head. Pleasantly subdued banana aroma and crisp, clean wheat flavour with some slight fruitiness. If I had to describe this beer in one word I would use is 'boring'. It has all the good characteristics of a weizen, but nothing really makes too much of an impression. A good, well balanced, easy to drink beer. Probably a good beer with your morning bratwurst haha."
"The beer started a bit above average with a clear straw color and a creamy white head.  The head took off about half way through the glass and left no trace of existence with lace or even a couple of bubbles.  It has kind of a week fruity fragrance that I almost had to dig for.  The taste consisted of a slight fruit/citrus/bitter combination.  Although it is a rather crisp drinkable beer, my opinion is that it is somewhat average and I will stick with its companion the Schöfferhofer Hefeweizen."
"Pretty average i think, i usd to drink it a lot, but every time i have it, i like it less and less, very edgy watery character, with a bit of a yeasty wheat, and banana character."
"a nice beer, but nothing really stands out."
