"Overall: I actually prefer this version rather than the kristals from Germany, though I think that is due to my hatred of kristals to begin with. At least this one has some taste to it, but I do wish they would classify it as a pilsner or something. quite refreshing and not bad at AU$51 a case (2013)."

"O: Nice summertime beer as it is refrshing and goes down easy."
"This is nowhere near a Kristalweisen, more a euro-lager and really not too different to Pure(!). Not good. Methinks Cascade have dropped the standards over the years. Second Cascade tonight which has missed the mark - by a long way..."
"Not for me."
"Very watery body."
"Very clear light yellow (blond?). Heaps of bubbles in the glass; soft drink-like. Nose has some character, faintly spicy with some aromatics. A bit of a surprise in the mouthâ€¦.more herbally hoppy notes and spice, a little reminisce of a German hefe (but only just). Essentially light bodied but some credit must to the Cascade for the slight deviation from the norm."
"I think I was thrown by wheat beer being on the label. To me it is much more like a lager. I wish the weather was warmer and then I could down a lot of these."
"This is arguably the best value beer in the country. And better in the bottle than on draught."
"A good choice for a hot day and , as it is freely available it should be a more frequent choice"
"Pours a light straw color with some bubbly head that fades away fairly quickly. Smells a little yeasty, and slightly flowery. Tastes very clean, some sweetness, a little hoppy bitterness on the backend. The mouthfeel is very bubbly but not harsh,. Finishes a little sour, but not bad. All in all, it's a very nice blonde. I would definitely get it again, especially for a hot day."
"It is a very pale straw colour with a moderately lasting frothy head, good lacing. There is little aroma, although some hops detectable. The taste is of citrus hops, with a pleasant but subdued bitterness. Carbonation is well managed. I think of it as being quite a pleasant lager. A nice summer drink."
"Overall a good refreshing beer without a lot to it. No faults and a good balance. I would not classify it as a kristallweizen though, perhaps an american wheat."
"Drinkability/Overall: Had this on tap at cascade brewery and in a bottle. Both were nice experiences. Definitely not a genuine wheat beer. More like a larger cross wheat beer. Pretty average, but hits the spot on a hot day."
