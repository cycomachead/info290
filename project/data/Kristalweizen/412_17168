3.15,-2.5,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Got it in MExico, suprisingly, but it was a good news. This is the third Kapuziner I have tried, and althought they are not the best Hefe's they do their job enough to make me want to drink Weizen beers over lagers. The colour is a little lager, but that is why it is a Kristall Weizen. The aroma however is very Wheaty, and the foam is intersting, it has some issues to be handled.","nekronos","Apr 18, 2004"
2.92,-9.6,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Clear and amazing like a pilsner, with tiny bubles on a thin white head. Peppery wheaty aroma. Doughy wheaty pepper flavor. Simple. Light frizzy body. Some banana. Crystal Weizen are always boring, so no surprise that this does not excite. This is a great beer if on bargain sale but do not search for it.","Naerhu","Beers"
3.57,10.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a clear deep gold with lots of bubbles under a thick contoured two finger head with good retention but not much lace. The nose is spicey banana and clove, with lots of yeast. The mouth is light and prickly. The flavor is a nice combination of yeast, banana and clove. There's a bit of a hoppy bite in the finish, which complements the other flavors quite nicely. The aftertaste is sweet and spicey. This is a good if unspectacular version of the style.","Globetrotter","0"
