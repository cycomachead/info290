"O: So-so; not as good as the unfiltered Weissbier (itself hardly the champion of the style). Looks alright, however the aroma and flavour are a lacklustre blend of fruity yeast notes and subtle wheat. None of the bold fruitiness and spicy character that would be expected from a better weizen. Body is OK. Drinkable enough but equally forgettable. No need to hunt it down."

"This seems to be aptly named, as it has a crystal clear complexion, feel and light clean taste."

"Review following the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 15A). Bottle 50 cl - Batch L291107. AROMA: light wheat aroma with faint vanilla notes and a sweet background. no hops, diacetyl or DMS aromas present. APPEARANCE: gold color and translucid (kristall version). average white and moussy head with average retention. TASTE: grainy and bready flavours with faint wheat character. some vanilla notes and finishes sweet. very low bitterness. no DMS or diacetyl. PALATE: medium-low body with medium-low carbonation. OVERALL: a bulk filtered weizen that lacks the aromas and flavours of a standard weizen."

"Picked this up at the Oak Barrel in Hagerstown. Decent looking beer that lives up to the Kristall, pristine looking. Not much to offer to the nose but very tasty, not special but tasty and very smooth. Overall a pretty strong offering that I will gladly have again but not one I will be Jonesing for."

"Custardy yeast, wheat grain, lost citrus notes, and a mild banana-esque finish. Somewhat grassy with a spiciness, like white pepper, in the backend; mixing cream and burning carbonation, along the way. Not a whole lot going on. Tastes like a good base beer for a summer shandy."

"O - A decent beer in the Erdinger range but not one of the best. Drinkable, enjoyable but I find it somewhat uninteresting."
"Taste starts out with a sweet malt flavor with hints of banana fruitiness, a decent grassy like bitterness follows, carbonation is on the high side but helps lend a dry finish necessary for this beer."
""
"Quite a strange beer initially and started almost like a pale lager with light malts and very faint grassy hops before the kristalweizen in it started to shine through. Not a bad effort overall but there are certainly better, and more readily available, Erdinger beers out there to be had."

"Scent is sweet bready. Pours very pale ,slightly hazy, yellow with very full and thick white head. Head lasts well and laces the glass in fine drapery to the bottom! Taste is crisp, honey lemon and biscuits. Very fine carbonation, no bitterness at all! Highly enjoyable."

"Goes down so, so, so easy. Very drinkable. Smooth. No bitterness. Light beery flavor. One of my favorites for hot weather and grilled food."
"Overall, a decent wheat beer but far from the best I have had. Nice to pick up every once and a while for a change of pace."
""
""
"Pours a clear light gold with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, sugar, and slight fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and slight fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and somewhat medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is pretty lacking in traditional weizen aromas and flavors, even for the style."

"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into a tulip fluted glass, best by 07-2012. This pours a massive head, in fact the entire 18oz glass if nothing but head right now, as it dissipates it turns a clear pale light yellow color. The smells are of yeast esters, banana and wheat. The feel is mostly light. The taste is okay, its pretty light and refreshing, but light taste and no hop presence, not enough flavors for my usual preference. Perhaps this would be okay on a warm summer day."
"Not the best wheat beer I've tried, but not bad either. It is refreshing, and has enough flavor to keep me wanting more. A good summer beer."
""
"O- disappointed with this german offering. Don't care to try again."
""
""
"This is the weakest beer in Erdinger's portfolio. I wouldn't recommend it. Try Urweisse or the Dunkel, if you want something different. I may try this again, but only if on tap."

"Pours a clear bright gold body with a smallish white head that is held aloft for a long time by highly active carbonation that gives the whole beer a very lively appearance. Aromas and and taste are perfectly aligned: predominantly grainy (but nearly as ""wheaty"" as the average hefeweizen) with very gentle hops. Lightly sweet, but overall just not very interesting to dissect. Its strongest point is its texture, which starts off tingly before breaking into a creamier mass of bubbles."
"O - A good beer that is very refreshing for a summer afternoon."
"O: Not bad, but I prefer Weihenstephaner if I had to pick a Kristalweizen"
"Taste is light, crisp fruity grain, dough, apple, apple peel, hints of herb, lemon and mineral – all very light and ultimately mostly dominated by mineral, apple and hint of grassy citrus, with the finish being mostly mineral and apple. It has a nice, zesty feel, is light and crisp. Character is light and rather simple, but it’s very pleasant and drinkable, with enough body and character to keep it going."
"O - Highly drinkable Kristalweizen"
"Overall it seems okay to me but not something I'd want to have again."
"It’s a pretty good brew that still have some vitality and gusto even being filtered."
"Reminded me a lot of some Euro pale lagers I've had, & again with a character not unlike champagne. I miss the smooth creaminess of a traditional hefe, though this will do. Nothing too challenging about it, easy enough to drink, though I'm not sure I'd jump at the chance to try it again."
"Notes: Its very drinkable with good clean wheat beer flavor."
"Dr: Won't buy it again, won't have it again, won't speak of it again. A damned disappointment for Erdinger. Not bad tasting, just empty. It should be said that it hides its ABV well, however"
"An easy drinker to start the day off."
"Fairly persistant white head on a clear gold body. Not very unique. Smell is somewhat average, a little like corn. Taste is seet then butter with a hint of hops in the aftertaste. Fairly good mouthfeel and carbonation. Leaves a slight pasty feeling on the palate. Drinkable, with a medium body. Worth drinking."
"A good kristal, a style which is often overshadowed by its more favoured sister style, the Hefeweizen. This doesn't quite show it off to its full potential, but it's a clean, refreshing and drinkable beer nonetheless. Good stuff."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite refreshing, although it's not as thirst quenching as an unfiltered wheat beer."
"Pours a pale straw color with some honey highlights, very much like a macro. However it does have a beautiful rocky pure white head that takes its time settling into a cap leaving some spotty lacing. The aroma is pretty blah, sweet pale malt with a slight tin like note. The taste is sweet but fairly clean. Seems to have a corn or adjuct type flavor and sweetness but none of the gross aftertaste. Any of the yeasty goodness has been filtered out of this brew, perhaps a very light banana creme pie flavor but that is it. The weizen has a light but not watery body, fizzy carbonation which leads to a crisp feel. Sweet overall but not cloying. This is quite a refreshing beer but it is boring. Definitely needs some more of the yeast flavors to come through."
"All in all, quite disappointing to me."
"Overall: An easy and simple example of the style, but it tastes a bit too much of corn to seek out again."
"All in all - a bit tame, and a bit too sweet to be really thirst quenching."
"D: This is a solid beer with a nice fresh character. A good summer beer, but not something I'd go out of my way for again..."
"D: Smooth, refreshing. Would make a good summer afternoon drink, but not the best of the breed by far. It does go down quickly, though."
"D- Excellent drinkability. Very sessionable, slightly higher ABV but nothing overpowering."
"Definitely make sure to drink it warm, maybe even summer day warm, and enjoy the prickly carbonation."
"This beer is wet, no dryness with it at all, a great beer with high drinkability. There is some cereal like taste in the mid to late palate, no sweetness and some of the ester notes come through in the taste. I've had better krystalweiss and hefe beers but this one is a decent example and overall a good beer. The mouthfeel was good and medium to low bodied."
"Carbonation is way over the top. Very prickly."
"MF&D - Light body, crisp and easy to drink."
"D: Nice and refreshing as a wheat beer should be."
"This beer reminds me of macro light lagers, without any off flavors and with excellent head, lacing, and overall quality. Not to mention it isn't a lager. I was about to review it pretty low because it is so light, but actually I think this beer has its own place, and is intended to be exactly what it is. Overall I think it is refreshing, easy to drink, and looks good. Just don't expect what you normally expect from a wheat beer."
"Overall, I did not enjoy this beer too much."
"This beer is a bland version of a style that I usually love. Kind of disappointing really but good for pounding down in the warmer months."
"Once again I'm underwhelmed by the Kristall of a great Hefe brewer and left wondering why filter the yeast? Sure it's nice to have some variety in your lineup but it just seems like the backbone of the palate has been sapped away and all that's left is a floppy mess of weak and wobbly wheat beer."
"Nose has wheat and yeast on the nose but is otherwise lacking for the style. A bit of ripe banana exists but is well hidden and subtle and comes with a bit of cloaking malts. A perky carbonation continues. Some noble hops and wheat hide a lager like sense. Feel is more full bodied however giving the beer a decent feel and drink. Unexciting in the taste department, this beer is a bit of a wanderer. Think Weihenstephaner."
"Overall this is a pretty filtered and bland hefe, but I wouldn't mind it as a thirst quencher on a hot summer day."
"Conclusion: Solid, refreshing; my favorite of the Erdinger lineup"
"Wheat and malt flavors outduel the yeasty esters in this beer for the most part. Cloves are the foremost yeast derivative on my buds and has a bit more spiciness than some other versions. I like this one quite a bit, but not as much as the Weihenstephaner Kristalweissbier."
"music: Bern - Father 12"" - A. Me (Traum Schallplaten)"
"Sometimes, less is more. Take out the yeast of an Erdinger Hefeweizen, and this becomes a little more interesting."
"D: This beer is so pleasant to drink. Though I prefer unfiltered wheat styles, I look forward to buying a few of these for the hot Cali summer!"
"D: Very easily drinkable, even flow of CO2 and a smooth and thirst quenching satisfaction. Perfect summer brew"
"Drinkability: Easy drinking, goes down smooth. Nothing crazy here, but its a terrific replacement for bud light or whatever run of the mill football or sports beer there is. Good session, but there are betting ones out there for sure."
"Pours a clear yellow orange color with a large white head that leaves some soapy sticking. Soft but sparkling nose of lemon seltzer, citrus peel and smooth toasty wheat. Bright in flavor, toasted wheat with a larger than expected hop character throughout especially late palate. The aftertaste really hurts this beer for me, cidery sweet red apple notes moving into a machine type of funk. Very light in body with lots of lively carbonation, all and all a very drinkable beer."
"D: Could drink a lot of this, nice cleansing finish."
"D - I could drink it all day, but water is cheaper."
"A good refreshing wheat beer."
"(rated Jul 24, 2007)"
"Finish clean easy drinking. I really enjoyed drinking this beer."
"Clear, yellow color with great foamy head and good lacing - a good looking beer. Aroma was pretty faint, just a hint of citrus. Fairly thin body with some nice sweetness that gives way to a bit of bitterness before finishing fast and clean. Overall, a very drinkable if not terribly flavorful beer."
"This tastes like a German's take on a Bud Light with more wheat. Pours fizzy yellow with an oversized white head. Corn, wheat, sugar, and metal in the aroma. Wheat with very little bubblegum and clove flavors which quickly disappear for a lager-like finish."
"It is a very bright hay gold color with good lacing and a nice white head. It has a strong weizen aroma. The usual cloves banana, cloves and spices. The taste strongly resembles the smell except there are some citrus and floral esters from the hops. The mouthfeel is fizzy with a little burn and pretty light. It is to drink and a great anytime beer."
"Overall, I would prefer the Weihenstephaner version over this one, which is much softer on the palate. This one is still pretty good though"
"This is a near smooth and sweet tasting beer, very refreshing. It would be great to cool down with."
"This was a pleasant surprise. I was not expecting such a highly drinkable beer and I can honestly say that I prefer this one over both the Erdinger dunkelweizen and their hefe."
"Appearance poured a light golden straw color with a thick healthy head. Smell is like bread dough sweetened with light honey. Taste is lightly sweet and spicey with a hint of banana. Mouthfeel is light and creamy with good carbonation. This is one beer I would drink on a warm evening simply sipping and enjoying."
"D - An easy, but boring and expensive beer to kill a night with."
"Not bad..."
"A decent little beer that could be easily confused with a Pilsner with too many esters. The wheat malt makes for a full flavored beer with strong wheat sweetness and a fresh, raw grain flavor. Bready, peppery, and lemony from nose to finish. Hints of bubble-gum, bananna , and clove dance in the background, but never gain prominence. Light hopping allows the grain / bread flavors to become dominant. Lightly acidic and carbonic to the mouth with a clean, refreshing finish. A lingering grain flavor keeps me from giving this beer more of a nod."
"An easy-drinking thirst-quencher here. Balanced enough not to need lemon-wedges (as this is the style that Bavarians used to put it into, and some Americans think they need to do with HW's.)"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is good beer to drink for a long time especially if you're in the mood for something light that still has some substance to it."
"Side-by-side comparison with their hefeweizen... half-liter German bottle, unpasteurized with a near-expired freshness date. The beer is crystal-clear gold, with lots of carbonation and three fingers of white head that retains well and laces nicely. Lightly sweet in the nose, with fruits, bubblegum and hints of wheat. The flavor is very fruity, with bubblegum, bready malts, and some late grassy hops. It has a light, dry, not-quite-tingly body that leaves a short finish. Interesting - tastes decent but doesn't really remind me a whole lot of a kristall. As to the comparisons with the hefe, this one looks much better, but the other tastes more authentic. Neither are great, and they both garnered the same score (granted for different reasons), but the prices are low enough to consider sampling them."
"D = Very easy drinking and refreshing. Good drinkability, especially on a hot Summer day."
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and clean, but the carbonation is over the top. Pretty refreshing and drinkable."
"D- This was not bad; I have others from the brewery that was better. Would not turn it down, but would not go out and buy it again."
"Two fingers of dense white froth cap a dark golden body, very impressive. Hops, mild fruit and yeast confront the nose, but not enough. The taste is rather good--hopped with hints of bitterness. Well carbonated, this is refreshing and enjoyable--not a Wow! beer, but solid."
"drinkability is good, it's very quenching and disappears pretty quickly. overall, seems to be pretty spot on for a somewhat lackluster style."
"I might drink this beer after mowing my lawn on a really hot day, but that is about the only time."
"This is a disappointment. A real yawner from an otherwise very good brewery. In removing the yeast they've also removed all the rest of the character. Almost no aroma, very little flavor. Light head and very little lace. The body isn't too good either. Very sharp hard carbonation in the mouth. It's just beer. That's it and that's that."
"Drinks very easy, sort of a Teutonic version of an American Pale Wheat ( just kidding, I'm sure the Germans did it first!). Not challenging enough to session on but a few go down very easy on a coolish Colorado Summer's day"
"Poured into weizen glass a spritzy light straw yellow with a large blooming white head that settled very slowly,light aromas lightly clovey with hints of apple and toasted grain.Extremely easy going down a tad thin but not watery,mild flavors somewhat toasty and clovey with underlying fruitiness like apple and banana.A good after work beer on a hot day here in the Buffalo area today."
"D - Excellent. Really fruity, buttery, and thirst quenching. This was an excellent crossover beer for lager-lovers who fear anything dark or hoppy. My dad loved it and actually considered buying something similar for home consumption! I may be getting closer to converting him to good beer!"
"16.9 oz. bottle- color of pale bright yellow , with a nice frothy cream colored head - nose of yeast , nice lemon zest, some grass , bubble gum , and malts  taste of lemon , citric acid , malts grass , and yeast - body is a little raw , acidic , and with high carbonation  aftertaste of lemon , yeast , and bubblegum"
"I like the Erdinger Weissbier Kristallklar. I could see myself dinking this one again."
"Cheers!"
"D- perhaps a little too carbonated for me. a wonderful scent and sweet dry finish does make it a nice example of the style, but the carbonation in the end would put me off. I have had kristall weizens on tap in germany and never found them this carbonated"
"I won't drink this Kristalweiss again, but I'm still open to the style. I still love a good wheat beer."
"Poured from a 16.9oz bottle. Pours a clear (no yeast here) straw color with a massive head that settles down to a finger width leaving some nice lacing. Smell is malty with a slight hint of hops. Taste is like a true weizen with out the yeast. Some clove and banana flavors along with malty start that ends with a bit of hops. Mouth is good with a great level of carbination. A drinkable beer and good intro to the kristal weizen style."
"Drinkability: This was a solid beer, with certainly nothing objectionable in the taste department, but the high carbonation and my preference for taking my wheats ""hefe"" detract a bit. That said, this could be an excellent gateway beer for someone accustomed to drinking highly carbonated, crystal clear AML's."
"An enjoyable beer - but I'm a bigger fan of its beige cousin. I'm one who likes his dark rye and Pumpernickel breads and flavoursome, buttery beers - not just Wonder White and VB. Since this tends towards the latter, I've held back my praise somewhat."
"Drinkability: Really not bad; a great summer quaffer"
" This is slightly disappointing. I enjoy a good Hefe but this is not quite the real thing. Worth a try but I'll be sticking with the cloudy stuff from here on out."
"A clean pale yellow beer with plenty of cabonation bubbles. Has a huge (maybe too big, only had a shaker pint, might have better if I had a Weiss Glass) bright white head with good lace. There are pleasent sweet banana notes in the aroma with some spicey clove in the background. The flavor was quite bland only hints of banana and some spicey hops well after the swallow. I could see where this might be a thirst quenching lawnmower beer but that is the extent of it."
"Bring on warm summer evenings , where this will excell"
"This really seems more of an American style wheat beer than a weizen, as it lacks most of the flavors one associates with weissbier. The blandest German weizen I've ever had, in fact."
"Damn, I was expecting more from this beer. It's a good brew in all aspects, with the exception of the most important: Taste. Poured out to a nice golden color with medium high carbonation and medium lace notes around the glass. Not much of an aroma, but minor hints of grain and some sweetness. Taste was just... bland. It's missing character. Some citrus notes and hints of grain and grass, but just as i'm starting to get a feel for it, it's gone. Finished crisp and clean. Good drinkability, but the addition of solid flavors would really be a perk in this brews corner. I must imagine there are better Kristal Weizens out there. Still worth a try."
"But it's not a bad quaff on it's own so long as you aren't jonesin' for anything really wheaty."
"Bottle. I don't believe this, finally a kristall that I actually like better than its hefe stable-mate. Looks good on the pour, a clear light gold with a dense white head and plenty of life. On the nose while it is more attenuated in the phenols than you would expect from a hefe, there is plenty of ester (banana) there on top of a good malty foundation. The taste starts sweet and malty as expected, there is a very slight hint of the banana in the aroma, and it finishes with just the right amount of bitterness and a little toastiness. Although it is more subtle than you would expect from a hefe, this is more than made up for by the balance. The carbonation is much better than the hefe version as well, which improves the mouthfeel considerably. This is a very refreshing and well balanced beer."
"Pours a Cristal clear golden color, with great carbonation and moderate white head. Smell is distinctly crisp and hoppy. Taste is fine - slightly lemony, very lightly spicy. Nothing to complain about. A good beer, but I just don't get excited about it."
"A very easy to drink brew, that is good anytime. A good beer to convert swill drinkers with."
"Not bad, too filtered (although it is the style), goes down easy though, very drinkable and good on a hot day"
"Refreshing."
"500ml bottle pours a beautiful clear canary color with a huge, rocky, white head that sticks around forever before fading to ring and sheet lacing. Very impressive to view. Aroma is, well, hmmm. If there is an aroma, it's faint hints of grass and pale malts. Mouthfeel is average, being light bodied and very carbonated. Taste is puzzling. Basically, there is none to speak of, other than faint lemony citrus, wheat, and something metallic. It's very refreshing, for sure, and is easily drinkable with no offnotes. Very disappointing considering how impressive it looks in the glass. I could easily guzzle a few of these, if I were thirsty, but I could satisy my thirst a lot cheaper with Miller Lite or water."
"Appearance: Crystal clear filtered hefeweizen, golden in color with a frothy billowing white head lace is spread evenly in webbed patterns, nice. Aroma: Some banana and clove scents survive the filtration sharp malted wheat sharp sweetness not bad seems spritzy and really carbonated. Taste: Hints of the banana and clove with a spritzy wheat base flavors blend well together but this one just keeps me yearning for a more citrusy unfiltered hefe. Mouthfeel: Very refreshing but does indeed lack body compared to most wheat beers I'm accustomed to, spritzy extreme carbonation very hard to get a good pour took some work and patience. Drinkability: One of the most perfect lawnmower beers not too complex in anyway just good ol' refreshing on a hot day."
"This was a disappointing beer from Erdinger as it lacks flavor in my opinion. It poured a huge rocky, frothy white head with a carbonated and clear body with a yellow-gold hue. The nose consisted of malt, banana and clove. The flavor was sweet with a smooth and thin mouthfeel."
"Poured from a brown 500ml bottle. Thick white head, dissappeared after a few minutes. I really like the mouthfeel as the carbonation bubbles in your mouth. The beer is light golden in color. Its a pretty drinkable wheat beer, light in flavor with not much of an aftertaste."
"Wow, I wasn't quite expecting this all the way around. Poured from a 500ml brown bottle with freshness date marked on back label. Very crystal clear golden in appearance, with a huge white foamy head for a fanfare, stuck around a long time, receded to a thin cap and left some great lacing. Not cloudy like an average wheat ale, but that would be because it's ""kristall-klar"". Crisp metallic nose on it, and the faintest scent of spice. Flavour is of sweet malt, some banana, hardly any trace of hops. Mouthfeel may be a little watery, but this is honestly one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had in my life. Could be trouble, but I'd almost be willing to welcome it. To think I couldn't even stand wheat beers some time ago...."
"Very drinkable, better than most pilseners in my opinion. But without the yeast this weisse is boring and without the classic benefits: none of the phenols, flavors, or hangover protection of a hefe-weisse. I guess it serves its purpose, a plain and simple throw-it-back beer."
"This beer is clear and pale, but a huge fluffy head forms. This is a highly drinkable brew, pretty refreshing. It's like a very mellow hefe-flavor in a way, but also very lager-like. It didn't excite me too much. I'd much rather drink a cloudy ass hefe-weizen. But this beer is worth a try."
"The beer pours a cloudless golden yellow to light amber color, the head impressive in size, frothy in texture and the lace nice thick clinging sheets to cover the glass. Malt dominated nose, with that refreshing spritzy citrus crisp and clean tone. Mostly malt at the front, slightly sweet, the top skinny in feel, the finish mellow in its acidity, pleasing in its hop spicy bite, dry lingering aftertaste, quite a refresher no matter the time of year."
"[16.9 oz bottle for $1.99]"
"Notes: A helluva beer, and spot on for the style. A clean, clear, tasty and very drinkable wheat beer. Exactly what it should be."
"Golden brew with a big, fluffy, white head that doesn't go away too soon. It had prickly carbonation, and like the name said, it was crystal clear. The beer was fairly dry up front and had a pretty substantial malt flavor with a hint of vanilla on finish. Also, there was just a little bit of hops for balance. Good beer."
"""Die Prickelnde Frische"" translates to ""No Yeast For You!"""
"After pouring this brew in a glass it had a golden hue with tight white foam. After that it was all down hill. Where was the wheat? It had no bitter taste, but it like drinking a type of lager with no flavor. Pleasent after taste, but after taste of what? First and last time! Where's the Wheat??????"
"Tastes more lagery than anything like a wheat beer, their regular wheat isn't that flavourful anyway, so why the hell would you want to drink a filtered version of it, kind of tasted a bit artificial aswell."
"Pours a clear golden color with adequate carbonation.  The huge thick white creamy head actually stuck a full inch over the lip of the glass.  Very nice to look at.  The aroma was slightly sweet of citrus and malt.  The maltiness carried through into the flavor with the citrusness slilding into the background, although not disappearing.  The finish was slightly watery however.  This is my least favorite of the Erdinger offerings."
"Here's a different wheat beer, there is no hefe, its clear without the yeast so it lacks the stronger flavor that a hefeweisen has.  Clean, smooth mouthfeel.  500ml.  The U.S. importer is Wine Warehouse  City of Commerce, CA."
"Clean, tasty with the stubborn, lacey foam (good). I can take or leave the ""hefe"" in my weizen and in this one I don't miss the yeast. Thirst quenching. German goodness throughout. I wish there was a category for ""value"" because the only strike against it is the price per bottle."
