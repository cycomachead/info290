"Overall, in my opinion, this was a pretty good kristalweizen that as far as I know was pretty good. Hell yeah, I would have this again."
"Delicious brew on tap at Swill Craft Beer Dispensary in Anacortes."

"Overall: they market this as a kristalweizen, which by its appearance it is definitely not. But I'm willing to overlook all that because of the awesome aroma and flavor."

"A pleasant enough, and (almost) clear hefeweizen - the full gamut of flavours informs this offering. Quite quaffable on this typically sunny day, as we cusping Leos start to get 'er going!"

"Overall this is one of those beers that I'm glad I got to try but probably wouldn't buy again. I'm not sure exactly what they were going for here, so I'm not sure whether they achieved it. But Sound seems to be one of those breweries that likes to experiment and I appreciate the spirit behind that, even if they can't all be winners."

"The body was good, clean, dry and refreshing. Drinkability will depend on your tolerance of bubblegum, banana and clove. Overall a nice brew that's worth a shot if you see it, but it's a bit odd, due to the smoky ham aroma and strong bubblegum flavor."
"O: Tasty, drinkable and robust version of a lighter beer but tasty and well done"
