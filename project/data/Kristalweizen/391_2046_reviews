"A Big Rock staple - better than most macros, barely. The hint of wheat sets in apart. Otherwise, you might as well be drinking Molson or Coors."

"Can poured into a shaker pint glass, a pale straw yellow with billowing white bubbles, exactly as I remember this beer from my grad school days when it was a staple at the pub, complete with horrid citrus wedge floater. None of that this time, although after concentrating on this beer's flavor I can kinda understand where the urge to apply further seasoning comes from. Aroma is sweet and buttery, more so than its counterpart Big Rock Velvet Fog, with a saccharine fruitiness that recalls fermented apple juice, faint lemon and lime rinds, and white bread barley malt ... No real wheat spice on the nose although there is more of this on the palate, with apple and faint lemon starting things off and musty white peppercorn spice showing up late, along with a little root cellar funk and metallic notes. Thin, fizzy yet with a diacetyl slickness, and generally unoffensive and easy drinking. Finishes semi-dry. I prefer Velvet Fog, which has more wheat character and a more assertive flavor period, although with this style of beer we aren't expecting anything too robust. I have a few more cans squirreled away for a sunny day."

"Taste, very middle of the road, still a plenty light body. Wheat, no hops, some lemon or orange rind maybe to it. Very easy to drink beer, one of those summer or friend beers to have around. Can't say there is anything wrong with this beer, it just is. Carbonation seems high to give it an even lighter body I would guess. Some fruity metallic notes on the undercurrent if you look for it."

" Overall, definitely an enjoyable brew in summer."

"D - Alright, now that I've spent this entire review sounding snobby and whiny, I'll admit this is a thoroughly drinkable brew and is completely unoffensive. There are no off flavors present, but there's so little flavor here it would be hard to get it wrong. This is just another example of an pseudo-micro brewery product that would lend itself a hand in the rating department if it was marketed under the proper style; that is, a lager. It's because of beers like this that people are getting the wrong idea about craft beer. Oh, and insert generic and obligatory 'it's a step above Bud but nothing special' comment here. Thanks, but I'll pass next time."

"Overall - Definitely nothing to go out of your way for, but when your other options are coors light or molson canadian, this is a decent option."
""
""

"O - A farily uninspiring example of the style. Only worth ordering if my other options are Labatt or Molson."

"Grabbed a pint at ethel's lounge. Poured a half finger head into a pint glass, yellow amber colour, white head with little retention. Smell is wheat with biscuit and a hint of citrus. Taste was a bitter wheat with an off aftertaste, with some nice grapefruit and pepper notes. Medium body with some carbonation, not overly smooth. Not a bad brew but if i had known they had mad tom i would not have even considered it."
"Big Rock Grasshopper Wheat Ale (Calgary): I was on vacation in the Calgary/Banff area and that afforded me the opportunity to try the Big Rock Breweryâ€™s Grasshopper Wheat Ale. It pours with a thin head that fades rapidly and has a very clear amber color. This is a filtered wheat. Not much of an aroma to speak of. Flavor is OK, but thin. With good mouthfeel, this is an OK drinkable beer. But it is not an outstanding wheat. Try it if you are in Calgary, but not worth going out of your way to sample this brew."
"Had a chance to try a Big Rock Grasshopper at a conference in Calgary. The bottle was poured into a tall pilsner glass and did not generate much head. The color was more yellow than golden and the clarity was clear for a wheat beer, which surprised me a little. There was some cirtus notes to the nose, but not overpowering. The taste was good, well balance wheat beer nothing extravagent. The mouthfeel made for a perfect after lawn mowing beer."
"I may be biased because I'll always have a soft spot for this beer in my heart, but I still like Grasshopper. Along with Trad, it is one of the mainstay Big Rock brews that I will always remember fondly as somewhat exotic but still familiar. Not outstanding, but worlds away from the bland, seedy underworld of macro lagerdom."
"D: I would probably buy something else before this but there's nothing offensive with this beer. It's a average easy drinker."
"Drinkability- Quite drinkable if one expects a relatively bland, albeit inoffensive beer."
"D- Not much of a wheat fan but it seems to be a middle of the line kind of wheat. Wouldn't go out of my way to order it"
"D - It's a bit bland but it is easy to drink and refreshing on a hot summer day."
"An easy beer to drink but more like a watered down lager than a wheat beer."
"Half pint served in a glass. Came with a lemon wedge which I threw out but not before the meagre head was killed. Some lacing. Clear golden yellow. Hardly any smell. A mildly flavoured beer. A light hops finish. A slightly bitter metallic aftertaste. A very drinkable summer beer - refreshing and well balanced. A worthy go to beer commonly found in Western Canada."
"This is a smooth, easy to drink beer. The flavor is limited but it's refreshing and would make a good session or summer beer."
"Woody is bang on when he says the head is the colour of French vanilla. The head also shows poor retention. The beer itself is golden in colour and crystal clear. It has a mildly sweet aroma with a possibly imagined hint of banana candy or vanilla. It tastes slightly tangy with a very subtle banana note. Subtle just might be an overstatement. Clean, but bland and devoid of character to the point of being insipid. It feels thin and watery with a light body and low carbonation. Really refreshing on a hot summers day; so is a good pilsener, and a good pilsener would pack a little bit more flavour than this."
"I got a rocky two fingers' worth of French Vanilla-colored head with great retention. Color was a beautiful golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a slight grainy sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a light sweetness on the tongue. Finish continued with a light sweetness. Lawnmower beer!"
"D: Interesting, but not great."
"While I'd characterize this as a lackluster wheat beer, I'd hardly hesitate to choose between this one and the XO if forced to make the choice. This one is not great, but at least it's not awful. In fact, on a really hot summer afternoon, this would make a suitable light refreshment. I wouldn't go out of my way to score a six-pack of these, but between the Big Rock Traditional and the XO, this one lands smack in the middle taste-wise."
"Despite its faults, Grasshopper is indeed drinkable, and I could see myself having a few of these on a patio on a hot day. Nothing about the beer offends me - it's not skunky or poorly crafted - but then again, nothing impresses me about it either. If saying ""nothing about it offends me"" and ""drinkable"" are the highest praise I can muster, then it's probably worth moving on to something else."
"hard to avoid in Calgary, not that you need to avoid this beer, it's just nothing worth bragging about"
"Overall, a decent brew. I'd much rather prefer a nice tasty hefeweizen but this is a great quaffable macro that deviates from that crowd enough to make me willing to buy a 6er of this on a hot day."
"Overall, it is a good beer for drinking, just nothing out of the ordinary for enjoying. A step above a drinking beer in comparison to a macro beer."
"Drinkability - you can pound away on a few of these without any problem. A good beer for the summertime evenings."
"D - highly drinkable, just not very interesting. This is very close to an adjunct lager in taste."
"Final Thoughts: Well, after trying this I can see why this style hasn't really taken off as well as Wits or Hefs. It's a bit tame by wheat beer standards, and too strange by guzzler standards. Still, I enjoyed the experience and it would be a good buy for going camping, which I think is the way this beer is marketed, given the name. I'd pick up a six pack for the weekend, just for a change of pace."
"Pours with an extremely small, white head, with virtually no lacing and a clear, yellow color. As for aroma...doesn't really smell like much, to be honest, let alone wheat. Body and texture are light and thin, with average carbonation. Duration of the flavor is extremely short... swallow it and it's gone. I can't really taste any wheat, either... tastes very light, almost like a light macro beer. Overall it's ok for drinking on a hot day, but if you want a real wheat ale, try something else."
"This is a remarkably boring wheat beer, but acceptable as a Canadian craft alternative to AALs as a post yard-work beer."
"Overall not to bad, it was neat getting to try a new beer. It wasn't too hoppy and it wasn't too malty. Very easy to drink."
"A decent enough Americanized wheat ale, nothing all that complex, and worthy enough of multiple indulgences, given the right conditions when and/or if you find yourself adrift in Wild Rose country. And one other thing - I looove saying the name of this beer with an Aussie accent. I just do."
"Notes: A little bland for my liking, would've liked a little more complexity, but very refreshing and highly drinkable"
"Drinkability: I liked this one. It is crisp clean and has a good flavor to it."
"D- I first tried this at a local bowling alley and I have to admit, I really enjoyed it so I bought some and continue to like this. It's not as pronounced as an unfiltered wheat beer but I think this is easy to drink, has enough flavor to enjoy over an evening and would especially be great during a hot summer as a staple. I do recommend this and I think Big Rock does a great job on just about all of their products!"
"Overall this was the first Big Rock brew I tried and was a favorite of mine when I first started to explore the craft beer scene. But nowadays my tastes have expanded quite a bit and this really is nothing more than an over-priced beer ( $12.25 a 6'er) and a beer that is slightly better than Labatts or Molsons. Good intro beer."
"D: not so sure about this one - it's basically a lager with very subdued weizen characteristics. I guess that's the style, but still very average. Easy to drink, but I wont be looking for this one again."
"As the sun gets warmer the Grasshopper becomes more of an option on tap with a slice of lemon. This is a clean crisp Am Wheat with decent finish and great drinkability. Don't kid yourself this is no sipper or complex ale. However unlike the XO lager this one IMHO nails the style."
"Really don't enjoy fizzy beer, which this is. Meant to be drank ice-cold on a hot day, I wouldnt have it otherwise."
"In terms of a wheat beer, this is not very good, but it is refreshing in a similar way macro-lager's are. Can imagine this tasting good on a hot day."
"Pours a light straw clear yellow with decent white head that turns to a 1/8 collar and mild lacing.Not much in the nose here,very faint grains,grass,musty kinda odor.Taste is not much either,a touch bitterness and musty grass that leaves a heavy dull dry feel in the mouth,medium body with a flatness to it.Not much to reccomend here,got this one in the 15 can variety pk,like the warthog and the ale way better than this one."
"Waitress told me this one was a hefe, which was a touch confusing to start. Pours a copper color with a bit of head that dissolves fairly fast. Strangely crystal clear for a wheat beer - my first hint of a problem. I later realized it was a kristal, so I gave it a repreive. Nose is mostly malt with a touch of wheat and lemon. Pretty weak. Taste is stronger, although still dominated by lemon and malt (not wheat, as is generally the pattern). Body is medium, average, with strong carbonation. Overall, very mediocre, although not particularly offensive. Wouldn't want to have to many."
"Poured clear, light golden without any obvious sign that it's a wheat beer. Very fizzy with an off-white head, half a finger. The retention was not bad at all. Wet grass / damp basement odour. Unpleasant taste, bitter / sour effect. I tried to put my finger on the aftertaste but kept wondering if they use real grasshoppers in this beer .... Truth be told, I was glad to get this tasting over with and chose not to finish the bottle. I've had other products from this brewery that I thought were perfectly okay; as for this beer, I would not recommend it."
"This beer has an aroma that reminds more of rye than wheat. It has a nice golden colour when poured. It is smooth to the tongue and is smooth tasting. I would certainly recommend this beer to somebody wanting to try a decent wheat beer without paying a lot of money."
"I really want to like this brewer's product, given they were once the lone beacon of micro-brewers here in Alberta, but so far I haven't been impressed"
"Pours a clear golden yellow with bubbly white head that laces fairly well. Aroma of cereal, bit of citrus, some off I can't quite put my finger on. Taste was some sweet grain, almost like corn, with bit of wheat tang and some dry hops in the finish. Mouthfeel was clean, with some hop crispness. This is not a great beer, but wouldn't be terrible on a hot day."
"I'd rate this higher as a macro lager, cause it drinks ok. But for the style, and from the can.. this was worse than I would have expected..."
"D - Drinks like a macro."
"Grasshopper (why the umlauts?) is a average North American Pale Wheat Ale whose biggest positive is its mouthfeel and its benign drinkability. I could toss back a few of these if there was nothing better on hand, but better beer shouldn't be that hard to come by. Even in Canada."
"Pours a very bright gold with a light head the disappates very quickly. In spite of my bad attitude, it turns out to have suprisingly good taste. Good, solid hop character for the style, smooth, but present, a more than adequate mouthfeel, and there's not bitter or off aftertaste to the beer that often happens with a light mass market. While light and excessively easy to drink, it is by no means unenjoyable. If I was in a meat market beer bar, I'd order this over other macros. Being in a can gives a bad impression to start, but it seems to have no real affect. I've rarely had a beer from a can since sipping on my Dad's Miller Light in the 70's, so this is a refreshing surprise."
"At first glance, this poured a bright yellow with minimal head. Not terrible but not overly impressive either. Smell is a bit nasty, a bit like dirty feet. This stuff however doesn't taste too bad. Clean, Refreshing, with a wheaty aftertaste that is actually quite pleasant. Easy going and quite a nice accompaniment to a hot summer day."
"The mouthfeel was also light. Overall, not a very good beer. Just not assertive enought to warrant having another."
"This beer does have drinkability going for it, if you were out to pound down a few on a hot day, you would find Grasshopper an easy choice. I'd say it is a wheat beer for the macro masses. Not much to it, but different enough to make the average beer drinker feel like he's trying something wild."
"Appeared a bright gold golor with a sturdy, white colored head that didn't move a muscle. Aromas of grains, dried fruit, and lemon with a touch of citrus. The taste was that of a hefe with subtle banana flavors. Flavorful with elements of fruits and citrus/lemon while still having bread & grain characteristics underneath. Good texture with the carbonation; refreshing and engaging. Good drinkability, had a few of these without a problem."
"Not terrible. I could drink a couple, I guess, but probably wouldn't session it or seek it out. I will try some others by Big Rock if I can find them in Ontario."
"Mouthfeel is good but not great - slightly overcarbonated and a little thin in the mouth - but drinkability is quite impressive. Big Rock Grasshopper Wheat Beer is most definitely a brew that you'd have while enjoying the company of friends in the dead of summer; perhaps out by the pool or on the patio. Multiple drinks are the name of the game, and while Grasshopper is far from an ideal in terms of representing its' style, its quite tasty, and no doubt a catalyst in good times. If only for that reason, then, it's worth a try."
"Rather weak looking pour, nothing like the beautiful violent carbonation I've seen in this style before. Head subsides quickly to nothing, with not much lace to speak of. I find that a lot of Big Rock's beers tend to pour rather weakly and then have good zip in the mouth...we'll see. Smell is a bit sour, obscuring the natural pear/banana notes i'm hoping to find. Taste is nicer than the smell though. Good, wheaty/bready malts, banana, sour notes after. Taste weakens quickly and feels thin, slides down real easy. This is a pretty clean and refreshing beer, but not very exciting. A straight average offering from Big Rock."
"This or Mcnally's Extra are the best Big Rock Offerings. This is an unchallenging, simple yet tastey pale wheat ale. It would be good in the summer."
"Great summer/after-exercise beer."
"Drinkability: An ok easy drinking beer. Worth a try, but would I have it again? Possibly, if its the best or the only thing available. I had one and moved on to something else."
"Effectively a slightly lemony flavored ale, without much wheat beer character. Straw in colour, not much head. Very little aroma to speak of with this one. A bit over-carbonated too.. Nice enoughon a hot summer day if your options are limited, but I'd prefer a real wiezen or wit given the opportunity."
"A nice, refreshing beer. This was first non-macro brew I ever had, introduced by a friend. Drinkable, goes great with barbecue and warm weather."
"This beer has all the elements of a nicely drinkable beer, but the taste is a big let down. Decent aroma, nice mouthfeel, disappointing taste. All in all I'm pretty disappointed in this. I'm glad I only have 2 out of a variety 12pack. I probably won't be drinking this anytime soon."
"Bottle: Poured a fizzy golden color ale with a small head with no retention. Aroma is comprised of weak wheat. Taste is again quite weak on wheat with a gross watery aftertaste. There is also some sourness that I could detect that wasnÂ’t pleasant at all. Bad bad stuff."
"The beer is smoothe and goes down easy. It is very easy to sit down and drink several of these."
"D- Very light beer that did show any fruitiness or any wheat flavor. I felt this was a kristal weizen that was trying to appeal to an American adjunct lager drinking market."
"Taste was of shy caramel some shy bitterness and leaving an oily feeling."
"This beer is an excellent example of what my German friends call 'Good North American beer'--it tastes like water, so it can't taste bad. But in all seriousness, it's refreshing and I kind of like it despite all my criticism, so it's not a failure."
"Thx"
"Mouthfeel is quite thin and watery but it hangs on to a bit of body somehow. I don't have any urge to drink more of this...but it was worth a shot. Thanks (I think) to kmpitz2 for hooking me up with the bottle."
"Why am I reviewing this hot weather summer beer in December? Was at a Christmas party with this, Coors light, and Molson Canadian as the choices."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light gold color with two fingers of head. There is just a little bit of lacing. The smell is light and malty, with some lemon and other light citrus fruits. A bit of wheat in the nose as well. The taste is malty as well. Pale and wheat malts, with just a hint of citrus. Not much else going on. The mouthfeel is a little light and watery. The drinkability is fairly good though. Doesn't taste too much like a weizen, but still ok tasting."
"Nothing special tastewise, nothing to distinguish it. Has a somewhat unpleasant bitter dry finish."
"I like the label. Pours out a clear yellow color with small head that goes away quickly. There's nothing much in the smell. Maybe some lemon, I think. Smells macro-ish. On to the flavor. Flavor reminds me of a Bud Light. Pretty boring and over produced. Not too impressed with this one."
"This beer pours a pale yellow color, with a finger of head that falls quickly. The nose is sweet wheat with a hint of citrus in it. Not exactly what I was expecting. The taste is pretty bland. Not a whole lot going on it it. No creamy banana, no nothing. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Drinkability is not really good either. Just an okay beer without much either direction."
"On tap at the Manx in Ottawa, ON. Decent enough. Crystal clear, light golden with a nice off-white head that lasts for a while and than dies. The aromas are of wheat, banana, and an odd flavor that I can not place. The taste is wheaty, yeasty, and spicy, this actually tastes more like a medicore wheat, than a weizen. The mouthfeel is medium bodied-light, and the drinkability is OK. Not bad for a local version."
"Sampled 8/6/04 at the Charlotte Room, Toronto; the server kept trying to put fruit on my rim. The fruit would have totally blown the ale's own flavor away. Can't help but think this is brewed with fast consumtion in mind..."
"341mL brown bottle, freshness date stamped on 6-pack box."
"Another 1.75 years and I had this in fresh bottle. Less metallic, easy drinking."
"If you crave German weizens give this a pass and get 3 liters of Schneiders or Ayinger or 4 Erdinger or Konig Ludwig instead of six of these domestics. If you get stuck in vacation country with no Euro weizens to be found this will do in a pinch."
"Appearance: When the bartender says that they have a wheat beer flowing, I got all excited and ordered one right away. The beer came in a mug with a lemon wedge already there, the filtered appearance saddens me with the golden orange tone of the beer and fizzy thin white head, leaves behind some specks of lace. Aroma: A nice citrusy zing doesn't have any of the great yeast characteristics I have come to enjoy from the German hefeweizen, but it's not bad sharp sweetness decent. Taste: The flavor is a spritzy mix of sweetness and citrus tones but a bit bland, when I added the lemon to my beer (which I never do) it actually improved this one. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body with very fizzy carbonation, not bad but again I was looking for a fluffy textured hefe. Drinkability: I had a couple over the course of the weekend not my favorite but a solid wheat ale if that's what your into, I'm not."
"This poured with very minimal head, and one which disappeared very quickly, leaving only the least bit of lace. In appearance it resembles a classic Pilzen type style: it is exceptionally clear. The colour is honey, with faint hues of yellow. A grainy, lemony smell greets the nose at first. Slight sourness. Some very slight flowery hop aromas exist. Appetising. The taste is definitely wheat-filled, producing a strong grainy feel on the palate, with a pleasant citrus note in the middle of the tongue. The hop presence is subtle, yet well-balanced. Initially on the tongue one can sense the slight sweetness and delicate sourness so highly beloved in wheat beers. The drinkability of this brew is exceptional: it can be quaffed easily, and has enough flavour to mildly please knowledgable drinkers. No, it is not overly complex, or even exciting, but it IS highly refreshing and drinkable. It would probably be a good beer to start some sewage-water beer drinker off on the road to better beer drinking."
"Notes - Grasshopper is probably the first beer I ever truly liked, and remains an affordable, above average beer. Some consider lemons in beer to be a sign of terrible beer, but I find it does a LOT for this one."
"Light gold color on the pour, modest bright white head that is frothy in its texture as it dissolves a thin sheet of lace makes attempts at sealing off the glass. Nose is lightly sweet, crisp and clean a hint of grapefruit, start somewhat sweet, top cadaverous. Finish spitefully acidic, hops lean and the aftertaste droughty, all in all a somewhat bland beer."
"Light gold color. Small head. Aroma is slightly malty. A very light bodied wheat beer. Some malts, some hops. Not much flavor. Beat macro swill, but why bother. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is neutral. not bad, but really nothing to recommend it."
"Overall: A pleasant enough beer, that is rather drinkable and not that bad at all, but as a Â“Wheat AleÂ” it disappoints me. I am not sure that I would seek it out again to be honest, but I would not refuse it if I was offered another one. A very Â“averageÂ” Average Beer!"
"Well. The label says ""Wheat Ale", but I don't really see the resemblance. If this were a macro lager, it would be pretty good."
"This grasshopper jumps across the field just fine but it just so happens to land in the mouth of a hungry bird."
"This is my 2nd wheat beer, and the first from a bottle. On a hot day, it cools you down and quenches your thirst. A pretty good beer, this is. But that's it. Not WOW, KAZOWA, GIMME MORE!!! Poured a slightly dark straw colour. Medium head which disipated withing a few minutes, but still left some lace in on the glass. Smelled some barley, hops and wheat. Hey, this is a wheat beer, no? Unfortunately, I didn't taste that much wheat. It was more like an above average pilzner. A little disappointing. Granular mouthfeel, slightly oily. Pretty drinkable, though. Above average beer, but I want to try some more wheat ales with yeast before to compare it with this."
"Admittedly I am a fan of the Big Rock Brewery, and Grasshopper is my personal mainstay from their line, and one of my favorite regional ales to drink on a regular basis when out and about. It pours out a darker golden hue, with a big white head, which dissipates after a couple of minutes, and then leaves a bit of a lace. Nose is sweet and citrusy, and the flavour matches that, a bit crisp as well. Smooth mouthfeel, I can drink a lot of this stuff, and that's not just a hypothetical statement. Not exactly a traditional weiss beer, but a good stepping stone into the style for those who are apprehensive at first. Also my favorite beer to ween people off of macros at first. A great hot weather summer beer."
"Mouthfeel is very light and clean, with interesting carbonation. It's a nice tasty wheat beer."
"Very dry offering with a nice taste that quickly leaves. Head is thin but collars the glass nicely. I am not overly familiar with wheat beers but I do believe I could get to like them if they are like this. The ABV on this bottle is listed at 5.0"
"Light straw, thin but persistent white head. Light aroma of grass, lemon, wheat grains. Super light mouthfeel. Mildly tart with some citrus hop create a refreshing but insubstantial flavor experience. A rather unremarkable, light wheat ale."
