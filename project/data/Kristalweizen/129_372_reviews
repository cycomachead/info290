"overall, it's a decent beer, and one that just may take me back to where i think my heart yearns to be. lower abv than i'm accustomed to lately with all the belgiums and trippels, but there's always whiskey, right?"
"Overall - Awesome crystal wheat; one of the best ones I've had. Will buy again. Very refreshing. Their regular hefe and dunkel are average; this one is superb!"
""
"O: Not usually a weizen fan, but this one is actually pretty good. Great for a warm late-summer day. Very nice."
""
"(re-visited in July 2013)"
"O- Not great, but above average and very drinkable."
"This is a very good beer overall, but for the kristalweizen style, this might be the best one that I've found so far. Well worth the wait."
"Nice rocky white head poured into a tall pilsner glass. Smell is of banana, raisin, fruitcake, CO2. Super light, refreshing and smooth on the palate. Really cool and sparkly. Very mild and satisfying finish with a thirst quenching, light mouthfeel. Excellent. Good beer for a hot day. PERFECT stepping off point for a ""regular"" beer drinker. It has all of the good points and none of the bad of your everyday beer."
"O: I enjoyed this kristall weizen and would recommend it. Perfect for the end of a summer's day."
""
"Pours a nice clear golden color with white foam head. smells mostly of cloves. Tastes good, light on flavor, cloves, no off flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth with a good amount of carbonation. overall a very good beer with high drinkability, just a cut below the Weihenstephaner Kristallweis,"
"Pours a clear golden color with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, banana, and slight spice aromas. Taste is of wheat, spices, yeast, and subtle banana flavors on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the aromas and flavors are somewhat subtle."
"Had this one right before having the Dunkel Weizen.. I didnt care for it much... definatley a better taste then american made weizens to me but not my cup of tea... apperance and smell were very good... i had to try it though and it wasnt the worst of course but probably would try it again sometime down the road..."

"Surprisingly very good. Definitely drinkable, enjoyable, would seek out and have again."
""
"Pours a clear gold body with a big white head that is very frumpy and long-lasting, and laces the glass in puffy clumps. Aromas are very subdued. I get some sweet wheat and general graininess, but not much else besides some light bananas and cloves. The banana and cloves express themselves more distinctly on the palate, which is sweet up front before leading to a very chalky finish with an unusual texture. This is an intriguing beer. One well worth investigating to see if one of its challenging corners is particularly appealing to you."
"M: The beginning is neutral, balanced with some tending to sweet as per the style changing a little at the end to a faint bittersweetness."
"Drinkability: It is a good brew, but I am not too impressed. On the spectrum of Bavarian wheat beers, it probably falls smack dab in the middle. Which is still saying a lot. Few American wheats have this much character. And I hang my head in shame."
"T: very nice wheat flavour, crisp on tongue, complex and balanced among sweetness, citrusy and bitterness, medium-light body. semi dry finish"
"This beer is probably one of the best in its style, highly recommended."
"O: This is more flavorful than expected and is delightfully light and delicious."
"Overall: About average for a kristalweizen, and, when tried side-by-side with Tucher's underpowered hefe, I preferred actually this."
"Poured from bottle into weizen glass. Pilsner yellow, clear w/ a huge, rocky head of medium bubbles that leaves big patchy blotches of lace. Nose is fruity and spicy, mild banana predominates w/ a hint of allspice or clove. The flavor here is a little watered down w/ a hint of tartness and alight banana cream flavor being just about all this has to off. Lack of off flavors and brisk enough carbonation keep it quaffable which is I guess pretty much what you want out of a kristall."
"A clear, yellow-orange pour with a frothy white head. The aroma has banana, cloves, and some bread. The light body has a slightly thin texture with average carbonation. The taste is on the sweet side with only a hint of hop bitterness right before the finish. This is a good thirst quencher on warm days."
"Drinkability: Drinkable but not really enjoyable. Weihenstephaner has a much better example of this style."
"O: Nice wheat beer here. The nose was a little off-putting, but a nice flavor."
"This is my first kristallweizen, and I like it. Wouldn't mind some more wheat-ness though."
"Poured a medium sparkling clear amber with a large white rocky head that was fully diminishing and had good lacing. The aroma was heavy with yeast, a mild herbal hop and a straw malt with a slight note of banana and clove. It tasted midly bitter yet very smooth at first and finished with a nice yeast flavor with just an ever so slight hint of banana that stayed with you only a short time. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery yet creamy in texture with a nice soft carbonation. Overall a very nice refreshing brew."
"A really drinkable hefe. I will drink this whenever I see it!"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink, refreshing and thirst quenching."
"I hope that I get more of Tucher's offerings soon (besides the dunkles I bought the same day..."
"Big Head, three fingers of white foam, taking a good three minutes to subside. Lace for days clinging from the top of the glass to the liquid. Color is a 3 on the SRM beer color chart. Started hazy, but cleared in a few minutes. Such flavor in such a light colored beer. Smells like lots of malt, roasted wheat and oats and some hops. Taste is great, well balanced, flavors of malt, citrus, wheat, barley, corn, vanilla, and pepper. Lots of body in my mouth. Not easy on the wallet, but great for the price. Shell out the green for this one."
"This beer has a light gold appearance to it, the smell is a very fruity almost banana smell. the taste is a VERY sweet but enjoyable apple/banana taste. its almost too sweet. the mouthfeel on this is amazing. i wish it was never ending personally. As for drinlability i find it hard to do. this beer gave me terrible burps and i was unable to get rid of them. one or two of these and i could honestly say i wouldnt wanna drink anymore because my stomach would feel a little bloated. with that being said its not bad. but its not great."
"I poured this into my Wheat glass from a 500ml bottle. It poured out with a creamy white head much like the natural helles weizen, except this is in fact crystal clear. It is a golden straw color with plenty of evervecent bubbles. Smells slightly of bananas and grain. Tastes like a sweet banana bread much like the natural weizen and of a fruity wheat mix. This beer is a little dryer than the natural. Mouthfeel is a little watery and bubbly. Drinkability is good but I prefer the natural weizen over this. However this beer is solid."
" D- This beer is really nothing without all the yeast character that its cloudy cousin has. It is a bit bland without much character."
"Taste: At first there is the nice banana flavor that is followed by some spices giving it that banana bread flavor. That sticks around for a little but then goes away leaving not much of a lingering taste (which I sometimes prefer)."
"D: great drinker and great stuff, a gratifying beer. High marks"
"Drinkability - This is a great hefe. I will be drinking it regularly."
"I'm still fresh to the style, but this one seems like a good example and is a pretty tasty, refreshing beer."
"I can't say that this beer will ever make a top ten list, but it's certainly worth the moderate price, a good value and tasty little brew."
"Pours to a pale yellow with a foamy white head that dissipated fairly quickly but left decent lacing. Nose is a light mixture of wheat, yeast, floral and a hint of bubblegum. Mouthfeel is muted and only slightly tingly. Taste is har dto pick up, as nothing from the nose really stands out. Finsih, while pleasant, is fairly non-descript, although the beer is a nice thirst quencher."
"A solid effort and I was happy that bananas were not a dominating flavor."
"Aroma is fairly strong, yeasty and wheaty with just a touch of citrus. It pours a rather wan clear yellow, but at least it has a fairly thick and persistent white head. Flavor is typical for a wheat beer, yeasty and a little thick with more than a hint of lemon, pleasant if not outstanding. Texture is smooth and refreshing and a little tingly."
" If you have a dog, sit on your porch in July and watch it hunt a squirrel while you sip this out of a giant mug. I promise you, that's what God's doing at the exact same time."
"Drinkable like a good glass of water. I would seek this out on a extremely hot and humid day where you want to alternate between beer and hidration."
"D - this is almost too easy to drink. It is a little less flavorful than their regular hefeweizen, but this is still pretty delicious and enjoyable."
"Much cleaner and more easily drinkable than most Hefeweizens, this would be an even better introductory beer for macro drinkers than the standard unfiltered version. My first filtered Hefe, I'm impressed by the crisp drinkability of this style."
"D: Goes down easily, though I'd like some more flavor. The appearance and aroma didn't suffer noticeably from the lack of included yeast, but the flavor and mouthfeel did a bit. I think I'll stick to the hefeweizens if I'm craving a light weizen."
"Drinkability: The light floral flavors do not really move me, but that is probably a comment on the style more than this one in particular. A solid brew, but not one that I am really going to go out of my way to buy."
"D- Very enjoyable. A filtered hefeweizen."
"Pours a golden color that is clear. Maybe a shade on the lighter side. Massive head that goes down slow an unevenly. Smell is a classic malt liquor that is not weak, but not extreme either. Taste is a little watered down malt liquor. About the same after taste of a classic malt liquor and as drinkable as a classic malt liquor. Verdict: If you have never tried malt liquor or rarely drink it, it would be a tossup between this and ""The Bull"" for a classic malt liquor taste."
"Nothing special (from a quality brewer) but beats most of the Mass Producers 'run-off'..."
"drinkability- easy to drink, although i wanted a bit more. still, worth it"
"I keep thinking ""bright"" as I drink this. It's an assuming, crisp, clean, clear, flavorful beer, and one that is immensely drinkable. Would love to check out more variations on this style, and would love to see more craft-level U.S. brewers give kristalweizens a shot."
"Drinkability is excellent. Get a pint of this for sitting with friends and enjoying a laugh, as this will satisfy any night on the town."
"overall i am glad i bought this but weihenstephaner is a superior beer"
"Bottle from the Vacaville BevMo. Pours a straw-like yellow brown with a huge 2 inch head. Excellent clarity and sticky Rorschach test lacing. Bready malt odor with hints of banana and tangy fruit. Some ethanol also evident. Flavor is a bit more tangy and banana-y than the odor lets on. Banana mixes with a nice soft malt body for a nice light easy-drinking experience. Hint of spicy hops and alcohol on the finish with more banana Light to medium bodied and easy to drink. Not bad."
"All in all a decent beer but not a style I anticipate making a habit of. Much of the complexities of a Hefe are lost here making this almost like a lager. I guess wheat is 'more holy' than corn..."
"Poured into goose island pilsner glass. Pours a light golden color with three fingers of foamy white head. Soft banana-y smell. Taste is smooth and kind of wheaty with soft banana and lemon undertones. Very carbonated. Light clean mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Perfect beer for a hot summer day. Too bad it's January. Not a big fan of light beers but this is excellent."
"Pours an ultra clear light amber with billowy dense white and long lasting head. Smell: sweet pale malt, salty wheat, a hint of cloves, spiciness, yeast, and just a touch of not-quite-ripe banana. Taste: tangy lemon and wheat, grassy, with a malt sweetness and a hint of clove. Soft, active carbonation with a crisp finish. Not quite as nice as their hefeweizen, but I can see picking this over many helles or pils."
"D - Aside from the pretty looks, nothing too distinguishing. Very easy to drink, though; it might not be a bad session choice. It may also find favor with those who don't think beer should look cloudy. Certainly not a bad beer, though."
"D - Aside from the pretty looks, nothing too distinguishing. Very easy to drink, though; it might not be a bad session choice. It may also find favor with those who don't think beer should look cloudy. Certainly not a bad beer, though."
"Drinkability is high. It's definitely sessionable and pleasant. Flavor is fine, but very mild which is what makes it so drinkable."
"D: Kind of a letwdown after their regular Hefe was so good. No problem drinking it, just is pedestrian."
"D: This beer is a bit uneven in my eyes. The taste simply didn't do a thing for me in the least, but there were other elements that made it halfway decent."
"Drinkability- A their beers are good that I know of."
"Over all a nice beer but it doesn't grab my attention and win my heart. With so many other great beers out there especially with similar characteristics I don't see myself seeking this one out again."
"D: Farily good for a light wheat beer. Even on hot days, I prefer the full weiss with all of it's bananas and cloudy yeasty nature. A good wheat starter for those who think the elder brother is too pungent. Sometime NYC area will have this available(hint hint)."
"Overall, this was a super refreshing beer that really outshines many others in this category."
"Pours a clear yellow with a big billowing white head that has good retention. Some lacing is left on the glass. The beer has a nice aroma of banana, cloves, and yeast. The flavor is great. It starts with some cloves but has this sweet fruit flavor that really surprised me. Finishes clean without the graininess I often sense in weizens. Has a light body with a low carbonation that gives a nice smooth coating to the mouth. A great tasting wiezen and a great session beer. I could drink these all summer long. I was very surprised by this beer."
"I picked this one up blindly without knowing what to expect, and was surprised at how good it was. Definitely would recommend."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable wheat beer, this is one of the best weissbier's that I have had, and easily the best Krystal."
""
"When I usually think of Kristall Weizens, I think of American Pale Wheat Ales, but better. As this beer opens, a good healthy dose of Pilsner malts, medium wheat aromas and flavors, and a mild hint of grain flavor. While the esters, phenolics, and overall strong yeast character is timid, the bready / malty notes shine. The beer isn't without all esters though; I get a nice lemon character, followed up by a peppery, bubble-gummy note that gives a lot of variety to the beer. The filtering does strip much viscocity from the beer, making it less creamy and full, but does make for a beer that is easier to drink without bloating. Finishes quite clean, but with a light grain / wheat blend and a lingering lemon flavor. Nice beer."
"D - A nice almost watery hefe for those who prefer the lower sugar content and lighter body. I wouldn't mind having a few of these in the future if it wasn't for the price, but it strikes a good balance between a light lager and an actual hefeweizen."
"Dunkels are my thing but this kristall weizen was certainly something different. Had it well chilled in a pilsner glass. Poured a ""kristall"" clear peircing golden color that shined nicely. Aroma was robust with wheat, peach, and some banana. Taste was really clean and crisp, not that tart yeast taste you get in a lot of hefe's. A very easy drinking beer."
"Overall, this is a beer with few flaws. Decent flavor and high drinkability. I could drink these all day in the summer, well all year where I live."
"Popped this one on this lovely day-before the start of spring to celebrate acceptance to culinary school. pours out an actively foamy head, caps a straw-like brew. Looks like a very foamy pils, as Kristal-weiss should. Aromas are extremly light, faint straw, faint wheat, tiniest touch of cloves and then banana. Flavor is walnut-like in it's delicacy, slight nuttiness, finish of grassy wheats. Mouthfeel is crisp and light. I was served this type of beer in Germany garnished with a lemon(American Heresy!) The flavors of this bier are very light, subdued, and mellow as it was designed to be. Ive had better offerings of this style, but this is a solid example."
"D- This is very easy to drink; it will not knock you off your feet, but is a nice good brew."
"The best way to summarize this beer is: Hefe-weisse collides with a pilsiner."
"Pours a crystal clear golden straw color with a huge dense pure white head that dissipated into a nice cap leaving plenty of chunk lacing on the glass. The smell is of clove and wheat malt, with some light banana. The taste is light. Their hefe taste was light and this follows course. The taste has light wheat characteristics, some phenols. Has more of a grainy type presence. The feel is light and almost watery with prickly carbonation, finishes quite neutral. Rather bland but does have some nice hefe characteristics. Very drinkable and quite good but doesn't compare to Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier. Prost!"
"D - Overall I think this is a pretty good beer nothing outstanding but worth a try if you find it."
" Overall this was a really nice Hefe. The clearness of it through me for a little bit, but overall I felt it added a lot to it being much lighter and crisper all around. It went very well with dinner as it did not fill you up anymore then you needed to be. Again a good little sessionable german that is a definite to give a try if you see it. It will surely not disappoint if the style is what are you are going for.."
"Overall: A good German Kristall Weizen, which I am guessing to be a filtered hefe. Tasty and enjoyable, a good summer drinker, worth a try but not really something Id stock up on unless I could find it for a good case price."
"D - Very good. I don't see much difference from their Hefe Weizen."
"d-A quite decent kristalweisen, would not likely buy again due to Weinstephaner kristalweisen being just as accessible to me. Still a very drinkable beer and would drink if offered to me again."
"16.9 oz brown bottle purchased at Greens in Columbia, SC. Tucher Kristall Weizen pours a nice slightly cloudy golden color with a billowy, thick white head. Aroma is of banana and cloves with some yeastiness as expected. Crisp and clean with the usual clove and banana flavors present and just enough hop bitterness to let you know they are there. My first kristal weizen and definately not my last."
"Lingering powdery wheat taste."
"Drinkability: On the whole, I think I prefer Erdinger's kristal weizen. Accessible, for sure. A touch disappointing, though maybe I'm just not a fan of the style."
"D- Light and easy these would go down very quick."
"Overall, I never had this style before, but everything seems to be on par with what I've read. The yeasty finish is killer."
"Tucher Kristall Weizen pours a nice golden color with a thick white head from a brown one pint, one ounce bottle. Aroma is banana and cloves as expected. Quite crisp, clove and banana are present, as are some hops toward the end. Also seems to be a somewhat metallic taste too, although its not really too distracting. Pretty good, worth a try for sure."
"Yeah, it's dry, but we expect richer taste from Bavarian Weizen."
"Pours into a weizen glass with the typical large head of a wheat beer. Clear straw yellow with rising champagne-esque carbonation. A standard yeast/low hops aroma. Yet this is quite fruity even though the yeasts that gave that flavor are long gone. Quite rerfeshing."
"A big let down after the pour."
"drinkability: Easy to drink but not special in any way, and a little off."
"I found this to pour very well. It is very ""clean"" for a Weizen (guess that's why they call it ""Kristall""). It does have a fruity...almost sweet smell. I like the overall taste, but it is not quite as flavorable as other Weiss beers... like most Hefe's. I don't know if that has to do with the clear nature? The mouthfeel is good, it's very light and crisp. It goes down smooth. I find the drinkability to be very high. This is a lighter beer, not filling. I think this would be a great beer to have on a hot summer day. Overall, I find other Weiss beers/ Weizens to have more flavor, but this is still a very good beer."
"Drinkabilty is good. Very subtle flavors but by no means flavorless."
"I continue to be impressed by Brauerei Tucher Brau. I had despaired of ever finding a version of the krystal weizen style that appeals to me, but this one most certainly does. I'll still grab a quality hefe weizen every time, but it's nice to know that if I ever develop a yeast sensitivity, there's a wonderful beer available that is a more than worthy substitute."
"Tasted Medium rare banana bread. A level of bitterness seeps its way into the drink towards the end. It just rolls around perfectly on the palate. Mild carbonation but present enough to get the job done. I was in the mood for another tall bottle of this as soon as I finished so its gotta have some drinkability. Pleasantly surprised."
"John W (Bham UK)"
"Drinkability: A nice example of the style if this is the type of thing you like"
"I think I have found a favorite weizen. I usually go for the cloudy, funky ones, but filtered or not, this one has what I want. Must keep this in stock in the fridge."
"I worried at first that I might have gotten a bad bottle, as Great Spirits doesn't seem to do a lot of business in singles, but I couldn't taste any skunk to this beer and I think that it tasted the way it was supposed to taste -- I think I just didn't care for it. If I have the opportunity to try a few more Kristals in the coming weeks (my liquor store only carries this one), I will see if my opinion changes and possibly re-review. Otherwise, I must give a largely negative review to this beer."
"I bought a bottle of this simply due to my experience the previous evening with the Hefe. I was stuck in something close to beer hell: Orlando. Well, this beer was barely better than nothing. The beer had a typical golden appearance, with a minimal head. The aroma was also virtually non-existent. The taste was more pils than weizen, with a slight sharpness that reminded me of sterling hops. The mouthfeel was average, and the beer was very well carbonated. The drinkability was a little less than average. I struggled to finish one, and I don't plan on buying another. I also dont plan on returning to the home of the Giant Rat any time soon either...."
"This beer pours a light yellow color with a huge billowing head that falls to about 3 fingers after a while, then to a finger hen letting it sit. The nose is slightly wheaty, slightly banana sweet, with a hint of lemony citrus. Nice. The flavor is right there, with a slight banana, slight lemon. The wheat is not quite so strong. The feel is the very light side of moderate. I find this beer to be a nice example of a kristal. Very crisp and refreshing. The banana sweetness is nice and the citrusy lemony is good as well."
"This beer poured into the glass a brilliant clear gold, with a thick full white head. It sure is a beautiful looking glass of beer. The clarity indicates the beer has been filtered, and this lack of yeast softens the rest of the beers character. The nose still has bits of clove, banana, and vanilla, but less than I detect in a beer mit weizen. The same is true for the taste. Cloves, banana, more vanilla, and just a hint of orange come across. But it is a much lighter flavor than the unfiltered. Light and smooth mouth feel, this is a very drinkable beer. I cant image a better style to have on a warm summer evening."
"Nice mouthfeel, not thin, I could see quaffing these on a warm day!"
"This is a decent beer that would the right thjing to serve at a summer picnic."
"Overall: The second of the Tucher brews that I have tried, both have been solid offerings. The Kristall Weizen is worth a try and is a good above average brew overall."
"Overall, a nice example of the style and another good effort by Tucher. Pretty sweet but not cloying. A nice thirst-quencher."
"Very good, drinkable beer, made to consumed by the liter in a German beer hall. It's the kind of beer that reminds you of why Germans are considered some of the best brewers out there."
"Their dunkel hefeweizen is one to try, but this one is one to be avoided."
"A great beer for food, the dry tart flavor really cleans the palette."
"The taste is very similar to most other German wheat beers, but it seemed to me to have just a tiny trace amount of banana, and a moderate amount of clove-like spice. There was a light to moderate amount of carbonation as well. This lack of carbonation combined with the great taste of this brew, as well as its smoothness, made it very easy to drink. It didn't seem tremendously filling. I feel I could down quite a few of these in a sitting. If you like German wheat beer, you should really give this one a go."
"When poured, it was a clear medium yellow with a lot of white foam and lace on the glass from first sip to last gulp! The smell of spice filled the nose with the aroma of a yeasty nature. The taste, like the smell was of a spicy/yeasty flavor with a hint of cloves. Nice after taste, but lacking intensity on the flavor."
"Staw colored with a huge white cap of foam. Aroma is subtle, maly and fruity. Fewer fruity aromas and flavors, this beer stands on its malt. Typical wheat flavor but lacking the pronounced fruitiness. Bannana makes an understated appearance with a slightly spicy hop finish. Thin body. Great drinking beer if not very complex or interesting."
"This is a clear case (no pun intended) where the kristal is nowhere near as good as the hefe. This one justs falls flat (almost literally). Thin, almost watery. Nowhere near the flavor of the hefe. Certainly refreshing, this would actually make a great step-up for a macro-drinker."
"Light & Crisp, good hot weather session beer."
"Pint bottle pours a clear, honey gold, with a billowy, two finger, white head that looks like frozen shaving cream. Nice, patchy lacing down the glass. Aroma is lemony citrus and wheat grain. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and light to medium bodied. Taste is citrusy refreshing, with lemon in the starring role. Some noticeable yeastiness is present, and a moderate amount of spiciness comes through in the middle, and lasts to the finish. It all ends up dry and spicy, with a lemonrind aftertaste. Not the greatest in style, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"Medium gold color, with a huge white head. Smells of fresh cut grass, malt and fruit. It tastes similar to the any of the euro lagers I have had in the past, only much beeter. Some of the grain and grass taste, but a lot more malty and flavorful. I like this one a lot, very good for picking up a random bottle at the beer store."
"Drinkability  This made for a great in-between-meal snack."
"Bright golden hue, thick/soapy head, decent retention. Grainy, malty on the nose, although a bit faint. Solid and crisp off the cuff; sweet, tender malty flavors, massive carbonation, yet not overpowering. Decent flavoring via wheat, bananas, and some cloves. Citrus notes towards the end, a clean palate to boot. Flavoring somewhat subdued, yet smooth and ever so slick - awesome!"
"Pours a clear golden pale, huge white head that mosty lasts, leaves good lacing. Lot's of tiny bubbled carbonation present in the body. Aroma is soft, mostly citric (lemon/lemon peel), some banana. Flavor is sour, citric, light amounts of banana. Thin mouthfeel, very bubbly (maybe even ""spritzy""). Definately takes a back seat to the Helles Hefe, IMO."
"A great-big, white, fine, thick head. Good. Huge clumpy lacing. Nice. Clear, deep gold beer. This beer definitely has the look. What an interesting nose: grains, flowers, nuts. A tangy, almost lagery front turns sweet and fruity through the middle. Tangy, zingy finish. This is a good, fresh, tangy beer."
"A solid Weizen. I've had better, but I've also had much worse. Good for if you're not looking for something too heavy."
"($1.99 / 16 oz.)"
"This beer pours a very bright yellow color with a large, but quickly dissipating, head. The aroma is the same as a weiss/wheat beer. Very grainy nose. The flavor is that of a wheat beer with some added spices for a little extra flavor. If you're a fan of weiss beers, you should try this one."
"My favorite kristall weizen style I have had yet,loved the yellow/gold color with really nice rocky head.Smell was fruity and bread like(made me wanna jump in it)really refreshing.Taste light and refreshing with some citrus hints and light clove just really easy to drink.Awesome."
"Clear, mid yellow with an amber hue. Thick, half inch white head that stayed for the duration. Strong lacing throughout. Very light fruity smell with a hint of spice. The taste was fruity with a definite clove sense that grew stronger. Very smooth and creamy texture that imparted a peppery bite after the cloves. Attractive packaging in amber glass."
"This beer had a great fluffy and rocky head for a krystal. The color was a straw clear yellow. Nose was light and a little on the sweet side. The taste was nice and clean with some sweet wheaty flavor and mild floral backround. Very light and refreshing to the palate but had a good body for this style of beer. Every masss produced American beer could learn a lesson that a beer this light can have good delicate flavors and a richer mouth feel, not a watered down flavor. I could drink this all day long in the summer and dead of winter for that matter."
"clear darker gold color, with a few very large flakes floating around. huge foamy head that stays. ample carbonation produces lots of foamy lace too. clean aroma of wheat malt and yeast. tastes of very clean wheat malt flavors, with the slight obligatory cloves and slight fruit. a little higher hop bitterness than regular hefe's. very easy drinking, making for high drinkability. i'm in the camp that likes their wheat brews thick and rich with lots of creamy smoothness. these krystal brews seem like the ""light"" beers of the wheat style. very good anyway!"
"M first stab at this style...seems like a dumbed down Hefe with less flavor..decent banana nose with some cloves...pours gold...pretty clear...nice foamy white lace that rims the glass...medium bodied with medium carbonation...not as jazzed up as some Hefe's..taste is banana mainly with a real clean, crisp finish....almost lagerish...(maybe it is, I'm not real versed on this style)...decent, but doesn't pack enough punch in the flavor department for my liking...I like it, but prefer a good Hefe...."
"This beer poured a golden color and formed a nice huge sudsy white head that left some lace as it subsided.  A bit of carbonation present.  The aroma was of banana and clove.  The flavor was of malt and some spice.  The finish was a little bready yet sprite due in part to the carbonation.  An interesting twist on the wheat beer style. I rather like it."
"I dig this style because it removes the heavy, sickening yeast flavour form a perfectly good wheat beer.  Try this out even if you do not like wheat brew, it just may change your mind.  Cheers!"
"I like the hefe's a little better than the kristal versions. The appearance is very nice, yellow to golden color. The head was huge, bad pour maybe. Tasted nice enough, I had it both on tap and bottle. The bottle has a little more of the stale, sour taste to it. The tap version was fresher, refreshing, highly carbonated, but good. Decent yeast flavors. some hops to finish. It's the only non-macro carried at the place I had it, so I will definitly have it again."
"Pillowy head, maintains an inch for minutes.  A clear darker yellow, slight clove/ester sweet aroma.  Very sweet malt flavors deep without being full-bodied.  A little like candy corn candy at Halloween.  A touch of hop at the back.  Not complex.  A couple of off tastes but the bottle was a good deal past its date mark (9/01)...devoid of annoying acidity but definitely sweet.  I give a high drinkability mark and would like to try on tap."
"Golden clean look with an airy white head.  Musty malt smell.  Light taste with hints of malt and yeast. It is refreshing, and would be great in warm weather.  But does not overly impress me ..."
"Notes: We could see drinking a lot of this with some messy bbq and dirty rice with beans. A well crafted brew ... pleasing to almost any beer drinkers palate."
"This wheat blew me away (although it didn't hurt that the bar knew how to serve it - in a tall glass bearing the brewery's name with a round slice of lemon floating on top).  Fresh bread aroma.  Smooooooth and easy to drink.  (Almost a little too easy)."
