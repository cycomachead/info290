3.66,3.1,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Bottle pictured here poured into a weizen glass. A pale yellow amber with copious quick-breaking white bubbles. Aroma is the expected banana and clove elements, albeit much dialed down compared to unfiltered exemplars of the style. Nice old world wheat malt undercurrent. Flavor is similarly subtle yet reasonably complex, neutered clove pervades the proceedings but is trumped by sparkling pineapple, orange, and bubble gum notes. A pleasant dry wheat spiciness lurks in the background along with a light caramel sweetness. Light bodied and super fizzy. Well-crafted but leaves me wanting the full meal deal. There is really no need to filter this style and the relative lack of yeast character looms too large to ignore.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 04, 2014"

Harmonious ending, a little dry. Definitely a top notch weissbier extremely well balanced and still off the beaten path. Really liked this beer.","FLima","Sep 12, 2012"

It's just too polished - it's a bit unidimensional, and the flavors lack depth and are presented in a too orderly fashion. For someone who thinks a hefeweizen is too powerful, this one might be recommended though, since it's basically a "hefe light".","ricke","Jul 24, 2008"

3.5,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste of wheat, with typical fenolic yeast profile, ripe bananas. I did not taste a lot of clove though. Unlike any other Weizen, this has a slight bitterness, which fits this beer. The sweetness in the smell is not in the taste, the beer is rather dry and has a fenolic aftertaste. I miss the extra taste that the yeast normally adds to a weizen, it seems to always add an extra taste and mouthfeel.","Absumaster","Sep 23, 2004"
3.62,2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"500 ml bottle, at Cardinal, Stavanger. ABV is 5.2%. Pale yellow colour, crystal clear like the name says. Large to moderate head. Typical weissbier aroma, fruity with bananas and cloves, but the the aroma is not as strong as youll get from a hefe-w. Crisp and spritzy mouthfeel. Moderate cloves and tolerable hops in the flavour, but boring compared to the hefe. Why filter away the goodies? Short aftertaste.","Sigmund","Apr 23, 2004"
4.8,35.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"With this beer I would have to rate it as one of the top weizen I have tasted, the filtering suprisingly had no effect besides the fact that it was easier to pour. The look was a cloudy golden color with a strong bannana aroma but not overpowering to turn you away. The taste was bursting with different flavors with bannana barely noticeable. One thing you will notice is that, atleast in my opinion weizen beers feel the best in your mouth and going down your taste pallat with this particular selection being no different. With only one downfall to drinking weizen beers I would recomend this on highly for a strong wheat beer taste. OH ya that downfall is you get extremely bloated if you have more than three or four of these or any weizen beer so be prepared to have other beers in the fridge and remember you better pick something that you really like because as you will learn in wine tasting you start with the low quality and only work up so please don't torcher your taste buds after this fine german wheat beer.","paulaner","Beers"
3.75,5.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A foamy head fades into a fine white collar on an almost transparent yellow golden body. The smell shows wheat and some roasted malts with light hints of caramel. The taste is of wheat, slightly citric, iodated, and I thought it lacked a sweeter note. The mouthfeel is very round and ends in a dry way. Theres an impression of banana and grapefruit mixed together, but more with the citrus of the grapefruit than with the sweetness of the banana. Hops are faintly noticeable, but they contribute to the dryness of the finish in a decent (but not great) manner. Its still a quite drinkable brew, but it seems that it could be improved easily.","tjd25","0"
