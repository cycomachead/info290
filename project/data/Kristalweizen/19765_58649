3.99,2.3,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a light, clear straw amber with a fine half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, wheat, light lemon and a hint of banana. Flavor is wheat, mild biscuit malt, light lemon and banana with a biscuit wheat finish. Starts slightly sweet, finishes semi-dry. Light bodied, but peppery carbonation creates a pleasant mouth feel. A nice weizen style beer that's great to have fresh from a brewery. I lean more towards unfiltered wheat beers, but this has lots of wheat flavor and nicely subtle citrus and fruit flavors. Flavor is a bit on the light side, but a refreshing light wheat beer I will revisit again.","LiquidAmber","Jan 29, 2014"
