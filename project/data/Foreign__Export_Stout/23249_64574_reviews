"O: Really good. The first thing from this brewery I've enjoyed."
""
"Pour pitch black with a nice tall tan head. Aroma is coffee, roasted nuts and trace of chocolat. Taste is a super. Medium sweetness and bitterness. Full body, creamy and average carbonisation. Long sweet, bitter and coffee finish."
"O: Stunning beer, full of flavour."
""
"Slow sipper."

"Excellent Foreign Stout, bold and tasty. Truly balanced with just enough bells and whistles to be great, no pointless exaggeration. I would not change one thing. Definitely one of the best stouts I have tasted."
""
"Tasty, roasty and interesting. The flavours are well integrated overall, making it seem like a more intentional beer. Despite the aggression that's present it all still seems coherent."
""
"O: It smelled great, but there was a gross bit of slime (I do not believe it to be dregs or anything related to bottle conditioning, but I could always be wrong) on the inside of the bottle cap and inside the lip and neck of the bottle. There was some normal settlement on the bottom of the bottle like one would normally expect for a bottle conditioned export stout that was four months old."
""
"Overall, a very good stout. Straightforward, nothing unusual, just very high quality."
""
""
"Different and pleasant, good depth of body which hid the alcohol content well. Most likely the best Kernel I've had so far (I like malty brews, not citrus based washing up liquid type golden beers)."
""
"A bit pricey, but pick up this beer or anything from the Kernel. It's a treat and well worth it."

"O: If only this was indeed exported... delicious & well made, one of the better stouts I've had recently"
""
"Foreign/Export Stout it claims to be and it sure as damn well is. Very nicely done and a joy to drink."

"OVERALL : One of the best stouts I've had the utmost pleasure of tasting. I've been a huge fan of this beer for a few years now and no matter what the price, I always try to get another case of 24 before the one I currently have is spent. It's one of those beers I'll always be faithful to, falling back to it on hard days when I feel I definitely need a treat for myself. I treasure what I have since I can't have it regularly nor cheaply. This is some seriously awesome beer."

"Picked this up at The Kernel Brewery while on vacation in London. Pitch black pour with a nice two finger beige head with great retention and lacing. The nose is earthy and roasty with lots of coffee and dark chocolate along with hints of leather, cocoa, and nuts. The taste rich and flavorful with loads of roasty coffee and bitter chocolate along with hints of tobacco, cocoa, leather, and some subtle dark fruit and hops. The mouthfeel is thick, oily, and slightly chewy with a bit more carbonation than I had expected. The finish is dry, bitter, and mouth-coating. Overall, another stellar offering from The Kernel."

"Black with a thin, light brown head that leaves a good amount on the glass. Smell is chocolate, coffee, and roasted grain. Taste is mildly bitter and heavy on the coffee with a dry, almost piney finish. Feel is fairly heavy and sticky, with a medium carbonation. Overall, this is very enjoyable. Definitely my favorite of their beers so far and one of the best export stouts I've had."

"Overall !! Sublime a perfect addition to the kernel range and does not disappoint, Imperial brown stout may have a slight edge over this in taste wise but this is as close as you'll get to a near perfect stout. Find it ,drink it , live it, love it."

"Bottle (Hivernale): Poured a deep black color stout with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of nice floral coffee notes with some dark chocolate is very enticing. Taste is dominated by some very nice floral coffee notes with very little bitter chocolate and almost no astringency which is surprising considering the amount of coffee notes that are discernable. Light smokey notes are also perceptible though dark fruits notes are not really detectable as per brewer’s notes. Body is about average with good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. I very much enjoyed this beer and definitely makes me want to try some of their other beers."

"Impressive - a fantastic stout. Like running into a wall of roasted malt and coffee flavours. Great if you love dark beers. The only minor complaint I have is that the mouthfeel seemed a little thin to match the flavour; a more unctuous sensation would have gone down well. Trivialities aside, this is excellent and should be consumed if you have the opportunity."
""
"O : Aroma promises more than flavour delivers, Nice example for the style !"
"Overall: Good but fell a bit short of a great stout. Also, i don't see the potential for aging so of you've got it, drink it fresh."
"Overall a decent stout. The price is very high though so I wouldn't get it again."
"A very decent export stout to tease your taste buds - hats off to the Kernel boys once again!"
""
"Overall - A beautifully balanced stout from Kernel... highly recommended..."
""
"OVERALL: Excellent stuff. Had never even heard of this brewery before the 2011 BOREFTS Festival at De Molen, but glad I decided to get a couple of bottles to bring home with me. Bold, full flavored and very enjoyable stuff. Well worth checking out if you get the chance, and I’ll be looking to try more beers from this brewery. Recommended."
"Overall: Great stout, easy drinking for the abv and moreish with the coffee and chocolate notes balance well."
"O/D - Nice stout. Very nice stout. Very tasty stuff and I could have quite a few of these over the course of a night without a problem. I would seek this out for a try."
"Beer is oddly smooth with a dry finish and a lot of bitterness. The beer overall is quite drinkable but a little thin in the body. It has a late sweetness that is a little odd, almost a tobacco like flavor. Interesting, definitely a pleasurable beer."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this stout. The people at Kernel are making some excellent brews."
"M&D: pretty soft, lightly carbonated, and the palate is really light for a 7.8%abv. strong stout. I find this an extremely quaffable and well-made stout, though there's nothing in the bottle that truly ""hooks"" my palate to this ale."
"D. Very nice for almost 8%. A balanced export stout with a ton of flavor. Worth a shot!"
