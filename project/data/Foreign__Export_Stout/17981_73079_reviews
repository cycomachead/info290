"Rich, malty and roast goodness. Dangerously drinkable in my opinion. I get more coffee than chocolate on this beer but the Chocolate & Vanilla cask version was quite nice, as well."

"On draft at Gainesville House of Beer. Pours jet black with creamy mocha head. Very creamy mouthfeel, wow this is beautiful. Sweet sugary chocolate/lactose on the aroma. This is so creamy it feels and tastes like I'm drinking super rich chocolate milk with just a a bit of coffee bitter to balance. Pretty sweet, but very solid and lots of flavor that bursts on the palate. Really wish I would have had a chance to try Check It and See."

"Overall it was a nice medium bodied dry roasted beer. Would I drink it again? I probably would if there wasn't anything on tap that I haven't had before."
"Had th is at the taste of west shore event in Tampa. Best part was that is was free!"

"O - Pretty good beer. I liked it enough to bring a growler back to share. Don't drink a ton of these style of beer, but it's a nice experience to have every once in a while."

"O - Another solid brew from CCB. I'm a fan of this style to begin with, so I have no complaints about this beer at all. Great balance, enjoyable, and a glass or two won't destroy you."
"D - Good stuff. An enjoyable take on a style that doesn't get a ton of attention in the US. I'd gladly order this if it were on-tap in Florida, and I enjoyed it significantly more than Puppy's Breath Porter."

"O-This is definitely worth a shot, though CCB does brew better stouts. Still, I enjoyed this one from top to bottom."

"Smells rich and malty. Nce bitter roast on the nose and the tongue. A touch thinner than I'd like but very nice roast profile. This one is veery tasty. The carbonation is a bit high and the mouthfeel a bit weak but overall a solid beer and a great representation of the style"

"Pours a dark black color with a thick mocha three finger head that sticks around for a while, crazy head retention. Aroma of strong roasted malts, coffee, bitterness from the hops sweetness from the malts and licorice in the back. Taste follows the nose just intensified. Slightly dry but not dry stout level. Moderate mouthfeel. This is a great middle of the road stout."
"Overall, great beer, but I feel this is another soured beer from Cigar City. Shame."
"O: To be honest one could take my review as a little bias because Cigar City is by far my favorite brewery. They consistently deliver choices within styles to meet anyone's taste buds. This is a perfect desert beer. I would compare it to Rogue's Chocolate Stout (which is one of the world's best) but I can enjoy Hot Blooded to the fullest extent because it is lighter, more like a bit size candy bar compared to a whole birthday cake. Love the beer, love the brewery!"
"I had this at the Kickbacks Cigar City/St Somewhere dinner. I'm reviewing this by memory on this I had this at the Kickbacks Cigar City/St Somewhere dinner. I have had most of CC's regular beers but I have not tried this yet. nice stout, I liek this better than patio o tools. more body, richer. would drink this again."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. This would be great on a cold winter evening."
"overall, Very very nice.. Cigar city never disappoints. Cant wait to have another."
"Overall: The drinkability is nice. The different flavors blend well."
"D - Nicely done, very drinkable and complex."
