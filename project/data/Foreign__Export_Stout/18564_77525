4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Conclusion: A very good dark beer. I have always liked this style, but often found American versions to be uninspired. I personally think the Guiness Foreign Extra to be an outstanding beer and the benchmark for the style, and although this is beer isn't quite at that level, it is doing its own thing and doing it well. Worth being proud of for Upslope. I could drink this regularly.","allforbetterbeer","Feb 03, 2015"

This is paired with chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of creaminess. The taste is fruit forward again with notes of raisin dominating. This gives way to a tangy metallic character that isn't working for me. Some roast appears up front but is ultimately drowned out by fruit and metallic notes. Mouthfeel is light for style with appropriate level of carbonation. Overall, this one just isn't working for me.","homebrew311","Mar 07, 2014"

I dislike when I hear people say, "Oh, I don't like dark beer" because color generally has little to do with it, but cases like this one hearten me. It finally settled into a dense cap of two fingers of deep-tan head that sat atop the beer like a muffin top. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled of dark chocolate, smoky burnt wood, dried dark fruit, charcoal and molasses. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching a fullness on the tongue. The taste was initially very smoky before the dark chocolate broke through. Lacing had already begun to form in the glass. The finish was semi-sweet, quite chocolaty, but with the smokiness lingering after the swallow. Hoo hah! My, but this was good! It was, for me, more of a dessert beer than something that I would put into my cooler. I am glad for the opportunity to have tried it in its limited release.","woodychandler","Jun 23, 2013"
