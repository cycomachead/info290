"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, slight cocoa, and a weird plastic smell. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and coffee grounds. There is a medium roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the plastic aroma I am getting from this one is odd."

"Overall: A solid Stout."
"D - Pretty good roasty stout that is kind of dry and sweet too. Almost like a cross between a milk stout and a dry Irish stout."
"O: All of the above."
"O: Simply painful and atrocious."
"This beer is a good example of what a stout should look like in a pint. Its a pitch black without any head stability which is a disappointment. There isn't a really good aroma from this brew which comes as a surprise. I get small hint of dark chocolate that's it. It leads me to be curious of the taste. It taste of black coffee and dark chocolate in the beginning and finish way to quickly like a Irish stout. Overall its a nice brew for such a commercial company like oggis."
"Average on everything else. This is a standard stout and I really don't desire another."
"This is a very good export stout that I think would be great if the bitterness was ramped down a touch. I do like the big sweet chocolate aroma as it's a bit different for a dry stout. Overall, very tasty."
"Good rich espresso flavors and character with a nice hop balance but something is missing; you want ""more"" of all of it. Lacks a bit of a body and lacks a ""richness"" in flavors and character. Very nice coffee/bitter hop long finish. Best part of beer is the finish which is very roasted grain, dark chocolate and espresso with plenty of hop finish character. Beer is just a bit thin and simple and ""lacking."" Just my opinion, as always."
"D: pretty drinkable. Best beer from Oggi's by far."
"Pours a black colored body, with a tan-brownish creamy colored head. Has a strong coffee and chocolate aroma. Strong coffee and toffee taste, with a coffee aftertaste. Not too shabby."
"Poured a dark brownish black with a thin foamy tan head. OK retention left nice coating of lacing down the glass with some oiliness as well. Smells of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, chalk, and some hops. Tastes of roasted malt, chocolate syrup, and a touch of burntness. Some coffee notes and a dash of woodsy hops with a little bit of chalkiness thrown in. Medium in body with pleasant carbonation, roasty with a nice bitterness in the finish, smooth but with a bit of mineral feel. Good stuff, easy to drink. Glad to see this stuff making its way to Pennsylvania."
"Poured a deep, deep brown with a nice brown head. Nose was coffee, cocoa and roasted malts. Taste was very good. It had a subtle but very good hersheys chocolate taste to go. Mouthfeel was nice and well balanced with coffee, cocoa. This brew was my favorite amongst the Oggis brews."
"Pours black with a tiny, oily ring of tan bubbles. Coffee, chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt in the nose. It was not a thin mouthfeel in general, but watery for the genre. More chocolate and coffee in the taste, with a little anise, caramel, cream, barley, and some oatiness and a little smoke. Good, not great."
"Sample at the Santa Clarita location. Pours black with a medium and creamy light tan head that diminishes steadily. Thin sheet of lacing on the glass. Coffee and chocolate in the nose with toasted malt in the background. Medium, smooth body with flavors of coffee, burnt malt and chocolate. The finish is bitter coffee with a bit of malt and dark chocolate aftertaste. Overall this is a passable Stout."
"Medium body, decent flavors but the bite is a bit much for me."
"Somewhat thin in the mouthfeel, but was pleasanty surprised."
"How it won some award once I'll never know."
"Coffee, toffee aromas go with the very dark brown liquid. Tastes like there might be some adjuncts to enhance the coffee flavor. Burnt toffee in there, too. A little dry but not particularly astringent. Low carbonation. Didn't notice any hops. Very clean finish with almost no aftertaste. Best Oggi's beer I've had."
"This is a lovely stout. Rich aroma full of coffee, roasted grains and hops. For me the coffee was in the foreground and the chocolate played second. However, when drinking, the chocolate stepped up and played nice with the coffee. Flavors were well balanced. Mouthfeel was creamy and full. Smooth. Drinkability was a bit to good. This was a good example of the style and an outstanding beer experience."
"Recommended if you are a stout fan, but does not go well with food and has a long dry aftertaste"
"coffee flavor went on long into the finish."
"Opaque in appearance with a small head, this brew had a little more fruit/alcohol flavor to it than your typical stout. Cocoa, molasses, fruit, and bitter roasted malts make up the flavor. Not the most drinkable beer around, but more complex than the amber ale I had earlier, which keeps you coming back to your glass for another sip."
"On tap at Oggi's Corona, CA location. Pitch black body with off white head. Taste had some chocolate with some deep coffee flavor hiding in the back too, but the dominant taste was something I couldn't put my finger on here, but was very distinct. I want to say it was sort of like a black licorice, or some other sort of candy flavor you have when you're a kid and you avoid eating them the rest of the time because it's a strange (although not bad) flavor. I didn't like the quantity that this flavor came in... if they dialed it down a notch and brought up the other flavors a bit I would like this stout much more."
"I got this in a Growler BIF and even after all of the traveling this jug it still was able to put a mocha colored head on top of it's pitch black body in my glass. The head even stayed around for a couple minutes. This stout has a good roasted aroma with coffee and chocolate in the background. It has a creamy medium bodied feel and strong roasted flavors. There are also coffee and dark chocolate flavors there as well, but are not nearly as powerful as the roasted taste. It's a good example of a stout and I like it."
"On-tap at Carmel Country Road. Black with some mocha head, lots of lace. Bitter, high carbonation. Dinkable, but this seemed like a Guiness clone. Roasted body, with coffee, very dry. Coffee grounds. Malts get it done, but just an average beer and below average stout."
"This past Sunday I tried out a beer from Oggi's. There is one of these San Diego favorites right near my parent's house in Glendale and we have had pizza there many times for various birthday's. This time when picking up a couple of pies I popped over to the bar to try out one of their brews. I opted for the Black Magic stout, mostly because I hadn't had a stout in a while, and with the weather ""cooling off"" it feels like it is the season. The first thing I noticed is that appeared to be dispensed though a nitrogen tap, as the tap for this beer was different from the rest. The beer came with a very light head, because of this there wasn't much lacing or lasting head which I blame on the tap more than anything else. Light aroma of roasted malts with a hint of alcohol. Great mouthfeel, due mostly to the nitrogen. It was very drinkable, but with its relatively high alcohol content I wouldn't want to push it too far."
"Drinkable to a point."
"There is a very creamy mouthfeel to this beer, I am guessing that this has been dispensed via nitrogen. Rich flavors lean towards chocolate, with a roast character as a back drop (which is opposite of the aroma). The chocolate note almost has a milk chocolate leaning to it. I think the sweet maltiness accentuates the milk chocolate perception. There is a certain chalkiness here, which I have been associating as of late with roast grain notes. This is quite drinkable, almost light, despite its richness, and I think that the nitrogen tap has helped with this. The roast character adds a certain acidity to this beer as well, which seems to lighten things up a bit as well. This beer has been the best of the beers that I have had from the Scottsdale Oggi's; it is rich, flavorful, satisfying, yet still dangerously drinkable."
"I typically don't like ""chain"" brewpubs, but Oggi's is better than most and their best beer is as good as anyone's."
"This brew poured dark as midnight with a small head. Nose was wonderful, of coffee and chocolate. Taste was good, was a nice mix of chocolate malts and nicely balanced with a dry hop. Mouthfeel was OK but nothing outstanding and a bit thinner than the better stouts. Drinkability was good, it was very enjoyable and with not too high an ABV where one could enjoy several pints."
"Cheers!"
"Upon pour, the head dissipated fairly quickly. A rich, creamy, malty smell. Felt pretty good on the tongue. It was extremely full-bodied with a great roasted flavor. Very smooth and good. And there was virtually no aftertaste. An all-around good stout beer."
"Pours a deep dense black with tons of head. Lace is plentiful on my glass. Smells rich of burnt choclate, coffee, dark roasted malts. Flavor opens bitter and acidic, I can almost feel the enamel peeling away from my teeth. Well hopped is this stout. Burnt molases, dark chocolate, espresso and sweet brown sugar hit the taste buds. Mouthfeel is medium and very clean, finishes with a light chocolate syrup and moderate coating on the throat. This is the finest example of the style that I have encountered, extremely drinkable."
"This beer is dark, dark, dark in color with no light passing though the blackish brown beer. The head is a tan, sandy head that retained very well in the glass. The aroma is all dark malts and caramel malts with sweetness to lure you in. Bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and sour malty flavors dominate the taste. There is a touch of hop bitterness at the end. It is clean and not very sticky in the mouth which made it a very pleasant beer to enjoy with pizza."
"Drinkability: Overall very acceptable...now if it were only served above 40°"
"A very enjoayable brew. This one poured a dark black color with a good sized off white head that left great rings of lace down the glass. The smell was of coffee and had a hint of malt in there as well. The taste was smokey from start to finnish, with just a touch of burnt malt in the mix. This is a very drinkable stout due to it's porter like mouthfeel and smoothe flavor. I'd definantly order this gem again."
"The nice almost black body is topped by a creamy tan head. This is a little on the sweet side with a good amount of caramel in the flavor and a little roast. It's not too heavy, but to get that it's also a little thin. It's a fairly tasty stout but underwhelming compared to certain others."
"Dark black color. Aroma is mild malts, chocolate and coffee. A medium bodied stout. Malts are roasted, chocolate and coffee. A middle of the road stout. Nice, but not very interesting. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"I have had this Stout on several occasions at the Oggi's in Mission Viejo, California. As a general comment, as far a 'chain' brewpubs go, this is a decent stout. Overall, when compared to other micros, this is mediocre dry stout. If you're at Oggis, it's worth having as part of the sampler. BTW, look for coupons in the local paper. Frequently there are coupons for the samplers"
"Since my first taste of it at the San Diego Beer Fest 2001, I've said that's it's the best stout within San Diego city limits. I've taken several other stout drinkers there and they had also concluded it was an outstanding beer. Recommended."
"A nice smoky offering from Oggi's in Mission Viejo. The brew was quite black and opaque with a light tan head that laced very well. The nose and taste gave off a smoky roasted sense that was very pleasant to the palate. Chocolate predominates throughout the beer and is very nice with some light hints of coffee. It has a nice creamy mouthfeel. Nice beer; not great, but pleasant."
