4.18,11.2,4.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall: Aptly named dark stout. It has the strong chocolate and malt flavors of some big beers but without the high ABV. Got this in a trade so I'm not sure about the cost but I could easily drink more of this in one sitting. Pleasantly surprised with this one. Complexity you don't expect from a canned beer and very drinkable. Maybe my scores for this are a bit high due to the heavy stouts I've been tasting lately but I really liked this.","CLEmark","Mar 03, 2014"

Had a nice creamy rich mocha brown head, that left a solid layer with a little bit of cling. A fair amount of sediment was floating around the bottom. Smell was nicely sweet, lactose with a touch of smoke. Flavor starts with some roasty biter dark chocolate, then becomes a bit more bitter. A bit of acid that balanced out as it sat, but not quite as mellow as I would expect. Felt great in the mouth. Coated very well, pretty much as it should.

Smells of roast, cocoa, vanilla and weird hop presence that I guess is coming off like a kind of Noble hop? It definitely has spiciness to it. The taste is similar but does seem to do a little better, with a decent balance of roasted malts, a sweet combo of cocoa and vanilla and then a tingle of earthy and spicy citric hops. Dry and bitter on the finish with some lingering smoke. The feel is medium bodied with a crisp creaminess in the mouth that flows well. Just a smidge of warmth is present and this is overall pretty smooth. This was decent but the weirdness of the aroma kind of put a damper on things.

The aroma delivers a nice deep chocolate malt with hazelnut coffee and some vanilla and some light herbal hop edges. I think it smells terrific. The first taste offers a bit more coffee heavy flavors, roasted coffee, almost burned grounds with a somewhat sharp edge yet the mellow, deep malt holds it together nicely for something that invites the big gulp approach. There's some subtle seaweed sort of grass hop in the background that makes it interesting along with a charcoal finish. Perhaps more notable is the near full body and thick, silky feel accented with a bit of fine carbonation sparkle for some contrast. I don't know, this seems like a pretty damn good stout and one I could drink a few of easily when in a malt-bomb mood. It's interesting without being especially complex and delivers the nice dark punch I look for in a stout. I'm quite pleased by this nice stout to ride shotgun to my favorite IPA, Stowaway.

Then the crazy spicy earthy hops comes in like a "phantom punch"... oh I get it now... but still that astringent bitterness with quite spicy chewy hops don't go well at all, and make the beer more like an American Black Ale (aka Black IPA), which I don't like as those flavors clash so much.

4.03,7.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, opaque, blackish color with a deep ruby highlight around the edges when held up to the light. Frothy, foamy, light brown head that starts a solid inch and a half on the pour, but settles nicely into a surface coating after a minute or two. Loose, clingy lacing along the glass as you drink. Aromas are sweet and rich, with a vanilla undertone and cocoa nib highlight on a roasted coffee main character. Flavors of rich and bitter roast initially, with a touch of campfire and char, followed by the darkly bittersweet cocoa nib. The vanilla characteristics only peak their head out here and there, in an attempt to lighten the heavy bitter and roast characteristics, only to be slightly overpowered. Rich, roasty, and bitter aftertaste, with the cocoa lingering on a bit through the slick, clean, and slightly dry finish. Very smooth and light in mouth. The ABV helpss make this a very drinkable beer, and the heavy flavors surprisingly do not build on your palate, leaving you a reprieve between each sip to recover and prepare for the next. Tasty stout!","GarthDanielson","Dec 30, 2012"

Finely crafted. Its pretty awesome actually. WIth your purchase of $10 you are rewarded with a big, bad, brawny posse of six dark troublemakers. Hey Baxter, you just bought yourself a seat at the 'cool kids table' with this beer.","VelvetExtract","Dec 25, 2012"

Heavy on burnt flavors and missing (or just overpowered?) the complexity and nuances that I was looking for and hoping to find here. Overall, just an average offering for the style...not terrible, but won't send me out looking for more either.","portia99","Dec 20, 2012"

Smells of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and roast with hint of dark sugar and ash. This has a light earthy hop aroma. The malt aromas in this are huge for the style. The flavor is bitter roast and earthy hop with bits of chocolate and caramel and a hint of vanilla, ash, and smoke. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet roasty mouthfeel. I was surprised by this one its really quite good. The vanilla is subtle but it adds to the chocolate effect quite nicely.","johnnnniee","Dec 10, 2012"

It's nice to have a local, seasonal stout. I may not get more of this beer this season, but I can see myself getting some next year.
