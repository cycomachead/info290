"My first export stout and probably my first Australian brew... I love it."

"an australian classic, something about this one makes it work in a warm or cold weather context, perfect for australian climate, but also neat on this side of the pond, especially as spring tries to fight through winter here in february. huge milky frothy mocha head, lacy and airy on top of the dark brown hersheys colored brew. some bitterness going on in the nose and taste, a hint of grass, this has more hops than others, and that helps. it also seems to have as much of a brown ale malt base as it does a stout one. roast is there, but the cocoa malt thing is too. chocolate gives way to coffee in the finish, intense coffee, but there is no java in this brew from what i a aware of. the feel also is different for a stout, tons of bubbles and english yeast character. i think in some ways its the best of three different worlds, foreign stout, black ale, and english brown, all contributing equally. drinkable as anything, fairly priced, and quite different from others. one of the best coopers beers going."

"Has a strange after taste to me."

"Quite chocolaty very nice brew a fav"
"Deep chocolate brown not wanting to let any light through. Decent head dissipating quickly, leaving nice light tan lacing.  Light malty nose with hints of sugared coffee. Taste, to me, has a hint of licorice up front, followed by some bitter malt and roasted(almost burnt) coffee. Not bad, a little unbalanced, but overall, ok !"

"Overall: one of my favourite stouts. Well put together, very traditional style with a big, punchy flavour. Add to that a price of AU$58 a case of 24 x 375mL, and this is also one of the best value stouts around, along with CUB's Sheaf Stout."

"Not fizzy! That is what did it for me and a definite coffee lover's brew"

"A dark beer with a coffee with cream colored head.  I could tastse roasted malts and coffee, with some dark chocolate."

"Deep reddish-brown color. A nice burnt-caramel flavor, and surprisingly refreshing for a stout. Not too heavy. This one was great - I really like this beer!"

"Solid drop, although that's to be expected from the Coopers Family. Have spent many a day drinking their pale and sparkling ale and somehow had never sampled their stout. From a 750ml longneck into a pint glass. Best after 20 April 2014.  A: Looks a solid black with a nice dark coffee head. S: Smells a nice bitter chocolate, with a little vanilla and coffee too. T: like it smells...chocolate, fudge and some coffee bitterness. Overall a solid stout that id be happy to drink any day. Not a complex example of the style, but a great go-to for a daily drop...keep a couple, or a case, in the fridge and you've got guaranteed satisfaction if you're yearning for something dark. Certainly give it a go."

"O: Export stouts aren't usually my thing, but this was pretty good."
""
""
""
""
"This is a really cracking good beer. My first beer tried from Australia, and I'd like to buy a ton more of it please."
""
""
""
""

"O: Easily the best mass-produced beer in Australia."
""
""

"O: A nice beer, it has all the caracteristics of the style, but nothing that really stands out for me."
""
"Overall a very classic stout. The feel isn't as smooth as I would like but overall this is a very solid option and I will definitely seek this out again."
"Poured from a brown 12.7 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, some sweetness, molasses like. Taste is roasted malts, a bit of chocolate, somewhat light and mild, some smokiness as well. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Poured from a bottle into an English pub glass. Nearly pitch black with the odd red flash glimmering here and there, with a wholesome milkshake-like tan head. Aroma includes roasted barley, rich milk chocolate, cold coffee, and a whiff of smoke. Palate reflects all these elements as well, along with a tannic red wine fruitiness that is rather interesting in a stout. Bittersweet, with carob and butterscotch diacetyl, raisins or dried currants, and blonde roast coffee flitting in and out of awareness, something different with each sip. Smooth and creamy body, semi-thick (certainly more so than an Irish dry stout), with an earthy dry tea-bag finish that also hits a few wood char and chocolate milk notes on the way out. Plenty tasty and I'd make this a go-to stout if it was easier to find in these parts. I like the juxtaposition of sweet dark malts and tannic fruity/bitter almost Burton-esque flavors. Its not a super heavy hitter, looking considerably darker than it tastes if that makes sense, but features more character than some of its better known mass-produced counterparts from Ireland."
"My enjoyment of sweet, sleek, malty Export Stouts cannot be measured by modern science, but take the score posted above as proof that I really like 'em. Coopers Best Extra Stout is definitely one of the best examples of the style and, as a relatively light and approachable beer with strong and substantial personality, is an easy thing to recommend to all drinkers."

"Solid offering, just lacking that final push."
""
""

"A beer I've wanted to try for ages, a bit thinner than other stouts, but this increases its appeal to me - i could definitely fit a few of these in one go. nice roasted cocoa taste is a plus as well. give it a go!"
""
""
""
""
""

"O - 4 - I'm really surprised in a good way by this beer. Being a big fan of imperial stouts I have a hard time finding examples with a lower ABV and gravity that are just as satisfying. This one is. It will stay in my rotation for a while."

"Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a small brown head. Smells of berries and fruit with slight coffee. Tastes of slight coffee with sour fruit, intersting combination that is pretty good. Beer is carbonated heavily Andy goes down really easy for its medium body. Overall a pretty good beer."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and slight char-like aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and char flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with some nice aromas but the flavors come off as a bit too acrid and burnt for my liking."

"Excellent Foreign Stout. Far from boring and still very drinkable. In my opinion, better than the regular Guinness."

"O: Very enjoyable drinker. Good example of what a stout should be. Worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The body's big enough to keep everything together, but with a bit too much of a sharp bite to it. Smoothness is present but generally somewhat on the lower side. There is a good heft to it, though."

"* Oh, and if you can't guess I'm watching Robocop as I write this!"

"Pleasant without being overly strong or in your face despite the relatively high abv. It was very easy to drink, almost a little too easy and would make a good, if a little strong, session ale."
""
""
""

"Coopers Best Extra Stout has a nice malty aroma and a lovely hoppy dry finish. I didn't have big expectations here, but I am impressed with this offering. I would like to try this not only on tap, but nitro. I bet that would mellow out the bubbles a lot. Anyway, I am impressed. Sad to see Coopers go, but there are a LOT of other beers out there for us to try!"

"O- Weird beer that seems to attempt to be a Guinness. It fails."
""
""
""
""
"Definition problem here. Bottle nose has moderate well balanced roastiness and sweetness and it pour a reasonable but short lived big rocky tan head. Glossy black to the eye it has reasonable depth with an effervescent start on the palate which leads to a fairly hollow middle. Thin, not watery, but is in need of more content and individuality."

"This beer makes want to kiss an Aussie, babe that is! Anyway, poured out a dark, pitch black, color and is topped off with a nice thick tan head that simply screams,” I can’t get sunburned in Somalia!” The head gently thins out into a layer of bubbles and a layer of thick creamy lacing. It smells like a dry scotch, with only a hint of butter, mild dark fruits and some raisins. Bitter at first, it spreads out to coat your mouth a with medium-to-light mouth feel. The roasted malts are very alive and they are very pronounced in this beer. The aftertaste is quit tame and only a hint of citrus zest and alcohol is present."
""
""
""
""
""
"For a bottle carbonated stoutIt feels reasonably thick and full bodied in the mouth."
""
""
"Overall, blown away. The Aussies make an exceptional stout here. Totally dominated by a milk chocolate tone, it's just delicious and ""feels"" perfect. I could almost give this a perfect score, mate."
""
"There are aromas of roasted barley malt, sweet milk chocolate, and faint hints of coffee and alcohol. You get roasted malts and that milk chocolate flavor right up front. There is that coffee type bitterness on the back end and the alcohol is not very detectable in the flavor. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and the drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent stout. It covers all what you expect from a stout."
"Overall - A unique stout by Coopers. This is my first foreign/export stout and I'm quite surprised by the intensity of flavours. Tastes more potent than the ABV suggests. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Considering this is ranked so high on the top Oz beers, this is pretty weak. In no way is this even comparable to a number of the craft examples here. This is in no way a bad beer, just not a hype worthy one, and not necessarily a good one. I wish I just had a small bottle. Decent, but not worth going out of your way for. I had no interest in finishing the bottle."
"O: Probably the best beer I have had from Coopers, though none of them are bad beers. Very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. I would certainly get this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12.7 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark brown pour with a small tan head. This tastes like every foreign stout I've ever had. Sweet lactose creamy aroma with a decidedly roasty flavor profile, plenty of dark bread crusts, a whisper of fruitiness, and a dry finish. A perfectly adequate stout but not something I would care to have again, if only because of its genericness."
""
""
"Overall a touch old but this is forgiven since it came from around the world. A really good stout overall."

"overall, a surprisingly decent beer. i wasnt expecting much, a friend found these in the back of his fridge and knew i liked beer. not something i would ever really buy, but atleast the other 5 wont be too hard to drink."

"Good stuff."

"O: This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. It just has so much flavor and just so perfect for winter. I cant wait to have this again!"
"O - Solid export stout. Not heavy by any means but full flavoured and well balanced. Really nice profile."
"Overall: A very nice export stout. Good flavors, rich and full. Keeping a few of these on hand is not a bad idea."
"This pours a mostly black color but its not as thick as and imperial stout and doesn't have that motor oil effect. The body was also very yeast / sediment filled hazy with an okay mocha head which quickly dissipated. The feel was medium, a little light for a stout. The smell was of roasted malts and coco. The taste was a little of the same, it wasn't very aggressive, there was the coco, some molasses and a little roasted malts but not enough to give a very bitter after flavor, there was also this unusual earthy taste. Overall a decent stout but nothing memorable enough to go out and buy again."
"A nice brew , malty aroma, sweet for an export stout. Head is thin to non existant, but lightly laces glass.Chocolaty brown color. Roasted grain and slight hop. Think of a Guinness thats gone slightly flat! Lingers on the back of the toung nicely.Overall a decent beer."
"overall; this beer is awesome, nearly flawless to me but I would like to try more of the style."
"Bottom line: Roll this one around before pouring. The lees really improved it."
"Overall this is an above average stout that I recommend to a lot of people since it is one of the few good ones available in Brazil. I like how roasty it is and the use of hops to mellow the tartness."
"O: I really liked the aroma on this brew -- complex and well-rounded. I would pick this one up again on occasion."
"Food match: Rich and hearty stews would work well. Anything that you would call ""rustic"" or ""peasant"" food would go down well with this drop, huzzah!"
"Overall: Bolder and even sweeter than many milk stouts, and a LOT sweeter than dry stout. It makes a great dessert beer, and I could see myself drinking it again."
"O- i was torn between a 4.5 and a 4. but i thought that i was a little bias and so gave it a 4 only, also that was the most common out of the previous 4 scores. i love this beer, and to think about it critically has made m like it more if anything. great nose, body and look. but the taste is fantastic! easily one of the 4 best stouts in Australia and one of the best priced beers considering the quality."
"12.7 oz brown bottle purchased at McKinnon's. Pours an opaque black body with a thin khaki-colored head. Milk chocolate dominates the aroma with some espresso and nut notes. Dark chocolate and coffee dominate the flavor, with caramel sweetness playing a nice supporting role and some biscuity flavor too. Medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Every bit as good as I remember it being years ago. Glad I picked this one up again."
"Not so sure I am with the majority here in terms of a 'classic Aussie Ale' ..."
"Pours very nicely with a thick, light tan head. Breaks up very quickly. Attractive chocolate brown in colour. Aromas are a touch underwhelming; mild chocolate and dry roasted malts. Good length. Fairly fizzy palate for the style and probably subdues the flavours from really hitting their straps. Again what should be obvious stout characters of chcoloate and roast is mild. Not really deserved of its top 5 Oz status. Given this beer was drank relatively young I can only assume in needs a little time to show its best."
"A solid brew and a pleasant evening sipper. Nothing out of the ordinary, but everything seems to be put together properly. A stout you can order with security knowing you won't be disappointed. Great work."
"O: Would have another."
"A great stout."
"D - A top quality stout from coopers, and well worth a try"
"Drinkability: All in all, a very nice example of the style and easily my favorite from this brewery"
"This beer will be in my fridge again in the future."
"Overall a nicely done brew yet kept in check by a limited depth of character overall. Quite pleasant though restrained a bit. Interestingly this bottle offers a 'Best After' date, but I couldn't read it. Flavor expands some with warming, adding some hop notes on the nose."
"It's like reclining in my favorite, well-worn, comfy couch - I could just sit here all night."
"Rather bold stout but still very good drinkable, definitely worth a try."
"OVERALL: A very nice example of an export stout. This is one of the better brews in its style, though the relatively average look and feel kept it back in the ratings a bit. If you're a fan of export stouts, you can't go wrong here. Recommended."
"Drinkability is alright, cheap and good quality but i dont think id have any more than 750 mls in one session."
"Sampled out of 375mL bottle at Alex's grandma's house (did the strawberry tablecloth give it away?). Label reads, ""Best After 10/7/08"" so I'm very excited to see how it has aged. Pours very dark, almost pitch black color, and didn't bother decanting out the sediment. Produces a thick, rocky, mocha-colored head with lacing that clings in clusters down the glass. Sediment sits on top like powered hot chocolate. Nose of roasted coffee, some smokey hints. Palate is nutty, mostly hazelnut, with the smokey aftertaste much more pronounced. Lots of bittersweet chocolate, coffee grounds linger along with the slight warmth from the 6.3% ABV (maybe even higher after bottle-conditioning + aging.) Very rich brew, medium body and drinkable with slight dryness in the finish. DELICIOUS."
"It does have a slightly boozy ""feel"" to it so I reckon 1 at a sitting would be otimal for me."
"A decent strong stout - the booze is well integrated, the fruitiness fairly interesting, and the bottle-conditioned effervescence adds an interesting contrast to the creamy dessert core of this offering. Worthy of seeking out, as an alternative to that worldly Irish export of the same creed."
"A big gulp reveals strong coffee flavor, with a background of dark roasted malts. Medium hop presence, with a little kick in the swallow but little lingering bitterness. Well rounded taste overall, a stout of good measure."
"Drinkability - I have had better Stouts, but this is not bad at all. This would be nice on those real cold Winter days and evenings. I could have a few of these, but not too many. It is warming, which is a plus, but could probably only handle this for one evening. The flavors are not as balanced as I would like."
"Drinkability: This was a nicely drinkable beer, both easy to drink and to finish. I'd certainly be willing to have it again. One nice thing, or perhaps dangerous thing, about this beer is that it is quite easy to keep drinking it and to regret pouring the last drop. A good solid well made beer and one worth having."
"Drink - so far I have been really impressed with the beers from Coopers. This is a beer I would be happy to stock and will seek it out again. Worth seeking out if you like stouts."
"I will admit I enjoyed this much more then I though I would, perhaps I need to take another look at this brewery"
"Drinkability is good. I wish the body is a little more heavier, otherwise it's pretty good stout."
"At the moment I'm not sure what the abv is here. This would be a real winner if available in six-packs at a nice Sierra Nevada price point. The face it is I can't remember how much this single cost me, but likely more than $2. Anyhow, this is a good one if run across."
"This is a very decent stout, and one of the better ones that is readily available here in Oz. If it lacks the depth and complexity of the best examples it can perhaps be forgiven. It's a pretty decent brew all up."
"good drinkability."
"The quintessential Australian stout, this beer has a delicater aroma, nice frothy head, great dark roasted color, and is smoothe. Leaves a bit more stronger aftertaste in your mouth than other stouts tend to, but this is a fine beer, and is still good lukewarm."
"D: This is a flavorful beer that is very easy to drink. I definitely want to try another one of these in the future."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Completely inoffensive beer."
"Final Notes: This is a beer I'd have with a hearty meal of either barbecue or spicy food. Also nice and warming to have out by the campire or in front of the fireplace on a cold day. An all-around good beer."
"Upon tasting this Extra Stout it is rather light with a lot of roasty flavors swirling around. A bit of nuttyness comes through and finishes with a bit of dark coffee. I would certainly recommend this beer to anybody that enjoys a dark beer, and even to those who do not. It is even drinkable during these warm days."
"Pours a deep dark black with brown particles floating throughout, no head and no lacing. Scent is of chocolate, dark roasted grain, nuts, earth, char, some brown sugar and a noticable scent of alcohol. Taste brings a quick taste of earth, char and dark roasted grains, followed by a muddled punch of dark fruit and alcohol. Some touches of carmel and brown sugar on the rear. Medium bodied, dry and somewhat astringment finish. A decent, bolder style stout with some unpleasent flavors that cloud it a touch."
"Coopers Best Extra Stout pours a deep inky black with a thin head that doesn't last long. The aroma is rich sweet chocolate and dark fruit. Sweet, caramel malt and chocolate come first in the flavor, leading to some mild astringency and damp, earthy hop flavor. Roasted malt comes through in the finish, leaving a nice coffee flavor. The bitterness is mild and coupled with the astringency from the roasted malt balances the flavor well."
"This turned out to be a very nice FES, with a whole boatload of roasted malt flavour. Nice job from Coopers."
"D - A pleasant generic stout. Good with hearty foods and cold nights. I want to rate this higher, but it's just average."
"d- nice, I could drink 4 of this with no problem"
"I love stout. Good stout. And we have one here. Black in color with a little ruby coming through. Bottle conditioned so lots of yeast. I love that. Smells like beer heaven. Dark malts and English ale yeastyish. Ahh. The taste is even better. The went as far as you can go with the malt without going to far. Perfect hop balance. Good full body. I don't care what anyone says this Ausie brew is up there with the great stouts of Ireland and England. Two thumbs up and a circle snap."
"D: Tasty and smooth. Very flavorful."
"From the 12.7 fl. oz. bottle marked 30 APR 09-08:12. Ssmpled in May 10, 2010. It pours a midnight brown with a brown silky head about an inch thick that simmers down to a thin ring. The aroma has a pleasant crispness to it along with light chocolate malts and thin hops. Subtle would be the best word to describe it. The mouthfeel comes in at about medium. There's an appealing bitterness quality to the taste with a tart hoppy ending. Not bad at all."
"Being in a (Thai) land of macro lagers, it is imminently drinkable, and a welcome find. Pretty well to style. A good but not amazing beer."
"Pours a dark brown with deep garnet highlights and a good sized tan head that dissipates slowly and throws some lace. Smells of coffee and chocolate and molasses and dark dried fruits. Taste is very roasty with hints of chocolate, figs, molasses, dark fruit, and an annoying mineral or metallic flavor that while not overwhelming distracts me a bit. Creamy grainy mouthfeel, medium to thick body, moderate level of carbonation. I almost enjoyed this one, well I did drink it all. The mineral flavor kinda killed this one for me. These just became available in NH and this bottle is a year old."
"D - the bitterness in the after taste hurts the drinkability, but you can enjoy a few at one time."
"Pours an opaque coffee brown with a nice, thick, fairly persistent tan head - couldn't look more appetizing. Aroma is rich, smoky, oily, having tones of molasses and miso. Flavor is smoky and has tones of quality roast coffee and brown sugar. Texture is tingly and fizzy, sometimes seeming just a mite watery but still good. Worthy."
"Would definitely try this again."
"D: A nice Stout. A bit of everything. This won't make you dissapointed."
"O: Good drinkability. Nice stout"
"D- Hadnt had this one in a long time and forgot how much I liked it. Could easily have several of these in a sitting. I was suprised that more of the sweetness didnt come through in the taste."
"Pours an opaque jet black with about a finger of tan foamy head that lingers awhile. The nose is weak, with light hints of coffee, chocolate, and dark malts darting through the spaces betwixt the air itself. The taste follows, with the coffee, malts, subtle bits o' cocoa, and twinge of bitterness all coming in, but sadly seeming somewhat watered-down, all of the flavors perceptibly weaker than they ought to be. The body is a strong medium, with very little carbonation and, though it lightly coats the tongue, a smooth, dry feel. Overall, a decent stout, but not quite a reason to ride down under."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Poured black, light does not shine through, with a big tan creamy head that hangs around and laces nicely. Heavey roasted malt aroma. Roasted malt flavor with a coffee/chocolate bitterness and a pleasant smokey finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. Very good stout."
"In all a very good stout - I must admit I didn't expect that from Australia."
"An okay mouthfeel, could h ave been a little fuller though."
"This beer is absolutely amazing, especially for the price."
"A good solid stout. Very dark with a giant creamy, espresso head that hung around for the whole glass. Ample chocolatey, roasted kind of flavours but a touch more subdued than some. Well carbonated, smooth with a pleasant, long finish. Won't blow your mind, but it shouldn't need to."
"12.7 oz bottle to glass. Best after date of April 2009, about 10 mo. old. Really cheap label if you care (I don't). Pours very dark, almost black, tan rocky foamy head. Roasted aromas. This was pretty much the most bitter stout I've had, can't tell if it's the roast/burnt flavors, or hops, or carbonation, or alcohol, or too young, or combination. Some malt and coffee, a little hint of alcohol but not bad. Decent overall."
"Slightly above average taste for the style, appearance was okay but docked a half point for extreme sediment. Sediment in a stout? Wtf was Coopers thinking? Average score equals average score. Burnt and roasted notes through and through, mild dark fruit is noticed if you try hard and get the tartness in the finish. Thin mouthfeel. Hard to finish it to even 3/4 (which I did), knowing the chunks of sediment will find their way into your mouth."
"The beer was velvety smooth inspite of above average carbonation, bearing testimony to the impact of the big flavour it has to offer. I would certainly be looking out for this beer again. Frankly, I am very impressed with this one."
"D - This is an excellent stout, and my first foray into the world of Coopers. I'm impressed and am also a bit curious to try some of Coopers other brews. I could probably session this beer!"
"Poured from a 12.7 stubby bottle. Almost ink black in color, with very little head. Awesome smell, first off dark coffee and a hint of some dried fruits, such as plums. Very creamy mouthfeel. Dark roasted chocolate, big roasted malts and nutlike, creamy flavor. Full bodied. By far my favorite of the Coopers that I have tried. Drinkability might be hindered by the full flavor of this brew. A sipper in my mind."
"Really solid atmosphere. Dark and ominous appearance, really full pleasing nose. Great combination of elements in the nose and palette. Well balanced with a little complexity. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"This is a fine stout, better than others of the style I have tried, an Australian gem of a beer."
"a nice stout that pours deep deep brown with an almost white head. i had two that night because i was so intrigued. first is english porter fruit... quite a bit of sweet apple and grape... a tad sherry quality. the second was straight up plum and apple malt. the palate was a decent body for a earthy mild smokiness that gave way to a very mild sour quality. i had both a tad warm as the palate was very bland otherwise. alcohol comes through a bit as a sherry quality. finish of shiraz grape, vanilla bean. very interesting with a subtle tobacco earth. quite a surprise how wonderful."
"D - Huge waves of lace and foam til the last sip, this Extra Stout looks perfect, tastes good, and feels fine which really makes it one easy drinking extra stout. A pleasant treat from the land down under!"
"Drinkability-It's a nice brew,easily available here and would buy again."
"Overall a solid stout that I would gladly revisit."
"Nearly opaque. Nice full, creamy head. Smells nice. with some sweetness, mild coffee, and good malts. The taste is on par with the smell with some added faint anise. Complex with good balance of bitter sweetness. Mouthfeel is good, though slightly thin, but still full bodied. Great drinkability. This was tasty and easy to put back many."
"C....see above."
" D- This beer has a light flavor but good roasted flavors. however there are not much malt flavor or depth to the beer."
"this one falls on the top part of my list. Coopers Best extra stout is a great export. it appears to be light for its class, but once in the glass gains its stout-like characteristics. has a strong aroma of coffee, and malted hops follow it right up. its easy on the mouth, smooth all over the taste buds, with just enough sweet to mesh well with the bitterness. pairs well with a good tobacco, wether it be a fine cigar, or in my case a briar pipe. packs a descent punch in the content category, and for the most part you dont realize it until your three or for in. Coopers stout has heavy notes of chocolate from start to finish, and in my opinion is one of the best stouts out there."
"a little expensive in the six packs but i got mine in a mix and match so cant complain about that. certainnly an interesting stout which is definately worth a try or two. recommended."
"Drinkability: Worth a try. By no means a bad lil' robust stout, and probably one of the better brews I've had from the Coopers Brewery over these many long years."
"Wow this is one of those beers i cant believe i havnt tried yet until today it pours a jet black cola colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger creamy head that dissapates slowly to reveal some very nice lacing everywhere all over the sides of the glass and lets no light thru whatsoever,the aroma is strong dark coffee,dark fruits and dark chocolate coated coffee beans very nice,it has a nice weighty mouthfeel to it with big hints of chocolate and strong dark cofffee the most prevalent with a subtle ting of some hop bitterness right at the end,this is one of those beers that i cant believe has taken me this long to discover and will be buying it again without a doubt."
"D - Overall this is a damn good stout everything about it is good and that makes it easy to drink and enjoy worth trying sometime"
"BBQ'd meats"
"A dark rich but yet light chocolate dry after taste."
"Notes: Outstanding!!! This beer is very enjoyable and surprisingly easy to drink."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by Cooper's attempt at an export stout. Nothing is overly exciting but everything is very solid. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability speaking, it is a well balanced beer and I enjoyed the robust roastiness this brings to the table."
"Drinkability: this is a relatively thick-bodied, above-average-alcohol stout with complex flavors. It's tasty, but I don't think I would drink pint after pint -- one is good, though."
"A very ashy, full-on stout"
"My shout mates! My wanker friends in OZ would laugh, but what do they know, they're drinking Bud because it's an import. This is a damn fine stout. And not because it feels good, or looks good, but because it flat out tastes good. It's the only Cooper's entry worth a shout, and admittedly, I am the last person your should take advice from, BUT TRY IT."
"It is of course drinkable, because there's nothing outwardly unpleasant about this. It certainly has good moments, but the flavour is weak and simple, and there just isn't enough to this. If I were pressed I'd want to refer to this as a girl's stout, but really I just think it's a poor one. (Yes, pour your waves of hate on me, female beer drinkers)"
"The taste is very creamy and well carbonated for a stout of any variety. There is a nice balance with the bittering hop and the roasted chocolate notes and dark malts. The creaminess, the carbonation, the pleasant balance with the hops and roasted caramel notes make this a very enjoyable stout."
"D - This is dangerously drinkable. It goes down nicely, the 6.3% ABV is well hidden and it is easy to drink a few. You wouldn't want more than 2 or 3 but overall this is quite good."
"Seems BC has a lot of Coopers around ( 6 at last counting). This is a real solid Stout with a full mouthfeel and that kinda rough finish that seems to be an Aussie stout thing ( Sheaf is kinda the same , though this is a better beer). I liked the way once it warmed up the roasty notes came out in the nose and the flavour opened up too. Worth picking up"
"Final say? A good stout. I feel if the flavours I noted were more intense I would be in love with this brew. It left me with a little disappointment only because it came so close to really hitting the spot for me. No real faults here, and I think I need to come back to this as I had this after a long days work in a smoky environment and maybe this dulled me to the aromas and flavours somewhat."
"Drinkability: Excellent, recommended."
"Summary- Liquid sustenance for times like these. So bad it was the bar's last one in the cooler."
"D: I probably will not be getting this beer again. I prefer other stouts over this one. I wasn't completely disappointed, but I wasn't extremely impressed either."
"M/d: lightly carbonated and dry from hops with a light syrup feeling. Not very drinkable for me definitely will not purchase again"
"This is my first Cooper brew... After this one I'm interested in what else they have..."
"Pours a pitch black colored body, with some suspended particles. Has a small creamy head, tan in color with good lacing. A nice roasted coffee aroma, some vanilla, maybe dark chocolate. Bitter coffee aftertaste, sweet milky taste. Very good."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and dry. The body is medium full body. The finish is slightly bitter and dry. This beer has a better nose than the taste, although, this is a very good beer and it is nice and easy to drink. I just would have like to have the nose and the taste match more evenly."
"Overall: Not the best stout out there, but a solid contender. Subtle, nuanced, and enjoyable, this is what a good stout should be. Recommended."
"Drinkability: The lighter mouthfeel and subtle flavors would allow me to drink a few of these before I got tired of it. In general, though, I prefer a stronger taste in my stouts."
"Notes from: 12/23/05"
"Deep black in color with no real apparent head or carbonation. Very faint ""ink"" like aroma and not much more. Some mild roasted flavors. Deep roasted bite at first then nothing-fairly one dimensional. Ok hop bite. Rather thin and watery body wise. I had high hope for this beer-dont know why but I did. Rather a bit of a let down. There is better out there trust me."
"As an Australian who avoids a lot of Australian beers, I think this is one to be proud of. Rating to style, this is a world-class export stout."
"Pours a dark black. 1/4 inch tan head with low retention and low lacing. Smells of roasted malts and mostly caramel/chocolate. Fits the style. Very smooth mouth feel and low carbonation level. Slightly chewy feel, but not too thick. There is a noticeable hop bitterness, but it quickly dissipates into a strong roasted malt flavor. Overall, really smooth and not too thick - worth a try."
"Has a layer of yeast in the bottom from bottle conditioning."
"Pours a dark black with no clarity. Thin off white head that disspates quickly into a nice collar. Very little laciness. Mainly coffee in the nose. Taste seemed water downed but had coffee and chocolate notes, somewhat sweet. Not much body to this beer, thin and watery texture. Not a great beer, would not seek out as a session beer."
"D: While this beer is very tasty, it is also very heavy. One of these would probably fill you up (even more so than Guinness I would say). I quite like the drinkability of one, but I don't think I could have much more than that. Overall a very fine dark stout that lives up to it's name. I would prefer this over Guinness any day."
"This went down extremely easy. No harsh flavors or anything that dominates. Balanced. I wanted to buy just a single (in case it sucked), but due to the nature of the 6-pack packaging, had to go all in. Glad I did. 6.3% alcohol will sneak up on me after a few of these, but it will be worth it. I got the least 6 in the store, and will definitely be buying this again."
"Very drinkable beer. Very happy with my purchase. Will drink this again."
"Sucked in by Cooper's again. Pours very nice; black, thick, with no head. Aroma is good; nice toasted malt with coffee and chocolate. But the taste is so underwhelming. Caramel and earthy flavors mix with the malt and coffee, but it just tastes so weak. It is almost like someone intentionally watered it down becuase they ran out. Its also not cheap. Spend your money elsewhere."
"Drinkability: Rich to the flavour, decently poised between the taste and smell, great mouthfeel, shure a bit heavy, but me likey likey AND SO DO YOU!"
"Bells, Surly, Floyds, Founders, Great Lakes...don't worry....Coopers won't be taking over your corner of the market on Stouts and Porters any time soon. WOW!!!"
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Foreign export stout."
"D- Anyone who is a fan of guinness extra stout should give this a shot. It's nice a dry and has some easy drinking qualities. The ABV however hurts sessionability."
"This is a pretty solid brew. Possibly one of my favorite stouts, the flavors and aroma are brilliant but not too extreme. This one is easy drinking and could easily be sessionable, but it's got enough character to sip and enjoy."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is of graham cracker, roasted malt, and hints of cocoa. The taste is full of roasted malt, with toffee, graham cracker, and hints of cocoa and vanilla. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a lot of carbonation for a stout. Overall, this is a fine beer that I could easily drink again."
"The taste is chocolate, fruit, prunes, hints of wine, spice and brown bread. It has toasty hay in the finish which is dryish and has a light spiciness."
"Pours jet black with a light tannish head. In the aroma, a roasty, oatmeal like sweetness. In the taste, roasty, caramel like sweetness, and just a hint of piney hops. A small bitterness and a medium mouthfeel, with a semi dry roasty aftertaste. A nice stout, but just over average. Nice hops and sweet oatmeal."
"Drinkability is absolutely fine - for another comparable but cheaper aussie stout try Abbotsford Invalid - both are enjoyable!!!"
"D: Good drinkability, rich in flavor, but light enough to enjoy in multiples and wont fill you up."
"This beer is one you would drink in autumn or any chilly night. Would go well with smoked gouda and maybe a smoked extra sharp cheddar."
"I haven't had many of this style, but Cooper's is a good one: I didn't like this quite as much as Lion Stout, but better than any of the American versions I've had. Nicely done."
"Pretty bonzer, mate! A fair dinkum. My first Cooper's and it's not bad at all. I would be happy to drink this one again."
"At 6.3% you wouldnt want to session on these, and I could only drink them in cooler weather."
"A good looking stout with a thick off white head fading slowly to lace over a dark brown body with a bit of red at the edges when backlit. maybe it's a little cold off of this particular tap, but the aroma isn't overly exciting little bit of chocolate roastiness, but the good chocolate malt qualities come through quite nicely in the taste. nice full bodied mouthfeel with adequate carbonation... a good drinkable stout."
"I'd have this again. Seems to be missing something, but there's a lot to like, and not anything to truly dislike. Nice effort."
"An incredibly balanced & drinkable Export Stout. Probably my favorite of the style to this point."
"A good beer on its own, but the smokey flavors makes this very intriguing to pour onto BBQ'd meats."
"Recommended..."
"Poured a very dark black/brown with a small brown head. There are decent sized waxy white particles floating around in my glass. The bottom of the glass looks like the bottom of a fish tank. The pebble sediment is kind of a turn off here but I should have listened to the label. The aroma is malty and sweet with a hint of chocolate. The flavor is roasty and sweet with just enough hops to work, but I prefer more. Slightly dry. Feel is moderate and slick with a good amount of tingly from the carbonation. This is quite drinkable. A slightly above average stout."
"Overall an above average stout, but nothing exceptional."
"Poured black with a brown head that dissipates to a slight ring. I didn't get much lacing at all. The aroma is a bit sweet, with a burnt roastiness. The flavor is mostly of a burnt roast malt flavor, with hints of coffee and chocolate. It has a somewhat smooth, oily texture. The bitterness is at a good level, subdued by the roast malt. Overall, not a bad stout, but it does not shout out ""drink me again""."
"Poured a really dark chocolate colour with a bubbly head that disappeared to leave some lacing on the glass. Smells very much of malt, barley and coffee. Nice strong stouty flavour but a bit sweeter than what I'm used to. Has a rather caramelly aftertaste and a slight bite. Mouthfeel is what I'd expect from a stout. Nice and chewy. I could drink these all night."
"Not the best and certainly not the worst. Maybe I had this beer on a non-stout day. Beer feels a bit fizzy while festering on pallette....something I don't usually notice in a stout. I do not find this beer to be as bitter as described by some others. All in all, this is still a decent overall stout."
"An unexpectedly fresh and highly drinkable stout. I like!"
"drinkability is good. this is a full bodied and full flavored brew, with all the flavors present to make a great stout. the profile is great, but the coffee seems to dominate a bit too much, leaving the roasted malt and chocolate in the background. regardless, a solidly crafted stout. cheers!"
"Overall, not my thing, but I guess I'm not a fan of export stouts to begin with."
"I had this for the first time paired with some outstanding food at my friend's coffee house in Fort Myers. I was impressed with it. Poured a dark chocolate brown. The nose has a nice earthy brewed coffee smell. The taste was robust with mellow dark brewed coffee notes and a hint of chocolate. Not too shabby for an organic beer."
"had this one at Outback, best AFTER date 3/07, aged for me i guess ; pours a deep brownish-black, w/ a med. brown head flecked w/ darker cirlcles around the bubbles leaving a decent lacing in my glass ; not a strong smell, some hints of coffee and alcohol, a bit of wood noticed ; an interesting taste, an earthy, darkly roasted coffee flavor, finishes w/ a faint ""dirt"" note, no hop presence ; a light-med body, moderate co2 ; a drinkable brew for sure, esp. for 6.3% ABV, i'd def. drink this one again..."
"D: This is a good but not great example of a stout. It wasn't bad, but I can think of several others I'd choose before it."
"D - This is a very good stout. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this import from Australia."
"D - Overall this is a decent example of the style, but perhaps not my favorite. Not surprisingly this reminds me of homebrews made with Cooper's malt extract."
"I have been craving stouts lately, and this one does not dissapoint. I love the dry finish, it's REALLY dry, but it manages to avoid being burnt or ashy. My only experience with Coopers previous to this is their awful homebrew kits, so this is quite impressive."
"D: Good nightcap. Alcohol content keeps me from drinking multiples."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, despite all the carbonation, thanks to the bottle conditioning; but still feels kinda weak. Overall, this stout reminds me a lot of a dopplebock with its medium body and soft yeasty character."
"Overall:	Finish too short. Not terribly complex. Up to five years of bottle age could do it some good but it lacks the complexity and body to evolve significantly. An easy drinking stout. Best served at about 6° C."
"In terms of flavor and smell, this beer rivals the Irish offerings."
"I like the fact this stout has a little less body than others. I wouldn't call it watery though. It has a beautiful chocolatey and roasty aroma but this didn't translate equally to the flavour. It's not bad but a bit too roasty and burnt toast which puts it out of balance. If you let it warm up it becomes a bit more malty with treacle notes. I thought it was very drinkable for a stout both with food and just on its own. Good but not great."
"It's a bit strong/full for a ""session"" beer, but it still has quite the drinkability, especially when paired with shell fish such as mussels or clams (and oysters, I presume)."
"overall enjoyable, and a welcome addition to my otherwise limited selection of good beer here in beijing."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is okay. It's fairly drinkable, but limited by its somewhat bland flavor. Overall, it's an okay beer. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: A good beer from Coopers. Easy drinking, not heavy and not thin."
"D- brew is rather filling so sessions could be a chore, but wonderful complexity of brew is wonderful, recommended"
"D: If one wanted a session stout, I would recommend this one as it does not tire the mouth with any overkill."
"Quite drinkable and probably the most interest beer for a beer enthusiast from Coopers. This is no Guinness FES but it is a decent introduction to the FES style of beer. Decent Mellow beer that I can see drinking again."
"Pours a dark, ink-black color with a one-finger head. Sediment on the bottom due to the bottle-conditioning. Aroma is thick and strong and reminiscent of dark coffee. Some cocoa aroma as well. Taste is strong and interesting. Hints of mostly dark coffee stand out in the middle. Roasty and slightly creamy. Finishes dry at the back of the throat with the roastiness second to none. A second sip confims the same thing. Definitely strong as an export stout should be. Somewhat better than Guinness' effort but if there's one thing I'd change about this beer, I'd exploit the cocoa notes more and improve the creaminess. Still a decent export stout and you can't really argue with something that sticks to the style."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew was as dark as night with a creamy 1/2 inch brown head. Upon first smell I noticed a sweetness almost taffy like and strong coffee. There was also a roasted smell. First sip you have a coffee taste with roasted malt and chocolate in the background. Not as heavy as I though, but a nice light bitterness in the after taste. This is a nice beer to sit back and just enjoy. Definitely worth a try."
" Body is nice, rich, and creamy, like a good stout should be. This is an enjoyable, highly drinkable stout. Excellent flavor and body show this one to be a great example of an export stout. I wish this was available in Oregon; until it is, I'll just have to continue buying it in Washington."
"It used to be hard for me to find this one but it seems to be gaining popularity. Outback has started carrying it also."
"A- 4.5, S - 3.5, T - 3.5, M - 3.5, D - 3.0, Overall - 3.65"
"Actually just the typical stout."
"Overall this is a damn fine beer that shines in the most important category...taste! I'd recommend you pick this one up when you see it."
"I'm not a huge stout drinker, so the chances of me going out of my way to buy this, or any other stout, is rather slim. I definately wouldn't turn one down if offered, though. It has certainly done the Australian beer world proud."
"D: Insanely drinkable for a stout, a rare style, but is drinkable in all occasions, from a 140 degree day in the Outback, to a cold winter's night. Used to be able to pick up a 750 from Hi-Times for $2.87 plus tax, hope they bring those back. For me, this is Australian for beer. Really, all I'd want in a stout."
"German Weizen."
"Good stout for sure. Could drink a couple in a row no problems but that would be about it."
"Pours black, ruby highlights, milk chocolate head, and nice lacing. Textbook stout appearance. Nose is a nice mix of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, and ash. Flavor is a lot roasty up front with not much else discernible but some dark maltiness. The finish, however brings some vinous qualities as well as some chocolate and prunes. Aftertaste is an awesome espresso bean roastiness that lingers forever. Mouthfeel is a little light and the carbonation could chill out a bit. A fine, drinkable stout. After having had their Sparkling Ale (and being extremely disappointed with it), this was a pleasant surprise. Tried this with some queso mahón, which goes alright with it, but I think this beer needs a cheese with more punch to it to stand up to the intense roastiness."
"Ehh, I wouldnt turn one down, wouldnt order one."
"Overall, this is just a great stout and an outstanding offering from Coopers, and as I mentioned earlier, it's great that it's so widely available here in Australia. I discovered and instantly loved these brews when I first came to Australia and use them as my go-to beers - particularly the Best Extra Stout. I have to say that the aged version of this beer (Coopers Special Stout) is even better."
"Ample tan head which sticks like glue to the glass. This is the beer equivalent of a black hole - no light can escape it. Complex on the nose - golden syrup, blackcurrant, plums. The taste is a let-down after the promising aroma. The just doesn't seem to be the depth of other stouts in the same market. The body is quite thin though the alcohol is very well disguised."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer. There aren't really any flaws to this beer, but there isn't really anything all that special about it either. I am not the biggest fan of the choice of hops as it doesn't meld with the whole flavor profile. Though there is some alcohol to this beer, there isn't a whole lot of malt in there to support it in the mouthfeel and the finish. I would take a number of stouts over this one, but it doesn't suck. I would drink it again if it were paired next to Budweiser and even Heineken...but if it was sitting next to an Obsidian, there would be no contest."
"The taste started malty with a sweet molasses feel to it before finishing roasty and dry with a slight coffee bitterness. Medium body that was a little thin for my liking and carbonation that felt a bit too abrasive for the style. Those are quibbles, though, and overall this is a decent beer."
"Poured thick and dark, left a very small bubbly head which disappeared quickly. Faint aroma of roasted barley and bitter chocolate. The beer had a faint roasted flavor but the flavor in general was subtle. I usually prefer a stronger flavor, but this was good none the less."
"Looking past the carbonation, this is a good beer, and worth a look for anyone who likes stouts in general."
"Coopers Best Extra Stout pours a very dark brown with a thin, tan head from a brown 12.7 ounce bottle which has yeast residue in it. The aroma is a bit estery, and I pick up a little roasted malt. The taste is a bit estery at first, but then it's roasted malt all the way. Recommended."
"This is just one outstanding beer. I think this may become one of the regulars in my fridge, as it has a high availability with a good price. I'm just in love with this beer. The full flavor, the smooth taste, the hints of chocolate, everything about this beer is delicious. When you take that first sip, good luck putting the glass down; you won't even need a coaster."
"Drinkability: It's a better than average stout- probably a good one for Guinness drinker to try. I dig all of the roasty flavors, but I wish there was more complexity."
"On the light side of stouts. Crisp and cool, easy to drink. Very enjoyable. I wouldnt hesitate to go for another."
"12.7 ounce bottle, stamped Best Before 30.08.07, so we're doing alright for freshness. Served at cellar temperature into a 17 ounce snifter, decanted carefully so as to avoid mixing any of the chunky white particulates at the bottom of the bottle in with the beer. Deep obsidian with a persistent but steadily thinning khaki head. Sour, vinous aromas of blackberries and rum-soaked currants with a few cherry cordial notes here and there. Somewhat cola-ish, as well. Very interesting taste experience, with vinous berry and tart apple brandy flavors up front, moving into a muted, soft cocoa middle that never speaks at a level above a whisper, and finally a very enjoyable chocolate and roasted coffee bean finish. The long aftertaste here just about redeems any strange or unexpected qualities of the flavor profile. Feels thin on the palate at first; it gains more body as the lively, peppery mouthfeel expands throughout the swallow and sets up residence. Feels just slightly chalky at times, too. A worthy representation of the style, no doubt."
"Drinkability: A good beer with well blended flavors. A little more bite from carbonation than I typically like in my stouts."
"Overall I was pretty impressed with this beer. Not amazing, but still a solid brew. I got a rich roasted and smokey aroma followed by a similar taste. There was more chocolate a bit of bitter coffee in the flavor, along with that dark candy flavor found in RIS's and export stouts. This is good beer, give it a try if you can find it at a decent price."
"12oz. bottle, with a freshness date of Sept.30, 2007. Poured into a pint glass. The beer poured a nice dark chocolate, forming a small head, that quickly faded, but leaving a nice amount of lacing down the glass. The aroma is roasted coffee, with the flavor very much the same, but with the slight addition of chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick, like expected from a stout. I could easily enjoy several of these in a sitting. Overall, a very enjoyable stout, and a fine offering from Coopers Brewery."
"This beer is not bad at all and I could drink a few of these at one time."
"Pours a deep opaque black with a modest head that dissipates quickly. There are bits of yeast floating throughout. Has a molasses and dark malt smell. Full-bodied and quite tasty; coffee, and malty molasses most present. All things considered a pretty enjoyable stout."
"When I opened this bottle, I noticed a strange smell, sort of like cough syrup. It faded as I progressed through the beer, but the aroma never did hit me right. Mouthfeel was a little light and carbonated. Not what I was expecting, from this black-brown opaque beer. The taste was pretty good though, a bit chocolaty. But it was slightly dry and crisp."
"Drinks pretty easy, a pretty nice stout. I'd certainly buy this again"
"I enjoyed this beer in that Coopers didnt feel like they had to make this syrupy thick or sweet to be a good stout. Pours from the bottle to an opaque black, with dark tan head that lingers and yields to good lacing. Aroma is malty chocolate-toffee, and taste is more of the same. A good medium bodied stout, that leaves a nice smooth finish."
"[Outside, the workmen's jackhammers sound like alarm bells; their voices like shouting on the beach.]"
"First beer by this brewery that I really liked. Very bold and characterful. Pours a viscous, jet black, beer that promises a lot of flavor. Smells a melded roastedness with cocoa, nuts, and cream. Tastes quite strong with the roasted barley and cocoa, with background tones of nuts, lactose, and fermentation yeastiness. Very malty, evident in flavor and heavy feel. Finishes with a heavy coffee roastedness. Very tasty, but I would prefer a lighter Milk-Stout quality an sweetness."
"Overall quite good, and I'm glad to have run across this Ozzie beer."
"Mild sharpness from the roast grain with a bitterness that is moderate but does not dominate. Light-medium bodied with some alcohol warmth on the palate. Also some fruity esters present. Medium carbonation and some lingering bitterness. Dry finish with a lingering roast aftertaste. The roast and alcohol complement each other well lending the beer good flavour without being too large."
"drinkability: pretty good, but an odd chalky aftertaste"
"Bottle says best before 4/11/06. I bought it last month (a single bottle) and didn't pay attention to the freshness date. Oh well, I'll drink it anyway. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours black with a very small head with goes away pretty quickly. It smells like coffee, milk chocolate and malt, but the aroma isn't strong. Luckily the taste is stronger, with it tasting like coffee, malt, and dark fruits. There's also a bitter aftertaste, but it doesn't linger for too long. It has a medium body, with a decent mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. The beer goes down smooth, it's good and drinkable. Hopefully the next time I drink this it will be within it's freshness date, but overall this was a good beer and I'd like to try it again."
"D: It took a few sips to warm up to, but I am starting to like this beer for its uniqueness. I haven't had a stout quite like this one before and will probably have more in the future."
"Extremely easy to drink beer. Simple and sure to please any stout lover and stout liker equally. Most drinkable stout Ive ever had."
"Poured a virtually black color with moderate tannish head. Smell is truly fantastic with strong coffee, chocolate, dark fruit (figs, raisins, prunes, and roasted malt combining in perfect proportions. The taste, if possible, is even better than the smell with the fruits, chocolate, coffee, and malt tasting perfect. Finishes with just the right combination of sweetness and bitterness. This is one of the best beers I've yet to try. Truly a winner."
"This beer is outstanding. I'm a big Guinness Extra Stout fan, and as much as it pains me to admit, Coopers whips it ass. Everything you drink Guinness for and more is found in Coopers. The major difference for me was a much smoother, less bitter aftertaste. Can't get it at home so I loaded up on this stuff during my last trip to SC and have savored it ever since. I'm hoarding this stuff like a miser rationing one bottle at a time. A: Black as the ace of spades S: mild coffee and cocoa T: Robust and flavorful, but not obtrusive or overwhelming. M: A little thinner than usually found in a lot of stouts, but it compliments the overall character of this beer so I did not penalize them for it. D: First drank this on a 90 plus degree day after walking for over a mile, and could have easily sessioned it. Thumbs up."
"Easy to drink and just as likeable; that is a winning combination, IMO. Is this the best Export Stout Ive had? No. So what, it is good and Id happily drink it again. I just might too as I can get six-packs in Council Bluffs, IA. My bottle is dated: 04.11.06. Ive neglected it my DBF for too long. I wonder if this would be even better ultra fresh. Coopers Original Pale Ale, well, sucked. Coopers has rallied with this beer. I cant wait to try the rest of the Coopers beers I have. I purchased this bottle in Lawrence, KS. Worth a try."
"This is a good stout. I just drank Coopers Sparkling Ale and was very impressed. It's been years since I've had Coopers beers; I'm sorry I've taken this long to try them again. At less that $1.50 a bottle here in Sarasota, they are a great value."
"Pours out black in the glass with a very tiny but very dark head that evaporates quite quickly. Smells like coffee with like a lot of hazelnut creamer. Tastes very lightly chocolatey, but too watery. Not much body to speak of. Highly drinkable due to wateriness but not cuz of flavor."
"Still, better than their Sparkling Ale."
"Dense black with a loud fizzy tan head that quickly dissolves into nothing. Darkly roasted malt aroma - sweet, a bit of coffee, and deep fruity esters. Blackened burnt malt flavors: bittersweet chocolate and caramel. Medium-full mouthfeel - drying with prickly carbonation. Pretty tasty."
"D - Drinkable. Very nice brew from Coopers, way better than a Guiness."
"The beer poured a rich black with a tan head. The aroma was of toasty malt . The taste was of lightly toasted malt, a little coffee, and a nice alcohol burn. The feel was heavy and dry. This was a fine stout to wrap up a nice evening of fine food and good beer. A stout that I would like to keep on hand if available."
"12.7 oz. bottle with an interesting shape. It pours black with ruby tinges and a small, fizzy brown head. The predominant aroma is sweet blackberry jam, but there are also notes of dark chocolate/cocoa, coffee, and maybe cherries. Very nice. The taste is a little simpler with mainly coffee and chocolate and a medium bitterness. It has a medium body that is both too thin and a bit high in carbonation for my liking. It's good, but I wouldn't actively seek it out again."
"No freshness date is not the only thing strange about the bottle as the label mentions no malts; only water barley hops and yeast. Very nice and black beer with litle brown head make it a good performance. Nose is very burnt, caramellic and sweet malted, grassy and porty. Taste is also roasted but missing bit of that oily I love in stouts. Good alcoholtouch without beeing heavy but well backing the bitterness. Well drinkable but you have to love it bitter and burnt."
"M&D: quite smooth and fine-carbonated on the mouthfeel, but it's still thin-bodied for a 6.3% stout IMO--the sweet edge fails to buttress the maltiness to make a more vertical or thicker appearance on the palate, although the finishing touch with a mild tang of coffee does make up for a bonus to make it more drinkable without falling dull. A solid ale, but showing nothing out-of-this-world."
"Drinkability: Good stuff! This would be more drinkable if it were a little more dry, but it's still easy to sip and savor and would fit nicely into the latter half of a session."
"This beer pured a very dark brownish/black with a medium head. The aroma smelled of roasted malts with perhaps a hint of chocolate malt to it. The mouthfeel was medium thick with medium/low carbonation. The taste was full-bodied with a rich taste of dark roasted malts. The hop bitterness was medium and I felt that it wasn't too overpowering. One of my favorite aspects of this beer with its nice smooth aftertaste that had a bit of chocolate malt flavor to it. I felt this made it an exceptional beer to enjoy with a meal or all evening for those who enjoy a rich, full-bodied stout. Highly recommended!"
"The ebony pour leads to a head that is about half a finger in width. Nose reminds me of a marshmellow blackened on a summer campfire, only not as sweet, thank god. A sweetness mingles with a dash of molasses and coffee for the taste. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and thick. Pretty nice stout that I could see myself buying again. If this was on tap at the bar, I could see myself sessioning this."
"Poured into pint glass by bartender and the sediment was poured as well (not my ideal pour...oh well). Dark brown coffee color with a medium tan tw finger cap. The dissapeared fast. The smell was interesiting having floral, citrus, and estery aroma. Almost a blueberry smell was noticed. Not too many hops were in nose. Flavor was citrus, grapefruit, coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. Had a little fusal hops bitterness halfway into sip. Mouth feel was medium with medium carbonation. FInished with a medium dry grapefruit bitterness hanging for a couple seconds. I would not mind having one of these again, but would look for something else."
"What a great looking Stout! Beautiful pour with an edible head. Dark and rich ""looking"" doesn't always mean good tasting but in this case it does. Delicious coffee and slight hint of dark chocolate taste with a just right amount of bitterness on the back of the tongue. Finish lasts long enough to remind you to open another."
"This poured into a pint glass with a thick foamy, tan head that stayed the entire session. The color was a dark ebony. The aroma was a faint raosted malts, but not lingering affect or pungent smell. The taste was quite good; choclate with some balanced bitterness. The body is a little thin, but extremely smooth in the finish which adds to its drinkability. Overall I would like to sit and drink a few of these brews because I believe this is a great brew just mabye not this time."
"Poured opaque black with dark brown edges and an inch of light brown foam. Loads of little pieces of sediment floating around from the bottle conditioning , and my pour. Aroma is of the roasted black malt , chocolate , roasted coffee and slight creamy/dairy. Taste is an oily , strong ,rich mix of smokey black malts , coffee, some dry, dark chocolate tones , wood, and a bit of a yeasty bite. Mouthfeel is slick and oily. Very interesting and complex Stout from Australia. Very drinkable as well."
"This is the first Stout that I've had the oppurtunity to try during my stay in Melbourne, so I'm rather excited by this one. Here it goes...pours black as black can be with no light getting through what so ever. There isn't much of a head, but there is a nice sticky tanned lace that suffices. Smell is quite nice, with dark chocolate aromas as well as some hints of dark fruit in the mix somewhere too. Taste is a little different...Im picking up more coffee tones with some marshmallow and licorice tastes happening also. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and very easy on the palate. Drinkability isn't bad at all either, slthough I can't see myself drinking more then a few of these. This beer strikes me as more of an Oatmeal Stout then anything else, but whatever, its very tasty and gets my seal of approval."
"Our eighth beer of the night for the MCD meeting. This one poured black with a light tan head. looks a bit watery. chocolate with some roasted malt odor. kind of a weak smell. a super roasty flavor. some sweet molasses/chocolatey taste in there too. can't pick much else out of it but since the roasty flavor sticks around it works. overall, a bit weaker than i like my stouts to be, but the taste was good and the chocolatey undertones were very nice. id have it again"
"Lingering smokiness, lighty body, decent is being nice."
"Taste is smoky and bitter coffee. Some malty sweetness. Not much hint of the chocolate from the nose. mouth is a bit thinner than expected with a loong lingering coffe bitterness. Not bad stout they got here, well above average."
"beer is best enjoyed on cool nights."
"Pours the deepest of brown colors with just a hit of light coming through the bottom of the glass. A very ephemeral head explodes as it is poured, leaving a sparse patch over top that is maintained by an active bubble at the top of the beer. Nose is very rich with sweet dark fruit, molasses, deep roasted malt and coffee. I would venture that there are some oats in this one as well. It has that creamy essence I associate with oats. Flavor is very nice and has a nice progression from initial sip to finish. It starts as roasted to light burnt malt with prunes and sharply turns to a light chocolate and finally settles on a lighly creamed coffee. Mouthfeel is a touch light for my taste. its right at the lower end of moderate with a fairly light carbonation. Its just too close to water for me. Drinkability is very good. There is nothing to keep me from really drinking this one. Easily could be a beer I could have more than one of in a night. Better than I remember it."
"Mouthfeel- Slightly sticky to the palate and a comforting thickness. This beer is perfect for someone who usually eats chocolate when they get depressed."
"Opaque black colour with a thin light brown head. A little lacing is left behind and some murky yeast in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is of roasted malt, burnt coffee and a little chocolate. Rich roasted coffee malt flavour. A slight yeasty fruity taste appears too. Finishes with some bitterness and chocolate flavours. Mouthfeel is smooth and oily with mild carbonation. Overall I enjoyed sipping it. A good introduction for me to stouts."
"Driankability was OK, if you're in the mood for a mild stout."
"A good Aussie stout which is very available and will be sitting in my fridge for when I need one."
"D = Pretty good. New addition to my fridge."
"Overall - An excellent stout, highly recommended."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet chocolate and crystal malt scent that is rich and creamy. The taste is decent. It has a dry crystal malt flavor that is earthy and sweet on the finish. It has some chocolate hints as well as yeasty zing. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent stout. I love the aroma, but the flavor has some defects to it. This is the best of their lineup, but that's not saying much"
"A nice offering from Coopers. Poured out to a black coffee color with a nice 1/8 inch head of mocha colored foam. Some heavy sediment in the glass and remaining in the bottom of the bottle. Label states this is natural and not undesireable. Medium level of carbonation. Some rings of lace in the glass. Aroma of bourbon, malts, roasted grain, coffee and caramel. Some mellow earthy notes as well, with a minor touch of toffee sweetness toward the finish. Taste was very satisfying; flavors of coffee and roasted malt, nuts and grain keep the tastebuds occupied. Mouthfeel is thick and full, like a old over brewed coffee. I'd like to have this on tap to compare it to the bottle. Recommended."
"Drinkability: 3.5"
"This is a slightly lightweight but still tasty stout. Coopers makes a decent product."
"A good macro type of stout, not my type however not bad."
"It is a stout with aggression but no sublety"
"Pours crude oil black with a coffee tan head that while short, has good retention, lasting most of the glass. Visible yeast sediment on the bottom of the bottle which they mention on the back of the bottle as standard for its bottle conditioning. Nose is strong roasted coffee and dark chocolate up front with fruity tones at the tail end. Taste is roasty espresso, chocolate malts, with dark fruit notes in the finish. They all melt together into a nice strong roasted flavor, almost smokey. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would have guessed for the style, but didn't detract from the overall presence of the beer. Insanely drinkable, seems sessionable even at 6.3%, the alcohol doesn't make itself known whatsoever. A surprisingly solid brew here from Coopers."
"Bottle: Poured a thick black color stout with a huge brown creamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of roasted malt and light hops is clearly detectable. Taste is dominated by an excellent balance between roasted chocolate malt and light bitter hops at the end. Body is quite full and has an excellent lacing/creamy feel to it. Overall, an excellent example of the foreign stout and a very enjoyable beer."
"A very dark black beer (hold it up to the light. yep black). Has a small creamy light brown head. The aroma is licorice and coffee with a hint of chocolate in the background. A robust and thick roasted malt makes it's precence known immeadiatly in the flavor. Notes of coffee and choclate dance about on your tongue with a hint of licorice on the finish.Yummy!"
"Overall, a great session ale, and probably one of the best offerings from Cooper's."
"Overall Impression: A solid stout, high quality, no flaws."
"D - This is a geat beer for bbq and other events."
"Overall, a decent beer. Its a good beer for an occasional drink, but not something that I could follow with another."
"Notes: I like this because it has the smoothness of a porter. Its very interesting because of the grainy taste it has and its extreme roastiness. I like it a lot."
"A very easy drinking beer."
"This is one stout I'll definately be keeping on hand from now on."
"Coopers Best Extra Stout delivers the typical stout appearance with the notable exception of some yeast which settles at the base of the glass beneath its black body and creamy tan head. The head retention could be better, but it holds well enough. Fruity esters dominate the nose before you take a sip which reveals the rich caramel and chocolate flavors within. It's smooth across the palate with a dextrinous body and gentle carbonation from bottle conditioning. Some of the fruitiness found in the aroma is also found in the flavor along with its caramel/chocolate maltiness and a roastiness that's more genteel than aggressive. It's rich and satisfying without becoming satiating to the palate; and the yeasty fruitiness lends enough complexity to it to keep in interesting. Nicely done indeed!"
"Smells of dark chocolate, molasses, and toasted malt. Tastes toasty, sweet malt, with light alcohol taste. Finishes chocolately with dark roasted coffee. Tastes chewy, thick like a meal in a glass. Attractive head throughout. At halfglass it yields more toasted sweetness flavor."
"A nice brew, and a good sample of aged Coopers."
"Not bad. Poured black like Coca-Cola with a brown foamy head that lasted about 90 seconds or so. Longer than I would have thought. Decent lacing. With the head completely gone except for a lace ring around the edges of the glass, bubbles still consistently rise to the surface and burst. The smell is quite a bit hoppier that I would have ever thought in a pitch black stout such as this. I don't like a lot of hops, and as such I gave this a 3.5 on smell. The smell certainly isn't offensive, just quite different than I was expecting and not exactly how I like a stout to smell. There are also some toasted notes and a hint of smoke present here, which is nice. This one certainly has a ""mulit-faceted"" taste. First comes a nice malty / coffee-like taste up front, followed by a pleasantly hoppy bitterness, and then finishing up with a dry roasted chocolate taste. There is also a faintly noticeable smokiness all the way through. Many flavour profiles present here. The mouthfeel, while not as heavy as I like, is still smooth and very pleasant. This is indeed a great brew. Brilliant!"
"An excellent stout."
"I like this one better than Guinness out of the bottle. Would really like to try Cooper's on tap."
"I could drink this everyday."
"My first experience with Coopers Brewery Limited was not a positive one (Sparkling Ale). It had to have been a bad bottle because Best Extra Stout is a corker. It has flavor in spades and drinkability to spare. This is a beer that I'll buy in multiples the next time I run across it."
"Drinkability and Overall: A solid, smooth stout that will please all stout drinkers around. A rich, complex and hearty ale that will keep you sipping. While far from the best stout I've had, I'd have to say this would be my choice for a session stout. Try it."
"N.B. This beer has greater complexity in the longneck (750mL) than the stubbie (375mL), the latter of which I believe to be more readily available abroad, unfortunately."
"Black pour. Chocolate cover lasts long. Bottle-conditioned. Huge complex aroma of tobacco, peat malt. Big smoke character. Vegetably feel in the hoppiness (chive). Multi-layered roastiness, cofeeish.. Yummy. Palate feels just a bit less interesting, mostly because of this tart strike toward the end, its rather mild, but doesnt blend with the roastiness in harmony at all. Dark chocolate flavors, fennel notes, grassy off-dry finish. Wet mouthfeel, medium bodied, but not as full as I expected. Really sheeting the mouth sides though. Great stuff."
"The head is gray-brown and still, sitting on a ruddy, black-brown beer. Loads of grainy, brown sediment. The nose is bready with sweetish toffee. Nice. Toffee and molasses up front; a milky, tangy middle; a bitter-sweet toffee finish showing alochol. It's a nice, toffee stout. Solid if not stellar."
"12.7 ounce bottle. Best before 18.09.05. Missing complexity inflavor and missing body."
"Pours an opaque black color, and is topped by a brown head that is not all that thick. The aroma is first of burnt caramel and then shifts to a dry burnt, roasted malt aroma. There are some notes of sweet coffee in the nose as well. The beer is light bodied up front on the tongue, but quickly moves to a mouth coating body that ends in a dry roasty sensation. This beer is all about the simple roast flavors that dominate the finish. It is burnt, and slightly bitter in the finish, though this is not in a bad way. This beer is actually pretty simple and tasty, a balance between the sweet maltiness and the dry roast character that dominates the finish."
"The beer poured a cloudy brown color with a bit of sediment in it. The aroma is very sweet with notes of hazelnut and coconut rind. The taste proceeds in an interesting fashion by sliding into the roasty and chocolately taste and finishing with a light cherry. None of the flavors come on strong, but they slowly build. Minimal hop contribution. The beer is thinner on the palate than expected by looking at the beer, but it still has a medium body to it."
"Go gabba, a dang rippperrr of a Starrrt Mate!"
"A pleasant drink, but lacking some character."
"Black, oily with a small tan head. Smell is roasty with a touch of port wine. Taste... Bitter chocolate, burnt malts, a touch of port. Slight vanilla hint in the end. Mouthfeel is a little too fizzy. Overall a nice export stout, though not as exceptional as I had heard from some."
"Aftertaste of burned caramel, toasted. With a barely perceptible comebacking of bittering."
"This beer poured a nice dark brown, almost black color, with a small but tight creamy head. No noticeable aroma, really. The taste is a very nice thick combo of chocolate, coffee and malt. Barely any bitterness to it, though it finishes pretty clean. A very tasty brew, especially on a cold night. Very drinkable. Another fine Coopers ale."
"Roasty black with good coffee aroma but then did not live up to its aroma and presentation. Watery, roast and not much else. Some yeast in there not muich carbonation. Less pleasing than their sparkling beer. Had a bottle in May 2005 that was much better and rerated up."
"Enjoyable stout from Coopers, and arguabley one of Australia's best stouts. Good to see this making it to the States!"
"This is a very tasty stout, one that Guinness might study so as to get it right. While not so much a prize as a great Imperial Stout, this is nevertheless a lovely way to finish off a meal. Yummy. The only dark beer I'd had from Australia until this evening was Sheaf Stout. This totally blows it out of the water. A lovely beer to pair with a rich chocolatey dessert."
"Appearance: Dark ruby brown almost black big chunks of nice tan head leaves some lacing down my sampling glass. Aroma: Soft chocolate stronger coffee notes, soft molasses and vanilla notes there as well. Taste: Creamy chocolate edge awesome coffee burst bready note from the excess of yeast floaties in my glass, very nice flavor. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied stout glad I finally gave this jewel a try smooth carbonation can't complain. Drinkability: Pass on the Foster's search for something from the Coopers line great extra stout excellent balance nice sweetness happy with this one."
"Lightly hoppy, the hops make a pleasant impression, but mildness of the roast in the aroma doesn't bode well. The flavor follows up as slightly chocolatey with a little ash. The body is a bit lively with makes this a pretty drinkable beer, but a boring stout."
"I tried. I really tried pouring a head on this one, but it just disappeared. Like that. Nevertheless, it is black as night: dark, dark, and beautiful. Aroma is slightly alcoholic, with a delicious thick scent of caramels or butterscotch, the smell is almost- I said almost cloying. Imagine that. The taste is good, roasts and sourness with the slightest hint of burn caramel opens the taste, and finishes off to a coffeeroast-like ending with a tang of alcohol at the end.I was surprised that it's not sweeter, considering the sweetness dominates the aroma. It tastes better than most other stouts I've had Mouthfeel is okay, carbonation is slightly fizzy, but definitely not intrusive. It seems a bit thin, but only because of the roast not backed up with more malt. Alas. An excellent, good stout."
"A very nice beer. Smooth tasting and not too heavy. If it wasn't for the off smell (maybe I just have a bad one?) I would be much more excited about this beer."
"Smooth drinking. Hops added in at the end complement well the bitterness of the coffee. I could drink 3 or 4 of these. Not too heavy. Spunky."
"Light-medium body that could be compared to a pilsner beer. It's pretty easy to drink, considering there is little-to-no flavor to keep you away from it. Sure, you could drink a 6 pack, but why? A very weak stout IMHO."
"much happier with this brew the second time around. a very good stout that delivers what is expected. score adjusted accordingly."
"Drinkability  Very smooth. This one went down well enough. Its not the heavy hitter that was hinted at the nose, but an excellent medium-bodied effort."
"Drinkability - rare it is that I give a 1.0 to any part of a beer's review. You really have to earn a score that low, but this one earned it above. I won't follow up with another one here, after all this could be a good stepping stone to introduce someone to the stout style without choking them on an appropriately thick stout. Kind of like the Cream Ale of stouts, I guess, but I won't be buying this again unless aptly persuaded."
"Drinkability: I could have a few of these, but it would not be my first nor fifth choice of a stout."
"This is a very smooth and easy drinking stout. I would buy it again to share but not for a special occasion."
"This stout is colored ""dead of the middle of the night"" black. Virtually no head deveploped with my pour. The aroma of toasted malts was very prevelant. The taste was a smooth toasted malt start with a nice little bitter hop finish. This has a moderately heavy mouthfeel. This is not a bad stout, much better than the pale ale from the same brewery."
"This beer pours up nice generating a nice head but it fades as quickly after is builds. The appearance is very dark. I didn't hold it to a light but I doubt any light would get through. The nose is sweet with chocolate notes. The taste is like cocoa, maybe some chocolate malt. I'm a bit dissapointed with how thin it is. I like a stout to be more on the heavey side. Bottle conditioning left a lot of sediment in the glass. An aggressive pour in attemp to generate some foam made it hard to keep the sediment in the glass. I hope my love for stouts isn't making me give this brew special treatment. A good beer to try but I'd look to purchase so many other brands before this one."
"Opened with a loud sounds of gases escaping the bottle. Poured a black without much of a head just a thing ring and slick of tan. Smelled heavily of espresso and sweet sweet chocolate with mollassas pulling at my nose. Taste was a little too cloying with a kinda wet sloppy brown sugar taste and more overly sweetness everywhere. Mouthfeel was overly thin for an export stout, tiny carbonation bubbles but too watery. Overall a decent beer, but nothing to write home about."
"To tell you the truth, I was a bit disappointed. I think I would like to try this beer again, however, not from the same selection that was on sale in my local supermarket. It is possible that I came across a bad batch."
"Not bad...probably the best of the 3 Coopers sent to America. A decent Export stout that I would likely have again."
"This was my first time with this beer and I must say that I am impressed. Coopers did a good job with this one."
"goes great with seafood, or with anything deep or pan fried. its interesting to compare this with the old stout, which is the same beer aged in barrels for a further 6 months. i tend to prefer this as i like its bold, in your face nature which is not something you find in a lot of reasonably priced stouts. one of my favorite aussie beers."
"Very drinkable... I could sit for 3 or 4 of these."
"I was expecting more, but I'd have to admit that this was drinakble, if not exceptional, beer."
"In the mouth it's clean and slightly watery. No more so than hundreds of other commercially successful stouts and porters, but I was hoping for authority here. No, this is a stout with loads of character, well-balanced, integrated...it's only missing an element of viscosity to make it perfect. Drink it on a camping trip."
"Dark Black Color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts and bananas (?). A medium bodied stout. Roasted malts are balanced by a very surprising fruitiness. A touch of banana and vanilla. Nicely balanced. A very drinkable milder stout. Nice. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Pours very black with a quickly dissipating light-brown, medium-sized head. Smells of roasted coffee and dark chocolate, and alcohol. Tastes much like it smells. Wood and coffee up front with a dry, slightly bitter finish. Pretty good balance overall. Mouthfeel was a little thin, but smooth. I could drink several, but then again, I am partial to stouts."
"This is an interesting stout because it had some characteristics of an imperial stout but it was very thin in body. Lots of chocolate and coffee taste. A good level of hoppiness made this beer really balanced. The finish was dry and roasted. This was a solid, but not spectacular beer."
"-F"
"Black as night. Nice fat creamy head. One of the best stouts I've had in awhile. If you don't really like hop bitterness this is your beer. It's not completely void of hop, but it strikes a really nice balance with a strong lean to malt. Super easy to drink. It's got a pretty strong abv to boot - certianly took me by surprise. Creeper beer!"
"Pours out to a cloudy ink-black with innumerable flecks of brown yeast conglomerating at the bottom of my goblet, with particles in a suspended gradient. The tan head has poor retention and sits atop very fine bubbles. Lacing is very poor to non-existent. Carbonation is paradoxical...mild to moderate by looks, but moderate to strong by texture. Aroma reminds me quite strongly of Mackeson's XXX Milk Stout mixed 50/50 with Guinness Export Stout...sweet with caramel, burnt yet expressive, hints of toffee and butterscotch, dark roast coffee. Wonderful aroma...strong, complex, and rich. Mouthfeel is at first flitting and spritzy on the tongue but the dense body smooths it out and makes for a very refreshing, mild finish. Taste is very nice...starts with vanilla...thin, burnt malts backed up by substantial malts nicely filling out the body, smooth caramelized sugar, rather mild hops teetering between being earthy and herbal at the same time, and finishing with a touch of wood and a hint of smoke. Hops are well balanced with just the right amount of bitterness. Easy to drink, yet sippable owing to it's complexities. Alcohol is not perceptable in aroma or flavor, though there is a hint of warmth going down and it packs a decent buzz. Quite odd feeling in the belly..the carbonation is out of cahoots with the density of the brew. Drawing upon the best of the two beers I mentioned above, but without their weaknesses, this beer is well crafted and bests them both. It had been a long time since I last drank this, but I am thoroughly impressed."
"Poured a pitch black color with light off-white colored head,aroma was smokey and somewhat woody.Taste was oily and wood-like with some sweetness lingering in the end of this one.Nice to see some sediment in a stout you dont see that too often,seems like it would be very food friendly."
"Pours a charcoal black, lines of nice lacing, some thin carbonation. An aroma of roasted malt, some chocolate also detected. A sharp and crisp tasted of roasted malts, mixed with chocolate and dark roasted coffee beans. Very thick and full bodied, stout lovers only. A finish that is dry and smokey, very rich, very easy and smooth drinking, an awesome stout that rivals the best."
"Ink black, appeared clear when pouring. Good and steady head. Aroma was the weakest area. Quite high in fruitiness and this was backed by a mild roast malt, but not much else. Well balanced flavor with no extremes in any direction (eg. neither too sweet or dry). Nicely balanced roast flavor, with a prominant fruitness too, that leaves a pleasant lingering. As advertised on the bottle, low astringency. Mouthfeel is smooth, but not necessarily creamy. Carbonation aids this, but also adds a filling quality. This is really quite a nice stout. Well balanced. Can feel but not taste the alcohol. I'd recomment this, except that the fruitiness may be high for some."
"Notes: A highly drinkable, big bodied stout. A recommended ale for stout lovers to have in their fridge at all times. A versatile beer to pair food with, I could see doing chocolate as well as a hearty beer stew."
"Pours a very dark brownish ruby color with a creamy tan colored head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is sweet dark malts and a bit of burnt coffee. Medium in body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is sweet roasted malts and dark fruit up front followed by some chocolaty flavors. A touch of bitter hops are present in the end leaving a dry finish. An easy drinking stout thats quite enjoyable."
"I haven't been able to find this around lately. The review is from my notes written 3 years ago. This pitch-black stout is as heavily bodied as it looks. It is not overly sweet, nor overly dry. Bitter chocolate and coffee notes, smoky and quite hoppy with underlying bitter citrus bite. The gorgeous tan head doesn't last long. Deep and complex fragrance. Rare treat!"
"A bottled fermented stout - That is not your typical find. And Australian at that. The head is weak to non-existent and the nose is the same. The color is a beautiful and rich almost a pure black. Now it gets better. The flavor is complex with a really excellent balance of hops. There is smoke & coffee flavors with very complex malt and spice followed by a sharp hop flavor that leaves no lingering after taste."
"Very dark, almost completely opaque, with a short and short-lasting, but thick, head, and nice lacing. Aroma is roast coffee with hints of raisin/prune. The coffee predominates in the taste, as the combination of roasted malt and hops prevent the fruit notes from making it very sweet, and also do a good job of concealing the alcohol level. A somewhat thin stout, but perfect for the outback!!!!"
"A solid stout with a nice black appearance, a nice aroma and solid stout taste. This one was a bit off the run-of-the-mill beaten path, having a slightly porter-esque tint to it. Even though I had this beer following a 20% ABV Raison d'Extra, I still found it hit the spot rather nicely. If you're looking for a beer that is 100% true to it's style, you may be let down a bit, but if you like a little bit of differentiation or strecthing of the style limits, you won't be disappointed."
"An eternal finish, one that digs in it's claws and won't let go! A contemplative stout, one to savor, linger over, and enjoy late at night, with a good book. The flavors come in waves and layers, your appreciation of this dark and delicious stout grows and grows. First rate all the way."
"(note; this is a follow-up review, so i'll leave my original review above, although I've changed the numbers). I bought a six of this to follow up the single I had bought and reviewed before. Unfortunately, upon further review I found this beer to be sweet and thin for a stout. If your in the mood for a sweet stout, this is a decent one, but I'd prefer Young's or Lion in that regard."
"Pours black as a moonless night, with a brown head that dissipates to a slight ring. I didn’t get much lacing at all. The aroma is a bit sweet, with a burnt roastiness. The flavor is mostly of a burnt roast malt flavor, with hints of coffee and chocolate. It has a somewhat smooth, oily texture. The bitterness is at a good level, subdued by the roast malt. Overall, not a bad stout, but it does not shout out “drink me again”."
"Impenetrable brown with eager spritzy head that diminished. Very strong, robust aroma, particularly from the bottle, of molasses and soy sauce. Bottle says 32601 which I presume means the bottle is just about a year old. Some sediment and a mellowness indicate its age; I'm laying a bottle down (not literally) to see how long this bottle-conditioned brew can last. Some lingering soy or teriyaki sauce in the flavor could be a remnant of improper handling (dead yeast) or the result of Cooper's unique maltings for this beer. A fascinating combo of sweet, lactic flavors and bitter coffee flavors, set askew from normal stout expectations by a stern wood quality and aforementioned soy. Almost nothing in the way of hops although the beer is dry enough to not be cloying. Rather fizzy mouthfeel for the style but that's the Adelaide way. A very interesting drink: a stout that verges on doppelbock territory. Should be a great thing to try in a recipe."
"The color on the pours is as black as they come, the head impressive, the lace in sticky sheets that cling mightily to the glass, both are a light chocolate brown in color. Nose is toasted malts, the front is sweet, the top medium, the finish is nicely hopped, dry, light carbonation. Not as good as I remember it, but still, quite decent stout and worth the try."
"Pours a black color that, when held to light, exhibits a deep ruby tone. A nice creamy head sits atop the dark liquid. Smell is reminiscent of a sweeter stout, but upon first taste, one can tell this is a stout of the dry variety. Nice coffee, chocolate and roasted malt characteristics in the first sip. Finishes rather dry. Mouthfeel is a touch watery for the style, which brings the drinkability up a bit. Overall, a pretty good stout that packs a little punch. Worth checking out."
"Poured a deep dark brown with a minimal taupe head and quick lacing. Aroma of coffee and caramel that I found very appealing. Slightly dry/bitter flavor that kept my palate interested. Hints of coffee and chocolate with a nice roasted after-effect. I am a Stout fan and I definitely enjoyed this one."
"The nose makes you think that it is a milk stout but during the first taste you realize that it is not.  It is bottle fermented and they may use a little too much sugar in this process.  In fact, there are brown specs in the head.  The head is decent at first but dwindles quickly.  The taste is a little strange, almost oily.  The high alcohol content is not overpowering.  Overall, this beer was quite disappointing.  The hops do not break through at all.  It almost seems as though the brewers do not have a direct goal in mind with this beer."
"Pours an utter sable with a modest dark caramel head, a little lace, a fair amount of swirling sediment noted, mild carbonation.  Aroma of coffee, bitter chocolate, dark fruit, and dark roasted malt.  Taste begins with a sting of carbonation at the tip of the tongue; dark roasted malt, bitter coffee, and dark fruit all ride a wave of sharp tartness to a crisp and very dry finish.  Alcohol provides a warming note.  This beer is nothing less than excellent and seems particularly suited to the winter season."
"A nice looking black beer topped with a creamy brown head. Not a lot of lacing going on though.   Nice blackened malt aroma.  Some slight burnt tones.  Nice chocolatey taste.  Roasted tones.  Coffee comes to mind.  All of this is melded together very subtely. There is nothing overbearing about this stout.  Some slight burnt tones as well.  Body is a tad light checking in slight above medium.  This is better than average but nothing special."
"Pour this Aussie stout hard to get a two-finger, craggy cocoa head that will coat your rapidly draining glass brilliantly. Mellow roastiness snuggles with a hint of fruit to finish tart and dry and long. Perhaps a bit too sparkly for the style, but the bubbles do a good job keeping the roast barley astringency from overwhelming the buds. A sound, swiggable stout."
"This is a very enjoyable stout.  Dry and somewhat smoky, with a strong cofee / roast malt flavor and aroma.  The beer smells as though it's going to be sweet, but there is almost no sweetness in the flavor.  It's probably a little on the thin side for a stout, but it's thicker than your average porter.  Dark and opaque as you'd expect, with a tan lace on top.  Probably the best brew I've sampled from Coopers."
"The uniformly thick & dense head tops a virtually black hued brew.  A hazy deep garnet hue is visable along the edges of the glass.  Light mocha & sharp black patent aroma along w/ a hint of tart fruity esters & butterscotch as the beer warms.  Black patent sharpness hits upfront, but gives way to a decent balance of hop bitterness, dark crystal malt, and residual unfermented sugar sweetness. Unfortunately the body is too thin to support the roasty & chocolately malt notes--  This odd, but unique brew seems to be a stout / porter hybrid.  It's quite dry all around, relatively drinkable & worth a taste.  As a stout, Cooper's is a bit lackluster, but is enjoyable in itself."
"Impenetrably black, with a small tan head.  Full, dense beer with a pleasing bitter finish.  Smoky, burnt flavor throughout the tasting.  Very dense with slight alcohol warming.  Good beer."
"Dark black with slight reddish hue.  Nice tan head, but quick to dissapate.  Roasty smell with hint of hop bitterness.  Strong tasting with noticible alcohol taste.  Smokey roasted flavor similar to strong coffee.  Finishes somewhat dry with the strong smokey flavor finishing with a bitter biting aftertaste."
"not too bad, the head dies pretty fast, even when used in the right drinking vessel, malty, bitter, with a nice aroma, a solid stout, but not a great one."
"Good high-alcohol stout from Austrailia. ""for brass monkey weather"" as they say. Tastes like a stout in spite of not having any roasted unmalted barley, only black malt."
"Bottle conditioned, dark and full bodied, opaque.  Kind of a scorched coffee flavor, starts very dense but finishes with a too bitter edge.  Nicely brewed and ""Guinness Extra Stout-like"" but the bitterness is over the top and brings the drinkability down."
"good stout, but can tend to be a bitty oily in textire at times. Still, good bitterness, but its not me fave."
