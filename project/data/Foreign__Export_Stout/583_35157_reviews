"O:  An excellent stout.  Quite complex.  Combines charred and roasted flavors with lots of dark fruit at the back of the palate."

"Great stout.  Lots of roast coffee flavor, with a hint of char.  Some malt sweetness but balanced by the hops."

"Overall a very nice Irish stout that is busy."
"Excellent stout.  At 8% alc.  you can barley notice."

"Pours coffee dark, thick long lasting caramel colored head. Amazing flavor, low to no bitterness. Very good and amazing beer. I personally prefer this offer the Guinness extra stout."
"Great mouth feel, great dark beer with kind of a crispness; great flavor notes! Not too malty. Ill be drinking this again."

"Straightforward stout with a little bit behind it, making it a tad sweeter than a normal Irish dry stout.  Alcohol is pretty well hidden in the taste, but might add to a lighter feel.  Definitely would grab again on tap as an occasional beer, might be cautious against a six pack."
"Smooth and creamy with a dry finish. Excellent brew!"

"Extra = dry; good drinking beer, but generally disappointing compared to other beers from the brewery"

"O: a fairly rich stout (sweetness-wise), with some interesting characteristics, though not particularly my style - for fans of the style or brewer, don't take a pass - for the rest, probably a hit-or-miss, depending on your personal tastes"

"This is a dark, almost black beer.  The head is tan and dense, but not exceptionally long lived. The beer's aroma is of sweet malt, a little grain, and it has a rich, heavily roasted character.  The flavor is a mix of sweetness and grain.  Full, thick body.  Excellent brew."

"Pours a dark blackbody with a thick, rich, craggy head with excellent retention and lacing properties.  Roasty aromas of dark chocolate, cold coffee, and a bit of toffee.  Flavor is sweet and cocoa-like with hints of toffee right up front, before mocha flavors, with their espresso bitterness, round out the mid-palate. There is a slight but pleasant alcoholic warmth on the finish that reminds you that this a sipper, not a gulper. Medium full body is appropriate to the austerity of its flavors and abv. I absolutely love this beer."

"Looks and smells like a typical Irish Stout, but tasting reveals a slightly high (and a bit too lively) carbonation level and more generous use of hops. The nose is more spicy than usual too. Relatively complex flavor with hints of chocolate, coffee, molasses and dried fruit. Near even sweet/bitter balance. Head has weak retention."
""
""
""
"Overall - A flavourful brew that is still very drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden and the flavours are all in balance. Well worth picking up a bottle to try."
""
"Overall: Not your typical Irish Stout but I'll take it. Drinks easier than its 8% ABV."
""

"O: A nice stout. Give me some more roast, and this one would kick ass. Still, this one is easy to drink and borderline refreshing in the way a foreign stout should be."
"I like this, will certainly purchase again as a standard extra stout."
""
""
""
""
"I prefer this on tap. Good roast character, and the sweetness is a nice counter, but that metallic note is a bit much."
""
""
"Pours with the look of a great Irish stout. Then the head died quickly and I realized the aroma was somewhat tame compared to classic Irish stouts I have tasted over the years. Upon first sip, the flavor was nice; not bitter and yet flavored with bakers chocolate and light roast. Not the usual heavy mouth feel or after taste of Guiness or other stouts. I will say it does drink smoothly for 8% ABV stout! Overall, it's somewhat generic (I'll forget what it tastes like in a few weeks or months) but does no harm to the style."
"This is a solid entry into the style that won't necessarily blow you away, but is perfectly enjoyable."

"O - An excellent dry stout! Worth checking out if you like stouts for sure. A stronger and tastier Guinness."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color stout with a nice light brown creamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of deep chocolate notes with light roasted malt notes also noticeable. Taste is heavier than I had anticipated with loads of black chocolate notes with some roasted malt notes and some light dry bitter notes. Body is fuller then expected with good carbonation. Very enjoyable and probably closer to a foreign stout than an Irish stout."

"O-A solid, well crafted stout. Not out of this world but another nice beer from Schlafly."
""
""
"D/O: The decision to engage in a beer-drinking experience may be compared to an investment: the level of risk (alcohol content) should correlate positively to the size of the payoff. Beers like this stout break such a rule by being needlessly strong for the rather ordinary sensory qualities they deliver. There's nothing seriously wrong with it, save perhaps for the lack of dryness expected from members of the style, but it would be just as ""extra"" at 6.5% abv."

"O: Overall, good but not great from top to bottom.  I wont seek this out, but Id gladly drink it if given to me.  Paired well with a large sunday brunch of pancakes, bacon, and eggs."

"Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a black color, produced a thick tan head and featured outstanding lacing. The aroma consisted of roasted malt and smoke. Full bodied, this ale featured dark chocolate, roasted malt and some hop bitterness. High in alochol somewhat dry and warming on the way down. Overall its an average example of the style, about as good as Ive had from a amercian microbrewery. Prost!"
"O - A generous beer, BOLD, very complex and with a good drinkability! Quite far from the style but I love it!"

"Overall- I'm a little torn on this stout, yes it is roasty and a little dry. However, booze is too noticeable, and it is a little thin for a stout. Not to mention, it is not the most complex dry stout out there. I guess ""complexity"" isn't a pre-requisite for the style, but something else could have reared it's tasty head to help this beer out."
"Overall, this is an average beer. I won't go out of the way for this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty good. I would buy a six pack of this."
"Overall: I payed $2 for a single if this and I honestly hope there are more when I go back because I only have one left and I would like to have more than that if possible. I like this stout quite a bit. Going to call it my St. Patrick's day brew this year and hopefully from here on out."
""
""
""
""
"Taste was a pleasant surprise. Some bitterness with coffee and roastiness. A really nice balanced beer. Easy to drink. Too easy. It is pretty strong and will catch up with you. This is not an overly dry stout which was a concern of mine when I saw ""Irish"". I will seek this out again. Not sure if it is available all the time."
""
""
""
"O. Not a bad beer. But not a great beer either.schlafly makes some good beer, and this one is not on my top Schlafly list."
""
""
"Thanks Sam!!"
""
""
"Overall, not bad. Not overly complex, but easy drinking for 8% ABV. I would buy again when in the mood for a pretty good extra stout."
"Very tasty Irish stout."
""
"O: Very enjoyable but a bold flavored beer - a very nice example of the style. Enjoyed by various types of beer drinkers at the Super Bowl party this past weekend (from casual non-craft beer folks to serious craft beer drinkers)."
"O: The beer is very enjoyable and easy to drink because the alcohol is well masked from the taste. It is a good representation of the style."
"Taste is rich and thick, but smooth-bodied. I get coffee and chocolate roastiness. There's little hint of the 8.0% ABV, just a smooth and well-balanced extra stout that's every bit as tasty as any out there. Superb!"
""
"Overall it's not bad, solid, but not really grabbing me like most Schlafly beers. I certainly like the Guinness Foreign Export much more."
"Overall, I generally detest the word ""extra"" in a beer name. This is a decent Irish dry stout, but I don't feel that it needs the 8.0% ABV. It's got a good dry stout feel and the taste is fair, but Schlafly always seem to do at least one thing I don't like in each of their beers. There's way too much alcohol in this one."
"Pours near black with a good light mocha head and a bit of lace. The nose carries quite a bit of roast plus some coffee. Very mild chocolate. The flavor is a mix of roast and coffee. Quite roasty and a touch acrid. Light-medium body with good carbonation and a faint dryness to the finish. Mild bitterness as well. Pretty good."
"Drinkability: After a couple more of these I will be lucky to be functional by noon tomorrow. This is a double whammy of dark malts and booze. Next stop: Hangover City."
""
"O- A great beer. The flavors / scents blend well. Schlafly did it very well."
"This beer is full bodied and drinks exceptionally smooth. This time around I think it's a bit more sweet than the roasty flavor this style should have. However, I'm enjoying it much better this second time around."
""
""
"M - Extra thick and chewy. Lots of bubbly carbonation which was almost a little coarse for me and my expectation of irish stouts. Finish is fairly smooth with lingering sticky sweetness."
"O: Goes down easy, a very tasty beer. Good example of the style."

"O: This is a good everyday Irish stout, could have been more creamy and had a bigger taste profile, but its a solid B, not going to add it to my beer fridge but it beats Guinness all to hell."
"O: I'm slowly beginning to appreciate stouts, and I have to say that this is very smooth, and drinker friendly! I would not hesitate to enjoy this beer again!"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was very black indeed. The beer poured a nice head that was kind of a chocolate color and nice and poofy. The taste was kind of like burnt chocolate, not terrible nut really strong. I think I would try this beer again."
"O - I was pleasantly suprised with this one. I'm not used to a dry irish stout being this robust,or smooth. I have had this in my cellar for about 7 months. Just a really good irish stout, no bells or whistles."
"For a FES, this was a decent take on it. Sure, it's strong and I'm feeling it as I finish it up, but it's nothing excessive and the booze never overtook the flavors and ambiance of this beer. I'm not sure if I'd give it another go but for anyone who loves dark beers and doesn't want to be bowled over while having one, this would be a good choice."
"The beer is medium bodied, sweet up front with a thin and mildly bitter finish. The midpalate has this great milk chocolate flavor that is very interesting. I really enjoyed this little stout. Sweeter than I expected but I guess that's what makes it a FES. I'd have it again."
"I could certainly have a few more of these. The only negative for me was the muted aromas but the taste more than made up for that."
"This stout is motor oil black with some tan lacing. Aroma is malt with chocolate, coffee, and licorice. Tastes just like it smells: unsweetened chocolate, licorice, coffee. Malty sweetness up front with some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Lightly carbonated. Long finish with a hint of alcohol. Just slightly unbalanced but still delicious. Paired well with some dark chocolate. Brewed with love on 02-04-2011."
"D - A very nice brew here folks... Above average in all categories and teetering on outstanding in most... I only get to sample Schlafly on a limited basis, but this is my favorite to date... Not overpowering and proof the depth and complexity go along way in making a world class offering..."
"Overall- Smoothest Stout I might have ever had from an American Brewery. Have seen this out in the stores as a Special Release but as soon as I saw it was on a Nitro-Tap at the Tap-Room, I went straight for it! Great drinkability as well!"
"Definitely worth a try."
"D: Pretty good drinkability for the abv. I didn't look closely enough at the bottle so I was expecting something more along the lines of 4%-5%. Nice beer and totally suitable for this time of the year."
"A bit overly carbonated to start, but that eventually with a few swirls and time goes away. Left are bitter hop notes and a dry finish. Just what this style should be and done pretty darn well."
"D: At 8%, I couldn't detect a damn bit of alcohol! The word of mouth about this brew has been excellent so I picked up a sixer. I have a few more left and may have to grab even more to last me through St. Paddy's Day!"
"drinkability off the charts - this is the stout that you can knock back a few even at 8% and still get the rich full complex taste that lots of impy stout bring at well over 10+%"
"Drinkability: nice brew, diffidently want to try this one again."
"on the higher end of medium bodied, this is actually a fairly quaffable beer. might not be the best beer ever, but for 9.99 a six pack this is an affordable quality beer."
"D - A very solid Irish stout. A perfect daily drinker."
"Drinkability: I thought this one was good and would be willing to drink it again."
"Overall, an exceptional stout. Never tried a foreign/export stout before but I would love to try more to compare against. Flavors and aromas were extraordinary and the balance was perfect. Probably the best brew I've tried yet from Schlafly."
"This is my favorite Schlafly that I can remember having. Very good."
"Overall- A good tasting beer, but it has a few noticable flaws."
"Within the style it's pretty drinkable, but not something I'd want to drink every day."
"Full in body, a little dry, and warming in the end"
"Very crisp smooth mouthfeel. It was a good a little hot. I have to say I appreciate the regular Irish stouts a little more than the exports."
"This offering from Schlafly suffers from the same problem that I find in just about every Foreign/Export Stout: it isn't complex or interesting as an Imperial Stout and it isn't nearly as sessionable as an Irish Dry Stout. Schlafly Irish-Style Extra Stout is one of the best beers in the style that I've had - robust, tasty (and a steal at the price of 99 cents per bottle that I stumbled upon last night) - but I can't envision many times where I'd want this particular combination of flavor & ABV. Good beer, though."
"12 ounce bottle, with about 8 ounces poured into a snifter glass. Little to no head in the pour, despite my attempts to get something out of it. What little head their is collects in a small ring at the outside of the glass. Pours a very dark black the consistency of motor oil. Smells surprisingly fruity, with notes of raisin followed by the typical stout smell of roasted barley and chocolate. Some almond notes are there too. Surprisingly bubbly on the palate, with the roasted chocolate followed by more roasted notes and some coffee. Hop character is there, but not exactly easy to find and it's mainly in the finish. Hard to believe this is an Extra Stout with the 8% ABV. One would expect this to be heavy, almost syrupy, but that's not the case. It's actually a very well balanced beer and quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This is the only area that I scored the beer lower on, and really its not the beers fault. A stout this good is not meant for heavy consumption, only slow drinking."
"Overall I thought this was a bit too far on the roasty side to be a traditional export stout but that doesn't mean it's not a tasty beer. Well worth a shot."
"Pours engine oil black that no light can penetrate. Nice tan head, but it quickly disappears. Aroma is roasty and sweet with coffee, bitter cocoa and some licorice notes. The nose seems a bit sweet for a dry stout. Flavor is quite nice and has a surprising smokiness to it. As one would expect, the predominant flavors are of roasted malts as bitter chocolate and coffee. Less chalky yeast character than most true English styles. Very little hop flavor, but definitely has the level of bitterness a dry stout requires. As mentioned before, I am getting a definite Smokey character, or perhaps it is just black patent? Definitely unique and a welcome addition. This is a very well balanced dry stout, and though I worried after the aroma that it would be too sweet, it is nicely dry and quite refreshing. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit sticky, but not a deal breaker by any means. Very drinkable, and noticing that this is 8% ABV, I am inclined to think that it is not just very, but extremely drinkable."
"While this stout isn't an end-all or perhaps overly memorable, it's still a beer that I'd reach for seeing it on the store's shelf."
"D: This went down easily and I would certainly have another. The slight astringent taste on the finish prohibits me from giving this more of a boost."
"D: Despite the ABV, I could have quite a few of these. The complex flavors and sweetness are perfectly balanced with the alcohol to create a stout I will look for next winter."
"Chock full of chocolate, this isn't quite RIS milkshake territory, but it drinks like chocolate milk. Full, rich, and chocolatey. A bit of roast with tobacco bitterness in the aftertaste briefly. Not at all cloying, though there's a good deal of sweetness in the form of chocolate and fried plantain flavors. Possibly the best i've tried from Schlafly... they should make a blend of this with their stellar pumpkin ale!"
"this has always been a schlafly favorite of mine. very bold and full of flavor. this years really seems to shine. ABV is a bit high but i could easily drink a few"
"Pours a dark black color. 1/2 inch head of a dark tan color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of roasted malt, hops, slight alcohol, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Foreign / Export Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, roasted malt, slight sweet malt, slight alcohol, and slight yeast."
"M&D-Very smooth silky mouthfeel easy to drink with a heavy to medium heavy body. Not sure I could drink alot of them in a session but this is an incredible offering from schafly."
"Overall, a very nice example of the style. I liked this one and would definitely have it again."
"Overall, a decent enough brew. Lacking depth, but drinkable."
"Stout pours an opaque black with a lingering head that reducing quickly to a white cap. Aroma is of roasted malt and alcohol. Malty foretaste with an alcohol burn on the finish No noticeable hop flavor. Seems like Guinness with alcohol added. The mouthfeel is moderate and I can drink this fairly easily but I really don't care to. This is not a repeat purchase."
"Next!"
"There is good drinkability on this stout. This is also a great example of the style I would never turn it down"
"Well, I've decided that I'm going back for this one... Its a very drinkable export with no trace of booziness at all, just a real treat... I liked it a lot..."
"Drinking this one right now. Pours a hearty black with some brown hues around the edges. Thin mocha head fades quickly but leaves nice lacing. Smells like roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel malt and a touch of hops. Tastes just like it smells. Very smooth, just a touch overcarbed. Covers the alcohol well, could drink a bunch."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. The stout appears a hazed dark brown color with about two fingers of fluffy ecru foam. The head sticks around for a few minutes before ebbing to a thin layer. Notes of both milk and dark chocolate, fresh roasted grains, bitter coffee, dry cocoa sweet caramelized malt are present in the taste and aroma. I was surprised to read this one clocks in at 8%. You certainly don't notice it while drinking. Dry finish and a body slightly better than medium with ample carbonation for an export stout. Worth a try."
" "
"D- Overall fairly high, pretty good export stout."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 2/4/2009. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours black with about an inch brown head. Head retention is good, but not much lacing at all. Nice aroma, it smells like roasted malt, coffee, molasses and chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted/burnt malt, smoke, coffee and chocolate. The hops show up in the bitter finish, and there's a good overall mix between the sweetness and bitterness in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit silky and creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew, I enjoyed it and would definitely buy it again."
"Overall: The mouth feel is slightly creamy and carbonated. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is a tad harsh. This beer is a good solid beer. The body of the beer is a little thin for me. There are some bitterness in the beer but not a whole."
"12oz served at about 55º. Pours a dense black with no transparency. Nice tan head is slow to dissipate and leaves some lacing that sticks to the side of the glass. Aromas are roasted malts, molasses, and coffee with hints of chocolate. Familiar dry stout qualities are present in the aroma also. Mouth-feel is thin to medium bodied, but silky smooth on the palate. Tastes are similar to scents - chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, coffee - alcohol is present, but balanced well with the slight bitter finish. Also finishes appropriately dry for the style. Great take on a classic style! Would definitely recommend."
"Pours a very nice dark black color with some nice tan initial head, slight lacing as it goes down. Deep scent, very dark and inviting, strong burnt grains and slight coffee. Excellent taste, deep, dark, and thick; nice burnt grains, slight coffee flavor, excellent hint of chocolate and toffee. It goes down very well for a higher ABV stout, slightly creamy and thick. Excellent brew."
"Notes: The post pour foam resembles that of the crema on freshly brewed espresso. Brewed with love on 02-04-2009."
"Drinks fairly easy for the abv, a good representation of the style"
"Very nice sweet stout."
"Overall, this is my favorite Irish style stout. I've had Guiness and Murphy's, and this beer is muuuuchh better. Its easy to drink and suprisingly refresing for a beer that boasts 8 percent abv. I woke up this St. Patricks day with a craving for an easy to drink stout with alot of flavor(and alcohol). Glad to let you know I found it."
"I am a huge fan of Schlafly, but this was a disappointment. The first Schlafly I had that I wasn't knocked over with. Bad batch, perhaps?"
"Thank you, Schlafly."
"Poured this one in a couple of different glasses and was surprised that it tasted best in a Chimay goblet. Pours black unless held up to light with a moderate sized brown tinted head. Smell is roasty with a hint of hops. The taste was wonderful. Roasted chocolate and coffee are apparent up front. The finish is spicy and slightly hoppy. The spice at the end reminded me a little of the spiciness in Chimay Blue. Mouthfeel is oily and cloying. This Stout is moderatelty carbonated. Drinkability is not very high. It is so rich, that after about four it gets to be a little much. My favorite stout yet, but I've never had a foreign export style stout before. I wish they were more available."
"This beer pours an almost opaque black. At first, thought was completely black but upon holding it to the light there is the slightest hints of ruby highlights. There is a one finger head that recedes relatively quickly - slight slight lacing left behind. Nose is predominantly of coffee and caramel with a very apparent boozy scent as well. Taste is very sweet up front mixed with coffee and dark chocolate. Alcohol is very apparent in the taste. Mouthfeel is oily on the tongue at first but the finish is on the drier side. Medium to heavy body, medium carbonation. Not a bad beer but the alcohol presence in the taste makes it a beer that I could only have one or two of in an evening."
"D: This is a full fledged stout. That being said, I love stouts and this is a nice surprise."
"D: A pleasant drink. I wouldn't mind another someday."
"Drinkability: Not bad, not bad at all. For me, it'd be a lovely every day kind of stout."
"D: Even at 8%, fully flavored, and full bodied, this brew is still pretty drinkable. Very tasty. I'm actually very happily surprised with this."
"D - IMO, it's just ok."
"I came across this at Lukas Liquor in St. Louis and was glad I did - it ended up going perfectly with a St. Patrick's Day feast. This stout looked perfect in a pint glass. What surprised me most was the creaminess and sweetness that it had. I was expecting it to have a much more dry feeling to it but was pleasantly surprised at how rich it was. I highly reccommend this brew to anyone!"
"It pours a dark, dark brown, with a small head that does not linger around for too long. It smells sweet, with some malts, chocolate, and black licorice. The taste starts off with sweet chocolate/cocoa that fades into a burnt malt and coffee taste, with a tad kick of hops at the very end. The mouthfeel is very creamy, but a bit thin. Overall, this is a very good export stout and matches up to the few others I have had. Being 8% and having such rich flavors, it is hard to drink more than a couple of these at a time."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" brown head over the cloudy reddish brown brew. Head fades at a moderate speed, with average lacing. Aroma is roasty grains. Taste is dark sweet maltiness upfront, with a not-so-dry close, with wisps of alcohol coming into play. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is pretty good. The 8%abv could sneak up on the unaware."
"Hmmm. While I apprecitated the almost non-existant taste of its 8% ABV, I found that the jacked up sweetness to achieve this was just a tad too much (but not quite cloying) for me to enjoy more than one of these at a time. If you like your Stouts extra sweet, this is a good one!"
"D: This one's stronger than i thought it was. Still works great as a nightcap, though!"
"per the label, bottled Jan 10 2007"
"Thanks to rysberg01 for this beer. I'm really impresed with this offering. To my taste, this is truly an nice example of an export stout, rather than than an extra stout, and the abv supports it. Very akin toa caribbean stout, like those found there from Guiness and Ceres.This style is a little highr in alcohol, an a bit sweeter than an Irish dry stout. This stout well represents the style. Pours a dark brown with an okay head that settles to a ring. Smells a little roasty, a little sweet, a little nutty, almost salty as well. The taste is also somewhat nutty, creamy, and only somewhat roasty. Some vanilla on the finish. The mouthfeel is unbelievably creamy, and it is a real creaminess instead of tricks with widgets introducing nitrogen. Smooth and delicious and easy to drink."
"D: Not quite as high due to the weather getting warmer, but still a damn fine Extra Stout from Schlafly. Since it is a winter release, get it now while you still can."
"Smooth mouth-feel, and easy to drink. Surprised this is 8%, can hardly taste half of it. Not bad."
"Overall a good stout. A heavyweight that could have benefited from a bit more robust malt however. Thanks to brentk56 for the sample."
"Thanks, Vancer, for the opportunity"
"I'm not sure it is worth the extra $$ that this is charged for as a seasonal, $9.99 for a six pack. This is still very good though. If I have any left over to cellar after tonight, it will be interesting to see what happens."
"I enjoyed this beer. A good stout to seek out if in the St. Louis area."
"There was some lacing as I consumed the beer but it was very minimal. I tried to get more out of the aroma but failed. Still this was enjoyable and I will take it easy and enjoy the rest of the sixer at a later date."
"I have some of this that I cellared last year so I am anxious to see how it has cellared."
"Don't see this style everyday, aside from the Guiness version or a few homebrewer's. The beer begins with a deep, dark brown color and promises a viscous texture. Good head formation and retention of the tan variety, showing fair lacing later. Aromas are sweetly malty with a firm follow-up of roasted grains. Not overly complex, but rich and clean with a light lactose twang in the nose. Flavors provide much more malt sweetness, but not to dwarf the roasted, charcoal malts. Hints of espresso and cocoa decorate the brew but never dominated. Hopped for bitterness, but no decernable flavoring. Leaving the bitterness and flavor from the roasted grains to give roundness and palatability. Decently weighted and creamy in the texture, albeit too sweet on the teeth. Finishes, still, sweet with a firm shadow of roasted malt. A really nice beer, but probably a bit too sweet (caramel) for the style. Appreciated, but it's no Guinness."
"D - Outstanding. I'm really, really impressed with this stout. One of the most drinkable of it's style that I've ever encountered."
"Good sipping beer with moderate alchohol 8%. I'm planning to throw some beef into this stuff and pop it on the grill, it's begging for the ""barbie""."
"d: Don't have much experience with the style, but I know I like this beer. Big on flavor, big on booze, no run of the mill stout. Doesn't give away its alcohol content in the taste, but I can't help but notice the effects or am I just sleepy? Anyway, I think I prefer lion stout, but its still nice to have a good export stout brewed in my area, keep up the good work Schlafly."
"Jet black body shows only a little light when held up to the light. Milk chocolate colored head starts at about an inch but quickly fades to just a skim. Nose is a spicey super zesty shock to the senses. The presence of grain alchol lets you know this is no 5% brew. Wow, as this hits the mouth you get a creamy coffee and chocolate mix. Smooth and well balanced darkness includes notes of anise, molases and chicory. Coffee feel stays on the mouth and is welcome by me. Lovely and very drinkable. I should have bought a case."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, this is a decent beer to drink for a little while if youre ok with the sweetness. Its a good beer and I could drink a couple if these but after that I would look for something a little lighter."
"D: Decent brew. Nothing ground breaking but tasty none the less. I have a feeling that the sour twang at the beginning of the beer wasnt planned, but you never know. It wasnt enough to really deter from the flavor."
"D- Not as refined as other Export Style Stouts, a bit rough and the roasted character is not as defined and in your face as I had expected. Still a good beer, no doubt about that ... I just think it misses the mark for the style a little bit."
"D- Starts bitter and harsh, but you get used to it. In fact, it actually becomes more palatable and nearly enjoyable half-way through. It might be because of it warming up a little, and more flavor comes out countering the sharp bitter."
"Cheers!"
"D - Excellent tasting beer here with nice complexities and good alcohol. Mouthfeel is also very appealing and obviously works very well with this style. Thanks again to Vancer for this sweet, not-so-little stout."
"D - A pretty good stout. Nothing amazing but it will do in a pinch."
"The tap version is preferred, but I'd drink either anytime. Probably at least two."
"Overall, I like this better than Schlafly's Coffee Stout, which has a harsh side. But I don't think it justifies its $9 price tag. Perhaps that was simply opportunistic pricing for St. Patrick's Day!"
"D - Alcohol went unnoticed...I didn't even realize it was 8.0% until I started my review. Needless to say, that it the only thing that would keep me from drinking more than a few in one sitting. Excellent stout - this is exactly what I think an Irish Stout should be like."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"I am very impressed with this offering from Schlafly. When poured it looks like any other good stout, and the nose is the same. The taste is where this beer shines. Very good, with roasted bitterness balanced by just a little caramel sweetness. Excellent body, and an extremely clean finish. Probably the best finish of any stout I've ever tasted. I could drink this beer all day, and at 8% that could be dangerous. Excellent work from the folks at Schlafly."
"I had this on tap at the brewery/tap room and a new batch had just been released on Feb 2, 2007. Served in a snifter - it had an excellent aroma and good complex flavor combining smooth roast and sweet malts. It was very drinkable - the 8% ABV was very well hidden. Blackish-red in color and only a small, creamy tan head which was not long-lasting compared to other Irish stouts."
"I'm not a fan of sweet stouts and this one is perfect for me. This is another fine product from Schlafly and a stout that I'll definitely have in my fridge."
"Taste is pretty sweet up front with more of the chocolate noted in the nose. There is also some nutty and roasted malt character, fruit, and some noticeable hops. The roasted bitterness lingers on the palate and the beer finishes slightly dry. Definitely an easy drinker for an 8% ABV. Pretty good stout in my opinion, and I think those that enjoy a sweeter stout will think likewise."
"Smooth, medium bodied, and easy to drink.A bit milder roast and slightly sweeter than some Irish stouts but very well balanced and very enjoyable. Well worth a try."
"Overall, it's a fairly unique Irish dry. It's sweet to be sure, without quite being an English style stout. It's missing the more acrid bitterness of the roasted malts that usually appears in dry stouts. It's bitter as it should be, and appropriately without hop aroma. It's also easy to drink in spite of the 8% ABV. Perhaps not my favorite offering from what is rapidly becoming one of my favorite breweries, but it isn't shabby either. I'd recommend it to stout lovers."
"Solid medium body, not a lot of roasted barley flavor for a stout. Plenty of malt flavor otherwise. A long dry finish with some coffee flavors. It had a little sour twang to it, that took my flavor rating down a bit. Improved as it warmed, and I had already left it out for a while before opening. Pretty easy drinking for an 8% brew."
"Served at a nice temperature (as all brews), this brew slid down smooth and silky  not a dry stout at all. Just wish they put it in a manly glass instead of the wimpy snifter"
