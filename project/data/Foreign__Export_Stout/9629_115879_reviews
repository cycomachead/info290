"Overall, Moher Stout fits the description of an Imperial Irish Stout to a tee. It delivers on huge chocolate and roasted malt taste, yet leaves the palate dry and wanting more. Although I wish the alcohol was slightly better hidden, this is still an excellent stout."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 3/4/2015. Pours dense pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toasted oats, dark bread, raisin, prune, herbal, floral, light char, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toasted oats, dark bread, raisin, prune, herbal, floral, light char, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Good amount of herbal/roast/charred bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toasted oats, dark bread, raisin, prune, herbal, floral, light char, and yeast/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast notes; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a light-moderate warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an excellent foreign stout style! All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of roast/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; and smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"This one's a keeper."
"A bit boozy.  The alcohol sits on top of the beer giving it a watery appearance.  Going to try and age a few bottles."

"O - This is a decent beer. The flavors seem to be a bit too bitter and unbalanced."

"Overall: a top notch beer from shorts, I really like their big and dark stuff. This beer takes all the good traits of an irish stout and throws them into a deliciously boozy and flavorful beer."

"Overall a good beer. Perhaps could use a bit more malt body to balance out the higher abv."
