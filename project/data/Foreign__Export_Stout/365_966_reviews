"Body: Medium body with light carbonation. Soft taste with a great bitterness."
""

"Pretty good beer, not great but pretty good. Deep stout flavor with a little bit of hoppy bite in the beginning middle is slightly pleasant and the after taste is a decent stout taste."

"Pours a black color that tries its best not to let any light through, mission accomplished!!. Head is light coffee colored with mini craters and very very nice lacing left behind. Aroma is of roasted malts and coffee beans, very pleasant and not overpowering. Taste is also nice with a great blend of roasted coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate. Balance is nice between roast flavors, coffee, chocolate and hops. Good carbonation makes this stout very drinkable with a good kick of bitter at the end. Decent balance.."

"Now this is a really good stout.  It might even be great, but I'll have to try it a second time before deciding on that.  Distinct bittersweet dark chocolate and black licorice flavors, nicely balanced.  Really glad I found this one as it will make a nice alternative to Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (the gold standard of stouts)."

"Had this at Pike and it was very good. Could drink several of them with pleasure. Feel like they need to make a higher ABV version."

"No light is getting through this one. Inky black with a creamy tan head. The head dissipates down to a slight disc that leaves some nice lacing. The aroma is mild, with some light notes of roasted malt and coffee. The taste is pure dark roasted malt. It has a nice burnt astringency tempered with a nice earthy hops on the finish. It has a good weight to the body and a nice silky feel on the palate. It's a straight-forward rich and malty stout."

"Re-review, December 2013: This is still one of my favorite export stouts, or any stout really. It's kind of like the best of both worlds between an imperial stout and a regular stout (pick your variety, dry/Irish, oatmeal, or American). I may have to try cloning it. I love the bold dark roast flavors, the slight touch of burnt (a good flavor for me in the right quantities), and the touch of espresso coffee and dark semi-sweet baker's chocolate. I'm not sure I detect anise this time around, but I'll leave the original review in place for posterity. Second time around I still rate this one very high. In fact this isn't my second time having it, just my second time posting a review. One of pike's most tasty regulars."

"A wonderful beer, especially for the price. I cant remember a beer that tasted this good for the value. I will certainly purchase more of these. A perfect beer in anticipation of Thanksgiving tomorrow and the impending cool front dropping down to South Florida."

"Smell the chocolate, taste the coffee chocolate, has that raw chocolate aftertaste. A totally fine Pacific Northwest Beer. I hope they can get thus in Alaska, really fine for a cold wrt night. Really Extra Stout. Gonna take some of this back to my Texas Friends!"

"O - Very smooth and enjoyable stout, alive with flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Very harsh roasted (burnt) bitterness, with a hop bite, at first quaff. Dark brown bread sweetness on the aftertaste. The roast bitterness continues to predominate as the beer warms, but it is less potent. This may explain the sweet, creamy mouthfeel. This one improves with time."

"Overall - Solid brew all the way around, the hops add character and uniqueness that made me have to respect it (that and I enjoyed it). Recommend for sure."
"O/D - A nice stout. Doesn't do too much to hold onto you, but it seems like a decent example of the style. I have to admit I got a little bored with it after the first glass."

"Got a 22 ounce bottle on sale. pours a deep black with a small amount of slightly creamy head that disappears quickly. I pick up the roasted malts on the first smell, second i come up with a little bit of coffee and very small amount of black licorice, not too strong of smell but i am definitely interested. first taste goes down nice and smooth, with a very drinkable flavor, easy to pick out individual malts. roasted and darker caramel malts. the finishing aftertaste blends all the flavors and ends with that sweetness and then hint of coffee. Very solid brew, easy drinking with tons of dark malt flavors."

"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours dark brown and falls into the glass as a jet black liquid with a thick, creamy tan head that dissipates slowly. Some webbed lacing trails behind the retreating head. There are aromas of dark roasted malts, black coffee, chocolate, and a little prune. The beer is very roasty in flavor from the dark malts. I get that coffee and prune from the nose, but also a little licorice. I only get a touch of chocolate there, but it isn't much. The body is full and creamy. The roasty aftertaste lingers in the mouth and the finish is slightly dry. The beer drinks fairly easily due to the fact that it is smooth. This is an excellent beer. If you like your stouts very roasty, this one is for you."

"A great tasting stout that has a nice yet unexpected northwest hoppiness to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very nice stout overall, has great roasty flavors and a nice creamy, milky feel, highly drinkable and well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""

"Great stout. Let this one almost get to room temperature before cracking into. I think that is vital to do, the darker the beer. Great beer from a great brewery."

"O- Another winner from Pike. These guys don't get enough exposure in the beer community IMO. Would love to have this on nitro pour and/or cask."
"Overall an all-around solid stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good stout. The mouthfeel could have been a bit smoother and warmer."
""
""
""
"In summary, I can see why this is one of the more highly-rated export stouts on this website, it blends slightly higher than usual hopping with clean and dry black coffee / chocolate and a touch of blueberry fruitiness over a really nice texture without relying upon acridness as the sole source of bitterness. The only criticism I can muster is that the hopping presented to the palate isn't as noticeable as it could be in the nose."
""
""
"Overall, a very well done Export Stout. Beautiful appearance, backed by simple, but bold and very enjoyable flavors."
"O- I think this is a pretty good beer. I would definitley drink it again. While I didn't care for the smell to much, it made up for it in taste."
"From the 22 oz bottle. Label on this version says 6.6% and 65 IBU."
""
"O: One of the better mainline offerings from Pike. A pretty solid export stout."
""
"overall not a bad stout for the price tag. nothing really different about this one that makes it stand out aside from the slightly hopped up taste."
""
""
""
"Well well well. This is excellently well done. Creamy and smoothe. Light carbonation balanced perfectly well, with only a minimal alcohol aftertaste. Definitely one of my favourite representations of this style, which happens to be one of my favourite styles. I will be picking up a couple more to bring back to Texas with me."
"This is a stout-lover's stout: none of this ""stout as dessert"" nonsense here. It's not exceptionally heavy, it's not sweet at all, but it manages to pull everything together in a coherent if forthright whole. Great stuff."

"So drink at your own discretion."
"Poured into New Belgium globe glass. Appearance is black, opaque, and viscous with a velvety layer of brown head which retains nicely. The nose starts with deep roasted malts with a hint of smokiness, this is paired with molasses and fig. The taste is roasty and dry up front and develops a nice hop bitterness towards the finish. Almost no sweetness which is a surprise to me considering how malty it is. Mouthfeel is thinner than the appearance suggests, but is appropriate for the gravity of this beer. Overall, this is a nice full flavored stout with a bit of unique character. It leans towards the dry side with almost no sweetness which is unlike most stouts."
""
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with an impressive 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some nice thick soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, black coffee, roasted malt, pine, toasted biscuit, herbal, citrus rind, and earthy hops. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, espresso, pine, grapefruit, roasted malt, toast, herbal, char, and earthy hops. Good sized roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, espresso, pine, charred malt, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of roasted and hoppy flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming noticed after the finish. Quite smooth to drink, but is still a bit of a sipper. Overall this is a really excellent export stout! Great flavor balance with hoppiness; and quite smooth to sip on, with big robust flavors."

"Mouthfeel is a nice slightly gritty texture. Overall, very pleasing beer."
""
""
""
"O- very good stout as far as regular stouts go. Nothing crazy or eccentric about this beer just a stout with good flavor and aroma. Would drink this again if I ever get another chance."
""
"Yeah, I reckon Pike made and continues to make a fine Foreign Extra Stout. Good on them."
""
""
""
""

"Nothing off about this beer, it is a vision of stout that seems focused on bitterness and color."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Poured in a goblet and developed a one half inch head, good lacing all around the glass. Roasted coffee and chocolate hit my nose; the taste is as if I am drinking strong unsweetened coffee with chocolate added. I like it, it leaves a bitter after taste that some might dislike. HOG"
""
""
""
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall a solid package that is worth the price of admission. I think I picked this up for something like 5 bucks while traveling (something pretty much unheard of in PA.) I would get this again if the opportunity presented itself. It is a solid take on the style."

"Solid stout overall that I would revisit again and again"
""
"Purchased a bottle back in 2009 and have had in my cellar until this evening. Drinking it tonight to celebrate two years of home ownership. Poured into a Great Divide Yeti stout tulip glass. Dark brown colored body, with a medium sized mocha colored head. The head dissipated soon, but left some nice lacing on the glass. There was a pleasant smell of smoke and baker's chocolate. Taste was very inviting. Lots of notes of coffee, chocolate cake, and root beer. At first though, this beer left a somewhat too harsh bitter coating on my palate. But as the beer warmed up to almost near room temp, that seemed to fade away. There was a nice and creamy mouthfeel at the end. This beer held up nicely for almost two years in the beer cellar, and it would be worth purchasing more at this low price point."
""
"Overall: A nice solid stout for a chilly rainy night in Seattle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My only complaint was that, because the higher alcohol level, I couldn't have more than one and still drive home that night."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, one of Pike's better offerings I'd say. A great dessert/nightcap/cold day kind of beer."
"Taste, like the nose, is smokey and rich, chocolate and coffee come through as w ll. Mouthfeel is light and dry with a light finish."
"drank this brew last night with a buddy, I aquired it from a trade from a very kind girl on the other wedsite. She throw this one in as an extra and boy am I happy she did. This beer was poured from a 22oz bomber into a darkness snifter. It pours a motor oil black with a thick light brown head. This beer looks super thick and smells great like chocolate and dried fuits. After about a minute the head finally subsided enough to drink it. The smell and the look was gerat but the taste was just ok. I was expecting a big robust beer and it was kinda on the lighter side. The mouthfeel was good nothing too exciting, but still an over all good drinking brew"
"However you view it, this is a delicious stout that would make a great treat for dessert, or even to make custom chocolate sauce."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark opaque brown, with a nice two finger mocha brown head. Head lasted 10 minutes or so before leaving some random clinging on the sides. Remaining head clung well, but slid back down quickly. Aroma was strongly of a milky slightly dark chocolate, with small hints of an oaky wood in the back. Flavor was slightly sweet, with a tail end of bitter. Predominant was a slightly watered down milky chocolate. Not a bad flavor, but a bit understated. Felt good in the mouth. Coated well, and perfectly carbonated. A very mellow well balanced sip. Overall a decent stout. I have had better for the price, but not a bad beer."
"O: wantaway stout that remains local because of it's ill-perceived stance in a relatively competitive category."
"Average stout. Tastes good. Nothing amazing, but solid beer. A little thin for my tastes. Enjoyable to drink. Problem is, it reminds me of 50 other stouts sitting on the shelf, it just doesn't stand out as a special beer. I'm glad I tried it, and the brewery was a pretty neat place."
"overall, it packs a nice amount of flavor for a ""single"" stout."
"This pours dark, thick jet black motor oil with a fat, creamy dark tan head that sticks around a lont time leaving great walls of thick lacing. The smell is of roasted malts, robust coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and earthy hops. The taste follows with tons of roasted flavor, bitter coffee and a slight semi-sweet chocolate flavor in the middle. Finishes dry with a mouthfull of earthy and floral hops balanced with a roasty after breath. Nicely balanced, creamy and thick on the mouth. Simple, dry and balanced stout. Easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Very Drinkable, not a session beer at 7% ABV. A 22oz bomber goes down very easily."
"Enjoi!"
"Overall I think this style gets overlooked and quite often overly complicated. Pike did a perfect job of brewing a very solid American Stout. Too often the ABV, hops, additional flavors etc etc try to complicate an already great style. Pike kept it simple and perfect. Well done!"
"Not very black, somewhat of a muddy brown. Decent roasted aroma. Strong anise smell as well as dark chocolate and espresso. Great blend of flavors-strong roasted presence with a very long and lingering licorice presence. The anise is quite upfront but not unpleasant. Powdery cocoa sort of flavor. Nice mouthfeel-prety much in line for the style and abv. A LOT going on in this beer at only 7%. I have not seen Pike beers for several years and for the asking price this is a great beer. Looking forward to the next one in my fridge."
"Good beer Pike, look forward to trying others."
"On tap at Pike brewery. Pours dark brown hue with a tanned, thick head and much lacing. Aroma is of espresso, roasted, malt and some dark fruit. Medium, smooth body. Coffee, dark fruit, toasted malt and earthy hops fill the mouth. Quite complex, well done stout."
"O- American style Stouts have taken awhile to become my favorite style and it has taken awhile for it to be a style that I’ve leaned to be a favorable beverage of choice when it comes to beers. This However brings something different to the American style and you know i appreciate the effort. So if given the chance i will purchase it again! Good beer for its style.."
"Overall a tasty beer try one if you can. I can see this brewery comin up."
"It was typical in the mouth and medium bodied. This brew falls in the middle of the pack as far as Stout's go. No greatness or unique characteristics to be had, though nothing out of whack either.."
"Overall this was a very drinkable and very smooth stout"
"22 oz. bottle. Brewed to 1.073 with pale, crystal and roast; hopped to 65 IBUs with Chinook, Willamette and Goldings, and fermented with English ale yeast. Nice and black, with a dark tan head that leaves light lacing. Fruity, earthy and hoppy in the nose. Tastes of acidic and bitter charred malt, with citrusy and fruity hops. Quite bitter and very burnt, with a long roasted and charred finish on top of a thin, moderately-carbonated dry and chalky body. Easy enough to drink, but too light, harsh and acidic for a full recommendation."
"The beer is a bit lighter than I expected, but it still has a good medium body and a slightly creamy texture. The flavors are smoke, roasted and burnt malt, coffee. It then transitions to lots of dark roasted malts with a sweet cream character. The finish introduces some bitter flavors from the hops and the aftertaste is like a heavily creamed, dark-roast coffee. A really good stout."
"SkÅL!"
"Basically it blew me away because the classic deep dark roasted malt flavor was there, but was so easy to drink."
"Pours a thick pitch black with a nice 2 inch beige head that fades to a small cap. Nice foamy lacing all around the glass on the drink down. Smells of roasted malt, coffee beans, cocoa powder, and faint whiffs of alcohol. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, strong espresso, and an earthy grain taste. There is a strong bitter astringency after each sip. Good carbonation with a medium body. Creamy and smooth in the mouth. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but the bitterness is pronounced and detracts from the beer in my opinion."
"O - quite drinkable alone or with food."
"Well, I must say this is a good beer, not familiar with the brand but hey good none the less."
"Overall, I had high expectations for this beer and I was delivered a smoky pork/bacon dry bitter mess. Not sure why people like consuming these flavors in beer, anyway. Not recommended, compared to the numerous better available styles available."
"This is a very nice stout and I look forward to future brews from Pike Street."
"Surprisingly, given the color and smell, it is surprisingly light in terms of body- leading to it being fairly drinkable."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer pours a thick, viscous, jet-black color, with a thin, dense tan colored head that has great retention as you drink. The nose is strong in coffee and chocolate while you are pouring, as well as when you smell from the glass. The flavors are dark roast coffee bitter with a blend of milk chocolate. The flavors are carried on a light, dry body. Coffee aftertaste with a bitter essence left in mouth. The finish is smooth and creamy, but lingering. Delicious! Makes a tasty float or brownie, also!"
"Definitely a must buy and must drink. I haven't had anything else from Pike but this would make me like to try others."
"I only wish it was cooler inside so I could enjoy it more. This is a damn good beer!"
"D: In the new realm of bomber pricing being able to get a beer at this ABV and quality for under $4 is a steal. It looks like Pike may be coming into CA into a big way, and if they offer deals like this I'll be buying. It reminds me a ton of Deschutes Obsidian, if you like that beer you'll be a fan of this one for sure."
"Pitch black base with a 2 finger tan almost milk chocolate colored head. Smell was roasted malts and dark chocolate (maybe a touch of sweet dark fruits). Taste was similar to smell with dark chocolate dominating and lingering forever. Mouthfeel and drinkability were good. As this beer warmed up the bitterness was a little much for my tastes. Overall, solid brew and would enjoy another pint in the future."
"D: On the whole, a well done, drinkable stout."
"Overall this is a great beer and i plan on stocking up to keep this stuff on hand!"
"Remarkably drinkable for the style."
"Mine is 6.6% abv though..."
"This was a tough one to mark: there is now such a plethora of flavourful, charismatic stouts on the market that I can sometimes take them for granted. This may have been one such occasion. Nonetheless, while it may not have warranted top scores, it is a beer fully deserving of praise, recognition and most definitely a (repeat) purchase."
"Quite a good beer. And for the price, this nearly cannot be beat."
"D - It's drinkable, just nothing too exciting and I am going to be bored with it before I finish this bomber..."
"This beer is smooth and a bit creamy, with a dry finish. I'd gladly open another if I had one, which must say something for the drinkability."
"Pike Street XXX Stout pours an absolutely opaque black with nice chocolate milk colored head. The aroma has some coffee notes, some dark chocolate notes and dark malt qualities. The body is appropriately thick. The flavor is very nice, not only are dark chocolate and coffee like flavors very noticeable, but a very nice citrus hop flavor runs right through it. An excellent stout."
"D: I remember going to the brewpub in Seattle about four years ago and had this on tap. I'm glad we get stuff from Pike out here now because it's cheap, it is all solid, and I now get to re-live a bit of nostalgia from my past."
"D: It's solid and serviceable. That's about it."
"Had this last night. And what a wonderful stout it was. Poured the typical black and left a 1.5 finger dark tan head. Smelled awesome. Big malt roasty scents of smoke with a touch of molasses. Taste was beautiful. Smokey roasted malt bordering on the taste of burnt malt. With hints of coffee and molasses. Finishing of with a smooooth finish of a touch of hops that lingered on the palate along with the coffee. Mouthfeel was a little thin for a stout. At 7% the alcohol was not noticed but it made its presence known on an empty stomach."
"Pours a blackish body with large light brown head that dies slow and leaves lace. A malty mixture of black chocolate, caramel, bread, roasted and coffee along w/ hints of toffee and wood all are in the aroma. A real malty taste, much like aroma, as a thinner, smoother, creamier stout passes over tongue than expected but still packs a sweet taste. Chocolate, caramel, vanilla and possibly figs or molasses seem to pass my tongue as well as roasted, bread and wood notes so this is a balanced stout that has a sweetness and finishes dry. Just a well-crafted sipper w/ nothing extraordinary about it but a great sipper that I relaxed with."
"Smooth rich/full body with a taste that lasted and was very enjoyable. I should bought more of these when I was on vacation, since they are unavailable in Ohio."
"Smooth with a rich, medium/full body with a light, upfront effervescence. A somewhat warming brew with a drying finish. A smoky, toasty malt aftertaste lingers for a long while as does the slight coating of the tongue. A very nice beer, all 22 oz. of it."
"Notes: A nice export stout but I don't think it stands up to Guinness Foreign or Cisco Capt Swain's."
"I like this beer, but I'm not wowed by it. It tastes like every other Extra Stout I've ever had. I dare say that most people would have a huge problem trying to decide what is what in a contest between Pike's and Guinness Extra Stout. Nonetheless, it is a good, solid beer, and I'll buy it again."
"This is a real delight, I'd like to have another half dozen to sample at three month intervals, but certainly interesting enough now and one to savour and take one's time to enjoy. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is actually quite good. I'm suitably impressed by this stout. Didn't go into it expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. A respectable ABV and a pleasing flavor make this a great beer to share with friends."
"D: Very drinkable, would be able to drink this fast and very recommendable."
"Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with light carbonation and was incredibly easy to drink. Complexity is definitely not needed in this beer, as the flavors were readily identifiable and tasted well throughout. If this is available around you, this bottle is easily a candidate for a nice session. We all enjoyed this one pretty well. eXXXcellent. (ha!)"
"[Metalmonk's Fun Corner: when you review this, try typing five X's in a row, just as in the name of the beer, and hit Review. It won't save! Won't let me anyway. Only comes out as three X's. The hell of it all, I tell ya.]"
"Had a bomber of this with my dinner at the local Vietnamese place. Paired pretty well with my beef and bok choy dish that was very spicy. One of the better foreign/export stouts I have had the pleasure of drinking."
"A meaty stout. Tons of strong flavor and some subtle flavors."
"Very drinkable -- the coffee and chocolate are well-balanced and offset by just enough sweetness to keep the bitterness in check."
"Mouthfeel is very full and chewy. A very drinkable stout. This was a bargain when I bought it in VA. I should have bought more. Excellent beer."
"The unveiling revealed....Pike Street XXX Street Stout! Never even heard of these guys. Awesome!"
"This was staring me in the face as i entered TW in the Pines today. In fact it was among a cornucopia of Pike bombers. This is one that I picked up, let's give it a whirl. For starters the 7% ABV has me fired up. Popping the top, I get a delicious smell of roasted malts, notes of cinnamon and some black licorice like alcohol smells. Pouring into a trusty pint this brew pours like motor oil! Jet black and thick with high viscosity. In the pint it is as black as night with a substantial foamy tan head. There is not a speck of light coming through this brew. On the taste, the first standout is the mouthfeel, thick and smooth like motor oil, not that I've actually dranken motor oil, but just like it poured. The taste itself is a very roasted malt flavor with a cinnamon and black licorice flavor in the middle, just as the smell lead to believe. Very mildly bitter only slightly sweet, very roasted and finishes tarty. This would be great on a cold day, very hearty and robust with lots of body. A solid brew, for the price at TW a steal. I'll be picking this up again."
"D: Not much to look at and nose is rather plain but this one is a hidden gem for sure. Feel and taste are incredible. Very smooth with good complexity. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: Overall a pretty decent deal (I think I paid $3.99 for this at Total Wine) for an decent beer. Nothing Earth-shattering, but really solid."
"salud!"
"Very nice, very robust Stout, big aroma and flavor on this one."
"Love this beer. Been staring at it for year and never bought it. What a fool I've been. Highly drinkable and very enjoyable. Glad it is a bomber. Try this."
"Pours a nearly opaque black with a big brown head with strong retention. Aromas are predominately sweet, with dark chocolate and toffee notes followed in the strength by roastier notes; rather mocha-like. Taste is considerably more bitter, although it's initially sweet before showing assertive roasty and charred elements and finishing with strong espresso flavors that grow in bitterness as they linger. Body is quite smooth and a pleasure to swish around. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who likes stouts on the more bitter end of the spectrum."
"Rather nice stout. Worth drinking."
"7.0% abv. per bottle label.65 IBU's."
"D- Overall, Pike XXX Stout is the best beer in the Pike lineup that I have tried to date. I would not mind purhcasing this beer again. Definitely worth a try."
"22oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a deep opaque black with a thin light tan head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasted malts and dark chocolate with mild espresso. The taste is smooth roasted malts with hints of bitter cocoa and fresh ground coffee, an interesting contrast to the aroma. The beer is fairly light and crisp with decent carbonation. This is certainly an enjoyable stout, I'll have to pick up another bottle to try on a cold winter night."
"- Overall a very underrated stout... something people should be raving about and asking for in trades... light, creamy and perfectly drinkable."
"D: A pleasant surprise and first try from this brewery. A bomber went for $3.49 and certainly worthy more so. A dark earthy and well rewarding stout that goes down nicely even at 7.0%."
"Taste is roasty-earthy and woody with some spicey bitterness and with sweetness and bitterness present but pretty well balanced."
"D: Great sipping beer due to the gravity and robustness, but hard not to just pound done because it's so good."
"D: I can't pound back stouts but this one is very drinkable. It's 7% ABV though one bomber may be enough."
"Hey, at $3.99 a bomber this stuff is certainly a bargain. Its hard to find quality beer like this at such a great price. I will certainly be trying more from Pike."
"Pours a dark black with a thin tan head that doesn't retain well. The aroma has some roasted malt notes upfront, along with chocolate and coffee, some dark fruits, molasses, and some burnt bread. The flavor is similar to the aroma with big roasty notes initially, along with dark fruits (plum, cherry), lower % dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, some burnt acridness and alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is decent. Overall a decent but unspectacular stout."
"D - refreshing, flavorful and surprisingly affordable. This may become a new standby stout in my arsenal."
"D: A nice, roasty, drinkable export stout which rings in just around 7% ABV. The alcohol is not detected in the strength of the stout, which is propelled by that nice malt blend and balancing hop bitterness. I would definitely get this again and would like to try it beside a gingerbread brownie or flank steak."
"Unfortunately, I didn't take notes when I tried this on tap, but I cannot complain about this being available in bottles."
"Nice job to the folks in Seattle!"
"Apparently Total Wine down here is carrying these exclusively (in the area). Right on. This guy pours an opaque black-brown topped by a nice finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, smoky coffee, cocoa powder, and some light raisins. The taste is pretty similar, with notes of figs, coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, light molasses, and a slight touch of leather. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and very smooth feel. Overall, a very nice and easy-drinking little stout; a nice change of pace from the overly heavy and chunky ones."
"Bomber from Total Wine in Orlando, $3.99. Poured jet black with a decent brown head. Left a lot of lace. Aroma of deep roasted malts and some chocolate. A touch of raisin and mild smoke as well. Flavors consist of roasted malts, and smoke. A subtle fruity sourness blended into the espresso bitter finish.Super smooth and medium mouthfeel, good carbonation. For the cost of this bomber I was expecting much less. What a pleasant surprise. I bought three bombers of other beers from this same brewery. I am now looking forward to them immensely."
"Pike Brewing Company--Pike XXX Stout. 7.00% ABV. 60 IBU's. Lacy espresso head. Rich roasted espresso front. Crusty chocolate Stout body. Crusty hop spice end. (4.0 / 5.0) 5 oz. Taster @ Seattle, WA Pike Pub & Brewery. Sampled 5/9/2010."
"D - very stout drinkable especially given the chocolate taste, and the 7% ABV is not at all noticeable, very solid beer all around"
"D - I had high expectations for this one, and it fully satisfied my expectations. Very pleased with this selection, would definitely buy this one again. Would also recommend this to anyone looking for a full bodied stout."
"Pours a reddish dark brown with creamy tan head, spotty lacing. Smell: roasty, a little smoke, dark brown sugar, underneath are leafy hops. Taste: roasty, green apple, molasses-light, earthy hopping. Feel is a little thin. Finishes sweet. Not bad, not great."
"D: This was not a bad stout, but it smelled much better than it tasted. Alcohol wasn't detectable, but the aftertaste wasn't very pleasant, so it was only somewhat easy to drink. Good not great."
"D: This beer is pretty subdued for its style and could be very drinkable for me if it wasn't for the off-putting bitterness. I will have to pick up another one of these and update my review to see if I just got an off-flavored beer."
"Mouthfeel is good. Not great, just good, and none the worse for it. I could easily drink a few of these in an evening and feel thoroughly satisfied. I like it."
"D - Great. Really presents the best qualities of the style without feeling too heavy."
"It has a silky mouthfeel, but not too sweet, and is incredibly drinkable."
"I enjoyed drinking this with a pepperoni pizza."
"Although sweet, this is still an extremely drinkable stout with a well-masked ABV. A nice American stab at the Foreign/Export Stout."
"drinkability: good overall stout and best beer of their lineup"
"Comes out of the bottle a rich, oily, opaque sable with a thick and fairly persistent fine-bubbled tan mead. Aroma is rich and smoky with firm tones of quality coffee and brown sugar - most inviting. Flavor is even better than the aroma - richly of roast fine coffee, unsweet chocolate and molasses, the flavors I like best in a stout. It is only slightly sweet and has a touch of bitterness. Texture is thick, smooth, oily and tingly. This is one lip-smacking stout, worth seeking!"
"Nice, solid stout to put your hands around. Even by the pint, this one wasn't hard to put down, & a very nice end to a good Seattle evening."
"Drinkability: good, this is one I would try again."
"Poured into a New Belgium goblet black with a one fingered tan head. Minimal lacing. Scents of chocolate and roasted malts. Not much of a hop presence in the taste, mostly smokey dark chocolate with nutty flavors on the back end of the palatte. There isn't a presence of alcohol, which makes this a good drinkable stout."
"D not bad not overwhelmed but this was nice would try again."
"Taste, licorice is more restrained, coffee dominates. Sweet. Hoppy. Bitter. Chocolate more on the palate than in the nose. Dry. Good mouthfeel, everything sticks. Drinkable, but a little pricey."
"D= Very drinkable. I could and would put down a few of these in a sitting if I had the chance."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a pitch black color with a creamy tan head, good lacing. Aroma is a bunch of roasted malts, coffee, sweet chocolate, a hint of charred wood, and a slight hint of citrus. Flavor is roasted malts, sweet chocolate, citrus, and a hint of smoke. Mouthfeel is full to medium, creamy, with a dry and heavy bitter finish. Good stout."
"Pretty enjoyable stout, especially for the price tag. Not all that complex, but very drinkable and a good argument for more export stouts."
"Solid pour with a black slightly viscous body and a relatively thin head. Smells quite roasty and with a heady dose of licorice as well as a slightly mentholated aroma. Satisfyingly deep and roasty in the flavor department with some fruity, vinous notes as well. Quite pleasant and on the roastier side of balanced. Quite smooth and very drinkable. A very nice beer."
"Overall a great beer right here, not my fav style but this makes me enjoy it."
"D: This went down easily. At 6.6, it's not too strong, but it probably wouldn't make the best session beer. On the plus side, I would bet that if you took your time you could make a bomber or two of this last awhile."
"D- A very solid stout with a nice flavor."
"I could see myself drinking this again it's worth trying for sure and doesn't break the bank."
"An excellent stout, exactly what im looking for, coffee and roastiness. I could drink a lot of this, my only qualm being the body is a little thin, could just more of it. Other than that, a stout i could drink all night, love it!"
"this brew is top notch"
"This is a very good export stout and I like the hop presence thrown in for added complexity."
"Drinkability: very good, but not exactly sessionable. I think with a little tweaking of the flavor I think I would be able to handle a couple of these in a row."
"My pint looked pretty delicious, very dark with a creamy tan head and a few larger bubbles dotting the top of the beer. Great head retention, plenty of lace. Nice aroma, sweet and roasty with a bit of leafy hops, toffee and chocolate. Moderate citrus bitterness up front balanced well with the sweetness. More caramel, chocolate and roast mid-palate. Lingering hop bitterness, a bit stronger than I expected. Full bodied with no alcohol presence, lowish carbonation, smooth and creamy. Great stuff and it went quite well with BBQ."
"Drinkability: This beer is so heavy its hard to drink the whole 22oz. Which is pretty much the point of extra stout brews."
"No alcohol hotness detectable at all .. mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Like a chocolate cake in liquid form. A great stout worth multiple purchases."
"A very good stout. Something I would recommend."
"Silky chewy viscous mouthfeel with a lot of roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, oatmeal, toffee, biscuit, roasted coffee bean and a huge bitter earthy hop flavor with some citrus notes. This is way hoppier than expected and kind of takes away from the silky maltiness that I liked so much. The finish is long and dry with some citrus notes but mostly earthy bitter hops dominate. Well masked ABV and smooth maltiness makes it pretty drinkable but the strong hop presence kind of hurts it in this area."
"Full mouthfeel, but finishes tannic with a puckery linger, which detracts overall."
"Hope to find some more pike... trade?! :D"
"I am pleased to say I'm impressed, in fact-overtly so. I was expecting a good beer not a great beer and I got a motherfu**ing bad assed beer. Great Black color with a Dark brown head containing different shades of caramel hues. Good lace and powerful taste after an above average black malty, roasty, chocolate-coffee head. Taste is very satisfying with roasted barley and black malt giving birth to the supreme espresso but mostly dark chocolate flavor that is bitter from the semi-sweet chocolate and also from the hops. I just now bumped the smell to a 4.5 because every time I go to take a drink the smell hits my nose first like a beer containing nanotechnology designed to offer the perfect beer tasting experience. I'm close to giving taste a 5. Fantastic mouthfeel that is heavy, chewy, silky and creamy at once. Bitterness like that which this beer offers only makes the finish much longer and allows the outstanding stout character to linger more often than usual. World class Stout!"
"From notes. Pours black, thin mocha head fades fast, plenty of lacing. SMELL is roasted barley, black patent, some sweetness, hint of heat. TASTE is roasty flavors up front, some sweetness from the malty base through the middle, then roasty and hoppy bitterness emerging for the finish. Coffee, chocolate and alchohol flavors add some complexity. FEEL is thick,full, rich and chewy. Some bitternes in the finish. OVERALL easy enough to drink for a full bodied, hopped up west coast stout. Flavor is bold for a moderately sized brew."
"Drinkability: An all around good example of the style, though a bit hoppy in a west coast way - nothing screams out at you but this is one well-brewed beer"
"D - This was a really good beer, but the mouthfeel did not really do this beer justice, but this was a still a good representation of the style"
"Pours a deep and opaque black, no light gets through, oily looking, thin big bubbled brown head forms, few spots stick to the glass as it settles to a thin layer. Smell is intense, lots of chocolate and caramel, licorice, brown sugar, lightly roasty, quite sweet, biscuits, dark fruit, figs, lots of depth. Taste is similar, big licorice character, chocolate, light roast, caramel and brown sugar sweetness, fruit middle, sweet in the finish, maybe a touch of vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, slick, with low to medium carbonation. Definitely a good stout, I dig this stuff."
"D - Great flavor and easy drinkability on this one. ABV is low enough to enjoy and still have another. I could easily drink this all night. Definitely the best version of a foreign/export stout I've had to date."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The stout appears an opaque dark brown color with a good inch or so of creamy dark tan head. The foam won't quit, lasting nearly the entire glass and leaving small wisps of lacing behind with each sip. Aromas and flavors consist of rich dark roasted grains, cocoa, bakers chocolate, mocha, roasted coffee, caramel, and even some vanilla. Approaching full bodied for the style with more than ample carbonation. Very nice!"
"Note: my bottle states 7% ABV"
"D- Very basic brew, but interesting enough to go through a bomber vigorously."
"This is a nice chocolate/coffee effort."
"Great looking stout. Pours near black with a silky tan head. Nice lacing. Nose has roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, molasses and hops. Taste also has a bitter hop, coffee and molasses presence that is well balanced by sweet cocoa and dark malts. Medium body is well carbonated, but a bit light in the finish."
"Perhaps not as flashy or extreme as some other imperials, but just a genuinely good, drinkable stout."
"-was an alright beer for sure, not ranking in any top categories for me, but i wasnt pissed by any means drinking it"
"Very smooth and easy to drink (a little too easy!), excellent flavor, excellent beer."
"This beer doesn't screw around with hops or complimentary malts. It just gives you a big blast of roasted malt, yet it is not overdone (O'Haras Celebration Stout is similar, yet it is harsh and in fact overdone). Very affordable in Alberta, I'll definitely be picking up more on my next trip."
"Completely opaque, with a nice sized head. Looks like a big stout should. Each time I took a whiff, the smell waffled between sweet/bready and roasted bitterness. There are 65 IBUs in this thing and they show up in the flavor. It is sweet up front, but there is plenty of bitterness here, both from the roasted and charred malts and the loads of hops present. Firm, yet smooth mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. It sat too heavy in my gut and I felt the alcohol too much for a good drinkability score. But, if its just one, this is a great beer."
"3.99 for a 22oz of a full flavored stout thats 7% abv. you can do the math. for a beer baron on a budget this is one of the most drinkable beers out there."
"This is an enticing stout and it draws me in completely. The bottle feels solid in my hand when it splashes in docile tones into the pint glass. It sounds and looks well crafted with an opaque brown color and an inch of creamy, brown head which stays together for most of the sampling. The aroma erupts with smoky chocolate malts in the tradition of a good Imperial Stout. The mouthfeel is bold and strong. The taste tickles the palate with coffee, chocolate and fresh hops. An impressive extra stout."
"taste is thick and creamy, bakers chocolate, some licorice, a touch of vanilla, and coffee, ends dry and a little bitter."
"Deep, dark cocoa--beyond semi-sweet--very bitter. Thinnish body, the only real negative. Long-lasting aftertaste of coffee grounds. Simply a delightful, heavy stout."
"D: Tasty stout but not a good value given that singles of Expedition and Old Rasputin go for $2.50-$2.75 in my neck of the woods. Good solid stout though that's worth a try."
"Pours almost black with an initial creamy brown head that dissipates into nice lacing. Smell is deep, rich malty with a nice smack of hoppiness. Taste is rich, with a creamy quality...coffe, burnt malt, hops...very tasty. Mouthfeel goes from smooth and creamy to a hoppy dry finish...good combination. It's a sipper, but extremely drinkable..."
"Medium-full body, with moderate carbonation. Smooth, creamy, maybe slightly chewy. Overall a very roasty stout. On the low end of ABV for the style, so no real warming or other alcohol presence is evident. If I had to cite a negative, I think a bit more body and creaminess would make this a really outstanding brew. Very drinkable, and with relatively low ABV could be good for more than one in a sitting."
"22 oz. Pretty dark brown pour. Limited dark tan head. Roast coffee, cocoa aromas, none of which is real strong. Very roasty flavors heavy with coffee with accents of dark chocolate and roasted malt, a little anise. Medium bodied, gets a bit creamy as it warms. A very strong coffee stout with a very dry finish. Coffee lingers. Pretty drinkable with nothing off putting for the style. A good solid version of a foreign stout."
"Pours deep, dark brown with a head that dissipates quickly. The smell is more sweet and fruity than anticipated, with some caramel and roastiness as well. The taste is very bold - a big, malty forefront with notes of dark chocolate that is followed by some very noticeable hop bitterness. It ends crisp, with some lingering brown sugar and ash taste (in a good way), which definitely has you coming back for more. The mouthfeel could be heavier, but the carbonation is appropriate. A pleasant experience overall."
"This beer poured a thick opaque black with a three finger, almost sudsy looking medium brown head. Head retention was pretty decent, left a thick film with spotty lacing on the glass. Nose is dark roasted and some burnt malts, chocolate malts, and toffee. Taste is of the burnt, roasted malts up front, deliciously bitter at the forfront. It then gives way to a creamy chocolate taste in the middle, and ends with the sweetness of caramel malts and toffee. Based on the pour, I expected this to be a thick, heavy beer and it wasn't! Body lends to be a bit on the heavier side of a medium bodied beer, but not extremely filling, decent carbonation, chewy mouthfeel in the middle with a nice dry finish. I could sit with a few of these on any given evening."
"This beer pours a totally opaque motor oil black, with a copious amount of foamy light tan head, that leaves lacing around the glass as it recedes. It smells of roasted chocolate malt and cafe au lait. The taste is floral and citrus hops, roasted malt, coffee grounds - a nice dry bitterness - and mild warming alcohol. The carbonation is quite muted, and the body is rich and velvety, with a medium weight. It finishes dry and smooth, with a note of mocha lingering. I quite enjoyed this - big flavors, but not too heavy in body or ABV to slow down my rapidly increasing pace."
"D - goes down smooth and easy."
"A dry bitter stout, similar to a dry London porter. Not my particular taste for mass consumption, but it seems to hold its own in that particular flavour profile."
"Roasty coffee flavor is balanced by dark fruitiness, licorice and a fair amount of floral hop bitterness. A touch of alcohol in the throat makes this a pretty tasty foreign style stout."
"Mouthfeel is fine for a stout, and the drinkability is easier because the mouthfull isn't that heavy"
"An interesting take on the stout/x-stout style and I rather liked it."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer, although with the ""weight"" of it, I could maybe only handle! three at a time. Definitely recommended if your in the area!"
"I brought this back from a recent trip to Seattle and very glad I did."
"This comes across as being a very big beer, but stays a bit more drinkable than the RIS/Double Stouts out the by not being too high in abv. Even nicer than I had hoped for."
"Pours a black colored body, watery looking, with a tan head, some good lacing. Has a strong aroma of some coffee, with some bitter coffee grounds. Has a coffee taste, some chocolate. Bitter chocolate. Pretty rough for me."
"Appearance looks to be a dark brown to black with a thick creamy firm brown head with nice lace. Smell of sweet dark malts, chocolate, molassas and dark fruits. Taste of strong coffee, molassas, roasted malts and the hoppiness balances nicely with the flavor. Mouthfeel seem viscous going down slick with a roasted malt bitter bite at the end. Robust is a good word for this one."
"D: all around nice and worth the buy. I picked up mine at the Belmont Station and am very happy with my purchase. This easily makes it into my large group of time-to-time regulars. Put on the ""Snappy Pants"" for this one!"
"I am sampling a cellar temp bottle of this beer poured into a pint glass. The beer pours pitch black with thin tan surface layer of head. Aroma is roasted malt and almost smokey mixing with some brown sugar and maybe molasses as well. No real hop presence or ABV hints either. First sip reveals a thick body with very fine and fizzy carbonation. Tight clingy lattice on the glass after each sip. Flavor is dry roasted malt almost coffee bean and some general sweetness. My palate dries out after each sip. Again the hops dont show up at all which is okay considering the style. No hints on ABV either. The beer is a bit of a sipper but only due to the body not any booziness. A well crafted robust brew!"
"Poured from growler into bubble pint glass. Poured with thick, rich, firm deep tan head. Solid head left thick, attractive lacing. Solid black color. Pleasantly rich aromas. Flavor follows aroma closely, with the roasty, toasty, goodness being everything you would hope for. The body and mouthfeel are what is expected from a great stout. The reason I didn't rate this beer higher is that it is so good, I feel it rates well against Imperial Stouts. I know it's inaccurate to do this, but this stout has earned the comparisons. Drink this beer."
"Pike's XXX Stout quickly launches into a rich tapestry of roasted aromas converging on cacao, coffee, and barley grain. It imparts a sweet malty flavor with ample roasted grain on a coal black body. This is a worthy stout of pronounced roastiness though I can't help but wonder if a nitro pour might deliver the final touch of grace in smoothing out the body."
"The excess sweetness kills the drinkability to me. I love the look and the nice bitterness mixed with sweet taste but the finish is way to sugary for me. I want a beer that I feel compelled to drink more then one of. Great flavors but a poor finish."
"D: If I could get this one, It would be one I drank regularly."
"A good, hoppy American-style stout. Personally, more body and more chocolate character would be appreciated, but overall very satisfying."
"Black pour with a bit of a dark red tinge to it and a small to medium tan head. Sugar and toffee in the smell, very thick and inviting. Heavy malt in the flavor with some caramel and toffee taste and some chocolate and coffee lingering in there as well. A very nice chewy mouthfeel that lingers on the tongue. A slight bitter finish, similar to but far more mild than a dry stout. Extremely tasty, hope to visit their pub the next time I am in Seattle."
"D: This big one's a nice sipper."
"Purchased: Liquid Solutions"
"D - Pretty good and enjoyable"
"O) Very yummy beer. I wants more. Welcome to Texas Pike's!"
"Drinks fairly easy, the complexity & dryness would make me want to move on after 2 or 3. Good take on the style, brings back memories of drinking this at the beach during those ""frigid"" (well some times the trade winds would kick up..)winter evenings on Oahu"
"Very flavorful for what it is, and a solid mouthfeel and drinkability. Very nice stout."
"This is one powerful stout. Weighing in at 6.6% (per the label), I wasn't expecting it to be quite as strong. It's an excellent brew that really evolves as it warms and keeps every sip interesting. The 22 was barely enough... i'm hooked. Definitely worth a try should you get the opportunity."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I like the balance. The roast is a bit acidic for my taste, so that detracts from this beers overall drinkability...but other than that, it is a really presentable beer and a good example of the Foreign Extra. I would drink this beer again, but probably not after a Koelsch like I did tonight."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Taste like Guiness to me. I'm ok with this one but they make a better bier."
"D: This bottle clocks in at 6.6% abv rather than the 6.0% listed in the description, but it remains eminently drinkable. Two brown bombers would go down w/o much effort. Too bad I won't another bottle this side of the Bay Area or even further north?"
"Poured into a Corsendonk Christmas Ale glass a very nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger fizzy tan head, which left some small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is big and malty, lots of dark chocolate, toffee, and caramel, with some figs, raisins, plums. The taste is sweet at first, big malts, dark chocolate/fruits, slightly bitter, with a dry finish. Full-Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a awesome tasting brew, surprised the shit out of me, never really cared for the Pike brew's, but this is an exception, highly recommended."
"[EDIT: the bottle held up well, consumed on 10/21/08. Excellent flavor & appearance, although the aroma is slightly diminished from the bottle. Mouthfeel not as bitter and strong, drinkability is the same.]"
"The taste was filled with bitter coffee and semi sweet chocolate. The roasted malts lingered on the tongue for some time and left some enjoyable bitterness as well. Overall a pretty good domestic stout."
"Thanks to DHGranstrand for this bottle in a recent trade. Pours like midnight with a decent sized tan head. Nose is like molasses and tar, but really there isn't a whole lot of it there. Flavor is thick with molasses tones. Noticeable roasted aspect to it is there. Nice thick flavor profile that stays consistent. Just a slightly biting carbonation to it. Liquid is slick. Pretty nice to drink on this one. A very robust and well made stout. A nice sipper and a pleasure to drink."
"I poured this at about 60 degrees. Surprisingly, not very aromatic even at that temp. Very strong flavors though, nicely balanced with nice hoppy finish. I will definitely buy more of this."
"An excellent stout. Highly recommended if you can get it."
"Great drinkability for a hopped up stout, thanks to dnichols. Pours black with active character, above average mouthfeel. Hoppy without overbearing, and still balanced roast and chocolate that are lively and citrussy. King of hoppy stouts.Refreshing."
"D: This is pretty drinkable for a stout. Nice low ABV, smooth if a bit bland."
"D: The medium body, low ABV and smoothness make this an easy brew to finish. The moderate biting aftertaste is not a deterant making this a fine session stout."
"pours black with the slightest red light around the edges of the glass. Nose is of roasted malt, a little bit of smoke (very little) and a meatiness. Taste is mostly roasted malts with some slight coffee grounds and a bittersweet hop finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but ok. Good roasted flavors make this one tough, but overall I think i could drink a couple, maybe three. A good session extra stout. good flavor."
"Served at cellar temp."
"I've had it again a couple times since, this time in bottled format. This beer really serves as a template for the style."
"This was my first experience with Pike. Many love this brew and probably one of their better brews. Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium brown foamy head with low retention but good lacing. Aroma of roasted malt is pretty dominant with some light coffee notes also noticeable. Taste is quite dry with limited chocolate and coffee note and a medium bitter finish."
"Overall a pretty good stout, Malts are overpowered by hops imho. Couldn't drink more than a pint or two, but I;m sure I won't have any trouble finishing the six I bought."
"This is probably the best experience I've had so far with the re-done Pikes, but it still won't jump to the head of the line when I next visit a beerstore, not until they dial down the bitter, soy sauce flavor a bit."
"Full, full body that slides down easily with every sip  low alcohol 6.6% makes this close to a session sipper. No hint of the booze. Try one! Im impressed with my first Pike offering."
"Pours an opaque black with a couple fingers of slow dying chocolate milk head that laces sheets as it dissapears. Smells of coffee grinds, dark chocolate and licorice. Taste is the same as the smell. Finishes with a bitter hop bite. Medium in the mouth with a nice tickle of carbonation. Drinks like a champ but is a treat not a session. Well done."
"Drinkability: Best beer in history? No, but it's a tasty, nicely drinkable stout."
"D: Moderately drinkable. Like the Kilt Lifter, the smokiness is a little much to make it a session beer."
"I'm actually blown away by this brew. Before I ordered the bottle I saw it had good reviews but I didn't expect this. A really wonderful unique stout."
"The mouth is not as creamy as I like, but this has a nice dry finish. This was a great way to cap off my visit to Pike. Minor complaint, I think they serve this beauty to cold. I waited several minutes to let it warm a bit."
"Notes: If this was available to me on a regular basis it would be a staple in my arsenal. Chewy malted goodness. It has the ""Bigness"" of a Imperial stout without the inflated alcohol. Loved it."
"22-ounce bomber supplied via the good graces of oberon -- many thanks for the opportunity, David! At cellar temperature, poured into a 17-ounce snifter, Pke Street XXX Stout is drop-dead gorgeous, with a massive and billowy esspresso-froth head atop a glossy onyx body. Delicious aromas of cocoa porridge with a faint metallic scent weave themselves among a sturdy dark-roasted grain presence that wafts forth with every sniff. Dark coffee bitterness at first, followed by a soured grain and chocolate character, and then...wow -- I did not expect that -- a puckeringly bitter grapefruit pith hop punch at the finish. This lasts well into the aftertaste. I suppose I should have known I might be in for a bit of hops with a stated 65 IBUs on the label. I must admit this detracts a bit from the experience for me as I was really looking forward to a dense roasty and chocolatey stout (with perhaps a bit of vinous quality). This stout is well-done, no doubt, but it's just not what I expected given its nose. Medium body and silky smooth, almost fluffy, mouthfeel. If I had another bottle of this beer, I would certainly cherish it and hold on to it until I had the particular craving for a big roasty stout that drowns the palate in PacNW C-hop flavors at the finish. A really great beer in the end, but caveat emptor and all..."
"Had this on tap over at Pike's Pub in Seattle where it was served cold (too cold for my taste) with a minimal tan head that dissapeared quickly. It was hard to detect any aromas coming off this beer, as initially served, but as it warmed up you could smell the roasted malt, and a sweetness that reminded me of either caramel or toffee. The color is a very dark brown that almost looks black in the pub lighting. The medium body and moderately low carbonation give this beer a smooth mouthfeel. The taste is nicely balanced between roasty malts and assertive hop bitterness with a pleasantly bitter finish. This is a very drinkable Export Stout."
"D: Complex smelling beer, however I could not stand the taste. I could barely choke it down, much too bitter, the taste reminded me of an asprin or some type of medicine disolving in your mouth, it was that bitter. I was pretty surprised with the reviews on this one, perhaps I got a bad pint of this one or a dirty glass or something. Would like to try this one again, from a bottle next time."
"Bottle courtesy of Tpaliga: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium brown foamy head with low retention but good lacing. Aroma of roasted malt is pretty dominant with some light coffee notes also noticeable. Taste is quite dry with limited chocolate and coffee note and a medium bitter finish. This is like an imperial take on a dry stout, which is probably not something that Ive really been looking for. Interesting but still way too dry for my taste buds."
"D: Very drinkable, although the roasted malts do leave a very dry finish on the palate."
"One of my favorite stouts to date."
"D: Pretty tasty stout from Pike. Definately worth the chance if you can find it on draft. Luckily I had the chance to try this offering."
"I reviewed this before but ownership has changed and the supposedly the recipe along with it. It is now listed as 6.6. I'm greatly enjoying this stout ... I watch as the liquid tumbles out of the bottle into my pint glass and think ""I've seen that body before ..."" Yes I have, I've seen it in some of the best Imperial Stouts there are, which would be Stone, Silver City, and Fish Tale. This being a Foreign stout still measures up to the aforementioned. The head is only a quarter inch thick but a lovely sandy color. There's also a bit of lacing going on. Nose beats you in the face with hammerfists of chocolate, cocoa and fudge ...it screams ""tap out wimp"" whilst in it's corner espresso and some roast bitterness cackle with glee. Man, this is WAY better than last year and I am absolutely loving it. Mouth is servicable enough but nothing to write home about. As far as drinkability goes, damn this is a special stout. If you like stouts this should have a parking space in your fridge. If it doesn't, then you're a pretender at the game of stout love."
"Brown-tan head with great lace. Opaque balck--nothing else for color. The nose had a single, clear roast, malt, no hop but some peat. Very sweet, roast, and a light smoke underneath with some raisins and dark fruit in there. The mouthfeel was a bit chunky, particles, clearly not filtered. Taste better than the smell, but overall a good beer in a touristy pub."
"This is a real treat on tap in a chalice on a cold evening. Big , black and coffee nosed, the beer stretches its burnt malt legs after a few sips and takes you home to bed. I love a big stout that is not too high in alcohol as you get all the mouthfeel without the headache."
"Not had this in the bottle, but I'm sure it can't beat this on-tap."
"Cheers."
"One very nice stout!! Yum! Thanks C!"
"Bakers chocolate, coffee and roasted malts pop out in the aroma, but overall the aroma is less intense than my ideal. Poured a very deep black with a dark prown/purple tinted mocha head. Fore is full of dark roasted notes along with chooclate, plum, molasses, raisin, bourbon and even some Brown ale nuttiness. A whole lot of flavor points here. Finish is laced with cream, chocolate, low bitterness coffee and a kick of alcohol. A damn fine beer."
"Pours black as night, no light gets thru. Has a nice creamy dark brown head and a nice little bit of lace. Very strong roasted malt aroma, with bittersweet chocolate and a hint of licorice in the background. A smooth chocolaty character up front. Sharp but creamy on the tongue. With a great nibbleing bitterness on the finish with hint of esspresso coffee in the background."
"Mellow"
"Jet black. No light can get through. Poured with a 1.5 finger tan colored head. Smells a touch earthy, a touch sweet. Taste is roasty up front with some bittersweet chocolate notes. I am getting a coffee vibe from it. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Great flavor and exceptional mouthfeel = great drinkability."
"Drinkability  Really good beer that I highly recommend. Superbly drinkable for the style."
"Nice foamy light brown head covers the deep dark brown hue. Candyish and spicy nose. Rich dark malts have minty and thyme-like vapors. You can tell its gonna feel creamy from the nose. Surprisingly, hops are not a big factor in this one, gentle cocoa roastiness are paired with an effective and complex nut array to create a globally spicy flavour profile. As weird as it sounds, I feel this would pair well with asiatic food. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, smooth texture."
"This beer pours a black body with a thick tan head that lasts throughout the glass. This beer smells of citrusy hops with a hint of roasted grain. Taste is of roasted grain, reminiscent of BBQ with a hint of chocolate, paired off against citrusy piney hops. Nice thick bodied. The beer is not that drinkable as a session beer it seems higher than alcohol than it actually is."
"Slàinte!"
"Very dark beer with light brown head which didn't stick around long for a stout. The sniff test managed to remind me of coffee, cream, cherry and liquorice. Tastes of an abundance of roasted malt. There is a really malty tang and smokiness, but no real coffee flavour (phew!). There is a hint of dairy and some welcome but ill defined hoppiness in the background. The feel isn't great. This doesn't slide down as smoothly as one expects a good stout to, especially since it only boasts 6% abv despite all those X's."
"I wish I was back in Seattle."
"A good stout ,very drinkable and not too heavy."
"A small, brown/toffee-colored head. The beer pours black, dark brown against the light. Smells of sweet chocolate with some coffee. Bitter chocolate in the tangy, sweetish front. Middle is quite thick, only hinting at sweet cream. Smoky, bitter chocolate finish. Coffee in the aftertaste with psycho bitter carbon. It's good. Very bitter, roasty... almost charred. It sweetens and develops more chocolate when warm."
"Pike Street 5X Stout is another excellent stout from a largely unheralded U.S. craft brewery. It's too bad that the vast majority of these fine beers are unavailable to those of us in fly-over country. This one would be in my regular winter rotation if it was readily available in Iowa. Recommended."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle it gives very little head. The beer is a nice dark brown walnut color. The aroma has lots of red wine, cherry, and almond. I can only describe the flavor as a sour stout flavor with hints of chocolate and toast. There is a bit of sweetness at the beginning, but the sourness takes over."
"2002-2003 Bottling - It is dark black with a sweet aroma that smells of coffee and raisins. It tastes of roasted coffee and slight chocolate in the full thick body. It is smooth and sweet in the finish with a lot of complex fruit tastes (plum, fig, raisin, etc.)"
"A stout well worth finding and trying..."
"This brew pours black. Well it's a stout what do you expect? It's black, it's dark and there are some ruby edges to it when the light is there. The head is thick and light brown.The aroma is weird. Where is this 4.15 rating coming from? Has some coffee notes but nothing standing out really. Body is on the thin side. Flavor is bitter and reminding me of that nasty Java Stout from Bells. Has some roasted malt flavors and more like spent coffee grinds in my opinion. The bottle reads ""Limited Release"" and let me tell you,it should be as limited as possible. Try again Pike."
"Update  I had a 2005 vintage in May and found it to be very consistent. This is about as good as it gets here in Seattle, and this wonderfully brewery is just a few blocks from where I work."
"This poured dark black with a small caramel colored head. The aroma was of coffee, malt and smokiness. The taste was quite bitter and much like old coffee that has been on the burner a little too long. The mouthfeel was okay. There was a little too much bite for a stout and a strong bitter and burnt taste. I am not likely to try this again in the near future. I think I'd go for the Guiness nitro bottles first. I've really enjoyed most other stouts more than this one from Pike Brewing."
"Pours with viscosity noticeable. Appearance is black. That's what I like for my XXXStouts. A medium sized creamy compact brown head is erected upon the pour. Lacing comes in sheets. The aroma is burnt malts and smoke predominantly. Almost seems to be a barrel aged quality on the nose. Decent nose. The taste is of roasted malt and beechwood smoke. Not sure if they use smoked malt or not, but it's sure got a smoky characteristic. The bitterness of this beer lingers. Hop attributed as well as burnt malt. This one's got a little of that char and tobacco thing going on. For an XXXStout though, I was looking for this one to be a little more intrusive. It tastes just fine, but I was looking for more. Body is a little better than medium and the mouthfeel is somewhat creamy. Good beer overall. Not much more though."
"2001-2002 Bottle: Nearly back with a medium and slightly foamy dark beige head. Thin lacing. Aroma of roasted coffee and a hint of malt. A little richer than most Dry Stouts, I like what they are going for with a blend of Dry and Imperial Stout in the body. Coffee flavor really comes through in the flavor, along with some dark chocolate and roasted malt. The finish is dry and has a lightly hopped character. This might not be worth all the X's but it is still a good Stout."
"2001 version. Dark black color, medium head. Roasted malts, some hop bite. Flavor is full, coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty with a slight bitterness. Very similar to the 2000 release. The flavor is slightly less intense, subtler in this release."

"Virtually jet black in hue, topped by a thin, but dense and persistent russet head that leaves intricate lace. Assertive barrage of sharply burnt unmalted barley and smoked tinged espresso hits the nose at first, then diminishes slightly, allowing rich, yet rounded chocolate malt to lend a distinct mocha impression. As the beer breathes, buttery malt and slightly salty tamari notes lend an odd, yet enjoyably savory sensation. Akin to a more robustly malty Shakespeare Stout in aroma without the grapefruit notes. Continuing nearly seemlessly, smokey, smooth dark roast coffee bitterness upfront in flavor yields to softer, citrus laced hop bitterness. Mocha surges in after a brief deliberation concomitantly with toffeeish dark caramel malt sweetness providing deep malt presence that would be dessert like, if not for the pronounced, well integrated, persistent burnt bitter component. Fruitness is subdued, but complementary, providing a mellow, imperial esque pruneish contrast. Moderate in body, with a light, yet soft and velvety mouthfeel conducive to easy quaffing. Finishes satiatingly cleanly bitter and rich, not unlike hopped espresso cut with Irish Cream. XXXXX is an absolutely delicious stout that only improves as it breathes. It approaches the depth of overall character of a good imperial stout, but packages it into a relatively light and highly drinkable brew. Reminscent of a Full Sail Imperial Porter meets Rogue Willy Shakes. Its excellence precludes satisfaction from a 12 ounce portion. A bomber would be most appreciated."
"Dark as the cloudy moon-less desert sky, the head a velvety chocolate crown, the lace a shield against the light. Sweet toasted grains, bitter-sweet chocolate and a over cooked pot of coffee, what the hell else could you say to describe this nose, start is ambrosial, the top thick and chocolate like. Finish has a spiteful hop spicy bite, the acidity stinging, the aftertaste bitter chocolate dry and one damn fine stout in my humble opinion."
"The smell is reminicent of coffee, with a slight suggestion of malt. The flavors of coffee, roasted barley, and some more coffee. The mouthfeel is significant but clean. The mouth is left dry though, and wanting. If coffee was this good...."
"Beautiful dark appearance. The body is a completely opaque black and the head is a creamy orange-brown. It drops quickly to just a collar and thin surface covering, but it leaves some very nice lace as well. The aroma expresses a sharp fruitiness, but it's not exactly the ""burnt currant"" aroma that's so common to the style. I expected it might lead into a tart flavor, but there's nothing like that here. With further investigation and a few swirls of the glass, some smokiness and even light caramel become apparent. It's not a really complex or rich aroma, but it's quite intriguing! The body is full with a mild and exceptionally fine carbonation that's silky smooth across the palate. Quite velvety! The flavor delivers the fruitiness promised by the nose, but it's awash in rich bittersweet chocolate and espresso-like roastiness. A bold bitterness balances and dries things out in the long finish where a distinctly smoky and acrid roastiness lingers. An exceptional stout that stands out for its unique character. Well worth seeking out!"
"Nice pour, deep opaque black with an easy, thick creamy head that clings to the sides of the glass. It's not exactly long-lasting, but it never fully fades (ends up thin cream layer that's too thick for a film, but kind of like a like coat of moss or lichens). The aroma is a little weak, but roasty. The flavor is as strong as it should be but it dominated and unbalanced by too much burned bitterness. A bit of smokiness lingers underneath. The lack of balance makes this less than a joy to drink, but intriguing at the same time."
"Thanxxxxx, jreitman."
"Opaque black beer with a dark brown head.  Exactly as advertised in that it is an over the top stout.  Roasted coffee and some good hop bitterness dominate the flavor.  Chocolate is hidden well but can be discerned (or imagined).  Sweetness is kept to a minimum.  Very enjoyable and interesting brew."
"The head could have been better, specially with the thicker body but the flavor was right on the mark."
