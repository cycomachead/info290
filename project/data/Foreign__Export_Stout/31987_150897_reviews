"great beer with a nice khaki head, smells of dark chocolate, coffee, burnt malt. taste similar. chocolate, coffee, slight dark malty sweetness. no bourbon detected...somewhat disappointed in that, however, still a delicious beer."
"The beer pours black with a gray/tan, tightly packed head around the perimeter. The nose is mainly milk chocolate sweetness with minimal bitterness or coffee. The taste I'd compare more to a porter than a stout - roasty and malty, slight coffee presence and yeast, minimal booze or bitterness. The beer has a medium body, reasonable carbonation, and a very drinkable malty finish. I'm not picking up much from the special coffee beans used to make this beer, which is disappointing. Though it's not mind-blowing, it's still a solid beer."
"Very full body."

"Overall: this is so easy to drink. For a stout that 7.5% ABV, I really enjoyed this. The smell became stronger and fragrant as it warmed up, the flavors were rich with a strong roasted character, and the mouth-feel added another dimension."
"Good bit of coffee, could have more.  Mild bourbon.  Some roasted malt.  Little bit of chocolate."

"O- The astringency is pretty high in this and is on the verge of off-putting, but this is otherwise a very substantial export stout that smells amazing. It also helps when this is served at cellar temperature rather than straight out of the fridge- when it's chilled, all you get is the astringent burnt coffee flavour."

"O - A very unique and complex beer that drinks much bigger than its 7.5% ABV. Seek this out. This would be an outstanding dessert beer or after-dinner drink. A real sipper, as the bourbon character is surprisingly rich, even though this beer is not barrel-aged. Interesting, to say the least."

"Pitch black with a deep brown head that is well carbed.  The smell is Folgers or your basic office coffee.  The mouthfeel is fairly thin and so is the taste. You get a fairly cheap coffee flavor with some roast from the malt.  Not sure the barrel aged coffee beans added anything.  Perhaps it muted the coffee."

"This is a pretty unique take on a coffee stout and I really enjoyed it."

"22oz bottle pours a blackish dark brown color with a half inch of medium brown head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and maybe a hint of bourbon. The taste is dark chocolate, roasted malts, black coffee and some wood. Nice hint of bourbon with some warming alcohol. Vanilla and nuttiness near the end. Finishes with dark chocolate, coffee and light bourbon notes. Light mouthfeel. The Bourbon soaked coffee beans creates a nice balance between the chocolate, coffee and Bourbon flavors. Overall, fantastic beer."

"Overall: this is definitely not your everyday stout... or coffee stout... or BA stout. This is certainly richer than Black House, but I don't know that it's better, and I don't think it's quite as tasty as Monsters' Park. Still worth trying if you see it."
""

"Proof positive that bourbon barrels don't make everything better, I much prefer Black House to this beer. The barrel aged beans somehow contribute a high pitched astringency, sharp wafts of black marker and burnt matches, and a palate almost cloying in chocolatey sweetness, more black marker/black licorice/and weird phenols. Black House is a pretty solid coffee stout -- I'm surprised that MT has missed on quite a few of their other stouts."

"pours beautifully. aroma is devastatingly pungent with incredible roasts, cocoa, vanilla. flavor matches the aroma, deep and sweet."
"Loved its roasted complexity. If you like Stouts that are coffee forward, you better to try this."

"I'm not sure how this beer is categorized as a foreign stout, but it is damn good. For the ABV, one of the smoothest, richest and most balanced beers I've ever had in the stout category. For someone who loves coffee stouts, this is a must-try."
"I gotta get my hands on those coffee beans, they make a big impact with this one and it works great.  BB coffee beans?  wish I thought of that"

"Such a wonderful beer. The nose is a blend of cocoa, chocolate, roast and a minty coffee character. Hints of vanilla are present. The palate has a blend of smooth dark chocolate, roast, some oak and the most incredibly unique coffee character I've had. Super green, mildly earthy, very floral and very minty, this is fantastic. While this alone would make a beer interesting, the structure and the integration are quite spectacular. I'll have to get more of this,"
""
"O - I hate coffee and was pretty bad IMO. Very robust coffee, bitter towards the end. Just everything that makes coffee, well coffee, also is the primary factor in this beer. I won't have it again. Although I hate it, I""m not docking them on points, I've had enough stouts to know."

"Overall: This is a tasty and complex little brew. Its on the verge of being World Class, maybe a more richer body? The flavors are balanced and not clashing on the taste buds. This is one to seek out and worthy of your time. I love how the Coffee Roast is both intense yet not going overboard with acidity. This brew is Recommended!"
"One of the better coffee-flavored brews I've had. Potent in every way. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Baron's Market on West Point Loma."

"Really interesting, some times no BA have a hard time being up to snuff, but this is realy great _ I get a lot of berry flavors with some subtle oaly/vanilla too.  Good"

"This rich stout was amazing...had a real chocolatey, malty kick to it...amazed on how rich the flavor of the aged coffee beans that where used..."

"Pours a pitch black with a one finger, mocha head. The smell is quite unique. Rubber, coffee, there is definitely a bourbon presence,  but it is not accompanied with vanilla that i would expect. The flavor is very roasty. It's interesting to have bourbon flavor without the wood aging. I like it a lot. There is no booze present,  which is kind of refreshing."
""

"O: This beer improves as it warms, took a drink straight from the fridge but as it sat some of the nuances came through. There is a nice fruity coffee aroma and flavor but I did not get much bourbon, it's not bad, one I would not pass up but I mostly likely will not seek this out again. If you love coffee stouts and barrel aged stouts, then this one is worth a try but I think there are better coffee stouts and barrel aged stouts out there, and this one ranks really low for me."

"Delicious coffee stout. Not usually a huge fan of stouts, but this one was so flavorful with pleasant bourbon and cold-brew coffee notes that I had to love it."

"Not to my taste, I think it's the booziness."

"All I can say is wow, the barrel aged coffee in this gives it just the right amount of bourbon character."

"This is a very confusing beer. It has the look and scent of and BA Imperial stout, but the taste is very smooth with a hint of booziness associated with a BA stout. Mouth feel is the same as Black House, light and crisp. This is a very solid brew."
""
""
"A very nice stout with great coffee flavor."
""
"I feel that this brew is misunderstood. Having had some of MTs barrel aged coffee, I know where they are coming from with this one. Its the beans that are barrel aged, not the brew. You really pick that up on the nose. Very smooth and mellow beer. Definitely worth a try."

"I had high hopes for this beer but it was disappointing.  Looks nice; dark brown with a finger of khaki colored head.  The aroma is really odd; kind of a charcoal or burnt wood chips and something I can't place.  On the taste I get the barrel and then the burnt flavor I got from the smell.  Some mild bitter chocolate and finishes very nutty.  This beer could benefit from some more sweetness and I don't like over sweet stouts but I feel it's needed here.  Don't really get any bourbon either.  Mouthfeel is pretty standard for the style.  I was really pumped up to drink this and was hoping for more coffee.  You get a small amount of coffee in the form of burnt coffee beans but that's about it.  I am a big fan of MT's hoppy offerings but the Monster's Park was disappointing and this one follows the stout disappointment trend unfortunately."

"Nice looking beer - black with a dark brown head and good retention. The aroma is of vanilla, burnt oak, and burnt coffee with a smoky note. The spirit character is strange - somewhat sharp and harsh with an almost sour flair. The flavor is acrid burnt coffee and astringent oak with some chocolate and vanilla. Again, the spirit character and oak are unpleasant, though the chocolate and vanilla provide some respite from the acrid coffee. I could do without ever having barrel aged coffee in any form again."
"Serving type: bottle."
"22 ounce bottle. Really liked the bourbon soaked coffee bean aroma and flavor on this. Very smooth, floral and fruity. Gonna get some more."
"This coffee bourbon stout sets itself apart from the rest by avoiding the alcohol and the booziness that typically is associated with bourbon barrel aged coffee stouts."
