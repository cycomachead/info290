"really heavy on the coffee and toasted notes. a really good export stout."
"Just ok for me.    Not a beer that I would buy a case of."
""
"Good coffee notes followed by a roasty aftertaste."
""
""
"O: A great FES with some nice layers and depth of flavor. The 8.5% goes unnoticed, which makes it all too easy to drink. A solid seasonal indeed"
"4.03/5: It's as good as the song, and that's high praise"
""
""
""
"I did not get a chance to sample this the first time it was brewed.  I'm glad that I got a crack at it thye second time around."
"The style is right on, just not really my style."
""
"A fantastic  stout/ale almost as flavorful as the NITRO from the same brewery."
"Surprised by this one expected a below average beer but this drinks solid nothing crazy but it drinks pretty well nice work here"
""
""
"Final Thoughts: In a marketplace flooded with breweries pumping out IPAs it's sometimes easy to overlook one that does such a fine job on darker beers. First Milk Stout, then Wake Up Dead, now Fade to Black will be another reason to commend Left Hand for putting out great beer. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
"O-This is a very solid foreign export stout. I think this one nails many of the true characteristics of that style, while amping up the ABV just enough to put a new-world craft beer spin on it. It may not be as complex as many BA offerings, but it drinks well and the drying finish is nice change from many stouts out there."

"O- Great aroma, flavorful and drinkable."
""

""

"Smooth with a nice finish"
""
"Overall: Got this as part of a 'random' case, although I've been pretty impressed with Left Hand's Milk Stout before now. This one really scores in the taste stakes, and has a bit more depth than their Milk Stout. Definitely a winner - I'll be seeking this one out again for sure."
"O:  Just a terrific pick from Hop City, Birmingham.  Not sure why I grabbed it, but Left Hand never fails at great taste.  Would drink again."

"This black beauty is exactly why I keep falling in love with the Fade to Black series, one release at a time. Silky on the palate with notes of cardamom and licorice, this brew warms up with espresso and molasses on the finish. Cloud-like head and a well-developed perfume contribute to make this a sensory experience not to be skipped."
"Fade to Black is like the best dark beer series....EVER!  I am glad they re-produced Vol. 1 as I missed it the first go around.  This one is a very nice stout.  Has all the characteristics that one would like.  Definite must try!"

"This beer pours an extremely dark brown color with a one finger tan head that flattens out and floats on the top.  The smell is of chocolate.  Poured the beer at about 40 degrees.  The taste at that temp was dominated by chocolate.  as it warmed, the taste became more bitter.  I preferred this beer c"
"Pours a pitch black in color with a thinner beige foamy cap. A little sediment was seen in the bottem of the bottle after the pour.. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of dark roasted malts and black espresso for the most part. More going on with the taste with the black coffee right up front followed by the roasted malts that leave a bitter dry finish with a good amount of smoke. Didn't last too long but it was there and a bit much for me. Really didn't taste the alcohol but you could tell it was in there. A heavy-bodied brew with perfect carbonation. It came out of the beer cooler at 36 degrees and on the side of the label it says: ""Enjoy at 50-55 degrees F"". I will say that it did taste better when it warmed up some."
""
"Been looking for the perfect smoked beer since I went to a beer festival and had one which I could never find in the beer stores. THIS one is the ultimate!"
"It tastest like charred meat. Not a real pleasant taste."

"O - A nice stout. Lots of strong roasted flavors. Definetly worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Look: Deep brown, nearly black, underdeveloped head upon pouring. Smell: Strong aromas accompany this one, roastiness and booziness among them. Taste: Generally roasty and sweet malty quality up front with alchohol towards the otherwise mellow finish. mild hops profile. Flavors blend nicely."
""
"Very good stout. Left hand makes great dark brews"
"Just determined I'm not a fan stout beers"
""
"Chocolate nose. Taste chocolate, coffee, smoke, earth, malt and a hint of isopropyl alcohol. Dry finish."

"It tastes like eating the dirt from my own grave. Instant coffee crystals."
"Good beer, tastes a lot like milk stout"
""
""
"I was anticipating a lot from this stout.  S/some roasted malts with some coffee notes very average.  T/started off with roasted charred malts followed by coffee and a huge bitterness that just lingered.  O/I was expecting a lot more from this stout.  The coffee is nice and mild which is a welcome difference for me.  It starts off great and just abruptly ends.  It builds up without an exciting finish.  The stout was kinda watery and thin feeling.  The bitterness did subside as the stout warmed.  Overall it was enjoyable but not memorable and I would not seek this out again."
""

""
""
""

"O: A solid stout overall. Big roasty/charred flavors. Not as rummy-sweet as I tend to expect from the style, but that's fine. An enjoyable drink all around. drinks far too easily for its size."
""
""
""
"Pours a thick black with 3+ fingers of brown fluff that eventually all but disappears.  Nutty and sweet with lots of nuts and dryly toasty malt flavors.  Thick with a medium body and a creamy, slick feel.  Pretty drinkable.  Neither the best nor the worst.  Reminds me a lot of their milk stout (mainly the underlying clean sweetness of it). Might have again.  Worth a shot."
""

"Black coffee color with a light laced nutty brown head on pour.  Smells of roasted coffee. Tastes roasted with hints of chocolate with the taste going seamlessly from sweet to bitter in a single gulp.  Light and refreshing feel in mouth. Overall a very nice stout, particularly for anyone who likes their coffee black as it has strong taste and aroma notes of black coffee. The feel is different than expected from a stout, but not in a way that detracts much, rather it's just something special to remember as the light stout."
""
""
""
"12/22...pick a six pickup. Pours black, brown edges, low foam. Milky, creamy milk chocolate nose. Light sweet blend of coffee roasted with a quick dry finish. After bitter. Sweet open hard bitter close, no middle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Midnight black with a hint of tan head (light lacing). Interesting notes on the nose... bit of rye, some chocolate, dark malts, some roastiness too. Tasting lots of rye, and balanced bitterness. Rather light flavor-wise, but refreshing for a stout. Could go for this in the warmer months... light to medium mouthfeel. Tasty, good, but not something I would chase down. Worth a go if you like stouts."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/9/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, light pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, light pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Good amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, light smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Foreign stout style. All around great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"It's not a stout I would drink all the time.  After the one, I wouldn't want a second even though the first one was very good.  I think it's the finish.  At the end of each swallow you don't get that satisfying, lingering good taste in your mouth.  If I saw this beer in the store I would pick up a bottle or two to drink occasionally.  It's an excellent stout, just not a ""go to"" stout."

"Overall (4.15): This is a fine textbook stout. It has a good chocolate and roasty base with a nice smoky undertone. Something in the finish is lacking for me, perhaps not enough lingering, robust aftertaste that i prefer. This does improve as it warms however. The nose drew me in though. If you see this on the shelf its worth a shot."

"looks like they brought back volume 1 this year, which is great because i never had a chance to try it when it first came out. its big for even an export style, lots of booze in here, but you cant taste it. less black in color than some of the others in the series, but real dark and slick looking, holding an off white inch or more of light airy fluff. the nose and taste are the same, heavy dry roast, black espresso, and chalky textured cocoa. i like the deep dark complexity, and like how the beer is only a little fuller than medium body. it allows the drinker to experience the flavor without the density, uncommon for sure. longer lasting in the finish than i usually like, but its not due to sugar, that malt char character from the aroma is back on my tongue in the finish, mildly bitter and very earthy. great beer, maybe y favorite in the series. nice to see it come back around."
""

"Aroma is nutty, with huge caramel overtones, becoming milk chocolatey mid scent, and finishing lightly roasty. Smells pretty sweet. Notes of tar are subtle, as is the dark fruit character, but they open as it warms. Flavor is roasty throughout, with a bitter finish that is slightly charred. Sweet chocolate upfront becomes nutty in the aftertaste. Underlying dark fruit notes of tart cherry add intrigue. It's a bit more charred and bitter than I'd prefer."

"0-	Very drinkable stout. I would have this one again, for sure."

"It should be noted that this beer is 8.50% ABV but you would not guess it is any higher than 5% from the flavor of the beer."
"Overall – A rather tasty and dry stout with a nice dark and roasted flavor. The mainly dark and bitter body was balanced by just the right level of sweetness, making for a nice roasty brew."

"Addendum and edit: I aged one of these and it was quite a bit mellower and better integrated after a year, improving the alcohol hit."
""
""
"Overall - wow, I think this may be better than Vol. 2 which I have had previously. Really drinkable and a shame that it has been a one-and-done brew to date. Just one more finger pointing at the mastery Left Hand has shown over their ability to produce quality, drinkable smoked beers. Keep 'em coming Left Hand. This is the kind of stuff that has made you one of my favorite breweries in the country."
""
" ~ What more can I say other than go find yourself one of these retirees if you can. This beer, while aged appropriately has given true value to my cellaring project. I am extremely pleased and would not hesitate to recommend this fine beer to a friend."

"This beer poured out as a really nice deep black color. The head was fluffy and fan colored. The smell was roasted and a little musty. The taste was rich with chocolate and roasted malts, it was a little sweet at first and then fell into a dry bitterness. The mouthfeel is very smooth and leave a nice creaminess in your mouth. Overall I was glad I picked this one, it was one of the better stouts I've had in a while."
"O - Underwhelming all around. Bear in mind I'm comparing this to GOOD stouts. I'd say that it's on par with a Guinness. Pretty good, but nothing to write home about."
"Overall, this seems to be a pretty good example of an export stout, and I shall rate it accordingly. Wish I had a bottle of Vol. 2!"
"The body is what impressed the most. Thick, full, and creamy. Very drinkable."
"Overall a pretty solid brew. I traded for this a long time ago and then lost it at the back of my beer fridge. A solid beer for sure but nothing extraordinary. I wouldn't mind getting more of this but I wouldn't go crazy seeking it out."
"O - Pretty good. I liked this one, the flavors are well rounded and it is quite drinkable, but it really wasn't anything mind blowing, just a solid export stout. It fits the style to a T."
" The Foreign export stout has lots of roast as indicated by the nose w/ mild smoke in the flavor w/ gentle grain astringency and subtle yeast fruitiness. There is some coffee-like earthy qualities with a finish that is semi-dry. I really enjoyed this - a quality strong dark brew overall. It fits the style well and has nice malt layers w/ a very drinkable quality as it opens up. I could enjoy this beer repeatedly."
"The mouthfeel feels a little thin for the style, while carbonation is on the lower side. Drinkability is good, I really liked the roasty, burnt, dark chocolate, bitterness it brought in the finish. Pretty nice beer overall."
"Wow! Left Hand Path continues to make great new beers! This beer pours a dark amber color, with a hint of burgundy. It pours smoothly into a snifter, with minimal head, a light sugary aroma, and almost zero carbonation. This beer is thick but smooth. A very good brew."
"HV"
"Going to put a few of these in the cellar to age and re-review"
"D: smooth & easy to drink. A sessionable stout if there ever was one."
"D: Not always my favorite style, but this was a pretty good example of it. Definitely higher in alcohol than I was initially anticipating, but it does not really show itself."
"k,"
"A very enjoyable way to end a drinking session. I'll try this one again."
"D - very drinkable and enjoyable. Turns out it's pretty strong -- coulda fooled me, until I stood up!"
"This was probably my biggest surprise of 2009. I'm very glad I saved a bottle.. now on to Volume 2.. but I really hope I haven't seen the last of Volume 1. Amazing beer, highly recommended."
"Not a fan of Left Hand at all but this is downright decent. I would drink this again."
"Poured into a tulip. The color is definitely pretty close to black with a nice head. The nose brings quite a good amount of dry, roasty malt characteristic of the style. There is some light chocolate and coffee behind that. Roasted malt comes back after those diminish. The taste follows the pattern of the nose with a really strong roast presence. Takes of the feel is well, that's for sure. Drinks pretty well as everything comes together in the end. A good beer but not quite what I was expecting after all the hype."
"Left Hand is no stranger to high-ABV stouts. Their Imperial Stout is amazing stuff that deserves more love than it gets. Volume 1 of the Fade To Black series is delicious beer that can hold its head high when lined up alongside the heavy hitters of the style."
"First sip is remarkably smooth - very creamy mouthfeel, and the roasted malts are nicely integrated into the beer. There is a nice coffee like flavor that is not harsh in the slightest. Hops are minimal. Alcohol is very nicely disguised. I'm quite impressed with this one. It is not very sweet which really makes this beer very drinkable."
"Overall- An amazing beer from Left Hand. Though I drink Left Hand from time to time, I'm not a huge fan of their line but this beer is great. I sincerely hope they make this beer a year round beer versus a one off."
"This is quite drinkable given the ABV. The bitterness adds to the drinkability as I am not turned away like with some sweeter stouts. This is a worthy beer."
"D - This was a really nice stout...great chocolate and roasted malt flavors with hidden alcohol...perfect for dessert...looking forward to this years release"
"Verdict: The inaugural Fade to Black is solid and easily drinkable big Stout. This was one of my favorite new winter seasonals this year and I'm looking forward to seeing what these guys brew up next winter."
"Drinkability: A solid beer, and one I'm glad to have tried. The 8.5% was completely buried - it was neither seen, heard, nor spoken to. I can imagine - from someone who likes milk, as my drinking partner does - the astringencies of the toastiness and the slight sourness here (surely not an infected batch) combining with the milky notes to suggest spoiled milk, but I quite enjoyed this one. Not a crisp, refreshing beer, to be sure, but one that suggests good things to come."
"Drinkability: Goes down easily for an 8.5% on a midafternoon summer day. I'd have this one again for sure...I just wish the smell were less like sour milk."
"D - This is a solid brew by Left Hand! I kinda wish I had picked more up when I found it. I will certainly recommend this one to my friends."
"Would get this again."
"Follows the aroma closely. Roasty up front, then the malt sweetness comes in. Hints of chocolate, not really much coffee flavors. A firm bitterness in the finish that combines with a minerally character - this bitterness can be a bit sharp, especially when its cold. Mouthfeel is slick and oily, but the carbonation is a bit bubbly. Definitely full bodied."
"Overall a very enjoyable, complex and user friendly stout. Nice manageable ABV."
" Very Nice Product!"
"""There is nothing more for me," need this brew to set me free! Ah, classic Metallica...nothin' quite like it. ...Maybe some classic Megadeth, but this brew ain't named for no Dave Mustaine shit (make no mistake, I love Dave's work). My clear glass fades to an opaque brown-black following the pour, with more than an inch of khaki foam on top. With a sniff off the top, I ride the lightning that is the combination of roasted malts, cocoa powder, and some light smoke. Wherever I may roam, I will still recognize the taste, consisting of dark coffee, smoky cocoa nibs, a vague bit o' bitterness from the back, and a tiny hint of vanilla. The medium body, light carbonation, and smooth, dusty feel recall memories of the day that never comes (yeah, I know it sounds paradoxical, but that day is/was/will be prtetty damn sweet...). This kind of high drinkability ain't my bitch, but I wish it were. A tout le monde, trust me: this brew is mighty tasty."
"Tasted from a twelve ounce bottle. Pours an opaque black with a medium light brown head which dissipates quickly but leaves plenty of lacing. Smells of super dark roasted malt with dark chocolate, coffee, and a hint of molasses and plum fruitiness. The coffee and chocolate come through on the palate with the addition of anise. There is really no sweetness whatsoever in this beer. The alcohol is kept in check until the finish, where the heat lingers for quite a while. The body is surprisingly light considering color and alcohol content, due to the lively carbonation. It seems out of place. The finish is long. Overall, this is a solid beer, but the palate throws me off, and although the flavors are spot on, the out of balance alcohol is a negative."
"D: Not the biggest fan of the style but I enjoyed this beer. Glad I drank this when I did."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. I read in a few other reviews that this was completely black but I didn't have the same results. When initially poured it looks close to black, but when held to the light, it looks like a dark amber/brown color and looks well filtered. At first there is a slightly darker than tan head that goes away pretty quickly, no lacing to it after it goes away. In my opinion the smell is the best part, it has a lot going on, but its still good. Big time roasted chocolate malts, a very ""roasty"" aroma as well. There is also a very distinguishable smell of coffee as well. In the midst of all that it even finishes with a little hoppy smell. The taste is good, but doesn't balance itself quite as well as the smell does. It burned chocolate malts dominate the taste. The problem is that it's just barely too bitter for it's own good, I think it's between the coffee (likely espresso actually) and the hops. I think with some slight adjustments in the ingredients, the taste would be close to flawless. The mouthfeel is the my least favorite part of the beer. The tastes is much like a stout/ale combination which complicates the mouthfeel. It tastes much like a well hopped stout, but doesn't feel like one, it lacks smoothness. It's not bad, but it just doesn't seem right. However it does add to the drinkability factor, it's very drinkable. All in all it's a very good brew, would be outstanding with maybe some slight changes."
"All in all, this is a very good stout. I haven't had other Foreign / Export Stouts, so I'm not sure if this is representative of the style, but I enjoyed the chocolate/coffee characteristics mixed with the pine aroma/flavor. This is one of the best Left Hand brews which I've tasted, and I'll be looking forward to its release next time around."
"Beer poured black with ruby highlights when held to light with a decent tan head. Nose is roasted malts with hints of smoke and coffee. Taste is very good, extra roasted malts with hints of licorice and molasses. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty smooth. Drinkability is very good. This is a rough and tumble beer with big flavors that has that hook that makes one come back for more! Will definitely look for this in the future!"
"Pours from the bottle a deep black color, topped nicely with about a finger of fine cappuccino like foam. Aroma of coffee, cream and roasted malt. On the palate, I get more of the above, along with some nice dark chocolate notes. A very easy to drink beer, full of flavor and short on pretension."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, very silky and smooth. Goes down real easy, thanks a ton Alan!"
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. good depth. this is one damn tasty FES! now where can i get some more?"
"Notes: It has some nice flavor. Not that super dark roast that I was expecting, but a nice creaminess that was enjoyable."
"drinkability: seriously thought this was an imperial stout when i ordered it. makes sense now."
"Brown/black in color with a medium body. Awesome aromas of coffee, waffle cone, and bakers chocolate. It starts out subtle and smooth on the palate and then delivers in a big way on the promise of the aroma with an explosion of flavor on the finish. Overall an excellent beer I wish was available year round."
"A nicely complex brew that is dry and finished with a clean bitterness, this is surprisingly easy to drink. The high ABV is well hidden, and this beer could be a wrecker if you don't pay attention. They don't list the alcohol content, and it comes in a six pack for a cheap price, so it would be easy to assume this is some run-of-the-mill stout until the buzz kicks in. Great stuff, I enjoyed this thoroughly, too bad it's only going to be a one season thing."
"D: Strong beer that I could have a few of no doubt even with the higher ABV"
"Overall an excellent beer, but I've got to consider this somewhat of an imperial stout based on the ABV, and I don't quite think it's a standout in that style."
"Really good job, LeftHand, one of your finest efforts, in my humble o."
"Hands down, this is the best Left Hand solo brew I've had. The only one better was the Terrapin collab 'Depth Charge.' Grab this one while you can!"
"A very nice stout, would buy again."
"Good session beer from Left Hand."
"i would even like to buy you one. let me know if you're up to it."
"D - This brew drys you out very quickly. Recommended for anyone who really enjoys stouts or porters which big presence. A great beer for special occasions."
"Drink ability was great. For such a strong beer it was very sessionable. Really good beer that I look forward to trying more of, definitely recommend it."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer had a dark black color as the name implies. The beer poured a brown head. The beer really did not smell like anything. However the taste was coffee and chocolate that I think would have been great but the alcohol was just too high. It blew every nice flavor away. Not going to buy again."
"Overall, one of the better big stouts I've had recently. Just about everything was done right with this. Kudos to Left Hand for this. I have five bottles left and expect to spread them out over the next oh, I dunno, couple of years. Can't wait to see how this ages. Should be fun."
"Overall it was a very good beer, and I gotta say, i'm a fan of the label."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall- A very tasty stout with a gnarly kick of alcohol! Nice balance between roasty malt and chocolate malt flavors. Decent balance between hop bitterness and malt sweetness, though definitely more geared towards the dark, roasty, chocolatey malt side. Wish I would have come across this before the winter was all but over! Very much worth a try, especially if you need something to take the nip off of a killer winter day- or if you are in the mood to have a good time skiiing or sledding!"
"On the thinner side of the mouthfeel. Definitely not a heavy beer. Although, it still is somewhat smooth. Very mild booze in the taste too. A TON of coffee beans in the flavor...and slightly over roasted coffee at that. Carbonation is mild to low. This beer reminds me more of a Porter by characteristics. Overall...a pretty good beer!"
"Aggressive pour gets you two fingers of foam, plenty of larger bubbles break up overall density, medium tan in color, any lacing is super-thin rivulets. True to its name, black as coal, nothing more to say on this score. Burnt coffee, black licorice, bittersweet baking chocolate, fried fresh butter, roasted chestnuts, the nose almost starts to show some hot tar notes, invasive nostril presence, mutter of figs or dates, the hoppy kick pretty much lost until the penultimate moment. Full-bodied, even more bitter and acrid in the mouth yet, somehow, this ends up being a positive. Coffee, coffee, coffee, dark chocolate, chicory, slightly burnt breakfast biscuits, licorice, wish they added some milk and sugar rather than serve it black. The carbonation has some swirl to it but too fine to do much. No fruit nor citrus, spicy ending with pepper and cumin like flavors. Hard not to admire the purity of purpose here, however, this is not a beer to pop open for casual consumption."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a creamy light brown head. Smells strongly of chocolate. Taste is very dry for a 'big' stout, chocolate and coffee flavors throughout, with a dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, slightly high carbonation. Very good drinkability I would get this again for sure. Very affordable and good value for the money."
"D - Great Stout, definitely would buy this again"
"Future outlook: Nice, solid beer that I'd be glad to have again."
"The flavor is an improvement. Gone is the sourness and Carmex, and what is left is a roasty malt profile that is akin to a magnified version of whatever watery version of Guiness is tapped at your local bar. Some dry oak underneath. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability is average simply because the complexity is not there to justify the high ABV and the roastiness becomes grating about halfway through. Overall this does nothing to break the monotonous mold of the style."
"drinkability: good"
"D: really nice stout, definitely a surprise for a sampler, definitely will have this again next time I'm in Col."
"Fade to Black's flavors really develop as it nears rooms temperature. Give this one a chance be all that it can be, and it becomes one of the better FES's out there."
"Drinkabiliy was good. No ABV presence. Good balance with a nice, roasty finish."
"Overall, an excellent beer and another home run from Left Hand. A most welcome addition to the lineup and can't wait to see what they do with this series. Highly recommend. Rotation - we should be getting here in TX very soon but buddy shipped me one now just in case. Once available, I'm gonna need to get several 6 packs of this before it goes away. Part 1 in a series. [heavy; one time release]"
"Drinks incredibly easy for the abv, this a very well put together export stout, well done Left Hand!"
"Great drinkability. The ABV could be real sneaky. I would absolutely have this one again."
"D- haven't had a ton of export stouts but this seems to be quite a fantastic example of one. A great stout regardless of style. Nicely done left hand."
"D- This is a style I not very familiar with at all, but really enjoyed what tehy did here with the flavor profiles. SHould be mindful of the ABV, as it does not fully declare itself. Recommended."
"Well done."
"D- I could drink alot of this. I'm sure I will revisit it often."
"I don't usually go for stouts, but this one was fantastic! It pours pure black with a caramel colored head. Aromas of coffee, bitter chocolate and chickory explode from the glass. As far as the palate goes a veery well balanced stout. Malty, creamy and toasty"
"Fade to Black is certainly black. It's a very dark beer, almost a little thick I thought. I didn't really care for this beer. I found it very hard to drink. It was certainly a flavorful beer, but maybe a little too flavorful; too much going on. Fairly bitter as well. Obviously, I'm in the minority here, but I probably wouldn't drink this again."
"This is a very well balanced brew that surprised me. It is quite tasty and definitely a great after meal type beer. I like the spiciness and vanilla notes as these pair well with the rich Stout flavors. The roast character is also well balanced by the up front malt sweetness."
"D and overall impression: Drinkablity is rather nice given the 8.5% ABV tag. Overall, this is a very good offering from the guys at Left Hand. I think the coffee could be tuned down a bit, but all in all this is a brew that I will pick up again. Skal."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It appears to have a near perfect malt scent. It's roasted on one hand. It's dry and earthy on the other. There's also a nice chocolate component as well. The taste is good. It has a very nice black malt flavor up front with a big chocolate malt blast and a bit of roasted malt character in the finish. To call it complex is an understatement. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good beer. I'm not getting a huge roasted character which is standard with export stouts, but this is a delicious beer that's highly drinkable."
"Drinkability: As I mentioned earlier in my review, I love stouts, and as such had 3 goblets of this fine brew before I recieved my meal, a steak burger, which it paired perfectly with. It goes down smooth and its rich dark taste hides its ABV, making it dangerously drinkable and incredibly enjoyable."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I am having it for breakfast, so it is a little roasty on an empty stomach, but it is a good and pretty well balanced beer nonetheless. I will definitely drink all of this beer and if it is available in Houston someday, I wouldn't mind picking it up again. I'd give it a shot, especially if you like Stouts."
"Overall a very nice beer, not sure on the style but it was a nice drinker and I was able to put down several without much issue."
"D: it is a tasty beer and would have rated it higher, but I am not a fan of noticeable lactose in my export stouts, reminds me of a milk stout. does not taste true to style. More like left hand milk stout on steroids."
"Taste was also extremely balanced. Roast, malt, bitterness, and just a bit of alcohol all sit in nice proportion to each other. This isn't a big assertive imperial stout eventhough its alcohol strength isn't that far from an imperial stout. This is a beefed up balanced, easy to drink dry stout. Really nice and easy to drink."
"This is a very good stout and another great beer from Left Hand."
"drinkability - Very tastey, enjoyed this beer a lot."
"D - Sorry but I can't get this down, too many foreign elements for me to enjoy."
"Well here yah go, this is why we are doing two peoples opinions. From the pour to the last sip, this was Dos's beer all the way. As stated before, I'm not a fan stouts, and this is a stout to EVERY sense of the word. Big coffee and smokey. Almost as if Smokey the Bear was drinking a cup of coffee that was left on the burner all day. Not for me. Ill try to stay fair with the rating since im sure Left Hand did a good job with this one."
"I'm very glad I got to enjoy this brew.. It's loaded with rich dark flavors and the aromas here are ridiculously delicious.. The whole experience was terrific.. Very nice export stout.. Very drinkable although at 8.5, it could hurt you quick..."
"Overall, I really like this beer, I don't think I have ever had a Foreign/Export stout, but this has convinced me to seek out more! Nicely done, I have a hard time believing this beer is 8.5%, It is very well hidden within this fine brew."
"On tap at the Rattle 'N' Hum. Roasty aroma, roast coffee. Slight white head, yet lots of white lace. A yeasty part that I didn't expect or like. I normally really like this style, and others do too, but I just didn't get it today. On the too sweet side, with bitter coffee, not that well integrated."
"Drinakbility: I was a little hesitant about this one. Someone told me, ""It tastes a lot like Guinness."" That almost made me put it back on the shelf. Fortunately, the only thing it has in common with Guinness is that it is a liquid. This is a full-bodied roasty dream and I am glad to have it."
"Pours nearly opaque with generous light tan head that laces well and remains thick throughout the pint. Nose is a big roast-monster, nothing more... nothing less. On the palate there is a noted low carbonation but the big roasty flavors with coffee pick up center stage and carry the show. Don't really notice much hop influence. Finish is very roasty as well."
"Wonder how this'll age?"
"doubt I'll revisit, but wouldn't turn it down either."
"D: For the alcohol content this beer is quite drinkable since the body is lighter and the flavors are not overpowering."
"D: I think it's a great example of this style, but I would like to see it more extreme in the roasted/smoke fashion or up the sweetness. Not a bad brew though by any means."
"I am liking this one a lot. Incredibly easy to drink for the style."
"D: We have a winner! This is the best I've had from Left Hand PLUS it's at a great price compared to other great stouts I've had. Get it and pour it over ice cream. Nahhh."
"Color is a very dark brown that is nearly black. Around the edges where the light can shine through it is brownish. Pours with a finger of darkly tanned head. Head receeds fairly fast to just a thin film across the top of the beer and a little bit of spotty lacing clings to the glassware. Very strong aroma of coffee mostly with some burnt grains and hops. Taste is quite bitter from a mixture of hops and is heavily toasted...no, burnt grains. Lingering taste of strong black coffee and a nice dose of warming alcohol to boot. Feel is medium and has a moderate amount of carbination. I really enjoy this beer but it feels a little light and is missing more depth outside of the heavily bitter coffee/espresso character in both the aroma and the taste."
"Mmmmm...drinking it now, from a growler a week old from the brewery. Beautiful color and brown bubble clusters hanging to the side of my glass...granted, not that cool Left Hand glass in the photo, but a nice Cheeky Monk Belgian style glass. Nice swirling head...with a beer tasty enough, just looking at the bubbles can be fascinating. There's a lot in the aroma and taste, from coffee to light tobacco, chocolate, espresso, dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, yada yada... I first had this at a place called Jonesys in Denver...a neighborhood semi-fancy food drink joint with creative offerings. They have a modest but cool selection of brews, and this I hadn't had yet. I wanted a second but I was the DD with a long haul to the DenVUH suburbs....uh...have I run out of room left? How much ranting can I do?!! This is no wimpy brew...chocolate, liquroice, dark roasted malts, some bite, beautifully dark color and lovely rich aroma and taste for the big beer hunters of the world...lovely."
"There is plenty of big flavors in this beer and the complexity is showing much more than the nose would indicate. There is some toast and roast along with some sweeter, lighter malts that make for quite a wide range of malty flavors. There is a definite hop bite on the back end and a bit of bready yeast somewhere in the middle. Low on the fruitiness, which seems to work well for this style. Mouthfeel is noticeably creamy and oily, but not quite viscous. Alcohol feels about what the ABV is...there, but not overpowering. This is a pretty solid stout that is well worth a six-pack purchase."
"Pours a nearly pitch black color body, average tan color head, diminishing. Strong dark chocolate aroma, sweet like a milk stout. Bitter chocolate taste. Sweet. Some bitterness on the end, but balanced pretty well. Some bitter coffee taste on the end. Thick, not as bitter as it warms. somewhat chalky or something."
"Overall a night FXS not that I exactly know what that means...haha really a good stout that drinks like a porter."
"Poured into a pint glass from Datz in Tampa. (thank you roger.) At first glance the beer looked very dark. Then when investigated under a light, It was more of a deep amber, brown color. nice light brown head. Smell was very sweet, bit of dark chocolate, brown sugar, some hops notes as well. The taste was very similar to the smell. With a creamy texture. I was a dead tie for me with the blackjack porter. Very recommended."
"Beer pours a very rich dark color with a nice tannish head. Initial aroma is off roasted malts and a toffee type smell that tells you it is a big beer. Taste is full of the roasted malts and coffee and toffee coming through with a hint perhaps of molasses. An aftertaste of dried fruit and a touch of vanilla lingers after it goes down and gives a pleasant warming sensation. The beer is very smooth in drinkability, cannot taste the alcohol at all."
"D: This is a well blended beer. Flavors really compliment each other rather than dominate. I could enjoy another pint of this one."
"an easy to drink stout ,i enjoyed it and would pick one up again.cheers."
"D- Not bad. Very smooth on the palate and is definitely a dessert type beer due to the sweetness. Well worth the 2 bucks I paid for it."
"Overall this is one of the better beers I've had from Left Hand. A very smooth and well done beer for the style and one worth a shot."
"M&D - a bit of alcohol burn, but decently smooth,a nice blended flavorful beer, well balanced and hopefully the start to a great series"
"I was pretty impressed by this one from Left Hand. It is a nice flavorful stout that I thought was more in the 6-7% range. I think I'll have to pick up a 6er, good stuff."
"Nice, new beer from Left Hand. I look forward to Volume 2 next year."
"Pours a near black color that is brown around the edges. Frothy tan head that settles into a light cap. Aroma is nothing special, the most distinct aroma is that of milk chocolate. The taste is fairly sweet, kind of like chocolate milk, though not that chocolatey. There is some bitter roasted coffee notes towards the end. The taste has an almost refreshing quality to it; it doesn't taste heavy at all. Moderate feel, lighter than most stouts. Fizzy carbonation adds to the drinkability of this brew. Quite an easy drinking stout. The roasted coffee flavors in the end make it known that this is a stout. The ABV is no where to be found. Not crazy but very good."
"Medium-light body. Carbonation is appropriate. Fairly smooth, easy drinker. Not a terribly interesting beer, but quite solid nonetheless."
"FTB is very smooth for the style but it does not glide, there are some kinks in the road. The roast smoke effect is noted, but this remains pretty creamy. The carb does not sting in any way so it's at a great level, letting you know this is alive. I would not mind having a sixer of this lying around during the cold months. This is the first Left Hand beer that I enjoyed, finally."
"Overall, a decent foreign style stout. A little on the tarry side for me."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a very good stout to drink for a long time."
"Served in a tulip at Track 84. Poured the color of cola with a quarter inch, khaki-colored head that dissipates into a thin speckled cap. Head was refreshed with a swirl. Some delicate strands of lacing to start; however, no retention. Nose is roasty, a little sweet and suggests some lactose. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of coffee and chocolate notes. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation level and a dry finish. I haven't had too many Foreign/Export Stouts, and have found a great deal of variability in the ones I've tried. That being said, this is an incredible offering. If you like stouts and porters, seek this one out. The only disappointing thing about this beer is that it's a one-off."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer reviewed from notes. Served in a standard pint glass a decent almost opaque black that shows ruby highlights and is topped by a thin light tan head. The aroma is rich roasted malts and bakers cocoa. The taste is smooth roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate and fresh espresso. The beers on the heavy side of medium and is smoothly carbonated. This one is a very enjoyable sipper."
"Overall, just too much smoke and roasted malt in this beer. I don't mind a little when it comes to stouts, but this was over done. I don't think I would want to buy this again. If you like a lot of smoke and roasted notes, then this beer is for you."
"I am enjoying this very much. The 8.5% abv is well hidden in terms of taste ( though I feel it more and more as I submit this review.) It is surely a big beer but the hop and carbonation finish leaves me happy and thirsty for another sip. The initial transition from roasted barley to fruit and sweet bread is intriguing and I can hold on to the sweetness as long as I like before returning to a clean hop finish."
"The puns and other literary devices I've used to describe this beverage might prove more memorable than the liquid itself. As I continue trying to decipher what's here, I detect a charcoal. There's a smoked quality without any food-worthy flavor. Liquid charcoal has its place, but nobody wants to drink it! It's not that bad, but I know I've enjoyed a foreign-style stout before; this one, however, you should leave on the shelf."
"Mouthfeel is medium full, but could be fuller and creamier."
"Drinkability: This is a great export stout. A sneaky 8.5%. Alcohol is barely detectable. Very dry and roasty."
"Very dark and black in color with a small head that quickly settles to a thin skim of bubbles. Just a little spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma consists of burnt nuts with light chocolate notes. More chocolate and less nutty in the flavor. Really has a light, milk chocolate finish. There might be some fruit flavors in there but it is too weak to provide a description. Alcohol is barely noticed. Medium body but a bit overcarbonated. The carbonation would be alright in a pale ale but seems overdone in a dark, rich beer. A nice, enjoyable stout. The alcohol could sneak up on a person if they tried and make an evening with this beer."
"Overall this is a great Foreign/Export Stout with a rather rich flavor profile and great balance. Thanks again Chuck for throwing this one in the box! Recommended."
"D: Good. A lighter bodied stout with good flavor, but not overdone. Definitely drinkable."
"Drinkability is hurt by the taste, or lack thereof. Nice but not outstanding."
"D - Flavors are robust and complex accompanied with a great body. Alcohol is hidden greatly which is a good thing if you don't have anything important to do the next day. It took me weeks to find this beer but exceeded all my expectations. I can only hope this somehow turns into an annual offering (hear that Left Hand?)."
"D: Not being the biggest fan of really roasty stouts, I was expecting to dislike this one. However, the smoke and roast play off eachother nicely to create a good beer."
"D - I would definitely come back to this one."
"D - Sweet and roasty. Very nice."
"It covers your tongue with a silky warm feeling and slides creamy and smooth down the throat. This would great beer by the fire on a chilly evening with 8.5 ABV it warms you up quite fast."
"This just might be my new fave from Left Hand. At least as far as non-barrel-aged stouts go, anyway."
"Oh yeah, and it's black."
"A nice surprise at the store today."
"Drinkability: This one drinks like a dry RIS or Baltic porter. It is a nice full and heavy beer. It does get tastier as it warms. I like it, but I only have the desire for one more max per session."
"D - Tastes great, but the staleness really keeps me from wanting this over and over. Still a good brew to drink."
"Poured in my St. Bernardus Chalice a dark nearly opaque black, with a tannish yellow head that faded quickly to a light tan crown and film. Aroma is primarily of coffee malts with a slight presence of alcohol. Taste is the same coffee malts with some alcohol spiciness on the finish. Feel is lightly warm and gently carbonated. Definitely drinkable with great flavors and very enjoyable."
"Pours a cola brown with very minimal head that bubbles away quickly. Nose is coffee and a malted nutty finish. Also hints of chocolate and raisins. Taste is rather bitter with chocolate and coffee dominating the flavor profile. I'm not picking much more in the quaff. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty smooth. Overall a pretty good brew from the brewers at Left Hand. Not sure where they are going with the future brews in this series but i will look forward to sampling the others."
"Rich, strong, smoky aroma has tones of chocolate, fine coffee and molasses and just a shade of sweetness - very tempting and inviting. It pours an opaque sable that is just a red tomcat whisker above black and has a fairly thick and fine-bubbled light tan head. Flavor is absolutely fabulous - rich and mouth-filling, mainly fine roast coffee, unsweetened chocolate and molasses with a whisper of licorice. Texture is strongly fizzy and tingly, yet smooth and sublime. A must for anybody who loves stouts!"
"In all honesty I wasn't hoping much from this beer, as I feel some of the recent Left Hand outings have been less than stellar. That being said, Left Hand was one of the my first favorite craft brewers, and I've always held them in pretty high regard. The Fade To Black is proof positive Left Hand hasn't lost their touch, and I am fairly stoked about that."
"Great smooth and creamy body on this beer. Subtle carbonation on the tongue, but the creaminess just washes over the palate. Flavors are simple but very good. Chocolate flavors right off the bat, some mild espresso bitterness, and a dark fruity finish. This is a great beer. I downed this one easily enough and could have another. The alcohol presence, though higher, is not prominent. Recommend."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" mocha head above the barely translucent dark brown brew. Head falls at somewhat quick pace, with average lacing. Aroma is dark roasty grains. Taste is rich chocolate upfront, coffee bitterness in the middle, and closes with some hops character. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is good as well. Glad I got a few of these."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Cool label graphics. Poured a deep black with a finger of tan head. Pretty fragrant with lots of roasted barley and chocolate. Solid medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. Some malt sweetness to begin. Plenty of roasted malt bitterness along with some hops. Really long dry malt finish with lingering coffee flavor. Nice beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good for the style and goes down easy. I could see having maybe a couple of these at a time and wouldn't mind having it again. Overall a pretty nice example of the style."
"(D)- Definitely a tasty stout with some good things going for it. Lighter in body, but with a much much thicker texture. Just a solid drinking stout if you want something more than just having Guinness."
"A high-quality homage to Guinness FES. Strong and brooding, without overindulging in its sweet & roasted characteristics."
"Got the beer from the tap way to cold for this type of beer. So i had to wait a while just to take my first sip. A nice blackness to the beer as it was served to me with a light brown head on it. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Taste was of coffee and the bitterness of the chocolate to begin with, followed by a fruitiness and no real alcohol taste to it. The mouth feel was alright, slight carbonation and a decent thickness to it. I could maybe have had one more, but prolly not more than that. Nothing bad about this beer but nothing exceptional either."
"Overall a really nice version of the style."
"D: I was a bit surprised at first, what with the smoke/peat. But after one, I couldn't wait to have another. This is great stuff."
"D: It is a bit of a sipper due to the sweetness and weight. With that said, its very nice. It doesn't have the hops presence I would expect from an Export, but it does have that heavy roast for sure. It is a different beast from what I remember of the Guinness Export. Still a good tasting and drinking stout. Would absolutely have more and think this is a great offering from Left Hand. Reminds me of their collaborations with Terrapin."
"Retrying after one year in the cellar -- still a very bitter coffee punch with dark chocolate and heavy roast. Surprised the coffee flavors have held on so well. Wish I had bought more... A really nice foreign export/light RIS from Left Hand."
"d- deceptively drinkable. Abv is there but hidden. Smooth, not filling."
"This is a really good Export Stout. This reminds me a lot of Southern Stars Buried Hatchet. I have some in the fridge that I am going to pull out next to see how they compare. Highly Recommend."
"12 ounce bottle, has a place on the label for ""Bottled on"" info, but alas, it is blank...Pours black under a retentive dark khaki head, thick film, sliding sheeting down to a collar, respectable bits of lace, the hole bit, not a bad looking glass of stout...roasty, light coffee and dark chocolate nose...flavorful, very smooth/velvety on the tongue, with more then ample notes of more chocolate, roast grains and dark stouty goodness...nice first offering in this hopefully varied and fruitful series from LHBC...I believe this was about $12.99 for the sixer from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY...go get some and enjoy..."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Body is black as the night itself...off-white/beighe head recesses into this black abyss leaving the aroma of dark chocolate, coffee and toasted malts. Taste is thick, abv is well hidden, very well. Coffee and chocolate dominate. Nice complexity and very tasty. Nice timing on this offering, hopefully it will appear more than once."
"This beer pours a thick very dark brown, almost black color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, burnt malt, graham cracker, and dark chocolate. It is strong without being overpowering. The taste is very malty with a sharp tinge of dark chocolate running through it all. There is also a significant amount of bitterness in it all. The mouthfeel is slightly lighter than full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a mighty fine beer that I would surely drink again if given the chance."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a fading mocha head , with a bit of lacing, nose is heavy coffee, lighter chocolate, toffee, nice burnt and smoky body, mild hop spice,taste is coffee, toffee, bit of cocoa, finishing with a lingering coffee-hop bitterness...mouth feel is thick and creamy, carbonation is medium. Over all this is a rich thick Stout....Love the name too."
"Roasty, roasty, roasty. This beer has a tremendously burnt flavor and aroma, like strongly roasted coffee. This could be Starbucks beer. Good, full body - ABV well disguised. Reminds me of Bell's Java stout. One of the better offerings I've had from Left Hand. Thanks Deepak!"
"Pours clear dark brown with ruby red highlights. It is crowned with a thin creamy tan head which recedes quickly but clings to the glass sip after sip. Sweet roasted malt aroma is very strong. The taste is robust roasted malt flavor in a mild body with moderately low carbonation. The brew flows into a sweet and semi-tart malty finish and fades slowly into a sweet vinous character and a gentle warming sensation."
"The abv is high, but I could have more than one of these to warm me up on a cold day. I would pair this with any dark roasted meats."
"This is a black brew, with a campfire smell and taste. I get some chocolate and more than a bit of coffee, but they're burnt, smoky chocolate and coffee. It's got a righteous abv, and I'd pick it over Guinness every time."
"D-This was ridiculously easy to drink. I can hardly believe it's 8.5%. I went into it expecting it to be a bit more complex, but it's a very solid brew."
"It's not my favorite style, but it is extremely drinkable and very tasty, especially after I get further and further into the beer."
"D: Alright but not great."
"D - I have not had a export stout before and this one is excellent. Great beer. Drink it now."
"Deep roasty chewy body that's on the fuller end with a strong dark malt character, slight chocolate sweetness, lactic creaminess and a bone dry finish. Pretty complex with hints of roasted espresso bean, bitter sweet dark chocolate malt, lactic cream, burnt toast, oatmeal and toffee. Way too roasty and bone dry and not very well balanced. There's a lot going on but only a touch of sweetness. Too one dimensional for my liking but not bad."
"D-Very enjoyable...well made with nice flavors..."
"They should consider doing this regularly as it might be their best stout."
"Poured a black cola like body with a white head and lace patches on top of a roasted malt body that had hints of bitter chocolate and other sweet malts. A smooth, sem-creamy medium body that has a pleasant sweet malt taste like cocoa and vanilla mixed with some roasted/espresso like malts that balance the beer and give it a dry finish. A very enjoyable sipper and a must try."
"draft at Thirsty Monk, Asheville"
"The light body and great taste hide the abv very well. Just a phenomenal non-imperial stout. Really shows what else you can do with those dark malts aside from the sweet and heavy bodied RIS and AIS(not that is a bad thing)."
"I love the label, it is a very dynamically aesthetic branch off of the traditional Left Hand label; the ominous, intricate black and white pinstriping with the red hand... nice. If points were awarded specifically for artistic stance, it would get an A+. The roast of a Schwarzbier, but much thick and richer in body like a Robust Porter. I see now that it is a Foreign Export Stout, which makes sense as many of the Export Stouts I've had are hellishly roasty. Good drinkability."
"This was a bit of a surprise. Packed with a ton of dark flavors, yet this stayed well balanced and very drinkable for a higher ABV Stout. A winner of a new beer here from Left Hand."
"D. A bit sweet for what I was hoping for, but packs a punch. Goes down dangerously easy."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern for $3.50. Basically this is a well-made big stout - lots of dark chocolate and roasted grain flavor. But it's not quite an export stout as I understand it. It lacks the sweet candy notes that the adjunct sugar of a typical export stout provides. While it's not a great example of the style, it is still a very drinkable and tasty stout."
"This is a tasty well balanced beer that hides its 8.5% alcohol well. It's easy to drink a second one after the first is gone."
"One of Left Hands better offerings and a good start to their ""Fade to Black"" series. I did think the brew suffered from not being that complex in the taste dept. That and the issues I addressed above about the ABV. Definitely worth a try though."
"Very black body with a light tan head. As you drink this one it leaves a thick chunky ring in the spot where the head was resting. I believe it took me about 8 drinks to finish the pint so there was 8 chunky tan rings every 1/4 inch or so. Very roasted aroma, like espresso, caramelized blackstrap molasses and dark bitter chocolate. Taste is very roasty and smooth with more espresso and dark chocolate, roasted black malty sweetness, roasted vanilla bean and semi-sweet fudge. Mouthfeel isn't as chewy or as thick as a RIS or even American Double but slightly oily, creamy and silky smooth. Well done."
"D- a nicely done dry stout with a little bit of sweetness to it. a little too strong to session, but something thats welcomed in my fridge."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $1.75. Bottled on 11-3-09. Uncapped and poured into my shaker glass. The stout appears a deep brown color with barely a finger of slowly fading tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of rich roasted grain and coffee, both bittersweet and dark chocolate, cocoa powder, a bit grassy/earthy, medium char, fresh espresso, chocolate pudding, caramel, vanilla, a bit smokey and quite complex. Some alcohol heat in the throat after each swallow. Approaching full bodied and amply carbonated. Really nice stuff and about the closest thing to Guinness John Martin, only much more easier to get your hands on. I'll be buying more of this. I'm guessing this will mellow out nicely in about a year, maybe a bit less."
"This one is worth seeking out, and buying a lot of. I may have found a new favorite for the time being. Now go find some!"
"A very nice export stout and a delicious night cap to say the least. The alcohol comes through in the end but it doesn't take away from the beer."
"This style of stout should be more popular,I hope to see more in the future.Poured at first seemed to be a jet black,after being held up to a strong light a ruby tint showed thru the darkness,a creamy one finger light mocha head atop that left one big drape of lace behind as it settled into a creamy mass.Awesome aromas,just complex as all get out,a mix of fudge cake and coffee,a slight alcohol dark fruit sweetness came thru as well.The flavors were just as complex, if not more,starting out with big coffee roast and dark chocolate,the alcohol lends some molasses and dark fruit,there is big earthy dryness in the finish that was just a great cap.The only thing that isnt great about this brew is just a little bit of a thinner feel,other than that its as good as it gets for the style in my opinion,not to sweet,just right!"
"D - A tasty stout that barely hints at its 8.5% ABV. I will definitely have to pick up more of this before the winter is done. Nice flavors and well balanced."
"F: Finishes very bitter again, some of it I think is hop bitterness, but a lot stems from the roasted charred earthy starched malts, and stoutness. A little fruitiness on the finish with more lingering coffee flavors and acidity/alcohol lingering sting. The semi thick almost syrupy stout like flavors seem to stick to the mouth and don't go away at all, like a big rich heavy stout. It does seem to finish clean otherwise, and is pretty drinkable surprisingly. I think the lighter body from a much heavier stout is nice, but the coffee and alcohol flavors, and the heavy starched malt bitterness are a little on the heavy side."
"A good stout the alcohol doesn't show at all. I think I could dink a few of these in a sitting"
"So delicious and easy to sip on. Alcohol is very well hidden and only warms my stomach a bit hinting that this may have a hidden punch. But never does it makes itself known in flavor or aroma. A truely delicious brew on a cold 4 degree day like today. Must try."
"The neck label reads Volume 1 I guess the seasonal will vary by style with the same name each year that daylight savings comes around. Pours completely opaque black with no light making it through not even the ruby highlights, head is creamy textured nice tan khaki hue going on. Lacing left behind is sporadiac with big chunks but definitely clings well to the sides of my chalice. Aroma is strong with the herbal mint like hop profile, dark roasted malts bring out a creamy dark chocolate bitterness strong roasted burnt coffee a nice underlying fruit note with a soft caramel presence as well. Flavor is big roasted malt presence brings out espresso bean hints of vanilla, caramel malt, with dark chocolate cocoa nibs. A soothing alcohol finish with herbal and mint toned hop flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy textured full bodied softly carbonated no complaints I let this one warm up a good bit and I'm glad that I did. Drinkability is smooth and the price tag is right what a value, a big foreign export stout for 1.69 a bottle I will be back for more of this stuff, what a god send for this time of year thanks to Left Hand out in Longmont, CO."
"Drinkability is good. Not a session beer at this octane level, but if there were 22 oz. bottles of this, I would have no problem drinking one."
"Drinkability: Fade to yum! This year's FtB release is very roasty, sweet, and creamy -- a good nightcap for the evening a fine way to kick off this yearly series."
"Pitch black with a very thin tan head, can't see through this guy. Smells strong of sweet chocolate malts and some rich coffee, very nice. Crisp and clean for the higher abv, tastes more like a coffee stout. Alcohol is well hidden behind a huge amount of flavor. Very flavorful and robust. Extremely drinkable on this cold night, a great pickup."
"A great stout all around."
"Black, oily surface, not much head to be found. Smells a little doughy, stouty, very subtle aroma. the flavor is hard to describe, its definitely a stout but the flavors are all melded together and nothing is really distinct, muddled but tasty. Nice mouthfeel."
"Overall impression: Nice beer for the cold weather we are having lately. This is much better than the beer it replaced, and is a nice addition to the winter beers out there."
"The textures of the beer are full, round, and robust early but the sweetness subsides just in time to enjoy the crisper, drier, and maltier finish. Increadibly easy to drink especially considering the powerful flavors early on."
"Big or not big. This is just a damn nice stout."
"One damn fine tasty brew, darn shame if it is brewed just one and done. No hint of a fairly potent brew at 8.5%, body is even on the light side."
"D: highly drinkable for 8+%! Tastes good, drinks well, I'd have another mug."
"Drinkabilit-: Definitely a sipper with a strong taste. Fairly well balances though which gives it a pretty good rating"
"Overall Impression - This is a great beer, and I'm surprised becasuse I really don't care for Left Hand's beer. I find their regular production to be less than mediocre. I hope they keep making beer of this quality. This is one I will definitely buy again."
"Poured into a Guinness glass, dark brown on the pour but completely black and opaque in the glass, small tan head, very light lacing and weak retention. Aroma has a nice mixture of chocolate, roasted barely, smoke and light coffee. Alcohol is also coming through on the aroma. Flavor is balanced chocolate and roasted caramel, but there's nothing that really stands out here. It's well balanced between the roasty malt and hops, but nothing really shines or sings. I usually like to see a little less bitterness in an export stout and more roastiness. Mouthfeel is near full, but doesn't quite reach there and the carbonation is there in a perfect amount. Not a bad Export Stout, but it can never live up to something like Lion Stout or Guinness FES. Not bad though."
"Drinkability: this is a slow sipping beer that has a great flavor profile. Worth seeking this one out."
"D: Not one for pounding but if that's how you judge drinkability then you're at the wrong place. This one will warm you up and keep your spirits high."
"d-one and done..glad i got to try it but wont pick it up again"
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on November 4th, 2009. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch brown head that went away pretty quickly. Lacing is good. The aroma is molasses, coffee, smoke/burnt/charred malt, and some bittersweet chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with a bit of licorice noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and not hard to drink at all. Also, the alcohol is well hidden. Overall I think this is a good beer, I'd buy this again in the future. It's a good beer for a cold December day!"
"The taste is big roasted malt that has tons of coffee, maybe even a little bit stale...the coffee. There is a hop backbone that complements the roasted quality well. The dark fruit taste is very faint and exists under the crushing weight of all that roasty malt. The mouth feel is fine. Overall this is good and somewhat standard Stout, but definitely well done and rather big for its style, so cheers to fade to black."
"D: Wow, there is nothing I like more than a big stout that is a new release and sold in 6 packs. What I like even more is when the product inside the bottle is delicious. Fade to Black accomplishes both feats. A nice example of the style and a delicious malt profile! Also hides its alcohol content dangerously."
"This style is starting to become one of my favorites. I just wish there were more export stouts being crafted. Maybe Left Hand will start the ball rolling with this one."
"D - Good. A very deicious brew that drinks a little too easily for 8.5% alcohol. Alcohol is very well masked."
"I'll pick this up again before it's gone, definitely worth a 6-pack purchase to enjoy in the cold weather."
"Pours a beautiful thick and rocky head. Roasted overtones and sweet aromas. Very very smooth stout, wonderfully balanced sweetness and bitterness. Smoky, roasted and very tasty maltiness reigns. I really recommend this one, especially at the low low price of $1.60 a bottle at my local beer store. A winner for sure. Can't wait for Volume II!"
"d: Great beer and a bargain at $35 a case."
"Pours with a nice tan head atop a dark, almost black body. A nice balance with good mouthfeel and a tasty, malty finish. I look forward to v. 2 and what Left Hand may be releasing in the near future. A delicious offering and also very sessionable for a foreign extra stout."
"M: On the fuller side of medium. A pretty damn good beer at a pretty damn good bar."
"D - very high considering the ABV. I'm impressed by Left Hand on this offering."
"Beautiful black body beneath a cocoa head. The aroma is roasty and smokey with notes of cocoa. The flavor is roasted, nearly charred malt, bitter coffee, chocolate, and a smokey finish. The body is rich, creamy, and smooth. The finish is medium in length showing smoke and bitterness primarily. A fun Winter stout, why don't we see more Export Stouts? Richer than an American Stout, but more drinkable than an Imperial Stout. Nice work by Left Hand, too bad this is a one off seasonal and not a staple of their portfolio."
"Looks very nice. Damn near opaque. Thick creamy brown head drops islands of lace all over the glass as I drink. Great aroma of roasted peanuts, mocha, chocolate malts and caramel. Flavor is top notch as well. This is well done. Roasty and chocolatey but aslo a little nutty. Some char and bittersweet chocolate. Great depth. Creamy easy going mouthfeel. This is one of the better Left Hand beers I've ever had. Nice pick for Volume I. Not too many export stouts around. And for 8.5%, the alcohol is really negligible on the palate. Quite drinkable."
"Overall, a great example of the style, possibly the best American made Foreign/Export Stout that I've ever had. Great stuff. Thanks for the recommendation, guy who I can't remember your name (Tim?) that works at Heritage!"
"Delicious and fairly impressive overall. Though the label doesn't list it, the ABV is probably up there."
"This is by far the best left hand beer I have ever had."
"Very pleasing stout, can't wait for the next installment. Plus, a beer with Metallica reference is just pretty sweet."
"D: This is a complex beer that is pretty drinkable but the anise flavors are somewhat overwhelming at times"
"Sad to see Snowbound go. I will miss it dearly. This, however, is a very promising start to the new series. Hail darkness."
"I thought this beer, within it's style especially, was very well made. This is the way our Guinness should taste. Job well done from Left Hand."
"Nice stout. Definitely my favorite from Left Hand and not pricey."
" I think there needs to be more roasted malts, but it's very balanced. The mouthfeel is great and it's incredibly drinkable."
"I like this for reasons I'm not sure of. A couple of the flavors would normally be a bit much, but in combination this beer works very well."
"D - If the abv was a little lower, I could see myself drinking quite a few of these. However, I would probably just stop at one or two."
"Drinkability: For a heavier stout, I have to give it a 3.5 -- it has great flavors and I really like the body as it's almost like a meal unto itself, but it does sit a little too heavy and the ABV is just a tad too high for anything more than one. I'll gladly come back to it though on these cool nights."
"D: This is an excellent beer. Perfect balance, nice warmth and a thick body make this a great beer on a cold evening. I'm really glad I picked this up."
"D: An awesome foreign export stout. Solid in every category and a great example of the style."
"This one is a keeper. Easy drinking and full of flavor."
"D- One of the better Foreign/Exports that I have had. Worth trying."
"Quite drinkable due its balance of sweet, bitter, and tangy flavors. There is a nice warming effect from the alcohol, but the bite is understated and not overpowering."
"D - This is a great, drinkable beer. The sugary sweetness of the aroma is a nice contrast to the bitter and roasty flavor. The body is silky and mouth coating and helps to keep the malt bitterness in check to create a drinkable and refreshing beer. I would love to see Lefthand try scaling this back to turn it into a dry Irish stout next time, I think they could pull it off."
"Solid."
"M/D: Nice medium-full body. Alcohol hidden well and comes through only slightly. Carbonation is low-moderate, leaves just enough of a bite on the tongue."
"Tastes a bit more robust and boozy than it smells. Goodness. Not bad--actually really nice--but I was expecting something smooth and this is awfully intense. Starts out with rough roasted grain, moving into a middle of round, vanilla yeast and finishing with a blend of bourbon burn and dry hops. Very nice."
"drinkability is ok - @8.5% and you can taste every bit of it makes it a one and done for the session - good sipper though"
"D - This is a very good representation of the style. It delivers a nice spiciness with a bitter chocolate flavor."
"Overall, a nice stout quality, creamy and smooth, pretty drinkable for the strength"
"Drinkability is there. Would have another please :)"
"Notes: fits nicely into the foriegn export category which reflects more of a scaled up dry stout"
"Blessed be the Brew!!"
"CHEERS!!"
"D: I am very happy I have the rest of a 6 pack in the fridge. There is a bit of an alcohol taste to it, but it is fairly well hidden, the malt flavors are big, sweet, and beautiful, plus they are complemented by a nice roasted character."
"Nose is roasty with dark chocolate and a slight hint of dark fruits. Taste is roasted coffee/mocha first and foremost with a healthy dose of bitter dark chocolates - through it all, there is an underlying sweetness. Alcohol is hidden fairly well. Mouthfeel is fairly average - pretty heavy on the carbontion. Medium to full bodied. This is fairly potent on the tastebuds, so I don't consider it to be particularly drinkable. But hey, if you're a coffee or espresso addict then you might be able to chug'em down."
"Overall a very impressive brew."
"Quite easily drinkable, with an array of subtle complexities that bring more to the table while never detracting from the nice quaffable overall nature of the brew. Alcohol is hefty, though, and it certainly shows itself after the bottle has been imbibed, so treat this one with a bit of respect."
