Head is light coffee colored with mini craters and very very nice lacing left behind. Aroma is of roasted malts and coffee beans, very pleasant and not overpowering. Taste is also nice with a great blend of roasted coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate. Balance is nice between roast flavors, coffee, chocolate and hops. Good carbonation makes this stout very drinkable with a good kick of bitter at the end. Decent balance..","hophugger","Nov 27, 2014"

The aroma is mild, with some light notes of roasted malt and coffee. The taste is pure dark roasted malt. It has a nice burnt astringency tempered with a nice earthy hops on the finish. It has a good weight to the body and a nice silky feel on the palate. It's a straight-forward rich and malty stout.","delta490","Apr 30, 2014"

4.15,3.8,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Re-review, December 2013: This is still one of my favorite export stouts, or any stout really. It's kind of like the best of both worlds between an imperial stout and a regular stout (pick your variety, dry/Irish, oatmeal, or American). I may have to try cloning it. I love the bold dark roast flavors, the slight touch of burnt (a good flavor for me in the right quantities), and the touch of espresso coffee and dark semi-sweet baker's chocolate. I'm not sure I detect anise this time around, but I'll leave the original review in place for posterity. Second time around I still rate this one very high. In fact this isn't my second time having it, just my second time posting a review. One of pike's most tasty regulars.","AlCaponeJunior","Dec 06, 2013"

Some webbed lacing trails behind the retreating head. There are aromas of dark roasted malts, black coffee, chocolate, and a little prune. The beer is very roasty in flavor from the dark malts. I get that coffee and prune from the nose, but also a little licorice. I only get a touch of chocolate there, but it isn't much. The body is full and creamy. The roasty aftertaste lingers in the mouth and the finish is slightly dry. The beer drinks fairly easily due to the fact that it is smooth. This is an excellent beer.

The nose starts with deep roasted malts with a hint of smokiness, this is paired with molasses and fig. The taste is roasty and dry up front and develops a nice hop bitterness towards the finish. Almost no sweetness which is a surprise to me considering how malty it is. Mouthfeel is thinner than the appearance suggests, but is appropriate for the gravity of this beer. Overall, this is a nice full flavored stout with a bit of unique character. It leans towards the dry side with almost no sweetness which is unlike most stouts.","homebrew311","May 31, 2012"

Taste of big dark chocolate, espresso, pine, grapefruit, roasted malt, toast, herbal, char, and earthy hops. Good sized roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, espresso, pine, charred malt, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of roasted and hoppy flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming noticed after the finish. Quite smooth to drink, but is still a bit of a sipper. Overall this is a really excellent export stout!

Poured into a Great Divide Yeti stout tulip glass. Dark brown colored body, with a medium sized mocha colored head. The head dissipated soon, but left some nice lacing on the glass. There was a pleasant smell of smoke and baker's chocolate. Taste was very inviting. Lots of notes of coffee, chocolate cake, and root beer. At first though, this beer left a somewhat too harsh bitter coating on my palate. But as the beer warmed up to almost near room temp, that seemed to fade away. There was a nice and creamy mouthfeel at the end. This beer held up nicely for almost two years in the beer cellar, and it would be worth purchasing more at this low price point.","morebeergood","Nov 24, 2011"

Aroma was strongly of a milky slightly dark chocolate, with small hints of an oaky wood in the back. Flavor was slightly sweet, with a tail end of bitter. Predominant was a slightly watered down milky chocolate. Not a bad flavor, but a bit understated. Felt good in the mouth. Coated well, and perfectly carbonated. A very mellow well balanced sip.

A real malty taste, much like aroma, as a thinner, smoother, creamier stout passes over tongue than expected but still packs a sweet taste. Chocolate, caramel, vanilla and possibly figs or molasses seem to pass my tongue as well as roasted, bread and wood notes so this is a balanced stout that has a sweetness and finishes dry.

For starters the 7% ABV has me fired up. Popping the top, I get a delicious smell of roasted malts, notes of cinnamon and some black licorice like alcohol smells. Pouring into a trusty pint this brew pours like motor oil! Jet black and thick with high viscosity. In the pint it is as black as night with a substantial foamy tan head. There is not a speck of light coming through this brew. On the taste, the first standout is the mouthfeel, thick and smooth like motor oil, not that I've actually dranken motor oil, but just like it poured. The taste itself is a very roasted malt flavor with a cinnamon and black licorice flavor in the middle, just as the smell lead to believe. Very mildly bitter only slightly sweet, very roasted and finishes tarty. This would be great on a cold day, very hearty and robust with lots of body. A solid brew, for the price at TW a steal.

Firm, yet smooth mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. It sat too heavy in my gut and I felt the alcohol too much for a good drinkability score.

4.03,0.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a thick opaque black with a three finger, almost sudsy looking medium brown head. Head retention was pretty decent, left a thick film with spotty lacing on the glass. Nose is dark roasted and some burnt malts, chocolate malts, and toffee. Taste is of the burnt, roasted malts up front, deliciously bitter at the forfront. It then gives way to a creamy chocolate taste in the middle, and ends with the sweetness of caramel malts and toffee. Based on the pour, I expected this to be a thick, heavy beer and it wasn't! Body lends to be a bit on the heavier side of a medium bodied beer, but not extremely filling, decent carbonation, chewy mouthfeel in the middle with a nice dry finish. I could sit with a few of these on any given evening.","Jayli","Beers"

The carbonation is quite muted, and the body is rich and velvety, with a medium weight. It finishes dry and smooth, with a note of mocha lingering.

First sip reveals a thick body with very fine and fizzy carbonation. Tight clingy lattice on the glass after each sip. Flavor is dry roasted malt almost coffee bean and some general sweetness. My palate dries out after each sip. Again the hops dont show up at all which is okay considering the style. No hints on ABV either.

At cellar temperature, poured into a 17-ounce snifter, Pke Street XXX Stout is drop-dead gorgeous, with a massive and billowy esspresso-froth head atop a glossy onyx body. Delicious aromas of cocoa porridge with a faint metallic scent weave themselves among a sturdy dark-roasted grain presence that wafts forth with every sniff. Dark coffee bitterness at first, followed by a soured grain and chocolate character, and then...wow -- I did not expect that -- a puckeringly bitter grapefruit pith hop punch at the finish. This lasts well into the aftertaste. I suppose I should have known I might be in for a bit of hops with a stated 65 IBUs on the label. I must admit this detracts a bit from the experience for me as I was really looking forward to a dense roasty and chocolatey stout (with perhaps a bit of vinous quality). This stout is well-done, no doubt, but it's just not what I expected given its nose. Medium body and silky smooth, almost fluffy, mouthfeel. If I had another bottle of this beer, I would certainly cherish it and hold on to it until I had the particular craving for a big roasty stout that drowns the palate in PacNW C-hop flavors at the finish.

The color is a very dark brown that almost looks black in the pub lighting. The medium body and moderately low carbonation give this beer a smooth mouthfeel.

I watch as the liquid tumbles out of the bottle into my pint glass and think ""I've seen that body before ..."" Yes I have, I've seen it in some of the best Imperial Stouts there are, which would be Stone, Silver City, and Fish Tale. This being a Foreign stout still measures up to the aforementioned. The head is only a quarter inch thick but a lovely sandy color. There's also a bit of lacing going on. Nose beats you in the face with hammerfists of chocolate, cocoa and fudge ...it screams ""tap out wimp"" whilst in it's corner espresso and some roast bitterness cackle with glee. Man, this is WAY better than last year and I am absolutely loving it. Mouth is servicable enough but nothing to write home about. As far as drinkability goes, damn this is a special stout.

A whole lot of flavor points here. Finish is laced with cream, chocolate, low bitterness coffee and a kick of alcohol. A damn fine beer.","Jredner","Jan 02, 2006"

Very strong roasted malt aroma, with bittersweet chocolate and a hint of licorice in the background. A smooth chocolaty character up front. Sharp but creamy on the tongue. With a great nibbleing bitterness on the finish with hint of esspresso coffee in the background.","ybnorml","Nov 15, 2005"

You can tell its gonna feel creamy from the nose. Surprisingly, hops are not a big factor in this one, gentle cocoa roastiness are paired with an effective and complex nut array to create a globally spicy flavour profile. As weird as it sounds, I feel this would pair well with asiatic food. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, smooth texture.","Rastacouere","Mar 24, 2005"

Taste is of roasted grain, reminiscent of BBQ with a hint of chocolate, paired off against citrusy piney hops. Nice thick bodied. The beer is not that drinkable as a session beer it seems higher than alcohol than it actually is.","zacharius","Mar 22, 2005"

Tastes of an abundance of roasted malt. There is a really malty tang and smokiness, but no real coffee flavour (phew!). There is a hint of dairy and some welcome but ill defined hoppiness in the background. The feel isn't great. This doesn't slide down as smoothly as one expects a good stout to, especially since it only boasts 6% abv despite all those X's.","charlatan","Jan 29, 2005"

The head is thick and light brown.The aroma is weird. Where is this 4.15 rating coming from? Has some coffee notes but nothing standing out really. Body is on the thin side. Flavor is bitter and reminding me of that nasty Java Stout from Bells. Has some roasted malt flavors and more like spent coffee grinds in my opinion. The bottle reads ""Limited Release"" and let me tell you,it should be as limited as possible. Try again Pike.","BierReise","Dec 24, 2003"

3.77,-5.8,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,3,"This poured dark black with a small caramel colored head. The aroma was of coffee, malt and smokiness. The taste was quite bitter and much like old coffee that has been on the burner a little too long. The mouthfeel was okay. There was a little too much bite for a stout and a strong bitter and burnt taste. I am not likely to try this again in the near future. I think I'd go for the Guiness nitro bottles first. I've really enjoyed most other stouts more than this one from Pike Brewing.","babyhobbes","Sep 27, 2003"
3.68,-8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with viscosity noticeable. Appearance is black. That's what I like for my XXXStouts. A medium sized creamy compact brown head is erected upon the pour. Lacing comes in sheets. The aroma is burnt malts and smoke predominantly. Almost seems to be a barrel aged quality on the nose. Decent nose. The taste is of roasted malt and beechwood smoke. Not sure if they use smoked malt or not, but it's sure got a smoky characteristic. The bitterness of this beer lingers. Hop attributed as well as burnt malt. This one's got a little of that char and tobacco thing going on. For an XXXStout though, I was looking for this one to be a little more intrusive. It tastes just fine, but I was looking for more. Body is a little better than medium and the mouthfeel is somewhat creamy. Good beer overall. Not much more though.","Bighuge","Sep 13, 2003"
4.33,8.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"2001-2002 Bottle: Nearly back with a medium and slightly foamy dark beige head. Thin lacing. Aroma of roasted coffee and a hint of malt. A little richer than most Dry Stouts, I like what they are going for with a blend of Dry and Imperial Stout in the body. Coffee flavor really comes through in the flavor, along with some dark chocolate and roasted malt. The finish is dry and has a lightly hopped character. This might not be worth all the X's but it is still a good Stout.","Dogbrick","Jul 21, 2003"

4.55,13.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Virtually jet black in hue, topped by a thin, but dense and persistent russet head that leaves intricate lace. Assertive barrage of sharply burnt unmalted barley and smoked tinged espresso hits the nose at first, then diminishes slightly, allowing rich, yet rounded chocolate malt to lend a distinct mocha impression. As the beer breathes, buttery malt and slightly salty tamari notes lend an odd, yet enjoyably savory sensation. Akin to a more robustly malty Shakespeare Stout in aroma without the grapefruit notes. Continuing nearly seemlessly, smokey, smooth dark roast coffee bitterness upfront in flavor yields to softer, citrus laced hop bitterness. Mocha surges in after a brief deliberation concomitantly with toffeeish dark caramel malt sweetness providing deep malt presence that would be dessert like, if not for the pronounced, well integrated, persistent burnt bitter component. Fruitness is subdued, but complementary, providing a mellow, imperial esque pruneish contrast. Moderate in body, with a light, yet soft and velvety mouthfeel conducive to easy quaffing. Finishes satiatingly cleanly bitter and rich, not unlike hopped espresso cut with Irish Cream. XXXXX is an absolutely delicious stout that only improves as it breathes. It approaches the depth of overall character of a good imperial stout, but packages it into a relatively light and highly drinkable brew. Reminscent of a Full Sail Imperial Porter meets Rogue Willy Shakes. Its excellence precludes satisfaction from a 12 ounce portion. A bomber would be most appreciated.","marc77","Mar 05, 2003"
4.32,8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Dark as the cloudy moon-less desert sky, the head a velvety chocolate crown, the lace a shield against the light. Sweet toasted grains, bitter-sweet chocolate and a over cooked pot of coffee, what the hell else could you say to describe this nose, start is ambrosial, the top thick and chocolate like. Finish has a spiteful hop spicy bite, the acidity stinging, the aftertaste bitter chocolate dry and one damn fine stout in my humble opinion.","Gusler","Feb 24, 2003"
4.48,12,4.5,4,5,4.5,4,"The smell is reminicent of coffee, with a slight suggestion of malt. The flavors of coffee, roasted barley, and some more coffee. The mouthfeel is significant but clean. The mouth is left dry though, and wanting. If coffee was this good....","freed","Dec 23, 2002"
4.47,11.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Beautiful dark appearance. The body is a completely opaque black and the head is a creamy orange-brown. It drops quickly to just a collar and thin surface covering, but it leaves some very nice lace as well. The aroma expresses a sharp fruitiness, but it's not exactly the ""burnt currant"" aroma that's so common to the style. I expected it might lead into a tart flavor, but there's nothing like that here. With further investigation and a few swirls of the glass, some smokiness and even light caramel become apparent. It's not a really complex or rich aroma, but it's quite intriguing! The body is full with a mild and exceptionally fine carbonation that's silky smooth across the palate. Quite velvety! The flavor delivers the fruitiness promised by the nose, but it's awash in rich bittersweet chocolate and espresso-like roastiness. A bold bitterness balances and dries things out in the long finish where a distinctly smoky and acrid roastiness lingers. An exceptional stout that stands out for its unique character. Well worth seeking out!","NeroFiddled","Oct 22, 2002"
3.29,-17.8,4.5,3,3.5,4,2.5,"Nice pour, deep opaque black with an easy, thick creamy head that clings to the sides of the glass. It's not exactly long-lasting, but it never fully fades (ends up thin cream layer that's too thick for a film, but kind of like a like coat of moss or lichens). The aroma is a little weak, but roasty. The flavor is as strong as it should be but it dominated and unbalanced by too much burned bitterness. A bit of smokiness lingers underneath. The lack of balance makes this less than a joy to drink, but intriguing at the same time.","aracauna","Oct 05, 2002"
