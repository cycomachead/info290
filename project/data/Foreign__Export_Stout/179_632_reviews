"Great stout. With tones of Carmel and a nice roast finish."

"OVERALL:  Good, solid stout, but again, the roasted malt is a little too intense.  If it were just a little more mellow in that department it'd be outstanding."

"Right when I opened the can and got a smell of the rich chocolate and roasted grain aromas I knew I should have purchased more. Perhaps I can find more before I return to the East but at least I know Snake River is holding down WY very well. I hope to find myself at the brewpub again in the next few years. Between this and Pako's, WY is doing just fine."

"Flavor: dark coffee, roasted malts dominate with some earthy and peppery hops backbone"
"Pumped to review my first brew from Wyoming! Export and Irish stouts are not a personal favorite of mine, but I'd say this is an excellent rendition of the style."

"Overall, this is my new favorite stout. SImply fantastic. I can easily see why it has won so many awards. This review does the beer no justice but just a great everyday readily available go to stout."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Fantastic overall. Great semisweet chocolate with coffee and caramel hints. Well balanced, creamy, and easy drinking."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an amazing stout. I initially tried this one ten years ago, and did not like it for some reason. This was before I really knew anything about quality beer. I missed a lot of time enjoying this beer, and now I need to try to make that up again. This is an instant buy any time I see it. All of this in a regular release canned beer. It does not get much better."

"Would always have one of these. Worth trying."

"O: A very tasty stout that offers perfect bitter notes while balancing them out with large amounts of malts"
"O) I cannot recall a beer I've enjoyed more from the State of Wyoming."
"The Zonker...is quite tasty and definitely worth a try. The beer pours an opaque dark with ecru head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent carries dark chocolate and roast. The taste has a mild espresso with semi-sweet chocolate tones that makes for a very good stout. The mouthfeel is medium to light in body with smooth carbonation. I would like a bit more body. Overall this is a good stout and I could session this mofo."

"O: A pretty tasty American Stout that I keep being inclined to call thin even though it isn't. It has good balance with a nice mix of dark malt flavors. Good enough that I'll seek out other beers from the brew when possible."
"Overall a very well made stout."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink, is well balanced, and has a moderate ABV making it pretty darn close to being sessionable for me. I like the roasted flavors of the malts and it is definitely an enjoyable brew."
""
""
"Thick. Heavy molasses on this one. Wads of malts. Tons of 'em. Toasted tones on here as an accent. This is one thick and consistent beer that truly holds to style. Surprised to be getting what I did, and happy to have done so. Highly suggested."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is very nice. Balance and solid flavor. Could be heavier on the ABV but 6% is right down the middle and the flavor really comes through. Nice! Worth a try most definitely!"
""

""
""
""
""
"O/D - A well done stout - a very quaffable and easy drinking beer. Not very filling, abv is not out of line. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall this is such a drinkable beer. I would compare it to Ten Fidy in that why wouldn't you pick some up when it is on the shelf?"
""
""
""
""
"O: For a beer that is quite easy to drink, this beer is really packed with flavors and has a nice balance so that the roasted malts are not too strong. I could easily drink several of these in one sitting or the beer year round."
""
""
""
""
"O: Liked this beer quite a bit. Well balanced in terms of flavors and very smooth on the palate."
""
""
"O: Certainly a stout that pushes to the extreme of smoke and char. It's pervasive in every aspect of the beer. They made it smooth enough and just sweet enough to keep it from tasting like a campfire, however which is a feat in itself. Definitely packs a big roasted malt character for such a ""light"" beer."
"o: wow! this is one of the best regular stouts I have had. don't have anything bad to say, but think i need to seek out more in the future."
""
"Overall: this is a good example of an American Stout. Not great, not bad. I would drink it again."
""
"Overall I love lower abv stouts that are huge on flavor and this beer is perfect of that."
"o - just as good as i remembered. still blown away by this beer. snake river needs to start getting beer on my shelf! really great example of the style...carries just a bit of that irish cream char thing that i love about the style. much richer than most others of the style that i've tried. really just a wonderful beer. glad to have a 6'er of these, but i don't envision them lasting long."
"OV: One of the best foreign style stouts I've had. A treat to have. Definitely recommended."

"Pours a coal black with a rich, dark brown head. Smells of dark chocolate and espresso. Taste begins with a semi-sweet chocolate beginning, followed by some rich toffee, and an herbal, dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is rich, medium carbonation. An exceptional stout indeed. I wish this was available in my area to purchase."

"o - nothing amazing going on here, just a good, solid beer that drinks well. if they distributed to michigan i'd certainly buy more."

"Overall- Zonker has a lot of great things going on. The well balanced flavors on the palate, the almost perfect mouth feel are the great things about this beer. If only the nose was a little bit better."
"D/O- ""Damn, this is a good beer."" Couldn't find one flaw while reviewing, all good things. Low(ish) ABV encourages drinkign more...my type-a-beer. Will be on the lookout for more of this...gotta get my people some!"
"Overall it is a great stout, though the mouthfeel was off-style."
"At 6% this drinks creamy and medium bodied. This does not fall prey to the shortcomings of some regular stouts that fail to have the body to carry the weight of the flavors and expectations. Carbonation is prickly but complimentary. Overall this is a damn fine stout."
"I quite enjoyed my quick visit to the brewpub earlier this summer. Nice now to try one of their brews more tailored to a winter climate, as ours closes in. As for the beer - a lovely, dessert-tempting, booze obfuscating, Doonesbury-referencing(?), example of the style. Foreign to me, so, giddee-up!"
"Mouthfeel: Pretty light bodied with high carbonation. Fairly smooth drinking, but would like to see a bit more body. Not going to lie, when I drank this I was under the impression that it was a regular American stout, and wasn't overly impressed. Once I found out it was brewed as an export stout though, my estimation of it went up quite a ways. I ended up increasing my score a pretty decent amount. Overall, a pretty damn solid export stout that I would have again."
"2008 Bottle - Pours black with a small tan head...aroma is toasty malt, white chocolate, fruit...flavour is nicely bitter on the front end, very dry, char char bitter, dry fruit but not malty...smells bigger than it tastes, but is still very nice...way to go wyoming..."
"O - I really like this beer. I go to Jackson Hole once a year and I always grab a 6-pack when I'm there. I don't know much about the foreign export category but I imagine this has to be one of the better ones out there."
"Overall: Fantastically smooth, complex, and drinkable. Keep 'em coming!"
"Drink- Glad I got to try it and tick off another state. Was a bit spritzy and bitter for me, but seeing as its a foreign export, kind of expected that."
"O-great brew. Will be searching it out for sure"
"Overall, foreign-export stouts are not really my thing, but it fits the style category perfectly. Also, this is the best example of the style I have ever had!"
"the CPJ"
"Overall, this was an amazing beer. One of the best I've ever had. I will definitely seek this one again."
"Overall it's just wonderful and enjoyable in every way. At 6% I would have this all the time. Fantastic brew."
"Snake River nailed this one. What a pleasure."
"Beer pours dark brown with a good off-white head. Moderate amount of lacing and a thin collar throughout. The nose is roasty and dry with some coffee notes and a bit of dry chocolate. Taste is an improvement from there, with the roast, coffee, and chocolate notes all bringing dryness but not taking it over the edge. The fact that it gets a 4.5 here is all the more impressive given that someone mentioned Two Girls One Cup while we were drinking this. Finish is dry after a medium-bodied beer. Nice and drinkable; glad we ordered this."
"The beer appears a near black shade in the body, with a dark brown hue near the crest. The beige head is a finger thick, and leaves a good trail of lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite roasty, with scents of chocolate in there as well. Very pleasant tasting, with a good balance of roast and chocolate flavors. Medium bodied and smooth, this beer has a nice feel on the palate. Very drinkable, I would certainly have this again."
"Beer is nice and smooth, mild bitterness at the end with a shadow of an aftertaste on the finish. The beer is mildly sweet at the lead off and the midpalate has this nice chocolate to it. The finish is gradual, creeping up after the swallow with a little late ashiness. It's a good beer."
"D - Goes down easy. A solid stout for sure. I would drink this again anytime and would purchase more if I had the chance."
"As it warmed more dark fruit made a presence making it more true to its labeled style."
"The mouth starts and continues smooth. The taste is a sweet stout starts with a creamy chocolate taste and has a slightly roasted taste in the middle it finishes with only a slight roasted taste that lingers nice....is definitely better on draft but still one of the best stouts"
"D- It's both strong and robust, perfect for cold winter nights by the fire, and light and refreshing for warmer weather/ lighter occasions. I don't know how they do it, but this is a fantastic stout for any occasion. Unbelievable."
"This is a nice, simply focused stout; it showcases dry, roasted grain flavors without getting too harsh, too bitter, burntly acidic, or astringent. Very nicely done, I could see myself quaffing a few pints of this beer quite easily."
"Drinkability - Damn quaffable. A very enjoyable stout - reminds me of Old Rasputin a bit. Glad I sat on this one for a while and was able to bust it out tonight."
"Final Notes: A very well-executed stout that doesn't have the unpleasant burnt taste that some other stouts do. Deliciously balanced and satisfying, it would pair well with a variety of grilled/barbecued veggies and meats."
"Cheers!"
"A really nice dry, tasty stout here from Snake River Brewing. It's too bad I can't snag some more of these, because I'd definitely pick up a sixer."
"D) A well crafted stout. I'd have another."
"I do so love brewery-direct shipping. This result pours a straight obsidian topped by a half-finger or so of ecru foam. The nose is rather roast-centric, with some light coffee, chocolate, light-ish molasses, and vanilla bean rounding things out in the nasal department. The taste follows the same basic plan, with the roasted malts leading the way, followed by some dark chocolate powder, molasses, brown sugar, maple syrup, and a hint of toffee. The body is a nice solid medium, with a light carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, a very nice stout, one that I could easily see being a staple if I lived on the other side of the Rockies."
"Drinkability was superb. I could house a 6er of these no problem, and the psychosomatic effect of the coffee taste would keep me going all night."
"This is a very nice stout that starts with a coffee kick and then ends with a slight smoothness. I hope to find this beer again in the future."
"Pours a pitch black color, thick and viscous pour, with a generous dark tan head, and tons of lacing on the tulip. Almost looks like an imperial. I could smell the roastiness as it was pouring. Nice, deep roasted goodness, chocolate, little hops. Taste follows the nose. Good roast, coffee, chocolate, a touch of caramel. Again, hops are nearly absent. Great, bittersweet dark chocolate finish. Body is a bit thinner than what I was expecting after the pour, but this is solid stuff. A great, tasty, lower alcohol stout that has much flavor as many imperials. Excellent stout."
"Pitch black color with a small tan head with good retention. Coffee and chocolate aromas were noticeable as soon as I opened the bottle along with some hops. The taste is the same as the aroma, nothing to extreme, just a good, delicious stout. Sometimes less is more. This beer is not overly complex, but is quite good. Medium bodied, low carbonation, and somewhat dry. Worth seeking out if you have a chance."
"For such a dark beer it just looked clean in the glass, not cloudy or creamy - just clean. Heavy on the malt flavor while you taste a bit of the hops, it was mostly the malts comings through. I can only imagine what the place smells like when this stuff is cooking (and I think I would like it). While this would not be a regular drinking bottle for me, I would definitely look for this when I want something with good heavy flavor just to sit down and sip down."
"Drinks solidly-no boozy quality to this brew-pretty smooth."
"D - This is probably the best American stout I've had in a very long time. I'm very pleased to have tried it and would definitely recommend it to a friend. It's too bad I don't have any more at the moment."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours pitch black, and lets absolutely no light through. A fairly impressive looking one inch caramel colored head, but fades away too quickly. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, and just a hint of smokeiness. All those notes come back in the taste, along with some bitter chocolate. Dry finish, low carbonation. Drinks very thin, combined with almost no trace of the 6% ABV = good drinkability. Overall, a very average American Stout. Would drink again if offered, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out."
"(Bottle into English pint) Pours a velvety black with a small tan head that fell fast, except around the edge of the glass, leaving a nice lacing as it went. Aroma is, as expected, of the roast with some hints of chocolate and a slight hint of smoke. Very smooth in the mouth, there is a little more jump to the carbonation than I expected, but it helped to pull the nice roast chocolate flavor forward, as well as a bit of a sharp hop bite, which was a pleasant surprise. I would have liked a little more of a sharper finish with that bite, but the flavor just seemed to linger a hair too long. Not the best example i have had of the style, but FAR from the worst!"
"D- theres a lot of flavor packed into this almost sessionable bottle of beer. very pleasantly surprised. ill try to get my hands on this one again soon."
"Overall a worthwhile beer if you can get your hands on it."
"D - This is a very good stout it has a good taste and is very easy to drink this is one of those beers that you could drink too many too quickly worth getting to try sometime"
"I think anybody who hates this probably shouldn't be drinking beer! Best regards, W"
"A really enjoyable beer for anyone who likes stouts, or coffee for that matter. A definite recommendation, as this brew is not too sweet and yet the malts carry the taste with such a nice mix of coffee, chocolate and roasted flavor. Drinkability is very high, as I could drink this beer all night or have it with a meal. Glad this arrived in the mail!"
"I got this as part of my botmc, I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It is jet black, 2 finger sticky head and lots of lacing. It has big coffee and chocolate notes in the aroma. The taste follows teh nose. The finish lingers with dark bitter sweet chocolate. It is medium to full in body. This was a pleasant suprise, This is a beer to be seeked out."
"Although I can appreciate a good one, I've never really been much of a stout guy. I really, really liked this beer, though, and would certainly be into others that walked these lines."
"Moderately full body, very creamy. This one really delivered: full of flavor without being overwhelming or intoxicating. Reminds me of FBS without the heavy bitter roast or alcohol, one destined for repeat performances."
"Drinkability: While a nice drinkable, even delectable Stout, I would have preferred a little more body, roasted character or bitterness (or maybe all three) to elevate this above simply ""very good"" status. Still quite pleased overall."
"Taste, a straight forward stout with no surprises. The usual coffee/chocolate blend, no spice, average hop presence. Not too bitter despite the coffee aspect of it. Hangs tough throughout, worth picking up a 6er of it when you can find it, which doesn't seem too often. Does everything well."
"A fresh pot of the box BOTMC. Let's give it a whirl. Smells delicious of roasted malts and earthy hops with a hint of coffee. Pours to an opaque jet black with a dark tan head. Taste is a very consistent roasted malt with a good bit of bitterness but the bitterness stays behind the heavy roasted malt. Finish is a sweet yet bitter, staying consistent with taste throughout. Aftertaste lingers on the tongue and roof of mouth leaving both slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth as silk with good carbonation. A very good stout, fresh tasting and flavorful."
"D-This is a great year round stout beer and I do enjoy it. It has a bit of a hard time standing apart from other stouts in my humble opinion."
"D - Drinkability is well above average. With less carbonation, I could drink this beer all night with no problems at all. The alcohol is masked pretty well and the combination of flavors really has a nice balance that I don't come across too often. It's good enough to make me want to seek out more of this beer and other selections from Snake River. Highly recommended for any stout lover."
"Overall: I'm glad I picked this rando in a make-your-own 6-pack. It looks great. The taste and smell are good, but the drinkability and price are what will get me to but this one again. This one's worth a try if you can find it."
"Zonker compares very favorably to Old Rasputin. Drinkability is higher with a 6.00 ABV and feel is a little lower because Zonker is only medium bodied with good carbonation. All other attributes are similar. Dark brown in color with a short lasting tan head. Good coffee and chocolate aroma. Taste following closely on the heels of aroma, i.e. coffee and chocolate. I think I'm just going to have to make that trek to Jackson Hole to try one of these babies on tap."
"Yummy! Great stout. Poured with a nice sized tan head and good lace. Color is opaque. Aroma is exactly as it should be: nice and roasty, malty, and a bit earthy. Ditto flavor. Add a little chocolate and roastiness and this is truly delicious. Great finish. No off flavors. Satisfying. Body is just fine with great carbonation. Good clean finish. Drinkable beer."
"Probably one of the best American Stouts out there. Just left room in my score for something better if it is out there. Pours very dark, almost completely black with a large mocha colored head that has great retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. The aroma consists of malted milk balls, coffee, and roasted malts. Could be more upfront with the aroma. Has a great roasted malt flavor. Hints of coffee, dark chocolate, and some floral hops. Bitterness is moderate which comes from a combination of roasted malt and hops. Just a faint hint of alcohol. Has a rich, thick body but with just a hint of overcarbonation. Otherwise this would be perfect. I am very happy to see this beer make it to this market. I would be more than happy to buy and drink this again."
"D: A very good stout. I'm glad to have brought this one in. The best beer from Snake River I have tried to this day."
"HV"
"D: This is about as drinkable a stout as you're going to find. Good from the second it's poured 'til the second you're pouring another."
"Appearance is good, dark and tan bubbles with little to no lacing. Smell and taste are pretty similar but the smell is a bit bigger. Nice bitter chocolate and coffee. There is a bit of hops but not much. Mouthfeel is above average, medium in body. Drinkability is very good."
"This beer pours a think opaque black color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a quarter inch of tan foam that sticks around. The aroma is very intense. Graham cracker, milk chocolate, cream, and lot of roasted malt. This is everything I like in the aroma of a stout. The taste is just as intense, and just as thought provoking. The mouthfeel medium bodied with a silky texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer. I can't remember the last time a beer impressed me this much. It has probably been years. There is really nothing out of the ordinary going on in this beer. It is just a stout done as well as a stout can be done, and at a ABV that let me enjoy it all night long."
"In closing, I got this through a trade with JohnGalt1 who has always been a GREAT trader. I can't get this local to me in San Diego so I probably won't be getting more any time soon. Maybe I'll throw this on my WANTS in case I can pick one up as an extra.... hmmm."
"D - Totally awesome! This beer is fantastic and it quenched my thirst for a really strong, dark, and delicious beer devoid of hop flavor. I'm taking my sweet time with it though. Its much more of a sipper."
"D - Pretty good."
"Black color with a cola like finish in terms of bubbly prickle. The head starts out thick and foamy but its lively and breaks apart leaving just a rim of foam and some light lacing. Some mild oatmeal on the nose and some light roasty tones. Deep rich roasted malt and smoke flavors throughout the flavor and body. Light body and mouthfeel for the deepnes of the roasted flavors and for this style in general. A littl booze like at the finish, but mostly smoke. I would attribute any ""booziness"" that pops through to the lighter body and not carrying it. Background is pretty dry and the flavors ""pop"" pretty well. Full flavor presentation but nothing out of this world."
"Drank this one on it's own, no food paired."
"M/D - Lighter side of medium bodied, a little thin. Very good carboantion gives a more lively feel than the typical creamy smooth stout feel. Easy drinking."
"D: Very drinkable, I really enjoyed this beer."
"D: Good. Thin is about all I can say bad about this one. I like the roast, the slight smoke, with big chocolate notes. It's a new state rating to boot."
"Notes: Almost imperial in flavour but lacking the sweetness and alcohol. Excellent."
"M/D - medium bodied and good tasting, nice carbonation, i'd definitely be into having this one again"
"Overall a very solid little stout, and a nice little afternoon snack. I would have no issue having this one again or trying another beer from snake river."
"Drinkability is high on this one; it is a great stout."
"Poured this deep cola colored beer into a pint glass to enjoy. Gave a good amount of head when poured and reduced to a good amount of lacing lingering on the rim of the glass. The aroma of cooking chocolate greets the nose and gives hints of the spice. The coffee grounds and sweeter then expected chocolate taste. Overall this is a great tasting stout that I would recommend anyone try!"
"Overall an excellent bottled stout. I am very impressed!"
"pours a thick rich black that verry little light gets through with a one finger tan head that fades to a lite lacing around the glass, the taste is one of bakers chocalt, coffie and burnt malt, this bitter from start to finish, the last taste is one of hops and burnt coffiee that leaves me asking for more. i got three of these in a trade, i will have to trade for more. this is a top shelf stout for sure"
"standard pint at the brewpub and a bottle at Mountain High Pizza Pie in Jackson...updated slightly 10/13/09 with a sixer purchased in Rock Springs, WY"
"M + D: A rather slick feel with a zip of carbonation in there. With a modest ABV, it's a nice and flavourful stout that would be easily sessionable for some. Good stuff."
"Overall, a very good beer. I will be purchasing many more of these, and enjoying them throughout the fall and winter. Very drinkable, and sort of between RIS, and American Stout. Get some."
"Very clean heavily roasted tastes upfront,smokey woodiness with toasty sweet maltiness execellent balance with a crisp sharp cirtusy bitterness with astrigent chocolat overtones. very smooth with a nice creamy texture making for exceptional drinkability for a stout.very enjoyable with lots of complexity. Must try stout!"
"Opinion: I actually like this beer quite a bit. I think that it has a nice blend of flavors and I like the malty balance that is persistent the whole way through. The chocolate is showcased in this beer, and that is not a bad thing. They could almost sell it as a chocolate beer. Either way, I think that this is a prety good beer, and I would certainly try it again."
"especially in Alaska whe you are wearing a sailing vest"
"d: Another in a long line of great brews from JohnGalt1. Thanks Toby, for the tasty stout."
"Pours incredibly thick, dark as hell and a weird foamy bubbly dark-white head. Smells of dark roasted peanuts, coffee, and dark chocolate. Almost a little medicinal note hands on the background, which scored the nose a little lower than it could have been. Palate is well integrated, with candied dark chocolate, with a surprising light mouthfeel. COFFEE rolls out hardcore at the finish, showing all its privates. Good"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" dark tan head above the almost opaque dark brown brew. Dense head fades at a moderate pace, with lasting sticky lace. Aroma is dark malts, light chocolate and coffee tints. Taste matches the nose perfectly. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, and drinkability is quite good. Nice stout."
"Thanks goes to younger35 (who probably can't get this since the move) for a few bottles. :-)"
"Bottle sent by bitterbill on BA, thanks! Poured basically impenetrable black with a medium lasting tan head. Smell is dry, dark roasty malt and a dark chocolately cocoa element. Taste is dryish dark roastiness with some sort of big hop presence and/or metallic taste, which grew on me. Medium mouthfeel to very slightly full with medium carbonation. Pretty nice and a bit unique. Definitely worth trying, and I enjoyed this one overall."
"A very nice, low alcohol stout - as good as a session stout as you will find."
"Thanks to JohnGault1 for this traded bottle. Poured a black stout with slight lightness about it-not really viscous pour with that oily look. Smelled of toasted malt, chocolate, and maybe some darker fruits. Taste followed up the smell with a roasted coffee, vanilla flavor. Some dark bitter cocoa was there. I didn't pick up a lot of fruit but maybe a slight bit of caramel. Fairly full in the mouth but crisp for a stout. Hops are there but don't add floral or citrus maybe add to an earthy feel on the swallow. I could drink a few of these in a row. Nothing that will blow you away, but this is a well crafted, well balanced beer that highlights classic stout flavors."
"Loving everything I've tried from these guys."
"D: Very drinkable, but I don't think I'd want more than one in a sitting. Feels like it would go well with a heavy meal."
"Almost jet black in color. Small tan head on top. Low aroma-very coppery smelling-think penny! Deep, rich flavor. Heavy roasted tatse. Almsot a celery-like graininess to it. Slight burnt taste. Good full mouthfeel. Finish is rather dry. A decent stout for sure. The aroma is almost too much each time I raise the glass but the flavor more then makes up for it."
"Snake river makes pretty good brews and I would consider this their bottled flagship. If you ever make it to Jackson Hole, stop at the brewpub .. A little touristy, but also where the locals drink good beer."
"Drinkability- This is a fantastic Stout that I drink very frequently but havent had time to review. I have it once or twice a week at lunch when I eat at the Coop, not to mention the times I suck on one while watching TV. Great beer and by far the best brew that Snake River makes. Highly recommended!"
"Zonker Stout is one of the better American stouts I've had in awhile. I'd like to try more offerings from Snake River. If they're half as good as Zonker they'd be quality."
"D: Pretty decent stout. Would liked to have seen a bit more sweetness. I have a few more in the fridge so I'll drink those but there are a bunch of others I think I'd go to first."
"Poured into my SA special glass. 'Best Enjoyed By' end of December notched on label. Pours jet black with a fantastic brownish head, with 1 finger of froth. Aroma of strong espresso, sweet molasses, chocolate cupcakes. Head quickly dissolves, leaving little lacing in the glass. Very roasty in the mouth, as all American stouts should be. Sweet body with some pronounced hop bitterness transitioning nicely into a dry, slightly hoppy finish. Simply delicious...this stout has it all."
"I've been wanting to try this stout for quite some time, and now through the gracious efforts of one pimpp I have an opportunity (x3, in fact) to do so. Best before the end of January (2008, I presume). Oily, viscous, pitch body with densely packed, fat head of dark tan foam. Sticky clumps of lacing. Chocolate, roast, dark toffee, slight herbal hop aroma. Firm roastiness wrapped in robust baker's chocolate and coffee flavors. Soft mineral twang and leafy-musty hops accent the lingering, char-inflected finish. Silky smooth body, gorgeous in its balance of substance and unobtrusiveness. Incredibly drinkable. Reminds me of why I love stouts so much. I wish they all could be as fantastic as this one."
"Overall- Delicious, definitely 1 of my favorite stouts, now!"
"Amazing drinkablility, almost a session stout for sure. I wish I could get more of this stuff..."
"D- an awesome stout"
"D: Went down very easily. It would make a pretty good session beer if you're a stout, chocolate, and/or coffee lover."
"Very nice stout, and my first beer from this brewery. Pours black and viscous from the bottle. Very intense looking liquid, but unfortunately with no real head or lacing. What head there is is quite dark. Aromas of coffee, a touch of citrusy hops, and a bit of licorice ropund out the smell. The taste is quite robust but also quite smooth, with flavors of vanilla, coffee, coconut, and syrup drenched bacon. Complex and tasty. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and medium bodied. I really enjoyed this. It is not quite world class, but very, very solid and packs a lot of punch for the reasonable abv."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is the versatile type of stout that you can either pound down for an evening or sip slowly as you just relax and watch TV."
"Another great American craft beer, disappointing that this one is just generally available locally. Thanks be to BA and the trade network, as this one should be on your try list  if youre a stout person."
"Poured into a regular glass from a bottle notched best by March (drank on April 5th). Poured a very dark opaque black with a nice thick foamy brown head. Head lasted the whole glass with lacings towards the end. Aroma was slightly sweet, but had a definate burnt malty oatmealy to it. Tasted of sweet, chocolate, oats. Very easy to drink. No bitterness or excess carbonation. Very solid beer."
"I kept this in the fridge too long, it would likely be even better if it were warmed, but this is up there with Brooklyn Chocolate and Flying Dog Gonzo and even my fave porters. Great stuff. Get it and and get it again as I will."
"D: The only thing holding one back from knocking down a sixer is the full body of this brew. Surprisingly tasty with varied flavors throughout. Recommend."
"Near solid black body with a frothy, mocha head. Roasted coffee aroma, and the same goes for the taste. Aftertaste of coffee flavors lingers on the tongue with some hop bitterness right before. Good carbonation. Not a heavily bodied beer. A very nicely balanced stout that is extremely drinkable. One of the better stouts that I have had in awhile that didn't have ""Imperial"" or ""Russian"" in the name."
"Overall impression: Very nice - good variety of flavors, highly drinkable. This one is a winner."
"Thanks to Wasatch for sending this bottle."
"A good brew overall"
"A very dark brown/black beer. Completely opaque no light gets thru. Has a big foamy brown head and good lace. The aroma has a strong coffee character with some chocolate notes and a hint of piney hops in the background. A big roasted malt character covers your tongue with a lot of bittersweet chocolate twang.The finish has some coffee bitterness mixed with a hint of piney hops for a nice dry finish. an inviting and appeasing brew."
"Thanks Wasatch for this very good beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat chewy...good stuff overall. Doesn't ever get to be too heavy on the palate. Plenty of carbonation and a tad dry on the finish. Overall, this is a soild stout that I would easily grab if it was more readily available. Makes me want to try more Snake River brews. Thanks kmpitz2."
"D: Love me a fine stout and this is one of them. Nice balance of this beer. Rich and full bodied make this a fine winter offering. I'm sure many a skier has enjoyed this after a hard day on the slopes."
"Poured silky smooth with a thick reddish head that has small and larger bubbles intermixed. The aroma of coffe and chocolate are strong. Smooth and tangy this one is as the bubbles dance on your tongue leaving a roasted barley aftertaste or burnt however you describe it. Mouthfeel is not as rich as you would normally see from this style of beer and very carbonated. A decent example of the Stout style, does have more hop flavor than I would expect from this style."
"D - A wonderful stout that I could drink all night long."
"D: Enjoyable beer but not a lot of complexity. Very, very nice flavor though. This would be a good contestant for some barrel aging."
"Overall, it's a very medium-average American/robust stout. I wouldn't complain if someone else was buying, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to get this."
"Creamy, smooth, medium-full bodied. Think melted chocolate ice cream consistency. Quite perfect. Incredibly drinkable also, I am officially going back to get the rest of the 6'er."
"Finally got around to this brew. Pours a black color, some carbonation, tiny head, not much lacing afterwards. Scents of malts, toffee, caramel, and chocolate. The taste is very toffee/caramel like, a little sweet as well. Medium body. Very drinkable, a pretty tasty stout in my book, pretty thick as well. If you can get your hands on some, do it."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, sweet, sugary, roasty, chewy, and dry. There is a mild thin feel about halfway through the swallow but overall it's just a minor glitch in the grand scheme of this brew."
"Good stuff. Enjoy it if you can, please."
"My thanks goes out to bitterbill for including two of these in our trade!"
"Pours an absolute perfect thick oil black with a massive one inch thick chocolate brown head. Nose is very enviting with zesty smokey malt, and tones of chocolate. Nicely aromatic. Enters the mouth and coats the tongue with silky black maltyness. Slightly soured bitter twords the end of the palate. Lacks the richness that I would have expected from a stout this dark, but not bad. Hints of sweetness do exist. Thes is really decent for a low doe stout. Very drinkable and a nice surprise considering the price. fineshes to a belly warming crisp dark bitter."
"12 oz stubbie. Pours a nice solid black color with a finger of dark tan head that falls quickly to a nice coating over top of the brew. This is a nice dark beer, and clarity is not discernable. A few stray bubbles climb the side of the glass, but otherwise, this one is not showing off any carbonation. This brew smells really damn good. It has a big blast of chocolate and coffee, with lighter notes of fig, and a very solid creamy character as well. I think this one smells fantastic. Flavor is solid, while not being overpowering. The initial sip is mild coffee with sweet chocolate back notes. It moves to a mild pine hop that accentuates the coffee notes. It finishes with a moderate bitterness and the chocolate and coffee fade to a moderate chocolate coated fig. As it warms, I get very nice creamy notes that lead me to believe there is some oat in this beer. I like the transitions in this brew. Nothing is too strong, and balance is nice. The mouthfeel is moderate to thick, with a very solid creamyness and very light carbonation. The carbonation makes this one come across more thick than it really is. This is a very drinkable beer. The aroma and flavor are in harmony with each other. The flavors transition well and play well with each other. Nothing gets in the way in the beer and the lower ABV makes this one something to drink more than one of in a night. I will enjoy the rest of the 6 pack that I have for sure."
"A very good drinking stout with a very robust flavor. I agree with most that this is a good stout but I find that this is to my senses nearly a coffee stout emphasizing the roasted and smoky flavors the most."
"A big thank you to Brent56 for letting me try this one at the Carolina Brewmasters BBQ. Although way too hot to be drinking too many stouts, this one really was nice for the style. Very deep and dark color and bit more carbonation than expected. Nice smooth mouthfeel and (proabably) easy to drink more than one given the right setting. I will keep my eye out for this one again."
"Thanks, ThomasHardy, for the opportunity and to douglas88, for the chance to revisit"
"Full roasty aroma has strong coffee and and chocolate notes. Deep black body with a long lasting two finger thick mocha head. Its a looker. Fore is almost salty and quite bitter with roasted notes. Chocolate is not present, but stiff coffee is abundant. The bitterness is big, but being from the roast it incorporates well into the beer and gives it a wetness you dont get with predominately hop bitterness. It could have more range and some underlying dark fruit accents, but it works well as it is."
"I need to get back to that store & try the vienna amber from snake river I saw there"
"Drinkability is excellent really excellent example of a full-bodied and flavored stout which can stand the round about trip to MI."
"Drinkablilty- I would definitely buy this one again. Not as good as Storm King, but what is?"
"Overall quite drinkable and enjoyable. I regret only buying one bottle."
"Drinkabilitys is good an enjoyable easy drinking stout, great for everyday drinking. Thanks go to mentor for this extra treat he threw in."
"drinkability: quite drinkable"
"The taste is pretty complex; roasted malt with chocolate and coffee tones up front and in the middle and a note of bitterness at the end. A very well made stout that is sure to satisfy. I'm very glad this is available locally!"
"Has a medium body and carbonation levels, smooth and easy to drink. Really enjoyable. I think I might have found a replacement for 8 Ball and Sierra Nevada Stout."
"Drinkability: This could easily be a session beer. It was for me on my last brew session."
"Pours a very opaque black, some brown highlights, a medium tan head and lots of lace. Smell is sweet, with roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and a sweet smokiness. Taste is bizaare, as its watery and tasteless until the end of the sip when you're hit with a strong chocolate and roasted coffee bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low carbonation and silky smooth."
"Quite complex for a beer of session strength. Absolutely delicious, this is a gem of a beer. Now to figure out how to get more."
"A dark brown head a half inch thick, composed of fine bubbles, topped this black beer that had faint chocolate highlights. Decent head retention too and some lacing to boot. The aroma was creamy, with a light roast coffee character and milk chocolate. The flavour started out quite weak and watery, but sweetness soon followed. Things picked up at the midpoint, with chocolate and hop flavours accompanying a moderate bitterness. A thick, lactose sweetness also showed up at this point. It finished roasty and off-dry, with some lingering acidity. Silky, viscous body and low carbonation with a bit of slickness. Overall, it had a good flavour once it kicked in, but I found myself enjoying it less as I proceeded through the bottle. Thanks Viggo!"
"Bottle provided by mattcrill, ala BIF16. Actually, that bottle arrived empty, but then I saw the same beer at Liquor Mart (Boulder) a couple days later. I never would have tried it otherwise, thanks for the suggestion. The freshness notch on the side of the bottle is Oct. Pours a half finger brown-tan head over a black liquid. Poured thicker than I expected from a stout, more like a very dark B-wine. Smells tamed coffee. Roast, but sweetened and with a hint of chocolate. It's got a lactose smell to it, which is a scent I often get in oatmeal stouts, too. Overall the smell is subdued and simple. Tastes of coffee muted with a milk and caramel sweet. I can't tell if the roast is gentle or if the other characteristics steal away the bitter punch of the roast. It's got a little bit of an alcohol sting and some grassy hop character which is coming across to me as Williamette. The sweet runs out in the finish leaving the beer dry and with the feel of roasty bit on the tongue. Wow, I'm really impressed by this simple little stout from a small brewery in the state to the north. Mouthfeel is md-thick and, although the carbonation is fine, it's a bit sharper and more than I would expect. As the beer warms, a sour (from black patent) appears, but this is new challenge of angst is countered by a thick chocolate that has also risen. Well done, this was a really nice offering."
"Drinkability- Not a huge fan of the smoke, but it worked fairly well with this beer. Lots of flavor in this one for sure."
"Drinkability: A great stout for sure. Nice and roasty and can easily do a session with the lower ABV. Not sure I would agree with ""outstanding"" but I would highly recommend it. A classic example of an American Stout."
"Overall this is a really good stout and one that I would have absolutely no problem drinking on a regular basis. I'd just make a point to let it sit for a few minutes before I started."
"I hope this was just an odd bad bottle."
"Drinkability: Well, here I'm in a bit of a quandary. Not everyone can suck down stouts like I can, and this beer is only distributed as far as Montana (as far as I know). That said, I have downed so many cases of this spectacular beer that I'm going to rate it at a solid 4.5. Any stout that clocks in at a mere 5.8%, and tastes like a stout rather than an ill-named brown freaking ale needs to be supped as much as possible. Sadly, I only have one bottle left, squirreled away in my basement (ok, it's not IN my basement yet, but it's in my kitchen. Which is by my basement. Sort of. I'm working on it.)."
"It was on the verge of being thick and black when poured with a little bit of tan foam and little lace clinging to the side of the glass. The smell of roasted malts dominated this brew. The sweet/tart taste of roasted malts was well balanced. A nice stout."
"This beer is very dark brown (black out of the bottle) with brown edges. It sports 1cm of still, thick, brown head. Swoops and small spots of lacing. Strong aroma of toffee and cocoa. Acres of chocolate. Chocolate and toffee in front, a little watery in the middle. Medium body. Bitter chocolate-cocoa powder at the end. A little fruity too. Almost smoky in the aftertaste, with a little veggie. Not bad. Quite full-flavored."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium deep brown head with excellent retention. Aroma of roasted malt with light sweet chocolate are easily detectable. Taste has a real creamy feel with a good dose of roasted malt and bitter hops. Lack a little something to make this truly great but still very enjoyable."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out thick and black, with little head even with a hard pour. Roasted coffee and chocolate aroma. Big roasted flavor. High acidity. Bitter chocolate. This is a very flavorful stout. More hops than usual for this style of beer. Pretty drinkable for the style. While I enjoyed everything about this beer, nothing really blew me away. Still, this is definitely a stout worth looking into."
"This brewery known for this product alone. I found it a competent stout compared to what I had before in the style, and just a better than average brew. Syrupy, some sourness, not watery but not a full mouthfeel either. Picked up at Lina's this week near Cleveland, expiry date March. Now, if this is the past March, because they seems to have a fresh stock of beers from everything else I have seen, it shouldn't be significant."
"Very dark brown coffee with a tight, cocoa-brown head that lasts. Sweet, milk chocolate, molasses, rum, roasted coffee, and some earthy bitterness make up the nose. Yum. Taste starts with dark fruit and chocolatey sweetness. Roasted barley comes on strong, leading to a coffee bitter, well-hopped finish. Lingering roasty sweetness. A great stout, right up there with Shakespeare. Big bodied, full, creamy mouthfeel. Delicious."
"A beer full of flavor. The last sip leaves you wanting another. SImply outstanding"
"This is really good, I recommend it!"
"Pours black with a thick brown head. Cocoa, roasted grain and chocolate malt in the nose. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. Bland front opens up to a bitter-sweet middle of roasted malt and barley. But a hop bitterness dominates the finish. Unfortunately, the flavor turns sour. Overly carbonated right out of the bottle, it softened as the beer warmed a bit to room temperature. This is not a great stout. Drinkable, but not worth purchasing again."
"Brought back directly from the Jackson Hole. It poured out like motor oil! The head was suprisingly darker than I have noticed from other stouts. It was almost a deep brown. The smell was somewhat pleasing with caramel, buttery, choclate aroma. The taste was nice upfront, but the finish was a little out of balance. The bitter chocolate and roasted nut were a little too sharp for me. It seemed to me that this was a little to heavy for an all nighter. Good stout overall, but a little overrated in my mind."
"Imposing black hue, it poured from the bottle very heavy, Ive seen thinner Imperial Stouts! No light could penetrate the liquid. Impressive. The head was russet in color and about one finger in height. Head retention was very good; it slowly faded to a soapy cap that lasted the entire consumption. Subsequent lacing was unorganized and patchy. Its a great looking stout. The nose is inviting, big, bold blast of roast that encompasses coffee, hints of cocoa beans, char, oat and sugary sweetness. At the distant back is a hint of earthiness. Formidable potency, it is loud enough. I find the bouquet on this stout to be ideal for the style. I love it mouthwatering good! Inviting. Close to perfection. The palate is not a let down. My word this brewery is topnotch, it makes me want to move to Wyoming. Okay, not quite. ;-) Anyway, the palate is simply lovely. Roasted malts are dry for a while, cocoa beans, in the middle a flash of hops materialize and offer some bitterness to counterpunch the astringency. There is just a hint of citrus juiciness. This plays very well with caramel hints and oat-like sweetness. The finish is coffee and char. Simply lovely stuff, this stout really impresses me. It is a great American Stout/Dry Stout, nothing more and nothing less. Great. Medium/medium-full in body with ticklish carbonation that produces a mouthfeel that is pleasant, it is just big enough and yet have finesse. Extremely drinkable! There is no flaws, no complaints. It is a terrific stout! Give me a steak. I really wish Snake River beer were sold in Nebraska because Id buy their beer regularly. I purchased a 12-ounce bottle in Brookfield, WI. The next time I see this beer I am going to buying more. Recommended."
"Very nice, almost an imperial stout."
"This beer could easily become a session stout for me. I will definately be visiting this one again."
"Appearance: Pitch black dark all the way through after a rough pour forms a standard sized two finger width head dark tan in color that as it dwindles leaves behind fine even lacing. Aroma: Robust milk chocolate creamy edge with coffee accents what an excellent smelling brew with just a touch of hops to balance. Taste: Ideal stout, Wyoming has it good robust sweet chocolate slight coffee very creamy just rolls along the palate bringing an immediate smile to this imbiber's grill. Does a finish a tad on the dry side with just noticeable amounts of alcohol session stout, pick this one up by the case you won't be sorry. Mouthfeel: Full body creamy texture doesn't even attempt to sit heavy with me what a perfect mouthfeel with dead on carbonation, great stuff. Drinkability: Perfect I'm a believer in the things I heard of this stout all expectations of this rare brew have been met, thank you for being available in Cleveland."
"An opaque stout that pours with a nice bit of foam. The intense chocolate aroma is awesome. Starts smooth, almost milk chocolately, and get dry towards the finihs, which is laced with hop bitterness. The taste of chocolate lingers on the palate. I like how the hops are balanced with roasted and chocolate malt flavors. I also really like the dry finish. Could A little roasted coffee flavor wold be nice; otherwise an excellent stout and one I'm definitely going to have again. Unfortunately, this was my only bottle, picked up in Wisconsin at the Brennans market in Brookfield."
"Solid pour-deep and dark with a fat, creamy and sticky cocoa brown head. Aromas hint of espresso crunch candy. The mouthfeel here is unctuous while still balanced with plenty of elegant zip. This is quite the flavor driven beverage! Features include: espresso cream, roasted and nicely bitter coffee bean, bitttersweet chocolate, and a trace of vanillan. This is a real pleasure to drink, and as I do I only want more-most certainly recommended."
"From the bottle pours a black liquid with no highlights. Nice thick tan head that stayed for a long time. Nice lace on the glass at the end. Smell is slightly chocolate, but not much else going on. Taste again was slightly chocolate, along with a malt that was so roasty, it almost seemed burnt, (not that this is a bad thing). Lots of hopr bitterness in this one, this is a well-hopped stout for sure. Dry finish. Full-bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. This is exactly what the mouthfeel of a stout should be. Overall, this is an excellent stout. Very well hopped, but not overwhleming the deep roasted malt character. I will certainly look for this one again in the future."
"This is one of the beers that I think could be used to define a stout. My I cannot say enough about this beer except, I think I will walk into the garage and get another out of the fridge."
"Zonker Stout hits all the right notes. It's solid in all respects and is my new favorite stout. Too bad it isn't available in this state because I could drink this stuff all year round."
"12 oz bottle pours a genuine motor oil pitch black. Cocoa head is short lived, fading into patchy lace down the pint tumbler. Aroma is complex and a delight to inhale. Bigtime notes of roasted coffee, lots of chocolates, cigars, fresh leather, and some vague citrus hops. Mouthfeel has moderate carbonation, is thick and rich, and has some mild hops bite. Taste echoes the nose, for the most part, but with additional smoke flavors, some black pepper, and a hint of sour citrus. Quite complex, yet very well balanced. Finishes dry and slightly on the bitter side, with a smoked coffee aftertaste. This is everything a fine Stout should be, and the distinct hops presence adds an exciting and pleasant twirl."
"Utterly pitch black. Tall, dense, dogged bister head yields lace. Buttery cocoa and brown sugar sweetened medium roast coffee dominate the aroma. Secondary are dark caramel and molasses hints. Quite welcoming in nose. Paralleling the aroma, agreeably assertive mocha and cocoa butter notes are prevalent. Pronounced, mildly smoky roasted barley complements hop bitterness, transiently lending dryness. Sweetness resumes promptly in a powered, Nestle Quik like fashion. Trace citrusy hop undertone. Full bodied and dextrinous, with a creamy, low attenuation derived mouthfeel. Finishes with fleeting hints of burnt caramel, but otherwise with lingering mocha hints. A delicious stout that is rich in coffee and chocolate character, yet remains soft on the palate. Well balanced, superbly drinkable and highly recommended. Akin to a more subdued Bell's Kalamazoo."
"The beer pours motor oil black with ruby highlights when held to the light. The dark brown head is very small and does not last long at all. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, and some sweetness. The flavor is coffee, slight chocolate and roasted malt. The body is medium. The finish is dry coffee."
"The nose is light and gives off coffee and roasted malt sense. The taste is mostly coffee-like with hints of chocolate and roasted nuts. The drinkability here is quite nice as the ABV is low for the style. Overall a very nice beer with less head and lace than expected."
"A very rich and assertive stout. Nice balancing! Nice Everything!"
"I first tried this beer while doing field work in Wyoming and made sure to bring a few back with me to Chicago (wish I had brought more). Pours a nice thick black-even when held up to a light, none passes through. A thinish, red-brown, foamy head diminishes fairly quickly to a thin layer of light brown bubbles. Wonderful smell of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Full bodied, smooth, and very tasty. Lovely coffee and chocolate malt taste. Filling but highly drinkable. An outstanding beer and definitely one of my favorites."
"This, to me, is easily a solid 4.0 beer. It was a very nice black color, which had me thinking it was going to be super heavy and chewy. Well, it was heavy, but not as I expected. Actually it was quite light at the same time. I was a crisp, iced coffee like taste, with small hints of chocolate malts. The head was a nice thick one. Brownish-red color head that lasted a little bit and then flattened out to a laceing. The smell was similar to the taste but had more likeness to an Imperial, which is a great thing. All in all, I liked this one. It's a heavier brew, but is easliy a refreshing one as well."
"Poured a...uh...black...no....**BLACK**, crude oil color. Just the slightest amount of ruby red is able to penetrate the edges of this inky brew. Silky smooth layer of tan-colored head persists and clings nicely to the sides of the glass. Aromas are wonderful...chocolate, caramel, roasted coffee beans, caramel. Flavor follows nicely. Bitter chocolate, fresh coffee, roasted malts. Finishes with a slightly acidic-coffee flavor...dry, too. Definitely got better as it warmed. Quite tasty and a bonus for me in that it's available here in Richmond."
"Flavor: It has a medium mouthfeel with an almost oily texture. The finish is dry. This is a straight ahead, dry stout. It's very nicely done."
"Pours pitch black in color with a fat creamy tan colored head with a very nice retention. Nose is roasted chocolaty malts and fresh brewed coffee. Fairly full in body and smooth and creamy in texture. Taste is dominated by flavors of bittersweet chocolate with some additional notes of espresso and smoky charcoal. This is a fantastic stout and is a beer that I would always keep on hand if it were available here. Purchased from Vintage Cellar."
"The beer camed with a deep, deep black body and a thick dark caramel head that lingered. The beer sports a strong roasted malt aroma with plenty of mocha turns, and a bit of a pleasant burnt smell. Tastewise, this was a wonderful stout: a bit of initial bite, plenty of sweet maltiness rolling over your tongue, fading to coffee and roasted malt aftertaste. A well-balanced, smooth, rolling mouth feel. A very drinkable stout, easy one of my top five. I highly recommend it."
"Tasted: 04/25/03"
"Pours black as night with only the slightest bit of light creeping around the edges and a nice creamy brown head that slowly sinks and leaves minimal lace. Huge roasted malt nose with big coffee characteristics and an nice burnt background. The taste is more of the same on the tongue with a starter of slightly sweet malt that soon turns bitter with a big roasted malt bite that is somewhat like a nice dark roast coffee. The roasted flavors fade towards the finish as a nice burnt flavor comes in and lingers slightly just to remind you what that last taste was like. The mouthfeel of this brew gets better and better the longer it sits as it becomes a bit smoother and seems to almost thicken into a medium heavy body. A very drinkable stout that would be great on draught and is sure to see some more time in my fridge."
"This beer is quite well-balanced between the malt and hops, it's an easy drinker for the whole six pack, a difficult statement for a stout as my mouth can become anesthetized (sp) after a few dark ones. This beer makes quite the statement, however."
"Pours like a glass o' road tar. In other words, it's very dark. Thin and quickly diminishing head. Satisfying coffee/roasted barley aroma, and a nice hops/malt balance made for good drinking. Glad I got a sixer of this. Unfortunately my dad cleaned me out when he was visiting from CA and sealing our driveway!"
"This solid stout exhibits a sweet roasted aroma and nice deep color.  The smoky roasted malt flavor is supported by the heavy body.  There is a nice light bitter brush in the finish rounding off a sound representation of the style."
"This beer poured an amazing jet black color and formed a very nice dark brown, bubbly head that left some nice lace.  I had an aroma of malt, hops and coffee.  The flavor was of malt and coffee.  The finish was a touch bitter and had elements of the coffee.  A very nice stout."
"Some good java tones on the palate and more of a bittersweet dark cocoa rather than the milk chocolate on the buds..a little syruppy and if I had one compaint, that would be it...It finishes on a nice dry note..Very good stout..not many look better than this one, and the rest is pretty good too.."
"Thanks to Cokes for the sample."
"Notes: A kick-ass robust style stout that would make any brewery proud to be the creators of such a fine beverage. It has over 16 awards for proof if my word is not enough."
"While intense in all aspects, this beer delivers what a top notch stout should. Certainly a treat for stout lovers."
