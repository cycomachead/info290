4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/7/2008. Pours hazy fairly pitch black color with brown edges, with a 1 finger dense tan head with goof retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, plum, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, light smoke, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of dark/roasted malt, light licorice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, coffee, raisin, molasses, light smoke, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, light smoke, light licorice, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors, light licorice, and yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Baltic porter! All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, licorice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 09, 2014"

This beer is like a cross between a rauchbier and a Baltic porter, two of my very favorite styles. I like it a lot. I could easily imagine drink several of these sitting around a campfire with the temp hanging in the 40's or low 50's F, eating meat cooked over that fire.

4.97,25.5,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Whoa, character up the wazoo! I let the bottle warm up out of the fridge. Poured with a magnum sized foamy, frothy, fluffy, billowy, sudsy, tan head and lots of clingy lace. Color is an absolutely opaque black brown. Aroma is complex with licorice, dark ripe fruit, roast malt, earth, musty, old leather, gin, cocoa. Flavor is similar but also is quite dry with only a suggestion of possible sweetness if you're being good; plus a little salty tang, leftover coffee, unsweetened cocoa. Body is full, carbonation is spot on and the overall effect is just perfect for this beer. Finish is like flavor with the extremes diminishing first and softer components tapering later in a fairly lengthy process. Too big for a session, but what a work of art!","drpimento","Jan 10, 2011"

4.37,10.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"11.2 oz. olive green bottle, this "double brown stout" is brewed with "liquorice." Jet-black, fairly clear, with a half-inch, dark tan head that retains a foamy collar. The aroma is big and roasty/chocolatey; bold, yet supple, gently hinting and the huge burst of flavor to come. Strong roasted and dark coffee flavors meld with bitter chocolate, light licorice, and a mild bitterness contributed by both the hops and the dark grains. The alcohol is well-hidden here, and the body is lighter than it should be, but somehow gives the impression of bigness. Quite easy to drink, and very assertive with its long roasted finish, but it is a bit too punchy for prolonged quaffing.","mmmbeer","Aug 19, 2010"
4.01,1.3,5,4,4,3.5,4,"Limfjords Porter (Double Brown Stout) is a pitch black liquid with a huge, soft, bistre colored head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It's a unique look. It has a huge aroma of smoke and ash. It smells like a camp fire. It's medium bodied and a bit metallic. The finish is a bit watery and it leaves the tongue dry and a bit numb. It tastes like it smells: smoke and ash. There's a hint of licorice sweetness at the finish. The aftertaste has a lingering bitterness like baking chocolate. The bottle didn't say anything about smoke. In a blind tasting, I'd probably guess this as a smoked Baltic porter. It's very unique.","yesyouam","Jul 26, 2010"

2.04,-48.5,4,2.5,1.5,3,1.5,"Okay, I like most flavors in beer, but the one direction I don't like is band-aid. This beer is rife with it. Like a few Belgians that exhibit this flavor, this seems intentional instead of an infection. Unlike those particular Belgian beers, this one seems more an accident of combined flavors than the result of any funkiness. I'm a huge licorice fan, and I like some peat in the glass as well, but the combination here of the strong licorice and strong peat here tastes just like band-aid to me here- and I don't like it at all. I could be wrong, and it could just be infected, but this is not a bottle that's been lingering on a shelf somewhere, the abv is relatively high, and there is no excuse for it and I'll judge accordingly. The pour is nice, black and viscous with a tan head that fades to a thin ring. That viscosity, though is a little unsettling in the mouth. Very thick and almost slick in the mouth. The smell has a bit of that band-aid smell, that grows as it warms. Beyond that, roasty, very peaty and licorice dominate. The taste has that same flavor, especially on the finish. Before that is some very earthy licorice and strong peat- and then tragedy. I won't be having this again.","Georgiabeer","Mar 22, 2009"
