3.84,0.3,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste briefly seems to live up to the aroma but soon fades. At first, it has nice, rich , somewhat sweet prune, fig, and earthy brown bread up front, followed by drier earthy toasted bread-coffee bitterness in the finish. However, this all soon degrades a bit, becoming thinner, more bland, and muddled, with the coffee-roasty earthiness fading away mostly and leaving the beer more of a sweeter and alcoholic character, although it is never overly boozy or heavy. It is not as good as, and does not maintain the complexity and depth of character as well as, Guinness Foreign Stout.","Offa","Nov 18, 2010"

3.35,-12.5,4,4,3,3.5,3,"Sweet and doughy, what I imagine chocolate bread were to taste like if it existed. Sharp fruit, mild hops and some burnt malts all contribute to a rather abrasive finish. Hmmm, just does not seem to all come together in an enjoyable fashion. Body is ok, but lacks a silky creaminess that the best of stouts seem to have. It's ok, but I dont think I would seek this out again.","twiggamortis420","Aug 12, 2010"
4.2,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This is a very easy drinker - which is scary at 8%. Not a hint of booze in this one. Not the thick, densely-flaovred export stout you'd expect. Balanced and properly subdued. Worthy of a try.","OtherShoe2","Jun 27, 2010"
3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice dark, opaque sable with a decent light tan head that sticks around a little bit. Aroma is malty, spicy and chocolaty with a hint of coffee. Flavor is like decent mocha with hints of malt and molasses and just a touch of spice, mainly cloves. Texture is smooth, just a teensy watery, a little bit fizzy.

4.3,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"M&D: I'm not sure (or I suspect) if the beer is bottle-conditioned, as not a single bit of yeast sediment is detected at the bottom of the empty bottle, but the carbonation is quite soft and natural, showing no trace of artificial CO2 injection as far as my taste-buds could tell. Semi full-bodied, charmingly-flavoured, with a sour-fruity balance all 'round... All in all, this is a moderate choice for RIS new-comers, but also a petite and fine example of RIS for experienced drinks that could spot delicacies amongst big flavours.","wl0307","0"

3.15,-17.8,4.5,2,3.5,4,3,"A pitch black stout with a full, tan colored head. I couldn't smell anything. But I could taste a lot. The beer had a rich, heavy, but pleasant roasted taste. I noticed at times a slight and unpleasant sour tinge. I did not notice the sour taste with every sip, but it was there often enough for me to make a note of it. I couldn't taste the alcohol, the beer went down smooth, a little too smooth for my tastes for an 8% ABV beer.","deg","Mar 21, 2009"
4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is light and lively, acidity and alcohol bite both liven things up without overwhelming.","JohnQVegas","Dec 01, 2008"
3.98,3.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"This brew is a dark brown color with distinctly ruby hues if held up to a light source. The head is modest, but long-lasting and fairly dark. The aroma is solid, with a touch of roast grain, some malt, a little ester-induce fruitiness (pear and plum) and a bit of alcohol. Still, it's not as intense as I would have likes, and I found myself hunting for the smells, even after a significant warming. The flavor, though, is nice. The roasted grains give the beer an espresso-like quality that balances the initial malt sweetness very well. It's both aggressively sweet and intensely grainy, and the flavors do a great job of playing off one another. Lots of malt flavor, with a prism of roast qualities coming through (from pale base malt through burnt malts). Thick and mouth coating. Not at all dry, and not a low alcohol beer, but both these qualities are folded into the experience. Great brew.","Suds","Nov 30, 2008"
4.25,11,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"ridgeway's foreign export stout is a strong (8% abv), rich, smooth, full bodied stout. good head retention but relatively still. dark and not particularly bitter, the malts definitely over power the hop presence but this is no milk stout. the toasty malt overtones are balanced by the alcoholic bite. this is a good stout for those getting into the style of strong stouts.","mightyjoemoon","Nov 12, 2008"
4.12,7.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is a very tasty stout and while I probably will not buy it again in the near future for the sake of trying other ones, I would recommend it if you haven't had it yet and enjoy an English style stout.","roadhouse","Nov 09, 2008"

3.69,-3.7,4.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"A very drinkable stout from Ridgeway that, despite its thin body, is quite tasty. The 8% is not really noticeable which makes this a dangerous beer to drink because it goes down way easy. Not bad at all!","baggio","May 27, 2008"
3.6,-6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Subtle, even when warmed, which is fine, but as a whole it doesn't ""stand out from a crowd"". There is a nice balance to the sweetness, with sour and slightly bitter touches and a certain roastiness that comes through as it progresses. The 8% abv is more than reasonably (though not absolutely) covered. Easy enough to drink.","jwc215","May 27, 2008"

3.8,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a bottle into my Samuel Smith 16-oz pint glass. Pours a deep brown color. No head to speak of. Looks a little more watery than what I like from a stout, but I suppose this is an English stout. I get some dried fruit in the nose, which is quite the departure from the coffee/chocolate smell that I'm used to. Taste is not half bad. Again, I'm not getting coffee or chocolate that is typical, but more of a hoppy, fruity taste that has some a decent malt backbone. It's bitter on this finish. Mouthfeel is a little more watery than I'm used to, and I don't much care for it. Despite the 8.0% ABV, this beer is pretty drinkable.","jdubjacket","Feb 01, 2008"

3.8,-0.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours very dark brown, almost black with little head. Aromas are slightly sweet and milky with a light roastiness and a touch of coffee with cream in the finish. The taste expresses subtle and integrated flavors of sweet, milky malt, alight roastiness, a restrained sweetness and a slight hint of charcoal in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall this is pretty tasty, but a little light. The flavors could be slightly more intense and still in keeping with the style.","Georgiabeer","Dec 18, 2007"
2.68,-30,3,2.5,3,2,2.5,"Taste has a hint of that leather and black plum. Most seems like watered down porter. Semi-sweet, not a real bite to it. Cocao is faint, coffee is stale. Perhaps this was sitting on the shelf too long. Not real impressed with it.","Mebuzzard","Dec 09, 2007"
4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours with a light tan, four-finger head that goes slowly and leaving some lace. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Almost black color, hints of mahogany.

3.98,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Is this a genuine foreign export stout, it is too watery, and not full bodied enough to be considered a FES? The answer is, who cares. What you will find is a very nicely finished dark roasted ale that hits all the right notes. It pours a dark chocolate, with minimal head, lacing, retention. The smell begins a little on the metallic side, but settles in nicely as the beer warms. You'll get the chocolate, coffee, caramel, molasses, perhaps some butterscotch, and definitely the sweet malts. The smell is good, but not brilliant. The taste is light to medium bodied but full of flavor. There is all c-c-c-m-b listed above, but add perhaps a bit of cherry to the list as well. The mouthfeel is light, a bit watery, easy on the tongue. The aftertaste is quite modest. I'm guessing that the ABV is in the 6-7% range, if it is higher, than this beer is even more outstanding for completely masking the alcohol tones. This beer is well worth seeking out and is one I would go back to. L'Chaim.","albern","Sep 29, 2007"

Soft carbonation yet medium mouthfeel. Also understated roast and nuttiness. Nice. This is aged, and I am interested to know how long so.","Sammy","0"
3.8,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"For maximum enjoyment, make sure the chill is gone before drinking Foreign Export Stout.

4.18,9.1,5,4.5,4,4,4,"Smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Slightly sour aftertaste to this, but overall a generally well done stout. It comes off more as an double stout than an FES, but still a very nice drink.","BDTyre","Feb 04, 2005"
4.5,17.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This stout poured jet black in color with very light brown, creamy, smooth, nitrogen foam that persisted a long time. The smell was dark malt with some licorice, dark mollasses, and hints of toffee and chocolate. The taste was darkly malty and lightly sweet with flavors of toffee, mollasses, dark caramel, and a touch of fruitiness. The hops were there but were somewhat buried beneath the onslaught of the malty flavors. The mouthfeel was very smooth, creamy, and silky with full body and moderate carbonation. The aftertaste was very pleasantly malty. This was a very, very nice stout and was easy to drink.","UncleJimbo","Beers"
