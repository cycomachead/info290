Roasty aromas of dark chocolate, cold coffee, and a bit of toffee.  Flavor is sweet and cocoa-like with hints of toffee right up front, before mocha flavors, with their espresso bitterness, round out the mid-palate. There is a slight but pleasant alcoholic warmth on the finish that reminds you that this a sipper, not a gulper. Medium full body is appropriate to the austerity of its flavors and abv. I absolutely love this beer.","droomyster","Aug 05, 2014"

Then the head died quickly and I realized the aroma was somewhat tame compared to classic Irish stouts I have tasted over the years. Upon first sip, the flavor was nice; not bitter and yet flavored with bakers chocolate and light roast. Not the usual heavy mouth feel or after taste of Guiness or other stouts. I will say it does drink smoothly for 8% ABV stout!

Schlafly Irish-Style Extra Stout is one of the best beers in the style that I've had - robust, tasty (and a steal at the price of 99 cents per bottle that I stumbled upon last night) - but I can't envision many times where I'd want this particular combination of flavor & ABV. Good beer, though.","Reaper16","Jul 22, 2010"

What little head their is collects in a small ring at the outside of the glass. Pours a very dark black the consistency of motor oil. Smells surprisingly fruity, with notes of raisin followed by the typical stout smell of roasted barley and chocolate. Some almond notes are there too. Surprisingly bubbly on the palate, with the roasted chocolate followed by more roasted notes and some coffee. Hop character is there, but not exactly easy to find and it's mainly in the finish. Hard to believe this is an Extra Stout with the 8% ABV. One would expect this to be heavy, almost syrupy, but that's not the case. It's actually a very well balanced beer and quite enjoyable.","eclaycamp","Jul 16, 2010"

3.87,-1.3,3,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours engine oil black that no light can penetrate. Nice tan head, but it quickly disappears. Aroma is roasty and sweet with coffee, bitter cocoa and some licorice notes. The nose seems a bit sweet for a dry stout. Flavor is quite nice and has a surprising smokiness to it. As one would expect, the predominant flavors are of roasted malts as bitter chocolate and coffee. Less chalky yeast character than most true English styles. Very little hop flavor, but definitely has the level of bitterness a dry stout requires. As mentioned before, I am getting a definite Smokey character, or perhaps it is just black patent? Definitely unique and a welcome addition. This is a very well balanced dry stout, and though I worried after the aroma that it would be too sweet, it is nicely dry and quite refreshing. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit sticky, but not a deal breaker by any means. Very drinkable, and noticing that this is 8% ABV, I am inclined to think that it is not just very, but extremely drinkable.","zoso1967","Apr 17, 2010"

Notes of both milk and dark chocolate, fresh roasted grains, bitter coffee, dry cocoa sweet caramelized malt are present in the taste and aroma. I was surprised to read this one clocks in at 8%. You certainly don't notice it while drinking. Dry finish and a body slightly better than medium with ample carbonation for an export stout. Worth a try.","ClockworkOrange","Jun 18, 2009"

Nice aroma, it smells like roasted malt, coffee, molasses and chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted/burnt malt, smoke, coffee and chocolate. The hops show up in the bitter finish, and there's a good overall mix between the sweetness and bitterness in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit silky and creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink.

Aromas are roasted malts, molasses, and coffee with hints of chocolate. Familiar dry stout qualities are present in the aroma also. Mouth-feel is thin to medium bodied, but silky smooth on the palate. Tastes are similar to scents - chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, coffee - alcohol is present, but balanced well with the slight bitter finish. Also finishes appropriately dry for the style. Great take on a classic style! Would definitely recommend.","barnzy78","Apr 23, 2009"

Pours black unless held up to light with a moderate sized brown tinted head. Smell is roasty with a hint of hops. The taste was wonderful. Roasted chocolate and coffee are apparent up front. The finish is spicy and slightly hoppy. The spice at the end reminded me a little of the spiciness in Chimay Blue. Mouthfeel is oily and cloying. This Stout is moderatelty carbonated. Drinkability is not very high. It is so rich, that after about four it gets to be a little much. My favorite stout yet, but I've never had a foreign export style stout before. I wish they were more available.","johnnybgood1999","Mar 06, 2009"

There is a one finger head that recedes relatively quickly - slight slight lacing left behind. Nose is predominantly of coffee and caramel with a very apparent boozy scent as well. Taste is very sweet up front mixed with coffee and dark chocolate. Alcohol is very apparent in the taste. Mouthfeel is oily on the tongue at first but the finish is on the drier side. Medium to heavy body, medium carbonation. Not a bad beer but the alcohol presence in the taste makes it a beer that I could only have one or two of in an evening.","Jayli","Mar 02, 2009"

To my taste, this is truly an nice example of an export stout, rather than than an extra stout, and the abv supports it. Very akin toa caribbean stout, like those found there from Guiness and Ceres.This style is a little highr in alcohol, an a bit sweeter than an Irish dry stout. This stout well represents the style. Pours a dark brown with an okay head that settles to a ring. Smells a little roasty, a little sweet, a little nutty, almost salty as well. The taste is also somewhat nutty, creamy, and only somewhat roasty. Some vanilla on the finish. The mouthfeel is unbelievably creamy, and it is a real creaminess instead of tricks with widgets introducing nitrogen. Smooth and delicious and easy to drink.","Georgiabeer","Apr 05, 2008"

3.8,-3.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Don't see this style everyday, aside from the Guiness version or a few homebrewer's. The beer begins with a deep, dark brown color and promises a viscous texture. Good head formation and retention of the tan variety, showing fair lacing later. Aromas are sweetly malty with a firm follow-up of roasted grains. Not overly complex, but rich and clean with a light lactose twang in the nose. Flavors provide much more malt sweetness, but not to dwarf the roasted, charcoal malts. Hints of espresso and cocoa decorate the brew but never dominated. Hopped for bitterness, but no decernable flavoring. Leaving the bitterness and flavor from the roasted grains to give roundness and palatability. Decently weighted and creamy in the texture, albeit too sweet on the teeth. Finishes, still, sweet with a firm shadow of roasted malt. A really nice beer, but probably a bit too sweet (caramel) for the style. Appreciated, but it's no Guinness.","BEERchitect","Mar 03, 2008"

Nose is a spicey super zesty shock to the senses. The presence of grain alchol lets you know this is no 5% brew. Wow, as this hits the mouth you get a creamy coffee and chocolate mix.

It's also easy to drink in spite of the 8% ABV. Perhaps not my favorite offering from what is rapidly becoming one of my favorite breweries, but it isn't shabby either.
