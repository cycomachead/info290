From a 750ml longneck into a pint glass. Best after 20 April 2014.  A: Looks a solid black with a nice dark coffee head. S: Smells a nice bitter chocolate, with a little vanilla and coffee too. T: like it smells...chocolate, fudge and some coffee bitterness. Overall a solid stout that id be happy to drink any day. Not a complex example of the style, but a great go-to for a daily drop...keep a couple, or a case, in the fridge and you've got guaranteed satisfaction if you're yearning for something dark. Certainly give it a go.","Stickydates","Jul 05, 2014"

3.43,-10.4,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a brown 12.7 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, some sweetness, molasses like. Taste is roasted malts, a bit of chocolate, somewhat light and mild, some smokiness as well. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer.","tone77","Feb 23, 2014"
4.09,6.8,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into an English pub glass. Nearly pitch black with the odd red flash glimmering here and there, with a wholesome milkshake-like tan head. Aroma includes roasted barley, rich milk chocolate, cold coffee, and a whiff of smoke. Palate reflects all these elements as well, along with a tannic red wine fruitiness that is rather interesting in a stout. Bittersweet, with carob and butterscotch diacetyl, raisins or dried currants, and blonde roast coffee flitting in and out of awareness, something different with each sip. Smooth and creamy body, semi-thick (certainly more so than an Irish dry stout), with an earthy dry tea-bag finish that also hits a few wood char and chocolate milk notes on the way out. Plenty tasty and I'd make this a go-to stout if it was easier to find in these parts. I like the juxtaposition of sweet dark malts and tannic fruity/bitter almost Burton-esque flavors. Its not a super heavy hitter, looking considerably darker than it tastes if that makes sense, but features more character than some of its better known mass-produced counterparts from Ireland.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 22, 2014"

Coopers Best Extra Stout is definitely one of the best examples of the style and, as a relatively light and approachable beer with strong and substantial personality, is an easy thing to recommend to all drinkers.","biegaman","Feb 11, 2014"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and slight char-like aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and char flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with some nice aromas but the flavors come off as a bit too acrid and burnt for my liking.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 25, 2013"

It smells like a dry scotch, with only a hint of butter, mild dark fruits and some raisins. Bitter at first, it spreads out to coat your mouth a with medium-to-light mouth feel. The roasted malts are very alive and they are very pronounced in this beer. The aftertaste is quit tame and only a hint of citrus zest and alcohol is present.","vickersspitfire","Aug 21, 2012"

The taste was a little of the same, it wasn't very aggressive, there was the coco, some molasses and a little roasted malts but not enough to give a very bitter after flavor, there was also this unusual earthy taste.

Again what should be obvious stout characters of chcoloate and roast is mild. Not really deserved of its top 5 Oz status.

Label reads, ""Best After 10/7/08"" so I'm very excited to see how it has aged. Pours very dark, almost pitch black color, and didn't bother decanting out the sediment. Produces a thick, rocky, mocha-colored head with lacing that clings in clusters down the glass. Sediment sits on top like powered hot chocolate. Nose of roasted coffee, some smokey hints. Palate is nutty, mostly hazelnut, with the smokey aftertaste much more pronounced. Lots of bittersweet chocolate, coffee grounds linger along with the slight warmth from the 6.3% ABV (maybe even higher after bottle-conditioning + aging.)

Subtle would be the best word to describe it. The mouthfeel comes in at about medium. There's an appealing bitterness quality to the taste with a tart hoppy ending.

Smells of coffee and chocolate and molasses and dark dried fruits. Taste is very roasty with hints of chocolate, figs, molasses, dark fruit, and an annoying mineral or metallic flavor that while not overwhelming distracts me a bit. Creamy grainy mouthfeel, medium to thick body, moderate level of carbonation. I almost enjoyed this one, well I did drink it all. The mineral flavor kinda killed this one for me.

The taste follows, with the coffee, malts, subtle bits o' cocoa, and twinge of bitterness all coming in, but sadly seeming somewhat watered-down, all of the flavors perceptibly weaker than they ought to be.

Finishes dry at the back of the throat with the roastiness second to none. A second sip confims the same thing. Definitely strong as an export stout should be.

Deep obsidian with a persistent but steadily thinning khaki head. Sour, vinous aromas of blackberries and rum-soaked currants with a few cherry cordial notes here and there. Somewhat cola-ish, as well. Very interesting taste experience, with vinous berry and tart apple brandy flavors up front, moving into a muted, soft cocoa middle that never speaks at a level above a whisper, and finally a very enjoyable chocolate and roasted coffee bean finish. The long aftertaste here just about redeems any strange or unexpected qualities of the flavor profile. Feels thin on the palate at first; it gains more body as the lively, peppery mouthfeel expands throughout the swallow and sets up residence. Feels just slightly chalky at times, too.

3.38,-11.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"M&D: quite smooth and fine-carbonated on the mouthfeel, but it's still thin-bodied for a 6.3% stout IMO--the sweet edge fails to buttress the maltiness to make a more vertical or thicker appearance on the palate, although the finishing touch with a mild tang of coffee does make up for a bonus to make it more drinkable without falling dull.

The mouthfeel was medium thick with medium/low carbonation. The taste was full-bodied with a rich taste of dark roasted malts. The hop bitterness was medium and I felt that it wasn't too overpowering. One of my favorite aspects of this beer with its nice smooth aftertaste that had a bit of chocolate malt flavor to it.

Smell is quite nice, with dark chocolate aromas as well as some hints of dark fruit in the mix somewhere too. Taste is a little different...Im picking up more coffee tones with some marshmallow and licorice tastes happening also. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and very easy on the palate. Drinkability isn't bad at all either, slthough I can't see myself drinking more then a few of these.

A very ephemeral head explodes as it is poured, leaving a sparse patch over top that is maintained by an active bubble at the top of the beer. Nose is very rich with sweet dark fruit, molasses, deep roasted malt and coffee. I would venture that there are some oats in this one as well. It has that creamy essence I associate with oats. Flavor is very nice and has a nice progression from initial sip to finish. It starts as roasted to light burnt malt with prunes and sharply turns to a light chocolate and finally settles on a lighly creamed coffee. Mouthfeel is a touch light for my taste. its right at the lower end of moderate with a fairly light carbonation. Its just too close to water for me. Drinkability is very good.

4.25,11,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Coopers Best Extra Stout delivers the typical stout appearance with the notable exception of some yeast which settles at the base of the glass beneath its black body and creamy tan head. The head retention could be better, but it holds well enough. Fruity esters dominate the nose before you take a sip which reveals the rich caramel and chocolate flavors within. It's smooth across the palate with a dextrinous body and gentle carbonation from bottle conditioning. Some of the fruitiness found in the aroma is also found in the flavor along with its caramel/chocolate maltiness and a roastiness that's more genteel than aggressive. It's rich and satisfying without becoming satiating to the palate; and the yeasty fruitiness lends enough complexity to it to keep in interesting. Nicely done indeed!","NeroFiddled","Apr 20, 2005"

With the head completely gone except for a lace ring around the edges of the glass, bubbles still consistently rise to the surface and burst. The smell is quite a bit hoppier that I would have ever thought in a pitch black stout such as this. I don't like a lot of hops, and as such I gave this a 3.5 on smell. The smell certainly isn't offensive, just quite different than I was expecting and not exactly how I like a stout to smell. There are also some toasted notes and a hint of smoke present here, which is nice. This one certainly has a ""mulit-faceted"" taste. First comes a nice malty / coffee-like taste up front, followed by a pleasantly hoppy bitterness, and then finishing up with a dry roasted chocolate taste. There is also a faintly noticeable smokiness all the way through. Many flavour profiles present here. The mouthfeel, while not as heavy as I like, is still smooth and very pleasant.

2.92,-23.8,2,2.5,3,4,3,"To tell you the truth, I was a bit disappointed. I think I would like to try this beer again, however, not from the same selection that was on sale in my local supermarket. It is possible that I came across a bad batch.","mwrseeley","Dec 27, 2003"
3.85,0.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Not bad...probably the best of the 3 Coopers sent to America. A decent Export stout that I would likely have again.","beergeek279","Nov 19, 2003"

4.2,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"goes great with seafood, or with anything deep or pan fried. its interesting to compare this with the old stout, which is the same beer aged in barrels for a further 6 months. i tend to prefer this as i like its bold, in your face nature which is not something you find in a lot of reasonably priced stouts. one of my favorite aussie beers.","diablo14","Nov 04, 2003"

4.15,8.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"In the mouth it's clean and slightly watery. No more so than hundreds of other commercially successful stouts and porters, but I was hoping for authority here. No, this is a stout with loads of character, well-balanced, integrated...it's only missing an element of viscosity to make it perfect. Drink it on a camping trip.","putnam","Aug 11, 2003"
3.68,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Dark Black Color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts and bananas (?). A medium bodied stout. Roasted malts are balanced by a very surprising fruitiness. A touch of banana and vanilla. Nicely balanced. A very drinkable milder stout. Nice. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Aug 06, 2003"
4.07,6.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours very black with a quickly dissipating light-brown, medium-sized head. Smells of roasted coffee and dark chocolate, and alcohol. Tastes much like it smells. Wood and coffee up front with a dry, slightly bitter finish. Pretty good balance overall. Mouthfeel was a little thin, but smooth. I could drink several, but then again, I am partial to stouts.","alexgash","Jul 15, 2003"
3.78,-1.3,4,3.5,4,3,4,"This is an interesting stout because it had some characteristics of an imperial stout but it was very thin in body. Lots of chocolate and coffee taste.

It's not completely void of hop, but it strikes a really nice balance with a strong lean to malt. Super easy to drink. It's got a pretty strong abv to boot - certianly took me by surprise. Creeper beer!","fastfwd","Jun 27, 2003"
4.47,16.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours out to a cloudy ink-black with innumerable flecks of brown yeast conglomerating at the bottom of my goblet, with particles in a suspended gradient. The tan head has poor retention and sits atop very fine bubbles. Lacing is very poor to non-existent. Carbonation is paradoxical...mild to moderate by looks, but moderate to strong by texture. Aroma reminds me quite strongly of Mackeson's XXX Milk Stout mixed 50/50 with Guinness Export Stout...sweet with caramel, burnt yet expressive, hints of toffee and butterscotch, dark roast coffee. Wonderful aroma...strong, complex, and rich. Mouthfeel is at first flitting and spritzy on the tongue but the dense body smooths it out and makes for a very refreshing, mild finish. Taste is very nice...starts with vanilla...thin, burnt malts backed up by substantial malts nicely filling out the body, smooth caramelized sugar, rather mild hops teetering between being earthy and herbal at the same time, and finishing with a touch of wood and a hint of smoke. Hops are well balanced with just the right amount of bitterness. Easy to drink, yet sippable owing to it's complexities. Alcohol is not perceptable in aroma or flavor, though there is a hint of warmth going down and it packs a decent buzz. Quite odd feeling in the belly..the carbonation is out of cahoots with the density of the brew. Drawing upon the best of the two beers I mentioned above, but without their weaknesses, this beer is well crafted and bests them both. It had been a long time since I last drank this, but I am thoroughly impressed.","Mitchster","Jun 20, 2003"
3.75,-2.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured a pitch black color with light off-white colored head,aroma was smokey and somewhat woody.Taste was oily and wood-like with some sweetness lingering in the end of this one.Nice to see some sediment in a stout you dont see that too often,seems like it would be very food friendly.","oberon","May 20, 2003"
4.3,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a charcoal black, lines of nice lacing, some thin carbonation. An aroma of roasted malt, some chocolate also detected. A sharp and crisp tasted of roasted malts, mixed with chocolate and dark roasted coffee beans. Very thick and full bodied, stout lovers only. A finish that is dry and smokey, very rich, very easy and smooth drinking, an awesome stout that rivals the best.","GeoffRizzo","May 09, 2003"
4.11,7.3,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Ink black, appeared clear when pouring. Good and steady head. Aroma was the weakest area. Quite high in fruitiness and this was backed by a mild roast malt, but not much else. Well balanced flavor with no extremes in any direction (eg. neither too sweet or dry). Nicely balanced roast flavor, with a prominant fruitness too, that leaves a pleasant lingering. As advertised on the bottle, low astringency. Mouthfeel is smooth, but not necessarily creamy. Carbonation aids this, but also adds a filling quality. This is really quite a nice stout. Well balanced. Can feel but not taste the alcohol. I'd recomment this, except that the fruitiness may be high for some.","garymuchow","Apr 26, 2003"
4.12,7.6,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Notes: A highly drinkable, big bodied stout. A recommended ale for stout lovers to have in their fridge at all times. A versatile beer to pair food with, I could see doing chocolate as well as a hearty beer stew.","Jason","Apr 04, 2003"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very dark brownish ruby color with a creamy tan colored head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is sweet dark malts and a bit of burnt coffee. Medium in body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is sweet roasted malts and dark fruit up front followed by some chocolaty flavors. A touch of bitter hops are present in the end leaving a dry finish. An easy drinking stout thats quite enjoyable.","Morris729","Mar 29, 2003"
4.32,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I haven't been able to find this around lately. The review is from my notes written 3 years ago. This pitch-black stout is as heavily bodied as it looks. It is not overly sweet, nor overly dry. Bitter chocolate and coffee notes, smoky and quite hoppy with underlying bitter citrus bite. The gorgeous tan head doesn't last long. Deep and complex fragrance. Rare treat!","BeerResearcher","Mar 14, 2003"
4.24,10.7,5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A bottled fermented stout - That is not your typical find. And Australian at that. The head is weak to non-existent and the nose is the same. The color is a beautiful and rich almost a pure black. Now it gets better. The flavor is complex with a really excellent balance of hops. There is smoke & coffee flavors with very complex malt and spice followed by a sharp hop flavor that leaves no lingering after taste.","AtrumAnimus","Mar 02, 2003"
4.22,10.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Very dark, almost completely opaque, with a short and short-lasting, but thick, head, and nice lacing. Aroma is roast coffee with hints of raisin/prune. The coffee predominates in the taste, as the combination of roasted malt and hops prevent the fruit notes from making it very sweet, and also do a good job of concealing the alcohol level. A somewhat thin stout, but perfect for the outback!!!!","stoutman","Feb 24, 2003"
4.42,15.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A solid stout with a nice black appearance, a nice aroma and solid stout taste. This one was a bit off the run-of-the-mill beaten path, having a slightly porter-esque tint to it. Even though I had this beer following a 20% ABV Raison d'Extra, I still found it hit the spot rather nicely. If you're looking for a beer that is 100% true to it's style, you may be let down a bit, but if you like a little bit of differentiation or strecthing of the style limits, you won't be disappointed.","porter17","Feb 17, 2003"
4.37,14.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"An eternal finish, one that digs in it's claws and won't let go! A contemplative stout, one to savor, linger over, and enjoy late at night, with a good book.

I bought a six of this to follow up the single I had bought and reviewed before. Unfortunately, upon further review I found this beer to be sweet and thin for a stout. If your in the mood for a sweet stout, this is a decent one, but I'd prefer Young's or Lion in that regard.","JohnnyDuvel","Jan 25, 2003"
3.28,-14.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours black as a moonless night, with a brown head that dissipates to a slight ring. I didn’t get much lacing at all. The aroma is a bit sweet, with a burnt roastiness. The flavor is mostly of a burnt roast malt flavor, with hints of coffee and chocolate. It has a somewhat smooth, oily texture. The bitterness is at a good level, subdued by the roast malt. Overall, not a bad stout, but it does not shout out “drink me again”.","BeerBuilder","Jan 07, 2003"
4.02,5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Impenetrable brown with eager spritzy head that diminished. Very strong, robust aroma, particularly from the bottle, of molasses and soy sauce. Bottle says 32601 which I presume means the bottle is just about a year old. Some sediment and a mellowness indicate its age; I'm laying a bottle down (not literally) to see how long this bottle-conditioned brew can last. Some lingering soy or teriyaki sauce in the flavor could be a remnant of improper handling (dead yeast) or the result of Cooper's unique maltings for this beer. A fascinating combo of sweet, lactic flavors and bitter coffee flavors, set askew from normal stout expectations by a stern wood quality and aforementioned soy. Almost nothing in the way of hops although the beer is dry enough to not be cloying. Rather fizzy mouthfeel for the style but that's the Adelaide way. A very interesting drink: a stout that verges on doppelbock territory. Should be a great thing to try in a recipe.","Thrasher","Dec 18, 2002"
3.98,3.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The color on the pours is as black as they come, the head impressive, the lace in sticky sheets that cling mightily to the glass, both are a light chocolate brown in color. Nose is toasted malts, the front is sweet, the top medium, the finish is nicely hopped, dry, light carbonation. Not as good as I remember it, but still, quite decent stout and worth the try.","Gusler","Nov 22, 2002"
3.83,0,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a black color that, when held to light, exhibits a deep ruby tone. A nice creamy head sits atop the dark liquid. Smell is reminiscent of a sweeter stout, but upon first taste, one can tell this is a stout of the dry variety. Nice coffee, chocolate and roasted malt characteristics in the first sip. Finishes rather dry. Mouthfeel is a touch watery for the style, which brings the drinkability up a bit. Overall, a pretty good stout that packs a little punch. Worth checking out.","Jon","Nov 06, 2002"
4.21,9.9,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a deep dark brown with a minimal taupe head and quick lacing. Aroma of coffee and caramel that I found very appealing. Slightly dry/bitter flavor that kept my palate interested. Hints of coffee and chocolate with a nice roasted after-effect. I am a Stout fan and I definitely enjoyed this one.","Dogbrick","Nov 06, 2002"
2.71,-29.2,4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"The nose makes you think that it is a milk stout but during the first taste you realize that it is not.  It is bottle fermented and they may use a little too much sugar in this process.  In fact, there are brown specs in the head.  The head is decent at first but dwindles quickly.  The taste is a little strange, almost oily.  The high alcohol content is not overpowering.  Overall, this beer was quite disappointing.  The hops do not break through at all.  It almost seems as though the brewers do not have a direct goal in mind with this beer.","Maestro","Nov 05, 2002"
4.47,16.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours an utter sable with a modest dark caramel head, a little lace, a fair amount of swirling sediment noted, mild carbonation.  Aroma of coffee, bitter chocolate, dark fruit, and dark roasted malt.  Taste begins with a sting of carbonation at the tip of the tongue; dark roasted malt, bitter coffee, and dark fruit all ride a wave of sharp tartness to a crisp and very dry finish.  Alcohol provides a warming note.  This beer is nothing less than excellent and seems particularly suited to the winter season.","Pegasus","Nov 02, 2002"
3.65,-4.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A nice looking black beer topped with a creamy brown head. Not a lot of lacing going on though.   Nice blackened malt aroma.  Some slight burnt tones.  Nice chocolatey taste.  Roasted tones.  Coffee comes to mind.  All of this is melded together very subtely. There is nothing overbearing about this stout.  Some slight burnt tones as well.  Body is a tad light checking in slight above medium.  This is better than average but nothing special.","Bighuge","Oct 24, 2002"
4.2,9.7,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pour this Aussie stout hard to get a two-finger, craggy cocoa head that will coat your rapidly draining glass brilliantly. Mellow roastiness snuggles with a hint of fruit to finish tart and dry and long. Perhaps a bit too sparkly for the style, but the bubbles do a good job keeping the roast barley astringency from overwhelming the buds. A sound, swiggable stout.","inebrius","Sep 26, 2002"
4.15,8.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This is a very enjoyable stout.  Dry and somewhat smoky, with a strong cofee / roast malt flavor and aroma.  The beer smells as though it's going to be sweet, but there is almost no sweetness in the flavor.  It's probably a little on the thin side for a stout, but it's thicker than your average porter.  Dark and opaque as you'd expect, with a tan lace on top.  Probably the best brew I've sampled from Coopers.","zerk","Sep 04, 2002"
3.67,-4.2,3,3.5,4,2.5,4,"The uniformly thick & dense head tops a virtually black hued brew.  A hazy deep garnet hue is visable along the edges of the glass.  Light mocha & sharp black patent aroma along w/ a hint of tart fruity esters & butterscotch as the beer warms.  Black patent sharpness hits upfront, but gives way to a decent balance of hop bitterness, dark crystal malt, and residual unfermented sugar sweetness. Unfortunately the body is too thin to support the roasty & chocolately malt notes--  This odd, but unique brew seems to be a stout / porter hybrid.  It's quite dry all around, relatively drinkable & worth a taste.  As a stout, Cooper's is a bit lackluster, but is enjoyable in itself.","marc77","Jul 12, 2002"
3.55,-7.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Impenetrably black, with a small tan head.  Full, dense beer with a pleasing bitter finish.  Smoky, burnt flavor throughout the tasting.  Very dense with slight alcohol warming.  Good beer.","Suds","Jun 15, 2002"
