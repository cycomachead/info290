4.06,4.6,5,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 8/6/2015. Pours slightly hazy deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, white grape, light pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, white grape, light pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light peppery yeast spice/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, pear, apple, grape, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian style imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 02, 2014"

Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with roasted malt, cocoa, acidic, and dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour cocoa and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a below average beer that is definitely suffering from a mild infection, but is still fairly drinkable as it is.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 02, 2014"

3.89,0.3,4,3.75,4,3.5,4,"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a dark red brown, translucent in the pour, but nearly opaque in the full glass. Eighth inch light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark and fresh dried fruit, toasted malt, molasses, a hint of cardboardy oxidation. Flavor is more fresh dark fruit, sweet/sour lighter fruit, coffee, chocolate, bit of molasses and hints of Belgian yeast. Finishes with mild coffee, hint of hops bitterness and residual semi sour light fruit. Medium bodied with little carbonation. As advertised, a melding of Belgian dark ale and a drier foreign style stout, leaning a bit more in the Belgian dark direction. A nice change of pace for either and a good job at combining the strengths of both. The slight sourness was a bit distracting for me, but I still enjoyed this quite a bit. The mild oxidation elements made me look closer at the bottle for dates and I was amused to see "Best by: see above", with nothing above or below to indicate date. Nice try, guys.","LiquidAmber","Sep 07, 2013"

The nose comprises toffee, light roasted malt, graham cracker, sweet and mild cocoa, and a touch of walnut and cashew. The taste brings in more of the same, with the cocoa coming in stronger, and a touch of both cola and lightly acrid coffee being added to the mix. Not bad. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation, and a lightly creamy feel. Overall, a pretty decent export stout, nothing amazing but something fairly drinkable and generally enjoyable.","TMoney2591","Jan 05, 2012"

3.73,-3.9,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Troubadour Obscura pours not quite black, but rather a very dark brown, and has faint cherry highlights when held up to light. There's a touch over three fingers of tan foam that rise up above the beer proper. Head retention is very good, and lacing is a little bit spotty, but still pretty nice for a stout. The nose is very surprising. It's almost devoid entirely of most traditional aromas that are associated with a stout, and instead smells much more like a nice dark Belgian ale. Specifically, there are a lot of dark fruit smells wafting about, with just a little bit of roast there to balance things out. It's nice, it's just a little bit off for something that calls itself a stout. The flavor brings a bit more balance. Specifically, a nice chocolate note comes in and shares the lead. The result is a flavor profile that resembles cherries and plums drizzled in chocolate. The body is a little drier than a typical stout, and the carbonation a little more active. It really falls in well with the flavor profile though to create what I'd imagine a Belgian Stout would taste like, which is what I get the impression this beer's aiming for (even if it's not a recognized style on BA). Troubadour Obscura is a refreshingly different beer from a Belgian brewer, and a fairly tasty one to boot.","axeman9182","Dec 04, 2011"

(Teresa's mistakenly labeled this as a stout on their menu; both my wife and I suspected that it was more of a dark ale than a stout, and looking it up, it appears that we were right. Skills?) Aroma was roasty and chocolaty, and definitely bore a semblance to a stout, but lighter with much more dried fruit in the nose. Taste and mouthfeel was definitely lighter than a stout, but right on for a strong dark ale.

The label calls this a mild stout, its listed here as a Belgian Strong Dark, I'm not sure how to rate this but here goes. Smells of light chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and spicy Belgian phenols. Taste is rich with brown sugar and light chocolate with the Belgian spice cutting through the sweetness. Mild dark fruits are muted behind the other overpowering flavors. A hint of alcohol shows itself near the end of each sip but is soon overwhelmed. Finishes with a bit of lingering chocolate and a hint of ash. Crispy spirited level of carbonation, medium to full body, bubbly sweet sticky mouthfeel. I think there is more Belgian strong here than Stout. The roasted flavors are barely evident and the sugary sweetness lends itself more to that style.

The flavor is roasted vanilla beans with a bit of pepperiness. The taste is close to Golden Draak, but with with a roasted compound. The body is a little thin for the style.

I think the taste is mostly like the aroma, but it's a bit stronger and has the addition of some sweet spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with high carbonation (too much carbonation for me). Drinkability is decent, it's certainly not hard to drink at all.

Toffee and honey flavors dominate but with some tartness coming in midway to balance out the sweetness. A bit of chickory at the finish with the slightest amount of alcohol bitterness.

Huge three finger head of mocha-like foam that retained beautifully and left curtains of sticky lacing on our glasses. The aroma was clearly Belgian, complex fruity esters, roasted malt and coffee. The flavor profile was similar, starting sweet with chocolate then going into the fruit and tangy yeast before swinging to the bitter end for an acidic, coffee finish. Complex and distinctly European. I prefer American stouts personally but if you dig the over the pond kind you must try it.","thekevlarkid","Dec 05, 2008"

Some chocolate, dark fruits (cherries or grapes it seemed like), a bit of coffee and a little too much alcohol. I also notice a slight metallic taste to it.

The Belgian spice and sweetness are subdued by the roasted malt. The feel is moderate, with active carbonation, and finishes bitter from the malt.

The body was of medium consistency, slightly overcarbonaed, and finished a bit chalky down the gullet.

It stood up to and wonderfully complimented a fine Italian blue cheese, Blu del Moncenisio. Even as a standalone, it is utterly enjoyable, if at times a bit too big for its own good, maybe blurring some edges in spots. The ABV is spookily disguised, lurking and waiting for one's foolish over-indulgence. And yet, it goes down well, clean in the end, and refreshing, especially with the right gustatorial pairing.

The nose is of roasted malt, mollasses, raisins, and dates. Very warm and very rich. The palate reminds me in some small way of Achel Brune, but slightly more biting. This is a Belgian strong dark ale, not a stout, at least in the traditional sense of the word. Dark roasted malt, figs, raisins, and more black-strap mollasses in the palate. The 8.5% alcohol is quite well hidden, but does provide a nice warm finish. Speaking of finish, this ale is not cloying but does have a lingering sweetness. Aggressively carbonated, it leaves fairly clean and dry however. Thich in the mouth, but alive with carbonation. This is an intriguing beer. Very rich and complex - a pleasant Belgian strong dark ale in every respect, I'd say. If I had another bottle, I'd want to cellar it for a year or two and see how the flavors and mouthfeel round out. Still, very nice as it is now.","beerphilosopher","Sep 14, 2007"

The head falls quickly on this beer and leaves just the dark brown body. The center of the beer blocks light, but a large amount (for a stout) does get through at the edges exposing a lighter brown hue. The aroma is more typical of a dark belgian beer than a mild stout as it is labeled. It has a pretty strong malty presence, but there is some roasted aroma in there as well. There is also a weird smell in there that reminds me of green or purple olives, but it is pretty faint. The first thing I notice as I taste it is the creaminess. It is the typical creaminess that I find in dark belgians. The primary flavor is the roasted malt, and it is good for a stout.

4.1,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"I was curious about a Belgian stout..and this one did not disappoint. I could see this as a "breakfast beer" with a nice brunch. But it will pack a punch with 8.5% alcohol. I liked it and will get more. And drink them one at a time.","ccs","Oct 27, 2006"

3.87,-0.3,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours very dark brown with half an inch of tan head that disappears quickly, leaving thin lace. Toasted coffee and powdered chocolate malts in the nose, with an undercurrent of dark fruit (plums, raisins). Simple yet satisfying flavor. Chewy grains up front. Develops nice toasted bread and powdered cocoa in the center. A touch of drying hops and warming fruity alcohol in the aftertaste. Alcohol is well integrated overall. Medium to heavy in the mouth; balanced more towards carbonation than creaminess. Satisfying, though not particularly easy-drinking due to the strength and body.","dgallina","Sep 23, 2006"
4.33,11.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"What an interesting beer. Disguises its high alcohol content completely. Very smooth-drinking, medium-bodied beer, with a great deal of subtley. Has some of the rich malty stout taste, with hints of chocolate, but ends up being dominated by the spicy Belgian dark ale taste, with some hints of prune or plum. Seems like an effective blending of the two styles. Very much worth returning to.","timbeer","Sep 11, 2006"
3.98,2.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a beautiful deep ruddy brown, with a nice sitting (and lasting) tan head atop. Aroma is of hot chocolate powder and slight roastiness Semi-sweet. Flavor follows through, but is much less sweet. Dark heavy fruits (cherries, plums, a bit of apricot) remind me that this isn't really a stout, but is a Belgian Dark Ale. The body is rich and filling, with more carbonation than expected for a stout-BSDA. A very tasty brew, not in the class of some of the best BSDA around, but very tasty indeed.","Dukeofearl","Aug 30, 2006"
3.83,-1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting on 8/16/06: Dark reddish-brown color with a thin and creamy off-white head. Minimal lacing. Mild malt and caramel aroma. Medium-bodied with a roasty character. Malt, dark fruit and chocolate flavors are present. The finish is tart fruit at first, then sweeter fruit and malt. Above average.","Dogbrick","Aug 28, 2006"

4.27,10.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Surprised this beer doesn't get better ratings than it does. I find it quite amusing and really like it when Belgian beers keep with their roots but stray to other styles outside their borders.","Westsidethreat","Jul 25, 2006"
3.53,-9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"While not knocking my socks off, this is a pleasant tasting Belgian ale that wont disappoint unless youre looking first and foremost for a stout. It goes down easily enough, giving little notice of its 8.5% abv. The price will probably not have me returning to this anytime soon, however, as there are enough dark Belgians around that are cheaper and just as good, if not better. Certainly, the St. Bernardus Abt 12 I bought at the same place for a slightly cheaper price has no fear of being passed over next time in favor of this beer.","woemad","Jul 04, 2006"
4.06,4.6,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Mouth: The first thing I notice is the strong carbonation, hitting the front of the mouth and continuing all the way through. The beer tastes predominantly of malts, starting smooth and finishing even stronger. It carries a touch of sourness that I normally don't like in my dark beers, but this one was not harsh enough to scare me away, and actually added some character. Some black pepper taste and a warm alcohol exhale.","clickpush","Jun 19, 2006"
4.2,8.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Picked up a mini-growler and an 11.2 ounce bottle (best before dating of 23/08/08 on the cap)of this brew @ Half time this afternoon. Both versions pour a nice warm dark almond shade of amber, the bottled version seems to be much more highly carbonated. Dark tan head, better retention on the bottled sample and similar spotty lacing left behind.Similar nose of sweet caramel, and malted sweet milk, more prevelant in the growler sample. Srong, flavorful brew, notes of brandy, malted chocolate milk, caramel, bitter dark chocolate and some vanilla. I preferred the growler version, smoother, lower carbonation, give this a try if you like dark, strong Belgians. Nice night cap kind of brew or perhaps give it a try with a chocolate dessert.","Billolick","May 13, 2006"
3.87,-0.3,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"33 cl bottle, crown stamping dated 23 Aug 08. Pours a muddy dark brown with port wine colored highlights. Fizzy, topped light khaki head. Suggestions of cocoa and biscuit drizzled with chocolate. Faint yeasty notes complicate the aroma. I always like running across these Belgian "stouts", they always amaze me how the brewers can capture glimpses at UK's best stouts whilst maintaining most of their quinessential Belgian style. The first couple of sips were the best, with the most pronounced stout character lingering through. Afterward, the beer drifted towards a more typical dark Belgian strong ale- some sherry, some dark roasted candi sugar and malt, and light chalkdust yeastiness. A bit more woody than I expected. Almost like it was a mad experiment of aging a Belgian dark ale in some old London Porter cask. Creamy, tasty, lightly astringent and strong.","crookedhalo","May 05, 2006"

4.43,14.2,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Wow was this ever a treat. It looked like chocolate pudding with a half inch of dense head that could've been whipped cream. The nose was dark berries and a spicy sweetness. The first sip, and all that follow are thick and creamy, with the taste dominated by very mild plums, and trailed by seductive roastiness. Anyone who enjoys either stouts or the darker belgian ales will probably enjoy this. Anyone who likes both will be thrilled! Each sip was sheer delight!","TheBungyo","Mar 23, 2006"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Aroma is deeply fruity with cherry, apple and pear sticking out. Ample candied fruit notes as well. Cloudy red/brown with a typically large and fluffy Belgian style head. For is fruity with candy sugar and yeast also getting equal play. This tastes much more like a dubbel and even less like a Stout than Hercule. If there are chocolate malts in here they are lost int he sweetness and alcohol which is more assertive than Id expect from an 8% brew. Still this does taste and feel good and while it isnt my idea of a stout it is my idea of a good beer.","Jredner","Feb 17, 2006"
4.03,3.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall: I like the bitter-sweet profile in this Mild Stout. Not sure it has enough differentiation to be listed as a Stout though. Interesting stuff and well worth trying.","TheLongBeachBum","Feb 03, 2006"
3.73,-3.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a black color ale with a huge foamy dirty brown head with pretty good retention. Aroma of sweet malt with distinctive Belgian yeast note. Some sweet malt with a slightly bitter and coffee finish also dominates taste. More reminiscent of a Belgian dark ale then a stout but interesting nonetheless. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden.","Phyl21ca","Dec 21, 2005"
4.45,14.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"D: nearly full-flavoured, it's not a terribly complex brew but shows a very clear and balanced structure for a strong dark beer, without sharp alcohol intervention anywhere throughout the drink~~ A beautiful, mellow dark beer to savour as digestif!","wl0307","Sep 23, 2005"

4.25,9.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Nose is huge amounts of malts ranging from roast to to caramel but still being fresh, probably because of the good amount of yeastester.
