The nose is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a slight hops presence that all blends together into an intoxicating, dark aroma. Roasted palate, with bitter coffee highlights and cocoa nib characteristics. The aftertaste is smokey and roasted, with a smooth, bitter finish.

The aroma is vibrant and complex with dark malts and dark fruit accompanied by a pungent earthy or pine hopped bitterness. The body is medium to bold.

Really nice and at less than $6 for a bomber it is a good value too.

4.01,3.4,5,4,4,3.5,4,"Been saving this one for a while now. Pitch black opaque beer. Light brown head that's holding nicely and clinging to the glass. Looks good. Smells ultra chocolaty with a hint of booze in the aroma. Smooth in terms of booziness, but it is very acidic on the tongue. Nice bread flavors, toast mixed with intense dark chocolate. Flavors build up and finger for a while. The smokiness comes off more like an ashy flavor, I'm not really into it. Strong and very dark beer. Probably should have busted this one out in the winter.","mlazzaro","Jul 13, 2011"

3.95,1.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Very dark, basically black, with a fine cap of brown bubbles. Good head retention, thick and clumpy lacing. Smells malty, caramel and a little toffee, roast, with grassy hops. Nutty and a bit citrusy, earthy with a hint of licorice behind more prominent molasses. Bitterness was solid and balanced the caramel sweetness, lots of grapefruit, alcohol, chocolate and roast, hint of sour cherries, lots of biscuity flavor. Full bodied, lowish carbonation, mild warmth, fairly smooth in texture. Tasty!","DrJay","May 13, 2011"

4.1,5.7,4,4,4,5,4,"Poured a slow to emerge 2"" mocha colored head. Body is dark as coffee. Smells of chocolate malt and hops. Taste is a weaker form of the chocolate malt and a stronger form of the hops. There's a nice acidic zing. All of this so far would have landed it somewhere in B range to me but the long long finish moved it across the border into A-. Like the end of the label write-up says it's ""a resiny hop finish that lasts & lasts"". Yes it does. Plus I don't see on the bottle how much alcohol this has but I had quite the happy buzz after my pint.","MoreThanWine","Apr 23, 2011"
3.41,-12.1,4.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Saw this one today at Mile High Wine just west of Denver, not knowing Cisco was distributed out here. Poured a medium black color with a loose finger of light brown foam.

4.14,6.7,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This is one deep, complex stout. Bottle-conditioned, not much head forms over (or remains from) the thick-as and dirty-as spent motor oil viscous malt nectar that silkily pours out. Superb, seemingly bottomless depth to the aroma. A bit yeast-funky and oxidized maybe, dark pureed dried fruit softly pokes through a predominantly rich, 3-day old chocolate-biscuit malt aroma accented with a smooth toasty roastiness. Damn near milk-forward (chilled) hot cocoa density carries a quasi-sweetish, cakey, not so much bitter yet toasty-burnt-gritty cocoa malt taste. A drink to be sipped and savored. That subtle funk rears its head from time to time, but really only to yawn heartily and sink back into its delicious pillow. Yeah, I really liked this and can't wait to try it again, my friend.","Bouleboubier","Mar 11, 2011"

Where it actually stood apart was in the feel, where it was overly smooth and soft drinking.

4.33,11.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. This must be a fresh bottle, because the first thing I can smell in this brew after pouring it into the glass is pine hops. There's also roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and dark fruit in the aroma. Once the beer has been in the glass a little while, the malty aromas get stronger. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt and a bit of caramel. The malty flavors come out stronger in the taste, but the hops are still pretty noticable. This is one of the hoppier stouts I've had recently. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and velvety. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth, tasty and just plain easy to drink! I think this is a pretty good overall brew, the next time I head to the East Coast I'll have to buy this again.

Overall this was very hoppy for a stout, reminding me much more of a black IPA. It still had a clean and fairly enjoyable flavor, with decent body. It hid the alcohol well too, so it was pretty easy to drink. This beer was nice and interesting, and I would recommend trying it once. Just don't expect anything amazing.","Pencible","Apr 23, 2010"

I'm not sure if there are some wild yeasts in here or if its supposed to taste this way. The Belgian character is subtle, but its strong enough to notice and the carbonation is a bit high.

There is just a ton of malt in the beer and it is well balanced with leafy hop.

Sadly, this is a bit too one-dimensional for me, and I find myself missing the complexities picked up in the aroma. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and watery for a stout, more porter-like in its consistency. (Burps are tasting like band-aids...gross).

The aroma has some chocolate, and a little french roast but overall is not as strong as I would've liked. The taste is of baker's chocolate, slightly bitter, and some hops linger.

4.1,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"This growler came from the brewery on Nantucket, and was served at about forty degrees. Pour was in to a chalice style glass. Color was pitch black, with a sizable tan heading, which is very characteristic of encounters with this beer in the past, but more controlled (meaning I did not have to wait 15 minutes for the massive heading to die down). Smell reveals roasted coffee bean, hints of marshmallow, more hints of blackberry, intermingling of dark and milk chocolates as well. Taste is very complex. Loads of bitter coffee flavors come through, as well as an ample earth bound taste that takes some time to get used to. More evidence of dark bitter chocolate builds as it glides around the palate. mouthfeel is fairly medium when considering the strength of its alcohol. Certainly packed with flavor from all the bitter coffee and earth tones. Drinkability suffers only a little bit because is takes a bit of getting used to. This is my second glass tonight, and I cannot see myself going back to it until...mmmm probably tomorrow night. Overall, this in my eyes is one of the most unique stouts, and possibly beers that New England has to offer. It is a shame that you rarely see brews from Cisco on tap apart from their Whale's Tale Pale Ale (even though that is another good beer). One to seek out for sure, and if you are on the island, get a growler, as it is much better than out of the bottle. Cheers","jamie2dope","Dec 10, 2008"

Dark malt acidity greets you upfront (it's definitely not acetic or lactic, but it is somewhat tart), followed by some mild notes of bittersweet chocolate, and then some sweeter notes of creamy caramel. Restrained, but distinctly spruce-like hops appear immediately at the swallow; and help to usher in its dry and lingering earthy finish.

The flavor and body are thin. Some chocolate, some lingering hop bitterness. Definitely not one of the fuller flavored stouts of this size.","aracauna","Jan 01, 2004"

4.36,12.4,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On the pour, a tall dark and handsome beer this one, the head a majestic chocolate crown that is creamy in consistency with the lace a thick and sticky blanket upon the glass. Toasted grains dominate the coffee and chocolate like nose, that is also fresh, crisp and somewhat sweet nose, a real treat to sniff, start is thick malt, sweet and the top full bodied and in feel. Finish is delectable in its hop spicy bite, the carbonation moderate, bittersweet chocolate dry and a fine drinking stout that is a true treat, just a shame they donÂ’t export this far west, good thing I have some good ole BA buddies in the east to thank for this one.","Gusler","Oct 20, 2003"

3.45,-11.1,4,4,3.5,2.5,3,"A mild, but incessant gusher... Beneath the tremendously thick, excessive carbonation induced, dark beige, sticky head lies a virtually black brew with flashes of clear deep garnet when held to light. With patience, the head settles into a manageable, blanket of loose foam fluff. Sweet, milky chocolate malt and caramel combination upfront in aroma, supported by a buttery diacetyl undertone. Mellow suggestion of mocha dipped pear adds a stately fruity contrast. Understated, but well rounded aromawise. Sharp, lightly tart carbonic acid bite hits the palate at first, then yields to a balanced combination of burnt barley bitterness and deeply toffeeish dark lovibond caramel malt. Roasted grain presence tapers mid palate, allowing moderate hop bitterness and chocolate malt to surface concomintantly, lending a dryish, only lightly sugared baker's chocolate presence. Faint, token prune like esters emerge late along with a mild, but perceptibly nut driven impression of spicy nutmeg and dry roasted almond. Persistently prickly in mouthfeel, from both the high attenuation and over carbonation. As the CO2 dissipates, the overall body is revealed to be thinnish, with its passable viscosity somewhat akin to that of an American brown ale. Finishes mostly dry, yet pleasantly sweet, with notes of molasses drizzled graham crackers and butter. Captain Swain is a flavorful stout unfortunately marred by overcarbonation. The superfluous attenuation suggests they prematurely bottled... This is more spritzy than a Duvel! Drinkability is only decent simply due to the inherent patience required for dealing with its excessive carbonation. Almost an excellent stout, but their yeast strain apparently behaved unpredictably. Tasty nonetheless and without outright flavor flaws.","marc77","Jun 18, 2003"
4.05,4.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: I could drink this again. The phenolic taste and high carbonation seem to be an across-the-board problem with Cisco, but I think they could have some damn good brews if they managed to fix a few lingering problems. Still, this is an extremely tasty foreign/export-style stout.","MJR","Jun 16, 2003"
4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Lost 1/3 my big bottle to the overflow... d'oh! Pour really really dark with a solid head. Quite bitter. A bit of sweet. Other than a slight burnt coffee flavor in the back ground, this come across as a quite nice beer. Very complex. Ends dry. Not the best stout, but worth a sample.","scottum","Feb 26, 2003"
4.4,13.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Part of a 4-bottle sampler pack from Cisco that included a cd of some truly lame white-boy island groove music. You can almost picture the guys practicing all summer in their parents' vacation beach house with their faded college baseball caps on backwards. Ah, Nantucket! But I digress; on to the beer. Pitch black with lively head that recedes, almost completely. A couple big floating chunks of... yeast, perhaps? Exceptionally fruity aroma for a stout with some burnt brown sugar. Bittersweet chocolate, coffee, caramel, and huge roasty malts start things off, with that fruity yeast providing an eloquent twist, letting you know this is no ordinary stout. Incorporates sweeter elements of an oatmeal stout with the figgy, raisiny elements of an imperial stout or robust porter. Finishes with an excellent balance of dryness (from the hops) and sweet fruitiness that is pretty wet, almost cloying, tempting you to go back for more. This is a pretty remarkable stout. It requires your undivided attention; sit back and appreciate the achievement of balancing the roastiness of the dark malts with the exciting fruitiness of the yeast.","Thrasher","Jan 28, 2003"
4.77,22.9,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Black enough to leave fingerprints on coal, this brew doesn't allow the slightest hints of light around its edges with a good brown head that sinks but leaves a nice lace.  Huge chocolate aromas along with some nice roasted coffee in the background.  Taste starts off extremely chocolatey with some subtle dark roasted coffee flavors tagging along all the way through.  The brew finishes with a lingering bitter coffee taste that is a perfect ending.  The brew is very creamy but not quite as chewy as I would like and a little too carbonated.  This brew reamains very drinkable and is yet another big time winner from Cisco Brewers.","Murph","Aug 14, 2002"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: It's not very accessible at the time of this review, comes in big bottles and is $7 a pop. That said, you'd probably be spending your money well as this is a very decent stout with some rare characteristics for the market -- big time smoke flavours. Complex, unique and robust. I very much enjoyed this brew.","Todd","Feb 21, 2001"
