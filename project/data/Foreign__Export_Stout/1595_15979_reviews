"Real chocolatey made me wanting more"

"O: Beautiful Tassie, one of my favourite places on the planet but not for the beer."

"Food match: Ideal main course would be a hearty beef stew with a chocolate cake/tart/pudding for dessert."
""
"Overall: The finish is kind of a deal breaker for me. I like the aroma, appearance, and the first 2/3rds of the taste."

"I picked this up a few years back in New Zealand on my way down to Antarctica. I remember thinking it was much better than the light lagers we had access to down at McMurdo Station. I still think it is a solid beer, though by no means an Import Stout. Really this falls somewhere between a stout and a black ale with the simpler flavor profile and lighter mouthfeel compared to a traditional stout. Still, it hits the spot and is highly drinkable. I would get a few sixes (about $10 each) of this if I get the chance to go back to the ice."

"O: Nice stout but seems to be a bit lacking in richness and character."
"Overall: Not too bad, especially from a 'macro' brewery that normally produces standard adjunct lagers, but not nearly as full-bodied and complex as a good stout should be. Definitely more of a sessionable stout."
""
"O: An example of what an average Australian thinks a “stout” should be. Coffee, roasted malt and a milky mouth feel that completely confuses with a super dryness sucking your face off. Going in for another drink is the only way to remove the barren milk scum feel, followed swiftly by the cold coffee and burnt malt. Desperate times call for desperate measures it seems."

"Havnt had this for ages and after going to my nearest country local there was not too many dark options anyway it pours a dark black hue with a fast vanishing two finger head and hardly any lacing,the smell is roasted barley,toasty malts,a slight fruitiness,kola and dark cocoa nibs,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and suprisingly not as bad as i remember although i do like a thicker mouthfeel in my stouts but for a macro effort not bad,the tastes are pretty simple with hints of roasted barley,black coffee with no milk,a herbal fruitiness and finished with a dark chocolate bittersweetness and overall its average but alot better than i remember it being and i am just glad that the Macro Squad have not forgotten their dark beer lovers as its definately a better option when faced with only a macro range as there is def more to it than their usual lineup cheers."
"All in all a good stout for ABV, if not great. Far too one-dimensional."
""
"O/D - Fairly typical of a commercial stout. A good alternative to a macro lager but no more. Wouldn't get it again unless nothing else interesting was available."
""
"D-- At 5.8% it is very drinkable. It is a bit hard to find as Coopers Stout really dominates the market in Australia. Still, this is a good stout. It has some weak points but this is an enjoyable stout. A workable offering from one of the big breweries in Australia. With a little more body this would be very good."

"O- I like it. Easy to drink and nicely warming on a cold winters night. It's nothing exceptional but honestly, I really didn't expect a whole lot. That being said, this is a fine effort from cascade."
"O - This stout suprised me a lot and is probably just behind Southwarks and Coopers Best Extra as the best off the shelf mass produced stout in Australia."
"A decent commercial stout. Nothing special but certainly not bad."
"Decent enough, and surprisingly easy to find in the more generic pubs in Hobart. Wish there was such a good option readily available in the shite pubs I occasionally have to visit in Sydney."
"It's a bit too spritzy for my liking. I find the mouthfeel really detracts from the good flavours."
"A smooth, drinkable stout and, I must say, a pleasant surprise from Cascade. It's a bit mild for a stout but that just makes it more palatable. Good effort."
"I've said it before; I am not a stout drinker, I would choose a porter over a dry stout any day. That said, I still think this qualifies as sub-par. It only really has one flaw, but that flaw (overly burnt bitterness) completely ruins the beer for me. It's not priced badly, but after this experience, I probably won't be getting it again."
"Pours a very thick dark black/brown. I can't see any light through it at all. There's also about an inch and a half of creamy tan head that fades away to leave a nice layer that clings to the glass. Smells very chocolatey and coffeeish.. A nice roast aroma. The taste also has a lot of chocolate and coffee in it, and some hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is fairly watery and a little harsh. All in all, it's a really drinkable stout.The price is right, I'd probably get this again."
"This one was hard for me to really the whole mix was just too bitter. Maybe too much carbonization or a caramel malt might smooth it over?"
"Label 8/10"
"Very smooth, good carbonation, decent brew, I'd try it again as it goes down smooth. Thanks sammy."
"Black with lace in glass. Appropriate carbonation and medium mouthfeel. More bitterness than roast, some coffee, caramel malt and syruppy sweetness chunk in the middle. Bittersweet finish. Drinkable reasonable stout.Thanks DouglasD for bringing back."
"M - Pass on this light beer posing as a craft beer stout."
"this would be a bit better than the export stout, but only just."
