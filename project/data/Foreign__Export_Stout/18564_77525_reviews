"Overall:  A bit too burnt and roasty and I also didn't care for the mouthfeel but the beer has its attributes and is worth a try"

"Conclusion: A very good dark beer. I have always liked this style, but often found American versions to be uninspired. I personally think the Guiness Foreign Extra to be an outstanding beer and the benchmark for the style, and although this is beer isn't quite at that level, it is doing its own thing and doing it well. Worth being proud of for Upslope. I could drink this regularly."

"O: It's alright, I don't know if I'd drink it again because I favor Left hands fade to black, but I was craving a stout and it satisfied my craving."

"Edit: yep, it is referred to so I guess this is what the brewer intended."

"Pours a very dark black, and smelled coffee right off the bat. The head went away about immediately. The nose has plenty of coffee and chocolate and some toasted walnuts. Flavor is pretty good. Not too bold like other stouts. Lots of chocolate and coffee and for being over 8%, there are no trace amounts of alcohol. Dry finish with lingering flavors of coffee and chocolate. Very good!"

"It's not a knock-your-socks off stout, but is definitely a user-friendly stout and very drinkable. It comes with a robust flavor but isn't a big boozy carbohydrate packed stout (that I enjoy very much.) I respect that."

"Can poured into glass. Pours black with tan head that retains nicely. The nose starts with some fruity notes, mainly raisins. This is paired with chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of creaminess. The taste is fruit forward again with notes of raisin dominating. This gives way to a tangy metallic character that isn't working for me. Some roast appears up front but is ultimately drowned out by fruit and metallic notes. Mouthfeel is light for style with appropriate level of carbonation. Overall, this one just isn't working for me."

"TASTE: Silky smooth, creamy body, sweetness up front, coffee, unsweetened chocolate, brown malt, soft charcoal, burnt raisins, black currants, faint licorice root, drying sooty finish"

"I'm by no means a huge fan of stouts but I do like Upslope and wanted to give this one a shot. I think it's a solid offering and would get it the next time I'm in the mood for the style."

"I released it with a mighty Crack, allowing some off-gassing of CO2. The inverted Glug would have made Guinness envious with its pseudo-cascading action. I dislike when I hear people say, ""Oh, I don't like dark beer"" because color generally has little to do with it, but cases like this one hearten me. It finally settled into a dense cap of two fingers of deep-tan head that sat atop the beer like a muffin top. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled of dark chocolate, smoky burnt wood, dried dark fruit, charcoal and molasses. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching a fullness on the tongue. The taste was initially very smoky before the dark chocolate broke through. Lacing had already begun to form in the glass. The finish was semi-sweet, quite chocolaty, but with the smokiness lingering after the swallow. Hoo hah! My, but this was good! It was, for me, more of a dessert beer than something that I would put into my cooler. I am glad for the opportunity to have tried it in its limited release."

"O-This is not my favorite Upslope offering. As noted above, the whole package is a bit simple and the taste is a bit metallic and hot. Perhaps this is the true export style, because I think some time in a cargo hold (or cellar...) might mellow the harsh aspects of this beer."
"Upslope's Foreign Style Stout does a reasonably good job at replicating the asserted roast character that's displayed in similar version such as Guinness Foreign Extra Stout but it is a little softer on the roast than is expected. Even with the gentle hand, it makes for a very tasty stout that will appease all lovers of the devoted black beers."

"Thanks again to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, some coffee. Taste s slightly sweet, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, a hint of hops. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"Overall this was a solid offering and example of an overlooked style in America. A more drinkable and flavorful version of the most popular example in the world Guinness Foreign extra stout and it's in a can, so I approve."
""
"My take: Another great showing by Upslope. I would love to try this beer on nitro; a hardy head seems important to the conveyance of the flavor and mouthfeel of this beer. I look forward to a less bready accompaniment to this beer. A mild cheese (bad provolone? good mozzarella?) would go well with this, as would low-garlic hummus."

"o - overall, nice export stout nothing crazy, but nice representation of the style."
""
""
"Overall, just not fun. Not enough taste profiles, and way too heavy."
"O - Overall this was an average or so beer. Pretty straightforward execution here."
""
"Low C+"
"Overall, a nice dry stout - one of Upslope's better beers."
"O: solid, not excellent, but I'd drink this. Roasted characteristics are everything here, and it does it well. Drink fresh, most likely."
""

"O: A solid stout. Great taste and aromas, but lacking in the appearance and MO department."
"O: A decent stout. Surprisingly thin for 6.9%. Nothing wrong with it, just didn't really do it for me."
"Black with a thumbs width brown head that quickly dropped to s a slight surface coating. Toasted barley, some chocolate, some sweet dark fruits, and a little bit of metal. Flavor is strong from the roasted barley, a sharp sweetness carries through it, a little dark fruit, and nutty. Thinner in body a stout but it works. Creamy mouthfeel to it. A decent stout but nothing spectatular. I'd happily drink it again but probably won't be seeking this out on my own again."
"This is the first Upslope that I did not particularly enjoy having. It looks the part smells nice but all down hill with more lactic acid astringency and overroasted malt. Very little coffee or chocolate. If the acidity could be toned down I would enjoy the nuttiness and dark fruit a bit more. As it is right now not worth seeking out."
"Can from Denver. Seems to be in great condition. A pleasant quaff, and stronger than it tastes."
"OVERALL: This is a pretty solid and easily drinkable stout. It is a nice change of pace for a hop head that loves bitterness even though it doesn’t have the traditional hop bitterness."
"Overall this was a decent representation of a foreign stout. I prefer Lion stout more, dont think I'll be buying this one anytime soon."
"O - Not anything close to what I wanted... I love the can, but could give or take the beer... I know UpSlope is capable of better, so c'mon guys put on those thinking caps and blow me away with your next brew, perhaps it should be your famous Belgian ;)"
"O: Pretty good stuff, I'm glad I've got 5 more cans of this to dive into. Not something to brag endlessly about, but a pretty solid export stout."
""
"D - It's an average stout at best. The flavors are just too muted and simple."

"good stout. not amazing. pours a nice heavy dark roast color with a good creamy almost nitro looking off white head. smells a little more candy-like than a lot of stouts, but the flavor isnt too sweet. just in the nose. also some almost burnt barley type smells, and some definite alcohol. flavor is burnt too, but a nice bitter burnt vibe, hop bitter too, which is nice here. also plenty of mellow flavors, vanilla somewhere, dark chocolate too. mouthfeel is in harmony with the rest of whats going on. full bodied but drinkable, nice bitterish finish, the thing that throws me though is a rubbing alcohol kind of flavor at the end, really makes the mouthfeel kind of tart. just a little off at the end, but aside form that a nice milky thick strong sessionable stout. there is not a bad upslope beer, but they all have that kind of finish. not sure if its the can or what. i love ""snowmelt"" as the primary ingredient in each of their brews."
"Overall, I came away mixed. This particular can is working for me, but the others weren't. Perhaps a quality control issue here? Still, it's a nice little beer that I'm glad I tried."
"Overall a good beer for me. Good flavors without going over the top. No signs of abv. Good drinkability."

"I picked up a sixer of this for $10.49 despite my better judgement but I really liked their brown ale. Dark black color witha scant set of bubbles, uh oh. Smells like roasted malt, stout, not bad but kind of average. The taste was a decent stout but nothing that really made me want to reach for another one. I think the big problem with this is that all of my cans seemed pretty flat and it was not reminiscent of cask beer if that is what they were going for. Disappointing."
"An excellent canned stout..."
"try it!"
"Mouthfeel is medium which makes this 6.9% beer highly drinkable and pretty sessionable."

"I know this beer is selling like hotcakes in the Denver area. It didn't blow me away, but is a very solid and drinkable beer."
"The low carbonation is definitely something that could be improved upon, but if they can fix that it’s a pretty admirable take on an export stout."
"O: A decent stout. Not roasty enough and too flat in my opinion."
"Had this one on tap the other night at the Vine Street Pub in Denver, as part of the stout month celebration. Needed a beer to fill out a taster set and chose this one. Black, with a decent head. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate and malted milk. Medium bodied, very roasty, with baker's chocolate, malted milk and malt."
