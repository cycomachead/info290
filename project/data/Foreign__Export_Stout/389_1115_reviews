review_text
"Smooth and well round mouthfeel within its medium to bold body and very lively carbonation, this brew is so drinkable considering its ABV. Yes, the alcohol is so well hidden."
""
""
"I really liked this beer. It's well-made and very tasty and drinkable. I'd drink it again without thinking twice. Makes me wonder what it is about beers like this one that make them better than so many of today's overdone imperial stouts."
""
""
""
"I had this beer sitting in my fridge for a few weeks and was excited to try it. I was extremely disappointed. This ranks down in the top 5 worse beers I can remember."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a tulip pint. Dark, almost black; fluffy tan head. Smell is sweet roastiness, maybe some coffee notes. Taste is quite sweet, but the slightly charred flavor at the back keeps it from being cloying. Thick and smooth. A pleasant beer."
"My first Sri Lankan beer that I know of.  Good all-around, nice and roasty and stout.  Nothing that blows me away though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour looks great. Everything else is avg at best. Smell and taste like its a stout with farm house taste."
""
"The outstanding flavor profile is intense, complex and well balanced.  It begins with a blend of flavors that separate into chocolate, a hint of coffee and very subtle prune.  In the middle, the big malt sweetness comes forward with a molasses and caramel flavor against a mild bitterness of citric hops and roast.  The finish is a slow sweet fade and leaves you with that nice slight alcohol burn at the back of the throat amid an effervescent burst."
""
""
"Owns a pitch black pour and rich caramel head. Carries a green olive aroma and accompanied with the same, in taste. Smooth body. Overall, worth the try!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This one comes highly recommended by a few folks, and the guy at the bottleshop offered to buy it back if I didn't like it. They were all correct. This one should be on the must-have list for anyone who's a fan of stouts."
"Interesting stout, less creamy and a bit more carbonated than is typical. Distinct caramel and coffee flavored rather than chocolate. Rich, dark color with obvious higher alcohol content. A fine brew from Sri Lanka and above average for imports from that part of the world."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was very good. Pours deep black with caramel colored two finger head. Aroma is that of espresso and roasted malt with a noticeable alcohol presence. Taste follows nose well, espresso and chocolate, deep roasted smokey characteristics, good alcohol warming, very well balanced. Feel is thick and creamy, good body and carbonation. Overall a fantastic brew, well worth venturing into the import area to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with light tan head, thicker too. Raw cocoa, roasted malt, and brown sugar on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with roasted malt."
""
""
"O- As far as high gravity affordable stouts go, this one's pretty tasty."
"Had a bottle in the US and I did not enjoy this.  This is probably due to the fact there is no way to know how long the bottle has been on the shelf and how it was treated getting there.  Eitherway, probably not the best beer to chose to export to the US."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A well rounded stout overall. Now having had this in the US and Sri Lanka, there is a definite difference in the quality of the beer depending on the location. I've had this in can and bottles in the US, but othing beats having it on Draft in Colombo."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: an decent and unusual stout, a bit expensive at AU$90+ a case. The flavours come across a bit harsh with an alcohol fug, but the flavours are reasonably well rounded. I will have one every now and then."
""
""
""
"Ok - bit watery"
"Food match: I imagine a big Sri Lankan curry would sort this Stout out sharpish."
"Served on tap in a half pint glass. Got a lot of prune flavor and smell that I haven't gotten from any other beer before."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"0: A very unexpected, and pleasant surprise. The aromatics and flavor of this beer left me quite shocked, as it does a great job in both attributes. mouthfeel aside, this is a good beer. Not hunt it down, or a new standby, but one that I could be happy with drinking on most occasions."

"Amazingly complex for a stout. Truly needs to be savored. Unique aftertaste that is crisp for a stout."
""
""
""
"I noted this one specifically for the big complex aromas on the nose. I was getting chocolate, honey, vanilla, banana, pear, apple, coffee, espresso and roast. It poured a very dark, opaque brown with a light brown head. It had a nice silky, creamy mouthfeel, with a medium to full body and a light level of carbonation. To the taste there was big time chocolate and coffee, also vanilla, caramel, toffee and some subtle dark fruits. Aroma was definitely the star on this one, but it's hard to complain about anything really. It's a fantastic beer, very complex and easy drinking for a stout this big."
""
"Great malty taste right up front. Slight alcohol burn that tastes slightly metallic. Overall a well rounded stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was shocked at how good this was after hesitantly trying it for the first time. It is a solid stout with big flavor that will stand up to most anything. I can't put my finger on the taste but it has a nice sweet, but not too sweet, finish."
"Overall - Rather disappointing, was hoping for a big stout with great flavor and feel, and ended up with something limper and less tasty that expected. Maybe it was a bad bottle, but I really don't think so. I'll pass next time."
""
"Didn't impress me with the advertised ""chocolatey, mocha character", but it has a great complexity, great flavors with just a few faults, ignorable. Never imagined a beer from Sri Lanka of all places could be this good."
"An intense stout for sure. Kind of harsh the first time; liked it much more the second time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"thinner mouthfeel, despite the creaminess on the nose, but very, very drinkable. ultimately, I enjoyed this, but I think it strays off style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am surprised to see the metallic taste n 2 different reviews.  I found this Stout to be very smooth, malty and pleasant tasting.  I think Ceylon does a good job of hiding the high ABV which is uncommon in a Stout.  My Rating as  4.0 is a Good Beer,   not a wow -can't live without.  but a Beer  I would recommend."
"Dark black with a creamy head. Some chocolate, cocoa and dark roasted malt make up the  smell. Smooth mouthfeel. Chocolate, some slight bitterness, and a strong alcohol flavor comprise the taste.  A decent, strong stout. A little heavy on the alcohol taste, but otherwise is an OK Stout."
""
""
""
"a little bitter on end, not so creamy ;(    Metallic Taste  Yuck"
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  One of the smokiest non-smoked (or maybe it is, I'm not sure) beers I've ever had. Very nice sipper, although I doubt it's very refreshing in hot and humid Sri Lanka."

"An absolutely excellent export stout. I could drink a ton of this and be really happy."
""
""
""
""
"Quite a treat. Easy drinking Stout with complex flavors. Amazing caramel, dark chocolate, light roasted coffee flavor. Kept asking Sri Lanka makes great beer??!"
""
""
"8.8% alcohol lends a smooth bitterness which is noticeable but not disagreeable. Not the most complex stout, but largely enjoyable."

"O: a bit underwhelming... had this a couple times in the past and though it was pretty good, however, I've always seemed to confuse this with Dragon Stout from Jamaica... this was a tough one to grade because I feel like something was off here..."
""
""
"o: A very tasty stout, light bodied enough to be enjoyable in warm weather as well as cool."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This is a good stout, but would be better if it was just a bit sweeter."
""
""
""
""
"O 4.0) Quite enjoyable. I haven't looked yet to see the availability of this beer but my beer guy said it was the first time they had had it in two years. If I can find it more though I think that this could become a staple. Easy to drink with a middlin' ABV content of 8.8%."

""
""
"Overall, it was just Okay. Dont hate it, but would not choose it again if given other options."
""
""

"O - well you don't expect great stouts to come from Sri Lanka but this is a great stout. Full of flavour,body and balance. One of those really nice surprises that you get every once in a while."

"Very nice. I hope it becomes more widely available because it's my go-to stout now."
"O- solid export stout, similar to Guinness FES and probably rates a bit underneath it. Recommended if there isn't anything else good under the stouts section of the draft list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Despite my pessimism it's a pretty fine beer, just that it falls short compared to other members of its genus. Of all the strong stouts I've had it is the least delicious."
""
"O: Great drinkability. Excellent Foreign Stout. Big surprise"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lion Stout is my first taste of the foreign/export stout style. This ale has made me a fan!...I'll have another."
""
""
"I've seen this stout for years on the shelf and avoided it based upon its location of origin; I couldn't have been more wrong. This stout pours a near black color with a small tan head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is a very pleasant familiar blend of coffee, chocolate, sweet roasted malts, dried fruit, and vanilla. Mouthfeel is a little flat, could definitely use a little more creaminess. The flavor is exactly as the nose foretold but, unfortunately, there is a long lasting metallic aftertaste that spoils what would be a truly outstanding stout. Hard to believe the abv, it is so well hidden. For its cost and availability this could definitely become a go to stout for me...just lose the metal in the finish."

"Final Grade: 4.01, an excellent A-. I am far from an authority on export stouts, mostly because very few of them are exported to Ontario. Still, I know what I want from a strong stout - and Sinha manages to deliver in spades. Big roasted malt flavours, with good balance and well-integrated alcohol is enough to earn this one a solid grade and some repeat purchases from myself. At $2.50 a bottle, Sinha Stout is very affordable, and something that no self-respecting stout fan should skip."

"This is my go to stout! At any time a bomber of this goes down sooo smooth, almost too smooth. At above 8% it sure has the ability to go down quick. Beautiful in the glass. Dark fruit aroma, with coffee and chocolates as well on the palate. Some may not like it, some may think its too cheap in a sense...but to me, for the price, year round availability and great all around character of this brew, it's a winner. Cheers!"
"Very drinkable, creamy and full of taste."
""
""

"Enjoy!"

"O: Great winter beer. Enjoyed it. A must try. But I am not importing any more from so far away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought this was a great beer. I wasn't expecting much from it for some reason but upon tasting it it was great. It's pretty strong and the fact that the alcohol taste isn't very obvious is a huge plus. Would definitely have it again."
""
""
""
"I couldn't recommend this beer any more strongly. Go and get it!"
""
""
"O. It's very solid. I like the mix of flavors. A semi-metallic aftertaste is left though."
""
""
"One of my favorite stouts overall, and definitely my favorite one that isn't limited/fancy/hard to find. When you factor in the price, this is very nearly a perfect beer. Less than $10 for a four pack of 500ml cans or under $5 for a bomber, unbelievable. I'm sure a lot of the low reviews are of infected/""off"" batches, judging by how different some of the descriptions are. I've got a pretty big backlog of beers at home to work through, and yet I just keep buying more Lion Stout. It's a versatile beer suitable for thoughtful sipping or just partying and tossing back. A true classic!"
""
""

"I like this quite a bit and would handily get this again. Really good stout - one of my favorites that I've had this year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth: Very smooth and heavy. Perfect light carbonation one expects in a stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of my absolute favorite stouts. It has great flavor and wonderful drinkability. A single serving of this will cost you a small fortune where I live in Thailand, but it is a fortune well spent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Well this is too old, but besides the oxidation, it still tastes like regular Lion Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an extremely dark brown to black. Big rocky persistent tan head. Smell is roasted barley. Not a particularly strong aroma. Great complex malty flavor throughout. Sweetness. Raisins. Chocolate. A little roasted malt bitterness and hops. Medium bodied, maybe a little light bodied for a stout but it suits this beer nicely. Well carbonated. Perhaps the best thing about this beer is how crisp and refreshing it is despite being a big tasty stout. Astonishingly drinkable. Really great stuff."
""
""
""
""
" In a geographical area where finding even an 'adequate' beer is problematic, to tumble on a world class stout was a very pleasant shock. I never found this on tap, which I imagine would have been even better, but it ranks second in my experience to a nicely pulled Guinness pint in a pub in Ireland."
"Malty, toasty aroma. Thick, fairly quickly dissipating bubbly tan head. Flavours include roasted coffee, with sweet malt notes that fade to a nice, smooth bitter and dry finish, and very faint aftertase. Well carbonated, and striking hop presence challenges the sweetness. Warmth follows throughout."

"Overall: A really solid stout. My first beer from Sri Lanka - surprisingly good. Not one of my favorites, but I would look for it again. If you are looking for a great heavy stout to sip with a meal, this is a great choice."
"O - Heavy of the burnt characteristics, but tasty nonetheless. The ABV is surprisingly well hidden, making it quite drinkable. I would buy this again and certainly wouldn't pass up the opportunity to drink it if the option were available."
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- An easy drinking stout with smooth and mellow carbonation. Surprised this came in cans."
"O: Good beer the relax with at the end of the day. Well worth checking out."
"Overall: Wow, a great beer, especially when you consider it comes from and island off the coast of India."
""
""
"O - I love it. It is the best stout I've had so far. Sure I've had Guinness . I didn't enjoy Duck-Rabbit's milk stout. I liked North Coast's Old Rasputin, but I like this even more than the others it seems like I can tastes more things. Perhaps the flavors I perceive and enjoy will change in the future."
"O: This is good! No one taste is overwhelming as it is well balanced. Not as strong coffee and chocolate as a lot of stouts but the sweet malts and fruit are great. Definitely a sipper!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, jet black coloring with a thick, dense, light tan head that starts a solid inch and a half, and settles into a filmy coating as you drink. Aromas of coffee, charcoal, bittersweet chocolate, and a hint of molasses. Very balanced aromas of savory and bitter, with highlights of smoke. Flavors of roast and nut on the forward tongue, with a milk chocolate backbone accented by charcoal and smoke. Very smooth flavors that are layered by subtle bitter and camp smoke characteristics. The beer remains smooth and fairly light in mouth, despite the rich and stereotypically heavy flavors. Roasted and smoky aftertaste, with a smooth, slightly dry finish. Very balanced and easily drinkable stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a full black color with no opacity. Very thick head at pour relaxes to around the rim with a very healthy spotted lace on the glass. Aroma is dark, sweet malts with some dark chocolate presence and a hint of black licorice. Flavor is dominated by the dark malts - sweet up front with a mellowed backend."

""

"O-I was not sure what to expect here, but I enjoyed this brew. One of my favorite aspects was that it was devoid of coffee/whiskey/brett/barrel-aged gimmickry, but still managed to produce a pretty full-flavored stout. This is not Parabola, and it isn't trying to be, but I sort of like that."
"Overall, I would recommend this one."
"O- A big surprise from Sri Lanka."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a chocolately beer overall, however it's that classic roasted chocolate malt with no real no real chocolate chocolate flavor so you're deceived. It has a good mouthfeel and has good focus of qualities, but lingers in too specific of a range to be considered a classic. Don't let this review fool you, it's a significant achievement from a region of the world that doesn't have a history in this style of beer. It was a Sri Lankan student of mine who recommended this to me and almost concurrently, I discovered it on on my own. Great beer from the south pacific. If you like Youngs Chocolate Stout you will like this as a dialed-back derivation."
"overall - a solid beer, good example of the style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Just as solid and pleasant to drink as it was years ago. Its for sure not as tasty as some of the stouts offered nowadays but the sentimental value, 4.99$ for a 22ozer, makes it a winner. It is a little thin by todays standards but still its a quality drink, and something ill be enjoying for the rest of my life."
""
""
""
"O- I have nothing bad to say about this beer. It is better out of a glass then the can. A big, solid stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While this stout affords bold flavor and nice body, there is little in the way of synergy holding it together, and the alcohol becomes overbearing as the beer warms, making sipping a near necessity. Not a bad stout, but a bit too all-over-the-place for my tastes."
""
"Quite an unusually fruity stout but a very nice one nonetheless with a lot going on, especially with the depth of character in the smell. This one is certainly up there with the best stouts I have tried to date."

"Basically pitch black in colour, finger of tan head, good retention, solid lace as well. Smell is of dark chocolate, coffee and a huge roasted malt bill, bits of dark fruit come and go, milk chocolate as it warmed up. Taste is fairly roasted up front with milk chocolate, moderate sweetness, mild bitterness as well as some coffee and dark fruit in the finish. Medium carbonation, medium full body, nice full creamy feel here. Nice stuff and quite drinkable overall, certainly got my $2.05 worth on this one."
"Poured it and then sat down to drink it while reading the reviews on here. Noticed the first swig full of flavor and inviting. It was all downhill from there. It started getting sickly sweet or something offensive. I'm not sure if it was the mouthfeel or the flavors. Before a gag reflex set in, I rushed to the sink and poured the glass and what remained in the bottle down the sink. I switched to a Sam Adams Winter Lager but that would not enough to cleanse my palate. There's a reason a large bottle of this is only $3.50. Stay away."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/9/2011. Pours pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense mocha head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of raisin, apple, dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, herbal, light char, coffee, and earthiness. Nice aromas with good strength and balance; quite a bit on the fruity side. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, char, caramel, raisin, molasses, apple, light coffee, herbal, and earthiness. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, light fruit, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Good balance of roasted flavors with light herbal hoppiness; slight amount of cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a creamy, chalky, and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present on the finish. Overall this is a good foreign stout. Some nice robust roasted flavors with good complexity; quite smooth to sip on. A bit cloying at times, but is a nice sipper."

"O: This isn't a beer you drink 4-5 of. This beer is heavy and mind blowingly delicious. Once I stop trying beers, I imagine I'll come back to this one a few times."

"O: Not pleasant. Drainpour. Big disappointment. Pricepoint is the only reason behind the 2.5 here. Really sad I bought two bottles."

"Average porter. Average price. Average... ho hum... blah... move on... If you want something interesting, certainly don't look here. This beer is a porter... sure... it's a porter... yup... it sure is a porter! I'm pretty certain it's a porter. It tastes and looks and smells like a porter. It's a porter allright! I'm bored of this porter. It's unremarkable and average all the way through. Certainly an excellent find if it's on a bargain shelf but I'm sure you can find better tasting porters near you and not from halfway across the world... Unless you live in Sri Lanka!"

"Poured from bottle into Trappitst Westvleteren tulip glass. No idea the of the bottling date, my guess is fall 2011. Pour yields a dark brown almost black color, with frothy light brown head -- looks like a thick coffee. Two finger head recedes leaving some lacing and a thin layer of head; a bit more than a black a coffee, with a lighter head. Smell is not too overwhelming, not much there. Coffee and oatmeal aromas present, with a hint of licorice. Taste is nice and clean, coffee and oatmeal is persistent, but nothing too over the top. Hints of burnt flavors on the end. It is roasty. Mouthfeel is very clean and smooth, no bite. Feels like coffee roasts with no lingering harshness or bitterness. Overall this is a decent stout. Not my first choice or ""go-to"" by any means, but something I enjoy. If you like stouts, Lion Stout is something nice and easy to try."

"Served into a pilsner glass. Thin, dark head. The smell seemed to be missing something and so did the taste. Has a hint of chocolate for sure not the most powerful quality but it is a nice hint. overall it is a very good beer especially for the price."
""
""
""
"O - Very surprised with this beer, for I anticipated for it to much worse! A unique blend of flavors makes this one to try for sure. A fine way to mix up my normal rotation of stouts. Bravo!"
""
""
"A decent, strong stout. A little heavy on the alcohol taste, but otherwise is a well-rounded dark ale."
""
"Pours a very dark brown, bordering on black color with a nice 2 finger tan, cappuccino colored head that recedes quickly to leave a film across the top of the beer. The aroma is dark bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee beans and some molasses and brown sugar notes. On the palate this beer shows the 8.8% with a slight warming sensation that plays nicely with the strong flavor profile of the beer. The flavors i get are burnt sugar, molasses, black stale coffee and a hint of cream. Very roast and malty with a surprisingly refreshing dry finish that leaves traces of hop bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is dry, slightly astringent and has a much thinner body than i expected. Overall, this might be a ""summer"" stout as it is bordering on imperial in my book with this ABV. I used to pass this up all the time in the states but now that I am in a beer wasteland in Switzerland, this made its way into my fridge. Worth a shot."
"O: It's a great beer to have if you're preference is malt or dark, but if you're a hop-head (like me) I'd tread carefully. Still give it a shot and let the taste buds experience something new."
""
"This one was a very pleasant surprise. It drinks very nicely, and I found the flavours all blended very nicely. It does drink like quite a full/heavy beer. For the style I think it is quite a solid representation and worth buying again."

"O: Not bad, not great. About what I expected. Think this was getting a little past it's prime though. Glad I got to try a beer fro Sri Lanka!"
"330ml bottle. Snifter glass. Enjoyed on jul´11. Pours pitch black in color. Tan froth creates a creamy lasting & thick crown. Ripe grapes, raisins & hints of chocolate to the nose. Flavors & mouthfeel are dominated by a heavy sweetness. Quite cloying sensation."
""
"Overall a slightly above average stout. Really nothing too great here but nothing too terrible."
""
"a very smooth stout with a well hidden high abv. pours a rich dark chocolate color with a small tan head. smells semisweet, with dark malts and a touch of coffee. flavor is velvety chocolate malts and just the slightest alcoholy sting. mouthfeel is excellent. moderate carbonation and a silky smooth fuller medium body. this is dangerously easy drinking, and pairs well with big barbeque flavors. i dont know why i waited so long to try this one, i look forward to my next. who knew sri lanka made great beer?"

"Very nice - rich, thick and sweet. A well-balanced blend of flavours make this stout stand out, while the body does the style justice. A great beer to round off a session. Add this to your must-try list."

"A drinkable stout however not one that I would actively seek out given the other options I typically have. Glad I tried it and I can now tick off Ceylon on my countries list!"
""
""
""
"O: Much better than I was expecting, being that Sri Lanka is not one of the places that is renown for stouts. A little too sweet for me personally but a very enjoyable beer and easy to drink."
"Overall: I have had this plenty of times out of a can at the Brewhouse, but so happy I had the chance to buy it out of the bottle. I can't believe it is 8.8% and not even a hint noticeable. Will be drinking more of this in the future."
""
""
"O: not bad has good mouth feel with the carbonation, wouldn't mind sessioning with it but its not stellar."
"Overall: Not a favorite -- too boring."

"Notes: It's a solid beer all over. It's not overpowering even with it's 8.8% abv. Very drinkable and a good pick up. Cheers."

"Meh. As far as I'm concerned, Sri Lanka can keep it. It's not awful but I'll never look for it again. There are too many other worthwhile stouts out there to waste any more time/money on this. "

""

"O - Not too bad for the price being on the lower end, and has a decent amount of complexity, but something about the strange smell vs the taste kept if a lower rating for me."
""
""
"O-pretty good import stout without the heaviness kind of like a guiness with some better flavor and body"
"O: Easy to drink and seemingly simple initially. Complexity becomes apparent over the course of comsuming this one. Versatile. No indication whatsoever of it's 8.8% abv. One could easily confuse this with a much less potent beer. Very good overall."

"Sweet and light – a hot weather FES. Malt bomb, but easy and quenching. Interesting take on the style."

"O-Sri Lankans make a decent stout. Michael Jackson cannot be wrong as the label correctly implies."

"Overall, this beer is weird. Not necessarily in a bad way. But I do detect a weird glue smell and taste. I picked up the brown sugar presence later on as the beer warmed up. I will say that for 8.8% ABV, the alcohol is hardly detectable, which is awesome, I hate boozy beers. I've seen this in stores for years, and was curious. I won't ever have one again, but at least I know what it is. Not bad, just interesting."

"O - This beer should definitely be consumed at a warmer temp, more flavors work together and the body really starts to come out. Reasonably priced for what it is: a very well rounded stout."
""
""
""
""
"Very exotic and tasty-a lovely example of a tropical export stout. Always a good go-to export stout. Love it."
"D: Tasty with good complexity, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, although there are others in the style that I would choose first, this is a solid beer worth drinking for a while."

"O - A quality export stout, and just the ticket with some chocolate bisuits after dinner."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, I love using this stout for cooking but rarely buy it to drink. Not a bad beer at all though."
"O: Considering the geography of Sri Lanka/Ceylon this is probably the best beer ever. I you don't take the logistics in consideration, still a damn good producte."
"D - Hides its abv very well, well balanced, and extremely drinkable. I'm very surprised with this one and will have it again."
"CONCLUSION: Lion Stout looks massive but is actually a little underwhelming considering so much of its nature is masked until you hit about 55 degrees in temp. It is a good stout and certainly should be enjoyed for that. However, this is not an ""extreme"" beer in the American craft beer sense so it will be a let down if approached in that way."
"Surprisingly VERY good stout in a can from Sri Lanka. I'll be buying this over Guiness Foreign Extra from now on. It just has more going on than the typical ""chocolate, coffee, espresso, roasted"" flavors of a stout..."
"O: A mind blowing beer from a can. Like it dark and big? Then wrestle this Lion."
"You really got to hand it to the boys in Sri Lanka, for the price, they make a world class stout!"
"O: Hands down, one of the best stouts I've ever had."
"M - Medium body, moderate carbonation."
"When availible on draft and fresh, buy mass quanities."
"EDIT: After having it in the can while doing some disc golfing, I found it to be better than my previous drinking foray in the bottle. Less alcohol, more chocolate, good."
"Overall: The guy at Sydney's said if I liked Old Rasputin, I'd enjoy this stout. It definately ain't Old Raspy, but it's got an easy drinkability like OR. Bold but enjoyable. And all the way from Sri Lanka, no less. A fine sipper while watching the Mississippi River roll on by."
"Pours very dark with a substantial, two-finger brown cream head that sticks around for quite a while. Smell is pungent with a powerful alcohol smell. Almost reminds me of the smell of Name Tag beer which isn't the greatest smell in the world. Taste had some coffee and mocha flavors as the bottle suggested. Going to have to pick this up again from somewhere else than world market. Bottle had stuff floating in the bottom of it and tasted old. I have had other bottles from there that had stuff in it as well and just weren't very fresh. I'll update what I find."
"D: Don't think I'll be revisiting this one, as the medicinal herbal taste I was picking up was off-putting and really controlled the taste for me."
"O - Nice foreign stout here. Quite accessable but I kinda liked Guiness more than this one."
"One of the simpleist and best tasting Stouts I've had, ever."
"Highly recommended but leave yuor expectations at the door."
"I tasted dried fruit, smokiness, some bitter chocolate and a very amount of malt. A decent stout but not by favorite. There was a little bit of booziness at first but that faded as I drank the beer."
"Nevertheless, it augments a piece of pizza and will effectively hide any cumin flavor (if that's what you want) with its powerful smoke-screen."
"cheap but not really worth the price."
"O: Better than I had expected this to be. Wish I had more than just the one can. Worth a try!"
"Black dark brown with highlights. Molasses and caramel nose end and candied plums. The body is oily, almost tarry but still quite fluid. The bitterness is good and conveyed by a light coffee and caramel pure, it is sickening. Taste of sugar unfortunately damaging because beer does not really need and what is sufficient in mild bitterness. However, it is true that this allows the drink to be sweeter and more fit throats. The beer is extremely friendly and very easy to drink."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is slick and smooth. The body is there but is not thick or coating and is only slightly sticky. The carbonation is not fizzy and does not create a creamy mouthfeel but can definitely be noticed working behind the scenes."
"I paid $10.99 for a six pack of these at the Lotte/ Assi Plaza in Atlanta. Good of the ol' Beer Hunter Mr. Jackson to appear on this beer, as it is a magnificent brew. Worthy of the name ""Lion."" Highly recommended."
"Definitely would buy this again."
"D/O - Drinkability is pretty high. This beer really did exceed what little expectations I had from it. I know it's rated solidly, but I still had my own reservations regarding this beer. I'm happy to say that I greatly enjoyed this stout, and at less than $4.50 for a bomber, it certainly outperforms some domestic stouts at a similar and even higher price point. The only glaring flaw I can see with this beer is the amount of alcohol that comes through in the finish, but at almost 9% ABV, I can definitely see where it's coming from."
"Overall, I thought this an excellent stout, full of the lovely darker flavors that I expected, but also containing a nice sugary surprise that kept me coming back for more."
"Overall I was expecting this to be an A- beer, but it surely was not for me. This beer was way too fruity and thin bodied for my taste. Not roasty, no coffee, not a whole lot of chocolate. Not my cup of tea."
"O – Really decent stout here. It’s not top shelf but it holds it’s own. Well worth a buy and I certainly will again."
"O- Really good beer. Just light enough. Satisfies stout cravings."
"O: A delicious beer, and one I will look forward to enjoying again. Relatively low complexity but the flavors are true. First beer from Sri Lanka as far as I remember-- pleasant introduction to the country."
"D - Excellent. Deceptively drinkable for how big it is. I've had a few of these before scattered about, but now that I remember how delicious it actually is, I'm going to have to partake more often. Recommended."
"Overall-It's a pretty generic beer. It's definitely good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find this again when Old Rasputin is 7.99/4pk and easy to get."
"Poured from a can into pint glass. Pours black with a two finger breadth of mocha foam that dissipates with no lacing. Smells of coffee and chocolate with hint of alcohol. Taste is quite nice with flavor of coffee and slight sweetness. A solid stout from somewhere that I had never thought to buy beer from. Would buy again."
"Overall: This is a very good stout from an unlikely place (Sri Lanka). The coffee and chocolate tastes are perfectly balanced, the aroma is great, and the alcohol content is just right for a stout (in my opinion). I would definitely drink this again."
"VERY NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
"2015 Update: Had a very well aged bottle of this stout and it held up quite well. The coffee, yeast and caramel came through the most and the sweetness tamed the bitterness and made it pretty smooth."
"O: In spite of the sweetness, I could drink another but for the abv. I would like to try this again with desert, perhaps an almond cake."
"Mouthfeel: Probably the weak spot. It's a medium bodied brew that is very creamy and somewhat smooth. It's certainly above average but it stands out as being the weak link."
"When I got this I saw what the price tag was and I was hoping that it was going to be good. I took a 4 pack to my friends house one chilly night in 2008. The beer poured out as a dark black brew that had foamy brown colored head. The head settles a bit but still managed to leave a pretty good lacing down the glass. The smell of the beer is very roasted with a good amount of coffee on the nose. The taste has some really nice roasted flavors in there mixed with chocolate. The mouthfeel is pretty thick feeling. Overall this beer is very enjoyable to me. I am glad I've had it and I'd really like to have it again one day."
"Wow.... really good stout!!! That's all i can even say... On my list of new favorites for sure. I can't wait to have another"
"I like this stout a lot and it was pretty inexpensive for the amount of alcohol it has in it. Another nice option for a canned beer, and I am always happy to see that."
"O: This is a really nice beer that I may have continued overlooking if not for a friend's recommendation. This has everything one would look for in a stout, but there's just something a little something missing from the taste(not quite sure what) and the body is a bit of a let down. At any rate, I'm glad I picked this up and will purchase again in the future."
"O - I'd say it's a pretty solid stout. It lacks the character and intensity of heavier stouts from more well-known breweries, but it's still drinkable and is by no means off-putting."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated, slightly warming and coating. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium as well. This is a good beer but there is nothing that stands out to me, which makes it a fantastic beer; nonetheless, this is a beer that is must for many BA’s that enjoys stouts."
"MF/O: Pretty viscous but not on the extreme end. A nice one, especially given the $1.20 price tag"
"Poured with a head reluctant to emerge but then blooming to 2"" in a lovely mocha color. Dark as black coffee. Almost no smell at all, and in fact almost no taste initially too. As it warmed a little and sat and opened up a little some subtle chocolate malt flavor emerged and that was pretty good, not great but good. There's also an odd something extra, kind of like a cola or rum flavor. Anyway, nothing offensive in it, and it's easy to drink, and for a foreign import from such an unusual source I thought it was a success."
"O: Nice stout, easy going down."
"Has a distinct sour bite to it I don't care for. Don't know if it's a bad can; is that possible? I seem to like it much more out of the bottle."
"O- A very well-crafted complex stout that has an incredible soft and smooth mouthfeel."
"Slightly watery with a dry finish, a la Guinness. Medium effervescence . Nice warming alcohol bloom. Relatively rich for a weak body. Smoothish and flavorful. Quiite quaffable in a way that an Imp. stout would not be because it isn't a meal, more of a companion to one or even as a sessionable beer despite the 8% ABV. Drink it a little slower."
"O: The beer isn't that difficult to drink considering its strength and the presence of alcohol in the smell and taste. This is a good beer to sip on a cold day."
"I definitely enjoyed this one. Next time I'll have to try it canned. This is an all around great stout that should be respected. It's also very economical considering the style, quality, flavors, and high ABV. Great stout from Sri Lanka.. recommended!"
"Overall, this ages fairly well. A bit on the low end for aging, and the high end for aging this beer. Might be a little passed its prime, but still a fine beer. This may show up in a blind BIF."
"The mouthfeel is very enjoyable, it's not aggressively thick as some higher ABV stouts can be. And the drinkability is superb for a higher ABV stout. This is a strange brew for my first one from Sri Lanka! For such a tropical climate, it's a bit strange that this is their main export. I'm not complaining though, this is an excellent stout that I really enjoyed drinking."
"For my first export stout, this is fantastic."
"Overall, this is a very good stout."
"O- Above average Export Stout, pick one up if you see it."
"This beer surprised me in a good way, wasn't expecting this. Overall an exellent beer and would give two thumbs up. Give this one a try."
"Overall lacking the body I look for in a stout but the flavors, although sweet, make for a pretty solid drinker."
"Drinkability: A bit too astringent on the tongue in the after taste to want another one right away. Not really a sessionable stout."
"Drink - The beer has a somewhat low price and has a pretty good bang for your buck. It's worth checking out for sure."
"D: Very nice. A great stout, i love this stuff."
"D - Very drinkable. I could easily session this one. Creamy feel with no real presence of alcohol. I was quite surprised by this one and I'd most definitely have it again."
"Ending notes: Coming from someone who seldom likes stouts, this brew is quite tasty. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again, or get this on a regular basis. However, if I wanted a change of pace, I wouldn't hesitate to return to the Lion Stout."
"D - Easy drinking - great for a stout with such strong characteristics. ABV is up there, but workable. A good post-dinner sipping beer."
"D: Pretty good export stout. Loved the feel on this one but the heat distracts a bit."
"This is a very reasonably priced, relatively complex but, very drinkable stout. What is most surprising is that it is from Ceylon (Sri Lanka)."
" The mouth feel is smooth and for a two year old beer there is a decent amount of bubbles. It has a surprisingly dry finish for a stout with such high alcohol. The drink-ability is pretty darn good for an 8 percenter. I can barely taste any booze on this one. Its not some thing you can chug, but its quite smooth."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Maybe once upon a time, this may have been a top example for the style, but nowadays....I'd put it in the middle of the road range. A little thin and not super complex. Would be a good Stout to start out with."
"Pours very dark and clear with a brown head. No strong smells here, picked up on roasted barley a little bit. Flavor was a pleasant surprise, sweet and malty. Light carbonation in the mouth that almost seems to turn into a milky consistency. Roasty and almost chocolatey. Dangerously easy to drink for a beer of this gravity, which is well masked throughout. A fantastic beer that will not disappoint."
"Overall, a wonderful beer that I will definitely be seeking out and buying again."
"If someone can think of a negative remark in regards to this stout's quality, I'm all ears, but I certainly won't be jotting anything down. Simply outstanding."
"D - Pleasant chocolate and roasted flavors make this a really solid stout; not too much complexity here but still fairly balanced and very easy drinking (4.5)"
"Mouth feel is tingly and thick, and drinkability is not fantastic due to the abv and boozy taste, but still pretty good for the style. Bonus points for the awesome lion picture on the bottle art, very Sri Lankan of them."
"D-Insanely drinkable for 8% ABV. Very easy to drink but with an interesting complexity to it."
"D: This is a dessert beer for certain."
"This is a nice stout with a real distinctive taste that stands out. A great sipper that is good to have around during these cold winter months."
"pretty good all around but not really amazing, great value, may compare in value to old rassy. I need to do a side by side to find out, it's been so long since I've had one"
"Picked this single up for $1.69 at the local total wine. Pours pitch black with a nice looking tan head, leaving good lacing on the glass. Smell consists of a meaty smokiness, bakers chocolate and a standard, run of the mill roasted malt aroma. Taste is fairly similar to the smell, bit of alcohol comes through at first, followed by a smokey, roasty malt presence, with a bit of sweetness and some chocolate flavor towards the end of the sip. Mouthfeel is quite light and watery, unlike any stout I have tried in the past, carbonation seems a bit out of control as well. First beer I've ever had from Sri Lanka, nothing to call home about, but all in all, a pretty good beer."
"D - If you like your stouts with a little punch, then look no further."
"Found at local store wanted to try the difference between Guinness foreign extra stout, and a non-Irish foreign extra stout found that Lion was and exceptionally smooth drink with enough kick to make the stout very well in the winter. I've referred this beer to other to definitely put on there list to try"
"sweet smooth and delicious drinking."
"Overall- Very solid beer at a pretty good value. I will be drinking this again."
"Overall, I loved this beer. I recently drank Guinness Foreign Extra Stout and this was much better all across the board. I will definitely purchase this again."
"Pours black as night with a big tan-colored head, although it doesn't seem to retain for very long. Moderate lacing. Roasted, malty, typical stout smell, with some sort of distinct, slightly pungent fruit note I can't quite put my finger on - maybe dates? Mild chocolate notes and kind of an earthy character to the bouquet overall. Taste: Full-bodied, thick-ish feeling front end and a heavy-leaning mouthfeel, which all sort of smoothly vanishes over the palate in the middle, transforming into a slightly odd, pungently sweet finish. I think it's in the finish the high ABV kicks in a touch, turning it into a slightly challenging brew - but still not something you'd readily take for an 8% ABV. A sort of dry, roasty aftertaste lingers, but not bitterly so. Lion Stout used to be one of my stout go-tos before I'd tried very many kinds, and this is my first return to it in a year in which I've been trying a lot of stouts. I'm not sure it is holding up as well as I'd hoped. It's got some character and body and an ABV that packs a little bit of punch; but the flavor combination, to me, is not entirely pleasant; the weird-sweet finish in particular puts me off a little bit. B-."
"D - It's a solid beer that I did not mind, and would drink again if it were offered. Above average, decent take on the style. Drinks a little harder than 8%."
"This beer feels great in my mouth perfect bubbles that coat the tongue and clense the palate. A great Beer to pair with dessert (making my store bought vanilla cookies 10 time better!) For the style I think it is one of, if not the most drinkable example. I am very glad to be able to find this easily once again."
"D - I liked it. Came off more like a porter but it was a stout which makes it very drinkable. Beer was smooth and ABV was well concealed which I also love. Try this beer if you can!"
"12oz Bottle. Pours black with a long lasting brown head that leaves plenty of lacing. Aroma has dark fruit, chocolate malt and some brown sugar notes. Body is on a lighter side for a stout with dark fruits (prunes) and chocolate dominate the mouth. Finish is short, sweet and fruity. Hops character is very muted. Not a bad brew but I expected more from a stout."
"I did enjoy this one, but I have noticed that this site says ABV is 8.00 %, while the bottle says 8.80%."
"Noted as 8.00%. QC must have been slightly out of whack as I about to enjoy an 8.80% ABV. As a note this is packaged with the high ABV Belgians as it probably should be, with a complete box allowing in zero light, very stealthy, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a burnt malt and cocoa flavor with a black licorice accent. Pours into a chalice, which is the glass at hand, jet black, with a tan micro-bubble thin head. Taste is roasted malts at the start with a big milk stout flavor kicking in, followed by some black licorice, and then a classical sweet milk stout finish. This is a top fuel dragster brew. Slow to the start,hits the green light, then glides home. I am very impressed by a brew of this stature being such a great value."
"Im not typically a can beer drinker. I put together a random 6 pack from Total Wines. Ive seen this beer before, and finally decided to give it a try. It is your straight forward stout with a dark, creamy color, smoother taste, nice aroma, and that unmistakable stout taste. However, this beer is nothing to write home about. It is not bad, but it is not anything I'll remember 5 years from now."
"Overall: This is a very tasty and above-ordinary foreign stout. Nicely put together and definitely not over-hyped."
"Drinkable for the abv"
"Decent enough stout. Not my favorite, but you could do worse. A little lighter than most stouts, so this could be a great hotter weather stout."
"D - Not a beer that you can drink a lot of, but great to start or end your night on a good note."
"Drinkability was good."
"D. A quite tasty beer and a good performer. It is certainly a beer that will make you want to come back for more. Delicious!"
"Massive tan head--four fingers' worth--rises slowly. Rocky, dense and bubbly, it drops to a thick lace that sticks all over the glass. Very fragrant with aromas of black currants, blackberries, cocoa powder and mild roast coffee. Amazing smoothness and medium creamy body with a lush mouthfeel. Quite malty to start, with a sweetness similar to sweetened coffee. The 8 percent ABV is deceiving to begin with, but after several sips, the palate warms right up. From middle to end come waves of roasted malt with undertones of dark bitter chocolate and faint espresso bean. Minimal hop bitterness, a little fruity and yeasty toward the end. Finishes on the sweet side with a long note of roasted flavor."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a deep opaque black with a thin diminishing head that leaves just a trace of lacing on the glass. Aroma is a bit of roasted malts and slight coffee and molasses. The taste is more pronounced roasted malt body with the usual backup of coffee and bitter cocoa. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with mild carbonation. This is certainly one worth trying on-tap if you ever come across it."
"Tasty, and easy to drink. I think the bottle was a tad better, but I'd totally drink the cans any day as well."
"Drank from a pint glass. Poured rich, thick and dark; solid two finger cola-colored head with good retention and residual lacing. Smelled of chocolate, caramel, malts, dried fruit; had a very slight soapy smell to it. None of the smells were particularly strong. Taste was sweet roasted malt flavor, molasses, some coffee, dark chocolate. Felt very creamy and rich, decent carbonation, medium body. When you take all factors into consideration (a/s/t/m/d, and most importantly $) this is a pretty darn drinkable beer. One of the best value big beers I can think of."
"The export stout style, to me, always seems to land a bit short of Russian Imperial Stout, with some Baltic Porter roasted notes. This seemed to fit right into the profile, with some additional full mouthfeel, calling to mind an oatmeal stout without that level of sweetness. Deep roasted flavor, a touch of charcoal, and a nice bit of sweet malt. ETOH was evident but not offputting."
"Drinkability is good for this stout. It's a bit more subdued than I'm used to from the style, but it's by no means a bad beer. Definitely a candidate for a good night of drinking. Easy to drink, easy to enjoy."
"D: Does a pretty good job of disguising the 8.8% ABV but the slight hotness and the sweetness might hurt the drinkability."
"D - Hey, why not. This is pretty decent stuff. You would never know this was 8%. Not an amazing brew, but it's a really nice strong stout."
"This was a nice stout, a like a little more bitterness, however, I would purchase this one again."
"D- A 6-pack of this excellent stout sells for just $8.99! Not a bad deal at all."
"This is a really easy drinking stout. It's just really steadfast all-around. I picked a can as part of a mix & match six pack. Now that colder weather is upon Ohio this is in the running for ""nightcap stout"" of the season."
"D: Similar to B.O.R.I.S. in a number of ways, only not as good. Still, for the price, this is a very tasty stout."
"The label in Ontario says Signa Stout for some reason, but I'm sure it is the same beer. Pours an incredibly dark brown, almost black, colour with thick tan head. Head dissipates fairly quickly, but some lacing on the glass. Looks quite thick. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, and some dark fruit. Flavour has a lot of sweetness to it. Syupy mouthfeel, which works well for the sweetness of this stout. I can't believe this is under $2 for a bottle. If I didn't already have about 50 bottles of imperial stouts at my place, I'd buy a ton of this."
"Drinkability - a fine sipper for the autumn fireside, though a few of these can sneak up on you."
"Who knew such a great stout could come from Sri Lanka? This will definitely go into my rotation of go-to widely-available stouts; good value and a great rich, complex flavour profile. Well balanced but slightly on the sweet side which hurts its drinkability for me a bit."
"D_Very drinkable foreign export stout."
"I'm quite pleased with my experience with the Lion. A very good beer that's just a little overrated."
"Drinkability - I think I paid $3.99 for this thing and it's probably one of the best beers I've had for that price. Unfortunately, it's not available here in New Mexico...wah wah. Would definitely pick it up again though. 5.0/5.0"
"D - I enjoyed this one a lot, a very good example of the style and nice to have from a can too. I would recommend this to anyone who likes strong stouts"
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation. Not a beer that I love, but one that I do like. I would like it more, if there wasn't a somewhat burnt bitter aftertaste."
"I would drink this beer again and again, and highly recommend it."
"D: Can't say i'd go for this again. For some reason, maybe I was expecting this to be more like an ris. Just not my bag unfortunately."
"A glass of this would be fine, but more than that might be a bit much. Overall though, a unique stout. Seems to be more of a smoke baltic porter. It's a beer that I am glad I finally tried, but can't see myself getting it again in the near future."
"Overall, this is a nice stout that surprised me for being better than I expected initially, but eventually landed in the middle for me beer wise. If you see it in the store, I fully recommend picking it up, but there are far better examples of stouts out there than this beer, regardless of what the creepy man on the back of the bottle might say."
"I also have to state here a plus. This beer is relatively cheap. 7bucks for a 6 pack in AZ. This a great beer for the price"
"D - The only reason I gave this a 4 is, as with any stout, you can't drink very many! It is a great start or end beer, but don't plan on drinking this bad boy all night!"
"Drinkability: very drinkable. The alcohol contributes a lot to the nose, or at least it seems, but it's not fusely or unpleasant in any way. If they sold this around here, it would definitely be a regular in this household."
"This would probably be a great beer to age in a cellar or to keep in the back of the fridge. Like I mentioned, one or two is all you really need. It's a great beer to start a night with as it's both flavorful and high in ABV. One of the tops!"
"D: Absolutely delicious says my notes and my memory. A great balance between roasted malt and fruity esters."
"D- pleasant to drink and different from other stouts. Its inexpensive price makes it a winner."
"another one of those strong beers that you just cant sit down and drink 3 of... crap 2 of these and im ready to switch to water hahahaha but... its worth every bit of it"
"This is an excellent example of an export stout and extremely drinkable for the ABV. Surprisingly good."
"D: Over all this is a good beer. Thanks liam. The flavours could be better and texture is weak, but it's a good intro stout."
"Mouthfeel is very very good indeed. Creamy and rich, but not even close to overwhelming. Sits in the mouth for just the right amount of time, given the flavours that are there."
"This is really one of my favorite stouts and is good on any occasion. It fits in multiple seasons, it pairs well with several dishes (especially grilled red meats), and best of all: it's very reasonably priced! Check it out next time you want a 6-pack of stout for your Thanksgiving holiday."
"The drinkability is moderate to high. The flavor profile is pleasing enough making for an easy sipper. The ABV is pushing the high end, but it's well incorporated. Overall it's a decent beer."
"Beer is medium to thin in body, slightly sweet and finishes nicely with some roasty bitterness. There is some ash like flavors to this beer overall that are less than pleasant but fortunately for it they are minimal. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is also good. Its a decent, kind of sweet, stout."
"Quite nice on the whole, and at $1.95 a bottle, the drinkability is through the roof at this ABV! This may just be a new go-to stout..."
"Overall, a by-the-book stout. Doesn't scream at you, but handles what it's supposed to well."
"I would highly recommend this to any fan of stouts!"
"Final Words: If you like stout, Taste Lion Stout."
"Overall this is a fine stout with an exceptional aroma. It's one for roasted malt fans."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I liked it. Going to try some more. I enjoyed it thoroughly.Pretty good stout for a foreign one"
"The beer has an underlying meat or fish flavor, with strong caramel notes. I first tried this beer in Japan and like many of the beers I had on the trip it had an quirks that I have only experienced in Asian beers. Overall one of the more interesting beers I have had."
"This is a great stout and, for me, it fits the Foreign/Export style quite well. Lion Stout pours wall to wall black with a creamy beige head. The aroma is cacao nibs, cocoa, coffee and a sharp fruitiness - apricots, strawberries, grapes - that differentiates it from most imperial stouts. The fruit notes come through in the flavor with a refreshing acidity. The beer starts sweet with cocoa and coffee and finishes with acidity and smoke. It's quite easy to drink. The creamy mouthfeel helps, as well. This beer has a lot of roasted malt character and manages also to be refreshing. Great stuff."
"It's not sweet, but it's not dry either. Very well balanced beer, especially for the amount of malts that must have been used."
"Drinkability: Great drinkability with its abundant intense flavors that collaborate into an enjoyable beer."
"Notes - Thin to medium mouthfeel but a good level of carbonation. I kind of wish it had a little thicker mouthfeel."
"D - I could drink this all night."
"I poured into a pint glass to three fingers of light brown head. I would say that it is black except for the tinge of dark brown around the edges. The aroma is sweet chocolate and dark fruit (plum). The taste mirrors the smell up front, but the roasted malts come more into play. There is just a slight bitterness that offsets the sweetness. It is not a great stout but it is good and worth a try."
"D - A delicious choice for those who like a stout with a big, smoky character. Would also be a good find for devotees of rauchbier. Very enjoyable as a wintertime warmer, or a nightcap."
"Tasted from a can. Pours nearly black with a very thick and frothy light brown head. Nose is coffee, dark chocolate, very roasted malts, and light hops. On the palate, the flavor is fruitier, displaying prune, the chocolate is more of a milk chocolate than dark chocolate. The malts taste a little more like caramel than expected, and the hops add a nice dimension as well. On the palate, this beer is actually lighter than expected, due in large part to the heavy carbonation. The finish is not terribly long. Overall, this is a very drinkable stout."
"drinkability is high considering the alcohol content. i see this beer all the time and can't believe i waited this long to try it. pretty damn good, and on the cheap side for an import. i'll definitely be buying this again."
"First, this lion came roaring out of its CAN! It looked like oil from the current slick in the Gulf of Mexico, courtesy of BP. The head was outrageous, demanding my immediate attention lest its deep-brown rise above the lip of the glass and spill onto my computer. Two fingers that eventually tamed themselves and sat atop the beer like a real lion on a stool. F**ing rampant animals! I despise that! This cat had a real bite on the nose. Deeply roasty with a bit of dark chocolate sweetness, if that passes for sweet for you. Color was ebony black with the light penetration of a black hole. NONE! Zee-roh! Mouthfeel was somewhat thin for a stout, but the taste was dark chocolate, raisins, prunes, my morning coffee (I am a retired US Navy sailor), and smoke. This tasted like the aftermath of a house fire smells. Wow! The finish was dry, smoky, worth seeking out. Good kitty!"
"Mouthfeel is medium with a slightly rough amount of carbonation."
"D - good, solid. a bit too sweet for my liking but other people might love it. lovely body, alcohol is noticeable but adds another layer to this."
"D: 8% ABV is kinda rough. I've got will power of steel so I could drink a few but i'd rather stop after one."
"D - goes down easy enough to have another, pace yourself."
"I don't think of Sri Lanka when I think of a stout but this is a respectable attempt, nothing worth bragging about but no reason to be ashamed either"
"The body was pretty wet and slick. I expected more here. Too watery. The taste was not doing it for me. Some sourness present reminded me of some milk stouts. Other flavors noted were grape, and faint chocolate notes. Nothing standout here. I couldn't even finish this one. Something about it just wasn't pleasant. I'll pass on this one."
"D= Pretty good. After the initial shock of the raisin date juice it is pretty solid. I would but this again sometime just because it's so unique and I've yet to have a beer like it. Who knows I may have a hankerin"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it was a pretty smooth drinking stout but wasn't one I'd probably buy again. It had some nice chocolaty flavors to it but it just didn't really wow me."
"j."
"Overall: A very enjoyable stout in my opinion. I imagine the first stout that the people in Sri Lanka ever tasted was Guinness. I find it interesting then that this beer tastes a bit like Guinness Extra Stout. This beer is nicely complex in flavor (probably due to the extra alcohol) and lighter than usual. I enjoyed a glass after a 5 mile run."
"Quite creamy body, the carbonation is a little high."
"D - A very good stout, and it certainly is unique compared to other stouts I have partaken in. A little higher ABV, but that is a characteristic of foreign stouts. This is certainly a delicious offering from Lion brewery...one I would certainly recommend."
"Poured from a 11.2 bottle with no freshness date. Poured extremely dark with a copious amount of tan head. Sticky foamy lacing on the side of the glass. Strong malty scent. Heavy malts and cocoa flavors. Pretty smooth mouth feel. Not really drinkable enough to go for another. A lot of other stouts out there with more flavor. Paired pretty decent with some fresh blackberries and blueberrys and yogurt."
"If I am ever in Sri Lanka or nearby I know what to drink. The can is really good looking, with a proud lion and simple black, red, white only scheme. Try this stout if you run across it."
"D: The 22 oz. bottle I drank it from was enough for me, after finishing to bottle was full and had little desire to drink the other beer I had bought for the night."
"The wine like and slightly sour aroma and taste was not what I was expecting and really not my favorite. Interesting stout to say the least and something I may try again if I could find it on tap..."
"J"
"beer."
"D: While this beer does not blow me away in any given category, it goes down smooth, and can easily be followed by more. Yes!"
"Cheers."
"A pretty good strong stout, the alcohol barely noticeable, and decently drinkable."
"D: The ABV is hidden incredibly well and it's a good effort. It's pretty well balanced, not exciting though. It's an economic purchase though."
"Pours a lovely brown-black, with a healthy layer of tan frothy head. The smell holds fragments of chocolate, molasses, prunes, figs, and espresso. The taste starts off with a chocolatey maltiness, but then progesses into those figs, plums, and currants, finishing with a tinge of light coffe and brown sugar at the back of the tongue. The body is more medium than heavy, runs very smoothly, and finishes nice and lightly, making for a highly tasty and drinkable stout."
"Very good overall, but I like Fade to Black a little better. If you prefer milk stouts, then you will like Lion Stout a lot, an amped up version of the style."
"D: I was excited to see a bottle of this at Hollingshead's; I've always wanted to try it, I'm a big fan of the style, yet there are so few examples around town. The price is real good, I think it was $3.99, and you get a delicious stout perfect for a hot summer day, a beer that can be drunk in droves, so be careful out there."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head, considerable lacing. Smells great, chocolate, malts, coffee, slight alcohol. Taste is good chocolate, malts, finishing a tad bitter. Feels creamy in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fine brew."
"As for the taste, there's rich deep fruit and chocolate/coffee flavors, tempered by the stout sourness typical of this style. It finishes with a bitter chocolate taste that has a moderate duration."
"D - This stout is absolutely fantastic. I've been meaning to get pack of it and next time I'm at a store that carries it, I surely will. I could have it all night!"
"Drinkability: I really liked this one. It is so nice and light and for the abv, the alcohol is not overly noticable. Very enjoyable, glad I went with the six on this instead of the single."
"D - I went in to this beer expecting sub par results just from my experience with other beers from that part of the world and must say that the can't judge a book by its cover applies here it even has a MJ quote on the back cover worth a try"
"D - Surprisingly good. This beer is a perfect example of why we must try more beers and keep an open mind. Out of all the beers I've had from South or South-East Asia this is easily the winner."
"So cool to see this in a can, no worries about skunking or oxy problems. Seemed fresh, or perhaps even aged and mellowed."
"Buy Again? Possibly."
"Pours a deep, opaque sable with a fine-bubbled and fairly persistent tan head. Aroma is smoky with firm tones of coffee and unsweetened chocolate with more than a hint of burnt caramel. Rich, smoky flavor is mainly of fine roast coffee, unsweet chocolate and caramel, subtly sweet. Texture is fairly smooth yet quite fizzy. A must for stout fans!"
"D - Once the carbonation subsides this is a very smooth stout that is dangerously drinkable for its alcohol content."
"Absolutely delicious, a real treat. Hides the abv well. The only gripe is it disappears too fast."
"Overall, an excellent beer that I had previously stayed away from. Learned my lesson."
"D: Very nice. I've eyed this for a long time and finally decided to take the plunge. I'm glad I did!"
"D – Tremendous quality from a mass-produced beer."
"Poured from a 12oz can into a goose island matilda goblet. In the air the pour stream is a very dark brown but once in the glass becomes enough to be opaque / black. The head is a light brown and very tall so the carbonation must be somewhat high. Head reduced to a lumpy foam then dissipated completely in a short time. Smell is light, not too rich or outstanding. Taste is somewhat light and sweet and not really anything amazing as far as I'm concerned. Not a bad beer but not really what I would look for in a stout. To each their own I suppose. Drinkability is high as the abv is not too high and the mouthfeel is smooth and easy. The beer rolls across the tongue lightly with the bubbles biting just a little bit. Overall drinkable, but not my cup of tea (or beer). Was worth the try."
"Pours black and looks like carbonated coffee with a tan head. Aroma is of caramel, coffee, alcohol, and a bit of nuts. There is a light malty aroma too. Alcohol is very prevalent in the brew. It overshadows a lot of the other flavors. There is a slight chocolate coffee flavor but the alcohol masks it."
"salud!"
"All in all, a really enjoyable, unexpected treat. I will definitely order it again next time I'm there."
"This beer surprised me. I wasn't expecting an Asian stout to be this pleasant to drink. It wasn't as dry as an Irish stout, but not as strong as a lot of American Stouts. I found myself really enjoying drinking this beer."
"D: The carbonation and dry finish help balance the full flavors, resulting in nice drinkability (though it is higher ABV at 8%)."
"D = For a strong stout of this type it has exceptional drinkability though it remains a one and done type of beer."
"This is one of my top 3 beers to drink at any point. This will be a staple in my fridge for the forseeable future."
"Overall a very flavorful beverage and I would surely try again. Both the style in general as well as this offering in particular."
"the taste is super light as well that is a sweet hoppiness that feels like water making it ok to drink but overall nothing very special or exciting. Damn you Sri Lanka."
"D - A good drinking beer for the stout lover when you're in a non-sipping mood. Also serves as a good intro to the stout genre."
"D- you can drink more than one because its so good but remember the 8 % ABV , this beauty can get you in trouble!"
"mouthfeel is good and what I expected and drinkability is average with that sweetness and abv of 8%"
"Pours an extremely dark brown color body, huge head, light tan, very lasting, creamy. Roasty aroma, some espresso, maybe chocolate. Very good smelling. Creamy mouthfeel, coffee and chocolate flavors. Slight ashiness. A little boozy. Less hot as it warms up. Very good tasting."
"Thick carbonated mouthfeel, and highly drinkable especially for the high alcohol. Considering the price($2 a bottle) this is one of the best stouts money can buy!"
"this is a nice stout. would love to get a belly full on tap somehow. worthy of the respect...but not hype worthy. it stands on it's own merits."
"Well worth a pickup; you wont be disappointed with this stout!"
"Drinkability: A very good stout overall and the sweetest I've tried thus far. Very drinkably for 8% ABV and well worth a taste."
"F: Finishes semi bitter, slightly tangy and spicy as well. Pretty dry too, and leaves a chocolate powder flavor in the mouth, like chewing on cocoa powder. There's also some lingering fruit flavors and the stout like bitterness sticking around. It does hide the 8% abv well though."
"Drink: Could drink a few of these, and have, and enjoy each time. This is a very nice offering."
"Notes: tasty stout with rich flavors lacking the usual coffee flavors. great tropical export stout."
"D- Really good beer. I can definitely have another."
"D - Damn, very drinkable perfect. Rated as best of style by BJCP for a reason. Great example of a foreign stout."
"Drinkability: A very good stout, definitely one of my favorites. I picked this up on a whim (I had never heard of beers from Sri Lanka) and I'm glad I did."
"It is surprisingly light bodied for a beer that is this dark and sweet- I was expecting a residual sweetness. The relatively simple, but good, flavor makes this a fairly drinkable brew."
"Other than a hint of ruby around the edges, almost no light passes through the brown-black body. It's topped by a thick pile of fairly well-retained fine mocha foam. Some lacing. There's a very deep fruit aroma, like prunes and berries. Roasted notes give the impression of chocolate. Molasses. Alcohol is present in the nose, giving the scent a boozy character. It tastes of semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, plums, and a hint of black coffee. While there is some roasted bitterness lasting well into the finish, this stout leans toward sweet. Alcohol noticeable, but less prominent than in the nose. Balanced. Medium-full bodied with fairly smooth carbonation. Very easy drinking for such a strong beer. A nice beer to relax with after supper on a fall or winter evening."
"This is a pretty easy drinking stout. There's nothing crazy about it, the alcohol is blended well and the taste is pretty simple and straightforward."
"Pretty big and tasty, also very complex. Pretty drinkable for a stout."
"Drinkability:This thing was a pretty tasty treat. Have seen it around for a while now and finally decided to give it a shot. I could probably enjoy 2-3 of these some night. A very reasonably priced treat, I'll definitely pick up some more of this down the road."
"D: This is a pretty good stout. Lots of good flavors. As I noted above, I feel it suffers just a little on the mouthfeel. I would have this again, but probably not more than one at a time. It's also a pretty cheap, high abv beer."
"Obtained in 6 pack can form from a wasteful cardboard box carrier. Poured out of the tin it looks very pleasing to the eye of a stout fancier. The body is nearly raisin coloured with a delightful looking tan froth rimming the glass and clinging fast. Nary a bubble to speak of. The smell is smooth and rich with roasted aromas and mellow sweet darkness. The taste rolls in on a fluffy mouthfeel and is at once sweet and dry. Flavours are mild and smooth yet very pronounced. Delicious and quite easy on the drinkability tip."
"D: A fantastic stout with numerous aromas and flavors that form a cohesive whole that is a fine brew and a fabulous value for the contents."
"This one looks like a damn fine stout--pitch black with big creamy tan head that sticks around for a while. Smell is primarily sweet with substantial coffee notes. One dimensional, but pleasant. Taste is good, with coffee, roasted malt, and maybe a bit of hops poking through. Dark chocolate is in there too. A hint of phenol and some alcohol as well. Smooth drinking stout, but not extremely robust. A good session beer for sure, and a tremendous value at $3.29 a bomber."
"Poured a dark brown with a two finger head that remained for most of the beer. The aroma was a mild coffee. The taste was sweet chocolate and some coffee. The feel was full bodied with decent carbonation. Drinkability was pretty good for an 8.00 ABV. I have read a lot of hype about Lion stout being the best stout out there, so I have to give it a try. It was damned good. Not the best stout, maybe, but an excellent value. I'll definitely be back."
"Overall, a great offering. I can imagine this goes well with spicy asian food."
"D: This beer is quite drinkable. The flavors are not too overpowering and they blend well together."
"Mouth is viscous and thick but doesn't effect the drinkability. really a well rounded beer and an utter surprise to me."
"Pours a dark black color with light barely coming through on the edges. Thick foamy tan head. Nice nose of roasted grains and a little smoke. There is a ""fig-like"" sweetness in the nose as well. There is definitely a silkiness to the nose as well. Robust flavor and a little bit boozy. Some smoke and some hops. I believe I am picking a flavor that is either a spruce or perhaps a spicy peet. Lots of subtle flavors that are tough to separate. Nice structure and body to this beer. The mouthfeel is nice. The finish is nice. Solid beer. I will likely buy this again to share with company."
"An interesting interpretation of the style, but one that I can probably do without in the future. Good: subtle roastiness, Belgian-like dark fruit, dark chocolate. Bad: chemically plastic bag aromas, sharp pungency, biting mouthfeel."
"Very easy to drink but more of a sipper than something you would be able to drink alot of in a sitting, maybe 2 but thats about all I could see myself doing."
"D-- This is from Sri Lanka?? Serious? It's 8 %?? Seems a bit watered down for an 8%. Very drinkable. The licorice I would do with out but a very nice beer. This is a stout you can drink in all seasons."
"Nice price. Will definitely try again."
"I'm definitely enjoying this, and will grab another and try this again soon."
"From a bomber type bottle, this dark elixir poured a molasses brown and formed a nice foam head of two inches. Roasted biscuit and malts frame a medium body brew, with coffee, molasses accents and a nutty finish. Good, I would drink this again. A small step up from dry, smooth and un-flavored stouts."
"12-ish oz bottle to glass. Good stout, has classic roasted flavors, not as heavy mouthfeel as I expected. Fairly easy to drink. Wouldn't guess this is 8% alcohol, very balanced. Left a little sludge in my glass, guess I should drink faster next time. Would buy again."
"Drink is very high I had to take a second look at the ABV. Could easily get in trouble drinking these. Too darn smooth and drinkable for the ABV."
"I really enjoyed this beer and I wish I bought more than one can. This could be a great go-to beer this fall and winter. A good brew when the weather cools down when I want something that's very easy drinking and warming."
"Over all not my kind of beer. This won't stop me from trying others in this class. I recommend this beer even though not my style. Someone with a more seasoned palate will appreciate this more than me."
"Pretty decent beer and the price isn't bad either. I've had their lager and didn't care for it. This is clearly the flagship for this brewery."
"Chalk one up for Sri Lanka (#34 country on my personal list)...well done!"
"Very, very drinkable overall. Possibly the most drinkable Asian beer I've ever had, in spite of being dark, and 8%."
"A pretty pleasant stout. It certainly has a good handle on the roasted bitterness. I wish it had upped the sweetness and the body a bit, and lengthened the palate. But not bad overall."
"d: This wasn't ""big"" tasting, not all that complex either. Just well made and dangerously drinkable."
"the fruity nougat character and medicinal off-balancing actually gets a tad distracting. this beer is ok, but i think jackson's hyping of it gives more credit than is really due."
"Poured a pitch black body with an intense roasted and chocolate malt smell along with a good chunk of coffee malt. Thicker, sticky full body that is both smooth and creamy while having a strong roasted/coffee malt presence so it goes down dry with a dry finish. Some sweetness from chocolate in there as well and hints of fruits (like chocolate covered cherries). ABV mostly hidden but does kick up the dry taste a little...just a great sipper that I can have anytime."
"A great brew here. Heavy coffee structure and and dry a finish allows you to get loose in your enjoyment of this one. Watch out because it does catch up"
"Drinkability: This is 8% so watch out. Would be easy to accidentally pound this. Delicious and very drinkable. Nice surprise from a foreign stout. Best beer ever from Sri Lanka-- although its the only one I've had."
"Quite an enjoyable stout. I like the balance of sweetness and roastiness."
"Very good drinkability. Nice stout, wow, this was a pleasant surprise. Tasty, but not to heavy, good stuff."
"Saw a can of this on the singles shelf so I figured I'd check it out. I thought it was an imperial stout due to the ABV, but it definitely doesn't have as much flavor as most imperials. It is very drinkable, quite light for a 8% beer. Worth a try."
"Black color with a billowing 2 finger head that camps out for a few minutes before settling to a ring. Smell is roasted malts and dark fruit. Taste is ashtray, raisins, wood, lots of hops, and coffee grounds. Would be pretty damn solid but the ash holds it back just a bit. Medium bodied, normal for the style. This beer packs a lot of flavor but it is not a good enough flavor to justify drinking at 8%. If this were 6% I would probably rate it higher since then it would be sessionable, but at this high of ABV I would rather have something else."
"Overall: This beer was much better than I expected. I enjoyed it a lot. I would have it again."
"Big brown head rises up from the pour. Decent head retention. The body of the beer is, of course, black. Smell is loaded with coffee and chocolate. The taste has the coffee and chocolatey elements of the smell. Dry finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking, but a thinner body icreases the drinkability."
"D= This was a very interesting and delicious beer. The ABV is really well hidden and is not a factor at all. If you are into sweet stouts, this is very sessionable in my opinion."
"D - Great beer overall. A soild stout that lives up to the style. Could drink a couple in a row, but the roasty presence and warming alcohol as it warms keeps it as a nice sipper. Though the smoothness may lead you elsewhere...."
"Decently drinkable, with it wetting to the palate. A bit too sweet for my taste, and could use a little smokier profile."
"The excessive sweetness may hold this one back, but so what. This is a treat to be savored. I imagine ice cream would quickly fall in love with this lion."
"This beer pours a nice dark brown with a one finger soapy/sudsy dark tan head with phenomenal retention. Thick, solid, sheets of lacing coat the glass the entire way down. Nose is of fruitiness at the beginning - some raisin and date notes, bitter chocolate, a touch of vanilla, and very mild hint of alcohol. Taste is much inline with the nose - starts of with some molasses and caramel malts at first and then moves to a bitter chocolate and coffee flavoring and just a touch of smokey flavoring, the end finishes with some fruitiness most detectable is the mild raisin flavoring. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation with a bone dry finish to it. Mouthfeel is very nice...lively but not abrasive, with a medium body and lightly dry finish. This is a really well balanced beer, one that with a lower ABV would be worthy of sitting with for a night."
"D- Would drink another, but if there was other options... I would try something else"
"D - This is a very sweet beer with intense, fruity caramel character that does not lend itself to great drinkability. It is nonetheless an interesting beer and a good example of a relatively rare style."
"But, it's a good stout. Drinkable, pleasant. Creamy mouthfeel."
"D - Quite a good stout overall. Has a nice combination of flavors and doesn't way you down too much with extreme heaviness. I could definitely see myself trying this one again."
"D: A world standard among stouts. It'd definitely find a place in my regular rotation if I could acquire it more easily."
"nice thick, deep rich head. black as night color. smells of roasted coffee. tastes of barley and roasted coffee. smooth, sweet, and tasty finish. not dry like an Irish Stout. the alcohol taste is fairly strong. since it is such a rich beer, I would have a difficult time drinking more than a few of these at a time."
"Also interesting to note for those homebrewers out there who may be reusing these bottles: watch out, they are really slippery for some reason. I know it sounds odd, but just try it... take a bottle and start rinsing it out in the sink... it almost has that feeling like when you are trying to wash bleach off of something."
" makes having a few nice and easy."
"D- Great stout from Sri Lanka, almost perfect!"
"Notes of chocolate and coffee in both the nose and the palate. Deep ruby in color with a tan lacing in my glass. Hints of toffee and vanilla as well. Michael Jackson called it his favorite stout so who am I to say anything else. 8% abv, full of flavor, a do NOT miss beer."
"Overall: Nicely balanced. Good dark stout to drink on a cold night."
"drinkability is good - this reminded me of a RIS light"
"Drinkability: Very easy sipper; almost too easy considering the 8%."
"D: Lion Stout is a constant mixture of sweet and bitter. The different flavors hit your taste buds and then overtake your entire mouth, cheeks and jowls. This was a very good beer and makes me very eager to find more export stouts."
"Overall - This just didn't quite stand up to my favourite stouts. Perhaps Arjuna Ranatunga peed in it."
"Perhaps worth a try, but I would not purchase again."
"Overall, give this beer a try, most stout and porter drinkers should enjoy this."
"This is a very sweet stout. Very different from the dry stouts I'm used to (guiness extra stout... etc.). Strong chocolate, light coffee, and roasty malt taste. Mouthfeel is thick and grainy, like a meal in a glass. I like to swish the last bit in the bottom to get the residue out of the bottle. Really fun to drink. What a surprise from Sri Lanka! Similar but better to other cream stouts I've had."
"Search this one out, its a nice tasty treat."
"Creamy mouthfeel and finishes a touch dry. This is perhaps the most drinkable 8% beer I have had. I would have guessed around 5% abv. No alcohol in flavor, aroma or tastes. Quite drinkable and enjoyable, but far from great."
"Pours black with brown tins and a dark brown head. The smell is sweet with smoky flavor, and heavy malt tones. The taste starts malty and smoky and finishes sweet. The ABV is hard to detect. The finish is malty with a hint of the smoky flavor. The mouthfeel is great, milky smooth, not super heavy-just a medium mouthfeel, great flavor balance, and a perfect carbonation for a stout. The drinkability is nice, the flavor can keep you coming back. This one is definitely worth checking out."
"I just bought a six pack from a high end liquor store for 9.99. Imagine, swill sells for about 2 dollars less. This will be on frequent rotation in my fridge. A great find!!!!"
"D- really good no booze to it at all kind of a hot day stout i feel"
"It's light bodied and it may not be the most complex stout ever made, but that could well work in its favor as it's really quite enjoyable."
"D: A really nice Stout. A moderate ABV makes this beer enjoyable."
"D-Pretty good. The first of many stronger and fuller stouts that I had ever tried, I am happy to find that I still thoroughly enjoy this brew."
"Final Thoughts - I have always wanted to try this stout and finally got to with the single bottle. Decent to purchase a single bottle every now and then however a six pack at the current price limits this one a bit for me."
"D- Not a bad brew, just nothing overly complex."
"Body is lighter (medium) than expected for a stout, but it's very very smooth. Really soft creamy feel. The 8% never really makes itself known. This is one of the more drinkable stouts I've tasted."
"Overall this is a very solid stout, comparable to a strong Milk Stout. Worth a shot."
"Overall -- eh. Glad I tried it, not really blowing me away. It was a sipper for sure, but I'm glad I didn't have 5 more in the fridge. Just worth checking out, but one and done for me."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, but the carbonation is a little too much. Solid stout."
"This beer looks and smells better than it tastes. But I felt that I would have enjoyed it more if I had a smokey aged cheese and artisan bread to go with it. It needs an edible companion."
"D - This is a pretty fantastic stout. I am glad this recently came to Missouri because I am going to be buying this frequently."
"I was a bit surprised actually about this one, I didn't have high expectations but it was rather good! It will propably find it's way to my home again =)"
"D - Hides alcohol very well; easy drinking. I wish it were a little more interesting, though."
"Overall if I'm at a store and see a sixer of this next to a four pack of Great Lakes Blackout for the same price, I'm going to the GL every time. Just no reason to revisit this beer, though I can't find anything to say outwardly negative. Just nothing special."
"Drinkability: Well, being 8%, I'm not sure how many I could drink in a row, but the alcohol is delivered very smoothly and not overpowering."
"Taste is superb. Chocolate, silky smooth, good balance of sweet and bitter. Great fucking stout with a nice thick and creamy mouth feel."
"* After typing this I see that I have made an all-to-common mistake. Stouts and and other dark beers are easier to brew than lighter, crisper styles. Despite the fact that most countries in the world brew at least one pale lager, it is actually one of the hardest styles to get right. Still, good to see a generally non-brewing nation making a stout."
"Loved this beer! Went to Independent, a local classy bar in downtown St Petersburg for St. Patty's Day to celebrate. Came across this magnificent find. I prefer drinking from the bottle but Lion Stout is best suited for a glass. It had slight head, maybe an inch at most, thick and frothy so I didn't mind it. Chocolate/coffee aromas. dark not in any way translucent. Flavors of natural bittersweet chocolate, smooth texture, not too filling, settles well so I could probably drink a few. Coffee aftertaste without leaving residue behind. An extremely quality beer. Highly recommended."
"First off, this is an outstanding stout! Pours a rich black color with a nice two finger head with lacing all the way down the glass. Rich, creamy mouthfeel. Smells and tastes smokey, very different taste than most stouts, although, it does include the coffee, chocolate and toffee like flavors. I was stunned upon trying this, as to it's origin, but this is one of the best out there."
"Taste is chocolatey, with toasted nuts, a nice roasted bitterness, caramel, hops noticeable towards the finish as well as a slight fruitiness. The 8% is very well hidden. A damn fine stout in my book."
"D'ability - A bit heavy for an every day beer, but quite drinkable by 8% ABV standards. Alcohol is well controlled."
"Overall: Good mouthfeel, low carbonated but thick and silky. Very drinkable overall, great flavor and no alcohol coming through. Very good stout."
"This is a really drinkable stout. The lighter body eases its way down with reckless abandon but still leaves you savoring how tasty it is, especially for an export stout. I usually like more body to my stouts but for certain occasions something lighter might strike my fancy. A really drinkable stout that I would certainly try again. Thanks Rob!"
"Drinkability: Perfect. Lighter body allows you to enjoy this one for a looong time. Excellent complexity and flavor progression. Zach and I will definitely buy this again."
"Overall, I'm glad I tried this one, but I don't think I'll be buying it again, even on sale."
"Overall: I had heard a lot of good things about this beer and seeing Michael Jackson's face on the back of the bottle is pretty reassuring but I still had my doubts for some reason. Well, those were all wiped away as soon as I took my first sip of this delicious brew. If you think you only like American stouts try this. It has all the deliciousness you'd expect from any hop forward American stout. Will definitely be getting this again very soon."
"Very drinkable, almost dangerously so. Good beer, not an excellent example of any specific style. The lower price helps make this a great session beer."
"A three finger milk chocolate brown head is very creamy and has nice resilience. Leaves a nice crown of lace as it fades. Body is pure ink black. Nose has tones of old dusty minerals, coco, and soft smokey meat. Enters the mouth with layers. The first wave is smokey minerals than comes some creamy sweet coco. The flavors all come with a general rustic feel to them. A very meaty stout overall. At 8% the alchol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is of a rusty sweetness. Very easy to drink. I would put this somewhere between a smoked and a cream stout."
"Overall this is probably my least favorite stout to date. I don't plan on buying or drinking another one of these."
"Although, as I said, very good beer, and worth the while."
"D: I sampled this beer at a beer festival a few months ago and didn't like it. This bottle, OTOH, when properly served is solidly above-average in all respects. Goes down easily, and quite inexpensive to boot. Still nothing special though."
"Highly drinkable, very good beer. Alcohol is hidden well. Cheap great stout, highly recommend"
"Pours a dark black color. 2/3 inch head of a light tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, and some slight hop aroma is noticeable. Fits the style of a Foreign / Export Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt up front, with some earthy grass undertones, hop bitterness throughout, and a sweet chocolate finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. I was a little wary of this beer after not enjoying the Lion Lager, but this is a vast improvement - worth a try."
"I've seen stouts with higher ABV having the alcohol feel much more hidden. I'd get tired of the taste after a few of these."
"Drinkability: If you can get past the sweetness it is easy to drink a couple, but it's a definite sipper. Not a bad beer, but if I have the choice there are plenty of other stouts I'd rather get. However, this was the only one available for me at the bar I was at, and it satisfied my craving. Good, but that artificial sweetness just bothered me."
"D: I didn't find this Stout remarkably drinkable. Beware, the alcohol in this brew creeps up out of nowhere."
"Overall, I think it's a solid stout. I probably won't purchase it very often unless I'm trying to get something I haven't had in a while. Love the fact that it's from Sri Lanka, though."
"D- A wholesome brew that is easy to drink and not too overpowering. A good choice for any lover of stouts."
"Overall Impression: It is very easy to drink; when the bottle was gone I was wishing I purchased a second bottle. The flavors are strongest in the after taste, as they should be in a beer you wish to remember."
"Id buy this again, just not every day."
"Drinkability: This is a very good beer, but as already noted, not extraordinary. It looks and smells really good - the smell actually outweighs the taste, which is a bit of a disappointment. Somehow, it feels smaller than it actually is - the alcohol hides really well - but I don't know whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. However, irrespective of this, it's highly recommended and I would definitely try it again if it was offered to me, but I wouldn't make any huge efforts trying to get a hold of it."
"D: Drinks very well for 8%. I can hardly detect the alcohol at all. A very tasty stout. I'll be searching this out again."
"A very dark brown to black color pour with two fingers of foamy coco head.Aroma of Semisweet chocolate and burnt malt grain. Flavor is slightly sweeter than the aroma would have you believe,sweet and bitter chocolate,coffee beans,and maybe a hint of earthy vanilla, a nice hint at the alcohol in the very end,nice little bitter aftertaste, velvety mouthfeel,smooth carbonation.Very good, I would love to drink a couiple of these."
"Pours a clear but very dark brownish mahogany with a brown head that hurriedly settles. Smell is good but not extraordinary: milk chocolate, scorched brush, and notes of oatmeal. Very finely carbonated medium-full body transmits strong flavors of dark Godiva, expresso, and a light smokiness and ashy bitterness. Body weight could use a little more heft. All in all, a nice beer; I'm glad to have tried it."
"Drinkability: Wow, a great and flavorful, yet easy drinking stout. Certainly would not have guessed the ABV on this. And at $3.49 for a bomber, it is hard to argue with the price."
"This is a plenty nice beer. I've had it twice before, and this was my first time really carefully thinking about it. I liked it enough to come back. I'll be back again."
"I would love to hear some history of how these island countries came to brew and drink this beer. It comes across as their version of malt liquor!"
"A strong beer alcohol wise, but a very good one nonetheless. The beer poured out a very dark, basically black color. The smell was of roasted coffee and the taste had hints of chocolate, coffee. Lastly an alcohol taste comes at the finish. Not a beer to drink with heavy foods but definitely something to try and a good example of an imperial stout."
"Not bad. I'd recommend it for the price, but I wouldn't seek it out. A little sweet for my tastes., I'd like some more roastiness and hop presence. I much prefer American Imperial Stouts, like Victory Storm King for example; although I realize this is a different brew in many ways. I would bet most would like more than me though..."
"This oddity was a Foreign Stout I picked up in Maine. What makes it odd? It's brewed in Sri Lanka! Out of the bottle it was an opaque brown that was a shade or two away from black. The head was huge, three fingers of mocha colored foam that retained excellently and left good lacing. The aroma was very roasted with some cocoa and herbal hops notes. The flavors were a curios experience. At first I got the sweet and creamy malt with lots of chocolate. Then I began to taste hints of tobacco and the resiny and herbal hops. As it warmed the flavors became more nutty with hints of coffee in there too. The mouthfeel was good, the body med/full and the carbonation good with a slightly acidic feeling to it overall. An enjoyable beer and the best Foreign Stout I've had to date."
"Overall, very impressive and frankly surprising. I never expected this mass-produced export stout to be this good. This is one beer that I have seen for years but never gave a second glance. Now I think I'll be coming back regularly."
"From the first sip I was hooked. The mouthfeel is better than it is rated here, it starts out a bit loose but then really tightens up. Drinks much smaller than it actually is, which is to say the ABV is well hidden. Could easily put away a few of these without realizing."
"Excellent beer! Poured with a dark tan head and some lace. Opaque brown color. Aroma is roasty, malty, a bit sweet and hint of fruit. Flavor's got lots more going on. Kind of reminds me of a cross between a baltic porter and a sweet stout. Has all the aroma characteristics plus much sweeter yet balanced with a bitterness, dark fruit, madiera, and even - cream. Mouth is fine carbonation and creamy, but with a lingering bitter sweetness. A little boozy. A session beer that'd get ya snockered. Impressive brew. Tamil tigers oughta get a few cases and take a break, Ok, cook with it then. sheesh."
"OVERALL: A pretty good export stout. Drinkable but not memorable. I could have a few of these and it's definately worth re-visiting, but there are certainly better examples out there."
"Notes: It wasn't that expensive. It was about $34 or $35 dollars and with tax around $37 or $38. its worth the price. So buy it and do yourself a favor...This Shit is top notch mother fucker, buy this shit and you wont be disappointed. Fuck Yeah!!!"
"D: Very drinkable stout. I recommend it."
"Good cocoa on the finish. Not too sweet. Just right."
"D: I could drink several of these. The alcohol is well disguised behind the mild sweetness and nutty flavors. This is a well balanced stout and is a great ""value"" purchase at $10 for 6. The aftertaste is my only real problem with this offering. Overall, very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but slightly watery."
"Even with the strong taste and high ABV this is a pretty drinkable brew."
"I sure hope I just got a bad one because this was arguably the worst beer I've had in years. Color was excellent, smell in the bottle was okay but all downhill after that. In the glass it smelled like sewer water and didn't taste any better. It was bought and stored the same as a dozen great beers so it was either bad when I bought it or its just lousy."
"Really impressive and highly drinkable."
"Poured into a tulip, dark brown with ruby tinted edges and a huge, chocolate milk colored head that falls slowly, becoming rocky and leaving some good lacing. Nice chocolate and sour dark fruit notes but somewhat light on the roasted barley. Taste has more roasted flavor than the nose lets on, hints of coffee and baker's chocolate, again with the dark fruits and very light sourness in the background. Bitter and sweet at the same time, but not sweet stout sweet. Medium to full bodied, plenty of carbonation as this one's refermented in the bottle. Quite drinkable as the alcohol is well-hidden for 8%. Very nice export stout. This is my second of this style next to Guinness Export, and it comes in a close second."
"D: Not a bad brew, just not very stout like to me.... Got a little better as it warmed up."
"(rated Feb 13, 2007)"
"Drinkablity: Decent stout. It is an interesting variation within the style that makes it unique An excellent session brew. It was neat to try a brew from Sri Lanka."
"D: This one sips very, very easily. I actually wouldn't have minded it being a little thicker and chewier, with a fuller body. It's super easy to drink and very tasty. Count me as a fan."
"This brew is extremely drinkable. I want more."
"D - Very tasty. 8% ABV. A bit pricey though $10.496 pack. There are better stouts for the money."
"Thanks Lion Stout for making me a believer in foreign stouts again. Awesome."
"D - It's great - a very nice stout to sip."
"D: This isn't one I can drink much of. It's got some flair in the flavor department, but it's strong, fizzy and heavy....a dessert beer for sure."
"D: overall very rich and good drikability. One of the better bears to come out of Asia. The 8% drinks very nicely and is well hidden. A dark roasted treat with a lot of complexity woven within."
"D: mid to low. It warms a lot for such and ABV. I've seen stouts with higher ABV having the alcohol feel much more hidden. Might get tired of the taste after some of these."
"A very good beer/stout."
"As a stout lover, I have always wanted to try this beer. Saw a six pack recently, thought not many places have sixers of this, so I picked it up on a whim. I am glad I did. Poured into stemmed glassware. Extremely dark black color. Pale white head. Heavy smell of roasted barley. On the first sip, I got a pronounced smoky flavor. I liked that, very unusual in a stout. As it warmed up, you could taste more of a sweet milky chocolate flavor as you swallow. Slightly slick on the throat, but very easy to drink. The alcohol was noticeable, but it nothing to distract me from this wonderful stout. A top notch brew from this far way brewery."
"This a very enjoyable beer. I had it from a snifter which served to enhance the toffee-like smell of the stout. It has a dark brown almost black color to it, with a rather tan head. Unlike a lot of the stouts that I have tried, this one has a nice clean finish to it, does not leave an overpowering after-taste and has a good body. I would label the taste as being a reserved blend of chocolate and caramel. I highly recommend this beer, especially to those who enjoy dark lagers and are looking for the same in a stout."
"Future outlook: Repeat business imminent."
"One of the finest stouts I have had the pleasure to enjoy. I have a feeling that the six pack will not last long and I will be going back for more."
"I let the beer sit for a while to warm up a bit and the slightly warmer temp brought out more complexities in both the aroma and the flavor. Overall, this was a surprisingly good beer. This will definitely be put on my ""purchase again"" list."
"I would say you could kick back a couple of these due to its smoothness and well balance, plus you cant really taste the alcohol"
"Lion Stout purrs like mellow gold in the glass, this is one well brewed stout. Awesome roasted malt aroma semi-sweet and very rich in bittersweet chocolate. Real dark pour, light isn't allowed to pass. Big tan head and moderate lacing. Exceptionally smooth and creamy, very good mouthfeel especially the way it hides the strong abv. Flavor is wonderful, this is a great stout that should easily appeal to those who are afraid of ""dark beers."" Lots of chocolate and dark roasted malt, not too much complexity to this one but it hits the nail right on the head and at rock bottom pricing you would be hard pressed to find a better buy."
"D- It is a tad on the sweet side, but it is a very enjoyable beer, and even more interesting since it came from Sri Lanka."
"The only downside was I bought just 1 stubby...bumma!!"
"D - A medium bodied stout for the most part. Very drinkable as the alcohol is barely noticable. Again this beer lends some unique flavors not usually seen in typical stouts. Definatly worth trying!"
"D: Pretty drinkable as it was sweet and not overly bitter. I did not detect the high alcohol levels while I was drinking it either."
"Good deep brown almost black beer. When poured into a pint glass it was a inch and a half of foam reducing down to a good lingering lacing. Great aroma greats the nose from the beer of a cooking chocolate and mocha malt. Flavor agrees with the nose and has a good full flavorful mouthfeel overall."
"I was definitely shocked and pleasantly surprised at how good this beer is. Highly recommended."
"M + D: A well rounded body, though a little more on the medium side of things. Again, that's not a negative point as it ends up being a very nice beer. Alcohol doesn't really stand out here, making it a very easy 8% and something I'd gladly pick up again."
"D - I only had one, but I wanted more, lots more."
"D - This is a great tasting stout. Fairly easy-drinking despite the alcohol content."
"Try it instead of a port or as a night cap perhaps"
"D - Easy drinker here. This stout is not that bitter and the 8% is hidden very well."
"paired with scharffen berger 70% cacao dark chocolate wonderfully :D"
"Drinkability- This is about as good as it gets on a foreign/export stout level."
"Eric"
"Smell is lactic, heavily roasted malts and some cocoa. Taste is more of the roasted malts. There is a certain lactic, metallic flavor that is not jiving with me. Medium mouthfeel and bitter."
"This beer is very drinkable, but just a hint too balanced towards the sweetness for my taste."
"The flavor more than made up for that, delivering an intense burst of milk chocolate, espresso, and caramel malts that immediately gave way to rich, dark chocolate notes, coffee grounds, and a warming booze presence that added a touch of dark fruit (raisin & fig). Mouthfeel was smooth & medium-bodied, with a fizzy carbonation level that livened up the palate, making it take note of the complexities that enveloped it. Excellent finish, almost chalky at first, of chocolate liquor and brandy. Quite an exceptional brew here, my only problem is that I took far too long to discover it."
"D. As sessionable as an 8% stout can be. On tap it is especially nice. Reccommended."
"D- A acceptable stout. however it could be heavier in body and have a more complex and balanced palate instead of just being such a one note song."
"Plenty of dark malts. I felt this one was a little under par for the style. It's good but the smoothness isn't there from other Export Stouts I have tried in the past."
"An extremely superb stout that would hold up easily against the best Imperial Stouts out there. It's easy to understand Michael Jackson's approval of this one."
"Dense black body topped with two lush fingers of mocha tan froth with excellent duration and thick lacing. Nice but subtle scents--coffee, caramel, cocoa--that would be great if more prominent. They sure are in the taste, especially the coffee and cocoa, encased in a fine, sweet and slightly bitter melange. This is very fine stout, better than I expected, easy on the palate, good mouthfeel and eminently drinkable. Don't pass this stout by, it's terrific and worthy to be considered in the company of other very good English and Oatmeal Stouts. Very well done."
"I was very surprised by this stout. I thought it wouldn't be very good and instead is was very tasty. There is nothing rude, harsh or nasty in this stout, making it nearly as drinkable as a creamy Guinness with a completely different vibe. It exudes great taste. complexity and a lingering goodness are what you get with this great drink. I need to buy it again!"
"M/D: Did not have a heavy feel like most stouts but did leave your mouth very dry. It was very drinkable and I would highly recommend this stout although it is not my favorite."
"Overall a very good stout. Good representation of the style. If ya get a chance pick a few up."
"Pours a dark brown/black with a modest tan head the retreats quickly lacing the glass on the way down. Smell of dried fruit, and a bit of cocoa, some phenolic or higher alcohol in there to. Tastes of bitter roasted chocolate and coffee with a bit of dark fruit, then ends with some roast bitterness and a bit of alcohol or maybe fusel, its muted but there and I can't put my finger on it. Medium to thin body with a creamy/oily mouthfeel. Lingering roast bitterness after each sip. Good stout, a bit to vinous for my taste."
"D- I could definitely enjoy this stout on a regular basis, Micheal Jackson was right to put his endorsement on this one."
"Other BA's seem to like this brew, I, on the other hand did not. Maybe my taste buds are not sophisticated enough lol. For $7 a 6-pack, give it a try and see what you think."
"This kicks the crap out of anything I've tasted from England or Ireland in terms of a Foreign or even Imperial Stout. The smoke doesn't dominate, but it's presence is certainly obvious and blends in quite well. What makes this stout stand out from the others is the smooth, complex flavours that are still bold... I find the ""bold"" part to be missing from most ""classic"" examples. Incredible stuff."
"Very enjoyable Foreign Export stout, I love the flavors and find the craftsmanship remarkable."
"This is newly arrived in Arizona, so I don't understand why this is so bad; and to be honest the flavors of this beer seem pretty fresh, it is just that there are also some significantly off components to this beer as well."
"D- 8% is hidden very well in this one. It definitely can only slightly be detected in the nose, but nothing else. I can see having this again in the future."
"(On-tap at Barley and Hops Bottle Shop, Pittsburgh (Bethel Park), PA)"
"Nice beer for the ages."
"I would not open another."
"More than tasty, but less complex than I thought it would be. A different beer, but good none the less."
"A good stepping stone for me to the bigger beers ive been enjoying."
"Really nice."
"d- this is already one of my favorites so ill definitely be having it again"
"Notes: I am not the biggest stout fan (2 to 3 Guinness's a year) but this one is quite enjoyable. Certainly if you enjoy stout then you should try this. I would love to find it on tap somewhere."
"D: The Lion Stout is definitely a drinkable beer. While not my favorite in the stout category, it's still solidly done."
"This is amazingly smooth and creamy. Just a wonderful stout that is easy to drink, high in alcohol, and a must try for stout (or any) lovers."
"33cl brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a pitch black body with the slightest hint of ruby-red highlights and a good inch or so of tan head that persists and leaves lacing. Smells roasty with strong caramel notes, coffee, baker's chocolate... Tastes very roasty with chocolate, coffee, caramel, and toffee notes. Fairly sweet right to the finish. Rich full mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Very tasty, fairly drinkable considering the ABV and rich flavors, and an old favorite for sure. Surprised I haven't reviewed it sooner!"
"D = Definalely not a session beer, this quaff is best served at cellar temp and allowed time to ""breath."" As this occurs, a velvety smoothness will eminate. To be slowly savored!"
"Not a fan."
"d: very sweet and interesting but has very unenjoyable metallic aftertaste despite being a year from the exp date"
"was very smooth, especially for a stout. I could, and did drink a couple. I am not the greatest stout fan but will have this again in the future."
"D- For as high of ABV as it carries, pretty drinkable."
"In one word: Excellent. I do love stouts and I was excited to try one from a country I do not usually purchase beer from. The beer was poured dark brown, almost black with a thick tan head that left decent lacing. It smelled of caramel and raisins. The taste had a tangy start and a malty finish, giving it a great balance. It was fun each time I put it in my mouth and I looked forward to each new sip! The taste, much like the smell also had hints of caramel, raisins, and espresso. The finish was like bittersweet chocolate. Highly recommended."
"Overall - A decent stout that gives a pleasant alcoholic kick to your evening, but it doesn't have enough body to keep it together. I found it actually slightly watery for a stout with too much carbonation. Still, stout lovers should give it a try. 'Tis a different catch."
"This is a pretty tasty beer that just seems a little rough around the edges to me. Still, I could see myself drinking this when it's chilly outside and being very happy."
"D - This brew is blander than I'd like, and while I normally don't find myself reaching for stouts, if I did, this wouldn't be near the top of my list."
"Medium-full-bodied with a sting of carbonation. Excellent drinkability."
"I'm not jumping out of my chair, but I can't find much wrong with this beer. Worth a look."
"This stout is always a treat and remains still, probably, the finest example of a foreign stout I've tried. It is balanced, endlessly drinkable and chalk full of an unlimited long list of flavours. This would pair wonderfully with a number of desserts and is something I'd recommend every beer drinker try."
"Poured black with a slight brownish tint of brown in the light. Head was pretty nice, light brown and somewhat thin. Nose just smelled extra smooth and subtle. Some dark chocolate and mocha with a slight roastiness. Taste is chocolate upfront and the mocha hits you about halfway to finish. Not dry either like most stouts. This was very smooth and no bite. Very interesting stout. This stout is one of the most drinkable stouts I have ever had. The ABV was just right and very mellow with lots of taste!!!. EXCEPTIONAL"
"This stout pours with a ton of milk chocolate-colored head, maybe 2-3 fingres worth. Jet black with a syrup-like consistency. The lacing is very interesting in that when I splash the beer around the snifter it coats the edges in a very foamy, consistent manner. The aroma is primarily of chocolate with a slight scent of black coffee bean. Wow. It has a very prominent roasted coffee and extremely dark chocolate flavor to it. The mouthfeel is sort of thin, but it's a great sipping beer. Not too much carbonation either."
"This poured an opaque black with lots of tan head. It smelled like earthy malt and roasted dark chocolate. It tasted like roasted (or even burnt) coffee beans, and super earthy dark chocolate. It was watery with no carbonation and had a dry chocolate aftertaste. Overall this was a good quality beer that was clean and easy to drink. However, I expected (hoped for) a little more flavor, especially considering its high alcohol percentage."
"This beer pours a deep brown, almost black with a minimal head and some lacing. Smell was roasted malts and a bit of hops. Taste is the same with a bit of licorice and coffee and chocolate in the aftertaste, pleasantly bitter, nice contrast to the sweetness you get initially. Mouthfeel is good, makes this a great sipper. I'll have another! Very nice stout and I will buy this again."
"Pours a deep black with chocolate brown head-slight hop aroma in pour. Sweet malt flavor-almost port sweet? Alcohol is very evident in finish-which is very sweet. Mouthfeel is thin-and drinkability takes a hit because of the sweetness and the alcohol-still a solid export stout. One that should be enjoyed by all stout lovers."
"drinkability is good. this is a smooth and rich stout, with only one flaw: a bit too sweet. no other complaints, as this is a solid stout. cheers!"
"This beer poured a nice thick brown/black if you will with a tan one finger tan head. It appeared to be nice and creamy from the pour. As soon as I poured, I could smell chocolate, roasted malts, and some fruits. After it settled I caught a fresh moca aroma. The taste was chocolatey with the roasted malts and moca present, with smokey after notes to follow. It was rich and filling and I found it quite easy to drink. Definitely a great beer to enjoy whenever you can find it."
"The alcohol is surprisingly masked behind the other flavors...it drinks like a beer of about 4%, not eight. Very smooth, flavorful and pleasurable. A stout for any occasion."
"D - quite drinkable. A nice stout."
"great thick, smooth, creamy mouthfeel, this is an easy stout to sit down with and just enjoy."
"Poured into a pint glass (room temp) this brew was coffee black with a brownish gray head that left nice lacing. The brew has a smoky smell with chocolate notes and a mild floral nose. The taste is mild with a medium body. The after taste is very smooth. There are some deep flavors of roasted malts, but not too much on the sweet side. The balance is nice, no bitterness, and very smooth. This is a nice brew, decent balance but not really something I could drink more than one or two at a time."
"Excellent engine oil pour, with a hefty ginger bread color. Chocolate cake, icing, a very sexy nose. The sweetness is balanced by dark burnt raisins, and dark chocolate. The sweetness is piloting and controlling this airplane, but the chocolate covered gingerbread man is rolling in the passenger seat doing work-quitely. I like this stout, very interesting and entertaining while having complexity and drinkablity. A good stout. Creamy, yet carbination to balance it all."
"(Note to self: number one of six cellared)"
"Smooth like velvet but the meatiness throws me off a little. Very nicely rounded and carbonated just right, but that odd quality of the body makes it less than I was expecting. It's a prime example of what a full-bodied stout should be, but it's not my personal favorite, though I can definitely understand why everyone else likes it."
"I've always though of Export Stouts being like a mixed beer, Dry Imperial Stout, if you could imagine that hybrid. That being said, the drinkability suffers a little bit... 8%, full flavour, with a full, full body; but very delicious."
"overall, this could be the necter of the gods, one of the best brews that i have ever had his will always have a place in my fridge"
"This beer is a little too carbonated but it's nothing major. Finish is semidry, body is a little heavier than medium. Alcohol's only contribution is a little nip at the end of the sip."
"A decent big stout, meant for sipping."
"d - This is a good stout, very smooth. The alcohol is a little high and definitely present in the taste, but that is really the only thing that stands out to me (as maybe a negative). I found it odd that there wasn't really an aftertaste; It was just dry. It doesn't do anything out of the ordinary, it's just a solid stout. If I can find something similar to this with less alcohol then this will be replaced."
"all in all, a damn good stout."
"Hell ya! This is a great stout! Ruby chestnut edges to a extremely deep brown brew. Beach sand head. Plenty of lacing down the crystal. Only a slight off flavor in this beer, but drowned out by the delicious maltiness and pleasant mouthfeel. Nice balance of flavor -- simple and to the point. Tasted at cellar temperature."
"Good with a spicy meal or as a winter warm up."
"Overall: A solid, easy drinking stout with good strong flavors. One too have again for sure."
"M/D: Full bodied, light carbonation, a little slick. Very good drinkability for a big stout. Pretty tasty."
"I know that this beer has gotten pretty good reviews, but personally, it's just not for me."
"T,M,D-Like aroma, the coffee and bittersweet chocolate shine through marvelously. The roasted malts are slightly sweet, and the body is a bit lighter than what I was expecting. I also expected the roasted sensation to feel darker. Well balanced and creamy. Easy and smooth to drink."
"This beer poured a near black and relatively thick consistency. It produced a nice head, and just looked great in the mug. It had a deep flavor that paired exceptionally with my cheese plate. It had a filling mouth feel(which is great to me) and finished really clean."
"Easy drinkabilty as well, with attractive, crisp, refreshing flavors... Different, unique, and definitely recommended..."
"I think the drinkability on this is fantastic!..this is one of the best Stouts I have tried...I highly recommend!"
"drinkability is decent. though i wouldn't want a bunch in one sitting it sure is tasty stuff and very well made. the character of the ale is perplexing, like i said. it looks charred but doesn't taste or smell of it. alcohol is well hidden."
"12oz bottle purchased from Danforth and Broadview LCBO in Toronto. I just had a 500mL Schneider Eisbock before this, so forgive me if I am in love with the world or mistype. Pours black with a small, quickly receding white head. Initial, somewhat thin, aroma of coffee. First taste is nice and richly full, with more coffee on the palate. Taste remains strong throughout. Very nice."
"Overall, a good foreign stout that I wish I had more of."
"M&D: Heavy mouthfeel and full bodied. Very light but persistent carbonation goes well with the favors and heaviness at hand. At 8% I was expecting some warming but didn't really experience any. Goes down pretty smoothly."
"D - Being that it is a softer stout I could have many of these. Well...as many as the 8% would allow. Not a big beer but a good beer. The dryness of this could also make it a decent thirst quencher."
"The flavor has a nice roasted taste. To a lesser extent some more complex flavors are present. I expected more chocolate, espresso, and fruit tastes after smelling the beer. It has a slightly sweet quality as well. It has a medium body with healthy carbonation. A good tasting stout that I am now seeing just about everywhere beer is sold."
"Off brownish white head dissipates slowly to a thin film. Huge aroma of roasted barley and pure chocolate and hints of fresh coffee bean. Flavor is all FES, roasted malt, coffee, soft and pleasant astingency. Alcohol is well cloaked, this would pair wonderfuly with a N-Y cheesecake or a big bowl of ripe cherries."
"D - Definitely a sipping beer (as with most stouts) though probably a little more drinkable than most other stouts."
"D: A powerful beer that I wouldn't want more than one of in a sitting. Great right before bed or on a cold night in front of the fire."
"d: A deceptively easy drinking stout, don't forget about its high abv. I haven't had many export stouts, but I really like this one."
"This was an enjoyable and easy to drink stout from Lion."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly bitter coffee aftertaste. This is an outstanding beer to sip, but it's smoothness makes it slide down easily. Try this beer if you find it, if you enjoy stouts, you won't be disappointed."
"D: Super easy drinking. The export stouts are great for that while still giving you a reasonable amount of flavor. For the $2.99 I paid for the bomber it is definitely worth it."
"Well-crafted for the format. Extra-toasty malt aroma that's slightly understated for the style; the toastiness comes out much more on the palate. Not as much backbone as would be expected from the stout; it's pretty much the toasted malt at the front and not a lot of depth after that. Would like to try on tap as rarely does a bottle do something like this justice."
"Drinkability: I'm guessing the metal taste was only part of tihs bad batch we had. Would try it again, but am not holding out hope."
"Overall not a bad beer, but there are plenty of other stouts I would choose first."
"This looks absolutely beautiful. Pitch black body, with a foamy toffee coloured head, which cleared up to leave lacing of the same colour. Nice espresso and malt aroma The flavour packs a punch of coffee, chocolate, and perhaps licorice. The finish is long and warming. A great beer."
"D - This is a very tasty stout. I find it amazing this comes from Sri Lanka considering the climate."
"d-I will not have this beer, again, i rate it average just because it prob tastes a lot better where consumed in the country of origin, Sri Lanka"
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of India ink, with a thin medium tan head - nose of roasted coffee, anis, earthy, chocolate, vanilla, and milk chocolate  taste of milk chocolate, some bitter sweet chocolate, cappuccino, and - body is medium, silky, and with low carbonation  aftertaste of chocolate, mocha, and veggie???"
"one of my favorite stouts, its very different from most of the offerings on the market and will probably taste interesting aged."
"Drinkability: nice stout that is a slow sipper and mildly warming on a cold winter evening. A few of these can be easily quaffed in a long session."
"Drinkability: A very nice stout from an unexpected part of the globe"
"Pours a dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy tan head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slight vanilla/roast, good touch of toffee, chocolate, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet/roasty, malty, with some nice toffee/chocolate/caramel tones. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very nice stout in deed, recommended."
"Overall- Sri Lanka's best brew. I'm glad the brewery was able to survive the terrible storms a few years ago. I discovered this one some years back and have come back to it many a time."
"Served to cold it seems like a bitter assault. I'm looking forward to laying down a few."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This brew is heavy on the palate and is quite thick.This is a beer that I'd not hesitate to drink again, though I don't think that I'd want to drink it all night. Alcohol is too high for it to be a session, plus you can easily detect it. This one is a good slow sipper, I think that the 625ml bottle it comes in is a great serving size. This is one I can see myself buying again, though It might be awhile. By the way it seems really appropriate during the colder months, don't think that this would be as enjoyable during the summer."
"$3.49 for a 625ml bottle w/ no freshness date and a Michael Jackson blurb on the back saying that it is top fermenting and bottle conditioned. Black with a big coffee with cream colored head that didn't hold too well, but left nice lace. roasted malt, some chocolate and a little sweetness/fruit. taste is the same as nose but better. pretty complex, very well balanced. some coffee flavors and some smokiness comes out as well. mouthfeel is on the lighter side of full, but still full for sure and creamy/oily. hint of bitter or maybe bittersweet in the finish. nice and soft. very well done, solid stout. simple yet complex. not overboard or out there. very drinkable and enjoyable. who knew the sri lankans could do it up so well?"
"Overall: Excellent. I really enjoyed this one, and will definitely go back for more."
"This is definitely a full flavored beer with a great mouthfeel. It's very earthy and easy to drink. One of my favorite stouts."
"pours pitch black with a large dark tan head with moderate retention and lacing. aromas of prunes, chocolate, roasted malt. some sweetness to the taste with a stale or burnt coffee and chocolate. full bodied with a moderate carbonation. nicely balanced stout, hard to believe that a beer this good can be brewed in sri lanka."
"A little more bitter and lighter than the Baltic porters that I am used to."
"Overall, a very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"Pours a pitch black-brown, can't see any light through it whatsoever. There's a decent amount of creamy tan head that disappears rather quickly, leaving a thin layer that still wants to stick to the glass. I smell malt and chocolate, a tiny bit of roast coffee, and very faintly, some berry. The taste is a lot sweeter than I was expecting, more of a strong porter than stout. It's all malt taste, though. The berry flavor is stronger in the flavor, but it's still mostly coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is heavy and creamy, hardly any carbonation there at all, which would explain the lack of head retention. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer, especially for the style, of which I'm not really a fan."
"Dark black color with a nice 1"" tan head. The aromas are of sweet English malts mixed with sour Belgian yeasts. The taste is of fresh dark chocolates and well blended with the bitter hops. It is somewhat between a dark Belgian strong ale and a dry Irish stout. The light body makes this very drinkable for an 8% stout."
"I think this beer for the money is an excellent brew! I was a little skeptical at first, but I came around and bought it. Who would have know that they make good beer in Sri Lanka."
"Pours black with a thick brown head, but eventually becomes just a lace. The high alcohol is very present in the aroma with some roasted malt too. Taste is very pronounced with bitter roasted malts flavor. I sense a little coffee malt also. The high alcohol content is also very pronounced in the flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth going down and a little bitter, but carbonation is minimal. Overall this is a decent beer and a good stout."
"Opaque black in color with 3 finger head and very sporadic lacing on the move. Fruit, coffee, roasted malts and chocolate nose. Chocolate and Coffee flavor with a residual roasted malt note left behind. Thick mouthfeel with a little co2 burn. Decently drinkable, maybe a bit too heavy to drink more then a few."
"Pours absolutely pitch black with almost two fingers of fairly long lasting light brown head that leaves sporadic lacing. Good aroma, roasted barley which is quickly joined by a pleasant sweetness are dominant but dark fruits and molasses linger in the background, slightly vinous. Taste is initially sweet but then quickly dries out. The dryness is produced by roasted grains, which are ever so slightly burnt. There is some fruitiness here as well as some light molasses that jumps out just after the dryness appears. The fruitiness lingers into the aftertaste, after the dryness has disappeared. In the late aftertaste the roastyness reappears. Not much bitterness to speak of, seems like its more from the roasted grains rather than any hops. Good mouthfeel, medium-heavy body with medium carbonation and a smooth, slightly creamy feel to it. Drinkability is good, alcohol hides its presence quite well. Overall an enjoyable stout that has a good bit of complexity to it. To experience this beer in its full glory I suggest serving this at the higher end of the recommended temperature range, this will bring out the wonderful fruitiness that makes this beer so enjoyable."
"Tastes of chocolate, fruits, slight hop bitterness and coffee. The finish has a good lingering roasted malt and molasses taste. A great beer to have anytime, but especially on a cold day as the alcohol is inviting and warming."
"D: This beer is amazingly sessionable for how big and rounded it is. A very nice brew."
"As a frequent visitor to South Asia I have done my best to find a good, locally produced beer. Despite being leading beer producers India, for instance, have yet to put a decent beer on the market. As things stand it's Sri Lanka that is the beer champion of the region. The market is dominated by two breweries: McCallum and Lion in a pretty much even race. Both of them do a good stout. My Lion Stout poured pitch black with little foam. Smelling of ashes, cold cuts, coffee and some alcohol. The taste was rather sweet and a little bitter with a strong note of alcohol. There were also notes of chocolate, coffee and ashes. Maybe a tinge too sweet for my taste but proves that good beers can be produced in South Asia."
"Smooth mouthfeel provided by the smoke and on the heavier side of medium. Very drinkable for a stout of this abv. I really wish I picked up more."
"I'd love to try this against some milk stouts and some imperial stouts as this beer seems to have attributes of both."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable enough stout. Want to thank wcudwight for this sample."
"Mouthfeel is very important with this beer. I think because of its smooth effortless flow from glass to stomach it makes this beer that much better. No zing from carbonation, no bite from hops, it is just smooth. Lion Stout has a way of coating your entire mouth with it's wonderful milky smooth chocolaty goodness. Hooray for Good Beer!"
"D: Hell yeah! This is my kind of brew. Very good, and doesnt hurt that it came at a time when I was getting tired of all the summer brews Id had been having lately. But something about this one just really impressed me made me smile. Definitely worth trying."
"D- This beer is smooth and mellow but has a nice malt flavor and some subtle depth that is hard to put in words. A bit of some wild notes or perhaps smoked malt but whatever it is, it is soft enough to be intriguing and not offensive."
"Pours a velvety dark brown to black, leaving a pitch black body in the glass. The head implodes from a thick three-finger head into a paper-thin sheet. Smells of hard chocolate and a mild roasted character tease the nose. The roasted flavor isn't bitter at all, but this brew isn't as deep as I would expect. Is it a good beer? Yes, but it lacks a strong flavor and/or complexities related to a strong stout. But hey, it's easy to drink, and that's not a bad quality to have."
"I tried this beer on August 27, 2007 at Smokeless Joe's in Toronto. The beer poured a dark chocolate brown into a unibroue tulip glass with a very generous brown head. The aroma was reminiscent of malt, chocolate, and coffee. The mouthfeel is thick with mild carbonation. The flavour was very good, some malt and coffee hints."
"Great value at $2.99 a bottle."
"d: could accompany a barbequed steak, but also good on it's own, on a cold rainy day"
"Respect this beer and it will give you a great new stout for your fridge."
"I really love this beer and despite the 8% ABV I enjoy it as a session beer or with any of my meals."
"I bought this as Sinha Stout in Ontario. This stout poured a solid, opaque black with a half inch tan head that lingered. The smell was of fresh toffee or like walking into a kitchen with brownies cooking. I found mild carbonation in the mouth with a bitter, dark chocolate taste giving way to a sweet, nutty aftertaste. A hint of something roasted and a rich, malty mouth feel. Overall, this is a pleasant stout and hard to believe it's eight percent alcohol."
"from zrrbrrt for my bombing"
"A bit dry, very smooth, and extremely well-incorporated 8% alcohol. A very good stout. Would be an excellent introduction to someone just discovering the style."
"Drinkability - I was suprised by this stout. I had actively avoided it due to the ""hype"" I've heard associated with it. I'm glad I took the advice of a fellow SC BA'er and picked this up from a local Total Wine. I'll put this into my regular rotation. For an 8% ABV stout, this is quite drinkable."
"Served in the new Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a dark brown color with an inch and a half foamy tan head. Lacing and head retention is excellent. It smells like roasted malt, coffee, molasses and dark chocolate. Taste is definitely on the bitter side, mostly like coffee and dark chocolate with a bit of roasted malt. The sweetness comes out a bit more as the beer warms up. Mouthfeel is medium, it's thinner than I expected it to be. WIth that being said, the beer is still smooth, dry and a bit slick. Drinkability is very good, it's easy to drink and the alcohol isn't very noticable at all. Overall I think this is a pretty decent stout. If you get the chance to try this beer you should, but that's just my opinion."
"This has a great roasty smell but not a lot of roast flavor. Lot and lots of foam reminiscent of a soda more than a beer, but once gone, left great lacing. It feels a bit thin for a stout but you would never know it was eight percent. Would definetly buy again."
"Overall this was ok. Maybe a notch above average for a stout, but just wasnt really what I was looking for. It really needed some more sweetness to it...It was good dont get me wrong, just not something I would really want to drink alot of. Give a shot for a try, it was definatly good for that."
"I saw some potential in their Imperial Lager, I figured the Stout would prove solid. The beer pours an expected rich dark-brown hue, and an unexpected dense, viscous texture. The foamstand rises to an inch and remains firm through the session. Solid aromas of roasted barley, toast, rich coffee, and cocoa swirl around a mild fermented lactose sweet scent. Flavors closely follow those found in the aroma and remain bold and clean without ever waivering. The beer has no single character that rises above the rest, relying on balance and maturity to produce high quality. Full and rich to the mouth, without becomming thick or chewy. Finishes sweet and with a solid roasted barley flavor (not charcoal). It's difficult to find a more solidly brewed Stout, however it's lack of challenging character leaves me wanting more."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is black with a two finger, sparkling nut-brown head. Smell is slightly sweet with coffee and roasted malt notes and a touch of smoke. The taste reminds me of Guinness, only slightly bitterer and with more ABV. The malty roasted profile does a good job covering the alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a dry finish. Overall, this is a drinkable stout, especially given the ABV. In the short time it has took me to write this review I have finished nearly half of my 330 ml bottle."
"Had this beer back in the day from a beer of the month club and I always wanted to get my hands on it again. This beer pours black with a nice light brown head. Smell is great: coffee, chocolate, caramel and brownies. Taste is even better, sweet dark chocolate with roasted coffee, perfectly balanced so its not overly sweet. Very smooth and drinkable; pair this with chocolate chip brownies at you own discretion cause it may cause a diabetic seizure. This is probably the best stout I can remember having. Near perfect."
"The chocolate and caramel smell makes you believe in a taste that is to be cherished, unfortunately the real life experience doesn't quite get there for me but its certainly not a problem."
"Lion Stout pours an inky black with a thick brown head. The aroma is sweet roasted and dark malts. The taste is rich and creamy, sweet but not overly so with a nice rounded roasted malt flavor. The after taste is slightly metallic and sour. The alcohol is not noticeable, and I think its strength is hidden well. This beer certainly didn't suffer from its trip around the world from Sri Lanka."
"It's definately a grower, and as I move closer to finishing this glass, I move closer to considering buying another bottle next trip to Dan Murphy's."
"Drinkability: high"
"This strong stout poured a black color liquid with a thick tan head. Foamy thick head had excellent retention, leaving thick chunks of lace behind. Lots of different aromas like coffee, cocoa, prunes. Stout-like sweetness with a finish of earthy hops. Full bodied mixture of coffee, chocolate, charred and smoky malt. Well balance blend of flavors leaving a smooth and dry finish with no bitter after taste. Full of flavor hiding the high (8%) alcohol but with out being over sweet. Rich and smooth, great mouthfeel. Very good example - I see why it is ranked the highest of its style."
"The beer is a deep black with a fair head that fades to a light layer. There is a small amount of lacing. The smell is smoke, roasted grain and coffee. The taste is rich and the coffee and oatmeal flavors show up prominatly. The mouthfeel is good, with the abv well hidden untill the aftertaste where is shows a little. The drinkability as good as I could drink this beer again."
"D - Good beer that I'd get on a semi-regular basis."
"This is a very good beer at a great price. I was pleasantly surprised and would be happy to drink this any time. Recommended."
"P.S. - This beer would probably make a great stout float. Put 2 scoops of good real vanilla ice cream in a stout glass and top off with this beer. You'll love it!"
"Note. It has one of the nicest bottlecaps I've ever seen."
"I noticed Michael Jackson's photo was right on the label, so I knew it was good. Appearance was an inky black, with lots of fluffy white head which agggressively stuck around. Aroma was chocolatey, with abundant alchol or maybe bourbon esters. I noticed the mouthfeel before the flavor: the bottle conditioning MJ pointed out on the label made this beer velvety smooth. Flavor was very chocolatey and roasty and dry and delicious! Highly recommended."
"Basically a lighter, but very drinkable and tasty export stout.You'd never guess it was 8% abv, I've had thicker normal stouts. The flavor is a smooth chocolate with a bit of mocha (sorta like MJ says on the label). I found the aroma weak, but the taste and drinkability fun."
"M/D: solid beer that delivers and is tasty, def worth a try"
"D - Good tasting stout with an interesting cinnamon note in the smell."
"very dark brown body capped by two finger brown head that's fizzy and quick on its descent, leaving no webbing on the glass. just a slight leftover hint of lace and thin halo remain. smells of dark chocolate, chalk, apples, and charcoal. taste is terrific, fruity and at the same time nice and roasty. absolutely no trace of the 8% abv in the flavor. burnt toast finish. mouthfeel is a bit thin, but that makes it all the more drinkable, in a way. caramel, wafers, oats, blackberries... quite the complex flavor. very enjoyable."
"This is a good all around stout, although it is not my favorite. Fairly drinkable and a reasonable flavor."
"Poured a murky black with a thin head but good retention and substance. The smell is of roasted malts with a chocolaty back ground. Very smooth and inviting. The taste was very roasted, very malty, very smooth-- very good. The alcohol is well hidden and there is solid balance in the mouthfeel. Good stuff."
"This beer pours an impressive black with red edges with a creamy tan head that lasts. Aroma of roasted barley, dark chocolate, some prune. Taste was huge roasted barley, with some burnt toast. Mouthfeel was very smooth and lighter in body than expected, definitely appropriate even on a hot day. This is a great export stout, and a good value as well."
"Thanks to bitterbill for including this one!"
"Overall - This is a very nice sweet stout, well-balanced and delicious."
"The body is fairly thick with a mild carbonation. A bit acidic with some tannins. The finish lingers for a little while, but ends clean with only a fleeting memory of coffee roast. Fairly drinkable for an 8% stout, but it's not something I would want to drink more than one of in a sitting."
"Lion Stout? Sri Lanka, huh? Well, I had never heard of this beer, much less a beer this good from Sri Lanka. Came in a heavy 330 ml bottle. Poured a near pitch black with a thin, brownish head. Smells lovely, roasted malts and a lingering sweetness behind it all. Taste is above the average stout and quite unique. Bold and fairly complex for what I had expected. Definitely not a one-dimensional stout in my opinion. Some chocolate, coffee, and sweetness all in there with an excellent roast bite. Mouthfeel is also great. Medium to full bodied with a creamy texture. Very smooth and enjoyable. There's no way I'd believe this was 8% if it wasn't on the label. Easily drinkable and from what I've seen well worth the price. I'd challenge an entire sixer if I had better access to this brew. Recommended highly."
"RERATE: It's still awesome, and fills that perfect middle ground between an imp and a porter. Plus it's cheap as hell."
"This is the king of the jungle when it comes to stout! This is a great brew from Sri Lanka of all places. I picked this up at the Wine Cellar in Kenwood, OH. If has a deep rich chocolate/roasted coffee flavor that I associate with this style. It has good head retention and solid mouthfeel. so far, it is the best stout I have tasted."
"each other..."
"Overall: Too much alcohol to be a session brew, but this would be a great dessert beer."
"Drinkability: I could understand why this won 5 gold international beer medals and why Michael Jackson let Lion Stout put his name and face on the back of their bottle. That's becuase it's sooo good. I could see myself buying another big bottle of Lion Stout and enjoying it again. It's a Lion of a beer!"
"A solid stout let down by a pretty thin mouthfeel and a few off flavours in the form of DMS, still worth a try"
"Later she must leave me - but this dark queen of a beer stays on my tongue and in my mind for long."
"Further sips and and nothing really changes. I note that the body on this one is on the thin side though the taste never does lean towards the watery side. It's good. I'm glad I got to try it but...it's not something I'd seek out again."
"This beer is very creamy and has a great coffee flavor with chocolate in the background. No one would ever guess the alcohol content of this just by drinking it. Very drinkable beer with an awesome bottle. It only has one downfall. The aftertaste. Its not bitter or even dry. Its very prevelent. It almost seemed like a teriyaki or some other Asian flavor to it. This is different and makes it stand out against other similar stouts but it does not seem to match with the rest of the taste."
"Overall - A very good and well balanced stout... nothing earth shattering but well worth a try..."
"Beautiful dark pour out of the bottle with a classic rich tan head. Very sweet and creamy with hints of licorice, chocolate and nutty thrown into a well crafted Stout. Would recommend anyone who likes stouts to give this a try. A big stout that will surely please even the toughest of critics."
"The bomber bottle didn't last long."
"Poured this beer into tumbler at 48 degrees. Beer was very black with a giant brown head that really lasted. Fruity nose chocolate oozing from chocolaty head. Good lacing. Slight interesting smoky taste but also a bit sour to me which turned me off. Will not buy again."
"You know, it's not perfect but it tastes good and I'd gladly have another. A beer that represents South Asia like none other I've tried."
"D - Despite the alcohol content, this is a very drinkable beer. I would session with this, and I will surely look for this again."
"One of my new go to stouts."
"Purchased at local liquor store and poured into a nonic, full one finger tan, almost gray head, with clumpy lacing and decent retention. The body is opaque polished black color. Smells of subtle chocolate up front with, toasted notes, a smoky character, maybe some sherried raisins, and a pleasant nuttiness. Tastes is of slightly fudgy chocolate with toasted round malt notes, after it warms it becomes rather silky. The bitterness is subtle and comes toward the midsection the finish is a sort of dry and wet at the same time with medium mouthfeel. I have to say this was drunk through out a spicy curry dinner and the ends of a cold, but Ill stand by this review till I have this again and prove myself wrong. Anyhow this is totally worth hazing not the most amazing, but totally economic and tasty."
"Extremely drinkable brew from an exotic far off land, and at $2.99 for this bomber one hell of a deal."
"I like this beer and understand why Michael Jackson likes this one so much."
"Wow, this stout rocked me. I wasn't expecting much from a Sri Lankain beer, just wanted to taste it for the novelty, and what do you know, I think this is my current favorite stout. Nice creamy mouth feel with out being cloying or sticky. Just a touch of alchol finish, but not to much. Strong semi-sweet/smoky chocolate flavors without overpowering some lovely hop bitterness. Please try this beer."
"Pours a deep dark reddish color with a massive head that has tight and large bubbles that lace the glass as they recede into the beer. A nice bottle with different shaped labels which is a change from most countries. You receive a nice whiff of chocolate malt when first stick your nose in intialy. Smooth with a roast character that melds around the tongue, you can definitely pickup the alcohol taste which warms you through and through. An excellent interpretation of this great style from a surprising country."
"330 mL bottle - served in a chalice. It pours medium black with a finger of mocha head that subsides, never totally dissipating, and leaves some wisps of lace. The flavor takes awhile to fully develop, but I eventually find nice roasted malts, dark fruits (grapes, figs), almonds?, cocoa, coffee, and a light vinous character. On the palate it is quite similar, with additional notes of charred malts, blackberries?, and a faint smokiness on top of a medium to thick, dry body that contributes a powdery yeast feel. Overall an above average stout that is quite drinkable considering its strength."
"bring the FG up a couple of points and this thing is blammo"
"Had a 12 oz bottle of this on New Year's Eve (early in the evening). No freshness date on the bottle. Poured an opaque black with a thin white head. Interesting smells of burnt toast (though it wasn't bad) and dark, dark chocolate. Tastes of toasty barley, the dark chocolate, and even light hints of coffee. Medium creaminess - I prefer stouts to be a little thicker, but this was good. Fairly high ABV %, but the alcohol didn't cut through the taste. A great beer, easy to sip."
"All in all an awesome and unique beer. I haven't seen it around. I heard rumors that the brewery was not producing it any more. If you see it get... If you like stouts you won't be disappointed."
"Pours a dark body. Jet black. Aromas are immediate coffee, molasses, raisin bread, sugars, with flavours of raisin bread, chocolate, and LOTS of coffee. Very well balanced. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol not noticable. One of the great stouts of the world. A rare gem at the LCBO."
"A roasty, very dark stout in the imperial range for ABV but just low enough not to burn. Sweet, but not too sweet, with notes of chocolate, coffee, toffee. Impressive head for an imperial, but it didn't stay around long. A bit like a high-alcohol version of the old Dragon stout (Jamaica) but with more kick, more roastiness, more subtlety."
"I bought this 22 ounce bomber for just over two dollars, so I was not expecting too much, and yet again in my life, I was proved wrong. A nice stout. Black brown body, with a thick tan head. Very smooth with a great alcohol kick. Terrific roasted quality. Recommended."
"drinkability is great. really tasty and enjoyable beer."
"Passable, but there are more enjoyable stouts to be had."
"Poured into a 17-ounce snifter at cellar temp (~50 deg. F). Black-coffee dark brown with a rather substantial creamy and crater-pocked dark-tan head. Black cherry and dried fig aromas mix with a pronounced boozy scent. Fruit aromas lighten up and reveal fresh fig and roasty chocolate aspects. Interesting and complex. Black roasted malt flavor up front, becoming dark booze-soaked cherries and prunes. Dry, astringent alcohol presence in both taste and mouthfeel; chocolate and dark-roasted coffee at the finish. Vinous berry flavors in the aftertaste. Some definitely noticeable alcohol sharpness on the palate -- jarring at first, but then it cedes to a smoother, almost (but not quite) silky slickness. Actually, the alcohol seems to meld pretty well with the other flavors, tying them together with a dry oakiness, all while remaining distinct and apparent. Hmmm; root beer flavors in the burps!(?) In all, Lion Stout makes me think -- if it is at all representative of the style -- that Foreign/Export Stouts are akin to ""junior"" Russian Imperial Stouts -- sort of a ""warm up"" to those larger, more over-the-top relations. In any case, very drinkable. Secure recommendation."
"The drinkability is good but I can get better and will do so. MK"
"D- Nice, bold flavor. Very drinkable. No wonder it won 5 international gold awards."
"This brew is black with a thick and rocky tan head that fizzes away rather quickly. Thick patches of lacing. The aroma is big on roasted malt, with some semi-sweet chocolate in the background. Rich body with a tasty blend of mocha, malt and plum flavors. Frankly I am surprised they make them this good in Sri Lanka. The finish is dry and roasty, with a coffee aftertaste. Proof you cant judge a book by the cover."
"Pours a very dark brown with deep ruby highlights. Three finger head, dark tan and creamy, holds well leaving good spotty lacing. Coffee/roasted barley aromas, mild phenols and notes of dark chocolate. Very sweet upfront, big roast flavor, slight phenolic fruitiness. Drying aftertaste with lots of coffee, mild baker's chocolate, and the fruitiness fades quickly. Acrid roast flavor balances fine without need for much hop charcater, good example of style. Medium carbonation and medium-full body lend a silky and rich mouthfeel with an appropriatly mild crispness. Finishes residual with a spicy cola/caramon flavor and hint of phenol but reatains a respectable drinkability."
"Brought this back from Toronto. Only $1.85 per bottle. Poured a nice dark color, no light passing through. A thick coffee colored head formed but dissipated leaving a nice thin film that left some light lacing. looked the top of an espresso. Nice sweet coffee aroma with hints of bittersweet chocolate. A good bitterness sneaks in first on the palate. A very smooth combination of dark roasted and chocolate malts.A good chocolatey sweetness with a smooth almost silky feel like a milk stout. At 8% I didn't find the alcohol overly present or interfering. A good froth sweetens the brew and brings out a nice bittersweet taste from the roasted barley. I drank this as an after-dinner beer and it was excellent."
"This is a very fine stout in every regard. The taste says that this beer is quite sessionable, but the ABV lets you know otherwise. I will certainly make this one a regular in my fridge - as long as my local liquor store keeps stocking it."
"Side Note: I've tried this with freshly squeezed mango juice, 1 part juice 1 part Lion Stout. The Sri Lankan locals apparently make a cocktail that involves mango juice, passion fruit and Lion Stout, but I haven't a clue where to get passion fruit. Close enough, the result was equally eye opening."
"Overall, a decent stout. It's more subdued than I was expecting, but still nicely done."
"D - This goes down like water and completely masks the abv. It is defintely worth a try."
"D: Dangerously drinkable, i never looked at the ABV until after I drank it and I wold have never guessed 8%"
"I like this one a lot...the ABV is hidden...it's highly drinkable...I could see getting in trouble sucking back about six of these in an hour if I wasn't careful...reminds me a little of Sam Smiths Imperial stout"
"Santé"
"Poured an opaque brown, as expected from a stout, with thick, pillowy tan head and excellent lacing. Aroma was a mixture of chocolate and toffee, all under the malty sweet umbrella. Flavor was very sweet, and most predominantly caramel, with a hint of chocolate. Because the body was fairly thin, the finish was slightly watery, but mostly a smooth aftertaste of sweet malty toffee and choclate. A good Stout."
"Lion Stout pours an opaque black with a thick tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mild, but has notes of chocolate and coffe. The taste also has chocolate and coffe notes. Nice thick mothfeel. An enjoyable stout. I would say it is definitely worth a try."
"This is far better than I expected and probably the best Asian beer I've ever had, and I've had a bunch."
"D - This one goes down way too easy for 8%. Feels a little heavier than it is due to the heavy carbonation."
" I in the end got drunk off of it and Finnegans Irish amber. I really enjoyed every bit off it. As you can See I highly recomend it!!!"
"The taste comes through, though. Nice and chocolaty. Dry baker's chocolate and maybe some coffee come through as well. A medium. Alcohol's not really noticable, and this brew has a nice, full taste. Mouthfeel's a little heavier than average, and carbonation is moderate. Everything comes together pretty well in this brew, and I'm impressed. Tastes about the same as a Rogue Mocha Porter for $2 less per bomber. Horray!"
"Drinkability & Notes  Talk about a big summertime stout, this beer is exactly right for sipping on a warm evening. I am happy that this one seems to have made it to me in good condition, one of the tastier beers from Asia that I have had."
"So what is it about me and coffee? I've never drunk the stuff more than 10 times in my life and each time with more sugar than a Pepsi and half milk. I'm a late comer to beer as well so it's quite peculiar that in concert these two should form the corpus of my favorite brews. I literally want to hug this lion. Both for the 8% alcohol involuntary lovefest and also to squeeze the daylights out of Michael Jackson (the brew guru) and his big mustache who adorn the back label. It also comes in a top-notch case which is as good looking as a hat box. 5 knocking stars and filaments."
"This poured from the bottle labeled ""Sinha Stout"" into the glass a deep almost black with a dark tan head. Smell is clean with some coffee and roasted malt notes. These roasted malts make their way into the flavor, quite pleasant. This is however quite a bitter brew and the roasted malts are very pronounced, this makes it a slow drinking brew, but still a very good one."
"Pours a thick, syrupy midnight black, with 2 fingers of tan coloured head. Aroma of dark chocolate, coffee and some toffee notes. Taste of molasses and sweet prunes, with some chocolate and bitter/burnt coffee to finish. Would like to see it a little less carbonated for a smoother beer and better mouthfeel. It has a bit of acidic/twangy character to it. Overall, a pretty good stout, and one where you don't notice the alcohol."
"The expiry date on the bottle reads July 06, and the name reads ""Sinha stout"". Poured it into a Guinness glass. The colour is black while the head is of a lighter colour. The smell is not noticeable. The bitter chocolate and roast coffee flavours are pronouced. Yet, the beer surprisingly smooth for a its alcohol strength of 8%. The taste of the alcohol is hidden very well and only comes out near the end. The aftertaste is pleasantly bitter without being tangy and flat. I would definately get this one again."
"Would highly recommend if you can find it. For it's price, taste and content it is definatly worth it."
"I had the lager <shudder> now on to the stout. Nice deep cocoa color with a tan head that yeilds some lacing. Smells of a nice blend of roastyness and linger sweet malt but a little too clean. Nice flavoring for a company that makes sucha bad lager. Full robust roasted flavors with a touch of alcohol. Nice decnt stout body, I will visit this again as the $2 price was nice."
"Appearence was dark and rich. The taste and mouthfeel were superb. I was reminded of a Scotch Ale, but much darker with a more coffee and chocolately taste."
"Great mouthfeel; good, thick body with minimal carbonation. Easy to drink, even from this size of bottle. A nice rich export stout. I look forward to having more of this in the future."
"Nevertheless this beer has a rather cordial mouthfeel and although the flavor endurance in my opinion leaves something to be desired, it is nonetheless an enjoyable experience."
"Drinkability: Lots of flavor without going overboard. And wow, this went down extremely quickly. Without the possible Imperial-like cloying or syrupy nature, this goes down pretty easy. It's balanced, flavorful, and doesn't present itself at all even close to 8% ABV. I'll be drinking this again, especially come fall and winter."
"This is a great stout has a lot of body it, great for dessert."
"Im liking this one. The flavors are really subdued, but quite wonderfully blended together. Inconspicuous, but delightful!"
"D: Fantastic stout."
"D: This is my first foreign/export, so I can't rate it with an accuracy in accordance with the style, but as a stout it is definitely enjoyable. Well worth the price."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very creamy and very smooth. The beer is full bodied. The beer hides its alcohol well in the taste. If it wasnt for the metallic aftertaste I would rate this beer much higher. This is a pretty good beer inspite of the metallic aftertaste. I will definately purchase this beer again. If I have future bottles of this without the metallic aftertaste I will re-review this beer."
"Inky black with cordovan highlights. Thick layered head of burnished khaki bubbles of varied size. Slow to settle, leaving some light lacing. Rich coffee dominates the smell along with some sweet notes as well, perhaps a touch of molasses. Sweet white sugar up front with a solid roasty middle that provides a firm backbone. This finishes sweet, in a 'would you like some coffee with your sugar' way with only a hint of roasted bitterness at the last moment. There is also a slightly overt alcohol note as well. Medium body with a soft cushy mouthfeel that contains almost no carbonation, smooth. This was enjoyable, but may have been better showcased with some spicy food rather than on its own."
"Drinkability: The 8% abv and deep stout flavors are little much to continually pound. Overall though, this is a good ale to try."
"Cheers."
"Da solid stout, very warming and filling, drinkable, but three might do it due to the thickness and 8% abv."
"Notes: Not a bad little stout. There are much better out there but this one is by no means a disappointment."
"M&D: although the texture falls a bit thin, the very light body sits in contrast to a semi-strong flavour, and the high alc. content doesn't leave a wee bit trace throughout the drink, making this a very approachable stout. Somehow my impression of this beer is compromised by (unintentional) comparison with stronger and fuller Imperial Russian Stouts, and robust, less sweet and dryer English Stouts. In a sense, interestingly, its texture and flavour remind me more of Sweet/Milk Stouts instead--I mustn't be the only one to speculate that, surely? A nice, but not great, foreign stout worth trying once in a life time."
"I was quite impressed to find a stout that is good cold. I was so afraid that it would kill all the flavor, but it's actually quite enjooyable. Now if I have a craving for a stout in the summer, I know exactly where to reach."
"Near black in colour with slightly higher than average carbonation. Aromatic profile begins with a somewhat pilsner-like sulfur hit before evolving picking up notes of licorice, mild coffee and plum. Its fairly light in the mouth, and has some intriguing yet light flavors of espresso, chocolate, and a bit of caramel. Overall, this is fairly restrained as far as stouts go, but I could see this one being quite nice in the hot weather."
"8% ABV isn't all that noticeable and this is definitely a very drinkable stout. Still, it's not all quite there. Pitted against the Ji-Biru stout from Baird, I'd say this one comes out on top by a slight edge because it's a bit more complex and has a more interesting taste. Enjoy!"
"Checked the other reviews, mine might seem a bit high but I stand by it, this is a damn tasty beer."
"This brew was a pleasant surprise! I picked up a single bottle at New World Beverage in Manhattan for $1.00 out of the cooler. Guess it was not a big seller. It is antstanding export stout. It was not exceptionally dry nor cloying in itssweetness. no hint of alcohol. It has a very molasses like character to quote the missus and enough depth and complexity (coffee and chicory, some dried fruit) to make it exceptionally drinkable. I can't wait to grab some more and study it further. If I can get it at a buck a bottle - woo hoo -so much the better."
"Ya know, if someone would have TOLD me a beer from Sri Lanka would be this amazing, I would have thought there were insane. This is unbelievable! It poured nearly totally black like dirty motor oil with a light brown head. Head was fluffy and pitted for about 45 seconds, but subsided to haze. Nice lace. The smell is very chocolatey. Lots of coffee and lots of roasted malt. Smells like it should be a cake or some sort of chocolate dessert. The taste, too, has an enormous likeness of coffee with plenty of toasted malt. This is simply delicious!! The mouthfeel is very smooth. I feel like I could probably drink three of these in a sitting, but certainly no more than that. If I were to have to guess the abv by simply taste alone with out seeing the bottle, I would probably say 6 and change or so. I'd never guess this was an 8%'er. This is an inconceivably good beer from a third world country like Sri Lanka. I'm truly impressed."
"Prettydrinkable: Makes me think baltic porter. Easily one of the best beers from the southern hemisphere I know of, only a few aussies could challenge"
"330 ml bottle. Lion Stout pours out almost black with a huge, dense, rocky head. The aroma is cocoa, molasses, and grain. The flavor is very chocolatey. Sweet, but not overly sweet. A bit of fruitiness in the middle along with roasted grain. The finish is all chocolate. The mouthfeel is full. Carbonation is too low. This beer could definitely use some more bubbles. Decent drinkability. Despite the flatness, this is a pretty good stout."
"The bottle said Sinha stout, but I am sure this is the same thing as well. Pours extremely dark with a large amount of brown foam that quickly disipates to a thin film. Very little lace left on the glass. Smells ripe with dark cherries, plums, chocolate, rum, mollases, and roasted malts. Flavour is quite balanced. Starts out slightly sweet, with an aftertaste of bitter coffee and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, though. As if someone took a good stout and added a litre of water. Still, an overall decent beer. Not sure if it's a dry or sweet stout. Perhaps a hybrid."
"Wow, it's nice to be back to beer after such a long illness. Pours out to a dark black as night color with a nice big head of tan foam. Very dense. Uniform lace around the interior of the glass. Aromas of roasted malt, cocoa, burning wood and pumpernickel bread. Taste was very quaffable; flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate, even some sweet milky qualities were present. Mouthfeel was good; could've been a touch thicker and heartier, but I can't complain. Good Drinkability. A definite revisit will be inline soon. Recommended."
"Drinability: easy to drink, and a great price, but at 8.0% (which is completely masked), this is definitely not a session beer. Very smooth, however."
"I would drink this again. There's something about the smell I don't care for, but the taste and kick are good."
"D - Quite good. The 8% abv is covered well."
"-UF"
"Pours pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head. Dark and milk chocolates, roasted espresso bean and smoked peat dominate the senses. Mouthfeel is rich and the alcohol is warming. A decadent stout here, quite a surprise out of Sri Lanka, but kudos to Ceylon brewery, Michael Jackson can't be wrong....go ahead, it's there for the taking. No seriously, it's a gimme..."
"beer is best enjoyed on a cold night."
"Viva Lion!"
"Drinkability: A genuinely decent stout, and one of the better foreign stouts I've tasted."
"Drinkability is pretty good overall. More than a couple would quickly be overwhelming to the palate, but I really enjoyed this one!"
"Rich and flavorful; sweetness and roastiness are this brews most delicious characteristics. Highly recommended."
"This was a good stout and my first brew from the Lion Brewery. I did not know what to except but enjoyed it a lot."
"Drinkability- I would love to have a couple of these with in a day. Maybe with a chocolate pecan tortie."
"A beautiful well-crafted beer from Sri Lanka of all places. Multiple layers of flavor with a nice alcohol backbone. South Asias finest beerby a long shot."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a nice medium dark foamy head with quite good retention. Aroma of deep chocolate and roasted malt is clearly detectable and quite enjoyable. Taste is also distinguishable by the high-level of chocolate malt with a nice dose of sweetness. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden. Great foreign stout and even more surprising coming out of Sri Lanka."
"First time I had this, soooo good!! Thick head pours in nice and stays for a while, actually you gotta be careful about pouring too fast. Taste is of roasted malts, a hints of sweetness and quite a bit like unsweetened cocoa powder. Thick mouthfeel but not bad. Definetly not a session beer, but something to be savored and enjoyed."
"Very black in color-great tan head about 1/4 "" high. Moderate aroma-coffee and licorice smells abound. Nice blend of roasted and sweet malt. Flavor is big and bold-roasted malt dominates with espresso and burnt treacle like flavors. Nice underlying sweetness to the whole thing. Good body-slightly viscuous and thick. A very drinkable and enjoyable stout. I had this 2 years or so ago on draft and it was awesome. Well worth seeking out."
"A truly pleasing drink. If you ever have the opportunity to purchase a bottle of this stuff, I heartily recommend it."
"Overall, I find this quite drinkable. Not nearly sweet enough to be cloying, but very nicely balanced and very enjoyable. I got this for $10.99 for a six-pack, and for the value I may be buying again and again. Might be my favorite stout."
"This one pours a solid, deep jet black color. Almost reminds me of roofing tar. There is a huge layer of brown, cappuccino-colored foam that seems to last longer than the beer itself. When I first cracked open the bottle, I caught a wiff of red wine. Maybe that was just the alcohol content. After I pour, I notice an immense smell of chocolate. Sort of like some kind of chocolate/mocha flavored cappuccino. The taste is very good. Roasted and chocolately up front, with just a little bit of a hop kick towards the end. Finishes smooth. It has a slight warming effect at 8.0%. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied, but yet its surprisingly easy to drink. Tasty brew here, definitly a good session beer."
"At 8% ABV, this beer is extremely, dangerously drinkable for the alcohol content. I could easily sit down and have three or four without even thinking about it -- and then fall on the floor when I tried to stand up again. Might be worth it though -- one of my favourite stouts so far!"
"There are no confirmed reports of melanistic (black) lions, either in the wild or captivity (http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/black.html). Well, I found one: this Lion is jet black with a huge, rocky head that lasts forever. Oh, and it had a cat hair in it, but I'll blame that on my new kitten and not the Lion. Smell is surprisingly subdued, with a gentle roasted character. The taste, though, explodes with delicious bitter roastedness that's smooth as can be. Just a hint of plums/raisins. What a great beer. I might move to Sri Lanka."
"This is a great foreign stout. Its a little sweet for my taste but its still way less sweet (and way more complex) than the caribean examples Ive tried. I highly recommend."
"Pours nearly black with a well-kept bubbly tan head. Aroma is sweet, cocoa and plum. Flavor is again sweet, but lacks a serious malt profile that is warranted for an 8% ABV stout. Where's the beef? Tastes good enough and is a fairly easy drinker, but lacks complexity and anything to balance the chocolate sweetness and the mildly warming alcohol effect. Though it's full bodied, I expected something with a heartier flavor profile. Despite the bubbly head, carbonation on the palate is quite low. Still, not too shabby, especially if you truly dig stouts."
"Drinkability: Very solid. Nothing over the top but very well done. Just a touch of alcohol on the palate which deserves respect. A nice one to enjoy the cooler weather with. Recommended."
"This brew pours an opaque black color with a huge tan head. The lacing is thorough, and lasts forever. The aroma is of cracker, cream, and is slighly nutty, but not vrey strong. The taste very enjoyable. Creamy, and slightly nutty with some bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a solid brew."
"I imagine Lion Stout is the pride of Sri Lanka. It's an incredibly flavorful beer whose singular, exotic deliciousness impresses me to no end. In fact, it's one of the best foreign/export stouts (that are actually foreign) that I've ever had."
"Black with ruby highlights and a tan head. Plenty of fine lacing was left behind as the foam subsided a bit. Malty aroma, with lots of chocolatey sweetness and light roasted coffee. Light bitterness with a strong sweetness. A bit of dark malt character, but not as much as I expected. It finishes a little acidic with just a hint of dry, grainy astringency. The carbonation is well integrated, with fine bubbles supporting the body somewhat. Not bad at all, though the flavour doesn't quite pull through like the aroma does."
"Overall, a pretty good beer."
"D: No harsh bite for the beginner, but enough flavour for the geek. The alcohol could certainly be trouble!"
"Bottle obtained from Liquor Mart (Colorado) and consumed the next evening. Pours a four finger fluffy clingy cavernous caramel-brown colored head over a pitch black liquid. Smells of chocolate, sour black malt, toffee and caramel. Coffee roast only with searching. Tastes smooth silky milk chocolate that persists through and dries a touch in the finale. Soured black malt makes it's presence known in diametric oposition to the chocolate. Coffee modifies the sour and a toffee sweet keeps it from ruining the beer entirely. The aftertaste has a bit of alcohol sting rising up the back of the throat. Hop flavor is missing amid the mix of strong dark flavors...perhaps some cottony fuggles. Any hop bitter is buried beneath the sour and alcohol. Mouthfeel is only medium and carbonation is moderate. The overfoaming head hurts this beer's appearance. Near the end of the bottle, the alcohol became more prevalent in the aftertaste detracting from the drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth, creamy but quite interesting. Definitely creamy. As a result, drinkability is impressive. Although I wouldn't drink it all night, but it's a nice stout overall."
"Poured pitch black with a huge bronze head. Soem carbonation. Nose was big on roasted malts, some black licorice. Taste was to the sweet side. Again, black licorice was dominant. Nice malts. Very smooth, light bodied...a little too light bodied i would have to say. Lingering sweetness...a touch of raisin off the finish. Alcohol warmth. As far as a stout goes, i was looking for a little more body and fullness. Drinkable but not where i might want a stout to be."
"Drinkability- A fine stout. Nothing out of this world, but still a very good one worth trying. Heck for $1.75 it's worth buying a few."
"330ml bottle: poured a pitch black with a gorgeous mocha puffy cap. Moderate carbonation for a bottle conditioned ale. Nose recalls coffee, dried fruits, toasted caramel sweetness and grassy hops. Full bodied, rich, and silky mouth feel. What a wonderful mix of flavors..all very mellow and not sharp or over bearing: cocoa, chickory, dates, musty apple, slightly charred toast...all kept in balance with lashings of lemon grass acidity from the hops and a soft drying charred finish that is totally in balance with sweet caramel tones...the finish is the mellowest, evenly balanced I have ever tasted in a stout...this is a world class stout and probably the best foreign stout available in bottles. Smooth, well rounded and very drinkable for a stout."
"I can definitely see another in the future, just not tonight. The drinkability is hindered by its ABV (for me at least)."
"This beer come highly reccomended! An amazing joy to drink!"
"Overall: Heard a lot about this one, for whatever reason it seems to have rather the cult following. That is usually a sign of image over substance, but this really is not that bad actually, Im almost torn to admit that I really quite like it, not sure why, but for $1.69 it aint all that bad."
"poured a deoop brown, almost opaque color with slight off-white head. The smeel is absolutely fantastic, a mixture of roasted grains, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, ripe fruit, and prunes. I don't think I have ever experienced this complex a smell. Taste is dry and bitter, with roasted grains and chocolate at the top. Mouth feel is a slightly bitter. An excellent beer."
"Bottle picked up at the Foodery in May. WIll compare to that now coming i to Toronto. Nice head with bubbles in foam. Malty sweet, vanila, milk, good hops. Very drinkable and serviceable stout. This would be a standard beer for me if always available, which reflects that big stouts get higher ratings on complexity and thickness, but this is nice. Second bottle a few days later."
"Pours a deep black, some dark red shows at the edges, big tan head, some lace. Smells like bitter roast, grass, some skunkiness is detectable? Wow, coffee and cream, little yeasty and sour, pretty roast. How the hell is this beer so smooth? The 8% doesn't show at all, insanely smooth and creamy, very slick mouthfeel. Excellent."
"Overall, this is a very solid and drinkable stout."
"Pours a decent opaque dark brown, with plenty of foam some cascading carbonation. Smell is toasty malts with some cocoa and coffee thrown in. Taste is malty sweet, with some chocolate and coffee again up front. Finish is a bit rough for me though. The beer starts off rather sweet and then ends up just a shade unpleasant. The bitterness is quite mild. Mouthfeel could be much fuller for this beer especially at this sweetness level. The 8% ABV is well hidden, but I couldn't drink more than a bomber at a time."
"Solid stout that reminds me a little of Mackeson's XXX, but a little less complex. Still for an 8% brew ...there's NO hint of that kind of strength. Other than MJ's strange endorsement (when he himself just called it ""surprisingly good"") it's a winner."
"Pours a somewhat translucent dark black color with a large and foam dark tan head. Smells of bitter roasty malts, chocolate and coffee, and a somewhat metallic smell is present as well. Taste is sweet and chocolatey with an alcohol presence. Very smooth, and somewhat acidic, but not in a real bitter way. Mouthfeel is smooth and on the thinner side, no a thick brew by any means. Drinkability is very good for an 8% brew."
"It has a medium body, which is creamy in texture and very smooth. There is zero indication of the 8%, it would make a fine sessionable brew. Tame, but enjoyable."
"Drinkable? Definitely, especially for the slightly high alcohol. Not extremely complex, but worth having again as a standby."
"I picked up a few bottles for $2.99 a piece at Huckleberry's in Ypsilanti. According to the owner this one might be hard to find in the future as the well this brewery uses became contaminated in the wake of the tsunami disaster. I hope that's just a rumor because this is a killer brew."
"Poured from a 625ml bottle purchased at Whole Foods in Arlington, VA. I've been looking for this beer for quite a long time without much success and I finally found it. It did not disappoint. I must confess that the sheer fact that this is from Sri Lanka, an area not really known for its brewing prowess, earned this beer a few sentimentality points in my book, but it can definitely stand on its own. Pours jet black with a nice khaki tan head. Smell is a touch on the sour side, with some sour cherries present. Taste is slightly sweet up front, with cherries, prunes, unsweetened bakers chocolate and alcohol in the body. Not quite as complex as I imagined but still one of the more interesting stouts I've had. Definitely a departure from your everyday stout. Its 8% ABV is well blended, making for a deceptively drinkable brew. I will definitely buy more of this."
"330 ml bottle, bought at Selfridges, London. Label says for some reason ""Lion Dark Beer"" in stead of ""Lion Stout", but theres no doubt that this is the very same beer. Otherwise the label is exactly the same, so is the ABV and the characteristics of the beer. Pitch black colour, impenetrable for light. Large and thick brown head. A real beauty! Excellent aroma of various types of wood, tar, leather, tobacco. Full and rich flavour where the roastiness and hops are perfectly balanced with the velvety sweetness. Extremely drinkable. Its debatable whether ""the perfect stout"" exists, but the Lion must be pretty close!"
"Overall a good ballsy stout that's not shy. I wonder if this is available on tap? I was hoping for a more creamy texture, but maybe this bottle was a little old (?). I would buy this again."
"This is a solid Foreign Stout and certainly one worth checking out if you dig stouts."
"Pours a very dark reddish black color and has a huge, rocky, tan head. The aroma is very sweet and coffee like. It smells like a Starbuck's Frappachino. The taste is very full and smooth... lot's of coffee, chocolate and peat to tantalize your tongue. This is a very balanced stout, on par with a Sam Adam's Cream Stout. The only thing that hold it back is it's price. There are equal or better stouts for less than $9 a six pack."
"Dark black with a nice espresso head of foam. Nice lacing as well. Cocoa comes through hard in the aroma of this brew, caramel does as well to a lesser extent, as well as roasted malts and a bit of wood. Taste is chalky, smoky, chocolaty, and roasty with a nice dry dinish that is also slightly acidic and somewhat lactic. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and nice, but a bit light. Drinkability remains very good."
"Poured into a tulip glass, served at cellar temperatures. Medium light tan head with little retention. Opaque black color. Alcohol is slightly apparent in the aroma, as is a roasty espresso smell. The taste is very port-like, with a slight chocolate-covered dark fruitiness, maybe raspberry or raisins. A nice dry, roasty, coffee bitterness peeks through, then yields to some residual sweetness in the aftertaste. Drinkability is very smooth, particularly for such a large alcohol. Not one of the greatest beers in the world, in my opinion, but certainly not overrated. Quite delicious."
"Poured a very dark brown with hints of red around the edges of the glass. A nice foamy tan head stuck around for quite a while and left nice clumps of lacing along the sides of the glass. The smell was of dark malts and dark chocolate. The taste wsa pretty good with hints of licorice, caramel, and fresh roasted coffee. The mothfeel was nice and creamy, and rather smooth too. I could drink these all night, too bad I only picked up one bottle of this."
"Pours black with a nice creamy brown head that leaves good lacing in my glass, roasty, fruity malty aromas. Taste like plums, chocolate and smoke, medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel, finishes a bit sweet, alcohol comes through as it warms, not as good as I was expecting but still a good stout."
"12 ouncer sampled, no freshness dating. Pours black, little light shining through the edges. Dark tan head, any lacing sliding down the side of the glass. Nose is funky, and of burnt malt. Taste is a bit on the thin side, just a hint of burnt malt, some chocolate and drying hops. Alcohol is on the hot side and a bit up front. Decent product, but other stouts come to mind to try next time."
"Michael Jackson has quotes on the bottle label that describes many aspects of this beer pretty well. Flavor was consistent throughout the drink, i.e. temperature didn't enhance the quality of the taste."
"Pours a very dark color with a tall head that has nice retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is of chocolate with a little bit of fruit and roasted malts thrown in. The flavor is much the same - chocolate, little roasted and a hint of raisin. Moderate body and slightly creamy. Drinks really easily for the alcohol level."
"This beer pours a black color with a finger of tan head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is really full of chocolate with hints of raisin in there as well. The taste is really chocolatey, slightly raisiny flavor on the start that mellows totally to a chocolate finish. Nice. The feel is moderate to thick. Just where I expect things for this beer. Drinkability is fine and dandy for a 8% beer. I would not expect a beer like this to come from a country like Sri Lanka."
"Tastes of sweet, dry chocolate with a cardboard edge. Smoky, peaty flavors chime in, and then fade, as roasty coffee bitterness takes over and lasts into the finish. Big bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Not badespecially for the price and place of origin."
"Appearance: A deep dark brown color with a full, foamy, tan head (low retention. Aroma is dull and muted: Roasty and chocolaty with a light hop presence. Metallic notes. Flavor: sweet start with a dominant roasted taste, chocolaty, and a lightly dry and metallic finish. Palate: medium bodied and creamy with low co2. This beer seems to have under utilized the assets of the ingredients. Not a bad beer, but not well balanced and not memorable."
"The head on this thing is like a root beer float. Nice and sticky with heavy lacing down the entire glass. It came on really strong, but seemed to disperse pretty quickly. The aroma is very nice with a heavy chocolate and small traces of anise. The smell is much sweeter that the taste. The roasted, coffeeness really comes out strong. The high ABV is pretty well hidden in the background, but it clinges to the throat a little. Definately a nice stout with some heartyness to it and clearly one of the best example of great lacing. This is a fine beverage to sip on a cold fall night."
"Though I liked this beer, it wasn't the end-all, be-all of my stout beer experience. Smells and tastes of roasted coffee malts with a bit of chocolatey goodness on top. A tiny bit of left-in-the-coffee-pot-too-long burn smell and taste going on though. Barely detectable alcohol subterfuge going on here, you'll notice the punch more in your forebrain later than on your tongue. Slightly chewy and very smooth, a good drinkable beer, puts Sri Lanka on the map for sure. Got me on the Mothership, but didn't take me to Funkytown."
"nicely drinkable. an excellent example of a foreign stout. i highly recommend this one."
"BE LIKE MIKE!!"
"Pours an opaque deep brown, almost black color with a fluffy tan head. Scorchy dark malt aromas with complements of chocolate and black licorice, some subtle hops and a slight yeastiness to the nose. Roasty graininess is upfront, strangely enough- it goes somewhat watery mid-palate and finishes with a slight fruitiness, and more dryness from roasted grain and light hopping. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, letting the drinker know this beer is not a domesticated brew. 8.0% ABV is hidden well under the shroud of roasted malts, other than some warming sensations to the esophagus and stomach. It's been a while since I had one, but I seem to remember liking it more on-draught."
"Poured a pitch black color, dark tan head, not a whole lot fo lacing on the way down. Smell is of slight coffee and alcohol hints. Taste is too much alcohol, not enough stout, too much carbonation. Not a rich enough body to support the other flavors. There are better stouts, including ones that don't get Michael Jackson to pimp their beer."
"Damn tasty, whatever you call it...I call it a Baltic Porter. I really enjoyed this. Forget the hype and bias and just drink it up. Very easy to drink with a tight body and the brains to back it up. Paired nicely with the 9-grain bread I just made. A wonderful stout and cheaper that Sinebrychoff or D.Carnegie & Co. Highly recommended and an exceptional brew for the price!"
"This is a very nice stout. It's not great, but at $ 7.99/6 Pack it might become a regular around the house."
"Wyll-"
"What a surprise! For $3.00 USD for a 22 oz. bottle, this beer is a steal, especially considering its smooth complexity. Very easy to drinkability and balanced to say the least."
"Virtually jet black. Mountainous, stiff, dogged, light bister head yields lace. Notions of dark chocolate covered prune and singed molasses candy upfront in aroma. Wafts of burnt barley and dark lovibond caramel are secondary. In flavor, incipient is a soft, milky note of light roast coffee mocha. Sharper notes of raisin and bitter chocolate ensue mid palate along with sweeter tones of treacle and burnt brownie. Roasted grain along with moderate hop bitterness fully dry the profile, especially considering the high attenuation. Dangerously, this is almost thirst quenching. Softens again late, with ashen milk chocolate hints yielding to the pleasantly warm, cleanly burnt finish. A well crafted, nearly spot on export stout. Lacks the ""beefy"" character of US microbrewed stouts of the same alcohol content, but agreeably so in that regard. Dry and satiating. Excellent drinkability. Thanks to Bighuge for this one."
"The beer after divorcing the 12 ounce brown bottle its resides in its chalice a piceous color with a meaningful chocolate head, the texture creamy and after decomposing the resultant lace a brown drape to cover the glass. Nose is heavy with toasted grain, sweet like over ripe fruit, hint of coffee, pleasant to sniff; start is rich in roasted grain, quite sweet with the top middling in feel to the palate. Finish is light in carbonation, the hops mild but noticeable, very dry with a sweet and long lasting aftertaste, quite a nice stout."
"Pours out opaque and black, with a firm cream head, lots of sticky lace. The aroma is light toasted coffee, slightly pungent. Initial taste is caramel, sweet malt, unsweetened dark chocolate and coffee over prune and molassses. Mouthfeel is gentle carbonation, dry astringent esters. Finish is dry, leaving a metallic taste on the tongue. After all the hoopla I was expecting more complexity. No where near the quality of Stone's Imperial Russian Stout. Very much a run-of-the-mill stout."
"Pours with a two-finger light brown head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Totally black color. Good carbonation. Nose is coffee/caramel. Strong coffee/carmel flavor, nice, sweet, beefy stout. $6.49 for a 6-pack of 330ml bottles from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Fully ebon hue, rich, tan hand, thick and rocky...good looking stout, so far. Nose, soft and creamy, with notes of nuts and cocoa. Taste is smooth at first, but fills the mouth well. Huge malts, caramelly, thick and nearly chewy, very full bodied. Perfect integration, wonderful balance, sweet and tasty, but never too, with a delicate fruitiness, just underneath. The ABV peeks in just a bit, but doesn't mar the enjoyment of what's nearly a perfect stout! Beats the hell out of Guinness, but gets me yearning for an Expedition. Hearty and proud as it's namesake, Lion is a stout fit for a king. Lightly spicy in the end, nutty, and never-ending tastiness."
"This was part of a ""Beers around the World"" sampler, and was by far the best of the bunch."
"Almost black. Thin light brown head. Bubbly collar leaves some adequate lace. Aroma reminds me of a charcoal barbecue. There's also some nice milky notes and blackened malts and coffee. Really nice nose. Flavor's got some nice bitter roasted notes to it. A little chocolatey. Dry. Vanilla bean. Sweet lactic sugars add a bit of a ""baltic porter"" feel to this stout. I like it. The body is medium-full. Lightly carbonated and easy down the chute. Good stuff."
"Black body does allow a little bit of light through the extreme edge. The dark tan head is like a froth of chocolate milk. Toast, chocolate, caramel and plums are in the aroma. The same follows into the flavor with the addition of a little char in the back. Very tasty stout that really doesnt taste as strong as it actually is."
"Dark fudge brown, nearly black, thin and firm light brown cap, a slight skim remains once it settles, lacing in thin sheets. Aroma of slight roast, stale raisin, parched prunes, dry cocoa, and anise. Taste is mild with tame roastability and soft chocolate, slight floating sweetness of dry dark fruits, touches of molasses and toffee roast. Doesn't withstand too much in the flavor dept. or in its length, over far to quickly, but it does incur a certain broad range of capable character. Feel is smooth, a bit sweet and tangy, lightly roasted edge, just shy of a medium body mostly, seems to pick up a bit towards the finish where it drys out with some light cocoa. A fairly decent effort; quick stout flavors and a somewhat healthy body, but could be better. I would consider this over a Guinness on nitro-tap I think?"
"A very enjoyable stout, and one I'd been looking forward to trying, and I'm glad I did. Nice and rich, and though I don't think I could pound these all day, a couple of these are worthwhile."
"A 12-ounce bottle served in a LaTrappe goblet that poured thick and completely opaque, leaving a somewhat thin, but beatiful dense layer of foam that stayed put for several minutes. I think to myself that this is going to a dense stout. I am right. The aroma is of heavy with cocoa and espresso. The first sip is sweet and smooth, with cocoa and/or dark chocolate up front, followed by more cocoa notes laced with bitter espresso. There's more bitterness mixed with dark rum flavors towards the finish which is long and warming. Nice lacework is left on the sides of my glass as I continue to sip this beer. The carbonaton is a bit high and detracts a bit from the quality of this beer, but overall an excellent, potent stout that is sweet without being too sweet."
"Lion Stout: from Sri Lanka. In a 22 ounce bomber bottle. Pours a deep black, but a great garnet color shows up when held up to a strong light. Great thick coffee and cream head, very rocky and extremely long lasting. Aroma is sweet, like a mocha espresso. Great taste, fairly complex, leaning definitely toward the sweet side of things, to say the least. Some flavors from the coffe family as well, and some roasted malts flavors are notable as well. I think I'm beginning to understand warm weather stouts: thick, sweet and cool, and nowhere near as heavy as cake or the like. Nice, and well worth picking it up."
"Pours a dark black with HUGE tan head that's real chunky. Laces glass real well, it looks amazing. Smells of coffee, chocolates, and alcohol. Nose is pretty big. Tastes of big roasted malts that leads to a nice alochol warming, but finish stops pretty quick with no real lingering alcohol you get in most big stouts. Tastes noted include: bitter chocolates, coffee, and fruits. Nice dry finish that makes this a very drinkable stout. Moderate carbonation with nice warming quality to it. Great beer can't drink a lot of them, but this is a nice last beer before bed kinda thing. Great brew, will have again and again."
"Dark, almost opaque. Nice head of foam, a rocky and mouse-like medium tan. Laces in fat garlands. Pale dry cocoa aroma, some carob and nutiness. Pleasant mouthfeel, very creamy. Sweet caramels, light butteriness, malted milk dominates the flavor profile. Finishes similarly, without a hard roast or hop bittering to the second half. Little sense of the 8.0% ABV stated on the bottle. M.J. says this beer is ""tarry"" -- not to me, and it could use some for balance. Very drinkable and agreeable, uncomplicated, perhaps a touch too sweet overall."
"Long love beer!"
"This stout is so dark brown it is almost inky black and light will not pass thru it and it has a brown to light brown head. The smell of sweet roated malts beckons to you from the glass. I expected more roasted flavor but the taste is a well rounded smooth sweetness and roasted malt together. A nice easy drinking stout."
"Outstandin appearance...almost black...rich creamy head and outstanding lacing...real eye candy. Nice rich aroma with roasted notes and light malt presence. I picked up a light coffee flavor that was nicely mild considering the brew's strength. Initially sweet, it branched into a start tartness at mid-palate and ended with a light bitterness and dry finish. Mouthfeel was full-bodied, but smooth. Easy on the drinkability side, especially at 8 abv. Definite recommendation."
"A big, full body is the package for the abundance of flavors and aromas that take this beer to another level. Perfect carbonation makes its easy to drink, and allows you to wade through the ocean of flavors presented. A high-quality brew that stands out from most competition. Drink at cellar temperature for best results."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, it has a high ABV, yet hides it extremely well and has a lot of character. Good stuff."
"Drinkability is fairly high, very nice beer."
"This is a very good beer. It looks like it should in the glass. Dark with a nice head. It has a hint of chocolate in its aroma. Goes down smooth. Who knew that a damn fine beer could come out of Sri Lanka. I think this has to be one of my favorite stouts."
"Pours a pitch black with a reddish tint near the bottem of the glass with a slight brown head,aroma is of burnt fruit and bitter chocolate.Very intense flavors in this one burnt fruit and bitter sweet chocolate with some nice earthiness in the finish.I really like this stout very intense flavors a nice one to savor in my opinion."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Lion Stout is a worthy concoction. Thoroughly enjoyable and English in character. Deserving of its praise."
"Pretty nice. Quite rich, chocolatey, fruity nose. Taste of caramelised sugar (which i didn't particlarly like), then some dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, and bitter roastyness. Pretty famous in beer circles, and hard to belive its from Sri Lanka, i'm happy i finally had it."
"I loved the look of this. Pitch black with a beige colored head that came large and stayed at medium size for awhile. Smelled of strong semi-sweet chocolate chips and a hint of alcohol. Taste of roasted malts and intense chocolate (like a mochachino). Only problem is that the flavor is withdrawn and doesn't fully show itself. There's also a sourness in the beer that seems like it shouldn't be there. Is that supposed to be the hops? Is it some astringency from the grains. I don't know, but I do know that it mixes with the chocolate and creates an off flavor. Body is medium to weak in thickness. Could be much better than it is."
"This stout poured an opaque black color with light brown foam. The smell was malty, but not overly strong. The taste was rather sweet and malty. A bit of roasted malt flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with low carbonation feel. The body was medium. The drinkability was OK."
"This stout came in a 625ml bottle, reasonably priced at $2.69. Poured a jet black with a large tannish head that had good retention. The aroma was sweet with malt, smelling like dark fruits and a hint of alcohol. The same was evident in the forefront of the taste, with the finish featuring a slight hop bitterness with chocolate malt flavors also coming through. The mouthfeel was light, a little bit watery, definetely not as thick as some of the stouts I have most enjoyed. I can't say that I was let down, but after seeing Micheal Jackson's endorsement on the back, I did expect a little more. Overall not bad, but not the best."
"Pours midnight black with a rich caramel colored head. Aromas of semi-sweet chocolate and mocca. The smell carries through to the taste promissing a semi-sweet chocolate but finishing with a bitter coffee flavor. There is a mild hoppiness throughout The head lasted quite a while. The beer finishes smooth. A very nice stout."
"Huge light brown head that lasts. Aroma is a palate of impressions. Sweet roastyness is the dominant impression, but coffee comes to mind as well. Flavour is very coffeeish and roasty. Pleasant bitterness imediately on the tongue and palate. Alcohol is nicely hidden. Both nose and flavor are full with chocolate and over ripe plums. A slight hoppiness seems to flow through near the finish.Excellent brew! Not a bad effort."
"Black body with mahogany highlights topped by a dark tan head. Sweet roasted malt aroma. Some nice dark fruits and a touch of hops spiciness as well. The sweet, roasted malt continues into the taste, with a noticeable alcohol note as well. Just a hint of chocolate as well. The aftertaste is like a bite of a sweet plum followed by a cup of coffee. Maybe it's a jelly donut followed with a coffee chaser. In any event, it's good. The mouthfeel is robust and smooth, having a bit of a creaminess to it. The drikability is good as well, even as the slight tobacco juice note starts appearing towards the end of the glass. A beer that I should have tried sooner."
"stout, but the flavor misses the mark for me - although I do prefer dry rather than sweet stouts in general. Not bad."
"Liquorish with a dark chocolate hue. A deep heavy malt is at once, creamy and sweet. Lacking any real hop aroma the surprise is the full bitter hop bite. Heavy and flavorful chocolate and coffee notes blend in well. Tricky alcochol is certainly there, but hardly noticeable. The creamy head fades quickly."
"I'd often seen this beer and ignored it because of its corny label. Have to say I'm happily surprised."
"I really like this stout. I would consider this to be my favorite sweet stout (I do not like overly sweet beer). Pours a little thinner and more carbonated than a lot of stouts, with a nice foamy head (some retention). Very dark, almost black. Smells sweet and roasty. I plan to try this in a taste test with Samuel Smith (my favorite stout), which has the best balance of malt and hops of any stout I've had. Not much hop bitterness evident here. Real smooth for it's strength (8% ABV), will sneak up on you fast. As I said, I've had this beer several times, and have always enjoyed it. Nothing leaps out at you, but it is as easy to drink as any stout I've had, and will put a glow on you in a hurry!"
"Next."
"Drinkability: Give me another! Drink! Drink! Drink!"
"This is one of those beers that are just classic. I love it, possibly my favorite all around stout that I have tasted. It really is amazing, hell, even Michael Jackson endorses this one, but then again his opinion is just that another opinion. The Lion Stout pours a very dark opaque tone of deep blackish brown with hints of ruby at the edges when held to the light. The head that complements the body is an incredible milk chocolate hue of brown head, and leaves a sturdy even lace down my imperial pint. The aroma is saturated with dark malts especially the chocolate roasts. Very well done, and the flavor of this brew contains the perfect combination of sweet creamy chocolate, full of coffee roasts, and a smooth dryness that mellows the finish so nicely. With the medium light body and the creamy mouthfeel to each sip, this beer is so drinkable that besides the ABV there is no reason why it shouldn't deserve a five. Quite the impressive work of art straight from who would have thought Sri Lanka. MJ make some room cause this BA would like to sign his seal of approval on the Lion Stout."
"Poured a soapy like head that thickened up to a solid chocolate colored foam.Left rings of sticky brown lace even before the first sip.Consistency poured of oil that gulped.Aroma was of smoke,coffee,and chocolate.Very creamy,but not very crisp on the mouthfeel.Mouthfeel wasnt too impressive,and wasnt almost watery.Alcohol taste is present and noticed.Leaves a dry bitter after taste that stays in the back of the throat.A very good stout but not the best.Overall average."
"A very quick developing head, colored like a frappacino sits easily on top of a very very dark dark maroon/black colored almost wine smelling bier. The first sip delivers chocolate and mellow hops. Its almost syrupy constitution lends itself well to the smell, they work very well together. If the taste could develop more of an after taste or carry the flavor further along the tongue it would be an outstanding beer. The alcohol volume is not readily tasted, but comes across in the wine like smell."
"First off, let me say that this stout delivered much more than I was expecting. It's very unique, enjoyable, and highly drinkable. It pours an opaque black body with no visible highlights, topped by a full, very creamy light tan head that holds quite well and leaves really nice, full lace. The aroma is fruity, cocoaish, and mildly chocolatey. The body is medium with a very fine and gentle carbonation that leaves it quite smooth and creamy in the mouth. The taste starts fruity, becomes sweetly chocolatey, and finishes with a light, almost smoky roastiness and lingering softly sweet notes of chocolate and caramel. Very mocha! The dark malts lend a light acidity which accentuates the fruitiness and helps to balance the malt. It never becomes cloying. The well balanced bitterness is subtle, and it relies on the roastiness and light acidity to help balance the sweet malts. Although it's probably not the best beer for a night out with the lads, it makes a great appertif, dessert beer, or nightcap. Well worth trying."
"Pours a super dark brown/black with only the slightest of light getting around the edges and a nice brown head.  The nose has a lot of sweet malt and chocolate aromas along with some slightly alcoholic notes.  The taste starts off with some huge sweet chocolatey notes and some slightly biscuity malt.  As the brew progresses there is a slightly earthy/smoky taste that emeges as the brew finishes.  There is a nice creamy quality to this beer that makes it nice and smooth and rather drinkable.  I'm not sure if this one deserves the attention that it gets from Michael Jackson but it is a nice stout that makes a great desert brew with its sweetness."
"Milk-chocolate colored head that sticks to the glass. Deep spicy, exotic aromas of incense, chocolate, allspice and raspberry reduction. Sweet alcohol flavor drives notes of coffee, cane and grape. Good, mild, balancing bitterness on the medium-long finish. A decent stout to drink. Much better if you just smell it though."
"    My only complaint would be the somewhat fizzy carbonation,but that again is noticed because of comparison to other stouts.I will definitely be having more of this.With cooler weather coming, I may have to stock some."
"Thing & black with a stable beige head.  Smell has notes of roasted malts and sweetness.  Smooth, soft mouthfeel, very creamy.  For the most part, a very good beer.  I swear, however, that my bottle had a small metalic-tasting flaw.  Still, the beer has great balance.  Very tasty.  This is the first beer I've had from Sri Lanka."
"Not as complex as I thought it would be but that is finish being that a brew with such strength can be so drinkable. I’ll going back to this beer for sure."
"Sweet, fruity nose with hints of burnt malts.  Many flavors present that all mesh quite well.  Chocolate/cocoa, raisins/plums.  It's light bodied for its complexity and strength and drinks quite well.  I think my package store did me a favor by aging it for me(it was 4 months past its ""exp."" date)."
"Creamy aroma, yet with some smokey hints.  Big, bubbly tan head.  Slightly sweet beginning, fruity yeast flavor.  Smooth drinking."
"I was underwhelmed with this beer. I was expecting more. Its got strong hints of chocolate and smells slightly burnt. It's thinner than it looks but still have a good feel. An ok beer but I wouldn't make it a habit."
"$2.99 for a big bottleconditioned 625ml bottle was not much to pay at all! This stuff is great. Overall a superb stout, IMHO...."
"As a fan of full bodied stouts this beer didn't impress me as much as it's reputation in the beer publications indicated it would. I felt it was on the dry Irish stout side but without the creamy head and roasted malt flavors. Bitter roasted barley, but not much malt backbone left me wanting more and not getting it."
"Beer from Sri Lanka, eh? I'm game. This is a solid, sweetish stout with a rocky, fragrant head and a nice oiliness to it (from the hops maybe?). Different enough from other brews to make it interesting, although slicker than perhaps the very best stouts. Milky, juicy, with what I imagined as a rummy, sugar-cane undercoat. I thought it very drinkable. Perhaps not worth a trip to Ceylon, but definitely worth picking up out if you find it in your local store (as I did). Bottle had a drink-by date of September this year (bought it in February)."
"Notes: Over-promoted by Michael Jackson and over-hyped in general. A pretty average sweet stout that has potential to be something better, but it never gets there. It sits somewhere between a dry Irish stout and typical sweet stout, leaning a bit too much towards the dry with its flat, one dimensional malt profile. Still at least worth a try for all of you stout lovers out there."
"For me, this stout fits exactly in the middle of the two extremes. Namely dry and milk/sweet stouts. It has both a dryness and a sweetness. It has a creamy texture that is not cloying. Lion Stout would be by far the best stout to ever cross my lips provided Guiness had never existed. Cheers!"
