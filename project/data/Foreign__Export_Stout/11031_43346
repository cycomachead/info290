4.17,7.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Picked this up at the Brouwerij De Molen beer store. Dark brown, almost black pour that turned into a total gusher when I opened it. Had this happen in the past with De Molen beers so I was somewhat prepared and saved most of it. For all that foam and head, it didn't last long at all and had minimal lacing. Huge roasty nose with a ton of coffee along with hints of cocoa, espresso, and just a touch of hops and black licorice. The taste follows suit with loads of coffee and chocolate with hints of tobacco, soy sauce, and a bit of caramel and toffee. The mouthfeel leaned more towards a Porter than a stout and was slightly fizzy. The finish was extra dry with a nice bitter hop bite. The alcohol was totally hidden making this extremely drinkable. Another great beer from De Molen!","beerdrifter","Feb 29, 2012"

Really not a lot of stout characteristics. Big dark fruits, booze, roasted malts on the backend with perhaps some coffee. This tasted like a nice blend of a quad and a stout. Very interesting and enjoyable. Medium body, carbonated well. Hints of booze. I liked this. Not what I was expecting but a welcomed mix. Unlike any stout I've had before.","russwbeck","Sep 12, 2011"

3.74,-3.9,3,4,4,3,3.5,"OVERALL: Another good De Molen brew. This is kind of a touchstone for their stout beer, as it is a tasty and aromatic beer, but would need a heavier, thicker palate to really get the flavors over the hump. A tighter head would also help the scores. That said, I enjoyed this one very much. If you’re interested in the brewery, this would be a stout to check out. If you enjoy it, then their barrel aged and smaller batch stuff would be well worth tracking down. A good beer that I’ve had before and will have again. Recommended.","Jeffo","Aug 16, 2011"

3.83,-1.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Bottle #478: This beer was said to be a rarity when I saw it on the menu at the Bethlehem Speakeasy. I figured that I must try it then since I'm easily persuaded into things like this. The bottle was split between a friend and myself that night. The pour was nice. It gave of a deep black color with a creamy brown looking head that stuck around for a little while. The smell of the beer had some very heavy burnt aromas coming off of it. There was a booze aroma too that was also there. The taste of the bee was very dry and gave off plenty of burnt toast flavors mixed with some rich dark chocolate. The mouthfeel was lighter than I expected a "Triple Stout" to be... Overall I found the beer to be pretty good, I'd say if you have the money on hand give it a try but if not, you're really not missing out on too much. It was nice to try but I wouldn't have to purchase it again.","Knapp85","Jul 24, 2011"
4.02,3.3,4,4.5,4,3,4,"O: Really an enjoyable beer, minus the thin/overcarbonated mouthfeel. I love lots of coffee in a beer, and this definitely delivers. I will have to grab another bottle the next time I see some. Nice beer.","pokesbeerdude","Jul 12, 2011"

The aforementioned chocolate gives a nice cocoa sweetness followed by a burnt toast flavor. Then the ash. Oh man this is an ashy beer. And the alcohol is still quite prominent. It's a bit harsh and the very light body doesn't really help IMO. It's a two dimensional beer: a couple of flavors + alcohol. Good, but not great.","DmanGTR","Jun 11, 2011"

I did remove some of the more trivial observations from my initial review, as well as keeping in some of the more extreme (and perhaps exaggerated) observations... Basically, this beer exhibits much of the same characteristics as their other dark beers - which is great, as I love them - however, despite it's abv and ostensibly fuller/sweeter constitution, this beer doesn't dazzle and it could very well be attributed to poor handling and/or staling oxidation. If you do happen to find a bottle, serve it at cellar temp, and go from there.","Bouleboubier","May 12, 2011"

I’m stoked that I got the chance to try this, and I’m looking forward to sharing a bottle with friends sometime in the near future, as this beer is smooth enough that, in my opinion, even non-beer geeks would be able to enjoy it.","COBeerBuff","Mar 19, 2011"
