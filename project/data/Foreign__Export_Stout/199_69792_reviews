"This beer, whether you like it or not, is true artistry and owning to it's uniqueness truly peerless."
"Limited Release INda Style Export Stout... Fantastic.  Best beer in a long time."
""
""
""
"Wasted money on this one. I respect Ballast Point a lot. It's a shame they churned out garbage like this."
""
""
"Smells really unique. Good flavor. I like experimentation when it pays off, and I think it does here"
""
""
""
"Damn, that's just not right..."
"Wow! What an interesting beer! The coconut and spices work great together. Mouthfeel is creamy and it leaves your lips tingling."
"Too strong on the spice for my taste."
""
"First sip at Ballast Point Miramar brewery February 2015 with John, mom and dad."
""
"Overall - Nice heat with the sweet combining for an odd, unique and mostly pleasant drinking experience. Everything the Rogue Sriracha hot stout should have been, but wasn't."
"Novel concept, well executed. Surprised to be in the minority on this one."
"Well I can't be expected to know everything."
""
""
"It is what is advertised. Curry up front, coconut after taste. And cayenne just burning the back of your tongue. It delivers as advertised and is respectable but not what i enjoy out of a stout."
"I like this idea of a masala spiced beer, but this one is not it. Ballast Point, usually a huge fan but you owe me a Seamonster after this one..."
""
"I LOVE Indian food.  This is aVERY underrated beer from an Indian food lover perspective.  Bring that dish level 10 spicy ALL DAY...with this to pair it."
""
""
""
""
""

"I thought this was a pretty awesome beer, but judging by the other reviews I'm in the minority. To me, this tastes like what all those Christmas stouts brewed with 'spices' are supposed to taste like, with the uniqueness of the Indian spices really making it stand out above the other spice brewed stouts."
"But, it is good. And I bet it goes really well with may ethnic foods."
"I was drawn in by all the bizarre additives, but should have known better. The smell is all curry and cumin. Taste is much the same, but the cayenne heat is present as well. Not much stout flavor, just lots of spice. Overall a regrettable purchase."
""
"So, I guess this was interesting. Like drinking a bottle of curry mixed with stout. I mean, this clearly wasn't made for beer drinkers but for people who are just generally adventurous with their palates. Go ahead and try it, it's definitely different, but I hesitate to even call it beer and if you're a beer drinker looking for a delicious beer, this ain't it."
"The hints of spice and coconuts quickly hit the noise. The bite hits the back of the tongue and throat."
"The blend of spice was intoxicating.  Combined it with an Ancho Chili Creme Brulee for an amazing dessert."
"Liked this a lot- the spices are very well blended and complex.  I would love this spicing in an Imperial Stout.  I'm not sure this style supports all the spices that well, although the thinner feel might be better with a meal."
"Pleasant stout with better thne moderate spicing going on. Moderate heat, that glows on the tongue for a good long while...also more cumin and curry/Indian spicing.  Tasty, complex, interesting and quite worthy stout.....A natural pairing for some BBQ or indian food ....I'd definitely buy this one again"
""
"It smells great but the curry taste is just too overwhelming for me. I like Indian food, I like stouts, so I thought I'd like a curry stout. I was wrong."
"Interesting experience. The curry stays in the back and warms the stomach and the back of the throat. Chocolate and coconut forward in flavor with the spiciness of the curry taking the backseat and lingering on the finish. Nose starts like a brown ale with hints of cayenne spiciness with chocolate notes in the back. Glad I got to try it. Some of the reviews on here are completely mislead and must be trolling, not abrasive at all in flavor or smell in spite of the ingredients."
""
"LOVED IT."
""
"Too much Madras for me but very interesting. Would love to have more coconut and kaffir come out in this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes/smells like coconut thai curry, a bit spicy. Interesting, but not at all what I look for in a beer. The first sip was a bit jarring, but mellowed out as I became acclimated.  Overspiced for my taste. Sorry BP, your IPA offerings are in my top 5."
""
"o: overwhelmingly spicy for me. i appreciate what they did, and its a well-made beer, but i'm having trouble getting through it.  its just a bit too much"
""
""
""
""
"It smells and tastes like authentic, Indian curry. It's amazing. A bold yet well-done beer. Worth a try, unless you are shy at heart. Pleasant spiciness that builds over time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer with interesting flavor combinations but hard to finish a full one"
"Overall: Definitely not for everybody. Definitely not for most occasions. However, I've never had anything quite like it, and that says something. Ballast Point really created a stout that is in a league of its own. Being that it's a limited release, if you see it, and you love the ""beer adventure"" try it."
""
"Somehow, they pull it off, though, and it becomes an intriguing and powerful sip."
""
"Weird beer, but good. Doesn't drink well with any food."
""
"U gotta love spice and curry for this one, glad I do."
"Unique beer with a hell of a lot of spice flavor. Reminds me that I need to make curry with coconut milk again. A bit overwhelming in flavor near the end but the spices make me feel so good, I can't stop."
"One of the weirdest most disgusting beers i've ever had. Drain pour."
"You can really taste the curry would great with Indian food"
"Glass- Snifter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a great beer.  Again, only if you like Indian curry.  I like it, and I would definitely have it again."
""
"Weirdest beer I've had yet. Glad I tried it once. Don't know if i can finish the bomber. I do wish i would have split it with a couple of other adventurous peeps.An experience for sure. My tummy hurts...No regrats."
"Love this beer. To this day, this is the only beer I have drank, and threw up as the first beer of the night because I drank it too fast like an idiot. Be forewarned, this is a true sipping beer, to be drank with food. It is spicy,  and complex. Keep that in mind, and you will get along great with this one-of-a-kind brew!"
""
""
""
""
"This is a curry stout. If that thought disgusts you, you probably shouldn't buy, drink or rate this beer. I couldn't imagine having this without food to stand up to it, but it went well with pulled pork. It's hard to imagine a better take on a ""curry stout."" Trust your instincts on this one. If you think you might hate it, you'll probably hate it. If a curry stout is in your comfort zone, check it out."
"Who would have thought? This beer is fantastically done. Very impressed."
"Really damn hot, grab a glass of Delirium to go with."
""
""
""
"Now, I'm digging the initial curry aroma...and after a sip--wow! Peppery, high octane curry heat!! This most definitely is a love it/hate it type of beer. Personally, I love chile beers and spicy foods, so this is right up my alley. There's nothing subtle about this beast, yet it's entirely approachable if you enjoy a good, spicy, heat-generating beverage. Unique and approachable for those with an open-mind..."
""

""
"I grabbed it off the shelf because it sounds crazy and was something I was glad to try. I wouldn't seek it out again."
"A very complex and delicious beer."
""
"Definitely nailed what they were going for. lots of curry / Indian spices on the nose and palate."
"I should have read reviews before buying this. I'm clearly in the group of people who shouldn't have bought this. Maybe not the worst beer I've ever had but it's not a concoction I'll ever have again. Straight curry in my opinion."
"Thanks to a forgotten BA for sending this my way"
""
""
"As someone who loves big and complex flavor, this beer is unrivaled. I typically gravitate toward hard-hitting, aggressively citrus-y IPAs, but I have never been as wowed by a beer as I was by the Indra Kunindra. 10/10 would beer again."
""
"I was told a year on the shelf gives this beer a new life, but I'm really not trying to buy or smell this beer again lol"
"O: This is my favorite dark beer. I can understand why there's some dislike for it, but I love this beer so much, it's almost a bit heartbreaking to see and hear people refer to it as ""piss"" or ""vomit"". I really enjoy the fact that the beer doesn't get boozy as it warms up and allows other tasting notes to emerge. Can't wait to drink it again."
""
"Overall, a very unique and interesting beer.  It actually works for me."
"Absolutely horrible. Taste like soy sauce and indian spice."
"A very different kind of beer but very memorable in a good way.  I LOVE the spices!"
""
"It is a terrible disaster."
"This might have been the worst attempt at any beverage in the history of man. The mouthfeel (though spit up almost on consumption) was mouth full of spices that were balanced as if a deaf, dumb, blind, mute, Ethiopian wonderer grabbed a cabinet full of random dirt & attempted to make curry. The taste was 1 half sip away from vomitus. The appearance is as dark as night with a light stout head which is its only upside. I'm a US Marine & beer snob I'm quite aware, but I would not serve this ""swill"" to ISIS militants. That is how bad this product is. BP you are a top tier beer producer but on this you failed miserably. Please for the love of all beer drinkers everywhere take this urine off the shelves."
""
"O: Good beer, not overly spiced for me although it is heavily spiced if you are not familiar with Indian food/spices. Definitely would not be having multiples of these as they would probably become more like eating a meal than thirst quenching."
"Hardest review I have ever written here, and please reserve me the right to update these comments in the near future. MMMmmm,...,....yuck,....omg, auguh! Try it again. Not much different reaction. This stuff requires some heavily spiced eastern food that can fight back. So, I give this every point from 0-5, all over the place, this is unique. It is more like a spicy marinade I make for kebobs on the bbq than something I intend to drink. Clever, spicy, surprising, I give it a 1-5 point spread, you are gonna hate it or love it and there ain't no place inbetween! I will bbq with this tomorrow as my marinade for tri-tip and I am sure it is going to be awesome."
"Overall - Folks have given this 5/5's, which don't exist for their grapefruit/habanero IPA.. which I LOVE.  I thought that, after their habanero, this would just be the next step, unfortunately we just don't click.  I see comments like ""oh well if you don't like this, stick to Bud Lite"".  Get out of here.  This is such a uniquely crafted beer, perhaps my palate will appreciate it in time, but as for now it just seems like a risk that didn't pay off.  Take the money you'd spend on this and try any/all other B.P. brews before this, only then would I suggest taking the dive.  Will revisit in time, 1/5."
""
"On initial opening and pouring, I really got the smell of hard cedar and redwood. The taste is very much so, with huge hints of southeastern asian flavors. A very spicy beer with the slight stouty taste as the finish. I didn't like this beer and probably will not buy again."
"This beer is amazingly creative. Big bold flavors work well together and come through in well defined layers. Some of these haters should just stick with their Bud Light."

"O: There's just too much going on for me with this beer, I love stouts, but there so much that I think it takes away from the stout characteristics. I think all the added flavors overwhelm what should be the main characteristics, the stout flavors, I love the chili and I noticed that as the beer warms the chili is more apparent, but all the other flavors are just too much."

"OVERALL: *Shrugs shoulders* As if someone would ever do this on purpose. To be sure, I actually like Indian food and can appreciate a touch more heat than your average bear, but this is probably the most exact and accurate representation of “mistake” in physical form on the planet. I can picture the beards sitting around and debating whether they should release this beer or not… “Well, this sucks, but we need to sell it, and since the vast majority of our other beers are pretty awesome, enough people will give us the benefit of the doubt and buy a bottle so we can sell it all, then they’ll try it and hate it, but they won’t give up on us because of the other awesome stuff.” Well, okay, you’re right. You guys are great, but this… the only logical consequence from this is extreme firings. Extreme mass firings."
"Great beer. Definite taste of coconut curry and lime leaves."

"Initially I wasn't sure what to expect of this, especially after sniffing it as I poured. This could VERY easily have been some bizarre and unintelligible mess ala some of the voodoo doughnut collabos, but damn Ballast Point nailed it with this one. Taking a completely left field combination and not only making it fit and play nice with itself, but to craft something so purely enjoyable... my hat's off."
""
"One of the few drain pours I've had. One taste and you will be asking yourself what in god's name was the brewmaster thinking?"
"Tastes like liquid curry sauce with a side of stout.  It's well done but I really felt like I was eating a curry dish.  Very strange beer drinking experience indeed."
""
""
"What is Hindi for ""ay caramba""? This is a highly unusual beer. It is Capetown Curry in a glass. Strong spices: cumin dominates but also other sweeter notes. And a peppery kick. Color nearly opaque dark brown. A worthwhile left-fieldish beer I would definitely get again. (You maybe literally COULD make curry with it, but is maybe a little high priced for a cooking ingredient.)"
""
""

"Black beer with dark brown hues, light mocha head. Smells is dark chocolate, toasted coconut, burnt sugar, brown sugar. Taste is toasty coconut, marshmellow, creamy coconut, cumin, cinamin spice, some juicy orange, and pepper heat towards the end that dries the beer out. Overall a solid beer."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 4/21/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, vanilla, coconut, cumin, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn, cardamom, cayenne, lime, herbal, and toast/herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and the wide variety of spices; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, vanilla, coconut, cumin, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn, cardamom, cayenne, lime, herbal, and toast/herbal earthiness. Moderate earthy spices and heat on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toast, vanilla, coconut, cumin, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn, cardamom, cayenne, lime, herbal, and toast/herbal earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and big spice flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance with no cloying flavors after the finish and a moderate amount of lingering heat. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol was well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish other than the heat from the spices. Overall this was a very nice spiced stout. All around good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and spice flavors; and quite smooth to sip on despite the moderate heat. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours pitch black with two finger ring at top. Very frothy head. Overpowering smell of spices. Smoother on the front end, very strong taste of cayenne and curry on the finish. I feel like this one should be left to age a little while; too much spice. Felt as though I were drinking strong rum. Definitely the most unique brew I have ever had. Glad to have tried it, probably would not willingly drink another."
"Overall: what a weird beer. Definitely in a category all its own. I love its flavors, though I'm not sure I love them in beer. Still, it's ten times more successful than most chile or otherwise oddly-spiced brews."
""
"Aromas of malty curry. Absolutely no other way to describe that! Vanilla curry that melts into a roasted oatiness. Moderate hops that are relatively low bitterness. Finish is thick with a mild coffee aftertaste. The curry is strong in this one and lives up to my expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a very well done beer from Ballast Point. I've had stouts that infused Indian spices before without nearly as much success. This one manages to have a very forward presence from the spicing without it being overpowering or cloying. I would gladly drink this beer again if I was in the right mood. It made me want to go get some tikka masala for dinner."

"O: the beer is ok except for the taste, that part is rough"

"This is one of the most unique beers I've ever had. It pours black with a light tan head. It reeks of curry making you less than excited to try the beer. Mouthfeel is good; very smooth and creamy. It's not a bad beer but the curry is very overpowering making it very hard to finish a full glass. However surprisingly the curry, cayenne and other spices compliment each other very well. In the end the curry was just a bit too much. I recommend this beer for uniqueness alone. Try it!"

"O- I wish the different flavors blended together better rather than seeming to come in separate waves. The lime and spice are so dominant I hardly could detect much else initially. Still a fun, tasty and aggressive beer. I like when breweries concoct stuff like this."
""
""
""
""
"O: If anything this is a bit too much of a good thing. I love curry but this is nothing but. A bit of beer would make a nice balance. That being said, I really like it and given what it is it's a home run"
""
"Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, pleasant. Overall, quite tasty. I like it."
"O - If you really like curry or even just spicy things in general you ought to try this. It's a pretty interesting experience, although ultimately this level of curry and spice is not a flavour profile I'm really looking for in a beer. Having said that, for what it is, it is pretty well executed."
""
""
"I love Ballast Point offerings and I like a wide variety of beers. But this beer was too much for me. I was expecting a stout with some mild Indian flavor notes. Instead it was like drinking a spicy curry Indian dinner. All of the flavors as indicated on the label were there. And to me it was crafted successfully by the brewers at Ballast Point. But it was too much for me. The curry produced too much of a burn for my palate. The complexity of the curry, coconut, lime were all there, but at the end of the day, it's not what I want to drink in a beer. Others may like this beer and I don't want to trash the beer either. My palate just wasn't right for this beer."

"O: A curry bomb. Drinkable but about halfway through I stopped liking it. They should tone back the curry and spice and turn up the lime and coconut."
"Whoa Nelly! I was intrigued by this beer, with the curry notes in the aroma, and the hint of coconut milk, and then I actually tasted it- like a plateful of curry- strong curry. So strongly flavored that the curry just dominates everything. I thought this might be pleasant with food, but really, it's so highly spiced that I can't see it complementing anything other than white rice. Now mind you, the flavors aren't bad, or artificial, just a bit too much. It's certainly interesting, and could actually be a very good beer if it were reined in a bit."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a Great Lakes Brewing goblet, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch tan head that fizzled away pretty quickly. There isn't much lacing at all. The brew smells mostly like cumin, curry, and cayenne, along with a bit of coconut. The spices overpower pretty much everything else that's in the aroma. The spices are strong in the flavor of this beer too, but I can also taste some lime, chocolate, and vanilla. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and smooth with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, too bad I only bought one bomber because if I had another one I'd probably drink it now! Recommended if you like spicier food/beer. $9.35 a bomber."

"Got a taste of this as it sounded crazy interesting. At first, it was so strange that I was a bit apprehensive and did not think I could drink an entire pint. But once I did I found myself going back for more. Smell is dominated by curry along with hints of chocolate and roasted barley. Taste is so unique, curry again, cocoa, a mild roasted coffee and some heat that does not overwhelm in the finish. The base beer does not drink at all like a foreign stout. It is smooth and slightly malty. So well balanced in flavors. Unfortunately, the coconut and kaffir leaf are almost non-existant. Still an awesome offering by ballast point!"
"Overall a good beer, but the Stout just gets crushed by the spiciness."

"I really enjoy all the dark offerings I've had the pleasure to enjoy from Ballast, this one not so much. I think I'm just not a spicy/hot beer fan. Atleast not yet."
""
""
""
""
"O: The was definitely a surprise, a pleasant one. Keep an open mind...and dont watch reviews...I was TERRIFIED before cracking it. I would definitely buy/drink this again, and would especially if I found it on tap. Would have prefered less coconut sweetness, but it isnt offensive. Of all notes, I was surprised that I LOVED the chili kick (generally not a spicy/hot fan)Keep in mind this is a sipping beer, and not at all sessionable. I wouldve prefered it in a regular 12oz, as the bomber was too much between the boyf and I. Couldnt finish it."
""
""
""
"An interesting beer, for sure, but again, it's hard to imagine ever drinking a whole lot o this stuff."
""
""
""
"I'll start off by stating that this Ballast Point does exactly what they intended to do with this beer, whether or not that is a good thing is certainly up to some debate. I purchased the bottle on a whim and didn't drink for probably a good month. I poured the bottle into a tulip glass and let it sit for about ten minutes to let it warm up slightly and hopefully open up all of the flavors that made it into the bottle. The smell tells me what I'm about to taste, but not in a way that was very appetizing. It smelled alot like walking into a Indian restaurant lots of curry and spices, a little bit of sweetness, not really how i want my beer to smell. Taste was better the curry, cumin, coconut, and the lime all came through. The best part of the flavors were the balance they complemented each other just like a great food dish. The saving grace was the cayenne though, the heat was just strong enough to take the beer to another level and given some depth. After awhile though as well constructed as it was the novelty wore off and i found myself not wanting to finish it. Overall excellent execution and worth a try but at the end of the day a beer that tastes very much like an Indian dish isn't one I'm going to keep coming back to."

"I understand BP has also made this in a 9% run; I wonder if I'd have dug it more. As for this take, I wouldn't say it's something I'd seek out again. However, I give it credit for being completely unlike any other beer I've ever tried. I enjoyed it just enough."
""
""
""
""
"O - An interesting brew, and original for sure. But not really my cup of tea. Too spicy for me, but then again I am not crazy on Indian food...so to be expected."
"O - Presuming you're interested in the Indian spices, this beer is a must-try, and I suspect it'll be greatly enjoyed. For people more cautious on their attitude toward Indian spices BUT willing to try something different, I suspect they'll also enjoy a pour of this. While the spices dictate a great deal of the entire experience, they are not used stupidly or unabashedly... this is a very balanced experience that happens to hang out with Indian spices. Perhaps the must fun aspect of this beer is just how drastically the drinking experience changes while you come to terms with the spices... fun!"
"Wish this was available in six packs, I would buy it often."
""
"O: It all blends together really well and tastes interesting, weird and delicious. A kick of cayenne remains in the finish and aftertaste. Wonderfully weird and strange, delicious, but you have to like indian spices to like this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer is black with a thin beige cap. The aroma brings chocolate, hot pepper, spice. Some dark chocolate with oranges and citrusy spice. Heat gains strength and intensity as I make my way through the beer. Cayenne pepper and spicy heat lingers amid dark chocolate. Not too heavy. This beer achieves its intended purpose, and for that, I will give credit. However, I don't see myself returning to this one, as I don't find pleasure in the combination of beer and spicy heat."
""
""
"O: Overall I gave consideration for its uniquiness and what they were intending to do rather then shoe horn and punish this by style for a more focused attention on the spices then the roasted and coffee nature. An uniquely spiced export stout that highlights the asian induced spices with a very good balance and represenatation. A definite consideration for a one time sampling to try something outside the box."
"O: I didn't know what to think at first. This beer surly is interesting... I like it. I don't think it's an A beer, but I think it's good. One thing that disappointed me was the misleading style name. I expected more desert and less curry (although I'm a big fan of curry). It was still a good buy though."

"O: Well, this was exactly what it said was going to be. It was a different and challenging beer for me. Very interesting, and I think I would recommend it for someone looking to try something very different or as a change of pace. Certainly not an everyday drinker."
"O - Over all, I'd say this was definitely a sipping beer, and is better suited to be paired with food. I had this on it's own as a night cap and it did the job fine, but I wish I had it with food to see if it exploded any more. Great brewery, nice beer, and I MIGHT try it again."

"This screams Indian food. If you don't like it, chances are you probably wont like this beer. It's a full on curry spice assault on the palate. Good chili heat as well. The bottle version seems to be hotter in terms of chile spice than on tap. Curry lovers, you have found your beer."
"O - A very unique taste experience for sure. Personally, this one is a little too much for me, and I'm not a huge fan of it, but I'm judging this based on style and description."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is a love and hate relationship. I really don't know what to think. I love the beer by the way it tastes, but hate it by the way the taste I'm used to expecting. Where's the stout? Such a strange interesting beer."
""
""
"A very different beer. It was off-putting at first but once I threw out expectations and went along for the ride it really wasn't bad. Truly unique."
""
""
"This is a very different beer. There is a lot going on in it. I could taste the curry, cayenne, and lime leaf. its complex and interesting. I found it a nice change of pace and it was fun sorting through all the different flavors. I wouldn't recommend it for every one, but if you are looking for something unusual definitely give it a try."
""
""
""
"FIrst of all, whether or not you like curry is going to either make or break this beer. Probably not going to be too many ""gray area"" people on this. You either like curry and coconut and will probably like this beer or not. I do like curry so this beer went over better with me than with some people. Pours dark, looks nice. Taste is lots of curry, lots of cayanne heat, and some silkiness from the coconut. Not really anything traditionally recognizable as beer flavored. Interesting and unique."

"Somehow this beer works well. It does focus more on the specialty ingredients than the beer flavors themselves but there's enough there to remind you it's a beer. The curry on the nose is overwhelming and can take a bit from the flavor if you get to big of a whiff so I suggest drinking out of a pint or something.curry can be a little overwhelming at times. But a pretty complex beer with waves of cool flavor."

"Overall, I liked this a lot more than I thought I would, and would get it again just to foster this kind of freakiness among brewers. Not scary or off-putting at all. I think it would go quite well with sushi or Chinese takeaway."

"wonderful to find this one hidden in the cooler. Appearance is opaque with minimal head. Aroma definately has curry and coconut. Decent lacing. Taste on the front is is slightly roasted moving quickly into cumin, curry with a very warming affect. Overall I am very impressed and look forward to drinking more in the winter."
""
"Interesting. One to share (as this is a bomber). Hard to finish, but not because you dislike it, but because it is just alot of spice."
"Finally got around to grabbing another bottle of this. I said this was a one time only purchase but I was wrong. I have been craving this beer since the first time I tried it.  Revisiting it, I find more beloved coconut than before. It's just such a unique beer. It's ridiculous. It's also spicier than I remember; actual heat from the cayenne. Tickling heat hangs in my lips. Really hard to judge this beer after everything is considered. It's an abomination that I love; a Frankenstein. Definitely raised my original rating from a 4.07."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with a yellowish tan head that fades fairly quickly to a thick collar and a few streaks of lace. Heavy coconut and curry on the nose, and not much else, fairly sweet. Medium thick, high carbonation body, soft on the palate and very spicy on the finish. Flavor starts sweet and malty, milk chocolate and coconut before finishing with a variety of spices I can't identify that continue to build in heat on the back of the throat and front of the tongue long into the finish."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, oily, jet black coloring with brown tints around the edges and no head whatsoever. Looks heavy and dense. Aromas of bittersweet baker's chocolate enveloped in curry spices. Very interesting blending on the nose. Flavors are curry forward, with both spice and heat, followed by a ribbon of chocolate and coffee, both bitter and sweet, and then the beer transitions back into the spice and heat of curry. The aftertaste is bitter and warming, and the warmth lingers throughout the finish and for quite a while after, as well. The finish is slick and smooth. This is a very unique take on an Export stout. I am very intrigued by it, and it would make for some interesting food pairings, because it seems like it can easily overpower."

"This beer is definitely not in my wheelhouse. I am not a hug fan of curry but I was willing to give this beer a try. I wanted to like it by could not get past the curry. I wish it was more my style, I would recommended it to to the fans of curry out there. They probably can get past the curry flavor that I can't. If you don't like curry don't try this but if you are open minded enough, might be worth a try."
"Overall - If you don't like curry, or heat, steer clear. This is one of my favorite ""specialty beers"" out there. If you have one, and would like to trade, let me know!"

"Wow... This beer is the most interesting beer I've ever had by far! These are spices I'm very familiar with. The smell is an aggressive hit of curry, cumin and cayenne for sure. The taste is sweet chocolate with a finish of all the spices in the nose. I absolutely love it. If you want a new experience in beer, and you like Indian food or spicy Asian food, this is a must try. Mixed reviews are totally understandable, but I'll always remember this beer."

"I found this beer to be really enjoyable if the consumer can sit back and appreciate what the brewer was looking to accomplish. If you're benchmark for this style is Guinness Foreign Export, this may not be the beer for you. But the collaboration on this beer really did a nice job incorporating the ""India Style"" ingredients to a traditional brew."
"Pours jet black with a brown-ish head. In the aroma, curry, cayenne pepper, and small lime citrus. In the taste, lime, small curry, and notes of cayenne pepper spice. A small spice bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry lime cayenne pepper, and curry notes in the aftertaste. Big lime, mellow curry and big spice in the end. Different, but enjoyable."
""
""
""
"This is a beer where the label tells you what you're getting yourself into. This is a curry beer. It smells like curry. It tastes like curry. The aftertaste burns just a bit in the back of the throat, just like curry. If the concept of drinking a good curry doesn't interest you, stay the hell away from this beer. I love curry, I love stouts, and this exceeded my expectations. A tasty and surprisingly drinkable novelty."
""
""
"Well it's interesting to say at least. A stout by color and maybe malts, but I would say the body was a bit more like a dark ale. The spices of cinnamon and curry dominate the flavor profile. There is a root beer/licorice quality that develops as the beer warms. Carbonation is low. I think that it is worth a try as it is truly a unique brew."
""

"Easily one of the most interesting beers I've ever had. This is a drink that appeals to both the beer lover and foodie in me. I'm not always into beers with crazy flavors, but Indra Kunindra is mind-boggling and one of a kind. It's not often that a beer will blow my mind anymore; i've tried many. The best thing about this beer is the risk taken in releasing it. For $10 a bottle, a beer had better be something special. This could have been a giant train-wreck, but instead it raises the bar of what's possible in brewing."
""
"I'm starting to second-guess what I look for in an Export Stout. Maybe they should all taste like authentic Indian curry and have a bite that stings. Spicy? I like. Savory? I like. This is a beer that I need to stock up (at least, in this household). My girlfriend calls this the best beer she has EVER had. I disagree, but it might not be too far off. I'm a sucker. Ballast Point nailed it and no one can take that away from them. You're a bold-faced liar if you think this could've been much better. Do you like Indian food? Do you crave the strange and the exotic? C'mon now folks, not much noticeable booze and the idea becomes fruition. Invent a style for a beer like this, and it's a record that will never be broken. So good."

"O: I really liked this beer, but then again I also like Indian curry, naan bread, samosas, and certain Bollywood flicks, so your mileage may vary. I say pick it up."
""
""
"What an amzingly balanced beer. So many interesting flavors in my mouth. Huge notes of curry and spices finishing with a magical waterfall of coconut. A great beer to share with friends after a nice meal. I'd love to meet the guy who came up with this recipe."
"22 oz. bottle served in a tumbler glass. Pours a cola color with a fizzy, brown and almost instantly diminishing head. Aroma is roasted malt, cumin, curry, pepper, and chocolate. Flavor is roasted malt, curry, pepper, lime, vanilla, a hint of coconut, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium, dry, bitter, low carbonation, and mighty spicy. Very interesting beer, the aroma is slightly scary, but the malt background allows a bit of a balance with the spiciness."
"poured from a bomber into 2 snifters, jet black with a moderate head. The aroma is lots of spicey curry. the spiciness of the curry is the dominant flavor, there are also subtle hints of sweetness in the finish. the body is moderate, good carbonation. lad I split it with a friend. One of the more interesting brews I have had, but if you are not a fan of Indian food don't pick this one up, for me the curry was a little too much."
""
"O: I couldn't imagine how good with would go with some butter chicken or any curried meat. Never had a beer like this before, but what a masterpiece of building Indian/Thai qualities into a beer."
""
"O: Come one peeps, you know you love this beer! The most unique brew of 2013 so far. I'd have it again."
"I don't care if you don't like curry, you have to admit this beer is brilliantly made! horrifically underrated here on BA. this pours a radiant inky black color, unsuspicious, and boasting an inch or so of lacy mocha head. the nose is just insane, like dank takeout indian food. there is all of the elements, curry powder, cumin, which is very strong, kaffir lime leaf, which is almost refreshing amidst all the dark roast, and coconut, to sweeten things up. there is also the cayenne, if you take a really hard sniff, it almost burns the nostrils, true to form. the taste is every bit as good as the nose, like exceptional takeout food. the curry is strong, the cumin is fresh, the chili is just in the finish, and the coconut and lime leaf cut through some of the other heavy flavors. I can only imagine how many times they made this beer wrong or out of proportion before they got it right. it certainly is dialed now, seriously fantastic. the mix of flavors here is like nothing I would have ever expected in a beer. I have to say, a whole bottle would have been too much, and im not sure im in a hurry to find this again, but what a wonderful treat to get to try such a creative and artfully crafted bottle of beer. this is really something special, and it puts the countless spiced beers to shame. you wont believe this beer until you taste it!"
""
""
"A good ""snack"" to have with this pint is some good fresh toasted coconut macaroons as they pair absolutely perfect with this beer. Oh and is curry and the other spices and afrodisiak? Well they seemed to be for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There is a surprising amount of spiciness to this beer - probably a bit hotter than the average Indian food that I have ordered all over the US. There is a nice amount of kick to the spiciness but it does make the beer a little tougher to drink much of - definitely reduces the drinkability. Lots of complexity to the flavors and smells. Don't think I could have more than one of these."
""
""
""
""
""
"OV: Very very enjoyable. One of my favourites to drink either by itself or to pair with food. Again, don't know how Ballast Point managed to get all these flavours to blend and work together, but they did. So much flavour here if you're a both a beer geek and foodie who appreciates things 'outside the box'. Seems a couple reviewers didn't get the aspect BP was going for."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm very impressed. This is a supremely interesting beer that manages both to do something unique, and to provide a balanced and comprehensive beer experience. Extremely interesting and engaging stuff."
"This has to be a polarizing brew. You must like the spices added to like this beer. Fortunately I do and this is one of Ballast Points better ""pepper series"" brews. I am a little worried that the flavor profile may get cloying by the time I get to the end of the bottle."
""
""
"Black, translucent at the edges. Tan head. Nose of lime, coconut milk, cayenne and curry are quite prominent as well. Ultra-unique, really smells of Indian cuisine. Tastes again of lime and coconut, cayenne and roast are there. Dark chocolate as well, cayenne stings into the finish. Medium thin body (suited to the beer) with a lower medium carbonation. An original beer, spice and the dregs of every glass poured is super spicy."
""
""
""
""
"O: as fas as I'm concerned, this is a chile stout - and I really like that kind of thing, but I also understand that others may not - the cayenne is very dominant, accented with smoke and lime, and underscored by the dark stout malts and their respective flavors."
""
""
""
"Definitely an India-style export stout!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Reviewed from notes. Appearance is a dark opaque brown, not quite black. Brown head forms and retains nicely. The smell is incredibly unique: lots of curry and lime come through up front with some coconut and spice to follow. The state is more spice forward and starts with some ancho chili followed by a dark chocolate quality. The finish features a touch of licorice. Quite the journey of flavored here. The body is on the thin side with medium carbonation. This was an ambitious project by Ballast Point and I think they did a good job at bringing together so many odd flavor in a brew. This would pair nicely with Pad Thai."

""
"*Oh yes, and bring me. I'll be needing more Indra Kunindra to smother all over my body."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Intense, flavorful, and unique. Somehow it all comes together. If I had a complaint it would be that there's very little of the base beer here, and certainly not many characteristics of a stout. Definitely a sipper due to the spice, and a beer you really have to be in the mood for. That said, it is masterfully done, and a must try for fans of hot Indian or Thai curries."
""
"D/O: Although unconventional, this spiced stout is appealing--at a distance. The smell is very interesting, savory, with no indication of the messy and unbalanced flavor to come. Heat is a problem, quickly escalating to an undrinkable level. After setting this beer aside as a beverage, it was able to redeem itself in remarkable fashion as a cooking ingredient."
""
""
""
""
"O: Originally purchased as an exercise for the palate, Indra is a unique and welcomed departure from the classic stout style. I enjoyed the spice charachteristics which add depth and complexity but ultimately wanted more balance with the inherent dark sweetness of the stout style and stronger coconut presence."
""
"Overall, worth a shot but wish this came in a 12oz instead."

"This beer poured out as a black color with a quick fading head on top. There is no retention of lacing at all on this. Not the nicest looking stout. The smell if big, there was some initial coconut at first but it's quickly overpowered by the lime and spice on this brew. The taste of the beer has a very unique flavor. This beer reminds me of the lime flavored Doritos with a spicy salsa. There is plenty of lime and spice on this beer, the coconut is kind of hidden too much. The mouthfeel is pretty carbonated with a thinner body to it. Overall this beer is unique. It's not something I could drink a lot of but it was interesting to try."
""
""
"O: I think I like it? Points for being interesting as hell, and not being entirely terrible. It pulls it off better than I thought it might. I imagine this would go well (maybe??) with actual curries and the like. If you don't like Indian food, avoid this beer."
""
""
""
"O - I'm so glad I decided to pick this up, as it's very unique and experimental (in a good way). Although the spice profile is huge, it is somewhat balanced by the roast and citrus. Definitely a sipper, and would be interesting to pair this with some sort of Asian cuisine."
""
""
"High B-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good- medium bodied, light to moderate carbonation. This has a decent spice to it but it's well balanced by the smooth coconut. This is definitely worth trying if you can find it. I'd certainly get it again."
""
"This was my first foreign export style beer. Although I don’t like Indian food (to me that was what this beer was all about), this was a very interesting beer and something nice to try."
"O: I enjoy experimentation and unique spins on styles as much as the next person, but this was a little too much for me. The dominance of the curry made this one difficult to enjoy, though I was really looking forward to it. Doubt I'll try it again, but I commend Ballast Point for trying something new and unique."
""
"O: I can sum up this beer in a single word: bizarre."
"This is a fun beer with a lot of things going on but I think it's too spicy in that it's not balanced well. If the spices were more in line with the stout malts so they each complimented each other, bam!, you got a winner."
""
"Jet black with a beautiful khaki tan head, some sediment fallen and collected at the bottom of my glass, a water goblet. The nose was molasses and booze, with an extra unexpected scent, a smell of sweet coconut curry. I loved the taste of this! Vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, and sweet coconut curry immediately followed by a spicy chile burn at the back of the palate that lingers through the finish. As the beer warmed the flavors became even more intense and accessible. The chile spice gave me a bit of heartburn to be honest. The mouthfeel was very pleasing, well carbonated with a medium thick mouthfeel that coated the palate without being oily. I highly recommend this to every craft beer lover as this is a truly unique brew, and done well."
""
"Which leads to a weird score, the overall is higher than it should seem because what makes this beer great isn't really accounted for in the four metrics given."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very spicy and interesting. The flavor profile was more Thai than Indian for me. Strong curry and coconut notes. Slightly jarring flavor profile. Ballast Point is one of my favorite breweries and I appreciate it when a brewery tries something different. Everyone should try this beer once since its flavor is so unique but I doubt that I'll be coming back for seconds."
""
"O: Extremely unique beer, in a good way. Would definitely grab some for home if my local place gets some. Not one that other beers can follow well due to the lingering presence of the spices. If you're out trying several to see what you like, be sure to save this one for last."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is quite unique and is quite spicy. It's not the easiest beer to drink but is probably as drinkable as you could get for a spiced beer."
""
""
""
"This is a really hard beer to review. I really like the fact that it is so unique, but when it comes down to the question of would I buy (or even drink) this again... probably not."
""
"O:  5.0 for uniqueness. Really interesting beer and I have never tasted anything like it. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone who wants to try something different"
"Side note: this beer is tough on many stomachs. The chile and spices can really work it over. I wish I'd had it earlier in the evening to digest it through more easily."
""
""
""
"So odd. More like food than beer. Not unenjoyable, but it's like Indian food: you damn well better be in the mood."
"A+ for uniqueness. Overall A. Really a solid beer with a tremendous flavor profile. This isn't a beer I could drink a lot of due to fatigue, but it is very enjoyable in small (bomber sized) quantites. This is very well balanced and very drinkable. This would be great with a meal or as a meal. You should definitely check it out."
"In one word, just flat up awesome. This is the kind of craft that really impresses me, just needs some cardamom or garam masala and we are taking this to the next level baby!"
""
"Overall: I feared this brew for a month or two, letting it sit in the fridge, daring me to try it. I’m glad I finally did! It has bright Kaffir lime leaf flavors and a smooth and floral finish. It is very flavorful and definitely unique. The burn in the back of your throat is welcome. Despite being quite crisp for a beer this dark, it is also rich; I could have only one of these."
""
""
"Drinkability – This might have a touch too much spice to be highly drinkable. I’m not sure whether curry belongs in beer, but I think this is about as good as it can be done."
"O: Definitely one of the most unique flavor combinations in a beer that I've ever had. Usually experiments like this fail miserably but this one turned out while well. Roasted malt tends to go well with chile pepper heat and the coconut brings a nice toasty aspect. Lots of spices everywhere that are hard to describe but contribute to the spicy/hot aspects of this beer. Nice balance of flavors to boot."
""
"O-this is just an awesome beer. i've never, ever had anything like this. i was expecting some sort of weird dogfish headesque concoction that is weird and okay, but doesn't quite flow right. but this flows right, very right. its so yummy! its something i can drink all night, i'll actually be craving this when its gone, i know so. the spice hits so well."
""
""
"Overall quite a unique beer. The spices really come out and dominate everything else, and teh beer itself is kinda lost in it all. It's somewhat tasty as I'm starting to really enjoy well done curry, but all in all it's hard to get the beer aspect of it. The pepper heat is nice for me, as well as coconut, but still hard to really enjoy it as a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nearly black and opaque with a dark khaki head. Banana, cocoa, coconut, and some unfamiliar spice on the nose. Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and smooth. Coconut, cardamom, ginger, and clove. My goodness, this is so magnificent and unique. I took one of these home."
"Overall I liked the beer and I'm definitely glad I picked it up, but I don't know if I need to have this one again. If you like curry, this beer is a must try. If you don't like curry, stay far away."
""
"I realize there plenty of coffee and raspberry flavored beers in the Stout categories, but why isn't this a Herbed/Spiced beer? You could only rate the spice flavors, which are totally heavy-handed, not the fleeting beeriness. From the 22 oz bottle."
""
"O: one of the more interesting beers I've drank. Definitely not sure what to expect and I'm not sure if I like the outcome. I wouldn't call it a drain pour candidate but I don't think I'll be buying another one. Spices seem to dominate the malt bill and I'm not sure if I'm feeling carbonation or my tongue starting to burn. Not bad at all though. If you're looking for an interesting beer that's kinda DFH like in oddity then this one is right up your alley. the coconut is nice but a bit of subtlety from the spice would have been lovely instead of it being so in your face."
""
"Overall: this beer was a bit too spicy and the curry and cayenne is too up front here. A small glass is all you can have in a single session."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with a edge and some etch of mocha foam. Smells like curry mix in the spice jar still - profoundly strong. Oddly, the lime comes through and actually as it warms I think the cumin is what may put this over the edge for appreciation. I love curry, and I love cumin, but a little too much here. Flavor is like biting into a cumin, kaffir, massamun curry ball with a bit of cocoa and coffee. I can't stress this enough: THE BEER NEEDS TO WARM UP SUBSTANTIALLY. Medium bodied with moderated carb and a relatively dry finish."
""
"Unless you really like Indian food and the spices used in it then stay away from this poison."
""
""
"This is an interesting stout. Its a little too curry dominant for my tastes. Still worth a try, made me want Lamb Vindaloo."
"Good grocery list beer. Usually the adjuncts are overpowering and messy or too subtle to be worthwhile but this was a good mix."
""
"Wow, quite a beer...its flavor is very unique and awesome but it is also damn difficult to drink. Even splitting the bomber was kind of a chore, I would've been good with a ~4oz pour of this. Definitely worth trying, especially if you like spice/Indian food but to me it's a novelty beer."
"O: this is a strange and interesting brew, a bit heavy on the lime for my tastes, and deffinatly heavy on the spice, like unsaid before, reminds me of a sweaty Indian guy. Glad I tried it, but I don't see myself hurrying to pick up another."
""
""
""
"O - I've had this beer on tap and it was MUCH better. It's a little too smooth out of the bottle for my taste."
"This a tasty and unique beer and well worth the effort to taste."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Very interesting blend of curry spices in the export stout. Good overall balance with great complexity."
""
"Shared by BRoss242 during his own send-off party before he moves! Will miss you man! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a massively dark brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, curry, Indian food, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, spices, curry, and meat. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I really didn’t know what to expect on this one when I first saw. Once I took my first smell of it I REALLY didn’t know what to expect. Was this dry hopped with Indian food was one of my first thoughts… I happen to like Indian food, but why does my beer smell like it? The same went on in the flavor as well as it tasted like curried meat which was quite surprising. I could see this going well with a nice dish of Indian food, but on its own, I’m not too sure about. Glad I got to experience something this strange, but doubt I will do so again."
""
"The pepper heat builds up on this with each sip which makes it a bit of a stretch to drink a whole bomber of. Nevertheless, it is an interesting brew that works with a food pairing. I thought it was good with a southwestern style chile. Would work even better with Indian curries. I'll try that option with one of my remaining bottles."

"There aren’t many things I regret in this life, but tasting this beer is one of them. Too overpowering and the aftertaste stays with you FOR-EV-ER!!! Tried chasing it down with some high quality H2O, but no luck. F- grade beer. Let's never speak of this beer again."
"O- An absolutely awesome chili/curry stout, I've had chili beers before, but nothing that a) also incorporated curry and coconut and b) did it very well. It was also very drinkable, I polished off an 8 oz pour with no problem at all. This beer is a real treat to drink."

"Drink- Unique, layered, semi balanced. The coconut spice was a good combo for me. Very flavorful."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark brown with mahogany highlights at the edges. Half finger light brown head dissipated slowly to a ring around the glass with light lacing. Interesting aroma of sweet dark malt, coconut and pepper with hints of curry and cocoa. Flavor is also unusual; coconut is instantly obvious on the start, with sweet and roasted malt, chocolate, immediately covered with peppery spices. Finishes peppery and spicy with the heat clearly from hot pepper and not from hops. The spices definitely dominate most of the taste of this stout, but the body, while not intense, supports the spicy flavors. Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess. I like this quite a bit and enjoyed the whole bomber in one evening. Not for the hot pepper and/or coconut adverse. I would pick this up again if it was available. (Please come to Washington, Ballast Point!)."

"Overall this is well crafted recipe in which the spices are blended in well and not too overbearing but they do take the forefront and leave the base stout taste in the back seat."
""
""

"O: A very interesting beer. Overall, good, but can't say I thoroughly enjoyed it. But, I will say it is very different and the blend of flavors does seem to work in a rather odd fashion."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy tan head that settles to a thin film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coconut, curry spice, and lemongrass. Taste is very much the same with a spicy finish after each sip. Very tasty stuff. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with some awesome Indian food elements added into it. A real surprise for me."

"HV"
"O: This beer is insane on the flavors and completely worth it if you can even find it. Lucky me i have 2 more bottles."
""
"Poured from bomber to pint glass. Pours a thick oily black color with a small 1 finger mocha head with decent retention and lacing throughout. Very unique nose: coconut, roasted malt, curry, hints of pepper and heat. The flavor follows suit with a huge coconut flavor that mellows out into a complex blend of curry, roast, pepper, cocoa, and a bit of lime. Very unique. Finishes smooth and creamy with a medium body and mild bitterness. Overall, this is quite a unique brew! It was a pleasure to have sampled it, I can easily say I've never had anything like it. I'd recommend it if for nothing else the unique flavor."
""
""
"Interesting beer, but definately one to split a bottle with 2-3 people."
""
""
"o - Overall a very interesting stout. Wasn't necessarily bad, but a very weird and interesting mix that didn't do it for me. Some people really liked it as it tastes a lot like Thai style Coconut Curry, but that isn't what I really would want in a beer, and I think we all found it tough to drink 5 oz.'s. Not something I'd seek out again."
""
""
""
"Pours a inky black with a creamy mocha-colored head that settles to a nice cap and leaves lots of streaky lacing. Fantastic nose of sweet malt, coconut, curry powder, and spices. So insane, perfectly captures a Thai curry. Taste is just as amazing, TONS of coconut, chocolate malt, curry powder, and spices with a hit of lime and a subtle chili pepper spiciness that build as the beer warms (and you drink more). Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Such an insane beer, and truly one of the most unique and memorable I've had!"
"Pours a very dark brown-black with a medium tannish-brown head that disappears slowly. Scent is heavy with coconut and a plethora of spices that make my nose tingle. A lot of chocolate and a little bit of lime. Taste is initially dark chocolate with just a bit of anise. I get a lot of coconut. Just a hint of curry with a ton of cayenne and cumin. The cayenne lingers on the throat and tongue with tingly spiciness. A bit of alcohol as well. As it warms...the curry comes through more. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spicy, and tingly. Drinkability is fair. Overall, this is a unique beer, but all the spices can be a bit overwhelming. Tasty though."

"M: Medium comexioun, slightly creamy."

"Overall: I wasn't going to buy this beer because quite frankly, it sounded disgusting, but the clerk at Holiday Wine cellar talked me into it and man am I glad he did. A crazy idea that totally came together and just worked. I split this bomber with a friend and we were blown away. A unique, and highly recommended brew if you can find it."

"The bottle calls this an Indian style export stout, and wordplay aside I would probably call this a Thai stlye stout as far as pure flavors go. An extreme beer that pushes boundaries that nobody seems to have even approached before, utterly unique, tantalizingly exotic, and simply sublime."
"D - Wish I had just one glass. This one is fun, but won't be after 2-3."
"650 ml bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small tan head that has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is big coconut, some curry, some light lime, and a bit of roast. Very unique. The initial taste is sweet coconut milk, followed by some light curry, a bit of lime, cumin, and a bit of roast. The finish has a light bitterness and leaves a lingering curry spiciness. Light-medium bodied. Low carbonation. Certainly an interesting beer. It is dominated by the spices. I found it enjoyable, but could see how some would not like it."
"O: I am going to go with a solid B+ on this one. It's certainly DIFFERENT than other stouts out there, but I like where they went with it. Obviously, if you don't like those flavors this one could be offputting to you."
"A meal beer, between the spices and roast flavors it is more like food. Fresh spice flavors are very nice. Lime cocoa interplay is cool. A beer that is surely love and hate between different people."
"Overall: Interesting is the only way I can describe this beer. If you like indian food you will like this beer but it seems to me to be a bit of a strech for a beer."
"I'm happy to have had a chance to try this one, but I would not seek it out again."
"After sampling this beer a couple times from the tap, and then eventually out of the bottle, it easily became one of my favorite new releases of 2011. That being said, I would always want help from a few friends when opening a 22oz. bottle."
"Black with a 1cm light brown head. Medium retention and light lacing. "
"Overall this is a very Cool amazing different kind of beer very well executed. Don't drink this if you Don't like Curry, Cumin, Thai and or Indian food because you won't like this. Its a great, fun beer. A must try if you like these kind of flavors!"
"O: A spicy porter, pretty much what I figured. A fun beer to try."
"O: Kind of a funky beer/idea. Decent execution of it."
"O - This is good as a one off beer release. A nice experiment. If it was a regular release, I wouldn't buy it more than once. I'm glad I tried it, and it was interesting and decent, but I wouldn't try it again. Take out the cayenne and this might be a completely different story."
"O - I don't like this at all. It does have some redeeming factors, but I couldn't drink 2oz of this beer."
"Overall: A very unique beer. I don't think I could drink a bottle solo, but a wonderful experience. Followed it up with homemade indian food. A perfect pairing."
"Poured into Duvel Tulip, near black with brown head, decent retention. Smell is heavy on the cumin, and cayenne, can't really get past the spices on the aroma. Medium to Light-Medium body, decent carbonation. Taste is cumin, cayenne, curry spices, burnt dark chocolate, peppery. I don't get any coconut, but a tad bit of the lemongrass. There is definately some spicyness here. Would not be able to drink a lot of it, but it is a fun brew."
"Pours a near-black brown, thin light tan head with no lacing and not much retention. Smell is lots of curry spice, baker's chocolate, and bitter coffee. Taste is tamarind, turmeric, black pepper, and smoky malt. I'm not picking up any of the supposed coconut in the smell or taste (nor did anyone else in our group). Light bodied and medium-high carbonation, alcohol is not really noticeable. Overall, bonus points for the novel interpretation of the style. This was actually pretty drinkable despite the unusual flavor; although I didn't love it, it's not one of those beers that you can only drink a taste of. I'm intrigued as to the possibilities of food pairings with this."
"Poured into a ~4 ounce sample glass in the brewery’s tasting room. This beer poured a very dark brown with a nice touch of tan head that clings to the corner of the glass. The aroma is very unique. Coconut is probably the most prominent smell as well as some lightly roasted dark malts. There is a definite spiciness to the aroma but I would not have identified it as curry had I not known. Tastes spicey and dry. The curry is definitely present but melds well with the rest of the beer. Coconut is pretty big. At 9% there is no surprise that there is a significant booziness. Its a bit too boozy to be very drinkable which hurts the beer a bit but well carbonated and the strong coconut is really pleasant to me. Definitely a well crafted beer that combines flavours I never expected to see used in brewing!"
"T: Lots of curry upfront with some coconut following. The finish brings a bit of roasted malts and powdered chocolate. I didn't think this beer was going to work, but somehow they pulled it off. Not sure I would want a full pint of this, but I'm glad I got to try it."
"I think a taster is the correct serving size for this beer. Though I could handle up to a half pint, if there were a touch more coconut. Very unique beer which I would consider buying if/when it gets bottled for Holiday Wine Cellar."
