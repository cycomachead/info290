"A decent brew with a solid porter character but seems to be hard to discern style or one that seems distinct."

"330 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/7/2008. Pours hazy fairly pitch black color with brown edges, with a 1 finger dense tan head with goof retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, plum, dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, light smoke, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of dark/roasted malt, light licorice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, coffee, raisin, molasses, light smoke, light licorice, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, light smoke, light licorice, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors, light licorice, and yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Baltic porter! All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, licorice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"On-tap at Oblivion in Orlando. Pours a dark black color with a tan head. The aroma is dark as smokey with licorice and chocolate. The taste is smooth up front and turns very roasty with a lot of smoke with bitter coffee and cocoa flavors in a bitter finish. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. Definitely recommended!"
"At The Birch Bar in Norfolk, they have it on tap. If you like Imperial Stouts drink this. The Licorice is not a overpowering flavor. It sit in the back to darken the brew and strengthen the Imperial presents. Don't know what it taste like from a bottle just draft is alway far mores balanced an reserve than is over carbonated cousin. Enjoy"

"Very nice beer. Satisfying, complex and all round well done."
"O- A really nice beer, very flavorful but nothing too aggressive, easy to drink and a great bargain at 15 kr (less than $3)."

"Overall: A very nice beer (more Foreign Export Stout than Baltic Porter, but having elements of both styles) that has a range of subtle flavors"

"Well, it was soured and probably a bit old, so take my opinions with a grain of salt, but it's a porter so it should survive (although an 08, if it was one, would be pushing it), and the infection would've been present (if subdued) at time of bottling."
""
"O: Overall very enjoyable, I like the dark chocolate flavors mixing with a touch of licorice. Very nice."
""

"Needs to go under another style like many beers misidentified in the Baltic Porter style. A good Export Stout from Denmark."
""
"O- True to style beer, Nothing special or unique, easy drinking and enjoyable."
""
"O-- Nice beer. True to style. Not overbearing in any way at all. No gaps or issues with this at all. Alcohol is well hidden and a lot of character to this. Would try this again if got the chance."
""
"O: This is a very, very nice light smoked porter - me like!"
"MF is reasonable."
"Fresh and fruity, devious strong. The added licorice is not noted by me."
"Starts creamy and nearly full-bodied, finishes somewhat dry with a light coating of the palate. Medium-bodied at the finish. Light effervescence throughout. This beer is like a cross between a rauchbier and a Baltic porter, two of my very favorite styles. I like it a lot. I could easily imagine drink several of these sitting around a campfire with the temp hanging in the 40's or low 50's F, eating meat cooked over that fire. Aftertaste has an earthy/peaty/smoky note with a hint of black licorice creeping in especially as it warms."
"Whoa, character up the wazoo! I let the bottle warm up out of the fridge. Poured with a magnum sized foamy, frothy, fluffy, billowy, sudsy, tan head and lots of clingy lace. Color is an absolutely opaque black brown. Aroma is complex with licorice, dark ripe fruit, roast malt, earth, musty, old leather, gin, cocoa. Flavor is similar but also is quite dry with only a suggestion of possible sweetness if you're being good; plus a little salty tang, leftover coffee, unsweetened cocoa. Body is full, carbonation is spot on and the overall effect is just perfect for this beer. Finish is like flavor with the extremes diminishing first and softer components tapering later in a fairly lengthy process. Too big for a session, but what a work of art!"
"actually rather standard artisan baltic porter that i've run into in poland. nice licorice notes... nice smoke. a meaty quality. something that i know to be baltic porter. pour is coca cola brown to black. nose of an equal blend of licorice and smoke. hints of mineral subdued acidity. palate is hunger inducing and quite dry... some chalk and molasses notes. the licorice sets a nice complex sweet that is post fermentable. a nice herbal zing like fennel. excellent blend with the smoke and molasses."
"Super drinkable, very nuanced and enjoyable beer. Would definitely try and get more."
"11.2 oz. olive green bottle, this ""double brown stout"" is brewed with ""liquorice."" Jet-black, fairly clear, with a half-inch, dark tan head that retains a foamy collar. The aroma is big and roasty/chocolatey; bold, yet supple, gently hinting and the huge burst of flavor to come. Strong roasted and dark coffee flavors meld with bitter chocolate, light licorice, and a mild bitterness contributed by both the hops and the dark grains. The alcohol is well-hidden here, and the body is lighter than it should be, but somehow gives the impression of bigness. Quite easy to drink, and very assertive with its long roasted finish, but it is a bit too punchy for prolonged quaffing."
"Limfjords Porter (Double Brown Stout) is a pitch black liquid with a huge, soft, bistre colored head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It's a unique look. It has a huge aroma of smoke and ash. It smells like a camp fire. It's medium bodied and a bit metallic. The finish is a bit watery and it leaves the tongue dry and a bit numb. It tastes like it smells: smoke and ash. There's a hint of licorice sweetness at the finish. The aftertaste has a lingering bitterness like baking chocolate. The bottle didn't say anything about smoke. In a blind tasting, I'd probably guess this as a smoked Baltic porter. It's very unique."
"Lately I have been on a Baltic porter kick,time to try this Danish one new to my area.Poured nearly pitch black except for a few deep ruby highlights when held to the light,a 1/2 finger light mocha colore head atop that qas gone quickly.Aromas of bitter chocolate,heavy dark fruit,and has some medicinal-like notes.Thick and chewey feel wich is nice,somewhat boozy with that licorice more prominent on the palate,dark fruit and molasses round out the flavors.A somewhat sweet Baltic porter but there is a decent earthy drying effect in the finish,usually I dont like medicnal flavors,and I dont like black licorice,but I really like this beer."
"I've had this style of porter from just about every country in Eastern and Northern Europe and this Danish example fairs very well in comparison with its compatriots. While there are better examples out there, to be sure, Thisted Bryghus' version is worth laying some dough on; this is definitely one that I'll be picking up if I ever do come across it again."
"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Smoke/licorice nose. Flavor is smoke and unsweetened licorice. Dry finish. Not the typical Baltic porter. Expensive at $7.95 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"This isn't stunning but unique enough to give it a shot, super easy to drink stout."
"Drinkability: Quite decent but I think this one's quite over rated."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink; you could either sip it if you want to appreciate the flavors or drink it quickly because the alcohol is very well masked. I would definitely have another one of these!"
"Overall this is a solid beer for the style and the mild spices give it another added layer. Worth a shot."
"D: Would get this again and again...almost a rausch beer."
"Overall, I enjoyed this but found it was just a bit of a let down that a pretty beer like this just didn't deliver a knockout flavor."
"I'm a big fan of Scandinavian beers and this one didn't disappoint. Well-balanced and quite tasty."
"This is a very good beer. It is highly unique for the baltic porter style, it is more of an american styled porter. It is sweet and decadent but perhaps not so much as the common baltic porter. But it is a nice balanced imperial style porter worth picking up."
"Overall: 3.15"
"D: An incredibly drinkable Baltic Porter. Definitely worth a shot."
"D- Be it a stout or a porter, this was a great beer. I will definitely pick up some more of these!"
"The taste won't disappoint. There are lots of smoked and peaty flavors to this beer, almost mossy in taste, but quite good. There is lots of molasses, brown sugars, charred notes, slightly cherry dark chocolate, and loads of sweet malts. This is a very complex and full palated beer. It has warming alcohol notes, a touch of ABV in the throat, some drying and hop notes towards the finish to balance this out. This is a very full bodied beer, a very thick pour, with a very oily coating on the tongue. The aftertaste is pronounced but the charred flavors don't linger longer than they need to. This beer is well worth seeking out. This is a special beer. L'Chaim."
"I wish I had grabbed a couple of these as this is quite tasty and enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel was very smooth, almost like velvet, as crosses the palate and reaches the throat. Very happy with this offering. Big thanks to the guys down at Charleston Beer Exchange and to the boss lady!"
"11.2 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Date on bottle reads 01/07/09. Aroma is dominated by a coffee/sweet malt flavor. High ABV is nicely masked by the lovely flavors of the beer. Taste seems to lean more towards a porter then a ""double brown stout"". Coffee, licorice, toasted malts dominate the taste. Feels like a milk stout in a creamy sort of way. Yummy beer, all around...nicely complimented my bananas foster dessert."
"Yum! An interesting brew that is labeled both as a ""Double Brown Stout"" and ""Porter"". Which is it? A mix of strong brown, stout and Baltic Porter, I'ld say - and one that works well. An interesting, flavourful beer!"
"Drinkability - very drinkable. Surprisingly so given the high alcohol content."
"The taste is unbelievably smooth with a smoked and dark malt character. Coffee and dark chocolate are in the back ground. The mouth feel is great with a nice smooth ice cream coating on the tongue. Overall this is a good porter. I think I might liike Sinebyrchoff better purely on taste... but appearance, mouth feel are top notch on this one."
"Overall a very nice beer. Baltic porter has never been a favorite of mine, but this is a beer I would buy repeatedly."
"D: I wasn't sure what to expect when the label says both ""Double Brown Stout"" and ""Porter"". I thought this was interesting and enjoyed the spice and the smokiness."
"Okay, I like most flavors in beer, but the one direction I don't like is band-aid. This beer is rife with it. Like a few Belgians that exhibit this flavor, this seems intentional instead of an infection. Unlike those particular Belgian beers, this one seems more an accident of combined flavors than the result of any funkiness. I'm a huge licorice fan, and I like some peat in the glass as well, but the combination here of the strong licorice and strong peat here tastes just like band-aid to me here- and I don't like it at all. I could be wrong, and it could just be infected, but this is not a bottle that's been lingering on a shelf somewhere, the abv is relatively high, and there is no excuse for it and I'll judge accordingly. The pour is nice, black and viscous with a tan head that fades to a thin ring. That viscosity, though is a little unsettling in the mouth. Very thick and almost slick in the mouth. The smell has a bit of that band-aid smell, that grows as it warms. Beyond that, roasty, very peaty and licorice dominate. The taste has that same flavor, especially on the finish. Before that is some very earthy licorice and strong peat- and then tragedy. I won't be having this again."
"For a smoke beer, extra points for the fact that after I finished this beer, I really, really wanted another. Top notch."
"Overall, really solid but nothing out of the universe. Would have no trouble revisiting this brew."
"Bottle at home ... Deep black ... no head ... deep roast chocolate and toasted malts ... over fizzzy ... smooth toasted roast malts... little sweetness ... quite a bit of chocolate ... gentle bitterness ... medium carbonation ... medium body .. pretty decent."
"I think this is really a smoked porter or damn close to it. It deserves to be sipped at close to room temperature allowing you to enjoy the full complexity of this beer. I'll have to remind myself to get more of this fine brew at my next visit to Denmark."
"Nicely done beer. If you like the flavor of a good specialty coffee you will like this beer."
"This beer pours (be careful) black with brown head that will last! The smell is of toasty hops. This is definitely a stout porter. The 7.8% is most noticeable in the aroma, which is sweet and mainly of the malt. The taste is smooth and complex with a very pleasing aftertaste that is worth a trip to Denmark. This has a very heavy mouthfeel that lasts and for that reason it is less drinkable than a light lager. Very, very pleased!"
"This is becoming one of my favorite beers from Denmark and I will continue to bring at least a bottle or two home from each visit if I can."
"A very Danish porter (or a Double Brown Stout as they call it): Lower body than the British/Baltic version, more bitterness, more carbonation and more alcohol."
"A pretty good example of the style and one which I wish we could get around here."
"Smoky, ashy aroma is a mix of BBQ and cigarette butts. Roasty malts beneath that, but I dont really get any coffee, chocolate, raisin, prune or licorice. Body is deep black with a bubbly but fluffy two finger thick mocha head. Fore is a bit watery. Not thin just not flavorful. Bitter and burnt malts follow and bring some welcome flavor that includes esspresso and bakers chocolate. very charred and burnt like firewood-in the finish. Different, but not something Im enamored with."
"Thanks Madsberg."
"High drinkability. Complex enough to sip, but light enough to have a couple."
"Very foamy medium off-white head tops a dark brown body. Appealing chocolate and licorice nose. Meaty, smoky, roasty, vegetal. Intense licorice flavor in that one though they managed to keep a restrained sweetness level. Once again feels rather vegetal. Nice chocolate/coffee roastiness. I cant find anything bad to say about this no-weakness brew, a greatly blended baltic porter. Huge props to Per!"
"Notes of black licorice, smoked malts, roasted malts and a long, lingering finish of coffee, chocolate and wood. Quite tasty and rare. I am glad Ungstrup shared this with me."
"This bottle that i am drinking is two weeks from being one year old. It has a pitch black colour with a large brownish head. The head disappears quickly though. The smell is smokey and malty. Some hints of licorice and alcohol too. It has a lovely smokey taste, malty too and hints of coffee and licorice. The aftertaste leaves you with a long smokeiness in your mouth. You can not taste the high alcohol in this beer, so be careful when drinking it. I have found a new favourite beer."
"Named a ""double brown stout"" by the brewery (stout and porter in Denmark is more or less the same thing), this is indeed a robust one. Distinct smoked flavour, hints of coffee, dark chocolate, liqourice and spices. Maybe an aquired taste, I like, no - LOVE,  this beer more every time I drink it."
