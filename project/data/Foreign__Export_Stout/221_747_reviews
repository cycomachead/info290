"Exceptional sweet tasting stout, a nice alternative to Guiness Foreign."
""
"But a great stout."
"Even so, I don't mind it at all. And the nose is probably one of my favourites."
""

"Very affordable import in rather small bottles. Not bad, not great either."
"O: OK but the aroma and flavor don't match the quality of the look and feel."

"brought back from JA - expiration date 01 Nov 15.  pours a dark, dark brown with a tan head, medium-low carbonation.  faint smells of roasted malt, brown sugar and dark chocolate, but not an overly aromatic brew.  sweeter on the palate, with dark caramel malts leading the attack, plus something that makes me think of rum cake, and some chocolate on the finish.  less roasted than Guinness foreign extra; boozier, too, but that may be from the pronounced sweetness.  could make an interesting beer float with this one, but too sweet for me to want more than one 284 mL bottle.  don't think they have much diversity when it comes to beer down on the island, so i could see reaching for this one after a few days of red stripe."

"Small format 300 ml bottle poured into a Guinness glass. A dark blackish brown, opaque and with a decent amount of light tawny brown head that breaks quickly. Micheal Lewis includes detailed tech specs for this beer in his Classic Beer Style Series book on Stout. Of note, t. his beer contains caramel coloring and brewer's corn syrup (ugh) and the brewer saw fit to note that the beer employs a ""special beer flavoring extract"" for flavor maturation. Um, what the fuck? That sounds sinister but I suppose it could mean almost anything, including adding soured or otherwise aged beer to fresh batches. In any event, my expectations were not terribly high and perhaps because of this, the beer exceeded them. Aroma includes the expected coffee and chocolate elements but there is also a distinct graininess that comes off like cheap six-row malt and a fruity character that comes off a bit like tart red wine and cherry syrup. This tartness carries over onto the palate as well, a vinous character that I've encountered in other stouts and porters here and there. Not unwelcome amidst the smoky caramel and chocolate milk flavors, maybe a little molasses. Comes off as overly attenuated with the body too thin and the carbonation too high. Finishes rather grainy and astringent, almost a low grade alcohol burn. The sweetness becomes cloying quite quickly and this could be one of the sweetest stouts I've sampled to date. Still, not undrinkable and a good example of the style from a non-craft island brewery."

"Dragon Stout poured a very dark cola brown that was impervious to light, with about 1.5” of bubbly tan head which quickly faded to a thin collar of foam, leaving some modest lacing down the glass. Its aroma was a mix of the good and not quite so good…a sweet chocolate milk with a not so pleasant herbal smell thrown in for good measure. Luckily the flavour was more pleasant than the aroma, a boozy sweet chocolate milk with a hint of dark roasted coffee..quite nice though not as flavourful as most North American stouts. Almost no bitterness to this beer. The carbonation was soft as you would expect from a stout, detectable more at the back of the throat than on the tongue, and the beer had a creamy mouth feel. I would call this brew medium bodied on balance, and reasonably priced at $2.00 per 300 ml bottle. Overall, not bad, and given the climate in which it is normally consumed I can understand why this beer is not as rich as its North American counterparts."

"This is a very serviceable export stout. Not the best ever, but quite tasty nonetheless."

"From what I know stouts are very common in the Caribbean, and this is a good example of a native stout. Jamaica produces sugar, coffee, spices and molasses. All of these are present in this beer, it reminds me of time at the resorts in Jamaica."
"Would order again, if say i was skipping a meal while vacationing."

"Deep, dark brownish, almost black in color. The beer has a thick, blanket-like head. Its aroma is average... A hint of malt, some roasted grains, and a touch of alcohol. The taste is very sweet...think continental European stout. Sweet, with a little spice..cloying at times, with a fleshy fruitiness. Dark. The finish is moderately balanced with some bitterness, which just prevents cloying. Still, the beer is creamy and full, and satisfying."
""
""
"A pleasant, well-flavoured export stout, the malt running rampant here, to a certain degree. Traditional, warming, and pretty drinkable. I'd sure like to get a bottle of island Guinness FES to compare side by side with this."

"Picked this up at Turnpike Wine & Spirits in Oak Ridge, TN as part of a pick and choose assortment of porters and stouts. Didn't know anything about it but took notice of it the minute I poured it in the glass. The appearance was excellent and the head was perfect. The taste was most excellent, chocolate and coffee present. The creamy texture was the icing on the cake. This is the best stout I've ever had."
""
"O- Interesting and decent. The depth in flavor was more than I was expecting, but the oiliness was a bit off. I don't know if I could drink more than the 9.6 oz. in one sitting."
"O- overall a good no frills stout that's a good session beer"
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a tan head. In the aroma, a mellow coffee like maltiness. In the taste, a small alcohol presence and a mellow roasty maltiness. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel with a small dry roasty malt, with coffee and caramel like aftertaste. Mellow yet a boozy taste. A nice mix of coffee and caramel malts."
"Overall - decent stout, but very sweet and missing some bitterness to cut through and make this even better."

"Strong and sweet beer with good depth of flavour and a lot going on with it. A good beer to drink and one that despite the hints of alcohol also went down very easily. Probably not quite as good as Lion Stout but certainly a beer I would have again should the opportunity arise."

"This was much better than I'd anticipated - I definitely preferred it to Nigerian guinness which is probably the closest thing I've had - it didn't have the unpleasant lactic sourness of the guinness. Unfortunately the well-balanced flavour profile wasreally let down by excessive carbonation."

"sit back and be prepared for a total mouth orgasm."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer almost succeeds as a tropical version of stout. But its flimsy middle palate and finish allows the beer to fall apart and expose harsher and mild artificial taste. Still, it's the best product that I've yet to try from the makers of Red Stripe."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For a tropical foreign stout this is on still. Sweet, estery and balanced."
""
"Overall, not really the best foreign stout I have had. It is almost like it needs more hops to balance out the sweetness. Also, the flavors are just not very pronounced. Really not something worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: When I first looked at this beer, I thought that a stout from Jamaica would be awful. However, Desnoes & Geddes seem to me to be the best of Caribbean beer. I wouldn't say it's epicly good, but it's certainly worth seeking out."
""
"Pretty nice and enjoyable stout. Traditional profile, and does that quite well. Dryness on the end is good. Not the best I've had, but still a really good brew that deserves a try."

"Overall - Sweet, but not overly so for me. I was skeptical about a stout in the tropics, but I found it to be actually very refreshing. Much more so than I would have imagined it could be. One of those beers that I think directly represents where it is brewed. Might seem too sweet or unbalanced if I were drinking it at home in New England, but perfect for the location and climate of Jamaica."
"During the afternoon I wandered down the beach and sampled other very tasty Jamaican products in a beach shack with some locals. Very nice and also recommended for visitors. All in all, Dragon was part of my perfect Jamaican buzz."

"O - better than average but below great. I would say gaverage!"
""
""
""
"Not a bad brew and better than I anticipated. Very low hop profile and sweet yet it works somehow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent but very sweet. It has no roasted malt character or hop bitterness. Easy drinking, and has a pleasing texture. I probably wouldn't want more than one in a sitting, as it's a little cloying, but quite drinkable and makes a change from your typical strong stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Pretty drinkable, this was a nice beer that had a lot of sweet flavors to it and a pretty decent abv. I liked it, I just wish the bottle was a full 12-16oz."
"A decent option instead of Guinness, when you want something a little stronger and roastier (i.e. like a stout)."
""
""
""
""
"salud!"
"This poured out as a deep brown color with a foamy tan head on top. The smell of the beer had some coffee notes to it with a light chocolate aroma as well. The taste of the beer had some brown sugar sweetness along with a roasted dry finish. The mouthfeel was thin, I felt it could have used a little more body. Overall this stout was interesting. I would try it again if the mood struck me."

"O - This is my second time drinking this beer, and I can definitely say that it's a proper foreign stout! Rich and creamy, warming and delightful. I honestly wouldn't expect so much out of a Jamaican beer! Would make an excellent after-dinner drink!"
"Final Grade: 3.31, a B-."
"Definitely the best Jamaican beer I have thus far enjoyed!"
"Nice creamy but, short lasting head. A deep rich chocolate malt taste Crisper aftertaste than most Stouts. Since this is a foreign export Stout, I'd be curious to know what the Jamaicans keep for themselves! ( A Guinness for example tastes much different in Dublin than in New York; I know from experience!)Surprisingly smooth for 15 Proof! (I'm old school)(In fact, I'll explain for those who don't know... Proof is an older measure of ethanol in a beverage. In the U.S. Proof = 2x the ABV of a liquid.)"
" O – A nice example of the style balanced on the sweeter side of the spectrum."
"O - Not too bad at all, it's a fairly drinkable higher ABV stout that's incredibly roasted and earthy in nature."
"Overall- Smell is lacking, and the taste is more than lacking as well not to mention the watered down mouth feel. This is just not a stout for me in any way shape or form. Probably would not get this one again and definitely would not go anywhere out of my way to acquire it, I mean if I’m ever in Jamaica I would drink it again over the other adjunct garbage that is probably served there but this one is just not for me with so many other great choices around."
"O: This didn’t seem like a stout to me. Tasted more like a dark ale. It wasn’t bad but I probably won’t buy it again."
"Overall – I found the levels of carbonation a little too high and that the beer was more like a dubbel than a stout. The alcohol was well hidden and it was fairly light on the palette. I’m happy I gave this one a try."
"Taste is smooth and the sugar comes through here. Light on carbonation. I have served this almost as a desert, well certainly with desert (chocolate / cherry). This is almost a port replacement."
"D: Id go back to this beer after another as long as they get that copper taste out. Could have been a bad batch after not cleaning the lines or using that metal spoon. Also the Red Stripe style of a small bottle makes this easy to go back to back on."
"D. A thoroughly enjoyable Caribbean stout. I particularly enjoyed the finish."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a sampler glass at a beer festival. From notes: Pours a clear dark brown color with a medium tan head. Decent head retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet dark malty notes, sweet coffee and a faint roastiness. The taste is very sweet and almost sugary, with notes of coffee and faint roasty notes. Very faint hops and nearly no bitterness at all. Sweet, almost to the point of being cloying. Medium bodied."
"Black, deep ruby highlights in the light, light tan/off white head. Smell is malty, lactic notes, some coffee and baking chocolate and alcohol notes throughout. Taste is Roasted malt, faint alcohol, sweet milky notes, cocoa like notes and a bittersweet finish. Good feel and slightly high carbonation that works well here, full body and creamy at points. Drinks well, maybe a bit too sweet for me but would have one of these now and again though."
"Very dark, pours with small head that vanishes quickly. Roasted malt is dominant with coffee and chocolate tones. Little carbonation and light mouthfeel. Flavor is nice, maybe too sweet for my tastes but a decent milk stout. The high alcohol content (7.5%) would make me come back to try it again."
"O: Never again. Not a stout, and barely a dark ale."
"O - Very drinkable, though that 7.5% ABV could get away on you if you weren't careful! ;)"
"D - Overall, a tasty stout. I'm surprised a stout this good is Jamaican - I guess it is my ignorance that thinks of Red Stripe and Ginger Beer when thinking of Jamaican Beers."
"Black color beer. Quite dark too. Brown foamy head. Damn, the smell isn't good at all... surely not inviting... more strange but not in a good way. I get some chocolate and licorice with something else that make the smell bad. Taste is so light, it is sad. Some chocolate. No bitterness. This beer needs some work. Feels like water in the mouth."
"D: Two to four good sips and I've had enough of this one. This beer needs some lovin' from humulus lupulus. ie...stouts are best when balanced."
"D - Overall, a tasty stout and a pleasant surprise. I'm glad I went out of my way to find a bottle locally and it is definitely worthy to any stout fan. Higher ABV is nicely hidden, and although not the most thirst quenching beer in the Caribbean, and a tad thin, it is still a full flavoured stout worthy of sourcing out."
"The CPJ"
"OVERALL: B-/B"
"Drinkability: Pleasant if undemanding, alcoholic strength not obvious. Would definitely drink this again."
"D - easily drinkable but I would probably go for something with a stronger flavor."
"Poured a viscous black, with a finger or so of reddish brown head which falls to a collar. Little retention. Nose is some milky, creamy chocolate, some light coffee and sweet coconut, albeit a lesser contribution than the other two. Taste is relatively uneventful, some chocolate with a lactic creaminess. Mild dark fruits linger in the background. Mouthfeel is a bit weird and chalky, with active carbonation that's a bit high in my eyes. Medium drinkability."
"You win this round, Jamaica. Clearly I wasn't expecting such a sweet, drinkable stout, no less from the brewers that put forward Red Stripe, a passable but boring pale lager. Too sweet for everyday or session drinking, but if you're in the mood for something sweet to sip after dinner or to serve with dessert (and is cheap and regularly available), we've found your man. Despite the treatening name, this Dragon doesn't pose much of a threat - it's pretty tame, and just wants to like you and take you on cool adventures. Why not let it?"
"pours a dark cola brown with a finger of tan head which dies down to a few patches. Nose is an uninspiring mix of roasted malts, musty coffee and a hint of bakers chocolate. Taste follows suit with a healthy dose of dark fruits and a weird cola taste, chemical sugar sweetness, odd mineral dryness in the finish. Way too fizzy, too thin. I can imagine this is a welcome relief from all the light lagers in Jamaica but here there are too many other far superior beers to visit this one again."
"Pours dark black with a half inch of head that leaves lacing down the glass. The aroma is much lighter than I expected, sweet and aromatic. The flavor is also lighter than I would expect from a stout. It manages to be light and sweet at the same time, with just a hint of dark roasted malt, coffee and chocolate in the background. I would never guess from aroma and taste that this was 7.5% alcohol. I guess this is a good stout for a warm clime like Jamaica."
"D- This was an interesting go, and it's probably worth a try, but it won't be a regular purchase."
"I had this beer in Belize while on vacation, and was surprised to find it here in Mass. Clearly not a highly rated beer, but I was surprised by the wide range of reviews. For what it is, a Jamacian Stout, it is very sweet and drinkable. There is a nice alcohol finish mixed with a hint of malts. It certainly isn't a go to beer, but when compare to the beers available in Belize, its not a bad choice."
"D - I don't want to have anything to do with this ever again. I'll have a root beer if I want flavours like this. What a let down. I expected a rich stout, I got an overly sweet, boozy drink."
"Glad I tried this one but not something I will be revisiting unless I find it on tap or something..."
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/10/12/tasting-the-dragon-stout/"
"D) A delicious stout. I'd definitely have another one."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the carbonation is perfect to make the beer just a bit lively. There's a nice, sweet aftertaste with minimal hops or lingering roast. I can't wait to get back to Montego Bay again to have some Dragon. Just a fantastic beer, the taste of paradise for me."
"Drinkability is pretty damn good. A sweet, pleasing taste coupled with a great smell and a creamy feel make this brew eminently quaffable. Very well done and something I will keep a lookout for in the future."
"More of a looker than I remember. Seems well made with an excellent half inch light tan head which forms easily and goes the distance. Black with a fine cola light line at the bottom of the glass. Quite sweet and creamy are the dominant elements throughout. Chilled, the alcohol is well hidden but once the cool runnings are over it celebrates that heady 7.5% booze. Goes well with goat roti though."
"D: The light body of this beer makes it very drinkable during warmer months; the only thing that slowed me down in drinking it faster was the sweetness."
"Small bottle (284 mL) poured into a ommegang chalice. This has a thick dark appearance with a small amount of lacing on the head. Smell is very sweet with hints of raisins and brown sugar. Taste is also sweet, filled with sugar-covered raisins and plums. No roasted malt flavor and very sugary. Fairly thin-bodied for a stout. Excellent drinkability, however, as this goes down very easily."
"Pours opaque black with tan head and some lacing. Smell has a huge malty thing going on with some roast. There seems to be some type of odd smell as well, maybe some lactic syrupy sweetness. Taste is incredibly sweet, but there is something that is a bit sour there too. Body is a little bit thin. I still enjoy this beer and buy it sometimes."
"A really great example of an export stout solid brew to pick up if you see it around."
"D: It's good. Got the crack in it. Go-go-go back for more. Would go great with ""munchies"" foods, BBQ chicken. Not an upper-crust stout."
"A disappointing experience. I may revisit in the future."
"Inky black. Aroma of molasses and caramel. Sticky sweetness yet light enough to be quite drinakble...the molasses quality hides the alcohol here. Interesting that this sort of sweet, heavy beer doesnt cloy and I am able to drink a succession of these. Good with spicy food."
"I must add that i generally drink this beer warm because that's the way the locals drink it where i stay in Jamaica. Warm or cold it's always a treat for me."
"D: although the ABV is high for a regular ale, it's in keeping with a foreign/export stout, and the smaller serving size keeps this in check. In spite of its punch, this is a nice drinkable beer."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a deep dark brown not quite black with a small thin tan head that quickly goes into a thin film that has great lacing for a moment then it slids back into the beer. I found the aroma very enjoyable yet hard to describe. Sure the hint of roasted malt is there as well as an alcohol scent but there is also this milky sweet smell too and it made me want to take a sip. A very interesting taste too. Very thin for a stout and you can taste the alcohol pretty easy with hints of bitter chocolate and a background of sweetness. You can feel the carbonation more here than in most stouts and a slight burn of alcohol on the tongue. For a stout it almost seems waterd down but I enjoyed drinking it."
"d: Doesn't measure up to other export stouts, but it was better than I expected."
"D: As said, not undrinkable, but this particular bottle wasn't great. I'm not sure if something fresh would have a creamier body, or more malty flavour, and would like to try it again if I could find it with a more recent bottling"
"A worthy experience if you happen upon it, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"I think this is a good example of the style, and better than the scores indicate. Not the absolute top in the category, but at least equal, if not a bit better than Lion Stout IMO."
"I don't remember this being this sugary and sweet when I had it a few years ago in Jamaica. Slightly disappointed, but still happy to have this again."
"Pours a nearly opaque black-brown with about a half-finger of frothy ecru head. There's a small but good amount of lacing produced. The nose is quite faint; chocolate, coffee, and dark malts are all I really get olfactorily. The taste follows for the most part, though the coffee is decidedly subdued. The chocolate is lightly bittered, and the dark malts lean toward the wheaty side. The body is a strong medium, with moderate carbonation, a smooth feel, and a surprisingly dry finish. Overall, I wouldn't describe this brew as the best stout I've ever had, but it's still pretty tasty and highly drinkable."
"Not bad. Nothing exciting. Could drink a couple."
"D = Goes down very easily."
"Poured from a brown 284ml bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is of malts and chocolate.. Taste is very sweet, chocolate malts, alcohol, and finishing bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good quality beer."
"Pours almost black with excellent initial head. Smell is molasses with a hint of coffee...very inviting. Taste is malty...sweet, molasses...sugar..Alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is very smooth, almost syrupy..could almost be served slightly warmed. Smoothness and lack of harsh alcohol notes make this very drinkable."
"In general, I'm disappointed by this brew. It's not what I'm looking for from a stout."
"Would I buy more of it? - Umm...probably not, unless I was in Jamaica and I was already a little tipsy (or cwapfaced)."
"Labeled as an export stout, it seems to be a milk/sweet stout. Nose is huge in what I suspect to be lactose. It also has minor traces of coffee and hops. Taste is dominate by sweetness, followed with bits of coffee and chocolate character. Black/dark brown in color, tanned head doesn't offer much retension. As the beer warms, the alcohol becomes a bit more noticeable and dark fruit flavors start to come out."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a decent stout that is worth drinking for a while, but there are better ones out there."
"Well, this is an interesting beer, not at all as I would have expected. Definitely more of a quad/stout combo. Strange beer, I like it."
"D: Due to the overall sweetness and mid ABV this is a sipper... sit back and enjoy."
"Kind of thin and not overly syrupy but overall still too darn sweet to consume too many of these. Not a bad brew, I just would rather be sipping it with my feet in the sand on a beach in Jamaica."
"D - Excellent - I will be getting more whenever possible!"
" Sweet and malty with little complexity of flavor. Easy to drink warm or cold. Although my tongue discerns adjuncts(corn) this offering is a national(Jamaica)icon and a regional favorite. Very drinkable!"
"Full bodied with low carbonation. Creamy. Had this two or three years back and couldn't handle how sweet and chewy it was, but having it now, I think I like it a bit more. Still not something I'd want all the time though. It still gets progressively harder to drink the closer you get to the bottom of the glass. Cloying."
"The taste is maximally creamy. The is one of the creamiest stouts I've had. This is definitely full bodied, very sweet, almost lactose stout sweet, with lots of chocolate malts, honey molasses, and some roasted notes. There might be some cherry chocolate soda in there as well. There is definitely a throaty burn and lots of ABV with the beer. The beer is like oil on the tongue with a sweet buttery molasses residue in the mouth and beyond. This is a sipping beer for sure. It is quite good, is full palated, makes a strong statement. There isn't much hop, there isn't much roasted or charred notes to the beer, and it is very much tilted to the sweet creamy side of the ledger. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"D - very good at first but becomes slightly sickly after roughly 2/3s of the small bottle"
"I was ending the night with this beer but I think I'll have to dump it and have something I know is good to hopefully cleanse my mouth of this sickly sweet yuckfest. Or maybe I should just brush my teeth and cry myself to sleep. Blech."
"D: Too sweet, and the alcohol and bitterness on the end doesn't work for me. I wouldn't buy this again."
"It should also be noted that this beer is an amazing value. A sixer of this stuff will set you back $10 and change from the Liq-bo (CAD of course) which puts it on par with some of the macro cheapies. It's flavourful and unique, if a little one-dimensional, but should please casual drinkers and beer geeks alike. Plus its 7.5% which means it packs a serious punch. You don't need too many of these to get a buzz, if that's what you're after. Great stuff."
"D: A bit too sweet for me."
"D- I tried and could not do it, done after three ounces. Could only take tiny sips. When i tried to take anymore my senses stopped me. Putrid. Sometimes it pays to live on the wild and adventurous side, but not in this case. Down the drain."
"Overall, the almost cloying sweetness, pronounced ABV and strange oily medicinal notes made this a pretty unenjoyable stout. I don't think I'll be buying another one of these any time soon."
"Aroma is fairly strong, smoky, oily and coffee-ish. Pours a dark chocolaty sable with a fairly thick but not too persistent beige head. Flavor is malty, smoky, and surprisingly sweet - but not cloying. There are hints of molasses and apple cider. Texture is quite smooth with just a little bit of a bite, and minimal fizziness. Not too shabby."
"Tastes like a Harpoon Chocolate Stout (good beer) except brewed with sewage water."
"D: For me it's slips down my throat with ease, but for those moving from regular dry stouts or Guinness, get ready for the taste to be full of sweetness."
"I have my fair share of critiques of the Dragon Stout - the exaggerated sweetness, the unmasked alcohol - but I've always felt to really know a beer and truly experience it at its best you must try it fresh in its native land. Unless Desnoes & Geddes want to pay my way to Jamaica I'll have to believe this is just an average foreign stout; it's not something I see myself drinking again here in Canada."
"Pours very dark brown, almost black with very little head. Smells sweet and milky, with caramel and cream and just a bit of dark fruit. Fairly simple, but well enough crafted. Tastes sweet, creamy and lightly fruity with a little ashiness on the finish. Smooth and simple, but actually quite delicious. I've always liked the sweet, strong stout tradition in the Carribean. It makes it a hell of a lot easier to get a tasty beer instead of your usual macro lager. This is my favorite Jamaican beer."
"Dragon Stout is a black ale with a thick, bubbly, caramel brown head that shows good retention and lacing. The aroma is slightly sweet, with notes of molasses and brown sugar. There seems to be a smokiness to it. It's pretty full bodied and very smooth. It is thick and chewy with a clean finish. It tastes very sweet and a little grassy. There are notes of rum and toffee. There is a slightly smoky note at the finish. It's nice, but very sweet. It's a good thing it's in such a small bottle."
"I had a few bottles of this last summer; aging the beer has definitely smoothed out some of the rougher edges I noticed at the time. It's a welcome change of pace from the more typical heavily-roasted examples of this style."
"Got this little bad boy at a small quick stop in Grand Cayman, right close to where they make the Tortuga Rum cakes. The beer had a very thick and fluffy head that lasted a good bit, then died out to a very thin laceing. The smell was of sweet malts and chocolate. Taste was similar, but very sweet, so sweet that it would be hard to drink a lot of these. I will say, this is a far cry from D&G's other beer, Red Stripe. I do like the Red Stripe, but this is stronger and sweeter. Overall not too bad, but nothing to get too excited about."
"Picked up a single for around two bucks at the Whole Foods in Cambridge. Poured into a tulip glass. Dark black color with a hint of brown at the edge of the glass. Good head, and nice lacing. Noticeable smell of roasted barley. Taste surprised me. Am I drinking a milk stout? Much sweeter than I expected. Good, but it caught me off guard. Alcohol is very well hidden also. A very easy beer to drink, but I would have preferred it after a meal as a nice dessert, if I had known."
"OVERALL: This one was a surprise. It was very solid, very enjoyable, and I would definitely have another. Like other export stouts this one would not be a good choice for a session, but I'd definitely have a few. It was very enjoyable right to the last drop."
"Pitch black beer with a rich thick slowly fading head.Aroma is cocoa.Taste is chocolate,molasses,cocoa ans alcohol on the back end.This is a very sweet pleasant tasting stout.I would recommend and buy again,although I doubt you could drink more than three of these at one sitting!!"
"Full bodied and mouth coating, this is one that I bought as a single, and it was enough to satisfy my curiousity and my stout fix (and in the crappy store I got it from, who knows how long this single has been around -- I think I got lucky). Somewhat different but enjoyable enough to give a shot. Worthy."
"Overall I'd say this is too sweet and sugary for my taste to have more than one."
"The aroma is sweet with candy, toasted malt, chocolate, and licorice. The appearance is dark brown with a small tan head. The taste is like the aroma meaning that it's sweet without much else to give it character. The palate is average at best. Overall not a great stout but certainly drinkable."
"Thanks to NASH for the bottle!"
"Not much bottle smell but the high AC seems evident, mªn. Pours to an opaque black with a tan head that is both macro bubble and creamy, mªn. Taste is sweeter than expected for a stout, not really prevelant in chocolate or roasted malts but more of a roasted cane molasses and chocolate syrup flavor, mªn. Carbonation is good but mouthfeel is thin for a stout, mªn. Hopping is there but doesn't come through bitter mªn. This is almost more like an HG dark brown english ale, more so than a stout, mªn. But its a good brew for the heat mªn."
"Poured from a 10 oz or so bottle. Pours a nice dark red almost black color with a tan creamy head. Smell is of sweet malts and alcohol. Taste is of the same, the alcohol is very pronounced in this beer. I mean, it's 7.5 ABV, but I've had things that were 11-12% that hid the alcohol better. Has a very rum like taste to it with the sugars and all. Basically its like a rum-beer, which is good if you're in the mood for that.. I'll pass on this in the future."
"Pours a medium shade of black with a deep red color along the sides. Their is a small tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves a ring along the outside of the beer. This has a huge roasted malt aroma with some cocoa and espresso notes to it as well. This is a sweet beer, the first thing that you taste is the sweet malt and then the alcohol taste kicks in. This one is tough to describe as their is a light burnt sugar taste and some cocoa and roasted flavors as well. This is a moderately carbonated beer and quite sweet which might make it to tough to drink."
"Served in a standard pint. Poured two shades shy of black with mahogany highlights around the edges. Half inch off-white head quickly dissipated into a thin ring around the shoulders within 30 seconds. No lacing on this one. Nose was alcohol, dark fruit and a trace of cocoa. Taste is a little difficult to describe. Flavors are consistent with nose, but a little too sugary sweet. Mouthfeel was light-boded and effervescent, but also a little syrupy. Interesting brew, but one was definitely enough."
"Cute little bottle. Pours very dark with a good, light brown head that retains decently. Smells of cocoa, a bit of roastiness, and over-ripe dark fruits. Taste is more over-ripe dark fruits ala figs, plums, raisins, etc. Over the top sweetness. Semi dry finish. Lightly carbonated. Alcohol warmth very present. Im not sure if I could drink more than one of these as it's somewhat of a chore to finish only one of these guys from a small 284mL bottle. Way too sweet, not in the good way like a Milk Stout either. Each sip makes me deliver a new face of anguish."
"This little bottle was poured into a small Great Lakes Christmas Ale Snifter. This Dragon was a soild midnight black. I checked, no ray of light could penatrate this beer's soild black bodied color. Sitting on top of this beer was a creamy 1 inch head of mocha colored foam. it had really good retention by leaving behind a mocha film, foamy rings, and a fair amount of mocha spots of lace around the glass. The aroma was very fruity with dark fruits like raisins and figs. But it was also slightly roasted at the same time. Roasted dark fruits was an interesting aroma to smell. The taste was also very fruity with the dark fruits, but this time there wasn't a roasted undertone. It was more fruity than anything else. The taste was sweet and fruity with raisins, figs, a tiny touch of sweet roasted malts, a smidge of sweet caramel, and then finished up with sweet yeast. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a sweet and fruity aftertaste of raisins, sweet roasted malts, caramel, and more yeast. This had to be the most fruity and sweet Stout I've ever had before. Not bad at all. I wouldn't have mind a bigger bottle of Dragon Stout."
"Thanks to RblWthACoz for the brew."
"*2nd Note: I was with 2 Jamaican co-workers who 'carry'."
"Had this one out of Hyland24's stash, poured from a bottle to a pint glass. It poured Black with a brown head that settled quickly. There was no aroma of note on this one for me but the taste was superb. Brown sugary and malty taste with a warm alcohol finish. The sweetness sticks to my mouth and the light (surprising) carbonation clings a bit but in a good way. I was pleasantly surprised by this one and look forward to having more. I am feeling ""Irie"" after just one, the 7.5 APV is sneaky good."
"MF&D- I enjoyed the taste much more out of the bottle than the pint glass for some reason. My buddy Nasty came to the same conclusion. Also found its better colder which is unusual I find for a stout. Beware these go down smooth and could lead to shots fired."
"Very atypical of the genre though possibly an attraction for some. Though not an expert on stouts this pales in comparison to something like Guinness export strength. Can't say that I'd recommend it though definitely worth a try."
"D: A tad to sugary would be an understatement. Imagine a cup of cold coffee with 10 teaspoons of sugar added, if that's your thing then this is your beer, otherwise keep your glucose meter handy."
"MF&D - The carbonation tingled my tongue. This stout was full bodied and the sweetness coated my mouth big time. The 7.5% ABV assured pleanty of alcoholic warmth. You may be tempted to session this one, but be careful, or the Dragon may sneak up on you."
"D: Easy on the palate, but the carbonation & alcohol is a little high."
"Pours very dark with a thin tan head. Flavor has a nice very mild bitter side to it and a fuller smooth sweet edge. Milky in a way. Seems to be some molasses on there as well. Feel is very smooth on the liquid and the lower carbonation is still nicely noticeable. I think this is a great stout. Very easy to drink and it carries a nice smooth and sweet edge. Pretty darn good I say! Makes me happy to see this at the bodega down the street (the smell of spilt and rotten milk's gotta go though)."
"Drinkability is average. It is thin, which I guess is good for such a warm weather climate in Jamaica. The taste is strong, so it may be rough drinking more than a couple of these."
"This is a pretty tasty stout that actually tastes alot like a milk/sweet stout. Poured up black as ink with a khaki/light brown head. Looked good; just as I'd hoped. Smell was nothing like I had expected. It actually had a bit of a BMC smell, but not too bad. I was surprised to find little or no ""typical stout"" aromas here. Ah well... Taste was quite nice, and that's what matters most. It's sweet and malty, but unlike any other stout I have ever had. Good, but rather strange. Mouthfeel was much too thin for my tastes and too much carbonation, as well. Overall, it's somewhat drinkable and not a bad stout at all."
"I tried this beer because it was readily available in a West Indian neighborhood not far from my home. I actually do not mind driving 20 minutes to pick up this brew whenever the urge hits,and it provides a good buzz with a smooth taste. Good beer for it's style."
"Overall it's not terrible, but not a great stout in my opinion."
"Drinking it was pretty enjoyable. It was mellow (mouthfeel wise) and the taste was semi-chocolatey but not overpowering. I'd drink it again, just not often."
"D: Simply too sweet, with no bittering to balance this out. It's cloying nature makes this a ""1 and no more, thanks"" beer."
"D: Not heavey which makes it go down easy for a 7.5%. However the mouthfeel and over sweetness brings this down in relation to its style."
"D: Super drinkable stout. Even at the 7.5% I could have another."
"This one started off well with the appearance and the nose, but is too sweet with an unusual fruitiness for me."
"Not very impressed. If you're going to go Jamaican, go Red Stripe"
"Drinkability: I can't conceive of myself ever giving this beer another go."
"drinkable?: NO, i did not find it to be anywhere near a beverage, it is a marinade at most."
"Pours a four-finger light brown head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Midnight black color. Molasses nose. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is sweet molasses but not cloying with a clean finish. Nice sweet stout but not a five like I thought it was last century. 284ml bottle $1.75 from Kappy's Fresh Pond Jamaica Plain, MA."
"I was quite a bit shocked by how much I enjoyed this one. Never underestimate Jamaica's ability to brew a dark beer."
"I tried this beer on September 14, 2007 at 'The Beer Bistro' in Toronto. The beer poured a very dark brown into the glass with a thin tan head. The aroma was a combination of malts, coffee and caramel. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, silky, with no apparent carbonation. The flavour was a combination of malt and fruit...cherry like."
"Cola dark when poured, black, coffee. Brown head, half finger with good retention. There's very lively carbonation when held under a bright light, most below the surface. Smells of caramel apple, or fresh hard candies in a dish. Sweet Tia Maria coffee taste, yeast, with a lingering aftertaste of black cherry. I found the taste developed in the glass, at first quite sweet, then an odd flash sour. Mouthfeel got syrupy as it warmed, taking away from the overall attractiveness of this Jamaican stout and it got a bit sweet for my liking. I really liked the way the flavours alternated, almost sweet and sour at times and then the strong blue mountain coffee influence. Well worth a try."
"D- O MY GOD at 7.5% I guess 6 would be great but I was pretty happy after 4. I would pick this one up again. There are other ptions but this one is flavorful and it's not your run of the mill garbage (AKA GUINESS)"
"Tasty and drinkable, goes well with a cigar."
"Dragon Stout pours a jet black with a thin brown head from a brown 284 ml bottle. A bit of roasted malt, perhaps a bit estery as well in the aroma which leaves a bit to be desired. The flavor is interesting, I really prefer dry stouts to this style, it seems quite sweet and/or estery or both at once, also some roasted malt flavors. Body is on the thin side. Alcohol is strong, warming is noticeable. Not really my thing, but definitely worth a try."
"Pours quite dark, with ruby highlights glinting around the edges of the black body, and a fairly deep tan head that lasts pretty well and leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is a touch sour, with alcohol showing prominently and the roasted aromas of chocolate and coffee being overpowered. Taste is equally muddled, though the opening flavours are pleasant. Quite sweet up front, the chocolate coming through well until the sourness and alcohol come through in the finish and wash it out. Mouthfeel is quite thin and lacks carbonation, and drinkability is hampered by the poor finish. Not very good, but has some character that might recommend it to some."
"This is a nice brew and my favourite of anything I sampled in Jamaica. Note to all: anytime I saw this brew be it in individual bottles or in a six pack, it was priced significantly lower than the uber-popular Red Stripe, likely because they know that most Americans are going to want all Red Stripe all the time while in Jamaica. That said, while the price on the Red Stripe was still fairly reasonable, it meant the price of the Dragon Stout was excellent (something like just under a buck a bottle when buying singles, and this was at the ""grocery store"" at our resort, where everything was pricey). You can't complain when the best beer on the island is also the cheapest. Well worth a bit of an extra effort to find in Jamaica and still a nice stout to have at home in the States as well..."
"D - Excellent - I will be getting more!"
"Purchased this last November in Jamaica. Poured into a pint glass. Large 2 finger tan head present after an aggressive pour - typical dark brown to black color with intense lacing, but pour is a little thin for my liking. The smell is odd - sweet and chalky; none of the typical stout scents i.e. coffee, chocolate, or roasted character. Taste is not balanced at all - way too sweet with very little hop or malt balance, however, I could see why this would be brewed this way since the vast majority of people would be drinking this in 90 degree heat, The mouthfeel is rich, creamy, and coats the mouth; it's very nice. This is just way too sweet for me - the lack of balance is off putting as well. Recommended if you're in Jamaica, otherwise no need to search out."
"Appearance was a nice typical dark stout with good head. Flavour had some roasty notes, but mostly just sickly sweet. Mouthfeel was ok, but this stout was just way too sweet for me. The alcohol was hidden nicely. Would be a good substitute for chocolate sauce on your ice cream- thats how sweet this was. No noticable hops either. Not worth trying again."
"drinkability is great. the sweetness is above average, but i enjoy it. balanced and enjoyable. that said, i think it's missing the style in many ways. there's almost no roast, and the sweetness and fruityness seems too high for the style. a very enjoyable beer, but it loses points for this."
"M&D - surprisingly smooth and palatable, very sweet and well bodied, a total surprise, and a good one, if i find more of this ill probably pick this up"
"This one was pretty drinkable, although the sweetness was too much for me to consider this one as session fare during winter in NW Ontario. My opinion might be 180 degrees different if was sitting on a hot beach in Jamaica however. There was a nice roastiness to this brew that makes it worth trying. It may also serve as a good stout try for the stout novices, as the sweetness may make it more approachable. Ill probably drink this one again, may make a good summer stout."
"I find this beer to be unbalanced, lacking in hops to balance all of the sugar. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. It's like liquid candy."
"Pours a dark ruby color and settles black with a pinky sized mocha colored head that is mostly lasting. The aroma holds molasses, raisins, sweet toasty chocolate and a light perfumey alcohol in fairly strong concentration. The fore is sweet raisin mash, brown sugar and molasses and that tastes rather Schwarzbier-like. Probably too sweet for some and solidly more a tropical stout, but is nice to my palate."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is barely carbonated. It manages to be creamy inspite of a rather thin body. The beer drinks ok overall. I wouldnt want to session this one."
"Overall - A pretty good stout.... recommended !!"
"Pours a dense dark brownish black with a three finger head that dissipates slowly. Aroma of chocolate and molasses. Tastes pretty much how it smells, but quite sweet and with a bit of alcohol bite. Nice lacing but too sweet for my liking and the finish is rough because of it."
"Pours a dark brown/black, some reddish hues, thick tan head forms, sticks around, some nice lacing. Smell is sweet, some cherries and toffee, chocolate, lots of alcohol. Taste is weird, strange artificial flavour, some cherry/fruits, light roast, alcohol, no idea where this is going. Very weak finish, watery flavour. Mouthfeel is thin, low carbonation, somewhat unpleasant."
"JH"
"Very smooth taste, but I would rather have a thick stout taste over something that goes down smooth. Overall, a very acceptable alternative to the more expensive stouts"
"As low cost beers go, this is probably one of your better options... it is cheaper than other stouts and widely available here in the heart of Brookyln. I would definitely not pass up a Rogue, Stone Imperial Russian, or Brooklyn Black Chocolate stout for one of these, but as far as bodega beers go, this one is not a bad choice. You probably won't get ripped off either."
"Sweet, slightly sticky, but not unpleasant, not the sort of stout I would climb over a nude women to get at, but if offered another, I would drink it."
"Picked up a bottle of this stuff in Jamaica, and it couldn't have come a moment too soon. After six days in a resort where their idea of selection was wanbeer (redstripe) and wanlitebeer (redstripe lite) I couldn't take it anymore. This beer only cost me a quarter, it was plesently cool but not too cold. Sweet to the taste with a good thick consistancy and probably a decent head, but it was in a dark bottle. Well worth a shot if your stranded on an island."
"Saying that, the flavor is a bit simplistic. Smooth, but with a bit of an alcohol spice. Grape-y and medicinal flavors. No real roastedness and not bitter enough for my liking, which is a shame. That being said, I like it, but it's not a very good stout, but a decent enough beer."
"In the end, though, Desnoes & Geddes Dragon Stout is a pretty good - and fairly unique - beer; a good stout that's probably a great compliment to a sweet dessert. There's something in the nose (and to a much lesser extent, the taste) that's a little ""off," but it's a taste that grows on you. I hated my first, and fell in love with my second. Go figure."
"Would higly recommend a try, when it comes to high alcohol beer this is almost on the same pedistal as Duvel. If you are lucky enough to find a case, pick it up so it will last a while since it is very rare. At least around here."
"This is not a bad choice, since it's available locally (and you can't get very many foreign/export stouts (or stouts period) around here, especially in the summer). However, it's a little overly sweet for my tastes, and after a six-pack (this was the last one), I think I may hold off on getting any more for a while."
" Initially strong, the heavy malt tinged alcohol flavor fades to a delicious coffee and mocha combo that could stand to lose a little sweetness if I'm going to be picky. Still, this is flavorfull, skilled beer craftsmanship from a non traditional supplier of quality brew that I'd go back to repeatedly."
"A 10-oz bottle... how freakin' cool is that? Pours with a solid black body, thin brown head, rosy tinged, almost orange. Dissolves to a lace rim super-quick. Smells bready-sweet, like an English muffin with jam. Hoo-ah! Speaking of sweet, this beer is almost a cola it's so syrupy. Still manages to have a bit of an alcohol bite, for all that. Barely any roast, just a touch seemingly as a formality. Dragon stout is actually rather interesting as a potential summer/beach drink, but I'd definitely stick to one or a couple at most."
"D - Not that good. The sweetness is far too cloying."
"Available periodically at the Reef in Victoria and Vancouver."
"Other comments: An OK strong stout, but not very complex. Might be better with some age as that would add some oxidation flavors for a little more depth."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet chocolate and roasted malt scent that is rich and creamy with some alcohol notes. The taste is decent. It has a thin, yet quite malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm and smooth. It is intensely sweet with loads of crystal malts along with a slight roasted feel. It has a pronounced alcohol taste that hits you up front then fades as it goes down. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an interesting beer. I like sweet beers, but this takes it a little too far. It's an easy drinker even at 7.5% abv. . I didn't hate this beer, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"A little thin on the mouth but balanced in flavors. Not the most punishingly roasty stout but far from lacking in dynamics. I think bottle conditioning would greatly help its storage as well as development of complexity. Regardless, a good beer - so what's the beef people? Knee jerk reaction to a Jamaican vacation? Are most bottles getting baked by Carribean heat to sugary flatness?"
"Had this in Jamaica. Nice head on it after pouring that stuck around for a while. Smooth and soft in the mouth. Tasted like honey and chocolate. Didn't want more than one but probably only because it was hot and it's hard to drink a stout on a hot beach."
"Dragon Stout is colored black with an average-sized head that is creamy and light brown. The retention is very weak. The aroma is pretty weak and contains only a vague, sweet roastiness. The taste is sweet, with malts that have a brown sugar-like taste. A mild roastiness is noted underneath. Towards the finish a mixture of dark fruit flavor and alcohol join the mix. The overall flavors are pretty good, but seem a bit underwhelming for a 7.5% abv stout. There a plenty of better choices than this beer, you need only pick this up if you're stuck in Jamaica."
"One sip and...wow..is this ever a sweet beer. May need a dentist visit after this one.... More hoppy than I thought, and it has a much less syrupy feel than what it poured like. Alcohol isn't hidden much, and has a very creamy mouthfeel. I just can't get over how sweet this beer is, it's a bit of a turnoff for me. I like a slight sweetness, but... A bit thin in the mouth too. For some people this would be highly quaffable, me, I just get a toothache..."
"Its also a bit low on the drinkability scale. It is not a very pleasing flavor in my opinion, but if you like creamy / sweet stouts with 7.5% ABV, go nuts."
"BBE date March 06. This beer pours an opaque, nearly black hue with a fast-disappearing brownish head. On the nose, the mixed aroma has roated malts, black-plum's tartly sweetness, slightly sweet-chocolatey note, an implicit caramel flavour, against a mildly perfumy hoppy backdrop. The taste is sweetish, roasted-malty with relatively high alcoholic feel to it, followed by a tinge of sweet note of ripe black-fruits at the back. Pretty straight-forward roasted-malty and slightly toffeeish sweet in the aftertaste, with a very mild, refreshing bitter kick-back. The mouthfeel is quite soft but overall too sweet and the body is overly thin (at times even watery) for a Stout. Would need to think twice before buying and trying this beer again."
"Had one of these at the excellent Reef restaurant in vancouver and I must say that it would be great if this beer was readily available at our liqour stores. The beer pours jet black with a decent tan head. The nose is toffeish with caramel malts. The first taste was slightly metallic but that blew off after 4 or 5 sips. The beer has a solid mid body with a slightly sweet finish. I like this stout but the Trinidadian Royal extra gets the nod."
"This is one solid foreign stout that borders a cream stout in many respects. Nice drinkability and a pure joy to drink. This could easily be one dangerous session strong stout."
"Short lived, foamy, dark cocoa colored head. Opaque oil colored beer. Toasted malt aroma. Rich, roasted malt flavor, a bit of cocoa, mildly sweet. Becomes a bit drier towards the end, but the sweet malt lingers. Very drinkable 7/5% beer, even on a hot Jamaican evening."
"Pours an opaque black with a big long lasting tan head that leaves a patchwork of lace. The aroma is of mollasses, cocoa, and cane sugar. The taste is very sweet with very little roastyness, or even chocolate flavor. The finish is treacly and one dimensional. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with minimal carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is hurt by its strong sweetness. Still a decent stout though."
"A decent stout from Jamaica."
"Smallish bottle, pours black with a dark tan tiny bubble head with decent retention. Roasted malty nose. Roasted malts, chocolate malts prominant, also licorish, dark chocolate, burnt fruit and vanilla. Smooth mouthfeel, heavy body. This brew is semi sweet and also warming. Exerts a chalky dryness in the finish. Nice sweet stout , worth a try."
"Two inches of light brown, doughy head over a black-brown beer with garnet highlights. Faint sugar in the nose, light coffee, light chocolate, somewhat bready. The front is sweet: sugary toffee and chocolate. The middle is very sweet; syrupy chocolate syrup. It even finishes sweet, with a slightly roasty, somewhat bitter chocolate. Some alcohol is evident. It's not bad: a decent, sweet, chocolatey stout."
"Bought this bottle in a little supermarket in London. It pours a nearly black colour with a quich fading tan coloured head. It has a little roasty smell, hints of coffee malt too. The taste is sweet, a little bit to sweet for me. The taste is also roasted and some milky taste. hints of coffe and licorice too. The aftertaste is sweet and fruity. Not a bad beer but i like my stouts not as sweet as this one."
"Roasty coffee flavour disguises alcohol. On smooth side compared to national brands. Popular with mates. But would get bored after half a bottle. Bit aggressive carbonation, malt and syrupy sweet. Dark brown pleasing head. More than acceptable as transition beer to micros."
"Basically black in color, opaque, when held to a light a sliver of ruby can be clearly seen around the edges of the glass. A brown head of one finger topped off the beer, the head retention was decent as it took a few moments before it noticeably faded to a tight cap. This cap lasted for almost the entire consumption; still there was no subsequent lacing. The nose is interesting and not necessarily in a good way. There are some light roasty notes, it is a stout after all. I can also detect some lacto-sweetness and some odd mustiness. Airy with a stray note of alcohol that has a licorice twang. The potency is low and the nose doesnt say much. Apathetic. The palate is unique enough to be charming. In honesty the flavor profile is really muddled and nothing is able to shine on its own. But I like the mess. There is a moderate amount of roast, just enough to be stout-like. But what really throws this beer off-kilter is the sweetness that gets mixed with the licorice flavors and fruity, milky, chocolate qualities. The alcohol is also noticeable on the palate; this adds depth but more confusion on the tongue. This beer is flavorful and good enough to drink but I dont think it is very well constructed. From start to finish the beer tastes the same; this gets boring, still it is tasty (in a screwy kind of way). Honestly the high abv is very much needed in this stout without it I would image that the sweetness would be a bit too much. The body is medium at best and the carbonation is moderate. Overall the mouthfeel is barely above average but pleasant. I found this beer to be drinkable and quite likeable actually. I dont think I would want a bomber of this but the dainty 284 ml bottle was the perfect size. My Uncle Allen was kind enough to fork over $1.00 in Ocho Rios, Jamaica and lug this beer back for me. IMO, if you see it, buy it."
"Hmm, good beer. A shade short of pitch black, with a decent, one finger head with lots of staying power. Nice. Rings of lace stay on the glass like it was glued on, with a lace curtain between each ring. Whoa, sweet smell. Alot of roasted barley, without the burnt smell. Bit of a milk smell as well. Or something similar to milk. Cream? Half and half? Taste kicks your tongue with sweet, roasted barley that's been roasted to near perfection. Chocolatey, creamy and smooth. Still has the dairy quality to it. Chewy mouthfeel. Almost like a pudding. I'll be buying this again. Nice and drinkable. Not a session beer, but a beer that one wll want to drink again. And for something with such a lack of hops, it's quite well balanced. The malt starts out sweet, but the roastiness leaves a bittering aftertaste. I like it."
"Medium bodied, could stand being thicker, easy to drink apart from the sweetness (not cloying)."
"Not a bad little stout, goes nice with a cigar"
"A pretty good island stout--but what would possess anyone in Jamaica to feel like drinking this? Even so, it seems pretty light as stouts go, and is pretty drinkable--so I guess I could see it if you were already used to the year-round high temperatures."
"Impressions: This is a sweet one - must have dropped many lumps of that cane sugar into the mix."
"Pours to a deep nearly black ruby color and tan head that fades to a thin film. Aroma is more ""barleywinelike"" with the prominent alcohol and sweet candylike esters, with a hint of pale lager maltiness. Flavor is slick and lagerlike, more reminicent of doppelbock, but more of an artificial tasting sweetness than anything you'd expect from malt. Roasty malts with largery funk and sweet sweet sweet. Mouthfeel is OK. Not too drinkable but better than their Red Stripe."
"More like a porter crossed with a milk stout."
"Good sippin' beer, not for drinking one after another."
"300ml Bottle - Jet black brew with a nice dark head with good retention. Nose of alcohol and roastiness is very pleasant. Coffee and chocolate aftertaste. Good body and high alcohol taste give it a good edge. One of the best foreign stout I've tasted."
"Refreshing, well balanced and uncomplicated. A stout?"
"311"
"This beer pours a clear very dark (nearly opaque) red brown color with a moderate creamy light brown head. The smell is of alcohol, slight sherry-like and sweet roasted malt. The taste is again sweet roasted malt with alcohol warmth with a firm mouthfeel. This seemed more like a milk stout than a strong stout but was enjoyable nevertheless."
"Dark pour, generous head. Light malty nose, nothing really stands out, maybe some licorice. Quite a bit of carbonation which seems more typical of stouts from the caribbean. Slightly sweet hinted with black licorice, choco & molasses with some burnt sugar. Fuzzy finish. I think i prefer Royal Extra Stout from Trinidad as far as caribbean stouts go."
"The smell of this beer was like Caribbean rum and the beer poured a black color with a lasting tan head. The taste was very sweet and very thick in the mouthfeel. A nice stout, but one you cannot drink too much of because it tends to be a little sweet. I like stout, but not super sweet. If you like super-sweet beer, this is a damn good one.."
"(source: Gift; Toronto, Ont. Canada)"
"  Were it not for the syrupy demeanor, this beer would be a dead ringer for a local sweet stout made by Formosa Springs brewery in the 70s. They only made it in small batches and only once a year for obvious reasons..its not to everyones taste."
"Black with ruby highlights. Nice, creamy, dark tan head that holds fairly well. The aroma is a touch roasty and somewhat musty with a bit of alcohol. The body is much thinner than expected for the style, but the carbonation is fine and it's lightly tingly on the tongue. The flavor is sweetish and fruity up-front, followed by some caramel-tinged grainy malt and roastiness, and then a solid hop edge and a somewhat tangy and alcohol-washed finish. There's an astringency present in the aftertaste that sticks in the mouth unpleasantly. It's sweet and fruity, and offers more light toffee than roastiness; but it's still a pretty lackluster beer considering the style. It's unique, but not very well made."
"terrible stout, funky flavour, chunky, and in no way elegant. I'll never buy it again, but it was worth a shot."
"Notes: A unique, bold and interesting island Stout. Lacking in the hop balance department, but that could be one of its best defining qualities. Good buzz factor and it definitely lives up to its name. 7.5%abv."
