"Sickeningly sweet, over-carbonated, and way too thin to be enjoyed by this stout enthusiast!"
"Chocolaty nose. Thick black stout with a definite feel of the sweet grape on the finish. Very drinkable."
""
"Good finish, well integrated, fits with the beer."
""
"Wow this is awesome stuff, I just love the grape finish on this."
""
""
"A creamy, sweet stout. I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but the grape juice wasn't overpowering. It complemented the roasted notes quite well. Worth checking out."

"Poured into a Stone flute. Pours nearly black with a fine one finger dark khaki head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate, toasted malt, plums, hint of coffee and oak. Flavor of charred dark malt, dark chocolate, coffee, woody oak, a hint of dark fruit; finishes with more charry malt, light hop bitterness and coffee. Medium bodied with good carbonation and mouth feel. A richly flavored, charred malt stout with light barrel character and a deftly handled fruit component. It tasted like plum juice, but must be from the dark grapes. Deceptively straightforward at first taste, but develops a nice range of complex fruit and toasted malt character. This was very good, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I look forward to trying other beers from this brewery. Nicely done."
"Serving type: on tap."

"A pleasantly quaffable foreign stout, the wood and wine grape treatment adding a further bit of zest, but not overstepping their bounds at any time.  Heady, hearty, and wholly unworthy of this gentile fall weather we're 'enduring' at the moment - maybe I should have saved this one for a few months."

"O- I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. I'm typically not a fan of grapey tasting stouts, so I wasn't expecting much. But here, the grape adds a wonderful accent and acts more as a binding agent than anything else. I would definitely have this again."

"O - an innovative offering of the style with the Malbec grape juice and oak aging. Pair with grilled and roasted dark meats, purple beats, eggplant, berries, raw shellfish, chocolate cakes and puddings, white cheeses but maybe not bleu or feta."

"OVERALL: Of the seasonal stouts, I have to say this is my favorite. The body of this beer is just right and hits the spot either on a cold winter night or on a mild, sunny, late-winter afternoon here in Colorado. Great decision for their Hibernal beer."
""
""
"O: Enjoyable and easy to drink - I could see myself having one to two of these in an evening and finding it quite pleasant. I like the mixture of the wine grapes and the stout flavors and aromas with a nice note of the oak barrels from aging. Well done and I will probably grab another couple of these the next time I see them."
""
""
"Alcohol is well hidden and the medium to full body is surprisingly drinkable. Good job Ska, I've yet to have one of your beers that I didn't like."
""
"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer pours a thick, viscous, jet black coloring with a thin, filmy, clingy, light tan head. Aromas of roast, cream, peat, earth, wood, and subtle char. Very well blended and balanced aromas. Flavors are roast and creamy forward, with a tart and sweet grape note ribboning throughout. Very unique and balanced. Subtle chocolate notes in the background, with hints of smoke and char throughout. Touches of bitter coffee, too. Smooth and robust in mouth, with a bitter and roasted aftertaste of baker's chocolate and booze. The finish is smooth, with a subtle bitter and rich linger. This is a big beer, and a very unique twist on the style. Tasty."

"Overall, this was one of the best ""Foreign/Export"" stouts that I've had. I will definitely be stocking the fridge."

"Home tasting, 12oz can into Snifter. 2/19/14."
""
""
""
"O- Very nice altogether. I usually don't like Ska, but this is a very good beer."
""
"Overall this is a pretty decent stout that has a nice little twist with the grape. Well played by Ska!"
"O- A good try, although I feel like they should've gone more extreme with the base beer if they were going to age it on oak. Maybe use more grape juice? Instead, what's left is an above-average stout that you wouldn't know saw any time in a barrel. Ska's hoppier, less malty offerings are definitely more where it's at."
""
""
"Overall- Overall, this is an excellent imperial stout. I don't pick up any of the malbec grape juice, but I think that's a good thing. I would definitely buy it again."
""
""
""
""

"Overall great nose and good flavor...body quite light."
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.00 - It's somewhere between a belgian stout and an imperial stout. I like it. It's a little light bodied, but that's probably due to the grape juice drying it out."
"O: Tasty and rich in moderation, too many may become too much. Great and interesting beer though."
"Another beer from the creator of the canquest, woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grapes, roasted malts, a bit of coffee. Taste is lots of roasted malts, some coffee, a bit of grapes, a touch of hops, somewhat complex. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"O: A good stout. I will get it again, yet not anytime soon."

"The Crack was followed by an inverted Glug which produced both a pseudo-cascading action as well as two-plus fingers of dense, deep-tan head with great retention. As the head began to fall, lacing began to form almost immediately. In pouring it, I could see that the color was a purplish-brown, like a really bad bruise. once in the glass, however, it was allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled of raisins and chocolate and I was instantly reminded of a Cadbury Fruit & Nut chocolate bar! Wild. Mouthfeel was medium and I am going to go out on a limb here and declare the taste as ""vinous"". Call me crazy ... All joking aside, the grapiness was immediately evident with a kind of sour/tart flavor, followed by a smoky chocolatiness.The finish was semi-dry and I was reminded of the homemade wine that my uncle makes, especially the Zinfandel in 1989. Wow! What won't they think of next? This was totally unexpected and quite the drink. One would be plenty for me, but for the vino crowd, this could be a bridge."

"A dryish tasting, rich and worthy drink."

"a nice stout, better fresh than with a few months age on it. got more wine out of the first few cans. can't wait for the next ska seasonal stout!"

"Impressive stout. Plenty going on, plenty that could go wrong, fortunately it doesn't. Really interesting beer and worth trying. Thanks Dan for the opportunity."
""
""
""
"O - Quite a delicious brew. All the qualities of a good stout with an added wine-like flavor/feel twist. Very skillfully employed. Smell really popped and flavor had many dimensions."
""
""
"D -Hides its ABV well and is built well. I'm surprised at this one. With some work, it could be great."
"O: A solid stout with a nice little tart kick. Glad to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
"O- The smell of this got me excited but the taste was like a strong stout, good just not what I expected."
""
"Overall, an interesting fruity roasty foreign export stout."
""
"I think this is a more interesting approach to the ""beers of the future."" The flavoring is appropriate and the brew has a distinctly beery character. But it's a little different on the creative side. I just had a DFH Noble Rot, so it's from the white wine to the red."

"Pours a black color. Good retention and great lacing. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Smells of roasted malt, slight sweet malt, grape, slight coffee, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Foreign / Export Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness and an associated thickness. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight grape, hint of coffee, and slight hop. Overall, good appearance, and decent aroma, body, and feel."

"Enjoyable, easy-drinking, though it wasnâ€™t quite as interesting as I had hoped given the addition of grapes. Glad I just picked up a single. Worth a try though."

"A solid export stout, the grape juice brings some dryness/acidity to the party & that's about it from what I can see. ABV is fairly well hidden, drinks fairly easy"
"6.6/10"

"Another intriguing canned stout from Ska... lets give it a try. Poured into snifter. Pour is black, medium visual weight with a collar of tan head. Moderate amount of lacing left behind The nose has that nice roasty foreign stout character that emphasizes roasted barley and black patent. The malbec grape character integrates nicely with the sweet malt components of the aroma. A bit of oak is present as well which gives off a somewhat dry aroma. The taste starts with grape sweetness that presents itself delicately. I was concerned that this brew would be a sweet mess given the ingredients. The grape lends nicely to the sturdy roast of the base, very nice balance. Notes of chocolate, coffee, and oak come through with hints of white grape juice throughout. The grape quality makes one last appearance on the finish. mouthfeel is somewhat thin with moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer is very unique and well executed. At 10.99 a six pack, it also offers a good value. Worth a try!"
"O/D - A nice and easy drinking stout. I can't argue about the taste, although I'm not sure how much it incorporates the uniqueness they were aiming for. Worth a try."
""
""
"O- Overall a good beer, but it would have been better if the grape was more outstanding so it could compliment the bitterness from the hops and malt."
"I find this to be an exquisite little foreign export stout. It's packed with flavor and character all wrapped up in a deliciously sweet and heavy body. I'm not sure what the malbec grapes added to this little beauty, but but all the other ingredients sure come together wonderfully. If a big, roast-y ""meal-in-a-can"" stout is what you're after, this one easily fits the bill."

"O - This is a really tasty stout. I really like this series of stouts from Ska."

"Drinkin' a beer with Malbec grapes, watching a documentary that mentions Baalbek. Nice. Anyway, this stuff pours a murky black-brown topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dusty cocoa powder, light oak, and a vague sense of flavored alcohol, as though I sniffed a Solo cup left over from some random college party where they were drinking who-knows what in these cheap-ass vessels. The taste rings with a sharp red wine grape covered in cocoa and mild coffee. Hints of vanilla bean and oak dart in and out at various points. Though a bit of booziness pervades, it doesn't wholly interfere with things, rather opting to occasionally create a sense of cough syrup every now and again. Somehow, this jumble works. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate (verging on moderate) carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice stout, one that blends the wine grapes well with the roasty surroundings."
"D - I liked this quite a bit and I'd be willing to pick up a 4-pack to see how it compares out of the can. Interesting and unique beer; I dug their Merlot stout and this was in a similar vein. I can imagine this might be a bit polarizing, but it worked for my palate. Happily consumed 12oz and could drink a couple in an evening."
"The Hiberdal Vinifera Stout is good. The stout poured an opaque dark in my sniffer. There is a thin tan head which is leaving some lace. The scent is bolstered by espresso with touches subtle hints of red wine. The taste is starts with a typical stout, roasts, earthy, espresso, etc. Then the finish has a dark fruit/black cherry tones. The Malbec presence becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is full bodied with smooth carbonation. Overall it is a very interesting stout and a perfect winter warmer."
""
""
"Overall, this is a sipper for sure, and I don't think I'll be getting through the sixer anytime soon. Almost like a wine."
"A great brew. For those that say it's boring and undefined, compare it side-by-side to SKA's Milk Stout, you'll see. This brew is a Home Run!! A must try. Well done, SKA.."
"My take: A meal in a can kind of beer. Somewhat complex, with a thick drip-down-the-esophagus feel attendant to the style, and a lingering mouth presence, it should not be sessioned or taken with dinner. I might grab some sharp cheddar for my next gulp."
""

"Feels a bit dry, but also smooth. This is an easy drinking stout."

"12oz can purchased for $2 I think, made sure to buy a single because I bought a sixer of the last cocoa stout ska did and was unhappy. Dark black color, nice head, good stout appearance. nice roasted stout smell, sort of rich, nice. Flavor was more rich stout, hints of cocoa, not a trace of grapes that my palate could detect. I could also not detect any oak but I wasn't let down because it was still a tasty stout."
"a real strange installment of the stout series. aged in oak with malbec grape juice added. the pour looks alright, jet black and thicker, with an inch of tan head with nice retention. maybe im seeing what i want to see here, but there appears to be a faint purple color to it when held to the light. the smell is of a sweet stout, maybe not quite a milk stout, but there is plenty of residual sugar in this one, as well as a sturdy but not too black roasty malt base. the grape juice can hardly be smelled or tasted. it just tastes like a sweet stout to me, i dont even get much oak. i get a hint of grapey acidity towards the end, but thats about it. its got a strange aftertaste of fruit, which i think clashes with the large dark malt profile rather than adding anything desirable. full body and a very funny feeling beer in the stomach. im glad i got a single instead of a 6pack, as this is not as easy beer to put down. i dont dislike it, but i dont think it came together quite the way it was intended to. maybe more time in oak would bring the flavors together in a more congruent way, or maybe they should just scrap this and go back to the mole stout, because that was darn good."

"O - overall, this is a really tasty beer that hits on multiple flavor notes without seeming like it's trying too hard; the grape/oak/coffee stout is surprisingly balanced and extremely tasty; at 8%, these flavors hide the alcohol entirely: I could session this badboy!"
"O - Very tasty. I suspect the grape juice might have helped with the sweetness that i tasted that complemented the coffee notes. The oak was more noticed as I first tried it. I liked this beer. The only thing I wish Ska had don't was not about the beer but their website. They teased about info about the beer but I followed every link I could and couldn't find anything about it."
