3.6,-1.9,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Starts out with a couple centimeters of light khaki bubbles on top of deep brown beer that doesn't let much light through but does turn just a bit red at the edges. The smell is mostly sweet with a lot of dark fruit, plums and the like. Very little in the way of malt or typical stout like bitter chocolate in the nose. The taste is very smooth dark malts with only a hint of the bitterness that you would expect. The fruitiness comes through as well but the taste is much more dynamic than the smell with a lot of the more Belgian flavors of earthy, yeasty, vinous flavors in there as well, overall strange for a stout and more like a Belgian dark. Rather full bodied but quite smooth with low levels of carbonation and a finish that is only slightly dry with a touch of bitterness. An unusual take on the style that has enough in the way of interesting characteristics to make it worth trying but doesn't make it a great beer.","fank2788","May 23, 2014"

3.63,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,"This dark mahogany beer has a durable tan head and leaves very good lacing. The near creamy texture overlays an unusual palate that seems both full and light, and has a pleasant, semi-dry finish. Although it is slightly light in color for a stout and has an unusual (yeasty, boozy and hoppy) aroma, in tasting this is indeed a Belgian stout: it has the flavor of a rather spicy and hoppy export stout with the added complexity imparted by Belgian yeast and in-bottle refermentation. The dark roasted malts do come to the fore for a moment now and again in the finish, then linger in the durable aftertaste.","chinchill","Mar 31, 2013"

Looks nice. Aroma of dark fruit with a lot of plum, toasted malt, chocolate and a slight mineral element. Flavor of dark and dried fruit, chocolate, coffee and slight hops on the finish. A Belgian influence to the yeast and fruit. Complex with interesting flavor progression. Nice medium body with excellent creaminess and active carbonation. Appropriately somewhat dry and slightly sour as expected from an export stout. I lean towards the Russian and American style of stout, but I really enjoyed this, one of the nicer export stouts I've had.","LiquidAmber","Aug 08, 2012"

The flavor is light, small roasted malt and a sour twang too. Belgian yeast plays a role , adding a subtle fruityness that works well with the mild sour note.

Yeasty and sharp flavor right upfront. Some hop bite. Faint roasted quality. Mild cocoa notes as it warms. Earthy and bready-more Belgian than stout like if anything. Too thin for my liking.

3.73,1.6,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Lot #01! Best before end of 2011! Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured pitch black with a two finger beige head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, slight roasted malt, hints of caramel, and slight nuttiness. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, cream, and a slight roastiness. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew wasn't that bad, but it also wasn't that great. Neither the aroma nor flavor were very robust in this one which was quite disappointing. The elements that were there were quite nice, but it just lacked in intensity. Glad I got to try this one, but once is enough for me unless they can work on the robust aspect.","thagr81us","Feb 28, 2011"

Completely black liquid, thin sliver of orange at the bottom of the glass. Direct nose, almost tame, of dark chocolate, freshly ground coffee, malted milk balls, grape, cherry and plum fruit scents, has some hoppy kick but no distinguished individual scents. Medium-bodied, starts out creamy but dries up as it progresses, losing its softer texture. Carob, chocolate, coffee, butterscotch and a decent nuttiness set the table. Fresh grain brown bread, the kind of eat in chunks rather than slices. Slides you a slice or two of orange citrus. The carbonation has a tighter weave and more punch than expected given the delicacy of the head. Not much hops presence. It's credible but nothing special.","farrago","Nov 14, 2010"

The 7.5% shows itself minimally in feel and just a bit in taste, but I like it, adds to what's going on, which in this case is light for the style.

Initial flavor of warm brown sugar, yeasty baked goods with citrusy hop resins mid palate. Finish of smoke, roasted malt and charred oak. The mouthfeel is medium. It feels like it could be thicker without becoming sticky. Drinkability is only average. I rated the taste highly for its multifaceted character, but the grapefruit flavor is a little off-putting.","rhenning","Dec 21, 2009"
3.43,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Rather interesting. I've little experience with belgian stouts, but this is quite subtle and seems an easy segue into the style from the American and British stouts I'm more used to. A distinct estery belgian spice is surprisingly hidden and well integrated. Pretty subtle and easy overall, a stronger malt profile with some amped-up roasty notes would add another layer of complexity from which this beer would doubtlessly benefit. I'm certainly glad I tried it, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy another bottle but I'd drink it again without hesitation, if offered.","MisterSH","Nov 21, 2009"

The taste, though, has a malty sweetness in the front, balanced with a medium hop bitterness and considerable grain astringency and bitterness. It doesn't quite get husky, but the tannins, combined with the burnt/highly roasted malts, give the beer a nice backbone. This give the mouthfeel an interesting character as well.
