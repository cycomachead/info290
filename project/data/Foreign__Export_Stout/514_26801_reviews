"Overall, this is very good dessert beer that is almost overwhelmingly bitter.  If you like chewing spent coffee grounds, this is the beer for you!  And I mean that in the best way possible..."

"Overall â€“ This one won a silver star in 2011.... It has such a strong flavour it is very hard to taste the alcohol and the flavour seems to develop with each taste. A good little number and very surprising to me as I was not aware that the Dutch went in for Stout or that they were so accomplished in this style."

"Overall: While it won't knock your socks off with a myriad of complexities, it's amply flavorful and an ease to drink at 5.5% ABV."

"O - A solid bear, great transition for the Guiness drinker. Only knocked for the diacetly and mediocre head retention."
"O: recommended."

"Bart Jopenkerk feels that there's a thick, milky velvet mouthfeel to this stout. It tastes true to its scent: a light chocolate coffee with roasted elements. Disclaimer: I'm partial to stouts so I may be biased but this beer is good. I like it and so does Bart Jopenkerk."
"Mouth is fuller bod, decent carb. Light warming booze."

"O: The light-bodied nature of this beer makes it very very easy to drink but isn't very flavorful."
"All in all, this beer could be improved but it is still good."

"O: In all aspects, this is a great beer, if you don't consider the strange taste. This could have been the best Export Stout ever, but the artificial and weak taste spoiled that..."
"O - I miss the booze and body of a Russian Imperial Stout but that's logically concerning the style. For an ordinary stout it has good flavor but you should not look specially for it. If you encounter it, try it."
"Overall: Nice brew"
"OVERALL: Says it won a gold medal at the World Beer Championships, which is believable. A solid English style export stout. Definitely more English than Belgian in style. Lots of nice flavor in this one, and a decent nose to boot. Not one worth tracking down per se, but certainly one worth trying if you run across it. A very solid effort by an ever more impressive brewery. Looking forward to seeing more from Jopen. Cheers!"
"Decent stout."
"at al at rooms temperature."
"D: Not bad, I just wished the body would've been more heavy. Drinking became better when the beer warmed up."
"An outstanding and mature stout, very dry and burned."
"The taste was a mix of roasted malt dry bitterness and a very hoppy layer underneath. This made it less drying mouthfeel than most stouts I had. At the end the chocolate tones come back again that made me want to a refill of yhis one, very drinkable!"
"Pours a deep dark black with a moderate head that dies off but never completely goes away (until the whole thing goes away!). Aroma of espresso (which is one of the ingredients, according to the bar's advertising) and bitter chocolate. Flavor contains those elements, but not as strong as in the aroma. Dark maltiness, more sweet than dry, but the coffee creates some bitterness. Generally enjoyable, thirst quenching, good stuff."
"Dark brown with an off-white head, leaving some lacing. Smell is sweet, a little bit of cream, soft vanilla. Taste seems somewhat similar to Guinness--No, Guinness is not the only other stout I've had--It's like a sweet or milk stout, it has cream-like flavors to it. Mouthfeel is as if it was a nitro beer and has a little less than medium body to it. This was drinkable, but I probably wouldn't seek this one out. Probably worth a try if you're in Belgium."
"Pours nice little head that doesn't retain so well, but leaves a little head behind. The color is black, but does let light through, but was not brown (just very dark). The head retains enough to leave a thin layer on top of the beer. The smell reminds me of a Lake Louie Milk Stout for some reason (just not as good). The taste is bitter, very very bitter with some metallic flavors as well. I can tell at one time it had some roasty flavors. Mouthfeel was pretty good, not too bad and kinda smooth. Overall I wouldn't have another, but it may have been good at one point."
"Unlike other stouts I have had, this is perfectly in balance and mild, which make drinkability excellent."
"BB 04-07-07. Nice poorout with litle head and a black beercollor. Nose is esterfruity and with it good carramallic and burnt maltnotes. Overal sweet and fresh nose. taste is litle burnt, litle caramellic befrore good roast and hopbitterness comes into play. Good chocolate and coffenotes with it. Overall IMO good but misses the thickness of a stout. Fine but quiet high carbonisation with it. Well drinkable and IMO certainly worth a try but something else as much english stouts."
