4.26,2.2,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"On draft at Gainesville House of Beer. Pours jet black with creamy mocha head. Very creamy mouthfeel, wow this is beautiful. Sweet sugary chocolate/lactose on the aroma. This is so creamy it feels and tastes like I'm drinking super rich chocolate milk with just a a bit of coffee bitter to balance. Pretty sweet, but very solid and lots of flavor that bursts on the palate. Really wish I would have had a chance to try Check It and See.","BMMillsy","Nov 09, 2012"

4.25,1.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - Good stuff. An enjoyable take on a style that doesn't get a ton of attention in the US. I'd gladly order this if it were on-tap in Florida, and I enjoyed it significantly more than Puppy's Breath Porter.","MasterSki","Dec 17, 2011"

4.06,-2.6,5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark black color with a thick mocha three finger head that sticks around for a while, crazy head retention. Aroma of strong roasted malts, coffee, bitterness from the hops sweetness from the malts and licorice in the back. Taste follows the nose just intensified. Slightly dry but not dry stout level. Moderate mouthfeel. This is a great middle of the road stout.","jcartamdg","Sep 20, 2011"

4.3,3.1,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"O: To be honest one could take my review as a little bias because Cigar City is by far my favorite brewery. They consistently deliver choices within styles to meet anyone's taste buds. This is a perfect desert beer. I would compare it to Rogue's Chocolate Stout (which is one of the world's best) but I can enjoy Hot Blooded to the fullest extent because it is lighter, more like a bit size candy bar compared to a whole birthday cake. Love the beer, love the brewery!","One2Remeber","Sep 12, 2011"
