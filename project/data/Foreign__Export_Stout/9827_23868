3.9,5.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light tobacco, light char, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light char, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Foreign stout style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on even with the low carbonation. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 07, 2014"

The taste gets better after a few sips. and it isnt a twist tot (which I like) and being imported from jamaica (thats the main purpose why i tried it) makes it worth it, to atleast try if anything.","mando_thegreat","Jan 24, 2014"
3.46,-6.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"A large mocha head rises and sits top this ebony bodied liquid. With the top a darker hue, it looks like one of those beefed up imperial stouts brewed in the US. There's joy here, and the joy is coming through the nose. A very sweet note of chocolate, followed with booze and overripe banana. The taste is agreeable, interesting to say the least. It has a banana accent which gives up a Belgian impression, but isn't. Soft roasted malts taking a swim in chocolate and a kiss of fruitiness. Not much alcohol is noted. Regarding mouthfeel, it's medium-full bodied with a carbonation near soda level, let's cut that down some. As it stands, it's an acceptable foreign stout which is also relatively easy on the wallet.","DoubleJ","Jan 07, 2014"

We wish more of these Foreign Stouts would hit our shores to further challenge the palates of US beer drinkers. If the locals in Jamaica have no problem drinking a hearty Stout in 85°F sunny weather, then neither should you.","BeerAdvocate","Sep 09, 2013"

3.37,-8.7,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some slight dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly sour bittersweet cocoa flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a slightly above average beer that is drinkable but I am not really enjoying the sour aspect I am getting in the flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 10, 2013"

4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, I find this to be a nicely-balanced stout, full of excellent flavors and obviously the result of careful craftsmanship. The beer doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table--yes, there are fruity notes here, but those same notes are found in other stouts--but it does bring all of the flavors together excellently.","jondeelee","Aug 09, 2011"

3.9,5.7,4,4,4,3,4,"A descent export here. Nothing simple about this beer. Hops come through nice without taking away the other flavors. Exports are a fun style with odd characteristics. This would be really good in the winter. Although it's even good in 99 degree weather.","StaveHooks","Jun 24, 2011"
3.85,4.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Mmm, not bad. Not quite a sweet stout and drinkable. I let it warm a tad before pouring and then it had a nice, thick, creamy, foamy, frothy, tan head that mostly faded fast and a little lace. Color is opaque dark brown except in the bottom of the glass where it's narrow and there I can see it's a clear garnet. Aroma isn't too complex, just basically what I'd expect to find: roasty, malt, toffee, cocoa, caramel. Flavror's more or less the same with a little sweetness balance by the roasty burnt and carbonic acids. Body is good, ditto carbonation. Finish is balanced too with a little booze and of medium length. A slow session so I don't get wasted.","drpimento","Jun 24, 2011"
3.85,4.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O – A very interesting and good stout, and worth a try for any stout lover, a quality stout from Jamaica! 7.6 ABV was not discernable at all dare I say sessionable. More fruity as it warms. 4","rsdaugherty","Jun 12, 2011"
3.7,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall- a pleasant drinking experience, I can feel the 7.6% ABV from this beer. But I think one is enough for one sitting of this complex beer. Drinkability is challenging.","PokerGod","Jun 06, 2011"

I had it on another one of our hot, humid days in Charleston, but it didn't leave me feeling bloated. To me, that's a definite plus. I got hints of chocolate malt and candy, with a slight hop finish. Taste was very malty, almost like a malted milkshake. Didn't really taste much hops at all, as well as no taste of alcohol. The appearance was the big disappointment though. Not much of a head at all, just kind of a spotty at best. Glad I gave it a try.","JISurfer","Aug 17, 2010"

3.64,-1.4,3,4,4,3,3,"Solid two finger head of rich brown creamy foam, whipped up enough to quickly dimple, admirable stickiness to the sheets of lacing. Impenetrably black colored liquid, sliver of copper at the outer edges. Plays up the roasted coffee, cocoa in the nose, licorice too yet not without its bitter side, chicory and celery, more chocolaty as it sits, the scents seem pressed together and thus you don't get much differentiation among them. Full-bodied and close to formidably dense, the carbonation slowly builds, pops and then builds again. There's a thick skinned quality to the dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee bean flavors, so robust it can't help but express itself but perhaps in a begrudging manner. Syrupy at times, however, no lack of hop bite and there's oats, pumpernickel and whole grain bread aspects. Ends with an allusion to rum, or maybe that's just the power of suggestion given its place of origin.","farrago","Nov 24, 2009"

4.4,19.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a dark black with a thin brown head that dissipates quickly. The beer developed a good collar that remained with some decent laciness. Aroma is coffee and malt with some tones of alcohol. Taste was coffee and a little malt. A lot of bitterness with some sweetness and a hint of alcohol. Thick and viscous mouthfeel. Very good session beer, that does not sit heavy. Flavor is to my liking but may be on the bitter side for others.","tbeck","Mar 26, 2009"
4.02,8.9,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"D - This is a tasty foreign extra stout and I think fits the style quite well. It's skewed a little towards a hop flavor, but it doesn't detract from the silky smooth roasted malt.","scoobybrew","Mar 09, 2009"

Smell is sweet, mellow roasted cacao but with amoniahint and slight citrusnote. Taste is very sweet, straw like and burnt and probably forgotten about adding hops as bitterness I get is burnt. Quiet heavy in oxidation though not doing bad to the brew but adding some creamyness. Still bit unfresh for me and quiet vegy after some more sips. Drinks OK.","paterlodie","May 10, 2006"
