Not much different reaction. This stuff requires some heavily spiced eastern food that can fight back. So, I give this every point from 0-5, all over the place, this is unique. It is more like a spicy marinade I make for kebobs on the bbq than something I intend to drink. Clever, spicy, surprising, I give it a 1-5 point spread, you are gonna hate it or love it and there ain't no place inbetween! I will bbq with this tomorrow as my marinade for tri-tip and I am sure it is going to be awesome.","RockAZ","Dec 26, 2014"

I thought that, after their habanero, this would just be the next step, unfortunately we just don't click.  I see comments like ""oh well if you don't like this, stick to Bud Lite"".  Get out of here.  This is such a uniquely crafted beer, perhaps my palate will appreciate it in time, but as for now it just seems like a risk that didn't pay off.  Take the money you'd spend on this and try any/all other B.P. brews before this, only then would I suggest taking the dive.  Will revisit in time, 1/5.","isunktheship","Dec 25, 2014"

I can picture the beards sitting around and debating whether they should release this beer or not… “Well, this sucks, but we need to sell it, and since the vast majority of our other beers are pretty awesome, enough people will give us the benefit of the doubt and buy a bottle so we can sell it all, then they’ll try it and hate it, but they won’t give up on us because of the other awesome stuff.” Well, okay, you’re right.

Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, vanilla, coconut, cumin, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn, cardamom, cayenne, lime, herbal, and toast/herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and the wide variety of spices; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, vanilla, coconut, cumin, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn, cardamom, cayenne, lime, herbal, and toast/herbal earthiness. Moderate earthy spices and heat on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toast, vanilla, coconut, cumin, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn, cardamom, cayenne, lime, herbal, and toast/herbal earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and big spice flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance with no cloying flavors after the finish and a moderate amount of lingering heat. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and fairly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol was well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish other than the heat from the spices. Overall this was a very nice spiced stout. All around good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and spice flavors; and quite smooth to sip on despite the moderate heat. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 24, 2014"

Instead it was like drinking a spicy curry Indian dinner. All of the flavors as indicated on the label were there. And to me it was crafted successfully by the brewers at Ballast Point. But it was too much for me. The curry produced too much of a burn for my palate. The complexity of the curry, coconut, lime were all there, but at the end of the day, it's not what I want to drink in a beer. Others may like this beer and I don't want to trash the beer either.

I was intrigued by this beer, with the curry notes in the aroma, and the hint of coconut milk, and then I actually tasted it- like a plateful of curry- strong curry. So strongly flavored that the curry just dominates everything. I thought this might be pleasant with food, but really, it's so highly spiced that I can't see it complementing anything other than white rice. Now mind you, the flavors aren't bad, or artificial, just a bit too much. It's certainly interesting, and could actually be a very good beer if it were reined in a bit.","Georgiabeer","Apr 16, 2014"

There isn't much lacing at all. The brew smells mostly like cumin, curry, and cayenne, along with a bit of coconut. The spices overpower pretty much everything else that's in the aroma. The spices are strong in the flavor of this beer too, but I can also taste some lime, chocolate, and vanilla. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and smooth with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, too bad I only bought one bomber because if I had another one I'd probably drink it now! Recommended if you like spicier food/beer. $9.35 a bomber.","bluejacket74","Apr 11, 2014"

But once I did I found myself going back for more. Smell is dominated by curry along with hints of chocolate and roasted barley. Taste is so unique, curry again, cocoa, a mild roasted coffee and some heat that does not overwhelm in the finish. The base beer does not drink at all like a foreign stout. It is smooth and slightly malty. So well balanced in flavors. Unfortunately, the coconut and kaffir leaf are almost non-existant. Still an awesome offering by ballast point!","Jbats","Mar 24, 2014"

I purchased the bottle on a whim and didn't drink for probably a good month. I poured the bottle into a tulip glass and let it sit for about ten minutes to let it warm up slightly and hopefully open up all of the flavors that made it into the bottle. The smell tells me what I'm about to taste, but not in a way that was very appetizing. It smelled alot like walking into a Indian restaurant lots of curry and spices, a little bit of sweetness, not really how i want my beer to smell. Taste was better the curry, cumin, coconut, and the lime all came through. The best part of the flavors were the balance they complemented each other just like a great food dish. The saving grace was the cayenne though, the heat was just strong enough to take the beer to another level and given some depth. After awhile though as well constructed as it was the novelty wore off and i found myself not wanting to finish it. Overall excellent execution and worth a try but at the end of the day a beer that tastes very much like an Indian dish isn't one I'm going to keep coming back to.","jkeefe1800","Feb 08, 2014"

It's also spicier than I remember; actual heat from the cayenne. Tickling heat hangs in my lips. Really hard to judge this beer after everything is considered.

Aromas of bittersweet baker's chocolate enveloped in curry spices. Very interesting blending on the nose. Flavors are curry forward, with both spice and heat, followed by a ribbon of chocolate and coffee, both bitter and sweet, and then the beer transitions back into the spice and heat of curry. The aftertaste is bitter and warming, and the warmth lingers throughout the finish and for quite a while after, as well. The finish is slick and smooth. This is a very unique take on an Export stout. I am very intrigued by it, and it would make for some interesting food pairings, because it seems like it can easily overpower.","GarthDanielson","Sep 02, 2013"

The smell is incredibly unique: lots of curry and lime come through up front with some coconut and spice to follow. The state is more spice forward and starts with some ancho chili followed by a dark chocolate quality. The finish features a touch of licorice. Quite the journey of flavored here. The body is on the thin side with medium carbonation. This was an ambitious project by Ballast Point and I think they did a good job at bringing together so many odd flavor in a brew.

If I had a complaint it would be that there's very little of the base beer here, and certainly not many characteristics of a stout. Definitely a sipper due to the spice, and a beer you really have to be in the mood for. That said, it is masterfully done, and a must try for fans of hot Indian or Thai curries.","TempeBeerMan","0"

The smell is very interesting, savory, with no indication of the messy and unbalanced flavor to come. Heat is a problem, quickly escalating to an undrinkable level. After setting this beer aside as a beverage, it was able to redeem itself in remarkable fashion as a cooking ingredient.","beagle75","Feb 24, 2013"

Vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, and sweet coconut curry immediately followed by a spicy chile burn at the back of the palate that lingers through the finish. As the beer warmed the flavors became even more intense and accessible. The chile spice gave me a bit of heartburn to be honest.

Overall this was a decent brew. I really didn’t know what to expect on this one when I first saw. Once I took my first smell of it I REALLY didn’t know what to expect. Was this dry hopped with Indian food was one of my first thoughts… I happen to like Indian food, but why does my beer smell like it?

4.32,17.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark brown with mahogany highlights at the edges. Half finger light brown head dissipated slowly to a ring around the glass with light lacing. Interesting aroma of sweet dark malt, coconut and pepper with hints of curry and cocoa. Flavor is also unusual; coconut is instantly obvious on the start, with sweet and roasted malt, chocolate, immediately covered with peppery spices. Finishes peppery and spicy with the heat clearly from hot pepper and not from hops. The spices definitely dominate most of the taste of this stout, but the body, while not intense, supports the spicy flavors. Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess. I like this quite a bit and enjoyed the whole bomber in one evening. Not for the hot pepper and/or coconut adverse. I would pick this up again if it was available. (Please come to Washington, Ballast Point!).","LiquidAmber","May 10, 2012"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, coconut, curry spice, and lemongrass. Taste is very much the same with a spicy finish after each sip. Very tasty stuff. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with some awesome Indian food elements added into it.

4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from bomber to pint glass. Pours a thick oily black color with a small 1 finger mocha head with decent retention and lacing throughout. Very unique nose: coconut, roasted malt, curry, hints of pepper and heat. The flavor follows suit with a huge coconut flavor that mellows out into a complex blend of curry, roast, pepper, cocoa, and a bit of lime. Very unique. Finishes smooth and creamy with a medium body and mild bitterness. Overall, this is quite a unique brew! It was a pleasure to have sampled it, I can easily say I've never had anything like it. I'd recommend it if for nothing else the unique flavor.","hopfacebrew","Jan 22, 2012"

Fantastic nose of sweet malt, coconut, curry powder, and spices. So insane, perfectly captures a Thai curry. Taste is just as amazing, TONS of coconut, chocolate malt, curry powder, and spices with a hit of lime and a subtle chili pepper spiciness that build as the beer warms (and you drink more). Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Such an insane beer, and truly one of the most unique and memorable I've had!","jsanford","Dec 10, 2011"
3.7,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a very dark brown-black with a medium tannish-brown head that disappears slowly. Scent is heavy with coconut and a plethora of spices that make my nose tingle. A lot of chocolate and a little bit of lime. Taste is initially dark chocolate with just a bit of anise. I get a lot of coconut. Just a hint of curry with a ton of cayenne and cumin. The cayenne lingers on the throat and tongue with tingly spiciness. A bit of alcohol as well. As it warms...the curry comes through more. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spicy, and tingly. Drinkability is fair. Overall, this is a unique beer, but all the spices can be a bit overwhelming. Tasty though.","DovaliHops","Dec 06, 2011"

The aroma is big coconut, some curry, some light lime, and a bit of roast. Very unique. The initial taste is sweet coconut milk, followed by some light curry, a bit of lime, cumin, and a bit of roast. The finish has a light bitterness and leaves a lingering curry spiciness. Light-medium bodied. Low carbonation. Certainly an interesting beer. It is dominated by the spices. I found it enjoyable, but could see how some would not like it.","jethrodium","Oct 30, 2011"

Medium to Light-Medium body, decent carbonation. Taste is cumin, cayenne, curry spices, burnt dark chocolate, peppery. I don't get any coconut, but a tad bit of the lemongrass. There is definately some spicyness here. Would not be able to drink a lot of it, but it is a fun brew.","pmarlowe","Jul 21, 2011"
3.95,7.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a near-black brown, thin light tan head with no lacing and not much retention. Smell is lots of curry spice, baker's chocolate, and bitter coffee. Taste is tamarind, turmeric, black pepper, and smoky malt. I'm not picking up any of the supposed coconut in the smell or taste (nor did anyone else in our group). Light bodied and medium-high carbonation, alcohol is not really noticeable. Overall, bonus points for the novel interpretation of the style. This was actually pretty drinkable despite the unusual flavor; although I didn't love it, it's not one of those beers that you can only drink a taste of. I'm intrigued as to the possibilities of food pairings with this.","Urbancaver","Jun 08, 2011"
4.32,17.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a ~4 ounce sample glass in the brewery’s tasting room. This beer poured a very dark brown with a nice touch of tan head that clings to the corner of the glass. The aroma is very unique. Coconut is probably the most prominent smell as well as some lightly roasted dark malts. There is a definite spiciness to the aroma but I would not have identified it as curry had I not known. Tastes spicey and dry. The curry is definitely present but melds well with the rest of the beer. Coconut is pretty big. At 9% there is no surprise that there is a significant booziness. Its a bit too boozy to be very drinkable which hurts the beer a bit but well carbonated and the strong coconut is really pleasant to me. Definitely a well crafted beer that combines flavours I never expected to see used in brewing!","notchucknorris","Jun 06, 2011"
