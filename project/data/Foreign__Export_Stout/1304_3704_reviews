"Overall a pretty standard stout."
""
"Pours a lovely liquid dark chocolate black in the glass.  Light Brown frothy head reaches nearly two inches with no problem.  Nose is soft but full with tones of chocolate, sweet malt and dark very ripe fruits.  First sip yields an amazing smoothness to the palate.  Creamy layers of coco and milk chocolate mixed with those same dark fruit notes that I don't normally see play this well in a stout.  This bottle had been in my cellar for over a year.  The bottle is dated 7-31-13.  I'm sure this has something to do with how smooth and well balanced this brew is.  Just simply a wonderful stout overall."

"Smooth stout, great feel, good but not quite amazing taste."

"great beer; tweener stout.  kinda a bit dry stout, kinda a bit sweet stout, and a nod to American stout.  basically, a little of everything, almost like an imperial stout just scaled down a bit.  (bottle says 7.5% and 45 IBU)  the work of a skilled brewer; well done."

"whoa, i am shocked to learn this beer is 7% abv. it felt a lot lighter to me than that, and certainly drinks more like a dry irish stout at 4% than it does as a foreign style so strong. clean looking brew, medium bodied and soil brown, with a tall head thats surprisingly light for how dark the liquid is. smells sweet like oats, and has less roast bitterness than most. there are some hops in here though, especially in the finish, giving a bit of a fruity flavor to the finish, the way lemon zest goes in espresso. similar complexion, less acidity. clean feeling beer too, only medium bodied and slick going down. the moderate carbonation is plenty, the big flavors do the talking, and its nice to listen awhile. coffee and cocoa in the finish, still think there may be some oats. overall an excellent example of the style fit for year round drinking."

"Quite a bit of char/roast.  Also, too thin."

"This is a serious stuff. Bold and impressive flavors but I have to say that the drinkability is less than I would like. The toasted flavors are nice but the darkness obliterates every flavor before it. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Central Market - Shoreline in north Seattle."
""
""
"Harsh roast - though, luckily, this doesn't get acrid. Thinner, but very drinkable, true to style."
""
"A big stout with contribution from PNW hops. Not all the usual RIS notes: creamy, some red berry, but no coffee. The definition of American Stout."

"Overall- A good beer which meets the style requirements. Worth a try and has a nice price tag. I think this is cheaper than Guinness per ounce but my memory seems to tag Guinness Foreign Extra Stout as being slightly better."
""
"O- If it wasn't for the excessive amount of heat in the flavor, this would be a great stout. Somewhat of a letdown."
"O- Really nice stout with quite a bit of smokiness that made for a very nice touch, more smokiness than an beer outside of a rauchbier that I have had."

"o: a very well-brewed little stout, lots of character and everything seems to work towards the whole, drinks easily"

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and slight coffee. Taste is much the same with cocoa and cookie dough flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Overall: The finish is quite intense, like a very strong & bitter coffee. Not top shelf but pretty good for me."
""
"Smoothe across the tongue, damn this is a solid example of a stout."
""
""
"Overall/Comments: Excellent beer. Very well balance. Complex flavor and aroma profile help mask the alcohol content and compliment each other nicely. Classified as a Foreign/Export Stout at 7% ABV. Consumed on 10/9/2012"
""
""
""
"O: Roasty, smoothe, wet, and enough chocolatey sweetness to balance it."
""
""
""
"O: a very solid and flavorful beer. I can understand why it's a friend of mine's favorites. definitely an excellent example of the style and sure to please."

"Overall: a very good export stout. I like the fruit character of the flavor and its overall drinkability. Would definitely have again."
""
"Drink- It was okay. Well it was better than that, but think I am being critical over the graininess and because I like smooth RIS and DRIS. Id probably have this again."
""
"O: If carbonation were less it would really allow for the roasted grain flavor to carry through and finish off with a nice smooth flavor instead of a sharp bitterness."
"O: Great finish, short on delivery. Recommended, but not worth going out of your way. Would maybe have again."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best foreign stouts I’ve had. Knocks the socks off of Guinness. Check it out if you get a chance."
""
"M: Being an export stout, not as big. It's medium leading to full bodied, B to B+"
""
""
"O- Good, not great. I'd love to have it again on tap. Pelican Pub I'll be visiting!"

"O - This is a really good stout. I hope to find more brews from Pelican."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense tan head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some good spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, molasses, toast, light fruitiness, and light herbal hops. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, light char, and light herbal hops. Decent amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, light char, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity; and good malt sweetness to bitterness balance. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent export stout. Great roasted flavor balance and robustness; and quite smooth to drink. Really enjoyable."
""

"Yeah, I'll pay that. That's really powerful and unapologetic, and it works as it is. I can imagine you could make an imperial version of this that I'd enjoy more, but this is under no qualms about what it's trying to do, and for that it's successful."
"This beer wants to be good, but is falling short with some apparent oxidation issues. Flavor is OK...aroma is not..."
""
"O: Very good, drinkable and good representation of the style"
""
""
"O: tasty stout, lots of character, plenty of roast and ash"
"Dark dark brown. Almost black. Forms a thin dark tan head that sticks around. Some light lacing. Aroma is roasted malts and coffee with a metallic note to it. Flavor is heavily roasted malts, dark coffee, chat, and some brighter hops on the finish. Heavy medium body with appropriate carbonation and a moderate hoppy bitterness. A decent beer: fairly aggressively roasted and hopped for the style, but it works."
""
"O: My glass went down pretty quickly, and considering that I don't have easy access to this beer wish that hadn't been the case. Will have to resist the urge to buy this at the expense of other, brand new beers next time I have the chance to pick some up."
"Overall a really solid, if not especially complex, stout from Pelican. Closest I think I've come to a ""session stout."""

"O: very impressive stout. I consider this a sipper."
""
""
"overall: to-style, but not a style I'm too crazy about"
""
""
""
"Tsunami Stout isn’t a giant wave of flavor, but rather a smooth, rolling tide delivering good amounts of fruit and a lot of chocolate, both of which I like. It may be a bit thin, but it’s a quality foreign export."
""
"Pours jet black with a deep mocha colored quick to fade head,even when held to the light nothing gets thru this body.Coffee roast and molasses mainly in then nose,a bit of rawness to it.Not as creamy and full as the label suggests,its not thin or fizzy but not quite what I expected.Earthy and roasted flavors with mild molasses-like sweetness,it's a litle raw in the finish with some woody tomes.Its pretty good but not great,the sweetness creeps up more as I drink more."
""
""
"thick black with you nice nitro layering of the creamy caramel colored head. Lots of settling carbonation and great head retention made this one a keeper from the start. Smell was nice, caramel sugars, hints of roasted chocolate and a nice nutty presence filtered through. Very well rounded and fresh scent. The taste was right on board. Very creamy, and full flavored. Very nice smooth feel going down, awesome. Even better as it warmed! Main flavors were choclate and a nice caramel sweetness"
""
""
"(D)- This is a solid stout. Smells and tastes great with a classic profile. Easy to enjoy without being too sweet or thick. Well done Pelican."
"It's a stout. It's decent. I would gladly drink one again if offered to me but I won't go out of my way to seek it out."

"Drinks lighter than the ABV and initial roastiness would indicate -- a very nice stout."
"O: Not bad, slightly sweeter and thinner body for the style than expected, but good aroma and taste that follows."
"As others have mentioned, the taste is somewhat betrayed by the nose. There is not quite as much sweetness in this stout as the nose implies. However, the taste is well-balanced with a big malt flavor and subtle hints of smoke and dark chocolate. The finish is bitter, but once again, balanced enough to create a very pleasing overall experience. This is a well-crafted stout that I will definitely drink again."
"This is a drinkable export stout. I would like a bit more chocolate but the smell and taste of this will all of the roasted malts is dead on for the style."
"Man, this was really great Stout, full flavored as heck, and just drenching the mouth with a well balanced mix of sweetness and bitter flavors. I just love when a beer that you didn’t have many expectations for just blindsides you with its sheer goodness the way this one did. The Pelican has a real winner here with this one."
"O- Overall, a pretty good offering from Pelican. Not my favorite thing in the world, but I would definitely drink it again."
"A pretty good light stout. Lacks the tartness and depth that more higher gravity stouts possess."
"Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, indescribably drinkable and irresistible. This is like Guinness Foreign Extra on steroids, one of the best stouts I've ever had!! I need to get more of this."
"Aroma is strong and oily with tones of coffee and unsweet chocolate and an overtone of molasses. It pours a deep, warm sable with a thick chocolaty brown head - would have gotten a perfect score in this department if the head had been a little more persistent. Flavor is smoky and sweet, tones of quality coffee, molasses and licorice with a touch of chocolate. Texture is smooth and fizzy, a teensy thin for a stout but still good."
"Overall. Big roasty stout. Good stuff."
"The mouthfeel is about average for the style and carbonation is moderate to maybe a little above average. Overall it was a very flavorful, easy drinking and relatively balanced beer for the style. A very enjoyable stout to start out the night with and an excellent version of the style."
"Really, this is just an excellent beer from Pelican brewing."
"o-a very solid example of a foreign stout and a great beer...ill try to squeeze some more of this from my good friend who sent this my way...thanks again for everything"
"D - Very easy drinking and enjoyable. May not go out of my way to try again, but wouldn't mind a couple pints on tap sometime."
"This beer pours a gorgeous blackness topped off by a nice brown foam. The smell is of roasted malts but mostly just a caramel sweetness. The flavor is composed predominantly of caramel, some dark chocolate and a touch of char. Though aside from malty sweetness and caramel flavoring the others were lost in the fray. This mouthfeel I had anticipated to have been full bodied, and this was more along the realm of medium. This is still a very good stout to drink, and I did enjoy the opportunity to have it since we don't get too much Oregonian beer in Chicago."
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable but not much going on in the flavor dept."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is adequate. Tsunami Stout is quite drinkable and on the dry side. The 7% abv was slightly surprising to me as I thought this one was actually a little lower than that."
" A very nice brew, but look out for Ireland."
"From a bottle, pours black with a tight, creamy cappuccino head. Really nice lacing on this one. Big, expressive nose, full of dark fruits, smokey roasted malt, bitter chocolate and a nice rich coffee bean presence. Surprisingly dry in the mouth, with the dominant flavor being rich, dry, just slightly bitter coffee beans. Chocolate is completely unsweetened but not bitter. Strange mouth feel, the thing is big but it really dries up and thins out a bit on the back palate. Finish is odd and almost like seltzer water. This is a strange dichotomy, some wonderful rich, dry qualities, but this completely flat, thin finish. But as a ""foreign stout"" the dry, relatively light body works well."
"Overall a great dry stout"
"D - Good, big, rich, dark and flavorful. Definitely not too heavy, I could easily do another pint."
"This is a medium bodied offering with a high level of carbonation. What is strange about the carbonation is that it doesn't display much visually but when the brew hits your tongue it is overboard. Overall this is a fine example of the style and very enjoyable."
"Beer is medium to light in body forward sweetness. The finish is a little bitter and a little ashy. Its a decent beer, pretty drinkable but a little thin. I like it, FES are all about like this. Sweeter, lighter, this one is a little ashy and just OK."
"Poured deathly black with a creamy, well formed light tan head that lasted a little briefer than expected (even though I ensured the glass was well cleaned) in my Gulden Draak tulip. A thin cap remained, offering a touch of lace to adorn the sides. Letting the beer air out a bit, I notice the aromas are remarkably similar to the taste, so I shall combine both descriptions. Deliciously roasty, a hint of ash, blended nicely with chocolate and cream. The black patent malt is definitely in there, which is what gives the ashiness and slight tannic taste. A delicately sweet molasses finish, lasting a good moment, before giving way to trails of bitters. The texture is impeccable. I find no faults, as the carbonation is absolutely spot on, lending a smooth, creamy, and ever so slightly prickling character to the medium/heavy body. Not too thick, so it does not enter the realm of what I could consider an imperial stout. This beer is outstanding. One of the best stouts out there. It would pair excellently with a maduro cigar and black forest cake. Or contrast with cannoli's. Either way, DAMN this is good."
"drinkability - quite delicious for a foreign style stout, good coffee notes, smooth"
"Drinkability is very good. This beer has all the characteristics of an RIS but the alcohol is nowhere to be found. This is one of the better extra stouts i have had this year!"
"Overall, great beer from Pelican! One of the best stouts I've had from Oregon. I wish it was more readily available and cheaper, but I'll still seek this one out again."
"D - A good stout but not a great one."
"It pours an opaque black-brown topped by a finger at best of light khaki foam. The nose comprises coffee, dark roasted malts, blackened biscuits, charcoal, and a few slow, viscous drips of molasses. The taste still has strong coffee and roasted malt notes, but these are tempered by some figs, dark wheat, raisins, graham crackers, and dark chocolate powder. The body is a solid medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a nice stout; a pleasant occasional quaff, but not something I'd drink regularly."
"D- Easy to drink, but the bitter burnt taste is not being liked."
"The restaurant offers a Tsunami Stout float on the desert menu. Vanilla ice cream floating in this beer will be something to try on my next visit. Oddly enough, it sounds really good."
"D: Drinkable, tasty, approachable stout."
"Pours pitch black with a light brown head with no retention. Aroma of roasted malt and chocolate. Sweet chocolately flavor with a roasted bitter finish. Medium-full bodied with a great chewy mouthfeel. Is also quite dry. Pretty good stout, this is enjoyable."
"I got this bottle as part of a trade with mikesgroove, thanks Mike! On pouring this looks like it's gonna be good, dark brown-black with a tan milk chocolate color of foam, thick frothy foam too. Really nice curb appeal. Moving closer, roasted malts take the lead in aroma, supported by maybe a little dark chocolate. The taste is just as advertised, sweet malts upfront and some roasty bitterness in the aftertaste. A thick body forms a complement to the richness of the aroma and flavor, a very good beer overall. Excellent, I must try other beers from Pelican."
"It's a good stout, but not elite. Mouthfeel is good."
"Disclaimer: got this bomber on sale at $3 (original price $7) without having any preconceived expectations, so my tastes may have been a bit skewed because of that. However, this was a great stout. Head was a thick, tan foam of sticky goodness, color was midnight black. Aroma and taste of big milk chocolate and coffee with a medium bitterness. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy. I might buy this again at $7, but at $3, I'm going to pick up a case."
"This is an exceptional stout - very complex but imminently drinkable. Color me impressed with yet another Pelican brew."
"Surprisingly subtle and straight-forward - the name had me expecting a big Imperial leviathan rather than a polite slow session beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a biting carbonation, good, but a bit too strong for a Stout."
"Thanks Jeremy... I appreciate the opportunity.. a pretty damn solid beer from a brewery that I almost always overlook.. and a style that I rarely go after."
"D: Surprisingly awesome. A rare big yet refreshing stout."
"The mouth is well carbonated and could be turned down notch, but it has some nice thickness. This is a great end of night option. My first beer from this brewery and I will be on the lookout for others. Well done!"
"This is my first offering from Pelican and I want more."
"Pours a spongey, brown, three finger head that recedes before the first sip very slow. But doesn't leave any lacing. Eventually, the head recedes to a thin film and ring o' foam. Aroma of brownies with just a little espresso and some hoppy spice. Taste starts fudgey and moves to more bitter dark chocolate with just a faint orange rind. The palate finishes with burnt malt bitterness. Very malty, sweet, chocolatey and with the right amount of bitterness. Silky smooth start to the palate with a faintl gristy finish. Pretty good stout overall."
"Drinkability: A beer I could definitely enjoy as a slow sipper for one or two, maybe less of a session beer. The robust but simple flavor would cease to interest me after a few."
"Enjoyable to taste, but honestly 22 oz was a lot to put down. The taste was very rich, the hop was present throughout. This one's a sipper. Schedule some time to work through it. Its worth it, but not something you can do quickly."
"Overall this is a very nicely balanced stout that doesn't try and cram too many flavors in one beer. Worth a shot."
"Pours pitch black completely opaque with a huge frothy tan head that quickly dissipates. Smells of deep roasted malts, coffee, and raisins make up the nose. First sip - The strong rich coffee teams well with the dark roasted malts created the heart of this beer. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Quite tasty indeed."
"Nice!"
"D: Not a huge stout but tasty and very interesting. Drinks pretty easy."
"D - Very roasty and enjoyable."
"D: Big, flavorful brew. Good aroma and a look that exemplifies 'stout' - gorgeous! It's been a while (2+ years) since my last try, need to have this beer more often! Pelican, PLEASE work something out to get these bottles back to the Portland market! Heartily recommended."
"A terrific, sessionable beer that's true-to-style, but won't necessarily knock your socks off. Begins with an inviting, dark-brown pour with slight highlights of ruby, light-tan head formation that rises about 1/4"" and lasts the session with mild lacing throughout. Faint aromas of char, coffee, and mild maltiness- reminds me of Kostritzer Schwarzbier. Flavors, however show a bit more intensity with firm maltiness, light caramel sweetness, with most of the emphasis on the moderate roasted grains which gives the beer a coffee, nutty, cocoa flavor. Creamy, light, and airy body with some roasted grain astringency late. Finishes with a moderate roasty taste and powdery feel. Quite sessionable and non-offensive. A pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability: A little too over the top in the roasty department to me, but that is a minor detraction from an otherwise very good beer"
"3.9/5.0"
"D: It was a nice enjoyable stout, very drinkable. It was light bodied and had a moderate ABV making it a rare stout candidate for a session beer."
"Poured from a 22oz Bottle thanks to kmweaver. Aroma is somewhat subdued, yet distinct in some salty coffee roast. Pours a rich black-brown, fringes mahogany, rim of tan. Dense roast flavor, cherry chocolate with toasted almond caramel, brown sugar and flan. Great dense, expressive flavor. Clean, bright, lively and fresh. All the aspects are subtly nuanced making this beer rounded and enjoyable. Some warming sensation from the background. Hops come in nicely with suave chocolate, mint sophistication. Salty. Toothy. Beautiful attenuation, finishing crisply."
"D: A very drinkable heavy, reasonably high alcohol beer. The beer overall is balanced quite nicely, and a few bombers would be great to have, especially on a cold day. A little out of season, but it went well with today."
"D: Very drinkable."
"I like the FES style, thanks Derek. Smooth drinking. Dark brown with soapy head. Roast and malt nicely balanced, bitterness at the finish. Some coco, light coffee, and its in the nose too.Carbonation is suitable, medium mouthfeel.Nice balanced stout."
"In the mouth it was chewy and encompassing. Finish was toffee and caramel. Wonderfully pleased with the large wave stout."
"Drinkability is just above average. While it's a nicely rounded and well executed stout, and drinks lighter then 7% ABV, it just didn't excite me to much."
"Appearance is a dark chocolate almost black with a thick, creamy dark head. Smell of roasted malts with light coffee and chocolate. Taste is pretty much the same with a dark chocolate bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with a good balance of hops and carbonation, making this is a good healthy stout to try."
"Drinkability: Really flavorful yet drinkable stout. Alcohol isn't a big factor, flavors are big but not challenging, very tasty and balanced."
"22 oz. Black color. Chocolate brown head. Intriguing malt complexity in the nose, with hints of chocolate, fudge and light coffee. On the palate, its awfully complex, with hints of dried chocolate, light espresso, fruit and mild roast. Clearly a great stout."
"App - 4, Smell - 4, Taste - 3.5, Mouth - 4, Drink - 4"
"Good stout. Nothing special, but pleasurable to have something different. Not deep, dont come into this beer looking for much, but you will ger a tasty, fresh and mild stout."
"The obligatory chocolate/coffee in high concentration makes up the bulk of the aroma. Strong roasted malt elements follow with am ever so faint hint of brown sugar and chocolate cake. The body is an uncanny stygian black. One of the darker beers youll see. The head starts off a full two fingers thick, but slowly compresses down to a thumb thick mocha affair. The fore features highly concentrated burnt/roasted malt with dark chocolate and dry cocoa notes. Some slightly sulphery blackstrap molasses and nutty notes in the dry chcolatey finish. Great palate. Solid aroma. Decent flavor."
"This is a brewery/brewpub on its way up. The India Pelican Ale is a great hoppy beer, and this one is a sleeper and not nearly heard about enough. A place to visit and a beer to try and/or trade for if you can. A true treat."
"Cheers."
"This beer is quite tasty, but it could definitely use a bit more general malt character; a bit thicker and maltier would make this beer a bit more balanced, but then it would be a bit harder to get through a 22oz bottle. As this beer warms up a bit it gains a bit more fullness in the mouth, and correspondingly a bit more malt character. It could still use a bit more, but it is a bit more balanced than it first was when it was 50*F."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for the surprise hookup. Deep black color with a thick and foamy brown head that dissipates steadily. The aroma is chocolate and malt, with a subtle vinous character here and there. Rich body, with a nice blend of coffee and cocoa flavors along with roasted malt and hops. The finish is hoppy and nutty and roasty. Very enjoyable from start to finish."
"Drinkability: Hook me up to the IV. This is great. Wonderful tasting, not too heavy handed. Very well done. Strongly recommended."
"My friend picked this up for me from the Pelican. He raved about the views, but didn't care much for the food or the beer. So far I've had the India Pelican Ale (which I didn't rate, but came to enjoy after it warmed and the malts had a chance to beat down that insane hop nose and finish) and this splendid stout. I'm hoping his culinary experience was an aberration, as I'm going to be hitting that place up over Thanksgiving (and I refuse to leave the premises without at least four bombers of this). Excellent stuff, and one of the best new (to me) stouts I've had out of an Oregon brewery in quite some time."
"Had on tap at the brewery in July 2005. I had the mega pint for $5. The first stip reveals a strong taste of coffee and roasted flavors. A typical stout. The mouthfeel is a little creamy. I'm not sure of the ABV but it seemed to pack a little bit of a punch. Maybe because I hadn't had anything to eat. Good perhaps a little overrated but a decent and solid stout offering."
"Who knew that 'white horses' is another name for a tsunami? Pelican Tsunami Stout is more like a herd of big, black Arabian horses rampaging across the taste buds. I haven't had a lot of Foreign/Export stouts, nor do I purport to understand how they differ from other stout styles. What I do know is that this beer is delicious and is a testament to the skill of the good folks at Pelican Pub & Brewery."
"How did the Basement Pub know to select Pelican's two best brews? Good work."
"Served on tap at 'bones...Very black and opaque. Dark coffee colored head, looked like espresso. Dark roasted coffee aroma. Let's carry the whole coffee connection throughout the review...Tastewise it hought it was coffee like all the way, no room for cocoa or chocolate notes. Mouthfeel was medium and prickly. I thought this was a well made brew, nothing was lacking."
"It drinks well too."
"Comments - Big thanks to skyhand for popping this one at one of her famous tasting events."
"Thanks to Skyhand for this beauty."
"Pelican serves this on nitro through a spinner at their brewpub. Apparently a spinner, or sparkler is a type of agitator that attaches to the tap and allows greater aeration of the beer as it flows out the spigot. On tap Tsunami is liquid black pearls, though Ive had this from the bottle and the bottled version didnt rock my world nearly so forcefully."
"Similar to Shakespeare Stout but I prefer this. Ink black with brown highlights, a soft and substantial head forms but dwindles to a ring, leaving little wisps of lace down the glass. Chocolatey aroma with a charcoal roastiness. Tsunami Stout is initially quite bitter, with herbal hops leaping across the tongue. They are soon mellowed by the full, thorough roasty quality of the malts. Evocative of both the salt sprayed air of the Oregon coast, and the proliferation, nay, infestation, of espresso bars throughout the Northwest. Slight flecks of chocolate, brown sugar, licorice, and raisin flavors soon fall by the wayside as the hop bitterness returns to pair up with the burnt, huge malts. Aftertaste is creamy, chocolatey, balanced by slight mint and pine hop qualities. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, just the right amount of slippery. Drinkability a bit low for me; as with many serious stouts, patience is rewarded, and haste makes for unneccesary and unwelcome waste."
"Wow.. what a nice roasty beer from skyhand. Pours with a nice whipped cream tan head. Pitch black body as should come from a stout. Almost, but not quite overpoweringly roastly flavor. This flavor is right on the edge for me. Its there, but not over the top. A great potential session beer. Overall, a darn good beer."
"22 oz bomber bought on my last trip to Lincoln City, Oregon. Wonderful yet slightly understated roasted dark coffee aroma..slight hint of a milky smell. Jet black in appearance with a nice sized creamy tan head. A very, very tasty stout..very milk chocoalty, cocoa taste to start..then a liquorice tinted bitterness at the end..all the time very smooith and creamy. felles excellent on the tongue. Fantastic stout..anyone fed up with those Murphy/Guiness/Beamish nitro stouts should try this beauty."
"Pours a deep, dark chocolate -- opaque in the glass - -with a small, creamy mocha brown head. Smells of sweet malt, wet leather, and bittersweet chocolate. Excellent mouthfeel -- rich, chewy and full. Beautiful flavor -- woody, chocolate, toasted nuts -- with a well blended bitterness that is there, but not biting. Very drinkable for a stout of this complexity."
"The stream from the bottle is a cola brown that turns into black in the glass. The head is a nice size, dense, a good medium tan that lasts as a fuzzy film and laces nicely. The aroma is almost spot on. Great coffee and chocolate nose with the java being dominant. Hops are present in the aroma, but more so in the flavor. The flavor doesn't quite live up to the aromas promise being a little overwhelmed by the hops. Still an excellent stout."
" though still dark, acidic, and bittersweet. Full of lasting flavor, too. the name, however, had me anticipating a monsoon of flavor, like an Imperial Stout, and that is not the case. An excellent ""regular"" stout, shall we say, but one still abundant with flavor. Quite nice, actually, and remarkably similar to Guinness Extra Stout."
"This is a very good smooth stout without any bitter bite."
"I lugged this one all the way across the country with me from Portland and resisted it sitting in my fridge until tonight. Beautiful, dark dark dark color. Pours fairly thick with minimal head. Malty, coffeeish aroma. Beautiful taste, a WHOLE lot of malt, some coffee, a faint hint of chocolate and chicory. Dry mouthfeel, but not too dry. Semi-sweet aftertaste. This is a wonderful beer from one of my favorite breweries in the world. Darren does a great job out on the coast, I wish I weren't 3000 miles away now."
"Deep midnight black color, medium tan foamy head. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. WOW! Bid full bodied Dry stout. Roasted malt flavor. Coffee and chocolate, slightly sweet at the start and then transform into a dry hoppy finish. Bid bold flavor, yet nothing is overpowering. The sweetness is balanced by the hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, more of a chocolate bitterness than a hop bitterness. Well deserving of the GABF Gold Medal. Painted/ Etched Beer bottle."

"This beer poured very dark, almost black and formed a huge dark tan foam head that left lots of nice circular lace around the glass as it subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee and chocolate with some toasted/roasted elements. A flavor of malt, coffee and chocolate. A very interesting sweetness is present in the finish, yet a touch of bitterness. Almost like bittersweet chocolate. A very good stout."
"Completely absorbant opaque black hue. Well retained mud brown head leaves Belgian lace. Bittersweet dark chocolate, and sharp, carbonaceous roasted barley dominate the aroma, with secondary support from butterscotch diacetyl and nutty carob. Trace dryish date esters and heaty alcohol surface with a swirl. Quite appetizing in aroma. Prune laced sweetness initially in flavor is superceded by a melange of assertive burnt barley and citrus tinged hop bitterness. Chocolate malt presence melds with mellow, treacle undertones to lend an earthy, semisweet, raw cacao impression mid palate. Moderate in body, with a quasi dry, well attenuated mouthfeel. Finishes with a snap of roasted barley sharpness yielding to lingering deep, yet agreeable molasses sweetness. Tsunami stout has tremendous chocolate and roasted grain character, yet retains an elegant dryness. Delicious, satiating and quaffable."
"The pour as dark as they get, head is voluminous, lace is fine sheets, both chocolate brown and both deliquesce quickly. Nose is malt, light hints of coffee, toasted grains, sweet. Front is malt sweet, the top light to medium in mouth feel. The beer finishes with mild carbonation, the hop pleasantly persistent through the droughty malt aftertaste. Quite a nice stout, drinkable and robust enough to keep my interest. Ranks #178 on my current 1000 beer master list."
