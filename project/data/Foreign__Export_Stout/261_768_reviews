"Overall this beer was good but nothing extraordinary. It drinks easily, its been in my closet for at least a year so that may be the cause. I would drink this beer again but seeing as its from Massachusetts I wouldnt go out of my way to procure it, glad to receive it in a trade though."

"O: Interesting FES. Lots of char and chocolate and SUPER dry. The aftertaste is practically like eating cocoa powder. One of the driest stouts I've ever had. Overall the flavors are decent but the dryness is kinda off-putting."

"O: This is an interesting though fairly big foreign/export stout which significant amounts of roast and char flavors/aromas. The hoppiness really starts to become more apparent as the beer warms up."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and nice and dry, burnt and roasty."

"Captain Swainâ€™s is good on its own, with deep conversation or a juicy ribeye."

"Thick beer, chocolate up front and coffee and lots of roast in the finish, to burnt parts. Appearance of a chocolate ice cream soda. Much more bitter than sweet, despite mollasses,but consistent with the style. Spot of wood.Big mouthfeel. Good drinking."
"O/D-Could this be my first Foreign/Export Stout review? Shocking. This was pretty kick-ass. They made naturally contradicting flavors come together quite well. This brew deserves more publicity. I got it for $5.99 per 22 oz. and I find that to be a decent exchange. Far hoppier than anticipated. One of my favorite Cisco brews."

"Black with a light brown head, pretty thick retention and quite a bit of lace/retention. Nose is almost black IPA-like, lots of dark chocolate and roast, with quite a bit of piney hops. A bit of citrus in there too, a hint of smoke. taste has more dark chocolate, strong roasted malt character and again with a bit of sweetness, a hoppy piney finish. Drying finish and bitter coffee grains linger. Medium body and medium carbonation. Would revisit on a colder day, bomber is a bit much for one person - nicer to share I'd imagine."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, ruby-brown color with a light brown, thin head. The nose is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and a slight hops presence that all blends together into an intoxicating, dark aroma. Roasted palate, with bitter coffee highlights and cocoa nib characteristics. The aftertaste is smokey and roasted, with a smooth, bitter finish. Great lacing on the glass as you go, making this an all-around great drinker."
"O: Have not had too much from this brewer, but am always down to try and extra stout bomber for $4. Not bvery disappointing, has all the characteristics of a stout, plus a few extra ingredients. I give it a solid thumb up!"
"I've enjoyed Capt Swains for years and realized only today that I'd never reviewed it. Incidentally this makes a great black and tan if you have a bottle of Whale Tail Pale handy."

"Strong, smoky aroma has firm notes of molasses, caramel and quality coffee. It pours a rich, warm, opaque sable with a thick, fine-bubbled, light tan head. Rich flavor has molasses, roast coffee, caramel and charred wood notes plus a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Full-bodied texture has a good amount of fizz, and leaves a nice smoky tingle."

"Taste is a smooth malty bomb with some interesting smoke notes and piney resin. Hint of chocolate. Lasting dryness from the hops. Not as complex as I hoped. But a very good stout. Unusual."

"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle with no expiration or bottling date listed. Sampled on February 6, 2012. It pours a deep, dark black with a khaki-brown head that fluffs up and lingers for an extended amount of time. The aroma is vibrant and complex with dark malts and dark fruit accompanied by a pungent earthy or pine hopped bitterness. The body is medium to bold. The taste begins with the malty character but is then broken up by a powerful hoppy bite that ends dry. This is unlike other stouts I have had."
""
"Smells great, tastes hoppier than expected. Very nice and a surprise buy for me. I'll definitely get more!"

"Chinook hops are so perfect in their way that they seem to epitomize the very scent and charm (and must) of the forest, it's as if the old wood's daintiest thought had materialized in this foreign stout. The hops notwithstanding, this even has strong wine- and cigar-like qualities. It is an unusual, characterful, and curious drink."
"M - Smooth, delicious flavors, and well-balanced. Huge fan of this beer. First stout that I've poured with sediment at the bottom of the glass, as well. Incredibly easy and enjoyable to drink. I will definitely drink this again."
"D - Having never heard of this brewery before picking this beer up on a whim, I didn't necessarily expect much but I was blown away by the first sip. The aroma is absolutely spectacular and the flavor profile backs it up with a dark complexity that holds up well against the best of the style. Really nice and at less than $6 for a bomber it is a good value too. If I could get this at home I would buy a few to cellar as this beer seems like it would only improve with time."

"D - An interesting two faced stout... The nose is sweet and rich... The palette is roasted and charred to a maximum with only a touch of sweetness... Interesting and surprising... A solid brew all the way around..."
"O: Overall, this is definitely one of the better Foreign Extra Stouts I've had, personally I find it better than the Guinness Foreign Extra. I would definitely buy this again."
"Ends with a bite. It ain't sweet. Nice to have this one."
"Overall it's a fine stout-- I think there's plenty of room for improvement, still I'm certain I'll buy another bottle."
"O - a good stout"
"O-decent beer. Subtle smoke and lots of maltiness. Would like to try more from this place."
"Pretty nice stout. Would drink this again."
"This beer pours a dad brown to black color with a good sized tan head. The smell is roasty with a hint of chocolate there is also a good hop presence. The flavor follows suit with a good hop and roasty bitterness and a wonderful medium mouthfeel with a little sweetness to it bthe carbonation is medium and overall this is a pretty damn good beer."
"I like this one quite a bit. It's enjoable but not entirely balanced."
"The body is a bit on the light side but the carbonation is good and somewhat soft. Not bad here. Kind of underwhelming. Enjoyable nevertheless."
"D: Would love to drink this again. The thin mouthfeel of this (as opposed to a thicker Imperial Stout) is refreshing, and I wish more brewers would experiment with this style."
"Been saving this one for a while now. Pitch black opaque beer. Light brown head that's holding nicely and clinging to the glass. Looks good. Smells ultra chocolaty with a hint of booze in the aroma. Smooth in terms of booziness, but it is very acidic on the tongue. Nice bread flavors, toast mixed with intense dark chocolate. Flavors build up and finger for a while. The smokiness comes off more like an ashy flavor, I'm not really into it. Strong and very dark beer. Probably should have busted this one out in the winter."
"Decent enough stout that I'll be happy to quaff, but nothing distinctive about it, & the smoke/roast/harsh combo just doesn't quite do it for me."
"D: A decent stout, with an overpowering hop bite that doesn't really fit in my opinion."
"Very dark, basically black, with a fine cap of brown bubbles. Good head retention, thick and clumpy lacing. Smells malty, caramel and a little toffee, roast, with grassy hops. Nutty and a bit citrusy, earthy with a hint of licorice behind more prominent molasses. Bitterness was solid and balanced the caramel sweetness, lots of grapefruit, alcohol, chocolate and roast, hint of sour cherries, lots of biscuity flavor. Full bodied, lowish carbonation, mild warmth, fairly smooth in texture. Tasty!"
"I was impressed by this one. Definitely a hoppy stout worthy of rough seas."
"Overall this was a very nice stout and a great effort"
"Poured a slow to emerge 2"" mocha colored head. Body is dark as coffee. Smells of chocolate malt and hops. Taste is a weaker form of the chocolate malt and a stronger form of the hops. There's a nice acidic zing. All of this so far would have landed it somewhere in B range to me but the long long finish moved it across the border into A-. Like the end of the label write-up says it's ""a resiny hop finish that lasts & lasts"". Yes it does. Plus I don't see on the bottle how much alcohol this has but I had quite the happy buzz after my pint."
"Saw this one today at Mile High Wine just west of Denver, not knowing Cisco was distributed out here. Poured a medium black color with a loose finger of light brown foam. Aromas of bitter chocolate, piney hops and roasted malt. On the palate, medium bodied, with roasted malt, chocolate and ash."
"This is one deep, complex stout. Bottle-conditioned, not much head forms over (or remains from) the thick-as and dirty-as spent motor oil viscous malt nectar that silkily pours out. Superb, seemingly bottomless depth to the aroma. A bit yeast-funky and oxidized maybe, dark pureed dried fruit softly pokes through a predominantly rich, 3-day old chocolate-biscuit malt aroma accented with a smooth toasty roastiness. Damn near milk-forward (chilled) hot cocoa density carries a quasi-sweetish, cakey, not so much bitter yet toasty-burnt-gritty cocoa malt taste. A drink to be sipped and savored. That subtle funk rears its head from time to time, but really only to yawn heartily and sink back into its delicious pillow. Yeah, I really liked this and can't wait to try it again, my friend."
"Flavors of dark chocolate and roasted coffee beans showcasing a serious malt profile. Finishes with a hint of pine and liberally hopped. Respectable 8% ABV too."
"22oz bottle $5.99. Dark black, sizable brown head. Smells like a stout but nothing wowed me. The taste was rich stout with a distinct pine on the back end, very intriguing and I wonder what varieties of hops were used in this beer. Overall this beer was a very good value for the money."
"This is an above average effort."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how well it fit the bill. It had a robust aroma and taste, and looked the part. Where it actually stood apart was in the feel, where it was overly smooth and soft drinking. This beer, with its name, label, and ridiculous thirteen malts, has a darkly ominous tone to which it does not disappoint."
"Drinkabilty is meh, pretty bitter and stouty, little salty, fairly dry, bit of burnt coffee grinds."
"Notes: Excellent. My personal favorite within its style as of right now. A big, bold beer. Very smokey, and even more so as it warms. This might be a little overwhelming to some, but it definitely tickled my fancy. Why don't more American breweries produce Foreign/Export stouts and Extra Stouts?"
"D - A great beer for a cold night like the one I'm experiencing right now. Found it similar to Guinness' Foreign Stout which is one of my go-to's. So much flavor in this one, I truly had a lot of difficulty putting it down."
"A really nice effort and well worth trying, if not regularly drinking."
"D - Very well-done. Way more than I was expecting."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the chocolate with a little bit of roasted malt mixed in. The flavor is chocolate, roasted malt and some alcohol. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer."
"Thanks Joe. Pours a deep brown/black color with a small brown head. Rich chocolate malts in the nose, a perfect amount of sweet and roasty balance. Velvety smooth with no apparent alcohol note. Very drinkable, a perfect night cap. A truly impressive stout."
"Pours black, 2 fingers head that stays, beautiful lacing. Â Smell chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Tastes are coffee and hop in the middle, pretty smooth. Mouthfeel is medium and overall this beer is very drinkable."
"On tap at the brewery"
"Notes: Pretty drinkable, definitely does not feel like 8% ABV - more like 5ish"
"This is a fine extra stout with excellent character. The generous malt and roasted qualities are quite tasty, but not overwhelming. This is a treat for any stout lover."
"d - I thought this was a pretty well balances, easy to drink stout. I was surprised it was 8% ABV; I would have guessed more like 5 to 6%. I would definitely try this beer again."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, very chewy, low carbonation, very drinkable. A real nice export stout, thanks Russ!"
"Delicious! A bold, but amazingly drinkable stout."
"Love it. If I wasnt going the malty barleywine route, Id head up this non RIS type stout."
"drinkability is good. the prominent hopping and lack of sweetness makes this one more an american stout than a foreign export stout. bold and delicious."
"Pours black with a slightly more than a film head. Smells of dark fruits, coffee, roasted malt, and booze (more than I would have thought for 8%). Tastes much of the same but with a very bitter bite right up front that was not one of those pleasant bitter bites. The fruit came back towards the end but not enough to balance this out. Medium to heavey bodied and not very drinkable at all in my opinion."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. This must be a fresh bottle, because the first thing I can smell in this brew after pouring it into the glass is pine hops. There's also roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and dark fruit in the aroma. Once the beer has been in the glass a little while, the malty aromas get stronger. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt and a bit of caramel. The malty flavors come out stronger in the taste, but the hops are still pretty noticable. This is one of the hoppier stouts I've had recently. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and velvety. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth, tasty and just plain easy to drink! I think this is a pretty good overall brew, the next time I head to the East Coast I'll have to buy this again. This is the first beer I've tried from Cisco Brewers, and it hopefully won't be the last."
"[Hopefully Swain's descendants are leaving the whales alone these days (see bottle label)]"
"I really like the soothing full body of this beer and how it carries the brooding smoked peat character. It made me want to grow a beard and put on a sweater."
"at only 6 bucks for a big bottle this is a steal for any stout/ipa lovers. i just wish i would have waited for my sarah on this one. she's gonna love it."
"D - one would be okay, but my dislike of hop flavor would keep me from having a second."
"D: It's a bit of a sipper, but quite enjoyable."
"This poured an opaque pitch black with moderate tan head. It smelled like orange with some milk chocolate and floral hops, and a bit of coffee. It tasted like orange and floral hops, with some milk chocolate and burnt coffee. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was very hoppy for a stout, reminding me much more of a black IPA. It still had a clean and fairly enjoyable flavor, with decent body. It hid the alcohol well too, so it was pretty easy to drink. This beer was nice and interesting, and I would recommend trying it once. Just don't expect anything amazing."
"Flavor is good, but nothing special. Creamy, smooth, and medium body. Carbonation is pretty average. Picking up a ton of roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate. The hops really take over the last wave of flavor, but not overkill bitterness. Finally the beer ends with a decent aftertaste of coffee. Overall, a pretty decent stout."
"Taste is rich malty and chocolaty with a bevy of dark fruits and a slightly acridic taste in there as well. Slight hop bite midway through leaves a long lingering roast bitterness in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel, medium body, high level of carbonation. I'm not sure if there are some wild yeasts in here or if its supposed to taste this way. The Belgian character is subtle, but its strong enough to notice and the carbonation is a bit high. Its an ok brew as is, but I think it could be so much better. If I dare resample this one I will re-review."
"D: Very drinkable stout, loved how the flavors blended on this one."
"D: This brew packs a punch. Not for the faint of heart: less than halfway through my glass, I can feel its effects beginning to kick in. For a session occasion, pass her by. For a special strong stout, though, this one's hard to top. Food? Devil's Food Cake, or some good seared scallops or oysters."
"Drinkability: The acidity is the only thing holding this one back for me."
"Very tasty, drinkable stout. Well done!"
"Thick and rich body, just a small raspy wood finish to minimally distract from an overall impressive brew."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark opaque brown. Poured with a thick froathy 3 finger light brown head. The head mostly dissapeared, but left a small layer and clung to the sides of the glass very well. Aroma was slightly bitter, finished as a brown sweet sugar smell. Taste was strongly of chocolate, a bit bitter like a dark chocolate. Nicely creamy. Coated inside the mouth very well, great consistency with a balanced amount of carbonation. ABV hit a touch hard, but was a very pleasant drink."
"The taste is very assertive. First off this is a thick, full bodied, full palated creamy stout. It has a nice charred brown sugar taste, lots of chocolate and dark malts, a nice hoppy presence, and some mocha tastes as well. There is just a ton of malt in the beer and it is well balanced with leafy hop. The mouthfeel is a tad oily and the aftertaste lingers a bit, but this is just a very warming, very assertive, creamy and rich stout that hits lots of high notes."
"D: Pretty good. It took me just over an hour to drink the bomber while watching the Yankees beat the Angels in Game Six of the ALCS."
"Not bad. Not quite an imperial stout but sure has more of a kick than a dry stout. Worth a try at least once but only if you can get past the carbonation."
"Overall Impression: A harsh Stout; not for the faint of palate. Like standing too close to a stage speaker at a concert with poor accoustics, Captain Swain dishes out a deafening roar of roast. It's a young-tasting garage band of a beer: raw and untamed. It could benefit from some alcohol and body."
"Roasted, near-burnt coffee and chocolate malts hit the palate and coat the sides of the tongue with an acrid bitterness. Smoke and earthen hops follow, while lasting notes of charred earth linger long into the finish. Sadly, this is a bit too one-dimensional for me, and I find myself missing the complexities picked up in the aroma. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and watery for a stout, more porter-like in its consistency. (Burps are tasting like band-aids...gross). Pretty good drinkability, though; not too heavy, and goes down smoothly, although a bomber might give me some trouble. Still, an interesting beer at any rate!"
"A very good stout, and I feel this one is a good example of the Export Stout style. Roasty and heavy without being to the level of an RIS, increasing the drinkability a bit. Recommended."
"D- a great stout."
"D, notes: Roasted and dry - too much so."
"Notes from: 3/7/07"
"Pours deep black with a nice, thick head (definitely decant this, because there is a lot of sediment at the bottom - i made that mistake the first time I had this beer). The aroma has some chocolate, and a little french roast but overall is not as strong as I would've liked. The taste is of baker's chocolate, slightly bitter, and some hops linger. There is also some astringency from the alcohol. The body is full and beautiful, and this is a decently drinkable imperial stout."
"This growler came from the brewery on Nantucket, and was served at about forty degrees. Pour was in to a chalice style glass. Color was pitch black, with a sizable tan heading, which is very characteristic of encounters with this beer in the past, but more controlled (meaning I did not have to wait 15 minutes for the massive heading to die down). Smell reveals roasted coffee bean, hints of marshmallow, more hints of blackberry, intermingling of dark and milk chocolates as well. Taste is very complex. Loads of bitter coffee flavors come through, as well as an ample earth bound taste that takes some time to get used to. More evidence of dark bitter chocolate builds as it glides around the palate. mouthfeel is fairly medium when considering the strength of its alcohol. Certainly packed with flavor from all the bitter coffee and earth tones. Drinkability suffers only a little bit because is takes a bit of getting used to. This is my second glass tonight, and I cannot see myself going back to it until...mmmm probably tomorrow night. Overall, this in my eyes is one of the most unique stouts, and possibly beers that New England has to offer. It is a shame that you rarely see brews from Cisco on tap apart from their Whale's Tale Pale Ale (even though that is another good beer). One to seek out for sure, and if you are on the island, get a growler, as it is much better than out of the bottle. Cheers"
"D: This is a likable, drinkable beer, with a good personality and character."
"Decent effort from Cisco. A little thin but after a slow start it finishes solidly."
"This is mouthcoating but very drinkable. Finish is a bit molasses/coffee/hoppy, but quite pleasant. Overall, a real drinker. Another great one from Cisco. This stuff is hit or miss to find, so if you see it, grab one."
"Prosit, MK"
"Thanks Corey!"
"Pours black with brown highlights when held up to light, MASSIVE foamy light-brown head, decent lacing. What is it with Cisco and these gargantuan heads? It's crazy, but I guess it's part of their charm. Initial smell is hoppy, really hoppy. There's some roasted coffee bean and chocolate smells in there, too, but the hoppiness is surprising. Really excellent coffee taste, some bitter chocolate, the hops come through as well, which is interesting. High level of carbonation makes this seem oddly refreshing, for a stout, while it does maintain a decent amount of chewiness...great lingering coffee bitterness. It's another great beer from Cisco!!"
"I would wait a year a try again - just to see what happens when the hop aroma fades. Nice drinking beer, good taste, amazing head retention, but overcarbonated and not as full/strong/""extra"" as I want to see."
"D: good brew and worthy of a try. a little high on the alcohol in the long run, session-wise."
"Drinkability: What a great Foreign/Export Stout this was! I enjoyed my time drinking this one. It's dark, full flavored, and full bodied like a Stout should be. If only they would increase the roasted flavors in the taste a bit, but I know I can't have everything. That doesn't matter because I would be pleased to drink this one again in the near future."
"A friend brought this to a tasting and I'm glad he did. Pours a black body with a red hue and a nice thick, rich tan head. The interesting aroma seems to be comprised of roasted malts, some chocolate and some sourdough. A thin mouthfeel for a stout, but it's good. Lots of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate in the flavors. Also a little bit of a hop kick to it, which made it that much better."
"Overall a well crafted beer with an impressive supposed 13 different malts. I was hoping for something sweeter with less astringent citrus flavors however. It just tastes like the yeast was a little stressed to me... I never find those citrus tastes in stouts very pleasant."
"Had on tap at union brewhouse. Just tapped- pured an opaque black with huge, creamy tan head. Impressive floral hop smell for a stout. Some coffee or toffe in the nose, also. First sip- wow- strong! I get a huge bitter hit! Some coffee and chocolate notes, but hgue hop afterburn! As I drink it is still strong- does not mellow as I go. Good full flavor with a medium body. I have to stop after one of these!"
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/2"" brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head holds well, with a thick, slow-falling layer of frothy lace. Aroma is hearty dark grains coupled with ample hoppiness. Taste follows the nose, rich full dark maltiness and prickly hoppiness, warmth at the close. Mouthfeel suffers from the common Cisco promblem over excessive carbonation, all the bubbles on the tongue just get in the way. Drinkability is alright, limited by bubbles, but the flavor makes me want more. Not bad overall, makes me want to try again."
"Pours a pretty opaque black color with a monumental dirty white head; great tracing. Tons of chocolate and coffee in the aroma along with requisite roasted malts, a touch of floral and citrus hops. Overall, its seems very creamy, as though this is an oatmeal or milk stout. On the palate, the roasted and black malts take force with some tough bitterness up front, good floral hops in the mid palate, and a nice roasty finish. A tad thin for an imperial, but labeled as an export stout, its quite nice. The coffee flavor really continues through making this a very drinkable stout for such a blustery cold day."
"D: Fairly easy drinking and the 8% is hidden well. Beer just seems to not quite reach what it could have."
"D: Goes down pretty easy, but it's heavy. Will be a chore to finish all of this 1pt. 9 fl. oz. bottle, but that's to be expected. I will probably get it again at some point."
"Overall, a nice choice for a stout. I prefer stouts that are more on the chocolatey side, rather than the coffee variety, but this is something I would get again."
"A full flavored Export Stout, true to the style but I'd like to see some secondary flavors come through besides the rough hops and roasted malts."
"Drinkability: Nice stout here. I will definitely drink more of this if/when I see it available."
"A gift from a friend, this is an interesting brew. ItÂ’s completely black, with a sticky tan head. The smell is of coffee and tobacco, mixed with a little alcohol, chocolate, and charcoal. ThereÂ’s a lot of highly roasted and nearly burnt grain in this brew. ItÂ’s taste is punctuated with a lactic sourness, but it is framed with a little sweet malt. ThereÂ’s a lot of flavor in the taste, with a bit of dark, ripe fruit and sweetness. Not very bitter. ItÂ’s full and mouthcoating, with a nice complexity. Very good."
" B ."
"Overall a good beer. Recommended"
"Drinkability: Bearing in mind the source, this beer is a real disappointment. I haven't been on Nantucket since 1976, but I suspect I would like this beer a whole lot better if I were there. Put a date on it, Cisco!"
"Drinkability: decent, but personally this brew did not satisfy the ""I need a good stout"" urge when I picked up the bottle. Worth a try though."
"This one is a very solid offering but lacks the complexity to take it to the next level. Overall, a great beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
"M&D - other than the massive amounts of carbonation, this beer is very drinkable and a great brew, a high quality stout"
"Poured an ink black with a huge blooming mocha colored head,I have noticed on a few of the Cisco offerings I have had there are some real overcarbonation issues either from age or whatever but its a litle annoying.The nose was very nice highly roasted barley smoke and charred dark fruit mainly with a lighter roasted nut note as well.Somewhat prickly mouthfeel from it being a bit overcarbonated keeps the drinkabilty from being all that great,flavor wise though its a nice brew he heavily roasted barley and smokiness returns along some kaluah-like alcohol sweetness and dark fruit finishing somewhat woody.A big complex stout I bet age has something to do with that overcarbonated body I would love to taste a fresh bottle."
"the best cisco brew I have tried, I have not been too impressed with their other offerings but this beer is very very good. When I am in the mood for a porter with a little more ABV kick I will go to this."
"This was the best bottle I've ever gotten of this stout. I've had some seriously over carbonated bottles and I've had some extremely flat bottles. They seem to have some quality control problems to work out. Best if you get their products on island as off island brews are not the same."
"Complex, dry, but easy to drink. The dark and dry onslaught is easier on the palate than description belies. A winner in a rare and under-understood style."
"Once the carbonation settled down, this was a pretty good beer, though a bit too vinuous for my tastes."
"Update after contact with brewer. Brewer admits to carbonation and suggests letting the beer settle, offered to send me a fresh one which he believes will not be as heavily carbonated as the one I sampled. Very good response and quick, will update after I have the next one."
"Worth a try but a strange brew."
"Very tasty; complex and drinkable"
"This pours a ink black with a giant tan foamy head.The carbonation is really something.You can hear the bubbles.The smell is not strong and kind of a disappointment.You can make out some coffee,but that's about it.The taste has a good deal of coffee and chocolate,but it may be too carbonated to taste the more subtle flavors.The beer is heavy,but the balance is off because of the carbonation.This,other than the carbonation problem, is a damn good and tasty beer that I will try again."
"Mouthfeel is of chocolate and black malts pumping through with sweetness and a mild chewiness. Medium-Full bodied."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a towering tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful black and roasted malt scent along with a hearty hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a rich black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes earthy and warm. It has some hints of chocolate and coffee, along with a mild hop flavor. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation (bottle conditioned). Overall, this is a damn good beer. I like the big beer feel as well as the hop character. It's a tastey brew; a good drinker."
"This one lets a nice loud pop when opened. A small bit tried to escape the top of the bottle, but I caught it before it could make its way out. It pours VERY heady...about 4 fingers over top. The foam even creaps back out of the bottle after pouring 2 glasses. Wow. At least it has good retention and is only foam. I'm having a hard time pouring the rest of the beer due to the foam. The beer is a nice black color. The nose is slightly sour that somewhat obscures the rest of the nose. There are roasted tones hiding behind, but that sour really takes the cake. The flavor is also slightly sour. A light roasted and coffee note comes through, but the sourness really puts me off. The feel is light, with a light carbonation. Drinkability is actually really good for a beer of 8%. Its the flavor and nose that sort of turn me away from it."
"Pours a dark color with tremendous sized head and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Takes forever to pour ... and the bottle wants to push some of the foam out of the bottle while we're waiting. The aroma has a lot of chocolate tones along with some other dark malts. The flavor has a lot of active carbonation. Good chocolate flavors and only some hints of other dark malts. The roased malts seem to come forth more as it warms. A little bit of sweetness and some sourness. The body is on the thick end of moderate, but the carbonation takes a little away from it. The drinkability is great. Very nice beer, but the sour distracts a bit."
"Reminds me of my first attempt at a homebrew: a caramel porter. Overly sweet that comes across as sour. Pours a very dark brown, but I could hardly get any head to from in the glass. Spots of lace around the glass. Smell is really sweet and makes me think of a Belgian, except for the roasted malt aroma. Odd sugars are present in the nose. Flavor is really sweet. Like sweetened chocolate, but just the sweet and no chocolate. Very sour caramel and toffee notes as well. Mouthfeel is deceptive. Medium body, but very thin. Not too sure I am gonna be able to finish the rest of the bottle."
"drinkable and worth a shot but i wouldn't seek it out."
"This beer poured into a snifter a deep black with virtually no highlights. It was topped by a thick tan head, very clumpy that clung to the side of the glass in chunks. The aroma has black cherry and licorice backed by a hint of chocolate and coffee. It has a little spice aroma in the finish. The taste has a nice citrus bitterness up front backed by black cherry and a little mocha. The mouth feel is full with a nice sharpness left by the hops. Nice drinakbility. I was expecting more heavy coffee and chocolate flavors, so I found the berry hints nicely refreshing"
"thanks goes to sulldaddy for this.I open this and it sat for 11/2 to 2 hours before I poured it into my glass. poured dark dark brown with a brown head. aromabitter sweet chocolate, toffee, roasted malts, dark fruits like plums hints of black cherries some alcohol all the thinks I like in a dark beer. flavorthe cherries came out 1st. than the roasted malts, and chocolate, dry mouth feel. not to bad"
"D - Three of the four people in the tasting group poured out their share."
"I certainly do find this beer interesting, but I think I would have perhaps preferred it if it was just straight Imperial Stout, as apposed to slightly infected Imperial Stout. Thanks to PisskyNights for the opportunity to try this interesting brew."
"While not as thick as its Irish cousins, this is a flavorful brew. I suggest avoiding the smell and enjoy."
"Drinkability is average. Very creative for sure but low mars for overall appeal."
"I've heard this place makes good beer. I've just yet to witness it. Seems like a pipe dream to me after 4 samples that were either way overcarbonated and off or just plain ass sour. Do they have quality control over there???"
"An acidic, dark malt greets you in the nose; followed by some sweeter notes of rich chocolate and a hint of burnt coffee as well as some spruce-like hoppiness. It's restrained, exceptionally fine-bubbled carbonation and light-medium body leaves it silky smooth across the palate. The flavor is bold without being overdone. Dark malt acidity greets you upfront (it's definitely not acetic or lactic, but it is somewhat tart), followed by some mild notes of bittersweet chocolate, and then some sweeter notes of creamy caramel. Restrained, but distinctly spruce-like hops appear immediately at the swallow; and help to usher in its dry and lingering earthy finish. It's quite enjoyable once it warms a bit and lends more breadth to its character. Certainly worth trying."
"This came in a nice big 750ml bottle. Pours out black with a tall tan head. There were decent rings of lace left around the glass as it is consumed. Aroma smelled of licorice, fruit a bit of chocolate and an odd soy sauce type note. Taste was of chocolate, coffee, a bitter earthiness and a bit of sourness. Very complex and interesting taste but the sourness and another odd flavor kept me from enjoying this as much as I could have. Mouthfeel was a bit thin but not too bad. Drinkability was pretty good even though there was some off flavor lingering in the background. I will probably give this another chance if I come across it again but this time it just seemed off."
"Overall, the quality factors were not worth the premium price that I paid for the bottle. I'll wait a year and try again because I think the brewers can greatly improve this recipe."
" A very good stout from a fine little brewery but like most of the products Ive had from Cisco, the bottles dont age well, and are usually over carbonated. Drink em soon after you buy em, except maybe the Baggywrinkle."
" Special thanks to VENOM for this brew. This was the last of a deliteful Cisco sampler, and I enjoyed every one of 'em."
"Definitely a foamer. Luckily, I was quick enough to get it to the sink before it spewed everywhere, but that's because I caught it before the lid was fully off. Huge tan head eventually fades completely away. The black body has a bit of a gray cast to it. A bit of the imperial stout fruitiness on the nose over a little chocolate. The flavor and body are thin. Some chocolate, some lingering hop bitterness. Definitely not one of the fuller flavored stouts of this size."
"Thanks to UncleJimbo for this bottle!"
"On the pour, a tall dark and handsome beer this one, the head a majestic chocolate crown that is creamy in consistency with the lace a thick and sticky blanket upon the glass. Toasted grains dominate the coffee and chocolate like nose, that is also fresh, crisp and somewhat sweet nose, a real treat to sniff, start is thick malt, sweet and the top full bodied and in feel. Finish is delectable in its hop spicy bite, the carbonation moderate, bittersweet chocolate dry and a fine drinking stout that is a true treat, just a shame they donÂ’t export this far west, good thing I have some good ole BA buddies in the east to thank for this one."
"Prost"
"I wish I had re-tried this earlier. Good, solid stout!"
"A mild, but incessant gusher... Beneath the tremendously thick, excessive carbonation induced, dark beige, sticky head lies a virtually black brew with flashes of clear deep garnet when held to light. With patience, the head settles into a manageable, blanket of loose foam fluff. Sweet, milky chocolate malt and caramel combination upfront in aroma, supported by a buttery diacetyl undertone. Mellow suggestion of mocha dipped pear adds a stately fruity contrast. Understated, but well rounded aromawise. Sharp, lightly tart carbonic acid bite hits the palate at first, then yields to a balanced combination of burnt barley bitterness and deeply toffeeish dark lovibond caramel malt. Roasted grain presence tapers mid palate, allowing moderate hop bitterness and chocolate malt to surface concomintantly, lending a dryish, only lightly sugared baker's chocolate presence. Faint, token prune like esters emerge late along with a mild, but perceptibly nut driven impression of spicy nutmeg and dry roasted almond. Persistently prickly in mouthfeel, from both the high attenuation and over carbonation. As the CO2 dissipates, the overall body is revealed to be thinnish, with its passable viscosity somewhat akin to that of an American brown ale. Finishes mostly dry, yet pleasantly sweet, with notes of molasses drizzled graham crackers and butter. Captain Swain is a flavorful stout unfortunately marred by overcarbonation. The superfluous attenuation suggests they prematurely bottled... This is more spritzy than a Duvel! Drinkability is only decent simply due to the inherent patience required for dealing with its excessive carbonation. Almost an excellent stout, but their yeast strain apparently behaved unpredictably. Tasty nonetheless and without outright flavor flaws."
"Drinkability: I could drink this again. The phenolic taste and high carbonation seem to be an across-the-board problem with Cisco, but I think they could have some damn good brews if they managed to fix a few lingering problems. Still, this is an extremely tasty foreign/export-style stout."
"Lost 1/3 my big bottle to the overflow... d'oh! Pour really really dark with a solid head. Quite bitter. A bit of sweet. Other than a slight burnt coffee flavor in the back ground, this come across as a quite nice beer. Very complex. Ends dry. Not the best stout, but worth a sample."
"Part of a 4-bottle sampler pack from Cisco that included a cd of some truly lame white-boy island groove music. You can almost picture the guys practicing all summer in their parents' vacation beach house with their faded college baseball caps on backwards. Ah, Nantucket! But I digress; on to the beer. Pitch black with lively head that recedes, almost completely. A couple big floating chunks of... yeast, perhaps? Exceptionally fruity aroma for a stout with some burnt brown sugar. Bittersweet chocolate, coffee, caramel, and huge roasty malts start things off, with that fruity yeast providing an eloquent twist, letting you know this is no ordinary stout. Incorporates sweeter elements of an oatmeal stout with the figgy, raisiny elements of an imperial stout or robust porter. Finishes with an excellent balance of dryness (from the hops) and sweet fruitiness that is pretty wet, almost cloying, tempting you to go back for more. This is a pretty remarkable stout. It requires your undivided attention; sit back and appreciate the achievement of balancing the roastiness of the dark malts with the exciting fruitiness of the yeast."
"Black enough to leave fingerprints on coal, this brew doesn't allow the slightest hints of light around its edges with a good brown head that sinks but leaves a nice lace.  Huge chocolate aromas along with some nice roasted coffee in the background.  Taste starts off extremely chocolatey with some subtle dark roasted coffee flavors tagging along all the way through.  The brew finishes with a lingering bitter coffee taste that is a perfect ending.  The brew is very creamy but not quite as chewy as I would like and a little too carbonated.  This brew reamains very drinkable and is yet another big time winner from Cisco Brewers."
"A first taste I though this might be a beer to have just one and go to something else, by the end of the glass I wanted to drink it all night."
"Notes: It's not very accessible at the time of this review, comes in big bottles and is $7 a pop. That said, you'd probably be spending your money well as this is a very decent stout with some rare characteristics for the market -- big time smoke flavours. Complex, unique and robust. I very much enjoyed this brew."
