"Da un Beso ala Botella is another fantastic stout from Cigar City. I would have appreciated a little more body but this is still far and away the best export stout that I've ever had the pleasure of consuming."

"EBF sample. Pours black or something close. Thick and viscous. Aroma is rich and very sweet. I detected barrel aromatics and was impressed to find that this was in a rum barrel. Rum barrels are bei used more and more and they definitely give off some pretty interesting and less coercive flavors and aromas than bourbon barrels in my opinion. It's not necessarily better but it's different. The nose is sweet chocolate, fudge, spicy wood and dark fruits. The flavor is quick sweet and decadent. Sweet chocolate syrup, rum and wood. Flat cola and some dark fruit. Finishes with spicy rum flavor. Full, slick texture. Quite good; would have liked more of this to better diagnose all the flavors."
"tried this at the extreme beer fest.  could of been the other 49 beers I sampled but I did not care for this one"

"Big molasses and woody rum notes on the nose. Hints of treacle and cacao as well as bits of ethanol and dark fruit. Chocolate caramel and molasses with a hint of burnt sugar bitterness. Light oak with a sweet sugary rum note and a touch of ethanol. Creamy oily sticky mouthfeel, thick body with a light level of carbonation. Big sweet and a hint boozy, but makes a really nice sipper on this frigid night."

"Overall - I don't dig the rum.  The middle retains some very nice stout flavors, but the rum really doesn't contribute well."

"You better like rum if you’re going to put this near your mouth, because the beer is leading with its sugarcane shoulder pads. I like rum. If you like rum, drink this beer, because your palate will thank you. Excellent brew."
"OVERALL: Really good. Although this is described as an export stout, it’s actually a better Cigar City imperial stout than El Cid. The look is not quite as thick as The Marshal or Huna, but it’s blacker and nastier than the vast majority of the imperial stouts out there, while the aroma and flavor is certainly top notch. A slightly thicker feel would put this over the top. Really enjoyed this and would love to see it again. Cheers 7clutch!"

"Thinner than expected (given CCB's stouts are always super thick) but it's still a thick beer. Smell and taste are of sweet chocolate and rummy oak. Great dessert beer! Would enjoy to try one with a good amount of age."

"Tropical notes were fantastic. The barrel note was decent and added to the experience, but I'm curious to see what it will be like in time. I'm curious to see if the rum will step back a small bit and if the tropical notes can hold on a take more of the leading role."

"Bottle from my membership. Have no idea what to expect here. CCB seems big on the rum barrels for Catador. Poured to my El Catador Club Teku (naturally). Pitch black pour with an espresso brown head, looking creamy as can be and the retention is solid. Aroma of chocolate covered licorice, molasses, light booze, hint of vanilla. Not a lot of rum here on the nose but very nice. Very unique and super creamy smell here. The flavor is huge chocolate sauce, lots of anise, dark fruits, definite rum spice here but not a lot of booze, some vanilla notes, and a strong roasted malt presence that makes it seem like there is espresso in this thing. Rich silky mouthfeel, lowish carbonation, but not the intensely thick level that often comes from CCB. In this case that's probably a good thing, as this is so sweet and rich as it is. Easily the best rum infusion I've had in a stout. Really nice, but gonna be tough to get through this on my own due to the dessert in a glass qualities."
