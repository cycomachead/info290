Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose was really rich - molasses, anise, light charcoal, vanilla. Mouthfeel was surprisingly only medium. The taste was semi-sweet with flavors including dried dark fruits, dark chocolate and a little bit of smokiness. The finish was dry and smoky and we decided to go in a different direction for our next beer.","woodychandler","Jul 13, 2014"

Some molasses, some smoke and a little licorice come through. The taste was similar with what started as a slight metallic aftertaste that faded as it warmed and gave some hints of anise, sage and rosemary at the back of the tongue. The chocolate smokiness and molasses also grew as it warmed. I enjoyed it more and more as it warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth, medium bodied. I always like a stout with a little more body than this one but it worked well. All in all, I really enjoyed this and would encourage anyone drinking it on tap to give it sometime.","jwchestnut","Mar 05, 2014"

4.12,4.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a proper stout black with a medium sized roasted tan head on top that quickly fizzles into a tight scrim that causes very thin droopy lacing. The body is impenetrable to the eye, sitting entirely opaque in the glass, but seems clear of sediment and haze. On the nose, the beer smells terrifically bizarre for the style. The slight roasted coffee and dark chocolate are there, but they play second fiddle to the beer’s dark fruit, quad-like smells of plums and raisin, and even a slight kiss of spicy alcohol. The beer tastes just as terrific, with light dark fruit notes on the beginning and aftertaste, but a strong roasted coffee stout flavor coming through in the middle. The beer begins with slight sour plum and raisin before opening into creamy roasted coffee and light dark chocolate notes, while sweet raisin and slight alcohol linger behind the roast and again show themselves strongly in the lingering aftertaste alongside the roasted coffee. The beer feels medium to medium heavy on the mouth, with a drying feeling in the face and sticky dry crackling on the tongue. Overall this is a terrific export stout with a Belgian yeast flair. I love the quad-like characters in the beer as they add a nice unique twist. This beer is a must try for stout fans, and another success from Pretty Things, as well as a go-to stout for me.","Maxwell","Dec 16, 2012"

The flavors here are nice, but light, and the watery mouthfeel doesn’t help. The fact that the beer’s latter notes are almost exclusively ash seems to point to a general dearth of sugars (thus the low ABV), and so while the initial flavors are good, they lack staying power.","jondeelee","Oct 24, 2012"

Pours a solid dark brown with faint garnet highlights when held to light and a fluffy tan meringue head that sticks lots of lace on the way down. Smells of roast and lots of caramel dark sugars and dark fruits. Spicy earthy aromas remind me of wood and ginger. The flavor is kind of a cross between a stout and a Belgian strong dark ale. The roasty caramel and chocolate flavors meet some spicy and earthy flavor reminiscent of some dark Belgians. Nice sugary fruity flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel.

The 7% ABV and variety of malts kept this stout drinking sturdy and the traditional hop additions kept it distinctly American.

The aroma is nice, it smells like chocolate, roasted malt, smoke, and some dark fruit and coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, molasses, smoke, wood, and a bit of licorice. Nice mix between the sweet and bitter flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and very smooth with moderate carbonation. I like this brew, too bad I can't get it here in Ohio. I'll probably buy this again the next time I come across it. $7.99 a bomber.","bluejacket74","May 12, 2012"

Mild aroma of toasted and dark malt with an interesting faint estery fruit component. Unusual flavor dominated by dark malt, but complex, earthy with unidentifiable fruit flavors. Finish is a touch sour, reminiscent of rye (which is listed as an ingredient) mixed with spicy toasted malt and coffee. Unusual combination of flavors, but this one works for me. Medium bodied with a touch of creaminess. These guys push the envelope but seem to pull it off. I would get this again if it was available in my state.","LiquidAmber","May 05, 2012"

3.73,-5.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed on 1/10/2010. Bottle. Pours black with a thick chocolate colored head. Aroma of roasted malt, a slight smoke presence. Flavor of smoke, earthy hops, roasted malt, bitter chocolate. An interesting stout with a distinct woodsy/oaky/earthy presence and of course, nice smokey notes. Very tasty and super drinkable.","LilBeerDoctor","Dec 23, 2010"

Babayaga has a medium yet thick head. My only criticism is that Babayaga's hut moves around on three hen's legs, not four but this is a beer, not a fairy tale, although after finishing this fine stout you'll feel as if you've been transported in time!","scriabin","Dec 19, 2010"
4.09,3.8,4.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Babayaga pours black, no hint of light even when directly backlit, yet it doesn't feel as dark as many larger stouts would pour. What was admittedly an overly harsh pour yields a mountain of rocky caramel colored foam, easily more than four fingers worth. The nose is fairly muted, but I can discern some chocolate and a little bit of rosemary. The flavor is much better, with a big blast of milk chocolate followed by a brief flourish of coffee kicking things off. The back end is an excellent blend of rosemary and a bit of smokiness. This is the first beer that I can really say just tastes like winter. The carbonation is pitch perfect, on the low end of the spectrum but still very lively. The beer's a little dry though for my taste, and I wish there was just a bit more heft behind it. This beer is another great offering from Pretty Things, one of my all time favorite winter brews. I only wish I had a fireplace, because I can't imagine a much better way to spend a frigid night like this than sitting in front of a roaring fire and sipping on some Babayaga","axeman9182","Dec 13, 2010"

The flavor mirrors the aroma pretty nicely, lots of barley and malt flavors with kind of a dirty finish. The best adjective I can think of for this one is rustic.

Charred roast malt, chocolate and slightly nutty. Overall very rich and varied aroma. Flavor and body sort of reminds me of an oatmeal stout, but flavors are richer and, I don't know, the word rustic is coming to mind, but I just might have the artwork stuck in my head. There is a strong charred, roasted malt body supporting a blend of earthy, dark chocolate, toasted malt, dark fruits, and smokiness. Body is medium full but seems over carbonated and overly fluffy on the palate. The finish is astringent and slightly off, with a potent charred, earthy medicinal flavor. Very robust and rich throughout, with a surprising amount of alcohol warming and burn for such a low ABV. Lots of interesting flavors, but overall I don't really enjoy the combination or the way they complement (or dont) each other.

If an aroma can smell silky this does. The aroma is not strong but sure is smooth. The taste is quite mellow, with bitter and milk chocolate, and roasted malt. The feel of this brew is outrageous. It has an obvious full body but feels light and fluffy; soft carbonation leads to a very smooth and silky feel, much like a frothy head to a milk shake. Finishes with a light roasted malt bitterness. A very silky stout indeed. Not huge on flavor but that is fine as it has a solid roasted malt flavor.","Gmann","Dec 25, 2009"

4.31,9.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pour produces an amazing 3 fingers of frothy brown head. Milkshake like. Color of the body is a very dark brown, almost black. Aroma contains notes of roasted barley, chocolate malt, mild black cherry tones. This beer just appears and smells hearty and wholesome. Taste contains flavors up front of roasted malt grain that mellows out. When this happens, more chocolate malt can be tasted. Fruity notes pick up at the center. Black cherry, some citris from what is the beginning of a nice hop bitterness to this beer. Finish keeps the hop flavors and comes in with a bit of a tobacco hint. Aftertaste leaves the roasted, charry flavor from the grains and bittering hops dancing on the palate. At 7%, this beer is very drinkable and delicious.","jdaelhousen","Dec 23, 2009"
4.35,10.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The taste will not disappoint. The beer gets high marks for overall creaminess, and slight oily quality on the tongue. It has a full palate of dark malts, a touch of dark chocolate, and coffee flavors. There is just a touch of sweeter malts and a little bit of prickliness at the very beginning, but this segues out into more bittering flavors. The beer has a strong roasted quality, and is loaded with dark unsweetened malts. There is less chocolate flavors than I would have liked. The coffee is slight as well, which is okay by me. It is the charred, dark malts and roasted flavors, and slight bittering dryness in the finish that defines this beer. It is a substantial, full palated affair.","albern","Dec 20, 2009"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bomber, with a cutsie paper tab over the cap, that lets me know it was ""Bottled November 2009"" Nice, fresh and tasty beer. Always interested in giving a new brew from hyper artisinal Pretty Things a try. Pours pretty darn near black, the head also is a quite dark shade of mocha. Head is of moderate height, and shows much better then average staying power, then turns to a thick film and collar and leaves slippery and sliding sheeting and ample ridges and ripples of lacing. The sniff emits healthy notes of vanilla, dark malt, raisins, and chocolate. Rich and flavorfull stout, more of the same flavors on the tongue and mouth. Smooth and comfortable mouthfeel. More then typical roastyness. After trying several of the other eclectic PT brews, I was unsure of what to expect from a ""Sylvan Stout"" (whatever that is) from them. What I got was a pretty straight ahead, hearty/robust/flavorful and underneath it all, tasty and enjoyable stout. Nice job and well worth giving this one a try.","Billolick","Dec 13, 2009"
4.45,12.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and biting with a big bite of carbonation, keeping it from being too overbearing and making it nicely drinkable.","paco1029384756","Dec 05, 2009"

4.21,6.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"If I may, an edit to this review as I had the new batch on draft tonight 10/19/10. It is nothing like I remember before, with sour, tart cherries in the mouth right away. [I don't want to say infection, right away, though it very well could be.] Then it becomes extremely sweet, like a milk stout, with subtle tobacco, leather, molasses, and light cherry wood smoke notes followed by a bitter hop taste. It looks good, but not all that drinkable. The numbers I give it here are A--4.5, S--4, T--3, M--4, D--3.","ManVersusBeer","Dec 04, 2009"

4.28,8.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This seasonal offering is absolutely delicious and superbly flavorful. I would say that a couple glasses of this may be filling, but, it would work perfectly as a digestif and will definitely keep you warm on a cold winter's night.","deapokid","Nov 29, 2009"
3.78,-4.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I have had this beer twice since it was just released in bombers, and I have had mixed feelings on it. Lets see how it is out of the bottle. Appearance is quite dark, with some rocky tan heading that is slow to settle. It has the aroma of an export stout, with some burnt coffee bean, bitter in places, and a hint of smoke. One gets a good dose of bitter coffee, smoke, and slight chocolate from the taste. Mouthfeel is relatively heavy, making it a sipper for me. Alcohol is well hidden within all that smoke. Not half bad...I do not really get the Belgian aspect of this beer, but it certainly passes for me as an export or robust stout. On the lower end of the totem pole as far as Pretty Things beers go, but worth a try no doubt. Cheers","jamie2dope","Nov 25, 2009"
3.33,-15.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"D: It is a nice beer to try, especially if you are in the mood for something a little different. It is a bit more of a winter warmer in my opinion and worth trying once, but this is not my favorite from Pretty things","mikey711","Nov 24, 2009"
4.5,14.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"F: It finishes semi bitter and a nice slight hoppy flavor. The rich creamy chocolate also sticks around, giving you memories of being a kid and drinking the chocolate milk from the carton. Most of the roasted malt and coffee flavors have subsided by the finish. The bitter earthy charred stout-like flavors present themselves quite a bit at the end, probably accentuated by the bittering hops. Although, except for the coat of chocolate and caramel that coats the mouth and tongue, it finishes pretty clean.","jlindros","Nov 24, 2009"
