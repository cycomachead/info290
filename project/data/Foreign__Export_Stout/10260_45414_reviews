"Starts out with a couple centimeters of light khaki bubbles on top of deep brown beer that doesn't let much light through but does turn just a bit red at the edges. The smell is mostly sweet with a lot of dark fruit, plums and the like. Very little in the way of malt or typical stout like bitter chocolate in the nose. The taste is very smooth dark malts with only a hint of the bitterness that you would expect. The fruitiness comes through as well but the taste is much more dynamic than the smell with a lot of the more Belgian flavors of earthy, yeasty, vinous flavors in there as well, overall strange for a stout and more like a Belgian dark. Rather full bodied but quite smooth with low levels of carbonation and a finish that is only slightly dry with a touch of bitterness. An unusual take on the style that has enough in the way of interesting characteristics to make it worth trying but doesn't make it a great beer."
"OVERALL- not bad, but a little dull, vaguely reminiscent of a St Fuellien yeast character"

"Overall not bad, a nice export style stout with the dark malts, roasty, black malts, hints of cocoa and caramel, a little burnt notes, candi sweetness that still stays really dry, maybe a bit too much on the burnt like notes but not too bad, a bit too much carbonation too surprising for what it's gone through."

"The body was a bit thinner than I would have liked, and the brew wasn't sticky. The beer had a finish that was mostly dry, but did have a a touch of sweetness. Drinkability was very good, the beer went down quickly and easily, and I could have a couple in a sitting. Overall, a pretty nice brew, worth trying if you see it."
"A very tasty beer. I’m sad that I only have one measly Euro bottle of it. This is something to splurge on once in a while."

"Drinkability is decent, loads of flavor, but sharp elbows here."

"O - Overall, glad to try it at the festival as it is something I see on the shelf quite often."

"O: smooth and understated, a nice change."
"This dark mahogany beer has a durable tan head and leaves very good lacing. The near creamy texture overlays an unusual palate that seems both full and light, and has a pleasant, semi-dry finish. Although it is slightly light in color for a stout and has an unusual (yeasty, boozy and hoppy) aroma, in tasting this is indeed a Belgian stout: it has the flavor of a rather spicy and hoppy export stout with the added complexity imparted by Belgian yeast and in-bottle refermentation. The dark roasted malts do come to the fore for a moment now and again in the finish, then linger in the durable aftertaste."
"O - Not a huge fan of the style and this is no exception. Not painful to consume, although I'll look the other way next time I spot one."

"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a dark ruddy brown, appearing nearly black in the glass. Healthy three finger brown head with good retention and massive lacing. Looks nice. Aroma of dark fruit with a lot of plum, toasted malt, chocolate and a slight mineral element. Flavor of dark and dried fruit, chocolate, coffee and slight hops on the finish. A Belgian influence to the yeast and fruit. Complex with interesting flavor progression. Nice medium body with excellent creaminess and active carbonation. Appropriately somewhat dry and slightly sour as expected from an export stout. I lean towards the Russian and American style of stout, but I really enjoyed this, one of the nicer export stouts I've had."

"The was decent enough I guess and while there was an assortment of flavors here, the strength of the spice just kind of overran everything else at times, giving the profiles a bit of a flat feel. This wasn’t offensive or anything but I doubt that I’ll be trying it again either."
"O) I like Belgian stouts. I like this beer."
""
"I'll confess this one was late in a tasting night so perhaps I'll need to revisit it at some point to refine the review."
"Overall – Very good-tasting and interesting brew! Very much worth a sampling!"
"O: Overall, I'm quite dissapointed; way too thin for may taste. It feels like it lacks large quantities of malt..."

"A thin and uninteresting black beer. Not impressed."
"A really nice and smooth stout, not very dry and not very hop dominated."
"Very drinkable for its size, the warmth from the alcohol does not really set in until half the glass is gone. Very well balanced, a treat to drink."
"1364"
"Served ontap into a small chalice. Black with ruby highlights, small head that dies quickly. Aroma is light, just a little roast and belgian yeast. The flavor is light, small roasted malt and a sour twang too. Belgian yeast plays a role , adding a subtle fruityness that works well with the mild sour note. More roasted malt on the back end but somewhat thin, as is the body. Smooth and easy drinking, an interesting brew that I am glad I got to try."
"In a word: lackluster."
"Overall, a dark, charred malt beer that is like a belgian quadruple, but much darker and ashen. Can make a good night-capper."
"Aroma has a strong smoky tone with coffee and molasses components and hints of caramel and nuts. It pours a deep sable with a respectable, if not thick, light tan head. Flavor is smoky and has unsweet chocolate, roast coffee and molasses tones with a hint of caramel. Texture is fairly smooth, not as thick as most stouts, and just a little tingly."
"Not normally a fan of Belgian yeast strains in stouts, this is somewhat in agreement for me. The banana just doesn't work with the flavor/aroma profiles to me. Still not bad though."
"Labeled BLACK not Noire-probably for the US. Nice, jet black color with a sizeable tan/cocoa like head. Nice lacing on down the glass. Somewhat metallic, earthy aroma. Yeasty and sharp flavor right upfront. Some hop bite. Faint roasted quality. Mild cocoa notes as it warms. Earthy and bready-more Belgian than stout like if anything. Too thin for my liking. An ok example of a Belgian stout but I have had better for sure."
"Lot #01! Best before end of 2011! Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured pitch black with a two finger beige head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, slight roasted malt, hints of caramel, and slight nuttiness. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, cream, and a slight roastiness. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew wasn't that bad, but it also wasn't that great. Neither the aroma nor flavor were very robust in this one which was quite disappointing. The elements that were there were quite nice, but it just lacked in intensity. Glad I got to try this one, but once is enough for me unless they can work on the robust aspect."
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. Jet black pour with a fizzy little white head. The aroma is sweet, malts and candy sugar. It starts with sweet chocolate, candi sugar, and plums. It has a lingering sweet finish. The body is medium and it is well carbonated. IMO a BSDA, decent, maybe too sweet."
"d: desceptive in it's smoothness, nothing says that it is at 7.6% ABV. it drinks more like a 4% dry stout. it's not bad, but I don't know if I'd buy it again."
"a very drinkable export of the Belgian vein. nice look of billowing head that has a good quality of lace. mild sediment cloud with a dark brown black color. nose of roasty malt and Belgian yeast. palate has zesty citrus beginning with a bit of plum and the savory mineral oyster. the finish comes out with lemongrassy. not particularly bitter finish yet stick so smokey qualities."
"Mammoth head, even a slow and steady pour fills two-thirds of the glass with tan airy microfoam, craters in the middle as it starts to slowly evaporate, the lacing is more like thin sheets and in turn stick well. Completely black liquid, thin sliver of orange at the bottom of the glass. Direct nose, almost tame, of dark chocolate, freshly ground coffee, malted milk balls, grape, cherry and plum fruit scents, has some hoppy kick but no distinguished individual scents. Medium-bodied, starts out creamy but dries up as it progresses, losing its softer texture. Carob, chocolate, coffee, butterscotch and a decent nuttiness set the table. Fresh grain brown bread, the kind of eat in chunks rather than slices. Slides you a slice or two of orange citrus. The carbonation has a tighter weave and more punch than expected given the delicacy of the head. Not much hops presence. It's credible but nothing special."
"Taste starts with creamy chocolate malt, a peek of dark fruit in the middle, and a clean, lightly bitter close. Mouthfeel is so smooth, but not as much depth of body as I hoped/expected. Drinkability is good. Nice brew, just not quite all I was hoping for."
"D: In spite of its flaws, this is still a drinkable beer."
"Well, to be sure I had two bottles o this. I completely drank both, with some otehr beverages including lemon water inbetween. What I got was an interesting stout. Black with a white foam head leaving some lace on the aides, at tehe dnd of the drinking were lots of lace bits. The first bottle more than the second I detected some sourness, served just below room temperatre each time at Beer Bistro. Some sweetness, yes, but th sourness dominated the first bottle and was more balanced but still there in the second bottle. A creaminess in th mouthfeel, a liuttle chocolate. drying.Not a swett tout as advertsied. the astringency is in the way."
"Nothing good or bad, just not worth drinking here."
" D- The very clean light flavor won't improve much with age and there was very little character to begin with."
"An exceptional beer. Can't wait to have another go at this one. Overall more stout-like than belgian like. Very little carbonation too, always a major plus in my book."
"D - for the style, very drinkable. goes down extremely easy"
"Mmmmm, very tasty! Poured with a large, foamy, frothy, textured light tan head and lots of good lace. Aroma is malty, yeasty, and spicey with a bit of cocoa and licorice. Flavor is great with the aroma qualities and a nice play between bitter, dry, and sweet, some roastiness. Body is very smooth and rounded and appropriate carbonation. Finish is like flavor and is super easy drinking. Guy could be greedy with this stuff."
"D-Very drinkable. Hides its 7.6%abv very well. Could use more stout like qualities. More bitterness from either the roasted grains or hops. Either way not bad."
"O: hot for 7.6%, very smooth, good nice dark complexity, light funk, probably alc influenced, the funkiness is strange but not objectionable"
"Drinkability: Totally unexpected taste profile but a distinctive and enjoyable beer for sure"
"(Bottle into pint glass) Very surprising for a stout!! Poured like most stouts with a strong black color and finger and a half foamy light brown head. The nose was reminiscent of many other Belgians, with the sweetness prevailing. The malts were well toasted and there were hints of both molasses and chocolate present. Taking a taste had these same flavors come through along with a light hint of coffee that provided a very pleasant aftertaste. A great find!"
"Glad I tried this from Tourney, a good shot for a stout but misses the mark a bit. This is good tasting beer that perhaps could get tweaked in the future. The 7.5% shows itself minimally in feel and just a bit in taste, but I like it, adds to what's going on, which in this case is light for the style. In the end I kind of got this BSDA kind of thing mixed with a light stout."
"Tournay ""Black"" label, purchased in US. 11.2 oz btl poured into a tulip. This pours completely opaque black with 2"" of bone white head with staying power, but very little lacing left on the glass. Nose of raisins, malt, citrus/grapefruit hop character. Initial flavor of warm brown sugar, yeasty baked goods with citrusy hop resins mid palate. Finish of smoke, roasted malt and charred oak. The mouthfeel is medium. It feels like it could be thicker without becoming sticky. Drinkability is only average. I rated the taste highly for its multifaceted character, but the grapefruit flavor is a little off-putting."
"Rather interesting. I've little experience with belgian stouts, but this is quite subtle and seems an easy segue into the style from the American and British stouts I'm more used to. A distinct estery belgian spice is surprisingly hidden and well integrated. Pretty subtle and easy overall, a stronger malt profile with some amped-up roasty notes would add another layer of complexity from which this beer would doubtlessly benefit. I'm certainly glad I tried it, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy another bottle but I'd drink it again without hesitation, if offered."
"Very deep maroon color with a medium tan head with nice lacing. Aroma of cocoa and malt. Taste of dark chocolate and licorice, mostly sweet but with a very slight bitter edge and a longish finish with noted of cafe au lait. Medium body. Nice enough, drinkable but not very complex."
"Light body, alcohol well hidden."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small light tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, light fruits, and yeast. Flavor of sweet malt initially with a roasty finish, some more bitter chocolate notes. Definite Begian yeasty notes. Nothing too special, a little on the sweet side, but a chill Belgian stout."
"Pours very dark brown with a thick creme head. Nose is boring and almost comes off as non-existent. Flavor is hearty with a slight tang to it. Caramel tones. Brown sugars. Feel has a fairly full carbonation to it and the liquid is fairly thicker. Overall a nice one to drink. A fair example of a Belgian stout."
"Bottle: Poured a medium black color ale with a large off-white head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt with Belgian malt and some light DMS. Taste is also dominated by lightly sweet Belgian malt with some lightly roasted malt and some overcooked vegetables which is not strong enough to ruin this beer but not very pleasant either. Body is somewhat full with great carbonation and no alcohol is showing. Interesting take on the style but too flawed to try on a regular basis."
"From a 750 ml bottle, this brew pours a black color with dark brown-earth highlights. A three finger head is a light brownish color, roughly akin to chocolate milk. The taste is a little subtle, with chocolate, grain, smoke, and malt aromas. No real hop presence in the smell. The taste, though, has a malty sweetness in the front, balanced with a medium hop bitterness and considerable grain astringency and bitterness. It doesn't quite get husky, but the tannins, combined with the burnt/highly roasted malts, give the beer a nice backbone. This give the mouthfeel an interesting character as well. A touch of sourness is also present in the taste. Long bitter finish."
"Poured a dark black color with an averaged sized off white head. Lacing left on the glass. Aromas of roast, licorice, chocolate, and some fruitiness. Tastes of chcoolate, licorice, the same lighter fruitiness, and some coffee."
"D: Not bad. Nice rare gem that was a please to enjoy."
