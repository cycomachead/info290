"Overall, the beer is  a decent export stout and very good novelty gift for the Beer Geek in your life. Even if it isn't a gift, the beer is still overall pretty decent and drinkable. I'll definitely be keeping my eye out for this every holiday."
""
""
""
"Probably one of the worst beers I've ever had.  Thin and boozy, not much smell or flavor to this beer."
""
"Aroma of cocoa, molasses, roasted malt, hint of coffee, smoke, & vanilla. Taste roasted malt, chocolate, ash, faint spice, licorice. Nice!"
""

"Nice stout. Slightly sweet with no hops. Smooth finish that isn't too bitter."
"A roasty bitterness follows.  Light carbonation - a bit more than I want in a stout, but not over the top.  8% abv for this brew.  A decent option for a cold winter night."
"Overall better than I thought ti would be.  I had it figured for a holiday seasonal gimmick, but it's a pretty decent stout.  I would have it again."
"Something to try once, certainly if it's a gift."

""

"Overall, yeah, I dig this, and I dig it as a foreign/export stout. Merry Christmas, BA's!"
"Solid stout. Great taste and good feel."
""
""
"My wife summed this one up perfectly... 'it's a stout'. I'd be hard pressed to pay $6.99 for this again, but with that being said, there is nothing bad about this brew, just nothing great."

"Overall – Ah…  A decent brew, but really not that special and not what I would consider a dark roastad ”as black as the lump of coal you’ll be getting for Christmas” as proclaimed by the label."

"Tastes AMAZING. Super dark and chocolate..."

"Disappointing brew as I have saved this for two years before drinking. Not a true stout."

"Unimpressive....  Wish I would have read about it before buying.  It is not bad, just not at all a stout, and not worth the price (I paid $6.49 at a specialty beer store).  It tastes like an average home brew from a kit."
"500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/5/2012. Pours clear nearly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and moderate fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Foreign stout style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Best part of this beer was the label."

"Stout my ass.. Tastes like Old Ale, Baltic Porter, Quad, and Stout all mixed together. Way malty... yes is complex in the fact that there are a lot of different flavors...but not in a good way. IMO."
""
""
""
""
"I like the malt profile. The sherry character is likely attributable to age, but it neither adds nor detracts, really. I'm not digging the fake cherry, though. Misses a lot of body and malt for a stout."
""

"The body was thin, if you consider this a Stout, but right on for a Strong/Old ale. Smooth all across the tongue, with a semi dry finish. Overall, a very good brew, one that I will certainly grab again if I see it, and I think it's worth your time as well."

"On the nose, the beer smells of stale, dark breads, touches of milk chocolate, instant coffee, and bakers chocolate. Low amounts of diacetyl seem to be present as well with a light, buttered popcorn character. Touches of spicy licorice occasionally brush against the nostrils, but they are light. On the tongue, the beer tastes bready sweet, with a mild bitter roast, touches of coffee-like acidity, and the briefest of alcoholic pops just at the close. Hop bitterness builds as you sip the beer, and eventually hits slightly unbalanced levels. The finish is drier with a mild bitter roast. In flavor, the beer begins as softly chary coffee, moving into roast grains and toasted bread. The middle and finish carry lots of herbal and medicinal bitters that hurt other flavors in the beer. Touches of licorice, bakers chocolate, and caramel touch across the tongue, but are kept light due to the mildly aggressive bitter flavoring that mingles with slight char flavors. In the mouth, the beer feels on the heavier side of medium in body, with a middling, soft carbonation, and a slightly watery, smooth, and almost-creamy mouthfeel. The bitters give the mouth a slightly sharp feeling, which is off with the rest of the beer. Overall, this is an average Export Stout that suffers from a bad blending of its bitters with the other rich flavors of the beer. It is not overly bitter by any means, but just feels a touch too bitter for the style. For a “Dark Holiday Stout,” I was also expecting more rich malt character, but it was fairly mellow with it malt character. This beer is not horrible, but is rather forgettable in the grand scheme of things. I liked it more as I drank more of it. It hides its 8% nicely. I would advise serving this at room temperature."

"I just realized it: this resembles a Belgian strong dark ale more than any stout, in color, smell, carbonation, and even flavor. It's not terribly complex, but at least it appeals to my affinity for dark Belgian ales."
""
""
""
"Lump of coal pours a black color with a small white lacing head. There is a weak toffee aroma. The taste also is weak, lots of toffee, with a very dry aftertaste. Weak watery flavors. Overall its decent, weak and watery, but in no ways horrible, a bit borring."

"Pours a nearly black body that appears clear dark red under the light with a fingers worth of khaki foam. Looks good. Leaves behind some patches of foam and some nice lacing. Smell is awfully mundane. Sweet milk chocolate, faint vanilla, bitter roasted malts and not much else. Taste follows the nose with the addition of smoke smoke and a plasticy finish. Like a muted rauchbier with some artificial vanilla. Why is it so roasty? The saving grace here is the mouth feel which is full and creamy. Not a big fan of this one. The light smokey thing it has going on is less than welcome in my opinion."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of coffee. Taste is coffee, some chocolate, alcohol is well hidden. smooth and easy drinking. Feels a bit creamy in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
""

""

"Still, I am charmed by this beer, and of various holiday offerings I have tried, this ranks in the upper echelon. Nice beer for a cold Minnesota winter's night."
""
"Export stouts are my least preferred stout, so it's hard for me to find one that impresses me, and this is no exception. This brew is drinkable but perfectly forgettable in my estimation."
"Not bad, though it seems like more of a porter than a stout. The strength doesn't show either - it's an 8% brew that drinks like a 4%. Looks alright and the aroma is decent, but the flavour seems rather muted. Some more roasted malt notes/bitterness would be nice. Body is OK, if a little flat. I guess for the ABV I expected a more complex flavour profile and a longer finish. A reasonable Christmas beer that doesn't quite live up to expectations. Worth trying but no need to seek it out."

"O- An interesting novelty beer. Not sure what makes this a holiday brew other than the sweetness. An average sweet stout with an above average aroma and a funny story on the label."

"Overall: Pretty good for a smaller English Stout. Nice roasty flavors and balanced sweetness."
""

"Overall: The idea of a Christmas stout is interesting, but this brew doesn’t live up to expectations…it’s got the makings of a holiday ale or lager, but there is plenty left to be desired, like a thicker disposition…while it is warming my belly, I think most of that is from the higher ABV and not necessarily the cinnamon and clove…the spices are not crisp, leaving a slightly heavy, overdone taste in my mouth…I’ll finish this one, but don’t think I’ll be looking for another…there are better choices for a holiday brew…(2/5)"
""

"One that I might get again, though I won't seek it out."
""
""
"O: 4.0 this a very pleasant beer with a nice finish. I would recommend to friends and family. I could even see doing this beer as a session beer if it were on tap somewhere"
""
"This was a pretty disappointing beer. Everything was a bit watered down. None of the flavors were pronounced or forward. It also had a distinct cola-like flavor that I'm really not fond of in my beer. This is a beer I will pass up in the future."
""
""
"SOLID, NOT MUST TRY!"
""
"Smells of licorice, a splash of black coffee, and a light amount of char roast. Tastes of both milk and dark chocolate, with a lesser amount of licorice than the nose, and a hint of burnt fruitiness around the edges of the other flavors that amplifies as the glass warms up. My token criticism is that I would have liked for that fruitiness and roasted character to show up at a higher level / depth than what I received."
""
""
"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Caracole small snifter. Pours a dark brown, appearing black. Faint aroma of light malt and dark fruits. Flavors are typical English dry stout. Light toasted malt and a hint of burnt coffee, dark fruit. Flavor is fairly subdued. Light to medium bodied. Pleasant, but not a great stout. Still one of the better Ridgeways, which tend to be rather bland in flavor, IMHO."

"Overall, a one and done. You can't do 2 of these one after the other. Rich and sweet/bitter. Good complexity, but not a true stout. I liked this, but not enough to go after this as a must have. I like the complexity and the quality of the brew. My advice -- share this."
""
""
"O: It was OK, but I can't say I'd buy another. Just not a big flavor profile, no warming roast or complexity that I'd want from a midrange stout."
"O: Basically a good beer that is fairly one dimensional. Was enjoyable enough but as a holiday beer because of the sweet factor. The smell is definitely not inline with the rest of the beer."
"O: An average effort at a foreign/export stout. Doesn't hold 8% necessarily well, with an unbalanced flavor profile."
""
""
"This a a decent stout representative. Nicely balanced between scent, taste, and mouthfeel. Better than average and worth checking out...Subtle and worthy for the style..."
"Would not buy again. Would not recommend to anyone. Would still drink it if offered to me."
""

"nice different holiday dark brew. pours literally coal black, no transparency with a smallish white head, frothy. smells a little dark fruity with good rich roasted malts and a heavy sturdy yeast. flavor is low key but different, there is a pronounced fruity malty lightness if thats doable. mouthfeel is nice, less carbonated than it could be, with a full body and a pungent but complimentary to its flavor and aroma finishing kick. english for sure, the malts make this one. at 8% the value is great. very drinkable. i am an elf"

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark brown, with ruby highlights. Thin film covering, with a slightly heavier ring around the glass. Effervescent aromas of coffee and dark fruit, with roasty, toasty tones. The flavors are rich, with a dark chocolate highlight over the roasted coffee flavors. Lighter bodied for a stout, with no cling left behind. The aftertaste is more of the sweet notes with a coffee bitter to balance, and a fairly quick, slick finish. Decent, but not spectacular."
"Taste is fairly straightforward, roasted malt up front and is the primary flavor, a burnt bitterness follows in the aftertaste, soft carbonation adds a bit of creaminess even though it's interrupted by a semi-dry finish, strength is very well hidden though."
""
""
"DOA"
""
"This one was pretty tasty and drank easy for the 8 percent. Worth trying once."
"Maybe if you count the sweet malt and general grassy hops that are overdone. Blegh."
""
""
"I honestly didn't expect much from this beer. What a pleasant surprise. It's a deep, thick, dark, high viscosity brew. Jet black with a light tan head. The smell is intense...coffee, dark chocolate, and licorice. Dark fruits (cherry?), and a bit of smoke and charcoal. The taste is sweeter than anticipated...rich, luxurious, and balanced with a no-nonsense bitterness. Fruit, roast, and lots of grain in the flavor. The body is substantial: filling is an understatement. Mmmm...Christmas!"
"O-not bad but for the price there are a lot of better examples"
"Notes: A nice sweet stout"
"pours black as nite with reddish brown highlights. a half finger of tan head quickly and loudly, like fizz in soda, settled to a spotty froth on top. the nose is very weak for a stout. not getting any roast or chocolate or hops, just beer. taste is slightly bettter with a little chocolate flavor, but very weak and disappointing. mouthfeel is o.k. at first, goes down smooth, but then leaves a bad aspirin bitter flavor behind that lingers for ever. at seven dollars a pint and the muted flavors i would not recommend this to anyone."
""
""
"Big downside is price. I'd pay 10-12 bucks for a six pack of 12oz bottles but at $6.99 for a single bottle, I probably won't buy again just because of economics - but it was good and worth a try."
"It was an enjoyable beer.. but I'm not going to walk a quarter mile for it."
""
""
"From the bottle marked F13-245. Sampled on December 13, 2011. The pour is mainly dark brown with ruby red hues glistening around the edges when held to the light. The head is minimal. On the nose there are a variety of scents including sweet malts, cherry, and later spent coffee grinds. The body texture falls into the thin to medium range. The taste is a little more mellow with the same mixture of malts, cherry, and coffee grinds with the slightest hint of clean, crisp hops at the finish."

"Not much stout, it's okay, nothing about makes it me want to re-visit though."
""
""
"I had no idea that this beer vas that strong (8 %), I had guessed 5 % or so. A fine English stout that sadly was served way too cold."
"So if you have been naughty this year put this on your shopping list cause Santa already has a different lump of coal waiting for you."
"Glad I tried it always nice to have something different not sure if I would have again."
"O: Decent export stout – easily drinkable –just not enough body to make it excellent."
""
""
""
"O - not bad, I plan to cellar one and try it again in a year, there are others I prefer for this category"
""
""
"Overall: I was not really a impressed with this beer as I was expecting a nice stout with maybe some holiday flavors. Instead I got a really sweet beer with mostly odd flavors."
""
""
""
"Overall: Seems like bottled English beer doesn't always deliver, but I like this one pretty well."
""
"O: Not a bad brew to pick up and try. Not something I'd really remember or recommend to others as a standout in the stouts though."
"O: Not bad, but would not buy this again at the price. This beer would rock some socks off if it was more ingredient heavy. Mosdef not a consolation for being a bad boy, but not a punishment either; good thing I was good this year. I did like the charcoal notes, but they were very subtle."
"Overall it was decent. Interesting flavors and moderate drinkability."
"O- This one was much better than I expected."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with some off-white bubbles but not real head. The aroma is heavy on the chocolate and roasted malt with some anise notes mixed in. The flavor is almost identical. The chocolate and roasted malt are what really stands out, but the licorice/anise notes are in the flavor as well. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not great, but one of the better Ridgeway beers I have tried."
"It has a very smooth, civilized taste. It works very nicely not too cold. I probably would never buy it again since the single bottle was a bit pricey, even with a buck or two off."
"This stout poured out as a dark brown color. The beer is almost translucent despite the color. The head is thin and tan colored. Not much lacing. The smell is a bit roasted and has some earthy aromas too. The taste of the beer is light and creamy. The flavors don't really have a bitterness of coffee or dark burnt toast. It's one of the smoothest tasting stouts ive had in a while. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and not really complex at all. Overall it's an easy going stout."
"O - relatively boring. Would sooner pick many other brews before this one."
"Pretty subpar stout and flawed stout, all marketing, not much substance."
"A very easy drinking stout; the high ABV is very well hidden. Dark fruit sweetness is well matched with the smokey dark grain bitterness. Plenty of subtle interesting flavor."
"A good dallop of nuttiness and toffee out of this one. Easy drinking enough. Slight plum and raisin feel to it. Keeps the bitterness in check. Good price on it, under $4, might go back to this one once a year around the holidays, a little changeup for that time of year."
"O: This is just kind of meh."
" Palate is rich and malty up front, with notes of chocolate and some lactose sweetness. A mild dose of dark fruit (cherries?) and a little bit of cocoa powder come through on the swallow. Finish is sweet but mostly dry. Body is full and creamy, but not overly thick. Still, this is somehow not the most drinkable beer around, I guess because of the strength. A good bit of heat from the alcohol lingers on the finish."
"Cheers"
"D - A good effort for sure."
"Opinion: Well, this beer is going to make a lasting impression on me with just the one sip I have had so far. It is pretty rough to say the least. The aroma was OK, but man, once you get into the flavor...it is a ride for the palate and I am not saying that it is a pleasant one. I would steer clear of this one if I were you."
"not worth the 5 or 6 bucks i spent"
"And let's be honest, we've all been there."
"D- Reading other reviews the QC issue with the carbonation seems to be hit or miss. I wish I could enjoy this beer as it was meant to be and I'm sure it'd be great"
"Pretty good nice little stout I would have again."
"D- Not a very good example of the style."
"Lump of Coal tastes a lot like Guinness to me. I'd never guess it was an 8%."
"D: Any traces of alcohol are well hidden from the taste, which makes this beer quite easy to drink."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"Drink- Its different that I thought but pretty good. Again the wife tried. I give her credit."
"Roasted flavors come out again in the taste, backed by a slightly sweeter chocolate characteristic than what was found in the smell. A slight hint of vanilla is also there, as the beer finishes with tastes of dark fruit. The roasted qualities combine well with the chocolate and dark fruit to create a very interesting stout. Mouthfeel is smooth, and just about where I like it for a stout. Definitely a solid holiday offering from Ridgeway, as well as just a decent stout (which seems harder and harder to find). I'll be back for more next year."
"You'd never know the alcohol level was high. The sweet, creaminess begs you to keep on sipping."
"Meh - in the future, I'll leave this one in my stocking."
"D. Wouldn't buy it again. could have been a good stout, but its not export stout."
"Drinkability: A good, basic stout."
"Drinkability: A good effort and a tasty brew. I don't think you would want to drink more than two a night."
"-Bye"
"A slightly above average beer in my opinion, but at $9 I won't be having any more anytime soon."
"Overall this is a well made, drinkable stout, but it is largely forgetable, espeically for the ABV and inflated imported price tag."
"Its quite filling so the drink ability is a little low. I might be able to have another one of these."
"D: Glad I gave it a shot but wont be back to it"
"The taste of this brew is just about like any other stout from England, with a burning ethyl finish. It is light semisweet chocolate and butter mixed together, a cola like middle, and an herbal and leathery finish. Feels a little thin for the lower ABV, but again the ethyl kick in the end is a little much."
"Meets the stout visual 'standards': black hue, two finger tan head. Roast-like aroma's burst out of the bottle upon its opening. Smells like an amber ale. What? Thin body, malty but not roasty. Noticeable carbonation. Definitely leaning towards darker flavors. Sweet, bitter milk chocolate. Roasted after taste. The body to this beer definitely effects the presentation of this beer's taste. I can't help but noticing that taste a lot like cola with roasted malt. It's refreshing to have a beer that isn't trying to knock you off your seat, but that doesn't save this beer. If I were to have this on cask I think I might like this a little more. It just tasted watered down."
"Unlikely to get this again."
"Taste is pleasant and it fits the bill as an export stout...upon first tasting. Right in the middle of an imperial and a regular stout, there is plenty of chocolaty sweetness with a fair amount of roast and alcohol. Mild fruit contributes more of a complexity aspect than a straight up fruit flavor. Carbonation level is a bit high and the mouthfeel is a touch thin, but I am liking this slightly aged version better than the fresh one I had a year and a half ago. Mouthfeel is a bit 'wet' and lingers on far too long in a licorice type of profile. Some sourness comes out upon warming and is distracting. There is plenty not to like here, there are much better Export Stout style beers out there. See Buried Hatchet and Left Hand FTB 1. I will pass in the future, but will not keep me from at least trying some more Ridgeway brews in the future."
"chocolate character left lingering in the mouth. Overall it was decent but not something to please dark stout lovers as the label might lend you to believe."
"Dark, dark amber, I can see where it gets it's name. The smell is nice, rich with dark malts. Taste is not so great. It's lighter than I hoped but it does have some chocolate, coffee and toffee type flavors. The aftertaste is a little bit metallic. Not sure if my bottle was contaminated, but it did taste a little more metallic than any beer I've ever had. It is a really smooth beer and easy to drink although that metal taste I mentioned will prevent me from buying this again."
"This would rate better as a brown ale or porter than a stout. The lump of coal is a nice concept, but oversells this beer."
"D- it's almost a month past christmas and i didn't get a stocking, but if i did this wouldn't have been a bad stuffer. possibly the biggest english stout i've had, and by that i mean considerable alcohol content and body but with flavor and aroma that are par for the course. i wouldn't call it close to imperial, but it definitely packs a boozy kick that is warming to say the least. one and done for me, i've been a bad elf this year."
"D- Very good and very easy to drink. It's a shame I didn't get more"
"D: on the lighter side, making it quite drinkable"
"The body is lighter tahn expected and really pleasant - another one please and some Christmas pudding!"
"Notes: The weakest of the 4 Ridgeway Brewing Company beers that I tasted and rated this week."
"It has a very malty taste. Heavy, full-bodied. Alcoholly. Very smooth, with little spice for a holiday beer. Excellent stout, but if you are expecting a spicy winter warmer, this isn't it."
"Initially I didn't notice a particularly striking attribute or character, but the more I drink it the more it grows on me. It isn't a beer I'd normally make a reach for but it has more in the way of unique quality the more I drink it."
"Overall this was a lump of coal. I guess you got to give them credit for letting you know ahead of time."
"I'm glad this was a gift because i'd never spend money on it. Shame on Shelton for bringing in this crap from a sub-par brewer."
"D- Not a terrible beer...just not nearly as good as other quality stouts."
"Drinkable, but not what I was looking/hoping for....just so/so...eh."
"D: I found this beer to be OK, but not great. There are better Export Stouts out there in my opinion. I'm still glad I got try it."
"D - This beer was a gift on Christmas, and this beer is an easy drink and had some good flavor to go along with. To bad a certain Beer Show host had to ruin the shape of the bottle for me"
"Drinkable stout, well made, clean taste, almost uneventful, but still enjoyable."
"Drinkability: I couldn't really see having more than one bottle, but it does make an awesome Christmas gift!"
"My brother-in-law gave me a bottle of this for Christmas. Pours a very dark reddish-brown, thin off-white head. Smells of mostly of roasted grains, more like a Scottish Ale. Tastes much the same. Dark roasty flavors. A little too loose of a mouthfeel for a stout - too watery. Very drinkable, flavorful beer, but not quite a stout."
"D- An ok holiday stout. Nothing too exceptional. I think this would fair much better with a plate of holiday turkey and taters than alone."
"Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights on the edges. It has a khaki colored head with fine, creamy looking bubbles. Looks like a typical stout, deep, dark and delicious. It gives off a strong roasted malt smell, some dark fruit as well as floral tones, and a hint of licorice. The taste is pretty light, a bit watery. It has a strong roasty presence with toffee notes, dark chocolate, cocoa and a hint of coffee on the back, with a touch of alcoholic heat that numbs the palate just a bit. As it warms, more specific notes of plum and prune as well as fresh tobacco show up. The flavor progression I found went from roasty malt to dark fruit then to a cocoa/bitter chocolate finish. This stout has a light to medium mouthfeel, pretty crisp and makes for a good distinguished and creamy stout"
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. I liked it but it was lighter than most stouts that I have had. I would drink it again."
"As I poured it into a pilsner glass, it color was a rich syrupy gold. As the glass filled, the reddish gold color turned black. It smelled sweet an alcoholic. The taste was clean, sweet and bitter, and it had a definite taste of alcohol. Though it had a thick texture, its after taste was subtle and clean. It went well with my meal, but would have also been good alone."
"Drinkability: Went very well with a heavy meal and quite appropriate for a holiday meal. I couldn't have another one but good to have and try out. Not exactly a stout as I'm used to, but is really an English ale, and a pretty good one at that."
"D: There's not that much to this one, which aids in the drinkability. It's not a bad beer, it's just not very complex of flavorful. Nothing real special about this one, other than the name and label."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"Overall a forgettable holiday stout with no holiday character."
"Overall, nothing special your typical English stout lacking assertivness, flavor and direction."
"D - while it's not quite what you'd expect from the label, the overall profile is enjoyable and easy to drink. their presentation of 8% ABV is not terribly subtle, but on a day like today (>12"" of snow) you wouldn't want it to be."
"High drinkability. Good stuff overall, a bit underrated."
"D = This is actually a pretty pleasant drinking beer for the ABV."
"At this strength, drinkability is well above average. Very nearly comes off as session-able in that it's a tasty beer yet not too harsh, nor does it force you to think too hard while drinking it. Of course, the 8% will claim you if you try, but it feels like something you could drink a lot of without much of a problem. Seems to me a little underrated at B-....hardly a bad beer."
"Overall this wasn't a bad stout however the flavors really didn't make any kind of impact, rather they were just there. Not one to avoid but not one to seek out."
"All in all, this brew is not recommended. Ridgeway has other brews that are more worth your money. Should not be classified in the stout style because it cannot compete with brews in the same style."
"FYI.--- I am a porter and stout lover and this offering missed the style by a mile."
"Overall, not the stout for me. I just wasn't a fan of the English parts of this beer. It had some nice toffee notes but I gotta pass on this one."
"This is one hell of a drinker as far as stouts go. A refreshing crispness complements the deliciously malty flavors."
"Dark bodied stout with ruby highlights when held toward the light, mocha tan head swells leaving behind even thin bands of lacing. Aroma dark fruit and dark roasted malts very bitter root like notes, with fruit sweetness in the edges a bit of booze comes off in the nose as well. Flavor is creamy with dark chocolate and some packed in fruit notes mainly a touch of yogurt tartness and plum or raisin pudding. The mild coffee and dark chocolate roasts reign supreme bringing out a bit of alcohol in each sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy lightly carbonated milky feel to it. Overall drinkability is decent but definitely not a beer to give up on American crafts for."
"D: It was fun to try, but I don't think I could have more than one in a given holiday season."
"This was a really good treat, and I'm glad I tryed it. However, with a $6+ pricetag for a pint plus, I can get more for my buck elsewhere."
"salud!"
"great fireplace beer."
"This is an easy drinking stout with a nice balance of hops and malts. The body seems a bit thin, but otherwise a nice beer."
"Poured a dark red-brown with a respectable head that reduced to a collar. The aroma was sweet like maple syrup. The taste was chocolate, maple and some coffee. The feel was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was reasonable good. As export stouts go, this was a little above average."
"overall a delicious beer, but not incredibly complex. it also should be mentioned that they cover up the 8% very well."
"Aroma is there, but nothing to write home about... Chocolate covered cherries comes to mind with the aroma. Flavor is not heavily roasted, but more of a sour stout... moutfeel is weak for a stout, but it all works together ok... as a stout, not a home run, but as a winter warmer, this might get higher ratings... trying to rate it as a stout..."
"Drinkability- This beer is not one you'd reach for more of one of because th finish is so weak and alcohol is so high, but the 8 percent is extremely hidden so for some it would be drinkable for its very fast effective buzz, butt overall for a stout this just is not that good at all"
"taste is on the bitter side, unsweetened chocolate, espresso, sour malt, a little licorice, and few hops, ends a little dry and somewhat bitter."
"D - Moderate. The high ABV keeps this in check..."
"D - Quite drinkable, would be nice with food or a dessert."
"I have to say, I've sampled several offerings from this brewery now and I'm not really that impressed with any of them...not worth the hype the local distributors keep pushing..."
"This is a really good stout. Much better than most stouts but some, like Guiness, can give it a run for its money. Still, it's unique and worthy in its own merit. It would be easy to drink many of these in a session."
" ~ This is a good beer. One that's certainly worth the $5.00 I paid for the 25 ounce bomber. Dan's Liquor in Plover, Wisconsin is the joint where I picked up this carbon."
"D: Pretty highly drinkable because the 8% is nowhere to be found and the thin mouthfeel lends this to be drank and drank."
"D - If I was sharing the bottle with friends or family, I could have another glass. Since I am ""forced"" to have the bottle to myself, one is enough for me at a single seating."
"Body is a smoothened delight of a simple creamy stout-esk mode; a bit light, yet firm, soft and supple in its tang and carbonation. For a stout it could use more boldness and thickness. Its not completely empty, it actually carries a decent tone and character that's kind of charming and easy to take. Making for a good drinking stout. The 8% isn't evident anywhere, although after a couple or more it may catch ya by surprise. This is one Lump of Coal I would be happy with finding in my stocking."
"Feel and Drinkability: Incredibly smooth body, carbonation is low with tiny delicate bubbles. Body is medium-heavy. This is one that I really enjoy drinking. Feel is great, and it really works for this beer, everything is working together real nicely. As I already mentioned this is one that I'll drink again, a very nice beer. Give this one a go round if you've not had it...Tis the season...and the only time of the year that its available here (greater cincy area)."
"Nikki"
"Notes - Overall a good stout, if not terribly impressive. Still, the rarity of the style (at least around here) means that this one would be welcome back in my fridge, if I could buy it by itself."
"Ruby-black pour leaving thin, beige head. Aromas of malt, nuts, vanilla-coco. Mildly sweet taste of roasted grain, berries and faint vanilla. Some drying hops in the finish. Good solid boozy British stout. I like it. Recommended to wallow away the holidays, or any day."
"Good stuff."
"A very light and thin stout, and more of a fruity winter ale. Nothing special in my book."
"D - The 8% ABV is well concealed so I must admit this would be fine as a dessert beverage - perhaps paired with a decent cigar."
"Pitch black in color, it pours a sandy tan head. There is little to no lacing and the head dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is one of roasted malts with a bit of vanilla. I enjoyed the rich chocolate notes and this is followed up by sweet roasted malts. The mouthfeel is above average and this is a very drinkable beer. All in all a solid stout that would pair will with a variety of deserts."
"Like some of my other reviews, this was taken from my notes, and is from winter 2007. I definitely need to retry this beer."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. Good sized mocha head sticks around for a little while leaving some lace on the way down. Smells of milk chocolate, a little roast, some bread, maybe some licorice. Tastes like it smells chocolate, bread, maybe a bit of molasses and hops in there too. Oily/creamy mouthfeel, medium body, medium to high carbonation. Really kind of unremarkable. Tasted more like a brown or a porter than a stout. I though the body was a bit light for the style and it lacked enough roasted malt flavor and aroma. The taste was actually very flavorful, just not the beer I thought I purchased."
"D: I'd definitely have another if offered, but I have other stouts I trust more, so this will get skipped on a shopping trip."
"Clever label, mediocre beer. A 50dc bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. The beer was dark brown with red highlights. It had a medium-sized tan head that disappeared quickly. Roasted malt and faint chocolate aroma. Coffee and chocolate taste, teeny bit of hops. The beer seemed to be pretty watery, and I don't think I'll have it again."
"This poured an opaque cherry wood color with tan head. It smelled like milk chocolate and roasted coffee with some nuttiness and copper hops. It tasted like milk chocolate and barley and coffee malts, with some copper hops. As it warmed, it gained hints of licorice and molasses. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a mostly bitter but slightly sweet aftertaste. Overall this was a solid British stout, although another Ridgeway beer with nothing to make it especially Christmas. Regardless, it had good flavor and good body. It was easy to drink...surprisingly easy, as I thought it was 6% ABV until I looked it up and realized it's actually 8%. The alcohol was definitely well hidden. Otherwise, there was nothing fancy about this beer, but it was well refined and enjoyable."
"Overall: This beer missed the mark as an export stout. It lacked the head retention, and a bit of bitterness to the stout. The beer taste overtly sweet, Guinness is better Export stout. I had one in the Shannon Ireland Airport. The mouth feel is creamy and smooth. The finish is sweet. This beer could be more like a sweet stout, instead of an export stout. Overall the beer is good and easy to drink, except it missed the mark on a few areas."
"Another below average beer from Ridgeway. Good marketing, but sub par brewing. Pours a dark brown. Not much of a head. The nose has dark malts and fruits. The taste is fairly uncomplex. A good amount of roasty malts and subtle hops. Medium body pairs well with a greasy meal."
"Many better stout's out there for the drinking."
"Future outlook: A bit of a weird one. Never really felt like I was drinking a ""real"" stout. Not a terrible brew by any stretch, but not one I would feel compelled to revisit, and certainly not what I was expecting out of a ""dark holiday stout."""
"Roasty and chocolatey on the palate. Watery thin body, low carbonation, and somewhat tart finish. Disappointing. Easy to drink, I suppose, but not because of the flavors."
"Pours deep and dark, almost black, with ruby hilights when held to the light. Short tan head of foamy bubbles that form a solid floating cap. Smell is mildly sweet, roasted malty. Lighlty toasty grains, a bit fruity. Body is slightly thin and one dimensional. 8% alcohol is well hidden. OK as a regular dry stout, but needs alot more (aroma, flavor, body) to judged against other Foreign, high alcohol stouts. Again, slightly dissapointing."
"Found this in my stocking Christmas morning. Poured into a pint glass. Black in the glass, with hints of mahogany when held to the light. Poured with a roughly quarter-inch tan head. Aroma and taste are reminiscent of dark chocolate. Not too bitter, with a nice mouthfeel. This is a stout I'd drink again."
"Spicey stout and I like the style. Pours dark with amber highlights. Burnt aroma, lacey. Oh and some bittersweet chocolate. There is a spot of smoke in here and the spiciness, though the coffee throws me a bit off. Decent drinkable.Fine British beer and beat my expectations."
"Overall decent stout. Pretty typical of the style, but certainly worth the quaff."
"Very dark in color but not quite black-ruby black? Small tight 1/8"" head on top. Rather bland aroma-somewhat metallic and burnt. Faint port aroma. Mild port flavor, slightly oak like, a tad fruity. The roasted flavor is very faint. Has a sort of homebrew ""inky"" flavor. Ok body-could use some beefing up. Enjoyable enough but I was expecting something more, especially at 8%."
"Kind of thin, but relatively drinkable for 8%. A fun holiday buy, and would be a great gift for Christmas."
"Pours black with an acceptable tan head and moderate lacing that tends to fade. Roasted sweet chococate nose that is the beer's selling point. Good thickness on first taste, but could use a bigger flavor. Just not enough roast hit my taste buds to back up the aroma. As the beer warmed, the aroma lost some of its toastiness and left behind only the sweet chocolate. Finishes adequately with a slight hint at the abv, but left me wanting for more in its taste."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Yowza. That is one sweet beer. Unfortunately, that's not a compliment. It's cloying and syrupy. It tastes like someone dumped a load of sugar into the wort or whatever the right term is. I really need to start home brewing, so I don't sound like a moron on here. I like a big, sweet, malty English beer, but this tastes more like a Werther's Orignal than delicious malted barley. The color is a very, very dark amber with a good head and some lacing. The nose is malty, a tiny bit spicy and slightly hoppy. The flavor is much too sweet. It's malt with a ton of sugar thrown on top. Chocolate, butterscotch, toffee, syrup and honey dominate the flavor profile. The feel is syrupy and way over the top sweetness. I could not finish a full 50cl bottle. The name would lose its intended irony for me if I were receive this bottle in my stocking."
"I think this stout is wonderful. I would purchase again. Don't let other BA's mislead you, it is nowhere near as bad as they say. At least give it a try and see for yourself."
"M - Thin and watery. Moderate carbonation."
"The best part of this beer is how it looks. Midnight black pour with a short-lived brown head. It goes downhill from there. Sour, fake-malt aroma with dank wood and grain. Thin, watery mouthfeel. The taste is not like any stout I have ever had. Corn, grain, sour hops, metal, and burnt malt, but in a bad way. The worst is yet to come: a Jelly Belly popcorn aftertaste. Seems like a gimmick name for a bad, overpriced beer."
"Not my favorite English Stout, and kind of subpar. Once is enough for me with this beer."
"Pours a dark black color but thin. A small tan head that fades fast with no lacing. Smells sweet, almost like a milk stout. Drinks the same way, a nice thin and smooth mouthfeel. Sweet but not as sweet as a milk stout, but no bitterness at all. All in all it was a good beer, very drinkable I could have another."
"D-Fair drinkability. It has a nice hearty flavor that feels appropriate for a nice, cold-weather Christmas gathering. Not as deep, dark, and foreboding as the description on the label led me to believe. But still, an enjoyable brew."
"An interesting dark brown pour. Pretty translucent, light can permeate this, it is definetely not black. Smell of malt and raisin. Very malty flavors, some roast, toffee and mocha. Medium bodied, could be considered slightly creamy. As it warms it loses it's creaminess. Finish a little tart/coffee bitter. Very drinkable with 8% abv. I really warming up to this style and this is a good example of it."
"Tastes of dark chocolate malt, slight harsh alcohol overtone. Finishes dry and chalky. Tastes heavy on belgian sugar? Nice fireplace brew but could be improved upon"
"Prosit, MK"
"Drinkability is moderate. It's not good, but not bad either. It's certainly drinkable, but boring and uninspiring. This is a one time purchase for me."
"D: The alcohol flavours keep this one a sipper for me, and it has a nice warming effect on the way down. Wouldn't have more than one at any given time, but it's a pretty decent brew, nonetheless."
"I recommend this easy to drink beverage any time of year!"
"This is a very enjoyable offering. Heavy? Wicked heavy. It's a sippah!"
"D: Not a bad beer - drinkable to be sure - but not something to get overly excited about. Worth a shot."
"Drinks alright, but not much to get excited about here, give it a shot"
"Not a bad stout, no spices on the palete like I was hoping. Average overall."
"Overall, quite good. Worth trying out, even if there are plenty of great alternatives in the stout category."
"Pours to a black coal-like color with medium thin tan head that lingers awhile and leaves okay lacing. Nose is malty nuts and chocolate, and the mouthfeel is sojmewhat sweet, but also slightly biting. Flavor accentuates the nose, but also adds a hint of licorice. The 8% alcohol never made its way into the nose or flavor, but added to the warming finish. Not a bad beer."
"While the aroma was excellent, I found this beer to be lacking in both flavor and mouthfeel. Overall, this is a rather average stout. At $6 a bottle, I would not buy it again."
"not a bad beer, not a great beer. subtle and reserved. a lovely bedtime brew. which is exactly the point for which this beer was brewed."
"Not a winner."
"D: A pretty good beer overall, once I got into it, I'd buy again next Christmas season for sure."
"Pours a five+ finger light tan head that quickly fades leaving a good lace. Nose is malty. Almost like a lump of coal - faint mahogany highlights. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is caramel and malts. Finish is bittersweet chocolate. $5.95 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"note: This is my first review on Ba so in the future I will try to be more technical."
"The overall drinkability is pretty decent. The ABV is well-masked, and the taste is not bad, but it seems like the entire brew is an epitome of a weak stout. The aroma and taste are both underwhelming. Not an awful brew, something I could drink now and then, but nothing that will perk up my interest if I see it in the future."
"low burnt molasses smell, weird and abit unappealing ... solid medium head, abit disappointing in the taste department ... some burnt ash flavours... for 8% well masked .. lacks complexity but extremely smooth...""giggling granny""... lowest rated of the giftpack..."
"This is a decent beer in the Winter Series from Ridgeway. Seems that's the only time I see their beers are around Christmas and every year I see more and more. Again, this is a decent beer but there's so many others out there it's difficult to justify picking this up again."
"D- Okay beer, nothing fantastic. Might try it again."
"Mouthfeel is fairly rich and full for a stout, pleasant and a good choice for a cold winter eve."
"D - Good taste and a just lively enough carbonation keeps this one going down easy, especially as a dessert beer."
"d - goes down smoothly, a nice sipper. to quote my girlfriend, ""it's smooth going down and doesn't bite you back."""
"D - Good beer. This is a descent holiday beer."
"Surprised it hits 8%. It doesn't taste like a very big beer. Still, not too bad."
"Cheers"
"A really nice English Christmas (strong) stout."
"Poored a very dark color with a tan colored head that lasted about half the glass. Strong smell of caramel chocolate malt no noticeable hop aroma. The beer had a well rounded stout like taste but was a little to sweet for me. The 8% alcohol was not evident up front. Made me wonder if it was 8%. Need to drink more to find out."
"Pours a very dark black that some light can get through to show a ruby reflection. Minimal head. Very sweet on the nose and definite malt influence. Flavor is rich and beautiful. I will admit that off such a hokey label, it kind of lowered my expectations, but the truth lies in the bottle. Rich and chocolate-like (strong, but somewhat mild at the same time), but still bears strong stout characteristics. More even and smooth than I would have expected. Still though, it seems to drop off on the tail end in a way that I really don't want it to. On the finish you get a slight spicy kick. Feel is a little thin, but still good. Highly drinkable."
"D: Overall I liked it quite a bit. I'm not a Stout freak but I would definitely get this one again. Could use a bit more hopping but overall a decent beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark brown, just slight of black, but had reddish undertones. Head was a chocolatey brown, maybe 1/4 in thick. Aroma was at times alcoholy/stringently, and other times had a slight brown sugar sweetness to it. Taste had hints of bitterness, but also had touches of cherry flavors. Felt outstanding in the mouth. The only detraction was that it was a little thin. Had slight carbonation, but not enough to be annoying. The beer was very drinkable, hid the ABV well. Could easily drink more of this than is wise."
"This was a gift, and a pretty good one at that, and if i were to get it as a gift again i would be okay with that! Thanks mike!"
"Got a bottle of this in a variety pack for christmas. It pours a nice jet black color with bits of brown/red shining through and a small quickly fading tan head. The smell of it was pretty sweet and fruity for a stout. Kind of like cherries, but with some coffee, chocoate, and smoked smells backing it up. It has a good drinkable taste and mouthfeel overall to it. It tastes sweet and smokey, with a somewhat dry finish and little to know hop or bitterness. I like this brew overall and would enjoy some more of it, especially around the cold holiday season."
"Pours and looks like Coca-cola with a decent white head that goes away quickly. There is a lot of carbonation here, which goes along with the soda description. The aroma has coffee up front with notes of chocolate and vanilla, but nothing stands out too much. There is a nice alcohol burn at the end and some nice chocolate and roasted coffee as well. This is way too carbonated for a stout in my estimation - more creaminess would be welcomed here. This is by no means a bad beer, there is some good sweetness and it could be served as a dessert. Nothing I'd go out of my way for. Mild recommendation."
"Creamy aftertaste, again capuccino and dry fruit. A light and delicate note of roast in the back."
"Not my favorite, but not bad."
"Pretty easy to drink for abv. Not as rich as I was hoping - nor, as I mentioned before, as smoky. On its own it's a decent brew. A bit gimmicky, as intended. It could fit the ""lump of coal"" theme a bit better. It could be richer. Otherwise, it's a decent English winter brew."
"D - This is an unusual beer that defied my expectations, but I am quite pleased with it overall. I was expecting something with big body and subdued, English flavors; instead, I got subdued body and big, almost Belgian, flavors. As it happens, I am a fan of this combination; and while it misses the English stout style in some ways, it does so in a distinctly enjoyable fashion."
"Drinkability- For an English Stout, I really thought this was a good example. Flavor meld was good and well as the overall texture. I'm glad I got to try this one. Even though the $5 price tag was too steep."
"D: I like most stouts, but I was disappointed with this one. Not that it isn't drinkable, but the alcohol overpowers any of the other flavors that may be present. It certainly warms you up well and would make a solid choice after spending some time outside in the cold (unfortunately, I am in Florida)."
"Pours a deep amber color, almost black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a faint roasty malt. In the taste, sweet roasty malt and a somewhat lactose hint for this stout. A smooth to a small bitter mouthfeel, a lactose sweet malt aftertaste. Hides the alcohol very well, not that dark for a stout. Kind of feel like a milk stout."
"I opened this beer and poured it. I smelled the classic ridgeway funkiness, and noticed that it poured incredibly thin and far too carbonated. The taste was the classic ridgeway funkiness. Why do all their beers taste so damn identical! Very thin for a stout and not near malty or even hoppy enough. WAAAY too thin to be a stout. Goes down like a black lager. The drinkability i suppose is decent but i really dont recommend this as a stout."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy drinking, but that's because there is not a lot here. I expected more botterness, more roasted barley, more something. I could see this being a smooth aged drink with some of the rum raisin flavors developing."
"Drinkability: Alcohol content is too high IMO. One beer is ok. Will I buy another? Probably not this year. Just an over alcoholed stout, that is rather average."
"D: I can drink it but.. bleh This is one lump of coal I didn't deserve"
"This is an easy to drink stout--perhaps a good introduction to the big boys."
"This is a very mediocre beer with good marketing behind it. There are far better holiday brews out there."
"When poured, the color a medium dark brown with some tan foam and there was lace on the side of my glass. There was a smell of sweet roasted malts and a hint of molassis was evident. The taste was more complex than the smell. Roasted malts, molassis, but then there was a hint of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. Nicely put together, just a touch to bitter. I thought the flavor got even better as the stout warmed up. More flavor and less bitterness."
"The lump of coal was similar to its name. I was excited to buy it was good marketing that got me. It poured a dark amber no foam, no lacing, no head retention. I tasted toffee and chocolate and the smell was roasted. In the mouth is was pretty flat and had little carbonation. This was the first try with this style but it didn't do much for me."
"Not my favorite stout. A decent one that has a cool name."
"Color is lighter than what I expected for a stout - dark ruby-brown and almost opaque. Aroma is rich and smoky with coffee and molasses undertones. Flavor is not as strong as other stouts I have tried but still pleasing - smoky with coffee undertones and a hint of molasses. Finish is smooth and leaves a little bitterness, but the pleasant bitterness of hops. This is one lump of coal that you won't mind finding in your holiday stocking!"
"A little bitter aftertaste on the finish, but all in all a decent beer."
"Not a bad holiday stout but there is some astringency that detracts from the overall quality. The beer is a deep mahogany, brown with a decent head, retention, and lacing. The smell is a bit tinny, some malts, but not all that distinct one way or another, although you'll get some cherry aromas as the beer settles. The beer is full bodied, moderately carbonated, with plenty of warming alcohol notes, which probably need to be hidden a bit more. The taste is strong, sweet, toasted malts, maybe some burnt charcoal-like flavors as well. There is the astringency which isn't all that pleasing, and the mouthfeel is rather buttery. The beer is not bad, certainly apropos for the cold nights of winter, but this isn't my favorite stout. The aftertaste is slightly metalic and there is a bit too much alcohol on the tail end for my liking."
"So far, this Ridgeway brew is the redeeming one of the bunch. I will buy it again, probably before Christmas, and maybe even give some friends a Lump of Coal for the holiday."
"D - This was a pretty descent stout. I really expected more, it just didn't overwhelm me with flavor."
"I poured this disappointing beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black and poured a big tan fine bubbly head. It was bready smelling and did not smell like a stout. Did not taste like one either. Acrid aftertaste mettalic and nothing but alcohol left on the palate. The beer did have good lacing for whatever good that does ya. Not very stoutish in my opinion I will not buy this expensive beer again."
"This is certainly a stout for malt lovers. It focuses on the malts, but it's also somewhat complex, with chocolate tones mixed in with the bitter notes. Recommended."
"I finally found an enjoyable brew in this lot of British holiday brews. The dominant flavors here definitely evoke thoughts of fruit; this is derived from the mix of tart notes, light sweetness, and & concentrated malt flavors). Perhaps not a great beer, but it is certainly a beer that is an enjoyable sipper for this particular evening. I could ask for a touch more richness of flavor and body though."
"The appearance a deep brown to almost black with ruby highlights around the edges, the head about an inch or so, creamy light brown, after its rather quick demise the lacing covers the glass. Nose has a nice roasted grain aroma, sweet with hints of chocolate and coffee, pleasantly spicy. Start has a rich malt sweetness, and the taste of burnt toast quite evident, top is medium to full in feel. Finish has a pleasantly mild acidity, the hops personable, sweet burnt toast aftertaste clings to the palate, a nice stout, and one that suits the style in my humble opinion."
"Decent stout, but not anything spectacular, or even particularly holiday like about this."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours, you guessed it, coal-black with a minimal medium-colored tan head. The smell is roasted caramel and plums. Seems appropriately Christmas-y. The taste is surprisingly dry, with roasted coffee and nuts dominating. The aftertaste is like you just had a pint of espresso. All coffee all day. The mouthfeel is silky & surprisingly thinner than I would expect for a stout. Closer to a porter, really! The drinkability is good, although the dry finish limits it. If you like Imperial stouts or Milk stouts, this one is not a bad one to try. Probably best to just let one of your ""I know he likes beer, so..."" relatives give this to you in the gift pack, though. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out on its own merits."
"Beer poured black with ruby undertones when held up to daylight. Tan head never really developed. Nose is of sweet malts and a hint of coffee. Taste is of toasted chocolate malts, with a hint of coffee balanced by a dry bittering hop. Mouthfeel is thin for the style and lacks the creamy quality that are in most high abv stouts. Drinkability is OK. The beer has mellowed a bit over the last three plus months. The first time I had this the alcohol was very up front with each sip. This is worthy of a shot."
"Update - I re-tried this holiday beer the day before Thanksgiving 2009 and it's just as I remembered it from my notes. I got a little better aroma from the glass this time around so upped my Smell rating half a point but otherwise this was right on."
"Drinkable as in yes you can drink it but with as little flavor as this has why would I ever pick this over a regular Guinness? Unremarkable in all respects."
"Black body with some ruby red highlights. Some spotty lace on the surface of the beer. Licorice in the nose. Tasty beer but not really stout like. Good malts, but not much bitterness. A little thin in the mouth for the style I think, and in many ways this isn't really very ""stout like"". Quite sweet with a little alcohol in the background of the finish."
"Drinkability: Below average. One and done. I was glad to finish this beer off. Not to mention an above average price makes this beer less palatable."
"The name, label, 8%, etc etc combine to create an image of a beer that IMO this is definitely NOT. Too bad. Congrats - your advertising made my friend buy your beer, but instead of a ""dark holiday stout"" it reminds me of a better than average hearty porter. Nice gift, but I don't think I'll buy it."
"Overall Impression: Its a fairly enjoyable beer, I just cant seem to get any firm flavors out of it."
"a nice stout in all categories, particularly in taste, in which the heavy roasted flavors of most stouts are turned down a bit, and replaced with some notable dark fruit flavors. a very nice interpretation of the style, hiding the 8% abv very nicely. warming and inviting; very nice for a winter evening."
"It's a stout and as black in appearance as any other. Poured from a bottle which perfectly fills my imperial pint glass. It has a modest head. Lace adorns the glass in a web like quilt pattern and fades away. Hints of licorice in the finish. Coffee, hazelnut, some fruitiness...like berries in the background as you drink further. Chewy, biscuity, viscous mouthfeel. Nice yet light carbonation. It's very difficult to detect much in the way of aroma. Again, hints of coffee but that's about it. I like the 8% abv...ballsy for a stout. You can drink more than a few in one sitting. Would love to get ahold of one on tap. Humorous name and description on the back of the bottle. Worth the price."
"Pours black with a tan, fluffy head. Smelled of raisins, chocolate, and some fruitiness. Had some yeastiness, bread-like aromas. Thought it was lacking roasted aromas compared to other stouts. Taste was okay, mostly bitter chocolate with some mild sweetness. Medium-bodied. Easy to drink but doesn't really make me want to grab another. Not very interesting. The lack of roasted flavors is kind of a downer for me on this one."
"Received this for a present from a friend, chilled and poured into a nonic. The head lingers about a centimeter above the surface its sort of a chocolate milk shake color and slight lacing. The body seems opaque with small hints of ruby. Smells of rum raisins, light chocolate, toasted malt, hints of vanilla, coffee and maybe a tinge of smokiness. Taste starts with a round dark malt and shapes into the chocolate character, which comes toward the end of the midsections. The hops only really manifest themselves in a mild bitterness that helps to balance the more robust character of this drink. Funny enough something about the flavor of this reminds me of drinking a coke soda. The mouthfeel on this is a bit on the lighter side rather clean and with a dry finish. Honestly this is not a bad beer, but its not that interesting. It has lots of elements that at first get you interested and then sort of dont quite achieve what you'd hoped they would, yet sill worth a try."
"What a difference a day makes. This is why you should taste twice, review once. I was ready to crucify this beer last night -- I HATED it -- but a fresher palette, an appropriate glass and a bit closer to room temperature, and presto -- coal turns to gold."
"Medium body, low carbonation. Balance seems reasonable. Alcohol is hidden well in the flavor & aroma. Warming effect does slowly work it's way into the picture. Could be better, could be worse...drinkable, but not terribly compelling."
"Pours a deep brown leather with a light sandpaper head. The raosm is of roast and slightly astringent cream. But no alcohol. This is the strongest English stout I've ever had. The flavos carries some good roasted mlats character, with hints of bananas and some creamed coffee from Speedway. The palate is very smooth and meidum. The alcohol is covered up very well."
"drink more than a few. This beer just reminds more more of a porter than a stout. Not a bad beer nothing to get excited about though."
"Drinkability: A very nice stout. The only thing that makes it holiday like imo is the warming strenghth. Very pleasant roasty , chocolatey ,and sweet flavors that are kept in a great creamy balance."
"Taste consists of the dark fruit, some spiciness, ample malt and a quick, crisp finish. Mouthfeel is thinner than I expect for the style. Drinkability was decent, but one bottle was enough for me. I received this beer as a gift and will probably not seek it out. It is certainly drinkable, but there are a lot of other beers I'd rather have."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a small tan head. Not much read retention or lacing. It smells like bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit and roasted malt. It tastes the same way to me, but the beer has a bitter, dry finish. Mouthfeel is light/medium, it's closer to being watery than it is to being creamy. Drinkability is OK, it is smooth and easy to drink. Not a great beer, but it's drinkable. I'd have one of these again."
"unfamiliar with the style might find pleasant."
"Based on the 2 I've tried so far, I can see purchasing this foursome (Lump of Coal, Bad Elf, Rudolph's Revenge, and Santa's Butt) again next year... and the year after... etc. These are fun, tasty holiday treats!"
"Lump of Coal appropriately enough pours a virtually black color with only a hint of ruby highlights on the edges and a thin tan head from a brown 500 ml bottle. The aroma is mild and malty. There are some nice chocolate notes in the flavor. This beer is kind of esthery, and the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"For any fan of British ales, this is a must-try. For fans of porter or stout, don't miss this! And for your everyday average beer lovers in general, what a charm this is!"
"this is a nice stout, holiday stout or whatever-style-of -stout it is. i'd revisit this one."
"Appears as the same suggests, dark like coal, though light enough to see some dark red hues. Little head. Smells of smokey malt. Tastes of dark malts with some hoppy dryness. Not a watery beer, but not as creamy as many other stouts. Very drinkable, though kinda expensive. Worth grabbing a Christmas variety pack during the holidays though for a Lump of Coal."
"Not very drinkable. When cold, there was no flavor. Once it was warmed up, the flavors intensified, but so did the bitterness and dry finish. This beer is not worth $5. However, this beer was a little bit better than I was expecting, because I think this beer was created as a joke. And as a joke it works quite well. Know someone that likes beer, but you want to poke fun at? Lump of Coal: ""Much More Than You Deserve for Xmas This Year"". I got one for my father-in-law."
"Nothing too remarkable here. It's a smooth drinker, and there is nothing offensive about it, it's just mild and kind of boring and I was expecting more from this rather pricy holiday stout. Also, it seemed rather thin for the style, but that could be partly due to a lack of carbonation."
"A nice, drinkable holiday stout."
"Taste, more of chocolate and roasted malt. Some coffee tones come through, but not very strong. Sticky sweet, and the dry hops finish it off pretty well. It became a better brew once it warmed up. Easy drinking. Can use another one."
"Drinkability: The best part of this beer is how well it hides it's alcohol. With the relatively clean taste, this is any easy beer to drink."
"Pours nearly black dark-brown with red edges. Forms a miniscule head that rapidly dissolves to thin lace. Doesn't smell like very much when poured at cellar temperature; fleeting powdered cocoa, alcohol, and dark-toasted malts. Tastes somewhat better than that. There's little initial flavor, but the center develops dark fruits and toasted malt heft. The finish becomes powdery and dry with chocolate and bitter medicinal alcohol. A rich and creamy sipping beer in the mouth. The beer becomes unexpectedly heady over time. Warming, but not especially good."
"Overall: There's enough complexity to keep this intriguing for a holiday warmer, but it's not weird or overly spicy. It definitely should be warmed just a bit before serving to bring-out some of this complexity. I wish I had a bit of cheesecake or some chocolate covered fruit to bring-out the flavors in different ways. It's hard to drink a lot of them, but that's really not necessary anyway for an 8% a.b.v. brew anyway."
"Very dark, though enough light gets through to reveal some crimson highlights around the edges. The coppery head is fine but lacking in both quantity and staying power. Nose is pleasantly malted with only hints of roasty smokiness. The strongest point of this stout is its taste, with semi-dark malts ruling the day but some dryness there as well. The mouthfeel is good too--not as full/creamy/chewy as many stouts but not at all watery. This was nice and went down very easily."
"Drinkability: Really pretty poor, with some serious off flavors"
"Pours almost black with garnett highlights. Light tan head which quickly dissipates to a thin film. Aroma is chocolate and coffee. Taste is initially chocolates, then roasted malts, fruitiness in the finish. Seems medium bodied, lighter carbonation and some alcohol burn at the end. This is a pretty good stout, I'll probably get this again."
"Pours a dark black with a sticky light tan head. The aroma is faint with some nice notes of sweet chocolate and coffee. I was surprised by the taste after the faint aroma. The flavor is really nice and roasted dark malts with some chocolate. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium amount of carbonation. Overall, while this is a far stretch from being an ""excellent"" beer, it is certainly a decent one. This is really not something I would seek out again especially considering the high pricetag of $5.85 for the bottle."
"A fitting name for a beer that opens with a distinct charcoal aroma from roasted dark grains. Though these aromas dominate, there is a Schwarzbier malt, ferment, and hop character to back it up. Looks opaque black and viscous. Flavors are again dominated by black roasted malts with a follow up of toasted malts, light cocoa, and light coffee. An underlying sweetness boarders on lactose and / or oats. Accompanying this sweetness is a velvety, almost oily texture that mellows the beer and rounds off the rough alcohol edges. Well melded and easy to drink for such strong flavors."
"This stout poured black as coal with sudsy, brown foam that settled fairly quickly. The smell was dark roasted malt and barley with a hint off sweetness. The taste was richly malty with a touch of sweetness. There was modest hoppiness. Overall it was a bit overly sour and tangy. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-full body with modest carbonation. This was an OK stout, though a bit sour. (The other beers in this bottled set were not sour.)"
"The beer poured a fairly deep brown, not quite black color with a think tan head into my pint glass. The nose is a roasted malt and coffee mix that is pleasing. The taste is roasted as well and although I enjoy the initial blast of the coffee flavor, it does not linger long enough to really enjoy it."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking. I couldn't handle drinking more than one, and I may not even finish this one. It's not hoorrible, but the alcohol aftertaste is a killjoy and kind of ruins the experience for me."
"Drinkability - a weak start but a solid stout where it matters."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- I am daring myself to go further... nope, ain't gonna happen. The harsh, acidic attack in the mouth leaves no place for texture. I am trying, but this beer needs serious help! Goodbye, Lump of Coal... I certainly did not deserve this punishment this winter."
"D- This had some nice roasted dark malt aromas but it sour/ tart cidery taste is really dominating the finish. I'm not sure if because this is a holiday brew that this is on purpose or if this is a bad bottle. It doesn't have notes of oxidation or any other signs of infection such as over carbonation or mold floaters."
"Drinkability: This beer was dam near a drain pour. I dont know if I drank it to late and it expired. To many other good stouts out there to waste time or money on this."
"Overall this is a very drinkable brew. I will buy again."
"500 ml bottle pours a reddish black color with a small brown head that quickly disappears that does leave some lacing in my glass. Chocolate aromas, cola, chocolate and coffee flavors, not much carbonation gives this a watery mouthfeel, alcohol aftertaste. Not a very flavorful stout."
"Well they can't all be homeruns. Probably good for a guy who drinks Guinness at bars but doesn't have much experience with craft beers."
"This is yet another dud Shelton Bros English import. Okay this beer is drinkable but cost plus lack of taste equals not another purchase. The label talks the talk but the beer doesnt walk the walk. On the whole this beer tastes alright but too many aspects leave me saying, ho hum. My first bottle was given to me as a gift, thanks Howard & Lynne. The second bottle was sampled at a party. I am happy I didnt have to buy this one! Heed my review and skip this beer."
"Pours a very dark brown, certainly not opaque. Smell is quite fruity, black cherry, molasses...it actually smells very much like a nice dopplebock. Odd, but perhaps not bad. Upfront on the palate is a quick stab of roast then mild chocolate and a large fruitiness that then backs away as earthiness evolves through the finish. Not overly complex, but a good flavor, albeit insipid and a bit watery for an 8% stout. Medium low carbonation, and extremely drinkable if nothing else. Not even a hint of the 8% here."
"I guess I was naughty last year. There was something very wrong with this beer. It was totally sour and gross. Maybe that was the point, or some infection was the culprit. The beer was black, but the head was more like a white haze on the top. There was next to no smell, and the flavor was like sour milk. I guess there was nothing wrong with the mouthfeel, exept being thin for the style. Oh well. DNF."
"The taste? Well, mighty weak in the malts, poor for the style, with a noticeable hoppy finish. Couple hints of charcoal & burnt toast - but just hints The whole bottle was thin and watery, and the harshness lasted throughout. I suppose one could say this was drinkable, but the price (over $5) for a 500ml bottle would keep me away for any serious session work. Just not much character to be found."
"Pours black alright but the disturbing thing about this sample and seemingly a few other BA's is the vinous sourness that suggests to me lactobacillus infection. The beer was much too sour for the style and all the roasty notes were covered up with the sourness. Tasted like an ok watery stout that somehow picked up an infection."
"Drinkability: very average at best. I like a winter brew to warm me up during the cold months, but this was a stout that would work well in the summer heat since it is so light."
"This is a lame stout that's not very impressive at all. Save your $5.50 and spend it on something else."
"I won't even waste my time with the rest of a review. Disgusting swill."
"Pours a dark brown color, with some ruby edges. Thick egg-white creamy head. Head disappeared quickly, leaving a very thin layer of foam. Soft roasty, and chocolate notes in the aroma. Floral hop aroma. Flavor starts off roasty, dry then vinous. At the back end, the flavor profile seems to fall off. Warming alcohol presence. Slight earthy hop flavor. Low carbonation. It started off fairly well, but really falls apart at the end. Disappointing."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown with a soapy tan head. Subdued roasty aromas with a slight earthiness. Very malty upfront with a light resiny, molasses-like finish with lingering spiciness. The English stout characteristics are pronounced, maybe stepped up a notch. Still, kind of watery, but not taking away from the whole experience. Not the greatest stout to come from across the pond, but certainly no sloucher. Pairs up nicely with it snowin' like a mofo outside right now."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer for savoring, mostly because of price. Otherwise, I could destroy a 6pk of it."
"Drinkability is well its good but for the price wouldn't purchase again as I could be drinking something better for the money."
"A very dark color,but the head was small and left wat too soon.The smell is very faint with only a hint of roasted malt.The taste is a little light,but you can taste both coffee and chocolate.The m/f is light/medium and not as balanced as I would like.This is a pretty good stout,but I would try a different one next time just because this is so expensive."
"not bad, but not great...and worth the $5.89 I paid for the 25 ounce bottle?...not?..."
"I wouldn't want to drink many of these at 8%. It's an ""okay"" end to the day. But I can think of other holiday beers that I'd pick over this one."
"M&Dr - A little light on the carbonation and somewhat of a light body, not what i was expecting. It was smooth and nicely balanced to be sure but i like my stouts to be more of a stout. I may have needed to let this warm up a bit to open the bouquet and taste."
"This is an alright brew, but there are better ones out there for the money."
"I wont go out of my way to find this one again. It isnt terrible but there is much better stuff out there for the same/comparable price."
"Pours not quite a lump of coal dark but close with some nice ruby tint thru out with an off white head that is gone quite quickly.deeply roasted malt and dark fruit in the nose with a hint of milk chocolate,big robust flavors for a big stout tarry and fruity roasted of course with a light smoky flavor in the finish.Wow I really like theis holiday stout big and complex and quite quaffable to boot."
"D: overall this is a quite delicious and deceptively drinkable stout. Not quite like other ""traditional"" English stouts I've tried, this one bears some resemblance to ""foreign stout"" IMO. Interestingly, from the several so-called foreign stouts I've tried, despite their high alc. strength, somehow they're mostly thin-bodied~~ I really wonder why?"
"Overall, an interesting beer. Perhaps a little less ""stouty"" than I'd like and the alcohol is a bit too up front. But, definately worth a try."
"Medium/full bodied. Reasonably smooth and easy to drink. Well balanced but not really strong on anything. Very low carbonation and well hidden alcohol content."
"Notes: Not for me, not bad, not good, I demand excellence... This is not it. But I do love all the stories on the label."
"Dark but not opaque, mahogany highlights shine through. Tannish head head is not big but leaves collars for lace on the glass. Aroma is reserved, mostly pale caramelized sugar, not much special. Flattish mouthfeel and not that pleasant, not coating or creamy. Flavors show some aspects of generic fruit-flavored gum, transitioning into mild and weak coffee but without an overall hard-roasted bitterness. This beer has the alcohol content to verge on Imperial or Double in strength, but compare it to Samuel Smith Imperial and its easy to see that it doesn't have nearly the interest. Sweet and unidimensional, maybe cantelope flavors are most obvious."
"16.9 ounce bottle. $4.99 at Wine Warehouse in Charlottesville, VA.."
"Lump of Coal is the final member of the 'holiday quadruplets' from Ridgeway Brewing, joining Santa's Butt, Bad Elf and Very Bad Elf. It isn't the best member of that group, but that probably has more to do with my affection for hoppy beer than anything else. It's a solid effort that I'd be more than happy to drink at Christmas or any other time of the year. I certainly wouldn't mind getting a Lump of Coal in my stocking this December 25th."
"Not bad. I'd be interested to have one that had been sitting around for half a year or so."
"Drinkability: oh, heck yes! Even with an 8% ABV I could drink this fine brew all day. With or without food, this is a great beer."
"Is: Not a bad brew, but the harshness makes it a little rough. The odd overall feel of it makes it a Christmas time drink- once a year. The fruit comes out as it warms, and it became a little more pleasant."
"But, I must say, Ridgeway could tweak this into a first-rate classic."
"Had this one on tap a couple of nights ago. Poured to a deep dark black color, with no head what so ever. Must say from the way it looked I was questioning what I had gotten! The aromas where quite nice with a rich chocolate flavor with a fruit like tinge to it along a burnt/toasted smell. The taste was dominated by a burn malt flavor with some sweetness that seems to go well together. Over all this brew was not bad, not a favorite by any stretch but one I would try again."
"Very interesting label design, but the blurb on the side about having this to make family gatherings bearable was a bit of a downer. Poured an appropriate coal black, with almost no head and little visible carbonation. Overall, carbonation was low, but adequate. Hint of chocolate malt in the aroma. Malt flavor contained a pronounced but pleasant hardwood smoke note. Finish was sweet, with lingering lactose sugar flavor, the beer is certainly weighted toward the sweet stout end of the English spectrum. Not impressive, but enjoyable."
"poured with small tan head that faded into a skim and a black as night color. roasted barley mainly dominating the aroma with some soft syrupy molasses, treacle and burnt sugar also. sweet taste upfront followed a burnt toast, maybe burnt malt or burnt sugar. very very balanced beer and very drinkable. body does get a little on the thin side as it warms up and then you get some alcohol, but still very nice. big thanks, clvand0."
"This beer pours a dark color with a small head that dies off and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly sweet and has lots of chocolate and a little coffee. Very pleasant. The flavor is mostly chocolate with a tiny bit of coffee and a hint of raisin. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Quite enjoyable."
"It's a bit rich to drink a lot of, but I'll happily try."
"Drinkability: A nice Christmas beer but nothing out of the ordinary. I'm glad I tried it but I won't be back. Too much other fun stuff out there for me..."
"The beer pours a black color with a nice finger tall dark tan head. Looks nice. The nose is a hint of coffee, and a ton of chocolate in there. Its very sweet. The flavor is nice. Tons of chocolate in there, but it takes a second for your tongue to recognize it. The aftertaste is very mellow, with just a slight hint of hop dancing on my tongue. The feel on this beer is moerate to thick, a bit creamy as well. Velvety smooth and easy drinking. I think this is a nice beer overall. As it warms, it becomes even more drinkable."
"Drinkability is average. Some decent flavors but kind of one-dimensional and somehat ""flat," not bad just not memorable."
"Black as a ""Lump of Coal"". No light passes through. Has a mocha brown head. There is a good chocolaty aroma with just a hint of coffee in the background. The taste seems more sweetly vanilla than chocolate. Only in the finish is there a nice coffee bitterness."
