"Something between foreign stout and dubbel. Smell of dark fruit, bitter aftertaste. Unique. Very recommendable. I liked it better than Magma and Westkust from the same brewery."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, best before 8/6/2015. Pours slightly hazy deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, white grape, light pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, white grape, light pepper, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Light peppery yeast spice/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, pear, apple, grape, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian style imperial stout. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Very much a milk chocolate stout, sweet, flavorful, quite good."

"Poured into a tulip. Nice chunky head. Looks dark brown almost black. Smells like coffee, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, roasted malt, wood fire. Medium body, low carbonation, tastes like burnt candy, bitter chocolate, brandy-like, a little like Guinness but better. A lingering coffee finish. Powerful dark flavors that shadow the alcohol. I would drink it for breakfast if it wasn’t so strong"

"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with roasted malt, cocoa, acidic, and dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour cocoa and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a below average beer that is definitely suffering from a mild infection, but is still fairly drinkable as it is."

"I paid only $6.99 for this magnum, which struck me as a very good deal. I had not seen this brand in my town before, and am encouraged by the increasing variety of craft beer in my neck of the woods."

"Medium bodied to start but finishing somewhat fuller. Warming almost from the start. Finish is dryish. A really nice brew that gets better as it warms.."

"Good."

"The beer is a dark mahogany color with a thick beige cap which coats the glass with sticky lacing. The aroma brings a myriad of fruits, to include apples, grapes. Dark malt and toffee notes. Pretty sweet, with prominent Belgian yeast and caramel tones. Definitely some plum, fig, raisin character in this one. Sweet apples soaked in alcohol. Pretty good."

"It was reddish in color, but it's appearance made you wonder what it tastes like. This doesn't taste anything like a stout - more like a wine. I'm not saying that the taste was bad, it tastes nice, just very different. It would be a good choice to recommend to wine drinkers, who want to know what beer to try first."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a dark red brown, translucent in the pour, but nearly opaque in the full glass. Eighth inch light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark and fresh dried fruit, toasted malt, molasses, a hint of cardboardy oxidation. Flavor is more fresh dark fruit, sweet/sour lighter fruit, coffee, chocolate, bit of molasses and hints of Belgian yeast. Finishes with mild coffee, hint of hops bitterness and residual semi sour light fruit. Medium bodied with little carbonation. As advertised, a melding of Belgian dark ale and a drier foreign style stout, leaning a bit more in the Belgian dark direction. A nice change of pace for either and a good job at combining the strengths of both. The slight sourness was a bit distracting for me, but I still enjoyed this quite a bit. The mild oxidation elements made me look closer at the bottle for dates and I was amused to see ""Best by: see above", with nothing above or below to indicate date. Nice try, guys."

"O – great beer, reminds me of Trappistes Rochefort 10, I'd say it's more like a Belgian Strong Dark than an export stout, I would have it again in a heartbeat"
""
"O: recommended."

"captivating. the high abv makes it worth journeying further. a slight chalky grittiness reminding me it's a stout style. a hard dark fruit malt-iness that reminds me of other, long ago tried brews.... worth a try. like i said, my first belgian stout. never considered it before."

"I am not so much into stout but this is quite pleasant and has enough carbonation to make really drinkable. I would drink it to substitute after dinner espresso."
""
"O: Tasty, flavor profile with character. Pleasant overall."
""
""
"Overall, not a favorite. I had a bomber and after about half, I was really bored with this brew. Structure is fine, just not what you'd want to drink a lot of. For my personal taste, I won't have this again."
""
"M: slight imbalance between the frothy head and the semiprickly carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this beer. Don't bring presuppositions to the party, and let your nose, eyes and tongue be the judge. Great color, malty flavor, and complex overtones abound. Will definitely have again, and will add to my pubs bottle list"
""
""
"Sampled this beer from the bottle. Upon pouring I instantly noticed it's ruby brown color with a generous rich brown foam head. The aroma displayed characteristics of rich chocolate and some dried fruit undertones. It had a sweet chocolate flavor with a mild presence on the tongue. It finished with some enjoyable sourness. This is a very tasty treat that I recommend trying."
""
"From the 11.2 fl. oz. bottle with the cap stamped 0204101216. Sampled on April 20, 2012. The pour is a deep amber brown with reddish hues and a tremendous, puffy, mocha head. The aroma brings out dark malts, yeast, and a touch of alcohol bitterness. The body is medium to full. The taste also has a pungent bitterness to it with roasted dark malts and the alcohol not as well integrated as I would have hoped. It was good in its own way and I think is fairly true to the style."
""
"O - Pretty solid all around, if not outstanding in any particular way. I would have this again."
""
""
"This poured a malty brown color with some foam. There was a light, malt-estery aroma with a more definite malt sweetness on the palate. Lots of dark fruits, mostly figs with some raisins on the flavor. All-around decent brew."
""
""
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a reddish black with a four finger tan head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, dark chocolate, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I have to be honest that all aspects of this brew were really quite nice. However, the aroma was a bit of a letdown for me. It just lacked the complexity and pleasant notes that can be had in the flavor. Really glad I got to enjoy this one with my dinner the other night and suggest you try it as well if you have not already."
"O: this is my first Belgian stout and while good is not quite what i prefer from my stouts ( i enjoy Russian imperials). something different but that's about it"
"O: very nice beer. I've had this a couple of times, and this time I really enjoyed it. Excellent beer overall, and my favorite foreign stout so far."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice change from a more traditional stout, but not something I'd want to go back to often due to its big softness. The cigar-like aroma is pretty nice though."
""
"Dark brown color with thin head that dissipates quickly. Smell is a little chocolatey. Taste is fruity with some chocolate and a dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with small amount of carbonation. Overall this was really just o.k. Not great."
""
""
"11.2oz. bottle served in a snifter. Bottle conditioned. Poured a dark copper/brown Finger of fine bubble tan head. Slightly metallic aroma at the start. Fruity, yeasty aroma as it warmed along with a little black patent malt. Medium bodied and smooth. Very dry, some chocolate in the finish. Not much roasted barley character that you would expect in a stout. Not a lot of Belgian yeast character either. Didn't do a whole lot for me."
"Overall: Pretty damn good. Was surprised ordering this at the restaurant and will keep ordering it. "
"Another late-night snack tonight. it pours a dark, murky sienna topped by over a finger of wan tan foam. The nose comprises toffee, light roasted malt, graham cracker, sweet and mild cocoa, and a touch of walnut and cashew. The taste brings in more of the same, with the cocoa coming in stronger, and a touch of both cola and lightly acrid coffee being added to the mix. Not bad. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation, and a lightly creamy feel. Overall, a pretty decent export stout, nothing amazing but something fairly drinkable and generally enjoyable."
"Presentation: Packaged in an eleven-point-two (335 ml) bottle, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
""
"Drinkability: Not really a fan. My first and last. It tasted like a dry Irish stout and a Belgian mix, some roastiness but with the sweet caramel backbone of a Belgian."
""
"O- unique tastes like a strong ale but with some stout characteristics a sweet and prickly brew"
"Not impressed."
""
""
"Troubadour Obscura pours not quite black, but rather a very dark brown, and has faint cherry highlights when held up to light. There's a touch over three fingers of tan foam that rise up above the beer proper. Head retention is very good, and lacing is a little bit spotty, but still pretty nice for a stout. The nose is very surprising. It's almost devoid entirely of most traditional aromas that are associated with a stout, and instead smells much more like a nice dark Belgian ale. Specifically, there are a lot of dark fruit smells wafting about, with just a little bit of roast there to balance things out. It's nice, it's just a little bit off for something that calls itself a stout. The flavor brings a bit more balance. Specifically, a nice chocolate note comes in and shares the lead. The result is a flavor profile that resembles cherries and plums drizzled in chocolate. The body is a little drier than a typical stout, and the carbonation a little more active. It really falls in well with the flavor profile though to create what I'd imagine a Belgian Stout would taste like, which is what I get the impression this beer's aiming for (even if it's not a recognized style on BA). Troubadour Obscura is a refreshingly different beer from a Belgian brewer, and a fairly tasty one to boot."

"I'm deffinetly passing out alot of beer points."
"As I poured this one I saw it as more of a stout than a Dark Ale, either way the color was indeed dark. The head was fluffy and tan in color. The lacing was very good on this brew. The smell of the brew has some chocolaty notes on the nose as well as some bready yeasty aromas and dark fruit sweetness. The taste of the beer was semi-sweet with a nice dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, very nicely done. Overall this brew in my opinion was really good."
"It's a darn fine beer for sure. A little different, but that's a really good thing in this case. My first taste of this brewery, and I like it."
"O - Overall I think it's a better than average beer, but probably will not grab my attention again...but I can be easily persuaded."
"O- Really great beer. I dont drink belgians too often but this really is an awesome beer to relax with on any evening, any time of year."
"Poured into a stem glass, a dark cola brown with just under a finger of a well-retaining tan head. (Teresa's mistakenly labeled this as a stout on their menu; both my wife and I suspected that it was more of a dark ale than a stout, and looking it up, it appears that we were right. Skills?) Aroma was roasty and chocolaty, and definitely bore a semblance to a stout, but lighter with much more dried fruit in the nose. Taste and mouthfeel was definitely lighter than a stout, but right on for a strong dark ale. Rich dark chocolate dominates, raisins, prunes, plums, licorice, with notes of yeast and a bit of alcohol warmth. On the heavier side of medium-bodied, and quite nice to drink."
"Drinkability is good, alcohol is not very noticeable. Interesting and tasty beer."
"Smell is outstandingly nice, I can not describe the smell but it is pleasant. Light cocolate and coffeenotes. Alcohol is well hidden...."
"O: not a bad beer. However, more like a Porter or Stout than a Belgian Strong Dark Ale"
"M - Medium body with a good chew. Light to moderate carbonation."
"O: This was a very underwhelming brew. It had some interesting characteristics, but overall it was just too dry and lightly flavored, and the yeasty malt is so overpowering that it covers up the delicious chocolate and coffee notes that reside just below the surface. It has the potential for greatness, but gets muddled down by an unbalanced flavor. For $5 a bottle (33cl), I don't think I'll ever be getting this again."
"O - Very glad to have tried this one. Would easily recommend this to a stout drinker. Probably the most layered belgian dark I can recall."
"O: A good beer. Not great, but definitely worth drinking. I don't really know what is considered a ""mild stout"" but this didn't seem anything like a stout to me. It was drinkable, though, and the flavor complemented rather than hid the alcohol. Interesting beer."
"Pours a deep brown with garnet highlights when held to light, huge khaki head shows great staying power and sticks itself all over the glass. The label calls this a mild stout, its listed here as a Belgian Strong Dark, I'm not sure how to rate this but here goes. Smells of light chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and spicy Belgian phenols. Taste is rich with brown sugar and light chocolate with the Belgian spice cutting through the sweetness. Mild dark fruits are muted behind the other overpowering flavors. A hint of alcohol shows itself near the end of each sip but is soon overwhelmed. Finishes with a bit of lingering chocolate and a hint of ash. Crispy spirited level of carbonation, medium to full body, bubbly sweet sticky mouthfeel. I think there is more Belgian strong here than Stout. The roasted flavors are barely evident and the sugary sweetness lends itself more to that style. Overall this is a decent brew, but probably not something I would seek out again."
"Wow. Double checking to make sure I have the right beer here. This was supposedly purchased at Four Firkins and I doubt improper conditions are to blame for this violation of my senses. Not a good experience for me. In fact, worst beer of 2011."
"Poured into a Golden Draak tulip glass. Nice dark amber/brownish color with a slightly tan head. The carbonation is high. The lacing is there, but not a good sticky mess with some other belgian darks. Notes of candi sugar, roasted figs, whole wheat toast are in the aroma. The flavor is roasted vanilla beans with a bit of pepperiness. The taste is close to Golden Draak, but with with a roasted compound. The body is a little thin for the style. I will have to revisit this one again and get another take."
"Notes: Not necessarily what is expected lately within the bracket of Belgium Stouts, this is a different twist, leaning more on the roasted and sweet notes. A slight disconnect seems present between nose and flavor but overall this is well worth the try and rather tasty if one does not mind the predominantly sugary experience woven with the other characteristics."
"O - I wouldn't want to have this one again. It's far too metallic in nature. Nuances of Belgian yeast are lost to the disgusting and off-putting metallic mouthfeel and flavor. Drain-pour."
"Overall: I think this is a pretty good beer every and a while and a nice change of pace from the stouts that I usually drink. I would probably recommend this as more of a fall beer than anything else."
"This beer poured nice and dark with a few centimeter head which drizzled to a few millimeters before I finished it. As the label described it was chocolate malt goodness but also had a milky sweetness to it. A little bitter at times but overall I'd drink this beer a plenty - one of the better stouts I've had in the last few months. Still not sure where the ""mild stout"" came into play but I'll take 'em mild if they are like this one."
"O: Not sure if it's a bad bottle but this was not good."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, age has made this super smooth. Not too bad."
"Pours a clouded brown with a fine even speckled lacing forms down the sides of my Chimay chalice. Hints of cherry and Belgian spice, go well with mild dark chocolate creaminess. Flavor fulled with tart fruit cherries/raisins, and hints of creamy chocolate. Mouthfeel medium bodied creaminess, fine effervescent definitely a mild Belgian stout compared to bigger brasher American counterparts. Drinkability overall is very good, not the best or worst Belgian around one of thos beers that I'm glad I could buy a reasonable priced single around 4 bucks for a year old bottle. Good deal with some age on it aleady from 6/10/10."
"D- Strange for the style, but definitely tasty."
"At the Lion's Pride, nad this in a Troubadour tulip. Pours a jet black with nice three finger head that dissapates slowly. I agree with others this is difficult to classify. Aromas of dry hopping, cocoa, biscuit and a slight funk/sour component. Tastes like a combination of a double brown, quad, and dry hopped stout. Not too boozy at 8.2%, not too sweet, short dry finish makes this very drinkable. Good."
"Obscura is an interesting experiment that doesn't result in a great beer. That's OK. It was worth a shot. I don't see myself buying this again, but I can also see some people really digging this beer's unique flavor profile."
"Taste is quite interesting and I agree with the server that it's like an amber ale was blended with a stout, it has medium carbonation but on the high side for a straight stout but this is a more unique representation, roasted caramel malt with a slight chocolate aftertaste, strength is well hidden and is highly drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"M/D: full-bodied and highly carbonated -- a rare combination. Works better than I'd expect on paper, but I still prefer creaminess. Average drinking here."
"D - Moderate. Nice taste but the burnt flavors wear you down over time."
"D - Great look and aroma, but the taste couldn't match it. It was not bad, just a little weak/muted for the style."
"Overall- Mild Stout? This is really just your typical belgian dark ale. Not bad, but the dominating raison flavor become a little to much for me, finished the bottle, no problem, but I dont see myself revisiting this one."
"Pours dark mahogany with a thick light tan head and some nice streaky lacing. Great retention. The nose is slightly roasty with some mild Belgian character to it. There are some dark fruits in there as well. The taste is roasty with a bit of oxidation and cardboard. Really dry and almost harsh finish. Medium body. Pretty good though it does not really stand out anywhere, and there are a few issues with the flavor."
"D- A very tasty beer that I think may even be a shade better than their blonde."
"The bottle refers to the beer as ""mild stout"" and the listing here is ""Belgian Strong Dark Ale."" A rather unusual beer that, quite frankly, I don't know what style category really fits. Pours a surprisingly murky black with tan highlights and a uniformly dispersed yeast sediment. Predominant flavor is sweet caramel malt - almost barleywine-ish in flavor, without as much sweetness or any hops bittering. Some Belgian candy sugar and yeast flavors. Not a stout as I would consider it, but enjoyable."
"11.2 ounce bottle with 21/04/12 printed on the bottle cap. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is dark fruit, toffee, molasses, chocolate and roasted malt, it's a very sweet and malty smelling brew. I think the taste is mostly like the aroma, but it's a bit stronger and has the addition of some sweet spice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with high carbonation (too much carbonation for me). Drinkability is decent, it's certainly not hard to drink at all. Not a bad brew at all, I'd buy this again."
"Excellently crafted beer that deserves a little bit more recognition than it gets - I'm curious to try their other offerings based on this."
"It tastes like a poor mix of rauchbier and Belgian dark ale. The individual notes are nice, but the mix is not. There's some jerky, dates, a slight sweetness, spicy, minerals...kind of enjoyable, but messy. The smooth feel of the liquid and its medium-hevay mouthfeel bring hope, as does a dark chocolate aftertaste. Still, that's not enough to rescue this beer. Não mais!"
"Pretty interesting...not sure what category this falls into, but it is drinkable nonetheless."
"The Taste of this is really interesting. Very sweet up front with lots of chocolate and roasted malts. Very creamy mouthfeel. Lots of Chocolate and coffee notes come through in this. a bit of alcohol comes through at the end. I like this beer more with each sip. A very different stout to say the least. Interesting and complex, but perhaps just a tad too sweet for my taste."
"Definitely not a Stout in the traditional sense, but the Belgians are great at putting their own unique twist on things. It's a bit sweeter than expected, but complex and easy on the palate. A good pick, and worth checking out for a completely different kind of Stout."
"D - Great example of style"
"D: The beer was very easy to drink because the alcohol was well hidden."
"D - A sipper, not a bad drinker, but definately not easy."
"D- An interesting beer. The alcohol is hidden fairly well and in combination with the creamy carbonation aspect, this drinks rather nicely."
"D - I had no idea what to expect from a Belgian ""Mild Stout", but this beer is excellent. It is a kinder, gentler imperial stout that is just delicious."
"I'm very willing to be more patient with this brewery, to see if they develope this brew even more in the upcoming years."
"Esters and alcohol sweet berries are present in the nose but also a powerful touch of coffee, caramel and mocha extremely pleasant. The taste is spicy but spicy but it is also sweet and caramelized, this a very good way. A finish a little bitter but with a persistent spicy on the tongue, plus a coffee liqueur reminiscent of an Italian espresso. Lots of flavors in the nose and mouth."
"D - one or two is okay, but I do not think that more than that would work."
"M, D- Creamy & soft edged, medium-heavy weight, and quite drinkable with the ABV unapparent. The CO2 was making for well-integrated drinking for such a gusher."
"T-"
"Overall, different, and worth a try."
"D: This is very good and I'd certainly seek it out again. I'm a bit puzzled by the stout label, as it's not normally what I'd expect from a stout. Lots of flavor, would go well with a hearty stew, or by itself on pleasant outdoor evening on the patio."
"d - very enjoyable i loved it and would recommend it to any none dark beer drinker as a nice starting point"
"Picked up a single from Abe's Cold Beer for $4 and poured it into a tumbler. It opens with a big raisin aroma. The flavor follows the dried fruit character with bready cocoa notes that remind me of an English brown ale. Oddly enough, this beer seems a lot like an imperial English brown ale, if such a thing existed. The body is relatively drinkable and there's a mix of dark barley flavors with complimentary fruit. Overall, a well-made and interesting Beglian."
"D: This beer is very drinkable. It is unbelievably smooth and I've never tasted a beer like it. It keeps me coming back drink after drink."
"D: Overall this beer seems like an almost perfect mix of a great Belgian Strong Dark Ale and a nice British stout. Could be a bit more tart, could have a bit more complexity, but overall, very nice."
"Drinkability was good for an 8.50 ABV, flavor was up there, but it was a bit pricey for a go to beer."
"Tart, bitter, but also somewhat creamy in texture, Obscura indeed lives up to its name. It's a highly unusual stout, one of the most unique I've ever had. It isn't one that's easy to belt back by any means, but it's overall quite good and challenging. Fine stuff."
"Note - flavor and aroma is much more pronounced as it warms. Alcohol is still well blended into the beer."
"Hv"
"Future outlook: I feel fairly confident that I got an ""off"" bottle, and I might give this another shot if it strikes my fancy."
"Decent but quite a bit more syrupy sweet than I prefer."
"Drinks very solid for a beer of such strength. Not often do I come across a belgian stout but this mild stout was fantastic."
"Beer tastes good, sweet and vanilla with a nice mild roast flavor at the end. Beer is silky smooth and has notes of caramel in the aroma and in the forward mouth, burnt sugar or roasted brown sugar. This beer tastes a lot darker than it is. Drinkability is high and mouthfeel is good."
"Thirsty Monk in Asheville. Cloudy dark brown pour with a good sized light tan head. Taste was sweet, malt, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, but kept in check with the roast nut, bitter fruit and carbonation. There is a little caramel and chocolate then just slight coffee hints in the finish. Interesting beer, worth trying if you can."
"Pours a dark brown with a one finger tan head with good retention and heavy patchy lacing. Lots of sweet malt aromas with cherry, raisin, and tobacco. Very complex tasting beer, alcohol, sour cherry, bitter lemon rind, roasted/smokey chocolate, grapes, and some wood. Medium carbonation, medium body smooth and easy drinking."
"Heavy malts set the tone for a lot of sweetness that dominates the glass. Dark and dried fruits of blackberries, raisons, dates, figs, plumbs, grapes, and currants. Light spice and tartness helps to balance out the residual sugar blast. Alcohols late also thin the beer to make it more drinkable. However up front, the beer is heavy, doughy, and sticky sweet. Light toasty notes get swamped and give an almost Sweet Stout taste and texture. Full, rich, and silky at times this beer would be very nice if it were not for the syrupy flavor and feel."
"mouthfeel was good, but the last sip had some head and it was awsome. drinkability was excellent. I got a deal on this beer In Mt. Brook Alabama. I found the beer on top of the beer fridge near the back. they gave it to me for 10.79 I would love to know what the reg price of this beer is?"
"Pours a five finger dark cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy brown color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet caramel nose. Flavor is sweet caramel and molasses. I like the brewer's idea of a light brown. Label has the ABV at 8.2%. $4.29 for a 330ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, good representation of the Belgian Strong Dark style, this is a nice brown Belgian ale with some substance and strength making it worth drinking for a while."
"Great beer, my first ""mild stout""."
"cheers to another."
"D - Not bad. Would recommend less saaz and patent in the brew. Drinks more like a belgian stout than a strong dark ale."
"From bottle into tulip glass. Pours veiled dark caramel with a light, creamy head. Cherries and quince on the nose with some carmel and fig notes underneath. Mouthfeel is heavy at first but with some surprising carbonation, giving the beer an uncommon crispness at the finish. Toffee and honey flavors dominate but with some tartness coming in midway to balance out the sweetness. A bit of chickory at the finish with the slightest amount of alcohol bitterness. This review is based on a fresh bottle, but we've experienced added complexity in a three-year-old bottle at Oud Arsenal in Antwerp and are looking forward to seeing how this develops in the cellar."
"It smells like molasses, very rich. It tastes sweet, brown sugar, very rich just as mentioned in the smell. Mouthfeel is a tad bit tart in addition to everything else going on that I mentioned earlier in this review. Drinkability is average. All in all, this beer is worth your time at least on a couple occasions."
"11.2 bottle. Pours almost black with a medium density tan head that soon dissipates. Smells of cherries, soft malt, leather, and a hint of hops. Taste backs the smell. Dark cherries with just a hint of roast, oak, tannins, and a little carob in the finish. Mouthfeel is soft, buttery, and just the right carbonation. Very drinkable, with no hint of the abv and a flavor that is somehow satisfying and thirst-inducing all at once. It's the perpetual motion machine of beers. And again. And again. And again."
"D - Pretty smooth and easy drinking for 8.5%."
"A very interesting offering - worth a try by far."
"A unique beer worth trying, no matter your tastes."
"Quite spritzy--lots of carbonation which is balanced by the oily thick body. The flavor profile has raisin, toffee and alcohol. Nice bitter finish that seems to be a pleasant blend of hop and black patent. As it says on the bottle, this is a mild stout, but it retains its Belgian heritage."
"D) I enjoyed this beer. I enjoy the style and will add more to my collection"
"Pours a murky dark brown with a firm beige head. The aroma is medium sweet with chocolate and coffee as well as some earthy hops. The flavor is roasted and malty with coffee, chocolate caramel and raisins. More bitter toward the finish. I must admit, Belgian Stouts have been growing on me lately."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. It's solid and well made."
"In any case this is a complex interesting beer, just don't let the name fool you!"
"The flavor is generally sweet chocolate and brown sugar with a little bit of doughy yeast. The finish is a little dry and roasty actually, but also just a hint of an off metallic flavor way in the background. Overall the beer is tasty, but I wonder about geyser beers and their status. I'd like to try this one again methinks."
"D: Great for sipping. It's complex enough to be Belgian, yet has an overall English quality to it. Excellent balance of the two."
"drinkability: good"
"d- like I said, the flavors are strong but don't present themselves well at all. I got tired of the taste and heavy body of this beer, so I couldn't see myself having another or buying this ever again."
"6/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"Probably too old a bottle, but there are too many beers out there to try this again. No thanks."
"Pours dark brown with red highlights and a short off-white head. Aroma was soap, funky yeast, marshmallows, prunes, and cocoa. Taste was much better. Rich chocolate, mocha, coffee, and toasty malt. It rapidly turns to cherries, yeast, and caramel/spun sugar/too sweet raisins. Interesting Belgian take on a stout."
"This Belgian Stout I split with my friend John, while sleeping on his couch because my GF had kicked me out of the house. If it seems like a did a lot of reviews while in that painful relationship, it's because I did. Out of the bottle the beer was a cloudy dark mahogany color. Huge three finger head of mocha-like foam that retained beautifully and left curtains of sticky lacing on our glasses. The aroma was clearly Belgian, complex fruity esters, roasted malt and coffee. The flavor profile was similar, starting sweet with chocolate then going into the fruit and tangy yeast before swinging to the bitter end for an acidic, coffee finish. Complex and distinctly European. I prefer American stouts personally but if you dig the over the pond kind you must try it."
"Very solid brew."
"A good beer, but not great."
"I've had several Belgian stouts now, and I have strongly disappointed by each one. Clearly, not my style."
"Drinkability is great! Tons of flavor, smooth going down and always leaves you craving the next sip."
"Troubadour Obscura's a very impressive beer. I didn't quite know what to expect from this one. Color me very surprised and impressed. It's packed full of flavor and is very complex. Yet, it's an approachable and very drinkable beer. I think it could stand a little more body and a little work on the nose. But, it's a very good beer nonetheless. Definitely one to check out."
"Highly drinkable, very enjoyable."
"D-This is not a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It lacks the spice character, and even the bottle says ""mild stout."" Also, the abv is incorrect (8.2% on bottle). The alcohol is somewhat masked...you can tell it's strong, but it goes down very smoothly."
"Just a bit too sweet for a session brew but still a great beer from Belgium."
"D: Very impressed."
"Poured into chalice. Nice thick off-white head, rich mahogany in color and good retention and lacing...a very nice looking beer. Smell complex with notes of sweet milk chocolate, some alcohol, caramel, and dark fruits. As it warmed it almost took on a red wine like smell. Taste was good but a little too boozy for me. Some chocolate, dark fruits (cherries or grapes it seemed like), a bit of coffee and a little too much alcohol. I also notice a slight metallic taste to it. The mouthfeel was thick and smooth, very warming as it goes down. Overall a great beer. I dont know if the metallic taste was just a bad bottle or not, but even with that, it proved to be a solid Belgian."
"Drinkability is solid here. I believe after some aging, this will develop more of a stout character. Similar to Allagash Black but with more polish. The carbonation isn't desirable to me but otherwise, it's a nice Belgian take on a stout."
"D - This is good for a mild stout. I love stouts, they are my favorite style but I am not a fan of this mild style stout."
"Another fun belgian stout. Pretty thin mouthfeel. I really like the drinkablilty of these beers despite the higher abv. They hide them fairly well and this one was very refreshing. I think I drank it in about minutes!"
"A dark ruby red with a one finger off white head on a semi aggressive pour. Smell is belgian yeasts, sweet, tangy, some sweet rich malts in the back. Taste is a little smokey on the back, sweet malts up front. Low carbonation, slick on the tongue, a pretty easy drink."
"Troubadour Blond Ale is good stuff. Troubadour Obscura Mild Stout is even better. I saw 4-packs up in Madison several days ago (new label) and didn't buy one. Now that I've tasted what this exceptional ale has to offer, I won't make that mistake again."
"This is fantastic, I could sip it all night."
"Worth a shot..."
"The more I try this style, the more I like it's uniqueness."
"This is a great breakfast or dessert beer. I enjoyed this completly and will purse more of this."
"D - Fantastic. Worth seeking out, will definitely enjoy again if I ever find it again."
"Drinkability- goes down smooth, great drinking beer, 8.5% is hidden very well"
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours cloudy dark brown color with an average head that dissipated into a sparse cap. The smell is of dark fruit, figs, candi sugar and hints of milk chocolate. The taste is definitely of stout. Big roasted malt and dark bitter chocolate. The Belgian spice and sweetness are subdued by the roasted malt. The feel is moderate, with active carbonation, and finishes bitter from the malt. The characteristics of a stout stand out in this brew. As it warms you can start to detect some of the spice and other Belgian characteristics. A good overall beer, very solid."
"This is a great brew. Not exactly what I expected, but I enjoyed it and will certainly be trying it again."
"The mouthfeel was somewhat carbonated."
"Drinkability- Probably not that close to style, but I find this to be one of the most pleasurable Belgian darks I've had."
"Overall: An intriguing combination of flavors in a rather light bodied example of the style"
"Nothing outstanding about this brew, but technically flawless nonetheless and a fantastic ale on a cold January New York evening."
"Pours a very dark ruby brown. No head. Nose is mild malts. Flavor is smooth, but with a slight popping edge to it. Mild malts mixed with yeasts. Firm sweetness. I have had this on the bottle before and still stand by what my memory serves about my previous review. This is like a mild stout mixed with a dark belgian ale. Feel is nice and smooth on the liquid and with a great amount of bubble on the tongue. Highly drinkable. Easily sessionable. Smooth and so well crafted."
"As for the flavor, oh my! I was utterly unprepared for the bitter onslaught of coffee & chocolate. Raisins and dark rum puckered the sides of the mouth while a peppery spice and a solid, warming alcohol note washed over the entire palate. The body was of medium consistency, slightly overcarbonaed, and finished a bit chalky down the gullet. Troubadour's ""Mild Stout"" wasn't mild at all; rather, its intricate aroma, flavor, and bitterness made for an interesting brew that I would certainly go after again."
"Overall a tasty stout. Very unique."
"Pours a rich dark brown color with a creamy, milky one inch head in a tulip glass. Smell is similar to a belgian more so than a stout. Lots of sugary, yeasty, and dried fruit tones. Taste is coffee and chocolate at first followed by some dry fruit sweetness. Mouthfeeling is nice and creamy as well."
"Not a stout by any stretch of the imagination. Dark murky brown. Nose of fruit, malts, and sugar. Tasted like one of, or a combination of a) a Belgian dubbel. b) an aged and oxidized American Barleywine. c) a limp weizenbock. So not impressed. I did not finish it, and had the bartender take it back. It wasn't bad, but I am judging it according to its professed style. If a friend had home-brewed this as a Belgian dubbel, then I would have been impressed."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Chocolate and coffee in the forefront. Very roasty but with an underlying fruity character that isn't common amongst stouts. Has a subtle tartness that is also present in De Dolle's Extra Export Stout. Creamy on the tongue, it's quite thick and chewy. Extremely smooth with no hint of alcohol. Pretty unique stuff, and very good."
"4.5/4/4/4.5/4"
"Pours black with amber hints and a tan head. Aroma of a Belgiany sweet roasted malt. In the taste, a sweet roasty malt. A smooth, big body mouthfeel and a sweet malty aftertaste.Nice and smooth, nice body. More porter-ish than a stout, but still tasty and quite different."
"This beer is very easy to drink, although I don't know if I could have more than one at a time. Certainly worth a try, if for no other reason than it is quite a unique brew."
"Mild stout, huh? I'm not sure I can get my arms around that, but it is a very stately, complex, and blended Belgian, with plenty of guts and finesses, each in turn. It stood up to and wonderfully complimented a fine Italian blue cheese, Blu del Moncenisio. Even as a standalone, it is utterly enjoyable, if at times a bit too big for its own good, maybe blurring some edges in spots. The ABV is spookily disguised, lurking and waiting for one's foolish over-indulgence. And yet, it goes down well, clean in the end, and refreshing, especially with the right gustatorial pairing. So call it what you will, it's a pleasure."
"Mouth is creamy and thick. Drinkability is better than I thought and will try this one again."
"Very drinkable brew, most enjoyable."
"Overall very nice, a good Belgian to keep in the cellar, or to enjoy whenever you want a BSDA with more character."
"Pors a deep ruby red color, nearly black until held in the light. Topped off with a tall, frothy head of light tan foam that leaves streaks of lacing in the tulip glass. The nose is of roasted malt, mollasses, raisins, and dates. Very warm and very rich. The palate reminds me in some small way of Achel Brune, but slightly more biting. This is a Belgian strong dark ale, not a stout, at least in the traditional sense of the word. Dark roasted malt, figs, raisins, and more black-strap mollasses in the palate. The 8.5% alcohol is quite well hidden, but does provide a nice warm finish. Speaking of finish, this ale is not cloying but does have a lingering sweetness. Aggressively carbonated, it leaves fairly clean and dry however. Thich in the mouth, but alive with carbonation. This is an intriguing beer. Very rich and complex - a pleasant Belgian strong dark ale in every respect, I'd say. If I had another bottle, I'd want to cellar it for a year or two and see how the flavors and mouthfeel round out. Still, very nice as it is now."
"Can't exactly say drinking this beer is a chore, in fact it is quite good. Definitely one of those freestyle Belgian Ales that succeeds. The Brew-master has taken ideas from many different beer styles and countries and melded them into something of a Belgian take on the sweet stout but it tastes more like a Wee Heavy to me. Recommended for those who don't care too much about definitions and strict interpretations of beer styles."
"D - A very enjoyable Strong Dark Ale that hides it alcohol well. Definitely worth a try if you can find it."
"D-Unique effort here....not sure if this is a stout or a Belgian Strong Ale...tastes like a blend...worth trying for the sake of trying something a little different. One is enough for me though..."
"This beer is so easy to drink, you could hurt yourself if you weren't careful. I'll definitely be ordering this one again, and next time it won't be by accident."
"Final Note: this is a beer to savor and enjoylet your taste buds experience every ounce of flavor."
"D: Pretty drinkable, besides the strong alcohol flavor, but hey this is beer. I would definitely try again next winter."
"YUM, I say again. Dessert beer for sure."
"I had this at Roman's Pub in Milwaukee, served (as always) in appropriate glassware (a Unibroue tulip if I remember correctly). Appearance was black with some red ""legs"" as the light shone through it."
"D- This beer has a nice dark malt flavor and some nice wild yeast characteristics. This is a creative beer that shows fusion done right can really make a good beer."
"drinkability is good. i really enjoyed this combination. the high carbonation is the biggest flaw to me, and even that isn't too bad. a great marriage of stout and belgian. just give it a good swirl to loose some carbonation and it's great."
"Not what it was presented as, but a good beer nonethless."
"foist off, don't know the status of this brewery. Bodega used to get troubadour amber with the other label of the ""happy guy"". Anyway - this was served with a light head and some lace. Mahogany color. very aromatic malty character. Flavor's the same, but more intense. a little booziness. and an odd bit of peatiness, like a misplaced scotch ale. delicious."
"boozyness in the mix. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a stout, but dry. Not bad at all."
"Delicious and refreshing, and absolutely no sign of alcohol or high gravity. Sweet and sticky, yet not thick or viscous. Milk chocolate, malt, carmel, Rolos®. Great light mouthfeel, perfect gentle carbonation, subtle spring water backbone. Great drinking. It's absolutely delicious, and perhaps the most un-intimidating stout to convert your fellow beer drinkers. Cheers!"
"This is easily one of my favorite Belgian strong darks. I'd absolutely love to see this in the states."
"Highly recommended. This, folks, is tasty! Put it this way - I've had quite a few brews, so it takes something special for me to really notice it - I noticed this one!"
"Drinkability- Flavors meld excellent together. Very well rounded per style and in every category. Wonderful stout that I highly recommend."
"Overall: A tasty Belgian style ale that gets lost in the shuffle amongst the greats. Worthy of me drinking again for sure. Recommended."
"Im not a very good label reader ... I had not idea this was a stout! Anyway, it poured a dark chocolate thinge with a poofy head. The aroma is much stronger than a ""mild stout"" thats for sure ... stiffly alcoholic. Likewise, as I sip on this, while this is an enjoyable brew, its a strong one, and would take the weekend stoutie by surprise. Strong bitter dark cherry, alcohol, dark plum and an obscenely sweet twist at the end. (#2739, 3/7/2007)"
"The bottle cap of this bottle indicates that it is best before 8/23/08 and was consumed on 2/25/07. I poured it into a Chimay glass. The head falls quickly on this beer and leaves just the dark brown body. The center of the beer blocks light, but a large amount (for a stout) does get through at the edges exposing a lighter brown hue. The aroma is more typical of a dark belgian beer than a mild stout as it is labeled. It has a pretty strong malty presence, but there is some roasted aroma in there as well. There is also a weird smell in there that reminds me of green or purple olives, but it is pretty faint. The first thing I notice as I taste it is the creaminess. It is the typical creaminess that I find in dark belgians. The primary flavor is the roasted malt, and it is good for a stout. This is an excellent combination of a dark belgian and a stout."
"The beer just does not do it for me, it tastes a bit too much like fermented prune juice to really be all that palatable. It never reaches horrible, and I could easily drink this if politeness demanded it. Fortunately it does not, so I will not."
"A great beer which looks like Westmalle Dubbel, but then even better."
"Drinkability - An exciting stout. The apple notes really balance with the bitter chocolate to make this incredibly drinkable and distinct. I definitely plan on getting more of these."
"The body is fairly light and dry on the palate. A bit peppery. Carbonation is mild, providing a slightly creamy mouthfeel. This is a good, interesting, and unique brew for sure. It tastes like a stout, but it is distinctly belgian as well. Just not clean enough to be too drinkable, and it seems to be all over the board. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this, however."
"Drinkability: Balanced!"
"Cheers!"
"I was curious about a Belgian stout..and this one did not disappoint. I could see this as a ""breakfast beer"" with a nice brunch. But it will pack a punch with 8.5% alcohol. I liked it and will get more. And drink them one at a time."
"Drinkability: Worth a shot, it's a a great combination of two great styles."
"Pours very dark brown with half an inch of tan head that disappears quickly, leaving thin lace. Toasted coffee and powdered chocolate malts in the nose, with an undercurrent of dark fruit (plums, raisins). Simple yet satisfying flavor. Chewy grains up front. Develops nice toasted bread and powdered cocoa in the center. A touch of drying hops and warming fruity alcohol in the aftertaste. Alcohol is well integrated overall. Medium to heavy in the mouth; balanced more towards carbonation than creaminess. Satisfying, though not particularly easy-drinking due to the strength and body."
"What an interesting beer. Disguises its high alcohol content completely. Very smooth-drinking, medium-bodied beer, with a great deal of subtley. Has some of the rich malty stout taste, with hints of chocolate, but ends up being dominated by the spicy Belgian dark ale taste, with some hints of prune or plum. Seems like an effective blending of the two styles. Very much worth returning to."
"Pours a beautiful deep ruddy brown, with a nice sitting (and lasting) tan head atop. Aroma is of hot chocolate powder and slight roastiness Semi-sweet. Flavor follows through, but is much less sweet. Dark heavy fruits (cherries, plums, a bit of apricot) remind me that this isn't really a stout, but is a Belgian Dark Ale. The body is rich and filling, with more carbonation than expected for a stout-BSDA. A very tasty brew, not in the class of some of the best BSDA around, but very tasty indeed."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting on 8/16/06: Dark reddish-brown color with a thin and creamy off-white head. Minimal lacing. Mild malt and caramel aroma. Medium-bodied with a roasty character. Malt, dark fruit and chocolate flavors are present. The finish is tart fruit at first, then sweeter fruit and malt. Above average."
"This is either a wonderful stout or a wonderful belguim dark ale...I can't decide."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Best before 09/02/09 on cap."
"D: Surprised this beer doesn't get better ratings than it does. I find it quite amusing and really like it when Belgian beers keep with their roots but stray to other styles outside their borders."
"While not knocking my socks off, this is a pleasant tasting Belgian ale that wont disappoint unless youre looking first and foremost for a stout. It goes down easily enough, giving little notice of its 8.5% abv. The price will probably not have me returning to this anytime soon, however, as there are enough dark Belgians around that are cheaper and just as good, if not better. Certainly, the St. Bernardus Abt 12 I bought at the same place for a slightly cheaper price has no fear of being passed over next time in favor of this beer."
"Mouth: The first thing I notice is the strong carbonation, hitting the front of the mouth and continuing all the way through. The beer tastes predominantly of malts, starting smooth and finishing even stronger. It carries a touch of sourness that I normally don't like in my dark beers, but this one was not harsh enough to scare me away, and actually added some character. Some black pepper taste and a warm alcohol exhale."
"Picked up a mini-growler and an 11.2 ounce bottle (best before dating of 23/08/08 on the cap)of this brew @ Half time this afternoon. Both versions pour a nice warm dark almond shade of amber, the bottled version seems to be much more highly carbonated. Dark tan head, better retention on the bottled sample and similar spotty lacing left behind.Similar nose of sweet caramel, and malted sweet milk, more prevelant in the growler sample. Srong, flavorful brew, notes of brandy, malted chocolate milk, caramel, bitter dark chocolate and some vanilla. I preferred the growler version, smoother, lower carbonation, give this a try if you like dark, strong Belgians. Nice night cap kind of brew or perhaps give it a try with a chocolate dessert."
"33 cl bottle, crown stamping dated 23 Aug 08. Pours a muddy dark brown with port wine colored highlights. Fizzy, topped light khaki head. Suggestions of cocoa and biscuit drizzled with chocolate. Faint yeasty notes complicate the aroma. I always like running across these Belgian ""stouts", they always amaze me how the brewers can capture glimpses at UK's best stouts whilst maintaining most of their quinessential Belgian style. The first couple of sips were the best, with the most pronounced stout character lingering through. Afterward, the beer drifted towards a more typical dark Belgian strong ale- some sherry, some dark roasted candi sugar and malt, and light chalkdust yeastiness. A bit more woody than I expected. Almost like it was a mad experiment of aging a Belgian dark ale in some old London Porter cask. Creamy, tasty, lightly astringent and strong."
"Nice little find at a nice little Santa Monica store."
"Wow was this ever a treat. It looked like chocolate pudding with a half inch of dense head that could've been whipped cream. The nose was dark berries and a spicy sweetness. The first sip, and all that follow are thick and creamy, with the taste dominated by very mild plums, and trailed by seductive roastiness. Anyone who enjoys either stouts or the darker belgian ales will probably enjoy this. Anyone who likes both will be thrilled! Each sip was sheer delight!"
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer, but if I was craving a stout, this would not do it for me."
"I really enjoyed this stout and without a doubt will have another one."
"Aroma is deeply fruity with cherry, apple and pear sticking out. Ample candied fruit notes as well. Cloudy red/brown with a typically large and fluffy Belgian style head. For is fruity with candy sugar and yeast also getting equal play. This tastes much more like a dubbel and even less like a Stout than Hercule. If there are chocolate malts in here they are lost int he sweetness and alcohol which is more assertive than Id expect from an 8% brew. Still this does taste and feel good and while it isnt my idea of a stout it is my idea of a good beer."
"Overall: I like the bitter-sweet profile in this Mild Stout. Not sure it has enough differentiation to be listed as a Stout though. Interesting stuff and well worth trying."
"Bottle: Poured a black color ale with a huge foamy dirty brown head with pretty good retention. Aroma of sweet malt with distinctive Belgian yeast note. Some sweet malt with a slightly bitter and coffee finish also dominates taste. More reminiscent of a Belgian dark ale then a stout but interesting nonetheless. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden."
"D: nearly full-flavoured, it's not a terribly complex brew but shows a very clear and balanced structure for a strong dark beer, without sharp alcohol intervention anywhere throughout the drink~~ A beautiful, mellow dark beer to savour as digestif!"
"Highly drinkable. Glad I found it. The more common blonde is one of my regular beers."
"Nose is huge amounts of malts ranging from roast to to caramel but still being fresh, probably because of the good amount of yeastester. Taste is very burnt, bitter, roasted and smoky. This bitterness and roast make it not the most easy to drink beer but hey; great brew!"
"Overall Impression: A Proefbrouwerij ""test"" success! Rich and dark brew that really hits the spot. Fantastic complexity. Very enjoyable. Lots of flavor/aroma points that are hard to hone in on."
