"Taste is very peaty, toasty. Dry, but not sour. Flat mouthfeel (again, possibly from defective capping, rather than intentional). Strange but tasty enough."
""

"Overall: Very impressed. Don't know if the port characteristics would have continued to develop if aged another two years, but it hardly matters."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is fantastic. The label states good for 5 years, and this is almost 6, but very enjoyable."
""
"O: Not a bad FES. Age has mellowed and smooth it out but it still has a prominent and sharp char character. Can't imagine how strong it was 3 years ago. Alcohol is completely hidden, drinks like a 6-7% porter not a 10% stout. Nice drinkability as a result. Good beer, lacking a bit in complexity but I enjoyed it."

"The best I have had from the DeMolen brewery."
"A great looking stout; great roasted scents. I was somewhat surprised at the relative lightness to the body. The rich, dark malted character dominates the initial taste, giving away to a nice hop bitterness (and, perhaps, grain huskiness or tannin note) and a faint hint at the relatively high ABV."

"O - A decent Export Stout (of some sort) but not something I'd really go after again. I didn't hate this beer, but I also didn't think it was good enough to order again or seek out a bottle of."
""
""
""
"O - I would like to try another bottle to see if the taste is the same. However as it stands it is a pass."
"Picked this up at the Brouwerij De Molen beer store. Dark brown, almost black pour that turned into a total gusher when I opened it. Had this happen in the past with De Molen beers so I was somewhat prepared and saved most of it. For all that foam and head, it didn't last long at all and had minimal lacing. Huge roasty nose with a ton of coffee along with hints of cocoa, espresso, and just a touch of hops and black licorice. The taste follows suit with loads of coffee and chocolate with hints of tobacco, soy sauce, and a bit of caramel and toffee. The mouthfeel leaned more towards a Porter than a stout and was slightly fizzy. The finish was extra dry with a nice bitter hop bite. The alcohol was totally hidden making this extremely drinkable. Another great beer from De Molen!"

"The label describes this beer as a porter, but it definitely isn't. It is somewhere between a light, chocolatey quad, a Belgian stout, a Belgian Dark Strong Ale. Whatever this is, it was interesting."
"This is a laid-back beer for conversation. While there is not much to this one, it is done well and would match with a cigar. Having aged 18 months in the bottle, it has clearly mellowed out."
""

"Love the shit out of this brewery's Heaven & Hell (one of the best-ever stouts), but SSS is merely okay. It fails biggest in the Smell and Mouthfeel categories. It has redeeming elements too, but considering how transcendent H&H was, I'll be sipping on it with less enthusiasm than expected."

"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, pretty smooth and chewy on the palate. Not bad, but probably not worth the price point, and I had a hard time picking up on some of the flavors."
"Note: Bottled March 21, 2011"
"Overall: This is not a bad beer, it's just not the beer it says it is. I'm missing something or anything akin to an English porter and the carbonation really detracts from something that might better fall in the nebulous Belgian Strong Dark Ale category."
"O: One of the weirdest stouts I've ever tasted, but also one of the most memorable. If David Lynch were to go into the brewing business and create a stout, this would be the result."
"Brown pour with a big, bubbly white head. The lacing is fine retention is great. The smell is of dark fruits and roasted malts mostly. It smells a lot like a quad honestly. Really not a lot of stout characteristics. Big dark fruits, booze, roasted malts on the backend with perhaps some coffee. This tasted like a nice blend of a quad and a stout. Very interesting and enjoyable. Medium body, carbonated well. Hints of booze. I liked this. Not what I was expecting but a welcomed mix. Unlike any stout I've had before."
"Overall pretty neat tasting, quite unique, interesting angle. Rather enjoy it even though it has some odd characters."
"OVERALL: Another good De Molen brew. This is kind of a touchstone for their stout beer, as it is a tasty and aromatic beer, but would need a heavier, thicker palate to really get the flavors over the hump. A tighter head would also help the scores. That said, I enjoyed this one very much. If you’re interested in the brewery, this would be a stout to check out. If you enjoy it, then their barrel aged and smaller batch stuff would be well worth tracking down. A good beer that I’ve had before and will have again. Recommended."
"May be better fresh. Not sure I would age one the full 5 years it claims."
"Bottle #407 bottled on May 23, 2008."
"O-"
"Bottle #478: This beer was said to be a rarity when I saw it on the menu at the Bethlehem Speakeasy. I figured that I must try it then since I'm easily persuaded into things like this. The bottle was split between a friend and myself that night. The pour was nice. It gave of a deep black color with a creamy brown looking head that stuck around for a little while. The smell of the beer had some very heavy burnt aromas coming off of it. There was a booze aroma too that was also there. The taste of the bee was very dry and gave off plenty of burnt toast flavors mixed with some rich dark chocolate. The mouthfeel was lighter than I expected a ""Triple Stout"" to be... Overall I found the beer to be pretty good, I'd say if you have the money on hand give it a try but if not, you're really not missing out on too much. It was nice to try but I wouldn't have to purchase it again."
"O: Really an enjoyable beer, minus the thin/overcarbonated mouthfeel. I love lots of coffee in a beer, and this definitely delivers. I will have to grab another bottle the next time I see some. Nice beer."
"Poured into a aarge [int glass a deep dark brown with some ruby tinge when held to the light,a one finger beige head atop.Heavy roast and molasses really stood out in the nose,some alcohol sweetness crept thru as well.A creamy feel that coats the mouth.Dark fruit and dark chocolate dominate the palate,a great mix of flavors an feel to this beer,complex and flavorful.I would buy again in a heartbeat."
"Overall: Perfectly balanced traditional triple stout. Happy that I finally tried!"
"Ah yes, there we are. We served it too cold. Now I'm gathering much more complexity. The aforementioned chocolate gives a nice cocoa sweetness followed by a burnt toast flavor. Then the ash. Oh man this is an ashy beer. And the alcohol is still quite prominent. It's a bit harsh and the very light body doesn't really help IMO. It's a two dimensional beer: a couple of flavors + alcohol. Good, but not great."
"Notes: Nice historic exercise. Maybe not too exciting but what Pattinson and Menno do here is rather welcome. Quality offering and a stimulating insight into vintage brewing."
"[EDIT 07 Apr 2015] Just had a bottle (bottled May 24th 2013). I did remove some of the more trivial observations from my initial review, as well as keeping in some of the more extreme (and perhaps exaggerated) observations... Basically, this beer exhibits much of the same characteristics as their other dark beers - which is great, as I love them - however, despite it's abv and ostensibly fuller/sweeter constitution, this beer doesn't dazzle and it could very well be attributed to poor handling and/or staling oxidation. If you do happen to find a bottle, serve it at cellar temp, and go from there."
"Drinkability: I’m glad this is a 750ml bottle, because I think I would be highly disappointed if I could only have one glass of this. The sweetness is well done; it’s not overly cloying or stomach sickening, and the mouthfeel is smoother than anything I’ve had in a while. I’m stoked that I got the chance to try this, and I’m looking forward to sharing a bottle with friends sometime in the near future, as this beer is smooth enough that, in my opinion, even non-beer geeks would be able to enjoy it."
"O - This is a very tasty Foreign/Export Stout. Thanks again to drfabulous for sharing this rarity!"
"O: Surprisingly straight-forward for a De Molen beer, though not necessarily within the given style."
"D: An easy drinking FES for the ABV and some good flavors but price and slight tang would deter me from seeking this out again."
"Darn good"
"D: Rare enough style that should be made more because it's really good. Well worth a purchase. One of the better beers I've had this month."
"Notes: Lots of flavor, a serious stout. Seems like it might be a little over the hill though. Or maybe the yeast is just failing. There's something in here that reminds me of old home-brew. Tasty though I suspect it's a bit more expensive that I'd be willing to pay."
"It took a few minutes to let the bottle warm up, but as it opened it let off hints of molasses, soy, even a touch of fish sauce. It really put into perspective the term, umami that so aptly describes many of the stouts I've been tasting (especially since quitting cigarettes). Meaty, earthy, salty, deliciousness."
"D-not the most fantastic stout, lacks balance in flavor and complexity but doesn't do anything wrong. that ashy bitter coffee flavor is something I find in a lot of foreign made stouts such as mikeller and I'm not a huge fan."
"for an original recipe out of 1914 London... they were not drinking too badly back then, not bad."
"Poured a fairly dark brown with a decent amount of red highlights making its way through when held up to light. Head is super huge and frothy. The craters are impressive in this brown frothy masterpeice. Smells of dark fruit and smokey. Taste super malty and musty. Hints of dark fruit and coffee. Feel is kinda thin but nice."
"750ml bottle into my Orval glass...The beer pours light brown, settles a little dark with tons of carbonation. At least four fingers of light tan head, very good retention, but lacing is really light, as it falls hardly any sticks to the glass...The aroma and taste are on the lighter side and as I first sipped I was dreading that this was another boring English stout. Its similar as it is certainly on the lighter side in feel. However, after a couple sips the taste really comes out and is superbly balanced and easy to drink. Nict lightly roasted coffee."
"I cannot imagine a Foreign Export Stout tasting any better than this. Given the malty-dry texture, this beer was a serious pleasure to drink. Where power and complexity could have helped, I cannot overlook the simplicity and elegance of this beer. A solid choice for any dark beer lover."
"It is exceptional. Man o man, these guys can make the beer. Very similar to the Hell & Damnation but a tad thiner and has the carbonation; a little easier to like. Aroma is rich: coffee cocoa roast malt. Flavor's like aroma, extremely well balanced. Finish is like flavor, tapering and of medium to long. Session beer despite the strength. World classic."
"D: Decent but its strong and not as balanced as it should be which makes it a bit hard to drink lots of."
"Batch 2008 #194. Pours an opaque darkness with an excessive stiff light tan head that fades quickly to spotty patterns of lacing. The chalky NECCO chocolate smell seems really stale and oxidized cardboard...yuk. It tastes just like it smells...malty without sweetness the mouth feel has a tangy character. Finishes almost dry. A tough swallow..pour."
"This rare beer was the last one on the shelf thank you beer gods!! The head starts off good with decent retention. The nose is very complex with hints of soy sauce and salty taffy. The taste starts with caramelized dates and brown sugar. The next wave fades into a dry spicy English hops profile. The mouth feel is medium to full body. I rated the drinkability high for good reason that this brew is 9.9% and has no heat with a smooth well balanced finish. This stout was worth the $17. Happy new year to all..."
"D - Surprisingly nice stout with plenty of chocolate and roasted malt goodness."
"As an export stout, this one is decent, but it doesn't really hold up to the majority of impy stouts out there at the same ABV."
"the mouthfeel is nice and thick, though a little over-carbonated and the drinkability is limited to one 750ml bottle, though that is still certainly a lot."
"D: We found the drinkability to be quite high. I was expecting more of an alcohol presence but it was non-existant. The soft and creamy chocolate and oatmeal/lactose flavors & aromas made this one go down like a stout with half the abv!"
"A good stout!"
"D - an interesting look back at a historic recipe. I think I'd like a better balance before I'd want to spend another $20 on one of these."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but it wasn't my favorite DeMolen. Being an expensive one-off, I'm sure it's one and done, even if I'm glad I got to try it. I enjoyed the historical underpinning, but wish they had provided more back-story."
"D- This beer has a nice deep roasted flavor with some good depth to it. This makes a nice session beer but at 10%ABV it will be a short session. There is no need for any age on this beer it is ready to drink now."
"Drinkability is way good here but this is a rare bird and as high as the abv is I think one should watch out!"
"I don't know all that much about stouts, much less about any ""original recipes"". I do know that I enjoyed this one very much and I consider it one of the better beers from De Molen."
"Beautiful black and lace. Big malty aroma and coffee, bittersweet chocolate,carmel, Kent Golding hops in finish nice. Cocoa, some expresso, vanilla. Understated carbonation. Great drinking.Medium mouthfeel. Milk chocolate is the aftertaste.Found at State Line Liquor. Only 675 bottles in the batch."
"Almost more than the roast character, both the fruitiness and the chocolate notes play a substantial role here. A bit more balanced, even more refined than the London-style Porter, there is enough sweet malt here to stand up to the ample roast character, but I think I like the Porter better than this beer. This is still quite tasty and definitely interesting. It drinks a lot easier than its 10% would suggest."
"Dark brown/burgundy color with a long lasting light tan foam. Aroma seems a little incomplete, with yeast smells and a touch of leather. Flavor is different, but quite outstanding. Not roasty or chocolate-like at all, but loaded with dark fruit flavors, caramel, toffee, peanut brittle and then on top of all that, the finish is nearly 20 seconds. Really complex flavor profile, nearly perfect. Not an Imperial Stout, but it's not claiming to be one. It's too bad the nose isn't so great, because this beer is nearly perfect in every other way."
"Billed as the ""original 1914 recipe London triple stout by Ron Pattinson brewed by the Mill"". Certainly drinks like an export stout that is a little more bland and rough than most of the style."
