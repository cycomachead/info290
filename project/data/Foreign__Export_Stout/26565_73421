Aromas of rich dark chocolatey malt. Notes of rich toasted sugar as well. Flavor is rich dark toasted malt with characteristics of heavily roasted coffee. End note is a tad bitter from the dark malts. Medium bodied with a carbonation level a bit high that seems to bring out the lingering almost astringent aftertaste from the roasted malts. Overall a decent beer that could benefit from a little less in your face dark malt and better balance.","deebo","Dec 18, 2012"

4.1,4.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Enjoying a fresh growler from the brewery today. Poured opaque black with a small tan head that faded quickly to a persistent skein. Smell was roasted malt, coffee and chocolates. Very nice. Taste had nice roasty elements, deeply roasted malt and French roast coffee. Sweet and semi sweet chocolate. Late on the palate is a little hint of dark fruit. Lightly hopped, with a slight hop and roasty coffee bean like bitterness that leaves the finish clean, lightly bitter, and dry. Nice medium body, creamy texture. Excellent, tasty export stout.","JackieTH","Aug 06, 2012"

Tone the alcohol down a bit and I could see myself drinking this all day. A ton of complexity with a body that is sooo drinkable makes this one of a few stouts that I can see myself drinking over and over again. It doesn't have to be 11%+ alcohol in order to pack all sorts of flavor in and this is a great example.","jjanega08","Apr 13, 2012"

4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a pitch black color. The head is a half inch of tan foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing that lingers. The aroma is of roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, and more roasted malt. This is a really interesting aroma. The taste is just as roasty as the aroma with a nice lingering maltiness. Along with the roasted malt there is also some nice dark chocolate and coffee notes in the background. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate-low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good beer that I can see myself drinking a lot of. I just wish it were available in six pack form.","KarlHungus","0"
