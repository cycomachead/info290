"I'd put this beer just over ""medium"" in terms of body - a very good structure for all the flavors going on here. Almost no trace of alcohol but tons of flavor, which is always a great combination. Overall a great beer that I will seek out when I return to Charleston."

"O: Overall, not my favorite offering from COAST. Interesting though, and worth a try. I remember liking it a lot more the last time I had it (last year, poured on tap and paired with food). Id drink this again, but its not something I will run out and by another growler of."

"O - This was a delicious and very unique stout. When I heard the words “oyster stout,” I was skeptical. I thought that the oyster presence would be either non-existent or overpowering. While I do like oysters, a beer with an overpowering oyster flavor does not sound appetizing. COAST did a great job of making a good stout and adding just enough oysters to give them a subtle but noticeable presence. The body was a bit too thin, but that’s pretty much the only complaint I have about this beer. Definitely glad I picked it up."

"Coast Brewing Company brews impressive beer. I knew this would be good, but I really wasn’t expecting the oyster aspect of it to really shine through. Lo and behold…it does! Who knew? If you’re into all things stout and salt…give this one a shot! It delivers! Thanks, Dan!"

"O: another great beer from COAST, using local oysters is pretty badass and this beer shows their ability to do great things on the dark malt side of the street"
"Taste is of very roasted creamy malts mixed with some slight coffee; but here is where it gets interesting...I actually taste the oysters! It has a very very slight fishy salty sea water flavor. It sounds kind of gross, but its very well balanced and not in your face. It is full of flavor and actually has some alcohol for a stout! Nice job."
"Overall: The cask really works for this beer as all of the elements present themselves without the interruption of too much carbonation; really like the surprisingly hoppy flavors as well as the brine in the aftertaste"

"Also for you oyster lovers out there and the adventureous drinkers, caSSino and I decided to experiment on our second pints of this brew. With an empty glass we lined the bottom of the glass with Texas Pete and then poured the beer into the glass. This added a very nice spicy tabasco aspect to the brew on the followthrough only and made it quite enjoyable. We also shared tastes with others sitting at the bar and everyone really seemed to like it. Add at your own risk and based on your spice tolerance (mine is higher than most). COAST, are you listening? Get Tabasco barrels and put this beer in them. I will definitely thank you for this."
"Overall very solid and really quite nicely done. I have to admit name alone scared me off, but there was no reason for it. This was just a nicely done stout all the way around."
"Drinkability: this beer was very enjoybable from start to finish as it went down fairly quickly. I was able to have enjoy this on several evenings while in SC and was the favorite beer on my trip."
"Black body with a dark brown head resting on top. The head sticks around for a little while but eventually runs away. Smell's roasty with hints of mineral notes but nothing that screams oysters. Tastes roasty again but with a definite mineral presence, slightly sweet with hints of dark chocolate. Mouth feel is medium to heavy, very sticky in the mouth. Pretty easy drinking as the ABV would indicate. Not much about this screams oyster to me but I think it is noticeable once it is mentioned. I wish there was a place near me that I could enjoy this with some oysters. I'd buy this again. Another solid offering from COAST. Their stout's are always top notch."
"D - Very drinkable, just like every other COAST offering. I'll have no problem with this growler. I was really excited when I first heard of this brew, glad it lived up to my expectations!"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. The creamy texture and ABV makes for a very rich, yet easy drinking offering. I've compared this to other Oyster Stouts and this is very much one I enjoy. Well done COAST."
"D-More enjoyable than some of the off styles you see. Interesting and controlled enough to not get bored with trying to tease out the flavors. I found myself wanting a second glass, and then a third."
"M - Just under medium bodied, smooth."
"A wonderful roasty mineral briney goodness on the nose and flavor profile. The local oysters brought a nice dry brine on the finish to a well balanced huge roasty grain bill. Outstanding brew here. Huge chewy creamy mouthfeel that was a pleasure to consume.I found this to be highly drinkable. Bravo to the good folk at COAST!!!"
