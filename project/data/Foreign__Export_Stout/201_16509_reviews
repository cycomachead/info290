"Bottle.  Slightly Sour.  Interesting flavor."

"O- Really good, but to sweet for me to have more than 1 per sitting. The pour is outrageous and took about 5 min to finish, it actually foamed all over the desk like a mini volcano when I opened the bottle. Lots of complex flavors to keep you guessing, and overall a great beer."

"A very unique stout.  The flavor is quite complex, with char, dark dried fruits and yeast fighting for dominance.  It took about 7 minutes to finsh the pour due to an explosive head even with a gentle pour.  Just as a side note, there was more chunky residue at the bootom of this galss than any beer I've ever had."

"Overall a good Belgian stout and interesting but not my favorite."

"This seems to have aged gracefully; quite enjoyable."

"You get a BLAST of aromas. Coffee grinds, cocoa powder, burnt toast, figs, prunes, and even a touch of leather. Musky as well, although this is more of a mild background tone. Flavors are all over the place and work quite nicely together. Smooth and medium bodied, but carbonation is up there. Any more carbonation and I wouldn't like it as much. But overall, a good beer indeed."

"Has an incredible amount of tan head. This beer has set in in my fridge for sometime and I cannot believe the amount of explosive head that comes out of this thing. You would need a big gulp if you wanted to do an aggressive pour with this. Head finally settles and begins to flot with a 1/2 finger thickness. Smell is very strong with some sweet malt rather than roast and sour fruits. Taste is less sour than smell and has a hint of chocolate."

"Having read a number of the other reviews, it seems like there is more variability in this beer than what I'm generally used to. The bottle I tried poured with a thick tan head that settled into a creamy, persistent lacing. I got a big boosey nose right away that really defined this beer for me. It wasn't unpleasant but rather, it was quite nice. Alcohol was up front in the taste but the rest of the flavor notes were strong enough to balance it well. There was a sour taste that set in fairly quickly and really distinguished this from other stouts. This one component to the taste added a lot of complexity and was what gave it the edge to stand up to the alcohol. I haven't seen anyone else mention this and it makes me wonder if the difference in this bottle came from the way it was handled and stored before I bought it. Medium body for a stout and a pleasant, creamy mouthfeel. I really enjoyed it and would buy more if I thought it would be consistent."

"O: Overall this is a different beer that is worth trying. I have passed this one by many times, but finally got around to trying it out of necessity since I have enjoyed De Dolle's other beers many times. I think Ill stick with Still Nacht though as my favorite from them for the time being."

"You cannot taste any of the alcohol in this. But it is still created as a sipper. The carbonation and the acidity and bitterness make it a slow ride. and that ain't a bad thing. very unsessionable. sit down with a box of chocolates and drink this while you eat. or maybe have it with some Mexican/mole."
"O. This is what I would call a stout and strong dark ale combo. I think it's really well balanced and very drinkable. A hybrid like this might not be for everyone, though."

"330 ml bottle into snifter, bottled in June 2012. Pours nearly pitch black color with a huge 2-3 finger foamy and rocky light tan head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, raisin, toast, candi sugar, coffee, light clove, licorice, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with moderate fruity/spicy yeast notes. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, light char, raisin, toast, light clove, candi sugar, light licorice, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, candi sugar, raisin, light clove, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with light-moderate yeast esters; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian style export stout. All around nice balance and complexity of roasted/yeast ester flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: certainly a De Dolle creation....once again, not your typical export stout, but quite memorable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Flavors are very nice. I would imagine this will develop more acidity and, to its detriment, even more carbonation. Would still be nice to let one of these sit."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - As interesting and weird as one would expect from De Dolle. The dark malt mostly has the effect of coloring the yeast character as dark fruit in the aroma, but in the flavor profile it comes out much more forcefully as roast and coffee. There is a bit of harshness in all that roast flavor, but it smooths out in the finish as a little bit of the fruit character comes back in. Definitely better than most Belgian stouts I have tried."
""

"O: Nice beer. An authentic De Dolle beer. Good quality. Recommend"
""

"Overall: I'd say it's pretty decent, but my expectations were a bit too high."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all a decent stout. I've been avoiding it for years. A bottle is plenty at 9%. My advice is, find this as fresh as possible if you want to avoid pronounced sour notes. And not those good sour notes that Im fond of."
""
""
"O - This one was ok. The over carbonation really brought it down on all levels. I may revisit this one in the future, I just hope it is better than this one was."
""
"Me no likey."
""
"O: Interesting beer from the point/counterpoint of the malts and hops. Very tasty, but point deductions for extreme head. I would not buy this again at the price I bought it, but would definitely not turn this down if offered."
"stamp on the cap says bottled jun 2010, but a stout with 9%abv, i decided to give it a try. there is plenty of life left in this bottle. a very slow pour results in a glass full of head that takes twelve minutes for it to get to the point where i can drink it. with all this foam i expected some lacing, but nope, this looks oily. the nose is very sweet and cola smelling. hints of toffee and caramel can barely squeek thru the strong alochol aroma. taste is dominated by alochol also. the flavors that do manage to be detected are more cola like than stout like. mouthfeel is very thin and warming, almost burning. over carbonation is also a problem for me with this beer. overall i feel this is not worth the $7 i paid for a 11.2oz bottle."
""
"Unbelievable lightness of touch for a 9%ABV beer. Very unique."
""
""
"There is a lot of flavor here, the vinous qualities run deep. The difference between this and a normal Imperial Stout is subtle and yeast based. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Poured from 33 cl bottle into a wide-mouthed wine glass. Beware to any trying De Dolle for the first time- all of their brews are EXTREMELY lively and should be poured very carefully. I've only poured half the bottle and upon looking at the remainder there is a significant amount of foam in the bottle itself. It pours a very dark brown bordering on black as any stout should; very lively head that was a finger and a half even in this wine glass and it retains it well with limited lacing. The smell is primarily of Belgian yeast but with hints of dark malt and chocolate. The taste is rich and chocolatey but not too much so. The mouthfeel, in my opinion, is the more important aspect of these brews- in short, it is wonderful. Totally carbonated and sparkling to keep the heaviness of the malt palatable. I highly recommend this or any of De Dolle's other beers to those looking for something out of the ordinary (or even if you just want a damn good Belgian brew)."
"Overall: A Belgian export stout with good character. Unique flavor, look and feel. Enjoyable, but messy. Has aging potential, but I think the sweetness could take over."
""
"If you put hops and roast flavor on opposite sides of the beer spectrum, this is the roasty equivalent of a DIPA."

"Date on cap was June 2010"
""
"I hope you find a good bottle of this and enjoy!"
"Very enjoyable. Taste is very good but not as good as the nose. Overall rating reflects that this just slightly warranted a 4 taste-wise. A nice beer, interesting mix of a BSDA and stout."
"Taste is rotten cocoa beans with a side of dirt and old fruit. Im guessing this is bad, but it is not sour like most infected beers I have had. Drain pour and I will post this review merely for anyone else who might have a similar experience with this one."
"O - A very nice fuerte stout! Has a zing and is a little earthier than your typical RIS. Worth a go!"
"Pours a fairly dark black with a huge fluffy head that settles to a squat cap. Aromas of dark malt, soy sauce, molasses, and dark berry jam with a slight touch of vinegar, this is likely past it's prime. Taste follows the nose closely, lots of dark malt, molasses, and blackberry jam with a long-lasting bitter finish. Definitely a bit oxidized, but far from undrinkable. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner then expected (perhaps due to the age), about medium-bodied overall with decent carbonation. The ABV is hidden nicely. Overall a decent Stout, but probably a touch past it's prime. I'd like to try a fresh bottle."
"Poursed a massive all head with a muddy mocha brown tinge to the head. Smells great with caramel and toffee. The taste comes out more of a coffee and cocoa but some of the candied aspects are there too, especially as it warms. Pretty high alcohol at 9%, and they probably could have called this Imperial. An interesting bold stout and I'm learning De Dolle is a brewery turning out top knotch stuff."
"O: Not my favorite stout, and obviously over carbonated, but this had a good flavor to it and was enjoyable enough."
"This beer poured out as a thick black liquid, the head was almost nonexistent. The smell of the beer was deeply roasted and has a pretty typical Belgian yeast aroma too. The taste of the beer was toasted and burnt with plenty of malt in it. The beer was very dry in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was pretty thick. Overall the beer isn't too bad, there was a lot of clumpy sediment that sank to the bottom. All in all I wasn't too bad, I might drink it again one day."
"This is truly an astounding stout, and one of the better-crafted of its kind that I've encountered. Well worth the effort to seek out."
"This is a medium bodied brew that was excessively carbonated. Huge alcohol presence here felt like it was much higher than the listed 9% and the amount of carbonation would tell this continued to ferment in the bottle. Quite a well rounded brew with lots of char-like flavoring from the roast of the grain. At first, I was expecting this brew to be an infected mess due to the amount of carbonation but it turned out surprisingly well. I would like to have this brew again."
"Overall drinkability is good as I enjoyed the flavor and creaminess, but it really needed a little more body."
"O- Quite a peculiar beer. Mixing characters from stouts and strong ales is sure a bold attempt, which was partially successful in my opinion. The beer is overall very good, though sure not easy to drink"
"O-De Dolle is one of my favorite breweries. This isn't one of my favorite beers from them fresh, but age has really helped it along. A wonderful offering."
"Overall, an interesting beer and one I am glad to have tried. The flavor and aroma are not what I usually look for in a stout, but I would probably have this one again given the chance."
"overall as solid as the day is long, i could drink something like this all day."
"The excessive carbonation is a little odd in this style, but that was my only gripe, and it is slight indeed. The aroma and flavor are fantastic, and the alcohol is so well hidden, you could easily knock one or two of these back before regretting it the next morning. Another fantastic beer from De Dolle-Big Surprise."
"Overall: Overall I found the beer to be pretty good. The nice complex flavor mixes sweet flavors with an earthy and hoppy aftertaste. The only downside I found was its carbonation abundance, but I'd still recommend trying this beer."
"Pours jet black with a small brown head. In the aroma, dry candy sugar, a small roast and a hint of coffee. In the taste, coffee and candy sugar stands out, and really carbonated. A carbonation like bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small sweet coffee and roasted malt aftertaste. Quite carbonated, but nice flavor and feels lighter that 9%."
"This beer is explosive and complex. The flavor goes forever. A really interesting beer."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being high. It definitely felt extremely fizzy for the style, which I didn't care for. Overall it was an interesting beer, but it just didn't work well for me. Too much carbonation and a lot of sweet, crisp, tart, fruit flavors that were a little overwhelming. Some decent flavors but overall it wasn't that easy to drink."
"In the end, I don't know if I want it scaled back or not; it's such a great experience of a beer as is. As it stands though, I know I couldn't have more than one at a time. I would say that reigning in some of the intensity would make it a more drinkable beer, but not necessarily any more pleasant. Definitely a great grab and a great first try of De Dolle's lineup."
"Drink- This was quite taste. Unlike a stout to me more like a BSDA. Very good little beer. I will have this one again."
"From 33 cl brown bottle, cap stamped with Bottled Jan. 2010. filled to the absolute top. Pours a pitch very dark brown with billowing tan styrofoam head. Smell: moderate roasted grain component, bitter chocolate, buttery toffee, earthy, leafy and mildly citric hopping. Taste: moderately roasty, dark chocolate, toffee, prune, a little almond extract. Hopping is earthy with a tinge of citrus. Medium bodied with a fluffy, creamy feel. More carbonated than most. Nice."
"I have no idea about the style. It's a cross between an export stout and a Belgium strong which is what I expected. This bottle was bottled Jan of 2010 so some age has taken place. The flavors have not mixed though I wonder if there was a bit more hop presence to start. Well worth a try, even at nearly 6 bucks for a single."
"O: Solid beer from De Dolle, who I find to be a fairly hit or miss brewery."
"O - De Dolle is produces quality beer. Not sure this is what i expected from a stout but this beer rocked. It keeps in line with De Dolles spices and warm abv's and didn't disappoint."
"Light to medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. There is a bit of a tart aftertaste. I think this is a pretty good beer, but I would like it better if it there was no tartness. I don't think the tartness works real well when combined with roasted malt and chocolate."
"Overall, this is a pretty tasty export stout. Lots of fruit character in the nose and taste with nice chocolate notes. If you like this style, then this beer is worth picking up. Maybe not on par with some of De Dolle's other beers, but solid nonetheless."
"Overall it's a fine representation of the style. I'd get it on tap without reservation."
"Verdict: Not really doing it for me, but unique enough that some will love it perhaps."
"Dark fruit, plum and espresso, fudge brownie. Nutella hazelnut spread. Dry bakers chocolate lends some bitterness that compliments the roasty malt flavor. Aftertaste is dry and earthy, with traces of dark roast coffee. Very effervescent, characteristic of a Belgian stout. A few swirls settle it down, releasing some of the CO2. This was nice to revisit, after having a few times over the years. A unique beer from a unique brewery."
"On tap this is a great beer, check it out if you see it, haven't had it in a bottle yet."
"Hints of roasted dark malt. Mostly spiced, dark super bubbly, belgian yeast flavors. This drinks more like a dark, roastier dubbel than a stout at first, but after a short while the darker and roasted malts peak to remind you that this was suppose to be a stout. The belgian flavors definitely dominate this beer. Definitely something worth trying for the sake of something new."
"D: A little bit stout, a little bit Belgian. I like it."
"While I'm glad to have tried this brew, I'll be fine with not dropping $8 for another bottle of this chalky, carbonated stout again."
"decent stout, don't know if it's worth the $7 dollars I paid."
"Impression: Belgian brewers rock when it comes to styles started elsewhere. DeDolle is new on my radar. Gonna be trying all the lineup I can get. Suggest you do the same."
"D - pretty heavy on the stomach. Gonna have to drink slowly."
"D: A potent beer both alcoholically and flavor-wise, this'd be tough to quaff in any quantity. However, one of these is very, very good, especially in the doldrums of winter."
"D-like i said above, this drink like a lighter stout. it is so drinkable for the abv. i'm very impressed. i wish i could find this in 4-packs for a good price....of course that could be the end of me."
"The taste and drinkability of this Belgian Stout is quite good if you ask me. The taste makes up for it's ""okay"" smell and disappointing pour. A tad bitter, with a nice overall roasty sensation. Coffee undertones as well. For $5 and some change, I really enjoyed this beer. 9% abv to boot."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. One inch head of a tan color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight tartness, slight acidity, hint of syrup, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of dark citrus. Fits the style of a Foreign / Export Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a very high carbonation level. Tastes of slight coffee, slight roasted malt, slight sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of tartness, hint of syrup, and a hint of hop. Overall, good body and blend, aroma was slightly off-putting and way too carbonated."
"The ridiculous head and hints of sourness makes me wonder about a possible infection, but maybe this is the way the beer is supposed to be. Still pretty good, but not the best Foreign Stout I've had. Certainly a unique Belgian take on the style."
"Very good flemish stout."
"Sorry De Dolle, but I doubt I will have the courage to try another of your beers, even if they do sound good..."
"Thick, dark tan head, settles to a 1/8"" head. Light nutty aroma, with some earthy and winey notes as well. Very carbonated and tingly, crisp mouthfeel. Easy to taste the Belgian twist to this one. Pick up roasted notes in flavor, with a big grape/champagne flavor as well. Big sweetness. Big fruit presence for a stout. Definitely a change of pace from your typical stout. Warmth brings a roasty and nutty notes to the flavor. Carbonation with the fullness and weight of flavor makes it a little rough in the beginning but the warmth seems to help smooth things out. Though it's quite a twist from the original style I did enjoy trying this one."
"Thanks to Smalls for hooking me up with this one! Dark brown-reddish pour with two finger caramel colored head and nice lacing. Started spewing foam as soon as I cracked the top, and took a while to pour because of all the carbonation. Kind of unusual, earthy, nutty nose with hints of yeasty bread, chocolate, coffee grounds, and a bit of anise and cherries and smoke. The taste is dominated by bitter roasted coffee and cocoa, but is nicely balanced with a sweet caramel malt backbone with a touch of smoke and dark fruit, especially cherries. The mouthfeel is a little thin for a stout, and the carbonation was a bit excessive at the beginning, but as it warmed, this beer really came alive. It was a bit boozey at the start, but mellowed nicely and became really drinkable. Heading to Essen this weekend for the Kerstbierfest, and hope to pick up some more offerings from De Dolle."
"D: This bottle is definitely a good after dinner brew, very enjoyable as a dessert. I don't think I would like to drink a whole lot of it though. Interesting beer, I might buy a few more bottles to age indefinitely to see what develops."
"I'm pretty sure this bottle is past its prime, at least age wise. It was in the bargain section due to an ""age markdown"". But at 9% I'll give it a go. This one pours a midnight black, medium bodied, with a three finger dark khaki head. The smell isn't what I expected from a stout. It has the roasted coffee smell followed by a sweet, candied fruit aroma, possibly raisin. It's actually an appealing presence. The taste is very rich. It's a highly roasted, almost smoky flavor with a slight raisin like sweetness on the backend. It still is moderately boozy though. It's definitely interesting. It drinks pretty smoothly, drinking heavier than it looked. It would be a little easier to drink if the alcohol wasn't as present. It is a really flavorful and solid import."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I am a dark/stout beer drinker during the winter months and so this fit the bill. The beer is very dark with a medium but thick foam. The taste was full bodied and had flavor thoughout with a nice after taste that reminded you that you just had an extra stout beer. Some Belgian beers have a clovey taste but this beer did not which was nice. Next time I am in Brussels I will be looking for this beer!"
"Pretty rich. One at a time would be plenty."
"Pours a very carbonated, three fingers worth of caramel brown head crowning a black body. Scents of tobacco, anise, and plums on the nose that are echoed on the taste. Strong licorice flavor with a cocoa and tobacco finish. Mouthfeel is soft and medium bodied. A more subtle licorice flavor would have made this beer more drinkable."
"Poured into a pint glass. De Dolle beers must all have obscene carbonation. My glass is full of thick tan head and about an inch of beer on the initial pour. Once it starts to settle down in the glass, it actually looks really appealing with the head sinking down in the middle and leaving a ton of soapy lace. The initial smell is full of Belgian yeasts mostly. Further nose dives uncover hints of sweet cocoa and dark cherries. The aroma is also slightly boozy. The taste is up front with the Belgian yeast, dark fruits, bananas, and finishes with slightly bitter espresso. The mouthfeel is full with decent carbonation and the nine percent abv is very well hidden. My biggest qualm with this one was that it took me twenty minutes to get it into my glass."
"Well carbonated and easy to drink this is one of the best stouts I've had so far."
"This is a sipper for sure. I might have to pick up another to see how it ages."
"The excessive gusher should have tipped me off that this would be a highly-carbonated beer. The feel is a bit too spritzy for the style. I like my stouts smooth and creamy, albeit heavy. This one is crisp, sharp, and bordering on harsh. Though it is a bit lighter than expected. This lightness allows me to sip this with greater freedom. The sourness crosses over into the flavor as well. The yeast becomes a big player, but some chocolate comes forward as well. I like the slight roasted quality it has, but the sourness becomes tiring after awhile. Glad I tried this beer, but I probably wouldn't seek this one out again."
"Thoughts: Well, I like it. The nose was the best part of it I think. This is a good beer, but not an amazing one. It seems like Belgians know how to make beer no matter what."
"Opened with a very energetic pop and then pours with a really big foamy head. Have to show patience as the head settles to even try this one. Dark brown color with a big fluffy head that slowly settles. Jeez, this thing almost makes me feel it is infected. The aroma is a mix of sweet dark fruits, licorice, and coffee grounds. The mouthfeel is light and carbonated. Alcohol is fairly prevalent in the taste along with some sweetness and some biterness in the end. Sweet candy fruit taste that quickly transitions and is really interrupted by the carbonation. Really not my idea of a stout and nothing I would want to drink again."
"Overall, not a very good beer. I can't tell if this is how it is supposed to taste or not. I can understand the high carbonation but some of the flavors just aren't good. Not to drinkable."
"D: Despite the mouthfeel, a greater range of flavor would have produced a more drinkable brew."
"The drinkability is slightly lower with the warming and tingly booze, as well as the lingering earthy bitterness. A slight spicy feel to it as well, and it's somewhat thick and syrupy."
"Drinkability -- Though the label states plainly 'Export Stout,' this drinks like an especially dark roast Belgian strong dark ale. Really no singular 'stout' descriptors until the finish when the burnt flavors come out. Also, very boozy. Worth a try, but I'm not interested in going back to this one."
"d: Definitely enjoyable, but not something I'd be in a big hurry to revisit."
"D: Definitely not what I expected from this vintage beer. Alcohol was still hot and the bodied just seems to have faded with time. I'd love to, at some point try a fresh one for comparison though."
"This was a pretty good example of the style, and offered excellent flavor and aroma qualities that really made the beer."
"With a 9% ABV, you definitely need to be careful with this one. Goes awesomely well with the steak fajitas I picked up from a local eatery. And if you're lucky enough to have a Beer Sensei to help you along the beer journey, you'd be wise to heed his/her advice."
"De Dolle rarely disappoints, and this is no exception. A very good stout."
"Good beer, but not as good as I expected. Poured with a small, tan head and a bit of lace. Color is an almost opaque very dark brown with some sediment bits. Aroma is really big with the licorice, roasty, dark ripe fruit, dark roasted coffee, malt. Flavor is like that plus has some sour tang, toffee, very bitter dark chocolate. Body is a tad thin, good carbonation, sharp on tongue back and sides - almost astringent. Finish has the tang remaining along with a bit of the dark malt in the throat that is fairly long. Not a session for me."
"This one is good!!"
"Won't ever try this again, especially after having so many good Belgian Stouts like Allagash Black or that one Terrapin Side project Beer. This is a worse version of that other Podge Belgian Stout I had once and also hated."
"perfect brew"
"D: Not your average stout, but definitely a drinkable beer."
"D: Pretty drinkable actually, just not exactly what's expected from an export stout."
"OVERALL: A good beer, but like their Oerbier, the palate lets this one down. Tasty and interesting, what the their spicy Belgian yeast playing a big role in this stout, but the body is too light and airy for the style, the alcohol is too present, and it burns too much on the way down. Nevertheless, this is one worth checking, if only to try a different take on the style."
"D: The complexity of the flavors makes this beer very unique. I would definitely try this one again. This is a beer that is better sipped."
"I can see throwing back a few of these, but after 2 or three I'd be feeling pretty good, but the bitterness would engage my gag reflex which is accentuated the more buzzed I am. Still, it's a crying shame to have wasted so much when opening it."
"Quite tasty. I really enjoyed it, but it does seem to lack pronounced depth. I'm pretty sure it's there, but lost in the lighter brighter bitterness and big carbonation. Expensive to have around, but very good nonetheless."
"D: I think this is a good beer, just not what I wanted. I wouldn't see myself seeking this out, or even seeing it at the store and buying it again. This just doesn't give me what the name implies."
"Overall this is an entertaining and unique beer that I would try again."
"Drinkability - I would take many other mass produced stouts, I dont think I would pick this up again."
"Drinkability: as I said, this is a tasty but inconvenient beer to drink. I rather like it, but its ABV and some of the tartness would wear down my palate too much to really have more than one of these."
"As far as drinkability goes, this one does well for a 9% BSDA."
"D - Everything De Dolle does is fantastic."
"Would get this again."
"This reminds me of a Belgian style stout, like Allagash Black. Has majority the characteristics of a stout, but with small notes of a Belgian Dark ale. High carbonation, medium body. Coffee, licorice, molasses, dark fruits. Very little bitters in this stout. Pretty good!"
"D-Acceptable, but the excessive carbonation, dryness, and lack of distinct well rounded flavors makes me glad I only got 1"
"I would say this beer is well worth a try."
"overall a very nice stout."
"Cheers."
"Overall this was a nice stout, and would also like to add that thankfully there was no sign of coffee as there is in so many other stouts/porters these days."
"D: Woo boy, a tough call: I do like the utter 'Belgian-ness' of this brew; full of fruit and spice amidst the cocoa/stout-ness. Strong beer (at 9%) and odd flavors made this one to linger over and don't necessarily draw me back for another. Very worthy of a try, but be your own judge if it warrants a return."
"Drinkability is good except for the carb issue."
"D: This is a fun beer to drink and certainly takes you for a ride. Pair it with some dark chocolate and you've got a nice finish to a meal."
"Overall, kind of tastes like a combination of a Russian Imperial Stout and a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, probably my two favorite styles, so it's kind of hard for me not to like this."
"The body is jet black with a big brownish head and light carbonation. The aroma gives away its Belgian origins straight away with the unmistakable Belgian yeast, which sits alongside roasted dark malts, brown sugar and molasses. The taste is quite acidic with clear yeastiness and mild citrus. There is some dark chocolate and roasted smokey malts but they sit behind. The feel is very active with lots of carbonation, maybe a touch too much. Very interesting beer, but I like the De Dolle twist on this stout."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but I'm only giving it a 3.5 because of the incredibly strong and lingering aftertaste."
"Somewhat of a unique character-a bit fresh, acidic and ""sweet sour"" in character. Likely a good match up with many desserts."
"Full bodied beer that is an excellent example of the style. A must try beer. Thank you Greg and Karolina for the birthday present."
"Overall a great beer with enough complexity to make it interesting and varying as time passes, but a little weak on the mouth feel. I'm not sure what caused the initial explosion, so I can't count it against the beer itself. Cheers."
"Been wanting to try this for ages, very happy to finally do so. A sort of contradictory example of the style - intense yet in many ways quite subtle. Almost too many elements at play..."
"Very dark black, almost impenetrable, medium tan head with some lacing. Aroma of burnt espresso, like when you leave the coffee pot on the stove too long. Taste of bitter chocolate and roasted coffee beans with hints of vanilla. Chewy mouthfeel. Bitter finish."
"Hahahaha. It doesn't matter how slow you pour this one. You are going to get a full pint glass of foam. The head is super frothy and goopy. Aroma is very intense. Nose is full of dark fruit alcohol, and yeast. Taste is definately that of a belgian stout. This is fruity and metallic. There are hints of chocolate and coffee but nothing too strong. This is interesting but isn't a stout.. There is an odd astringentness to it. The feel though is WAY too thin. It's not drinakble. Its a waste of money."
"World-class! ~"
"D - About as high as you're going to get for a stout that borders on imperial."
"D: Tart stouts can be something of a hit or miss, and this one really hits the mark. It has a good balance between roasted sweetness and fruity tartness and it's an interesting encounter from start to finish. Lots of character and a complex composition. Highly recommended."
"Pours a deep, barely transparent sable that is chocolaty brown near the bottom of my glass mug. Head is quite thick, light tan and rather persistent. (The head was HUGE with my first pour!) Aroma is smoky with strong coffee and unsweetened chocolate tones as well as hints of malt, hops and even a touch of fruit. Mouth-filling flavor is like fine roast coffee with citrus and nutty hints and touches of unsweetened chocolate and caramel, simply lip-smacking. Texture is thick, smooth and fizzy. A winner!"
"Deep black body with head that never fades...seems like its thick enough to float a coin. Aroma is a bit sour but not from roast, rather something between chocolate and cherries. Taste is comfortable and well balanced between the dark dry chocolate malt, faint sour cherry, some Belgian spice, absence of yeast flavor. It came across to me as very well constructed. Alcohol is not present in any way. But at 9.0% its not a bit too mild. Its an awesome beer, but I personally look for a bit more flavor to go along with a 9.0% tax on my sobriety."
"Here's a black, espresso like beer with a moderate tan head. It's aroma is interesting...malty, with a pepper and licorice smell that's a little unique. The taste has a lot of sugary sweetness, with a slight sourness in the background. Lots of chocolate and coffee character, along with the already mentioned licorice. It's a little thinner than I expected, and has a bit of astringency at times. The beer is quite tasty, though, and still satisfying. For a 9% beer, this one hides the alcohol incredibly well. Pretty good stuff."
"D: This brew is palatable, but it's not something I could have more than once in a great while."
"Really a very good beer, I wish half of it didn't end up on my end table, bit... that being said... it's a very nice stout. And for Belgian trying an American Stout style, excellent."
"Very good stout."
"The body is moderate and a little milky leaving it lacking a bit. Just a touch though. Overall some really nice malt note but a big deterrent in the metallic/oxidation notes in the nose and taste."
"I wish this one wouldn't have exploded upon opening...I would love some more of this! Overall, a very good beer for having been picked up by chance."
"I wasn't too excited at firts, but found myself going back for more, again and again. I enjoyed it."
"Overall...I don't know. I'm confused by this beer. Go for it if you're adventurous, but a sour stout isn't for me."
"D- The tartness of this is does a good job of hiding any of the alcohol presence. Still, this is a bit of a sipper. This is by no mans an export stout, but more of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Very unique."
"One to savor and enjoy for the evening. But one that you enjoy hanging with for a while as it evolves and grows during the night."
"When it comes to stouts around 10% ABV, I prefer more complexity and viscosity. While this is enjoyable, it was a bit thin and one dimensional for me."
"Had a bottle with dessert at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA - made a great pairing with their molten chocolate cake. Like other big Belgian stouts, this is a subtle beer. The aroma reminds me of cooled hot chocolate and the flavor has a slight sour tang with a dry cocoa powder finish. It certainly doesn't drink like a 9% beer, and unlike most export stouts, it has a subtle Belgian flair from a dried fruit flavor undercurrent. I'd say it's worth a try."
"Note: I had this later and did not review, and I remember the sour, fruity aspects being much more muted, with a much bigger, dryer roastiness. Preferred the complexity of the first greatly. This score reflects that first bottle."
"D: Please sir, may I have another?"
"The taste is superb. Love the roasted barley and heavy molasses taste."
"This was a decent stout offering, but I can't help but think that the Belgians should leave stout making to the Americans and English."
"Very well balanced dark fruity stout."
"Though heavy with the head it doesn't inflate and percolate in the mouth. A smooth feel that compliments (or is a result of) the chocolate taste and aroma. Nicely done. Followed this up with a Labatt Blue 12oz can. Kiding, 12oz bottle..."
"Light roasted malt and mineral water bitterness up front. Scorched candy sugar, raisins, and date sweetness follow. Gradually becomes more roasted and bitter with notes of coffee and dark chocolate. Dark chocolate bitterness lasts well into the roasty finish. Somewhat of a fruity Belgian-yeast accent mixed with a woody flavor throughout. Very nice! Very lively, bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Medium-bodied. Better than expected."
"Palate offers a nice roasty cocoa flavor in the front with some bittering hops towards the end. Lighter bodied than expected, and comes across more like a sessionable dark beer... reminds me of the Schwarzbier style. Easy drinking."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"Aroma is wonderfully creamy, dark and roasted malts, herbal, earthy, and an assorted mixture of dark, sweet, fruits. Taste is much like the aroma, but bigger, drier and just a bit smokey. Bitter, bitter chocolate, leafy tobacco, oak and smoke. Finish is just a bit puckering in bitterness, leaves the tongue a bit ragged and dry. It's lively in taste and lively in feel, really and extraordinary beer, I just wish I got to drink the whole bottle and not have to clean my entire table afterward!"
"Foams over unattended. Pours a dark black body, can't see through. Big creamy, smooth head, tan head. Good lacing. Toffee sweet malty aroma. Strong molasses and some alcohol, but not much. Mol'sses flavor, hot aftertaste. Some light coffee, and .roasted flavors. Somewhat dusty, ashy..Creamy mouthfeel, fizzy and almost harsh. Pretty tasty."
"D - This was an interesting take on the style. A little fruit and quite unique."
"D - Drinkability is not bad. There are characteristics in this beer that stand out to me as being very good. Unfortunately, there are a few others that do more to run it in the ground. I can see alot of potential here. Oh well. Glad I got to try it out but would not seek it out agian."
"Pours a very dark purplish black with huge foamy beige head. Aroma of spice, chocolate malt, dark fruit, berries and figs. Very carbonated up front with lots of chocolate maltiness, followed by a smooth balance of spice and dark fruit. Lots of berry and fig. Dry sweet finish. Very complex and quite tasty!"
"Great beer."
"I've had two other Belgian stouts that I can remember (Alvinne and Allagash), and they were a far cry better than this complex mess."
"In my opinion one of the finest stouts available anywhere."
"Very drinkable. Very tasty and good. If it just had a bit more body, it could be perfect. Which means that I will keep searching."
"Well, it's not something I'd likely find myself craving, but it is a crafty combination of earthy stout-hood and Belgian ambience. So it's a stout with a split barnyard personality. The ABV is enough to keep indulgence in intelligent perspective. I'm not sure it goes with Monday Night Football, but it's worth experiencing once or twice."
"D- too strong and expired tasting to think about having more than one. glad ive tried it, de dolle makes some pretty solid beers. i might try thsi one again, from a different store."
"Decent for a stout, but too much roasted malt for me. Also a bit pricey - $5.50 for 330 ml. To me it's not worth it."
"Taste is very much the same. There's lots of carbonation to release the aromas in the malt. Bubbly mouthfeel which hurts the drinkability a bit for me."
"if my bottle wasn't starting to turn, i could subtract all the notes i wrote about it being sour. aside from all the sourness, it was a great beer!!!"
"Bottom line: An interesting and unusual tasting example of the style that I'm glad I had the chance to try but frankly, it doesn't work all that well for me. Too much tartness and alcohol cut down on the drinkability and overall enjoyment of the brew."
"I have to explore this world of Belgian imperial stout immediatly. Wow, fantastic drink from an immpeccable brewery."
"Overall: Not really impressed, it takes like a supped up guiness with more alcohol and a really bitter finish, Id like to try more belgian stouts but i would have to say that North America makes the best ones, stay american!"
"tasty, but what a shame about the gushing bottle. the beer store we got this from is pretty reputable, so we don't think this is a storage problem."
"Verdict: excellent beer if you can find it"
"Taste is very sooth. Roasted with nice coffee notes. The alcohol is very present and leaves a warming feeling in my throat. Bitterness is a combination of hop and maltbitter and is spot on. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky and body is medium. The yeast adds a subtle fruitiness and the tartness in the smell is giving the beer it's extra depth. Lots of taste!"
"I would tend to say that since the two bottles of beer were stored at 45 degrees for 7 days and remained totally untouched during that time that there was indeed adequate refrigeration and a relative degree of non-agitation."
"An interesting brew glad I tried it I would drink it again if it was around"
"D: A good overall beer that is very smooth and light per style but still very well balanced and brewed."
"This beer was very unique. I've had many beers with wine, spirit, or port-like flavors/aromas, but never one that so closely matched sherry. Very nice."
"Overall impression: A black dubbel? This isn't a foreign extra stout by any stretch. If it is, then it's infected and that's a different issue. It is enjoyable just not to style. This one needs to be reclassified b/c I was hoping for a nice Foreign Extra Stout and this one just didn't deliver."
"Drinkability here is good, but for safetys sake I'd never have more than 2 in a row, the ABV would melt my face. This would go perfect with a baked ham. Very good, and my first take on Foreign/Export stouts."
"A really interesting take on a stout, and the De Dolle yeast really shines through. Tastes more along the lines of a strong dark Belgian rather than a stout. A lot of complexity for a five year old brew."
"Pours dark chocolate brown with a thick dark tan head. Aroma of dark chocolates, malt, caramel, and coffee. Initial taste of chocolate and coffee sliding into a medium bitter coffee finish. Has vineouss notes as well. High carbonation. Finish lacks bitterness, but the complexity of flavor more than makes up for it."
"Poured an obnoxious sized head, slowly receeding and leaving sticky lace patches - blackish body. Smell includes fruit and spices - like a Belgian should - with several malts including coffee, chocolate and possibly biscuit. A little thick and syrupy body, this beer has a mix of malt and fruit in the taste. Coffee malt is prevelant as it touches down in the backbite, and the main fruit flavor that comes through is cherry. Hints of chocolate and something like caramel in the side round it out.Overall smooth and balanced, this is a beer that I would like to have again."
"Probably the most impressive head I have ever seen. Even with a careful pour the head seemed to rise forever. The body was black and the head was brown. Smells like bitter cocoa and coffee. Taste was cocoa and coffee with a bit of hopps in there as well. Mouthfeel was impressive also. Didnt feel as thick as I was expecting and the carbonation was perfect."
"An interesting, though pricey (about six bucks for an 11.2 oz. bottle), Belgian stout."
"As far as I can recall, this is the first Belgian stout I've tasted. It lived up to my expectations, although once it warmed it didn't seem too far off from a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Price would be the only thing holding me back from buying again and often."
"Thank you De Dolle!"
"Served in my DFH snifter. Poured an opaque black. Rocky tan colored head started at the taper of the snifter and ended at the lip of the glass (this was my second gusher of the day though) before eventually settling into a quarter inch consistent skim of foam and ringlets. Lot's of sticky lacing coated the glass during each sip; however, adhesion was somewhat weak, leaving only a bit of residue after each sip. Scent was not at all what I expected; prunes and a subtle scent of cocoa. More dark fruit flavors in the mouth (prunes and cherries) with a somewhat tart character (particularly at the finish); cocoa flavors were much more pronounced in the mouth than in the nose. Lively mouthfeel with a nice medium-bodied texture. Drinkability was quite good for a 9% abv brew. Alcohol was well hidden and consistency was solid enough for the style without being overwhelming. All and all a very pleasant tasting experience."
"Mouthfeel is waaay too heavy on the carbonation, makes it hard to drink."
"Drinkability: Not quite complex to warrant the strength, in my opinion, but this is still quite a nice beer. It is fiery, but it's also balanced, in a way."
"d: My first and only beer from Brouwerij De Dolle Brouwers. Not what I was expecting from an export stout. Interesting Belgian take on a stout. I love the spicy belgian yeastiness and the cherry/dark fruit flavors. Good stuff."
"Drinkability: A very good sipping Belgian, started drinking with the meal but finished it as a digestive. Would definitely have this one again."
"Man, this is definitely not the beer for me. Ordered at the Brickstore in Atlanta. This beer looks better than it tastes. After that, it's all downhill. Taste is ridiculously sour...unfortunately I couldn't get past that aspect. On top of the sour taste, the beer was so effervescent, it was almost undrinkable. I could see where some people might like this. As for me, I had to send it back."
"Poured a 33cl bottle into my Chimay chalice. This beer pours a jet black that barely lets any light through. It has a huge dark beige head that turns into about a half an inch of frothy goodness for the entirety of the beer. It leaves a sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is interesting. The first aroma is really strong coffee. If you have ever walked by a local coffee shop that roasts their own beans, that's the aroma. Bitter chocolate is also pretty prevalent. The odd part of the aroma is a big sour aspect. Definite notes of sour pie cherries and Granny apple skin. The taste is awesome. Huge roasted malts, coffee, granny apples and sour cherries. There is almost no sweetness to this beer at all. The sourness that is so prevalent is almost like an American Wild Ale (toned down). The finish is like eating pure cocoa. This beer is bitter and sour in an excellent way. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and pretty carbonated. This is an awesome beer. Definitely one to pick up the next time your at your local bottle shop."
"Poured from 33cl bottle into a new belgium snifter. Poured a midnight black with a super thick brown head great lacing. The head of the beer was the thickest I have ever seen on a stout with this high of an ABV. Smell is roasted malt smell with some dark fruit and an alcohol background. Taste is bitter coffee, roasted malt, and alcohol aftertaste. Mouthfeel is fullbody but highly carbonated and prickly. Cant say that i could drink boats load of this one but I think and heard that this one ages very well."
"Overall: It's fun to try new beers, but sometimes it doesn't work out... like with this one."
"An aggresive pour leaves a thick dark tan head which stays but no lingering lace. The beer is thick like motor oil. Smells of burnt toffee, slight fruitiness and dark roast coffee, some bitter cocoa as well. First taste is a tad overwhelming. A lot of dark roasted malt flavor, almost a sour note at the mid point, must be the yeast, the pour took so long I kicked up a lot of yeast. The after taste leaves a bit of that sourness, the same type of sour I get from espresso, but a very slight hoppiness as well. As the beer warms it becomes vinous, almost port like, defintely better warm. The taste is very sweet, almost cloyingly. Its a little too carbonated for me as well, especially for a stout. Overall a tasty beer, but seems a bit overdone. For my first belgian stout, It was pretty good, but not fantastic."
"Pours a very dark with a tannish head. Flavor is sweet and sticky. Lots of sugar, but not a lot of real firm stout character coming in. The problem here seems to be a seriously high carbonation element. It definitely is interfering with my perception of flavor. Hopefully this is an exception and not the rule. This is nice, but the carbonation is really killing it."
"D- Have one with dinner and one for dessert."
"A very unique beer that I can't really compare to anything that I have had. I am glad that I tried but there are other De Dolle beers that I love more than this. Still, well done."
"D: Creamy and smooth, full of flavor and a work of art. Not my favorite stout but a surprise and worthy entry into the category from the Belgium's."
"-Oelergud"
"This like a Belgian Dark Ale crossed with a stout. Lots of yeast esters going on in here."
"11.2 oz bottle purchased for $4.99 from Gary's in Madison... White De Dolle logo sticker with ""9% ALC/VOL"" and ""Refermented In The Bottle"" on the print... The appearance was outstanding... a gargantuan foamy head spilled over my serving cup and lingered for a bit with a tan and red color... A mahogany-brown hue dominated this serving with a rich aroma of cocoa, dehydrated fruits, and strong, noticeable espresso smells... taste strongly resembled the aroma, with roasted malts, slight vanilla, caramel, figs, and prunes bursting through with an extra creamy, rich, and thick mouthfeel... this beer went down very easily and was extremely drinkable with the rather hefty 9% ABV hardly noticeable at all behind rich dark lattee and strong coffee flavors that dominated the full flavor and character of this rich beer... another excellent sample from De Dolle... this sample was filling and rich without being overbearing or too cloying... good stuff... Definitely recommended..."
"Very impressive."
"Pours black with an impressive looking huge head that is a cofffee with cream color. The head sticks aaround for a awhile too. Smells of dusty cocoa, a touch of sour, something grainy and a bit sour like roasted grain can be as well- this is distinct from the other slightly funky sourness also drifting around in the aromas. There is almost a soapiness at the end. The taste is much more robust than the aroma. Starts slightly sour then transitions into big, roasty, chocolatey flavors with a hint of licorice and an herbal finish. Somewhat unusual, even for a Belgian stout. The mouthfeel is big, viscous, slick, and creamy. Even thought is very big and somewhat alcoholic tasting, the abv is still pretty well concealed. Also, the herbal bitterness in this one cuts right through the mouthcoating flavors to make it more drinkable, while the slight sourness lightens the flavors as well. The sour start ffollowed by the roasty, chocolatey flavors to me is the hallmark of Belgian style stouts. I really think its time to add this as a new category on BA."
"D- Not to great and wouldn't really say it's to true to the style."
"This is for sure a Belgian strong ale and not a stout. With that in mind, it is a very good example of the style. Complex and well balanced from start to finish."
"Wow! This was a very different stout indeed. It tastes like a stout mixed with a sparkling white wine / champagne. Very refreshing and complex and yet it manages to pack in a whopping 9% ABV. This is another fine brew from De Dolle and it gets my recommendation for sure."
"Big roasted malt & fruity ester nose. Huge carbonation, and huge head. Nice woody flavors from the malts & nugget hops. Rich coffee, chocolately alcohol warmth. No harsh hot alcohol. I would have been fooled if someone told me this was lightly barrel aged. Nice and dry for the style, which is surprising because this runs right up into imperial stout category without venturing too far into that realm. The only real thing I can ding this one on is the over-carbonation, but with Belgian yeast strains, you kinda expect it. Let is sit in the glass and warm up and vent carbonation and it keeps getting better and better. Bonus points for having such a great label.."
"Mouthfeel is thin and the carbonation bite is extreme. All and all this beer has some flaws that are hard to overlook. Less black malt, a tad more body and lower carbonation would make this a great beer."
"Just as people said in other reviews, this beer turns into a foam monster once it hits the glass. After almost 5 minutes, I was able to get most into the glass with minimal overflow. The head was a huge mahogany pillow of foam. The color was a deep brown/black color. The smell was of coffee, and the taste was of bitter chocolate and deeply roasted barley. I found this beer to be too distracting due the over-carbonation, and a bit heavy with the alcohol. This is the first time I have tried a Belgian stout, but would probably stick with the more traditional makers in the future."
"This is probably the 5-6th time I've had this brew over the last few years, and my notes all say the same thing... ""Overcarbonated, needs more body, too much alchol... etc."" That being said, it is way better than the Belgian RIS I had last night. I am really looking forward to being able to try Allagash's attempt at a Belgian Style RIS (I bet it's a world better)... however, Now that I've actually rated this one, I will probably buy 3-5 for the cellar to try down the road... but the bottle conditioning is not going to help the overcarbonation."
"as for drinkability, i could drink this slowly, but could not make a session out of it. it is a reasonably good brew, just not sure it fits in the stout category."
"Be careful pouring this one. Poured into a Stella goblet and all but just an inch at the bottom was a khaki colored head, more bubbly towards the bottom, more foamy at the top. It took me about 10 minutes to empty the whole bottle into the glass. After it all settles, a thin layer covers this black brew. Smell is very sweet. Definite Belgian yeast smell, some alcohol. Tangy is a good word to describe this beer both in taste and in smell. Lots of alcohol in the taste as well. Nice roasted character somewhere back there but its almost completely overpowered the rest of it. Mouthfeel....eeeh. Over-carbonated for sure and it bites."
"A highly unique beer that isn't a stout. If you were looking for a stout or even a twist on a common stout this isn't it. This is an enjoyable beer with Belgian quirks."
"Pours up an opaque deepest brown/black with a massive, meringuey light brown head that stays around for a good minute or so. Nice lacing and stickage. Aromas range from a light dusty funk to cocoa/carob/chocolate with a light grassiness underneath. Belgian yeast character shines throughout. Not too much in the way of roastiness in the taste compared to most stouts, but it's there. Citric and tart, with fruitness lingering on the palate after each sip. Light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick but not heavy, a healthy carbonation keeps this in check. It's always nice to try stouts from Belgium because they retain some stout-like qualities but are uniquely Belgian."
"Poured into a tulip a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, huge foamy tannish head, nice big island and sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, kinda tart, bitter, good dose of chocolate/toffee/caramel. The taste is quite different from an American Stout, malty, but with some tart/tanginess, maybe some plums, figs, raisins, and some chocolate/toffee/caramel. The alcohol is barely noticeable in this brew. Medium body, well rounded/complex brew. Very drinkable, I really like this brew, highly recommended."
"I have never had a bad beer from this brewery and most have been very good. This one easily qualifies as very good. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitely mine. Despite the $4.49 price tag, a multiple bottle purchase is in my future. Extra Export Stout is Extra good."
"A driknable but not necessarily extraordinary brew given the price. Wouldn't mind having another though should the opportunity present itself."
"Pours a five+ finger light brown head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Black as midnight. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Burnt caramel nose. Flavor has some sweetness but burnt caramel dominates. Nice stout. $3.49 for a 330ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia."
"My notes got a bit sparser as this was the last beer of my evening, but I clearly remember the opaqueness of this beer. Aroma was of licorice and was a bit musty. Flavor was extremely grape-y and the beer had a very dry mouthfeel, much like a very astringent cabernet. not bad."
"black with a thick, dark, tan head. smells of something like a cross between raisins and grapes, java, toffee, chocolate, and sweet bread. tastes the same with a nice alcohol finish. just dry and bitter enough. creamy, but not like drinking syrup. nice little carb reaction when it goes in and down. great dessert."
"I have a pint glass and it took me three pours to finish the 11.2oz bottle. That should tell you how much suds are here."
"D: Intriguing, but not very sessionable."
"An outstanding dessert beer, one I would reccommend to anyone who likes theirt stouts flavorful and/or boozy. Not really a session beer, and probably not something to pair with food besides chocolate, but it's great at the conclusion of a robust, three-beer meal, and would probably make an excellent nightcap."
"I'm sure I'll have this again, but one is enough for tonite."
"This one is very interesting, very complex. But at the end, I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed with this one from one of my favorite breweries. Maybe I'll try it again another time to see if I have another feeling on another day."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is surprisingly drinkable for its size and character, but it's still definitely a sipper."
"D - A complex ale with many strengths at 9% it has the potential for havoc, so moderation is in order. It is subtle with nuance and can creep up with deceptive grace. Pleasing in aroma and taste, could be the quaffaable 9% dark ale I have tasted."
"D- This beer has great malt flavor and complexity and qualities from the yeast really add more depth to the malt. This is a great fusion of British Stout and Belgian yeast."
"Looks like liquid chocolate pouring out of the bottle, topped by a slightly over-enthusiastic head that maintains it's presence. Aromas are fantastic. Notes of coffee, black cherries, cocoa, and molasses dominate over the slightly spicy-yeast notes. Flavor is slightly sour up front, with great espresso and deep, rich dark chocolate notes on the finish. Slight alcohol warmth and a touch of sweetness before the palate dries out like day-old bread. There's juts a touch of bitterness in there as well. Really an unusual flavor profile, but I like it a lot. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for an export stout, but not surprising from a Belgian offering. Drinkability is also very good. I'll be buying this one again."
""
"I nice brew, a bit pricey, but I""m glad I tried it."
"Drinkability: this is a unique belgian beer that has great flavor, but the high alcohol is noticeable pushing this down in the category. Great beer on tap."
"at roughly $4 a bottle, this isn't an anytime beer, but it is surely something to be revisited from time to time."
"Drinkability is only OK for this one. I prefer more coffee and chocolate in an RIS."
"Drinkability: I could drink about a case of this stuff if I had more livers."
"This is ale is definitely Belgian first and a stout second. That being said it is unlike any other Belgian Ive sampled. In other examples of Belgian-stout hybrids Ive tried the flavors simply dont meld, but thats not the case here. Another masterpiece from the mad bros."
"Pours a hazy brown, thick tan head, nice lacing all over the glass and great retention. Smell is neat, dark currants, chocolate, some anise, very rich, roasty. Taste is chocolate and toffee, grapes, dark fruits, roast, bread. very rich again. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, some heat, nice drink. Thanks biegaman!"
"Pours a deep brown in colour - not black - with fluffy, chalky coloured head. An aroma full of dried fruit, prunes/raisins, molasses with light anise. Different for a stout, bordering a quad almost with the darker notes incorporated. Complex lactic sourness. An incredibly rich and sour mouthfeel as well, full of dried fruit and yeast. An interesting blend of yeast into dark malts. Yeast shines most through on the finish. Plenty of dry tastes alongside a lactic character. Interesting on both the stout and Belgian level of things. I've found the same qualities in this one as I have in my other De Dolle experiences. Interesting and different. Recommended."
"Was able to give this brew a try the other night as I saw another patron have one. The brew was very active as far as carbonation goes. No matter how careful and slowly I poured it there was an incredible amount of dark brown head. The pour took about 5 minutes to let things come down re-pour more in, etc. Once I was able to finally get the brew into a glass it was a nice looking brew, black as night with a thick chunky dark brown head that had very good retention and left a ton of thick lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was very nice, had clear stout aromas of chocolate, coffee, roasted nuts, mixed together with dark fruit and a earthy scent. I would imagine I could give more insight to the aroma but this is what I clearly remember last evening. The taste was great; thick feel with a high amount of carbonation that tingles the back of the mouth. The flavors where in line to what was experienced in the nose, but also with the taste of candy mixed with a peppery taste. The end seems quite dry with the right amount of hops. This is a very interesting brew and one I am glad to have given a try. This is my first introduction to de Dolle but now I must get out and find more. This is the type of brew that you want to slowly sip while hanging out with friends (which we where doing) or while sitting and relaxing, a slow drinker to really take in its properties and characteristics. Low appearance just due to the difficulty of the pour. Will change it if my next foray is better, besides that it was the high light of the evening."
"Drinkability/Overall: this is a great beer regardless of style or country of origin. Was expecting less stout character but was pleasantly surprised to see such a solid milk/sweet stout base. With the substantial booze, comes off as a lighter DFH World Wide Stout. Yummy."
"Poured into tumbler at 50 degrees. Beer was BLACK, thick and when I opened it the head tried to leap out of the bottle. Once in the tumbler beer kept a fantastic thick head that exuded strong black coffee. Tast was also strong for me, very chocolate, very high alc taste also and just a slight sour note. I think most stout people will like, but a little heavy for me so will not purchase again."
"Drinkability: A very nice and tasty stout."
"Pours a deep, rich midnight black, topped by a thick, creamy brown head that's going nowhere fast. Aroma of rich roasted malt, a touch of lactose, and a strong underlying mustiness (in a good, funky Belgian way). Palate is roasted malt up front, with a flash of lactose sweetness emerging after just a second. It passes just as quickly, with a light hoppy bitterness taking its place. The malt takes center stage again on the swallow, with some mellow notes of dark fruit peeking through on the finish. Body is rich and smooth, but a bit foamy it you're not careful. A delightful stout that is a nice surprise from a Belgian brewery."
"A lovely beer."
"Taste was all coffee and chocolate, and a pleasant balance between dry and sweet. Alcohol very well hidden, giving this one a high drinkability score. Some ear warming on bigger sips. Body is a little on the light side for a stout, which I didn't like that much, but not a huge deal."
"D - As usual, De Dolle doesn't disappoint. Drinks very well for a beer with this much punch."
"Pours dark chocolate brown with really big (nearly half a glass) chunky tan head, excellent retention and lace. The aroma coming off the beer is a little thin; sweet malts, cocoa, and spicy alcohol. Taste is something else, however. The mouth is quickly enveloped in sweet raisin and plum flavors. These are, in turn, replaced by an alcoholic carob, cocoa powder, and caramel center. The finish becomes super dry, with touches of hops and loads of coffee malt, chocolate malt, and burnt toast. Body is moderate to heavy, with some oily slickness and many small bubbles. Another great offering from De Dolle."
"D - The unbalance in the mouth doesnt help it. Overall decent but not great drinkability."
"Overall, I like the smoky rosted feel of this stout as well as its strong but not overpowering bitterness."
"One of my first beers in this style- overall very good and would enjoy again."
"Drink: Yes, very good."
"Drinkability: This is an odd little number of a brew. I was taken aback at first by the oddness but then warmed up to it as I drank it. Still, the almost-hybrid of a stout and a Belgian Strong Dark may turn some people off. And with that, I'd suggest NOT serving this in a pint glass but something smaller and more containable. And for $6 a bottle this is certainly something I wouldn't make a habit of drinking."
"Drinks okay, but after a while the 9% abv catches up to you. Not the best of this style, but not bad"
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied with a good bit of carbonation. Not bubbly carbonation, just the perfect amount. At 9% this one could take its toll after a few, but the alcohol is never a burden. Nicely balanced, and a very pleasant brew overall."
"Very reminiscent of a RIS with a slightly thinner mouthfeel. Notes of coffee and cream with a nicely bitter backbone coupled with some cherry cordial, chocolate and all. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in the finish. An excellent beer, and perhaps the first belgian stout I've had."
"Pours a dark brown, but not opaque. Ridicules carbonation leads to a huge head of large, brown bubbles. Heavy alcohol presence in the aroma. I feel drunk just smelling this one. Light mix of sweetness and toasted malt in the background. Taste is a mix of sherry and toasted malt. Very nice balance of the two. Alcohol is more subdued in the flavor, but is still present. As I drink, the alcohol aroma fades but is still noticeable. Aftertaste is rather smooth with a bitter/burnt tone. An interesting take on a stout. I am feeling every bit of the 9%ABV on this one."
"-a bit like unibroue's ""Terrible"" but better... my next closest proximation: the alchemist's knuckel dragger..."
"Jeez...there's a lot going on in this beer. Of course it's a bold and agressive stout, but that's just the beginning. Very big roasted and chocolate malts with a solid caramel, nutty flavor. Throw in some lactose for extra sweetness and smoother texture. But then, the Belgian stuff starts. Add some grape, figs, prunes, blackberries, and candy sweetness. Really projects tartness and sourness withouut detracting from the Stout-like character. Strongly stout and belgian from nose to finish. Moderately heavy, without thickening the texture. Strong coffee and berry finish and lingering. This beer was a lot of fun. Reminds me of some great Baltic Porters."
"This beer pours a remarkably dark brown color. Hardly any light gets through, even when the glass is tipped up on its edge. The smell is strong, with the most dominant smell being alcohol. There is a hint of chicory as well. The smell is huge. The alcohol whiffs down your throat as you swallow it, and really takes over the initial 25% of the beer. When the rest of it kicks in, its mostly a smokey chicory flavor. The last half is the best balanced part of the whole beer, when the two are married together and go down very easily."
"33 cL Belgian, bottle-conditioned with no freshness date. It pours quite black that at first is three inches of yellow/khaki head to one and a half inches of beer. As I fit more into the chalice, it becomes thick and craggy, and retains a half-inch cap that leaves some lacing. The aroma is intoxicating, with dark chocolate, cocoa, creamy milk, raisins, currants, grapes, lightly vinous malts, pink grapefruit, strawberry, and a light acidity, along with piney/leafy and citric/tropical hops. There are deep malt flavors (coffee acidity, roasted/charred malts) along with a medium, green hop bitterness that ebbs and flows on top of a thick and chewy body that manages to move lightly across the tongue, leaving a long finish. Overall, a great stout - I think I'm in love."
"D: Well, the beer started on a bad note and never really redeemed itself. I don't like that ""sour"" taste that some dark beers get. It tastes unplanned and tainted. The beer wasn't bad but doesn't stand up to US stouts."
"Not so drinkable... I have neither the desire, nor the ability to consume more than one of these in a sitting.... I think aging this one a couple of years might produce better results."
"Pours nearly completely pitch black with a monsterous tan head. Be careful with the pour because if you pour too fast like I did, you will have to wait a few minutes for the head to die down just to finish pouring the rest of the bottle into the glass. First go around, I got 1/3 beer and 2/3 head. Aroma consists of dark fruits, chocolate and cookie dough. The aroma definately lets you know this brew is Belgian. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated. Way too much carbonation in my opinion negatively affecting the appearance and mouthfeel. Taste is chocolatey, nutty and roasty. Alcohol is definately present. Overall, an interesting brew but not worth the $4.59 price tag to purchase again."
" I don't normally have a problem with the higher ABVs as long as they are done properly."
"Overall, I'd have to pass on this one again. What is the deal with the shitty luck I've been having with Belgians lately? I guess when you're used to drinking tasty, fresh stuff from New Belgium, Avery, Goose Island, and Unibroue it changes your expectations. It may be a bold statement, but this beer cements my opinion that North American brewers have surpassed Belgium, from where I live and what I can drink."
"Does not taste like any stout that I know. Has stout-like characteristics but is very Belgian (trippel? quad? quint?). Not my style, but a nice change."
"I really liked this one. The ash/coffee in the flavor is the only thing keeping me from absolutely loving this beer. Too bad."
"This one actually reminds me of something I just brewed not too long ago...a Belgian Bourbon Oak Imperial Milk Stout without the bourbon, lactose, and oak of course. Looking this up, I found many similarities, in fact, including many of the same malts used, close to the same OG, even used some Nugget hops in the aromatics that came about a total of 53 IBU's(calculated). I used the Westmalle strain that John at John Harvard's Wayne gave me. I did use over a pound of lactose though in mine and they used candi sugar. Many similarities by my own estimation without knowing much about this one until now."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is full bodied, but not unto the point of chewyness. The beer has a bit more carbonation than normal for export stouts. The beer is a pure delight to drink. It is all I can do to stop myself from drinking the other bottle in my cellar. This is a beer that will make frequent stays in my pint glass. Who would have thought that a Belgian stout would be like this? The Mad Brewers of course would make such a stout."
"A tad bit too high on the carbonation, more reflective of a Belgian than a stout. Other than that, the explosive head aside, this is a very well done beer and a nice stout overall."
"Overall a very drinkable beer. A fun beer to taste and one I'd recommend trying."
"This beer is an English style done with a Belgian flair. Cool interpretation of this style."
"Comments  I cellared this 2004 vintage in just-right conditions and boy oh boy did that pay off. Two years down was perfect for this stout."
"A unique stout that is highly drinkable. I believe that the bottle I purchased may have been on the shelf for a while. Given my intital impressions, I will certainly look for another."
"Why O Why don't they sell sixers of this at Wal-mart? Wish I had bought more than one, because Id love to introduce this to my friends. This is one great alcoholic stout and one to look for. Thanks to Mike Brawley for convincing me to try this one!"
"Wow Nelly, what a beer. This brew has a monster head: good lord the head is so thick and huge you could use it as the foundation of a house. IS this a milk shake? It looks absolutely beautiful in a a pint glass-exceptional. The smell is of roasted malts. The taste is very nice, roasted malts with a gentle bitterness. At such a high alcohol level, it is amazing that there is no alcohol tatse what so ever. A clean and pleasing mouthfeel. A very highly drinkable brew. Without a doubt, I have found a new best friend. Search for this ale and enjoy!"
"D - high, very tasty and easy to throw back, a good stout"
"it's fun to see how the belgians do stouts, just as, i'm sure, they think it's fun to see how we do americans. very complex with all the roasted malt flavors as well as esters and hop contributions"
"Very dark brown, chestnut highlights. It poured with a big, fluffy, tan head that fell quickly, but left a bit of clumpy lace behind. Chocolatey, lightly roasted aroma, a bit bready. Sweet, roasty, milk chocolate, with moderate bitterness and fruit. A bit acidic and salty in the finish, some spice as well. Some alcohol warmth as well. Creamy texture, full body, and a bit dry from the roasted barley. An interesting stout. Thanks HogTownHarry!"
"Overall, a very interesting and quite enjoyable take on a stout by one of my favorite belgian brewers. Defintelty worth a try."
"A truely different beer in the Stout Style. Pours out similar to a Dr. Pepper. Thin blackness produces a thin head of tan foam. High level of carbonation for this style. No lace. Aromas of sweet malts, chocolate, grain, berries, cinnamon and pepper. Amazing. Great aroma. Taste, not so wonderful. High carbonation attacks the tongue, and flavors of berries, sweet chocolate malts and thin husk flavors fill the mouth. Alcohol becomes present and provides a warming note. Carmel and coffee hints linger in the background. Definite belgian yeast character as well. Would be much better if it weren't so sweet. Mouthfeel was overly bubbly and excited; lacked real depth and thickness, but was interesting and playfully enjoyable. Drinkability is average. A cross between a carbonated soft drink and a stout. Unique. Worth a try."
"I think De Dolle might be my favorite Belgian brewery."
"Would not recommend this to stout purists, but this is a fun one, with as much character as any other big stout--but different from most others too. Looking forward to next time."
"11.2 ouncer sampled, pours with a HUGE dark tan head, puffy, fluffy and showing good retention, slowly calming down to a 1/4 inch head and leaving gobs of thick and textured lacing. Unusual and nice looking stuff. Exotic nose of chocolate, yeast, vanilla and tropical fruits. Strong stout, hints of alcohol, citrus (!?!), chocolate, cocoa, smokey tropical fruits. Complex, interesting artisinal creation. Looking foward to trying more selections from De Dolle."
"Very sweet and wierd, there's no way I could drink more than one. There's a lot going on, but not all of it I enjoy. Seems kind of twitchy, like the flavors change too quickly. Strange brew."
"Overall: A pricey stout, but an interesting one that's definitely worth finding to try."
"Why am I reviewing stouts at room temperature? mainly because i am away from home and the hotel has a very cold mini-fridge as my other option, but also because I believe a good stout will do well at warmer temperatures, possibly better than at 50F."
"Drinkability is only hampered a bit for me from the yeasty sourness that plays out a bit to much in the middle areas for a full quaffing experience. Other then that this is a very soild beer and a nice treat to wrap yourself up in at the end of a long day."
"Smoky aroma. Looks like a frothed up porter in the glass. Smoky taste to match the smell. Burnt raisin and charcoal flavor touches on both Imperial and Baltic stout flavors, but not really the style it professes to be. Thin palate. Not something Id seek out again, but interesting to see the belgian take on a Foreign Stout."
"Overall, I'm very impressed. Good flavors, interesting carbonation, nice high alcohol content. Bravo."
"Bottle poured a very dark brown. Thick head almost a full-blown brown color with large bubbles at the bottom and it thinned towards the top. Aroma was very sweet, alchhol present, small hint of roasted coffee on a deep inhale. Bottle says refermented in the bottle and mine was very carbonated. I could taste the dark malt, it also imparted a very rich roasted malt flavor with a burnt sweetness to it. I too noticed a little sourness to it as mentioned in another review, so thanks for helping me identify that charcteristic I couldn't quite describe. Finishes with a nice clean coffe taste. A very bubbly, dark, sweet stout that combines the roasted malt with roasted coffee. Cheers, Joe"
"A creamy, smokey, and robust Export Stout. One of the best tasting versions of the style I've had to date. Strongly recommended!"
"Other flavor included burnt malt and some chocolate too. Based on the price, I can't recommend this unless you love high alcohol stouts."
"Drinkability- Stouts from Belgium? Was a bit hesitant to try this even after I saw the good marks. Very impressive. I'd say this is just as good as the upper eschelon of stouts...period! Yummy and chewy. Get some today."
"Pours out a dark raisiny brown. Totally opaque. Smell is somewhat yeasty; reminiscent of a Belgian Brown more than a Stout. Taste is of a dry stout, lots of hop flavor with very roasted malt. Feels very much like a revved-up Guinness to me. Some coffee overtones but mostly roasted flavors. Not what I expected. Good, but I think I'll stick to the sweeter stouts that I prefer. Recommended for those who prefer a dryer, roastier style."
"Heck of a stout this is. Found it up in Belfast. Pours pitch black, can't see through it, thick head that lasts for several minutes. Powerful taste of burnt caramel, raisin and alcohol very prominent. Mouthfeel is quite thick. Overall it is pretty good, can only and have one per night if to be had on a regular basis. The most powerful stout I've tasted yet!!"
"Either way, a nice deviation from my normal selection and one I'd visit again."
"By far one of the best stouts I've had because It's not like any stout I've ever had. I really like the fruit undertones."
"Last swigs: Black coffee belgian. Welcome flavors that cover a vast spread of flavors."
"an interesting brew for sure. spot on for De Dolle again, one of my favorite producers for their spirit and talent. would love to be able to substitue 6 ounces or so of this after dinner instead of a coffee."
"Poured an opaque black no hue or light even when held up to the light with a huge blooming head that went over the glass whoo dont know where that came from.Rich aromas raisin and bitter chocolate really show thru with a tinge of that Belgian yeast lingering,kind of a prickly mouthfeel but the body was quite nice.Flavors are not overly sweet by any imagination bitter unsweetened chocolate and dark roast coffee dominate a touch of earth in the finish rounds this beer out nicely.Not a bas stout the alcohol is well hidden making it quite drinkable,I would buy again."
"As I said, it is the most drinkable stout I have ever had and if they werent $5 a bottle, I could definitely pound a few away in a session. Nevertheless, it didn't blow my mind. I expected some deeper flavors."
"Very thin looking dark, dark brown in color. One inch deep head with a brown hint to it. Nose is cocoa and licorice. Flavor is actually kind of disappointing. Some cocao, molasses and raisins. The alcohol is also a bit apparent and gives a rum-like flavor. Kind of a bitter bite from the hops that destroys any more flavors after the initial sip. Very thin mouthfeel and a bit of an alcohol burn. Kind of a struggle to drink and not too keen on Belgians stouts."
"Drinkability and Notes - This is an odd beer, not my taste in a stout or a Belgian ale. Certainly an interesting experience but I enjoyed La Maitresse Du Moine, a similar beer which has flavors that melds in a more pleasing way."
"dark dark brown with a THICK tan head. had a little trouble pouring this one as a matter of fact. well ok a lot. dark chocolatey and earthy vinous aroma with coffee. slight funky yeast aroma with vanilla and wood characteristics. every once in a while i get a whiff of something really funky like a fried egg or something, weird. also a hint of plastic or soemthing. sometimes you catch a little alcohol too. less sweet than the smell lets on with strong coffee and wood characteristics. bitter chocolate mingles with the vinous flavors, that mellows to a vanilla flavor at the back of the mouth. a little salty soy fades in and out. a little black locorice comes at towards the finish as well as some spicyness and some well covered booze. a little bit of yeasty funk every few sips or so. berry flavors come out about mid glass adding a nice complexity to an already complex beer. a hazelnut taste shows up around then too. the plastic shows up here in the taste too in a very small amount. slick full body with delicate carbonation. good drinkability, lots of flavors, none overpowering. very well balanced. belgian stouts seem to be quite an experience. try this it is a very welcome change from the typical imp/stout"
"No freshness date but II on cap. Great presentation with well lasting creamy head and coffeblack beer. Nose is delicate giving lots of chocolate in oaked strawberry/plumb jam and that in a wonderfull mixture of carramellic malts. Taste is good to but exceptionally chocolate like though litle overroasted cacao. This with a good oaked note and a litle funkyness from ferm/aging in barrels make it well drinkable but hard too get all flavours in the complex brew. Fine mouthfeel with good but for stout high carbonisation but migh oh migh what a rich taste. Litle hard and bitter but well recomendable IMO."
"Overall - A very good and very drinkable stout. Definitely worth a try..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slightly aggressive at first, then smooth and enjoyable. I can't imagine following up with another, but hell this was good."
"D: stunning and delicious extra stout by De Dolle... rather different from my expectation of an imperial stout in terms of aroma and a flavour gearing towards understated malty texture, but extremely beautifully balanced and mellow. The Belgians really know their beers pretty well, and this is yet another rare treat from De Dolle to all beer-lovers. Would buy some more to store for the future."
"Overall, a powerful and in-your-face stout. Pricey, but worth a try."
"D: I could not imagine drinking more than one of these in one sitting, with it's strong abv, and that it is a very filling beer. Since this stout reminds me of desert, one is quite filling, and more importantly more satisfying."
"You got to love the root beer float pour of a good stout. The alcohol flavor was strong on the pour with some hints of nuts and chocolate fighting through the booze. It is highly carbonated which was unexpected and it took away from the taste. As it warmed, its flavor profile came through much better - truly unique in the stout world. It has a bitter coffee and bitter chocolate flavor and the tartness of some white grape and cranberry notes. I had high expectations for this one and while it was good it was not great."
"The flavor is chocolatey, nutty, fruity (fig/plum), peppery, a touch candyish (bubblegum); backed by a solid bitterness and drying wash of alcohol. As it warms the carbonation softens to become silky smooth; the peppery spice fades; and the flavor widens. I'd suggest pulling this from the fridge and letting it sit for a few mintues before pouring... from there it'll warm naturally as you enjoy it (it's a sipper, not a quaffer!). It finishes lingering with a touch of creamy cocoa/hazelnut/mocha java (Isn't that an option for a Starbucks Gande?), some solid nuttiness, and an appropriate walnut-skin-like bitterness. A bit of metallic character appears later, and it has a phenolic burp as well, but neither detracts from its character."
"This is one of my favorite stouts. Between this and the Hercule Stout (also from Belgium), I am content for the moment with not having access to some of the bigger american stouts."
"Those wacky Belgians have done it again. I'd say this is a combination of a Belgian ""Special"" or ""Extra"" beer with an export stout. Pours out looking like coca cola. Lively carbonation that is just right. Smell is slightly malty. Taste... notes of bakers chocolate, subtle dark fruits, light red wine characteristics perhaps. Rich, full mouthfeel, nice tingling on the tounge. A very very drinkable beer even at 9% ABV. Well worth seeking out."
"Tastes of cola, bittersweet chocolate melted with a little water, burnt bread pudding, extra strong black licorice, raspberry jam spread thin on a toasted cedar plank. There's definite alcohol ""ohs"" in here: It's just shy of burning. Has a cola feel to it. It's not quite smooth, or creamy."
"Really a great extra stout, excellent drindabillity, and a very smooth mouthfeel."
"As the beer warmed a tad, the flavors become more subtle. Beer had a smooth full mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, I would have it again."
"I'll stick with the other beers."
"Ok stuff. An interesting brew at least."
"Another fabulous beer from De Dolle. I have not tasted anything of theirs that has ever been less than wonderful."
"Upon first sipping this beer it literally froth on my tongue from the ample carbonation, so I swirl a bit of it out. The taste is sweet up front with notes of burnt raisin. It finishes a bit hot from fermentation by products, which actually form an astringent almost bitter component that helps to balance the sweetness found at the beginning. This beer is really light on the palate, almost refreshing in character. I must say I am quite enjoying this beer, there is a nice roast coffee note in the finish that only appears after the beer has been swallowed. There is a combination of carbonation and yeast derived notes that give this beer a spicy, prickly, and perhaps a hint of a vegetal note. All in all this is a nice beer that really is quite intriguing and makes for a contemplative, complex tasting beer."
"Bottle: Poured a medium black color ale with a super huge bubbly head with excellent retention (maybe even so much retention that I regretted using a tulip glass to poured this beer). Aroma of subtle coffee and chocolate with great malt and Belgian yeast which give this stout its own personal aspect. Another great beer from De Dolle."
"Pours an opaque black with a huge cream-colored head. The head was actually too big, even though I poured this one very slowly. Aroma is a mix of cocoa beans, musty yeast, and notes of alcohol. Flavor is quite complex, beginning with chocolate covered cherries... then moving to roasted malt, but very minimal coffee flavor. The finish is dominated by alcohol, but it's not overpowering. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with low to medium carbonation, and a full body. This is a beer that is very interesting and quite tasty."
"Enjoyed as a 4oz sample at the Belgian Beer Fest 2004, oddly enough! Stouts, here? Pours a very dark,stout standard black. Head is moderate and off-white. Ruby when held up to the light. Smell is more alcoholic than most beers, and so is the taste. A very weird feel on the tongue, and I'm not a huge fan unfortunately. High alcohol doesn't go particularly well with stouts. Heavy and sharp, this beer is for some only."
"Now the beer: An enormous initial head, many moments later..aroma of coffee grinds. But this worked -the malts, the yeast - hand it to the Belgiums."
"note for those who serve this: let it SIT.. the carbonation tamed makes this MUCH better... pour it a goot 10 minutes before you intend to serve it.."
"Thanks for the hard to find De Dolle brew cokes."
"""Mad""? ""Indeed""! A dark black brew, that is nearly opaque. A nice top hat of brown foam lingers, and leaves sheets of lace. The aromas really run the spectrum between BSDA and Imperial Stout. Dark fruits, alcohol, plums, raisins, sugar, yeasty esters, bread, various exotic spices, and more. The taste is similar to the aroma and this is really complex stuff. There is a distinct roastiness in the flavor of this brew, but there is definately a lack of the coffee, and chocolate flavors that dominate in other US versions. This one is decidedly Belgian. A bit heavy in the mouth but quite drinkable for such an odd creation. Perfection? No. Impressive? Yes!"
"Red-edged pitch under a pudgy pocked cap of stiff foam. Spring brings chocolate blossoms over packed soil and wet dead leaves and raisins, still on the vine surviving hungry game and the cold edge of Winter. Charged charcoal brandy ignites the buds before slowly turning a bitter juniper crust. This stuff is hot on multiple levels."
"A foamy and rocky entry into the glass produces a gorgeous brown head that stays awhile. Hazy, yeasty dark ruby liquid. Sweet and roasty nose with hints of funky Belgian ""farmyard"" yeastiness...nice. Dark chocolate and fruity flavors blend with light phenol tones, some alcohol heat felt on the palate. Finishes up dry and chocolatey...very drinkable!"
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for this one. Pours a very dark color with an extremely tall head that has good retention. The aroma is sweet with hints of chocolate, but it's not very strong. The flavor is much more interesting with some chocolate and coffee goodness on top of a dark malt backbone. Good body and easy to drink."
"Holy foam batman. The head is amazing on this beer. Four fingers falls to a nice coating over thebeer after 15 minutes. The nose is not quite what I expect from a stout. Thre is a sweet cherry quality to it. Not so sure. The flavor is more chocolate and coffee than the nose would tell. The cherry is there on the finish, but subdued. I enjoy the flavor of this one more than the nose. The feel is nice and thick. No creamyness or silkyness, but just a nice thick feel. Overall, I am impressed with this as a Belgian stout. Its worth a look in my book. I'm looking forward to trying more from this brewery."
"A beautiful hybrid."
"Mouthfeel has a nice body to it with a slight creaminess..but the overcarbonation really throws me off. If this was a bit smoother it'd be much better in my book. I can't see having more than one of these in a sitting. An interesting stout that is well worth a try."
"that was the end of the review, most of the bottle went down the drain (slowly). positive scores for appearance, smell and mouthfeel shouldn't factor in, but that's how this system works."
"Drinkability is good. Obviously, very well-made beer a uniquely Belgian twist on the stout style. Very interesting."
"Pours a deep brown color-appears black until held to a light and then reveals a deep chestnut color. Extremely vigorous when poured-a huge head rises out of the glass. I had to reserve half the bottle until it receeded. Almost whiskey like aroma. Slight phenols. Sharp somewhat acidic flavor upfront. Belgian yeast notes. Pronounced whiskey like flavor. I miss the ""big"" malt flavor of a stout but then again this is a Belgian. Alcohol tends to come thru a touch. Good body. An enjoyable beer-the sharp whiskey and alcohol flavors tend to mar it a bit."
"This came courtesy of my brother-in-law. Many thanks to Todd."
"Deep dark brown in color, almost black. It forms a thick, creamy light brown head. Pretty good amount of lacing is left behind on each sip. The aroma is yeast and herbal like a belgian, with a candi sugar sweetness. It has a nice roasted maltiness as well, with just a hint of chocolate. The flavor is malty, slightly roasty and chocolatey. It is sweet and alcoholic as well with an herbal, yeasty characteristic. Medium in body, creamy mouthfeel, not too bad. A different brew."
"Taste...whoa! Bam-sham-a-lam! Forward flavor, hot and heavy, big on entry, and never ending...dark fruits, heavy molasses, anise, rich, almost syrupy, long, fiery finish. Brandy, cognac, whiskey, dark rum...delicious, deep, thick, massive, magnificent... I've got to get the local bottle shop to carry this...or do I? I can see this becoming a difficult, expensive addiction...yum...the strength is showing, and doing what it does...time to call it a night, but what a lovely way to close it...this is something else, a Belgian Imperial Stout, or so it feels...I've got to stock up on these, now that I've tasted it's glorious goodness, and have become an instant affirmed fan!"
" As beer warms it gains more and more tingling flavors. Mouthfeel is bubbly throughout and head retention is very good. As the beer reaches the bottom, the rounded characteristics of the water roll on the tounge nicely. Tastes very much like a licourice stout real quick on the tip of the tounge, then rolls down the tounge with a sweet, alcoholic warmth. Compared to other beers from Belgium I have tasted, it compares very good in the bottle catagory and is like no other style I have tasted."
"You definetly have to let this sit a bit and release some of the carbonation. it becomes a bit easier to drink, still very carbonted though. maybe worth picking up."
"A great job of taking a classic style and giving it a belgian twist. Taking a style and marrying to another is not often pulled off - well done De Dolle!"
"Drinkability: Interesting and quite satisfying; one of the pioneers of the Belgian stout style; I mis-understood this beer when I first tasted it a few years back but now I think of it as satisfyingly complex"
"Huge amount of greyish brown sludge in the top of the bottle neck. Tons of head foamed up all over the place, even though I had left the glass half filled, it still started to foam over... Dark rootbeered brown that you cannot see through. Vineous scent and taste, more towards a red wine. Light in the aroma. Very highly carbinated, too much for my tastes. This does not taste much like a stout, more towards a barleywine. Strange, it just seemed like one I would like, but it just did not work for me."
"Drinkability: This beer is just not for me. Not to my likings at all and I will not be drinking it again."
"So there you have it; get this beer some haldol. On second thought, don't. I've been critical of beers with seemingly scattered ideas of what they were. But every so often, there's something special that comes your way. And while it may not be John Nash, for a beer, it's pretty damn good."
"Near-black in color...only the faintest glints of ruby-tinged light are visible at the edges of the glass. Thick, long-lasting, lovely lacing tannish head lays it all out for your enjoyment. Aromas are dark fruit dipped in chocolate with some pine cone shavings. Flavor is wonderful. Front side sees chocolate-covered caramel and finishes with a toasted nut specialty coffee while chewing on more dark fruit. Woven into the fabric is a subtle spicy ""oomph"" that teases you as it appears and disappears. Modest warming effect from the ABV to put a smile on your face."
"A must try."
"Muddy dark brown, gentle light foamy head is a bit small for de dolles standard. Incredible nose, I mean.. the complexity in this impresses me. Roasted berries, apples, blueberries, there is a whole fruit basket in there. Woody, roasty. Gentle yeast hints come out with a mild dust touch. Significant alcohol presence remains blown away by the fruits. taste: A good bite in a roasted toast on which youve added a complicated fruits jam with a chocolate syrup. Hints at vegetal oil, grassy hops, wood etc. Medium body, a touch too carbonated for my liking. A medley of flavor which has no comparables. Cheers Casey!"
"Flavor profile is malts and malts. SOMe sweet chocolate and caramel plus the molasses mix with ripe dark fruit. A bit of warming alcohol on the finish. This is a big brew and quite tasty. Just a few of these would set you up for the nite I think!"
"This is a classic already. But sit on this for a year or so, and it may well be untouchable."
"Points for experimenting! But I'll never get it again. Fun to try, at least."
"Very interesting beer! Thanks to fellow BA Denali for pointing it out to us. Had in the bottle at Anam Cara. Pour was opaque dark chocolate, that came topped with a light white creme head. Aroma was very interesting: malt meets yeast. There was also some mustiness and cocoa powder in there too. Tastewise, it comes across as a Belgian stout (duh!): There's some initial yeastiness, followed by a roasted finish. Good mouthfeel, enough carbonation...if you like Belgian styles, or are a stout lover, you owe it yourself to try this unique beer."
"Overall I found it just a roasted bite away from a Belgian Strong Dark, which was not too much of a surprise. This beer deserves a far more interesting name, and frankly I am disappointed in the Mad Brewers using such a generic, not-mad-at-all name. But it is the beer that really matters, and this one is awesome."
"This is a one at a time dessert beer. Anymore than one at a time wouldn't do it justice."
"Great head first off. The nose in this beer is average,but that is the only thing average about this beer. Nice and dark can barely see through, a little bit of roast on the nose,but slight but you can definaley smell the malts. Rich and explosive in your mouth, sweet but balanced. This beer could be drunk in mass quantitys but at four bucks a pop, sort of hard. Hat's off for the first rich Belgian stout I've ever had."
"11.2 ounce bottle (33 cl). A very complex and interesting stout which offers tons of complexity and flavor. The ""Mad Brewers"" have truly gone mad with this one. I don't know what they actually put into the bottle, but I have three more in which to find out..."
"Appearance is pitch-black body with a giant tan head that keep coming close to overflowing. It took me quite a while to get the whole beer in the glass with the way the head was acting. Rings of lace were left around the glass as I consume this. Aroma was of sweet malt with a dash of alcohol over a roasted scent. The flavor was filled with chocolate malt with fruitiness to it of darker fruits. Alcohol was present as was a distinct licorice flavor. The taste ended of a roasty alcohol note that seemed to linger for a bit. Body was about medium and creamy with good drinkability. Good brew that I would definitely pick up again."
"This pours like a De Dolle brew. It has a beautiful, small bubbled, rocky head on top of an opaque dark brown body that barely fits into a 12 oz chalice (actually, it doesn't). The aroma is basil and liquorice with a sweet taste following more inscrutable spiciness. The mouthfeel is silky without the smooth anesthesia of a soft water beer. It's slippery and interupted by persistent carbonation. I'll drink this again. I will buy enough to cover a session and unwaveringly refill my glass until it's end of night time."
"De Dolle Extra Import Stout was served from a white and black labeled 330 ml bottle. In a Duvel Tulip, the beer was black, though with back-lighting the black became tinged with a ruddy-brown hue. It was topped by a vouminous creamy and fine tan head, which settled to an everlasting 1cm topping, leaving thick blankets of lacing. The nose was powerful and complex, presenting coffee notes, highly developed, spiced aromas of dried fruits (raisins, pears, cherries, apricots, raisins, prunes) and wafts of sasparilla. A fermented fruit alcohol was somewhat noticable as the beer neared room temp, but was very well melded with the fruits and roastiness. The taste was simply exceptional, opening with a roasted coffee-molasses flavor that quickly exploded with a fantastic grab-bag of spicy-roasty and vibrant dried fruit flavors (muscat/late harvest grape(!!), raisins, figs, cherries, apricots, plum). Licorice notes and a relapse of creamy coffee flavors appeared in the transition (joining the dried fruits) to the sharp-cola-chocolate bittered finish that left eternally lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and cherry...wow!. A little bit of alcohol was detectable, but it again it was so well melded with the flavors it was not detrimental at all. The brew was slightly warming in the tummy. The body was creamy-full and the carbonation was a tad fluffy, working very well with the flavors and character of the beer. De Dolle Export Stout is a delicous piece of work, and will be loved by fans of strong dark Belgian style brews. Excellent!!!"
"A failure? Absolutely not. But this needs work, especially if it is intended for the U.S. market."
"At the end, it is too ""normal"" to be a beer from the De Dolle Brewery. Maybe we can expect a little more."
