"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light tobacco, light char, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light char, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Foreign stout style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on even with the low carbonation. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall: delicious, drinkable and almost exactly amenable to my palate. Ba dow!"
"Feel: medium body and carbonation with more bite than it should have."
"If you like a really dark, and strong beer, this ones for you. I personally think its OK, I dont regret trying it. over all I give this a rating of 3. The taste gets better after a few sips. and it isnt a twist tot (which I like) and being imported from jamaica (thats the main purpose why i tried it) makes it worth it, to atleast try if anything."
"A large mocha head rises and sits top this ebony bodied liquid. With the top a darker hue, it looks like one of those beefed up imperial stouts brewed in the US. There's joy here, and the joy is coming through the nose. A very sweet note of chocolate, followed with booze and overripe banana. The taste is agreeable, interesting to say the least. It has a banana accent which gives up a Belgian impression, but isn't. Soft roasted malts taking a swim in chocolate and a kiss of fruitiness. Not much alcohol is noted. Regarding mouthfeel, it's medium-full bodied with a carbonation near soda level, let's cut that down some. As it stands, it's an acceptable foreign stout which is also relatively easy on the wallet."

"Not so refined, but that works in its benefit. A big, sweet Stout that wants to play with our palates. We wish more of these Foreign Stouts would hit our shores to further challenge the palates of US beer drinkers. If the locals in Jamaica have no problem drinking a hearty Stout in 85°F sunny weather, then neither should you."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some slight dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly sour bittersweet cocoa flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a slightly above average beer that is drinkable but I am not really enjoying the sour aspect I am getting in the flavor."

"O: the 7.6% ABV is noticeable, not a bad stout from a country that I mostly associate with Red Stripe and red hair but doesn't stand up to the more traditional European or more creative American stouts, perfectly acceptable though if you are in the islands and tired of lager"

"Enjoyable stout that packs a punch at over 7 percent. Nothing amazing but still worth a try"

"I didn’t have big expectations, but this is unique and pretty tasty. Worth giving a toss"
"& cheers!"

"Overall, I find this to be a nicely-balanced stout, full of excellent flavors and obviously the result of careful craftsmanship. The beer doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table--yes, there are fruity notes here, but those same notes are found in other stouts--but it does bring all of the flavors together excellently."
"Nice thick feel, but noticeable carbonation that eases as it warms. Really well done, I quite like this."
"Served chilled, in a bulb."
"A descent export here. Nothing simple about this beer. Hops come through nice without taking away the other flavors. Exports are a fun style with odd characteristics. This would be really good in the winter. Although it's even good in 99 degree weather."
"Mmm, not bad. Not quite a sweet stout and drinkable. I let it warm a tad before pouring and then it had a nice, thick, creamy, foamy, frothy, tan head that mostly faded fast and a little lace. Color is opaque dark brown except in the bottom of the glass where it's narrow and there I can see it's a clear garnet. Aroma isn't too complex, just basically what I'd expect to find: roasty, malt, toffee, cocoa, caramel. Flavror's more or less the same with a little sweetness balance by the roasty burnt and carbonic acids. Body is good, ditto carbonation. Finish is balanced too with a little booze and of medium length. A slow session so I don't get wasted."
"O – A very interesting and good stout, and worth a try for any stout lover, a quality stout from Jamaica! 7.6 ABV was not discernable at all dare I say sessionable. More fruity as it warms. 4"
"Overall- a pleasant drinking experience, I can feel the 7.6% ABV from this beer. But I think one is enough for one sitting of this complex beer. Drinkability is challenging."
"Not bad."
"Flavors of coffee, dark fruit, bitter roast, and a slight hint of alcohol. Lightly bitter and roasty aftertaste. Surprising not as sweet as the nose let on. A little thin and light on carbonation, but it's decent overall. Probably the best Jamaican beer i've had."
"D- My perception of this beer is that its has the profile of a regular american stout at 5%. Is it good, yes. Is it the beer that it's trying to be. Unfortunately, no."
"One hell of a decent strong stout - smooth, silky, and with an elevated ABV that is not at all noticeable. Freakishly good."
"Good stout, wish it was slightly more malty in the taste, but otherwise not a complaint to be had here. Very enjoyable."
"Big City Brewing Company, Kingston, Jamaica--Jamaica Stout--Proudly Brewed In Jamaica--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 7.60% ABV. 10 IBU's? (3.0 / 5.0) Sediment hint. Thin lacy tan head. Opaque dark black color. Fruity black cherry toffee toasted mild hop front. Mild sweet dark fruit chocolate hint mild citrus body. Mild hop EtOH hint lingering toffee fig end. Too fruity for me smooth Stout. Sampled 8/21/2010. 6-Pack $13.99."
"Didn't know they made decent stouts in Jamaica, but I guess that's part of the beer drinking journey. I had it on another one of our hot, humid days in Charleston, but it didn't leave me feeling bloated. To me, that's a definite plus. I got hints of chocolate malt and candy, with a slight hop finish. Taste was very malty, almost like a malted milkshake. Didn't really taste much hops at all, as well as no taste of alcohol. The appearance was the big disappointment though. Not much of a head at all, just kind of a spotty at best. Glad I gave it a try."
"Overall this beer is good, but a bit thin and has a very slight astringency on the finish."
"D - I believe that this could be an all night brew."
"It seems funny to me that the ""Jamaican"" style stout is so sweet and strong,its sustaining and warming,good for a cold winter day or night,not a Jamaican day or night.Poured a deep cola color with a tight formed one finger light mocha colored head.Sweet dark fruit and molasses in the nose,some roastiness comes through as well.Sweet and ""big"" on the palate the alcohol is prevelent,deep molasses tones as well.Its big and sweet but its not cloying,still puzzled by the style though."
"The body was full and satisfying without being overly heavy. Drinkability was very good for a brew of this size and strength. Certainly worth a try if you see it."
"I got more then I expected from Jamaica Stout with out doubt. I'm not saying this is a world class stout but it's nothing to be ashamed of and worth trying for sure"
"Taste: Similar to Great Divide's Yeti Stout in that it is very sweet and smooth without having a big roasty flavor like many other stouts."
"Drinkability: Above average and way above what I expected. A good smelling, but slightly watery and too sweet import stout. I enjoyed it, but by the end I was glad I would not be having another right away."
"Again, more coffee in this one, but it didn't develop throughout the bottle, became thinner. A surpisingly dense beer from a hot climate."
"Pretty drinkable stout! You can throw back a few of these without feeling weighed down."
"Overall this was a nice surprise. It's nothing earth shattering but it's certainly a better stout than I thought the hot climate of Jamaica could come up with. Worth a shot."
"Solid two finger head of rich brown creamy foam, whipped up enough to quickly dimple, admirable stickiness to the sheets of lacing. Impenetrably black colored liquid, sliver of copper at the outer edges. Plays up the roasted coffee, cocoa in the nose, licorice too yet not without its bitter side, chicory and celery, more chocolaty as it sits, the scents seem pressed together and thus you don't get much differentiation among them. Full-bodied and close to formidably dense, the carbonation slowly builds, pops and then builds again. There's a thick skinned quality to the dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee bean flavors, so robust it can't help but express itself but perhaps in a begrudging manner. Syrupy at times, however, no lack of hop bite and there's oats, pumpernickel and whole grain bread aspects. Ends with an allusion to rum, or maybe that's just the power of suggestion given its place of origin."
"Mouthfeel is thin and light, with a good bit of carbonation. This is not one I would go back to."
"D - I was very surprised with this beer at how good it was so far the imports that have come with the club have sucked but this is a damn good stout that I could drink a few of in a sitting worth finding to try"
"Pours a dark black with a thin brown head that dissipates quickly. The beer developed a good collar that remained with some decent laciness. Aroma is coffee and malt with some tones of alcohol. Taste was coffee and a little malt. A lot of bitterness with some sweetness and a hint of alcohol. Thick and viscous mouthfeel. Very good session beer, that does not sit heavy. Flavor is to my liking but may be on the bitter side for others."
"D - This is a tasty foreign extra stout and I think fits the style quite well. It's skewed a little towards a hop flavor, but it doesn't detract from the silky smooth roasted malt."
"D-Very tasty well done stout. I could polish off a few of these but beware at 8% alcohol this is not a session stout. Overall this is a winner."
"Not a bad taste. Licorice and chocolate with a black cherry aftertaste. Says it's 7.6% abv, but it is very smooth. You definitely don't notice the taste."
"Drinkability/Overall: surprisingly tasty and balanced for a random Jamaican export stout. The Bailey's in the nose is spot on and the taste has the dark fruits and char that I like in the style."
"BB sept 2006 7.6 ABV. Poors in with brown head that's instable and dissappears quickly. Black coffe underneath make it to good presentation. Smell is sweet, mellow roasted cacao but with amoniahint and slight citrusnote. Taste is very sweet, straw like and burnt and probably forgotten about adding hops as bitterness I get is burnt. Quiet heavy in oxidation though not doing bad to the brew but adding some creamyness. Still bit unfresh for me and quiet vegy after some more sips. Drinks OK."
