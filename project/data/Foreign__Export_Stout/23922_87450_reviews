"O: very nice; would pair well with a chocolate dessert;"
"FEEL: Full-bodied and a little on the chewy-thick side."
"Roasty, with excellent coffee flavors clear through to the linger. One of my favorites."

"wasn't much like a stout. I enjoyed the one I had but would not get again."

"A bland stout just a malty beer"
"It's like a thin roasted vanilla tobacco beer!  Pretty decent too."
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and is smooth at times as it has a nice drinkable feel. There is lots here with a nice balanced feel that just adds to the flavor that really wows."
""
""
""
"Overall: Killer stout from these Maine canners. Best as a dessert beer, I'd say, but not overly sweet or chocolatey - just a big, sturdy, tasty stout with nice accents of vanilla and cocoa. Might be my favorite Baxter beer."

"Not a bad beer, true to the style, I guess.  Less enjoyable than Baxter's other offerings though, IMHO."

"Good stout that doesn't standout. Good sipper, vanilla and cocoa nibs not pronounced, coffee and hoppy flavors more available."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is also vanilla based and malt forward with a slight bitterness to follow.  This is all over the map but all in all I enjoyed it."

"Overall: Aptly named dark stout. It has the strong chocolate and malt flavors of some big beers but without the high ABV. Got this in a trade so I'm not sure about the cost but I could easily drink more of this in one sitting. Pleasantly surprised with this one. Complexity you don't expect from a canned beer and very drinkable. Maybe my scores for this are a bit high due to the heavy stouts I've been tasting lately but I really liked this."

"Overall: An average to above average export stout. There is not anything bad about this stout, but not much jumps out to me either. That said it was a good sipper that I had a coupe of during a snowy football watching day."

"This beer is named after the 1965 Muhammad Ali vs Sonny Liston boxing match in which Louisville born Cassius Clay knocked Liston out within two minutes of the fight's beginning [link]. Appropriately so, this beer looks, smells and tastes so good but, man, if you drink a whole 6 pack, watch out cause you’ll get knocked out like Liston (har har). Really a delicious stout no matter you like dry stouts or sweet ones because it is the best of both worlds — it starts out dry and finishes smooth and sweet. Highly recommended!"
""
"Poured into a snifter. Color was a very nick dark brown that was completely opaque. Had a nice creamy rich mocha brown head, that left a solid layer with a little bit of cling. A fair amount of sediment was floating around the bottom. Smell was nicely sweet, lactose with a touch of smoke. Flavor starts with some roasty biter dark chocolate, then becomes a bit more bitter. A bit of acid that balanced out as it sat, but not quite as mellow as I would expect. Felt great in the mouth. Coated very well, pretty much as it should. Overall, the lack of balanced mellowness, and what seemed to be excessive sediment took it down a notch."
""
"I almost always gravitate well to anything dark when it comes to beer - especially anything Stout-related. But I keep trying these Export Stouts, and I just can't get behind them. Not sure what it is - the sweetness, fruit-quality - I don't know, but this is just not a style I will reach for often. I'll stick with the more roasted-forward stouts."
"Overall: This is a very good, easy drinking, chocolate forward stout that I wish was made more readily available to me. The flavors are deep and rich, yet this stout is oddly refreshing. Really solid, although not knock your socks of flavor. Recommended for a fairly session-able, full flavored stout."
""
"O: Not overly complex, but a nice tasting stout. Strong chocolate flavors mixes with roasted malts and a bit of sweetness to creat a nice beer."
""

"6.3/10"
"12oz can. Black with a smooth and creamy looking mocha colored head. This stays rich and frothy with some thick lacing. Smells of roast, cocoa, vanilla and weird hop presence that I guess is coming off like a kind of Noble hop? It definitely has spiciness to it. The taste is similar but does seem to do a little better, with a decent balance of roasted malts, a sweet combo of cocoa and vanilla and then a tingle of earthy and spicy citric hops. Dry and bitter on the finish with some lingering smoke. The feel is medium bodied with a crisp creaminess in the mouth that flows well. Just a smidge of warmth is present and this is overall pretty smooth. This was decent but the weirdness of the aroma kind of put a damper on things. I’d maybe check a can out of this but it really isn’t worth picking up multiples of."

"The most is medium with sharp carbonation. Overall not bad, nothing special though."
""
""
""
"O: This is awesome, kind of like a session RIS. Flavors of a big stout (oatmeal stout) without the super boozyness and heavyness. Right up there with Ipswich oatmeal stout as my favorite stout purchases. Highly recommended."
""
"Absolutely opaque black with an impressive brown head that settles to a sturdy top layer with serious lacing. Looks promising. The aroma delivers a nice deep chocolate malt with hazelnut coffee and some vanilla and some light herbal hop edges. I think it smells terrific. The first taste offers a bit more coffee heavy flavors, roasted coffee, almost burned grounds with a somewhat sharp edge yet the mellow, deep malt holds it together nicely for something that invites the big gulp approach. There's some subtle seaweed sort of grass hop in the background that makes it interesting along with a charcoal finish. Perhaps more notable is the near full body and thick, silky feel accented with a bit of fine carbonation sparkle for some contrast. I don't know, this seems like a pretty damn good stout and one I could drink a few of easily when in a malt-bomb mood. It's interesting without being especially complex and delivers the nice dark punch I look for in a stout. I'm quite pleased by this nice stout to ride shotgun to my favorite IPA, Stowaway. Nice work Baxter!"
""
"Coffee, black no sugar is the flavor. Thin for an oatmeal stout. Plenty of carbonation. The aftertaste is also of coffee. So, I'd say this beer is a bit one-dimensional, but it is fully flavorful and easy to drink."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid stout to pound down for a while."
""
"Overall very mixed bag. The oatmeal stout portion with vanilla and cocoa nibs was very nice. Then the crazy spicy earthy hops comes in like a ""phantom punch""... oh I get it now... but still that astringent bitterness with quite spicy chewy hops don't go well at all, and make the beer more like an American Black Ale (aka Black IPA), which I don't like as those flavors clash so much. Although the mint is nice, the rest of the hop flavors don't play nice at all."

"On the palate and mouth this stuff is richly coating and a full assault missile on the taste buds. Waves of chocolate, black coffee, and again vanilla. Thick and chewy. Big and brash. Not for the weak. Stout lovers go get some."
""
""
""
""
""
"On a side note, I like the packaging of the can with all of the places to take a canned beer around the rim."
"o - really solid stout that had some nice complexities. carbonation was great."
"Overall a lighter stout- but easy to drink and a welcome change from the stronger brews of this style."

"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, opaque, blackish color with a deep ruby highlight around the edges when held up to the light. Frothy, foamy, light brown head that starts a solid inch and a half on the pour, but settles nicely into a surface coating after a minute or two. Loose, clingy lacing along the glass as you drink. Aromas are sweet and rich, with a vanilla undertone and cocoa nib highlight on a roasted coffee main character. Flavors of rich and bitter roast initially, with a touch of campfire and char, followed by the darkly bittersweet cocoa nib. The vanilla characteristics only peak their head out here and there, in an attempt to lighten the heavy bitter and roast characteristics, only to be slightly overpowered. Rich, roasty, and bitter aftertaste, with the cocoa lingering on a bit through the slick, clean, and slightly dry finish. Very smooth and light in mouth. The ABV helpss make this a very drinkable beer, and the heavy flavors surprisingly do not build on your palate, leaving you a reprieve between each sip to recover and prepare for the next. Tasty stout!"

"O/D-Baxter is a very intriguing brewery. I absolutely love being able to grab a Stout in a can that doesn't cost $15 for a four pack . This is a feisty beer. Finely crafted. Its pretty awesome actually. WIth your purchase of $10 you are rewarded with a big, bad, brawny posse of six dark troublemakers. Hey Baxter, you just bought yourself a seat at the 'cool kids table' with this beer."
""
""
"Notes: Very drinkable and something to be enjoyed on a cold night this one will warm you up very well. Cheers."

"O - Had high hopes for this...stout in a can made with vanilla beans and cocoa nibs...sign me up. A little bit lacking in execution however. Heavy on burnt flavors and missing (or just overpowered?) the complexity and nuances that I was looking for and hoping to find here. Overall, just an average offering for the style...not terrible, but won't send me out looking for more either."
"Overall - This is just a ridiculously delicious stout, with great roasted and coffee character. it feels creamy up front but has a bite from the carbonation and hop bitterness. One of the best local-to-me stouts and has become a winter staple this season."
"OA - the tops of the Baxter line! I need to check these out packaged (cans?). Great offering!"

"O: A beer for malt lovers and fans of this particular style. I am one of those people and appreciate when a brewery can offer a beer like this and nail it on the head. In my opinion, Baxter has a very accurate representation of the style. Well done!"
"O: Its pretty good, a little bit of everything with this one. Some smoke, a bit of char, cocoa and vanilla. Overall, a tasty stout, with awesome artwork on the can."
""
"O: Pretty tasty, but the roasted malt is a bit harsh."
""
""
"Pours a solid dark brown/black color with a good sized tan head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Smells of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and roast with hint of dark sugar and ash. This has a light earthy hop aroma. The malt aromas in this are huge for the style. The flavor is bitter roast and earthy hop with bits of chocolate and caramel and a hint of vanilla, ash, and smoke. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet roasty mouthfeel. I was surprised by this one its really quite good. The vanilla is subtle but it adds to the chocolate effect quite nicely."
""
""
""
"The bottom end of the top tier of chocolate stouts IMO. Sweet can art."
""
"O: Pretty decent stout with a nice touch of extra complexity from the cocoa and vanilla. Creamy with nice drinkability. A little bit more vanilla would have balanced out the bitter roasty flavors better and made this really good, IMO."
"Solid stout with a very big and nice cocoa presence, something like a nice cocoa powder for baking. Vanilla shows up as well as the rest of stout flavors to round it all out and make this one hard to put down between sips."
""
"This is a fairly good beer. I don't buy too many six packs of stouts, preferring to get a single 22 oz bottle to enjoy over an evening, but I am glad I bought this beer. It's nice to have a local, seasonal stout. I may not get more of this beer this season, but I can see myself getting some next year. If you're in this area, you probably won't be disappointed with this brew if you're looking for a local and/or seasonal stout."
"O: A solid foreign-style stout with a great chocolate and vanilla profile. Doesn't overbear or get too sweet, and is very easy to drink given the 6.8%. Worth a try this season"
"Overall not too bad, has some great qualities, drinkable and certainly doesn't feel big at 6.8, well hidden."
""
""
"This is the first Baxter beer that I've ever had. I'm pleasantly surprised at how good it is, I could make this a winter regular for me. I really like the packaging too (cool blue can with red accents)."
"O: this is a very nice stout, very enjoyable.... I'd reccomwns it to anyone who enjoys a good stout."
""
"Overall this is a great tasting stout for a cold winter's night!"
"Pours a dark, dark brown with a light brown head. Plenty of lacing once the head dissipates. Smell is not too strong, but you get whiff of roasted malts, chocolate and espresso. The taste consists of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Slight metallic taste probably from the can. Medium body with some carbonation. Sticky on the lips too. A decent local stout, but I think it could be a lot better."

"Poured from the can into a pint glass. Pours black with a thick deep tan head crowned by a light tan center. Head lingers and becomes quite fluffy. The chocolate aroma hits first followed by a roasty malt. Vanilla is very faint. The taste is dry roasty chocolate with a bit of an alcohol finish. A thin body that leaves you wanting to take another sip. Very nice"
