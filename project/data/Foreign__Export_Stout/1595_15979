3.66,10.6,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"I picked this up a few years back in New Zealand on my way down to Antarctica. I remember thinking it was much better than the light lagers we had access to down at McMurdo Station. I still think it is a solid beer, though by no means an Import Stout. Really this falls somewhere between a stout and a black ale with the simpler flavor profile and lighter mouthfeel compared to a traditional stout. Still, it hits the spot and is highly drinkable. I would get a few sixes (about $10 each) of this if I get the chance to go back to the ice.","Bockrules","Aug 05, 2013"

2.87,-13.3,3,2.75,3,2.25,3,"Overall: Not too bad, especially from a 'macro' brewery that normally produces standard adjunct lagers, but not nearly as full-bodied and complex as a good stout should be. Definitely more of a sessionable stout.","machalel","Nov 29, 2012"

2.12,-36,2.5,3,2,1.5,1.5,"O: An example of what an average Australian thinks a “stout” should be. Coffee, roasted malt and a milky mouth feel that completely confuses with a super dryness sucking your face off. Going in for another drink is the only way to remove the barren milk scum feel, followed swiftly by the cold coffee and burnt malt. Desperate times call for desperate measures it seems.","MsNitch","Jul 07, 2012"

3,-9.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Havnt had this for ages and after going to my nearest country local there was not too many dark options anyway it pours a dark black hue with a fast vanishing two finger head and hardly any lacing,the smell is roasted barley,toasty malts,a slight fruitiness,kola and dark cocoa nibs,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and suprisingly not as bad as i remember although i do like a thicker mouthfeel in my stouts but for a macro effort not bad,the tastes are pretty simple with hints of roasted barley,black coffee with no milk,a herbal fruitiness and finished with a dark chocolate bittersweetness and overall its average but alot better than i remember it being and i am just glad that the Macro Squad have not forgotten their dark beer lovers as its definately a better option when faced with only a macro range as there is def more to it than their usual lineup cheers.","ADZA","Beers"

3,-9.4,3,3,3,3,3,"D-- At 5.8% it is very drinkable. It is a bit hard to find as Coopers Stout really dominates the market in Australia. Still, this is a good stout. It has some weak points but this is an enjoyable stout. A workable offering from one of the big breweries in Australia. With a little more body this would be very good.","mulder1010","Jul 18, 2011"

3.95,19.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O - This stout suprised me a lot and is probably just behind Southwarks and Coopers Best Extra as the best off the shelf mass produced stout in Australia.","eric5bellies","Feb 19, 2011"

2.45,-26,3.5,3.5,2,3,1.5,"I've said it before; I am not a stout drinker, I would choose a porter over a dry stout any day. That said, I still think this qualifies as sub-par. It only really has one flaw, but that flaw (overly burnt bitterness) completely ruins the beer for me. It's not priced badly, but after this experience, I probably won't be getting it again.","LittleCreature","Nov 24, 2005"
3.62,9.4,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,4,"Pours a very thick dark black/brown. I can't see any light through it at all. There's also about an inch and a half of creamy tan head that fades away to leave a nice layer that clings to the glass. Smells very chocolatey and coffeeish.. A nice roast aroma. The taste also has a lot of chocolate and coffee in it, and some hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is fairly watery and a little harsh. All in all, it's a really drinkable stout.The price is right, I'd probably get this again.","Kulrak","Jun 20, 2005"
