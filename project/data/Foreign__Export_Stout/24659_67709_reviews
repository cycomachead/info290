"O- Very hopped up Export Stout, I would have liked a bit less bitterness but the nose and flavour profiles are otherwise on point. Nice body, too."

"Can from trade. Thanks! Pours pitch black with a pretty creamy looking one finger dark khaki head. Aroma of coffee, roasted malts, some sweet molasses, a hint of hops. Flavor follows with a nutty note, some roasted coffee, roasted malts, sweet molasses and lightly bitter chocolate. Nice balance of the sweet with a slightly bitter finish. Super smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied, with medium carbonation. This is a really nice beer."

"O: Thick and creamy with plenty of char, would be outstanding with BBQ meats."
"Smooth and roasty with coffee notes"

"Overall- This is incredibly well balanced with the chocolate being perfectly sweet and the malt adding just a touch of needed bitterness.  Very enjoyable and easy drinking, and definitely worth seeking out."
"This stout is legit and true to style. Reminds me of Western European stouts I've had. Noice!"

"This is a big, strong, bitter,  but pretty traditional stout. It would be a great option for a daily drinker kind of stout - think a much bigger, bolder, and better Guinness. It's not super sweet, so it's not much of a dessert stout."

"Huge stout here, perfect for winter. Grain from caramel to coffee and bakers chocolate. Roasty and toasty with a Denice palate encompassing expansive feel and a touch of out sweetness in there too. The abv is right on as well. Any bigger it would be hot and slow, but as it is it drinks easy despite being huge. It's a great cold weather four pack, and is just filling enough to be warming, but is almost refreshing when cold. These guys might be one of the best unsung breweries in the country, this is good as their hoppy stuff, which is insanely good. Nothing but excellence from these guys in my experience so far. A very distinct and well built stout. Yummy!"

"Very dark grains bring on a super dark chocolate feel that brings along a substantial bitterness. Drinks perhaps a bit bigger than 7.5% but still flavorful and nice as a tallboy."

"Overall - Kinda reminds me of big bold imperial stouts like Old Rasputin, Expedition, Ten Fidy; lighter in alcohol but almost equal in dense+intense roast/dark chocolate. Definitely not an everyday stout, but if you dig this kinda thing it's sure to please."

"This pours a roasty black in color with tight foam lacing atop. It has a great roast aroma full of dark chocolate & cocoa nibs. On my first sniff i picked up layers of roast, toffee, toast and roastiness but after tasting the flavor comes across on my palate, muting the complexity I found in the aroma. Don’t get me wrong, it’s just the nuances I detected while inhaling are now nuances I find on the palate. Lots of roast, lots of toast, and a wonderful dark coffee/dark chocolate flavoring. It finishes dry and goes down smoothly. Not a hoppy stout but there is a pronounced bitterness giving it definition. Thinner bodied than I tend to prefer but utterly tasty nonetheless."
