"Flavor is roasted malt and dark chocolate.  I think it is a little dry on the finish but no real hints of booze.  Im not sure if the dryness is imparted by the oysters or if they do something else that I am missing.  A nice solid drinkable stout with a fairly high ABV at 7.5%.  I would buy this again even though im not sure what the oysters add to the beer."

"Overall: A more robust oyster stout. With a great approach. Uncertain which I prefer more Dogfish at 5.5%  or Exit 1 at 7.5% - depends on occasion. I give the edge for pleasure to Dogfish and for flavor density but that the cost of a higher ABV to Exit 1. Try them both!"

"I haven't given Flying Fish much thought due to the fact that their beers sit on shelves here for ages at Total Wine, but this beer has convinced me to give them another look."

"Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Little or no alcohol bite. A good tasty stout/"
""
"O- This is one of the best examples of the style, largely due to the fact that the contribution from the oysters are absolutely present in all aspects of the beer: nose, flavor and mouthfeel. I would, however, enjoy Exit 1 a bit more if it possessed more substantial (i.e. chewy) body...mashing at a higher temperature would achieve this result, but more malt would need to be used to achieve the same ABV. (4.5)"

"O- This has been a want of mine for a while only because, when the Exit series was first rolled out years ago, I wanted the Exit 1 entry just to add to my bottle collection because I'm from Delaware. Never found it the first time around and they stopped making it for years. When I heard they were bringing it back on the market, and in 6-packs no less, I had to get my hands on it. Found a sixer when I was visiting home and, come to find out, the beer itself is really good too!"

"O: Interesting beer. Saltiness, chocolate, roasty bitterness, coffee, even some fruity sweetness. Complex, almost busy flavor profile. Not something I'd be falling down to get again, but I wouldn't turn it down, and would definitely recommend it to a beer connoisseur to add to their repertoire."

"from 12 ounce bottle to pint glass. pours black, tan khaki head, no light coming through. aromas of roasted malt, coffee, hint of alcohol. flavor is well balanced, some burnt malt, medium mouthfeel, slightly dry and creamy. goes down nice, well balanced"

"O - 4.0 - I like this beer, it's a nice change up from all the coffee stouts/porters, and russian imperial stouts/BA RIS's that are so popular now. They used the oysters in the boil which they said gives the beer a nice dryness."
""
"O-  strange, briny, smoky, weird."

"Ditto for the booze. This certainly wasn't a session beer but you'd never know it until you looked at the bottle. No roasted, heavy motor oil to be found here. While this was a Foreign/Export Stout, a beer like made me think that Oyster Stouts should be in a class by themselves. This was thin enough to go down smoothly but solid enough in body to savor and once again, Flying Fish has outdone themselves with this latest entry in the Exit series. Find this, open it, and savor it - it's a lot better (and possibly cheaper) than taking the Turnpike all the way down to its southern terminus. Highly recommended."

"O: My first Oyster Stout and it was a memorable one. Try this for a fresh take on stouts."
""
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amoubt of carbonation. It is a fairly decent export stout with the expected mineral/saline character present from the oyster aspect. I think I held on to this brew too long, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt that it was probably a beer best served more fresh than this."
""
""
"O: Another really enjoyable beer from the Exit Series, I thought this was a really easy to drink oyster stout. I loved the brininess combined with burnt and heavily roasted malt flavors."
"O: This beer is very light and easy to drink but has a good amount of flavors."
""
""

"O: Really enjoyed this guy. A- to A beer."
""
""
"O - Overall a good stout...a bit different flavor profile, perhaps from the oysters, but there is nothing oystery about this beer...maybe a bit minerally, but that is it. Quite charcoaly,roasty and chocolately. Goes down fairly easily, but not something I could go thru more than a bottle in a session."
""
""
"A really great stout with the bonus of being of the Export style and oysters added for is pretty mellow but enjoyable depth. I'd love to seem them bring this one back."
""
"O: Great beer. It has fantastic dry coffee finish. I love that. Must be from black patent or the like. I really enjoy the roastiness. I also enjoy the sweeter upfront taste although would like more milk chocolate in the taste that was noticed in the aroma. Good stuff. Aging didn't make this beer worse. It's great."
""
""
"While Exit 1 may fall short on individual characteristics, it is easily drinkable. Perhaps not a typical session beer given its 7% alcohol, paired with good friends and nursed along in a Dogfish Head snifter, one could make a long lazy afternoon more enjoyable."

"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a nice flavorful stout to pound down for a long time."
"This is an easy drinking brew, but overall the flavors could have a bit more presence. Kicked up a notch, this would be an exceptional brew. As it stands now, this is definitely a worthy brew that I am thoroughly enjoying."
""
"Not my favorite stout but far from bad. Overall, a pretty average beer that could benefit from more complexity."
"This beer poured out as a heavy thick looking black color with a nice slow rising brown colored head on top. The smell of the beer was pretty good, lots of roasted malt aromas and some chocolate in there too. The taste of the beer is pretty good, lots of roasted chocolate flavors and just a very slight spice note in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth, thick and creamy. Overall this beer didn't smell or taste anything like Oysters thankfully. I found this brew to be really quite nice."

"Overall this is a good brew. Very drinkable and a nice sessionable brew. Just nothing that will bowl you over. Good stuff."
"Sweet is begin and then Tart with a little hop finish"
"O - This is a really tasty Export Stout. I like the Exit series from Flying Fish."
"D: the smoke/salt nose and palate is very interesting. im not exactly sure what i should expect with a foreign export stout, but this seems like a cross between a smoked stout and a RIS. im digging it."
"The ""export-style"" quality of this stout seems a little lost to its oily, salty, clam-juice nuances. Nullifies whatever malt-sugary-sweet elements may be present. Superb balance of roastiness, mild dark espresso, and depth of body, however. Clean, lightly saline, and slick-smooth. Lacks the heavier feeling of most of the export stouts I've had. Would've wanted a little more syrupy feel but I can't complain about what it offered. The keg was well over a year old and it suffered not. Begged attentive sipping. It was black. No head - English-style pour, heh. Quaffable for sure. Studious, refined, but it didn't dazzle the senses. Surprisingly enjoyable coming from FF. Do more like this."
"Overall: Nothing I'd seek out again but nothing offensive either."
"i would love to get another one of these. I personally think it falls under a stout from the roasty ness. hardly any alcohol detected in this one."
"D - Very interesting, but the complexities seem to be overpowered as the beer warms by the chocolatey malt and alcohol. I think this would be nice with some creamy stew."
"D-Totally solid and a very nice job done with this rare style. Glad to see them use local product for this beer as the heyday of the oyster industry in NJ is a distant memory to most. Well done FF!"
"Jet black with a hearty one finger head that hung around a bit. Good nose of... well... stout! HUGE fan of oysters so I was curious the effect that the oysters had on the dark bitter chocolate, roasted grains and malt and they definitely make this a very dry stout I can lash back all nite long, love the smokiness. Expected a bit more brine from the oysters. Down the hatch slick and slippery just like a sweet Jersey oyster. BIG fan o' this brew... wish it was a everyday release from the Cherry Hill fellas. Would love to try this on draught."
"D) A good stout. Thick and chewy. I'd have another."
"D - Not super drinkable, its one of thos ebeers that kind of intense in its overall character. One is enough."
"Rich, dry, chocolaty, and very drinkable, this is a very engaging beer. It's a deep black color with a thin, chocolate-milk head. The aroma is a little subdued, although some heavily roasted grain scents do waft out. The flavor is very nice...dry, intense, lots of dark malts and intensely charred grains. Very little hop flavor or aroma. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and silky, with a medium body. Altogether, these components make this a wonderfully drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is medium. The carbonation is light. The beer was easy to drink and an above average beer. Many thanks to Sholand for sending this beer to me."
"D: A nice deep winter beer. It's freezing out, so this beer is perfectly drinkable to me."
"Overall this is a very nice stout but not my favorite example by a long shot. I wasn't prepared for the smokiness (I hate smoke beers as an FYI) but this is still quite nice despite my typical preferences. I really enjoy these Exit beers and look forward to the next one."
"Taste reflects the nose in the flavor profile with additional black licorice in it. Sorry, but I can't get past the unusually dry & gritty, almost calcium filled dryness of this beer. I had to end this bottle prematurely..."
"M/D - A touch on the light side but still medium bodied. Maybe a bit week by Export Stout standards. An above average stout and certainly easy drinking, but nothing fantastic."
"A gem from Flying Fish."
"750ml bottle. Pours a completely opaque black with a decent, fizzy brown head, good lacing. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruits, and bread. Flavor is roasted malts, coffee, a touch of chocolate, spicy hops, light smokiness, and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side of medium, roasted bitterness, low carbonation, and salty. Good beer."
"I wanna know who first thought up the idea of using oysters in beer. Just seems odd to me. Oh well. This guy pours an oily black topped by a finger of burnt sienna foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate, mint, and molasses. The taste is very similar, with some brown sugar, coffee, figs, and blackened pretzels (you know, the bottom of the pretzel...it's the char, the dough, and the salt altogether here) thrown in to make things more interesting. The body is a fairly hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly smooth, rather dry finish. Overall, a nice oyster stout, but I'm not sure I'm fully used to the style yet."
"HV"
"Notes: Nice oyster stout with a shy, and expected salty touch profile. Again if one is expecting the oyster burst this is not the brew. But for a balanced offering with a bit of a sea touch it is rather pleasing."
"Beer is really good, medium bodied, clean and sweet. Lots of malt up front, a very good stout. I'm liking these foreign export stouts more and more. Good mouthfeel and really high drinkability."
"Drinkability? It's easy enough to drink. The big bottle will not be a chore to drink and given the opportunity, I'd enjoy it again as it IS tasty enough and there's no sign of the alcohol at all. Again, I just expected more."
"Pours a black color with a brown dense creamy head that settles into a thick ring. The aroma is big on dark bitter chocolate, charred wood, and light smoke. Nice and earthy. The taste is of bitter amd milk chocolate, roasted malt, and light charred wood/smoke. The body is light to moderate, seems a tad thin for the style. The carbonation is fairly soft which adds to the creamy texture of this stout. Finishes with a roasted malt bitterness. Definitely a tastey stout, though a bit thin. Nice chocolate and roasted malt flavors. Didn't pick up anything from the oysters, which I believe usually adds a mineral characteristic. Indeed worth the purchase, very good."
"The mouthfeel is a little thicker then average with moderate to low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it had some very nice stout flavors. Like the other oyster stout I've had, the oysters really don't give much flavor to the beer. They did seem to give it a little something in the aroma though. The beer really is all about the stout flavors, which thankfully are pretty good. I liked the roasty and bitter chocolate flavors it had a lot though."
"Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable stout where the lightness of the mouth feel and texture give a nice balancing effect to the dark flavors form the malts making it quite easy to keep sipping through this one until it is gone. While I may have this one again, the fact that it is a one-off brewing will limit the number of times I have it in the future."
"D- I can definitely see this going will with oysters. Again, the carbonation issue affects the overall drinkability."
"Great offering from flying fish I would pair this with obviously oysters but also other fried seafood perhaps calamari or the like as the briney flavor would be phenominal with this beer."
"For a stout, the drinkability is very high, but only because it doesn't feel at all heavy. Definitely not what I was expecting. I was looking forward to a tinge of salt-water, but if no one told me oysters were used in production, I wouldn't have guessed it myself."
"Drinkability- you can drink this stout easily considering the abv being so high but the complexity just falls flat for me, to thin and watery though the flavors it does present are all right, i cant picture if I was gonna drink something with this high of an abv i would settle for one this simple, again and okay beer but so many better stouts out there, flying fish to me usually makes okay beers but really never great"
"A great roasted malty sweetness on 1st sip. not overly rich, but not a heavy mouth feel, kind of a chocolate mixed in. The hearty, roasted stout taste permeates. Hints of malt, smoke and wood in the finish. This was a really satisfying stout, and the balance with the taste is fine. I hope this comes out more, because I really enjoyed it"
"Overall, I thought this was a tasty and unique stout. The flavor has a few nice touches that you don't get in your average stout. A better mouthfeel would have pushed this to an even higher score. Would love to be able to pick up this beer again."
"Overall, a solid stout that packs a tasty malt punch. Good body that's not too heavy and nice flavor. Glad I had a chance to try this and thanks to Josh for sharing this one!"
"My first ""Oyster Stout""; as advertsied, I think this would pair fantastically with Oysters or a nice, hearty stew."
"D - Very nice dry stout with a subtle hop character and smoked quality. I found this to be up to the normal standards of the other Exit series releases."
"A tasty and well crafted stout - thanks for taking chances Flying Fish!"
"I poured from a 25 ounce bottle into a snifter. It is obsidian black with a rock solid mound of foamy head. The aroma is rich, roasty and full of chocolate. The flavor is full and has lots and lots of chocolate malt in it. It is very smooth and easy drinking. I don't know if the oysters added anything to the beer, other than curiosity. Overall it is a solid, interesting beer that I just may purchase again."
"Exit 1 (the third in the series) is more interesting than good. Maybe Flying Fish felt that a darker, bolder, richer maltiness would have crowded out the oyster flavor. It might have, and would have required a name change, but it would have made for better beer in the end. Thanks to jwc215 for the bottle."
"So far, this has been a good Beer Series for FF and I hope to try some more."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1/4"" dark brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head lasts nicely, with coating lace. Aroma is roasty dark sweetness. Taste starts with chocolate, light to moderate bitterness in the middle, creamy close, with a slight salty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, maybe a little thinner bodied than expected, not in a bad way, and drinkability is easy. Good stuff."
"Pours a deep brown, almost black color with a big brown head. Roasted coffee bean, smokey, notes of chocolate and a mild saltyness in the aroma. Light bodied, all texture here from the oysters used, cand say im a fan of the grainy/ashy texture but its there like it or not. Very dry and light, i could see this beer showing better when paired with food."
"Drinkability - I liked the clean finish and the lightness of this offering. Made it very drinkable and would work well for a stout session beer. At 7% ABV, this could get dangerous. Well done again Flying Fish on yet another great Exit Series offerings."
"Exit 1. Opaque black pour with a tan but almost orange head.  Smells like a stout, dark toasty malt.  Smoky dark malt flavor.  Can't pick out the oyster though I wish I could!  A solid stout at a fair abv for the flavor, though has plenty of room to either intensify the flavor or drop the abv."
"Poured into a chalice a nice black color, nice carbonation, small tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some coffee/toffe, slight brine note, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, nice touch of coffee/toffee. Medium body. Drinkable, it's better than I thought it would be."
"D - very smooth and light enough to drink alot of, the saltiness does keep me from going for another. Its good, but it sort of reminds you of a very very light salt water gargle."
"Toasty medium body with lots of roasted chocolate malt, burnt toast, licorice, oatmeal and toffee. There's also a good bit of coffee bean that adds to the smokey/roastiness. The body is slightly thin but it's still pretty complex and very drinkable considering how roasty the malt profile is. There is a subtle saltiness(from the oysters) thT is not overpowering but compliments the chocolate and roasted notes very well. Slight lactic creaminess provides nice balance and makes it pretty quaffable. Probably the best beer I've had yet from Flying Fish."
"D - A decent stout w/ pretty high drinkability, however it is slightly dry for my taste and bitter finish for the style, but I would not hesitate to return to this if given the chance."
"D: pretty nice, I've had better, but I've had worse. Enjoyable overall."
"A: Pitch black in color, thin layer of head, appears to have some viscosity - 3.75, S: Dark bitter chocolate aromas as well as some pudding, a good deal of charred grains and peat - 4.00, T: Lots of roasted grains and ash, a dark fruit sweetness, slightest hint of brandy soaked fruit cake - 3.50, M: Extremely silky and smooth, wonderful mouth feel - 4.50, D: A very drinkable and enjoyable beer, kudos to Flying Fish for a successful Oyster Stout - 4.25"
"Drinkability: Relatively light compared to other big stouts, and that adds to the drinkability; very nice, with subtle differences; like other Flying Fish brews, they may not be the biggest, but they are very drinkable"
"750ml bottle acquired from caresville (thanks Chris) and served in my Allagash 25cl chalice. Pours two shades shy of black with some red highlights around the edges. A half inch, mocha-colored head dissipates into a skim with some spots on the glass. Head was refreshed with a swirl of the glass. Nose is roasty with a hint of lactose and coffee/cocoa. Taste follows nose with the addition of a touch of brininess that comes out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild and even background carbonation. Easy drinking and similar to a milk stout in my opinion, with addition of the briny oyster quality detectable at the finish. Well worth a try."
"Really wish that I had this with a strong complimentary cheese, or something else to help cut the heavy salt profile. I may have enjoyed it's unique qualities a little more."
"Oysters lend a touch of brine/sea salt and the rich chocolatey maltiness would have this pair well with oysters. Unfortunately, I didn't try it with oysters, but I'm seriously considering getting another bottle to test out my theory that it would work very well. A unique offering that has a solid foreign/export stout character. Grab a bottle if you can!"
"This was handed to me with a finger of deep-brown head interlaced with black and shifting around like Rorschach's mask. It eventually settled into a slick of brown foam on top of an inky black beer. Its color was midnight black with ZERO light penetration. The nose had notes of coffee, chocolate, mocha, and even a bit of charcoal. Mouthfeel wavered between medium and full with the coffee and charcoal up front followed by a more mellow mocha sweetness and a dark chocolate finish. Owner Gene Muller stated that they had never before made a stout and I hope that they do not stop now, by golly! It was a phenomenal entry in the series, even if I have missed a couple of Exits in my journey."
"I would have really liked this had it been in a smaller bottle or I just had one glass on tap. All in all, I liked the char and the coffee, but the oysters grew and grew to be too big for me. Fairly drinkable."
"Drinkability- Well definitely a tasty beer but not what I was expecting. I guess in my tiny pee brain I actually thought there would a fairly noticeable oyster taste (I love oysters). The beer is good and it's a great Export Stout. The mouthfeel is impeccable and definitely the best part of the beer. Good stuff all around, thanks Jeff!"
"D: Enjoyable drink, refined, smooth, though found myself oddly enough wishing for more of an oyster presence. Felt they may have played it a bit safe here and could of made a statement of definition per style. Many people may be turned off by the notion of an Oyster stout, but fear not, this has very little presence, mostly only in name with the exception of a light saltiness. The roasted and chocolate malting make this a smooth experience and one that should not be missed, however I found this beer to be lacking the wow factor I experience with their first 2 turnpike beers (exit 4 & 11)."
"A capped 750ml bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $7. Poured into my Ithaca shaker glass and allowed to warm up for about a half hour. The stout appears an opaque brown color with a good inch of fluffy dark ecru head. Nose and flavors consist of nicely roasted malt, milk and bittersweet chocolate, caramel, vanilla, a fair amount of light char/smoke, molasses, mocha. It might be subliminal because I know this is brewed with oysters, but I'm picking up a somewhat salty and sour brackish brininess here. The brine plays second fiddle to the roast, smoke and chocolate though. Great body; creamy, very dry and amply carbonated with a lingering bitter, sweet, smoky, mildly sour finish. Really nice stuff that's worth checking out."
"The taste is quite good. The beer has some drying qualities that mix quite nicely with some sweeter dark malts. There are some charring qualities, some burnt molasses qualities, some roasted English toffee, some dry Irish stout too. The creaminess, the subtlety of the beer, and its full palate and drinkability make this beer a real find. L'Chaim."
"CHEERS!!"
"Overall very solid and really quite nicely done. I have to admit name alone scared me off, but there was no reason for it. This was just a nicely done stout all the way around."
"Mmmm, you don't get many oyster stouts. In this case, the seafood character is pretty mild and just adds a pleasant, but curious, meaty character. Otherwise there's a big roasty chocolate taste with toasted bread and crust plus dry cocoa and hard candy caramel. It finishes with a dry, bitter and burnt finish. Despite the strength, this isn't a big heavy beer. It's quite drinkable if you don't feel like sharing a 750ml bottle."
"Drinkability is average-plus. Good stuff overall, but I'd like to see that oyster assert itself just a little more."
"Poured deep mahogany, near-black into an American pint glass, with a thin tan head and very little lace. The aroma was dominated not surprisingly by cocoa and bittersweet chocolate, and further revealed a feint roasted malt presence. The taste as well was dominated by chocolate, but the roasted malt was more prominent as well, and the finish was surprisingly dry, with the tiniest hint of hop bitterness. For such a chocolate-y beer, I found the body to be spritzier and thinner than expected. Maybe too much CO2 in the tapping? Anyway, the flavor profile wasn't overpowering, and this went down fairly easily. I'd love to try this on nitro."
"First I love this Jersey Turnpike Exit series concept. This beer is said to be brewed with oyster shells but I could not taste it or know what if any influance they had in this beer. Very nice dry type stout that poured black with dark tan creamy head and good lacing. Bitter hints of coffee and chocolate. Very drinkable stout."
"Drinkability: this beer is one you enjoy slowly. One bottle was sufficient in a session. This was a nice change up in flavor for a stout, and it is quite enjoyable."
"There is little trace of the titular oyster in the beer, though this isn't surprising since the briny effect tends to fade quickly. I have about half the bottle before dinner, and the second half with dinner, and with food, I found that I could detect just the faintest trace of the flat earthiness that oysters sometimes impart, but without any of the salt sting."
"Drank most of the bottle myself, so I guess that would make it quite drinkable."
"Absolutely jet black in color. Nice tight cocoa head that fades way too fast for me. Moderate roasted and cocoa aroma. Big roasted flavor without being too astringent. Deep roasted grain taste here. Dark chocolate and a slight mocha tinge. No sense of oysters or their essence though I could see the connection here. Somewhat briny, if thats not too far a reach. Great body-really a solid mouthfeel. Great drinkability-very well rounded and balanced. Could do this one all night-early and often-just like how I vote!"
"d- Good but heavy, wouldn't want to drink an entire bottle."
"Well, it was an experience. I get a bit queasy thinking about gobs of oysters going into the brew kettle, but thanks for the chance to try it!"
"First oyster stout and i'd be glad to try more. While the taste of actual 'oyster' may sound the gross the saltiness really complements the sweet coffee and oak well keeping them both grounded. A well made, interesting beer."
"Overall- Another delicious Exit series beer. The oysters leave a unique creamy flavor. If only FF would make their Exit beers year round they would become a more sought after brewery!"
"The area of South Jersey surrounding Exit 1 was once known as a haven for oysters, and that reputation has recently been revived. A truly under-appreciated style, thanks to Flying Fish for another winner. Can't wait to see what waits for us at the next Exit..."
"d-Not bad but seems kind of one dimentional. Lots of coffee and not much else."
"Drinkability: very nice and drinkable. I don't see why anyone would have a hard time drinking this. A quality stout that's super roasty and goes down easy."
"This is definitely NOT a sipping beer. This is a beer for drinking over and over during a long evening with friends. Or by yourself. It doesn't matter. Try this beer and buy a few. You won't regret it."
"Drinkability is ok. I had a tough time with this settling in the belly.The oyster dryness leaves the same feeling that was left in the mouth is in the belly. Did not sit to well with me. A good tasting beer but definetley not a session for me."
