"Tasty, but a little one-note with the charred flavor. And expensive, too, for what it is."
"I had this beer last year and absolutely adored it... this time around, I found it a bit lacking but still very, very good. I question this particular bottle's age and plan on re-reviewing the first chance I get my hands on another bottle of this one."
""
""
""
"O: Really nice stout, almost more of an oatmeal stout than an export stout. Tasty and roasty."

"Overall: Another Steel Toe brew that I tried on tap, loved, and so bought a bottle to review. Very tasty stuff, hits a nice balance between sweetness and dark chocolate bitterness along with having a nice feel to it. Good stuff."

"at republic uptown served in a pint glass with a thin finger of dark tan frothy head that leaves little lacing and breaks down rather rapidly. Brownish black in color. Aromas of rich dark chocolatey malt. Notes of rich toasted sugar as well. Flavor is rich dark toasted malt with characteristics of heavily roasted coffee. End note is a tad bitter from the dark malts. Medium bodied with a carbonation level a bit high that seems to bring out the lingering almost astringent aftertaste from the roasted malts. Overall a decent beer that could benefit from a little less in your face dark malt and better balance."

"O - This is the third beer I've had from Steel Toe behind Size 7 and Rainmaker, and I'm not quite as in love with this one compared to those two. The flavors and smell are not as potent as I'd like, and it just doesn't stand out to me. It's a solid beer but I don't know if it I'd go for it again anytime soon."
"Enjoying a fresh growler from the brewery today. Poured opaque black with a small tan head that faded quickly to a persistent skein. Smell was roasted malt, coffee and chocolates. Very nice. Taste had nice roasty elements, deeply roasted malt and French roast coffee. Sweet and semi sweet chocolate. Late on the palate is a little hint of dark fruit. Lightly hopped, with a slight hop and roasty coffee bean like bitterness that leaves the finish clean, lightly bitter, and dry. Nice medium body, creamy texture. Excellent, tasty export stout."
"Overall: A very good stout. Very forward with the chocolate and coffee flavors. Good balance between the sweetness and roasty bitterness."
"if i had regular access to this, i'd make it my go to stout, especially for the price tag. this is my 2nd beer from this brewery, and i have to say i was already sold on the first (size 7 ipa).. but this one just confirmed their consistency to pull out two completely different styles of beer so damn good."
""
"Overall, okay beer but pretty one dimensional."
"Well crafted, flavorful ale...worth seeking out."
"Overall: Nice full-bodied Stout that is not quite Imperial. Good mix of flavors, just a wee bit too sweet upfront. However, the abrupt transition from sweet to bitter is very interesting."
""

"O= This is a solid brew. The IPA from Steel Toe was awesome and this is the second brew I've had from them and I actually might like it even more. This is a stout done right. Tone the alcohol down a bit and I could see myself drinking this all day. A ton of complexity with a body that is sooo drinkable makes this one of a few stouts that I can see myself drinking over and over again. It doesn't have to be 11%+ alcohol in order to pack all sorts of flavor in and this is a great example."
""
""
"O- I like this beer a lot. Good flavor and pretty easy drinking for a 7% abv"
"O: overall, this beer is alright. I think its just a little too coffee bean tasting and it could have had some other flavors come out and compliment the coffee flavor."
""
"O: Pretty decent drinkability. Not bad at all."
""
"O - A well-crafted beer, I must say. Was surprised by this one and really enjoyed my pour. Would definitely have again, if offered. I would say this is more Export Stout then Black Ale, because of the lack of hops."
""
"Overall, nothing special, but a good beer and a solid offering from Steel Toe."
""
"D - As a ""Black Ale"" I like it a tad better than the Summit, but I suspect that's mostly because this is far more Stout than Black Ale. Definitely a 'tweener, so I'm going to have to evaluate from other perspectives and split the difference."
""

"I think this is miscast on this sight as a Foreign Export Stout, whereas the brewery calls it a Dark Ale. I think it is a well done Dark Ale, but it would certainly be lacking some girth and robustness as a Foreign Export Stout. Despite being a well made and easy drinking ""Dark Ale", the flavor is not that complex or bold, the feel is kinda thin, and the nose faint and hard to find."
"O - A decent brew from a relativley new brewery. Of their four flagship beers, I'd rate this one a distant second (possibly third behind Rainmaker) to the extremely good Size 7 IPA. Not a bad beer and a nice addition to the local beer scene - just not something I was wowed by (as I was by the Size 7). I really like what this brewery is doing and I'm eager to see what else they produce in the future."
""
"O: I think this beer is just alright. The smell is amazing, but the taste falls a bit short. I know this isn't an American Double/Imperial Stout, or a Russian Imperial Stout, but I really wanted more of the chocolate notes to shine through in the taste. After sampling their other beers, I'm a bit disappointed by this one. But it's still pretty good."
""
"Had this at the brewery this evening ontap. Very dark and good lacing in the pour. Smells ofnchocolat and lactose with a nice caramel inviting nose. Taste is balanced and a good export stout style. Very happy with this one compared to the Other export stouts available. Steel toe is a welcome addition to the area craft scene."
""
"Cracked open a bottle for dessert. Poured pitch black with a short tan head from my bomber. Mmm, nice chocolate aroma with a fresh coffee background. The flavor has a tasty, clean dry cocoa roast with a bready malt undertone. Hops come in for a big dry bitter finish that's a little more American stout/double stout. This is an awesome stout, just don't expect something on the sweet side like Lion or Dragon stouts."
"Good, solid brew. Colored just a bit outside the lines, this would be my second brew of choice for Steel Toe after Size 7. For now. I likes."

"It's a fine beer, but beyond the clearly stoutesque pour, this is a beer stuck in purgatory between ale and stout, and doesn't seem clear what it wants to be. I'm not concerned, but it led to a confusing experience. I would buy it again but at this point would not take heroic measures to do so. I think it really needs to be tried on its own and then revisited"
"D- Overall drinkable but I find myself fighting over ""is this a dark ale or a stout of some sort?"" The overall taste profile seems to be very quick on the palette. Drinking as a dark ale as the brewery labels it, it's not bad. I won't have this often, however."

"I think this is a very solid representation of the style. A very drinkable stout also. Steel Toe really has a solid portfolio of beers, this one included."
"Draft. Pours a dark black/black color with a slight tan head. Light roasty aroma in the nose, molasses, and a touch of leather. Slight hops. Medium mouthfeel. Starts with a slight bitter roast flavor and a little sweet dark fruit and then moves to a medium hoppy floral bitterness. Pretty easy drinking. Slight lace. No notes of alcohol. Not sure I would classify this as a stout."
"Really impressed with this stout. Still hate the bomber format, but I will not stop drinking this beer because of the bottle/price."
"Slightly over medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, and smooth and easy to drink. A very nice Foreign Stout from Steel Toe. I can't wait to see what else they will have to offer."
"Very nice, bitter export stout from Minnesota's newest craft brewery. Black as tar with a chocolate mocha head with good lacing. Smell is good, fruity and roasty. Mouth feel is decent. Taste is roasty and rich with hop bitterness. Overall, a very good beer."
"This beer pours a pitch black color. The head is a half inch of tan foam that recedes slowly into nice lacing that lingers. The aroma is of roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, and more roasted malt. This is a really interesting aroma. The taste is just as roasty as the aroma with a nice lingering maltiness. Along with the roasted malt there is also some nice dark chocolate and coffee notes in the background. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate-low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good beer that I can see myself drinking a lot of. I just wish it were available in six pack form."
