Rich malty taste, chocolate, coffee, but smooth and creamy. Slight hop kicks in late but builds. Kind of a candy chocolate overall flavor.","KTCamm","Jul 27, 2014"

3.38,-10.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a pretty nice beer, especially coming from the Caribbean where so many beers are wimpy and substandard. This one is a real stout, with some characteristics of a porter. The color is very black, with a modest head of tan. Slight nose of dark malts and hops. Moderately heavy in the mouth, but not as creamy as some stouts, though this would improve if poured from a nitro tap. Nice full malt on the palate, with a very subtle but lingering bitterness in the finish from a well-balanced hop infusion. I did enjoy this, and consider it perhaps the best brew from the Bahamas.","jushoppy2beer","Jan 01, 2012"

4.4,17,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Got this in a bottle while on vacation in Eleuthera. Fresh, sweet, malty. I think of stouts as a good cold-weather beer, but this is a stout for a warm climate. It is tasty, but not thick, which makes it a refreshing choice where one might look for a lager.","SteveStein","Dec 10, 2010"
3.88,3.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Went to the Freeport and tried Kalik, sands and this. Kalik was skunky and looked like piss in a bottle.Tastes much lighter than the 7 % though. Sands was light and reminded me of the many American offerings available by big beer. This beer on the other hand was dark, chocolate with a good solid mouth feel. Not a Guinness fan as the back end isn't great to me, but I think this stout tastes much smoother and has the ram's kick in abv to boot, as shown on the label. Win win situation. One of the smoother stouts I've encountered. Not too complex of a taste but substantial and buzzy with a nice creamy head of 2 or 3 fingers with pretty good lacing. It's all in the pour. Not overly sweet, either. In my opinion, this is your best bet in the Bahamas for a quality beer. Could be a devastating session beer if you're inclined to test your resistance, as most beer on the islands costs the same. I would definately pick this up stateside and add to my arsenal if available. Somewhat similar to a good dark bock in smoothness with a nice subtle stout flavor with nice chocolate and roasted malt undertones. Brought a case back to share with the homies since I was so impressed on what I stumbled on. Like me, they seek beer beyond the average redneck palate. I received all positive feedback from some very opinionated friends. Try it if you can. Cheers!","Dojima","Aug 23, 2010"

3.58,-4.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"While honeymooning on Harbour Island I didn't expect to have a great beer selection since the island is about 3 miles long. The small liquor store with very particular hours only carried a slew of simple lagers and this local stout. It was a tasty variant. When I popped it open, the scent was a thick malty, chocolate aroma. The color was a rich, dark tone with little carbonation - it could've used a little more oomph in that dept, as it was inching towards flat. The taste was gratifying with a good range of flavors from the malty chocolate to a slight spice/barley flavor. Bonus points for a cool bottlecap displaying the iconic ram!","smurder187","Mar 25, 2010"
3.97,5.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Served to me in a plastic mug. Not ideal, but after drinking cans of Sands for a few days, I won't complain. Deep black with a thin head. Smells of rosted chocolate mix with a faint boozy aroma. Tastes heavy on the roasted malts while the warmth of the alcohol coats the mouth. Mild hops balance out the brew nicely. Feels pretty dense and heavy on the tongue. Very drinkable for the ABV. Good brew that's worth a try if your in the islands.","JunkYardJake","Beers"
