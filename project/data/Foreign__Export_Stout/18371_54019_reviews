"After popping the cap, I gave everyone a generous pour. This created a finger of dense, deep-tan/light-brown head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose was really rich - molasses, anise, light charcoal, vanilla. Mouthfeel was surprisingly only medium. The taste was semi-sweet with flavors including dried dark fruits, dark chocolate and a little bit of smokiness. The finish was dry and smoky and we decided to go in a different direction for our next beer."

"This is a dark, dark brown beer with a short white head. The nose is not as roasty or smokey as I would have thought it would but I liked it quite a bit. Some molasses, some smoke and a little licorice come through. The taste was similar with what started as a slight metallic aftertaste that faded as it warmed and gave some hints of anise, sage and rosemary at the back of the tongue. The chocolate smokiness and molasses also grew as it warmed. I enjoyed it more and more as it warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth, medium bodied. I always like a stout with a little more body than this one but it worked well. All in all, I really enjoyed this and would encourage anyone drinking it on tap to give it sometime."

"O- It must be the combination of 7.0 abv and 48 ibus that makes this a hit for me. Bold, not boozy. Balanced, not sugary or bitter. And, the aroma; mmm"

"O: I've been sitting on this one for longer than I should have. Great balance of flavors. A very nice stout that I was expecting."

"Nicely done."

"O: A nice mid-Fall FES with a good mix of maltiness and yeast character. Easy to drink and can be found at a nice price. Kinda reminds me of Allagash Black. Seek some out"

"O: Nice FES. Not a ton of roasted malt character outside of the chocolate. Lots of sweet grains balances out the bitter smoke and roasted malt. Flavors are pretty well integrated and smooth, probably attributable to the age. This one has held up great. Tasty and unique FES."
""
""
""
"Overall: Export-style, drier and stronger than many stouts. Outstanding. A world-class stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: Interesting to note I left the bottle out for about 15 minutes while I drank first glass and upon pouring the second glass the head was a huge at least 3 fingers worth and lacing became an obvious addition."
""
""
""
"O: pretty good, not a lit going on but what it does it does very well. flavors are good and it is very to style. Pretty Things makes good beer and this is no exception."

"O: Overall, quite tasty, the higher alcohol content is well hidden. This is not as chocolate-y as other foreign export stouts but still quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A good beer that I would like more if they did remove that smoked malt from the grain bill! Other than the smokiness and the weak apperance the beer is quite enjoyable!"
""
""
"O - It delivers like a stout should. I'm sure it's top of its own class."
""
""
"The beer pours a proper stout black with a medium sized roasted tan head on top that quickly fizzles into a tight scrim that causes very thin droopy lacing. The body is impenetrable to the eye, sitting entirely opaque in the glass, but seems clear of sediment and haze. On the nose, the beer smells terrifically bizarre for the style. The slight roasted coffee and dark chocolate are there, but they play second fiddle to the beer’s dark fruit, quad-like smells of plums and raisin, and even a slight kiss of spicy alcohol. The beer tastes just as terrific, with light dark fruit notes on the beginning and aftertaste, but a strong roasted coffee stout flavor coming through in the middle. The beer begins with slight sour plum and raisin before opening into creamy roasted coffee and light dark chocolate notes, while sweet raisin and slight alcohol linger behind the roast and again show themselves strongly in the lingering aftertaste alongside the roasted coffee. The beer feels medium to medium heavy on the mouth, with a drying feeling in the face and sticky dry crackling on the tongue. Overall this is a terrific export stout with a Belgian yeast flair. I love the quad-like characters in the beer as they add a nice unique twist. This beer is a must try for stout fans, and another success from Pretty Things, as well as a go-to stout for me."

"Of course there's the perfumy lavender notes that distinguish this ""winter warmer"" from an export stout that could come around any time of the year. But the spice aids in aroma but distracts in taste and texture. Added fruit esters and better supporting malt sweetness could have garnered better accolades. Keep in mind, this will be a fan favorite for those that prefer extreme roastiness in their stouts."

"decent, interesting to say the least."
"O: A pretty good but not great stout with a light smoky quality."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice stout, and again one of the more novice-friendly ones on the market (as opposed to, say, an ash bomb), but suffers from a lack of pizzazz. The flavors here are nice, but light, and the watery mouthfeel doesn’t help. The fact that the beer’s latter notes are almost exclusively ash seems to point to a general dearth of sugars (thus the low ABV), and so while the initial flavors are good, they lack staying power."
""
""
""
"Overall - A great stout, there's not much more to say. It's probably a better cold weather beer. No, it's definitely better in cold weather."
"o - overall, spot on export stout. really nice irish flavorings and good amount of char. easy drinker and definitely one of the winners in the pretty things lineup."
""
""

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry roasted malt with light residual sugar notes (maybe some lactose) and light smoked notes. Taste is a complex mix between some dry roasted malt with some light smoke notes and some light spicy malt notes. Body is quite full with light creamy texture and good carbonation. Well brewed with good level of complexity while retaining a good drinkability level."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing short of trendsetting! A stout with both Belgian and British influences: who would have guessed that it would have worked? It just goes to show what a great brewer can do with the right ingredients. I’m not sure what I paid for this, but I’ll take another bottle, please."
""
""
"Bottled 11/2009 and somehow got lost until tonight. Pours a solid dark brown with faint garnet highlights when held to light and a fluffy tan meringue head that sticks lots of lace on the way down. Smells of roast and lots of caramel dark sugars and dark fruits. Spicy earthy aromas remind me of wood and ginger. The flavor is kind of a cross between a stout and a Belgian strong dark ale. The roasty caramel and chocolate flavors meet some spicy and earthy flavor reminiscent of some dark Belgians. Nice sugary fruity flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. This probably wasn't the best candidate for aging, but it worked just the same, its a very nice beer"
""
""
"O: This was a very interesting and fulfilling stout from the gypsy brewers at Pretty Things. The 7% ABV and variety of malts kept this stout drinking sturdy and the traditional hop additions kept it distinctly American. However, the British and Belgian yeast strains really made for some interesting, fruity, tart and spicy flavors that might have gone unnoticed with a house yeast. I'd certainly grab it again."
"O: Points for flair, but even though it's fascinating, it always seems like it doesn't quite make it. So close to the mark, but it never quite finds its way there. Still worth trying and perhaps better fresh."
""

"D - Very drinkable. Really nice Stout. The balance is spot on here with a great mix of chocolate, coffee, and a touch of dark fruit sweetness."

"22 ounce bottle, bottled October 2011. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. The aroma is nice, it smells like chocolate, roasted malt, smoke, and some dark fruit and coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, molasses, smoke, wood, and a bit of licorice. Nice mix between the sweet and bitter flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and very smooth with moderate carbonation. I like this brew, too bad I can't get it here in Ohio. I'll probably buy this again the next time I come across it. $7.99 a bomber."
""
"Kind of surprised to see new stuff from Pretty Things all the way out on the west coast. A nice, pleasant, hearty and rustic stout. Mildly smoky and seems a touch of spicy on there as well. It's a good winter stout. Even though there are parts of it that stand out in their own ways, it strikes me as well balanced."
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black. Nice fine brown head with decent retention and good lacing. Mild aroma of toasted and dark malt with an interesting faint estery fruit component. Unusual flavor dominated by dark malt, but complex, earthy with unidentifiable fruit flavors. Finish is a touch sour, reminiscent of rye (which is listed as an ingredient) mixed with spicy toasted malt and coffee. Unusual combination of flavors, but this one works for me. Medium bodied with a touch of creaminess. These guys push the envelope but seem to pull it off. I would get this again if it was available in my state."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a very nice stout. I definitely get the ""woodland"" feel while drinking it. Wish Pretty Things made six packs, I'd buy this year round. Kudos to you Pretty Things!"
""
"Overall I'm surprised more people don't love this stout. It's unique with great layers of flavor that range from woods, herbs, and fruit with an underlining roastiness that runs across everything."
""
"O- Weird beer. Like it, don't love it."
""
"Overall this is a good beer and there are some interesting tastes in this brew but it is lacking some things that would make it world class. Recommended to stout lovers to try."
"Taste is very earthy with almost a burnt taste. Loads of hops and roasted malt. It comes off as being a little on the chemical side. Not a bad beer though. Carbonation is adequate and this beer is drinkable."
""
""
"O: gotta say it was just a decent stout and was probably at the bottom of my list from the beers tasted today from pretty things."
"Enjoyed the previous Pretty Things beers I’ve tried, but this was a slight disappointment. Unique like the others, but was a bit harsh and not all that cohesive."
""
"Overall: Very interesting beer. The first sip is a little overwhleming but after a few sips this mellows out into a nice complex stout. Has some strong Rauchbier characteristics."
"D - The various components imply that this might be an over the top type of stout, but it is actually fairly drinkable and the more unusual flavoring aspects such as the smoke are well integrated. In fact, it almost goes too far into being a smooth, well balanced beer to the point that it comes across as kind of bland in the finish with an excessive level of sweetness that lingers on the palate and hurts the drinkability towards the end of the glass."
"D- 100% drinkability."
""
""
"A pretty damn good stout. A little pricey, at least in my area, for a non BA stout, but this will not disappoint. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
"D - I like PT. This one is not my favorite, however."
""
"bottle from bierkraft, bottled in October 2011. A very pleasant drinking smouth. Silky mouthfeel, not thick like an IS. Black with enormous retained white bubbly head. Mild roast and anise on the nose. Great stout, with a bit of smoky head in the finish. Great drinkability."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a smooth and medium bodied dark chocolate brown in color with a one finger creamy khaki head. It poured exceptionally smooth. The aromas are interesting. It's a little earthy. It has a certain sweet spice to it and smells like it may even use some oat. The flavors feature slight soft chocolate, some sweet spice, light earth, with a touch of toffee. Nice and mellow flavor. It drinks on the lighter end of medium bodied but it very smooth, increasing drinkability. Overall this is a nice stout. It had a certain earthiness to it that makes it a little different than most. It's an easy drinker and for $8.99, pretty cost effective."
"22 oz bottle from Beer Revolution in Oakland. Quite sippable, but be prepared for a different kind of smoke."
"If you like riddles - or just the idea of drinking shrubs - then this is a beer for you because Babayaga is not only a fantastic autumn seasonal, but an especially peculiar and curious beer. It is, almost as literally as figuratively, a piece of abstract modernist art. Rosemary is obvious, and juniper and spruce are highly suspected, but the real mystery is not what ingredients were put in it, but rather what exactly makes it so damn drinkable!"
""
"O- Overall a good stout. Not my favorite, but I love stouts, so being my favorite is not easy. There are some interesting notes to it. I would certainly have it again."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with a tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, dark fruits, and some slight cocoa and coffee aromas. Taste is pretty much the same. There is a medium roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good roasty stout with some nice smells and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Yet another solid beer from Pretty Things."
"Dr: Quite drinkable, but also boring and unremarkable."
""
""
"Overall- Overall I think it's great. Nothing new, no specific strong point but its not boring by any means. A good stout done right."
"All the parts are blended wonderfully and I am not aware of whether this is a beer skillfully crafted from only the traditional ingredients or a masterful mixing of herbs, etc. too. This one was worth waiting for, now where can I get another?"
""
"O: Unique stout from a consistently solid brewery."
""
""
"Pours a dark black color with a medium, tan head that disappears quickly. Scent bring a bit of charcoal to the nose, immediately followed by sweet chocolate. A little bit of oak and citrus as well. Slight bit of anise and a ton of dark malt. Taste is initially citrus hop flavors, immediately followed by some dark fruit and chocolate. Some wooden oak flavors along with a hint of smoke. Finishes with a dash of clove and more bitter chocolate...maybe some espresso. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, rich, and smooth. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this is a very tasty stout. It lingers nicely between stout and imperial stout with some complex flavors to it."
"O: I was expecting an Imperial Stout for some reason and instead got an ""American Stout"" that tastes more like a Black IPA. Highly bitter with a good amount of charred roasty malts. Fruity notes are apparent along with some subtle spicing."
""
""
"O - Overall this is a solid offering from Pretty Things. While its not the best stout on the market, it is one that is readily available in my end."
""
"O: A really tasty winter stout. I love the idea, and it's pulled off effectively. The price is tough at $10 a bomber, but it's worth a try at least once."
""
""
""
""
"D - A solid beer. Not that big of fan of the smoke in it."
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, slightly filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
""

"An enjoyable stout overall, but nothing to really seperate it from the pack. Pretty dry for a stout. Would like to try fresh."

"One of the finer beers I've had from this brewer. Nice local artisanal product."
"On tap tonight at Porter Cafe in West Roxbury. Served in a Pretty Things wide-mouthed wine glass. Extremely dark brown body, with a tremendous looking tan head. This glass really accentuates the look of the beer. Smell was subtly earthy. Taste is right on the money. It's rich with flavors of chocolate and milky coffee, with just enough of a hint of smoke to enjoy. There is a slight mineral quality in the finish. Mouthfeel was right in the middle - not too thick and not too thin. This is a very enjoyable stout, and I am upset with myself that it took me this long to finally try it."

"O - Officially the first beer with a smoked component that I have enjoyed. Chocolate malt abounds, so if you're into that, this one is a sure winner. One I would revisit."
"Overall I think this is my favorite from Pretty Things, easy to drink, great smell and taste."
""
""
"The taste is an American stout. The beer is very creamy at first with a smooth mouth. A slight bit of carbonation hits the top of the mouth. A roasted and creaminess linger and hints of roasted malts.... ehh at first the mouth feel was good enough to shadow the taste. nothing special about the favor average craft stout."
"Overall: a funky stout with a bunch of flavor, and the rosemary spice really come through here. Very enjoyable and easy to drink beer."
"Very enjoyable. I would definitely buy it again."
"OK stout, but I probably wouldnt buy again. Glad I had in taster not a full pint."
"I'd didn't really pick up any rosemary or other stuff in the beer. There was an off taste like metallic maybe that's it either way it was off putting to me."
"Overall, a pleasant and one of a kind stout. Really well done with nice balance throughout. I would get this again."
"O/D-Not what I was expecting, but I really enjoyed how strange this beer is. Very, very complex and hard to accurately describe. Simply put, I really like it. Pretty Things is a blessing."
"A real flavorful export stout with a good balance in both flavor and body. A pleasant choice from Pretty Things and one of my favorite offerings of theirs to date."
"I really hope Pretty Things continues brewing stouts, as this one is very good. Restrained and balanced rather than brash and overpowering, this is a really nice seasonal offering."
"I had this beer on-tap this past summer. The beer poured to be a very dark brown, close to black in color. You could smell a strong aroma of roasted coffee, malts, and caramel. Upon tasting this beer, there was a bit of a spice to it-hard to decipher where the spiciness comes from. This beer was full-bodied, sweet but not overpoweringly sweet. This beer was very enjoyable. Cheers!"
"Very full bodied, but goes down quite easy. I'll be having a few more of these mythical brews this season. Pretty Things never fails me."
"tan head rises up above an entirely black body. Wonderful retention leaves it several inches high and deposits tons of side glass web like lace. The smooth vanilla and cocoa aroma melds wonderfully with hints of coffee and a touch of molasses. Very complex here. As i take a sip the huge full bodied feel comes in waves over the tongue and settles down with a wonderful coating feeling of sweet chocolate and vanilla. As this fades though a very nice bite of hops comes in and seals the deal, body is a touch thin and there is some off notes going on in the finish, but overall i think it really worked quite nicely."
"This should be classified as an export stout. Beer is sweet on the front, thinner in body than expected, strong, heavy with alcohol. The midpalate is fruity, estery, filled with a floral sort of yeast, the finish is relatively dry but not overly so. It is odd that the roast bitterness comes up almost as an aftertaste. Interesting beer overall. Quite good."
"O - A decent stout, very middle of the road. I thought it was good and I'd have it again, just wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"The CPJ"
"O: Its not bad, but there was nothing that stood out in this beer. Have had a bunch of other beers from Pretty Things, and this is the only one thusfar that is a disappointment."
"O: A little much with the bitter chocolate finish."
"Not quite what I was expecting from a stout (though I shouldn't be surprised coming from Pretty Things). Another interesting brew from this ""Project"" and worth a try."
"Overall a pretty ok american stout. It has its flaws but I like the smoked malt component. I would probably have it again if someone gave it to me but I don't think I would buy it again."
"I highly recommend everything I've had from pretty things. They spend a lot of time perfecting their flavors."
"Pretty drinkable beer. Surprisingly big for a stout of it's size. Definitely a one and done buy very pleasant and enjoyable."
"D- Good beer. Not great, but good. It has some characteristics that can be improved. It could use with some balancing flavors in addition to what it has, but I like it. Really wish I shared this with some other BAs."
"Roasty, very earthy middle, manure, tobacco, unripe black fruits, some sour cherry and prune. A bit of bitter cocoa and just kind of a weird tinny quality on the back end. Some type of unmalted barley flavor that is kind of offputting."
"D: Again, not bad. A tad bit too much smokiness and char for my stout-loving preferences, but given the ingredient mix, the brewer was obviously going for something different - and succeeded in that regard."
"Finally tried this, as I am getting more into dark beers and stouts and I LOVE Pretty Things. The beer is a dark black with a nice tan head that drops slowly. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit I assocaite with Belgiam yeast. The taste is similar, but with surprising bitterness. A GREAT freakin' brew! Thanks, Dan!"
"However, this also makes it a bit hard to grade. If grading to the style, it certainly falls short of what 'traditional' stouts are, but as a beer itself, it's interesting and I really enjoyed it. Overall a great first impression for this brewery, and I have another bottle from this BIF that I am looking forward to, and from there I'll hopefully expand further!"
"D: The stout is quite easy to drink because it isn't very filling."
"D - a low enough ABV to enjoy a couple of these! Unfortunately, they aren't sold here and this is my only bottle :("
"I've got an '09 bottle I'll be sampling soon to compare - am wondering if the bitter will fade ?"
"Reviewed on 1/10/2010. Bottle. Pours black with a thick chocolate colored head. Aroma of roasted malt, a slight smoke presence. Flavor of smoke, earthy hops, roasted malt, bitter chocolate. An interesting stout with a distinct woodsy/oaky/earthy presence and of course, nice smokey notes. Very tasty and super drinkable."
"Pours with dark, rich color and creamy consistency. It's subtle yet appealing aroma are matched only by it's smooth flavor and mouth feel. Babayaga has a medium yet thick head. My only criticism is that Babayaga's hut moves around on three hen's legs, not four but this is a beer, not a fairy tale, although after finishing this fine stout you'll feel as if you've been transported in time!"
"Babayaga pours black, no hint of light even when directly backlit, yet it doesn't feel as dark as many larger stouts would pour. What was admittedly an overly harsh pour yields a mountain of rocky caramel colored foam, easily more than four fingers worth. The nose is fairly muted, but I can discern some chocolate and a little bit of rosemary. The flavor is much better, with a big blast of milk chocolate followed by a brief flourish of coffee kicking things off. The back end is an excellent blend of rosemary and a bit of smokiness. This is the first beer that I can really say just tastes like winter. The carbonation is pitch perfect, on the low end of the spectrum but still very lively. The beer's a little dry though for my taste, and I wish there was just a bit more heft behind it. This beer is another great offering from Pretty Things, one of my all time favorite winter brews. I only wish I had a fireplace, because I can't imagine a much better way to spend a frigid night like this than sitting in front of a roaring fire and sipping on some Babayaga"
"D - Drinkable for sure but I just don't care for what belgian yeast does to stouts. Not up my alley but not an offensive beer. Worth trying for sure but I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"D- This isn't a super huge beer but its no slouch. I'm thinking some big porter or a medium sized stout. But I like it"
"Interesting beer as usual from Pretty things. Fairly solid stout, got better as it warmed. Didn't detect all the components claimed on the bottle, but those that i did were subtle as they should be."
"It's not a style-bender like Jack D'Or was -- and certainly not as mind-blowing -- but if it's true that every great brewer has to produce a great export stout, then I suppose the Paquettes can be officially anointed as such. (As if there was any doubt.)"
"Babayaga is a great drink and it is not your run of the mill stout. Would definitely recommend this beer to friends."
"Split this bottle and almost wish I didn't. Good balance, good complexity, and alcohol is well hidden. Very good."
"I really like the idea of malt smoked over Rosemary, but it's just not coming through here. The base beer is pretty tasty though."
"D- A really unique and tasty spin on a stout."
"Great drinkability on this one and a relatively light body. Yum."
"Thanks Andy for the bottle! Poured into a tulip. The beer appears very dark brown with just a thin layer of mocha head that fizzes away quickly. The aroma is mostly big dark malts for me with a bit of smoke and bits of dark chocolate and earthy aromas. The flavor mirrors the aroma pretty nicely, lots of barley and malt flavors with kind of a dirty finish. The best adjective I can think of for this one is rustic. The mouthfeel is rather silky with decent carbonation and a relatively light body. Good drinkablity and certainly unique to me."
"Judging by the reviews from last year, batch 1 used to have more roast flavors. I'd like them back."
"Their Saisons - Jack D'or and Fieldmouse's Farewell are delicious"
"Babayaga, right now, is yet another almost-there beer from Pretty Things. It's quite interesting, but I feel like with a few tweaks and smoothing out this could be much better. I love this brewery because everything they make is off-kilter and a delight to drink, but much like some young forest-dwelling critter, it'll take a few years for this Pretty Things to grow to the fullness of its being. Keep your eyes on this little brewery."
"I like this beer, I like it alot, I like that it's not 10 percent and it's not overly heavy. I drank it with ease. I am steadily impressed with Pretty Things beers, a good company."
"Drinkability: Not too shabby - I enjoy the smells and flavors, but I do wish it was thicker in the body; the ABV isn't awfully high, but it could easily sneak up on anyone."
"D- interesting and tasty stuff another brew from pretty things that I've enjoyed very much. This was a november 09 bottle so I wonder what it was like fresh."
"One of the better Pretty Things beers I've had. Pretty solid for a stout."
"Notes: A SUPER dry-style stout. Was not expecting that at all. Toasty and bitter, but I prefer a little more sweetness. Just personal preference. Really well done if you like dry stouts."
"d - A decent stout. Some nice roasted elements to the smell and taste. Would give another shot but probably not seek out."
"This beer should be skipped, no need to pursue. I don't have the best palate but Hans the Närke owner-brewer agreed with me and we moved on, so I'm comfortable in my score."
"D: Meh."
"I though that this was a very good stout, though perhaps slightly on the sweet side."
"Carbonation is nice, and at 7% ABV, not too bad as a dessert beer. Not entirely sure what ""Woodland stout"" or ""Sylvan stout"" on the label mean."
"D: I wouldn't revisit this, but it was interesting to try."
"D- This is yet another Pretty Things beer that knocks itself out of the ballpark. This brewery has yet to do anything wrong in my book. Looking forward to getting more Pretty Things!"
"D: Good beer but it was a little too hot to have when we did. I did not want to hold onto it over the summer. This one was bottles in November 0f 09 and just never got around to it till now. Still great. Would be great around a fire."
"Drinkability: Love the creativity and love the flavor - kudos"
"D: Too much for his 85 degree day. I wish it was cold again."
"Alot of licorice flavors here with a healthy dose of yeasty esters. Medium fruits like strawberries and cantaloupe make their way to the parade in the middle and is followed up by a decent amount of roast and hop bitterness. Not a very sweet beer, especially for a stout. Mouthfeel could use a tad more heft and creaminess. Alcohol is plenty noticeable and I would not mind some more chocolate and a little sweetness. Not bad, but I dont like it as much as I wanted to."
"D- meh. my overall impression is that this was just ok. there are several locally available options that i would go for before this. however, i will continue to seek out beers from this brewery."
"The beer is well carbonated, more than most stouts but it makes it interesting. The flavors are well balanced and the beer has a nice dry finish. The alcohol is well incorporated into the flavor, this is a good beer that I will certainly revisit."
"This one really impressed me as I love the use of smoked malts to add to the complexity without turning it into a full-on smoked beer. Great beer."
"Very, very, very burnt taste. Taste like wood cinders...in a good way. Thick, kind of alcoholly. Has a cherry taste. Dry aftertaste. Quite strong."
"A decent beer, but one I wouldn't seek out."
"Pours black with a smallish tan head. Aroma is malty, roasty, phenolic. Tastes of roasted malts, awkwardly tart, peppery with a sort of Belgian phenolic character and dry finish. Body feels properly full though carbonation is a bit overdone. I'm not a fan of this one much."
"Deep chestnut brown color with a light fluffy tan head. Fades to a thick ring of bubbles with a few streaks of lacing. Aroma is slightly astringent and bittersweet. Charred roast malt, chocolate and slightly nutty. Overall very rich and varied aroma. Flavor and body sort of reminds me of an oatmeal stout, but flavors are richer and, I don't know, the word rustic is coming to mind, but I just might have the artwork stuck in my head. There is a strong charred, roasted malt body supporting a blend of earthy, dark chocolate, toasted malt, dark fruits, and smokiness. Body is medium full but seems over carbonated and overly fluffy on the palate. The finish is astringent and slightly off, with a potent charred, earthy medicinal flavor. Very robust and rich throughout, with a surprising amount of alcohol warming and burn for such a low ABV. Lots of interesting flavors, but overall I don't really enjoy the combination or the way they complement (or dont) each other. Regardless, a very unique stout worth seeking out for at least once."
"Fourth PT beer for me, first one I have really loved. This stout hits me in all the right places."
"The beer pours an inky black color with a light brown head. The aroma is fruity with some light smoke. The flavor is sweet fruit, sometimes dark fruit and sometimes other fruit such as cherries. The smoke is of medium strength. Medium-high carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"It's cool how such small brewera from across the US find their way to BC. This is a stout that seems to be hard to pigeonhole as it is somewhere between an Imperial and an Oatmeal in flavour profile. The Belgian yeast shows up too to add to the mix. I had to let the beer warm up and assert itself to really appreciate this beer. The chocolate notes were there in force but I also tasted smoky flavours and coffee . Complex beer that is quite different than most stouts"
"D: This is a unique stout, flavors play nicely off one another. Goes down easily and is worthy of sitting with for a few pints."
"the drinkability is good, it packs substantial roasted punch that sometimes cuts down drinkability, but here it reaches the upper limit of balance, but doesn't cross my line. a very unique and very good stout. i hope this remains a seasonal, i could see this being one of the beers i look forward to every year."
"Comments- I would guess some of the reviews citing an off flavor are likely not taking the Belgian character of this stout into account. Not your typical American stout-which is a very good thing. The last thing I want is another ""me too"" stout. Bravo Pretty Things."
"As with all the other beer I've had from PT, this one contains many good components but everything fails to come together as a whole. If they cut out some of the alcohol and backed off the chocolate taste, this could be a good bottle of stout. As it is now, it gave me a headache."
"D: This wasn't a particularly good beer, and another let down from Pretty Things."
"The body is appropriate for the style, north of medium but not overly so. Again, a straightforward take on a straightforward style."
"A 22oz bottle, bottled Nov2009. In a tulip glass the beer was a black color with a thick tan head that diminished fairly quickly. Mostly aa sweet chocolate aroma, but also a little bit of coffee. Chocolate dominated the taste, still that little bit of coffee. There was also a hint of licorice. A nice dry, smooth beer."
"Very dark with a dark brown cap, lots of thick lacing, good head retention. Aroma was a bit roasty, some chocolate, with sort of a funky, fruity undertone - quite mild overall. Same with the flavour, it's nice but also on the mild side. Dry malt flavour with a bit of bitterness, sweet cocoa and a bit of roast. Medium bodied with fine carbonation, smooth texture. Quite enjoyable."
"Yeah, this has very nice drinkability. The ABV is moderate and it's easy drinking. This is not terribly complicated but has no major defects."
"All negatives aside, this is a very interesting and unique beer. Paired with the lack of an alcoholic bite and the ease with which this beer goes down, this is a very drinkable beer."
"22oz bomber purchased at The Liquor Shoppe in Tygsborro, Mass. Pours an opaque pitch black body with about an inch tan head that clings to the side of the glass as it dissipates. Coffee, dark chocolate, nut, and wood comprise the aroma. Coffee, toast, and dark chocolate hit at first, becoming much fuller and richer as the sip settles in. Wood and nut are present in the background, but only as an accent and balance. Full-bodied with ample carbonation to aid drinkability. The profoundness of the coffee and chocolate in the flavor makes this not only super-delicious, but one of the best for the style I've had. More, please!"
"M&D - thinner than i expected, but not offensively so, a nice flavor combination, layered nicely, light on the palate and easy to drink, Pretty Things continues to make a name for themself"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation levels. Overall this beer was passable, but not something I would go back to. Without the metallic notes it would have been pleasing but still simple."
"4.5/3.5/4/4.5/3.5"
"This a good brew that is different in a way I can't quite put my finger on. I could enjoy a couple more glasses of this."
"It reminds me of a thin Abyss, with the sulfur and smoke. I like this. I could drink a lot of this, probably too much."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Dark chocolate to black in color with brown-white head which leaves a thin residual layer. Smell is peppery, smoky, beefy, bacon, backyard BBQ. Taste is very very good, as predicted by the smell -- smoky, tobacco, black licorice. On some sips, there is a slight medicinal aftertaste which is the only down side of this beer. Feel is creamy, smooth. Easily drinkable especially for a 7% stout. Great beer from an up and coming local brewery."
"As always Dann's beer are fabulous. This beer is a great simple, 7%abv, stout. I'd almost call this a session stout. I wish I could describe this beer better, but it's just so... not simple, but perfect. It's a perfect stout."
"While not amazing this is a nice well balanced calm stout. Alcohol isn't detectable. Feel is smooth but thinner than desired. Very drinkable."
"This is not an imperial stout yet it has lots of flavor, and probably resides somewhere between a 'regular' stout and an 'imperial' one. It occupies a nice spot on that scale, because there is a ton of flavor without being too heavy and alcoholic. Very drinkable, and another mighty fine brew from Pretty Things."
"D--tasty beer, enjoyable, worth trying. Seems like a pretty good brewery that is up and coming to be sure. Good stuff!!!"
"be sure to try this"
"Poured into a chalice a very nice dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, very nice thick two-finger thick/creamy tan head, with some very nice thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, nice chocolate/toffee notes. The taste is big on malts, slightly sweet, slight bitterness, nice chocolate/toffee notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, another very nice brew from PT."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head falls ever-so slowly, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is lightly of chocolate. Taste also finds the chocolate sweetness, which gives way to light spiciness, and a slightly earthy close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good. Was looking for a bit more, but still a good stout."
"D- This is a very good beer, not something I make a night out of but will definitely have again."
"Pours a deep brown color almost black in appearance with a small brown head that dissipates quickly leaving small patches of foam. Some light coffee, vanilla bean, a mild chocolate note and a rich plum fruitiness. Round and firm in the mouth, well carbonated and highly drinkable. A unique stout from a brewery that hasnt disappointed me yet."
"Ultra-solid example of a style that should be very drinkable. I'd be happy to get my hands on another bottle."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slowly fading rich creamy head.Aroma is chocolate cherry cordial.Taste is cocoa,cherry,sweet cream and some smoked malts.Overall a pretty good beer that goes down pretty smoothly.I would recommend and would purchase again."
"22oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Bottled November 2009 indicated on a swatch of paper covering the cap. Poured the color of cola with a frothy and sizzling 2.5 inch khaki-colored cap - head exhibited excellent retention with thick swaths of lacing exposed during the tasting. Mild nose - some chocolate malt, maybe some lactose and CO2, as well as a hint of dark fruit. Taste follows nose, with a slightly metallic quality and a roasted character. Mouthfeel is light-medium, but a little on the gassy side - finishes fairly dry. Lots of potential with this one; however, the metallic flavor and gassiness detracts from the overall experience."
"Fairly unique stout. Very nice creamy mouthfeel."
"Tons of smoky malt, dark, bitter chocolate and prunes in the taste. Mouthfeel is very thin with high carbonation. This is interesting but not for me."
"A: A hard pour resulted in a good two inches of brown cottony head, lots of lacing around the edge, a dark chocolate brown - 4.25, S: Lots of specialty malts, tons of grain and charring, a slight burnt cherry smell as well, chocolate and coffee - 3.75, T: There's a subtle sweetness to the beer, otherwise a nice spattering of grain, mild raisin and date flavors - 4.25, M: Touch of graininess, medium body with a little warm syrupy texture - 4.50, D: A very pleasant beer, not an aggressive stout but a very easy drinking stout - 4.00"
"D: Jeez! Can Pretty Things do no wrong? This is an excellent winter seasonal. Strong and robust without being too heavy and syrupy. Loved the lingering smokiness and roasty prickle."
"Taste: hmmm, fruitier than I expected a stout to be. Still...very tasty. Bitter chocolates, coffee on the back side of the tongue. Malty...creamy...complex. The fruity flavors up front: cherry perhaps? Wow, interesting stout, and very good!"
"D- Moderate. I'd have another one. A unique beer. Perhaps its an acquired taste... but my least favorite Pretty Things to date. That's the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.. still love most of their beers."
"I recommend this one highly."
"Pours a black color with a dark tan creamy head that settles into a rocky cap. The aroma is of caramel, light tin and a sweet milk stout. If an aroma can smell silky this does. The aroma is not strong but sure is smooth. The taste is quite mellow, with bitter and milk chocolate, and roasted malt. The feel of this brew is outrageous. It has an obvious full body but feels light and fluffy; soft carbonation leads to a very smooth and silky feel, much like a frothy head to a milk shake. Finishes with a light roasted malt bitterness. A very silky stout indeed. Not huge on flavor but that is fine as it has a solid roasted malt flavor."
"Medium to low carbonation with a borderline oily mouthfeel. I'm unsure how to compare this to other american stouts. It's kind of at an in-between profile ABV-wise. (What the hell is a Sylvan Stout anyway?) Overall, I kind of feel like this beer is underwhelming - it's solid and there's nothing wrong with it, but I wouldn't purchase it again just because of it's price point and availability. There are some better options out there that I could almost get a 6pk of for the price of this 22oz. Still, I am glad to have tried another beer from a brewery that has yet to disappoint."
"Pour produces an amazing 3 fingers of frothy brown head. Milkshake like. Color of the body is a very dark brown, almost black. Aroma contains notes of roasted barley, chocolate malt, mild black cherry tones. This beer just appears and smells hearty and wholesome. Taste contains flavors up front of roasted malt grain that mellows out. When this happens, more chocolate malt can be tasted. Fruity notes pick up at the center. Black cherry, some citris from what is the beginning of a nice hop bitterness to this beer. Finish keeps the hop flavors and comes in with a bit of a tobacco hint. Aftertaste leaves the roasted, charry flavor from the grains and bittering hops dancing on the palate. At 7%, this beer is very drinkable and delicious."
"The taste will not disappoint. The beer gets high marks for overall creaminess, and slight oily quality on the tongue. It has a full palate of dark malts, a touch of dark chocolate, and coffee flavors. There is just a touch of sweeter malts and a little bit of prickliness at the very beginning, but this segues out into more bittering flavors. The beer has a strong roasted quality, and is loaded with dark unsweetened malts. There is less chocolate flavors than I would have liked. The coffee is slight as well, which is okay by me. It is the charred, dark malts and roasted flavors, and slight bittering dryness in the finish that defines this beer. It is a substantial, full palated affair."
"A moderate stout profile--there's notable alcohol in the swallow. The body is lighter than most stouts, but the carbonation is low enough to have the beer feel right. The aftertaste has toasted bread flavors with a light plum relish."
"Smokiness makes this beer."
"22 ounce bomber, with a cutsie paper tab over the cap, that lets me know it was ""Bottled November 2009"" Nice, fresh and tasty beer. Always interested in giving a new brew from hyper artisinal Pretty Things a try. Pours pretty darn near black, the head also is a quite dark shade of mocha. Head is of moderate height, and shows much better then average staying power, then turns to a thick film and collar and leaves slippery and sliding sheeting and ample ridges and ripples of lacing. The sniff emits healthy notes of vanilla, dark malt, raisins, and chocolate. Rich and flavorfull stout, more of the same flavors on the tongue and mouth. Smooth and comfortable mouthfeel. More then typical roastyness. After trying several of the other eclectic PT brews, I was unsure of what to expect from a ""Sylvan Stout"" (whatever that is) from them. What I got was a pretty straight ahead, hearty/robust/flavorful and underneath it all, tasty and enjoyable stout. Nice job and well worth giving this one a try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and biting with a big bite of carbonation, keeping it from being too overbearing and making it nicely drinkable."
"Overall, probably not my favorite Pretty Things, but overall very good. Gotta love the artwork and these guys are doing great things."
"If I may, an edit to this review as I had the new batch on draft tonight 10/19/10. It is nothing like I remember before, with sour, tart cherries in the mouth right away. [I don't want to say infection, right away, though it very well could be.] Then it becomes extremely sweet, like a milk stout, with subtle tobacco, leather, molasses, and light cherry wood smoke notes followed by a bitter hop taste. It looks good, but not all that drinkable. The numbers I give it here are A--4.5, S--4, T--3, M--4, D--3."
"I know it's not a fair comparison but this is what I want Guinness to taste like any time I order a pint."
"overall a truly impressive beer..not sure what a sylvan stout is but i like it and wish i could get it here.."
"This seasonal offering is absolutely delicious and superbly flavorful. I would say that a couple glasses of this may be filling, but, it would work perfectly as a digestif and will definitely keep you warm on a cold winter's night."
"I have had this beer twice since it was just released in bombers, and I have had mixed feelings on it. Lets see how it is out of the bottle. Appearance is quite dark, with some rocky tan heading that is slow to settle. It has the aroma of an export stout, with some burnt coffee bean, bitter in places, and a hint of smoke. One gets a good dose of bitter coffee, smoke, and slight chocolate from the taste. Mouthfeel is relatively heavy, making it a sipper for me. Alcohol is well hidden within all that smoke. Not half bad...I do not really get the Belgian aspect of this beer, but it certainly passes for me as an export or robust stout. On the lower end of the totem pole as far as Pretty Things beers go, but worth a try no doubt. Cheers"
"D: It is a nice beer to try, especially if you are in the mood for something a little different. It is a bit more of a winter warmer in my opinion and worth trying once, but this is not my favorite from Pretty things"
"F: It finishes semi bitter and a nice slight hoppy flavor. The rich creamy chocolate also sticks around, giving you memories of being a kid and drinking the chocolate milk from the carton. Most of the roasted malt and coffee flavors have subsided by the finish. The bitter earthy charred stout-like flavors present themselves quite a bit at the end, probably accentuated by the bittering hops. Although, except for the coat of chocolate and caramel that coats the mouth and tongue, it finishes pretty clean."
"Brewed out of the now defunct Buzzards Bay Brewery."
