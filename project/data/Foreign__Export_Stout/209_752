4.1,1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/29/2012. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, molasses, light char, raisin, plum, herbal, floral, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of dark/roasted malt and moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, molasses, light char, raisin, herbal, floral, light pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, molasses, herbal, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy hops; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, smooth, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent foreign stout. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roast malt and earthy hops flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 05, 2014"

The aroma is very deep roasted malt, nothing really complex but enjoyable in its simplicity. The taste has a little more depth, with some hints of coffee and some pleasant alcohol esters. It's a little thinner in the style of an Irish Dry Stout but has a pleasant feeling on the palate. A great full-flavored stout that packs a punch.","delta490","Mar 30, 2014"

The Foreign Extra Stout takes those signature Guinness flavors and turns them up to 11. There are hints of chocolate, sweet malts, and a slight char that leaves a nice bitterness on the palate. It has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel that is heavier than the regular Guinness, but still lighter than expected. The Foreign Extra Stout is the epitome of Guinness and so good.","brurevu","Sep 18, 2013"

APPEARANCE: velvet black body, dense and appreciable; thick brown head that laces beautifully, as a doily,, almost symmetrically around the glass... AROMA: nice lactic impact; hops are less profiled--oat, peat and sugars are prominent... PALATE: high and hard, warming and medium-bodied; full at the throat...TASTE: slightly chocolaty and pleasantly milky; unlike the draught, a hardened smoky finish that demands attention; hops are well-placed, coupling with the malts to present a substantial, complex stout... OVERALL: the less-requested Guinness again reminds me why the road less traveled in beer circles often makes the more rewarding difference...this beer delivers with a welcome heft and an ABV that belies its enjoyable sip. A shame this beer does not accompany the "three beers strong" mix pack--trade the Harp for this? In a heartbeat...","dacrza1","Aug 03, 2013"

This Extra has a good character and was balanced well. Very less heavy than regular Guinness draught. Can not mention anything about lacing as I just enjoyed it in the bottle.

Pours a pitch black beautiful color with a massive three fourths the mug mocha colored head which is slowly receding to the body below, after a while this leaves a two finger thick head with a lacing. The smells are of dark roasted malts, the guinness burnt smells, a little hops. The feel is somewhere between medium to thick and creamy very nice. The taste is outstanding, plenty of dark roasted malts combined with a noticeable hop bite and a little alcohol burn, this is pretty great, better than the original.","DavidST","Dec 30, 2012"

Tastes very dry with bittersweet notes and candied figs, dark fruit, and some molasses. Alcohol seems well hidden.

Fortunately, there is the Foreign Export/Stout version(s), and it is a face-saver for the most well-known brewery in Dublin. While there are plenty of better stouts, the Guinness Foreign Extra is a good Irish dry stout. If you like craft beer and you've had the (regular) version of the beer, then you must seek this out and have one. It's an important representative in the House of Stouts, and a good beer to be familiar with.","Greywulfken","Sep 22, 2012"

It carries a big taste without the big characteristics with makes it approachable. A solid brew and about as sessionable as the style permits.","TubaManJack","Jun 23, 2012"
3.95,-2.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"11.2oz bottle poured into a snifter, pours black with a frothy beige head that leaves good retention and lacing on the glass. Aromas are chocolate, nibs, roasted barley, molasses, and caramel. Tastes are molasses, roasty, sweet, dark chocolate, delicately hopped, yet has a roasty bitterness, lots of fig and date in there as well. Mouth is on the thinner side of medium, but is creamy and smooth. Overall, one of the better foreign stouts out there. Guinness needs to just brew this one, it's by far their best.","barnzy78","Jun 22, 2012"

The dense, deep-tan head looked like the top of an ice cream float. Color was a deep, dark-brown with cola highlights at the edges. The nose was very chocolaty with an underlying roastiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a definite hop/roasted barley bite on the tongue. This taste, along with its relatively high ABV, was a real revelation for this self-avowed hophead. This was not a Black IPA, but instead a hoppy dry stout. Wow! Finish was very dry, almost gaspingly so and I could not wait until my next sip.

The aromas of dark roasted malt and dark chocolate dominate. There's also a hint of extra sweetness in the smell. The flavor is sweeter than the classic Guinness flavor with an extra punch from the alcohol. There are flavors of dark roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and molasses. This is a bolder version of the Guinness we've all enjoyed and the flavors are still well balanced. The alcohol is not overpowering. The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Like the original, it is very drinkable. Overall, this is an excellent Irish stout and easily one of the best I've had from the style.

The pour was deep brown coming out of the bottle, but in the glass it looked very black. The head that formed showed the classic cascading action to grow to four or five fingers thick before settling down to a large mass crowing above the rim of the pint glass. The aroma was roasty and robust with a generous helping of coffee, brown sugar, and toffee. The taste was excellently balanced between cream, chocolate, coffee, and molasses flavors. Not as aggressive as many newer variations of the style, but very approachable as a result. A little thin in the mouthfeel, but the carbonation made it feel silky smooth. From my reading about the history of Guinness, this is probably closest to the original recipe from last century than the watered down mainstream variant sold today. People had it better back then.","rajendra82","Jan 04, 2012"

A thick inch and half high head forms, creamy beige in color that settles on top and goes no where. A sweet dark bread fragrance is there at the start, followed by dried fruit and some raisons, with a touch of coffee. The aroma does finish with yeasty sort of twang at the end, making your nose twitch slightly. The dark bread from the aroma hits the palate in the taste right off the bat that then blends to a yeasty twang. The taste finishes with a burnt grain bitterness and hoppy bitterness of citrus and grass. A thin watery feel that gains weight as it crosses the palate, finishing with mild dryness at the end. This beer was not what I expected the feel stayed the same for a Guinness and the color was probably darker than the usual offering. The things that made this different were the taste and aroma both of which were much better than the typical pint you would get anywhere else, a very good beer.","cameraman","Nov 11, 2011"

Body is perfect and so is carbonation for the style. Finish is like flavor and some coffee and cocoa show up - fairly long. An alternate to a world classic for the far flungs markets of Diageo.","drpimento","Oct 14, 2011"

The molasses is overpowering, and that was the only flavor I could find in the heavy mouthfeel. Naturally, when someone tries a beer twice one hopes to be more impressed.

4.11,1.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Back in my late teens when I started frequenting the Dickens Inn in old city Philadelphia, drinking a pint of Guinness made me feel like a sophisticated adult beyond my years. I had more pints of Guinness by my 21st birthday than I've had of any beer since, more than likely. This is NOT the Guinness Stout I cut my teeth on. This poured beautifully from a bottle, and without the need of some kinda widget. The two finger head didn't have nearly the resiliency of Guinness past, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The one thing I notice right away is this doesn't feel nearly as heavy in the mouth. This feels a lot thinner...and warmer. There's definitely a presence of alcohol in this that doesn't come through on the normal shit. This is smooth. I could drink a lot more of these. I pulled this out of the fridge and poured without warming. I've been drinking it bit by bit as it's gone from fridge temp, warming through to the ambient temperature in the house. As it warms, it becomes SO complex. I think I'm going to pull a couple and just let them sit at room, and go straight into a glass for my next sessions with this guy. All in all, this is a very pleasant surprise. One of the oldest beers out there has finally blossomed into what it always aspired to be. Righteous.","Retail1LO","Aug 07, 2011"
4.3,5.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Well done guys, but why did it take so long for you to share this gem with us here in the states?

3.68,-9.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Coming from a non-Guinness drinker, this was not a bad beer. The flavor was almost too much for me at the beginning, but after drinking a couple, I was alright with it. The sweet malty flavors really come a live in your belly and fill you up. Compared to your basic, everyday Guinness, the carmel flavors are much more apparent in the Foreign Extra. I considered this my after dinner desert and drank it straight from the bottle, as there were no glasses availablet to me. As you can imagine, the color is dark as night. I recommend this, especially for any skeptical drinkers who typically pass on Guinness.","BEERME528","Aug 01, 2011"

4.06,0,5,4,4,4,4,"Pours pitch black with a good three finger of puffy light brown head. The head lasts a good ten minutes. Plentiful lacing. Aroma is molasses, prunes, a hint of licorice. Taste is sweet molasses some fruit (raisens?) with a strong hoppy bitterness that almost matches the sweetness. The body is very full and well carbonated. Halfway finished there is still a modest amount of head. Nice sweet and dry bitter finish. Best version of Guinness so far IMO.","Spikester","Jul 23, 2011"
3.73,-8.1,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"O: As a huge stout fan, I approve of this brew. But just barely.

Nice distinct rings of bubbly lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of roasted malt, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate. There is also a slight cola aroma on this one. Taste is of roasted malt and vanilla cola flavors. There is a chocolate covered coffee bean quality in the mouth as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation making for a crisp yet creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout from Guinness that is much better than their normal variety. This is my first of the style and I would definitely get this one again in the future.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 15, 2011"

Pours looking like a nice heavy stout, the head falls quickly. What I'm getting from this is an amplified Guinness Extra Stout. Stronger roasted flavor, which adds a bit of acidity and bitterness, like a dark coffee. Like the 'standard' Guinness I'm finding it with not enough body, especially for the high ABV. The beer isn't bad, but you won't find me paying $9 for it again.","wcintula","Jul 07, 2011"

It's right up front w/ the nose, almost enveloping the area you are in. Then comes the burnt chocolate & roasted malt. Follow this up w/ the bitterness from the hops & that unmistakable Stout bite makes this a beer to go back to. Very good. I could see myself drinking several of these in a sitting. Would pair nicely w/ a wide range of foods as well. Prosit!","HaysAmerica","Jul 04, 2011"
4.2,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This one poured out as a very dark brown color. The head was creamy and thick looking. The lacing on the glass was quite impressive, leaves plenty of suds down the glass. The smell of the beer seems to have a bit more of a hop presence that isn't usually common from Guinness. The other aromas consist of some chocolate and some really burnt toast. The taste is very dry and bitter, there is a light amount of creaminess but it's got more bite than most other products from St. James. The mouthfeel isn't overly heavy, I felt that it wasn't nearly as heavy as some stouts out there. The body was a bit thicker than the normal extra stout they make. Overall I found this stout to be pretty enjoyable from start to finish. I would enjoy having this one again.","Knapp85","Jul 01, 2011"
3.19,-21.4,4.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Overall, I must say that I am an American and enjoy beer brewed on this side of the pond.

Thanks to my local purveyor for the sample.","azdback","Jun 29, 2011"
3.33,-18,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall: Not your average Guinness. If you want extra kick, this is your beer. If you're looking for the creamy coffee malt to appear more, go with the Draught or regular Extra Stout.","fountainofyouth","Jun 25, 2011"

4.06,0,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours from the 11.2 oz bottle an extremely dark brown (almost black) color with a giant, thick, foamy tan head that conjures up images of a root beer float. Can only guess at the carbonation level at this point, since there's no seeing through the darkness. Aroma is of dark unsweetened chocolate & black coffee, but it's surprisingly and somewhat disappointingly faint. 1st sip brings a smooth, creamy gift of the aforementioned chocolate and coffee, with a dose of heavily roasted (almost "burnt") malt. there's also a hint of smokiness with a heavy dose of hops bitterness on the back end that lingers on the swallow. Mouthfeel is smooth and robust without being overly heavy. Overall, a beer that is well worthy of its legendary status.","CJfromPhilly","May 28, 2011"

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, apples, and subtle chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, caramel, milk chocolate, subtle peat, and very very slight fruit. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. WAY better than its American counter-part. Really surprised at this one and really glad I got a chance to try it.

This is made with regards to an old recipe that Guiness used for their export beers and has some "intentionally" skunked brew added in. And so as not to bore you with details...The pour is opaque jet black joined by a soapy beige head that dissapates much quicker then the typical "nitroed" version. Smell is oatey, malty and not like an OG Guiness. Taste is obviously similar to smell but with higher notes of dark chocolate and some lingering bitterness. For 7.5%ABV it hides the alcohol very well and is no where near as creamy as the Guiness everyone knows so well. Did that just rhyme? Which brings me to my next point, this brew will undoubtedly leave you feeling full and "fuzzy buzzy".","RashyGrillCook","May 02, 2011"

The foreign extra backs more of a punch and tastes more like a normal stout. It has a great aroma and packs a ton of flavor. It is also more complex; the flavors develop and change as the beer makes its way down the throat. In other words: This is different from your normal Guinness, and it is worth spending the extra money.","ianjsullivan","Apr 08, 2011"

4.17,2.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"I have been meaning to try this for a while. I poured a couple in to a one liter boot glass. Color is very dark brown, with some ruby hues at the toe and heel of the glass. About two fingers of tan heading spring up, but fade away quickly in to a lace that remains till the end. A big creamy nose we have here, with some roasted malt, sweet cream, dark chocolate and a hint of dark fruit. The taste brings me back to my first Guinness back in high school, with lots of roasted character along with bitter dark chocolate, and a long bready finish. The aftertaste stays with you for a while, making you want to continue. It is a little bitter around the edges, yet stays smooth, if that makes any sense. The body feels heavier than the usual Extra Stout or Draught, which I am guessing is a result of the extra addition of malt and hops. A hint of alcohol can be tasted, but doesn't become overwhelming at all. Like I said before, this reminds me of my first encounters with Guinness, which really was the first dark beer I had ever tasted. Hopefully this version will find a home in a lot of the Irish pubs where the two others are regulars. Cheers","jamie2dope","Apr 06, 2011"

What can I say of flavor/body that isn't known? Smooth, creamy, goes down easy, a lighter-bodied stout that has a delicate balance of a grainy, hoppy frontbite and then passes clean and mellow with a strong malt base. Roasted, dry malts mix with sweet malts like caramel and a touch of chocolate so in other words after the hoppy, prickly taste that first hits your tongue you get that sturdy dry/sweet malt profile one loves from a stout and then finishes with a crisp finish.

The usual guinness has 4.5% where as this is around 7.5% and after a few you will actually feel the difference.

The head is a big, chunky, light milk-chocolate coloring that settles into a one inch vision after the beautiful cascade. Chocolate, coffee, toffee, and molasses invade the nasal cavity on first smells, and further investigation gives off a slightly bitter and slightly sour scent. The beer is subtle in it's initial flavors, and it slowly reveals some smokey roast flavors, darkly sweet caramel and molasses malt, and a very sneaky hoppiness in the very deep background. There is also a roasted meat quality to the flavor, as well, although I have a hard time pinpointing it to anything more than that. The beer is extremely smooth and creamy, and the flavors quickly depart the mouth, leaving a slightly sweet and rich aftertaste. Delicious!","GarthDanielson","Mar 17, 2011"

Looks like beautiful brown clouds! Bursting with delicious smells-slight hit of EtOH allows the nose to take up a flowing smell onslaught of toffee, really dark chocolate and dark caramel. You may also pick up some of the hops in the nose, but they will hit you in the taste. Tastes first of very dark chocolate, and retains a flavour of coffee throughout. The sweetness of the toffee, ethanol and chocolate at the beginning of the taste are complemented wonderfully by the hop bitterness which lingers throughout with the coffee. The beer feels very smooth and pleasing and invites you to take another sip. Really a spectacular stout...probably one of the best in the world!","Beerbluesbiology","Mar 11, 2011"

Taste follows smell with milk chocolate on the front of your tongue followed by a nice roasted malt flavor. Some residual hop bitterness as the beer goes down.

This is honestly a superb beer, and I'm glad after trying all the lesser varieties of Guinness, I've finally found one that I can love whole-heartedly.

There's an almost chalky feel, maybe resinous. It's a luscious flavorful stout with more typical stout flavors than the classic Guiness Stout.

The beer is nearly impenatrably black. The nose is molasses, tropical fruit, and a spiciness I can't quite identify. Molasses is also apparent in the flavor, with a nice roastiness, light coffee notes, and again some tropical fruit. Hops contributes a nice bitterness and dryness on the finish. Lots of carbonation supports the beer, which is heavier than "draft" Guinness but still of moderate body. I could drink a few of these, although I fear after 3 or 4 I wouldn't be able to stand up.

Black color is nothing but expected. Uniting sweet aroma with deli- cate roasted grain, Madeira-alcohol and a faintness of hop. Silky smoothness gives the beer a gentle landing on the palate. Mild-roasted flavors pull on the taste buds, while currant berries and a warming alcohol show its size and complexity. Modest hopping, though the sweetness stays in control (or at least the roasted flavors and alcohol keep it in check). Bittersweet finish with a breath of alcohol lingering.

Taste follows with decent chocolate, roasted, and sweet malt notes, with an underlying hint of booze. A bit hoppy too--some nice bitterness in there. Something is a bit off to me, maybe a musty or stale flavor in there somewhere though I can't really pin it down. Not a bad beer by any means, but not a spectacular stout either.

Interesting blend of flavors finishes heaviliy roasted malts/burnt charred malt character in the finish, with sour mash bring hints of cherry/tart fruit. Strong earthy/herbal hoppiness meshed within the dark malt profile. I like the way this beer is going down medium bodied sturdy carbonation level, the bitter dark roasts brings some astringency on the palate finishes heavy with dry dark roasts/bittering hops. Drinability overall is very nice, alcohol is well hidden the booze is not overpowering. Well crafted and thought out beefier version of the beloved Guinness. I've heard people talk about Foregin/Export version of Guinness, I'm glad they decided to release this stateside. Excellent rich, robust/hoppy form of Guinness that I truly enjoy and will advocate to others so they don't miss out.","WVbeergeek","Jan 14, 2011"

The aroma is of graham cracker, roasted malt, cream, and milk chocolate. This is a very pleasing aroma. The taste is full of roasted malt with hints of dark chocolate. The taste isn't quite as complex as the aroma, but is still interesting. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture.

The taste is a rich, perfect melding of bitter french roast coffee, dark chocolate, and burnt marshmallows. The finish is drying, but not dry, and the mouthfeel is full and soft.

There is a touch of bitter dark chocolate in the background as well. Dry roast is what really sticks with me. Impressive in that this is fairly complex, though I'll say that the feel did not really help the flavor, as the finish was too dry for my liking.

Nose reveals a trace of roast and sour lactic acid. Taste expresses char up front, more sour watery lactic acid, a slightly metallic quality and a bitter acrid aftertaste.

Flavor is more from the unroasted malt than the bitter roasted malt. Quite a bit of chocolate malt can be tasted. Alcohol is strong in the finish and that lowers my score a little.

The taste is clean enough with a good solid bitterness and a malty characteristic that kind of reminds me of a Mallo bar. Compared to the Guinness regular Extra Stout the alcohol is more notable.

4.68,15.3,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Nearly flawless pour - coal black, a voluminous mocha-shaded head - lasting, creamy, dimpled - that leaves handsome drapes of lacing - as much as one associates a thick, creamy, dense head with Guinness (Draught) - this may be why I hesitate to give perfect marks to the look (but it's damn close). Moving on, the aroma is surprisingly not as rich the flavor - just lightly bitter/roasty and sweet, yet naturally appealing. My oh my, does this taste and drink wonderfully! The bitterness kicks up a couple notches, though never coming off biting or feeling astringent. There is a light, smooth acidity that lingers from a moderate-strength roasty foundation - but just a soft touch. Instead of chocolate flavors (which I was half expecting), I found subtle vanilla notes, starting in the tail of the middle through the finish. Delightful. Add to all of this some molasses flavors and light viscosity and an almost perfect mid-range degree of body, and this is a thoroughly well-balanced, highly enjoyable export stout - and one of the best no-frills, stronger stouts I've had.

This beer isn't able to be penetrated by light and has a nice thick tan foam that you can easily sit a bottle cap on (I actually try it from time to time, this one floated longer than most). The smell is mainly of coffee and roasted dark chocolate. There seems to be a decent light hop aroma making its way through to the nose accompanied by some molasses for sweetness. There is a lot of burnt taste in this beer, I know it's too the style but it takes some getting used to. I honestly didn't think that I would be able to taste the distinctive Guinness sour flavor, but there it is waiting for me in the aftertaste. I didn't really expect to taste the liquor in this beer, but it makes itself known as well. With all those notes it still remains predominantly a roasted dark chocolate flavor adding some burnt biscuit taste as well. The liqour roast combo just doesn't seem to work right, and I don't know why. It's very velvety on the tongue, but the bitterness mixed with the astringency of the beer removes it from the perfect pantheon I would have hoped for. Overall this is a very good beer, and I would have it again if I'm in the mood for deep roast.","Vdubb86","Nov 03, 2010"

Drinkability is fairly decent. It's priced a little higher than it should be at $11 a 4-pack of 11.2 oz bottles.

Indeed a tasty Guinness stout with the roasted malt really coming through. It drinks fairly easy and the 7.5abv is well hidden.","Gmann","Oct 30, 2010"

4.17,2.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, dark fruit, molasses, dark chocolate and coffee. The brew tastes like roasted and burnt/charred malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and some hops. Finish is mostly roasty and bitter, but some sweetness kicks in as the beer warms up. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and a bit coating, and it's also well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's very smooth and goes down easy enough. I think this is a solid brew, it's worth trying.","bluejacket74","Oct 30, 2010"

You could find the Extra Stout in bottles, but everyone wanted the draught. Once they started releasing that in cans, then all I heard was that I needed the FES. This is one of the beers that got me into craft beer. It's nice to finally experience in what's supposed to be its best form.","djmichaelk","Oct 30, 2010"
4.1,1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Finally available in these parts. It pours a dark garnet-tinted black-brown topped by a housing project of sandstone foam. The nose comprises light coffee, pretzels, very light roasted malts, salted cashews, and a touch of dark wheat. The taste kicks the roast up a bit, adding a very mild touch of bitter dark chocolate and finishing with a small scraping of charcoal. The body is a strong medium, with a very-light moderate carbonation, a smoothly chewy feel, and a fairly dry finish. Overall, this is indeed a step-up from the normal Guinness, but not really that big of one. It is definitely denser and drier, with more of a roasted character, but the drinkability remains the same, and the flavors don't really "pop", especially compared to other FES examples. Honestly, not all that different from the normal GES, but it is slightly different (and for the better).","TMoney2591","Oct 29, 2010"

No big hop whiffs despite talk about extra high hopping. The taste definitely has peat and smokyness, with an assertive bitterness reminding you that this is the real thing. Mouthfeel is full but not overly rich. The alcohol in this beer is fairly well hidden. I guess the question would ultimately be, how does this offering rate among all the strong craft stouts? It will be a tough sell, the craft beer makers are making some finely made beers that make this beer pale in comparison.

There's a bit more going on flavor-wise though. A little bit of chocolate leads things off, before that same espresso/sour combo comes in as the main act. A subtle punch of citrus and spice close things out rather nicely. The body is suitably creamy, but the beer is a bit overcarbonated for a stout. It's to the point where it's become a little bit distracting. It's about time that Guinness FES made it's way to the US, it's probably my favorite Guinness brew, but it's still a step or two below top notch.","axeman9182","Oct 21, 2010"

The beer is very dark black, although not completely solid: a dark brown translucency is present through the pour and in the shallows of the glass. The beer is an impressive site, though...the head is mammoth and seriously solid. It's a dark tan, nearly nut-brown color, and it leaves intricate lace. Nice. The aroma is a mix of alcohol, a touch of malt, and heavily roasted (burnt?) malt. It has a serious booze quality, and I didn't expect the malt, considering it's not really present in the normal Guinness ES or Draught. The taste is full of chocolate, coffee, and roasted grain flavor. The beer presents more alcohol in the flavor than is really present in the ABV...rather than hiding it, it become part of the flavor. Fairly heavy in body, the beer is satisfying and smooth at the same time. It's a pretty dry stout, but there's more sweetness than expected. I found it satisfying and solid.

I shall cut the chase and go straight to the beer; this one pours out opague very dark brown black with a thick creamy, rocky head that refuses to settle without sitting for a good amount of time. Smells of caramel, coffee and burnt or roasted malts; very light chocolate hint perhaps. The beer enters with a light coffee note which transforms into thick creamy roasted malts with a certain milkiness to it. When I am near the finish, I sense chocolate creeping in and there's also some dark fruits here which lasts well into the after taste. Light caramel, coffee hints show up here and there and the milkiness was pretty obvious after its initial attack on the palates. The taste exhibits an increasing level of bitterness which hits a crescendo in the finish but somehow I felt that I was able to contain the bitterness much better than the last time and I can really enjoy this one this time. The after taste started off with roasted malts and coffee and this quickly moved on to plums and dates with the malts constantly sitting at the back and dark malty fruity aromas on the nose throughout the after taste. Generally this one gets better as it warms; the mouth feel was rich, creamy, chunky and thick, needless to say with average carbonation (as it warms) and topping things up a creamy smoothness as it goes down. Great experience with a great stout; let's see what the Special Export variant has to offer.","basica","Nov 15, 2007"

Guinness is swimming in the deep end of the pool when they brew this. The color is inky black, and the head is a rich brown as opposed to the light tan of their draught. The aroma and taste is split evenly between the roasted barley and carmelized sugar flavors that range from toffee to molasses. This is a rather full-bodied beer, with a degree of sweetness in the aftertaste that is balanced by the roasted grain flavors and a hop bitterness that is more prominent than in the draught. The intensity of the toffee/molasses flavors makes two bottles plenty.

Mouthfeel is a little on the think side, nicely suited to the ABV and taste. I've pretty much grown up on this stout so have spent many days and night drinking it. its strong but its definately drinkable, and works as a session beer.

The aroma was much sweeter than I was expecting a Guinness to be. Some dark fruits coupled with caramel and possibly some molasses. Plenty of malt in the nose, with a really fantastic nuttiness. An extraordinary nose for an export stout. The flavor is very full, slightly reminescent of Guinness' Extra Stout, but with more depth. Up front, the taste is very robust - a nice presence of roasted barley and black malts, coffee is also apparent. Underneath this malty facade lies some nice bitter chocolate and caramel flavors. The robust malts eventually give way to a definite creaminess along with a hint of dark fruit sweetness. That creamy flavor leads into some spicy hops that help finish things off.

A strong roasted black malt aroma leaned towards being burnt but the alcohol edge overcame that. Bittersweet chocolates and french roast sumatra coffee are the aromatic flavors. Darker fruity plums peak out as well. Taste is smoother than I was expecting. Alcohol delivers a punch right from the start but is never heavy or overdone. Burnt espresso is dominate. Roasted grains and smokey peat are in there deep. Notes of vanilla come and go. A half and half like creaminess comes along and more of a milk chocolate flavor develops toward the finish. In the end the alcohol and espresso are all I'm left with. This is a sipper but quite an enjoyable sipper at that.","granger10","Mar 15, 2006"

Foreign Extra Stout has a rich malty aroma with notes of molasses, although this isn't quite as strong or interesting as expected. The flavor is thick and malty. Rich, sweet malts are most apparent and remind me of toffee or molasses. An underlying roasted malt flavor provides a nice counterpoint to the rich sweetness.

The nose is mild, featuring roasted nuts and carmel, but also including something a bit on the sour side. The mouth is a bit thinner than it should be, and very well carbonated. The taste definitely starts out with something like unripened plum to go with the burnt malt and very strong dry bitterness. Upon further reflection, the taste reminds a bit of port wine, with an espresso chaser. The bitterness dominates ever more as we move into the finish, and lingers long into the aftertaste, although the sour never really fades, either.

Assertive, drying hop bitterness. Oily, dark chocolate notes surface as the beer warms. Medium bodied and dangerously dry, yet pleasantly viscous in mouthfeel.

Subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well. Still, the appearance of this stout is near faultless. The nose isnt very talkative; I get suggestions of roast, some char as well. In the way back is a hint of soft, caramel and toffee. The bouquet is disappointing; there really isnt much to it. It is not inviting because there is so little aroma. Apathetic. The palate is much improved. This is unlike any other Guinness Ive had. First of all, I can taste alcohol and it is warm and yummy. My bottle proclaims, 6.5% abv. As expected there is a fair amount of roasty flavors that produce notes of coffee and char. Pleasant. Towards the finish is a lovely toffee, caramel flavor. Then an astringent bitterness kicks in and lasts into the aftertaste. I really like the whole package here; there is heat and roast with hints of caramel and bitterness. This is a very good (Export) Stout; the complexities are apparent and welcomed. It is tasty! The body is a little fuller than medium, it is ideally heavy while not being sluggish, the carbonation is moderately low but appropriate. The mouthfeel is good, better than ordinary.

In any case, it was creamy and smooth with a medium to full body, and these were huge pluses. The alcohol level is subtle.
