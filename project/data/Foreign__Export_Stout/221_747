3.42,-2,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Small format 300 ml bottle poured into a Guinness glass. A dark blackish brown, opaque and with a decent amount of light tawny brown head that breaks quickly. Micheal Lewis includes detailed tech specs for this beer in his Classic Beer Style Series book on Stout. Of note, t. his beer contains caramel coloring and brewer's corn syrup (ugh) and the brewer saw fit to note that the beer employs a ""special beer flavoring extract"" for flavor maturation. Um, what the fuck? That sounds sinister but I suppose it could mean almost anything, including adding soured or otherwise aged beer to fresh batches. In any event, my expectations were not terribly high and perhaps because of this, the beer exceeded them. Aroma includes the expected coffee and chocolate elements but there is also a distinct graininess that comes off like cheap six-row malt and a fruity character that comes off a bit like tart red wine and cherry syrup. This tartness carries over onto the palate as well, a vinous character that I've encountered in other stouts and porters here and there. Not unwelcome amidst the smoky caramel and chocolate milk flavors, maybe a little molasses. Comes off as overly attenuated with the body too thin and the carbonation too high. Finishes rather grainy and astringent, almost a low grade alcohol burn. The sweetness becomes cloying quite quickly and this could be one of the sweetest stouts I've sampled to date. Still, not undrinkable and a good example of the style from a non-craft island brewery.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 04, 2014"

Its aroma was a mix of the good and not quite so good…a sweet chocolate milk with a not so pleasant herbal smell thrown in for good measure. Luckily the flavour was more pleasant than the aroma, a boozy sweet chocolate milk with a hint of dark roasted coffee..quite nice though not as flavourful as most North American stouts. Almost no bitterness to this beer. The carbonation was soft as you would expect from a stout, detectable more at the back of the throat than on the tongue, and the beer had a creamy mouth feel. I would call this brew medium bodied on balance, and reasonably priced at $2.00 per 300 ml bottle. Overall, not bad, and given the climate in which it is normally consumed I can understand why this beer is not as rich as its North American counterparts.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Jun 29, 2014"

Sure the hint of roasted malt is there as well as an alcohol scent but there is also this milky sweet smell too and it made me want to take a sip. A very interesting taste too. Very thin for a stout and you can taste the alcohol pretty easy with hints of bitter chocolate and a background of sweetness.

Im not sure if I could drink more than one of these as it's somewhat of a chore to finish only one of these guys from a small 284mL bottle.

The aroma was very fruity with dark fruits like raisins and figs. But it was also slightly roasted at the same time. Roasted dark fruits was an interesting aroma to smell. The taste was also very fruity with the dark fruits, but this time there wasn't a roasted undertone. It was more fruity than anything else. The taste was sweet and fruity with raisins, figs, a tiny touch of sweet roasted malts, a smidge of sweet caramel, and then finished up with sweet yeast. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a sweet and fruity aftertaste of raisins, sweet roasted malts, caramel, and more yeast. This had to be the most fruity and sweet Stout I've ever had before.

That said, while the price on the Red Stripe was still fairly reasonable, it meant the price of the Dragon Stout was excellent (something like just under a buck a bottle when buying singles, and this was at the ""grocery store"" at our resort, where everything was pricey).

Taste is not balanced at all - way too sweet with very little hop or malt balance, however, I could see why this would be brewed this way since the vast majority of people would be drinking this in 90 degree heat, The mouthfeel is rich, creamy, and coats the mouth; it's very nice.

After six days in a resort where their idea of selection was wanbeer (redstripe) and wanlitebeer (redstripe lite) I couldn't take it anymore. This beer only cost me a quarter, it was plesently cool but not too cold. Sweet to the taste with a good thick consistancy and probably a decent head, but it was in a dark bottle. Well worth a shot if your stranded on an island.","faubs","Aug 30, 2006"
3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Saying that, the flavor is a bit simplistic. Smooth, but with a bit of an alcohol spice. Grape-y and medicinal flavors. No real roastedness and not bitter enough for my liking, which is a shame. That being said, I like it, but it's not a very good stout, but a decent enough beer.","Litterbean","Aug 07, 2006"
3.7,6,4,4,4,3,3,"In the end, though, Desnoes & Geddes Dragon Stout is a pretty good - and fairly unique - beer; a good stout that's probably a great compliment to a sweet dessert. There's something in the nose (and to a much lesser extent, the taste) that's a little ""off," but it's a taste that grows on you. I hated my first, and fell in love with my second.

Smells bready-sweet, like an English muffin with jam. Hoo-ah! Speaking of sweet, this beer is almost a cola it's so syrupy. Still manages to have a bit of an alcohol bite, for all that. Barely any roast, just a touch seemingly as a formality. Dragon stout is actually rather interesting as a potential summer/beach drink, but I'd definitely stick to one or a couple at most.","PeatReek","Apr 08, 2006"

It has a sweet chocolate and roasted malt scent that is rich and creamy with some alcohol notes. The taste is decent. It has a thin, yet quite malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm and smooth. It is intensely sweet with loads of crystal malts along with a slight roasted feel. It has a pronounced alcohol taste that hits you up front then fades as it goes down. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an interesting beer. I like sweet beers, but this takes it a little too far. It's an easy drinker even at 7.5% abv. . I didn't hate this beer, but I wouldn't buy it again.","WesWes","Feb 01, 2006"

Are most bottles getting baked by Carribean heat to sugary flatness?","nomad","Jan 15, 2006"

The aroma is pretty weak and contains only a vague, sweet roastiness. The taste is sweet, with malts that have a brown sugar-like taste. A mild roastiness is noted underneath. Towards the finish a mixture of dark fruit flavor and alcohol join the mix. The overall flavors are pretty good, but seem a bit underwhelming for a 7.5% abv stout. There a plenty of better choices than this beer, you need only pick this up if you're stuck in Jamaica.","Gagnonsux","Dec 14, 2005"

I just can't get over how sweet this beer is, it's a bit of a turnoff for me. I like a slight sweetness, but... A bit thin in the mouth too.

3.49,0,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,"BBE date March 06. This beer pours an opaque, nearly black hue with a fast-disappearing brownish head. On the nose, the mixed aroma has roated malts, black-plum's tartly sweetness, slightly sweet-chocolatey note, an implicit caramel flavour, against a mildly perfumy hoppy backdrop. The taste is sweetish, roasted-malty with relatively high alcoholic feel to it, followed by a tinge of sweet note of ripe black-fruits at the back. Pretty straight-forward roasted-malty and slightly toffeeish sweet in the aftertaste, with a very mild, refreshing bitter kick-back. The mouthfeel is quite soft but overall too sweet and the body is overly thin (at times even watery) for a Stout. Would need to think twice before buying and trying this beer again.","wl0307","Jul 13, 2005"

The beer pours jet black with a decent tan head. The nose is toffeish with caramel malts. The first taste was slightly metallic but that blew off after 4 or 5 sips. The beer has a solid mid body with a slightly sweet finish. I like this stout but the Trinidadian Royal extra gets the nod.","canucklehead","Jun 21, 2005"

3.58,2.6,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Basically black in color, opaque, when held to a light a sliver of ruby can be clearly seen around the edges of the glass. A brown head of one finger topped off the beer, the head retention was decent as it took a few moments before it noticeably faded to a tight cap. This cap lasted for almost the entire consumption; still there was no subsequent lacing. The nose is interesting and not necessarily in a good way. There are some light roasty notes, it is a stout after all. I can also detect some lacto-sweetness and some odd mustiness. Airy with a stray note of alcohol that has a licorice twang. The potency is low and the nose doesnt say much. Apathetic. The palate is unique enough to be charming. In honesty the flavor profile is really muddled and nothing is able to shine on its own. But I like the mess. There is a moderate amount of roast, just enough to be stout-like. But what really throws this beer off-kilter is the sweetness that gets mixed with the licorice flavors and fruity, milky, chocolate qualities. The alcohol is also noticeable on the palate; this adds depth but more confusion on the tongue. This beer is flavorful and good enough to drink but I dont think it is very well constructed. From start to finish the beer tastes the same; this gets boring, still it is tasty (in a screwy kind of way). Honestly the high abv is very much needed in this stout without it I would image that the sweetness would be a bit too much. The body is medium at best and the carbonation is moderate. Overall the mouthfeel is barely above average but pleasant. I found this beer to be drinkable and quite likeable actually. I dont think I would want a bomber of this but the dainty 284 ml bottle was the perfect size. My Uncle Allen was kind enough to fork over $1.00 in Ocho Rios, Jamaica and lug this beer back for me. IMO, if you see it, buy it.","bditty187","Aug 06, 2004"
4.08,16.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Hmm, good beer. A shade short of pitch black, with a decent, one finger head with lots of staying power. Nice. Rings of lace stay on the glass like it was glued on, with a lace curtain between each ring. Whoa, sweet smell. Alot of roasted barley, without the burnt smell. Bit of a milk smell as well. Or something similar to milk. Cream? Half and half? Taste kicks your tongue with sweet, roasted barley that's been roasted to near perfection. Chocolatey, creamy and smooth. Still has the dairy quality to it. Chewy mouthfeel. Almost like a pudding. I'll be buying this again. Nice and drinkable. Not a session beer, but a beer that one wll want to drink again. And for something with such a lack of hops, it's quite well balanced. The malt starts out sweet, but the roastiness leaves a bittering aftertaste. I like it.","slitherySOB","Jul 31, 2004"

The flavor is sweetish and fruity up-front, followed by some caramel-tinged grainy malt and roastiness, and then a solid hop edge and a somewhat tangy and alcohol-washed finish. There's an astringency present in the aftertaste that sticks in the mouth unpleasantly.
