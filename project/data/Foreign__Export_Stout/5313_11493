I taste none of its slightly higher than usual ABV. Just a pleasant stout from an unusual place for we in the West to think of beer, but this beer is certainly worth a look. A worthy product of the ancient city of Harar.","BeerDocT","May 29, 2013"

3.72,14.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a dark mahogany amber, thin medium brown head that dissipates to a film and ring around the glass, short lived lacing. Nice aroma of caramel malt with light roasted malt and dark dried fruit. Flavor follows, mild sweet malt with a hint of roastiness, dried fruit. Finishes with pleasant light malt and molasses. A somewhat subdued stout redeemed by a quite pleasant finish. It leans in the direction of a malty bock, but is close enough to an export stout. Medium bodied. I enjoyed this for a low ABV, light stout.","LiquidAmber","Mar 16, 2012"

Sweet raisin and fig aromas with dark grains in the background. On the heavier side of medium bodied with a syrupy feel brought on by the rich carbonation. Dark fruit flavors from beginning to end, highlighted by fig and raisins. Finishes with a fruity, floral hop bitterness.","IronLover","Sep 23, 2011"
3.55,9.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Aroma is smoky and malty, typical for a stout and appealing. I didn't get a good look at the color, but it appears to be the typical opaque sable. Flavor is smoky with a hint of coffee, not as complex as most stouts I have tried but still enjoyable. Texture is firm-bodied and fizzy, leaving a smoky tingle. Think no good beer comes out of Africa? Guess again!","Cyberkedi","Aug 29, 2011"
3.65,12.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I bought this in Frederick MD at the Tajitu Ethiopian restaurant, and the owner told me that Heineken is allegedly trying to buy either this beer or the brewery-- interesting if it happens.

3.33,2.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"I had this in an Ethiopian restaurant in Sacramento. Not sure if it was my hunger or failing taste buds, but I found this to be a decent beer. Malty and not bitter. It has the characteristic chocolate and coffee smell and taste, if diluted a bit. Not the best stout I've had but I'd get this again.","Northsider","Jul 10, 2011"
4.05,24.6,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: Definitely a pretty good beer. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst. It's really nice for the climate in Ethiopia. It gives the taste of a stout without the heaviness. On draft is much better than in the bottle. I'll be looking into getting a tap in my house. Or opening up a restaurant where this is served on tap (and where I can be ALL the time). I like this beer a lot and will definitely be coming often to grab a draft","DannelB","May 17, 2011"
4.07,25.2,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"O - I think this tastes very good. Also, though I've not been to Ethiopia, I picture it even hotter than Florida; this is just about as stout as a brew need be for unfortunately hot locales.","ktrillionaire","Apr 03, 2011"
3.34,2.8,3,4,3.5,2,3,"The mouthfeel is highly-carbonated and thin, a thicker mouthfeel would make this brew much more enjoyable.

3.1,-4.6,3,3,3.5,2,3,"African beer #2, following the very disappointing Tusker. Crossing the border into Ethiopia...better? Fingers are crossed. This guy pours a weak dark burnt brown with some translucence and a minor bit of off-white foamy head. Looks less like a stout, more like a slightly darker brown ale. Not a good start. The nose is cocoa, rye bread crust, yeast, dark wheat, and some faint, unidentified dark fruit. Someone didn't use the bullion cube properly in this soup. The taste is a bit of a step-up, with notes of cocoa, very light coffee, a pinch o' brown sugar, and a bready undercurrent. Not bad, but nowhere near great (or even very good). The body is medium, on the lighter end of that mini-spectrum, with a surprisingly high level of carbonation. The whole thing is exceedingly thin and far too watery. I just can't see myself drinking too much of this, frankly. Looks like the Horn's issues now include brewing (though maybe the political, social, and economic issues are still worse...tough to tell...).","TMoney2591","Mar 16, 2010"

3.12,-4,2,2.5,3,4,4,"Appearance is a lighter than expected very dark amber with minimal head that dissapates quickly having no lace. Smell of sweet dark fruits and chocolate. Taste of lightly sweet dark fruits with the chocolate having light hops and a metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin for a stout, but goes down smooth with good carbonation. I'd have to say that this is my first African stout.","Bookseeb","Jul 20, 2009"
3.15,-3.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Drinkability - interesting beer, not much of a stout but overall not that bad as far as a beer, but that being said, I probally wouldn't get this again.","chickencoop","Beers"
3.33,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"First beer of the night at Addis Red Sea Ethiopian restaurant in the South End. Poured into a glass and formed a small head. Very light in color, mostly brownish red. Not much smell, maybe a hint of cocoa powder. Taste was just above average. Some roasted malt, but not much. Very thin for a stout, but I think it probably suits the environment in which it's brewed. Not heavy at all, very easy to drink. This was more of a dark ale than anything else. I was given a chance to try a stout from Africa, and it didn't let me down too much.","morebeergood","0"
3.9,20,4,4,4,3,4,"Picked some up in Little Ethiopia in Los Angeles. I spotted all kinds of Ethiopian beers and picked up this one from Harrar and a lager to try. This is more of a brown ale in my opinion, pours with a very small head that dissipates immediately. Color was dark brown, no murkiness. Tastes very coffee like with a strong malt flavor, high carbonation with a pleasant yeasty aftertaste . It's a very tasty beer and I will buy some more if I'm ever down there again.","gnbird","Feb 11, 2009"

2.82,-13.2,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Pours a slightly murky cheestnut, which is quite light for the style, with a head that dissipates in about two seconds. No lacing. Aromas of caramel, light maltiness, and minerally as well. Tastes like a sweet stout mixed 1/2 and 1/2 with club soda. The flavors aren't bad, but the beer is light and fizzy- probably the lightest stout of any kind that I've had. Sweet caramel, a slightly treacly character, and mineral water round out the flavors. Mouthfeel is too light and spritzy. This beer is just okay. Too light, spritzy, and sweet. Never had an Ethiopian beer, and since it wasn't a fizzy Euro lager I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, its a fizzy stout instead.","Georgiabeer","Jul 12, 2007"
3.52,8.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Had this at an Ethiopian restaurant in SF. Small bottle poured into a water glass. Dark brown, no head, no lacing, not too dark either. Smelled of roasty malts, more along the lines of a porter than a stout. Tasty. Not much if any alcohol present. Decent mouthfeel, not too remarkable in any way. Some caramel, some raosty malts, but not overly sweet. All in all it was very drinkable, complemented the meal well, and I had another.","Onibubba","Apr 11, 2007"

3.4,4.6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"A little thin of body, but very drinkable. I guess it is hot in ethiopia, and this would be a tasty beer for the climate. While a different style, it has a similar depth as a negro modelo; dark, but drinkable on a sunny day.","henrysunset","Jun 25, 2006"
3.07,-5.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Taste-wise, things fell apart a bit. Some good stouty elements, such as molasses, roasted malt and black licorice, but they didn't blend well together and the whole thing lacked structure. A slight metallic twang also detracted from things. The body needs the most work of all: way too thin for a stout.","vanrassel","Jun 15, 2006"
3.99,22.8,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"sweet honey and chocolate in the taste as well, with some roasted malt bitterness. fairly sweet but not cloying and very pleasantly drinkable. fairly light mouthfeel for a stout, but it's a pretty good beer that i'd love to try again.","Prufrock","May 24, 2006"
3.8,16.9,4.5,4.5,3,4.5,4,"Mouth: Didn't quite live up to my expectations: a bit plastic tasting and sour, but not in a horrible way. The chocolate is extremely strong and delicious with a very unique after taste, like burnt chocolate. The flavor is a bit too sour and has some processed candy like qualities that aren't too favorable. My girlfriend screamed ""That's the worst beer I've ever tasted!!""... but I disagree. It's not great tasting, but has some interesting flavors that I liked. Thorough carbonation as well.","clickpush","May 08, 2006"
2.28,-29.8,2,1.5,3,2,2,"Probably not a beer I will have again. If this were put in front of me blind and someone told me it was a bock, I'd think it was an average effort for a brew-pub or homebrew bock. As a stout, it fails on so many levels. As a R.I.S., it's not even close.","czechsaaz","Feb 20, 2006"
3.09,-4.9,2,3,3.5,2.5,3,"It's drinkable. Definitely good as an after dinner dessert alternative. I was having Ethiopian food, which I assume the Hakim was made to accompany. It does a decent job of it. Overall though, this is not one of my favorites of the style.","JayTheFinn","Feb 05, 2006"

3.17,-2.5,3,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Translucent dark brown, small quickly dissipating head. Smell is suitably roasted malts, some toffee. The flavors are not nearly as forceful. The malts are very subdued, still present, but not strong enough to have a lasting impact. The body is lighter than a feather for this style. Carbonation approaches soda levels. It's drinkable. An interesting sample from Ethiopia. Thanks to goschool for this via Boxing Day BIF 05.","pentathlete","Sep 21, 2005"
3.36,3.4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This one pours dark red to brown with a large tan head that leaves just a smidge of lacing. The nose is chocolaty and fruity with sherry aromas. Roasted malts and chocolate get a rude visit from overly-sweet lactose. This lactose flavor works better in more robust stouts. Think Samuel Smith's Nut Brown meets Mackeson XXX. As this beer warms up the lactose taste goes away. It's a shame how much this beer's rating has suffered from it being miss-categorized as an RIS. This is a below average robust stout, but it's a nice brown porter.","goschool","May 13, 2005"
2.63,-19.1,3.5,3,2.5,2,2.5,"Picked this up at an ethiopian market. I was hesitant because the owner reccomended some beers and this was not one of his suggestions. I picked it up anyway for the sake of my fellow beer advocates. The low alcohol content had me wary with this long journey to the west coast. Had a nice carbonation phssst when I popped the cap and it poured nicely into a gobblet forming a solid one finger head. The froth was odd for an imperial in that it was off white at best and fell to an island with no lacing. Lots of dark fruity smell and huge chocolate presence that dominated throughout. I'm ranking this as an imperial but it seems more suited for a stout category. This has to have the worst mouthfeel of any imperial I've had. Watered down, nothing creamy, oily or anything other than a watered down chocolate and some burnt flavors but no zing. If there was such a thing as a ""light stout"" this would be it. Nothing offensive just doesnt produce the ""imperial"" status.","DogFood11","Apr 05, 2005"

3.45,6.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"It runs a little smokey, and pleasantly bittersweet. A little fruity, a bit of grass comes through. This is thin, but very drinkable. Exceedingly delicious with Ethiopian foods. Doesn't overpower any of the delicately spiced legumes, but stands up to the chiles, and the wonderful collard greens. Yeah, it's kinda thin, and not very complicated, but it sure goes down easily. It's totally enjoyable with the meal.","gbontrag","Beers"
3.42,5.2,3,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Seems a little light in colour for an imperial stout. Poured more brownish/orange than dark. Small foam head on top. Whisps of lace on the glass. Smelled very sweet. Not cloyingly sweet, legitimate sweet. Malts, dark fruits like raisins and plums, coffee and chocolate beans. Heavy coffee taste and raisin taste. Sort of bittersweet. The malt and raisins add a sweet taste, while the coffee makes it bitter. Pretty good, actually. Flows down the throat nice and smoothly. An above par beer, and a good imperial stout.","slitherySOB","0"
4,23.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark reddish brown color with a decent off-white head. Roasted coffee and raisin aroma. Full bodied coffee taste with raisins and spicy flavors that lingered on the tongue.

First off, this beer has more in common with a Belgian Brown or a Double Bock than a stout, but I assume the word ""stout"" has come to encompass all darker than average beers in the former colonies. This is quite simply an exceptional beer. It has an excellent mouthfeel and whatever kind of exotic spices are put into this are very noticable, but not in an overbearing way. Has notes of roasted coffee and plums. The bottle with the funky label is also a plus for the collectors in the house.","ChrisBowers","Jul 18, 2003"
