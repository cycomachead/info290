4.09,3.8,4,3.75,4.25,4.5,4,"Black with thick brown foam. Chocolaty and vanilla on the nose but more sweet vanilla bean than anything. Also smells of cool co2 and steel. Starts off mellow. Not as sweet as expected. A very mild chocolate cocoa starts and and a cocoa bittering follows up quickly with some complexity. Very much like milk chocolate followed by dark chocolate. A sweeter vanilla finishes long with a subtle wood and nutmeg note. Superbly balanced which makes it a great beer for the long haul.","constantine_272","Feb 06, 2015"

Very nicely done and impressive for a 7% beer. The feel could use a bit of beefing up perhaps, but the rest of the show is a treat. Glad this one showed up locally and if I see it again, I’ll be all over it. Highly recommended.","Jeffo","Oct 06, 2014"

Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, floral, light pine, light rye, and floral/roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with a fair amount of hop presence; and great strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, light char, coffee, toast, dark bread, light rye, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount or roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, light char, coffee, toast, dark bread, light rye, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors with a fair amount of hop balance; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent foreign stout. All around great balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors with a fair amount of hop presence; and very smooth to drink.

The licorice comes through on the mid palate. Not as roasty as I was expecting, but not surprising given the style.

Some lacing on the glass - not a lot. Smell had a nice roasted barley smell to it, with just a hint of pine tingling my nose. The taste was excellent. It really had an enjoyable flavor of burnt espresso, but with a hint of bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel was moderate but not overly thick; it was on the smooth side.

4.05,2.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is chalky and thick, dry. Good beer.","snaotheus","Sep 10, 2010"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Two fingers light brown head, slow dissipation with significant lacing. Dark as night might as well be black body, absolutely opaque, no visible carbonation. Coffee and chocolate dominate the nose in that order, a bit of floral and grassy hops for balance. Coffeeish taste, a bit on the sweet side, almost winey, not a lot of chocolate, very little bitterness on back end, more floral. Full mouthfeel, sweet but not sticky, good effervescence. A bit heavy to be sessionable, but I can certainly see what the fuss is all about with this multiple GABF Golf Medal Winner, though I would have liked a bit more chocolate to balance out the sweetish coffee profile. Edit-the label shows ABV as 7% not, 6.8.","jdense","Aug 23, 2010"
4.27,8.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a pilsner beer glass. Nice three finger head that slowly slid down the side after each sip. The smell was of unsweetened chocolate and the taste was as smooth as Micheal Jordan's head with Brylcream. The mouthfeel was so pleasant I didn't want to swallow. Perfect carbonation. I would pass up many stores to obtain another.","RedBiddy","Aug 13, 2010"

4.15,5.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Split a bomber with friends. Nothing surprising about the appearance, big and black with a tan head. I really enjoyed this stout because it wasn't the usual thick, chewy stout. Instead it was a touch lighter, like an export stout should be, with two dominant characteristics: dry roasted black malts and sweet cocoa chocolate. Heck of a beer, checkthis out.","tempest","Apr 25, 2010"
3.88,-1.5,3.5,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall: I really enjoyed Black Bear XX. It's very dark and appealing and the taste is wonderful! Best aspect of this beer is the mouth feel. It's incredibly smooth and goes down as such. If you're ever in Portland, this is a must have beer!","PurpleCloud","Apr 13, 2010"
3.8,-3.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"D - Overall a pretty well balanced beer, but lacked just a little something special in the flavor profile. Solid, but not outstanding.","blackc5","Apr 08, 2010"

4.27,8.4,3.5,4,4,5,5,"MF/D: I love the mouth feel of this stout. The texture and carbonation are spot on. The body has a rich fullness to it and feels slick on the tongue. Moderate carbonation makes it very drinkable.","SRossman","Aug 04, 2009"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a chalice a dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice chocolate/toffee notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with lots of dark stuff. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, my first from this brewery, thanks Brian.","Wasatch","Jun 03, 2009"
3.98,1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"drinkability is good. well balanced. in some ways it seems more like a baltic porter than a stout, but a bit of sourness isn't uncommon in a FES, and the body is a bit big for a BP.","grub","May 15, 2009"
3.68,-6.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a pretty opaque black, some dark reddish highlights but almost impossible to see through, very thick light brown head forms, slowly drops to a thick layer and ring leaving a ton of lace chunks stuck to the glass. Smell is nice, lightly lactic, lots of caramel, chocolate milk, very roasty, quite fruity, some vanilla, light orange peel, cherries, some coffee, pretty neat. Taste is similar, some lactic sourness, milky, chocolate, very roasty, some vanilla, fruity, more chocolate milk, pretty interesting stuff, lightly toasty, oaky in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, pretty silky and smooth, some acidic roasty character. Pretty cool stuff! Thanks Russ!","Viggo","May 15, 2009"
3.61,-8.4,3.5,2.5,4,4,4,"Pours a jet black with creamy tan head that takes a little while to dissipate. Once the head dissipates it leaves nothing but a tan ring around the glass. The aroma is faint coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malts. The taste is watery upfront that develops into a chocolate bitterness that lingers for awhile. Its a fairly medium-bodied beer that has plenty of carbonation. Its a very drinkable stout in general but just not something I would continually reach for with plenty of other options available.","DiabolikDUB","May 13, 2009"
3.92,-0.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"D- Pretty drinkable. Goes down smooth, and other then the drying effect this has it isn't too bad.","Wetpaperbag","May 11, 2009"
3.87,-1.8,3.5,4,4,3,4,"D: I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this despite a couple of complaints. This is an example of a solid stout, and at 6.8%, a very drinkable one.","Arbitrator","Apr 14, 2009"
4.16,5.6,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,"- Super-good drinkability.. tastes so light and sessionable... but yet hides any strength it may posses. A good regular staple stout for anyone who loves a winner.","Docer","Apr 13, 2009"
3.76,-4.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"D: easily drinkable, I know that I will drink this one again, I am just having a hard time getting over the fruity sour-like characteristics. Not as if they are overpowering, but they are teasing this beer from being a awesome stout.","Magpie14","Dec 08, 2008"

2.96,-24.9,4.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"So far, Alameda Brewhouse has failed to impress me. Black Bear XX is a classic example of how addition by subtraction would result in a much better beer. Subtracting the sourness would add immeasurably to both flavor and drinkability. Too bad I'll probably never get to try it again to put that theory to the test.","BuckeyeNation","Oct 30, 2008"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Alameda makes a good foreign-style stout that I wouldn't hesitate to drink again. Black Bear XX is a robust stout with moderate enough alcohol to drink a few at a time. It's too bad this isn't available in my area. Thanks for the great extra Brian!","joe1510","Aug 27, 2008"
4.2,6.6,4,4,4,4,5,"A solid very black stout with huge tan head and a nice roasty nose. This is a drinking stout that has all the chocolate and roasted malt flavours but no sharp edges. Not the biggest stout on the block but very well put together and oh so drinkable. Worth buying","canucklehead","Aug 27, 2008"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Bomber bought from Capital Market, Salem . Gorgeous looking beer. black with dark,dark brown hints around the edges, good lookingbrown head. slightly roasty aromas, not too strong, some dark chocolate, slight fruit. Quite semi-sweet bitter, burnt toast towards the end, bitter black coffee finish mixed with treacle. Slight alcohol hint in the belly.Good stuff. Nicel on the palte, not as heavy as expected and thats a good thing as it adds a point or two for drinkability. Over all nice beer","Reidrover","Jul 20, 2008"
4.6,16.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Served on nitro at the brewpub. An unbeleivably smooth stout with dry character, lots of roastiness, and a slightly bitter finish.

4.47,13.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from the 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Body is a deep rich black hue topped by an inch of thick, creamy tan head. Beautiful aroma of sweet, rich roasted malt, with notes of vanilla and milk chocolate. Palate is rich and sweet - tons of rich roasted dark and chocolate malt, with notes of vanilla, mocha, milk chocolate, and a very mild hop bitterness. Finish is smooth and well-balanced between the rich malt and the subtle hop profile. Body is thick, smooth, and creamy, just wonderful. Goes down very easily for a strong stout. I'm a big fan.","ElGordo","Apr 02, 2007"
2.59,-34.3,4.5,3,2,4,2,"I didn't really care for the taste of this one, and by the end of the 2nd snifter from the bottle, I was pretty sick of it. It wasn't that heavy though though so if it's your thing, it's probably pretty drinkable. Just a bit to sweet for me. I'm compelled to try this on nitro at the brewery now that I live here, although I can't say I'm in a big hurry to do so. Hopefully it'll be more enjoyable and I'll re-review. Same goes for the bottle I'm cellaring.","ccrida","Mar 30, 2007"

3.53,-10.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to cmaruschak for sharing. Deep dark brown color with a reddish halo and a thick light tan head that dissipates steadily. Roasty aroma of coffee and malt. Medium-bodied and smooth with a rather sharp bitterness around the edges. The nitro smoothness seems to contradict the somewhat harsh acidity in the flavor. Malt and coffee flavors keep it from falling apart luckily. The finish is creamy with a bitter aftertaste. I would not go as far as to say the bottle had turned but something seemed a little off about this.","Dogbrick","Oct 04, 2006"
4.03,2.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours like motor oil with a four finger tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Totally black color. Light carbonation and very heavy bodied. Chocolate nose. Starts with a bitter chocolate flavor, some middle sweetness, finish has a slight bitterness. A decent stout. $3.25 for a 22oz bottle from John's Grocery Tigard, Or.
