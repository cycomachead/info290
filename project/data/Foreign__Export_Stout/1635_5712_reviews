"O: WINNER!!"
""
"o - overall a very nice foreign export stout, reminds me a bit of short's uncle steve's irish stout, but better. very good take on the style from a local brewery. would be more than happy to have this again. worthy."
"o - Overall I was very pleasantly surprised with this one; I thought it was a great sweet stout. The nose is great and it is very easy to drink. I'd love to have this one again and look forward to trying mroe of their beers."
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the aroma. It was rich and bold, boasting of big roasted malts, and huge coffee elements. These elements, however, were blended perfectly with a cooling vanilla, leading to a complex and mouthwatering aroma that fit this style perfectly. Where the beer lost points however, was in the mouthfeel. We were expecting something rich, bold, and full bodied, but instead were met with a rather thin and watery brew."
"O – A delicious brew on cask, just a touch too light on the body."
"Into the tulip the blackness tumbles further down the rabbit hole. A black hole of despair and neglect. But this glass? I shall neglect not. I raise it to the light..Impenetrable! I smell, the roast, the coffee, a faintness of hop..of hope. Big creamy tan head, the bubbles fine. The flavor is nice, the creaminess of the stout is cut with the bitterness and roasted barley. A little coffee rounds out an excellent stout flavor. Full-bodied, very creamy despite the sharp notes of bitterness from hop and husk. An extremely solid brew from the local cats.."
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink for the style because it isn’t very heavy on the palate."
"O: an excellent stout; very glad I stumbled upon this one. Pretty straightforward, but who says that's a bad thing?"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, bitter, and chewy with some tobacco and roast."
"D - Very good brew and very drinkable. Would definitely like to have one again."
"D: Smoke is the main thing here, but unlike lesser versions of the style, it doesn't get overwhelming and disgusting. It perhaps could have benefited from a nicer complement of secondary flavors, but it was pleasant enough."
"A massive stout. This one is not screwing around. Like Guinness Foreign Extra on roids. Could use a /bit/ of restraint, I think, but shows off American boisterousness well."
"Tastes strong hoppiness with supporting malt sweet. Malt sweet is cut a bit short due to an alcohol sting upon the swallow. Hop flavor is grassy with blackberry and anise. Malt is tame roast and dry cocoa. Cherry ester in the finish and ashy aftertaste. Much too hoppy for the style, but still a nice beer. Thick in the mouth, but doesn't cling on the tongue, due to the alcohol. Medium carbonation and decent drinkability."
"D- This has been my favorite offering from CBC. I wouldn't normally pick a stout for a hot humid NYC summers day/night, but my wife was in the mood...I'm glad she was. this is a unique stout that stands out to me with the sour-ish/barrel-ish notes to it."
"this beer pours a very black color hard to even get highlights when backlit, the dark tan head fades to a nice sheet of lace. the aroma is nicely toasted with the 8.0 abv not really making much of a showing. the taste has a good malty backbone with a dry finish. the full body and, well, all the malt makes this my favorite chelsea beer."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with an awesome brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice dry, roasted scent that boasts of chocolate and patent malts. There is also a bit of sweetness to the aroma. The taste is great! It has quite a black/roasted malt flavor that goes down incredibly smooth and finishes with an earthy bitterness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed stout with loads of roasted character."
"Drinkability? It sure goes down easy and is tasty as hell. What a wonderful Foreign/Export Stout! You guys in NYC have it made!! Oh and head retention is good and there's some nice lacing. Thanks again go out to Nutbrown!"
"D- pretty easy drinking. I would like to try this on tap vs. cask. I feel like a lot of the flavor was lost from the gravity cask"
"Notes from: 9/17/05"
"D - Nice job on this solid stout that is pretty complex and tasty. Congrats to Chelsea on the Bronze medal at the 2008 GABF!"
"Overall, this was more than a solid brew. However, not my favorite offering from Chelsea and they've proven they can do better (damn my expectations). Definitely worth checking out if readily available."
"Would like to do the whole formal description but this deserves the ultimate resepect, simple appreciation without over analysis. Top 3 best stouts I have ever, yes EVER had."
"Overall a nice sipper."
"Also had this gem at the recent Manhattan Cask Fest (thanks Alex), and it was even smoother and tastier."
"Pours a matte black color with a nice tan head that is very thick...easily one of the best heads I have ever seen. It smells heavily of coffee, caramel, and burnt/ roasted malt. The taste is of very dark chocolate, dark fruits, roasted coffee beans, and caramel again. It has a nice hoppiness to it that greatly distinguishes it from the other export stouts. It is super silky in the mouth. Delicious beer."
"Drinkability: this was a nice hearty stout after spending a cold day in NYC. This one is worth having when it is on tap."
"D: Very drinkable but the alcohol will eventually get to you."
"Overall a delicious and perfectly crafted stout. Not as rigid as most exports."
"Looks jet black with a nice tan head and some lacing as I drink. The aroma was of a simple stout, just some dark roasted grains, but the flavor opened up to a lot more with sweet chocolate, a bitter, roasted grains element that stayed with you (in a good way). As it warmed some citrus hops came in ala Shakespeare Stout. All in all, this was a very drinkable and tasty stout. Definitely worth trying in NYC."
"Drinkability: A little sweet, but nice."
"On draft at Barcade. Foreign export stout (a style whose definition I can never fully grasp) was deep black in color with a nice frothy head. Coffee and dark chocolate is very evident in the aroma and in the first sip. Roasted malts and bitter chocolate and hops come through in the second wave of flavor. Goes down dangerously easy for the ABV in a pint. Tasty. I wish they brewed this one a bit more often."
"Cheers to a local brewery for a great beer!"
"Drinkability: Its a well-rounded big stout. Excellent with a desert or just as a nice evening wintertime snack. Although its not the greatest stout, theres something unique about that I enjoyed. Maybe someday it will come to me and Ill be able to point to what made it different. Definitely worth a try."
"On-Cask at Copperfields. A dark, nearly opaque black colour with a small off-white head that did not last long. the aromas were of roasted malts, chocolate, a bit of coffee, some vanilla, a bit of oak and more. The taste was very roasty up front but very sweet and chocolate-like in the finish. Although this was not a very hoppy stout, the small hop flavors that were there complemented the other flavors in this beer quite well. The mouthfeel was a bit thin for the style but the drinkability was very, very good. I want some more beers from Chelsea. Now please."
"Overally, I think this beer is very drinkable. Like all of Chelsea's beers, this beer is super-clean, very attenuated, and has lots of flavor hops. A slice of California in NYC."
"Taste is fantastic. Leaves your tongue swimming. Very drinkable for a stout."
"An appropriate name for this brew, it pours the darkest shade of indigo with a toffey head and noticeable lacing throughout the sipping experience. Roasted malty aroma with a fruity plum taste. An unmistakable and pleasurable sweetness. Not overpowering sweetness, but truly enjoyable as the brew warms and releases it true taste. I plan to finish the growler this evening with a turkey hoagie and a nice cigar."
"Very yummy, sip this one and let it warm up a bit."
