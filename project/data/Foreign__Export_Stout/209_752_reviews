"I would say I prefer ""classic"" Guiness from Ireland, but this one is also good and reminds me the true one. Crafted is from far better!"

"- more bitter and hoppy than the normal Guinness but not as good in my personal opinion"
""
""
""
"Picture a guiness. Light body. Smooth finish. This beer is not that. It is a hoppy version. With different malt. And an unpleasant boozy afterbreath."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a world class beer using an old Irish recipe which has the wort/mash exposed to wild yeasts.  This along with the use of high quality barley malts and enough hopping to please an American palate makes this beer a surprise find from the Guinness Brewery which is owned by the Diageo Group (read Smirnoff).  The beer is made to transport and because of this cellars very well and even bottle conditions which producing a great Irish stout."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Far more complex malt character than the standard version. The alcohol is slightly fusel, but the dark fruit detracts."
"A really good stout, of the mass produced, probably one of the best."
""
"Overall,  pretty good beer and well worth drinking if you can find it. This is one of the beers that started me on the path to beer geekdom (before I joined beeradvocate) and is still pretty good after having so money different beers."
""
"Overall - As a huge Guinness fan, I'd rank this #1 of the 3 I've had in the portfolio. #2 would be (the ubiquitous) Guinness Draught and #3 The (original/regular) Extra Stout"
""
"Aroma of Dark Cherry, Chocolate, Coffee, Cocoa, Barley Malts and Cream. What Guinness should taste like. Very fruity and leaves your tastebuds dancing. The best from the guinness range in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Makes a great black and tan with the local Piton lager too."
""
""
""
""
"Exceptional, the best mass produced stout in the world in my opinion"
""
""
""
""
"A truly excellent brew. ""Chewy"" as as GREAT stout should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite of the Guinness lineup. This is strong and full of flavor, barring almost no resemblance to the Guinness most of us know and love."
""
"V - So worth it. You'll notice that there is Guinness Extra Stout and Guinness *Foreign* Extra Stout, these both typically run at the same price, but wow is the foreign variant so much better, it's flavors and aromas are much deeper and complex and quite frankly if you're paying the same amount any way, then it is entirely a good value."

"Alcohol really well hidden, smooth and creamy head and very drinkable....not really a beer with deepness, just a good stout."

"Whoa. This is really, really good. Better than the usual extra stout. It's rich and earthy and chocolatey. It smells so fantastic. I'm gonna need more of these."
"I enjoy a Guinness Draft well enough, but given a choice I'd take this Extra Stout any day. The aroma is bold and complex; and the flavor, while not quite as expressive, is still satisfyingly rich with roasted malt in the lead, sweetness in support, and a punctuating bitterness that stops shy of astringent."

"O- This is a very good stout that is full in flavour and mouthfeel. I am really enjoying the subtle but still hard to miss chocolate covered cherries here. Very glad this is quite easy to find on the shelves around here, even if the price is a little bit more than I'd expect."

"330 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/29/2012. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, molasses, light char, raisin, plum, herbal, floral, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of dark/roasted malt and moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, molasses, light char, raisin, herbal, floral, light pine, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, molasses, herbal, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and earthy hops; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, smooth, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent foreign stout. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roast malt and earthy hops flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out as dark and black as a beer can get. A big pillowy tan head (2+ fingers) lasts througout the beer and leaves volumes of sticky lacing. The aroma is very deep roasted malt, nothing really complex but enjoyable in its simplicity. The taste has a little more depth, with some hints of coffee and some pleasant alcohol esters. It's a little thinner in the style of an Irish Dry Stout but has a pleasant feeling on the palate. A great full-flavored stout that packs a punch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a style defining ale and true to its core as the flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are really larger versions of the Draught version."
""
"Hey man, Guinness makes a hell of an Export Stout. I can’t believe this is my first go-around. I will probably have to nab this from time-to-time to satiate my desire for a good stout, which this is."
""
"T&M - Again, what I always wished Guinness Stout was. It's like an upgrade. Very much like the smell, the chocolate is the first sensation I get followed by coffee once swallowed. A bit sweet from the malts and alcohol but a nice hop bitterness lingers above the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not quite sure how to describe this beer. It's like Guinness bet yet very different. The flavor is similar to your standard Guinness Stout minus the typical chocolate malt flavor. Instead you get a bit more hops. It's actually rather pleasant and unexpected. Also, the alcohol content is quite a bit higher compared to Guinness. I had no idea, until I started to get rather buzzed after 1 beer, then I read the label and noticed the higher alcohol content."
""
"Pours a dark brown with a thin foamy head. It doesn't stay for long, and there's little lacing on the glass. Smells of chocolate, malt and bread. Big taste of coffee, chocolate, dark fruit and licorice. A bit of bitterness. Medium mouth with some oil. Just a nice solid stout."
""
"This is quite good, certainly better than the standard Guinness ""draught."" Not quite on par with the better American stouts, and the sourness is a little off-putting."

"Overall: Great beer for this cold Boston weather. Too bad it only comes in 4 packs. They should expand to 6 packs."
"o: this is a bigger version of guinness stout. however it is easy to drink and goes well in colder months or a night capper with a creme brulee or sweet dessert. very enjoyable."

""

""

""

"This is the gold standard of stouts.  (Not to be confused with the other Guinness Extra Stout--this is the real deal.)  To be sipped and savored, it's simply delicious.  Best enjoyed by itself or maybe with some salted nuts, because you won't want anything to get in the way of the awesome taste."

"This is a great beer. I think it would be better if it had a little more coffee/chocolate taste. It's too heavy to drink in the summer. It's definitely a winter beer, and even then I couldn't drink many, but I'll enjoy each one."

""
""
""

"Overall- Just above average- I definitely prefer the ease and accessibility of regular Guinness. However, if you like bold, bitter-sweet beers, you might just enjoy it. This will not be a repurchase."

""
""
"The Foreign Extra Stout poured a deep opaque black with a full tan head with great retention. The aroma was surprisingly weaker than expected from such a foreboding brew but was reminiscent of a regular Guinness. The Foreign Extra Stout takes those signature Guinness flavors and turns them up to 11. There are hints of chocolate, sweet malts, and a slight char that leaves a nice bitterness on the palate. It has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel that is heavier than the regular Guinness, but still lighter than expected. The Foreign Extra Stout is the epitome of Guinness and so good."

"DATE TASTED: August 1, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Guinness pint... OCCASION: watching scrapbooking with Shan--sweet memories... APPEARANCE: velvet black body, dense and appreciable; thick brown head that laces beautifully, as a doily,, almost symmetrically around the glass... AROMA: nice lactic impact; hops are less profiled--oat, peat and sugars are prominent... PALATE: high and hard, warming and medium-bodied; full at the throat...TASTE: slightly chocolaty and pleasantly milky; unlike the draught, a hardened smoky finish that demands attention; hops are well-placed, coupling with the malts to present a substantial, complex stout... OVERALL: the less-requested Guinness again reminds me why the road less traveled in beer circles often makes the more rewarding difference...this beer delivers with a welcome heft and an ABV that belies its enjoyable sip. A shame this beer does not accompany the ""three beers strong"" mix pack--trade the Harp for this? In a heartbeat..."
""
"This Foreign Extra brought me back to when I first enjoyed a dark brew which was Schlizt Dark Draught. I have loved dark brews ever since that time. This Extra has a good character and was balanced well. Very less heavy than regular Guinness draught. Can not mention anything about lacing as I just enjoyed it in the bottle. I had this brew in Shenzhen China and will try to get a local pub to get it here in FL. I really like this Guinness Foreign Extra!"

"I've had Guinness on 5 continents and this is one of the best; even if the Best Before date was a year ago!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent stout, but I would much rather go for the Sam Smith's equivalent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - in my opinion, this is much better than the run-of-the-mill Guinness Draught you get around these parts. I've never been to Ireland, so I can't comment on how this differs from getting it local. Excellent stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's been said before, but I'm going to say it again. This is the pride of the Guinness line. This is leagues ahead of the Guinness Stout that's on tap in most commercial bars. This beer is a wonderful treat that I'd go for time after time."
""
""
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Unlike traditional Guinness this beer is strong with lots of flavor. While not as well balanced as Guinness lager this is a truly a strong and flavorful beer. Immensely popular in many parts of the world, this dark strong beer is still drank year round, often only marginally cold."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark, almost black body with a thick (one-inch) foamy light brown head, which eventually gives way to leave enormous chunks of foam on the glass. Smell is largely chocolate with a touch of roasted grain. The taste is bitter chocolate, with sour notes and a dry finish that leaves a touch of bitterness behind. The feel is remarkably light, with a medium, tangy carbonation."
""
"The aftertaste is a welcome bitter chocolate that lingers for many minutes after consumption."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really nice straight up stout. These days it seems like everyone is adding something to a stout or aging it in a barrel. Every now an then you need to be reminded of what the style should fundamentally be and I think Guinness hit it with this beer. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O - a go to beer for all the stout lovers and that includes me."
""
""
""
""
"An interesting export stout, surprising level of herbal spicy bitterness. A lot of rich alcohol soaked coffee and herbal spice character, all balanced quite well. Interesting complexity and good feel, yet I would hesitate to drink this on a regular basis, a bit herbal-booze forward though balanced with a nice dry fruity finish. A very good beer, but not my favourite style of stout."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is an outstanding brew that is almost nothing like the Guinness nitro stuff that can be found at every bar and grocery store in town. This is a big chewy brew to be sipped, not swilled. A nice companion to the eminently sessionable ""regular"" Guinness."
""
"O: It's been at least a few years since I've had this, having had a good number of fine stouts from around the world in the meantime. I was pleasantly surprised: this certainly exceeded my expectations. Surprisingly satisfying and flavorful given the standard/common Guinness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark black with a super creamy brown head. Aromas of roasted coffee. Taste begins with a bit of molassas, then some pumpernickle bread, then some smooth chocolate and earthy bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little light. Overall a very nice beer. Easily the best offering Guinness has."
""
""
"An interesting beer, though I guess I was expecting a bit more from it. Frankly, given a choice, I think I prefer the lower alcohol draft version of this beer. Nevertheless, I'm glad I had a chance to try it."
"Overall I enjoyed it a lot and will probably be buying a 6 pack soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A classic Irish Stout with wonderful dark characteristics and smoothness. Happy to take this brew in on St. Patrick's. Hope everyone is staying safe out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With a much more bold flavor than Guinness Extra and the smoothness of Guinness Draught, this is the beer-lover's Guinness."

"If only it were easier to get in Aus."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, developed a tan head which lasted well beyond, as would be expected from Guinness, and laced exceptionally. Appearance was black, of Guinness. Aroma was strong of coffee and malt and hop. Perhaps a hint of chocolate. Taste was coffee and dry hop. Mouthfeel was full and a bit carbonated. Aftertaste was super dry."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great stout. The best beer that Guinness makes, and one of my favorite stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"4.21/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
"O -Overall, Guinness simply does not brew great beers in my opinion. It wasn't bad, bit it definitely wasn't sepctacular. Stout? WHERE?!"
""
"Outstanding...feel like I should have been drinking this for years. Time to play catch up...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-good not great. With all the other offering around at this price point you can usually do better, but you could also do much worse. 3.75"
"I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much with this one, but I'm very pleasantly surprised as it's rapidly risen of the ranks of my favorite beers. Not really a session beer, as it's quite complex and demands you attention, but perfect now and again, either on it's own (perhaps a third beer to wake up a numbing tongue), or with a heavy, meaty dish (including jerky). Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, I must admit that I was not expecting this. There is a dark chocolaty flow into my glass with a lovely whipped mocha head. The flavor is of hint of a stale dark roast and a yummy tobacco. I feel that my mouth i content while it goes away pretty quickly leaving a weird feeling that make you want to take another sip asap. This is worth it weight in gold, or atleast coffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall though, I am astonished at how good this is for a commercial offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing, just absolutely amazing."
""
"poured a jet black untranslucent liquid, 2 fingers dense white foam, medium persistance, nice lacing, nose of chocolate and coffee, bit sweet, not too overwhelming, palate same as nose, called my attention the dark chocolate flavor and the dry and mildly bitter finish to round it up, full body nice carbonation, nice stout, strong and dry, toasted flavors blend in nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More drinkable than I had expected. The roasted flavor isn't overpowering and the alcohol is not very apparent."
""
""
"O: Pretty damn good, and shocked this comes from Guinness. Highly drinkable and by far the best product I've had from them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - By far the finest 'version' of Guinness stout. Smooth, full flavor, great appearance, the finest that Guinness has to offer, highly recommend."
"O: an excellent export stout if you love the dry burnt quality of Guinness"
""
"I've been looking for this for a while, it finally showed up. Anyways poured from a 33cl bottle into a Guinness mug, coded bottle date. Pours a pitch black beautiful color with a massive three fourths the mug mocha colored head which is slowly receding to the body below, after a while this leaves a two finger thick head with a lacing. The smells are of dark roasted malts, the guinness burnt smells, a little hops. The feel is somewhere between medium to thick and creamy very nice. The taste is outstanding, plenty of dark roasted malts combined with a noticeable hop bite and a little alcohol burn, this is pretty great, better than the original."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Ok...THIS is what Guinness should be. Their best product by far, and a million times better than the ""pub draft"" crap that most people associate with the brand. So good it made me want to go to the fridge and get another bottle right away. Could be the best example of ""just"" a ""regular"" stout....and it's ""just"" splendid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Whoa. This is probably what all stouts should aspire to be."
"I'm amazed by this beer, loving it and can't wait to crack another."
""
""
"Overall- This is the best Guinness that I have had out of a bottle. Not as good as a Guinness draught on nitro-tap but pretty close."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Say what you want about them, but Guinness really does make a nice product - both tasty and accessible. This is probably the best brew in their line-up, and at 7.5% ABV, it's definitely their strongest. Be careful, or this one will sneak up on you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a really nice variation on the Guinness brand. The hoppy bitterness was a nice addition the usual Guinness palate that I'm used to."
""
""
"Overall - Really nice beer. Far superior to regular guinness. Has alot of flavor, balance and easy to enjoy. This is awhole different beer then guinness draught but still has the flavor and feel. Nice, glad it came to the states, worth a try."
""
""
""
" as far as guiness beers go, this is really the only one you should be drinking. It's a damn near perfect stout, and yes I feel weird typing this, but I can't help it, it really is that good.  As ridiculous as it sounds it feels as if they paid a smaller brewer to make this for them and stick their name on it - it IS that hard to believe that they made something this good."
""
""
"This brew is a bit more flavorful and intense than its ""normal"" version, and it boasts a higher ABV % as well. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout is a nice big beer, which should definitely be savored."
""
"Overall – The taste and feel start out great, but that off bitter-herbal-roasted flavor that is left on the tongue really bring the brew down."
""
""
""
""
"Bought a bottle from Total Wine in DE. Poured into a classic Guiness glass. Looks black with very nice carbonation and mountainous head that sticks around forever. Foam clings to side of glass. Smells bittersweet as in the label description with roasty notes and hints of candied fig. Some caramel & molasses notes. Tastes very dry with bittersweet notes and candied figs, dark fruit, and some molasses. Alcohol seems well hidden. I love the texture - seems light because of the dryness but feels about medium to full. Overall, a nice variation of the standard Guiness product. Glad to have seen this one arrive in the US. Just pissed I didn't try this one sooner"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" than a draught, which I quite enjoy. Shoots to the top of my stout list."
""
""
"O - Very nice beer for anyone who enjoys the regular Guinness but wants to try something on a whole new level. This beer is a great Stout that everyone should give a try at least once. A proper beer for a beer enthusiast. Cheers!"
""
""
"O: Guinness was what I drank whenI was unfamiliar with craft beer, but wanted to seem more sophisticated than everyone else who was drinking Bud; turns out regular Guinness is not that great a beer. Fortunately, there is the Foreign Export/Stout version(s), and it is a face-saver for the most well-known brewery in Dublin. While there are plenty of better stouts, the Guinness Foreign Extra is a good Irish dry stout. If you like craft beer and you've had the (regular) version of the beer, then you must seek this out and have one. It's an important representative in the House of Stouts, and a good beer to be familiar with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dry finish. The finishes with some acrid notes and a spicy noble bitterness that lingers along with that dark caramel note. This example seems to set the bar for foreign extra stout."
""
""
""
"overall, i love this stuff. i keep a couple in the frig for whenever i get tired of the same ole, same ole. not for every night. not for anytime. but every once in a while, these are the prescription for what ails ya. maybe try a back of some good whiskey for a great evening home alone . . . . sorry, i'm a loner.... cant give it all 5's - is there anything in the world which really is? (except for freely given, passionate oral gratitude) but this is one of my tops. salud!"
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"This is one of the best stouts I've ever had. It blows Guinness Extra Stout out of the water. This is going to become a regular in my fridge for sure."
""
""
""
""

"O: I'm pretty much blown away because I didn't think this was going to be this good. This is quite impressive, however, I still feel as each new style presents itself to me that I need to have others just so I can compare."

"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a nice dark brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with light sweet notes is pretty good. Taste is a nice mix between some solid roasted malt with dry notes and some light sweet undertones. Body has somewhat of a creamy texture with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. This is definitely a step-up from the regular Guinness."
""
"This is, without question, one of the best beers I’ve ever had. The only part about it that was less than fantastic was the bottle was only 11.2 oz. It pours a deep dark, opaque brown, nearly black. Smells roasty, almost, but not quite like coffee. It’s hoppy, and strong, smooth on the tongue. I can’t say enough. This is truly a special beer."
""
"O- This is pretty good, much better then the watery stuff we get here in the US. I also dont think my bottle was that fresh so I was somewhat optimistic in my rating."

"The body is a tad thin, but this is by far the best version of Guinness that is available."

"m-i found myself drinking quite slowly and savoring each sip."

"Fairly full bodied, light effervescence. Fairly smooth and creamy as well. Much, much better than ""regular"" Guinness. I would have this again willingly."

"O: Absolutely drinkable. Great beer. Recommended"
"The pour yield a jet black nearly opaque body. Its croundedxwith a whispy light tan head. There is coffee and cocao powder in the nose. The malt is definatly roasted and is pretty nice but not over bearing or bitter. The taste does have some bite between the medium carbonation and body movin into the malt. It carries a big taste without the big characteristics with makes it approachable. A solid brew and about as sessionable as the style permits."
"11.2oz bottle poured into a snifter, pours black with a frothy beige head that leaves good retention and lacing on the glass. Aromas are chocolate, nibs, roasted barley, molasses, and caramel. Tastes are molasses, roasty, sweet, dark chocolate, delicately hopped, yet has a roasty bitterness, lots of fig and date in there as well. Mouth is on the thinner side of medium, but is creamy and smooth. Overall, one of the better foreign stouts out there. Guinness needs to just brew this one, it's by far their best."

"Pours jet black with a light chocolate brown head. In the aroma, a light roast. In the taste, a small roast and a small bite. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry small roast in the aftertaste. Eh! Lack of flavor and aroma, honestly, nothing exciting at all."

"O: Interesting foreign stout, it's mostly char and dark fruits. Almost no coffee or chocolate. Fairly bitter even with a year+ on it. It's not terrible but not what I typically look for in a stout. I think I prefer regular guiness draught over this, amusingly enough."

"Overall. Alcohol was well hidden so this drank easy. A good stout, I'd drink it again."
"O- The staple of the style. complex in flavor, mouthfeel, nose, and even the appearance is perfect. this is quite a beer. I have to say I'm sold. Huge fan of this."
""
"Poured into an Irish style pint glasses. Very dark brown color. Medium sized white head. Lots of roasted notes in the nose. Taste was much more rich than the traditional Guinness. Mouthfeel was also thicker, and you could really notice the additional alcohol. Also, not as bitter as the Extra Stout available in the US. But, this seems to be less memorable than the same FES I had down in the Caribbean -- not as ""exotic""."
""
"O: So much different from the Guinness Draught that we are all accustomed to. Granted, it's a different style but it hits that style on the head. Delicious beer."
""
"Overall - Not that much different than the Guinness Extra Stout which is widely available, and at a lower price. I'd say this one's a tad smoother, but the difference is nearly negligible."

"O-I've heard of this beer and when I finally saw it I jumped at it...a bit pricey but worth trying and I like it...sweeter...almost a bit like an imperial milk stout....if you want a big west coast style Impy stout like some this is not it but it is a good beer...shit if they poured this out of the Guiness taps at all the bars I would definitely reach for it..."

"My heavy-handed pour caused me a moment of consternation as I thought that it was going to overflow the rim of the glass as it seemed to cascade. The dense, deep-tan head looked like the top of an ice cream float. Color was a deep, dark-brown with cola highlights at the edges. The nose was very chocolaty with an underlying roastiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a definite hop/roasted barley bite on the tongue. This taste, along with its relatively high ABV, was a real revelation for this self-avowed hophead. This was not a Black IPA, but instead a hoppy dry stout. Wow! Finish was very dry, almost gaspingly so and I could not wait until my next sip. Definitely worth giving a try!"

"Poured into a Guinness pint glass. Pours dark brown with a massive tan head. The head dissipates, leaving plenty of sticky lacing on the glass. The aromas of dark roasted malt and dark chocolate dominate. There's also a hint of extra sweetness in the smell. The flavor is sweeter than the classic Guinness flavor with an extra punch from the alcohol. There are flavors of dark roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and molasses. This is a bolder version of the Guinness we've all enjoyed and the flavors are still well balanced. The alcohol is not overpowering. The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Like the original, it is very drinkable. Overall, this is an excellent Irish stout and easily one of the best I've had from the style. If you like the regular Guinness, you could not go wrong trying this one."
"Favorite beers (for comparison, after all taste preferences are subjective): Elysian's Daedalus Irish Stout, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar, Allagash's White Ale, New Belgium's 1554, Full Sail's Wassail, etc. Beers I don't like: IPAs (with few exceptions)"

"Guiness Foreign Extra Stout pours a very dark brown/ not quite black color with a thick milk chocolate colored head from a brown 330 ml bottle. Dark malts are present in the aroma. Lots of dark malt in the flavor, even a hint of caramel. Definitely stronger than the original in both flavor and alcohol. Sweeter too. This bottle came from the Caribbean. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic offering. Has to be the best Irish stout I have had. Miles ahead of any other offering by Guinness, that's for sure. Definitely worth trying if you could get your hands on it."

"O: I like this beer. Typical of Guiness, a good dry stout but nothing to write home about. But this has a richer fuller flavor than Draft making it a better stout. Sometimes you are just in the mood for a Guiness, this is the one I will go to when I have that feeling."
""
""
"11.2oz bottle. Pours black with a short lived brown head and some lacing. Aroma is of roasted grain, bready malt and some chocolate. Body is full, smooth and oily. Roasted grain, chocolate malt, some dark fruit and a lot of earthy hops fill the mouth. The finish is long and bitter. I can’t say I enjoyed this brew."
""
""
" Palate is big on rich, dark, roasted malt, tempered slightly by a lactic sweetness and a very mild, fruity hop profile. Notes of mocha and bittersweet chocolate. A slight sour funk comes through on the finish, rounding out the sweetness in a surprisingly nice way. Body is rich, creamy, velvety, and just about perfect. This is like Guinness taken up a notch, and even without the nitro widget to add extra creaminess, it's thoroughly excellent."
"D: A fine example of the style, especially considering the large-scale brewing process. Commendable."
"O - A massive improvement over the draught. High drinkability with a pretty high ABV. Its a damn solid beer, nothing too complex or over the top. Just a clean and simple stout....which makes its $10/4 pack price seem a bit excessive."

I bought this beer on a whim and came home to see that it had good reviews. I wanted a good beer to drink on St. Patty's and this might make the cut."
"I was not let down with the taste, drinkabilty, smell, or what ever else. This was one that we should have had in this country long, long before. I'm sure they missed out on a lot of profit by holding this back from the U.S. They should have seen the boom in micros a long time ago and taken notice."

"Surprisingly, this is stocked at my local Wal Mart. As Advertised, Guinness Foreign extra is a more roasted and hopped up version of their excellent Extra Stout. Here, your extra $1.00 per bottle buys you a 1.5% higher ABV, some nice dark rum notes, and that fantastic dark rum truffle finish. Excellent for special occasions or when you want to savor a well crafted Irish Dry Stout."
"O - Awesome. Hard to find near me, so I'm glad I picked up some of this when I did see it. I'll recommend to anyone into stouts, and I'll definitely grab again."

"Overall: very tasty strong stout with a superb aroma. A bit more depth of roast in the flavor would be wonderful."
"Overall: This may be overwhelming for people who are not used to dark beers, or if they think Guinness is a meal in and of itself. One the other hand, if you like dark beers, give this one a try. A very tasty beer, that I will return to."
"Overall: Definitely an addition to the Guinness line up that I can stand behind. My favorite bottled Guinness thus far."
"O: fantastic! I will definitely drink this again!"
""
""
"O: What a beer that came out of left field. I never thought I'd be this impressed with a guinness but I have been proven wrong. I'd highly recommend this to anyone!"
""
""
"O: Overall a decent beer. It's quite drinkable but a little on the weak side as far as taste and mouthfeel go."
"Creamy, mild, with just enough carbonation to sweep her down your tongue, the mouth feel on this baby is near perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's not perfect, but it's genuinely impressive, especially next to regular old Guinness Draught. The thin body lets it down a tad, but this is still a really good stout that I will be on the lookout for in the future."
""
"O: Awesome stout – what every stout should strive to be. Soo smooth and tasty."
""
""
"O: This is by far Guinness' best product. This is a very satisfying product."
""
"O: This is a good stout; better than the Guinness Draught or Guinness Extra Stout. There is more malt character to balance the bitterness. Very creamy, malty, and roasted."
""
""
""
""
"Wish I could find this on-tap again. This is an awesome beer. Guinness holds a special place in my heart for getting me into the dark beers to begin with, but with that bias aside, this is real good stout. Nice subtle chocolate with a real rich maltiness. Not many beers beat the look of this one."
"This is a delicious, full-flavored stout. My favourite Guinness brew so far!"
""
""
"Overall: What a Guinness should taste like. Solid as a regular stout."

"I am finally getting around to sampling this renowned beer. I have seen it on and off on the shelves in the past, but just never picked it up each time due to various reasons. The pour was deep brown coming out of the bottle, but in the glass it looked very black. The head that formed showed the classic cascading action to grow to four or five fingers thick before settling down to a large mass crowing above the rim of the pint glass. The aroma was roasty and robust with a generous helping of coffee, brown sugar, and toffee. The taste was excellently balanced between cream, chocolate, coffee, and molasses flavors. Not as aggressive as many newer variations of the style, but very approachable as a result. A little thin in the mouthfeel, but the carbonation made it feel silky smooth. From my reading about the history of Guinness, this is probably closest to the original recipe from last century than the watered down mainstream variant sold today. People had it better back then."

"O - Very different than ""standard"" Guinness. I like it. Almost a Black IPA. I could drink more of this."
"Notes - An interesting stout but nothing special in compariosn to what else is available now. I'll admit this is a poor review I usually do that when I'm indifferent to a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is strong, even a little bitter, with flavors of burnt barley and crisp hops present, too. Not your usual Guinness, though it does retain some of the creamy body of the usual Guinness. This is a sturdy, strong, and bitter ale that's unique and well-done. I'll be revisiting in the future."
""

"Big juicy malt and dark fruit character. Lots of prune juice and fermentation stuff happening. Nice but it overpowers any dark malt roast or dryness. Disappointing really."
""
"overall I really enjoyed this beer. having had Guinness on tap and in the bottle I must say this is my fav. at 7.5 abv I would never guess it. very easyanxious to drink. I would drink this more regulary if the price was better. will definitely buy again and recommend to others."
""
"Over all I that it was ho-hum.."
""
"Overall: My kind of Guinness! Thick and chewy, with a fine high alcohol edge that doesn't overpower the complex flavors. A stout that makes you take notice and will keep you coming back."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent beer with a unique combination of sour and dark. It's like Guinness concentrate with a slug of Brett (which I believe they do use)."
""
""
""
"i'm not sure what pisses me off more: the fact that Guinness has been holding this stuff back from us for so long OR the fact that they are charging 9.99 a 4-pack of ELEVEN POINT TWO FLUID OUNCE BOTTLES!!! c'mon guys, just because it's 7.5% doesn't mean it warranted a smaller portion size and a higher pricetag. at least give us six packs of 12oz bottles for $14 or something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very very enjoyable to drink and taste. I drink the Guinness Extra Stout on a regular basis as its one of my favorite beers, but this one is an ""every once in awhile"" beer that has a little bit more bite to it. Its pricey. 8.95 for only 4 bottles, but every once in awhile its VERY well worth the price. Its a great beer. If you like dark beers and stouts, please try this next time you see it."

"It poured with a fairly thick and dense, mellow tan head. It's a very dark brown that when held up to a light, allows none through it. It's of roasted malts, faint coffee, and vanilla. It tasted of these malts and a little vanilla, chocolate and strongly of molasses. Fair carbonation leads to an alright, creamy mouthfeel. It's a very smooth, drinkable beer that's one of my favorites."

"Ya' know, this is a pretty nice beer. Complex and fully flavored, yet light enough to drink well, but probably kinda' dangerous."
"Overall, a very substantial stout. Unlike any other stout I have had-this one packs a punch. Let this one warm some for a better drinking experience."
"The beer is poured a black color with touches of brown and red along the sides of glass. A thick inch and half high head forms, creamy beige in color that settles on top and goes no where. A sweet dark bread fragrance is there at the start, followed by dried fruit and some raisons, with a touch of coffee. The aroma does finish with yeasty sort of twang at the end, making your nose twitch slightly. The dark bread from the aroma hits the palate in the taste right off the bat that then blends to a yeasty twang. The taste finishes with a burnt grain bitterness and hoppy bitterness of citrus and grass. A thin watery feel that gains weight as it crosses the palate, finishing with mild dryness at the end. This beer was not what I expected the feel stayed the same for a Guinness and the color was probably darker than the usual offering. The things that made this different were the taste and aroma both of which were much better than the typical pint you would get anywhere else, a very good beer."
"12oz. bottle. huge head of foam like a tit with an inny nipple. smells a bit boozy and coffee and chocolate. slightly heavy. chocolate and very drinkable for 7.5abv slight crack cocaine after taste at first but slowly fades half way threw the glass... ..."
"Overall: After years of not being available in America, Guinness has impressed me with this fine piece of brewed heaven. I can say ""Foreign Extra"" is for Guinness lovers, and real beer drinkers alike."
"Hopefully in the future this will replace extra stout on the taps everywhere. Good beer."
"Overall: I think I've said enough in the above. This is a traditional style and I tend to favor the non-traditional, ""lunatic"" styles of beer. Having said that I still think this beer is exceptional. One of the best of its style that I've had. Incredible balance and wonderful uniqueness."
"I like this beer. Will it replace my imperial or American stouts? Nope. But I probably will pick up another bottle the next time I'm at the store."
"In all I thought this was a great beer, I will definately buy it again as it is a great go to stout for a decent price."
"A tasty, although not sessionable, brew... The ABV would get to me after a few of these... I like this though... Very tasty and a nice fall sipper..."
"D/O: Not super tasty or complex, but rather drinkable; the thin mouthfeel detracts a bit, though. Glad to try, and much better than “regular” Guinness."
"It's really great when you can take a classic and make some improvements on it (except for the butterscotch thing which I just can't abide). Poured with a mammoth, thick, foamy, frothy, fluffy, billowy, light tan head that lasts forever and lots of clingy lace. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is a complex array of roast, malt, acid, butterscotch, masculine scents. Flavor is similar to nose with very little sweetness; bitterness and tang dominate with some butterscotch, malt, roast, barest hint of toffee and sweetness. Man, this is dry irish stout! Body is perfect and so is carbonation for the style. Finish is like flavor and some coffee and cocoa show up - fairly long. An alternate to a world classic for the far flungs markets of Diageo."
"O: I've never had a Guinness I didn't like, and this is no exception. Though I think I still prefer the default Guinness draught variety, this is a nice way to mix it up a bit and still have a top quality stout."
"After having this stout twice, I can say that it is not finding its way into my cellar again. Out of the two styles of Guinness I have had, I shall stick to the draught. The molasses is overpowering, and that was the only flavor I could find in the heavy mouthfeel. Naturally, when someone tries a beer twice one hopes to be more impressed. Overall, I would not endorse this beer to someone who is looking for complexity."
"O: A winner in my book. What it lacks in smoothness, it makes up for in rich flavor that brings credit to the entire stout style. (If they ever marketed this beer with the nitrogen widget, I'd give it a solid ""A")"
"O: A very flavorsome, dry, bitter and sweet stout. A beer to appreciate in small quantities."
"O: Overall a good beer. Dry stout is not a style I'm particularly fond of, but this is a welcome brew from the genre."
"I never thought this would be this good, but there it is. A wonderful rich and dry stout with a quenching hop punch of juicy flavor. Just great and outstanding."
"Beer seems to be a stronger more flavorfull version of the ""traditional"" Guiness. A good stout but not necessarily something I would go out of the way to get but it is very drinkable"
"O- This is far and away better than draught."
"overall, much more flavor than the regular Guinness Draught."
"Okay, so I went into this with quite a bias. I hate Guinness, with a passion. But this... this was actually very enjoyable. Definitely recommend."
"Overall: This is a delicious bold interpretation of the Guinness extra-stout. I really enjoyed it and will buy it again."
"O- This has just replaced Guinness Draught in my book. Too bad it is pricey, but well worth it on occasion. If you like Guinness or any imperial stouts/porters, try this. I'll certainly be buying this again since I work at a liquor store. :P cheers."
"O: Not sure what all the commotion was about with this. I didn't like this at all."
"O - A blinder. Not up to the memory of my Gravity Bar pint, but probably the closest thing available. One of the world's great beers."
"Nice easy drinking falvorful beer. Im glad to have finally tried this one and would recommend to others."
"Not bad… better than regular Guinness. Worth a shot to try if you can pick it up. Don’t judge by the Guinness name this is better."
"Overall: I love the smokiness in here. I was not expecting that. I could see myself having a few pints of this on a cool night. I may like this better than the original."
"O – This is a huge step up from the regular Guinness, and proves to be very drinkable. Given the many options in this style this ranks somewhere in the middle but I still found it a pleasure to drink. Its good to know its now available in the US."
"O- I knew this beer was highly regarded, but it is better than I anticipated. Too bad I only bought one."
"A very nice beer, much better than the normal Export Stout and way better than Draught."
"RJT"
"Overall: This is what a Guinness should taste like! I'm a big fan. It's dark and malty, but has some fruity complexity that just isn't there stylistically in a dry stout. Many of us beer geeks avoid Guinness, due (among other reasons) to it's commoditized, ubiquitous marketing, and the one-dimensional nature of Guinness Draught. Give Foreign Extra Stout a chance, though. I really enjoyed, and highly recommend it!"
"O: I like this, one of two Guinness products I really do like, the other being the original extra stout."
"O: Finally a flavorful thicker version of the mainstream version readily available in the states. This was fairly complex and had a nice heaviness to it – not to mention a pretty strong flavor. If there weren’t so many bottles of beer to tick I might buy this again."
"Drinkability is okay. A good beer with a lot of taste, but I personally could not drink more than 3 or 4 of these at a time. It is a really cool beer, the best selling Guinness in the world, so it would be hard to call yourself a beer aficionado without ever having one of these..."
"O: seems like an alright beer, and I'd have it again. Maybe this is more of a knock on the Heartland Cafe. It was $6, served in a bottle, and might have been old. Who knows? I'd like to try it again if I could be assured I'd have a real drinking experience."
"O: Very good; much better than the traditional guniness."
"Pretty good stout. I can't imagine buying it again, but stout is not my thing anymore. There were a few years in the late 80s and early 90s when I drank almost nothing but Guinness. Had this been available then, I'm sure it would be my go-to version."
"Damn. First time I've had a non 4.2 ABV Guinness. Appearance is black like the night. Two finger head that didn't hold up too long, I'll blame the 7.5 ABV. Some lacing. Smells of caramel, toffee, coffee. Taste of chocolate, caramel and coffee. Mouthfeel is lively carbonation, not too heavy, smooth. Overall, its pretty damn good for a stout. First Export I can think of trying."
"O: A very nice beer, one the best from Guinness. Would love for it to be a touch creamier, I can imagine this beer on nitro would be fantastic."
"O: My faith had been faltering with Guinness but this Foreign Extra far exceeds any other they produce. Great example of the Irish dry and at 7.5% its a solid brew/buy. I saw that it used to not be available, I'm glad its here now."
"This variety of Guinness has more ABV than the regular or on tap versions. The smell is distinctly alchoholic. The taste is strong and oaky, almost as if it was stored in a whisky barrel before bottling! Nice deep brown color and classic Guinness ""fall""."
"If you like a dry stout and if you like the character imparted by roasted barley, then this beer is for you."
"D - A solid Export stout. Guinness' second-best offering after the exquisite John Martin version. Extremely drinkable stuff - somewhat ashamed I used most of it for making soup. Oh well, at least I can always buy more for an extremely reasonable price."
" A really great stout with a classic approach, pure English!"
"The original was a staple in my younger days and still hits the sopt whenever I have a pint, but this was an overall great beer experience. It's like Guinness grew up."
"Very nice stout. Definitely better than the original draught."
"Really, the way this thing drinks will have you coming back for more. I know I’ll be inclined to pick this up if I’m in the mood for a good stout."
"O - I'm very impressed by this. I found this 4 pack in the worst beer selection store near me that I can possibly think off."
"O - Overall a solid stout for a solid stout fan. Not among the best of the best, but certainly worthy of consideration, and after all, it is produced by the brewery that virtually invented the style."
"M - Medium bodied with good carbonation really smooth, leaves an oily feel in the mouth."
"This is is nice stout and to me better than the traditional Guiness bottled stout. However, I still prefer an American stout like Obsidian from Deschutes or Big Bear Black Stout from Bear Republic."
"Back in my late teens when I started frequenting the Dickens Inn in old city Philadelphia, drinking a pint of Guinness made me feel like a sophisticated adult beyond my years. I had more pints of Guinness by my 21st birthday than I've had of any beer since, more than likely. This is NOT the Guinness Stout I cut my teeth on. This poured beautifully from a bottle, and without the need of some kinda widget. The two finger head didn't have nearly the resiliency of Guinness past, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The one thing I notice right away is this doesn't feel nearly as heavy in the mouth. This feels a lot thinner...and warmer. There's definitely a presence of alcohol in this that doesn't come through on the normal shit. This is smooth. I could drink a lot more of these. I pulled this out of the fridge and poured without warming. I've been drinking it bit by bit as it's gone from fridge temp, warming through to the ambient temperature in the house. As it warms, it becomes SO complex. I think I'm going to pull a couple and just let them sit at room, and go straight into a glass for my next sessions with this guy. All in all, this is a very pleasant surprise. One of the oldest beers out there has finally blossomed into what it always aspired to be. Righteous."
"Well done guys, but why did it take so long for you to share this gem with us here in the states? This is what I think most of us always wanted Guinness to be: robust roasted barley flavors, bitter hops, and the easy drinking nature of Guinness Draught."
"Drink-  Much better than original.  Flavors kicked up.  Bigger taste, less grainy and more punch."
"Coming from a non-Guinness drinker, this was not a bad beer. The flavor was almost too much for me at the beginning, but after drinking a couple, I was alright with it. The sweet malty flavors really come a live in your belly and fill you up. Compared to your basic, everyday Guinness, the carmel flavors are much more apparent in the Foreign Extra. I considered this my after dinner desert and drank it straight from the bottle, as there were no glasses availablet to me. As you can imagine, the color is dark as night. I recommend this, especially for any skeptical drinkers who typically pass on Guinness."
"Probably one of Guinness's finest beers. I really with I could a fresh pint of this from across the pond."
"Overall-This beer is outstanding. To think that I've had so many Guinness' in my lifetime and never had the foreign extra that's available to me. This is a top notch Stout. Drinkable, Tasty, Complex, and smooth. It's just an outstanding beer, and my biggest suprise of 2011 thus far."
"O: Now, THIS is a Guinness. This is the real deal. Glad this is available in the U.S. now, had been keeping an eye out for it and there it was today at the Hy-Vee. This will be a staple in my fridge."
"Pours pitch black with a good three finger of puffy light brown head. The head lasts a good ten minutes. Plentiful lacing. Aroma is molasses, prunes, a hint of licorice. Taste is sweet molasses some fruit (raisens?) with a strong hoppy bitterness that almost matches the sweetness. The body is very full and well carbonated. Halfway finished there is still a modest amount of head. Nice sweet and dry bitter finish. Best version of Guinness so far IMO."
"O: As a huge stout fan, I approve of this brew. But just barely. The ABV is a bit light for my tastes, and the heavy dark fruit detracts from the roastiness, which I prefer. But its creaminess and hearty malt character lift this brew to the ""recommdended"" level."
"Overall: A very tasty and well balanced stout. A nice mixture of sweet and bitter."
"Overall a tasty version of Guinness. Will probably buy it again."
"D/O: Great change of pace from a regular Guinness. Dark rich flavors while making the beer lighter than the traditional beer. Interesting change of pace from the traditional style."
"Overall: Pretty good beer on all levels I really enjoyed this one since I didnt have to pay for it but if Im going to drink a guinness product I will just stick the draught version not this one"
"O: Manages to be unique in the world of accessible stouts. A good one."
"Pours an opaque black color with a massive 4 inch dark khaki head that fades to a thick puffy cap. Nice distinct rings of bubbly lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of roasted malt, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate. There is also a slight cola aroma on this one. Taste is of roasted malt and vanilla cola flavors. There is a chocolate covered coffee bean quality in the mouth as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation making for a crisp yet creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout from Guinness that is much better than their normal variety. This is my first of the style and I would definitely get this one again in the future."
"O: Goes down easily, somewhat tasty, not too filling, decent kick, ok representation of style. Overall, this was an average beer for me, one that I wouldn't seek out again."
"This is a quality brew, just not to my personal taste."
"Burnt malt flavor with a creamy swallow. Very much like an iced coffee without sugar. I think I detect some alcohol warmth. Not harsh, but still very bitter from the deeply toasted malts."
"O: By far my favorite of the Guinness offerings here in the states. I dig it. Well balanced, great nose and flavor."
"O - Fantastic stout, the best formulation of the Guinness brand to be sure, do not hesitate to pick it up, and a few at that!"
"I dunno about this one, I was very excited to try it...maybe too excited. Finally saw this in a bar(d.b.a., Wmsburg) so I grabbed one out of excitement. Pours looking like a nice heavy stout, the head falls quickly. What I'm getting from this is an amplified Guinness Extra Stout. Stronger roasted flavor, which adds a bit of acidity and bitterness, like a dark coffee. Like the 'standard' Guinness I'm finding it with not enough body, especially for the high ABV. The beer isn't bad, but you won't find me paying $9 for it again."
"Overall, this is one damn fine beer. After this, I don't think I'll really ever enjoy a regular Guinness. This is the aggressiveness I've come to enjoy in a beer. It's right up front w/ the nose, almost enveloping the area you are in. Then comes the burnt chocolate & roasted malt. Follow this up w/ the bitterness from the hops & that unmistakable Stout bite makes this a beer to go back to. Very good. I could see myself drinking several of these in a sitting. Would pair nicely w/ a wide range of foods as well. Prosit!"
"This one poured out as a very dark brown color. The head was creamy and thick looking. The lacing on the glass was quite impressive, leaves plenty of suds down the glass. The smell of the beer seems to have a bit more of a hop presence that isn't usually common from Guinness. The other aromas consist of some chocolate and some really burnt toast. The taste is very dry and bitter, there is a light amount of creaminess but it's got more bite than most other products from St. James. The mouthfeel isn't overly heavy, I felt that it wasn't nearly as heavy as some stouts out there. The body was a bit thicker than the normal extra stout they make. Overall I found this stout to be pretty enjoyable from start to finish. I would enjoy having this one again."
"Overall, I must say that I am an American and enjoy beer brewed on this side of the pond. I understand that Guinness is a well respected brand all over the world, I just don't care for this. I know there are a few variations and I will rate them individually as I try them. Thanks to my local purveyor for the sample."
"Overall: Not your average Guinness. If you want extra kick, this is your beer. If you're looking for the creamy coffee malt to appear more, go with the Draught or regular Extra Stout."
"I've always been a Guinness fan. In a good way, it's like the Pepto Bismal of beer. If my stomach has been screwed up, I can always still drink with the group if I'm drinking Guinness. This beer is a little more full bodied and flavored with the alcohol desired. I'd probably get this every time over regular Guinness unless I didn't feel well. This is a great beer. Better than expected."
"M: Creamy smooth and well carbonated."
"By far the best Guinness of any style/kind I've had. The hop bite due to the extra hops used is an added welcome and big plus. I'm so glad it finally made it here in my area, hopefully it stays and can get more. This is what the other Guinness brews should be."
"Pours nice and dark with a pretty brown head which leaves a nice lace on the glass. Smell is roasty malt with some sweetness. Has a smell similar that signature smell of Guinness Draught. Taste is malty bitterness, black coffee, and a bit of alcohol sweetness. Sweeter than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout with a more pronounced alcohol bite, but has that familiar Guinness roasty malt flavor. I prefer Guinness Extra Stout but this is not bad at all."
"O- I think it is a nice spin on the original guinness. The extra hops give the beer a little twist. I like the original guinness so I think this is a nice addition. By no means do I think it's ground breaking, but I could still drink a few"
"overall its a really good take on the traditional guiness. not very complex but i like what is going on."
"Like this a lot, why is this not on tap in every bar in Boston? Time to start a revolution."
"D: Pretty unique. Much better than ""normal"" Guinness. Much more assertive. I'd order another and buy again, but maybe not 6."
"""stout lite", this is my go-to when I don't see a great variety at a bar and I love it!"
"I wouldn't have another. It's unique, can't recall another stout like this, but it's just not my cup of tea."
"Pours from the 11.2 oz bottle an extremely dark brown (almost black) color with a giant, thick, foamy tan head that conjures up images of a root beer float. Can only guess at the carbonation level at this point, since there's no seeing through the darkness. Aroma is of dark unsweetened chocolate & black coffee, but it's surprisingly and somewhat disappointingly faint. 1st sip brings a smooth, creamy gift of the aforementioned chocolate and coffee, with a dose of heavily roasted (almost ""burnt"") malt. there's also a hint of smokiness with a heavy dose of hops bitterness on the back end that lingers on the swallow. Mouthfeel is smooth and robust without being overly heavy. Overall, a beer that is well worthy of its legendary status."
"Overall: Quite the break from the ordinary. Certainly the beer for you if you're looking to ""turbo"" your regular Guinness experience..."
"O: I liked this one. I've had better Foreign Extras, but this one was worthy and I'd have it again in a heartbeat."
"Taste is sweet up front with dry roasty-leafy woody bitterness building and then lingering. It has caramelized coffee and burnt fruits, rum, black pepper, light sour fruit element, but it is mostly sweet and then bitter-sweet. It’s excellent and very drinkable, with good, well-rounded character and some complexity."
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a deep dark reddish brown with a five finger very fluffy tan head that subsided to two fingers very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, apples, and subtle chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, caramel, milk chocolate, subtle peat, and very very slight fruit. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. WAY better than its American counter-part. Really surprised at this one and really glad I got a chance to try it. I just don't understand why the one we usually get tastes so bad as this one is a completely different brew in my opinion. Will be buying more..."
"Compared to the usual Guinness, this is hands down the superior beer."
"O: flavorful brew, a little too heavy on the sweetness"
"Overall nice to finally have this and good to see it available here in the us."
"Beautiful pour with enormous dark tan head, and black body that looks a bit brownish when held to lightsource. Nose is very enticing with some caramel, coffee grounds, and black forest cake. Palate is sweeter than expected, almost roasty-jammy, with some chocolate in the mix. Heavier bodied than expected too, though still fairly drinkable."
"Overall this beer is really pretty good. Much better than the ""draught."" It's chocked full of personality. Lots of flavor and it looks nice too. Easily drinkable at 7.5%. Not too filling in my opinion. Solid all around brew."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Any Guiness is a must for good ole St. Patty's Day. Reading and research has unearthed some rather interesting details about this brew. This is made with regards to an old recipe that Guiness used for their export beers and has some ""intentionally"" skunked brew added in. And so as not to bore you with details...The pour is opaque jet black joined by a soapy beige head that dissapates much quicker then the typical ""nitroed"" version. Smell is oatey, malty and not like an OG Guiness. Taste is obviously similar to smell but with higher notes of dark chocolate and some lingering bitterness. For 7.5%ABV it hides the alcohol very well and is no where near as creamy as the Guiness everyone knows so well. Did that just rhyme? Which brings me to my next point, this brew will undoubtedly leave you feeling full and ""fuzzy buzzy""."
"O: This goes down easier than it should for its strength. It is so flavorful and smooth. I'll be back for more."
"Opaque in color topped by giant cappuccino head that clutches the edges of my glass. Aroma of cocoa, light roast, light cinnamon, cereal. Cocoa, cinnamon, echo of the booze with slight prune tang but not too much, roast and hops make an invited appearance and add great dryness/bitterness to counter that famed tang. Heavy body with light carbonation and a clean finish. The best Guinness I've had. Ready for day or night drinking."
"O: Would have another."
"Only drawback is that it's sold in the US in 4 packs of 11.2 oz for aroun the same price as a six of Extra."
"In any event, this is a helluva complex beer, and one I recommend seeking out. I would absolutely love to try this on draught someday."
"Saw this at my local distributor last week for the first time. Had to double check to make sure it just wasnt a repackaging of the regular export stout. I would say this is my favorite flavor of Guinness after the Special version (Belgium). I would put it just a bit ahead of the 250th anniversary version we got a few years back. Nice finnish and in my opinion not as bitter as a regular guinness, very good smell and overall feel. All the flavors seemed to be well balanced for any overall enjoyable experience."
"I gotta say, I haven't cared too much for Guinness in the past, but this was a good beer."
"O: Overall, a delicious version of Guinness, much better than the draught. If I am going to go with Guinness, this is the only version I will buy for home consumption. This is a very manly a tough beer. A good food companion with a hearty stew."
"D- Oh, yeah. If only I had more cash layin around. Well worth a try or a sixer to savor with some friends."
"O - This is what I wish all Guinness was. Massively more flavor and overall a much better beer."
"M: Very grainy texture, and the weight is a just bit under where I think it should be for 7.5%"
"Overall, this is what I fell in love with about stouts. It's a straight shooter and will give you exactly what you expect in a stout and then some. Don't hesitate going out and expriencing a fine stout. Enjoy!!"
"Pours a very dark brown with a decent light brown head. Obvious stout smell here as well as roasted malts. Really hits the taste buds with a great mixture of bitterness and texture. Has a slighty salty taste that is blended with malts and other bold flavors. Definetly a beer to enjoy slowly."
"overall: Not bad at all. I like a Guinness every once in a while. This is something better."
"Overall a decent brew from a big name, I would probably get more if I could find it closer to home."
"Overall - if I had to use one word to describe this beer it would be 'dry'. the combination of the dryness and intense flavors makes this a little harder to drink one after another, but still a very good stout."
"D: Very high. This is incredibly drinkable. I'd gladly have another one... and I predict right now I'd be eager for a 3rd after that."
"Overall, good. Different than what I expected, and I'm not sure I'll be in a rush to drink the other 3 bottles I have (especially since I bought 4 packs of Pranqster and Old Rasputin at the same time) but not a bad beer, just not really what I expected/wanted."
"Overall - This is quite a tasty beer if you're into stouts. It packs a bigger punch than it's cousin, but is very drinkable. This beer is something that I could drink while at home watching movies, at dinner with the family, or at a bar with some good buddies. Cheer to that!!"
"Overall - This is a good beer by Guiness to apease the American craft brew crowd. More flavors throughout. I enjoyed this one quite alot. Nice job."
"Overall: The first question any one has about foreign extra is: How is this different from a regular Guinness? The foreign extra backs more of a punch and tastes more like a normal stout. It has a great aroma and packs a ton of flavor. It is also more complex; the flavors develop and change as the beer makes its way down the throat. In other words: This is different from your normal Guinness, and it is worth spending the extra money."
"D: Because this tastes so good, this category deserves high marks. Equally as important is the fact that this beer won't fill you up. It is my hope that the availability of this brew persists in the US."
"This is leaps and bounds beyond normal Guinness draft in terms of flavor, yet I still find that it does not hold up to many of the fine stouts brewed by smaller craft operations. Don't get me wrong, this is a step in the right direction and is a quality stout that should be readily available, but I am not sure it quite lives up to all the accolades that have been heaped upon this beer since it was introduced into the U.S. market."
"It's not horrible just about above an average stout. The taste is a little weird for me at first but as it warms it's a little more smooth with the flavors merging quite well. The booziness becomes more pronounce but blends with the flavors. Weird but not boring. I really would have to be in the mood for this again."
"I have been meaning to try this for a while. I poured a couple in to a one liter boot glass. Color is very dark brown, with some ruby hues at the toe and heel of the glass. About two fingers of tan heading spring up, but fade away quickly in to a lace that remains till the end. A big creamy nose we have here, with some roasted malt, sweet cream, dark chocolate and a hint of dark fruit. The taste brings me back to my first Guinness back in high school, with lots of roasted character along with bitter dark chocolate, and a long bready finish. The aftertaste stays with you for a while, making you want to continue. It is a little bitter around the edges, yet stays smooth, if that makes any sense. The body feels heavier than the usual Extra Stout or Draught, which I am guessing is a result of the extra addition of malt and hops. A hint of alcohol can be tasted, but doesn't become overwhelming at all. Like I said before, this reminds me of my first encounters with Guinness, which really was the first dark beer I had ever tasted. Hopefully this version will find a home in a lot of the Irish pubs where the two others are regulars. Cheers"
"The stuff in the States may be fine, and that is one thing. But to say Foreign Extra is 'finally' available in NA is another, because the NA stuff is NOT the Foreign Extra most markets get (thankfully)."
"O- this is definitely better than a standard guiness, not an incredible beer but a decent stout overall"
"Highly recommended!"
"I've was quite excited to try this beer, after all the good things I've been told about it. Guinness Foreign Extra Stout definitely doesn't disappoint. The pour yielded a dark black beer with a creamy coffee brown head. I got an aroma of roasted coffee. Taste-wise, this was leaps and bounds better than the standard Guinness - a swirl of coffee, chocolate, and caramel. Full bodied. Quite an excellent beer."
"I also had one in St. Kitts, where they make it, in 2015. It was pretty OK too."
"D. Far more satisfying than the ordinary 'black stuff', lots more character."
"Guinness & Company--St. James Gate Dublin--Guinness Foreign Extra--Genuine Quality Stout--2010 11.2 oz. Bottle. 7.50% ABV. 65 IBU's. (2.25 / 5.0) Big dense lacy rocky rich espresso 3/4"" lasting head. Black pour & opaque obsidian jet black color .Sweet roasted dark fruit fig plum raisin mild hop front. Roasted crusty slightly creamy sweet burnt dark fruit toffee body. Sweet mild bitter hop hot hint end. Sampled 3/17/2011. Purchased 4-Pack for $8.99 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 11/9/2010. Disappointing."
"D: A much better beer than ""regular"" Guinness, but that is not saying much. I like this beer, but I either like RISs more or this is lacking something."
"Much more drinkable than other Guinness although still probably just a slightly above average stout. Easy drinking to the point of it being unnoticeable except the sour/bitter finish. Not anything I'll be looking for except if it's the only thing available on St. Patrick's Day. I would definitely drink it before any other Guinness I've had."
"Sweet banana, bitter coffee, rum, Burnt sweetness of creme brulee in the back. Finishes dry with raisin notes and slight oaky wine taste. This is an excellent beer full of flavor and none of them are artificial."
"A long time coming to the US, the only reason to drink Draught Guinness now is the lower ABV. If you're not driving, stick with the Foreign Extra Stout."
"O: A good stout. This is different than Guiness Draught, for better or worse. If I could change anything about this beer, I would dial the acidic and dry aspect down. As far as stouts go, this finishes a little funny. Good job on hiding the 7.5 abv though, wow."
"Overall, it's the best product Guinness makes, and probably the best FES to style you will find in my humble opinion. I hope it does well now that it is state side. Reason being given Guinness distribution, and macro penetration, it makes a good go to craft like beer in otherwise BMC selling establishments."
"Overall, this is the best Guinness that I have had to date. The flavors are fantastic. I will definitely buy this again."
"If you don't like Guinness because of its mass production, flat finish, and blah taste you should really give the Foreign Extra a try. It's more of a beer advocate's Guinness, much tastier, fizzier, and stronger."
"O- I have only have Guinness Draught twice in my life, both times on tap, and I have enjoyed it for what it is, but it never stood out to me too much. This is a fantastic beer though. Very drinkable considering the ABV and with enough depth and complexity for me to want to revisit this beer on a regular basis. Very pleasantly surprised with this beer."
"Pours a thin blackish body with great tan head and lace patches everywhere down glass on top of a sticky, syrupy malty aroma that has minor sweetness and a boozy, grainy hop undertone. What can I say of flavor/body that isn't known? Smooth, creamy, goes down easy, a lighter-bodied stout that has a delicate balance of a grainy, hoppy frontbite and then passes clean and mellow with a strong malt base. Roasted, dry malts mix with sweet malts like caramel and a touch of chocolate so in other words after the hoppy, prickly taste that first hits your tongue you get that sturdy dry/sweet malt profile one loves from a stout and then finishes with a crisp finish. While not the strongest stout it is well-crafter and a pleasure to drink; the real deal."
"D- Gets better as it warms while the chocolate comes out more. Next time I pick this up I'll just wait till it gets to that point."
"Had heard great things and was not disappointed. Full flavored, full bodied, lots of roast."
"Overall a very good offering and I really like this one better than the regular Guinness really nicely done."
"Overall this is super. The head, even though it is not nitrogenous, is very similar to the draught in that way. Lovely and glad it's in the states."
"O: WOW. Impressed. I always liked draught as it was my gateway beer to craft/import...but this is likely to have me spending my Guinness dollars here instead. Glad we got this after 90 years of absence."
"I took a smell and it hit me with the roasted malts and grains, a bit of something sweet. That first sip was a little creamy but a bit thinner than your irish stouts. The taste was obviously a blast of roasted malts, grains, and some burnt chocolate. There was also a good balance of alcohol, I could barely notice it in the taste. The usual guinness has 4.5% where as this is around 7.5% and after a few you will actually feel the difference. This drinks much better than a thicker stout, leaving you not full after a few, and leaving you with a little of a buzz!"
"Wow! This is one hell of a stout. Highly complex and delicious. A must try."
"O- This fucking beer is delicious! I am a Guinness fan and this blows anything else they make out of the water. This is a very very good stout."
"D: I wanna swim in a pool of it. Delectable, Drink up!"
"Not a bad beer at all. A much different tasting Guinness that everyone knows."
"D- Really glad to have found this and got to try it."
"A pretty good effort, and better than I feared. Once upon a time, I thought Guinness was THE SHIT when it came to beer. Those days have been gone awhile, but this is good enough to at least remind me of how I used to look at the products that purport to be from St.James' Gate. If the calculator punchers at Diageo were to choose to make this a regular offering, I would drink it on occaision."
"Out of a 330cl bottle and into my shaker pint glass. Picked up at Abe's for $2 and change. The stout appears a deep, nearly black color with a good two fingers of thick, bubbly light tan foam. Ample lacing, lasting head. Nose and flavors nice and roasty as expected. Bitter espresso beans, dark chocolate, brown bread, licorice, burnt caramel, and black cherries attack the senses. Approaching full bodied with adequate carbonation and a lingering bitter finish (shocker). Very tasty stuff. Glad to see this easily available here without trading for it like in the past."
"Overall: This is a very good beer. I've never had it before, and I will definitely search it out again. Super smooth."
"Overall: My favorite Guinness type I've had yet. I love the in your face roastiness and full body. Normally I would take off of the mustiness, but I think it adds complexity and character to this beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours an almost jet-black coloring, but with some ruby highlights. The head is a big, chunky, light milk-chocolate coloring that settles into a one inch vision after the beautiful cascade. Chocolate, coffee, toffee, and molasses invade the nasal cavity on first smells, and further investigation gives off a slightly bitter and slightly sour scent. The beer is subtle in it's initial flavors, and it slowly reveals some smokey roast flavors, darkly sweet caramel and molasses malt, and a very sneaky hoppiness in the very deep background. There is also a roasted meat quality to the flavor, as well, although I have a hard time pinpointing it to anything more than that. The beer is extremely smooth and creamy, and the flavors quickly depart the mouth, leaving a slightly sweet and rich aftertaste. Delicious!"
"Also, this is my first review with the ""Overall"" category, so I slightly changed my format, combining my ""drinkability"" and ""overall"" parts."
"D: im a huge sucker for rauchbier's, so this stout is right up my alley. anytime you can take the roast into smoke territory it makes a great beer. fact."
"After tasting the same beer 60 minutes in the cooler longer than the first one, my immediate take was that the carbonation appeared to be higher. Overall, I felt this was a lighter version of Guinness, but I still like the Guinness Draught better."
"O- overall Great beer...probably one of there best..I got a four pack for st. pattys..wish i got some more..cheers!"
"This is the Guinness that you dream of. A full and robust stout. Complex and extremely tasty."
"This is a super beer and i will be buying more. Too bad its so high in Abv. Will be buying more for sure."
"Scores: Appearance 5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 3.5/5; Mouthfeel 2/5; Drinkability 3.5/5"
"Guinness Foreign Extra Stout was black in color with a bit of red when held to a light. It had a large light tan head with good retention and lacing. The smell was roasted malt. The taste was mainly roasted malt with some coffee and baker's chocolate. The finish was dry with lingering roasted malt and bitterness. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-full body and medium carbonation, somewhat creamy. The drinkability was very good. This is a good stout and much better the regular Extra Stout."
"D: I like stouts, and I like this beer! Very drinkable, but a filling stout."
"I am glad to finally see this brew available in local stores. It exits the bottle black. A fast pour produced a towering cap of tan foam. The foam left circles of lacing down the glass, indicating the volume of each quaff. The aroma is darkly roasted malt, sweet vinous fruit and bitter hops. The flavors present more dark roasted malt with bitter chocolate and a touch of earth fruit. The alcohol gives the brew some body through the center. it finishes with a sparse smattering of bitter hops. The palate is left with a powder residue that traps the flavors near the taste buds--definitely a good thing. This is a delicately balanced beer which satisfies."
"You NEED to have this St. Patricks day."
"Incredibly good showing for guinness. I really enjoy this stout!"
"This beer pours a thick black with a finger of thick tan head with little to no lacing as you drink. The aroma is strong with sour notes as well as some roasted barley. The taste starts sour and then moves to coffee and chocolate and finishes with some hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is a bit harsh for my liking and the taste lingers with you for some time. I would say worth a try if you are a fan of sour stouts."
"Drinkability: Fairly balanced but maybe fust one or two would do, depending on the mood."
" Obviously there aren't many stouts that one will sit down and willingly pound 6 of in a session, however for the style this beer is quite easy to down."
"If you like Guinness, but wish it had a bit more depth, then give this a try."
"Slainte!"
"Pours a beautiful dark black but when held to light revealed a ruby red character. smell was subdued but nonetheless presented a nice roasty character as well as some chocolate. taste was where this shined, roasty and delicious all around, nice dark chocolate and almost milk like quality. full mouthfeel and was incredibly drinkable, i could put down these without blinking an eye, although they do creep up on you after a few."
"D: Guinness...this might be the most impressive brew I've had yet!"
"A lot better than regular Guinness? Yes. An ""A" beer in my book? No."
"This beer poured pitch black and formed a huge foamy medium tan head that slowly subsided leaving latticed lace. Looked like a float. An aroma of malt, coffee, chocolate and anise. The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate. The body was medium light and the finish was bittersweet."
"WOW. Amazing. This is truly as close as you get to perfection in a bottle. Pours a beautiful fluffy two-fingered light brown head which retains at about one finger. Looks like beautiful brown clouds! Bursting with delicious smells-slight hit of EtOH allows the nose to take up a flowing smell onslaught of toffee, really dark chocolate and dark caramel. You may also pick up some of the hops in the nose, but they will hit you in the taste. Tastes first of very dark chocolate, and retains a flavour of coffee throughout. The sweetness of the toffee, ethanol and chocolate at the beginning of the taste are complemented wonderfully by the hop bitterness which lingers throughout with the coffee. The beer feels very smooth and pleasing and invites you to take another sip. Really a spectacular stout...probably one of the best in the world!"
"Finish: The finish was also smooth, I would have rated it higher, but the high alcohol content came through a little in the finish."
"Picked up a 4 pack this afternoon to use in a stew I'm making for dinner. This was one of the leftover bottles. Poured a deep brown/black color with finger and a half of light brown foam on top. Aromas of plums, raisin, chocolate and roasted malt. Medium bodied, and fairly bitter, with plums, raisins and roasted malt."
"This is a very drinkable stout and my favorite of the Guinness' that I've had."
"Is this the part where I sing, now?"
"Drinkability: Also good, if not a bit unremarkable. You certainly can't taste the alcohol. Suffers from the awkward taste profile but its totally manageable, no prob."
"A vigorous pour produces a couple inches of foamy tan head. The beer is nice and black like a proper stout. Smells like regular guiness stout just stronger. Milk chocolate and freshly brewed coffee are the strongest on the nose with some dark fruit as well, from the yeast no doubt. Also a fair amount of hops are detectable as well. Taste follows smell with milk chocolate on the front of your tongue followed by a nice roasted malt flavor. Some residual hop bitterness as the beer goes down. Body is fairly thick with just the right amount of carbonation. Absolutely no hint of the above average abv%. Well done guiness. Thanks for making a proper stout for beer geeks and better beer fans everywhere."
"Overall a very good offering and a new favorite!"
"Not as drinkable as many stouts as this is a stronger brew, but this taste is a treat."
"Overall, definitely glad I picked this pack up - not a huge Guinness fan but I will definitely drink this stuff again."
"D: Quite drinkable! I've had two and I could definitely finish the four pack right now. The ABV will undoubtedly pack it's punch in the end but it's all worth it since this is a very decent representation of the style."
"Great beer. I can see why this one is popular."
"Light carbonation, thicker than average body. OK but not great, nothing I'm all too hot to go after again."
"D - Quite drinkable and much more enjoyable than the draught. The roast character is very strong, especially in the finish and has a nice level of complexity with molasses, smoke, and spicy licorice giving the beer a depth that one doesn't normally associate with Guinness. Despite the robust flavor the beer finishes relatively dry with just a little bit of caramel sweetness to round out the roast character, this dryness helps to keep the beer drinkable to the end of the glass."
" The Foreign stout has a flavor with dried fruit and currant notes with pine hop taste in the forefront and mild dark chocolate with bitter and light brown sugar elements with subtle spice with a crisp mineral yeast element that adds to the complexity with dry hints of toast and mild caramel malt with light peppery flavors with a gentle hint of hops in the finish with mild alcohol in the taste. Overall I was pleased to try this great beer again, it is a great foreign style stout which may not be the ultimate example, but really drinkable and pretty hiqh in quaffability for the strength!"
"Tastes like a slightly condensed version of their standard Extra Stout which I would reach for next time given the price differential. Yet this bottle from Dublin surely beats out the Island version as for complexity and flavor."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Both the mouthfeel and drinkability are absolutely off the charts. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky in the mouth, and leaves a wonderful spiky aftertaste on the tongue and the roof of my mouth that's surely imparted by the nice dose of hops. The drinkability? This is 7.5% alcohol and I downed this mug in about 15 minutes flat, which is crazy fast for someone who'll nurse a pale ale for two hours. This is honestly a superb beer, and I'm glad after trying all the lesser varieties of Guinness, I've finally found one that I can love whole-heartedly. The fact that my workplace has just started carrying this is a dangerous prospect, I see the 8.99 four-packs coming home with me far too often."
"I recommend this beer. If it weren't so costly it would be my new Guinness."
"While I like this better than the typical draft, Guinness is still a far cry from any number of the HUGE assortments of stouts and porters readily available in nearly any local brewpub or brewery. All in all, while this is a very serviceable quaff, I'd prefer to drink local and fresh."
"Pitch black in appearance with a highly sustained, light tan head that's an inch and a half when poured. After letting it sit for about 15 minutes, the head remains the exact same. The nose offers sweet malts with some chocolate raisin flavors. The taste closely resembles the nose and offers some bitter cocoa and light hops. There is a crisp malty body that makes this one tasty. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very rich and coats the palate. A good amount of carbonation also is a plus. This brew is very smooth and tasty so the drinkability is quite high."
"NICE. This is delicious."
"D - This is good, but it is very dry, making it hard to enjoy more than one."
"Documented to be a world class brew but apparently only available here in the States in recent months, it's black as night with a thin light brown head and decent streaks of lacing. The aroma is of charcoal malt with some bitter cider. Pleasant and edible. The flavor is much the same with a hint of chocolate. It's a solid mid-bodied brew with a smoothness worthy of Guinness. There's an almost chalky feel, maybe resinous. It's a luscious flavorful stout with more typical stout flavors than the classic Guiness Stout. This is more of a meal although it is in no way overdone and not too sweet. It's a very tasty treat. Right up there with the best!"
"D: Very high - this beer is a new fav."
"This is an over-looked style, unfortunately. However, Guiness has definitely achieved the benchmark!"
"I could certainly tip a few of these, although the bittersweet roast might creep on my palate after a stretch. I am quite happy that this is available in the States now and will seek it out when I'm in the mood for an alternative stout."
"Poured around 45 F into a tulip glass, the beer formed a thick, dense, tan head that stayed with the beer all the way down, with heavy lacing. The beer is nearly impenatrably black. The nose is molasses, tropical fruit, and a spiciness I can't quite identify. Molasses is also apparent in the flavor, with a nice roastiness, light coffee notes, and again some tropical fruit. Hops contributes a nice bitterness and dryness on the finish. Lots of carbonation supports the beer, which is heavier than ""draft"" Guinness but still of moderate body. I could drink a few of these, although I fear after 3 or 4 I wouldn't be able to stand up. Overall, this is an excellent Irish foreign export; perhaps the best of this often overlooked style I have had."
"Personal note - this should just be labeled ""Standard American Stout"" skip this and drink a local stout or 2."
"D - Suprisingly drinkable for a big beer."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was both the richness of the look and the utterly smooth manner in which the beer goes down. While it can be argued that the bitterness here can present as overwhelming, it fit the style well, and found a nice balance between appropriately robust flavoring and easy, enjoyable consumption."
"Finally found it in Gainesville, FL. Poured into imperial pint glass. Large tight, tan head with a balck as night color. The smell is of molasses and cream. The taste is slight burnt/roasted malt, then cream (much like a milk or sweet stout), and then a slight coffee finish. The body is smooth and silky. This makes for a great switch up for any Guiness drinker. If this were available in SWFL I would drink more."
"The first time I had this in the states, recently, I was not very impressed. A little disappointed even. But I'm glad I got two, because I very much enjoyed this one. It's definitely a bit dry for my taste, and the bitter roasty aftertaste is a bit of a distraction. But overall it is a respectable, enjoyable and worthy beer. It's good to see something from Guinness have some body and balls."
"This stout is hands down one of the best Guinness has to offer. A must try for every stout lover; highly recommended."
"D - This is quite a good stout. Wish I would have bought another four-pack. Goes great with chocolate."
"Highly recommended!"
"Straightforward flavors of coffee, black malt, and bitter unsweetened chocolate. Slight bitterness that suggests the increased hop content mentioned on the label. Slightly woody with moderate roastiness. Easygoing feel, a little bit of slickness there, drying in the aftertaste. Surprising to see this was 7.5% abv. Head & shoulders above the regular Guinness offerings."
"A great addition from Guinness to the US beer landscape. I an't imagine ever grabbing a regular Guinness again with Foreign Extra Stout available."
"Pours dark, thicker than regular guinness, with a fluffy tan head. Smell is actually pretty similar to regular guinness, but with a little more roast and dark malt behind it. Taste is where this sets itself apart as a far superior beer to the more common version. Big roasty flavor, some chocolate and coffee, and finishes with a dry roasted bitterness. Pretty solid. Mouthfeel is pretty good, not too think, not too thin. Solid drinkability, I could put down a couple of these. Overall, a far superior version of regular guinness, and I'm glad that it has shown up in the US finally."
"Overall a very good beer, i'll definitely get it again."
"Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, finishes tannic and talcy. Delicious beer, very drinkable."
"This just has the perfect balance and blend of roast, bitter, sweet, malt etc. Extremely drinkable"
"Drinkability is good, carbonation cleans the palate and its very easy to put down."
"Mouthfeel is good and very drinable. I was so excited to see this. This is what people should think of guinness."
"This beer is not very smooth but still delicious and enjoyable."
"Certainly wouldn't turn down more of these."
"This could be my everyday stout. I'm off to the store to buy more."
"Finally, our friend has come to the US--hopefully, she'll stay. The head towers from a moderate pour, and slowly cascading bubbles take some time to build it. Black color is nothing but expected. Uniting sweet aroma with deli- cate roasted grain, Madeira-alcohol and a faintness of hop. Silky smoothness gives the beer a gentle landing on the palate. Mild-roasted flavors pull on the taste buds, while currant berries and a warming alcohol show its size and complexity. Modest hopping, though the sweetness stays in control (or at least the roasted flavors and alcohol keep it in check). Bittersweet finish with a breath of alcohol lingering. No hype of a single-release day of a limited batch needed here--greatness can come in large quantities. Just keep it coming."
"Drinkability: Easy drink ability, and at 7.5% abv it is hidden extremely well. Overall, this beer reminds me of something in between the Guinness draught in terms of drink ability and the Guinness Stout in terms of flavor. Highly recommended."
"I didn't notice the moderately high ABV, and could have downed another."
"Drinkability: Definitely will buy again."
"Finally a Guinness that is actually dark, strong, and (moderately) heavy! Would love to see this on cask sometime."
"Picked up a 4 pack of this beer the other day with a pack of dogfish head indian brown ales (alas the bag I got at the liquor store broke and I went home with a a 5 pack, but enough of this sad side story) and had a bottle the other night. It was a smokey beer, poured cola dark with a thick foamy head that just kept raising for about 15 minutes. Taste was smokey with some charcoal followed by a sweet finish, smell was smokey too with a hint of chocolate. It was an enjoyable brew, which was easy to drink, too bad it's really expensive."
"I don't have a taste for this, although it is the best drinking Guinness that I have tried. The alcohol is well hidden, and I feel that if I liked the taste, I could easily drink this."
"A blackish-brown body with a thick tan head that has excellent retention and outstanding lacing. A very great beer to look at. The smell is some roasted chocolate and coffee with some cherries and maybe some other fruits. The taste is some roasted chocolate followed by some coffee than there is some bitter hops along with some molasses, and some fruits and finishes with more hops and some alcohol, but alcohol taste is not real strong. The mouthfeel is a nice creamy full bodied feel that is very drinkable for being a full bodied beer. A pretty good foreign stout, but I prefer Lion Stout over this one."
"Pours opaque black with a nice tan head that sticks around for a while. Nose is of roasted malts, some chocolate, and a bit of booze. It definitely promises more flavor than regular Guinness (though I do enjoy Guinness quite a bit). Taste follows with decent chocolate, roasted, and sweet malt notes, with an underlying hint of booze. A bit hoppy too--some nice bitterness in there. Something is a bit off to me, maybe a musty or stale flavor in there somewhere though I can't really pin it down. Not a bad beer by any means, but not a spectacular stout either. Moderate feel in the mouth, definitely more body than what I am used to seeing from Guinness. Decent drinkability, though hampered by the off-flavor I'm getting."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass during my honeymoon overseas (soon will again later with a buddy who picked up some in the States). Higher in alcohol content than other Guinness products. Pours a black colored beer with a large brown creamy head. Light alcoholic malty roasted coffee and compact aroma. Gives off strong, oaky, complex flavors. Creamy full roasted and bitter palate. Finish is bitter roasted with some coffee and creamy light alcoholic touches. Nice balanced carbonation and medium bodied."
"D: I am currently half way through my second case of this on vacation (it goes quite well with cuban cigars). Highly recommended if one finds oneself in the beer waste land that is the Caribbean!"
"Excellent - a superb stout. Delicious flavour and texture. I like the 'original' Guinness, but this has a lot more merit. Seek it out..."
"Far more bitter than expected, but it's complex, interesting, and delicious. I'll be returning to this one."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy drinking for an extra stout."
"Man, I wouldn't have guessed that I'd be this impressed by a Guinness product again, but this is a really flavorful, nicely balanced brew. Hides the alcohol nicely, very smooth drinker. Gotta say, yay Guinness!"
"If you've had Guinness Stout in the past and have not tried Guinness Foreign Extra, you've probably observed that the former is overrated. This is not that beer. Try Guinness Foreign Extra and then ask yourself, ""Why did they even bother with the other version?"""
"Drinkability: This is solid. I really enjoy the flavors that continually reveal themselves in more complexity. Well done, and at 7.5%, it provides a nice kick without getting destructive."
"330 mL custom bottle with an indecipherable best-by date, and ""brewed with extra hops and roasted barley."" It pours opaque black, fairly clear, with a few ruby highlights, and is topped with a rocky, two finger, dark tan head that retains a thin cap and leaves nice lacing. Roasty and very earthy in the nose, with a touch of hops. It has a rich, very complex flavor - quite roasted, with coffee, smoky/ashy malts, black- and blueberries, dark cherries, apples, leather and licorice melding with green, resinous hops that contribute pine and a strong bitter finish. It has a coating and dry, almost tingly body, with an unfiltered, fullish feel, and, even though it is so very full of flavor, remains approachable and easy to drink. Delicious and worth seeking out; when I am reaching for Guinness in the future, this is what I will grab."
"D: Quite good. This is the beer I now think of when I think Guinness."
"Pours dark black with brown flecks. Traditional Guinness foam head, though with more bubbles. Not the same as a draft, but still nice presentation. Rich roasted malty smell. Full blown rich powerful taste. Carbonation quite firm, but with more bite than the std Guinness. Bitter close, but tasty. Strong coffee taste. Espresso. Lot o hop. Delicious, great beer. Would love this on tap."
"Drinkability - for the price there are a few better stouts in terms of value, but on its own this is a very solid beverage that i'm glad I gave a shot"
"D-very good"
"P.S. I edited this review after having a few more of these and bump up the points. Guinness, ""Make's you strong!"""
"This is a stout that is close to perfection. A dark opague ebony dominates the appearance, with a dirty long lasting nitro head. A mixture of deep roasted coffee and vinegar mixed with hops give this ale a intimidating aroma. The chewy, full malty body offsets the addition of lactic acid and bittering hops. The result is a full body, roasted coffee, very bitter yet satisfying stout. One of the best on the market. A stout lover's paradise."
"Very drinkable and I must say a quite satisfying beer at that if not a little watery. Not something I'd get all the time but as a go to stout that I can find almost anywhere I'll happily grab this one."
"O: Overall, good drinkability and it looks great, but not something I'm going to go out of my way to have again. However, with the roasted character, dark malt and hop additions, this beer blows away original Guinness."
"D - This had good drinkability. It goes down easy and smooth. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. This really is a big step up from guinness draught. I just wish the body was more full. Id drink this one again though."
"Very impressive and wondering why the hell it took so long for this beer to be available stateside."
"D. This was a nice surprise, it has more flavor than the Draught. Would love to try this on nitro tap."
"D: The beer is easy to drink but I doubt I could have more than one of these in a night because it's quite filling and also has a relatively high alcohol content."
"D- Quite drinkable. Complexities make me want more. A touch pricey. In a category with Lion Stout, I might take the Lion on a day-to-day basis. This is something of a special occasion drinker. While enjoyable on a cold, winter night, I could see having one when I'm looking for a heartier beer in the warmer months (a nod toward its Caribbean/Tropical traditions). Glad it's available in The States."
"Pours beautiful jet black color with a khaki tan head forming thick, dimpled biscuit rising texture floating above the rim of my imperial pint glass. Fine speckled lacing coats the glass evenly as the head slowly fades away. Dark roast malts give of bright coffee/dark chocolate with a slight sour mash note. Air of cherry/fruit note in the background with herbal hops going on. Interesting blend of flavors finishes heaviliy roasted malts/burnt charred malt character in the finish, with sour mash bring hints of cherry/tart fruit. Strong earthy/herbal hoppiness meshed within the dark malt profile. I like the way this beer is going down medium bodied sturdy carbonation level, the bitter dark roasts brings some astringency on the palate finishes heavy with dry dark roasts/bittering hops. Drinability overall is very nice, alcohol is well hidden the booze is not overpowering. Well crafted and thought out beefier version of the beloved Guinness. I've heard people talk about Foregin/Export version of Guinness, I'm glad they decided to release this stateside. Excellent rich, robust/hoppy form of Guinness that I truly enjoy and will advocate to others so they don't miss out."
"Overall, it smells and tastes pretty good. Not sure I'd really go for it again though, but it's a pretty nice offering from Guinness. The best I've had in bottle or can form."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. It is well balanced and has a lot of flavor to enjoy. It has been too long since I have had other Guinness offerings but having this brew tonight brings back memories of my virgin days of beer appreciation and how I always reached for the Guinness instead of other ""popular"" offerings."
"2009 Version: Two years of age cuts all the roasty ash bite and some of the hops bitterness, leaving an incredibly creamy feel (+.5 for sure) that pushes it towards an RIS in body and depth."
"Thick and smooth, alcohol well hidden. Dense and delicious. A clearly high quality product from an old time and true heavy weight of the good beer world. Go get some."
"D: I wouldn't refuse one, but I wouldn't go out of my way for one. At a premium price for a four pack of 11.2 oz bottles, I feel my money's going towards advertising. There are many better local dry stouts that are far better."
"Drinkability: A very good stout and much better than anything else I have had from Guinness. I would love to have this again- it is everything Guinness should be. This is a beer that proves that, just because a brewer is big, they can still make great beer if they want to- hopefully the big boys on this side of the pond take note."
"D--Compared to regular Guinness, this is not quite as drinkable. As 7.5% beers go, this is one of the most flavorful, easy drinking beers i've had in a while. If i want Guinness at home, this is will be my choice."
"An excellent stout and what a Guinness should be. I highly recommend trying this beer. It's not the draught guinness at your local watering hole."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is a mammoth two inches of light tan foam that recedes very slowly into thick sticky lacing. This is a great looking beer. The aroma is of graham cracker, roasted malt, cream, and milk chocolate. This is a very pleasing aroma. The taste is full of roasted malt with hints of dark chocolate. The taste isn't quite as complex as the aroma, but is still interesting. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a very nice beer that I will surely drink again."
"D: A vast improvement upon the previously available guinness in the states. I am delighted that this finally made it over here."
"Mouthfeel is real slip and finishes clean. Creamy as well. The booze starts kicking in about halfway through and I can really taste it as it warms up. I can't pound these like I used to do with Guinness in my college days. "
"A little more substantial in the mouthfeel than I had expected. However, the burnt feel of the malts really borders on astringent. Smooth and medium-to-heavy on the palate, the overall feel is pretty good. However, with the shortcomings in the flavor make it tough to drink."
"best beer I've had yet. It is a beer work of art. It was both smooth to drink and with a ever pleasant aroma to the mix. With strong hints of chocolate, and an earthly darkened barley taste. Its an great beer to try and to share with friends and family."
"D: Definitely the top of the line in the Guinness lineup. Unfortunately, so many brewers have taken stouts to another level that for this to only now be available in the US is too little, too late. Still worth a try, though."
"Drinkability: This is Guinness's big older brother. A strong, bitter, roasted stout that could survive a long journey to foreign lands."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are others that are better in the style."
"D - Much to my surprise, this is a great example of a foreign extra stout. I suppose I expected something less from a mega-brewery like Guinness, but this beer meets the style like a champ. It's definitely different from some other paragons of the style, namely: Lion, but succeeds in its own way. Cheers."
"Very excited to try this beer. The first bottle I had did not impress me, but as I come back to it for a review, I am quite pleased. The appearance is a nice black with deep copper edges, topped with a mocha head, which laces nice, like rows of icicles. Those nose is a wonderful chocolate coffee marshmallow. The taste is a rich, perfect melding of bitter french roast coffee, dark chocolate, and burnt marshmallows. The finish is drying, but not dry, and the mouthfeel is full and soft. Drinkability is good. Paired with some spinach and garlic chicken sausage and a side of teriyaki green beans."
"The gold-standard for ""foreign-extra"" stout, and stout in general. This is the beer which earns Guinness its reputation. I prefer the Caribbean-brewed version when I want more of a thirst-quencher, but the original version is an exquisite experience all its own."
"D: I've always been a fan of Guinness, not as a great beer, but a good session beer I can enjoy. This on the other hand is much different, a very good beer indeed and more of what I would expect from such a praised worldwide brewery. If you enjoy the original, you'll love this."
"Pours a jet black color which allows no light through with a two to three finger brownish color head which gives way to some decent lacing. The aroma is of dark chocolate and roasted malts with hints of coffee, sweetness, and some citrus. The tatse has a nice biteer dry coffee and sweet taste with hints of citrus and a nice hop bite. The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. The drinkablity is very high it is very smooth and very easy to drink. The aroma and flavor make it a very enjoyable expierence leaving you wanting more."
"d- drinkable, very flavorful, not an everyday beer for me, but it's a nice change up from all of the ipas that i drink all the time."
"M + D: Body is on the richer side of medium. Not overboard, and certainly not thin... quite dry, though there's a little bit of slick, oily feel that the hops linger on through the finish. They do well together. A little warmth is apparent on the way down, serving as a reminder that this isn't like the more modest Irish Dry."
"Drinkability- Although 7.5% this beer seems very drinkable, Wouldnt attempt a 6-pack, but the 4-pack that I bought this in seems realistic. Doesnt burn you out on taste, and unlike the more normal version of Guinness gives a bit more in the taste so it doesnt bore you."
"Notes: Why did we have to wait this long to get this here in the states? This beer brings it! lol"
"The alcohol is here but good luck finding it. You'll probably need to down a few in order to do that and given how easy this was to drink, that's not as difficult a task as it would first appear to be. While this isn't the best Stout that I've had, this would be a solid choice for anyone new to try something heavier than a regular Guinness. The combination of the creamy head with the fuller body is tough to resist and I'm glad that this is now sold here in America!"
"Overall: Easily the best Guinness I've had to date. I'm so glad this is available now in the US. It's a really really good stout. Worth the $10.99 price tag for a 4 pack."
"This one might be tough to go long on...maybe 2-3 at most, but they will be enjoyed."
"D) A delicious brew. I would definitely have another!"
"Pours near black with a mocha head and some good lacing. Really good retention overall. The nose brings quite a bit of roast and chocolate with a hint of buttery diacetyl, though this never reaches an unappetizing level. The taste is more roast with a nice, dry coffee character. There is a touch of bitter dark chocolate in the background as well. Dry roast is what really sticks with me. Impressive in that this is fairly complex, though I'll say that the feel did not really help the flavor, as the finish was too dry for my liking. It left me parched, which is a good goal for the brewer, I suppose."
"4/3.5/3/3.5/3"
"D: The best Guinness version hands down and like most Guinnesses this beer is chuggable; but there's the weird Guinness funk that still creeps through but like I said this is a solid, highly drinkable brew overall"
"Drinkability: Too small a bottle is one problem with this beer - can't quite get a proper pint with the serving size that is given. However, maybe that is best at 7.5% ABV. That being said, this is not as drinkable as I thought it would be. I find the original extra stout and draught versions better. As much as I like a bitter coffee flavor, this beer gets old after awhile, it's almost too simple a beer. Does go well with a meal though (Welsh Rabbit)."
"Overall better than Guinness but I'm still not impressed. There are definitely better stouts out there. I probably won't buy this again."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. I've never been too impressed by Guinness before, but this one is a good stout. I would recommend checking it out."
"D- Wish it were more widely available. It's a great foreign extra stout"
"No exotic ingredients. No catchy name. No funky label art. But, if this was a limited production annual release, folks would be lining up out the door for this. Glad to see a real, honest-to-goodness foreign export stout from one of the masters of the style. Deeply roasted malt with a big, bold body. Some faint charcoal notes. Put this in a cask and ship it around the world, it will arrive just fine."
"Drinkability is good, at 7.5% I could have a few of these just fine."
"Verdict: Totally worth the price and a better beer in all aspects than their standard."
"Drinkability: Though I am not crazy about the amount of char in the finish, this is quite a nice stout"
"For some reason I was expecting great things from this beer; I feel quite a bit let down, but in all honestly this is a more than serviceable stout that I am able to settle in to and enjoy. I wish it had a bit more chewy malt balance to it and the nose is a bit out of whack with its fermented prune focus."
"D - A delicious stout; I'm glad it's available in the States. Tons of character at easy drinking."
"The Guinness Foreign Extra Stout is magnificent to say the least; to say the most, it can be addictive. (Something to remember when shelling out $10.00 for a 4-pack - better get an extra one.)"
"Overall, it is a little expensive, at 11 bucks for a four pack here in the Bronx. Yet, I imagine that I will be shelling out for this over the draught that used to mean Guinness in the US, truly a great stout."
"Poured a beautiful Black, with a Tan foamy lasting head. Smell of burnt coffee, earthy and a touch of hops. But then I tasted it, Actually creamy start Medium Body and dry finish. But the overall taste is something I can't figure out. Maybe it's the ""oak""? Kinda Grainy, reminds me a little of the 250th yr. Guinness, But not as bad. This is drinkable, But I don't see myself buying it again.(Actually, this was given to me....thanx D.Kurtz)"
"Overall this is a fine beer, but I won't be having it again. Why? At $10 for four 11.2-ounce bottles, there are better beers out there for the same price or less."
"D-At a hefty ABV and a hefty price, it's not easy to put down too many of these, that being said, this is one of the greatest beers I've ever had the privilege of drinking"
"If you can find this, do yourself a favor and snatch it up! This varies from the regular Guinness which is brewed in Toronto, Canada. This beer has a sweeter taste, an exceptionally smooth taste, a beautiful white foamy head and an aroma worthy of the most expensive brews. A little hard to find, but worth the chase when you finally catch up with it."
"this was it. Once I knew what it was, I couldn't even taste it the same way. An extremely interesting blind candidate."
"D- Now this is a beer that isn't for drinking quickly. As it gets oxygen and warms other flavors unlock. It really is pretty brilliant. It is sold in four-packs and that is for good reason. six of these bab boys may have you laid up for the night."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts and some hops. Taste is roasted malts, hops, some chocoalte, considerable bitterness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has below average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good quality beer."
"D_ABV is a bit high but this is a very drinkable beer. Great example of the style."
"The taste is basically true to the smell--delicious. I highly recommend this. Although there are /several/ important differences between this and the canned Guinness ""draught, pasteurized stout," the most striking of all to me is that this beer has hops you can taste. (The taste of these hops is more apparent to me than their smell.) I know hops are not really the defining ingredient of the style, but I always like at least a little of that fresh bitterness, and it's particularly interesting coupled with the rather ""creamy"" mouthfeel."
"this beer pours black as a guinness should with a towering head of foam that recedes in a rocky fashion. the aroma is lovely, nice warm roasted malt scent with the alcohol barely detectable. the taste brings the roasted barley in quantity, with chocolate and coffee tones, backed by the warm alcohol, and something almost fruity. the good co2 and light body for a stout make this a very easy drinker."
"Bottle. Poured into a glass a dark brown color with a big fluffy tan head of about 2-3 fingers. Not having the widget or on a nitrous tap, this does not cascade like a normal Guinness would The head slowly settles to form a nice coaster and laces the glass as it settles. The aroma has a nice sweetness to is along with some dark fruit, tobacco, and slight leather. More sweet smelling than anything else though. Medium mouthfeel. Milk Chocolate, sweet, some dark roast notes. Ends with a slight bitterness with a touch of sweetness. Not bad. Way different than any Guinness I have had before. Pretty easy drinking."
"D: Very drinkable, perhaps too much so considering the ABV. Not something I'm likely to buy apart from at St. Patrick's Day, but nothing I would hesitate to recommend to people either. 4.0"
"I had to try this but won't be buying it again. I'm sure many BA's will love it, but its just not for me."
"D: THIS is what Guinness felt and tasted like the first time I had it on tap in the UK, but slightly thicker. Outstanding stout and sad that I didn't buy more."
"D: This is a nice flavorful stout from Guinness, but a bit inconsistent. If there aroma was more prominent and if it had a little more thickness, this would be outstanding. That said, still very drinkable."
"D: I love all non-draught forms of Guinness. I am a very bad judge of this; I would drink Guinness all day every day if I had the choice. That said, FES is extremely drinkable."
"D: Excellent. I really enjoyed this and will certainly try it again. I grew up on Guinness but don't drink a lot of it anymore, as I find the standard draught just so-so and the extra only slightly better. The FES is definitely going to find it's way into my fridge again."
"D - Sipper. Tasty but not remarkable. There are many imperial stouts I'd rather have."
"Crazy drinkability, this seems sessionable, not sure I would have the guts to try. Pretty much as good as I remember if being back in the day..."
"I haven't had a Foreign/Export Stout before, but this would fall short for a RIS or even a stronger regular American Stout"
"Notes: This Irish brew is a full bodied treat, yet at the same time very sessional. It's ABV is hardly noticeable. A solid brew by any means, and one that I plan to have on hand come next St. Patrick's Day."
"Dr. I think two would be max for me."
"D- I wish everyone would switch out their Guinness lines for this. Give people a taste for a real stout. Great flavor but the dryness might hold it back as it wears on the palate."
"Drinkability: Cheers to Guinness for this one! It's super solid with great flavors and a near perfect mouthfeel; weight might slow me down after one or two, and the ABV would likely catch up at 7.5% after a couple as well, but nice for a cold night and I'm more than cool feeling that I could drink 2, maybe even three. Price point was good too -- 2 bucks/bottle."
"D-overaall a very delicious brew with a nice complexity of flavors that compliment rather than overdue each other"
"I like this. It is an instant friend. Sure beer geeks have been ready for this to arrive stateside for 20 years, but I guess Diageo had to wait until there was enough frat boy Irish Pub hype to ensure a sufficient market, which isn't wrong for a large concern. So great, it's here, so let's do it."
"Drinkability is pretty smooth, some light lingering sweetness and stickyness, a bit of booze, and fair amount of bitterness."
"This is unquestionably the best thing Guinness has going for it. Its rich and complex. Not watery like their flagship brew. I think the best quality is the fact they didn't muck things up with that nitro widget. I am glad this brew is available here in the states. It blows the doors off their other offerings. Here's hoping Guinness/Diagio start to focus on brews like this."
"Overall, I wasn't crazy about this beer. There is way to much roasted malt flavor for my liking."
"d- overall this is one of my new favorites a must try i would drink this all day if i could"
"At 7.5% ABV with a pronounced flavor, this one is just verging on a sipping stout, but it still retains some drinkability."
"One can't help but wonder if Guinness' Extra Stout and Foreign Extra can survive on the same shelves together. I haven't done a thorough side-by-side yet, but there would seem to be only the slightest of differences between the two; the most prominent being more of that lactic sourness and the bigger warming from alcohol."
"For all its full, well-executed flavors, this Guinness remains really easy-drinking (ABV is completely masked). Glad this one is now more widely available--I like it exponentially more than the other Guinness beers."
"Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. A slight warming alcohol touch. Drinkability is pretty good. I could sip a few of these despite the 7.5%. Just expected to be more blown away by the taste."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a sudsy, quarter inch tan-colored head embedded with ringlets around the edges. Head eventually settles into a solid skim with some clusters of bubbles around the edges. Some spots and strands of lacing adhered to the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose reveals a trace of roast and sour lactic acid. Taste expresses char up front, more sour watery lactic acid, a slightly metallic quality and a bitter acrid aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency, with a lively, slightly prickly carbonation and a subtle creaminess. Well, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed by this bear. I'm a bit more used to some sweetness and a suggestion of fruit in my Foreign/Export Stouts - this was bitter, burnt and acrid. Not something I need to experience again any time soon."
"D: This is a world-class beer, not to be confused with it's cousin, Guinness Extra Draft. My only regret is that it has taken so long to come back to America."
"Overall: Just released in the U.S. for the first time in 90 years. Definitely make this your next beer. No question that it is the best Guinness out there."
"I give two enthusiastic Schlitz for this beer. It's delicious and I can only hope that it eventually makes its way to my little town."
"D - Well it may not be the first thing on my mind, but I could see getting another four pack. The problem is that 10.50 for a four pack for this is pricey and not the first beer that would come to mind for the price. Overall if you got the money and you can find it pick up a four pack you will not be disappointed."
"Drinkability: Yeah one's enough. After ninety plus years away from America I some how expected this to have more of a wow factor but was disappointed. Still drinkable and one I'll revisit."
"D: Can drink this any time of day and would be able to drink many of these before losing it. Would highly recommend to many others."
"D= This is an excellent beer. Worth checking out for sure. The draught Guinness I hate and extra stout I liked but prolly wouldn't buy again but this is worth a repeat purchase. Try this one at least."
"D- Excellent flavor, nicely balanced. I could drink a whole lot of this, but then the 7.5 ABV would destroy me. I would love to try this on tap if that is even possible."
"Overall: It really strikes me as a more ""Guiness"" guiness. Almost like the ""regular"" is guiness-lite."
"Drinkability: A great beer no matter how you look at it."
"Better than some of the the other Guinness beers I have had, but nothing special. It is certainly not as good as I was expecting it to be. Just a slightly above average stout here."
"Overall a much more enjoyable stout than the draft I remember. I'll be getting more of this soon."
"It's richer than the original, but it hides the alcohol warmth well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine stout. I love the original Guinness, this one is also good. Not better or worse, just different, yet the same... definitely good finish a four pack of this easily."
"T: Best I've had from St. James Gate."
"The bottle I purchased did not have the nitrogen widget in it, which made me glad. The natural carbonation really brought out the flavors. For nearly 8% abv it hides the alcohol well. However, I thought the body could use a little bit more 'chewyness' and perhaps add a little more bitterness to the flavor. Otherwise, this is a terrific brew. I hope to always have a few bottles in the fridge for when I desire a stout."
"Dark black color with a large, rising head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Lacing coats the entire glass surface all the way down to the last sip. Rich aroma of dark malt, chocolate malt, and a little roasted malt. Malt lovers will love the aroma of this beer. The flavor was a little sweeter than what I expected. Flavor is more from the unroasted malt than the bitter roasted malt. Quite a bit of chocolate malt can be tasted. Alcohol is strong in the finish and that lowers my score a little. Solid, full body with good carbonation. So this is the beer they drink in the tropics? Would not be my first choice but more like I want on this cold winter day."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! It has the typical black malt bitterness with a hint of chocolate malt sweetness. It's like a normal Guinness on steroids. It's dry and roasted and smooth as hell. The taste is great as well. It's bitter up front with loads of patent malts. It's goes down smooth and dry with a touch of chocolate malt sweetness. I love the black malt component. It's richer than the original, but it hides the alcohol warmth well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine stout. I love the original Guinness, but this one is better."
"overall a great beer. about time it's available in the US. a perfect thanksgiving eve beer with a foot of snow on the ground and another storm coming. a perfect beer to pair with a warm fireplace!!"
"Beer is medium bodied and very bitter. Its a little sweet up front but very very bitter. It finishes very dry, its good but I've had better Guinnesses...Guinnessi?"
"I was waiting for years to try the fabled Foreign Extra Stout, and while there was probably no beer that could live up to the mounting expectations, I am very pleased overall with this offering from Guinness. I'm still not sure whether I like this or Extra Stout better though."
"I would really like to try this on tap somewhere because the carbonation slightly prohibits the creaminess that is often experienced with the nitro tap."
"Poured from the bottle a dark blackish brown with ruby red highlights when held to thelight with a thick Rocky/creamy tan head that settled to a nice tan ribbon that lasted for the beer and left lacings. Smell is of roasted malt with a slight coffee and chocolate notes and bitter hops. Taste is domnated by bitter roast malt with a hint of chocolate and coffe and the hops work right along with the bitterness of the grains. Mouthfeel is full and smooth and creamy, a lot of folks commment about it being heavy but this is a full bodied beer with a wonderful smoothness about it. Drinkability is excellent, the balanced carbonation and moderat alchohol level make this a wonderful stout!"
"Cheers."
"I'm also curious about the marketing for it. It looks really similar to the other varieties and I can imagine that potentially causing some confusion."
"This is an enjoyable and very unique brew, and I'm glad I've finally had the opportunity to try it. You have to be in a certain mood to drink this, and it's a very different mood than drinking bottled Guinness with Widgets or on tap. Whereas I could drink 3 pints of the stuff on tap no problem, one of these is plenty, as it's so rich and burnt. I would buy it again."
"Light and smooth. A bit rich. A decent beer I was expecting more from the other reviews. The flavors were done well, but not exceptionally well. I prefer Lion Stout to this guy any day."
"From 11.2 fl. oz. bottle no. 15124. Sampled on November 18, 2010. It pours out to a dark brown-black opaque tone with about an inch of foamy, brown head that lingers and laces. The aroma has a sort of burnt malt and butterscotch feel to it with a touch of bitter hops behind. Medium body. The taste is clean enough with a good solid bitterness and a malty characteristic that kind of reminds me of a Mallo bar. Compared to the Guinness regular Extra Stout the alcohol is more notable. But compared to other stouts it is not. I am not enamoured by it but found it to be fairly drinkable."
"D- Quite nice, the bitter flavour is quite nice, but I believe it could be better. The coffee flavour blends into the bitterness, but I think it could blend smoother, some sips it seemed quite harsh."
"D - I enjoyed this beer."
" The mouthfeel was better than I expected but still seemed just slightly thinner than desired in the mouth, but this thinness makes me want to drink another Foreign Extra after this one is done!"
"this is the Guinness my grandfather enjoyed as a young one I imagine"
"D: I am really enjoying this beer. If you're a fan of Guinness, you should definitely try this."
"Overall: A very pleasant surprise, definitely not the easygoing Guinness which I enjoy well enough; this one is one I will actively seek out again--soon."
"A beer that does the Guinness legacy proud. Now why can't they produce a Dry Stout that does the same? They were pretty close with the Guinness 250, but it shouldn't take an historic anniversary to goad them into doing it."
"Fairly easy to drink, but not one after the other. Good to start or end the evening, but not sessionable. Glad I found this."
"Reminds me of a Russian Imperial Stout more than the ""mother's milk"" of regular Guinness. Hops it you first with a bitter bite, but the malt keeps it from overwhelming the balance. The alcohol is very present in the mouthfeel and burns a bit on the back of the throat. 7.5 percent. NICE! That's where the RIS confusion comes in. Great beer."
"Pours a fantastic deep black color with great head and wonderful lacing. It has a huge deep aroma, with great malty sweetness underneath a great roasted grain and coffee aroma. Wonderful taste, a wonderful thick dry stout with coffee tones and a slight hint of chocolate, with a nice light hop after tone on the tongue. It goes down wonderfully smooth with just the slightest roughness from the higher ABV. This is a wonderful stout, perfection."
"Drinkability: Now this is a Guinness! Best Foreign/Export Stout I have had."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Creamy, with a dry finish. I really like this version of Guinness, and am glad it is available."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Obviously, nothing like the standard Guinness... this one is really well done - even if I did have to drop $5 on 11.2oz."
"I end with one thing: I am now glad its in the US market."
"A nice beer overall, and quite enjoyable!"
"D: Very drinkable, definitely lived up to the hype that I read about it."
"I poured into a snifter to three inches of brown head. It is black is color. The aroma is very sweet with some dark fruit and bready undertones. The taste begins with dark fruits, followed by roasted malt, and finishing with some bitterness. The mouthfeel is not as creamy of the nitrous cans but it's not bad. I still think extra stout is the best of the family."
"11.2oz bottle. Best Before Date of L0244GF0001. Unsure of what that means. Pours an almost black with very minimal head. Aromas of roasted malts and some coffee. Flavors of some more coffee and chocolate but also some molasses. Aftertaste of roasted malts. Pretty smooth stout. Nothing revolutionary but nothing bad either. I liked it and I'd look for it in a bar but probably won't rush out to buy another 4 pack for $10."
"Drinkability - very good. I find it to be a nice, balanced beer, not too heavy, and though the alcohol content isn't super high, the flavors still mask it well. I will definitely drink this beer again."
"Overall: A very original and tasty stout. It is sweet, spicy and smooth and leaves the draught in the dust. Shame on you, Diageo, for having the ability to make awesome beer and still producing mediocre brews."
"It's certainly how I described it (regular Guinness amped up) but it's left me wanting more. Perhaps it just needs to warm up a bit? Regardless, I would still recommend it."
"D - A wonderful stout that hits a nice medium between standard stouts and an RIS. In my opinion, Guinness' best beer by far -- I'm so glad they've started bringing this stateside."
"D: This didn't really taste all that different from a normal Guinness extra stout to me, but it's still a solid example of the style."
"D. The best Guinness I've ever had. A good beer that I've waited quite awhile to try. I'm glad this is finally available in the US."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is a smoother, slightly more complex version of the typical Guinness Draught and it shows in the feel and the flavors. There's a bit more alcohol to take into account, but it still goes down well and drinks like a champ. I'll probably pick up another bottle and see how it does with a bit of age on it to mellow out the taste."
"D-well...it gets more bitter as the drink goes on...i find this undesirable. the abv hits quickly, its great tasting but its for some reason its a difficult beer to finish."
"O: So much promise with a great appearance and appealing aroma. I'll try this one again to double check the flavor. Could have been so much more."
"Nearly flawless pour - coal black, a voluminous mocha-shaded head - lasting, creamy, dimpled - that leaves handsome drapes of lacing - as much as one associates a thick, creamy, dense head with Guinness (Draught) - this may be why I hesitate to give perfect marks to the look (but it's damn close). Moving on, the aroma is surprisingly not as rich the flavor - just lightly bitter/roasty and sweet, yet naturally appealing. My oh my, does this taste and drink wonderfully! The bitterness kicks up a couple notches, though never coming off biting or feeling astringent. There is a light, smooth acidity that lingers from a moderate-strength roasty foundation - but just a soft touch. Instead of chocolate flavors (which I was half expecting), I found subtle vanilla notes, starting in the tail of the middle through the finish. Delightful. Add to all of this some molasses flavors and light viscosity and an almost perfect mid-range degree of body, and this is a thoroughly well-balanced, highly enjoyable export stout - and one of the best no-frills, stronger stouts I've had. Says a lot. Again, worth it."
"Drinkability? It is no light weight when it comes to the abv but I'm finding the alcohol is hidden very well. Much more so than the super delicious Belgian(John Martin) version that is only a half a percent more. Not a session brew, for sure, but I've finished my first bottle and 1 more will finish a very good sitting with a very good Foreign Extra Stout."
"Now, when is Guinness going to give us a Russian Imperial?"
"Taste: Not as good as the smell. Smokey and rich. Roasty, sweet. Really unlike any other stout I've had before."
"D - Just builds off of a regular ""american"" guinness and turns it into something that much better. I've been jealous about practicly everywhere else in the world getting this except the US but nowI can drink what all the fuss is about."
"The drink on this one is great. It's got a great balance, is extremely smooth. A very nice, viscous stout. I would have to say this is probably the best pints of Guinness I have ever had. This is not a heavy as traditional Guinness, so I would have to say, I could probably drink these all night. ABV is a little high, so some people might not be able to do more then 2. Otherwise an amazing stout."
"offered for free but probably save my money for something a little better"
"I've been itching to try one of these ever since I heard they were coming to America. Though Eddie Murphy will not be involved in this experience I still am able to gaze upon a super dark brown. This beer isn't able to be penetrated by light and has a nice thick tan foam that you can easily sit a bottle cap on (I actually try it from time to time, this one floated longer than most). The smell is mainly of coffee and roasted dark chocolate. There seems to be a decent light hop aroma making its way through to the nose accompanied by some molasses for sweetness. There is a lot of burnt taste in this beer, I know it's too the style but it takes some getting used to. I honestly didn't think that I would be able to taste the distinctive Guinness sour flavor, but there it is waiting for me in the aftertaste. I didn't really expect to taste the liquor in this beer, but it makes itself known as well. With all those notes it still remains predominantly a roasted dark chocolate flavor adding some burnt biscuit taste as well. The liqour roast combo just doesn't seem to work right, and I don't know why. It's very velvety on the tongue, but the bitterness mixed with the astringency of the beer removes it from the perfect pantheon I would have hoped for. Overall this is a very good beer, and I would have it again if I'm in the mood for deep roast."
"Overall: This is a true Guinness and a good traditional stout. Not quite complex and sweet enough to put it in the exceptional range, but great for what it is. For the price though, I think I'll be sticking to Victory's Storm King Stout for the most part."
"D: High for a stout. Although I wouldn't pick up another 4-pack."
"poured into a snifter the color is dark brown/black and a decent sized head. strong lacing throughout. smell is of sweet chocolate and roasted malt. tastes like the guinness draught only with a strong hint of chocolate and bigger roasted malt profile. much drier than the sweet smell would imply. also tastes a little like generic grain. mouthfeel is a nice creamy feel that goes down incredibly smooth and with little mouth-coating and aftertaste. Drinkability is fairly decent. It's priced a little higher than it should be at $11 a 4-pack of 11.2 oz bottles. Decent beer, but at its price point I wouldn't get again unless craft options are limited or the price comes down."
"This has been a long time coming. I like. If you strip all of what makes this interesting then you would have the generic thin shit they sell in the US. Wow, they should just scrap the crappy Guinness thats sold in the US now and replace it with this."
"Overall a fantastic stout that I'm glad I tried. With the fantastic selection of local & regional 'big' stouts out there, I doubt I'll be rushing out to buy a 4-pack of this soon, but you never know. The looks on this baby are absolutely picturesque. The acrid/smokey/bitter characteristics are stellar!"
"This beer is black with brown edging. It had a rocky, mocha color head that didn't stay very long. Slightly hoppy aroma noted, also roast coffee. It had a distinct sour tinge to the nose. Forward roasted malt on the tongue initially, semi smoky, oats. It has a very tart, sour taste that I am not used to expecting from a Guinness. Medium body and carbonated. The tartness throws it off a bit, I still prefer the original Guinness in a can with the widget!"
"Seems to have less sweetness than most of the Export stouts I have had. A twinge of sourness and a dry, roasty malt character fit into the Guinness portfolio well. I really think I like the Extra Stout better than this one, even though I had high hopes for this. Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style and the fruitiness comes and goes in flashes. Of course it is better than the draught, but I cant help but think this is not the same beer that is offered in Africa and Ireland."
"MF&D - Full bodied and sticky. Went down well, even at 7.5%ABV. Perfect choice for the colder weather. I can't wait to try this on draft and with a good cigar."
"Good foreign stout. The novelty and long wait alone were worth paying the $9.99 for the 4-pack, but a second purchase at that price? I won't know until the next time I enter a store."
"D- Loved it. Can't wait to try it on draft."
"D- This beer is ok but I expected a little more than what I tasted. Guinness really isn't my thing and this one just proves it more and more. I didn't mind it but it's not the thing I expected it with all the hype from it."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy but nothing spectacular. Overall an enjoyable stout. Certainly better than the original but there are plenty of other cheaper American stouts/porters that I would rather have."
"D: I'd prefer to have this over the regular Guinness, but it's not available in the States. Alas."
"T - Malts along with a much bolder taste than the Draught. After 2 beers I'm getting more and more attached to the taste."
"Overall, this is wonderful, and by far, my favorite Guinness!"
"Guinness Draught is bad, Guinness Extra Stout is good, but this is fantastic. An excellent stout, and one that is unique in its excellent dry bitterness. Well-balanced and delicious."
"D: A nice brew... I can see why it got quite a bit of attention prior to arriving in the US. Can't say its a great stout, but I enjoyed it."
"Pours a near black color with brown edges, couple finger khaki colored head not super tight that left some nice webby lacing on the glass. The aroma is a bit grainy and has some metallic notes along with a light roasted malt and licorice presence. Perhaps a slight touch of butter. The taste has a good roasted malt flavor, some charred wood, and licorice. There is a noticable grassy bitterness as well. Some rust like flavors as well. The feel is moderate with prickly carbonation, fairly crisp as in it doesn't linger on your palate. Finishes slightly dry with a roasty bitterness. Indeed a tasty Guinness stout with the roasted malt really coming through. It drinks fairly easy and the 7.5abv is well hidden."
"D - This is one of the few mass-produced brews that is truly world-class. Now that it is on shelves in Florida (and indeed the US) I will be sampling my fair share."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch brown head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, dark fruit, molasses, dark chocolate and coffee. The brew tastes like roasted and burnt/charred malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and some hops. Finish is mostly roasty and bitter, but some sweetness kicks in as the beer warms up. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and a bit coating, and it's also well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's very smooth and goes down easy enough. I think this is a solid brew, it's worth trying."
"O - For the price, it's a solid value. When I first got into craft maybe 20 years ago, there was Sam Adams Cream Stout and Guinness. You could find the Extra Stout in bottles, but everyone wanted the draught. Once they started releasing that in cans, then all I heard was that I needed the FES. This is one of the beers that got me into craft beer. It's nice to finally experience in what's supposed to be its best form."
"Finally available in these parts. It pours a dark garnet-tinted black-brown topped by a housing project of sandstone foam. The nose comprises light coffee, pretzels, very light roasted malts, salted cashews, and a touch of dark wheat. The taste kicks the roast up a bit, adding a very mild touch of bitter dark chocolate and finishing with a small scraping of charcoal. The body is a strong medium, with a very-light moderate carbonation, a smoothly chewy feel, and a fairly dry finish. Overall, this is indeed a step-up from the normal Guinness, but not really that big of one. It is definitely denser and drier, with more of a roasted character, but the drinkability remains the same, and the flavors don't really ""pop", especially compared to other FES examples. Honestly, not all that different from the normal GES, but it is slightly different (and for the better)."
"D- The alcohol is well hidden and the strong flavors blend nicely together without becoming overbearing. A very good beer that should have been released in America long ago."
"Drinkability - the best Guinness product by far IMO. Welcome to the states. A nice fall sipper after spending several hours out in the evening chill tonight."
"D - better than a standard Guinness and just as drinkable, despite the higher abv. I wish the flavors were more pronounced, but it's probably something I'll pick up again, should I be in the market for a cheap, drinkable Irish stout (that I can make a milkshake with...). That being said, I found it ultimately underwhelming."
"This iteration of the brand is much more substantial and robust than the watered-down version brewed in Canada for the North American market. This is a stout of stature and worthy of its reputation."
"So did I let my expectations cloud my judgment? No. Did I let them frame my judgement? Yes, absolutely. Guinness is the first stout that most people ever drink. It's the most widely available, and probably the most consumed. Our judgement of all other stouts is based, to some degree, on Guinness, the same as our judgment of all other adjunct pils is based on Bud or Miller. So, imagine a version of Bud that's like all the good parts of Bud amplified to the max. That's what this is, only Guinness is better than Bud."
"Notes: finally, the Guinness we've been waiting for. pretty smooth with good aroma and flavor but i think the finish and aftertaste will put a lot of people off"
"D: A very drinkable dry stout, but I would select 20 or more other stouts at the same price point."
"EDIT: I sampled another bottle recently and can most certainly recommend it as a 'go to' beer for the early Winter season. Also, while some folks have balked at the $8.99 price point at retail, I find the price to be at least tolerable, particularly when I see people paying upwards of $6 for a Guinness Draught in a bar -- YMMV."
"Drinkability gets good marks. No alcohol burn, and modest mouthfeel make it a good session beer."
"D: Maybe I expected this to be a mindblowing crazy experience, but it isn't. It's simply a good beer. Tasty, I'd love to have this in the Caribbean on a boat fishing, it'd work great there. Lion Stout is better, but this is a wonderful brew."
"Very flavorful beer from Guinness, richer and more complex than their other beers. This version is superior in flavor to any other Guinness beer that I have had to date. Someday I need to get around to reviewing the original Guinness Stout that I have had too many of to count. For now, when I buy Guinness it will be the Foreign Extra, I'm glad it's finally avialable locally."
"The new (old) Foreign Extra Stout, what's it all about? Pours out a pitch black with a brown head, thick two finger head dissipates into a thinner one. Some decent lacing for a change! Smell is interesting, has a certain sourness, almost reminds me of a milk stout, with some additional liquorice. No big hop whiffs despite talk about extra high hopping. The taste definitely has peat and smokyness, with an assertive bitterness reminding you that this is the real thing. Mouthfeel is full but not overly rich. The alcohol in this beer is fairly well hidden. I guess the question would ultimately be, how does this offering rate among all the strong craft stouts? It will be a tough sell, the craft beer makers are making some finely made beers that make this beer pale in comparison. This is GOOD, but maybe to little too late, but I do respect an original."
"D- its a great beer, but a 10 bucks a 4 pack...I'll stick to regular Guinness, or pick up a more craft option that gives me some more flavor"
"Guinness could have been shipping this beer to the U.S. this whole time? They've been holding out on us. This is a legitimately good beer."
"The beer pours ink black, and a good sized tan head quickly comes together. It dissipates quickly at first, but that rate slows as time goes on. Lacing is pretty good, but not outstanding. There's not much to the aroma, I get some espresso and that same lactic sour twang that's more prominent in Guinness draught. There's a bit more going on flavor-wise though. A little bit of chocolate leads things off, before that same espresso/sour combo comes in as the main act. A subtle punch of citrus and spice close things out rather nicely. The body is suitably creamy, but the beer is a bit overcarbonated for a stout. It's to the point where it's become a little bit distracting. It's about time that Guinness FES made it's way to the US, it's probably my favorite Guinness brew, but it's still a step or two below top notch."
"Poured from a bottle into my Zatec fluted glass. Intense 4 fingers of dark tan head. Black as the night body. Great retention and sticky lacing. Smells much more beer-like than the original Guinness Draught. Some earthy hop tones, toasty coffee, and and underlying sour smell. Tart throughout on the palate. Burnt coffee. Nice hop bitterness. A LOT of burnt flavor. Mouthfeel is very dry. Quite bubbly and creamy. Very drinkable. Impressed."
"Notes: Nice to have this in the US now, hopefully it'll be readily available. Really nice from Guinness"
"$9 a 4 pack, seems like something pretty drinkable."
"A very enjoyable beer. It is good to be able to get a decent Guinness product in the States now. It has been a while since I last had this. I remember this being a bigger stout, but I think that has more to do with my tastes changing than the beer changing. Regardless, worth a try."
"Great to see this in my area finally.Poured into my Guiness pint glass deep near pitch black except for a bit of tawny highlights when held into some light,a well formed toasted almond colored one finger head atop.Great aromas of deep roast coffee,bitter chocolate,and sweetish rum,all came together really well.Huge roasty flavors from the onset,bitter and racey with bitter chocolate elements,just sweet enough with some dark fruit,and molasses notes to keep everything together well.This a great export stout,I loved drinking this."
"**mouthfeel a bit too thin."
"A decent beer, but a little disappointing for me since I've wanted to try for this for some time preceding its re-release in the US. It's better than a standard Guinness Dry Stout, but not by much in my book."
" M- This beer has a full creamy texture and no alcohol heat. D- There is not a great deal of depth but there are great flavors with a great about of hop support. The flavors and aromas are well blended and each sip makes me want to take another sip. When I think of classic stouts that are rich full and I could drink all day this is one of them."
"D - Good but this is one heavy, burnt, acrid, dry beer. Okay but I certainly need a palate cleanser between this and anything else."
"The taste is highly enjoyable, with a strong burnt/roasted malt flavor that is well complimented by the taste of hops. Mouthfeel is a satisfying full one, with a fairly clean finish. Very drinkable for a fairly hight ABV; this is one of the best beers I've had in quite a while!"
"I've waited a while to taste this, and I was not disappointed."
"D: Good, and quite interesting in comparison to their regular line up. Not something I would drink all night but definitely an interesting beer."
"Very drinkable for what it is. There are very few stouts that pack this much flavor into 7.5%, much less ones that you could quaff. I see why this is so popular in the tropics. Great."
"Great looking, almost motor-oil-like pour. Very dark with a nice, thin, mocha colored head that sticks around. Light smell of prunes and bread. Burnt malt taste that is sweet on the front end with a coffee-like finish. A little dryness there too. This is a solid stout for sure."
"Much more complex and flavorful than the standard extra stout that I'm used to. Pleasantly surprised. My favorite Guinness product I've ever had."
"The mouthfeel was profoundly different from the regular Guinness. Medium bodied with plenty of scrubbing carbonation. Not just bubbles but real heft. All of the components of this beer are working together."
" A different beast than their other stouts for sure, Very Good!"
"Struggling with this to be honest. Looks fine, has the most complex and forceful house character of this brewery's offerings but lacking that morish cherry-ish core that was once the biggest draw of the Foreign Extra Stout. Still quite interesting and a rewarding challenge to the thoughtful patient taster but where is the joy?"
"D: A really nice drinker, I'll have it again. Surprisingly complex. I can certainly understand the reputation for this being so superior to the standard issue."
"D: An uneven beer, to say the least. Drinkable, but not my first choice among stouts."
"A great beer, I wouldn't mind having this on tap any day, but at $9.99/4pk I can find better beer."
"Pours a very dark black with a thick tan head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma has some char and espresso notes upfront, along with milk chocolate and molasses, burnt bread, dark fruit and alcohol. The flavor also has coffee and char notes initially, along with dark fruits, dark chocolate, burnt bread, some herbal hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel is full and rich, and drinkability is OK. A decent export stoout, but nothing exceptional...a little underwhelming to be honest."
"The mouth feel is also solid. Plenty of carbonation. Smooth drinker."
"Poured a black color into a Steinlager glass. Tiny bubbles with an 1 1/2"" head. Smells roasty. The taste is malty with a strong aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little dry judging by the roof of my mouth and tongue. Drinkability is interesting. It's like Guinness with a bite! Being 7.5% abv on the bottle, it's noticable towards the end. This is a 11.2 ounce bottle. This would be good on those cold winter nights."
"- I would have to say that this is one unique beast of a stout. Very strong, robust, and unique flavors... while still being rather thin and light bodied. I am impressed by its complexity. Something I will certainly buy again."
"D - Stuff flew out of my glass. I think that what it lacks for in complexity it makes up for in high drinkability for a stout. Not sure if I would pick up again due to the high amount of excellent craft brews in the FES's price range."
"Conclusion: I have always loved Guinness as a brand despite its gimmicky nature, mostly because of its history. I have always been disappointed in its products available in the US though. This beer however redeems my opinion of Guinness as a brewery, and shows that it has something competitive to offer the rapidly growing market for beer brewed to the standard of excellence."
"Drinkability -- Pretty damn good. Heads and shoulders over Guinness Draught and Extra Stout. Much more complexity, very satisfying. Wasn't thrilled by the mouthfeel, but otherwise a great experience."
"All in all the best guinness I've ever had, fills out the gaps of the traditional Guinness by nearly destroying the watery, uncomplex characteristics."
"Better than good but not a wow though so I can't push it up to a 5."
"Pours a very nice black color with a tan 2finger head that pillows down slowly and leaves nice lacing. Great look. The aroma is deep rich burnt coffee and dark chocolate. There is some bitter chocolate notes to and a touch a vanilla to balance out. The taste is fantastic initially, but the aftertaste drags this beer down. There is a nice initial roasty malty coffee and dark chocolate flavor followed by a really tannic and bitter beer face finish. This might be too warm, so I will try again colder. Great viscosity and dryness on the finish but really bitter as the beer leaves your palate. Overall, this is better in some ways that the regular dradt guineas, but drinkability lacks because of th finish and it's higher abv. Really not something to go nuts over."
"D-I am not a fan of Guinness in general, but this is a really good beer. I will continue to drink it and stock it in my store."
"drinkability - it went down smooth, tasted good, and since guinness was my first favorite beer this holds a place in my heart as reminiscent of simpler times but with a more developed flavor for a more developed palate, could easily drink all day and not feel as if i deprived myself of a great beer flavor"
"EDIT: I read Todd's review and I agree. There are rum-like aspects to this beer (though he may have had a slightly different recipe). Great, great stuff. I have a crush on this beer."
"I prefer the Draught but at 7.5% - I am happy to have access to the option going into the winter months."
"Dark brown/almost black opaque body, light brown one finger head, medium dissipation leaving thin broken layer of head on top of body. Nose is mild roasted malts, floral hops and noticeable alcohol. Taste mirrors nose, fairly smooth and well balanced, not overly roasted. Mouthfeel is medium, a bit light for style, decent effervescence. Good drinkability, though a bit of heat from ABV. Pretty good stuff."
"Pours black with a gorgeously thick, creamy tan head that retains well and leaves a fair amount of lace on the glass. Interesting sweet, almost smokey aroma. Creamy coffee, chocolate, molasses, licorice, vanilla, and some underlying dark fruity notes...very dessert-like. Bittersweet roasted chocolate malt and a more pronounced smokiness in the flavor. A little burnt here and there, but nice overall, finishing with some nuts and dark fruity esters. Lighter than I thought it would be, bitter, and well carbonated. Pretty good stuff...I enjoyed it!"
"D - the dryness and bitterness of the hops of this brew threw me for a loop at first (keep in mind that I've only had Guinness Draught Extra from bottles and tap up to this point, so I was expecting something a bit sweeter). However, I'm chalking that up to a very cold bottle when first poured. Now that its warmed up a little it's going down amazingly smooth! The 7.5% ABV is practically unnoticeable and I know I could easily put back a few of these on any given night."
"High B+"
"d - Overall a very solid stout that is very drinkable. Not as thick as the Guinness in the US and a bit sweeter, but could definitely have a few of these. Would definitely have again."
"Overall this is a classic and is good, but falls short of some of my favorites. The thin flavor and taste leaves me wanting, but the aroma is wonderful."
"pour is near black/ruby edged in the light... no cloudiness. nice lace. nose that permiates the room of Cabernet and vanilla. a wonderful grape scent. chocolate and coffee mild not sweet but bitter quality... earthy crisp tocabbo. a tad burnt malt quality. a tad astringent bitter finish. wonderful just above freezing fall day beer. good at cellar too. sharper carbonation."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed it. Flavorful and satisfying, the two things I find woefully lacking with the standard-issue Guinness."
"About the beer itself, it is everything you could want from an off-the-shelf Stout."
"Overall much better then I thought it would be for sure, Would not mind seeing this one again."
"Thanks to Daniel for this bottle. This one pours black with a rapidly growing mocha head, tall, thick, recedes at a moderate pace leaving lots of lace. Aroma has a worty barley scent along with roast and a touch of honey sweetness. Good balance between roast and sweet on the nose. Flavor has coffee, but not nearly as sharp of a roast as other dry stouts I have tried, smooth and semisweet initially, then a pleasant roasted barley bitterness and cookie finish. Nicely done, the roasted malt avoids acrid sensation for a refreshing beer. Somewhat insubstantial body, but expected for the style, moderate to heavier carbonation is expected, maybe a bit much on the bubbles though. Drinkability is definitely high, not many beers of this strength are as easily quaffable."
"Excellent stuff, hopefully it becomes more widely available around here."
"Drinkability - I love Guinness and id give it a 5 all the way down but i do not believe anything is ""perfect""."
"So how is it different to a regular Guiness: Well the Chocolate malt and hops character ius certainly a lot more pronounced and the beer has an above average taste but in all it just fails to impress me."
"I was pretty surprised at the thickness of this beer, since I've been so used to Guinness Draught. It's got a great appearance, as always, and an extremely dark smell about it. It tastes much richer than Guinness, with that burned toast taste that I love. Not as drinkable as Guinness Draught, but a much better beer given its improved complexity."
"Great beer. Poured from bottle. Good 2 inches of head in the glass, low caronation. Dark brown color, with red hues when held to the light. Smells of coffee. Tastes of coffee. Heavier beer, so I feel the drinkability is at 3.5. But it's a great beer to casually sip on."
"moutheel is great, damn good for a stout like this, just slightly warming, but not so much that it is not refreshing...impressive from a brewery i always wrote off as mediocre."
"D-It is that standard. It kicks up the flavour and complexity of a simpler stout without sacrificing the relaxing qualities or make something overly intense like many Imperial styles do."
"Notes: Wonderful example of Guinness. Has some of those flavors that you think of when talking about ""regular"" Guinness, but so much more to that. Full and velvety body also helps. Good stout that is worth trying if you can, not amazing but a very solid beer. I wish Guinness made more of their stouts along this line."
"D: if this bottle were any larger (500 mL or more), the drinkability would be quite low, but at 330 mL and a 7.5 ABV, it hits the spot."
"The mouthfeel was slightly raw and not as creamy as is sometimes found with Guinness on tap. However it remained ultimately drinkable. Perhaps the beer's ongoing finest quality."
"Drinkablity: Very good brew. Slightly better than normal bottled Guinness."
"Pours a five finger light tan head that fades very slowly, leaving a good lace. Black color, no high lights. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Light malty nose. Flavor is sweet bakers chocolate, with a more bitter chocolate finish. Best by May 25, 2010. 330ml bottle - gift brought back from Ireland."
"A friend brought back a bottle from Ireland. Pours pitch black with a thick light tan thick head that sustains well into the pint. Smell is sweet with a hint of burnt caramel and molasses. The taste is exceptional. Starts and finishes with a caramel sweetness but with complimenting flavors all around. In the background a bitterness from hops that sticks around throughout. It is joined by dark chocolate and a subtle coffee flavor. Finish is a lighter caramel taste that is more than expected considering the aroma. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected but still medium bodied. Overall an outstanding stout. Wish this was the Guinness that was readily available in the US."
"D - Great overall. Really drinkable, would like to have had a full bottle myself."
"I'd drink this again, but perhaps in a different glass."
"D- It's not that I wouldn't enjoy more than one of these beers, but it's such a full bodied, full flavored beer that one is enough at a time! It's a great beer and I recommend it to anyone who is a true advocate of fine brews! If you get a chance to pick this up, go for it!"
"This is very drinkable. I would love to drink this all the time...too bad that's impossible. This tastes like what you always wished Guinness would taste like. One of the smoothest, most well-balanced stouts I've had the pleasure to sample."
"This is well carbonated and briefly rather too sweet (unfortunately reminding me of artificial sweeteners) before a much needed bitterness takes over lifting the brew to a higher plane."
"d: Thanks to a couple of friends for bringing this back from Ireland for me. Never had a stout quite like this. Excellent, very glad I had the chance to try this."
"I would love to drink this all night. Could I? No. The 7.5% ABV sneaks up on you, because you just want to keep drinking this delicious beverage. This beer is an absolute must-try."
"While it's pretty unique and worth trying, I don't know that I'd go to great lengths to track down a bottle. That said, it would be nice if this was an option for us in the United States. It does hold your interest, and retains much of the standard Guinness drinkability - I drained the pint glass pretty quickly."
"Personally: After reading so much about this, when I was in Jamaica I could not wait to get my hands on this stuff. It did not disappoint...so wish they had it here in the states, but alas I'll just have to keep drinking Storm King instead...."
"Nice smooth creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable, if only you could get this in Canada, instead we get their other secondary bullshit."
"*NB. 13 July 2010: This beer is an excellent cellar contender. Brought a second one back from Antigua with me last year and finally broke it out the other day. Superb and even smoother than it was last year."
"Creamy body and carbonation."
"OVERALL: A great example of how good Guinness can really be; basically their extra stout on steroids. This is probably my favorite of their line-up, just beating out the Belgian version. Compared to its continental sister this one has less of an alcohol presence, which, in my view, makes it a little more enjoyable and drinkable as well. Though the ABV is still pretty high, this is one I could enjoy until ""forced"" to move on. Recommended."
"Drinkability: decent beer. drinks easily. can't pinpoint one thing that stands out."
"A great beer that I would take over the guinness offered in the states. Much more complex."
"Overall: After having this hyped up a bit I was slightly disappointed. It is the best beer I've had on my visit to the UK thus far. Added points for excellent mouthfeel and drinkability."
"But I think I prefer the Bintang, it is more refreshing!!"
"I would drink this regularly if it was availible here. I'm not a big fan of Guinness Draught, and the Extra Stout isn't quite as balanced and delicious."
"Pours completely black with a tan head. Good head retention. Aroma is of roasted barley. Flavor is very caramely with roasted characteristics. There is a slight alcohol burn at the very end of the aftertaste, but blends well with the tannins and hops. After the initial caramel/roast flavor, the beer finishes with a nice bitterness. An excellent choice for stout lovers."
"I might add that this compares favourably to the fresher bottled versions I had in Jamaica, I recall those were a bit too sweet, annoying at times. Although I might have had four or five in a session alongside a few Red Stripe on some days ... so I best not be too critical. Irie!"
"drinkable, and this is what i should expect from a stout. foreign stout in my mind is the true guinness. it lives up to the reputation. very complex, great beer."
"Dark Brown, with a 1/2 centimeter light tan head. Smell is rich and chocolate malty. Taste is medium charred- some welcome coffee notes. Nice and round tasting, with a drier, slightly bitter finish. Feels rich, and good for you. Nice beer"
"Overall, drinkability was low for me, because of the flavour too intense. I am not used to it and will use this beer for training sessions."
"Big Thanks to Tayner for this brew. Pours black with a large fluffy brown head that leaves its mark on the glass as it dissipates. Has an aroma of wood, smoke, and roast. Flavor is a little watery still but an immense improvement over the standard guinness products. This is actually quite enjoyable since I started trying different brews with guinness, I love that malty, woody, smoky, coffee flavor of guinness. This brew is all of the flavor that makes regular guiness good, but with more intensity that makes this brew great. A nice strong borderline session brew."
"PS. I managed to bring one back to enjoy so I can be reminded of the sun and fun 3 months from now when I drink it."
"d) Superb. Best of its style I've probably had. Could drink several pints of this, no worries."
"Strong, flavorful, good complex taste, and good atmosphere. This is a quality quaff -one to save for a special occasion, savor, and enjoy- if you can get your hands on one."
"D - Again way better than American Guinness Great taste thats easy to drink I wish that I brought way more back from the Bahamas"
"D - The only thing that might keep people away from this is the bite at the end. It's intense and could be toned down. Overall this is a smooth drinker and is pretty complex, not as mono tasting as a typical dry stout or the version we have here."
"Best beer in the Bahamas, hands down."
"Guinness is wet for a strong stout."
"D: Very nice drinking beer. I could easily polish of a few of these over the course of a night. I'll definitely seek this out during future trips outside the US."
"D - Overall one of the best Irish dry stouts I've had. I don't realyl care for this style but here Guinness comes through. The flavors are big and there. You get the strong roasted flavors combined with a hint of sweetness that makes it all balanced throughout the drink."
"What an enjoyable stout, I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Poured a thick black with a decent head and ample amounts of thick sticky lacing. The aroma was bitter and filled with nice roasted malts. Thick mouthfeel that is full and satisfying. The flavor is chock full of dark roasted malts and a strong bitter quality, slightly nutty with decent traces of coffee and chocolate. A wonderful find for an unseasonably chilly spring night."
"D- Decent drinkability, I had up to about 4 or so in a row, so it was definitely drinkable"
"this beer has an awesome aftertaste. they must pour one of these into six US guinness beers and fill the rest up with water and ship it over here. this is a damn fine beer that i wish were the standard guinness in the states."
"Notes: Got this one as an extra from johnnnniee. Thanks! Definitely one of the cooler extras I've ever received."
"Rich, but not creamy, burnt malts ruled the brew and for some could have ruined it too."
"Will someone please tell me why we don't have this one in the states."
"Guinness is the beer that I used to drink 20 years ago when I started enjoying better beers. Now I've tasted the ""real thing"" and wonder why they sucked all the flavor, alcohol and smell out of the American version and replaced it with bubbles!"
"D - Great beer, far better than the version we get in the states."
"Again, I have to give the disclaimer that in general, I do not like dry stouts. This is unquestionably a quality beer that I did enjoy, but I think you have to be a true lover of the black stuff to truly appreciate this brew."
"D - Oh yeah, this one goes down easily but with the added bonus of tastiness!"
"I poured from a bottle into a glass. It had a nice thick, creamy 2 finger foam that lasted about halfway down the glass before it began to disappear. It had a light, roasty smell. The taste was very good. It starts out smooth and creamy before it becomes slightly acidic/sour and finishes with a refreshing hoppiness. This beer has a lighter mouthfeel than most stouts and porters, but it is very creamy and satisfying. A very drinkable stout with a refreshing finish that is dry and hoppy, with a slightly sour edge. Very good if you like stout. I will definitely drink this one again."
"D: A real treat. I can't say this is the Guinness version I'd want exclusively (flavors a bit oppressive after a while, abv is pretty high), but it's one I'd love to have again and would want to have access to when the craving hit. Unfortunately, a trip back to Bermuda isn't in the cards anytime soon, so I'll have to find the right time and place to enjoy these last couple bottles...boo hoo."
"Overall - Unfortunately, this fails to improve on regular GES."
"Not a big fan of this one but there's more going on here than on the stuff we get that's for sure."
"This machine will plough."
"D: Very drinkable. I lived off of this and Belikin Stout for over a month during a very hot July."
"Not a big fan of Guinness but this strong stout brew changed my mind a little bit, would drink this over the standard stuff in the United States any day, would drink again if I ever make it to Ireland, recommended to try"
"Drinkability : very strong beer in the style foreign extra stout"
"I've never had the Foreign Extra Stout, although I'd been wanting to try it for a long time. Finally found a few bottles. The beer is very dark black, although not completely solid: a dark brown translucency is present through the pour and in the shallows of the glass. The beer is an impressive site, though...the head is mammoth and seriously solid. It's a dark tan, nearly nut-brown color, and it leaves intricate lace. Nice. The aroma is a mix of alcohol, a touch of malt, and heavily roasted (burnt?) malt. It has a serious booze quality, and I didn't expect the malt, considering it's not really present in the normal Guinness ES or Draught. The taste is full of chocolate, coffee, and roasted grain flavor. The beer presents more alcohol in the flavor than is really present in the ABV...rather than hiding it, it become part of the flavor. Fairly heavy in body, the beer is satisfying and smooth at the same time. It's a pretty dry stout, but there's more sweetness than expected. I found it satisfying and solid. Head and shoulders better than typical Guinesses."
"I've been a fan of Guinness for sometime now. The Draught is a good beer that is fairly easy to find in many restraunts that don't have a great beer selection... The Extra Stout has often been a saple for me at home... This one takes things to a new level. What a wonderfull offering!"
" Marteen don't know if it was the beer or the location I liked better but it was a welcome change from the weaker guiness at home because of the 7.5% content overall very good the carribean is paradise. Wish I could find this in the States."
"My first real experience with a true stout that can be called as such. Rich flavor, chocolaty, bitter, heady aroma. This was brought back to me from family members, and I loved it. 7.5% alc. by volume, a nice difference for me and my Guinness draft regularity. Drank at room temperature, as instructed by the Guinness brewery."
"Overall, I think this is the only Export Stout I have had so not a lot to compare to. Either way, this was a good beer. I would seek it out again. Too bad you can't buy it in the US."
"this was a godsend when i was in st. lucia and limited to piton and heineken. i like this version much better than the smaller stuff we get stateside. bigger bodied, bigger taste, bigger mouthfeel. nice roasty finish to provide balance to the dark, sweet, complex malt character. a bit of grainy astringency. why they use fish bladder crap to clarify such a dark beer is my question."
"Thanks to mmmmBEEEER for sharing a bottle from his travels. The beer pours nearly black with a bit of amber around the edges. Medium thick and foamy dark beige head that dissipates steadily, and rings of lacing. The aroma consists of coffee, roasted malt and molasses. Rich, roasty body with coffee, chocolate and burnt malt flavors. Some bitter hops shine through as well. The finish is bitter coffee and hops with malty/chocolatey undertones. Leaves a hoppy aftertaste that lingers awhile. Miles better than the ""regular"" Guinness."
"Love this stuff."
"The beer pours a solid black with a slight dark ruby highlight on the edges. I might have poured to quickly, but this thing had a full 2+ inches of head and I had to swallow the last little bit out of the bottle. The head faded slowly to a thin layer on the surface of the beer and laced all the way down the glass. Smells of chocolate and an almost wine like soury fruity funk in there. Taste is a soured chocolate with a slight alcohol sting. Definitely has that signature Guinness sourness to it. Creamy and smooth to drink, I wish I had let it warm a bit more. Very nice stout, I wish I could get it more easily!"
"My second FES.. this one's to serve as a compare with the hard to get SES (Special Export Stout) that I am going to taste tomorrow. I shall cut the chase and go straight to the beer; this one pours out opague very dark brown black with a thick creamy, rocky head that refuses to settle without sitting for a good amount of time. Smells of caramel, coffee and burnt or roasted malts; very light chocolate hint perhaps. The beer enters with a light coffee note which transforms into thick creamy roasted malts with a certain milkiness to it. When I am near the finish, I sense chocolate creeping in and there's also some dark fruits here which lasts well into the after taste. Light caramel, coffee hints show up here and there and the milkiness was pretty obvious after its initial attack on the palates. The taste exhibits an increasing level of bitterness which hits a crescendo in the finish but somehow I felt that I was able to contain the bitterness much better than the last time and I can really enjoy this one this time. The after taste started off with roasted malts and coffee and this quickly moved on to plums and dates with the malts constantly sitting at the back and dark malty fruity aromas on the nose throughout the after taste. Generally this one gets better as it warms; the mouth feel was rich, creamy, chunky and thick, needless to say with average carbonation (as it warms) and topping things up a creamy smoothness as it goes down. Great experience with a great stout; let's see what the Special Export variant has to offer."
"d: this is some weird asian guinness foreign extra that is not as enjoyable as other guinnesses i have enjoyed in the past; too syrupy sweet to have the staying power of its brethren"
"Oh, how I wish this was the Guinness that was sold in the US. It's sad to think that when I finish my 6-pack, this will be it for me for a very long time."
"Gorgeous. Like herbal single orgin chocolate. Complete, complex and alluring. On the palate it is quite tart up front, like sinewy vine sap (from hops, I gather). Then this releases its grip to reveal toasty fine bitterness. Throughout there is an effusive display of sweet herbs, pomegranate, black grapes, vanilla and coffee. Winey. Food beer. Perfectly weightless. Unexpectedly refreshing and complex. This is not milquetoast, childish beer."
"Drinkability- Don't know what all the fuss is about. It's a pervectly fine beer, but I've had many other of the style that are better and have better outright flavor. I guess it's because of the scarcity."
"I would like to drink more than one of these in a session, but I dont think that I really could handle too many. It is a great beer to enjoy though and I am glad that they are more available to me everyday now!"
"Nice bit of carbonation, very brown color. Quite roasty, pepperry, a bit on the bitter side. Heavy body, warming with some alcohol notes. Syrupy - almost a Russian Imperial Stout. Chicory flavor with much more complexity than the Guinness Extra Stout. Wish you could find this one in the States."
"Bought a few bottles while in Ireland when we were staying in a place that did not have a pub within slithering distance (hard to believe, but true). Guinness is swimming in the deep end of the pool when they brew this. The color is inky black, and the head is a rich brown as opposed to the light tan of their draught. The aroma and taste is split evenly between the roasted barley and carmelized sugar flavors that range from toffee to molasses. This is a rather full-bodied beer, with a degree of sweetness in the aftertaste that is balanced by the roasted grain flavors and a hop bitterness that is more prominent than in the draught. The intensity of the toffee/molasses flavors makes two bottles plenty. While the draught may be an ideal beer to introduce people to the wonders of stouts, this is for those who are already stout lovers."
"D - Good beer for colder weather. Nothing too overpowering but very tasty and drinkable."
"Lots of molasses in the flavor, with a coca cola aftertaste. Roast and chocolate are supporting. Much thicker mouthfeel than Guinness Draught (did a side-by-side: unfortunately, the regular extra stout was not available). On the sweeter side, but finishes dry, which helps drinkability. Carbonation is good. Drinkability is limited by the molasses, which I think would get cloying by beer #2."
"Foreign Extra pours jet black with a nice light brown head which dissipates fairly slowly, and leaves a little lacing. Aroma is rich with coffee and a sweet almost caramel characteristic. Flavour starts off with a bit of caramel, and some dark chocolate, nice and semi sweet which leads into a roasted malt/coffee bitterness. Really well balanced. Mouthfeel is a little on the think side, nicely suited to the ABV and taste. I've pretty much grown up on this stout so have spent many days and night drinking it. its strong but its definately drinkable, and works as a session beer. Despite what you think of guinness draft (i personally like it a lot when in the mood) Foreign extra is miles ahead of it as far as flavour goes and is a great stout by any standard."
"Pours a rich, deep dark black with a nice head that sticks around a while. Richer and fuller in nose and flavor than the regular, but with much of the same ashy, chalky flavor, but a bit more rounded. I preferred it to the regular, but my wife, who is fond of the regular, thought this one had too much alcohol in the nose and the flavor profile. I really liked it."
"Found it at a beer bar in Windsor, Canada and thought it a steal at $4 CA. The bottle looks a little newer than the one in the pic here. Anyway the pour into the glass was brown black with a tint of red in there too. The head was tan and a fluff if a little thin. It smelled of dark sugar and maybe some slight toffee overall it was rather muted even though I let the bottle warm at room temp for a while. The mouthfeel was not as thick as I would have thought and the flavor was just ok for a semi-big stout. I had some good caramel toffee flavors, but overall I found it too be the myth has built this beer. Very drinkable but not worth the chase some people do to try this beer."
"."
"Sampled in of all places, the Bahamas. In fact, this beer is as readily available as any in this country. A slightly more ""deco"" style bottle then the display on this page. Anyhow, to the beer. Deep, modest stout color. What do you expect? Smell and taste are extremely similar in this case. Very rich, deep smokey tones, followed by a burnt chocolate body and a very light licorice finish. A strange, complex, and very heavy drinker. Not for the timid, this is one you don't pass along to someone you may be trying to convert. Very complex, but very good."
"Overall a very drinkable stout considering the ABV."
"Glad I tried this one thanks too flexabull."
"The head sticks to the pint glass relentlessly. Even with the last viable sip, a rocky outcrop sits defiantly. The aftertaste consists of equal parts roasted earthiness and smoothness. This is clearly a superior beer that should be available to all corners of the globe; it is truly a shame that it is not available in New York City."
"Makes draught Guinness, which is still a decent beer, seem quite bland in comparison. Nuff said!"
"All I can say is this: Guinness would make a lot of money off of me if they brought this to the US."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but this really wasn't my style. I'd have another, but I can think of other stouts that I prefer. But I enjoyed trying this one. And it was a welcome change from all the lagers in Costa Rica."
"Night and day from the stuff you can get here - sadly."
"Flavor is nice. Never been a huge fan of the style because it always seemed a tad out of whack to me. But this one has decent balance. Malts are heavily roasted and the hops have a nice spruce springiness to them. Kind of a clove flavor as well. Medium to full body that does not cloy at all. Hops do slightly linger and the alcohol is lightly pronounced. Easily drinkable but it might numb the taste buds a bit after several bottles."
"Fairly drinkable with a nice mouthfeel; although, I cannot imagine it being a session beer."
"Poured into a glass, is a awesome blackish red witha fluffy 2 finger head that stays the entire drink and leaves heavy lace. Smell is over bitter sweet fig leaf and bread. Taste is a bit dry and strong with a heavy sense of bread and sweet carmel, this is a very good offering form Guinness and probably my favorite from the, the drink is very smooth and goes down nicely."
"Overall, this was a real treat. I doubt I'll ever get the chance to have one again, but I'm glad I finally did."
"Although the alcohol (7.5% by volume) doesn't hide throughout, it's not so conspicuous as to make drinking this (at least in small proportions) a chore, and I could easily work through a couple of these small bottles in a sitting. I'm glad I got my hands on this one."
"I was able to bring a few of these back with me from a recent trip to Nassau in the Bahamas. Pours pitch black with a large creamy tan colored head. Much like the Extra Stout offered in the states but much bolder in every aspect. Too bad Guinness does not ship the Foreign Extra Stout to the states or it would be a regular in my fridge."
"D: I don't think I could do this all day like its lesser brethren, but a definite treat. Felt very fortunate to find this, as I don't plan on going to Africa, Asia or the Caribbean any time soon."
"Overall, sorry to reach the end of it, and happily converted."
"D: Incredible for its strength."
"Overall - An excellent stout, highly recommended. If only all Guinness was this good... Not quite as good as the Belgian version but not far off...."
"smooth carbonation with a slightly thick, alcoholic feel. roasted malt with a touch of coffee and sweetness. less hop character than the standard Guinness."
"Looks like your average stout, inky black color. A one finger thick creamy tan head forms. Spotty lacing is left behind. Smell is mostly roasted malts, hints of dark fruits and some sort of sour aroma. Taste mimics the smell lots of roasted malts, sweet, some hints of the alcohol. Finishes slightly dry. Smooth and full bodied mouthfeel. Leaves a twangy feeling on the tongue, maybe slightly sour. Overall a decent beer to drink. I'm glad I was given the opportunity to sample this. Quite different from the Guinness served in the U.S."
"Decanting this 330 mL bottle reveals a midnight black brew dominated by a light brown head. As the head dies down slightly, some heavy lacing coats my snifter. The aroma was much sweeter than I was expecting a Guinness to be. Some dark fruits coupled with caramel and possibly some molasses. Plenty of malt in the nose, with a really fantastic nuttiness. An extraordinary nose for an export stout. The flavor is very full, slightly reminescent of Guinness' Extra Stout, but with more depth. Up front, the taste is very robust - a nice presence of roasted barley and black malts, coffee is also apparent. Underneath this malty facade lies some nice bitter chocolate and caramel flavors. The robust malts eventually give way to a definite creaminess along with a hint of dark fruit sweetness. That creamy flavor leads into some spicy hops that help finish things off. Aftertaste is slightly hoppy, but mainly roasted dry. Mouthfeel is very full and almost chewy. Definitely the best offering from Guinness I've experienced."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, and medium bodied."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" dark brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Dense, frothy head lasts more or less forever, with heavy lasting lacing. Aroma is dark malts with a fruity tinge to it, and maybe some vanilla notes. Taste is alomst like Guinness syrup, what you expect from normal Guinness, but more of it in the same volume. More intense flavor than we're used to from them, very nice. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very nice, although tending towards syrupy sweet a tad. Wish this was more of an option than it is in the US."
"Drinkability: The ABV is a little high, but not terrible. The ale is smooth and flavorful, aiding its drinkability."
"I got a few bottles of this from the Guinness Brewery in Dublin. Poured an intensely dark coffee color with a medium tan head. Lacing was weak. A strong roasted black malt aroma leaned towards being burnt but the alcohol edge overcame that. Bittersweet chocolates and french roast sumatra coffee are the aromatic flavors. Darker fruity plums peak out as well. Taste is smoother than I was expecting. Alcohol delivers a punch right from the start but is never heavy or overdone. Burnt espresso is dominate. Roasted grains and smokey peat are in there deep. Notes of vanilla come and go. A half and half like creaminess comes along and more of a milk chocolate flavor develops toward the finish. In the end the alcohol and espresso are all I'm left with. This is a sipper but quite an enjoyable sipper at that."
"Aroma is caramel, chocolate, raiisn and roasted malt. Deep black with a two finger thick mocha head...very Guinness looking. The fore presents prunes, raisins, burnt pumperknikela nd roasted malt. Finish is very toasty and raisin sweet. very smooth mouthfeel. I wish Guinness draft tasted like this. Feels like an Imperial Schwarzbier. Very nice."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium body. Still, this is not a heavy stout by any means and it goes down with ease. If I could get this one around here...I'd buy it more often. They really should export this to the US! Thanks to dmeadows for the opportunity to sample another side of Guinness."
"Just a note to add - maybe this has been cleared up already, but despite Todd's review from a few years ago, this beer is readily available in supermarkets and off-licenses in Ireland, despite some claims that it's only available in obscure markets like Africa or the Caribbean."
"Better than our crappy Guinness...but not that much better."
"Brought back from the UK . Pours coal black with a rich tan head. This is only vaguely related to its anemic cousin. Tastes like a rich complex imperail stout with all the harsh burnt dark malts rounded up into a symphony of goodness. Drank this in a tasting of Storm King and Big Bear from Bear Republic and this stout seemed as complex and big as those two giants. God I wish this beer was easier to find."
"From Jamaica. The color is pitch black with a creamy, light brown head of average height. Foreign Extra Stout has a rich malty aroma with notes of molasses, although this isn't quite as strong or interesting as expected. The flavor is thick and malty. Rich, sweet malts are most apparent and remind me of toffee or molasses. An underlying roasted malt flavor provides a nice counterpoint to the rich sweetness. The roasted flavors come out more towards the finish and have a drying effect. Anyway, I found this to be a great beer, but not quite awesome enough to live up to the hype."
"Opinion: The Foreign Extra Stouts are somewhat of an outcast with the Imperial Stouts rising up as they have here lately. This one is almost getting lumped in with the traditional Dry Stouts due to its ""paltry"" 7+%ABV. I really like this beer a whole lot better than their original Stout. This one has a whole lot more depth of malt, and doesnt leave you hanging wondering when you are going to actually taste something. This beer has a very well rounded malt balanced flavor."
"A nice "" heavier "" offering from the gold-standard of Irish Stouts."
"NOTE: I remember being privileged to drink the blue-capped, no label version given to Guinness brewery staff as part of their weekly ""beer allowance"" in times past. I recall it as being much more robust in flavour than this bottle."
"Pours clear dark burgundy under a two figure light brown head with plenty of body and excellent lacing. The nose is mild, featuring roasted nuts and carmel, but also including something a bit on the sour side. The mouth is a bit thinner than it should be, and very well carbonated. The taste definitely starts out with something like unripened plum to go with the burnt malt and very strong dry bitterness. Upon further reflection, the taste reminds a bit of port wine, with an espresso chaser. The bitterness dominates ever more as we move into the finish, and lingers long into the aftertaste, although the sour never really fades, either. Although a bit watery in feel, this is a complex brew worthy of high praise."
"33 cl bottle, 7.5 % ABV clearly marked along with freshness date. Pours a thick, nearly pitch black liquid. Barely hints of ruby around the edges. Thick tan creamy head shrinking and clinging to the sides of the glass. Smells of coffee, alcohol, and rum soaked fruit. Charred, burnt flavors along with a lot of dark fruity flavors. Good amount of bitterness. Medium body, with low carbonation. This is certainly a different beast from the usual draught. Very nice, but a little too fruity for my taste."
"Completely black with faint ruby highlights. The fluffy, light brown head produced some nice lacing and remained with the beer throughout. Malty aroma with plenty of sugary fruit and roasted character. Roasted malt and dark fruit kicked off the flavours, with light hop bitterness following closely. Slightly acidic. It finished with a dry, roasted bitterness. Smooth and slightly creamy texture with a bit of stickiness. Definitely worth trying, this is much more interesting and flavourful than the draft Guinness you find in everywhere. Thanks Viggo."
"Still on the hunt for the Lagos stuff, but ready to be disillusioned, or at least, understand that it's probably just as good, if not so terribly much better, than this one."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a damn fine stout. If only American Guinness was like this, we'd all be in heaven. I picked this up in Bermuda while on a cruise. They had no good brews on the ship, so I was stuck drinking Newcastle. After I managed to smuggle this one on board, and drink it, I was in absolute heaven. Going from 3 days of Newcastle to this, I'd have to say it was the perfect beer for the moment. Simply stunning."
"Pours very dark light coffee with very little head. The beer has little color due to its dark color. Its smells great like roaster malts and coffee notes. The taste was what sold me again I could taste roasted malts with hints of coffee and chocalate. Very full bodied and slightly chewy in a way. Its felt great going down and was very drinkable. One of my favorites."
"I picked this up at a gas station in Negril, Jamaica. Light aroma, sweet cocoa, almost tangy. Dark tan head faded fast to a film. Opaque black colored beer. Burnt malt flavor, a bit of cocoa, and a strange cigarette butt flavor towards the end. Moderately dry and bitter finish. Moderately light body. I don't like the flavor towards the end, the harsh bitter ashy flavor is unappealing. Give me a Dragon Stout."
"Not an earth-shattering experience. Although the first time I had this a few years ago, it opened my eyes to what a stout could be. Very much worth looking for when you are on a cruise."
"275 ml bottle. Best before October 2005. Label says ""Brewed under license in Barbados by Banks Barbados Brewery, Ltd."" I wonder how FES from Guinness is when it comes from the UK. Thanks to Ninjaworm!"
"M&D: overall, the mouthfeel runs from smooth beginning to dryish ending, against the fullsome flavour and full body. It's a very nice stout for beer-tasting or even as a digestif, but not something I would drink for more than one bottle."
"Pours a black brown, with small tan head. Smells fruity, bit of roastiness too. The taste is bitter and roasty, with the taste of dark fruits, figs dates that sort of thing. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth although a bit on the thin side, however this is a beer that everyone should try, especially in the caribbean."
"The Islands' version. A good stout, though there are many better ones. Night and day to the Guiness draft beers being sent here domestically. Very Bitter, fruity, creamy, roasty and burnt parts. Black, cocoa powder, malts. Thin-medium bitter finish. Drinkable. Thanks Viggio."
"Regardless of the poor drinkability factor, have one sometime. If you're into dark stouts, you'll totally dig this one."
"Pours pitch black with a considerable tan head with good retention. Some hints of caramel in the nose, but mostly roasted malt, hints of chocolate and some alcohol as well. Lovely roasted bitterness in the taste backed up with some stronger chocolate notes and a slight warming alcohol finish. Nice mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. This is far and above the normal Guinness in every way. It's refreshing to see something good from the people who've just brought us Extra Cold stouts...Quite enjoyable."
"Poured from a 320mL can whilst in Malaysia 12/04. Nearly jet black, w/ a trace deep garnet fringe when held to light. Mountainous, stiff rocky head leaves frothy lace. In aroma, bitter backer's cocoa with metallic undertones dominate. Hints of molasses and burnt toast. In flavor, sharp roasted barley bitterness upfront leads into burnt toffee and woody sweetness. Assertive, drying hop bitterness. Oily, dark chocolate notes surface as the beer warms. Medium bodied and dangerously dry, yet pleasantly viscous in mouthfeel. Finishes with fleeting hints of licorice, dry cocoa and prune, but otherwise clean and thirst quenching. Truly a dry stout on steroids and a welcome find here in Malaysia. Perhaps the bottled version is even better? My can notes the ABV is 8.0%."
"This stout poured an opaque black color with creamy, tall, brown foam that persisted for a long time and clung to the glass a bit as it settled. The smell was dark, roasty malt. The taste was somewhat sweet and malty with a touch of tangy mollasses, and a hint of sweet fruitiness in the background, and some bitter hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and fairly dry overall with full body and moderate carbonation. This was a very thick and chewy stout, and was not a beer to be consumed quickly."
"Other comments: Not sure if this is different from the special Guinness that is made for Belgium (despite the 0.5% alcohol difference). In any case, it's just as yummy if not more so!"
"Two cold beauties last nite after seeing the ol Ladys charges on the MasterCard bill. Nice, foamy head, good lacing, and a deep charcoal malt aroma / flavor with a finishing hop kick. Seems to have just a smidgen more punch than regular Guinness draft, probably from the extra carbination. Great drinkablity, smooth, with a short afterburn. - wish I had more than 2 in the fridge. Ol blister took a drink and almost gagged, but shes a BMC lite drinker, so what else is new?"
"It is excellent with hot and spicy foods."
"Rich sweet malt smell. Big, big initial light tan head. Initial taste of a strong bite of abv and black malt. The brew then sweetens on the tongue with a milk like feel. The finish is one of a slightly sour malt dryness. Dark black opeque look in the pint glass. Lasting rocky lacing head. Good mouth and body to the brew. The beer is solid but does not knock my socks off."
"A great stout"
"The beer pour the traditional atramentous Guinness color, the head monsterous and a creamy chocolate brown, with the lace sticky and thick Nose is coffee, bittersweet chocolate, nice malt aroma, what a treat for the old schnozzles. Start is lightly sweet, nice malt with the top middling to full n feel, modest in its acidity, the hops pleasing in their spiciness, quite dry, and a treat thats not too be missed for you stout lovers."
"Shiny black in hue, there is a slight ruby hint around the edges, especially when held to a light. Impressive color. A foamy beige head donned the top of the beer; it was a finger in height at the apex. The head retention was good, after a few moments it subsided to a loose, foamy cap. Subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well. Still, the appearance of this stout is near faultless. The nose isnt very talkative; I get suggestions of roast, some char as well. In the way back is a hint of soft, caramel and toffee. The bouquet is disappointing; there really isnt much to it. It is not inviting because there is so little aroma. Apathetic. The palate is much improved. This is unlike any other Guinness Ive had. First of all, I can taste alcohol and it is warm and yummy. My bottle proclaims, 6.5% abv. As expected there is a fair amount of roasty flavors that produce notes of coffee and char. Pleasant. Towards the finish is a lovely toffee, caramel flavor. Then an astringent bitterness kicks in and lasts into the aftertaste. I really like the whole package here; there is heat and roast with hints of caramel and bitterness. This is a very good (Export) Stout; the complexities are apparent and welcomed. It is tasty! The body is a little fuller than medium, it is ideally heavy while not being sluggish, the carbonation is moderately low but appropriate. The mouthfeel is good, better than ordinary. Damn good stuff here. My dear Uncle Allen bought me a dainty bottle of FES on a recent cruise while docked at Ocho Rios, Jamaica. It set him back $8 at a tourist trap liquor store. That is way too pricey for this beer, still I am very grateful for the opportunity to quaff this famous Guinness product. Thanks Allen!"
"Wow, Guinness can make a good beer. What a surprise."
"Medium-full bodied."
"The beer poured black with aurburn tints at the edges, but had an ugly soap bubbly head. There was a moderate burnt aroma. On sipping, the beer had a strong burnt taste. Emphasis on strong. Not much hop presence. Flavor fades to a mild sourness that became strong and lingering as I got to the bottom of the beer and it warmed up. Flaw of beer storage or beer design? In any case, it was creamy and smooth with a medium to full body, and these were huge pluses. The alcohol level is subtle. Overall I would try this again in the hopes that the sourness was an abberration. I would definitely keep this beer cold and drink it cold though. Easily the best beer I had in the Caribbean."
"The sun must be getting to me--put me in a cold climate and I'd love this, but I'm just not feeling it in the islands. Still, I think it's really, really good."
"The mouthfeel of this brew is at once syrupy creamy and grainy. And Thick!, its like Guinness concentrate. It actually coats your mouth. It hides its 7.5 ABV remarkably well making it deceptively easy to drink. A perfectly balanced brew. The pinnacle of the stout maker's art."
"Notes: Although, not the strongest beer in the Guinness line-up (that would be the one for Belgian export at 8%), this is a full strength lovely beer."
"This is a lovely beer. It pours a very dark almost black brew with a thick tan head. It has a big smell, a fruity smell and with a hint of coffee and licorice. The taste is roasted and very bitter. You also taste coffe, caramel and some dark chocolate. It is pretty strong but you can't taste the alcohol. This beer leaves you with a long plesant aftertaste. This is one of my favourite beers"
"It should be noted that my bottle of FES was about a ""foreign"" as it could possibly be. It was brewed and bottled in Champs Fleurs, Trinidad, in the Carib Brewing Co. complex. Therefore, one might think my marks a bit harsh for Guinness, but the Irish had barely a hand in brewing this beer. To say nothing of how long it might have sat in storage before it was served to me."
"Robbeer pulled this out of his bag of tricks on the way back to London from the Twickenham beer festival. This stuff was great. An opaque black colour with a nice tan head. The aromas are of sweet creamy chocolate, caramel, dark roasted malts, and coffee. The taste is boozy, coffee-like, chocolate-y, and malty. The mouthfeel is thick, but not too much and the drinkability is great!"
"Pours thick and black, with a thin tan head which retains very well. Lace trails the glass as with Guinness draught, but does not have that signature perfect appearance, obviously. This may be one of the blackest beers I have encountered. ""Burnt"" is the best way to describe the nose...melted chocolate and burnt bread. Mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy and smooth, with nary a trace of much carbonation. Flavors of smoke, chocolate, coffee, and toasted malts add to the mild hop profile. This is quite a hearty stout, one I would love to pair with a tasty meat dish. If you venture out of the States, try to find this beer. Good stuff."
"This is nice beer, worthy of the famed Guinness branding. Dark and rich brown color with a thick tan head and loads of lacing. The taste and smell reveal coffee, toffee, and chocolate. The mouthfeel is a creamy and smooth delight. As rich and laid back as the Bermudan culture in which I experienced it."
"I also had tried this on a past trip to the Caribbean. Thick and frothy. Head pours heavy and disappates down to a little less than a pinky wide. Alcohol taste is apparent but definetly not a detriment. Chocolatey and Coffee tasting like many dark stouts but has a strong element of molasses flavor as well. Has that always great guinness mouthfeel-heavier but not that heavy on the palate, silky on the throat, and creamy feel on the tongue. Was a shame I had this on a beach and not in a comfy chair at home. Would have enjoyed it more; its an awesome brew none-the-less."
"Purchased and reviewed in Tortola, British Virgin Islands."
