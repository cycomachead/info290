"Pours pretty much black, dirty dark brown head. Moderate lacing, and light retention. Nose has a beautiful coffee bouquet, creamy, vanilla and medium roast coffee. Some coffee cake/bread, mild hazelnut, good sweetness over a gentle roast. Almost smells like snickerdoodle cookies a bit. Very nice here. Taste is a bit lighter, but still fantastic coffee flavours. Lightly roasty, nutty, creamy and mild bitterness. Touch of tartness. Medium light feel, and relatively low carbonation. Really nice coffee stout, one of the better ones in recent memory."

"O: I am really impressed by this beer; one of my favorites from them; really a solid roasty coffee stout"

"M: Full bodied stout."
"More delicious coffee in the taste, along with roasted barley malt, chocolate. Some sense of dried dark fruits, not cherries. Slight sweetness is cut, and the finish is nice and dry. Good carbonation and a medium body, creamy mouthfeel. Coffee bean bitterness lingers into the long, dry finish. If you like coffee, you'll like this. It's not cherry flavored."
"Pours near-black with a thin light tan head that quickly subsides into a thin collar without leaving more than a spot or two of lace behind. The nose has a slight cherry presence along with a good dose of coffee and roast. Flavor has a nice combination of cherry and roast, finishing with some dark chocolate. Body is medium to a slightly-dry finish. Pretty good."

"Maybe more creamer-like qualities and a bigger body would have helped me enjoy this offering more. As it stands, it is a serviceable beer, but not one I will be pining for again."

"O= This is a great coffee stout from the Brau Bros. I may be close to my last bottle on this one and I'm likely gonna pick up more. This was a homerun in my opinion if your looking for coffee. As far as coffee flavor goes I would say this rivals the coveted Coffee Bender."
""
"Overall: A very solid take on a coffee stout. The cherry flavor blends in very well with the coffee and dark malts."
""
"Overall, this was the best thing to ever come out of lucan. This beer was pretty solid and enjoyable. I haven't had much that I have enjoyed from Brau, but this was tasty. A little too roasty, but other than that it was good."
""
"Overall: A decent enough stab at the style though there is not enough coffee and the acidity is problematic"

"O - An enjoyable coffee stout. Not as complex or creamy as my favorite coffee stouts, but I enjoyed this."
"Not the best coffee beer on the shelves but there are definately many a lot worse. Probably will not replace Redband Stout as an affordable coffee beer."
"Overall a beer that looks and smells great, then kind of wanes. A bit jagged and disconnected, but does have quality framework. I'm glad I tried it, and only bought a single ($3)."
"O: I'm rather disappointed in this beer. Surly coffee bender or bell's java stout both annihilate this. It's not even close. The coffee is way too bland to be called a coffee stout. It's not an entirely gross beer, but there are 1,000 other stouts I would rather have. I do not recommend this beer if coffee bender is an option."

"I like to say all the best things to drink are brewed; Teas, Coffee, and Beer. Coffee Beers are a great combination of two great beverages. Brau Bros has a solid rendition of this, compared to the Breakfast Stout I had days ago, I feel the Bros missed the stout mark. It was more like a Coffee Bender with a bit higher ABV."
"Only flaw for me is, it could be fuller bodied. A bit more thickness would go a long way. Ain't nothing wrong with it, it just has a little bit to go."
""
"Finally, finally, I have had a beer from Brau that I enjoyed. I am still not sure about the earthy, soily taste in the beer, but I would buy Cherry Bean Coffee Stout again."
"This beer pours a dark brown, nearly black color. The head is one inch of light tan foam, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is nice balance of roasted malt, graham cracker, coffee, and hints of chocolate. No one aspect of the aroma stands out as overpowering any other aspect which creates some nice complexity. The taste is similar to the aroma with the coffee coming through slightly stronger, but still not over powering any of the other flavors. The mouthfeel is slightly fuller than medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a really good coffee stout that I will be drinking a lot of."

"O- Need more coffee... a little disappointing."

"Very impressed by this brew as I am with all from Brau. Very smooth and too easy to drink as it has no booziness at all. Highly recommend and I will be making a trip to Taylors to pickup six of these real soon!"
"This is definitely a beer that highlights coffee well. Drinks very well also. I think I would like this beer better if the malt and sweetness were bumped up a hair. As it stands though, this is a very well done coffee beer."
