3.68,6.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/5/2012. Pours clear nearly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, toffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and moderate fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Foreign stout style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and moderate fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 10, 2014"

3.6,4.3,4.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.25,"On the nose, the beer smells of stale, dark breads, touches of milk chocolate, instant coffee, and bakers chocolate. Low amounts of diacetyl seem to be present as well with a light, buttered popcorn character. Touches of spicy licorice occasionally brush against the nostrils, but they are light. On the tongue, the beer tastes bready sweet, with a mild bitter roast, touches of coffee-like acidity, and the briefest of alcoholic pops just at the close. Hop bitterness builds as you sip the beer, and eventually hits slightly unbalanced levels. The finish is drier with a mild bitter roast. In flavor, the beer begins as softly chary coffee, moving into roast grains and toasted bread. The middle and finish carry lots of herbal and medicinal bitters that hurt other flavors in the beer. Touches of licorice, bakers chocolate, and caramel touch across the tongue, but are kept light due to the mildly aggressive bitter flavoring that mingles with slight char flavors. In the mouth, the beer feels on the heavier side of medium in body, with a middling, soft carbonation, and a slightly watery, smooth, and almost-creamy mouthfeel. The bitters give the mouth a slightly sharp feeling, which is off with the rest of the beer. Overall, this is an average Export Stout that suffers from a bad blending of its bitters with the other rich flavors of the beer. It is not overly bitter by any means, but just feels a touch too bitter for the style. For a “Dark Holiday Stout,” I was also expecting more rich malt character, but it was fairly mellow with it malt character. This beer is not horrible, but is rather forgettable in the grand scheme of things. I liked it more as I drank more of it. It hides its 8% nicely. I would advise serving this at room temperature.","Maxwell","Dec 11, 2013"

Leaves behind some patches of foam and some nice lacing. Smell is awfully mundane. Sweet milk chocolate, faint vanilla, bitter roasted malts and not much else. Taste follows the nose with the addition of smoke smoke and a plasticy finish. Like a muted rauchbier with some artificial vanilla. Why is it so roasty? The saving grace here is the mouth feel which is full and creamy. Not a big fan of this one. The light smokey thing it has going on is less than welcome in my opinion.","davey101","Apr 17, 2013"

2.36,-31.6,4,3,2,2,2,"Overall: The idea of a Christmas stout is interesting, but this brew doesn’t live up to expectations…it’s got the makings of a holiday ale or lager, but there is plenty left to be desired, like a thicker disposition…while it is warming my belly, I think most of that is from the higher ABV and not necessarily the cinnamon and clove…the spices are not crisp, leaving a slightly heavy, overdone taste in my mouth…I’ll finish this one, but don’t think I’ll be looking for another…there are better choices for a holiday brew…(2/5)","SerialHiker","Dec 15, 2012"

Right in the middle of an imperial and a regular stout, there is plenty of chocolaty sweetness with a fair amount of roast and alcohol. Mild fruit contributes more of a complexity aspect than a straight up fruit flavor. Carbonation level is a bit high and the mouthfeel is a touch thin, but I am liking this slightly aged version better than the fresh one I had a year and a half ago. Mouthfeel is a bit 'wet' and lingers on far too long in a licorice type of profile. Some sourness comes out upon warming and is distracting. There is plenty not to like here, there are much better Export Stout style beers out there. See Buried Hatchet and Left Hand FTB 1.

It has a strong roasty presence with toffee notes, dark chocolate, cocoa and a hint of coffee on the back, with a touch of alcoholic heat that numbs the palate just a bit. As it warms, more specific notes of plum and prune as well as fresh tobacco show up. The flavor progression I found went from roasty malt to dark fruit then to a cocoa/bitter chocolate finish.

Rich and chocolate-like (strong, but somewhat mild at the same time), but still bears strong stout characteristics. More even and smooth than I would have expected.

The aroma has coffee up front with notes of chocolate and vanilla, but nothing stands out too much. There is a nice alcohol burn at the end and some nice chocolate and roasted coffee as well. This is way too carbonated for a stout in my estimation - more creaminess would be welcomed here. This is by no means a bad beer, there is some good sweetness and it could be served as a dessert.

The mouthfeel is silky & surprisingly thinner than I would expect for a stout. Closer to a porter, really! The drinkability is good, although the dry finish limits it. If you like Imperial stouts or Milk stouts, this one is not a bad one to try. Probably best to just let one of your "I know he likes beer, so..." relatives give this to you in the gift pack, though.

Chewy, biscuity, viscous mouthfeel. Nice yet light carbonation. It's very difficult to detect much in the way of aroma. Again, hints of coffee but that's about it.

Smells of rum raisins, light chocolate, toasted malt, hints of vanilla, coffee and maybe a tinge of smokiness. Taste starts with a round dark malt and shapes into the chocolate character, which comes toward the end of the midsections. The hops only really manifest themselves in a mild bitterness that helps to balance the more robust character of this drink. Funny enough something about the flavor of this reminds me of drinking a coke soda. The mouthfeel on this is a bit on the lighter side rather clean and with a dry finish. Honestly this is not a bad beer, but its not that interesting.

Flavors are again dominated by black roasted malts with a follow up of toasted malts, light cocoa, and light coffee. An underlying sweetness boarders on lactose and / or oats. Accompanying this sweetness is a velvety, almost oily texture that mellows the beer and rounds off the rough alcohol edges.
