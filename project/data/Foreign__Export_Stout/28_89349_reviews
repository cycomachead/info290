"Rich and roasty with minimal hop presence. An above average stout."
""
"One two three four five"
"Luscious in taste, but curiously drinkable in body, its off-full texture is light, dry and arid due to elevated alcohol, acrid roasted nature, and further drying to exacerbate the coffee-like textures. A strong linger of coffee, cocoa and smoldering embers extend well into the next sip and keep the palate satisfied and relaxed."

"Poured from a bottle into a schooner, the beer is jet black, with a low profile, bubbly, dark tan head. Aromas of bitter roasted coffee, bittersweet baker's chocolate, hints of smoke, peat, wood and earthy highlights, and a note of tangy cream sweetness. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with the coffee bitterness all over the forward tongue, followed by a solid bittersweet cocoa nib character, hints of old world fruit sweetness, and a char/smoke highlight. The body is robust and smooth, almost chewy, with a very dry undertone that carries straight through to the dry finish. The aftertaste is more of the coffee and chocolate bittersweet blend. Very solid offering in the Export style."
"i have always loved the dark stuff these guys do, and this one takes it to the next level for me, so smooth and velvety in feel, almost like a milk stout, except for how dry it is, really impressive there. muted black in the glass, solid tan head on the pour but it doesnt hold long. i smell very dark unmalted barley roast, and meadow honey with english ale yeast, a super cool combination of aromas, and i think true to but evolving the export stout style, which we need more of in the american market anyway. i do get some honey flavor without sweetness in the middle, with an almost ashy barley char on either end of it. you would almost think this was oaked. it has mellow coffee and cocoa notes, but stays on the lighter side of that, aside from the barley bitterness. complex and bold, but just silk going down, i think the feel is my favorite part. i could easily do a four pack of these in a sitting, its unique enough to warrant contemplation, but familiar and drinkable enough to drink hard on. i think anchor has been one of the masters of that phenomenon, and this is the best new beer i have had from them in moons. absolutely worth picking up, especially if you are as big a fan of anchor as i am."

"Wish the bitterness were less prevalent, and that the acrid character weren't present. Think the black malt character is overdone. Alcohol is definitely noted."
"I'm going to miss this one when it's gone. Anchor yeast smell, choclatey roastiness, chewy texture and medium to dry finish. Does Anchor do bold? They certainly do bold with this one."

"A well-made export stout. The bready chocolate aroma (really, it smells like cake and coffee) is followed by a fruitier character with dark, ripe berry notes and a roasted finish. This covers a lot of ground and it doesn't feel too heavy, give it a shot."

"Uninspired and uninteresting.  Reminded me of seltzer."

"O: I can't get enough of this beer - is this keg really around a year old?!... a thick, hearty stout with a huge malty flavor - straight-up slightly over-baked, homemade chocolate chip cookie... love this!"

"O â€“Very nice, was on the menu as a ""Cappuccino Stout"" and I'd say it fit the bill, nice espresso notes, and a nice dry finish. Great beer."

"Few stouts out there can approach this one's quality. If you can find this brew, try it....seriously!"

"On tap at 2 Brothers. Pours a rich black color with half an inch of medium brown head. Minimal lacing. The aroma is earthy with some chocolate , vanilla, and caramel. The taste is of roasted malts, sweet chocolate and caramel. Earth and some dark fruit notes. Hints of smoke. Light, velvety mouthfeel. Roasted malts and some chocolate at the finish. Very little alcohol presence. Overall, a damn fine export stout worth having again."

"I suppose, in an absolute sense, there are probably better stouts out there. But in terms of true drinkability, where abv and price are issues, this is pretty close to perfection."

"A really nice and solid stout."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Black body, light beige head, moderate retention, mostly clear lacing. Aroma includes coffee, roasted malt, touch of chocolate and vanilla. Taste follows suit, nice bitter chocolate aftertaste and pretty nice delivery of flavors. Tasty and easy to drink with a little extra alcohol. Good to see Anchor stepping outside the box."
"Had this one on tap at Eli Cannon's in Middletown. Very good - hope that Anchor considers putting this beer into a permanent rotation. Very smooth, dark color and overall a very drinkable stout. Drinks a lot smoother than the ABV would suggest. Would drink again!"
"Tap: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a medium size dark brown foamy head with good retention. Aroma of black chocolate with some residual sugar and light dry roasted malt notes. Taste is also dominated by black chocolate notes with some residual sugar (lactose?) and some dry roasted malt. Body has a creamy texture with good carbonation and a medium full body. Very enjoyable and well brewed overall."

"overall, a decent brew. could have a few of these in succession, but thicker, darker, harder than a the other brews to breed a continuity. but a very decent product."
"This was a nice beer. It was rich and had good drinkability. My only complaint was the sweet graininess that came through. Otherwise, this was a nice stout that is worth a try."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and cookie dough. Taste is much the same with vanilla and cocoa powder flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell and tasty flavors. Definitely the best of the Zymaster series so far in my opinion."

"Pretty close to black crowned with a rock solid, tight, beige head. Smells of caramel, bread, and cocoa roastiness. Roasted malt flavor...caramel, chocolate, and some dark fruity esters. Medium-plus body with a nice, soft creaminess. Pretty good stout that drinks lighter than it's 7.5%."

"Anchor knocked it out of the park with this one. Hope to see it join their line-up of regulars someday."
