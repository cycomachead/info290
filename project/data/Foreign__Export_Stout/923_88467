4.21,7.4,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured into a Stone flute. Pours nearly black with a fine one finger dark khaki head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of dark chocolate, toasted malt, plums, hint of coffee and oak. Flavor of charred dark malt, dark chocolate, coffee, woody oak, a hint of dark fruit; finishes with more charry malt, light hop bitterness and coffee. Medium bodied with good carbonation and mouth feel. A richly flavored, charred malt stout with light barrel character and a deftly handled fruit component. It tasted like plum juice, but must be from the dark grapes. Deceptively straightforward at first taste, but develops a nice range of complex fruit and toasted malt character. This was very good, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I look forward to trying other beers from this brewery. Nicely done.","LiquidAmber","Feb 26, 2015"

Aromas of roast, cream, peat, earth, wood, and subtle char. Very well blended and balanced aromas. Flavors are roast and creamy forward, with a tart and sweet grape note ribboning throughout. Very unique and balanced. Subtle chocolate notes in the background, with hints of smoke and char throughout. Touches of bitter coffee, too. Smooth and robust in mouth, with a bitter and roasted aftertaste of baker's chocolate and booze. The finish is smooth, with a subtle bitter and rich linger. This is a big beer, and a very unique twist on the style. Tasty.","GarthDanielson","Mar 05, 2014"

Instead, what's left is an above-average stout that you wouldn't know saw any time in a barrel. Ska's hoppier, less malty offerings are definitely more where it's at.","Immortale25","Feb 13, 2014"

4.28,9.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.25,"The Crack was followed by an inverted Glug which produced both a pseudo-cascading action as well as two-plus fingers of dense, deep-tan head with great retention. As the head began to fall, lacing began to form almost immediately. In pouring it, I could see that the color was a purplish-brown, like a really bad bruise. once in the glass, however, it was allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose smelled of raisins and chocolate and I was instantly reminded of a Cadbury Fruit & Nut chocolate bar! Wild. Mouthfeel was medium and I am going to go out on a limb here and declare the taste as "vinous". Call me crazy ... All joking aside, the grapiness was immediately evident with a kind of sour/tart flavor, followed by a smoky chocolatiness.The finish was semi-dry and I was reminded of the homemade wine that my uncle makes, especially the Zinfandel in 1989. Wow! What won't they think of next? This was totally unexpected and quite the drink. One would be plenty for me, but for the vino crowd, this could be a bridge.","woodychandler","Jun 23, 2013"

Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight grape, hint of coffee, and slight hop. Overall, good appearance, and decent aroma, body, and feel.","Tone","Feb 28, 2013"

4.07,3.8,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4.25,"Another intriguing canned stout from Ska... lets give it a try. Poured into snifter. Pour is black, medium visual weight with a collar of tan head. Moderate amount of lacing left behind The nose has that nice roasty foreign stout character that emphasizes roasted barley and black patent. The malbec grape character integrates nicely with the sweet malt components of the aroma. A bit of oak is present as well which gives off a somewhat dry aroma. The taste starts with grape sweetness that presents itself delicately. I was concerned that this brew would be a sweet mess given the ingredients. The grape lends nicely to the sturdy roast of the base, very nice balance. Notes of chocolate, coffee, and oak come through with hints of white grape juice throughout. The grape quality makes one last appearance on the finish. mouthfeel is somewhat thin with moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer is very unique and well executed. At 10.99 a six pack, it also offers a good value. Worth a try!","homebrew311","Feb 10, 2013"

I'm not sure what the malbec grapes added to this little beauty, but but all the other ingredients sure come together wonderfully. If a big, roast-y "meal-in-a-can" stout is what you're after, this one easily fits the bill.","beergoot","Feb 07, 2013"

3.89,-0.8,4,3.75,4,3.5,4,"Drinkin' a beer with Malbec grapes, watching a documentary that mentions Baalbek. Nice. Anyway, this stuff pours a murky black-brown topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dusty cocoa powder, light oak, and a vague sense of flavored alcohol, as though I sniffed a Solo cup left over from some random college party where they were drinking who-knows what in these cheap-ass vessels. The taste rings with a sharp red wine grape covered in cocoa and mild coffee. Hints of vanilla bean and oak dart in and out at various points. Though a bit of booziness pervades, it doesn't wholly interfere with things, rather opting to occasionally create a sense of cough syrup every now and again. Somehow, this jumble works. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate (verging on moderate) carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a nice stout, one that blends the wine grapes well with the roasty surroundings.","TMoney2591","Jan 31, 2013"
4.08,4.1,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"D - I liked this quite a bit and I'd be willing to pick up a 4-pack to see how it compares out of the can. Interesting and unique beer; I dug their Merlot stout and this was in a similar vein. I can imagine this might be a bit polarizing, but it worked for my palate. Happily consumed 12oz and could drink a couple in an evening.","MasterSki","Jan 29, 2013"
4.05,3.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The Hiberdal Vinifera Stout is good. The stout poured an opaque dark in my sniffer. There is a thin tan head which is leaving some lace. The scent is bolstered by espresso with touches subtle hints of red wine. The taste is starts with a typical stout, roasts, earthy, espresso, etc. Then the finish has a dark fruit/black cherry tones. The Malbec presence becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is full bodied with smooth carbonation. Overall it is a very interesting stout and a perfect winter warmer.","WoodBrew","Jan 29, 2013"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"12oz can purchased for $2 I think, made sure to buy a single because I bought a sixer of the last cocoa stout ska did and was unhappy. Dark black color, nice head, good stout appearance. nice roasted stout smell, sort of rich, nice. Flavor was more rich stout, hints of cocoa, not a trace of grapes that my palate could detect. I could also not detect any oak but I wasn't let down because it was still a tasty stout.","ArrogantB","Jan 01, 2013"
3.53,-9.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"a real strange installment of the stout series. aged in oak with malbec grape juice added. the pour looks alright, jet black and thicker, with an inch of tan head with nice retention. maybe im seeing what i want to see here, but there appears to be a faint purple color to it when held to the light. the smell is of a sweet stout, maybe not quite a milk stout, but there is plenty of residual sugar in this one, as well as a sturdy but not too black roasty malt base. the grape juice can hardly be smelled or tasted. it just tastes like a sweet stout to me, i dont even get much oak. i get a hint of grapey acidity towards the end, but thats about it. its got a strange aftertaste of fruit, which i think clashes with the large dark malt profile rather than adding anything desirable. full body and a very funny feeling beer in the stomach. im glad i got a single instead of a 6pack, as this is not as easy beer to put down. i dont dislike it, but i dont think it came together quite the way it was intended to. maybe more time in oak would bring the flavors together in a more congruent way, or maybe they should just scrap this and go back to the mole stout, because that was darn good.","StonedTrippin","Jan 01, 2013"

4.08,4.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"O - overall, this is a really tasty beer that hits on multiple flavor notes without seeming like it's trying too hard; the grape/oak/coffee stout is surprisingly balanced and extremely tasty; at 8%, these flavors hide the alcohol entirely: I could session this badboy!","SkeeterBoganski","Dec 30, 2012"
3.8,-3.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O - Very tasty. I suspect the grape juice might have helped with the sweetness that i tasted that complemented the coffee notes.

They teased about info about the beer but I followed every link I could and couldn't find anything about it.","JMBSH","Dec 28, 2012"
