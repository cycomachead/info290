3.92,15.3,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Poured from the bottle into Furstenberg glassware that I got from the brewery 34 years ago!  This is my first taste of this beer since the late 80's, as it has not been available in the US since then (I got this beer from Quebec). Frothy browny head, very thick as I remember it being.  The body of the beer is also dark, but a bit on the amber brown side. The first sip brought back memories of my time in the Black Forest of Germany, where the brewery is located - malty sweetness, slight banana flavor, wheat bread on the backside. A deeelicious brew that I wish I could get more ofter!","rorjets","Jan 15, 2015"

3.64,7.1,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"FWHD is pretty much on par for this type of beer. It's medium brown in colour, with a light head that lasts a while but leaves zero lacing. Rather than bananas, I smell cherry in this one - in addition to the expected wheat aromas. Its wheat character is quite strong in the taste, highlighted by the fruity tastes (a little sour cherry and plum). Its fine carbonation and dry finish make it feel very good going down. Good stuff!","Intrinsic","Nov 23, 2011"

3.23,-5,4,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Taste is spicy again without the stronger yeast products of clove and banana. Wheat is apparent and the caramel adds a slight astringent taste. Aftertaste is dry and caramellic, body is thin. Drinkability was not great, I seem to miss the yeast complexity and a bit bite.","Absumaster","Apr 17, 2007"
2.31,-32.1,3,2,2,2.5,3,"Overall: I am a big fan of weizen beers and this one is simply just acceptable. It is not horrible but it is far from great either.","AlexLMS","Apr 04, 2007"

2.1,-38.2,4,1.5,2,3,2,"Pours a hazy red/orange, thick white head forms, nice lacing and retention, looks okay. Smell is bad, vegetables, caramel, some wheat, butter, citrus, generally unpleasant. Taste is the same, iron, some roast and chocolate, veggies, citrus, yeast, wheaty, bit of banana and clove, again generally unpleasant. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, thanks a lot Jan!","Viggo","Feb 02, 2007"

2.53,-25.6,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Bottle: Poured a dark brownish color dunkel with a big bubbly head with better then average retention. Aroma of cloves and banana is very weak with some sweet malt also noticeable. Taste of banana and cloves are again too subtle for the style IMO with a very light body. I guess this one is average at best but clearly not something I would seek again.","Phyl21ca","Sep 28, 2004"

3.13,-7.9,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Cloudy copper hue, big well-laced off-white head lasts long. Interesting yeasty nose comes out peppery, bready with notes of lime and banana. Light taste reminds of banana muffin and/or caramel cookies. Soft body with immense carbonation. Pretty decent in its style, but I'm not huge on wheat beers in general.","Rastacouere","Beers"
4.2,23.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Deep amber sporting highlights of gold-flecked orange under a puffy khaki top. Clove spice dominates fruity nut bread in both aroma and flavor with hints of chocolate and cinnamon back. A bit too thin and spritzy. Not quite as deep and good as my favorite Bavarian Dunkelweiss but tasty in it's own South German way. Try it with pommes und mayonnaise while listening to techno.","inebrius","0"
