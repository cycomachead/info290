"Roasted, nuttiness, caramel malty sweetness. Not as strong of a traditional flavor of a Dunkel. It was a little thinner but easy to drink. The Walnuts worked very well. A tasty and inviting treat. Easy to drink. Not one dimensional but not too complex ether. Just enough to figure it out by the end of the bottle. I hope to get this one again!"

"A nice look and aroma leads up to great expectations but a rather odd flavor and rather watery and rough mouthfeel greatly detract from the whole. Perhaps it's the black walnuts that contribute to the weird taste experience and the rather acidic and phenolic character. A hint of a hefeweizen styling and a bit of a nutty character barely pokes through the fruit and sour notes yet can't pull this brew together in the end. Interesting but not necessarily all that great..."

"Picked this up because it was on clearance at Riverside Liquors in Frederick. I figured it was interesting enough to be worth a try. Good looking beer but had a weird fizz when poured, almost like a soda instead of a beer. Fizzy head also dissipated quickly, had me a little worried. But the smell was excellent, very interesting, The taste was also interesting, and very good, but not awesome. But feels a little light, and again, kinda fizzy. Overall while not a bad beer by any stretch, being interesting is the best thing it has going for it. While I enjoyed it I will not be swinging back by to grab any more of these despite the good price."

"O: rated on the fact I think it hits the style and the novelty of recipe. Have had this before and enjoyed it, this taste confirmed my like of the beer and the rating follows."

"i have always wanted nut browns to be more nutty, to actually taste like nuts, and a dark lager is just a fabulous format to finally find a beer that tastes like real nuts. a hazy dark brown beer with a short inch of tan head without a lot of retention. the beer appears quite thick for a lager, and there is some yeast sediment present. it smells amazing, like fresh roasted walnuts, or fresh baked dark chocolate walnut cookies, as it has a nice dark german grain complex in there too, and a hint of bakers chocolate from the roast. the walnuts are by far the dominant flavor, adding an earthy and semisweet protein complex, that has notes of vanilla and tree bark, as well as a general sweetness akin to fresh maple sap before its boiled down into syrup. its perfect for spring, sturdy enough for cold weather no doubt, but jovial enough to remind us all that we have almost made it through winter. how to describe the flavor of a walnut? thats very tough if youve never had a walnut personally, but i think this beer showcases that unique flavor brilliantly, while still being a really cool beer underneath. the lager yeast is bready and adds to that cookie feel, while the finish is pretty clean for its vanilla sugar sweetness throughout. fuller medium body and a smooth texture. maybe a little undercarbonated, but i like the way this sits in my mouth and stomach, extremely satisfying. a memorable brew, perennial is on a roll!"

"And that's the beauty in these classic styles- they carry so much variety in taste even though the beer may be lighter in alcohol and body than we're used to- but that's its charm. That's its intrigue, and that's its curiosity. Perennial Ales takes full advantage of true German Dunkel flavor but with their own American-ized surprise."

"The beer pours a hazy dark brown with a wispy off-white head that fades quickly and has some perimeter stickiness. The nose is walnut banana bread, but is more banana than walnut. The taste is bready sweetness upfront followed by a slightly bitter walnut skin and alcohol. The beer feels medium bodied with rich, nutty, malty sweetness, and a lingering bite that doesn't seem to sit heavy on the palate. This beer is quite drinkable and has a distinct and subtle walnut presence. I think this beer is definitely worth the bottle/growler price and I plan on getting more next week."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a deep, vibrant, amber-nut brown coloring with a tall, frothy, dense, bubbly, off-white head. Aromas of rich sweetness, roasted nut highlights, toffee, and earthy notes. Flavors of roast and tangy sweet forward, with toffee notes, roasted nutty highlights, cream highlights, and some chocolate notes. Pretty layered on the palate. Lighter bodied, but smooth, providing a crisp finish to a beer that is almost velvety and light in mouth. The aftertaste is more of the tangy sweet, with caramel and toffee blending together. Very flavorful and tasty beer."

"(O)- An interesting take on the style. The walnuts really kind of take over the overall profile of the beer and adds that extra layer to the dunkel. Just a shame that I would like to see the beer's base come through more which would help this remind me closer to a dunkel than it is; more brown ale-like to me."

"O - Nice seasonal... Should have came out when the leaves are falling on the trees."
""
""
""
"Overall - Bad. No one else thinks this is bad, but it's bad."
""
""
""
"Seems a bit off for the style, drinkable enough, but flawed. I will have to keep an eye on freshness dates with this brewery from here on, this 6 month old beer has not held up me thinks... I liked Piney River's take on this better by quite a bit"
""
""
"O: This beer doesn't taste like your average dunklweizen and seems a little reminiscent of a brown ale with its flavors of nutty malts. It is definitely very interesting."

"A wonderful dunkel. More on the light side with the fruit and nuttiness instead of the deep roast of the traditional German ones. Very drinkable."
"o - Overall I thought this sounded interesting and thought it worked really well. As you'd expect, there is a ton of walnut in the nose and taste, mixing nicely with the roasted and toasted malts. Worth checking out, would have it again."
""
""
""
"Good one, very drinkable and flavorful without a high abv."
""
""
""
"I'd drink this again but I feel it would be better suited for that evening when the leaves first start to fall off the trees"
""
""
"Side notes: it's better than the banana walnut bread I made this morning. My first intro to dunkelweizen and it won't be my last."

"Overall, a very tasty and inventive take on the German dunkelweizen. Certainly not traditional, but plenty good enough to be worth a go, even for German beer purists. I'd say Perennial's first foray into German styles is a pretty good success."

"O: A very fresh and flavorful seasonal offering from a new brewery (to me). I'll definitely be picking up more of their offerings, if I can find them."
""
"As a lover of the dunkelweiss style, I routinely keep a keg of Franziskaner dunkel in my beer cooler and many bottles of Ayinger Ur-weisse in my fridge. This is the first American craft version of dunkelweiss which rivals the Bavarian originals and even surpasses them in quality. A must try if you can find it and like the style. If only BWD was more readily available."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, creamy and smooth on the tongue. How do you effectively prevent boring people with a traditional style - evidently you walnut the crap out of it. I was into this but I could see some not enjoying it quite as much."
""
"Dark, almost cola like brown with haze, moderate tan tinted head. Scent brings lots of caramel with some notes of roasted nuts and grain, some dark fruit also present. Scent is quite bold with sweet malt the star and an adequate amount of roast, some earthy and grassy hops - strengthens at the end of the sip. Medium bodied, light in carbonation. Another decent beer from Perennial."

"Overall: A solid brew. In general, it is a pretty sweet beer but not in a cloying way. It is nicely balanced and interesting enough for me to want to finish the bottle."

"O- I was surprised by the light feel and flavor. I was expecting something chewey given appearance and smell."
"D - Enjoyed all the Perennial beers i have tried so far. Interesting twist on the style."

"Overall interesting, fairly tasty, wish it had a bit more of the walnuts, but otherwise fairly tasty and well done, and quite unique."
"O - Overall this was a cool beer glad I got to try it. Nice nuttiness. Quite nice and tasty, rather unique."
"Pours a dark brown with a two finger beige head. No visible lacing. A pleasing aroma with notes of banana, cocoa, subtle spice, and earthiness. Opens with subtle toffee and cocoa joined by nutty banana bread, and finishes smooth with mild earthiness. Lighter-side of medium bodied. The level of carbonation is perfect, pleasant, but not in a way that disrupts the silky, smooth mouthfeel. The black walnuts really add a new dimension to an excellent dunkelweizen base. Another excellent brew from Perennial. They have yet to disappoint."
"O - Liked this one alot. One of the most flavorful Dunkels I've had in a long time. Would have again."
"A well done dunkelweizen although I wish the flavor were nuttier. Not a style I have often so it was nice for a change up even if it isn't anything innovative."
"The beer pours a brown color with a tan head. The aroma is full of toffee and walnuts, two notes that really go well together in this case. The flavor is very similar. I get a lot of sweet toffee and brown sugar notes, with some walnuts and chocolate also thrown in. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very well done and very enjoyable."
"O: I was impressed by this one and would love to have it again. Recommended if you can get it."
"Nice to see another up and coming brewery available in Chicago. Poured into Goose Island wine glass. Appearance is somewhat murky and brown, minimal head upon pour with no retention. The nose features familiar notes of dunkelweizen, plenty of orange and coriander. The walnut comes through in subtle waves as it warms in the glass. Hints at molasses and brown sugar present as well. The taste is similar to the nose. Somewhat sweet up front with lots of ripe fruits and some spice. The walnut provides a delicate nutty finish, but definitely hangs in the background. The mouthfeel is thin with medium to high carbonation. Overall, this is a unique twist on the style. It seems that brews that add nuts are hit in mis as far as the nut presence is concerned. The walnut is evident, but it did take some time to discover. Overall, worth a try."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and toffee. Taste is the same with some mild nutty flavors and a slight tartness. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a better smell than taste in my opinion. The walnuts used in this one are pretty subtle too."

"O - This was surprisingly good. I was apprehensive about black walnuts in a dunkel, but it was really good."
""
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of wheat. Fits the style of a Dunkelweizen. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, slight alcohol, sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of sourness, and a hint of wheat. Overall, good appearance, body, and blend."
""
"O: An alright beer, overall, with some interesting flavors and aromas. Unfortunately they don't mesh very well, but it's still a drinkable beer."
"Pours deep brown, almost black. Smells sweet, with some caramel malts, sugary fruits, and a little nutty. Taste starts off with lots of caramel malts that move into darker fruits (grapes and plums). A little sweet nuttiness and sweet malt is on the finish. Really nice, rich flavor profile. Mouth is full bodies and smooth. Pretty solid dunkel. The walnut adds a nice layer of complexity to a pretty solid beer."
"Light to medium mouthfeel that is very drinkable. Another great beer from a local brewer. Looking forward to trying more from Perennial."

"Overall a pretty good refreshing and delicious dark brew."

"O - A wonderful Dunkel that was probably my favorite of the day at the brewery. The walnuts are at a perfect level in this beer and they really help balance the sweetness. Excellent stuff."
