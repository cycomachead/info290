"O - If is not that much carbonation in the taste,this could more then decent."

"A very pleasant light weight Dunkelweizen, refreshing and light on spices, but still quite malty."
""
"A pretty mediocre dunkelweizen, one that I won't be having again. Their hefeweizen is better though."

"It smell of nuts and fruits and great fresh wheat fields. Its taste is just as wonderful with even more malt along with the wheat and nutty fruits. It goes down smooth and leaves you wanting another every time. If you want a dark wheat this is one of the best."

"O: Not bad, but farm from the best!"
"A good allround hefe."
"Dr: Horribly priced, though in fairness I purchased it at an airport. But sweet bejaysus, lads, leave this one where it belongs - on the shelf."
"M thin to medium body. Carb was good.Â "

"Best thing about this beer is its appearance. Poured with a huge, foamy, frothy, thick, fluffy, cream colored head that lasts a long time and good lace. Color at first is a copper amber. Aroma is very mild with malt, a bit roasty, and yeast. Not much else. Flavor is like aroma and I wonder why they even bothered. Body and carbonatoin are ok. Finish is like flavor and short. Forgettable."
"pours a beautiful head of dough bread mass cloudy caramel color. nose is floral, mild pepper, citrus, and burnt coriander. palate of gritty burnt malt and coriander. dry as ever. mild wheat malt sweet, bitter green orange peel finish and wheat husk. Sharp... not particularly broad for a dunkelweiss... malt properties fall short. yet the dryness is quite appealing. a palate cleanser if anything."
"Notes: Fair dark weizen with a solid balance."
"Overall, a beatiful beer, I enjoyed it a lot."
"D- Not as drinkable as their regular hefe, but this one is still pretty good. Could make for a nice session beer."
"OVERALL: A no frills winner here. Very enjoyable and very drinkable, and at 5% ABV it would make a great session beer. One of the best I've had and I would definitely pick it up again. This is the second Schoefferhofer weizen I've had, and both of them have been top notch."
"Drinkability: a great clean session beer for any Hefeweizen lover. Went great with the paprika chips I bought with it."
"This is a very nice beer, I'd go so far as to say a standard for the style. Everything I want from a dark hefeweizen is in there."
"drinkability is not bad. a little watery, and a bit weak in character, but still a drinkable dunkel."
"Overall: I was expecting a little more body. Refreshing without the depth of a good dunkel weizen."
"Drinkability: A fantastic beer, with complex flavors that develop late and leave you wanting another glass just to sample them all again. A standout wheat malt and great hop balance. ABV and smoothness of the brew make it even easier to have another. An exceptional dunkel weizen."
"Everything about this beer was good, as I will endeavor to describe. The appearance was rusty brown, hazy, darker than other dunkel weizens I had and well appreciated by me. The aroma had the necessary bananas/cloves, but also included some other interesting fruits such as plum and raisin. It was actually a little ""porty"" in flavor, not really common for weizens but very nice. The taste was awesome, it contained all the fruits described in the aroma, just richly fruity and a little bready. The mouthfeel was thick and coating, and the drinkability was high, especially considering how filling the beer seemed. I highly recommend you take a stab at this if you see it, it was mighty nice."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fairly soft carbonation, but this isn't the easiest for me to drink with such an overwhelming presence of cloves."
"Taste is dry, banana bit of maltyness and a moderate to low bitterness however bit yeasty. Somehow missing the fullness of a good darkweizen and having a watery mouthfeel. Refreshing and easy drinkable for shure but bit mainstream and missing something."
"Pours a cloudy dark copper under a beige 1.5 finger head with good consistency and decent retention, but very few lace spots. There's a nice strong citrus and spice nose with just a hint of caramel to smooth things out. The mouth is light and very prickly. Mild, perhaps watery taste of yeast, yeast and more yeast. Cilantro is also here. The hps are very subdued, but leave a slight dryness late in the aftertaste. A nice solid brew, albeit unspectacular."
"This dunkel weizen poured a cloudy, coffe brown color with creamy tan foam that persisted. The smell was wheat, mild banana, and a touch of caramel. The taste was malty with hints of banana (banana cream pie) and caramel with notes of yeast and a tangy finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and slightly creamy with medium body and moderate carbonation. This was a nice and easy to drink dunkel hefeweizen."
"First impressions are much what you'd expect, hefe aroma of banana, a little hoppy, slight sweetness. But once it's in your mouth it is evident that the dark malt has added a caramel flavour that has overtaken what little banana flavour is there. Nice, but could do with more flavour."
"Quite nice, very quaffable. Sweetish, banana and chocolate flavour. Very, very smooth, and even a bit light. Still, theres enough, German wheat character (banana, clove) and dark malt character (choc/caramel) to keep you interested. Not the best dunkle weiss, but very solid by anyones standard. Not a bad drop."
"A good, spritzy dunkel weisse that makes up in refreshment what it lacks in depth. Murky copper-brown with fluffy head that doesn't last. Yeasty aroma with hints of pear and candy caramel. There is not much malt presence but it slowly asserts itself as the beer warms. Fruity, initially spiky, spritzy; a very wet, quenching finish. Smooth, easily drinkable, with a slight tint of metal deep down, the only off quality. While not as big and robust as some dunkel weisses, it's still very tasty."
