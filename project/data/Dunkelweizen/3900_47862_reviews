"Plenty of character here can easily lead to excess, and maybe it's just because I'm in the mood for a Dunkelweizen at the moment, but this one seems quite a bit underrated."

"Feel: light body; exceptionally smooth and creamy for a light bodied beer."

"on tap at the wonderful helgas, the best german food around. poured into a proper 1 liter glass, i could barely lift this hazy amber brew with one hand. classic banana clove yeast complexion on the nose, with the darker wheat malt, sweet and red, not quite roasty and dark like the midnight stuff, its classically german. the taste confirms what the nose hinted at, this is one of the best examples of the style i have ver had, as good as the weihenstephaner stuff for sure, and they have to be the standard by which these beers are measured. the yeast is great, delicate, but heavy on the banana, and all the carbonation makes the darkness of the wheat almost hard to pick up on, but there is a mellow caramel sweetness running through it from the grain, which i really like. its so refreshing, and i had no problem drinking a liter before it warmed up much. i wish this was around on shelves, although i have a feeling the draft drinks a loot nicer than some older bottles might, but id like to see it nevertheless. a perfect pairing for anything on the menu down at helgas, which is a must if you've never been. awesome beer, just a beauty."

"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Hazy amber-brown pour with a two finger foamy off-white head with nice retention and lacing. The nose is classic Weizen with lots of banana, clove, caramel, brown bread, molasses, and some subtle mineral notes. The taste follows suit with tons of sweet caramel malt along with hints of banana, clove, brown sugar, banana bread, tobacco, and molasses. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy with perfect carbonation and great balance. Overall, this is one of my favorite interpretations of the style."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, caramel, banana, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet caramel and banana flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid caramel and banana presence all around."

"O: A Dunkelweizen that is kind of mild but yet still quite complex."

"Appearance is a cloudy brown, with more apparent unfiltered yeast than Franziskaner dunkel. The smell is overwhelmingly caramel with some banana esters. Taste is very smooth with predominant flavors of caramel, clove and banana. This is one of my favorite styles and I would routinely keep kegs of this dunkelweiss in my beer cooler as soon as it is available."

"Poured into weizen glass, thick sustained fluffy head. Orange copper color with more than ample carbonation. Sharp, fruity taste with no bitterness. Tastes more like a weizen than a dunkel....small amount of sediment at the bottom of the bottle, but i ""swished"" it german style and poured into the glass. A good example of true Bavarian weizen..."

"This beer drank extremely well - poured a great, aromatic head and was incredibly balanced. It has a very appealing nutty, fresh baked bread nose to it. It went don't way too easy and I was quickly saddened once it sank in that this was a one-time beer for me. I hope that it eventually either gets imported, or if that is already in place, makes it way down South."
"Medium bodied beer that I could drink all day. The beer is very well balanced and simply tastes great. I gave my girlfriend a sip who normally is hesitant to try anything to do with Germany and she loved it. If you have the chance, try this beer."

"In short: A rather bland representative of the style. Although a self-proclaimed king (König) nothing is royal in this one."
"D: Easy to quaff and reasonable dark wheat beer."
"I can drink this!"
"OVERALL: Looks good and feels alright, but everything else was at least disappointing and maybe even a little off. Not all that enjoyable, which made it not very drinkable either. There are definitely much better examples out there. Pass."
