"Having had this directly after Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel, the former was much better in my opinion. I did not find the Ayinger to have the balanced dark wheat presence like the Weinhenstephaner did."
""
"Pours a slightly amber beer and it's thick and opaque.  Oft-white lacing which carries down the glass.  Cloves, banana, and tangy burnt orange on the nose.  Moderate to rich, full body.  Very similar to a straight hefe with a slight orange/cinnamon/and faint chocolate notes.  None overwhelming.  Finishes with a slightly sweet with a fruity, oft-lemon taste. Another top notch, high quality brew from Ayinger.  Tough to find a better German beer from any other brewer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty good dunkleweizen but not something I'm completely in love with.  It hits on all the characteristics you'd expect from a dunkleweizen, but its a just a bit too sweet for me to love it.  Definitely would try this again, but having a better balance from the hops to cut down on the sweetness would bump this up a notch for me."

"Ayinger Ur-Weisse  pours cloudy gold with a persistent 2” pillowy foam collar. It has a little banana and clove on the nose and a banana bread flavor spiced with light clove and lightly sweetened with light kettle sugars. Medium full body and above average carbonation."

"Something about a great Hefe in the winter seems so transgressive and perfect."
""
""
"Overall:  Leave it up to the Germans to make a solid dunkelweizen.  They seem to do it the best.  Another solid brew from this brewery."

"Spicy, banana. Med-high carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"I had this side by side with Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel and preferred the Ayinger, which is saying a lot.  A top representation of the style for sure."
""
""
""
"O- Supremely drinkable and packed with flavor.  One of my favorite wheat beers for sure."

"Pours a pretty dark amber in color with a good 2+-finger foamy white head that stays around for a while before settling down to a 2mm/+ head. Some sediment is seen at the bottom of the bottle. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped, rings as first that settle back down the sides of the glass. The aroma is very pleasant and is of fresh wheat, bananas and honey. The taste is even BETTER with some caramel in the mix as well. Very smooth and goes down easy with no bitterness or harsh aftertaste at all. medium bodied and perfect carbonation. A great German brew!"

"Absolutely delicious. Found it at a Fred Meyer in Beaverton. Not my first Dunkelweizen, by my first authentically German one. Poured a deep amber/light brown. Smelled of banana and cloves. Tasted almost like banana bread. I regret having only bought one. Highly recommended."

"What a great beer. Highly recommended."
"Overall – This is a very tasty weizen. The aroma, look, and taste are quite fantastic, with the only thing keeping this from the supreme top being the feel in my opinion. This is one you certainly can count on to being rather pleasant."

"Delicious dunkel."
""
""
"O: A really good weizen. Great for the weizen style, but I expected something a bit darker being a dunkel. Not upset by any means though."
"Another brilliant brew by the folks at Ayinger! A stellar companion for a hot summer day that is packed full of character. A must have for any beer fan."
"A nice hefe, flavorful and easy drinking, worth the price."

"Overall - I'm not sure if I like this more than the Weihenstephaner dunkel, but it's close. I'd love to do a side by side, and I'd enjoy doing it. Us Americans have the one up on Europe so far as most ales are concerned, but we've yet to touch on the efforts of our Eastern comrades when it comes to hefes and dunkels. There's been some commendable attempts (Sierra's Kellerwies comes to mind), but we're not there yet. This dunkel is proof we've got a hell of a way to go."
"O: Not a lot of flavor or aroma in this beer. No grain flavor, very light on esters and phenols, faint hops. It's an imported bottle, no bottle date and no import date. Won't buy it again unless I can try it fresh."

"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Hazy dark copper-amber pour with a creamy two finger white head with good retention and great lacing. The nose is earthy and malty with hints of clove, banana, caramel, wheat, honey, and some subtle citrus. The taste mirrors the nose with lots of earthy, malty, spicy goodness. Hints of clove, banana bread, caramel, orange peel, yeast, apple, white pepper, and wheat. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy but very smooth. A bit on the rich side so probably not a great session beer. Overall, I'm slowly warming up to Weizens and this is definitely a great one!"
""
""
"Nice pomegranate/cranberry color with a nice head. Smells sweet and spicy and cloves. Taste is light and not heavy at all. Very little body which is surprising. Can definitely taste the wheat and reminds me if champagne. Almost like a Belgium lambic. Very nice refreshing beer"
"We get used to paying these ridiculous prices for ""craft"" beers. Here's an excellent classic for four bucks for the 500 ml bottle. Purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego."
"Overall: much brighter for a dark weizen then I expected. This brew was filled with bubbly fruits and medium bodied breast malt tones. Slow sipper due to the big carbonation factor."
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a well-contructed beer which is found slightly wanting for malt, wheat and spice on the nose and tongue. I'd be really interested to try this fresh on tap. I suspect it might be a whole different ball game."
"O- yummy stuff, love ayinger beers they never disappoint"
""

"Popped open a .5L bottle for dessert. This is lighter colored than a dunkel, but more of an amber than your common hefe. Off the bat, it's sort of like Schneider Weisse for the darker bread notes. Overall it does follow more of the notes of a hefeweizen with mild clove, vanilla, and a hint of banana. It's toasty and bready, but also has occasional dark crispy wheat notes. It's smooth and deep, worth trying with and without the yeast dumped in—it's a little brighter before. Man, I'm wishing I didn't only buy one bottle. Get yourself some."

"This brew is medium bodied, and smoooth. It goes down nice and refreshing with no residue left behind."

"I paid only about 3.50 for the bottle, which I consider a bargain, based on its overall quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice dunkelweizen. Tastes like a slightly heavier and breadier hefe, which I'm guessing is probably exactly what it is. Very easy drinking."
""
"Nice and smooth, goes down slowly, but easily. Beautiful, maybe a bit farther than a ""dunkel", but definetely one of the best weizens out there. For me it was better than this brewery's hefeweizen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice beer - nothing mindblowing, but solid all the way through."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The flavors on this one aren't sharp but the drink moves nicely over the palate with a gentle mouthfeel that highlights the tart apple so well. The malt in this just keeps bringing bread to the palate and I really like that. It is medium bodied, tasty and very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good beer! Very smooth and pleasant to drink. I get a lot of bread to the taste with some sort of fruit like an apple. It tastes great but in my opinion I rather have Ayinger's brau weisse. It is a different style of beer but I liked the taste a bit more."
"Pours a hazy amber with a huge white head that slowly dissipates to a very thin lace. Aromas are banana and clove, with a hint of butterscotch. Flavors are banana bread, spice, citrus and muted caramel with a bready, citrus finish. Rather high carbonation with a light and peppery mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice wheat beer. Delicious."
""
"O: nice dark weizen, traditional German weizen flavors"
""
"Overall, this a perky and flavorful weisse that's a little light on the dunkel. The bold, zesty flavors aren't bad, but neither are they refined. Contrary to Ayinger's hefe, this weisse is only decent."
""
""
""
"Overall: Chock full of rotten sweetness. Still manages to be drinkable, however, probably due to the faintness of aroma and taste. Will have to try this again when I can muster the strength, to see if I had a bad bottle."
"O- Great flavor and aroma. A yummy beer, and definitely a go to weizen. It's techniquely a dunkel, but still light in many aspects."
"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy deep orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, banana, clove, pear, apple, wheat, floral, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes with a fair amount of hop presence; and good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, banana, pear, apple, clove, wheat, honey, pepper, floral, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, banana, pear, apple, clove, wheat, bread, floral, honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent dunkelweizen style. All around great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"My first dunkleweizen (having lots of firsts in the Euro styles this week)! Pours a slightly murky dark orange color with creamy light cream colored head. Yeasty almost bretty aroma with some light citrus zest and bitter banana. Flavor is banana, yeast, apple, and pear balanced by a nice effervescent bitter presence. Prickly carbonation in the tongue with medium light mouthfeel overall. I like it."
"Thick German bottle pored into a wheat glass. Enjoyed with grilled pork, homemade sauerkraut, & baked beans. Extremely rocky head. Almost fills the entire glass with foam. Smells of cotton candy, spicy pepper, clove, banana. Tastes similarly but with some dark fruit like fig. Medium full. Alcohol in check and seemingly nonexistent. A great compliment to pork & kraut. Could drink this one all night long."
"I remember having good times with the other Ayinger beers I tried back in college, so why not take a chance on another today? This stuff pours a cloudy auburn topped by a couple fingers of off-khaki foam. The nose comprises mild rye bread, clove, banana, a pinch of black pepper, and a twist of orange. The taste brings in more of the same, with the bread tending toward a spicy pumpernickel and taking the van, but the banana, clove, and light orange bringing up a strong rear. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice dunkelweizen, one of the better ones readily available around here."

"Overall, a delicious beer with a flavor nicely balanced between fruity, bready, and tart. I think it's a really great example of a dark weizen. It's hard to find flaws with the true German examples of this style. They're just so tasty, refreshing, and easy to drink I honestly don't know why I even bother reviewing them."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is different, but very pleasant. It's perhaps somewhere between a hefe and a dunkel, and yet also manages to hold very different characters from many of the examples I've had in the past. I was very interested in it as a result."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a good brew. The taste and smell compliment each other. It's a warm, bready, honey taste. Not terribly exciting, but very enjoyable. I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy, golden apple cider appearance with a nice white, single finger head that dissipates quickly. Spicy apple aroma but subdued. Nicely balanced, malt forward taste with a bit of dry bite towards the end.. faint hops. Medium-high carbonation. A nice experience for my first Dunkel. I will have to try more!"
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a beer I will be buying again, especially considering the pricepoint. I have not had too many Dunkelweizens, but this is a very good beer."

"o: Awesome example of a style I don't get enough of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- 4/5 An exceptional example of the style and a definite hit by Ayinger. Despite being a darker beer, is very light and refreshing."
"O: Overall, a pleasant introduction to the style for me. Another nice offering from Brauerei Aying."
""
""
""
"Makes me want to take a trip to Bavaria."
""
"Original beer, it reminded me of some Belgian Ales (apart from the fact it is a smooth wheat beer)."
""
""
"Poured from bottle into my ""travel tulip"". Purchased at Whole Foods in Metarie, LA. Pours a rusty orangey brown with nice off white head. Great banana and clove hefe yeast with a hint of some belgian type malts. Taste is smooth banana and caramel malt - it almost has a belgian dubbel caramel like note. Really nice...super smooth and lots of flavor. This is what to reach for if you want a proper dunkel."
"O-I really like this beer. I've enjoyed in the past and thought I had detected more of a caramel/almost toasted marshmallow in the finish. I didn't pick that up this time around, but it is an extremely enjoyable beer. I will go back to this when I'm craving a weisse."
""
""
""
""
"O: overall this is a great beer. I would not hesitate to buy this beer again. I would almost say this tastes like a much ""lighter"" Schneider Aventinus beer, which isa fantastic beer in its own right. For a price of just over $3, you cannot go wrong giving this beer a chance."
""
""
"Overall a very nice wheat beer."
""
""
""
"Straight pour from bottle into a Schnider Weiss weizen glass. A murky, hazy dull yellow with a honey quality. Nice 2+ finger head that stuck around for a bit. Smell is of bananas and some light fruits. Pick up some cloves and bread. Taste was not what I was expecting. A bit sweeter than anticipated. A hint of grapefruit and bubble gum add to the banana and wheat/earth tones. A unique and refreshing taste. Good balance with the hops. Feel was a bit dry and thin. Carbonation was lively. Overall- An interesting Dunkel. Like the blend of fruits and unique smell. Perhaps a bit too sweet on the tongue for my taste. Still a very enjoyable beer that has some different characteristics (sweet fruits and taffy, gum) that make it unique. Will have another one of these at some point. Good, not great-"

"This one is satisfying while relaxing and whiling away a cool, sunny, late summer afternoon."
""
""
"O: A very enjoyable Bavarian Dunkelweizen. The first time I had this was with a plate of Jaegerschnitzel at a local German restaurant, and it married perfectly with its native cuisine. I bought a bottle to try at home for this review, and was not disappointed."

"Really easy to drink if you're a weisse fan."

"This style is my favorite and for me, Ayinger Ur-weisse is the standard which all other dunkelweizen beers are compared to. The caramel rich, fruity aroma and taste is refreshing, precisely balanced and always delicious. Recently at a Total Wine Belgian Beer Class a participant commented that this beer as his favorite ""Belgian Beer"". The young instructor of the class immediately corrected him ""that is a Bavarian Beer, but is is excellent"". A pity that more American craft beers do not attempt to imitate Bavarian beers like Ayinger. My only wish is that Ayinger keg beer would be available in the US."

"Fantastic tasting at a reasonable price."
"O - A good complex summer beer, or great with a beef entree."
""
""
"O - I feel as if I have committed a crime buying this beer at such a price. I can say without doubt that I will be revisiting this on a regular basis."
""
"Overall, I'm having this beer again. This is a brilliant product from a brilliant brewery!!"
""
""
""
"Review from 4/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a semi-opaque brown/gold color. One finger off-white head, dissipated quickly leaving lacing. Aroma of wheat, clove, light carmel malt. A pleasant dunkelwiezen with strong carbonation, light fruit, spice and wheat flavors. Slightly rougher than Weinstephanen, but still very pleasant. Refreshing and tasty. Will buy again."
"O: I tried this tonight along with Ayinger's Brau-Weisse. Both were similar and both very good, though the Helles style of the Brau (vs the Ur's Dunkel) showed a bit better."
""
""
"Really good dunkel. Lots of flavor and complexity. A treat to consume."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is such a great value for what you get. It's been way to long since I last drank this."
"Although its full bodied, it finishes smooth and clean, like every German beer should."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- A very tasty weisse. I really liked the more complex fruity notes compared to the more mainstream examples. Retained a good refreshing mouthfeel. Would happily drink on a summers afternoon under the shade of an oak tree."

"O: A really good weizen. Great for the weizen style, but I expected something a bit darker being a dunkel. Not upset by any means though."
""
""
"O: Nice lighter beer. Has everything you'd expect from a dunkel. Would be great for a fall or spring night."
""
"see you on the next one."
""
"Pours a murky honey brown with a 2 inch foamy light beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat bread, yeast, spices, and some light fruity aromas. Taste is slightly tart and is of wheat, overripe banana, yeast, and some slightly bitter spice flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I think it tastes better than it smells."
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and very refreshing, definitely a session beer that makes me want to sit outside on the beautiful spring day that it is today and have several of these - though it would be much better in a beer garden in Bavaria."
""
""
"Very nice nose, but the tastes were a bit subdued, and the carbonation was just a bit much at times."
""
"I put this beer up against italian, and it performed well with the olive oil, tomato sauce, and balsamic vinegar. I like the balance of banana, a little sour, and breadyness. This is a very good beer. You can even get it pretty easily."
"MMurky copper orange in color with yellow hues on the edges of the glass. Poured with a thick, dense foam that slowly reduced to a thick cap. Sweet fruit and banana aromas with hints of wheat and clove. Crisp feel with aggressive yet delicate carbonation. Sweet fruit and banana flavors up front with banana flavors intensifying through the middle. A touch of clove in the middle to the finish. finishes crisp and dry. Very refreshing and enjoyable."
"overall, this is an easy drinking beer, could have had a longer finish, but a great showing of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - I like this style better than most hefeweizens, and it seems to fit the style description to a t"
"O - This has good drinkability. It has really nice flavor, and I would have no problem downing a few glasses of this, especially on a nice warm day. Overall, I think it is a really nice beer, and a good representation of the style. I'm not the most familiar with dunkelweizens, but I look forward to trying more. Anyways, I recommend checking this one out, I would buy again."
""
"Overall - Incredible. Wonderful. This beer is highly recommended no matter your tastes. This will overwhelm you with awesomeness. I am impressed."
"This beer pours a cloudy dark orange color. The head is a billowy three inches in height, and recedes slowly into two inches of fluffy foam that sticks in chunks to the sides of the glass, and lasts until the beer is gone. The aroma is of tons of cloves, and ample bananas with a hint of roasted malt. The taste is more balanced between the banana and clove elements with some nice malt tones underneath. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a chewy texture, and appropriately high carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer that I will surely drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent wheat beer with intense fruity flavors, creamy bread, and malty accents. Though not as light or zingy as other weiss can be, this is a bit of a heavier more serious sipper which is meant to be slowly enjoyed and savored."
"Overall, a great example of the style and tasty. More Ayinger win."
""
""
""
""
"not the best I've had from Ayinger but that still puts it above most German beers I've tried. pick one up if you see it along with anything else these guys make"
""
""
""
"O: Like I said, if given a choice between a hefe and a dunkel, I'll probably take a hefe. But this is nonetheless an excellent beer. If you've never had the style before, this is a great place to start."
"Overall - 4.5 One of the best dunkels (or beers) I have had thus far. I will buy this one again and through the year"
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this brew, Ayinger is one of my favorites."
""
""
""
"Ayinger's version of the dunkelweizen is classic, true to expectations, but also unique enough to draw its own interest. Like a more aggressive version of their hefeweizen. The flavors are powerful and stand out; the aromas do as well, if slightly more muted. This is a high quality dunkel, and should be alongside Weihenstephaner."

"Overall: Quite pleasant and quaffable, one of those moreish beers where you clear through the entire bottle pretty quickly. This just might beat out Weihenstephaner's dunkelweizen for me."
"Another fantastic beer from Aying, who really know their way around a wheat beer. I could drink this all night."
"O - this is my first dunkelweizen of any kind. I've always heard mixed reviews on the dunkelweizen style. I've had many Hefes including the Ayinger here, and when it comes to Ayinger weizens Id go with the dunkel over the hefe, and their hefe is a absolute great craft brew. As much as I like the hefe, I liked this one even more. This is a world class brew and an excellent introduction for me into the dunkelweizen style. Man, Ayinger really have 2 great weizens with their dunkel and their hefe. Both are a must try."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"The body is light and the carbonation is lively and a bit sharp. Overall a pretty rock solid German brew here I told my brothers girlfriend to buy me a beer and she got me this. I should clearly try that tactic more often."
"O - This is a pretty good good example of the style. An enjoyable drink, but I'd max out at two I think, and would desire a change."
"From the 500 ml. bottle. Sampled on August 7, 2011. It pours a slight murky medium to dark amber. My glass was not big enough to pour it all in without spilling some due to the huge, frothy, off-white head. Wheat and bananas penetrate the nose with virtually nothing in the way of hops or malts. The body is nice and creamy and glistens on the tongue. The taste also brings out that wheat, clove, banana flavor but there is also a noted sugary sweetness thrown in. Exquisite for an 83-degree late summer day."
"O: Very good beer. Great drinkability and a rather enjoyable purchase. Need a switch after a few however. A recommended buy."
"This was a very tasty beer, lots of good flavor, and very easy to drink. I would definitely go for this again."
"Overall this is a very, very enjoyable beer to drink, one that I would say is a session beer, as I could definitely drink several of these, one after the other. As a fan of Belgium Ales the powerful yeast of this beer is very attractive to me, and the relatively tame 5.8% ABV certainly begs one to have another. Seems to be at its best at about 45-50 degrees. This is an expensive beer to buy here in the States, and there are many domestic examples of this style."
"D - Very nice, like Ayinger's light colored weisse it has an excellent yeast character, but here it is balanced by a light note of bready toffee and just a hint of sweet caramel in the middle. Very drinkable, one of the best German wheat beers that you are likely to come across in the US."
"Overall - a decent German beer, but not the greatest I've sampled. I could drink several of these but wouldn't seek after them unless there were bad options."
"O- Nothing really interesting with this beer in my opinion. it fits the style, that's all"
"World-class."
"M:"
"M - Thin body with a clean, dry finish. Tingling carbonation."
"D: The most drinkable beer I have had in a long time."
"There is a slight carbonation on the back half of the tongue, but just like the aftertaste it’s quick. The smoothness of this beer makes up for anything else that could go wrong. It’s a lot better than a Blue Moon, and I would totally buy another bottle of this. But I really want to drink this out of a HUGE beer stein. Let’s make that happen this October, shall we? Bottoms up people!"
"Came out with a massive amount of head about three fingers high and extremely thick and fluffy. It steadily dwindled down to about a one finger height but still with large mounds of thick white head. The color is a dark burnt caramel that is extremely hazy. A lot of banana right up front with a good about of caramel apples and a little clover. Smooth with a good amount of carbonation. A quick hit of tart fruits and a bready texture moving to some zesty banana. It has a dry and tangy aftertaste some of the clove lingering in the back."
"Overall: Pretty nice, but a bit light in color and flavor for a dunkelweizen"
"O - A quality German brew. Not very dunkel but an awesome wheat beer in total."
"The flavor follows suit. The bananas are a little more ripe and mashed than the hefeweizen, the clove is plenty aggressive, and the crystal malt sweetness is amped up. Unfortunately, this Ayinger offering matches its sister beverage by being ultimately too thin to be richly rewarding. A fine beer, but perhaps too trifling."
"Definitely going to try some more of this style to do more comparing and contrasting. But right now, this isn't for me."
"This is a very drinkable Dunkelweizen; not as astringent as many of the same style. It would go well with a soft German pretzel dipped in honey mustard."
"I could drink this all night."
"M/D: the crisp carbonation finishes this one off right. A pretty light body allows the flavors to show. I could drink 2-3 of these before I needed to switch."
"Very drinkable, easy to put away the complete bottle. Pairs good with pasta and pizza. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Pours a moderately-dark golden-bronze color with a thin white head that recedes somewhat quickly and doesn't leave behind much other than a bit of spotty lacing. Almost no haze. The nose is pretty weak with a bit of sweetened malt and clove. A touch of banana there as well. Taste is quite plain as well. There's just not much coming from the malt or the yeast. Mouthfeel is a bit light and undercarbonated, though it's smooth. Drinkability is decent enough, though there's really nothing all that special about this beer."
"500 ml bottle. Pours hazy-amber with a huge, long lasting, foamy white head. Aroma is of yeast, spices with hints of banana and apple. Medium, slightly crisp body. Taste is yeast, wheat, brown sugar, spices with hints of banana. Very delicious heffeweizen."
"O- Great drink. A little less intense of a Dunkelweizen, but it's very tasty and I would definitely love to dance with it again."
"D - Very nice brew. This is worth seeking out and love enjoying a style that I think is very underrepresented. The big, delicious flavors, but not huge alcohol."
"Pours out of the bottle a nice orange-copper color with a tight white head that disappears pretty quickly and leaves little lacing on the glass. The nose is wonderful, mainly banana with a bit of clove and phenolic qualities. The taste is much more on the dry side with nice effervescence. Banana being the major player here. Definitely a nice summer session beer. Although it's a bout freezing in Texas right now this is a good beer to enjoy as an afternoon snack. And at $3.25 for a 500 ml bottle you can't go wrong."
"D - A good beer but one weiss is enough!!"
" Very Drinkable, great with meat and rich foods."
"i enjoyed this dunkel weizen very much. Poured a hazy copper with a thin white head. Aromas of roasted malts, clove, banana and apple. Tastes much the same except the apple is more pronounced. Medium body, light carbination. I could drink this with some apple pie. Ya that sounds good."
"D - I could have another, although the smoke is somewhat off-putting."
"Poured a lot lighter color than I expected. About halfway between the usual color of a dunkel and a normal hefe. The head is off-white and about 1"" tall. The smell has some fruit notes with a steady wheat smell. Taste is similar, sort of sweet, minimal bitterness, good maltiness to it but the wheat still carries the taste. the traditional banana and clove are present. Mouthfeel is medium with decent carbonation. Overall, this is not the #1 best dunkel I have ever had, but it is a wonderful beer. It fits nicely between a big hefe and a lighter dunkel."
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was its bold aroma and clean, crisp finish. The style of brew dictates darker, hefe-like aromas, and this brew had them all. It was very wheaty and estery, with that perfect darkening twist of malt and spice. With such robust scents it would seem that one or more of them could overpower the brew's taste, but here, we are given a nicely blended brew with a surprisingly delicate finish."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable and good brew. Probably a little too cold. We were keeping the beers outside in temps below freezing."
"Overall- Solid Dunkelweizen, for the price you can not go wrong with this one."
"D: Dunkelweizens continue to be a bit of a weird style to me. This one was one of the better examples I've had, but still not quite as enjoyable as a traditional hefeweizen or weizenbock."
"O: I've had much better from Ayinger."
"A rather pleasant gap-filler between a hefeweizen and dunkel, the roasted character parrying the inherent banana bread essence quite nicely. While this does entail an uptick in the sweetness, somehow it all just dovetails into an enjoyable, entirely drinkable affair, with a little extra kick for good measure."
"A dirty orange-ish brown color. It has a slight cloudy shade with a tan light head. It's a little skunky and a fresh grain smell. I get some of a bread yeast on the nose as well. The sweet bread like flavor carries over on the tongue with a classic hefe banana flavor. The finish is soft and pleasant. It lingers for just a moment. Good wheat Beer."
"D: Very high. Very drinkable beer. Much lighter than your average Dunkel."
"If you want a dunkel go with one of the ones mentioned above...you can't go wrong. If you really want to drink this one, don't drink the others first...they'll spoil you."
"Distinct from all other dunkelweizens I've had in that the banana character is rather muted, allowing the light caramel and a little cocoa to come through. The spice character is on the lower side, there's only a little clove present. Rousing the yeast brings out these flavors a little bit more. For some reason, I'm a little underwhelmed, maybe this beer isn't as fresh as it needs to be? As with the Brau-Weisse I had a couple of nights back, the flavors don't seem to pop out as much as in some of the better beers in this style. Mildly phenolic. Dry, almost grainy finish with caramel, a little clove and some banana, this beer is light in body and rather highly carbonated. Solid stuff, I do wish the body had a little bit more melanoidin/dextrinous character. Easily drinkable and refreshing on this humid, October evening, I will revisit this."
"Spiciness is a bit more prevalent on the palate, up-front especially where I pick up a bit of white pepper and clove. Caramelized bananas soon take over, along with a mild butter toffee-like sweetness that segues into a clean and mild finish with very reserved bitterness. The body is fairly chewy for a sub-6% ABV beer, but it's still very refreshing. This is another winner from Ayinger, truly a great brewery."
"A good Weissbier but by no means anything special, only surpasses Franziskaner and Paulaner due to a more natural and less process flavor, but only by a bit."
"Not quite as good as their hefe in any category but very drinkable and a great beer to pair with a hearty meal. Good looking beer with an orange-brown body and a big, creamy, ecru head. It's entirely hazy. The aroma is banana bread with some fairly mild spice. It definitely tends toward slightly toastier/breadier flavors than the hefe, though I might not have noticed that if I hadn't had the hefe so recently. The taste is sweet and fairly full. Carbonation is appropriate for the style, though, perhaps, on the softer side. Sweet wheat flavor is plentiful, but it's a bit toned down. Good beer, but I haven't had enough dunkelweizen to assess it competently."
"A highly drinkable dunkel weizen from Ayinger. Fruit forward with clove and banana taking center stage. Little hop presence noted. The carbonation is high, borderline too high. I could see this pairing well with a cheddar cheese and some sourdough bread. A nice session beer."
"Overall this is a good beer, one of the better ones i have had in its style, everything is balanced so well. A good first impression to ayinger and i am eager to try more of their brews."
"D Good drinking beer. A little light for a Dunkel, but easy to drink. Good wheat qualities like head, mouthfeel, and refreshing yeast flavor."
"D - flavourful, refreshing, well balanced, I really enjoy this brew, just a slightly spicy twist on a a classic bavarian brew"
"This is really good stuff. Simply delicious. One of the more pleasant items I have found locally lately and one of the better dunkelweizen's I've tried."
"Overall - This is a top notch Dunkelweizen. One of the best I've had. Maybe THE best I've had. If you're a fan of the style at all, this one is most definitely for you."
"A top of the line dunkelweizen! This Ayinger is ligher in color and body than the Hacker Pschorr that I had last night. - being more of a cloudy burnt orange. The aroma is pleasant clove. Flavor is classic banana and clove with some sweet malts. Not as buttery as H-S. Very solid - one of the benchmark Dunkelweizens."
"D: The beer is very refreshing and easy to drink. I would definitely try this again if I wanted a hefeweizen but something with a little more maltiness."
"Coppery amber and quite hazy with a big fluffy white cap that settled quickly to a short layer of fine bubbles. Lots of banana in the aroma, dry grain husk, cloves, bready yeast, brown sugar. Mild flavour, slight lemon with a bit of banana and malt sweetness. Spicy finish with a flash of bitterness and light apple tartness. Light bodied and quite dry, creamy carbonation. Decent overall and I really liked the aroma."
"The beer pours a really nice amber copper orange color with a huge dense foamy head that recedes very slowly. Has a very hazy cloudy body. Smell is spot on with what I was expecting. Has a lemony herbal tea component masked by bananas and cloves. Has a nice doughy bread like character. Sweet aroma. Taste is just above average as this might have been sitting on the shelves for a while. Not super fresh like I was expecting but still very nice. Lean flavors with a light quaffable finish. Easy to drink but noting crazy going on. This is super easy to drink but I fear it's too simple for me. Love the style but this might not be my brewery to go to for dunkleweizens. Worth a shot for sure."
"I'm glad I tried it, and I will probably purchase it again, but for now I will be moving on in search of other dunkelweizens."
"Very drinkable, has a good flavor that gets better as it warms. Pretty much a staple of the style."
"D - Very nice balance of all the elements in this brew. Pleasant experience ... delicious!"
"Drinkability: On a hot summer day this starts out to be nicely drinkable. However I'm finding that by about half way through the glass there is just a bit too much sweetness here so I have to take it fairly slowly to avoid having the beer cloy and be too much. Having a tasting of the Ayinger Brau Weisse highlights the fact that that beer is much lighter and more delicately flavored than is this one. While I enjoyed this beer I don' think I'll be making a great effort to find it and drink it again.."
"D - Freshness could probably bump this up quite a bit. When I first had this I thought it was the best dunkelweizen in existance, but I think lots of tasting in the meantime has given me some perspective. It's good and somewhat unique, but it doesn't stack up to the best in either class."
"A decent beer. I could see this one being enjoyed during the summer months."
"A nice weizen, but I thought it wasn't quite a dunkel, not only in appearance but in flavor too. It seems to fit somewhere in between a dunkelweizen and a hefeweizen. A bit too light, too fruity (the apple is much stronger than the banana), and lacking the spices or brown sugar that I am used to in beers of this style that I enjoy."
"Awesome brew all around!"
"This beer starts out nicely and has many nice components, but doesn't come together for me. The tart finish leaves me wanting but overall this beer is pleasant to drink."
"Creamy flavor with wheat and banana along with some muddled fruit. Offers a nice effervescence of carbonation and avoids the apparent sweetness often associated with the style. Quite drinkable and full in flavor with a long and slowly drying finish."
"Drinkability: Not the best wheat beer I've had or for its style. Though as all wheat beers Ayinger Ur-Weise enjoyable and nice any time of the year. As this beer feels heavier it makes a nice wheat beer to enjoy slowly. Alcohol content is modest so this is a good beer to preserve sobriety."
"Extraordinary Dunkle in fact the best Dunkle I have had to date."
"D - great style - this one is solid all around, just wish for a bit more creamy mouthfeel and less carbonation, it really detracts from everything else."
"Pours a hazy dark amber with the weakest head and lacing I've ever seen in any German style wheat beer. Smell: brown sugar, light banana and clove, a little husky wheat kick in the back, and a little import grain character, unfiltered applejuice. Taste: toffee, lots of clove, sugary, a little tangy wheat. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, active carbonation. It was good, maybe a little rough trip from overseas, but not the best dunkelweizen."
"D- clearly one of my all-time favorite dunkels"
"Malty rush upfront, caramel, sweet grain and light toast. Definitely a chewy beer. A subtle blanket of bitterness vibrates on the tongue ending with a sweet, tongue coating finish. Medium to high carbonation and mouth enveloping. Medium bodied and highly drinkable."
"D-very drinkable due to the light flavors, perfect for the summer"
"all sorts of food, and all sorts of occasions."
"Yumm"
"D-this is a tasty beverage with a good amount of flavor and some nice fruitiness happening. Clean, crisp and refreshing ready for a hot summer day"
"D: For what this beer has in smell and taste, it somewhat lacks in other aspects. It is easy to drink, but there are other beers of this style that I would choose before this one. Still worth trying, though."
"The body was smooth and pleasant, flowing easily over the tastebuds. Drinkability was very good, you could easily drink several of these guys over a period of time. Overall, a very good beer, worth your time."
"Overall I thought this was a solid beer, although I feel as though it was more of a hybrid between a hefe and a dunkel. Still, well worth a shot."
"Very very easy drinking. Wish I had a nice roast pork loin to chew on right now. Absolutely worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is certainly bubbly with all the carbonation but also a nice round feel to it. Drinkability is rather high and is probably one of my favorites for this style."
"Drinkability: Excellent. Could put these down all day while sitting outside people-watching."
"Recently discoverd this style at Buchowski's tavern in Boston. The maltier version of a heffe and I must say the balance really works well. I almost prefer this style to a heffeweizen. The color is a light brown with intense carbonation. The aroma and taste are all about the yeast baby with notes of bannanas, slight citrusy note, and the malts balance it out at the end. I really like this beer and brewery. Highly reccomend"
"Not loaded with flavor, but what it does, it does well."
"This beer has a decent creamy feel. It is extremely drinkable. Another great beer form the guys in Aying."
"Flavor is a little muted. Beer is thin and drinkability is fine. There are some nice ester flavors that pop up in the later palate. There is almost no carbonation on the tongue, odd. Mouthfeel is OK. I feel the sweetness should be earlier and better connected. There is a mild wheatness to this beer but overall a very good and drinkable beer."
"D - Pretty drinkable, but I don't mind nursing this a bit and pair it off with finger food."
"Drinkability: great, refreshing beer."
"Drinkability: a highly drinkable and refreshing brew. This would pair great with a sunny day."
"Drinkability: I want more."
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a small froth head that fades fast. The smell is sweet with yeast, clove, and a hint of banana. The taste is somewhat sweet, with yeast notes, and a somewhat strong banana flavor. The finish is sweet, with a ting of alcohol. The mouthfeel is heavily carbonated, smooth at first with a harsh finish. This one is a nice beer, great flavors, and good depth. Very enjoyable, a well made beer."
"The citrus is more pronounced in the taste than in the nose, along with a little alcoholic sweetness and bite of the carbonation. Feels grainy to the tongue, making for a pleasantly smooth mouthfeel. The medium body of this brew make it both easy to enjoy and a good candidate for a session beer."
"Tried this one again on 29 Dec. Still in my favorite area- german weissbier. Poured into .5l hefe glass, nice and creamy 3 finger white head that dissapates somewhat, cloudy orange color. Good lacing that follows down the glass. Not heavy on clove or banana- smooth well balanced. Good clean finish.This is another keeper."
"Mouthfeel is spritzy, sweet up front, tangy, medium bodied, and semi dry."
"Poured a big cloudy golden color with a big fluffy white head. Carbonation is a winner. Nose is sordove grain, wheat, clove. Taste is clove, wheat and banana with more clove than anything. Mouthfeel is nice with clove really kicking in, wheat and banana. Very drinkable!"
"Excellent drinkability; wish I had more than the half liter bottle. I like this one better than the brauweisse by the same brewery. Glad I tried this one; fantastic flavor."
"D: Very drinkable beer, lots of characteristics I enjoy in this one."
"Taste: Crisp carbonation with a light middle. Ends on a strong, sweet note with a good amount of dryness."
"THe carbonation borders on a near perfection level matched with a full creaminess that makes this beer extremly enjoyable. The complexity of the flavor, aroma, combined with the mouhfeel make me wonder why this brew is not higher rated in the dunklehefe catergory. An extremly enjoyable bier, drink it if you see it."
"Very good"
"Pours an orangish-amber color with a large white head. Aroma is predominantly apples, with a little malt in there as well. The taste is heavy on the bananas, but you also get some apple. No real hops or malt are present in the aroma. A very flavorful beer that is heavy on the fruit. Good beer."
"Overall, I am very pleased with this beer. It has nice head/nose/taste, not overly expensive, and not too hard to find. A great introduction to dunkel:)"
"Overall Ur-Weisse is pretty good. I would like to have seen a darker more malty character to this brew. This beer was only slightly darker than the Brau-Weisse but I would have to say that I prefer this brew over that one."
"Not bad, but nothing that really does it for me. I am just kind of uninspired with this."
"500 Mll bottle, no freshness dating, I dont think the German's are too interested in this type of helpful consumer friendly info. Pours a muddy shade of medium brown, with a slight oily glaze. The head is huge, retentive, soft, frothy and fluffy. Leaves moderate daggers of lace. Nose is chock full of bananas, yeast and dunkel weisse goodness. Tasty offering, has that nice mix of fruityness, yeastyness and dark bready wheat notes that make this a favorite style. Nice brew from Ayinger."
"D - highly drinkable and thirst quenching. great amount of flavor for something clocking in at under 6 percent. only thing better than a solid Bavarian unfiltered wheat, is a dark Bavarian unfiltered wheat. ...and maybe a oatmeal raisin cookie to go with it. :)"
"Drinkability is relatively high, owing to the pleasant flavoring and easy drinking experience. Definitely would drink another if I had one."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a Weizen glass, the beer pours a cloudy brown/orange color (more brown than orange) with a 2 inch frothy off-white head. Head retention is good, lacing is decent. The beer mostly smells like over-ripened bananas, with some clove and wheat noticable too. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, however there's also a bit of citrus in the taste, and the spice comes out stronger in the taste than it does in the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is medium with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it wouldn't be hard to have a few bottles of this. I liked this brew, it's not a bad choice at all."
"Poured a cloudy, light brown with a one finger head that stayed around as a skin over the top, throughout. The aroma was over ripe bananas. The taste was wheaty banana and sweet, not bad. Feel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The drinkability is good."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1 inch head. Aroma is of citrus, spices , cloves, very nice. Taste is also very good. Hints of citrus and spice blended together well. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this makes for a fine brew."
"m/d- mouthfeel is medium body with crisp carbonation. for some reason this is much more drinkable to me than the hefe and if it were slightly cheaper i would buy this regularly. (i am kinda cheap) overall a great dunkel that i would highly recomend"
"D- Very drinkable. Lower ABV coupled with the crispness of the drink make this an excellent summer drinker. Would definitely buy again."
"D- This was a pleasure to drink. Very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is high. Definitely a brew to keep around...when you have the cash."
"D: If this were available at MLB Stadiums, I would never order anything else."
"Very pleasing flavor, with lemon zest, vanilla, wheat, clove, and honey biscuits combining for a refreshing palate. Light, dusty hops provide a modest bitterness. Feels a bit over-carbonated at first, but the bubbles gradually settle, allowing the medium-light body to achieve a crisp and drinkable state. Great Dunkelweizen--goes down easily and packs enough flavor to keep me coming back for more. Need to try this on tap sometime."
"Final thoughts: Its a good drinking beer, less malty and more fruity and Bavarian style than the Oktoberfest which is my favorite Oktoberfest. But this is a great summer drinking beer."
"O- Very good beer. Could use a bit more yeast taste to it. but none the less it worth another go."
"not too bad for a bottled german dunkel with a very broad and delicate palate that is refreshing and fruit but quite dry. color of cheaply painted pine... murky orange amber with murk that looks like wood pulp. nose is the typical banana, clove as expected but subdued with a nice apple acid, milder than a weissebock though. herbal and soft smokey. that all seems to transfers over onto the tongue. clove and smoky are very crisp drying. and there is even a nice hint of chocolate... but not a sweet chocolate. the sweet is in the fruit... the hef style expectation. but there is a broader and in some ways contrary to that fruity brightness. mellower on the sweet. can't get this in the US on tap but would love to try it. soon enough."
"Ayinger Ur Weiss pours a hazy burnt copper color with a huge billowing white head that sticks around a bit. The aroma is banana, clove, and yeastiness with some caramel malt thrown in the mix. The flavor hits the spot with plenty of banana character, but also a good bit of clove spice with a caramel and wheat as well. This is one satisfying dunkelweizen. Full and lush in the mouthfeel as well. This is one of my favorite German styles, and Ayinger does it rather well."
"Light but chewy nice smooth lager mouthfeel. I'm a big fan of the style, but this one just didn't hit it with me."
"Pours a cloudy light brown with no head. Smells are of banana, clove, caramel, and wheat. The taste is caramel, wheat, lemon, clove and bready yeast. the aftertaste lingers for quite a while. There is a clove flavor that sticks to the tongue. It has a really nice smooth and sweet flavor. Mouthfeel is a little bit thin, the carbonation could be better and fill the beer out a little more, but it is definitely drinkable. These go down really smooth and I could have lots. Not quite as drinkable as the hefeweizen, but definitely refreshing and delicious."
"This is a very tasty beverage! Sweet and refreshing, yet rich and flavorful. Flawlessly constructed, this is my current benchmark for any future dunkelweizen competitors."
"Very drinkable. This is a beer where you enjoy every drop, and are disappointed when the glass is empty."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a 3+ finger off white head which leaves a sticky lace. Smells of banana's, cloves, citrus. The taste matches and a little sweet with some dry bitterness at the end. This beer is medium bodied with good carbonation and a bit of a sticky feeling. Very good drinkability."
"D. Easy to drink. A refreshing beer. I could enjoy several at a time."
"Y'all need to try this."
"I need to replace my Ayinger glass and fill it up with one of these. (I'm so damned clumsy with my beer glasses for some reason. At least they're cheap)"
"D: This is a nice dunkel, if not necessarily the best I've ever had. I quite enjoyed it."
"D - Extremely drinkable and refreshing. Light bodied. If you want something refreshing but don't want to sacrifice flavor this is a good bet."
"drinkability is good with flavor like this and is a light and refreshing beer"
"D: It's very drinkable. A very good beer. If I was introducing someone to this style, I would give them a bottle of this and Weihenstephaner Dunkel."
"One of my favorite beers to date, especially for the flavor. I had a lot of fun exploring this one and I am definitely going to explore the style some more."
"Overall a pretty enjoyable beer any time of year."
"drinkability- very smooth drink, will purchase again"
"Drinkability- An excellent warm-weather drinker."
"Drinkability - It was alright, above average but not memorable."
"Amazing rocky meringue-like head on this dark amber, hazy colored dunkelweizen. Extraordinarily aromatic too with traditional banana-clove, together with some soft caramel-toffee notes. Fresh bread & yeast is apparent also. Palate is smooth, creamy texture with sufficient carbonation, a soft malt component, and gently spiced in there as well."
"Ur-Weisse is a very impressive Dunkelweizen. It's pretty well done in all respects. A little amplifying of the banana and clove flavors would probably improve it enough to reach the next level. It's a very small complaint. This easily has the goods to go toe to toe with the best of the style. Recommended without reservation."
"Drinkability- Probably my favorite Dunkel to date. Quite flavorful."
"D- Very easy to drink. Refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is light, crisp. Very nice beer."
"D- high. These come in half liter bottles for a reason, because 12oz just wouldn't be enough!"
"Very good halfway in, but the second half was merely good. I'll go with the latter on this one to determine it overall."
"D-Very drinkable, amazing beer."
"D- I'd gladly substitute this for a bowl of wheaties in the morning. But I don't eat wheaties and I'm not an alcoholic. Still though, with the moderate abv, this beer has endurance."
"This is a really good weizen, but it isn't really a dark weizen, or at least it requires a bit of imagination to make the stretch. The beer pours a very hazy, almost brackish dirty water amber. There is a nice off white head and some retention and lacing. The nose is wonderful clove, apple, banana fruitiness. The taste is in line with most other German weizens you will taste. First, the carbonation is quite prickly and assertive, almost yeasty in its efforvesence. The fruity apple, banana, and clove flavors just pop through, with some other slight florals hidden underneath. The beer has a drying bite in the finish and the wheaty courseness typical of the style. This is a very sweet beer, with a prickly carbonation, a slightly biting dry finish, and loads of apple, banana, and clove flavors permeating the mid section and beyond. This is a very nice weizen, but the dunkel aspect might be a stretch. I knocked the beer down a point or two as a result. L'Chaim."
"The taste of the Ayinger Ur-Weisse is just perfect. This is an extremely light and easy to drink beer. You are immediately drawn to the taste of the fruits in the brew. You can definitely taste the yeast and malt also. It finishes very dry with little aftertaste."
"Good beer that is a standout for style."
"Pours a nice, opaque honey brown with a billowing off-white head. The foam fades after a few minutes, leaving a half-finger cap and almost no lacing. Some sediment floating around in there as well. Citrus and clove aromas abound, along with some banana and a lot of wheat character--almost bready in nature. The sweet fruit flavors fade a bit in the taste, leaving a spicy, slightly tart malt backbone. Light mouthfeel. A nice, refreshing dunkelweizen."
"not my style at all, but an awesome version of a wheat beer. i know it is a proper wheat beer unlike most of the american versions, but this tastes like a proper beer easy to enjoy and enjoy shortly thereafter."
"D - good beer, some lasting effects"
"D: While the carbonation makes it relatively light on the palate, the wheat character is very pronounced. I realize this is par for the style, and this is one of the best wheat beers I've had, but I still couldn't do more than one of these."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. $4 for a half liter is kinda steep, but I think it was worth it."
"500 mL bottle, poured into a weizen glass. Orangish amber color, nice haze, thick beige head. Aroma is standard banana and clove, with a hint of lemon and caramel. Flavor is bananas, vanilla, egg nog, and clove. Similar notes to most other dunkelweizens but it is not fitting together quite right for me compared to the elite versions of the style. Good creamy mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"The biggest problem with this is it drinks so easy, at some point you look over at the glass and see you've drunk down the whole thing without realizing it. Not heavy, and yet not light. Great quaff."
"Overall: A nice change of pace from a regular Hefeweizen, and maybe a good introduction to the style for those who don't like darker beers. For those looking for a significant departure from the Hefeweizen style, however, you might want to look elsewhere."
"A dark golden cloudy beer. The aroma is a sweet honey, fruity, a bit doughy and a note of floral and bananas. The taste is sweet malty, honey, bananas, esters, vanilla, a hint of apples and wheat. Has a light to medium light body. A creamy mouthfeel. A quick finish that doesn't linger. Overall is a very good beer"
"Slightly cloudy golden pour with a puffy white head. Nice lacing. Rich aroma of bananas, yeast, and clove. Excellent flavors of mor banana, butter, some musty wheat (in a good way), and bread. Almost like liquid banana bread. Truly a dunkelweizen done right."
"Poured a dark copper, cloudy body with two-figner head and a thick lace ring around the cup. A heavy citric fruit smell, mostly bananas, entwined with some clove and pepper and a dash of something sweet. Extremely smooth and creamy with a thin-to-medium body, has a solid fruit taste (to me it is mostly bananas) that is mixed with a dash of spices that perk up the beer and balance it. No real discernable hop taste, but finishes with a semi-dry backbite to balance out this slick, fruit and sweetish beer (the wheat twang in the middle is great and rounds out the beer). I could session this bad boy anytime."
"D - Very, very drinkable. This is a good one indeed. All around great beer!"
"Pours a dark amber color with a large white head that quickly settles. No lacing is left on the glass. The smell is good with spice and fruity esters. Nice malty base flavor with the yeast flavors playing not as large a role as in other Dunkels. More approachable wheat beer for that reason. Light body with abundant, bordering on harsh carbonation. Nice overall and very drinkable. Good introduction to the style for people."
"""Lightest dunkel weizen I've sampled but it's no slouch. Rich yeasty aroma very nice and fruity with some mild spice, mostly banana and clove but there's some lemon and orange worked in there. Murky deep orange pour with some slight copper coloring, huge wheat head (as to be expected), and mild lacing. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, but a creamy finish evened it out to average at best. Good welcoming flavor of mild banana and spice. German wheats are a wonderful thing and Ayinger makes some fine examples."
"Pours a dark brown yellow color body that is very cloudy and effervescent. Big white foamy head. Aroma is very effervescent, citrusy, and lemony with some wheat. Not a very strong taste. Wheaty, citrusy, effervescent. Watery. A nice light beer."
"Overall, a worthy dunkel weizen. I'd need to have it back to back with the Spaten Fanziskaner to be sure which I prefer."
"Slightly thinner than I like from some of these chewy German hefes. Still, it's delicious and a pleasure to drink with excellent flavor and spritzy carbonation. Schneider and Ayinger ""get it"" and have earned every bit of praise that they receive. A nice beer to return to reviewing with."
"D - Very drinkable. Pleasant taste and desirable; lighter than the smell and even the tones on the palate."
"this beer pours a hazy orangish amber color with a creamy white head that fades to a thin film of lacing. the aroma is a very nice traditional hefe smell with a good amount of banana and spice. the taste follows suite with a really nice banana flavor and the clove/spice taste is particularly noticeable in the dry finish... the the mouthfeel is a little rough for me with the carbonation overwhelming the bit of malt body that it has. the beer remains quite good despite the carbonation... and I'd love to have a few more."
"Pretty good Dunkelweisse but there are better ones out there. Franziskaner and Weihenstephaner come to mind."
"Had a bottle at Moan and Dove. The beer had a murky gold appearance with some lacing but a really solid head. Aromas had a generally fruity aspect wrapped around metallic and bready flavors. More on the bready/wheaty side with the taste. A wonderfully sweet beer that was also light and refreshing. Overall, a great dunkel."
"Very good beer, I'm sure I gonna have some more of that stuff."
"D: This is an outstanding dark country wheat beer, one of the best flavours out there in this style. Ayinger continues to make outstanding stuff."
"Overall - A very good Dunkelweizen and another top notch brew from Ayinger... recommended..."
"An excellent beer. Large flavors make for an interesting drinking experience and the tart finish balances the whole beverage well."
"D - This is a pretty good beer thats easy to drink and it has a good taste worth trying sometime"
"Served in a weizen glass. Poured a pale orange-gold with poor clarity although some light penetration. Tight, rocky, bright white head filled half the glass during the transfer from the bottle. Some lacing, but no legs. Nose is banana, bubblegum, clove and yeast. Taste follows nose, but less intense and well balanced. Mouthfeel is light and pleasantly effervescent. Excellent drinkability; what a refreshing and tasty brew."
"D: Very easy to drink. Very refreshing and very smooth. Classic of the style, yet some interesting subtle flavors."
"Hazy, glowing dark tan color with a creamy beige head. Very nice lacing. The nose had a complex mixture of tart and tropical fruits, wheat malts and spicy yeasts. The taste has a fantastic balance. Buttery malts with a crisp fruity character and herbal yeasts. Body is light and refreshing yet full on the palate. Pairs well with many dishes. Another fantastic offering from Ayinger."
"Worth a try..."
"500mL bottle purchased for $3.30 - I think it was from Wine Emporium in Boston. Freshness unknown. An interesting pour into a weisse glass. Started off light, getting much darker as the bottom of the bottle was poured in. Although I swished the end of the bottle lots to shake up the sediment, there were still numerous chunks in the glass... so I stirred it with a spoon! My first time ever doing that. The end product is a cloudy grey-gold. Medium aroma of a typical weisse - yeast, banana and bubblegum. Taste is solid. Quite yeasty, which gives it a bit more of a spicy character perhaps than some other weisses."
"Exciting to finally review something by Ayinger after reading so much about the brewery.... pours a beautiful bright orange-to-brown blend from bottom to top, an almost shadowy hefe... head is thick, pillowy inches that hold nicely in a Schneider Edel-Weisse glass... yeasts are punchy and arresting; something like citrus fruit plays on the nostril with a touch of malt.... smooth, almost laidback presence, with minimal effervescence and the slightest bit of a flourish at the finish--extremely refreshing...surprisingly straightforward in taste: confident wheat couples with a fruity acidity and an underlying malt fortification--a flavor that is both unique and undemanding...begins without fanfare, and I wondered what the awe was about...by midglass, I realized how complete a beer this is, conforming body to mouth, taste to thirst and complexity to the style. A perfect August offering."
"D: Amazingly drinkable. MMMMmmmm....5.8% alcohol? You wouldn't even know it."
"Beer is a nice light brown color, some yeast haze not as dark or as cloudy as other dunkles weizens. The aroma contains a nicebalance of bananna and clove but it is a bit subdued when compared to other examples, no hops, some malt. The body is good with a lot of co2 carbonation. Actually foamed a little bit at the mouth of the bottle when first opened. Very good drinkability."
"17 oz bottle: Aroma is a bready, yeast, roasted caramel malt, light fruits, and spices. Appearance is a murky brown with a thin off white head that diminishes into a soapy film at the top of the glass. Taste is rather effervescent with a bubbly apple and and rather mild caramel malt taste with the yeast present in the the taste as well. Other flavors are clove, some banana, and bread. Overall, It's a very drinkable Dunkelweizen. Wheat and with a nice wiezen texture."
"Poured cloudy amber with a thick head that was unremarkable. The nose was earthy with a very mild but fizzy mouthfeel. The start was dominated by the fizziness but the finish was smoothe with a slight sour twist. I wouldn't describe it as citrus but it is not far off and very faint. The very slightest hint of alcohol at the very end. All in all, an easy to drink beer that I may have done the disservice of serving at too high a temperature. Look for update."
"Highly recommended. I will be buying more of these, especially since it is only a few bucks for a 500 mL."
"Enjoying this beer after a day of various activities during the family vacation. My old man loves his German brews, so I made sure to purchase some to mix in with my American craft selection."
"D: High. I like this beer, it is very refreshing and smooth. I could knock back a bunch of these."
"I was a little surprised when I poured a standard Hefeweizen hue and haze. The color was a little darker than, say, Brau Weiss but not by much. The flavors seem a bit deeper with more emphasis on barley malt than wheat. However, the beer did exhibit much bananna, clove, and slightly bruised fruit esters. Light on the bubble-gum, lemon, citrus notes. More full and round to the palate than most Hefe's, but still not as rich as a Dunkel Weiss. Finishes quite sweet, bready, and creamy."
"I can't help but think that Ur-Weisse is just a worse version of the Bräu-Weisse (excuse the cross-style comparison). I've had better dunkelweizens though, and I'll probably stick to other versions in the future."
"This beer has a stronger taste than the average hefe with some caramel malt in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit richer than a hefe, but still close. This is a stronger tasting ""bigger"" beer than the Brau-Weisse. Drinkability is very good. I can see myself getting a few mixed six packs of the Brau and Ur Weisse beers."
"D: Drinkability was incredibly smooth, clean and great going down. A near perfect example per style."
"D: Very tasty and extremely drinkable. For whatever reason, I've ignored this one on the shelves; it took a sale price to interest me. Now that I've tried it, Ur-Weisse could be a real player in the spring/summer beer lineup at our place."
"Ur-weisse has a gorgeous hazy copper color with a huge abundant off white head. It has an attractive aroma of banana, sweet malts and spice. The aroma leads you to a full body of caramel malts rapped around fruity yeast and light spices that finishes slowly. This is a very flavorful dunkelweizen and one of my favorite summertime treats."
"Quite enjoyable to drink - maybe a little heavier than a typical weisse beer as expected but good for a warm day when seeking a meatier flavor profile."
"It's a very typical beer and very easily drinkable, even in the 16.9 oz variety. I could drink plenty of these and enjoy it. Though I don't think it's as good as some of its counterparts in the style, it's still a solid choice. Definitely recommended."
"D. Fantastic. Another winner from Ayinger."
"D: Pretty light and fresh, flavors are good, aftertaste is nice. Seems like I could drink many of these."
"Side note: It goes well with chocolate covered peanuts. ( I happened to be snacking on them after the first samples of the brew.)"
"D: Like most of Ayinger's beers, this one is pretty drinkable. I don't know if it's on the same level as their Brau-Weisse (it doesn't have the same complexity), but it's still pretty good."
"One of the best in its class, and insanely drinkable do to the modest ABV. (Note to self: stock up on these next time!!)"
"Orange/gold colour with big head , the nose was old banana and cloves. The tastes was like a regular Hefe on steroids. In fact the bigness of the typical Hefe flavours kind of detracts from the drinkability. ( Though i realize that the regular Hefe is in the lineup as is less in your face.) However, this is a wellmade beer that is not afraid to pump up the Hefe notes."
"D:Overall I think this is a really good beer. The flavor is very easy going and refreshing. I would love to order more than one of these beers."
"Aroma is strong and ""wheaty"" with a bit of an alcohol nip and a hint of citrus. Color is a cloudy, light brownish amber, translucent but not clear. Flavor is strongly wheaty, with just a whisper of citrus, no hoppy or bitter taste. It dances on the tongue as it goes down and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. I recommend it to all weizen fans."
"D: Not bad, solid tasty and balanced, wish the head stuck around a little longer though."
"good drinkability, the glass empties too quickly. a very nice, well crafted dunkel weizen."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"The smell is sweet and has fruity aromas. The taste is crisp and clean and has a nice wheat flavor to it. It has banana taste and aroma with a tartness on the finish. It is semi dry to dry on the tongue and overall is a darn good brew."
"nothing horrible, nothing spectacular."
"D- Good, very nice beer, goes well with light meals."
"Verdict: A decent and drinkable dunkelweizen. I knock down a bit in score because I don't see the dunkel part of this beer (it's not very dark). Smell and taste are appetizing though. The ABV is low enough to make it a decent session ale."
"Good beer that I've only had one other time... tasty and very drinkable."
"D'ability - a nice melding of dark malt character with hefeweissen fruitiness. These two elements perfectly in balance. Yeast character maybe a little too well controlled for my taste."
"D- This was a good beer not great but good. There are defiantly better examples of the style out there."
"Solid dunkel and quite tasty. Refreshing and uplifting, somewhat filling and good with sausage."
"This beer poured out was just beautiful. It had a white, pillowy head. The beer was a cloudy, apple cider color. The aroma was fruity with bananas and spices. The aroma also had a slight sourness. The flavor was smooth and creamy with a banana flavor and an alcohol finish. This is a very good, drinkable beer."
"The smell was rich and heavenly, very fruity. There was the expected aroma of cloves, a little banana, and some old smokiness and cidery aroma notes. The taste was a little sour, fruity, with a good tangy flavor. Very little bitterness and whisky flavor notes in the finish. Ever so slight graininess, and some warming alcohol to the mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Light to medium mouthfeel. This is a great brew to sip and savor. Excellent drinkability because of its complex and authentic flavor. Get some, you won't be disappointed."
"I'm not a big wheat beer fan, but this is pretty tasty. I'd take this over a hefeweizen for sure, and actually might pick it over the non-wheat beers I'd usually go for."
"Drinkability: A very nice Dunkel Weizen...I'd enjoy it again"
"D- Well-balanced and easy-drinking Dunkelweizen that tastes like a slightly maltier version of Ayinger's banana-forward hefeweizen, this is a flavorful beer that is somewhat lacking in the traditional Munich malts of this style, a good beer overall but I wish it had a bit more malty richness"
"well it's about time i start trying wheats, not to sure what to expect so here it goes; pours a murky light copper w/ a fizzy white head which lasts a while, nice lacing; interesting aroma, combo of bread & fruits; tart fruity taste w/ a faint hop flavor, very complex flavor, but good; pleasing light body yet w/ lots of residual sugars; i'm going to say i like this one, wheat or not, i'll def. drink it again.."
"this poured a slightly hazy deep amber/almond with a nice creamy head and lacing. nose was spicy, roasty, nutty, and toffee-ish. aromas carried through in the well-balanced flavor. minimal hop presence in this one. sessionable, and another nice offering from ayinger."
"17oz. bottle poured in Ayinger weiss beer glass. Cloudy dark golden color with huge white head. Aroma is of bananas and apples. Flavor is also fruity with the bananas and apples. Clean crisp finish with hint of cloves. Lacks the citrus taste of many hefes, but still quite good. Wish I had some more. Drinkability is quite high on this one. Mouthfeel was very pleasant."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Perhaps the banana masks the alcohol content. It's a very smooth and drinkable beer with an unusual but good taste. I'd pick this up again and offer it to friends."
"A quality beer and an easy drinker for sure."
"D: This one is great. Definitely will visit this one again and often."
"D- not my favorite style, i like more bitter, but this is probably the best damn hefe-weizenbier i've ever tasted, dunkel or no dunkel. don't forget to drink the yeast at the bottom it's good for you."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, very good representation of style, it’s certainly worth drinking a few of if you’re in the mood for the style. This one is just another quality German brew."
"Pours a cloudy amber-gold with a dense and rocky two and a half finger head. Good retention leaves a few whisps of lace on the sides of the glass. German wheat phenols are immediate; banana and clove being strongest with a strong wheat scent in competetiion with a toasty caramel aroma. Some candyish alcohol aromas develop as it warms and a hint of fruitcake ester towards the end. Sweet flaked wheat and toasty pale malt upon first sip, and a mellow but obvious steely caramel flavor quickly develops. The aftertaste displays the charismatic bavarian wheat yeast phenols of banana and mellow clove that fades quickly, but really boasts an assertive bubblegum taste similiar to the Hefe-Weizen made by the same brewery. The mouthfeel is deliciously creamy and draws much of its girth from the wheat and suspended yeast. Thus, a light bodied beer with high carbonation has the illusion of being a hearty brew while retaining an exceptional drinkability. The hop character is subdued and seems to be slightly spicy and floral- probably Hallertau or a derivative; while its contribution to the flavor is minute- the spiciness created by the yeast balances the mild residual sweetness. The richness of the malt and complex bouquet of aromas and flavor seems to contradict the ease with which one can drink this beer, but this is simply a testament to what an authentic German brewery can accomplish within a style native to their homeland."
"Pours hazy amber, with HUGE head..had to stop and re-pour 4 times to fill the glass. Smell of wheat, and a bit alcohol. Taste of cloves, and wheat. Good easy drinking Dunkel, Finishes with a bit of alcohol bite. Impressed with alomst all Ayinger brews."
"D- This beer has a big aroma with a softer flavor but they both have some good complexity. This beer is a meal in a glass and is very filling. With a flood of bland wheat beers on the market I forgot how great wheat beers can really taste."
"Light carbonation and a heavy body, almost creamy with wonderful taste, this was extremely refreshing and very smooth. I would drink so much of this beer. A definite must-try, overall: amazing."
"I was mildly disappointed with this beer but am willing to try again. It certainly would not be my first choice."
"Pours a cloudy orangish-brown with two fingers of white head with good retention and some lacing. The pleasant aroma, while not very strong, is of bananas, cloves, yeast, and some bready wheat. Taste is much like the aroma with bananas and cloves dominant over the wheat backbone and pleasant yeast flavors. The bananas are dominant at first but then give way to cloves in the finish. Good mouthfeel with a light-medium body and moderate carbonation as evidenced by the creamy head. Overall this is a very good brew with balanced flavors and at 5.8% ABV I'd say this just fits into my definition of a good session beer."
"Taste is light and crisp. Some malt gives it a bit of sweetness and calms down the citrus. Leaves a bit of a stickiness in the mouth, even though it's light. Not sure if I like that, isn't quite as quenching as other Weizens. Aftertaste is slight and rather clean."
"D- This beer is extremely drinkable because it is so delicious and light. I could easily have a few on a summer day."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a dirty and cloudy dark beige color beer with a huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of banana bread is very dominant and enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by the banana bread with some ester notes. Body is above average with some great carbonation. This is definitely a style that I dont have a chance to try very often but thought was very interesting but maybe a bit one-dimensional."
"Poured into a Erdinger Weisse glass a cloudy light brown color with a big white head, that quickly became a nice white lacing with excellent retention. Nose revealed some banana, clove and apple. Flavors detected include baked bread, juicy fruits and powdered sugar. The body of this beer is relatively light, and prickly on the tongue. This is a very easy Dunkel Weizen to drink. Not my favorite for the style, but still damn good, and worth a try.Rosemary crackers with goat's milk Brie was a nice pairing for this one. Cheers."
"D: Not sure what to think. The highlights of this beer are evident, mostly in the flavor, but even that does not quite hit the ""outstanding"" mark, so it remains a beer that can satisfy, but may not be one to go back to as often as others in the dunkel category. Still, a solid beer in its own right."
"Quite a nice dunkel/ur weizen. A great full flavored alternative to some lighter hefe's out there. Perfect for summer BBQ's, and friendly outdoor gatherings. Recommended, and worth seeking out. Very nicely made dunkel."
"Poured from a 17oz. bottle, into a weizen glass. The beer pours a hazy light brown, forming a 1/4 inch white head that quickly faded. Light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is light fruity notes and sweet malt. The taste is largely sweet malts, very thick, with a light fruity backdrop. Medium mouthfeel, a little thicker than expected, and smooth finish. Good drinkability based on the flavor and moderate abv. Overall, a good brew, and one worth trying. I know I'll be having a few of these in my future sessions. Try it!!"
"I declare this the summer of the dunkel weizen!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Smooth but very active in the mouth, where the carbonation really takes off and begs to be paired with traditional German fare... I could especially see sauerbraten or pork sausage with sauerkraut going well with this. The drinkability is excellent, where the flavors are somewhat weak... it's definitely a candidate for this summer's session brews."
"Served in a 16.9 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass. Appears as a light golden orange color, with a slightly off-white head that tends to linger. Lacing evident. Aroma a mix of yeast and cloves. Flavor is tart with a clovy finish, very light malt flavor detectable. Mouthfeel is refreshingly light and effervescent from the carbonation. A beer that is very easy to drink. I did find the Ayinger Ur-Weisse relatively light for a ""dunkelweizen"" in appearance and flavor, yet it is one I would drink again and again."
"This beer poured a cloudy light brown with a fluffy off white head. The nose was bready and yeasty with some banana floating around. Nice crisp/biting body, nice doses of fruit, banana, sweet apple and them some tart apple to finish. There is a spicy peppery flavor in there as well. Highly carbonated, very drinkable and refreshing."
"Drinkability: Are you kidding me?...I could drink this morning, noon and night! A very good example of the style, and if you like Dunkel Weizens don't miss a chance to grab a couple bottles of this!"
"Overall a good dunkel weizen. I will drink this one again."
"Drinkability: This is definitely one of the benchmark dunkelweizens, a very classy brew."
"Pours a light orange with thick creamy off white head. Not much hops aroma nor much malt-which is no problem with the being a wheat. I pick up a strong orange juice taste-sweet with a touch of OJ. Mouthfeel is light and drinkablity is high. I like this beer and I think I was expecting more of a ""american"" dark wheat-but none the less nice beer."
"Drinkability - The first day of spring and this was a nice way to enjoy it."
"D: Smooth....just utterly smooth and soft on the palate. Excellent drinkability. A very nice dunkel."
"Pours a golden amber with a thin head that leaves a hint of lacing around the edges. Smells of honey and apricots, with just a note of hops dancing around the edges. Taste has that honey note up front, with a light nut flavor behind that. The mouthfeel is very smooth & silky. Goes down VERY smoothly. Nothing to improve on there, really. Drinkability is vary good. This is the kind of beer that, when combined with a sunny afternoon and a shaded patio, makes for a very, very good day."
"poured from a 17oz. bottle a cloudy tea color very large off white tight bubbled head that settled to just covering the beer and no lacing to speak of. smell of bubblegum then a fruity spice aroma comes through. taste bubblegum, bananna, clove. mouthfeel smooth, light, good carbonation. very tasty."
"Very murky brown color with a large off-white fizzy head. Very complex nose, with banana and clove standing out, as well as apples and darker fruit smells. Creamy feel with a medium body. Carbonation is strong and fizzy. Semi-sweet taste of banana and spices with a lightly acidic finish. Complex and very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is perhaps a bit watery that thins out a bit towards the bottom of the glass. However, a very enjoyable beer that was a great choice."
"This is a very pleasant looking beer in the glass. An opaque toffee brown capped with a fluffy head that gives way to a white ring. I thought it might be darker. There isn't much aroma to it, clean malt smells with some banana-ish notes. The flavors are more pronounced and the banana thing is right out front. A good, balanced finish in which the carbonation is eveident. It's OK."
"Pours a cloudy dirt color, almost looks like a muddle puddle in a glass. Very nice off-white head that dissipated into a nice cap with a yeast cloud that slowly settles. The smell is of bananas & cloves. The taste is of bananas, clove, pepper. Taste is more of a hefe weisen then a dunkel weisen, I don't detect much malt flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit fizzy yet creamy, feels light on the tongue. I find this to be very drinkable and a fine example of the style."
"Poured a dark cloudy amber into a standard american style beer glass, (I shared the bottle). Smells of cloves and bananas. Taste was much the same. Mouthfeel is extraordinarily smooth. This is one of the more highly drinkable beers an a good example of the style. I wish more fine Weizens were available here as it's a great German style. My favorite beer style with pizza when I was stationed in Germany."
"Drinks pretty easy, I could probably drink 2-3 .5 liters of this of this no problem. This seems to accentuate the style with out being over the top. This is a quality offering from Ayinger"
"Verdict: one of the best examples of the style I have had. A lot of flavor, leaves you wanting more after each sip."
"Nice, light, crisp mouthfeel with an oily texture and sweet mouthfeeel complements the sugary malt and fruit flavors. Could stand a liittle hop balance, even for the style. Overall, a touch too sweet for me although still tasty and worthwhile."
"This beer poured a light brown cloudy color with a thick head that was persist and had nice lacing. The smell is malty and a bit mildpleasingly delicate. The taste is sour and malty with a flowery hint. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a carbonation bite. This is a delicious beer that is quite drinkable and Id be happy to have this often in the future."
"Mouthfeel of this brew is great. It is alive on the palate. The high carbonation levels are appropriate for a brew of this flavor and compliment the taste of it quite nicely. It has a full body and leaves you wanting more. It is very easy to drink and goes down well. It would be hard to drink this one fast, but then again its not meant for that, most good beer isn't. I'll most likely buy this in the future. I don't know if I could sit around and drink this all day, the sweetness might just prove to be too much."
"Pours dark golden color, with haze. Nice white head, stays pretty much for the whole beer. Strong smell when I first poured it. Tastes very strongly of bananas, and fruity, a little sour, and a little sweet. Feels crisp with carbonation, but not too much. My first experience with a dunkel weizen, and it is great. I need to remember to get this again."
"The lack of excessive sweetness makes it very drinkable in my view."
"Fairly drinkable, thanks to the non-existant traces of alcohol. Tempered by one's respective love for astringent bitters. Could go down very well indeed on a hot day with some grilled sausages!"
"A superb dunkel weizen. Excellent mouthfeel, strong but balanced flavors, and a smooth, slick, wet, and refreshing feel. A must have dunkel weizen!"
"Ayinger Ur-weisse has a mutant foamy head that lasts almost indefinitely. It's not particularly dark just wild looking. It smells of cloves and yeast, and tastes very fuity and smooth. The flavor is rather solid and balanced. I notice hints of banana and clove as expected. This is really an immaculately balanced, cohesive beer. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy but retains it's refreshing lively character that wheat ale is known for. The dunkle in this case is really just a less refined/processed version of a ""normal"" hefeweizen. This beer feels old fashioned and high quality in its construction. Pairs well with food. I've got to try it with sauerkraut."
"The mouthfeel is thick and coating, and like most weizens I think its drinkability is high."
"The pour into my Ayinger weizen glass raised a massive island of a head, more than three inches of light tan foam, over a dark brown beer shot through with copper and yellow. The nose is strong of clove and especially banana bread. Has a good bready-wheaty scent. The beer has a warm clovey/banana bread taste, pretty sweet throughout. The mouthfeel is fairly light, with high carbonation. This dunkel weizen is easy but complex."
"This is the second Ayinger beer that I have tried, and both were excellent. I must get around to reviewing the Celebrator. It is one of my favorites."
"Ayinger Ur-Weisse was amber in color and slightly hazy. The head was fairly large, but quick to dissipate. It had a sweet fruity aroma. The taste was fruity as well, lots of banana. It was slightly sweet in the begining, but balances out in the finish. It is medium bodied and well carbonated. It's a good beer, but I prefer the Altbairisch Dunkel."
"Cheers!"
"Wow, what a head! Poured from a cold (probably too cold) refrigerated bottle and an aggressive pour yielded approximately 3"" of beer and 11"" of head. The head was loosely packed and quite irregular. A hazy pale ale color. The smell was nice with light doughy, banana, citrus aroma. The taste yield the same. Although I am not a fan of weisse beer, this beer seemed to add a slight ale depth to a common hefe."
"D - Not bad. A nice change up from a regular Hefe."
"The mouth is slightly oily and smooth. This is an easy beer to drink and an easier one to like. Just a well done interpretation. Glad I bought a case at Sams Liquors in Downers Grove. On special for $44.95 for 20 bottles."
" Very, very exceptional & tasty! This one I can drink every night, and never get bored with. I do prefer this over their regular Hefe Weizen, which has a more pineapple presence and lighter in color, and has a lighter feel to it, but thats just me. Both are great, I just prefer this style a tad more."
"Hazy amber-highlighted caramel. Modest khaki head of snapping small and medium bubbles which settles to a thin cap and left no lacing. Distributed tiny, but vibrant carbonation streams. Clove dipped banana bread with a hint of clean alcohol aroma. Distinct banana bread takes front and center. The wheatiness comes through and leads into a nice clove accentuated finish which has a bit of length, but not too much. There is also a light lemon zest note that provides just a bit of freshness and brightness. Light-medium body with tight, active carbonation and a slightly smooth mouthfeel. The tongue becomes lightly glazed with banana bread and cloves. Nice and pleasant and more enjoyable than their Bräu-weisse."
" Taste is sweet wheat/yeast up front, a spicy middle, and roasty malts and cloves bringing up the finish. Mouthfeel is nice, maybe a tad thin but well carbonates and has that wheat beer sharpness. A pretty darn drinkable brew!"
"Taste is of wheat, clove, banana and hop bitterness. Slightly acidic or astringent presence on the palate, but just enough to give the mouthfeel a sense of vibrance. Fruity notes meld nicely into a bitter hop soaked exit, leaving a very clean finish to this brew. I find myself going back to Ayinger brews more and more. Good stuff."
"But, what really hits you here is the fruity, strong banana nose of this beer. Not so light and delicate, the fruit is in the taste, and there is a wheat beer twang. There is a great finish. The mouthfeel is nice, but just like the taste, I was looking for something to impress me a bit more; a bit bigger and more like some of the other Dunkels. But still, a nice complex wheat beer for some sausage or kielbasa, and some nice mustard."
"Very crisp and refreshing. Good warm weather drink and much more flavorful than most weizens I've tried. One of the best brews I've tried of any style."
"Drinkability - this is decent, but not great. Goes down decently, but its taste will fall apart if it gets too warm, which I think could happen a lot on a hot day, and is too bad because a wheat beer should be a summer drink...It's not bad, but I won't visit it often."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is high, as the weizen flavors seemlessly meld with the darker malts."
"Overall- a nice Dunkel that is tasty but might be just a tad too pricey at $3.10 for a 500ml bottle."
"Decent for a dunkel weizen and something you could drink quite a bit of before getting tired of it. Would pair well with sausages and grilled or roasted pork."
"D: I've yet to have a dunkel that has impressed me. This isn't a bad beer, but why drink this when you can have an Ayinger hefeweizen?"
"Mine poured with a beautiful, merangue like, slightly off white head. The beer was a murky, hazy, honey colored brew. The head retained fairly well and left lacing down the sides of the glass. The nose was strong banana. The beer tasted of banana bread (spicy and doughy) but light bodied and very enjoyable served up cold. This is a good beer for these humid, hott Ohio summer days."
"An excellent beer that is very drinkable. I could easily have a few of these in a sitting and not get tired of it. Another winner from Ayinger."
"The taste was light and refreshing. Malty - no hop presence - fitting for style. The banana/clove and citrus held up throughout, though the citrus, esp. orange, though some lemon as well, took over a bit, especially in the mouthfeel. It left a bit of a tang - not a bad thing though. Overall, very clean feeling was left. It was about as complex as this style gets - a good beer all around - will certainly keep it in my summer beer cycle. Another good brew from an outstanding brewery!"
"Burnt copper color, with haze-of-yeast and a soft, bright white head that stays around forever. Big sugared bananas, some cloves, but also a slightly musty sourness on the nose. It's half intriguing and half offputting. On the palate, the first thing to assert itself is the cloves note. Sweet malts -- wheat coated with caramel, hang on until the finish, which is surprisingly watery and redolent of that sour/funky quality I mentioned earlier. Bananas come out at the last split second. This is a quality brew, but it's got a few detractions to it, some elements that don't quite fit in."
"This pours a cloudy coppery color with a giant white foamy head that leaves nice lacing. The smell ""bisquit' yeast, lemon zest, cloves, and some ripe banana aromas. The taste has some candy sugar, lemon, clove, and wheat. The taste is very good and refreshing. The m/f is light and well balanced. This is a quality made beer. Another excellant beer from Ayinger, I don't think you can go wrong with any of them."
"It smelled of banana and cloves. The flavors came through in the taste. So did some hop flavors and wheat. Mouthfeel was slightly grainy and dry. It is a fairly heavy beer, but I enjoyed it very much."
"Dunkelweizen is one of the most hit-or-miss styles, and this one hits dead on."
"Very little about it is special. Bottomline: I wish I didn't spend $3.40 for a bottle."
"Pours cloudy golden tan with big frothy white head that dissipates to a small blanket of foam. Caramel malts, bananas, cloves, and fresh hops in the nose. Flavor is dominated by slightly sweet, lightly roasted caramel malts and bananas. Finishes with quenching fruity tartness and extremely dry hops. Quite light and carbonated mouth-feel, perhaps a bit on the thin side. A very nice dunkel weizen!"
"An awesome beer to say the least. The drinkability level is off the charts. Incredibly versatile, I could drink this anytime day or night during any season of the year. Overall, a very solid beer and one of my favorite styles."
"Drinkability is high. MK"
"D - high, very drinkable and easy to pound, could do these by the bottle"
"Overall, this beer's aroma makes it my last place pick of the beers I'm drinking tonight."
"Presentation: Packaged in a half-liter (16.9 ounce) brown glass bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Hazy light caramel color, 3-finger thick head with decent retention. Aroma is pleasant: wheaty, banana creme, and yeast with a light spiciness, and hint of clove. The taste is very clean an dcrisp, with more banana and wheat-like flavors. The flavor doesn't gather much complexity from start to finish, however, and pretty much remains the same, with a bit of spice perhaps. The alcohol is really hardly noticible. Good strong carbonation, light to medium thick, it has a semi-creamy mouthfeel. Very good drinkability here, although not not much complexity. It goes down easy and is very enjoyable."
"Okay... this dark weizen isn't very dark in appearance, smell, or flavor. However, I can't fault it for being completely out of its style range - it's damn tasty. I could drink it all night."
"I really want to visit Aying, Germany to see the magic up close!"
"D: Very good."
"My god, did you swirl the bottom of the bottle to get all the yeast into your glass? I did, and it's shocking. It looks like coffee with cream in my glass. Poured a big, bubbly head and the thing has amazing fizz going on down below, which I can somehow see through the muddiness of this beautiful beer. Smells not unlike a typical German Hefe--good aromas. I've never been a big fan of Hefes because some of them have that metallic phenol bite that I think often overpowers the brew, but this one is fantastic, and I didn't have any desire to cut it with a lemon. Now put this thing in your mouth...it's like you could chew on it! In a good way, of course. It's got appropriate fizz, but it is full and filling--exactly what I expect from a German Hefe. God bless the Germans."
"Overall, a bit of a disappointment for me. Not bad, but not that great either."
"This is a very tasty beer and I crave another."
"Pours a fairly clear, light amber color with a thick airy head. Smell is obvious hefe, with banana, clove, and hint of vanilla and just a bit of pepper. Feels nice and wet with a smooth finish, good carbonation. Taste is mild, with flavors well blended. Some nice spicyness on the tip of the tongue. This does not really seem like a Dunkle weiss, more of a standard hefe with a bit more malt flavor and spicyness, maybe should be called an Amber weiss. Overall a wonderful beer with a wonderfull appearance and an awesome taste. So far I have been very happy with all the Ayinger weissen beers. They completely outshine most of the watered down US versions of this classic style. Too bad they don't come in a 6 pack. A bit pricey, but in my book completely worth it."
"This is my first Dunkel Weizen and I look forward to tasting more beers in this style. I would definately buy this beer again."
"Could've fooled me, this dunkel tasted like a normal hefe. Light, airy head that dissipates slightly towards the end. Strong banana characteristics that I like. I paid the usual, 2.59 at hollingshead. I really wish there was a way I could get these German hefes a little cheaper."
"D - Nice. Sessionable, though a bit strong. So a low paced session. I think this is my favorite dunkel weizen that I have had to date. It is actually one of my favorite beers in fact, extremely well rounded. It is more pronounced than the others of the style. It seems to sit somewhere between a dunkel weizen and a weizenbock. I find this place to be quite pleasing. I will definitely make this my dunkel weizen go to beer."
"Pours from a bottle into a pint glass with a rocketing white head composed of large bubbles a frothy soapy look. Rises quick and falls just the same. Color is murkey carmel brown. The smell is strong with bannana, plums, dates...sugary fruits. Strong yeasty bannana with a tinge of organic almost leafy aroma. The taste is very full, sweet and enjoyable. Interesting for me as I am not familiar with the style. A nice taste but different. The mouthfeel on this one is again full, possibly a bit overcarbonated with a tiny bite on the tongue. An overall drinkable beer but not one I will stock in the fridge. Nice if you are looking for a sweet entry."
"Hazy burnt copper color with some sediment retention and a big frothy head that shrinks to a thick topping. Smells like dry banana bread...light bubblegum and clove. Light banana in the flavor with some spicy wheat. There is a soft maltiness in the finish. Very lively yet dry and a little tart. Pretty good."
"I like."
"This beer was easy as hell to drink. Overall, a great beer drinking experience."
"When the Germans say: Paulaner, Franziskaner, sonst nichts they forget something . . . Ayinger. Man, this is one heck of a beer. Delightfully fluffy wheat character balanced out by munich malts in a burnt-orange brew. I drank this guy so quickly, I got a tummy-ache from the carbonation. Couldn't recommend it highly enough. Yummy."
"Incredible dark wheat beer. One of the best i've ever had. Great opening smell and flavor, but not as typical as a regular wheat beer. It has an incredible head (if poured correctly) but not as good as a typical wheat beer. It has the typical traces of coriander, but not strong. One of the best beers in a bottle I've had in Dallas, and definitely worth recommending."
"Pours into the weizen glass in fell swoop. Cloudy dark orange with a medium white head that falls to a table; no lacing; plenty of active carbonation visible at the surface. Could smell the banana bread during the pour, but afterwards the smell was much more subdued, astringent and not exactly inviting. The taste was full on malty smoothness that swells, literally swells, into a full banana attack. Just delicious. Mouthfeel is medium and fills out splendidly. This is a very drinkable brew, but I'm not sure how much banana flavored maltiness I could take. Love this one."
"Pours to a fantastic dark, mellow color which looks almost exactly like unfiltered apple cider, pour takes time with the head fizzing crazily which releases all the wonderful fruity banana aromas. I thought this beer smelled and looked better than it tasted, the taste was actually somewhat bland and simple with nothing that really excited my palate although it did have nice legs and the aftertaste is where the fruitiness is most present. Possibly true to style it basically tastes a bit sweet and malty with just barely enough bitterness to balance things out. mouthfeel is how it looks, ciderlike. I must say that I was really excited to try my first dunkel-weizen but this was somewhat of a let down, Unfortunately the wonderful aromas simply did't translate well onto the toungue."
"Pour a hazy dark amber with loads of carbonation; the pours takes some time but I eventually end up with a massively rocky head peaking about an inch from the top of the glass. The aroma is spicy, suggesting oranges, cloves and vanilla. Rather full-bodied for a weiss with a sort of creme brulé maltiness that leads into an orangey-tart finish accented a slightly chalky dryness. Excellent smooth mouthfeel adds to the appeal of this beer. Overall, a fine dark wheat with outstanding aromatics, good flavor, but the finish could be better."
"Very creamy with quite a big body. Even though it's well carbonated, this beer feels like a smoothy going down. Very soft on the palate, though it is by no means flat. Drinkability is huge."
"mmm. Yum. Tall 1 pint bottle. This poured a nice hazy orange-copper copper with a huge fluffy tan/white head. The lacing just washes down the glass like you just washed the glass with rain-ex. The smell is awesome. Just amped up when compared to the others i have had of this style. It tastes like i am drinking a banana. It even irritates my mouth like real bananas do. The flavor also contains an assload of banana, wheat, clove and bubble gum flavor. The mouthfeel is interesting, almost right in between watery and syrupy. Watery syrup. Yeah. I like that. It is sorta sticky too. Very drinkable. I am starting to think this is my favorite style."
".5 liter bottle. For a dunkel weizen, this beer doesn't look all that dunkel. The color is a partially hazy brown copper color. The head is large and creamy. The aroma is cloves, banana, nuts, and chocolate. Nutty malt flavor, but not as rich and malty as most dunkels. More fruit flavor than I expected. I would like if this was thicker with more malt and cocoa. This beer is still well above average, and the drinkability is great."
"Very good initially then the resin and toasted grain aftertaste secures this as a good craft beer."
"Overall a nice dunkel but not spectacular. I paired with spicy sausages, grilled peppers, and cheese. I grilled the meat and peppers in a sauce of pesto, olive oil, and liberal lemon juice. The lemon and pesto in the dish went perfectly with the beer. A very nice meal if I do say so myself. Cheers!"
"Overall: Another new offering from Ayinger that I have not tried before, cost $2.59 the same as the Bräu-Weisse; but given a choice between the two with just three bucks in my pocket I would rather go with the infinitely better Bräu-Weisse again I think. Not that bad, but a bit of a cardboard cut-out in character."
"Yum."
"Drinkability: Pretty damn good. Ayinger is a consistently good brewer, but this isn't my favorite for their portfolio. Their standard hefe-weiss is actually a little more grounded than this beer. Having said that, I still found this to be a nice beer to kick back with."
"Poured heartily into a 0.5l Weizen glass. Nice deep golden color that was accentuated by the frothy and long lasting head. Smell was as expected for a quality German Weizen -- bananas, cloves, but with a further hint of fruitiness that was fully manifested upon tasting. The taste was truly exceptional with the flavors being more developed. I especially enjoyed the almost cola like flavors that the beer imparts. The creamy mouthfeel and well balanced carbonation only furthered the beer drinking experience. This is no ordinary Weizen. Definitely superior to Ayinger's Bräu-Weisse if you prefer a more complex beer."
"This is my first dunkel weizen. Poured into a Ayinger glass, hazy yellowish/brown color with a huge head and carbonation. I was figuring a dark color, but I guess not. Lacing is very present with a medium feel. I really like the taste for a dunkel. I could drink a few of these, for a dunkel weizen, it's very drinkable."
"Ayinger Ur-Weisse is a hazy, mid-range brown shade with plenty of carbonation. The head is large and creamy with very good retention. The aroma is strong of clove with an underlying malt smell. The taste is diffenently stronger of clovey yeast flavor than the past few dunkleweizens I have sampled. The underlying malt body is tasty and helps finish a sip with a sugary sweet burst. Mouthfeel might be just a little thin to be great, but the drinkability is top notch. I found this to be a very enjoyable dunkleweizen, the stronger yeast flavor enabled Ayinger Ur-Weisse a degree of individuality from the standards I've tried."
"Body is medium, mouthfeel is juicey and slick with ridiculously big bubbles of ample carbonation."
"A good all-around dunkel weizen...it doesn't stun me in any particular fashion, but it's tasty and easy to drink. Solid."
"Mouthfeel is right about medium, nice feeling dunkel. Drinkability is good a nice example of the style."
"Perhaps a little lighter than expected, both in color and body, though this does not detract from the beer. Went very nicely with my sesame chicken."
"Pours a nice lite coppery color. Huge white head. High carbonation level. Very clear for style. Bready,banana aroma. Slightly phenolic. Malty upfront. Somewhat clove like flavor. Nice mouthfeel-very full bodied. A very drinkable beer. While not a fan of weiss beers per se this is very nice indeed. I look forward to some warm weather to have a few of these."
"Tastes very fruity, yeasty, and bready. There is some definite banana flavors in there, plus citrus. The banana flavor lingers on for quite a while. There is some spicy herbal stuff going on as well. I can also detect some wheat-bread like flavors somewhere in the background. Really nice beer, one that I would love to have again. Awesome introduction to the style."
"Pours a murky light brown like an ice tea. Has a billowy white head that settles down to a thin layer. It smells of fruity esters and has a lot of citrus aroma (orange and a little banana). The taste follows in that it is fruity as well. Tastes of sweet orange, coriander, and a mild hop finish. The mouthfeel is good. There is a medium-heavy amount of carbonation. I love this beer a lot. Very drinkable. I would definately recommend it, especially on a warm summer day."
"A really nice beer. I don't know why it took me this long to try it."
"Lots of little bubbles rise up in this lighter-brown, hazy brew. Big foam, off-white head on the top. Nice scent with the classic hefe characteristics along with some extra maltiness. Same for the taste, you have your hefe tastes with some underlying caramel notes. A bit thin, but the taste is pretty good."
"This is an all around ""good beer""."
"500 mL bottle. After opening, it began to fizz up, overflowing if you're not careful. It takes several minutes to fit the whole thing into the weizen glass because of the gigantic head. Very active carbonation with a nice 3-4 inch rocky head. It's deep amber before the yeast, and after it has a muddy water/dirty bong water look that you can't see through. Keeps a nice blanket of foam but almost no lacing. Smells awesome - bananas and clove spiciness with lemon that becomes more pronounced at warmer temps. Taste delivers same flavors, along with a little bit of caramel and some hops in the background. Almost tastes like candy when warming. The beer has a fairly carbonated, crisp feel even as it warms, but this adds to the refreshing qualities of the beer. I could go for another one."
"Pop the cap, and prepare for a huge eruption of foam, even from an undisturbed bottle. Pours a color that looks like coke mixed with mountain dew, with an eventual small creamy head on top of the beer. Lots of yeasty clove flavors in the nose. Taste is sharp with yeasty spice, with some sweet maltiness, and a decent hop finish. Mouthfeel could be more full, but doesn't detract from the beer. Except for the instability of the product, this is a very good beer."
"I feel this beer is about halfway between an ordinary hefeweizen and a dunkel hefe. The more caramel-like flavors of the darker malt is mostly absent. It's still an excellent, very drinkable weizen, though."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet wheat malt scent with some crystal malts. It is full of fruitiness and clove aromas; very nice. The taste is good. It has a dry, yet extremely fruity wheat malt flavor with a yeasty finish. It goes down easy and has a smooth malty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a real burp producer. This is a fine Dunkel Weizen. It has excellent aroma and taste, but the mouthfeel tanks. This is a good drinker despite being overcarbonated."
"I'm not sure that I like this beer quite as much as I like Brauerei Aying's standard hefe weizen, but it's extremely close. Ur-Weisse is obviously a quality beer that should have no trouble finding adherents from every corner of the beer landscape. I'll be buying it again, of that I'm sure. This just might be my favorite version."
"Pours DARK with minimal translucence. A lot of foamy head that lingers for awhile. Smell has malts, fruity notes. Taste possesses a lot of character. Smooth malts and wheat with pleasant banana flavors. Mouthfeel is extraordinary, very clean, full, and crisp. A very solid enjoyable beer any time."
"Head is off white and very large. Grain notes fill the nose. A couple different things going on in the taste. Smooth bananna, along with the grain. Mild sweetness from the malt. A great beer thats very drinkable."
"Poured a cloudy copper in my Weisbeer glass. Four finger rocky white head rapidly receded leaving no lacing. Smell of cloves and bananas. The taste is clean and refreshing. very balanced with no overpowering tastes that otherwise mar a clean taste and finish. A bit of citrus in there and some yeasty taste as well. I liked this beer but I think the The Ramstein Winter Wheat that preceded it spoiled me. I will try this one again later in the season when my fall allergies have dissipated."
"Light bodied and much less-gaseous than it appears. This is an upper-echelon dunkelweizen."
"Maybe a little more acidity would help it earn perfect scores."
"This turned out to be a very good wheat beer. Not only did it not look like a dunkelweizen, it didn't have the dark, caramel malt presence that a dunkel would normally have but I don't hold that against it. For me, this is like a Schneider-Weisse, where it is a weissbier with a bit of ""natural"" color to it. Good for those who like their hefes on the sweet side."
"ng"
"I am gaining appreciation for this style of beer, and this is an excellent representative of the style. It pours a light amber color with a large slightly tan head. The aroma is primarily wheat and malt although there is a bit of the yeasty smell and a little banana at the end. The taste is overwhelmingly wheaty with the normal citrus undertone but a real hint of clove in this one. There is a bit more bitterness than in many wheat beers. This has a nice solid body and was excellent to the very end, and through the next one as well."
"Cloudy yellow wheat beer. Sour wheat and corn and banana and honey-like malt/yeast combo, and brown sugar grains.. Sharp coriander and cloves, better with some juice or slice of citrus. Thin creamy mouthfeel. Lightly acidic. Mild carbonation. Malt and banana aftertaste."
"This is a good drinkable beer, but I am not sure I would reach for another when there are other Weisse beers I like better."
"A clear, copper-amber beer sports a big, off-white, noisy, bubbly head. The yeast pour turns the beer hazy. It has a spicy, nutty nose. It's almost cinnamon-like. Fruity bananas highlight the front. A nice, rich malt and foamy feel. The finish dries, with spice and nuts. My notes say ""zingertang", which -- although not a word -- is probably right. A slightly corny aftertaste. Delicious, spicy, grainsy, bananay."
"Overall, a good dunkelweizen that represents the Bavarian style well."
"Overall, this was still a quenching, quaffable example of the style. Still, it fell into a class below my benchmark for the type, the dunkelweizen by Weihenstephaner."
"Smooth and creamy to start with a great clean finish. Refreshingly different I will have this again."
"Only a negligible amount too much in the way of carbonation, but not enough to discourage me. Other than the carbonation, this goes down fairly smoothly. Overall, another great beer from Ayinger."
"When poured there is a big white head that drops out fast. Leaveing a glass filled with a cloudy dark amber beer. There is a light malt sweetness in with a great spicey aroma that is rounded out with a hint of clove. The taste was an excellent balance of citrusy sweetness along with the well pronounced classic banana and clove notes. This was a tasty treat for me which a savored slowly."
"Pleasantly sweet, delivers everything promised in the nose - cloves, banannas, & caramel - all wrapped up in a rustic wheat flavour. Slightly spicy finish from the yeast. Lively carbonation, & a heavy feeling body without actually being full bodied."
"D&N: My new favorite style of beer. Super tasty, wonderful aromas, this one has it all. Go get one."
"My first time with this style, enjoying it."
"Medium feel, sweet and a little tart. Just average drinkability, nothing great."
"I say some kraut and sausage is in order."
"Fairly flavorful but easy on the tongue, this drinks quite well, though seems a bit light colored upon reflection. Reminds me of Autumn, yet does a god job of pulling me out of the shy Spring I'm currently stuck in. Many minutes after finishing I can still smell this beer wafting around, and the roast apple/fig combo resides faintly in my mouth - good stuff, I enjoy."
"Very drinkable brew would go great with a spicy sandwich."
"Drinkability: Light mouthfeel and great flavor make it an easy drinker."
"Taste is very similiar to the smell. Fruity, wheat malt and banana. Cloves, pepper and add to that a light smokiness. Also light caramel. Mouth is a bit thin but has some sticky maltiness and lingers on the tongue. Smooth and silky. Really drinkable. I haven't had a Dunkel Weisse for years, since Germany but this one would have to rank up there."
"As a whole, this is a good beer which I would drink again but was definitely expecting more in terms of flavours, based on the smells. In its defence, it would pair very well with a good brie triple crème and a baguette."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a huge, foamy white head. The head settles and leaves behind a nice lace. Fruity aroma with banana and citrus upfront. Scents of wheat bread and spicy clove lie in the backround. Flavor begins fruity with banana and tart apple. The malt then says its part with soft wheat and light caramel notes. Spicy cloves balance and round out the beer. Medium bodied, crisp and smooth. Highly quaffable and not as sticky on the tounge as other hefes. Very nice dunkel."
"$2.29 for a .5L"
"Ayinger Ur-Weisse was a gold/ amber color with a big, long lasting head. There were bits of sediment floating around amongst the bubbles. The aroma was clovey and floral. The taste was medicinal with elements of cloves, hay, citrus, and caramel. It had good carbonation, some sweetness, and was smooth and fruity overall. The finish was slightly dry and spicey as well as a little yeasty. A pretty good beer."
"This is one of those beers I se every time I go to the store and think, ""next time"". Glad I finally picked it up."
"17 oz bottle pours a hazy brownish gold with an enormous ivory head that eventually relaxes into long lasting patchy lace. No sediment in the glass, but I left a cc in the bottom of the bottle. Nice aroma with lemon, grapefruit, and banana up front. Spicy cloves are also very noticeable. Anise is my first impression in the mouthfeel, but there's a lot of fizzy carbonation here. Taste is complex, with tart lemon, yeast, cloves, in the beginning. As it warms toward room temperature, the carbonation softens and sweet maltiness and McIntosh apples appear out of nowhere. Finishes neutral, perhaps a bit sweet malt, with no significant aftertaste. This is a very charming and tasty brew from one of my favorite German breweries. Definitely an unusual Weissbier that I highly recommend."
"Pours out hazy & golden, not quite what I would call ""dark."" There is a massive off-white head. Not much of an aroma here. Some grainy maltiness detected and some very slight fruitiness but that's about it. The taste is a different story. A good hefty dose (for a hefe) of slightly sweet malt starts things off. Then the cloves kick in big time, lingering on into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slightly thick, whith a sort of fullness and good carbonation. Drinkability is good, except for the fact that I just don't enjoy the sticky clove aftertaste of hefes - always detracts from the drinkability. Other than that, good brew."
"Sinkability  I cant believe that this was made in Bayern."
"[3.49 for a .5Liter bottle]"
"Poured with a sour hop, yeast, grain aroma, dark orange brown color, a very stylish head, light apple banana sour taste, typical of this style.I'm not a big fan of this style, but this is by far the best tasting one I've had. The balance is near perfect and it doesn't leave you with that thick tongue aftertaste, as do a lot of Weisse's."
"500 ml bottle. Hazy, orange-tinged brown body with a voluminous rusty-white head. Beautiful. Smells of smooth banana liquor, cloves, and tangy yeast. Taste starts with rum-soaked bananas, light toffee, and a little clove. Finish is tangy, wheat bitter, and yeasty. Thick mouthfeel for a weisse of this abv. I could drink this throught the winter (if there weren't so many great winter brews)."
"Oh joy a real dunkel weizen deep copper orange an almost brown tint but not quite, head forms full thick and creamy leaving behind huge collared rings of lacing after existing throughout the session with these 17oz. of yum. Aroma: Tart apple notes along with the classic clove scent from the yeast, candy like sweetness sharp malted wheat flourishing tame German hop aroma. Taste: Oh how I love wheat beers tart spiced up finish sharp sweet tone mellowed by delicate hops, this is a great beer really hits the spot. Moutfheel: Fluffy sprizy and highly carbonated nice all around medium bodied hefe. Drinkability: Oh yes especially if I were chilling in Deutschland it would be on like Donkey Kong me and this dunkel weizen would get along well maybe too well."
"Pours a tawny golden brown with bits of yeast, partially opaque. Topped with an effervescent off-white (toward brown) head. Scent of banana and yeast, with herbal/floral notes. Taste is clean and crisp with a lighter/ medium body and a satisfying dry finish. Not overly assertive, in either the yeast or wheat components. Really good. Seriously, the mouthfeel is refreshing and smooth, this one disapears about as soon as its off the palate, leaving hints again of banana sweetness but little yeast. I personally wouldn't normally have a handful of weizens in a row, but if I were forced (oh, no!) this would probably be my choice."
"Notes: Nine thumbs up."
"Taste is soft and mellow of banana and frothy malts, touch of lemon and clove, sweetness is light, citrus is flighty with a light but favorable carbonation with a mellow, nearly creamy medium body with a little touch of hop and dryness with clove hints in the finish. The yeast is showcased in this beer quite a bit, especailly in the smell, but with that aside its one fine easy drinkin' dunkel."
"Overall Impression: Drinkability is good; I’d take another. The yeast is a strong part of this beer. If you aren’t into the Weihenstephan flavor (banana like) you probably won’t enjoy this one. On the other hand, if you do, this is a fruity, lively beer that should be experienced."
"This is what I think of when I think of a dunkel weizen..a very nicely made beer and one I would drink again for sure..."
"This beer poured a orange/light brown color with yellow highlights, slightly haze to semi clear and well carbonated. It produced an off white head that was fairly dense and creamy, some lace present but overpowering. The aromas that came from the glass were soft, subtle and pleasant, I nosed fruit (bananas, green apples), spices (clove), light sweet malt, and some hops. Again all aromas were soft. The flavors were of wheat grains, spices (clove), fruit (banana), light hop, some slight citrus, soft bark, yeast, alcohol and some sweet malt. The aftertaste was light and wheaty. Flavors seemed to be more pronounced then the nose as far as distinction. A crisp, clean and refreshing beer. Light bodied. Carbonation has some bite to it, but other then that, it is a soft and well balanced beer. Good representative of its style and a good summer time beer."
"Flavor is spicy and clovey, with tons of wheat sweetness. Moderate banana and light bubblegum flavor, with a huge phenolic feel when you breathe through your nose. Light spiciness, and a semi-dry finish, with just a tiny dash of hops. Body is fairly full, with all the yeast floating around. Moderate carbonation. An excellent beer! I could probably drink this for the rest of my life if I had to."
"Cloudy amber brown appearance, medium fluffy head of pretty good duration. Laces in rings with some drips descending from them. Cottony aroma, a bit of apple pie spice and a light estery sense. Fruity flavors, tart apple and slighlty less matched caramel maltines with a long lasting impresion I get in many Wheat Dunkels. Shy of medium bodied. Minimal esters, fairly attenuated and crisp at the finish. To me, slightly more complex and less stifling to the tongue than many others per style. Pretty nice brew, in my opinion..."
"Murky orangish brown appearance. Nice looking head of about 1/2 inch and beige tinted white in color. Retention? Pretty good. Nice lemmon pepper and clove mixed in with some tangy wheat malt and darkened barley on the nose. The flavor is spicy, yet refreshing. A little banana clove action. And the slight chocolate and dark malt tones are held in check nicely and add the subtleties need for this style. This nicely carbonated brew has a medium full body and a partially dry finish. Nicely done dunkel weizen."
"A most drinkable dunkle..very very nice will try more of this style."
"This brew poured a medium sized head of finely sized white bubbles and a transparent brown body. It had a mild hop aroma if any aroma at all. Its malty fruity flavor finishes slightly fizzy. We paid $7.49 for this brew which was not worth the price IMHO."
"Pours a somewhat hazy copper/amber color with a big blooming head,the aroma is of roasted malt and green apple background,pretty interesting.The taste is spicey and a litle smokey with some lingering fruitiness in the finish.This beer has alot of different flavora,pretty complex and pretty darn good."
"Light brown color, large head. Aroma is malty with a slight banana nose. Light bodied dunkel. Mild taste, sweet malts, definite banana and clove flavor, slight hop bite. Fruity taste, apples and raisins. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is malty and slightly sweet."
"This brewed poured a medium-large white head with small-medium bubbles. There was very little lacing on the sides of my glass. Carbonation was observed rising to the top. It had a fruity aroma to it and it was a bit on the watery side. I did not notice any bitterness or aftertaste with this brew; however, I was disappointed with this brew as I expected it to be better since it is brewed by Ayinger."
"Pours a nice medium amber, cloudy with shaving cream head. Nose is a little citrusy and caramel. Mouth feel, good bite and velvetty and finishes just a little dry. Taste is exceptional. I like this as well as Weihenstephaner. Good citrus taste and malt. Finish is more malty and intense flavored. I love this beer. One of the best Weisen's you can get."
"It poured a hazy dark golden amber color, not the dark color I'm used to when dunkel is mentioned, with a very light tan head and not much lace for a weisse beer. The aroma of yeast and spices and banana's filled the nose and the taste was of tangy flavor of spicies and yeast, with some wheat flavor and banana. A nice refreshing Ur-Weisse."
"This beer forces you to slow down! It's a great sipping beer. My notes say, ""marvelous, spicy, raspy, yeasty and creamy."" That's not a bad summary. A good beer to introduce you to the dunkel weiss world -- it's a world that I want to explore more. Plus, Ayinger is a great brewery; their Oktoberfest beer is fabulous, and it's nice to see that it's not a fluke."
"Very cloudy, rather murky light brown colour. Like most weissbiers it pours with a large head. Plenty of cloves, ripe bananas, oak and hints of smoke in aroma and flavour. A little more hops for the aftertaste would have been good, but this is none the less a first class hefe-weizen. Recommended!"
"Decent brew, if they'll cut the price in half I'll buy it twice as often."
"Very good Dunkel Weisse, alot like Hacker Pschorr's, although I'm still partial to that brew. Nice dry hoppy feel to it, with fruit and floral tones. Perhaps not quite dark enough for my tastes, but all in all a very solid weiss offering. I am definately going to pick up some of their other brews to sample."
"F."
"Poured a medium off-white head that disappeared quickly.Dark cloudy copper color with some yeast sediment.Banana-clove smell,with some nice yeasty bread dough hint evident also.Very smooth and easy to drink,not too carbonated.This would go well with some ham and muenster on pumpernickel,horseradish,rot kohl,german potato salad...you get the idea! An excellent example of this style.Really liked the ""gemutlichkeit"" bottle cap."
"Pours a murky burnt orange color with lots of tiny yeast chunks floating about. A medium head forms and disappointingly leaves quickly. The aroma is very enjoyably fruity. What a refreshing brew! I notice apple flavor among the fruitiness character. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. The finish is dry and crisp like it should be. This beer will definitely be in my hands when summer rolls around."
"Pours with a beautiful amber color with a crown that is a thick tan head. This may not be the ""king of beers"" but is definitely a member of the royal family. This has a very pleasant malty nose that complements the fruity taste. The Flavor has a mild hop tone that finishes dry & clean. This is a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a cloudy copper, with a thick, but quickly disipating white head. Aroma is a mixture of cloves, some ripe banana, and grain. Flavor begins sweet and grainy, with notes of banana and clove lingering in the finish. Has a medium body and is quite smooth, finishing very wet. A very refreshing dunkel-weiss, one that I could enjoy all throughout the day."
"It's more or less just a standard dark, German-style wheat beer. The odor is of diluted Pine-Sol (not necessarily bad at all). It's got some subdued lemon character to the taste, and the head pours big (but fades quickly). It's a good beer by all means. It's certainly not exemplary."
"Has a nice frothy head and a apple cider color that was very hazy. Yeasty and sour fruit nose that was easy to sense coming from the large head. Has a great champagne mouth feel and goes down smoth. Tastes of sweet nut and malty ripe banana, also a dry with a teasty tart finish. Very drinkable and could enjoy in a long drinking session."
"Another beer that seems to remind me of banana nut bread. It pours a very hazy copper color and the smell is of nuts, banana, and malt. The taste had fruit and malts as well, nothing in this brew was overpowering. There was plenty of yeast to be seen in my sample. I do not know how much experience I have with this style of beer, but I found it to be a refreshing type beer. Overall, it's drinkability would be defined as easy and light."
" There was a tingling carbonation as you would expect out of a weisse. Following that, loads of citrus and yeast hit your tongue. The beer was very refreshing and smooth. The citrus was balanced by some malts that made it less bitter than the initial flavor. There was a lot of flavor, and the complexity was very inviting. As it is a dunkel-weisse, the subtle roastiness is evident after paying close attention to the flavor. You will pick up some dark malts just before the aftertaste of this brew. It is not as roasty and dark as I had expected, but it is still a wonderful brew by Aying."
"Slightly hazy and brown capped by a fizzy, fine, slightly off-white lace. The usual aromas associated with this type of beer: apples, bananas, some clove, but much milder than is often the case. Where some Dunkels are assertive and stinky, this one was more passive and elegant. Very fizzy in the mouth, but not over carbonated. The medium body goes a long way in this extremely refreshing brew. Tastes are in like with the aroma but with a small amount of toasted malt. While this is far from my favorite style of beer, it is always a welcome change from the thick, rich beers I often pursue."
"Deep copper colored liquid with a frothy ivory colored head that eventually settles to about 1/2 an inch. A scant amount of sediment floating around. Aromas of yeast, wheat, malt, and cloves. Smooth taste, nicely malty, clove taste is not too overpowering. As I look back at my reviews, I find myself liking this brewery more & more. Always available at my local store, good variety of styles, and the price is right. Recommended!"
"The beer was light brown in color with a moderately thick hear that lasted a long time. It had a very gentle malt aroma with a mild clover smell. There was no hop smell. The malt flavors were prominent at first sip but finished with a spicy clove flavor. There is no bitterness nor hop flavor. The mouthfeel was creamy and full and had a high carbonation level which tingled the tongue. Dunkle Weizen is my FAVORITE beer so I am a little prejudice, but this is probably the best of style and the best style."
"Pours cloudy yellow, nice thick foamy head, leaves a clingy lace in the glass, aroma of wheat and bananas, banana-clove yeasty flavor, some bubblegum in the aftertaste. Light body, clean and crisp, very refreshing another one of my favorites, always good."
"Pours a hazy light mahogany color with a medium-bodied white head that dissipates into a nice lace. Very fruity aroma with notes of ripe banana and clove. Sweet malts come through up front in the taste along with some fresh banana, clove, and nutmeg. Its quite crisp and a bit acidic feeling in the mouth with a nice amount of carbonation. A very enjoyable brew!"
"The beer pours a translucent amber color with a massive head with the texture frothy and the color and off white, the lace forms a fine shade to cover the glass from view. Nose is quite complex with aromas of malt, citrus, wheat or bread dough, sweet as it the start with the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is sparsely acidic, pleasantly hopped, dry long lasting aftertaste and all in all a very drinkable beer."
"Overall, an outstanding beer. Pours as a hazy amber with a good head. Great smell that screams drink me. This one really turned me on to the style which is now one of my favorites. It has a nice fruity taste with a hint of cloves. Very smooth and will continue to be a big player in my beer rotation."
"Hazy orange color with a thick light beige head. Some carbonation. This is darker in color than any German Wheat I have had so far. Fruity aroma. I was kind of unimpressed with the taste. There was a definite apple cider feel to it, but it really lacked follow-through. Probably the coolest bottle cap I have seen. What is in the trees, matryoshka dolls?"
"Thick off white head, strong carbonation - pour slow.  Good wheat, with expected slight yeast overtones.  Nice maltiness, finishes smooth.  The ABV is 5.8%.  $3.49 for 500 ml."
"A fine Old Baverian Dark Wheat Beer that goes well with food or just by its self."
"Dark rich color. Fruity esters with tones of clove. Medium body with a bouquet of fruity flavors and strings of clove. Again, the clove presence is noticeable, as it is ubiquitous. A low hop profile. Overall a nice dark beer smooth and crisp. A good texture adds to the beers drinkability, however the beer in totality would better served by lees carbonation."
"A drinkable Weiss, for sure, but falls short of a good Dunkel. Plenty phenols and appropriate lactic-hefe vibe, yet not enough malt depth to achieve darkwheat status. In the end, tasty, but lacking."
"Pours a hazy light brownish with an initial creamy head that sinks far too quickly.  Great fruity nose with banana and possibly apples with some light spiciness of cloves but not too much.  The brew starts off very fruity with banana and some slightly tart, possible apple flavors before going into the sweeter side and hitting up the malt.  There are some lingering chocolate tones towards the end and you are left wanting more.  Nice full mouthfeel with just the perfect amount of carbonation that makes this brew very drinkable.  Yet another great german hefe here, I would certainly suggest this."

"Ayinger does not know how to make a bad beer. This is another great one, with an apple-cider/tea color, a choppy head that dissipates, and a leathery aroma. I like the unusual, impenetrably cloudy appearance but it may put others off, and the leather-glove smell is weird but I liked it. The taste is great - tangy, fruity, spicy (cloves), hints of vanilla, banana, apple, and perhaps clay? Finish is delicious and makes you want more and more, while refreshing your thirst at the same time. I've never had a weisse quite like this and I loved it for its uniqueness, although there is a vague plastic quality that might bother others. But to me Ayinger can do no wrong. I imagine this beer could go with anything, but it made me especially crave a medium-well hamburger."
"A nice pour with a good, lasting head and attractive color.  Smell and taste are sophisticated yet well integrated.  A tad heavy for a wheat; an excellent pairing with a meal."
"Pours a cloudy amber / brown color, with a huge, creamy, off-white head. On the nose there is complex fruitiness and almost gives off a tiny hint of smokiness (I could be wrong though). On the palate there is traces of bananas, cloves, apples, and pears all rolled up together. This isnt my favorite style, but I do enjoy one during lunch with a good meal. I havent had many dunkel-weizens but this has to be one of the better versions I tasted. Overall good brew!"
"Okay, this beer has a nice light amber color to it and slight aroma.  The head is a medium tan, but it didn't hold, but I don't know how long it had been on the shelf.  Interesting flavor with a slight tang to it."
"brew."
"Light brown, hazy color similar to iced tea.  Slightlyt sweet, thick tan head that tastes of apples.  Low bitterness and fairly well balanced.   Enjoyed the Erdinger dunkel weisse more than this one."
"98"
"Notes: A well built dunkel hefe-wezien ... quite drinkable to say the least. One of the better imported dunkel hefe-wezien. Did some one say lunch time brew ... pair it up with a smoked ham and munster cheese on rye."
