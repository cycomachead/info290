"This is a favorite of mine.  While not inexpensive, I think it's a great value and a bit meatier (more interesting) than a straight-up hefe-weisse.  It's ""dunkel"" for a wheat, but a beautiful amber in the glass.  I recommend it regularly."

"Great dunkel for a great price. Perfect for a warm afternoon."
"Pours a cloudy murky reddish brown with a tightly bubbled off white head that shows moderate retention. Aromas of banana and clove with hints of spice, light fruit, and earth. The flavor is fruity and spicy with clove and banana dominating. Light yeasty earthy flavors come in as well. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a bubbly sweet mouthfeel. Nice dark Hefe, a bit bubbly for my tastes but they usually are."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Really nice head, no real lacing. Nose is sweet and bitter. Bready with a bitter and sweet component. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"O - My first Julius Echter beer, and definitely not my last. This far exceeded my expectations. It was sweet, creamy, balanced, and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tons of banana flavors present in the caramel colored liquid. A velvety mouthfeel helps this beer go down smooth and often. A great grilling companion on a perfect summer night."
""
""
"A top-notch dunkelweizen, no doubt. Highly recommended. Now, to continue enjoying this alongside my fig and prosciutto flatbread!"
"O: Pretty decent as far as the style goes, but it didn't wow me. It felt a little flat, but it in all fairness it did have a pretty rough journey in the trunk of my car for a couple of days."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I wish I had drank this when it was fresh, but I'm not complaining. Still a nice beer."
"Price Point - $10.99/4pk 16.9 oz bottles"

"Yeast esters and wheat are well represented. Not a standout in any particular area, but a characterful brew that's worth a try. Apple becomes overwhelming as it warms."

"Overall: a good dunkelweizen. I've had a lot of dunkels that are overdone, with too-high alcohol and too much phenolic messiness; in contrast, this is a clean, quaffable brew. I'd definitely have this again."
""
"Poured from a bottle and served in a weisse vase, the beer is a bright, hazy, golden-orange coloring with a thin, filmy, white surface coating of head. Aromas of banana bread, biscuit, and tangy fruit sweetness. Flavors are rich and round initially, with a banana and clove forward flavor that ends up sharp and frothy due to a light body and increased carbonation. The aftertaste is fruity, as well, with some subtle citrus highlights and a grainy undertone. Sharp, effervescent finish that cleans the palate, but is a tad bit rough overall."
""
"O: Not perfect, but pretty darn good -- Everything a Dunkelweizen should be! Seriously drinkable alone, or with a lightly-spiced meal. I'll not hesitate to get another at the next opportunity."
""
"Beer is medium bodied with mid-level carbonation; foams up slightly, giving a pillow-smooth mouthfeel. Semi-dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a 2 inch foamy light tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, spices, yeast, and some slight dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is still tasty a good 6 months after its best before date."
"Nothing earth-shattering, this beer does what it should."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into a Paulaner hefe glass. Looks amazing. Light brown colored body, with a huge creamy head that looked like creme brulee. Smell was disappointing. No real hefe aromas present as with other German brands. Taste was good. Nice balance of dark malt with the wheat. Mouthfeel was thin, so I would have liked it to be a bit thicker. It's a fine beer to look at, but the taste overall was just decent but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad beer. I was looking for a little more malt body, but it's still a good beer that I would buy again."
"The carbonation is almost on par with most popular soft drinks, but even with that in mind, it's a pleasant, easily-quaffed brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice crisp and clean brew. Very easy to drink. Maybe just a little too mellow. Cheers."
"O/D-For $2.75 for a 500 ml, this is a decent deal. I don't love this beer, but I appreciate the value. It isn't bad at all, but its no more than a mellow brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's pretty good, just muted all over (again, yeast?). Primarily tart and yeasty (can't avoid it)."
"Overall it's a decent session beer because it's drinkable. It looks and smells great but I won't bother putting it in my fridge again."
""
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass, best before 2012/02. This pours a hazy amber color with a massive white head. The smells are of sweet yeast esters, banana and spices. Feel is medium to light with high carbonation, taste is a little lighter than expected, wheat, banana, spices, not bad though."
""
""
"Pours a caramel brown color. Aromas of Bavarian yeast, noble, flowery hop and straw. In the taste, smooth clove and muted fruit notes. Caramel, sugar, and faint banana bread. There is little bitterness. Crisp, somewhat smooth finish. Overall, a nice dark wheat beer and goes down easy."
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed this dunkelweiss and look forward to trying many others this upcoming winter."
"Overall - Excellent smooth beer. My personal feeling is that this is a professional and classic beer. Only if I could find this in a six pack for a Friday night."
"O - Not bad a 2.99 a pint bottle. I remember this being 4.99. At this price you can't beat it. A good wheat beer for sure."
"Drinkability: Good stuff, but I think it is a little on the sweet side."
"Overall nice but probably not a repeat buy."
"O: not very impressed with this one and probably won't be going back. Unfortunately the smell and taste were a bit boring and didn't make for an enjoyable experience."
"O: This beer is a real soft easy-drinker. Nothing really jumps out at you to make this amazing but the dunkel aspect makes this more interesting than a standard Hefe. This was priced very well at $3 for the 500ml, so I'm glad I picked this up. Nice value."
"For the taste i can only say one thing; flat all the way. No beer to drink a second time."
"This beer poured out as a hazy dark brown color what had some orange highlights around the egdes. The head was fluffy and tan typical of the style. The aromas were of banana, some clove, some raisin and a hint of yeasty wheat. The taste was decent, there was the typical wheat beer flavors along with some toasted flavors as well. There may be some fruits in there as well. The mouthfeel is smooth much like other beers like this. Overall it wasn't too bad but I think there are better ones out there."
"This is a pretty tasty beer for a sessionable 4.9% weight. I'm impressed. There's a big cinnamon raisin aroma with light candied bread behind it. The body and flavor are a touch on the thin side, understandable for the lighter alcohol. The flavor has more a of date and plum taste, similar to a dark Belgian ale, with hints of the wheat malt and a slight spicy rye bread taste (though I'm sure no rye was used). I'm not usually a big fan of this style, but I'm digging this beer. Sure it drinks more like a dark Belgian ale, but it's damned tasty. I'll take another."
"Notes: Overall it’s a good solid Dunkelweizen with all the good classic German flavors."
"Overall - Not impressed. Don't hate it, but won't spend another penny on another bottle. Would drink for free."
"3.59 at total wine 500ml bottle"
"O - An outstanding drinker. I prefer this to the Julius Echter Hefe. A solid example of a good dunkelweizen."
"After other dunkels I think I was expecting a bit more in the smell and taste. I am not disappointed but this is just more like a wheat beer than I expected. I marked down on smell because it seemed rather lacking (again, not a bad thing)"
"500ml into a snifter. Pours a deep brown, almost black in incandescent lights with a massive head that doesn't want to go anywhere, just sit there on top of the brew like a fat top of goodness. Nice and cloudy too. Gorgeous. Man, the Germans brew great beer. I realize this isn't a favorite style of many people, but I love it in the spring and it's delicious. The nose is big and reeks of excellent lager funk that gives it kind of a banana like nose with the alcohol. The taste doesn't disappoint either, it's got a great sharpness from the wheat with a substantial and complex malt profile. Hops balance it just right but don't get in your face. Perfect after the big IPA I just drank, great contrast. Mouthfeel is like a semi-sweet loaf of rich bread, tons of texture. Leaves lace all the way on the glass as the head subsides a little and I drink some more. Very drinkable at this ABV. Wonderful beer. A classic of the style. Highly recommended."
"Very dry, off putting, and dull. Certainly a beer you could have a few of but at 3 bucks a bottle, why?"
"This is a very drinkable beer. Not the best but a good solid pick for a dunkel Heffe. I will definitely pick this up if I see it again."
"Drinks well but one was fine with me."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"A very drinkable beer, but nothing extraordinary."
"Very drinkable, I could happily swill pitchers of this in the summertime."
"Easy to drink, once you fight thru the head. Solid drinkability right to the last drop."
"D: Different than how I remember this beer, had a nut brown before tasting this but a favorite of mine when going out for german."
"D: High, but not what I wanted from this beer."
"A solid dunkelweizen that doesn't do anything wrong, but doesn't have that any one distinctive flair that sets it apart from the rest of the dunkelweizens. A brown that's more murky than just regular weizen cloudiness, with a fine cream-colored head. The aroma is notable for the baked bread aroma, and more clove than fruit. Flavor faithfully follows the aroma, with hops finally putting in an appearance to keep it balanced. A little less carbonated than I'd expect for a weizen, but the hops still keep it balanced. Overall a nice beer that reminds me of south German bierkellers."
"Drinkability is good, goes down smoothly, pretty refreshing."
"D. Eh. I picked up a few imports today on the recommendation from a friend who lived in Germany and grew to love German beers. I was much more impressed with the Kolsch than this."
"Drinkability: Not in the top echelon of the style, but a decent beer; would like to see more banana and less clove"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is rather thirst quenching."
"a enjoyably savor dunkelweizen that has a dry qualities to it but quite a mild palate. nose is floral wheat and apple pie... a touch of buckwheat. palate is subtle and wheat malt predominant. not sweet at all for a dunkelhef. taste of cameralized apple with... dry and mineral earth with sugar extracted. when its too old this seems to drain out all the other favors with a predominant sour finish. when fresh... there is sufficient hopping to clear the palate and provide for the delicate roasted flavor. apple. clove. and very mild grassy lemon bitter... mind you quite subdued citrus. great beer on the delicate side."
"I could see myself drinking this outside in the early evening on a lazy summer day. While I wouldn't mind having it again, I don't think I'll be revisiting it anytime soon. It was good, but didn't make me want to keep going back. I was expecting something more."
"Mild clove and wheat aromas greet the nose, with a bit of brown sugar and baking bread. Just a hint of banana, which becomes much more apparent in the taste. The wheat is much more assertive as well, a nice lemony bite. Fresh bread and toasted malts are on display from midswallow on. Nice hearty mouthfeel; it seems to 'fluff up' throughout the sip. A pretty tasty dunkel that's worth a try."
"Drinkability is very good. Very tasty beer."
"Moutheel is spritzy, medium bodied, caramel laden, toffee, Heath bar flavors lingering."
"D: Very refreshing, a bit more flavor profile than the JE Hefe-Weissbier. Stands up on it's own or would go well with a cheeseburger on the grill."
"From the 500 ml. bottle with a date of 2010/06-08:24. Sampled on March 27, 2010. The pour is a dark amber color but slightly cloudy. The head is thick and puffy. The aroma tends to be malted but there us also an aroma of charcoal, toast, and perhaps molasses. It is not unappealing. The mouthfeel comes in at about medium-to heavy. The taste has toasted bread or biscuit notes, grains, and a stale sort of maltiness. Even though use the word ""stale."" that does not describe it. It is better than that. I just wouldn't put it up high on my list of go to beers."
"From a 500ml bottle. This beer pours to a nice dark amber color with a little head. The aroma is very light, almost not there. The mouthfeel is decent, medium thickness. There is only a light wheat flavor which I was expecting it to be a bit more robust. Not very exciting."
"More impressive on the tongue than in the nose, with a light, grassy bitterness that balances well with toasted caramel and wheat malts. Yeasty esters add spice and a hint of tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a big, weizen-y carbonation level. Smooth, with a tinge of bitterness on the finish. I wish this beer was as impressive as its appearance, but it's still quite the tasty Dunkelweizen. Give it a try."
"Carbonation is gentle and this is lighter and cleaner on the finish than I was hoping for; quite quaffable though, which I suppose is the purpose. Maybe a better summer beer, as is the cliche with hefs. Pretty good overall, not super-memorable, but they can't all be. I'll keep an eye out for deals on this one and give her another run when the sun comes out."
"Give it a try, very nice for the money."
"drinkability: if youre into these kinds of beers youll like this one. it is not my style but i acknowledge this is a good example of the style."
"M/D: One of the best dunkelweizens I've had the pleasure of drinking. Perfect carbonation, stays prickly on the tongue all the way to the end. The sweetness might be a bit too cloying, still, a great beer for a low price."
"Thanks sstacko!"
"Cloudy tawny colour with a fluffy beige cap. A bit sticky with good head retention. Aromas of banana, bready yeast, a bit nutty, light caramel and clove. Tastes kind of thin and without the fruitiness present in the nose. Roast malts dominate, giving it a dry cocoa and caramel flavour. Minerals, bread, yeast. Medium body with slightly high carbonation. Grainy, dry texture. It's certainly not bad, but the flavour really didn't live up to the promise of the aroma and didn't quite hit what I expect in a dunkelweizen."
"Pours a orangish tan color with a thin tan head. Nose has fruity malts, wheat and herbs. Taste also quite sweet with crisp fruits and herbs. Light to medium body is well carbonated. Not the most complex Dunkelwiezen around, but a nice refreshing session beer."
"all night all day drinkable with a clean neutral finish."
"A solid Dunkel and drinkable all the same that would go great with any food and sessioning of other beery sorts."
"Easy to drink and pretty tasty as well."
"D: This a decent dunkel, just not interesting enough for me to come back for more."
"Drinkability is good. This style isn't my favorite but I'd drink it again."
"smells of banana, clove, and some wheat. sweet taste, refreshing and light. additional hints of caramel and possibly bubble gum in the flavor. medium body, lighter then i expected though. smooth creamy feel."
"Decent brew but I don't want it again."
"The taste is very nice. It is a tad on the sweeter side, but it is a very characteristic dark wheat ale. The green apples, some clove, some caramel, some brown sugar, the prickly mouthfeel, the slight tartness, and the wheaty smooth feel define the beer. The beer is a bit watery as is characteristic of the style, but it has more body and mid section than most wheat beers. The taste is refreshing, light bodied, easy to drink, with no real aftertaste, or off mouthfeel. This is a really good representation of the style and one worth going back to as a standard bearer. L'Chaim."
"D - This is a great ""go-to"" brew. Sessionable with a lot of flavor."
"This medium body wheaty tasting beer is solid, even if it didn't have quite the spice that maybe I was expecting. I will definitely give it another try at another point."
"Mouthfeel is slightly chewy on this medium bodied brew. Still smooth enough to easily drink with a nice moderate carbonation. Not a bad beer and one I would try again."
"An explosively carbonated pour results in a huge tan head. Retention is excellent and a splotchy, chunky lacing is left behind. Color is light brown like a glass of tea. Some spice, faint light fruits, and some metallic notes rise to the nose. Tastes of wheat, malts and more light fruits. Really not much going on. Mouth-feel is light and the expected creaminess is not present. In fact, it borders on dry going down. There's too many exceptional dark hefe's out there to spend too much time on this one."
"D - I have tried over 10 dunkelweizens and this one reigns supreme. It is exactly what I look for in a dunkel and could drink several of these in a sitting. Long live the JE DUNKEL !!"
"D: Very, very good. Easy drinking and low in alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is a tad wet, but firm overall. Flavor was a little weaker than I was expecting, but good nonetheless. Some warm bready flavor with hints of brown sugar, slight fruitiness, and finishes sweet. Drinkability is high on this beer. There is nothing harsh here at all. Just a well-done Dunkel that is mild and tame. Recommend."
"This is a really nice beer. But I'm not sure it's the best dunkelweizen I've ever had. Pleasant sipping, and high drinkability, but not something I plan to return to much in the future. Still, at below 5% ABV, it's a totally sessionable beer if you want it to be."
"Slight bitter and a hint of metallic with a fantastically clean finish like a lager. Carbonation is just right and it is not overly sweet. A great beer for any day and would be great with smoked food or bbq."
"D - Not a bad beer at all have had better but it would do nicely worth trying sometime"
"Very nice looking brew here with a cloudy brown color and a thick light tan head which has pretty good retention. No real lacing. The aroma is very inviting with wheat, banana, clove coming through. The flavors are real good here. Malts give a nice roasty flavor that seems to give it a slight caramel and nut like flavor. Also a nice banana flavor here reminds me a bit of bread. Seems to be a little spicy on the tongue which is nice. Overall this is a solid brew, nothing out of the ordinary here but well done and very drinkable."
"Poured in a weizen glass for a somewhat cloudy copper body with a one-finger head. A spicy, clove smell with citric notes, mostly orange, with hints of dark fruit and caramel melt. A medium-bodied beer that is smooth, almost creamy, with a proper mix of spices and fruits such as banana, orange and some sweet malt and bread malt for a balanced brew that is fruity yet maintains a spicy edge and has some fullness and sweetness. I could session this anytime."
"Pours a good brown color,cloudy. Good sized head, tan, lasting. Fresh effervescent aroma, malty, earthy, woody, but not too strong. Effervescent malty taste. Oaky, malty, fresh taste. Fresh aftertaste. Orangey and dark fruit taste. It has a nice taste. Good."
"D - Perfect for year 'round enjoyment, with or without food. The alcohol's in check (along with the price), so enjoy - I know I will again!"
"All in all a very nice dunkel and cant beat the price at $2.50 for pint plus bottle. I could drink many of these for a dunkel which i ussually stop after one."
"D: Refreshing, light yet flavorful dark wheat beer. Very enjoyable and very affordable."
"Prosit!"
"All in all a great session beer."
"D - Not to bad but not something I will ever really want again"
"Drinkability: Very refreshing style, tastes great, low ABV, and goes down great. Solid example of the style, recommended"
"D: A solid dunkel. I prefer this one to the Echter hefeweiss. Very tasty and easy to drink."
"Pours a murky orangish brown with massive fluffy head. Head lasts forever, but not much lacing. Smell: cloves, wheat, banana. Taste: sweet upfront, banana and yeast, finishes wheaty with a touch of spicy hop / sour grain. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, soft carbonation. Good stuff."
"Oktoberfest celebrations were happening up in Lincoln NH during Columbus Day weekend. I had this from its bottle. When poured into a glass, it had a typical dunkelweizen look: dark brown-black look with a medium, frothy head. Malty, roasted flavors permeated from the drink; really potent of almost dried fruits and slight coffee hint. Taste was wonderfully sweet and milky. Not too heavy though; the drink had a good, light cream aspect to it. Overall, a great dunkel."
"Good first timer, but weaker than others I have tried."
"D - Very smooth, balanced and easy to drink. I don't drink many German beers and this one has me wondering why not."
"D - An easy drinker for sure. The relative dryness actually helps this brew approach session status with the love ABV. Something I'd love to have again."
"It has a lot of great characteristics. The smell brings me in, the taste brings me back. But after a few mouthfuls I find myself filling up on it. I definately find it drinkable, but it is too filling to be a session beer."
"The beer poured a murkey brownish red color with a slightly off-white, but huge, head that was well retained. The aroma was light and a little malty. The taste was good, followed the aroma, malty and bready with a hint of sweetness. The beer had the right carbonation for a dunkel and it was a medium body that was very smooth and very easy to drink. Very good session beer."
"A cloudy looking beer that pours a huge head! Only head I've seen bigger is that of a Boddington's. This has a strong citrus, almost melon taste to it. Definitely something different from what I'm used to. They served it with a lemon but there's no need for that. I discarded that quickly. It was very expensive so I might not get it again but overall I thought it was pretty good and definitely refreshing."
"Good brew all around."
"I could drink these no problem. Would I buy these again? Yes."
"Sub-par in my opinion. The burnt wood character detracts. Something I will pass by next time I see it."
"I had this gem at H.J. Heley's in St Augustine. I love a good dunkel and I couldn't pass it up on tap. Served chilled the official pilsner style Julius Echter glassware. Had a wonderful, rich rust color with a decent white head. Smell was of bready, yeasty, sweet chocolate goodness. First sip yeilded a wheat burst with a velvety smoothness then the banana esters kicked in with some candied sugar and a touch of chocolate on a crisp finish. Good to the last drop and a real treat."
"Cloudy orange in color with a full, dense foam that morphs into plateaus. Very nice aromatics, with clove, banana and spice notes. Flavor doesn't have the fullness of flavor that would make it outstanding, but it has nice flavors of vanilla and ripe fruit. Could have more depth and more weizen characteristics. It's just okay."
"D'ability - Hefe yeast character quite subdued. Dark malt balances perfectly. Maybe the perfect wheat beer for wheat beer haters."
"drinkability is good its non offensive just not very exciting at all."
"Might buy again, but only after trying some other dunkelweiss' first."
"Drinkability. Good easy drinking dunkel."
"Cloudy orange-red with a frothy white head that laces nicely. Great wheat aroma with a little malt. Taste is a clean, light drinking blend of wheat, banana, and subtle malt. Mouthfeel is again clean and crisp. This is an incredibly drinkable beer, with no strong alcohol aftertaste (not surprising at 4.9%). A great choice for a summer lunch or an evening barbeque."
"good drinkability, aside from a little something off in the aroma, it's quenching, as these german wheat beer tend to be."
"Overall- Another Echter beer with subdued flavors. But, another Echter beer that still has a pleasent flavor, easy to drink, and is refreshing. Definitely worth the $2 I paid!"
"Overall a pretty tasty beer and a good example of the style. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat if it's on sale."
"This poured a hazy brown with only some head. It had that typical wheat beer scent that I can't quite put my finger on (wheat?), with tones of malt. It tasted like caramelized malt and a bit of hops bitterness. It had the typical wheat beer aftertaste, along with the scent. The texture was pretty thick with a little bit of carbonation, but generally fairly smooth. Still not my style, but overall it was better than most wheat beers I've had."
"Worth a shot, but certainly not the best representation of the style..."
"A very solid dunkelweiss. I would have preferred a little more dark roasted malt character as well as more banana and clove flavors, but then this would not have been such a great beer to enjoy in session."
"D: Quite nice drinks, could be another potential session drink. It seems like it might be a little burpy, but it's a nice and light, well flavoured brew. I might personally prefer their other hefe, but I am growing fond of this brewery."
"D: A little low abv wise for a dunkel (4.9) but overall drinks very nicely and is well crafted and clean."
"Nice in the mouth with ample carbonation and a bit of pepperyness to go with that dunkelweizen oilyness. Not bad, a drinkable ale."
"This is not a bad beer. It's decently drinkable, but I can think of others I'd head for first."
"I still think this bier is WAY overpriced at 10-14 bucks a 16.9 oz four pack but when im in the mood, i want it."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is enough to let you know it's there and drinkability is A+, very easy to drink."
"If it's any help, my cousin in Darmstadt prefers this stuff."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Pours a hazed amber ruby with a tan head. Nose is malty with a touch of acorn. Flavor is meaty. Almost like biting into the flank of...something. A tree. Thats it. Its like biting into an old, aged, hearty tree. There is a strong earthen tone to the flavor profile. Feel is decent, though it seems to me almost a bit watery. Carbonation is nice, but like I said...a bit thin. Drinkable, yes. I am not very familiar with the style quite yet, but this is a pretty interesting brew. Might take someone with a bit of a developed palate to appreciate it though."
"Poured from its pint bottle into my glass, it has a earthy-brown color with typical wheat cloudiness. The head is comprised of white, little bubbles which dissapated quickly leaving moderate lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is made up of carmelized barley and fruit esters with little or no hop presence. The flavor is initally sour, but quickly blends for a balanced, medium bodied finish. There are traces of clover and toasted barley in the flavor, but not the yeast ester I typically look for in bavarian dunkels. That being said, I thought it was an all around decent wheat but not a standout for its style."
"D - Pretty good, I could go for this on a regular basis. All around impressive brew. A definite recommendation."
"Cloudy dark amber with some aggressive carbonation and an off-white four fingers of whipped goodness. Nutty to musty malt aroma, light fruit, herbal hops, and some sour wheat notes for a nose. Hearty nutty toasted wheat flavor with an assertive sour lemony citrus and low sweetness that increases slightly as it warms. Sour dough breadiness in combination with the citrus notes balances well with the dark malt. Mild herbal and bitter hop character is careful not to step all over the wheat character. Smooth mouthfeel with a mild carbonation and a pretty clean finish, slight dryness, and sour bread."
"I would have to measure it up to other dunkel to see a difference in the style."
"Ein prosit der Gemütlichkeit!"
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a fruity hefe scent of pale and wheat malts along with the German hefe yeast, but there is a sweet crystal malt element as well. It's not overly sweet, but just enough to let you know it's there. The taste is average. It tastes like muddy water. There is a weak crystal malt flavor laid over a pale weiss taste. It's got a light sweetness and a fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average Dunkel. I'm not impressed with the taste at all. I'm not even sure this is a good weiss minus the crystal malts. These guys should add some more crystal malt and call it a day. The mouthfeel is way too light and the CO2 is way too intense."
"Drinkability: It was another decent affordable German beer, but I don't think I would ever go for this one again. The appearance and smell was there, but the taste and mouthfeel was just off. If I'm ever looking for a Dunkel Weizen and it's the only one I can find, I will continue to look around."
"Pours a pretty, ruby-russet color with an off-white head that is fine bubbled and fluffy. Sweet dark-fruit smells mingle with a faint banana note, but the aroma lacks complexity. On the palate, big carbonation first off, then some nice acidity and lightly fruity malts. Just a touch of spice in the background. This is smoother and more rounded in the mouthfeel than its hefeweizen cousin. Overall, this is a solid but uninspiring dunkelweizen -- it's got a nicely rounded mouthfeel and some easy drinkability, but not the depth of flavor I expect from the style."
"Drinks easy, a nice example of dunkel from a brewery in of the prettier German cities I visited. Those looking for a huge yeast signature may find this lacking"
"Overall: An easy drinker, good looking, but not a lot of pizzazz. Good refreshing thirst quencher, unassuming, but not much to bring me back. Worth a try."
"The flavor is a big array of banana flavors, with some other mild fruit flavors, oak, spices (cloves, coriander), sweet syrup, and just a slight bite of alcohol. As the beer warmed, these flavors formed a beautiful cohesion. Mouthfeel was medium, slightly chewy, but clean. This beer is a bit filling, but overall a great dark hefeweiss. I really enjoyed this beer and would buy again."
"D - A little too bitter for me, could be more smooth overall, but it is a German afterall. Pretty solidly to type."
"D - A little bit filling. It actually reminds me of a roggenbier I brewed. Something happened where there wasn't much fermentable sugar so the hefe yeast didn't impart any flavor and I was stuck with a very malty, very full bodied beer. This dunkel is not what I'd expect from a Bavarian Hefe."
"D: Drinkable, yet not as much as other Ive had. I probably wouldnt get again and would stick with another."
"This one was only a notch or so above average all the way around except for appearance. This thing had huge bits of sediment in it, and sediment/debris holds alot of weight with me with certain styles. The dissolving chunks of yeast make for a particularly cloudy brew, which also means alot to me in certain styles. This may be the nicest looking dunkelweiss I have seen in a long time, perhaps ever! Medium copper brown with some sediment and a huge, rocky off-white head that lasted forever. Smell was fairly par-for-the-course for the style, although I got exclusively spice/cloves and no banana on this one. Taste was yeast, dark cereal, and spice. I liked it. Mouthfeel was very smooth, but so is the mouthfeel for nearly every other dunkelweiss. A good beer and a great style!"
"Pours transparent golden brown with a quick-to-receed creamy head that settles to a thick foam and lace. The nose features toasted caramel malts with touches of banana and nuts. Some herbal hop notes are also in play. The flavor is less pleasing; somewhat defective. Sugary carmel is strong at first, but this is overshadowed by a sour diacetyl and phenol-laced finish. The medium thick creamy body is stingy with carbonation. Not especially note-worthy."
"Pours a muddy brown color with a decent off-white head, not much lacing. The smell is light clove, metallic. The taste is malty sweet with hints of spice and clove. This brew tends to be more on the malty side, I can hardly detect any of the hefe qualities. The feel is light and fizzy, maybe a bit over carbonated, finishes quite dry. A decent sample for the style, not my favorite, a bit too dry."
"A nice, easy-to-drink, tasty classic dunkel!"
"Man it has been a long ass time since I have had a Dunkel Weizen, one of my favorite styles of German beer. It poured into a weizen glass from Magic Hat a murky caramel color, with shades of light and dark all around. Head was huge at first, then faded into a lacing that remained right up until the end of the glass. In the smell was the distinct aroma of warm baked banana bread with blueberries. There was also a light clove presence. My God the smell was lovely. Taste was spicy in the beginning, and then sort of doughy in the end, not what I would call extremely balanced, but that is what made it all the better taste wise. Body of this beer was light to medium, and ever so drinkable. The low alcohol and sheer delectable nature of this beer make it a great session brew. I could see myself knocking back three bombers of this and still wanting more. This is a fantastic beer. Right up there with the Weihenstephaner Dunkel Weizen for me. It would pair well with lots of cooked meats I bet."
"Overall a delicious, refreshing brew, and a great example of the style. It's like I'm back in Munich, and I love it. I will almost certainly be buying this one again, it's really good."
"Big half-liter German bottle - brewed with wheat and barley malt, hops, and hop extract. It pours into the weizen glass a dark, ruddy brown with medium carbonation and a two finger, light beige head that leaves mild lacing. There is a big banana and bubblegum aroma, with tangy wheat, clove, chocolate, and maybe even some smoke - very nice. The flavor adds to this green/grassy and fresh-cut-hay hops and, unfortunately, a touch of paper/cardboard oxidation. It has a highly-carbonated, light body that evens out quickly and leaves a short finish. Not too bad - definitely worth a try, especially if the bottle is a bit fresher."
"Mouthfeel was smooth until the swallow then some interesting zestiness. This was my first dunkel weizen and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
"Mouthfeel- an earthy hop bitterness is tasted but it immediately gives way to the sweet bready malt and yeast flavors. Some clove-ish notes are detected. A good froth on the palate and it stays the same with a little bitterness surfacing on the finish. Excellent tasting brew and if not for the color I would think it was a regular hefe-weizen. J.E.'s regular hefe-weizen is excellent and this style is an equally good offering. As it warmed up the banana and yeast flavors bloomed and I almost felt like I was sipping it fresh in a beer garden in Germany. Very tasty and sessionable."
"I'm not sure what to expect from this style, as I've had limited experience, but here goes. The color is a dark brown-orange, with golden highlight. A very thick head formed as I poured the beer into my Duvel tulip glass, and the off-white bubbles remained until the beer was gone. I noticed an immense amount of sweetbread in the aroma, along with a mild fruitiness and hay. The flavor is quite fruity upfront, with a bit of cherry followed by essence of banana. Freshly baked bread dominated the aftertaste, which lingered for about a minute after swallowing. It's not a full-bodied beer; the texture is lean, but that's what I've been told to expect from this style. I should try more of these to further expand my palate."
"I am by nature not a fan of weissbiers, but I must admit that I really enjoyed this beer. The yeast strains offered a nice flavor and aroma compliment to the roasted wheats used in this beer. Normally I just don't care for the aftertaste and spiced character of hefeweizens but this was indeed an exception. The brewers create a best of both worlds feeling with enough mouthfeel and rounded flavors without the imbalances I tend to find in weizens.Drinkability was good and this is a solid beer for occasions that call for a flavorful, but lighter bodied beer. Prost."
"D - Very crisp and clean. More of a warm weather beer. I could see myself throwing down many of these at Oktoberfest. Please refrain from throwing in a slice of lemon."
"Julius Echter Hefe-Weiss Dunkel pours a murky brown with a huge off white head from a brown 50 cl bottle. Some banana and some clove in the aroma, but also some bubblegum. The mouthfeel seems a little thin, but the taste is pretty good. Not much of the banana and clove thing (there is some), but tropical fruit and bubblegum flavors are present. Don't get me wrong, this is definitely within style, but not necessarily what I'm looking for in a dunkel weiss. A bit tart and pretty drinkable, this is worth a try if you like the style. Not my favorite of the style though."
"JE, like the Franz, has a nice creamy mouthfeel. Very full and coating which really helps to push aside the carbonation. I think that the Fraz is better in this regard, but the JE was very nice as well. Drinkability is just fine. I could down this in big gulps. While I do think that the Franz was the more outstanding beer, this one is no slouch either. In fact, this will score a bit higher based on the weight of Taste."
"another awesome beer from mr. echter. i love the way this beer looks. light caramel brown color, cloudy, good carbonation. does resemble banana bread in taste but i seem to taste more of a clove mixed with lemon kind of flavor in the finish. all together great although i don't have a ton to compare it to as i'm a realitive newcomer to the style. i really dig wheat beers and i'm a huge fan of dark beers too. this seems like a nice middle ground and a great beer to pair with anything."
"Poured from the bottle to a brownish-red with good carbonation, and a thick off-white head that stayed atop the beer throughout the entire drink, and reduced to excellent lacing up and down the glass. A mild aroma of wheat bread, and at first some clove spice, which faded by mid-glass. Flavor was more of the tasty, bready wheat. My only complaint with this beer was the very thin body, which led to a watery palte. Beside thatr, this was a darn good beer."
"I've had better dunkels but I'm at a loss to find serious fault with this one. Satisfying and a true example of the style, I can imagine that Bavarians are rightly pround of Mr. Echter."
"Drinkability: Could knock a few back."
"This is a very good example of the style. Goes very will with the waning fall temperatures in Texas."
"I would revisit this one on any given occasion...a solid brew to say the least."
"Drinkability: Refreshing. Great summer thirst quencher."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied and well carbonated. This is a very easy to drink beer. The beer is easily sessionable. This is a very good beer drink and I will drink more at a later date."
"Drinkability is good but I might want to grab something else. Prost und Zum Wohl! MK"
"Smooth, carbonation was barely noticed except on the tip of the tongue. Not flat, just that smooth that it slid by. Medium body. A damned good brew!"
"Light brown in colour with a fair bit of haze. Strong aromas fo banana, and sweedish berries candy, along with a hint of vanilla. The roasted grain element is quite restrained, and the banana and vanilla flavors dont get too overwhelmed. Theres a bit of a minty hop finish on the end too, which is an elegent touch. Great heavy body on this one too."
"Pours a cloudy rust-and-copper color with a dense head. Despite nice lace, the beer had modest carbonation and a dwindling foam (for the style). The aroma has an enticing mix of bubblegum and clove, citric-like wheatness, and a touch of bread-like toasted malts. The beer has a tangy and tart taste thats notably refreshing. Theres a notable yeast flavor. The beer finishes a little drier than expected, which gives it a crisp and refreshing quality. Pretty good, but not exceptional."
"Super-ultra-crazy drinkable, with a mere 4.9 ABV. Seek it out."
"Pours out a cloudy, brown leather. Head comes out light brown but then settles to quickly. Smells malty and of chocolate covered bananas. Flavor is predominately of the dark malts: chewy and nutty. The phenols are not very intrusive but they could have had more of a presence. Kind of tart and wheaty in the finish. Pleasantly carbonated with a decent body, but it leaves my mouth kind of sticky. This is a pretty nice dunkelweizen, but not the best I've had. Certainly this is a better offering from Julius Echter than their weisse hell."
"This is a pretty good dunkel weizen. It pours an attractive, hazy reddish brown, with liitle light making it all the way through. There is a nice head that recedes to minimal lace. The smell is pretty sweet, and is smells like (suprise!) fermented wheat. It tastes bready, with strong bananas and a little cloves. There is also a touch of cherry sweetness, although it is not as sweet as the smell led me to believe. It is pretty refreshing, but the sweetness tempers the drinkability. On the whole, it is very clean."
"Murky brownish color, hazy and definitely not clear, some off white head, some lacing. So murky. Smells lemony and wheaty- as it should. Not too much else. Tastes wheaty, banana-y, some vanilla extract, a bit tart and spicy, and some tart apple in there. Mouthfeel is full and sudsy, slightly slick. Pretty drinkable, very refreshing. Quite nice."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It is clean and has a nicely reserved ester profile for the style. The wheat edge is definitely there, and makes it more refreshing. I personally think that it was OK, but there wasnt really much to set it apart. I like the fact that it is so clean, but this could be considered a flaw."
"Poured a huge, light brown colored head fades slowly leaving a strand or two of lace. Hazy, dark copper colored beer. Soft yeasty aroma with a big dose of banana, but I was also expecting a bit of cocoa. Highly carbonated, and fairly crips mouthfeel. It's really lacking flavor. There is a bit of lemon, and some light malt or possibly wheat. I'm a big fan of dunkel weizens, but this one is just lacking."
"Got to love the classics. A good dark German wheat always hits the spot when you want finess and flavor. Looks murky and muddy. A wheat texture with an amber color. Good proteins yeild good head retention and lacing. Smells lightly malty with barley but mostly wheat. Toasty, yeasty, estery, and light in the scent and flavor. Light clove, bananna, and bubblegum hide in the moderately toasted flavors. Very clean and refreshing. Finishes crisp without drying. A good session beer."
"16 ounce bottle."
"Interesting blend of malts, melon, molasses, and yeast. Tastes nice. Light to medium bodied. A nice beer. Definitely worth another try."
"Murky brown color. Pours with a huge foamy head. OK lacing. Tons of carbonation. Smell of bread with a slight banana note. Banana bread taste. Nice yeasty note with a nice level of maltyness. Supper active carbonation on the tongue. A little thin on the finish with no aftertaste to speak of. A nice beer for a style I'm not supper familiar with."
"The mouth feel is light in body and is actively carbonated."
"Pours hazy medium brown with nice fluffy white head that became creamy-like as it settled,quite clovey on the nose with a bit of iron and banana.Nice smooth,lighter mouthfeel almost creamy in nature,well rounded dark wheat flavors clovey with a touch of green apple lightly sweet a touch of iron underneath.Light and refreshing but definently not wimpy I am liking this style more and more and this one is helping me convert more."
"I poured this beer into a mug from a bottle. The beer pours a hazy dark brown with a 1 inch + head. It has the aroma of malt, bread, and spices. It has a nice yeasty flavor with hints of winter spices, possibly cloves. It taste is very rich and creamy. Nice. I do love a good dunkle weizen."
"This is still better off tap (which is what led me to buy some bottles) and even better on a hot day."
"Bottle: Poured a dark cloudy brown color dunkel with a huge foamy dirty brown head with pretty good retention. Aroma of banana with hints of cinnamon with sweet strong malt. Taste has notes of banana with some sweet malt but not much bitterness is discernable. Creamy texture is really enjoyable and body is fuller then average."
"The flavor was rich and caramely with overtones of sourdough bread. Almost like a spiced carmel coffee, with no coffee flavor, if that makes any sense. It had a quick aftertaste of bitter apples. This was my first Dunkel, so I didn't know what to expect. I was a little taken aback, as it was not what I thought it would be, but it started to grow on me and by the end I was interested enough to want to try more of the style. I will definatly be on the lookout for my next Dunkel."
"poured a medium-brown cloudy color with absolutely monstrous tannish head that refused to depart. Smell is tremendous, with strong notes of spices, cloves, bananas, and other summer fruitiness. Taste is initially a strong assault of bread-like maltiness with enough sweetness (caramel) to make it interesting. Very smooth and creamy. Finish is toasty, toffee-like. A truly excellent beer. One of my favorites."
"Medium body, and easy to drink. Not as good at the Hefeweizen, IMO, but a decent offering."
"D: Not all that remarkable."
"Nice aromas, good flavors, yet nothing remarkable. Good enough to try again if it presents itself."
"The color is a hazy dark brown. Head is large, creamy, and light brown. Carbonation is moderate. The aroma is a very inviting combination of dark bread malts with a spicy clove aroma mixed in throughout. Taste is sweet, more cookie malts than bready, with a nice yeasty flavor throughout. Clove flavor adds to the complexity of the beer with a welcomed spiciness. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy which aids the overall experience. Drinkability is excellent, give me one or more of these anytime."
"In my humble opinion, this the standard (Bavarian) dunkel hefe weisse."
"Pours a dark amber color with a big fluffy white head. Smells of bananas, cloves and sweet malty wheat...Tastes like more of the same, with a slight astringency in the middle and a clean, sweet, crisp finish. Highly effervescent, of course, and medium bodied. A great dunkel. I think the hefe is a little better, but this is still a winner in my book."
"Last swigs: This is the Dunkel model. Banana custard."
"Prosit!"
"This one pours a very cloudy brown color with a tall head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is spicy, but has hints of clove and maybe some apple. The flavor has a bread feel to it. Some banana flavors as well as some spice from the yeast. It has a medium body and is pretty easy to drink."
"Not a bad beer, but a little odd for the style."
"Decent dark weizen, though I prefer the more phenolic end of the spectrum."
"This wasn't a bad beer at all. On top of that, it was pretty cheap too. I think it was like $1.25. The taste was a good wheat taste to it, mixed with a ""spritz"" of a citrus taste. It was cloudy and dark, with an off white head that was pretty thick. Kind of a chewy thick body to it, which is a good thing. More on the malt side of things, with little in the area of hops. If your looking for a strong ""conversion"" beer, this would be my pick."
"This poured a cloudy tan, with rich foamy head that retained nicely, smell was banana and clove, spices, the taste was nice and banana like, but not as rich as other dunkels I've had, cloves and spices also. mouthfeel was perhaps a bit light, good carbonation, drinkability is great, I would buy these again, but there are definitely a couple others in this genre that are superior, still a nice dunkel, better than most."
"This beer is okay but nothing really special for the style."
"16 ounce bottle, no freshness dating to be found. Poured a dull, cloudy brown. Light tan head, initially large and puffy, it settled down to a long lasting film and left some lacing. Yeasty, bready nose. This is a pleasant brew, nice take on a very tasty style. Yeasty, nutty flavor notes, also chocolate and cloves late and more as it warmed. Chocolate milk shake flavorings with a kick. NIce dark wheat"
" A smooth and easy drinking brew."
"Update - I hadn't even seen this beer in about six years then caught one at me local beer store and decided to take a second look. The mouthfeel was much better which led me to believe I just may have gotten a bad bottle before. The head again was a beautiful sight, even for a weizen, the yeast continued to dominate throughout, and with the better carbonation and lighter feel I took my rating up a few notches."
"This beer pours a cloudy brown color, before adding the yeast from the bottle. The head is nice and big, about 3.5 fingers high. I have to wait for it to fall a bit before I finish my pour. The yeast darkens the beer a little bit and the head falls to about 2 fingers. The nose is dominated by the sweetness of the wheat with the estery banana hiding behind it. As the beer warms, the banana comes through more. I like how this beer tastes. There is a nice balance between the wheat and the banana, neither one taking the lead, but both of them coming in first. I like it. The beer is thick and creamy from the yeast, just what I expected. Drinkability is high for this one...better than I had expected. It is not sitting heavy as I would expect from the thickness. Each drink makes me want another. That is good in my book."
"Murky brown like unfiltered apple cider. Heavy yeasty smell. Thick, dense, creamy off-white head that looks as luscious as ice-cream and puts up a stubborn, bitter barrier to the beer. The beer is mellow and malty with undertones of banana and spice: clove, cinnamon, and vanilla. Creamy mouthfeel. Tangy finish. As it warms, I also warm to it, and somehow it tastes great with this roast beef I'm eating. I could have another."
"One of the best dunkel-weizens I've had. The malty finish is what I look for in dunkels assuming the requisite banana/clove thing. Cleanly fermented, easy to drink, with a nice body and great taste. I would seek this one out again."
"This is a good drink, I would order again."
"Muddy orange color with a thick head that looks like the puffy head of a root beer float that eventually settles but takes its time. A nice yeasty fruit flavor (banana\clove\even a bit lemony) but not strong. Goes down very smooth, not as powerfully sweet or carbonated as other Hefe-weisses. There was a ton of yeast in this bottle (it settled for a week at my house and I still found yeast in the bottle neck,) accounting for the cloudy\dirty color (if you like the added yeasty flavor). Not much of a smell from this one, but very drinkable. I'd grab another one of these in the future."
"This is like writing two different reviews, one about the first pour, and the second with the yeast swirled in. Initial pour reveals a clear, mahogany(orange when held to the light), and an enormous, rocky, ivory colored head. Huge sheets of lace are left behind. Second pour is decidedly hazy. Tantilizing aroma of banana and clove, backed by grapefruit and some more spices. The second pour, obviously, adds some yeasty bread aromas. Mouthfeel reveals a smooth, medium body with active carbonation. Taste is plenty malty for me, with some hints of chocolate and wheat bread. The spiciness noted in the nose is also prominent in the flavor profile. Unripe banana lends a citrus note, as well. Yeastiness takes over the finish, with fresh baked bread being overpowered by an earthy, mushroomy, finish. Aftertaste still retains plenty of sweetness. This was surprisingly complex, and difficult to review. If you're opening a bottle that has been sitting for a few weeks, you will get two different expereinces if you pour the top half first. Swirling the settled yeast, for the second half, is going to change things considerably, in appearance, taste, and aroma. Personally, I preferred the first half for its clear appearance with mostly sweet taste. The addition of the settled yeast during the second pour will tame down the sweetness and add an earthiness that many may prefer. A very fine Dunkel Weiss, here..with some notable characteristics."
"Drinkability/notes: A surprisingly excellent example of the style, very substantial, and sure to please."
"This brew pours a cloudy, orange-tinted brown with a massive, rocky head....take care in pouring this one folks! The aroma is of overripe bananas and with a little bit of clove, but the smell takes some effort to pick up. Banana flavor shows up dominantly in the flavor backed by a fair degree of sweet breadiness which stops short of cloying; a tea-like twang from the yeast breaks up the sweetness. A good example of the style, but I expected a little more maltiness. Perhaps it's my own faulty perception but I expect the Dunkel Hefe's to have a more developed maltiness than their lighter brethren and this one is a little on the light side."
"Not as good as the regular Echter hefeweiss. Too sweet."
"This is a murky brown beer with excellent off-white head and good retention. The aroma is of mild yeast and fruitiness, but not particularly strong in this segment. I would prefer a bit more strength of smell. Taste is quite good, but somewhat watery compared to other beers within the style. Mouthfeel is also slightly thin compared to expectation. Not bad, but not strong. Because it is slightly thin, it maintains better than average drinkability. I like this offering, but I feel there are better dark Hefe's to be had."
"The nose is yeasty and speaks also of a nice malt base. Plenty of chocolate notes mixed in here as well, along with hints of dark fruit. The flavor is of subdued cloves with bits of chocolate malt mixed in. The feel is smooth but thin and a bit watery for my taste. Good drinkability on this easy drinking beer."
"This is a real good dunkel, and fits right in with the best of the style. Nice chocolate undertones, with the typical large, foamy head, and clove and banana notes. Nothing to stand out over the other top examples, but as good as any (other than Aventinus). If you like the style, definitely try this one."
"Pours a light brown with yeast haze the head was prominent till it collapsed on to itself. Smells yeasty with a slight fresh cut grass smell. Very sweet and slightly caramelized sugar touch to it. Hops taste earthy and there is strong beady yeast flavor touched upon by pumpkin pie and other spicy esters. Nice smooth mouthful is easily drinkable and very tasty a must try."
"Didn't see that coming..."
"This is a great representation of a dark wheat beer. It is a very dark brown color with a big thick ivory head. The head dissolved quickly to a ring around the surface leaving a few spots of lace behind. An aroma of clove, yeast and bubblegum floats over the beer. Each sip of this medium bodied brew begins with a mild clove taste which is quickly followed by fruity banana flavors, bubblegum and yeast. There's a wheat malt taste in the background holding it all together and mild flavors of banana are left behind after each sip."
"Easy to drink."
"Just a great easy drinking beer."
"This beer pours a hazy(from yeast) dark slightly reddish brown with a large bubbly off white head. The smell iw of sweet bubblegum and mild bananna. The taste is mild clove, bananna like grainy and swett with a very, very mild hoppiness. The mouthfeel is slightly silky(again the yeast) and slightly rounded. Overall this is a soft, smooth pleasing dark wheat that is VERY drinkable."
"Note to self: Don't forget how much you like dark wheat beers. Nearly as dark as coca-cola and cloudy with a massive rocky head atop. Aroma is big and beautiful, clove, wheat malt and and a slight nutty aroma. Beer has a highly effervescent crispness to it and a medium to full body. Terrific flavors of spicy grainy malts are delicious. One of the better Dunkelweiss biers."
"For the BJCP style ""dunkelwiezen", I'd give this a 4.9 out of 5. Pretty much a primo example of the style."
"Reasonably drinkable and quite tasty, more so with some schnitzel, onion rings, and pretzels."
"This weiss was particularly hard to find. I've only ever found it in one store. It poured a pleasing dark color, with a nice, thick head. The beer smelled particularly inviting, and I was expecting something really great. However, the actual taste was a bit underwhelming. It was tasty, but a little lacking in flavor when compared to a Weihenstephaner. Overall, this is a solid dunkel-weiss, and was priced around $1.50 cheaper than Weihenstephaner. I definately recommend this, as it is a solid beer."
"Cool, this beer is ok. Warm, it's very, very good."
"Pours a cloudy brown with an incredibly thick head that takes forever to settle, eventually leaves a shaving cream like texture. The nose is fruity and excellent hops, with a hint of some yeast. This one has a very fruity malt flavor with a subtle citrus taste. Hops at the forefront followed by the very smooth malt flavor. This is just an excellent beer. This is easily in my personal top 10."
"And where is that extra yeast??"
"The beer poured a cloudy medium brown, sepia like, with a quick forming light tan head, that rather quickly subsided. Drinking did not reveal much hop flavor, but it was definitely fruity. I have read others mention banana flavors and they were correct, but I didnt expect it be as strong as it was. It felt full, while also light, in the mouth. It appears to be an excellent example of the style. Its definitely different and I will attempt to try the versions made by other brewers if I can find them."
"The beer pours a dark brown with a fair head. The head retention is poor particularly for style. There was a hint of malt in the nose a slight clove aroma. The beer was not super cold and the head died quickly. So I suspect the loss of head may have reduced aroma. The spicy, fruity flavor was prevolant but did not overpower the malt flavor. There was no hop bitternes or flavor and no buttery diacetyl flavor. The beer had a very creamy fullness and had a moderately high carbonation level. The beer was overall very good. It is very drinkable and I would recommend it to someone as a good Hefe-Weiss Dunkel. It is not the best but very good."
"Pours a dark brown color with a very thick and frothy off-white colored head. Nose is sweet roasted malts and dark fruits with a hint of caramel. Ripe banana, sweet malts, and dark chocolate come through in the taste with some citrus/lemon notes. This is my first experience with this particular beer, and I have to say that Im really enjoying it! Ill be purchasing more in the future."
"Cloudy brown in color with a half inch off white head. Bananas and yeast are the first things that I notice in the smell. Very carbonated and explosive on the tongue. The bananas are again present in the taste and after taste. This is the first time that I have had this style and I have to say that I am very impressed. I bet this stuff is amazing on tap in Germany!"
"Cloudy, reddish-brown with orange & crimson highlights. The cream colored head is fluffy but tight; composed of tiny bubbles. It thins but holds a solid surface covering to the end. The aroma is lightly fruity and sweetish with some bubblegum and light toffee. The body is light/medium with a very fine and lightly effervescent carbonation that leaves it gently zesty in the mouth at first; then becoming creamy as it warms. The flavor starts lightly tangy, becoming sweet as it crosses the palate, and displays soft bubblegum and caramel in the finish along with some drying bitterness, a light smoky phenolic and some gentle clove. Although it's well balanced, throughout the glass the sweetness and clove have a tendency to build on the palate. A well-brewed dunkle weiss with some nice character and a good drinkability, but not a leader in its category."
"Formidably thick and persistant, stiff peak - like, ivory white head is supported by copious bubbling.  Hazy dark bronze in hue.  The signature clove and banana yeast esters are coupled with mellow chocolate, wheat tartness and slight mustiness from the yeast.  A light caramel sweetness rounds the aroma out.  In flavor, tart, grainy wheat quickly yields to banana and light bubblegum esters coupled with a very smooth dehusked chocolate malt foundation.  Caramel sweetness is light, and partially offset by the mild hop bitterness.  The body is perhaps a touch thin and not quite proteinaceous enough to lend a viscous mouthfeel, but this beer remains crisp enough for good drinkability.  Finishes clean w/ residual sweetness quickly fading.  This dunkel weizen possesses all the necessary characteristics of the style, but adds no outstanding qualities of its own.  Quite tasty and refreshing nonetheless."
"A pretty well executed dunkel.  Loads of banana in the aroma, which carried strongly through the flavor, and was well integrated with the slightly acidic tangyness.  Mouthfeel was almost creamy, perhaps from the liberal dose of suspended yeast."
"Notes: A tough style to brew right, this brewery seems to have this one down pat. Very palatable and a pleasure to drink, perfect blend of malt and tartness. For me it is an other great choice of a lunch time brew."
"109"
"Once again I am dissatisfied with the dunkel. I'm looking for the serious malt spine to complement the tart fruitiness of this weissbier, and frankly find it lacking. Don't get me wrong, any hefeweiss drinker will like this beer, but if your going to call it a dunkel..."
"Rich carmel color, decent head, little lace. Clove, yeast, with a hint of banana flavor.  Low carbonation, very smooth.  Well balanced beer. Very nice mouthfeel.  I especially enjoyed the lip and face numbing effect this beer has on me.  Almost no lingering aftertaste ."
