"An extremely easy drinker. No real faults, the lack of smell is a minimal issue in my book. The style hasn't always been high on my list of must haves, but this beer may enter my normal rotation of drinks."

"The proprietary yeast is not close to being what a weiss should represent. Would not purchase again."
"A decent take on the style, perhaps a touch heavy on the malt, but certainly worth a try."
"Pours a warm and inviting clear brown tinged with golden red, almost mahogany, with a fairly decent light tan head. Aroma is strong, yeasty and wheaty with a hint of citrus. Pleasing flavor is mainly wheaty with hints of fruit - mainly pear and apple plus a subtle note of orange - and wood. There is also just a whisper of cloves. Texture has average body but plenty of fizz, leaving a persistent tingle and a fruity, wheaty finish."
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a slightly hazy chestnut with a mediocre head that fades to a thin cap. In the nose, you get some notes of banana, some lemony citrus, and the barest hint of clove. Definitely on the lighter side. The taste is also a bit light , but there are nice notes of banana and clove that grow as the beer warms. Smooth and spicy in the mouth. Definitely on the lighter side for a dunkelweizen, but smooth and pretty tasty, especially on-tap."
"Overall, I'd say this is a ok brew. I got it discounted at the store, and I'm a fan of Great Divide, but I'll stick to their IPAs and stouts."
"Pours a muddy brown color, as the bottle describes it, visible carbonation. The head disappointed me a bit, most wheat beers present much better head with good retention, this one had a decent head, but retention was poor. Smell was of clove, wheat, brown sugar and a little bit of raisin. Taste is great, as far as American made dunkels go, this is pretty good in the taste department. Sweet wheat taste with just a little bit of alcohol present in my nose as I sip (since the head has now fully receded) the taste is good, but would not stack up to something like weihenstephaner. Overall, a decent representation of the style for an American brewer, but there are better offerings in the same genre available to me that I would rather buy."
"D - pretty decent dunkel weiss beer...I picked it up for 1.79, which was a steal. I would stick to brewers across the pond next time I go back to this style. Pretty good though."
"Overall flavors seem a bit watered down and muted. Would not get this again at $7/22 oz."
"Drinkability: Great Divide isn't the first brewery I would think of when it comes to German style beers so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this one is a bit of a disappointment; the malt bill lacks the banana, clove and cocoa prominence I seek in the style; the beer is pleasant enough but not a contender when compared to the best of the style"
"O: Pretty drinkable but is somewhat sour and dries the palate as you get further along. Pretty unique; somewhere between a sour and a lager. I would say this is exactly what GD was going for. I don't think I'd want this often, but it's definitely worth trying."
"Overall impression: Doesn't look like much, but a tasty dunkel for sure."
"Fairly drinkable, especially for a wheat beer. I'd much rather have this than any of the other wheat beers sold out there!"
"Quite drinkable, though not quite as strong flavored as I was expecting."
"D: I am very disappointed, as I am a big fan of Great Divide and dunkleweizen...I will try it again sometime and update this post if necessary, as I find it hard to believe they would actually sell something this bad, it might just have been mistakenly over-carbonated"
"Tastes tempered malt that is wet, but counter-balanced by yeasty clove, nutmeg, some peppery zip (from hops or carbonation?) and a mild astringency that helps dry out the finish. Nice munich-type malt flavor late and lingering into the aftertaste. There is also phenolic cardboardy character that I find rather off-putting. Md body and moderate carbonation. Fair drinkability, would be moreso if I enjoyed the style. This bottle was a gift that I enjoyed trying, but won't revisit. Judged to style, not my preferences. Could use a light chocolate character."
"A good stab at this style...although I've always thought Great Divide was one of those breweries, like Avery, Southern Tier or Flying Dog, that excels with the bigger 8%-plus type of brews."
"Overall this is a winner that's not hoppy from a brewery known for hoppy brews."
"Dunkel Weiss is a very good German style wheat beer, tasty and very satisfying. I would expect nothing less from Great Divide however!"
"I like it. I can see drinking more of this."
"try again."
"D: While this one does have its negatives, it's still pretty drinkable."
"Poured into my Brooklyn-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse glass a murky russett color with a great fluffy two finger white head that settled slowly into a frothy mass leaving broken chunks of lace behind in its wake.Aromas of chocolate malt and clove mainly,much more chocolate than any other of the style I have had.I hate to say it but the flavors for me are average to below average for the style for me,mainly chocolate weheat malt flavors with light clove,no complexity or nuances.I love GD,one of my favorite breweries but this really doesnt hit home for me."
"D - Well, I could have had another one at the pub but I needed my hop fix and switched to a Smuttynose IPA so one was enough."
"I've found Great Divide almost always does a style justice, but this is one that didn't do it for me. Not that it's a bad beer, but it's a style I typically enjoy and I found this one to be a bit muddled and well overpriced."
"Pours a light brown with a two-finger head that takes forever to die and leaves minor lace around the glass. A funky roasted malt aroma and hints of bready yeast but not much sweetness nor is there very much in way of lemon/citric zest or spices. Light-to-medium bodied that for some reason has a smokey edge and while trying to combine with the spices and citric hops it doesn't mesh well. So basically a rather dry malted hefe with very little in the citric/spice taste category that is well-carb'd so it finishes crisp, dry but bland. Minimal sweet malts like caramel and very hard to notice pepper and clove in there as well. A nice attempt at this style but not very good and the price isn't exactly inviting me to buy another."
"Looks good, but smells a little weird and tastes a little weirder. There is this dominant smell/taste that is just pungent/borderline awful to me. I tried to be nice, because I think its on purpose, but I can barely get this down. Sorry. Very sweet, has characteristics of a Heffe/Belgian, again there is something pungent dominating this beer."
"D-phenolic and thin in the back lingering and bothering me. not a solid beer."
"Unlike a true classic Dunkel Weiss, but not unpleasant, as the rich sweet malt was quite good. Perhaps this should have been more accurately labeled as a ""Hazelnut Brown Ale""."
"Good yeast flavors mix pretty good with the malt and wheat bill. The palate brings the overal quality of this beer down a bit in my opinion. Don't let this beer warm up too much."
"This wasn't horrible or anything but some more depth of fruit character definitely would have been welcome here in the profile, as this mostly came off as a bit 2-note. This was just OK though and is ultimately not one of Great Divides better offerings."
"GD Dunkel weiss pours a pretty standard brown with some redness in it when towards light. A nice whitish head that died quickly, sparse lace on this. Smells of nuts, malt, slight peat, chocolate and small roast. Taste is roasted malt up top blending into a nutty assortment going into chocolate. A small earthy hop kick somewhere towards the beginning. Nothing to big. Feel is medium and lightly carbed. It goes down like a dunkel should so there's that. The drinkability on this is not to much because it does nothing for me."
"Maybe I""m spoiled and would like it better if I wasn't drinking Aventinus on the same night, but I must say that $7+ a bomber (on sale) seems high for this beer. I expect a lot more of a flavor punch from a dunkel heffeweizen."
"D- Nicely drinkable despite the off-putting cooked lentil aroma. Not the most well-crafted dunkel-weisse that I've had, but I certainly wouldn't turn-down another glass."
"Pours a nice reddish-brown color, with a negligible amount of light brown foam. Nice malty aroma, along with bananas, cloves and roasted nuts. On the palate, I get a nice, light brown sugar sweetness, along with wheat, clove and molasses. A nice effort, pretty good on draught, but I have no intention of dropping $6/bomber on this one."
"At first taste and look I agreed with what most everyone said about this beer. Pours dark amber...head didn't last but about 10 seconds if that...made the beer look like dirty water fountain water....taste was ok. Not too bad...not too good...average at best. Then I sat down and ate dinner. I had the beer with nearly what they recommended on the side of the bottle. Had fish, potatoes, veggies...and WOW did the flavors really come out of this beer! I really enjoyed it while paired with my food...Try this beer again with something close to what they recommend on the bottle...you might be pleasantly surprised."
"I did not like this beer. I think I would be able to drink it easier if it werent side by side with the quintessential Dunkel but still I dont think I would like it very much more."
"Chocolate, cloves and a bit of banana come through in the taste with a bit more rounded feel as some other light fruits come into play; pears and apples perhaps? This one has some characteristics more akin to a dunkel lager than a dunkelweiss...strong nutty presence, honey malt sweetness and some grassy hops. Mouthfeel is good, as it has a nice creaminess to it but seems to fall a bit short of some of the best German D-weiss'. Still a good American rendition of the style and I would surely buy a sixer of this if it was available around here."
"Drinkability: as I said, it's a bit sweet for my taste. Plus, I'm in the mood for a dunkelweizen, and this beer simply cannot satiate that jones. I'm disappointed that it's not really what I expected, but it's not a bad beverage by any means."
"The body is a bit dry for style. Could use a bit more complexity overall. Carbonation is light as well. Overall some minor off notes, but could use some more depth and wheat. Easy drinking though."
"This is good, and easily drinkable, but not really all that memorable, sadly. This is my lowest rated from Great Divide, other than Hades."
"Drinkability is solid a beer that they need to brew in six pack form so I can grab a couple more of these this coming spring. Good stuff."
"OVERALL maybe a bit too sweet. but a good and tasty beer, and an admirable attempt at the style. A bit rich too be pounding."
"(D)- Still drinkable, but this was probably much better fresh. Great banana & wheat. Will re-review when I find a fresh one."
"Buttery, a slight roast on the back, full bodied, sweet. No cereal flavor, wheat comes through. No bitterness, drinkability high. Overall a decent beer."
"The brew is medium-bodied but seems to drink a little heavier and slicker than that because of its copious sweetness and extremely fine-grained carbonation."
"Great Divide is pretty much a permanent member of my 'Top 10 American Breweries Of All-Time'. Dunkel Weiss, although a well-crafted beer in a general sense, doesn't put a serious scare into the greats of the style."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast notes, banannas, wheat, slight spice. The taste is sweet, malty, nice yeast notes, a nice touch of banannas/wheat/spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this one is tasting very nice tonight. Thanks Chuck."
"Drinkability: Well, it certainly isn't everyday that you run into a dunkelweizen, though I'm glad I did. Makes for sweet, easy, lightly wheaty drinking on this Wednesday evening. It's nice to see Great Divide churning out so many new beers this year."
"Drinkability: The 6.4% ABV is well masked. The banana and cloves are well done. I have officially come over to the ""Dunkel Side."""
"overall a nice dukel."
"Overall, a solid dunkelweizen and another solid beer from Great Divide. I've had better representations of the style, but on the whole a very good American interpretation."
"Drinks a bit slow, the dryness & green bananas slow me down. Not a bad Dunkel, but there many better"
"D- An enjoyable beer. This could definitely stand up with some German competitors."
"Overall, a good beer, but nothing special."
"Pours a blood-red, deep. Fluffy head, but not quite as aggressive as some of the German dunkels. Smell is a bit muted, but still fresh vibrant malt. Doesn't smell hoppy. Taste is muted but still bright sweet dark malt. Pretty lively with some nice carbonation. A bit thin in the mouth, not a huge depth of flavor, nor as coating as a lot of the germans. But still tasty and quite refreshing."
"Drinkability is low, this is not a very good beer at all. Maybe it's better fresh, or maybe it's just a bad beer period. At least this bottle certainly was."
"Not quite sure what to think of this one, as it hit me as a lot wheatier and breadier than I thought it was going to be. I'm enjoying it, but only partially, and probably couldn't stomach the whole bomber."
"D: A pretty average dunkel weiss. Decent, but not nearly as good as many of its German counterparts."
"This is a lighter beer then I expected. A little more body and flavor would do this beer good."
"Although a good beer, it didnt seem to be very traditional and was more on of an american rendition. Even after swirling the yeast from the bottom, is still seemed to lack some of the good traditional-ness."
"Overall: Good drinkability, pretty basic but less fruit than some. The smell was more complex and better than the taste. The flavor starts spicy then fades to a roasted malt/nutty flavor. The flavor was a little watery and to ""fresh"" maybe too much hop presence for me. Decent Dunkel considering it is US made..."
"D: Well, it is light in the feel but that does make this pretty drinkable. This becomes an easy drinker and nice darker beer that can be enjoyed in hotter temperatures. It is solid all around and Great Divide did a good job of representing the style. With that said, I still feel the same way about this one as I do the rest of the newer styles they are bringing out. They seem to do just enough but I feel like they could do a bit more and these beers could be damned good. I still imagine tweaking will be done and this beer will get better as newer batches are released and hopefully they will be. Thanks again, Great Divide. You rarely let a brotha down."
"Poured into a Mayflower nonic pint, formed a 3/4"" tan head over the slightly cloudy orangey copper brew. Head falls slowly to half-height, with tons of sticky lacing. Aroma is slightly smoky cloves and wheat sweetness. Taste is also wheat sweet upfront, moderate clove character in the middle through to end. Mouthfeel is wow smooth, and drinkability is amazingly good. This one will get me back for more."
"Wow, nobody else has reviewed this one since I reviewed from the bottle a few days ago, well, 10oz serving on-tap at The Pit served a crisp dark orange with a thin barely-there head that diminishes to a ring and leaves no lacing. Aroma is a decent amount of toasted malts. The taste is a wonderful blend of toasted malts and cocoa. The beer is quite smooth and refreshing, even for summer. This is an enjoyable beer, but I must say I prefer it bottled."
"i am pleasantly surprised with this beer and I tip my hat for the USA as this is an excellent interpretation that boldly goes to a style of beer that is firmly entrenched as a German specialty. And I feel it does quite well."
"Nicely done. An enjoyable sipper that improves as it warms to near room temperature."
"M/D: Nice medium to light body. Carbonation is slightly prickly. Drinkability is fine. Very drinkable and refreshing beer."
"Overall, not my favorite style and this one is too far on the sweet side for me."
"I paid $6 for a 22oz bomber which is awfully expensive for a dunkel weizen. I generally respect Great Divide so I went ahead and bought a bottle anyway. My bottle had a recent bottling date of April 17, 2009. When poured, it looked okay. The head was a bit small for a wheat beer, but it wasn't a big deal. The label claimed a German yeast was used, and the aroma seemed to back that up. I could smell a bit of banana/clove character which I like. Unfortunately, the taste was a bit disappointing. It has some of that banana/clove character, but the phenols seem to be slightly out of whack. Either that or they just don't mix well with the slightly off-putting grainy/dark flavor. I like some quality German dunkel weizen beers, but this beer has something in it that doesn't sit well with me. It's almost some sort of unpleasant dirty/dirt-ish flavor. Whatever it is, it gets worse as the beer warms. I was only able to get through half the bomber before I had to dump what was left. I like that GD is doing some new/seasonal beers, but I'll look elsewhere when it comes to dark wheat beers."
"- Great tasting.. if you like strong wheats.. a good one for you! Tastes stronger than the 6.4% it states though... but rich, complex, balanced.. and a great American interpretation of the style."
"Pours a murky mahognay with a thin tan head. Nose is very fruity with some wheat malts, peppery yeast and spices. Taste is also on the fruity side, but well balanced. Nice citrus and tropical presence along with the herbal yeast. Crisp body is well carbonated. Nice effort from GD."
"The head is a coppery brown color, tops off at a finger plus but made of large enough bubbles that they pop off into a thin coating across the surface, lacing doesn't stick around very long either. Reddish brown liquid with a slight orange lightening at the rims, solid haze gives it as much translucency as you can get without opacity. Very sweet and thick nose of clove, molasses, honey and caramel, with no lack of pralines, milk chocolate powder, apricot, cherry fruit with a touch of banana and, perhaps, tangerine. Full-bodied, finds more balance here with a hoppy floral mist and little grassy nip before the clove, nutmeg spice and molasses, butterscotch and caramel take over. The carbonation puts up a good struggle against the density but eventually falters and gets squeezed out through the mid-palate. Smooth enough mouth feel, allows the apricot, peach, pear and mango fruit to slowly spread wide. Minor pie crust or fruit bread notes. Could probably have been made denser, a good thing it was not."
"Dunkel Weiss is a good Dunkelweizen that isn't quite good enough to compete with the world's finest. Nonetheless, it's a little better than you might expect from a Dunkelweizen hailing from Colorado. Having said that, it could be better. It would benefit from more strength on the nose and a stronger banana presence (in smell and in flavor). Nonetheless, I like it. It's grown on me more with each passing sip. A little warming helps a lot. The nose and the flavor seem to open up and its body feels more substantial. I kind of liked the first half of the bottle and I really liked the second half. Overall, it's good and I have no hesitation recommending it. Once again, I'm pleased with the direction Great Divide is taking. Keep rolling out good new beer, guys."
"Pours a murky brown color with a solid head. Smell is wheaty with slight bananas in the nose. Taste is cloves, banana and wheat. Unfortunately, the taste was a little bit more subdued than I was hoping for. Decent amount of carbonation. Overall, a decent brew. Not my favorite dunkelweizen though."
"overall: a bit sweet but still good flavors and drinkable."
"drinkability- i greatly enjoyed this beer and will buy another very soon!"
"D- Overall, this is another fantastic brew from Great Divide that is recommended!"
"D: This is a nice effort by Great Divide. I was quite pleased. The beer went down easy and made me what another."
"D: Very flavorful and easy to drink. Good body and flavor if you're not quite up to a bock."
"Not as malty in the taste as I thought it would be. Spice, clove, banana, some bready yeast and malt. Maybe it's be, but I think this style should be a slight bit sweeter or maltier than a saison. Not that this is a saison, but it more closely resembles one to me. It's good. That's true. Very drinkable."
"Although I don't have much experience with the style, I picked up an authentic German example (from the BA top 10) and had it earlier today. I don't know how true this is to the originals but it's a tasty beer in it's own right."
"M - Medium bodied, mild/low carbonation, a little sticky."
"EDIT: The 2010 version of this beer I find myself absolutely loving. It's still expensive and only in bombers, but it's more affordable at the tap room. There's a distinct flavor that can almost be described as like peanut butter that I love."
"d: pretty drinkable until you get to the finish where it almost seemed like things fell apart. not too memorable"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly tart from the wheat, with higher carbonation."
"D. Easy drinking. An almost refreshing quality to it. Could use a little more complexity in the flavor."
"22oz bottle $7.49. Dark chestnut, not brown. Smells quite wheaty and tastes like cloves, wheat, yeasty, not bad for a dunkelweizen at all. Too bad there are plenty of German examples which are cheaper and are obviously a tad bit more authentic. Still, this was interesting and I am glad to see Great Divide releasing new beers in bombers."
"Poured a deerper amber color (almost brown) with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of breadiness, wheat, toast, and some fruitiness. Tastes of bananas, wheatiness, some spices, and lighter roastiness. Lacing left on the glass."
"This is one of three new beers that I know of from these guys, the other two being Saison and Belgica. I like the blurb on the side of the bottle telling the drinker not to add any lemon to this. Decadent pour reveals a cloudy dark red, with a large white head. Musty smells of banana, brown bread and bubblegum come through in the aroma. Overall the smell is juicy. Taste is still incredibly juicy, but with a beautiful wheat backbone. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation and flavor to make it complex, yet approachable. This is an easy drinker, but it deserves to be sipped. A great beer here from Great Divide that is as good, if not better than many of the great German examples. Hopefully this is a year round offering. Not to be missed for wheat beer lovers."
