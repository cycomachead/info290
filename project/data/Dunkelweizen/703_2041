This dark wheat offering pours a murky opaque brown, almost like coffee with just the faintest hint of cream mixed in. Aroma was dark malts and hefe yeast all the way, no discernible hops but a decent amount fruit and spice, a bit like pumpkin pie. Palate was big chewy dark malts and yeast phenols, I get a lot of stone fruit (cherry, plum), raisin, and toffee/irish creme flavors with a healthy dose of spicy clove and some toasty notes that are not out of place in the sea of dark malt and yeast. Body is chewy and rich, albeit thinner than a huge doppelbock or the like. The rich malty character and spicy yeast leads the way but there is a decently bitter finish that includes some herbal hops (but you have to look for this) and syrupy booze. Solid German wheat beer albeit more coarse and perhaps ""rough around the edges"" than some other examples. Would have liked to see the sweet flavors pop out a bit more.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 05, 2013"

Nice deep brown (almost black) and no light gets through. Not much aroma detected, but had a nice roasted malt taste, with coffee and little bitterness on the finish. Had a nice mouthfeel, as well.","delta490","Mar 23, 2013"

4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into signature weizen glass, best before 9/2013. Pours very hazy dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice rocky cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, banana, clove, pear, apple, brown bread, wheat, pepper, floral, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malt and ester notes. Taste of caramel, chocolate, banana, clove, brown bread, wheat, pear, apple, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, banana, clove, pear, apple, chocolate, floral, brown bread, wheat, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and yeast esters, with good robustness of flavor; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish as expected. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice dunkelweizen! Very nice balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable well rounded example of the style.","superspak","Feb 22, 2013"

Very rarely do I pick up on ""toffee"" that many others smell, but even I can find it in this nose. The sweet flavour is rather simple and uninspiring, but true to form. Caramel notes and some roasted malts, but I find the wheat and yeast typical of this style pretty overwhelming.

The taste has a banana creme pie thing going, which I am not too wild on with hefes or dunkels. The metallic characteristic can be found in the flavor as well as some vinous notes. There is some milk chocolate flavors towards the end which smooths out the profile and is nice. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, which cuts through the body; sweet throughout on the palate. I would like to see more yeasty phenols in this beer but the flavor is not bad.

Color is a murky dark brown. Nose has the usual yeasty wheat touch with some spicy cloves and some caramel tossed in there for kicks as well. Fair amount of carbination makes this one lighter in mouthfeel than I expected but strangely smooth as well. Taste from the front to finish features a very low hop profile, some bready notes, malt sweetness easily detected with the yeast ever present.

I'm not really getting nearly as much yeast flavor either clove or banana or wheat as I should be with a beer of this style. It tastes like a solid dark beer but not a dunkel weiss. Mouthfeel too misses the mark, this beer is just too light and doesn't have the creamy fullness that a wheat beer should have.

Medium-bodied, smooth and creamy, has a little spicy clove taste up front the citric notes and hop bitterness (along with some good carbonation) mix with some caramel, roasted malts for a slightly sweet and citric beer that is a little sticky and has a dry, crisp backbite.

And a crisp clean finish is classic. beeing a hefe the mouthfeel is solid, but erdinger has the thickest mouth feel i think. some of it has to do with the release of the carbonation when you drink it, so bubbles froth in your mouth. due to the balanced flavor, and overall light, crisp, and refreshing nature of this beer and style this is for sure a full on session beer","danadeny","Nov 30, 2008"

2.71,-27.7,3.5,2.5,3,2,2.5,"When poured into a Erdinger Weizen glass, this Dunkelweizen was an appealing murky dark chestnut brown with some caramel coloring mixed in with it. Usually Weizens have a massive head of foam on it, but the one on this beer was more controlled. It was about 1 1/2 inches in height and was an off white color. This head of foam quickly fizzled away and only left behind a handful of fizzy off white colored rings. I liked the color, but the head of foam needed a little something. This beer needs to be swirled around to wake up the aroma. When it was, the aroam was still very subtle with dark roasted wheat, a splash of sweet caramel, and a hint of banana and cloves. To me, the aroma needed more malted wheat and banana and it shouldn't have to be swirled around to get any kind of smell out of it. The taste was very crispy and carbonated with plenty of dark roasted wheat, a hint of banana, a pinch of cloves, and then finishes up with more malted wheat. It is a Weizen, but there should have been a little bit more flavor in here. Wheat can get a little boring by itself. This was a light bodied beer that was heavy on the carbonation and featured a faint aftertaste of dark roasted wheat and a hint of cloves. No banana, just wheat and cloves. It wouldn't be so bad if they lowerd the carbonation so I could get more of an aftertaste out of this beer. In the end, this Weizen was overly carbonated with a ton of malted wheat and really nothing else. There are better German or American Dunkelweizens out there. I will continue to use the glass with the Erdinger name on it, but I won't be pouring this beer into it any time soon.","AltBock","Sep 23, 2008"

Hold it to the light and there are caramel-red highlights a plenty. Smell is weak as expected for the style, but you pick up notes of caramel and hop. Taste is where the hops come out of the woodwork - hops are the first thing you notice after the medium carbonation. The hops settle out with the bubbles, and you're left with milder hops and sweet caramel aftertaste. Carbonation is good - a bit of a bite, but not overdone. Drinkability is good, but there is a bit of carbonation to process. Not to overstate the carbonation, but letting it sit for 15 minutes helps. Poured from a bottle this attribute is more noticeable, but I expect if you got this in Germany it would be in a bigger glass than 16oz, and therefore would have time to breathe.

The finish was very slightly bitter and going into the after taste it was malty, wheaty as expected but as it lingers a little; it becomes a little fruity plummy like Belgian dark ales and I could sense some breadiness and bananas on the nose. Some spices was detected in the after taste as well; it finally fades off to leave a light grape citrus finale; not too shabby!

It definitely has the wheatiness of the hefe with the malty flavorings of the stout. I like it! It's very dark in the glass with a good strong head. I thought I smelled rootbeer at first, even in the taste. It's a great balance of the two.

The malty fruity esters that I expected to taste from the smell are mild and hidden. They are over powered by a toast/biscuit flavor that crisp the tounge beautifully. This beer has a thicker mouthfeel with a slight bit of carbonation. Overall I really enjoy this beer. The bottle advertises the ""World's #1 Weissbier"" and they might be on to something.

Really weak smell where I can pick up very small bits of banana and sugar. Taste is a bit watery unfortunately, but there is some flavor underneath. A banana pudding start with kind of a chocolatey-sugar sweetness and some mild spice that sits on the tongue pleasantly. There is a solid creaminess going on but even that falls flat with a bit of seltzery carbonation in the finish. I could probably only stand one of these as it sits a bit thick in the stomach, but at least it looks pretty.","jwff","May 21, 2006"

Flavors are mildly bready, roasty, cocoa, and fruity. The darker grains tend to mask what I like most in a Wheat. The darker grains don't display enough character to make this beer interesting. It's caught in the middle. There is more malty sweetness than is detected in the first sip. The body is quite large and full. Finishes mildly sweet and slightly dry.

The flavor begins with a rush of carbonation tickling the tongue revealing a dry very wheaty malt flavor with roasted accents but no bitterness associated with roasted malts. The flavor is very clean and easy to drink while still giving the drinker a complex malt flavor. The carbontation is very high which is typical for the style though I find that at the bottom of the glass when the beer has gotten a little flatter that the flavor becomes more balanced and enjoyable.

The beer poured a dark brown with a nice head for a Hefe, and a minimal lace. No real nose to speak of, light citrus aroma, no cloves or malt. The taste was primarily a light malt flavor, and gain, none of the citrus or spice I expected from this beer. As with any Hefeweizen (dunkel or otherwise) it had a nice light mouth feel and was very drinkable. My memories of this beer led me to expect much more.

3.95,5.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Ah, the first beer after getting off the pain meds from a bout of kidney stones. It pours a nice dark brown, darker than other dunkels I ahve had recently. I had to let the head fall a bit before pouring the remainder of the bottle in. The head has fallen to about a finger and a half of nice tan foam. The nose is mostly sweet wheat malt, but there is a bit of caramel in the nose as well. The flavor is more full than the other dunkels I have been drinking. There is more of a roasted flavor, along with a more full wheat flavor in this one. The finish is spicey and delightful. Overall a nice taste. What I find missing is the creamy banana. That detracts just a bit from the flavor. The beer is not quite as creamy as I would like. Its a nice moderate to thick texture, but it needs that added texture from the yeast that I find missing. I like the beer, but I think that there are others in the style that I would pick up again before I tried this one again. Still, worth picking up and trying.","kmpitz2","Aug 27, 2004"

4.42,17.9,4.5,5,4,3.5,5,"The head was exceptionally large, even when poured relatively slowly. Light brown coffee coloured. The beer is not black or brown but a dark dark caramel, toffee, somewhat moccha, and very singular. The head is thick and viscous and very solid; chunky. The aroma is deliciously sweet, recalling grape-juice, raisins, and fruity-sweet yeast, akin to some Belgian fruit beers. The aroma was very bewildering--I did not expect this sweetness, but the surprise was welcomed: I love a sweet beer. So the malt combines supremely with the yeast and exudes an ultra-sweet aroma, mouth-wateringly rich. There are some drier smells, hops hiding in the background, but I picked out mostly the tart sugariness of the nose. This really smells like a yeasty Belgian, but I am sure the Germans have been producing this wonderful yeasty smell for just as long as the Belgians. However, it is the first German beer I have tried with such strong yeasty sweet fruitiness. Ambrosial. The taste is very sweet too, where the dark malt announces itself, but not like a stout--this malt makes itself more known as a grainy, sweet, creamy caramel. I suppose the wheat is detectable, but the barley malt is too. Grapes, dates, dusty yeast, flowery sweet honey and candy-like flavours. The two malts make for a crisp and highly refreshing dark lager. This is exceptional, and it suits my personal palate very well. Dark, sweet, yeasty, and preeminently drinkable. I could quaff these all day, summer or winter.","Cwrw","Jul 15, 2004"

This has some really nice bready notes mixed with caramel and biscuit flavors. There is a dry finish, which begs for you to take another sip.

The taste is almost non-existent when it first hits your tongue, but then roasted malt, chocolate, faint banana, and a touch of breadiness (less than expected) appear, all finished off by a touch of bitterness. This beer has less sweetness and richness than many weizens, and actually reminds me of a dark lager in some ways, such as the finish, some of the roasted flavor, and the mouthfeel. But these are not neccessarily bad qualities. The carbonation is a bit too enthusiastic at first, but as it warms just slightly is takes on a much smoother mouthfeel and seemingly a finer carbonation. The drinkability is very good, and I'm sure this could be a regular year-round wheat beer for many persons.

4.01,6.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours very dark brown with reddish hue on the edges.  Pleasant tan head is surprisingly large and persistent.  Despite that, aroma is a bit subdued.  Taste is interestingly consistent from beginning to end with a nice weissbier alcohol bite showing up more at the end.  Mouthfeel is nice, with excellent drinkability for a dunkel weissbier.","BitteBier","Sep 04, 2002"
3.81,1.6,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"The very persistent, billowy, creamy and dense krauzen - like head tops a turbid ruddy brown hued brew w/ profuse threads of bubbles.  Light banana esters and carob dominate in aroma, with grainy wheat tartness secondary.  A touch tame aromawise.  Flavorwise, mellow chocolate malt emerges first, followed by notes of toasty Munich and caramel malt sweetness.  Mild banana esters persist at a constant level from start to finish.  Lightly bodied for style, but viscous enough in mouthfeel to help lend excellent drinkability.     Finishes mostly clean, w/ trace bubblegum esters quickly fading.  Not an outstanding example of the style, but certainly well rounded, flavorful and highly drinkable.","marc77","Aug 28, 2002"
4.3,14.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Shiny dark brown, wet shoe leather color. Big, fizzy, tan head. Full of sweet necter and thick yeast smells. Lots of sweet, but not syrupy, malt taste. Great balance of the natural wheat flavors, subtle bananas, and clove, and a really good rich creamy sweet malt middle. Nice crisp and clean finish. You expect a dark beer to be a little more bodied, but it is very refreshing, and really easy to drink. I had this with leftover roast beef, roasted red potatos, steamed vegetables.  A great beer with dinner.","StevieW","Aug 24, 2002"

4.33,15.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"(Paired with a specialty sandwich from my local Alpen sandwich shop: well-done roast beef, shredded lettuce, Bernaise sauce on Bavarian black bread. The sandwiches from this terrific store - I hate to call it a deli - always go excellently with well-made German beers... but this was a particular match in heaven.)","Thrasher","Jul 16, 2002"
4.1,9.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Nice translucent, deep red/brown color with nice carbonation.  Pours with a very thick, long lasting, tan head.  Slightly citrusy aroma and flavor.  I enjoyed this more than the Pinkatus.  A refreshing beer.","ryanocerus","Jul 10, 2002"
4.3,14.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a murky brown, and when held up to the light a slightly tan-ish tint appears. Malt aromas on the nose.  On the palate malt flavors appear up front, then slight carmel tones, then finally the tiniest hints of banana poke through.  Rather smooth and quite enjoyable!  Overall a very enjoyable weissbier dunkel...","WilliamPhilaPa","May 23, 2002"
4.6,22.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is an excellent weissbier.  Very dark in color, like coffee or birch beer, but the flavor is lighter than it looks. Slight sweet with a fruity palate.  There are hints of vanilla or honey.  Goes down smoothly.  Drink with a pinch of lemon to enhance its flavor.  Try drinking on a hot day.  Very refreshing.","psugrad98","May 22, 2002"
4.23,12.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a very dark hazy brownish color with a nice big tan head.  The smell is of sweet dark malts.  Taste starts off with dark maltiness and then goes into a nice smooth wheat flavor with hints of bananas and you are left with a taste of chocolate on your tongue.  Nice and creamy and very drinkable.  A great brew.  Great smoothness and a nice wheaty backbone to the flavor make it very drinkable.","Murph","May 04, 2002"
4.7,25.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Nice dark amber color with light tan head.  Very nice aroma with hints of chocolate.  Malt and sweet flavors with not trace of hops.  Not overly complex but nicely balanced.  Good carbonation.  Extremely easy to drink.  My first dunkel.... I think I will be trying more.","jreitman","Apr 20, 2002"

3.7,-1.3,3,3,4,4,4,"Darkest dunkel I've encountered with little if any of those wonderful bubblegum/bannana aromas.  A little roasty on the palate but was otherwise pretty bland.  Drank almost like a weak porter(?).  Not bad, but there are better (Edelweiss).","pbrian","Dec 18, 2001"
4.36,16.3,5,4,4,5,5,"Creamy head, as if cream was added to it.  Definetely better if poured completely into a glass so all the yeast is removed from the bottle and into your belly.   Great color.","AaronRed","Nov 15, 2001"
