"On tap at RDU. Don’t know if I’ve had this style before. Strong sweet taste. Some banana taste. Body is a beautiful cloudy amber. Love the look."

"Had the Dunkelweizen at the G & B in Bolingbrook, IL last evening. The color was a nice deep amber perhaps brown with off-white head that laced slightly. The aroma was sweet with hints of malt. The taste was a very good balance of grain, hops and malt. The was a slight sweetness that made the beer smooth to drink and the beer came off the pallet clean. Overall not to bad...the mouthfeel was smooth and easy. good session beer."
"Poured a dark, copper, amber color with large foamy beige head. Smells of yeast, malts, spice and some kind of fruit. Tasted of wheat, yeast, roasted malts and a creamy sweetness... surprisingly good and refreshing with a great aftertaste. What a pleasant brew!"
"D- This clove thing is just not what I am looking for in a beer. Not appealing to me."
"This is my favorite of the Gordon Biersch beers. It pours kind of an ugly muddy brown color with a big off white head. The aroma is a little bready and herbal, with spices and berries. The flavor is strong with banana, clove, spice, herbal tea, and berries. A bit clunky, like most of GB beers, but tasty and not bad."
"Moved from a separate listing (formerly the DC location) that has been flagged as a duplicate on 11.16.2010."
" Drnk was GREAT very refreshing and not as heavy as I expected. Very Well Crafted Brew!"
"Overall, this is a great brew. The biggest reason is that it doesn't lean toward clove and banana too much and there are no harsh phenols, which some brewers seem to not be able to tame. Kudos to Gordon Biersch, we dig this beer a lot."
"D - This one surprised me. I didn't expect to get an American Dunkelweizen in an airport that compared so favorably to the brews from Munich."
"You can easily tasted the malted wheat and yeast in this beer. The roasted malt offsets some of the banana, citrus and clove flavors, producing a sweet, rich and slightly spicy brew that is both refreshing and nuanced. Apparently the beer undergoes five to six weeks of aging which helps strengthen the flavor. Another great GB beer."
"Drinkability: My first Gordon Biersch, and a surprisingly pleasant beer. First off, good for them for taking a stab at a style many don't. Secondly, kudos to them for getting it right. This has all the characteristics of a straightforward, drinkable drunkelweiss, from the bananas and cloves all the way down to the roasted but soft malty foundation. And at 5.4%, you can afford to drink it while studying for the Virginia bar exam."
"Gordon Biersch knows how to make those German wheat ales. Their Hefeweizen is damn good, and their Dunkelweizen might even be better. A hell of a good beer....did someone say breakfast in a bottle?"
"This is one beautiful dunkelweizen! The best I've had outside Germany and a must-have for any afficiando of this style."
"D- This is a pretty solid Dunkelweizen that is definitely worth a shot."
"Oh and lets go Red Wings!"
"On tap at Mr.Dunderbak's in Tampa. In a weizen glass the beer was a hazy brown color with a thin white head that still left a little bit of lacing. The beer had a sweet malt aroma, with a little spice. Nice sweet malt taste, some citrus, and a little clove. Comfortable, easy drinking. Enjoyed it."
"Since the location where I had this is not listed yet but it has to be brewed at one of the brewing locations so I'll go with this one. It's a pretty thick tan amber with a modest white head and similar lacing. The aroma is clove and light banana and some sweet malt. The flavor is firm clove wheat, bread and subtle citrus. It's a well carbonated brew with a good feel that goes down easy. A very solid, refreshing brew."
"Drinkability: I have had mixed experiences with Gordon Biersch beers, but this one is a top notch example of the style"
"The aroma has bananas, bubble gum, cloves, and wheat. The appearance hazy amber with a very large head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall a nicely done Dunkelweizen. I would gladly drink another one by itself or with food. It's worth a try."
"D - Dunkelweizens can make great drinking beers, and this brew is no exception. Perhaps the best dunkelweizen I've had, Gordon Biersch has managed to retain some sweetness as well as highlight the sourness and phenols present in hefeweizens. Certainly one of the best dunkels out there for anyone interested."
"On-tap at the brewpub. I wasn't blown away by the other GB beers I tried, but this was a pretty solid option. It seemed to take inspiration from weizenbocks, with occasional dark fruit notes. Otherwise there a big sweet banana (like when a banana has black spots) taste along with a bit of cocoa, rum, and raisins. I'd order this again."
"Poured into a tall pilsener style glass. Beer has a nice 3 finger head that holds pretty weel. Beer is dark brownish-orange in color. Ample carbonation continues to feed the head, looks delicious. Strong banana smell is tempered by a sweet malty nose along with some spices . . can't wait to drink it! Taste does not disappoint. Extremely smooth beer with hints of banana, clove, toffee and some fruit. Nothing overpowering in the taste but an amazingly well balanced and complex brew at the same time. Could drink quite a few of these and will continue to order them when I visit the restaurant."
"M + D: Well carbonated... crisp, but with a little bit of chewiness at the same time. This is my first GB offering, and it has made a very good first impression. Quite a good beer."
"I've never been a huge fan of the Gordon Biesch brews, but here is one notable exception. Lovely, deep tan colored brew, with plenty of light tan foam. Clove and slightly fruity notes greeted my nose as I opened the bottle. The taste was a fresh mix of a slightly roasted, bready malt, like a light pumpernickle bread, a yeasty clove zip, and a little fruity, slightly banana note. Mouthfeel a little tingly, but otherwise good, and a nice, smooth, enjoyable brew."
"This is a toasty grain session beer brewed in craft form, excellent."
"Enjoyed on-tap at the Miami brewpub. A hefeweizen with lots more chocolate malt, nothing wrong with that. An above average mouthfeel with bananna consistency and taste. A good dunkel, good looking with lots of lace. Milkshake, though taste is on the sweet side and no complexity."
"This is a perfect hot afternoon beer, or as a warmup for a drinking session. Don't think I could do more than one of these, though."
"Drinkability: Wish there were some more of these in the fridge. Gotta get back to the Fresno State-Rutgers game. Go Dogs!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: This is a really good effort. Great traditional approach to the style."
"When taking the 1st drink I knew that this was now my favorite beer. I was eating mexican food and the taste combined with the enchiladas was magnificent. The beer was a perfect match for the spicy taste. I finished the beer in about 4 gulps and wanted another 1 right away. All I can say is this a must beer for anyone. The smoothness that Gordon Biersch has perfected will be a delight for any beer drinker. Go ahead and give it a try."
"Poured a deep brown with a fair amount of foam and loads of lace. The smell of wheat, roasted malts and yeast filled the nose. The taste was of a thick sweetness with a hint of bitterness to balance this smooth tasting dunkelweizen. One of the best U.S. Dunkelweizen that I've tasted in a long time!"
"Get this beer if you can and you like the style."
"Overall a pretty good beer, especially considering it cost less than a dollar a bottle as part of a Costco mixed 24 pack."
"12oz. bottle bottled 37 days ago according to the date on the bottle. Perfect banana and clove flavors - intense without seeming fake or overpowering. Appealing coffee color. Lots of fine sediment. Not much hop flavor, but that seems consistent with the style. Exceptionally good, get it while it is fresh. Maybe the best beer GB makes?"
