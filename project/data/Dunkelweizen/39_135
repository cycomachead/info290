Moderate to rich, full body.  Very similar to a straight hefe with a slight orange/cinnamon/and faint chocolate notes.  None overwhelming.  Finishes with a slightly sweet with a fruity, oft-lemon taste. Another top notch, high quality brew from Ayinger.  Tough to find a better German beer from any other brewer.","bigdeuce","Mar 06, 2015"

It hits on all the characteristics you'd expect from a dunkleweizen, but its a just a bit too sweet for me to love it.  Definitely would try this again, but having a better balance from the hops to cut down on the sweetness would bump this up a notch for me.","CTbrew32","Feb 20, 2015"

Us Americans have the one up on Europe so far as most ales are concerned, but we've yet to touch on the efforts of our Eastern comrades when it comes to hefes and dunkels.

Hazy dark copper-amber pour with a creamy two finger white head with good retention and great lacing. The nose is earthy and malty with hints of clove, banana, caramel, wheat, honey, and some subtle citrus. The taste mirrors the nose with lots of earthy, malty, spicy goodness. Hints of clove, banana bread, caramel, orange peel, yeast, apple, white pepper, and wheat. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy but very smooth. A bit on the rich side so probably not a great session beer. Overall, I'm slowly warming up to Weizens and this is definitely a great one!","beerdrifter","Mar 11, 2014"

4.18,2.5,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Popped open a .5L bottle for dessert. This is lighter colored than a dunkel, but more of an amber than your common hefe. Off the bat, it's sort of like Schneider Weisse for the darker bread notes. Overall it does follow more of the notes of a hefeweizen with mild clove, vanilla, and a hint of banana. It's toasty and bready, but also has occasional dark crispy wheat notes. It's smooth and deep, worth trying with and without the yeast dumped in—it's a little brighter before. Man, I'm wishing I didn't only buy one bottle. Get yourself some.","tempest","Jan 12, 2014"

Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, banana, clove, pear, apple, wheat, floral, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes with a fair amount of hop presence; and good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, banana, pear, apple, clove, wheat, honey, pepper, floral, bread, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, banana, pear, apple, clove, wheat, bread, floral, honey, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent dunkelweizen style. All around great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

The taste brings in more of the same, with the bread tending toward a spicy pumpernickel and taking the van, but the banana, clove, and light orange bringing up a strong rear. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice dunkelweizen, one of the better ones readily available around here.","TMoney2591","Jul 29, 2013"

The caramel rich, fruity aroma and taste is refreshing, precisely balanced and always delicious. Recently at a Total Wine Belgian Beer Class a participant commented that this beer as his favorite "Belgian Beer". The young instructor of the class immediately corrected him "that is a Bavarian Beer, but is is excellent". A pity that more American craft beers do not attempt to imitate Bavarian beers like Ayinger. My only wish is that Ayinger keg beer would be available in the US.","wattoclone","Sep 11, 2012"

4.09,0.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"From the 500 ml. bottle. Sampled on August 7, 2011. It pours a slight murky medium to dark amber. My glass was not big enough to pour it all in without spilling some due to the huge, frothy, off-white head. Wheat and bananas penetrate the nose with virtually nothing in the way of hops or malts. The body is nice and creamy and glistens on the tongue. The taste also brings out that wheat, clove, banana flavor but there is also a noted sugary sweetness thrown in.

As a fan of Belgium Ales the powerful yeast of this beer is very attractive to me, and the relatively tame 5.8% ABV certainly begs one to have another. Seems to be at its best at about 45-50 degrees.

The smell has some fruit notes with a steady wheat smell. Taste is similar, sort of sweet, minimal bitterness, good maltiness to it but the wheat still carries the taste. the traditional banana and clove are present. Mouthfeel is medium with decent carbonation. Overall, this is not the #1 best dunkel I have ever had, but it is a wonderful beer.

It was very wheaty and estery, with that perfect darkening twist of malt and spice. With such robust scents it would seem that one or more of them could overpower the brew's taste, but here, we are given a nicely blended brew with a surprisingly delicate finish.","TheBrewo","Dec 17, 2010"

The spice character is on the lower side, there's only a little clove present. Rousing the yeast brings out these flavors a little bit more. For some reason, I'm a little underwhelmed, maybe this beer isn't as fresh as it needs to be? As with the Brau-Weisse I had a couple of nights back, the flavors don't seem to pop out as much as in some of the better beers in this style. Mildly phenolic. Dry, almost grainy finish with caramel, a little clove and some banana, this beer is light in body and rather highly carbonated. Solid stuff, I do wish the body had a little bit more melanoidin/dextrinous character. Easily drinkable and refreshing on this humid, October evening, I will revisit this.","DefenCorps","Oct 27, 2010"

Caramelized bananas soon take over, along with a mild butter toffee-like sweetness that segues into a clean and mild finish with very reserved bitterness.

Good looking beer with an orange-brown body and a big, creamy, ecru head. It's entirely hazy. The aroma is banana bread with some fairly mild spice. It definitely tends toward slightly toastier/breadier flavors than the hefe, though I might not have noticed that if I hadn't had the hefe so recently. The taste is sweet and fairly full. Carbonation is appropriate for the style, though, perhaps, on the softer side. Sweet wheat flavor is plentiful, but it's a bit toned down. Good beer, but I haven't had enough dunkelweizen to assess it competently.","popery","Oct 01, 2010"

Taste is just above average as this might have been sitting on the shelves for a while. Not super fresh like I was expecting but still very nice. Lean flavors with a light quaffable finish. Easy to drink but noting crazy going on. This is super easy to drink but I fear it's too simple for me. Love the style but this might not be my brewery to go to for dunkleweizens.

The taste is in line with most other German weizens you will taste. First, the carbonation is quite prickly and assertive, almost yeasty in its efforvesence. The fruity apple, banana, and clove flavors just pop through, with some other slight florals hidden underneath. The beer has a drying bite in the finish and the wheaty courseness typical of the style. This is a very sweet beer, with a prickly carbonation, a slightly biting dry finish, and loads of apple, banana, and clove flavors permeating the mid section and beyond.

Overall, It's a very drinkable Dunkelweizen. Wheat and with a nice wiezen texture.","demitriustown","Jul 26, 2008"

The start was dominated by the fizziness but the finish was smoothe with a slight sour twist. I wouldn't describe it as citrus but it is not far off and very faint.

4.12,1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy amber-gold with a dense and rocky two and a half finger head. Good retention leaves a few whisps of lace on the sides of the glass. German wheat phenols are immediate; banana and clove being strongest with a strong wheat scent in competetiion with a toasty caramel aroma. Some candyish alcohol aromas develop as it warms and a hint of fruitcake ester towards the end. Sweet flaked wheat and toasty pale malt upon first sip, and a mellow but obvious steely caramel flavor quickly develops. The aftertaste displays the charismatic bavarian wheat yeast phenols of banana and mellow clove that fades quickly, but really boasts an assertive bubblegum taste similiar to the Hefe-Weizen made by the same brewery. The mouthfeel is deliciously creamy and draws much of its girth from the wheat and suspended yeast. Thus, a light bodied beer with high carbonation has the illusion of being a hearty brew while retaining an exceptional drinkability. The hop character is subdued and seems to be slightly spicy and floral- probably Hallertau or a derivative; while its contribution to the flavor is minute- the spiciness created by the yeast balances the mild residual sweetness. The richness of the malt and complex bouquet of aromas and flavor seems to contradict the ease with which one can drink this beer, but this is simply a testament to what an authentic German brewery can accomplish within a style native to their homeland.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 17, 2007"

Good mouthfeel with a light-medium body and moderate carbonation as evidenced by the creamy head.

It smells of cloves and yeast, and tastes very fuity and smooth. The flavor is rather solid and balanced. I notice hints of banana and clove as expected. This is really an immaculately balanced, cohesive beer. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy but retains it's refreshing lively character that wheat ale is known for. The dunkle in this case is really just a less refined/processed version of a "normal" hefeweizen. This beer feels old fashioned and high quality in its construction. Pairs well with food.

The wheatiness comes through and leads into a nice clove accentuated finish which has a bit of length, but not too much. There is also a light lemon zest note that provides just a bit of freshness and brightness. Light-medium body with tight, active carbonation and a slightly smooth mouthfeel.

Big sugared bananas, some cloves, but also a slightly musty sourness on the nose. It's half intriguing and half offputting. On the palate, the first thing to assert itself is the cloves note. Sweet malts -- wheat coated with caramel, hang on until the finish, which is surprisingly watery and redolent of that sour/funky quality I mentioned earlier. Bananas come out at the last split second. This is a quality brew, but it's got a few detractions to it, some elements that don't quite fit in.","geexploitation","Jun 21, 2006"

Smells not unlike a typical German Hefe--good aromas. I've never been a big fan of Hefes because some of them have that metallic phenol bite that I think often overpowers the brew, but this one is fantastic, and I didn't have any desire to cut it with a lemon. Now put this thing in your mouth...it's like you could chew on it! In a good way, of course. It's got appropriate fizz, but it is full and filling--exactly what I expect from a German Hefe.

This does not really seem like a Dunkle weiss, more of a standard hefe with a bit more malt flavor and spicyness, maybe should be called an Amber weiss. Overall a wonderful beer with a wonderfull appearance and an awesome taste. So far I have been very happy with all the Ayinger weissen beers.

Possibly true to style it basically tastes a bit sweet and malty with just barely enough bitterness to balance things out. mouthfeel is how it looks, ciderlike.

The taste was truly exceptional with the flavors being more developed. I especially enjoyed the almost cola like flavors that the beer imparts.

The underlying malt body is tasty and helps finish a sip with a sugary sweet burst. Mouthfeel might be just a little thin to be great, but the drinkability is top notch.

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a murky light brown like an ice tea. Has a billowy white head that settles down to a thin layer. It smells of fruity esters and has a lot of citrus aroma (orange and a little banana). The taste follows in that it is fruity as well. Tastes of sweet orange, coriander, and a mild hop finish.

I would definately recommend it, especially on a warm summer day.","Brian700","Apr 05, 2005"

It takes several minutes to fit the whole thing into the weizen glass because of the gigantic head. Very active carbonation with a nice 3-4 inch rocky head. It's deep amber before the yeast, and after it has a muddy water/dirty bong water look that you can't see through. Keeps a nice blanket of foam but almost no lacing. Smells awesome - bananas and clove spiciness with lemon that becomes more pronounced at warmer temps. Taste delivers same flavors, along with a little bit of caramel and some hops in the background. Almost tastes like candy when warming. The beer has a fairly carbonated, crisp feel even as it warms, but this adds to the refreshing qualities of the beer.

It goes down easy and has a smooth malty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a real burp producer.

No sediment in the glass, but I left a cc in the bottom of the bottle. Nice aroma with lemon, grapefruit, and banana up front. Spicy cloves are also very noticeable. Anise is my first impression in the mouthfeel, but there's a lot of fizzy carbonation here. Taste is complex, with tart lemon, yeast, cloves, in the beginning. As it warms toward room temperature, the carbonation softens and sweet maltiness and McIntosh apples appear out of nowhere. Finishes neutral, perhaps a bit sweet malt, with no significant aftertaste. This is a very charming and tasty brew from one of my favorite German breweries. Definitely an unusual Weissbier that I highly recommend.","merlin48","Feb 03, 2004"

Some grainy maltiness detected and some very slight fruitiness but that's about it. The taste is a different story. A good hefty dose (for a hefe) of slightly sweet malt starts things off. Then the cloves kick in big time, lingering on into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slightly thick, whith a sort of fullness and good carbonation.

The flavors were of wheat grains, spices (clove), fruit (banana), light hop, some slight citrus, soft bark, yeast, alcohol and some sweet malt. The aftertaste was light and wheaty. Flavors seemed to be more pronounced then the nose as far as distinction. A crisp, clean and refreshing beer. Light bodied.

3.64,-10.8,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"It's more or less just a standard dark, German-style wheat beer. The odor is of diluted Pine-Sol (not necessarily bad at all). It's got some subdued lemon character to the taste, and the head pours big (but fades quickly). It's a good beer by all means. It's certainly not exemplary.","marburg","Feb 17, 2003"
4.35,6.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Has a nice frothy head and a apple cider color that was very hazy. Yeasty and sour fruit nose that was easy to sense coming from the large head. Has a great champagne mouth feel and goes down smoth. Tastes of sweet nut and malty ripe banana, also a dry with a teasty tart finish. Very drinkable and could enjoy in a long drinking session.","OatmattStout","Feb 12, 2003"
4.17,2.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Another beer that seems to remind me of banana nut bread. It pours a very hazy copper color and the smell is of nuts, banana, and malt. The taste had fruit and malts as well, nothing in this brew was overpowering. There was plenty of yeast to be seen in my sample. I do not know how much experience I have with this style of beer, but I found it to be a refreshing type beer. Overall, it's drinkability would be defined as easy and light.","doho95fu","Feb 07, 2003"
4.3,5.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5," There was a tingling carbonation as you would expect out of a weisse. Following that, loads of citrus and yeast hit your tongue. The beer was very refreshing and smooth. The citrus was balanced by some malts that made it less bitter than the initial flavor. There was a lot of flavor, and the complexity was very inviting. As it is a dunkel-weisse, the subtle roastiness is evident after paying close attention to the flavor. You will pick up some dark malts just before the aftertaste of this brew. It is not as roasty and dark as I had expected, but it is still a wonderful brew by Aying.","ElGuapo","Jan 23, 2003"
3.9,-4.4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Slightly hazy and brown capped by a fizzy, fine, slightly off-white lace. The usual aromas associated with this type of beer: apples, bananas, some clove, but much milder than is often the case. Where some Dunkels are assertive and stinky, this one was more passive and elegant. Very fizzy in the mouth, but not over carbonated. The medium body goes a long way in this extremely refreshing brew. Tastes are in like with the aroma but with a small amount of toasted malt. While this is far from my favorite style of beer, it is always a welcome change from the thick, rich beers I often pursue.","yen157","Jan 21, 2003"
4.13,1.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Deep copper colored liquid with a frothy ivory colored head that eventually settles to about 1/2 an inch. A scant amount of sediment floating around. Aromas of yeast, wheat, malt, and cloves. Smooth taste, nicely malty, clove taste is not too overpowering. As I look back at my reviews, I find myself liking this brewery more & more. Always available at my local store, good variety of styles, and the price is right. Recommended!","cretemixer","Jan 21, 2003"
4.88,19.6,5,4.5,5,5,5,"The beer was light brown in color with a moderately thick hear that lasted a long time. It had a very gentle malt aroma with a mild clover smell. There was no hop smell. The malt flavors were prominent at first sip but finished with a spicy clove flavor. There is no bitterness nor hop flavor. The mouthfeel was creamy and full and had a high carbonation level which tingled the tongue. Dunkle Weizen is my FAVORITE beer so I am a little prejudice, but this is probably the best of style and the best style.","LarryKemp","Jan 20, 2003"
4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours cloudy yellow, nice thick foamy head, leaves a clingy lace in the glass, aroma of wheat and bananas, banana-clove yeasty flavor, some bubblegum in the aftertaste. Light body, clean and crisp, very refreshing another one of my favorites, always good.","maxpower","Jan 08, 2003"
4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy light mahogany color with a medium-bodied white head that dissipates into a nice lace. Very fruity aroma with notes of ripe banana and clove. Sweet malts come through up front in the taste along with some fresh banana, clove, and nutmeg. Its quite crisp and a bit acidic feeling in the mouth with a nice amount of carbonation. A very enjoyable brew!","Morris729","Dec 28, 2002"
3.42,-16.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a translucent amber color with a massive head with the texture frothy and the color and off white, the lace forms a fine shade to cover the glass from view. Nose is quite complex with aromas of malt, citrus, wheat or bread dough, sweet as it the start with the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is sparsely acidic, pleasantly hopped, dry long lasting aftertaste and all in all a very drinkable beer.","Gusler","Nov 30, 2002"
4.71,15.4,5,4,5,4.5,5,"Overall, an outstanding beer. Pours as a hazy amber with a good head. Great smell that screams drink me. This one really turned me on to the style which is now one of my favorites. It has a nice fruity taste with a hint of cloves. Very smooth and will continue to be a big player in my beer rotation.","TexIndy","Nov 22, 2002"
2.7,-33.8,3,3,2.5,2,3,"Hazy orange color with a thick light beige head. Some carbonation. This is darker in color than any German Wheat I have had so far. Fruity aroma. I was kind of unimpressed with the taste. There was a definite apple cider feel to it, but it really lacked follow-through. Probably the coolest bottle cap I have seen. What is in the trees, matryoshka dolls?","Dogbrick","Nov 17, 2002"
3.8,-6.9,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Thick off white head, strong carbonation - pour slow.  Good wheat, with expected slight yeast overtones.  Nice maltiness, finishes smooth.  The ABV is 5.8%.  $3.49 for 500 ml.","jdhilt","Nov 06, 2002"

4.23,3.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Dark rich color. Fruity esters with tones of clove. Medium body with a bouquet of fruity flavors and strings of clove. Again, the clove presence is noticeable, as it is ubiquitous. A low hop profile. Overall a nice dark beer smooth and crisp. A good texture adds to the beers drinkability, however the beer in totality would better served by lees carbonation.","Mick","Sep 30, 2002"
3.48,-14.7,4,3.5,3,4,4,"A drinkable Weiss, for sure, but falls short of a good Dunkel. Plenty phenols and appropriate lactic-hefe vibe, yet not enough malt depth to achieve darkwheat status. In the end, tasty, but lacking.","inebrius","Sep 27, 2002"
4.17,2.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy light brownish with an initial creamy head that sinks far too quickly.  Great fruity nose with banana and possibly apples with some light spiciness of cloves but not too much.  The brew starts off very fruity with banana and some slightly tart, possible apple flavors before going into the sweeter side and hitting up the malt.  There are some lingering chocolate tones towards the end and you are left wanting more.  Nice full mouthfeel with just the perfect amount of carbonation that makes this brew very drinkable.  Yet another great german hefe here, I would certainly suggest this.","Murph","Sep 08, 2002"

4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ayinger does not know how to make a bad beer. This is another great one, with an apple-cider/tea color, a choppy head that dissipates, and a leathery aroma. I like the unusual, impenetrably cloudy appearance but it may put others off, and the leather-glove smell is weird but I liked it. The taste is great - tangy, fruity, spicy (cloves), hints of vanilla, banana, apple, and perhaps clay? Finish is delicious and makes you want more and more, while refreshing your thirst at the same time. I've never had a weisse quite like this and I loved it for its uniqueness, although there is a vague plastic quality that might bother others. But to me Ayinger can do no wrong. I imagine this beer could go with anything, but it made me especially crave a medium-well hamburger.","Thrasher","Jul 10, 2002"
4.32,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A nice pour with a good, lasting head and attractive color.  Smell and taste are sophisticated yet well integrated.  A tad heavy for a wheat; an excellent pairing with a meal.","BitteBier","Jun 25, 2002"
4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy amber / brown color, with a huge, creamy, off-white head. On the nose there is complex fruitiness and almost gives off a tiny hint of smokiness (I could be wrong though). On the palate there is traces of bananas, cloves, apples, and pears all rolled up together. This isnt my favorite style, but I do enjoy one during lunch with a good meal. I havent had many dunkel-weizens but this has to be one of the better versions I tasted. Overall good brew!","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 23, 2002"
3.65,-10.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Okay, this beer has a nice light amber color to it and slight aroma.  The head is a medium tan, but it didn't hold, but I don't know how long it had been on the shelf.  Interesting flavor with a slight tang to it.","Wildman","Jun 01, 2002"
