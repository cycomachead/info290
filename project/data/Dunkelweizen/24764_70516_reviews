"Great dark copper color with lots of bubbles and head, bunches of roasted malt and chestnut in the nose and flavor, but very thin in mouthfeel. Very drinkable, liked it a bunch."

"Amber in color with a moderate haze and a thin head.  The smell is classic dunked...yeast and wheat.  Clean.  I didn't get much chestnut at first, but it comes forth as you enjoy the beer.  Dryish.  Nice wheat and hop character.  Enjoyable."
"got this as an extra in a trade.  the size is perfect, poured into a pint.  good clarity, dark amber color.  i got the slightest hazelnut in the nose.  very faint hazelnut in the taste, but it was there.  A very refreshing dunkel that offered a great break from all the big beers I've been drinking lately.  An overall good beer and I'm glad I tried it."

"Finishing with a slight cola-like tack, the beer's semi-dry and slightly bitter finish is just shy of the malty-dry finish of authentic German dark wheat ale and with the bitter hop presence to compromise. Yet there's the soothing taste of chestnut to give a buttery and toasty elegance that's not often reconciled in even craft beer."

"Aroma is somewhat sulfur, toasted malt, and wheat. Flavor reveals burnt malt and wheat. There's a citrus note underneath. Not pleasant."

"Bottle from trade. Amber pour with thick white head. Smell is sweet, nutty. Taste is unique - that earthiness from the chestnuts, some roasted malt flavor, cotton candy sweetness, banana. Probably wouldnt' do this one again. Chestnuts + beer not my thing but can see how others might like it."

"O- my first from this brewery, and i have to say that I am impressed. Not normally a style that I seek out, but most definitely enjoyed and would have again. Probably the strongest nut character I have had, but they found a way to really make it work."
""
"Like an amber ale with nuts; and I mean a lot of nuts. Tasty and rather unique - I mean, I've had some beers with ""nut"" in the name, but none of them compare to this nutty one. Feels slightly light, in color and body, for this kind of beer, but not in the flavor; reminds me of a black IPA in that way. Heavily nutty in a really nice way."
""
"Overall - Not a pleasant beer after a few sips."

"Copper penny color. Just a thin wisp of carbonation covers half of the top of this brew. Pretty good clarity. Aroma is definitely nutty and malty with a hint of banana esters. The front of the palate is very nutty and on the back end I get the banana flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and refreshing, but maybe a bit too thin."

"Drinks okay, kind of middling as Brown ales go, you can taste the chestnuts to be sure. Was hoping for better on this one"

"O: Enjoyable beer without being in your face."

"Medium texture in the mouthfeel. Overall, a very solid brew. Glad it's available in bottles now."
"By the way, another plus for this brew is that it comes in a Euro bottle which is a pint and 7 oz, more bang for the buck."

"O: I have been really looking forward to having this one ever since I picked it up at Whole foods in St. Louis, MO. Still fresh tasting over a month later here in China. Has some great Weizen bock qualities which happens to be one of my favourite styles. Very flavourful, worth a try if you can get hold of it. Great by itself, it would go well with medium aged cheeses."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this would be a good everyday beer if you were looking for one with an emphasis on spices. A little lighter and spicier in flavor than I prefer, but reminiscent of traditional Belgian beers that are similarly spiced."

"Single finger head with little retention but nice lacing on a hazy orange with golden hue body. Aroma of citrus, mostly orange peel and pineapple with candy sugar as well. Flavor is much more dynamic with citrus up front but an almost nutty and woody/ oak presence in the background. Hint of toasted malts as well. Medium body an moderate carbonation. Drinkable and different but bit amazing. A beer that would pear well with many foods though."

"Flavor profile is pleasing to the palate and well-nuanced. I get a hint of malty and lightly toasty nuts (chestnut?) and a wisp of light citrus hops at the finish. I drank this one almost room temperature, and it was a delicious and worthwhile experience. Very good!"
""
"Pours a hazed slighty orange tinted hazlenut brown, little to no head, only some off-white rings on the outer edges. Mild nose with faint roasted nuts, light caramel and a somewhat baked dessert profile - brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg. Taste adds a splash of floral and herbal qualities, but the main notes are still the lightly toasted nuts, light caramel and nougat like sweetness. Lighter side of medium bodied, lightly watery and under-carbonated. Some positive notes, but washed out by the thin body and weak scent and flavor profile."
""
"Overall OK but not great. Very interesting and unique, but not a beer i could drink much of as it has a lot of weird flavors for a beer."
"O - Malty, nut focused session beer."
""
"Feels medium in body, a little carbonated but not too much, and wetting to the palate."

"This is one of my favorite UCBC brews. Very flavorful and easy to drink. Nice hop notes mixed with great malt notes and an interesting infusion of chestnuts."

"Served this beer on tap, at the brewery, in a pint glass. Poured a amber orange color, produced an average white head, excellent retention and lacing. The aroma of this spiced beer consisted of sweet malted grain, and some spice- nutmeg perhaps? Medium in body, this ale had a backbone of sweet malted grain and some spicy nutmeg. Brewed with chestnuts, however I can't really detect much of a nutty flavor. Finishes with a citric hop flair. Overall, great session beer- Unique- something I would order again. Prost!"

"D - really nice beer from urban chestnut. I have made this a staple in my st Louis repertoire."

"On tap at the Hilton rooftop in St. Louis. Waitress said it was an ""amber", so a bit of a surprise there, but I'll try to review to the actual style. No head on the beer when it arrived, dark copper color without much in the way of bubbles. I was surprised off the bat by how sweet the beer was. Not overtly or cloyingly, but enough to seem out-of-place. Once my tongue adjusted to that, I found a medicinal, slightly metallic, flavor waiting for me which would last through the next 3/4 of the glass until I finally gave up on it. Felt a bit undercarbonated, and had an unpleasant aftertaste. It's possible this beer wasn't getting a fair presentation; I'd be pretty surprised if this bar does proper draft line maintenance; but I don't see myself rushing out to give this beer another try elsewhere."
"Overall Impression- First of all, if I were to have a beer on-tap @ my home, this one would be in my house all the time! Perfect balanced beer with some of the best spices added. I would recommend ANYONE trying this one from UCBC before any of their others and then you can branch out from here. Have had this one @ over 6 beer bars (including UCBC) and the quality, taste, and results are always the same! A+"
"Winged Nut pours out a nutty light brown with a fluffy white head perched on top. The beer's aroma is both complex and inviting. Thanks to the use of that Bavarian weissbier yeast strain, Winged Nut gives off wonderfully sweet banana esters. Behind the yeasty aromas you're also greeted by the light and dry pop of the finely milled chestnuts the beer is brewed with. The beer tastes similar to the way it smells - a wonderful balance between the sweet yeast notes, some rich Munich malts, and the dry chestnuts on the finish of the beer. A lot of nut beers are one and done, but UCBC finds a way to make it a session beer."
"Beer is hazy in a snifter. Coppery amber color. Smells lightly of toasted nuts. Flavors are similar to aroma. Light and nutty- chestnuts to be specific. Mild and easy to drink. Just a hint of astringency. Becomes more floral in aroma and taste as it warms."
"Overall this brew is delicious and unique... I've never quite had anything like it."
"Not in PA for very long, which disappoints me. I hope they bring this one back for next year's Philly Beer Week."
