The taste comes through with a blast of spice: cinnamon, clove, brown sugar, allspice, and black pepper. Some mild dark wheat and banana notes populate the background, but they're clearly relegated to the supporting cast (they're petitioning for more than their couple o' lines apiece, but the director seems to be a bit of an ass...). Something akin to mild tea sits amongst the scenery behind everything else. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel.

I'm glad I put in the the kegerator when I did, otherwise my cellar might have been a tad stickier. The nose is interesting. Muted notes of caramel and toast mixed with green apple skins and pie cherries. The flavor is much the same but the sour pie cherries and green apples dominate the flavor profile pushing the caramel and toast to the outskirts of the flavor profile. It's not horrific at all, but it doesn't seem like its supposed to be there either. Its not a bad beer, but I think its turned into something that its not supposed to be. I once had a barleywine that picked up a slight infection that just lent itself to a mild tartness in the background. Made it really tasty. This is more along the same lines. Malt is still there, but its definitely secondary the the tartness of the beer. It kind of hits you in the back of the jaw.","hwwty4","Mar 14, 2010"

Beer is dark chestnut hue with garnet tints and fizzy beige head of 4 cm foaming up even with a gentle pour, would have overflowed without precautions taken. Aroma is chocolate malt and roasted notes a little fruity, but not as complex as I had hoped. Not too much twang in there either. First sip reveals an average body and rolling gentle carbonation. Flavor is very mild but similar to nose with bits of brown sugar and chocolate and a hint of dark red fruit, plums??. No hops or ABV show through, but again not very complex flavor. The beer is an easy drinker, but I was hoping for more subtleties and mix of flavors. I am a little disappointed.","sulldaddy","Nov 03, 2009"

1.82,-49.3,3,1,2,3,1.5,"So after a delicate twenty minute long pour the beer is finally ready to be drank. How annoying. The beer is a dark brown color (perhaps the darkest dunkelweizen I've yet seen, but alright). The head is massive, and doesn't recedes. The aroma has the nasty chemically breadiness to it. It smells nothing like a dunkelweizen. Unfortunately this translates over into the taste. There is some roasted malt, and chocolate with a hint of yeast that cover some of it up, but it is still there. It is also lacking of the usual banana bread and clove that are expected in the dunkelweizen. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with likely carbonation. Overall, this beer doesn't do it for me. It seems like Two Brothers was trying for a dunkelweizen/porter hybrid along the lines of New Glarus Black Wheat. If that is truly what they were going for they were completely off. On the other hand if they were going for a traditional dunkelweizen they were way off too. The aroma makes me scared with every sip that it will taste like it smells. That, and the over carbonated pour make this beer a something I would not recommend.","KarlHungus","0"

Midway dark wheat flavors emerge on the tongue with clove, nuts, and cocoa powder. Unfortunately this beer suffers in the aftertaste with a wet carboard flavor, caramel, and ashy bark. Light to medium body with a somewhat smooth feel but the strong carbonation sting really gets in the way. I must say though, the 7.5% is hidden quite well.

The body is thinner than a dunkelweisse/weizenbock, about as light as a standard hefeweizen. I finished the pint, but didn't really enjoy it. This is a brand new keg, as this was just released. I don't have high hopes for the bottled version, although this may be a bad draft line issue (not likely looking at other bottle reviews).","emerge077","Nov 04, 2008"
4.03,12.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"A lightly hazy dark wheat beer with a thin but persistent white head, aromas of wheat malt, chocolate, and banana/clove yeast notes, leaning more toward the clove. Solid toasted malt flavor with enough roastiness to balance. Little hop presence until the aftertaste. A very easy-drinking beer for one with as much flavor as it has and a welcome addition to TBB's lineup. Since it uses the same yeast and hops as their year-round Ebel Weiss brew, I would not be surprised to see this one make a return appearance, maybe next year.","MillRat","Beers"
