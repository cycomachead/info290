Hints of black pepper and clove dominate at first but are soon countered by some sourdough bread and banana before some citric acidity kicks in on the back end. The malt presence isn't as prominent as in the nose but it's still evident with subtle roast and hints of toasted malt, hazelnut, caramel and toffee. Decent amount of sweetness without taking away from the classic wheat beer flavors. Slightly tart lemon juice/pith flavor toward the back of the palate. Crisp and refreshing and while it's heavier than an average weissebier, it's still pretty easy to drink.","corby112","Apr 20, 2014"

Cloudy chocolate brown pour with a huge three finger beige head with great retention and nice lacing. Malty, spicy, earthy nose with hints of brown bread, banana, dark fruits, toffee, and subtle cloves. The taste follows suit with big banana bread notes along with hints of toast, cocoa, spicy hops, nutmeg, dark fruits, toffee, nuts, cloves, and just a touch of cinnamon. The mouthfeel is lighter bodied than I had expected, but still substantial and slightly chewy. Subtle fizzy carbonation, great balance, and hugely drinkable.

The nose is all sorts of dunkelweizen delicious ridiculousness. Caramelized bananas spiced with cloves and dusted with cocoa just jump straight out of the glass, exceptionally flavorful and balanced. Minimal roast with some toffee, honey and toasted wheat bread are present. The palate is like an alcoholic candy bar, and I mean in the most refined and addictive kind of way. Sweet bananas tempered by toasted wheat and a carbonic acidity; a delicate but fresh and clean clove phenolic character balanced by a touch of chocolate; and a mellow hop character with earth pairing beautifully with the spice and sweetness, this beer is outrageously good. Medium light in body, crisp but creamy in carbonation, this beer finishes dry with a blend of banana, clove and cocoa. The wheat huskiness and carbonic acid lend  a cleansing bite to the finish, making this downright quaffable if a hair watery. Still, this is outstanding. Very highly recommended.

The scent, beautiful colour, and the little bite at the end were nice, but this one just didn't have the complete package. Won't be looking for it again.","Jeffo","Oct 31, 2008"
4.2,5.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer has a thick head, almost like Guinness from the tap. The beer is very dark, almost black. I could smell cloves and a hint of malt. The initial taste was that of cloves and banana bread, and the aftertaste had a roasted malt character to it. As I drank more of the beer, I noticed more of a chocolate taste.","deg","Oct 02, 2008"

3.64,-8.3,4.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Taste was great without the vegetables and much better balanced. Ripe bananas with some exotic fruit with caramel and dark chocolate. There is also some powdery cocao in taste and mouthfeel, which is also slightly sweet and sticky. The yeast adds a nice phenolic taste and makes the mouthfeel a little coarse (?)","Absumaster","Apr 04, 2006"
3.33,-16.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"BB15-11-06.Cola to coffeeblack beer and a beige head above. Nose is bananas floating around in a sweet wet grass field. Quiet some maltyness but no roast detectable and bit of butter there. Not a bad beer but the whole beer is comming as a mess to me, quiet unbalanced as is taste. Dry and caramellic dont fit together and missing a burnt feeling in a dark beer as this is, though having quiet some bitterness for a wheatbeer as this is. Litle more wheat detectable in taste as in nose but wouldn't give this a weizenbeer when tasted blindly except maybe for the mega bananatree that's right there. Still well drinkable and certainly something else as the regular.","paterlodie","Nov 22, 2005"

3.81,-4,4.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Sampled on 10/10/05 at Probka, the beer came out a cloudy caramel brown under 3.5 fingers of thick beige head that lingered throughout the session and left some very nice lacing. The nose is marked by yeast and lemon, but is fairly mild. The mouth is light and very prickly. The taste is mild and characterized by yeast, slightly heavier than a pale, with subtle coriander and fruit. A bit of caramel emerges as it warms, but hops are nowhere to be found. Mild, smooth and nice brew.","Globetrotter","Aug 30, 2005"
3.28,-17.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"I don't really know what I think about this beer. I guess I just expected more from Andechs on this one. A very dark opaque body, almost black, with a lasting thick bubbly head on top (not exuberantly foamy though). The smell was kinda weak, showing some light bready notes and hints of the traditional weizen styles, with a lot more emphasis on caramel. The taste too, was very caramely for a dunkel weizen, toasted and lamost burnt. The classic bready weizen thing was almost hidden. Mouthfeel was round, but the brew overall lacked of balanced, not fitting right into its style. Not bad, but just nothing in comparison with their doppelbock.","tjd25","Jun 14, 2005"
4.25,7.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"500 ml bottle, bought in Germany. ABV is 5.0%. Cloudy dark brown colour, enormous thick and creamy light tan head. Lovely aroma of brown bread, yeast, cloves, banana and caramel. Flavour has malts, caramel, chocolate and cloves, some hops in the fairly dry finish. I had it on its own, must be good with food too. A very fine dunkelweizen.","Sigmund","May 14, 2005"
