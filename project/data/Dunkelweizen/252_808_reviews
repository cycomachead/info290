"Very tasty beer! Scents of fruitiness and hops dominate when the bottle is cracked. I smelled either hickory or some other smokey kind of scent about half way through the bottle. I tasted caramel, cinnamon, and very subtle banana bread. 30 seconds after a sip I can taste some sort of berry flavor which is sweet, like strawberries along side a gentle maltiness. Somewhat complex, and a good beer to share with a close friend at a bbq for those who like to savor a beer. Overall, very pleasant beer. My favorite so far from Weihenstephan."

"Overall, this was a wonderful offering on a cold SE Alaskan Spring afternoon."
"Enjoy"

"- one of my favorite german beers and is a go to for me"
"Nose highlights lots of brown malts and fruity esters.  Flavors start with a welcoming brown malty sweetness, then a sour apple fruity esters, and ends with clove spice. Minimal hop presence. Perfect level of carbonation. Clean and refreshing."
"Drink at approximately 41 degrees for best malt aftertaste"
"     Overall, I'll give Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel - Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan a 4.75. This is a very easy drinking dunkel that has just the right amount of taste."
""
"This is the best beer I have ever had. The look taste and aroma are spectacular. If you haven't tried this beer you are missing out!"
"An amazing dunkel! One of the fullest, laciest, most perfect heads of all time..."
""
"O: too much nutmeg character for my taste:"
"Pours amber-brown beer with perfect creamy golden head. Retention lasts  and lasts. Smell of wheat, banana, fresh, but not very complex.Taste is heavenly & balanced - spices, wheat, smooth, clove. Full body and medium carbonation, the best dunkelweizen."
""
""
""
""
"Smells beautifully and tastes very smooth with a nice light fruity finish. After trying the Hefeweizen and really enjoying it I went and bought this one. Not sure which one I enjoy more. I will be buying this again soon."
""
"16.9 oz bottle poured into weizen glass. Appearance is cloudy brown that goes from diluted iced tea at the bottom to caramel at the top. A billowing tan head settles to a cap of tiny bubbles. Aroma is clove and other mulling spices, yeast, tart apple, green banana, and some sweet malt and earthy bitterness on the finish. Taste is medium banana bread sweetness initially, assertive clove spice, and light caramel on the swallow. Light-medium body, super full,creamy texture, lively carbonation, and a long mouth-coating malt and clove finish."
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious and refreshing wheat beer, notable for its subtle balance. Rating it is hard because I don't know a lot of wheat beers and this one seems to check all the right boxes. I definitely like that it's not too sweet. That said, it didn't bowl me over - I guess it could be a matter of the style and personal preference. Also, I guess it would be better on a hot July day versus a freezing cold February night ;-) Anyway, highly recommended as an authentic German wheat beer, despite the price tag."

"This is my 2nd offering from Weihenstephaner. Poured from bottle into an oversized pilsner glass.  You can see the yeast as you pour it, which isn't always the case with inferior hefeweizen beers. Color is a cloudy amber while being poured then settles into a tobacco brown with plenty of visible yeast, and a two-finger white head that slowly dissipates with almost no lacing. Smells like wheat bread, I am not kidding. Reminded me of Sara Lee. The taste is very bready, with rich wheat flavors and little hop presence and a sweet finish. Definitely the best wheat beer I've ever had. Carbonation is lively, and doesn't feel very heavy at all. However, it is very filling, a true meal in a bottle.

""
""
"Excellent. First rate. Yummy. Complex and rewarding."
"Pours an unpleasant murky dishwater brown, however creamy head that does not dissipate soon.  Smell is once again wonderful cloves and some banana.  Taste, wow!  The banana and yeast jumps out with the great clove finish.  Mouthfeel is tough to beat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Very similar to the base hefeweissbier with a bit of caramel and more emphasis on the banana."
""

"Apsolute beer perfection!!! As much as I love their Hefe, there Dunkel is even better! My all time favorite beer & probably second to only water for favorite liquid consumable!"
""
"It has taken me far too long to getting to try this stuff.  Let's do it.  It pours a mostly clear tawny topped by a finger or so of sandstone foam.  The nose comprises clove, orange zest, and cracked wheat.  The taste brings in more of the same, with a lot more clove and a hint of chocolate powder.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a damn tasty dunkelweizen, well worthy of its lofty reputation."
""
"Overall: another great example of the traditional German wheat beer from Weihenstephan - a classic. Good value too for an equivalent of AU$70 a case. One of the best wheat beers I have had - well worth it."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this side by side with Ayinger Ur-Weiss and preferred the Ayinger.  Comparably, they were very similar in flavor but the Ayinger had it beat in aroma and had a little more body to it.  I will come back to this beer again as I am a huge fan of Weihenstephaner's original Hefeweissbier and they are great values at "

"I like this a bit better than the Hefeweisen from the same brewer - it's more subdued in it's flavoring but not at all boring.  Just tasty as heck."

"Pours a dark brown-copper color with a good 4-finger foamy off-white head that settles down to a good 1/2+ finger. A good amount of lacing is seen that sticks to the glass. Great aroma of German malts and hops with a dark bread aroma as well. Even more going on with the taste as this is very flavorful, more with every sip. Medium+/Full bodied with perfect carbonation but not a 'heavy' beer. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. This is a fantastic brew like their others since this the World's Oldest Brewery from 1040!

"This is a very delicious, hearty, and satisfying beer with an alluring appearance, delightful aroma, and invigorating taste."
""
"Ahhhh....an incredible drinker....pours dark amber with fairly heavy carbonation. Smell is banana/clove with a hint of yeast. Taste picks up the banana and clove right away but the maltiness and tinge of the roasted malts comes through. The flavor explodes in your mouth....is there a better summertime beer than this?  German purity and craftsmanship at play here"

"O - no ones seems to do weizen styles better than the Germans. While the USAs best offering are often hop forward, Weihenstephaner always seems to brew beer that is complex and interesting without going to extremes. This one is a definite yes as Daniel Bryan would say."
"O - Fantastic. Best example of the style I have had and a definitely rebuy. Well crafted."

"O: 4 This beer is very nice, however it is not particularly interesting. As mentioned above, it’s very similar to the original version but there’s a little less going on. I was hoping for a bit more roasted malt to come through on the nose and palate, but it’s still very good and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just a fantastic beer. Weihenstephaner makes the best hefeweizen in the world, and they certainly can throw their hat into the ring on dunkelweizen as well--if you like clove and spice and everything nice. I also must say that the flavor profiles come through a lot more aggressively on tap than when I've had this out of the bottle. Not sure if that's due to a freshness issue and the likelihood that a keg will be fresher than a bottle, but this is by far the most I've ever enjoyed this beer."
"Overall: A delicious dunkel."
""
""
""
""
""
"A dunkel that cannot disappoint."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great dunkel! Would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
"Taste is super malty. The wheat is everywhere, buttery and slightly sweet, but not overly so. Crisp and zesty almost blueberry flavor. Malt all the way through to the end. Nothing harsh, very mild in all respects. Very smooth feel, nice carbonation. Goes down easy, very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a mellow beer with a nice malty, wheat taste. Almost no bitterness and very enjoyable."
""
"This pint-plus bottle was purchased for $3.49 at Hennessey Grocery in Butte, Montana. This strikes me as quite an excellent deal, considering the obvious excellence of this beer (and the distance traveled!). Kudos to the Hennessey for making this exotic foreign beer available in my little corner of the mountains..."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is yet another good wheat beer from Weihenstephan. I don't know that this brew provides the malt flavors I would expect from the style, which hurts the score, but the wheat beer aspect of this thing is nailed. Good looks, nice feel, inviting aroma, but a bit mild on the palate."

"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Cloudy amber-orange pour with a beautiful four finger off-white head with great retention and lacing. The nose is big and earthy with lots of banana and brown bread along with hints of clove, toffee, caramel, and brown sugar. The taste mirrors the nose with huge notes of brown bread, banana, and clove along with hints of caramel, nuts, apple skin, pear, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is smooth and subtly creamy with perfect carbonation and a great balanced finish. Overall, I've never been much of a fan of wheat beers, which sucks having lived in Germany so long. But I've recently had some great experiences with them and have decided to re-explore the style. This is an amazingly flavorful beer that's hugely drinkable extremely well balanced. It will definitely be restocked in the beer fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation, I don't know if that was the elevation or the beer. Clean finish and minimal aftertaste. Great for a starter at a beer tasting party."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a dunkel fan...but this is pretty good. The beer poured a hazy brown with 1/2 finger thick head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent and taste carries hints of banana and clove along with a touch of roast and earth. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a great beer and worth a try."
""
""
"Overall: One of the best beers you could ever have. Not much difference from the regular hefe."
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.75 - Very smooth, another great one by Weihenstephaner."
""
""
""
"Overall - A pleasant, sophisticated lager. Many interesting flavors come together to produce this eminently drinkable beer. This beer would go well with a nice steak dinner. Weihenstephaner is one of those rare breweries that can do no wrong."

"O-the malt flavor with a good banana fruit taste that has a great balance"

"DATE TASTED: January 11, 2014... GLASSWARE: Weihenstephaner weizen glass...OCCASION: n unseasonably warm January night... APPEARANCE: cloudy brown, iced tea-colored body; thick, blanketing off-white head that settles with strength; lacing is nonexistent?... AROMA: dampened wheat esters; suppressed citrus sits below fragrant bubblegum; an extra malty presence manifests as dough... PALATE: soft, almost fizzy, warming--and highly drinkable; a six-pack of bombers seems possible!...TASTE: doughy, bready flavor balanced by bubblegum and resin; banana, clove and pear as well--not surprisingly, a beer well put together... OVERALL: as Weihenstephaners go, in the same class as its classic; a bit more filling than the hefe, but not as clean or articulated..."
""
""
"O: Make no mistake, this really hits the spot in all the right ways. This is yet another solid offering from Weihenstephaner."
""
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a genuine weizen glass. Rather lighter than I was expecting color-wise, a light reddish bronze with copious tan foam. Aroma is immediately spicy and semi-sweet, with clove, fresh ripe bananas, toffee, and dark bread crust all vying for attention. I was immediately struck by the sensuous, smooth, creamy mouthfeel ... Great weizen texture, rather chewy but smooth as a cue ball. As is the case for Weihenstephan's lighter-colored weissbier proper, there are a lot of clove phenolics on the palate, clove trumping the sweeter elements, but there is ample banana as well along with what registers as vanilla to my palate. Nice banana bread effect with clove and allspice accents, some sultana raisin, and cooked pears, a tinge of berry. Great stuff. The malt flavors are distinguished and classy, not aggressive, leaving plenty of room for the spice and fruit to shine through. The mouthfeel is amazing. An essential and iconic example of the style."

"Pours a fairly clear reddish brown with a huge fluffy tan head that persists forever. Aromas of clove with hints of banana and peeper with a solid shot of caramelized brown sugary malt. The flavor is rich dark sugary malt sweetness with some clove and pepper to counter. Little to no hop presence. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable, not horribly complex but definitely a solid quaffer."

"O - its been so long since I've had this gem. Too long... This is on equal terms with all the other favorites from Weihenstephan. The stick to traditional German styles and rightfully so, its delicious and they do it as good as anyone. Ill buy this again and again. It's just another solid and truly great wheat beer from this German Genius of a brewery."
"This wins. The look is great. I've never seen another beer look like this, with its murky brown and perfect head. Banana is the main flavor I find in both smell and taste. It really is excellent. All around, this is an outstanding brew. Absolutely, I would get this again."
"O: great beer. I wish i could find it more often. would like to have a few of these on hand at all times"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Got the Weihenstaphan variety pack as an early Christmas present from my mother in law and did not disappoint. I am a huge fan of Dunkels and this may be on the lighter side but still has it's own distinct flavor to it. The German hops take precedent in this beer early and stay through all the way to the last sip. Poured a great dark amber color with a cloudiness to it as well. A small finger width head with an easy not overwhelming aroma. Sweet malty flavor followed by a fruitiness, however not overpowering at all. This is a great beer from a great brewery and I will always hold a spot in my heart for the Weihenstaphan brewery!"
""
""
""
"O- A fine example of a dark wheat. Would prefer a bit more depth in the body with some nuttiness or added complexity, but very delicious still."
""
""
""
""
""

"Maybe my favorite dunkelweizen in the world, this is a true classic. A delight on tap, if you can get it."

"One of my favorite beers that I had ticked as a 5.0. Wanted to do a full review to see how it would stand up to the individual scrutiny. While it does not hold up the 5.0 in each category this is one of the best tasting beers in the world in my opinion. Simply outstanding."
""

"Overall - Top quality again from this brewery. Nice light, smooth easy to drink flavors, nice balance, nice flavor. I wouldn't take this over the original hefe but its still quality, and worth a drink."

"Overall: Beautiful beer and should be as well respected as it is. Not my favorite from Weihenstephaner but still remains the best of its style. The more apparent spices and toasted malt set this beer apart from regular weissbiers and for that reason...its good. props to beer love pow"
""
""

""
""
"Hefeweissbier Dunkel pours a darker cooper color, with a nice frothy large lacing head. There is a sweet grilled charcoal aroma. The taste is complex. Lots of crisp wheat and malt undertones with a sweet, but not too sweet candy like flavor. Flavors come together so well, and nice crisp carbonation, not overpowering. Overall WOW."

"Taste is wonderful, it follows the aroma very closely. The roasted notes are a bit bigger in the taste than the are in the aroma. Banana and bubblegum are here again, along with the clove, but it seems to blend better in this one compared to the regular hefe. The feel is very good as well, light bodied, nicely carbonated, and coats the palate perfectly. I think this loses nothing from their other hefe. Quality German dink for a quality German night."
""
""
""
""
"O - I just can't think of a scenario where I'd rather have a dunkel over a weizenbock..."
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a big tan head that is slow to fade away. Smell is banana, clove and spices. Banana flavor stands out the most with some of the spice and malt flavor in there as well. Medium body with lower amount of carbonation. Overall a great beer nice and smooth without the weird aftertaste you get with a beer this style."

"o: A very tasty and refreshing brew. Just seems to blur any lines between Belgian and Bavarian. More fruity than I expected a German Weissbeir Dunkel to be."
""
"Pours light to dark brown, 1/2 inch bubbly fizzy white foam. Fruity esthers, loads of banana and clove. Classic german. Hefe nose with an edge. Light wheaty flavor. Smooth. Very fresh. Quite refreshing."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An enjoyable, easy to drink beer that is full of flavour"
""
""
""
""
""
"Vibrant is my favorite word to describe the malt character of a good hefe. It's a beer that lets it's malt shine. This one flowed like silk and had plenty of bread to offer but nothing heavy. Sweet, round and creamy. The mouthfeel is supple and sensational. The sweetness lies delicately and just underneath every flavor quality giving it it's dark character with the nuts and grain. Spirited, civilized, sensational. There's a good reason that this is one of the oldest brewers in the world and that they do hefewiezens so well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I love their hefeweizen and I actually like this one more. The dark malt bill adds a ton of complexity to the usual hefeweizen flavor profile. It goes down so smooth too. I can't believe I have not had more dunkelweizens in my life, but this is incredible."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A new favorite, a very excellent beer that will go with about anything."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-Not surprisingly it is great beer from what is probably my favorite brewery. It should please any beer drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Now this is a Dunkel"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O/D-This brought a lot to the table. Its cheap, its complex, its easy drinking and its mysterious. I can see why anything with the Weihenstephaner label is regarded as beer royalty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Again, wheat beers really aren't my style. This is one of, if not the best wheat beer I've ever had. It's nothing that I'll sprint to the store to buy more of, but I'd highly recommend it to any wheat beer or strong flavored beer in general fans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bit disappointing, but only in comparison with Hefeweissbier by the same brewery. This is still outstanding beer. Not great fan of dunkelweizen, but this was worth trying."
"Overall - Really nice, spectacular really and can almost live up to the comparisons to its lighter brother. Probably something that would be enjoyed most in spring and fall, given the overall crispness of the beer, but retention of its full taste, although could certainly be enjoyed any time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serve at 45F+ to bring out the taste/aroma profile."
""
""
""
""
"O - Still prefer the standard hefeweizen, but this is certainly up there among the best beers that I've had recently. The mouthfeel in particular makes it a joy to swish around and explore the different flavors that permeate that beautiful beer."
""
""
"Price Point - $3.19/ 16.9 oz. bottle"
""
""
""
"O: This is a great example of this style from a brewery who excels at it. I preferred the lighter version, but this was still enjoyable. If you enjoy the German style I would definitely look this beer up along with the other beers from Weihenstephaner. If you're not, this probably won't be your speed."
""
""
""
"Overall: I could drink this all day, especially on hot summer days. This is a very refreshing beer that is perfect as a session ale."
"overall: One of the best Dunkels out there, and while Weihenstephaner may have the best Hefe, I think I prefer Franziskaner's Dunkel to this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer and a fantastic introduction in to the dunkel style. I'm loving it for the change it brings, but If I had a choice between this and their original Hefeweizen, I'd have to pick the original. Both are worth a definitely shot and amazing, try them and find your favorite."
""
""
""
"Slightly warming, very light effervescence. Medium bodied. Slightly watery at the start but filling in nicely midway through the finish. Good stuff, Maynard."

"Overall I have to say this is the weakest Weihenstephaner offering I have had. I have no issue with how it was brewed per se, but the combination of flavors (or lack thereof) make it tough to say I would want to have this again."

"Overall. I was surprised by how much I like this one."
"Atmosphere is pretty great. Nice head, and lacing. Nose is full and flavorful. Flavor is nutty, and malty with some hints of caramel. Very well balanced. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great Dunkel my only gripe is not much dark fruit or dark color but I can let that slide since this beer is pure delicious."
""
""
"Pours a murky, burnt honey color with a cap of thick, craggy, beige foam. Aroma is fairly mild, smelling of caramel, banana, cloves, and yeast. The flavor perfectly matches the aroma, so I won't reiterate it here. I will say that the mouthfeel is divine, as the effervescent carbonation complements the flavor and body perfectly. This is very similar to their hefeweizen, just with more of a caramel flavor, which I actually find to be a little too sweet for my tastes. With that said, it's right for the style, and there's no denying the execution. This is one flavorful and refreshing beer."

"A wonderful version of the Hefeweizen that Weihenstephaner makes. Extremely drinkable and smooth. Great flavors. I prefer bigger malts, like the Weizenbock. Quite good however."

"overall: I was happily surprised by this beer. Some of these old European breweries have beer that tastes remarkably similar (mostly due to the purity laws), but this beer and this style incredible delightful. The cost on this beer is extremely low compared to the quality (I believe it was around 3 dollars). Would highly recommend this beer to anyone."

"epic value at under 4 bucks per bottle. the pour is really cloudy brownish pinkish color, kind of odd really, with a really robust pure white head of thick foam, long lasting, and leaves good lace. the color is funky, and I think this is far superior on tap, but the beer itself is amazing. it smells like good german hefe yeast and dark wheat malt, some solid toast on the grains, and a refreshing citrus element. the flavor is identical to the nose, rich and complex, quite fruity, but a little more roast than the weizenbock or the regular hef. I like the additional body it provides, there is a nice soft feel too, although the carbonation is still quite lively. its traditional, its cheap, and its damn good. how can you beat that? I think of the four ive had from this brewery, I like the regular hefe the best, but all have been extraordinary. again, the value cannot be beat!"

"Poured into a Weiss Beer glass which developed a tan frothy head. Head was full and lasting with little lacing. Aroma was hoppy, almost grainy with a hint of sweetness and malt, Appearance was a light brown / straw color with a cloudy hue. Taste was clean and hoppy with hints of citrus and grain and slight caramel. Tasted more like a Weiss than a dark Weiss. Aftertaste was clean and dry with a light dry mouthfeel."

"Overall, I rate this right up there with the Hofbrau Dunkel Weisse as one of the best beers I have ever had."

"Final Grade: 4.33, a solid A grade. Although I have always been a pretty big hefeweizen fan, dunkelweizen acceptance has eluded me - probably because there have never been any particularly good ones available locally. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel changes all that for me, as it shows the same level of quality and craftsmanship as their flagship hefe. Even though I probably like the hefe a bit more, this stuff is still a strong contender in the wheat beer category, and undoubtedly the best dunkel I've ever had. This is a delicious brew, and no fan of German wheat beer should hesitate to try it. A magnificent selection for my 400th review on BA, one that I will assuredly pick up again soon."

"The beer tastes of subdued banana, spicy clove, and sweet wheat grain. It begins surprisingly light with hints of plantains, before opening into unripe banana flavors with spicy clove notes, and then folding into a thick wheat grain and spice flavoring that lasts in the mouth. In the middle of the taste there is also an almost-pear flavor alongside the banana esters of the yeast, and there also rich caramel notes alongside the wheat grain in the aftertaste. On the mouth, the beer feels creamy and smooth, with a medium body. Carbonation is velvety, and the tongue is left sticky in the back with malty saliva, while the rest of the mouth feels quite dry. Overall this is a lovely Dunkelweizen. I feel that some of the rich banana esters from Weihenstephan’s Hefeweizen are lost here in the darker malts, which is too bad, but the addition of heavy wheat grain flavors is nice. The smell is definitely more complex than the taste though. This beer is a classic and definitely worthy of a taste, though I hold their Hefeweizen up as a better beer than this."
"Mouthfeel is thick, but super sessionable."

"Overall a delicious, fulfilling brew. Like their hereweissbeir but more flavorful."

"C-"

"Overall: I do like this dunkel, but was not wowed by it. Maybe my palette is off tonight. I ought to give it another go."
""
"Not as good as the classic Weihen hefe but still a very good beer, more yeast and malt flavor but doesn't seem to pull together as well as the classic."
"Another amazing brew by Weihenstephaner. Hits all the marks and traits you'd expect from a hefeweissbier - bananas, cloves, breads, yeast, toasty malts, etc. Remains simple while exceeding at everything it does. This is a must-try, and the best part is that it's readily available in most places."
"Overall style wise it scores 4.25-4.5 Personally It is a good beer but nothing that i am a fan of. I did not like it much. 3.5"
""
""
"Amber and brown in color with a slight chill haze. Poured with a huge, billowy off-white foam with excellent staying power that leave thick sheets of lacings on the glass. Sweet banana and clove aromas with an earthy sweet toasted malt aroma beneath. Creamy smooth delicate feel with a clean crisp finish. Combination of sweet banana and light toasted malt flavors up front followed by spicy clove flavors through the middle that usher in a light hop bitterness toward the end. Like the feel the flavors finish clean and crisp with a sweet fruity banana aftertaste. Fabulous, earthy, delicate aromas, flavors and feel."

"The fact that Hefeweissbier Dunkel is not my favorite of Weihenstephaner's beers ought to evince my admiration for this brewery. Each of their beers shows the kind of elegant balance that most breweries can only dream of achieving. Do yourself a favor and pick up a bottle."
"Overall - style defining beer, love duknelweizens."
""

"Served from growler into a sampler shaker. Poured a very hazy yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, banana, fruit, and subtle clove. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, banana, fruit, clove, and spice. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I really liked the spice aspect going on in this one as it added quite a nice touch to all of the typical bread and fruit flavors you would typically expect from the style. It was very easy on the palate and fairly well balanced throughout. Definitely worth trying for the curious and the fans of the style alike. A must try."

"(4.0) D: A solid Weihenstephaner option and a nice style to enjoy this time of year, while mother nature transitions from summer to fall. Great stuff."

"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a murky medium copper color, thick off white head with great retention and lacing. Pleasant banana, clove, caramel and wheat aroma. What a pleasant beer! Nice floral, almost Belgian spicy taste with a dry, slightly hopped and floral aftertaste. A medium pleasant malt in the middle. Refreshing and clean. A delightful beer. This is one of the worlds greatest breweries."
""

""

"Pours hazy dark reddish-brown with a large, off-white head that dissipates quickly, but about a two finger length of head is retained before consumption. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are strong notes of banana and clove in the nose. There is plenty of wheat malt in the aroma as well. There is mild sweetness and breadiness from the malt and the yeast expression comes through very well with the banana flavor and spiciness. The body is medium with abundant carbonation. The finish is smooth and dry. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent and refreshing beer."

"Dangerously drinkable and very highly recommended."

"Overall --- The hefeweizen from Weihenstephaner was the first “good” beer that I had many years ago, so I have been looking forward to giving their other offerings a try for quite some time. All I have to say is wow-wee-wee-wah, I just want more and more of this. I am generally not a fan of wheat beers, but this blew me away. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants try try a great dunkel weizen, or any type of very good beer."
"Overall: This is my standard for dunkelweiss styles. It’s the first one I ever tried, I’ve had many since, and nothing tops the Weihenstephaner version. I guess it shouldn’t be a surprise that the oldest brewery in the world still makes some of the best beer in the world."
"Pours an amber brown colour with a big, billowy white head with plenty of retention. Lace sticks to the glass. A little bit of yeast floats in the glass. Aroma of cloves, bananas, sweet bready malts. Tastes just like it smells. Reminds me of spiced banana bread. Mouthfeel is light, smooth and creamy. An excellent beer."
""
""
"An ideal dunkel."
""
"Pours a hazy brownish orange colour, two fingers of white head, quite a bit of lace. Smell is of sweet malt with some banana and bubblegum, lots of yeasty qualities, clove and other spice there as well, almost a little 'christmas' like at times, also light cocoa/chocolate points. Taste is of darker sweet malts, dark bread like, bits of banana and slightly yeasty, a cocoa like sweetness, quite spicy, clove and pepper as well, the finish had a bit of warm spice thats kind of cinnamon like, spicy aftertaste. Medium and fairly active carbonation, medium body and a touch creamy. Very nice stuff here, very drinkable and something I will pick up as frequent as possible, spectacular on a nice warm day."

"overall: I didn't really like it at first. But i drank a regular Hefeweis, followed by this one. And then it really is kind of weird. Later i tried it just as a starter, and the more i drink it, the better it seems to get. It's got more depth to it than i thought at the beginning. Very nice refreshing beer with different flavors each time you drink it."
""
""
""
""
"I bought the big bottle of this and could have easily had another, since the alcohol was nearly undetectable. This was nicely balanced because of the dark malt and readily enjoyable. Anyone looking for a textbook example of this style need not look any further. This is about as good as it gets!"
""
"D - A true benchmark for the style, much like Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is to the traditional Hefeweizen. A damn tasty beer that goes down so smooth; every beer in the style should be compared to this."
""
""
"Overall: Weihenstephaner might not make the ""strongest"" beer but drinking quite a few of their brews you don't need to be strong to be the best. This dunkel is almost borderline perfect, just by the first taste you will know one glass isn't enough...Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is a little humbling to critique a beer produced by a brewery that has been around longer than my entire family line. Weihenstephan has once again gone for balance over potency, restraining the banana/bubble-gum/clove notes you might expect to find in abundance; not to say this lacks flavor."

"500 ml bottle into signature weizen glass, bottled 2/2/2011. Pours super hazy red orange color with a beautiful 3 finger fairly dense off white head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some nice thick lacing clings to the glass; with a ton of carbonation streaming up as expected. Took me a while to pour this as I anticipated. Aromas of huge banana, clove, bubblegum, orange, wheat, bread, and yeast spices. Huge on the bubblegum here, amazing. Taste of orange, clove, bubblegum, bread, caramel, light banana, pepper, and yeast spices. Fairly dry on the finish; with some light lingering notes of citrus, clove, caramel, and biscuit on the finish for a short bit. Great overall balance of flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is pretty much invisible, and this drinks incredible smoothly. Overall this is a fantastic dunkelweizen, and my first one in the style. Nice amount of complexity; with very smooth drinking and a great mouthfeel. I will definitely have it again."

"Overall: This is my second re-review. I didn't get it the first time, not sure why, but now I prefer this to the original Hefeweissbier."
"A nice beer, another German style I enjoy. Definitely follows the style description of a darker Hefeweizen."
""
""
""
"Hazy dead brown color with a sparkling off white head. Lots of fresh cut apple on the nose with clove and raw dough. Moderate body with good crispness. Not explosive flavor wise in the least. Some roasted malt with clove and banana bread. Slightly stringy mouthfeel. Holds together really well but is a tad watery up front. Good and drinkable but nothing really wows me."
"Overall, the beer was just excellent. The flavors are very balanced and seem to complement one each other. If you like wheat beers/hefeweizens, dark beers, or both, this beer IS for you!"

"O- for some reason, I just feel like this is a lesser version of the Schneider Aventinus. Although it has great qualities, the taste is lacking. It is however, a good beer"
"O - I love this beer. One of the few that I cannot say enough good things about. I really enjoyed the Hefeweissen but the addition of dark malts in this edition make it something to be sought after. Given the fair price and year round circulation, this brew will be in my fridge on a regular basis."

"Single finger head with nice lacing on a murky brown with golden hues body. Rich dark fruit and molasses aroma with honey notes.

"Poured a murky milk chocolate brown (maybe drawn from the bottom of the keg?), with a thick frothy white head, leaving some sticky lace even on the plastic glass with some moderate retention. Nose has banana and light bubble gum as per the regular Weissbier, a bit of cocoa and caramel as well adding a touch of dunkel character. Taste has caramel, banana, bubble gum, light cocoa and some darker malt and bread notes, albeit subtle. Light chalkiness. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy (just as the original Weiss is), with some nice texture on the palate. Moderate to high carbonation. Certainly not my favourite style, but this is certainly a beer I could entertain more often if it was more available."
"Overall: A great Dunkel that is the standard of what the style should be."

"Overall, this was a terrific beer. It's just like the regular hefeweiss (which is a classic brew), but with a toffee-like hint to the flavor."
"Overall, one of the better dunkelweizens I've had. May prefer the hefeweizen over this, but still quite good."
"kept a good finger of head throught drinking and lots of lacing present at the finish"
"Pours out a cloudy, nutty brown with a creamy tanned head. Smells like banana nut bread with cloves. Little toastiness too. Tastes like banana nut bread too. Little bit of sweetness in the finish. Creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. As always, Weihenstephaner puts out another stellar beer."

"O-It's just good. I think I am underwhelmed slightly just because I expect alot better from them."
"Pours a muddy semi-transparent brown. Big frothy white head. Sampled directly after the Hefeweissbier. Both have big clove, banana and bubble gum aromas, though this one is a little more subdued. Light on carbonation, making subsequent sips oh so easy. I generally don't care for wheat beers, but I may have to revisit this one."
"The mouthfeel is perfect! Very elegant flavors and seems to have great balance with the flavors. The wheat still shines and the esters seem perfectly placed. This beer will leave you wanting more."

"O - A very enjoyable drinking beer that can be consumed at any time of the day. Highly recommended."
"Medium mouthfeel and high carbonation."
"O - Rather surprised by this beer and the lovely qualities. As it warms it becomes a bit too cloy though; the banana and clove becoming too much. Cooler though, closer to 40-45 its incredibly enjoyable. Definately would buy again."
"O= One tasty treat. Weihenstepan makes world class beers and this is no exception. Worth drinking all the time if you can find it. I wish these guys would make sixers or even twelve packs for me to always have on hand."
"Overall this is delicious. One of the best German beers I have ever had."

"I poured from a 500ml? bottle into a weizen glass. Deep caramel pour, big foamy head, no lacing. Big notes of bubblegum. cloves, and bannana. It taste like it smells, lingering bubble gum finish. The beer is light in body, high carbonation, very easy drinking. This one is a classic, great example of the style."
"So fresh off of a regular Weihenstephaner, this one pours a darker brownish opaque. More lacing on this one. Very clovey and banana bread smells. Taste is good, very fresh, but more toasty than the regular Hefeweisse. Unreal banana bread flavors coming through. Mouthfeel is medium. Great beer. I'd be pushed to say amazing."
"Drink: Outstanding and session-worthy. The lightness of the body makes this an easy drinker, while the different spices invite you to take sip after sip."
"There's a lot going on with this beer so it may not appeal to everyone. But it's a good representation of the type. They've been making beer for a billion years, so it's not surprising it's good."
"Poured a murky brownish-amber with a fluffy eggshell head that receded quite a bit but rejuvenated every time I poured more from the bottle. Aroma of sweet malts, banana esters, clove, and yeast. Taste of caramel, toasted pumpernickel, banana and cloves, spicy yeast, and a hint of honeydew. Medium-bodied, generously carbonated, and quite drinkable."
"pairing: cabbage based hearty meals, cream cheese"
"My overall feeling is that its good but lean and watery, just a tad though. I like the candied malt, it was dandy."
"MO- Smooth and creamy. Every wheat beer from these guys are very good, maybe even standard setting."
"Pours a dark copper to amber with lots of wheat haze and great lacing. Has a small ring of head that sticks around. The smell has a very nice clove and banana like the regular hefe, with other more Belgian spicy malt and yeast notes, bready and darker ripe fruit all of which translates to the taste. The taste has the elements of the smell but it seems muted in a way. It's great banana, ripe dark fruits, clove but it seems more watery to me. Nice carbonation accents the spice. Overall it's quite nice, but the regular hefe is just so divine it might almost be effecting my review. Definitely worth a try."
"O: a very good beer, very representative of its style. Highly recommended."
"O) very good beer all the way around n"
"O) This is a fantastic beer. I purchased it thinking it would be a good summertime selection. I could drink this beer anytime. I wish I bought more than just the one bottle. I'll be back for more."
"Pours a dark ruby/brownish hue with a tall 1"" off white head. Smells bright of typical banana and clove esters. Taste is spot on dunkelweizen, and the best version I have ever had. Crisp and clean without a strong aftertaste and easy drink ability of this beer makes it an excellent summertime treat."
"Soft and sweet, it is a very easy drinking beer. Not quite as good as their standard hefeweizen, this dunkel is still an outstanding beer. It would be phenomenal to be in Munich having a glass or two of this beer. If you see this brewery in your store, grab it!"
"The beer poured with a two-finger head and a cloudy, honey-brown complexion. The head retention was good seeing as the head lasted throughout. The aroma was pleasing, presenting with a light spiciness, fruity esters, a bread-like heartiness, and no noticeable hop presence. The taste bore a strong malt sweetness, light spiciness on the tongue, and cloves. The mouthfeel is pleasing with a light coating left on the tongue. Overall, this is a good beer, hearty and satisfying."
"O - an interesting meld of two German styles results if a very drinkable tasty brew, I'd like to see this style more often"
"Overall: I expected to enjoy this one more than I did. I'm going to have another to make sure I got an alright bottle. Not bad, just not amazing either."
"O - Overall this can't be missed. I like it just as much as it's brother, which is one of my favorites. This beer is essential. A great beer for a hot OR cold day, as the robustness it brings makes it a nice winter beer, while the refreshing crispness invites summer connections. A perfect year-round beer, and ideal for any occasion."
"O - A perfect representation of this type of beer. I would highly recommend this beer."
"O- My first dunkelweizen. I'm a big fan of the popular Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. This variation is quite good, and I would have it again."
"A nice, complex wheat beer."
"Excellent beer start to finish."
"This was one of my first overpours in a long time, just broaching the lip of the glass. Once it finished playing around, it settled into a finger of light-tan head with mild retention. Color was a very cloudy orangish-brown (or was it a brownish-orange?). Nose was very clove/spice-forward, underlain by banana esters. I am finding that the bubble gum scent fades when overpowered by clove. Yay! Mouthfeel was full, approaching creamy, with lots of spicy clove flavors up front with the banana taking a backseat. Now, here is another beer that I can solidly endorse! Finish continued to be extremely spicy and I could hardly get enough. I must mark this one down for future reference."
"D: I've had little experience with Dunkelweizen, but would still venture to say this ranks amongst the best examples of the style. I don't find it sessionable, but it's a rich, delicious beer all the same with a spicy, banana bread character. A real stand-out."
"The taste just isn't there relative to what I want it to be. The initial bursts of flavor similar to the nose aren't there and it comes across as watery. The finish has a decent caramelly lingering ring and it's really quaffable, but the taste I wanted just isn't there. Kind of a disappointment."
"O - Pretty cool that this is the oldest brewery in the world dating back to 1040. The quality is definitely there. Not too heavy. Wouldn't turn it down."
"Overall, it was a tasty beer. Nice and refreshing, but a little too carbonated for me. Would definitely drink again though."
"O - A superb wheat beer, not terribly dark but a nice bundle of flavor on the palate. Try this if you love wheat beer.."
"Pours a murky light copper hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head and heaps of lacing,the smell is bananna,dark fruits and caramel malts,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and feels velevty smooth and the taste is basically the same as on the nose with hints of bananna,caramel,dark plums,chocolate wheat and the finish is dry and very moreish and overall a very tasty drop and how could you can you complain from the worlds oldest brewery cheers."
"O: Pretty tasty, like how the dark malt bill adds some complexity, the combination of banana bread and dark fruit was really good."
"Despite the age of this beer, I can't help but be amazed that it's still so good! I can't wait to see how a fresher bottle tastes!"
"This is a really nice beer good farm both warm and cold weather and large glasses to be quaffed heavily. Some smoked salmon on rye would be a pretty tasty lunch with this one. Pumpkin pie oddly enough comes to mind. I think it is the spices and other fall flavors that will harmonize well. Of course, this is a German beer so don’t forget the sausages!"
"O: Being my first Dunkel, I don't have a base to go on except that Weihenstephaner's Hefe is exceptional. This is a very good beer. The caramel malts are a nice deviation from a typical Hefe."
"Overall: The best of the 3 Weihenstephaners I've had."
"O - Delicious as expected from a Weihenstephaner. Refreshing and delicious"
"Overall, really nice and quite a surprise. A nice switch-up from the hefeweizen, which I find makes a great beer for the summer."
"Overall, a shining example of the style. Well worth trying."
"O: Super nice Dunkel. 4.5"
"Overall: this was a great beer despite my traditional dislike of hefe's."
"O- Great beer. Bravo! very enjoyable."
"O - A very good beer, especially given the price-to-quality ratio. Definitely something I'd like to have in reserve to share with friends."
"A very good brew overall, one which I would definitely buy again. My favourite Weihenstephaner."
"O- A great beer. I love the amount you receive for the price. This is really how beer should be made."
"O - this is my second german dark wheat in a week and neither has disappointed - this beer is very sessionable and I will be going back for more when I pass by the Preston LCBO again - i could enjoy a few on a hot afternoon at the trailer this summer"
"now that i have access to these beers, i'm going to have strike a deal to stock up for summer. fantastic stuff!"
"Cloudy, murky mud water brown with an off white thick fluffy head that leaves beautiful lace. The smell is wonderful but subdued. Bananas, faint clove, sweet caramel. The front of the taste is caramel and toffee with banana following. The banana and clove are subtle. Its nice and easy to drink. Crisp, and refreshing with a sweet edge."
"O- A very solid brew that I can see myself purchasing regularly."
"O (D) - I don't particularly like or know this style, but it's a pretty good beer. I would seek it out in Germany, but not in the States."
"O: This is an incredibly drinkable beer. It's not particularly complex, but it's still quite satisfying to drink. I want another."
"Overall - dominant! this is a classic beer that has so much to offer, one i will stock forever!"
"I give two Schlitz for Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel/Dark. Prosit!"
"Overall, alright I could have this beer in a pinch. It's probably not a fav style of mine, but if there was nothing else left I'd take it."
"Overall this is an outstanding beer, I would consider a as great example of its style."
"Overall its a good example of a dunkel weissen. Smooth flavors, nothing too odd."
"O: I see this brew sitting in the holster of a pool float, with me on it in my future..."
"O - Very sessionable beer with heaps on offer"
"D: Such a refreshing beer; I could drink this all day--especially on a hot summer's day; another stellar beer from the world's oldest brewery"
"O: A classic rendition of the style with all of the nutty, banana bread notes and smooth, easy-to-drink feel."
"Man, Weihenstephaner nails wheats. Flavorful without being too strong, well balanced, very drinkable. I'd go for it again without question."
"D- 4.5 Given the right time and place, I could drink this all night long. It has a great balance of tasty flavors and goes down easily. It really isn't heavy, either. Granted I wasn't as blown away by this as I was by the brewery's regular hefeweizen, but that's probably because the bar had been set so high! I'll definitely buy again and recommend."
"Overall - First dunkelweizen I've had and I must say I like it, go find it if you can and give it a go with the hot weather coming."
"Notes: very good beer. If you can get it then please don't hesitate!"
"Highly drinkable and plenty refreshing. Overall, one of the best dunkleweizens available."
"D Good beer, good dunkel weiss, worthy of another round."
"bier. This is my favorite so far from Weihenstephaner and in my top 3 Beers overall. I have only tried 3 of they're beers so far, [Hefe-Weizen, Hefe-Weizen Dunkel, and they're Original Premium.] This Beer is simply amazing, it renders me speechless. If you are a true Hefe-Weizen fan, you CANNOT go through life without trying this. Awesome Beer."
" As the other Weihenstephaner styles are also exceptionally tasty (kristal and wheat), I recommend having one of each if you're having this for the 1st time. Having more than 3 of the dunkels starts to put you into that morphine-like stupor though, so I would recommend switching to another style at that point as far as drinkability goes."
"A nicely balanced dark wheat beer, in the end - there's something to be said for Old World subtlety, when it deems to come along. However, that banana/yeast thing does grow a bit stale sooner, rather than later, so I can't really imagine having more than one serving of this at a time."
"O - Overall a very tasty dunkelweizen and a top notch sample of the style. The flavours are complex but not overwhelming, making it easily sessionable. Would be quite refreshing on a hot summer day and I will certainly be picking this one up again!"
"O: An easy drinker to be sure, even if I'm not enjoying this one quite as much as I thought I would after the hefeweizen. Still, a good beer and worth a try- maybe it will be even more to your taste than the ordinary one."
"A slight bit heavy on the carbonation, but a nice wheat beer and drinkable if a bit heavy."
"D- I wish I could try everything these guys had to offer, just a fantastic Dunkelweizen."
"Food match: Same as the Hefeweissbier... nuff said."
"The complex flavors make this an excellent dinner beer, and paired with the perfect course, I'd say this is a good beer. I wouldn't stick with it all night."
"A pleasure to drink."
"D: The bready bitterness and clove spice hold this back a little but it is still terrific."
"Comes across a bit mild and watery to me, perhaps it's bolder on its local turf, but this imported bottle version leaves me wanting."
"Very drinkable. Recommended."
"Notes: Outstanding!!! This beer is a work of wheat beer art."
"Drinkability - Would rather have the regular Hefeweissbier, as it doesn't offer as much complexity."
"Overall, it is clear why this is a top German beer. Good contrast to the hefeweizen. I'm going to be looking for more dunkelweizens, as I find the style very interesting."
"16.9oz brown bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a murky brown-red body with over an inch of khaki-colored head. Smells fruity, with ripe banana, date and nut. Tastes like banana, nut, spice, caramel, toffee, with chocolate and coffee notes in the background. Ample carbonation compliments a medium to full body to make this a super-drinkable super-complex beer. I'm beyond impressed."
"Very smooth and balanced. Very drinkable. Top quality."
"Refreshing. Very enjoyable beer all-around."
"DB- Certainly a version of their classic beer with just a bit of darkness, in the way of malt and fruit. I just love the Weihenstephaner yeast profile. This beer could use a bit more body and maybe a bit less sweetness."
"Pours a cloudy brown with a three-finger off white head. Great lacing and retention throughout. Aroma of Belgian yeast, bread and sweet malt. Big yeasty and bready flavor up front. Nice Belgian yeast flavor, a bit of banana, clove and spice before a bready sweet malt. Some dark fruits as well. Nice sweetness throughout."
"Drinkability: It was hard to say no to a second one. Definitely will have the scond one next time. Superb glass of beer."
"Drinkability: Not as nice as the Hefeweizen by this brewer but a great beer nonetheless. A great style representative. I guess I just prefer the Hefe."
"D - I picked the right Dunkelweizen for my first. This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again."
"Really just nitpicking here. Bias derived from my taste for fuller-bodied (Amer.) ales? Yeah, take only a small fraction of a volume off the carbonation and I'd dub this perfect. I think I'll achieve nirvana with this from draft, we'll see."
"D - Yes, more."
"D - Very drinkable. Could drink a couple bottles."
"D - I could have this anytime of year, though I prefer it during the colder months. Easily my favorite dunkel, which should be no surprise considering its ranks among the style."
"Drinkability: Very good...really can't go wrong with this company."
"D: easier to down than your normal dunkelweiss, quite refreshing, wish I had another. A profoundly enjoyable brew."
"Very Good drink for a 'hefe',wish she came in 6ers!"
"Carbonation is intense at first but softens quickly. Creaminess again is awesome, reminds me of a milkshake somehow. Fantastic beer, arguably better than the regular hefeweissbier they make."
"Traded some esters for some warmer flavors."
"D)Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is one of my favorite beers and the dunkel is expceptional. Everytime I make a trip to the distributor, I always pick up atleast 4-5 bottles of the Dunkel and Korbinian."
"D - This is a very enjoyable beer with well-balanced flavours with a well-measured mildness that gives you no choice but to drink more. Is there nothing that Weihenstephaner can do wrong?"
"Well constructed and a reasonable gravity to accompany a rich, meat and potatoes dinner."
"Drinkability-WOW! Awesome!"
"A good dark Hefe. Nicely flavored, nothing overdone. Generous carbonation and flavors make this a solid brew."
"Drinkability: This is a wonderful beer that makes you want more."
"Never have had this dunkel so I scooped it up for the pleasure. Pours dark amber/light brown very cloudy with a huge airy white head. Not quite as dark as I was hoping for. Big banana esters, slight clove, a toastiness of malt and some wheat. The taste is very pleasant, a bit much on the banana but the feel is light and fun, with a bunch of stuff going on from the yeast and grains. Tastes like a decoction with either or munich malt in addition to the wheat, I can't point it exactly, finishes easy. An excellent drink, one I will certainly go back to in the future."
"D: This beer is highly drinkable. A nice flavor."
"The only fault I can find with this beer is the dryness that it leaves in the mouth. Otherwise, it is an excellent beer."
"Another superb offering from the world's oldest brewery. They obviously know what they're doing."
"D: Very nice. A beer that tastes effortless, but I am sure it is anything but. A great beer to spend a day drinking."
"D - when I get the chance I'm buying a month's worth of this stuff. Merry Christmas to me!"
"I know it is a dunkelweizen, but I really struggle to separate the flavor profile of this from the regular version. Maybe it's just me. However, it is one dang tasty beer. There are few beers that are going to go down easier than this. It's great just holding it in the mouth and savoring it."
"I tried this out of curiosity, but would never buy it again."
"d - A very good beer hurt by it's high carbonation. This was probably the best tasting dunkelweizen I've had and it looked great as well. Would certainly have again but I think if it was less carbonated it could be even better."
"D - This is one very delicious dunkel. I'd love to find this on tap someday, or pair it with some grilled brats and sauerkraut. Has all the exceptional quality of its regular brother with a bit more character. I could easily drink several of these and still wish for just one more. Simply outstanding."
"Overall- Solid beer, but had this back to back with Ayinger's Dunkeweizen and I thought that one was slightly better."
"D: the glass begs to be picked back up constantly."
"D - If I had an endless supply of this I wouldn't have a job because I would be too drunk due to constantly drinking this. I don't know if I could drink this on a 100 degree day but any other time I would. Whenever I see this on a shelf at a store, i'll be picking it up and I suggest you do the same. Outstanding, a little over a pint bottle was gone before I even had time to finish all of my notes for this review."
"Drinkability: This beer was half gone before I even knew it. Goes down so easy and is such a delight to drink. I won't go as far as to say that I like it better than the Hefeweissbier, but I would not be disappointed if this was all I had on me."
"Conclusion: A triumph. There is little doubt that Weihenstephaner has mastered the art of the classic styles of German wheat beers. I love this style of beer and I can find no major faults with this example of the style. Drink it."
"D: Easy drinking, very clean, good beer and well put together."
" This brewery has to be the finest in the world, i know its the oldest, since 1050."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, nice depth of flavor helps make this a great session beer."
"After I had tried Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier figured I had to try this. I was in Germany a few years ago and it was then that I decided this was one of my favorite styles. This beer pours a little lighter than I expected it was a cloudy auburn color with a wonderfully tall off-white head. The smell was of clove and wheat. When I went for my first taste I initially got a little bit of foam on my nose (definitely a good sign, great head retention) the taste was similar to the smell but also brought out a nuttiness or a dark fruitiness of some sort, there is also just a slight bit of a roasted flavor to this. The beer is medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, this is a wonderful beer, the perfect embodiment of the style."
"Although this was an old bottle, it really held up great. This is easily my favorite wheat beer. I can't wait to find a fresh bottle of this stuff."
"The $2.40 I paid for this 1 pt+ bottle is money well spent. Next time, I'm buying all of them from the shelf."
"D: Very high. Low ABV and wonderful taste make me wish I had more than one."
"M/D - Thinner body than I was expecting but great carbonation for the style. Nice flavor profile and yeast flavors makes it real easy to drink, and searching for other flavors. Finishes with a nice malty sugar sweetness."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall and a near-perfect example of a dunkelweizen. I would highly recommend this beer."
"(D)- A good Dunkel. Not quite up to par with their superb Hefe, but its a good one when looking for something in the style."
"D - One is enough. After reading reviews, I wonder how fresh my sample is, because it sounds far better by other palates."
"I picked this up in a 500ml bottle and poured it into a wheat glass. It poured out with a deep woody mahogany color with plenty of excited bubble racing to the top forming a dull brown-white head that lingers throughout. I smell fruity esters that i can't put a finger on and banana. Later in the sniff i pick up bread, yeast, and grain, a fine bouquet. Very bready, banana, apricot, and a hint of cherry. Nice mild hop drying effect that balances off the malts. The mouthfeel is wet up front drying in the back and medium overall. Carbonation is prickly and burpy. This beer goes down like nectar with a wanting for more. I can see myself in a bar in Germany drinking the day away with this beer. Outstanding beer, one of the best in its style hands down."
"Age has not affected this beer. It is the king of beers for this style and I will re-visit it soon."
"The most flavorful beer I've ever had under 6% and not a sour."
"But maybe only one."
"I've had this beer in the past and remember liking it, now I finally got a chance to review it. The appearance is of a cloudy dirty brown color that is to be associated with the dunkelweizen. This was also given to me with two fingers of very pillowy head. The smell is of the traditional belgian yeasts which include the heavy smells of banana and clove. In addition there were aromas of orange zest and the overall bready malt aroma. The taste was strongly of the banana, clove and citrus most closely associated with orange. There were also hints of rock candy and brown sugar. The mouthfeel was creamy and delicious as only a good weiss bier should be. This was quite drinkable and very pleasant. I recommend having this if given the opportunity."
"D: This is a very nice Dunkel. The complexity of flavor and low ABV make it an easy drinker."
"Overall I am very pleased with this beer, I was not a big fan of their lighter hefe but I'm very impressed with this beer. A delicious, supremely drinkable dunkelweizen. Highly recommended, especially for the low low price tag."
"I have been on a US beer kick for the last few years, but this may have launched me back over the pond and away from IPAs. I will def be picking more of this up."
"d - very drinkable. very very drinkable. I'd buy a 6 pack in a heartbeat."
"Notes: I am on a dunkelweizen push right now. Aventinus on tap was probably my favorite because of its darker fruit tones. The Moosbacker was also a favorite because it shared the dark fruit character. As far as hitting the mark for a catagory, this beer (and brewery) does it very well."
"This disappeared before I knew what happened to it. So drinkable. A wonderful beer."
"Pours a burnt orange with a head that looks like a dollup of vanilla ice cream. Just looks fantastic. Zesty banana bread on the smell. Citrus, spices, banana, yeast and wheat bread with a hint of roastiness towards the end. Creamy mouthfeel mmm this is a good beer. A great dunkelweizen from an exceptional German brewery, one of the best."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer has an awesome soft mouthfeel. The carbonation is very fine and makes the beer refreshing. It's an incredibly drinkable beer that I am very impressed with."
" very enjoyable dunkle with some aspects I don't really love like the root beer flavor and slight metallic edge, otherwise a really good brew."
"D- u can session plenty of this"
"An excellent example of the style, this beer has plenty of conventional flavor and aroma character. Although the beer is on the lighter side, the flavors are not."
"As one would say, dont judge a book buy its cover ."
"Served: September 4, 2010"
"This reminds me of that movie beerfest when the guys brew the secret recipe and take one sip and start crying. The discussion of wanting to put one's dick in it and vice versa is fully realized after the first sip. Clean, flavorful, malty with traces of banana and vanilla, this beer has it all. The first time I tried this was at Schnitzleplatz in Addison, il. I drank a 2 litre ""das boot"" of it and every drop went down smooth. Those bavarians know their beer, but what else can be expected from the worlds oldest brewery?"
"Drink - I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers, but this is the best one that I have had so far."
"This is one of my new all-time favorites. Drink up!"
"mouthfeel/drinkability: typical wheat beer.. easy going down.. be careful, however, they almost go down too easily.. nice body, refreshing."
"D= for me it's probably limited to 1-2 22-ounce bottles, nice, somewhat muddy and less defined than I would prefer though, the excitement wears off after a few. Might go nicely with a grilled steak or with a pasta dish or a pork with gravy dish."
"Fabulously drinkable. I'm ashamed that I only picked up one, as I forgot how good these are."
"A very tasty beer, One that I could drink all night. This is a style that is underrepresented at my local beer buying venues, so I think I'll be buying this again."
"This beer was okay, but not outstanding. I would not mind drinking this again as it is worth revisiting. I thought it was a step up from Julius Echter Hefe-Weissbier Dunkel."
"A light brown colored brew with a good frothy head and nice carbonation. Mild aroma. Flavor and mouthfeel is light to medium with sweet roasty malts. Not as spiced or banana as other German Dunkelweizens. A good drinking brew, but perhaps a bit over-rated in my opinion."
"this beer is very light and nuanced, different from what I expect from the style. interesting take, not a bad beer at all."
"a very delicate ordeal. this is a excellent be with a lot of subtleties. the pour is a murky thin brownish color... with a nose that has the quality so several dukelweizen at once. this is sour apple, floral, smoke, and wheat. the palate expands to something mildly sweet in the face of other dunkel hefs... with a very mild molasses sweet and a wheat grit dry feeling of clove. lots of apple and a volume that doesn't hang around on the tongue for long because of the crispness and mild floral soapiness. great mix of flavors and qualities. a must for fans."
"I am open to suggestions on this."
"Drinkablility: I'm sure the what lovers find it great but I just can't go over 3.5 (and for me that is generous.)"
"D...I can drink this any time, any place and it brings me right back to the place that I first had it in a pizza house in Germany, excellent drinkability."
"D: Weihenstephaner is another brewery that doesn't seem to make a bad beer. A solid dunkel that I would pick up again."
"Gorgeous color and a whipped cream cap. Really pleasing aroma, low on banana and high on a sharp sour fruit flavor. Flavor is awesome! This is my kind of dunkel. Good soft wheat and a sharp cut of sour fruit. High level of carbonation feels nice and the body feels light and airy. This is really good beer! Hint of berry and slight mineral. Love it!"
"I overlooked this beer for my whole drinking career, and by doing so have neglected a truly exceptional beer."
"Out of a bomber this beer was a cloudy copper color with lots of rising carbonation. The one finger of light khaki colored head displayed very good retention and left lacing in bands. The aroma was of caramel malt, butterscotch, candi sugar and some hints of dark fruits. The flavors were just like the aroma with a pleasant sweetness from the malts balanced by a good note of spicy, hoppy bitterness that seemed to blossom as the beer warmed up. I also tasted cloves, lots of wheat and some banana notes from the yeast. Complex and enjoyable. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium but the carbonation just a touch too high for my liking."
"drinkability - very flavorful, palatable, easy drinking"
"Draft at Gourmet Haus Staudt. Turbid brownish-amber with a huge frothy cap. Cocoa, caramelized banana and clove aroma, a bit like fried and spiced bananas. Light on the tongue but very flavorful, reminiscent of chocolate covered bananas and Grandma's spice rack. This is on the dry side, though the flavors suggest dessert; ultimately this is to the beer's benefit, it never becomes cloying. Spicy, peppery finish with lingering clove. A stellar example of the style."
"One of the best Dunkel weizen I ever had"
"Reviewed from my notes. The beer is a muddy brown liquid. It has a thin, off-white foam head. The beer is opaque, but I can still see some carbonation bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass and rising within. There are a number of aromas coming from this beer; I can smell clove, banana, and a slight sweetness reminiscent of brown sugar. It tastes of musty yeast, like a weissebier should. There is lots of banana and some clove in the flavor. The finish has a bit of peppery spice to it. The beer has a medium body and high carbonation. The coating is very good and it contains some sweetness. The pepper in the finish provides a bit of a bite, but otherwise it finishes cleanly. It is a very drinkable beer. I could easily have a few of these. It is a perfect beverage for the outdoor deck here at my favorite bier garden."
"I tried this beer on November 5, 2009 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a dark brown colour with golden highlights and 1"" head that lasted. The aroma was wheat malt, cloves, and some yeast. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and medium carbonation. The flavour was wheat malt, cloves, some ginger-like flavours and a bitter finish."
"My overall impression is that this beer is light and refreshing and everything a good dunkelweizen should be. This will definately find its way into my normal rotation."
" Nice little hefeweizen with added roast and dark toffee tones, I think I like this better than their helles hefe."
"D: Another great Beer from Weihenstephanen.... Low ABV and very drinkable. I could do another one of these with no problem."
"M/D - Average body, great drinkability. I could easily drink a couple of these on a cool summer evening and it wouldn't kill the wallet, decent price near me for the quality."
"D: I'm very impressed with this beer. A delicious, supremely drinkable dunkelweizen that should have near-universal appeal. In many ways, this drinks like a cross between a dubbel and a hefeweizen, and in this case the result is excellent. Highly recommended."
"D: So good and refreshing. This is light but with a rich taste. I could drink many of these at any time of year. Overall a great beer."
"D: Filling, tasty and easy to drink. I would easily be able to sit down with some friends in a Gasthaus and order a few with some good sausages or schnitzel."
"Nice beer, and I'm not normally a big fan of wheats at all (will need to revisit this one)."
"Pours a three-finger white head that vanishes quickly leaving no lace. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Hazy light amber color, no yeast settling out. Nose is mostly yeast and some malt. Flavor is dominated by the yeast, some wheat, sweet yeasty finish. Not nearly as good as when I had it 7 years ago. $3.25 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Drinkability: Could drink this all day long on a hot, summer day."
"If there is a perfect beer, this is it! From first opening the bottle through the pour and right to the finish this beer is superb!"
"D- this is a exelent choise for a session beer, i could drink 4 of this one with no problem, the best dunkel weissen that i have tried"
"If you like Dark hefeweissbeirs this is an excellent choice. I will never turn one of these down"
"a prime candidate for a session beer. seems to fit the style well and while it's pretty good, it didn't blow me away. i probably wouldn't buy this again, but i'd recommend it to someone looking for a good wheat beer."
"O: Just not as much flavor as the blond. A nice beer, but I'll stick to the blond for hefeweiss."
"Notes - Creamy mouthfeel and a beer I could drink a lot of."
"D: Just a great beer. I believe I like this quite a bit more then the Hefe, actually."
"Nuanced flavor, but better for it. Understated malts, so missing a lot of the fruit note signposting of a weizen. Bizarrely, I keep thinking of the yeast action that Orval brings. I guess that's a compliment!"
"Ah a good old German brew, let's give it a whirl. Popping the tp the smell reminds me of the old Hungry Sailor in the Grove, beer and cloves. Smell also has hints of banana, spot on for a dunkelweizen. Pouring into a pils glass yields a cloudy light brown with a big two finger off white head made up of multi sized bubbles. Taste is more banana, almost banana flambe: banana, sweetness and alcohol. The only bitterness there is is right at the end of the taste. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation brings out the flavor. Overall a great example of the style, but much too sweet for my tastes, thus a lower drinkability rating."
"D-this has a good taste but it is a little thin and watered down. Good flavors for the dunkelweizen and very easy to drink."
"Very easy drinkable. Mouthfeel is well balanced between refreshing and dry. Clean and complete."
"Drinkability - I thought this beer was going to be more roasted and banana bread-like, making this beer a more suitable alternative to the hefeweizens's during the winter time. However, this was not the case as the extremely potent apple flavors made this beer more like an apple juice brew than anything else. Contrary to my predispositions, this would make a lovely summer beer, especially for those times when you feel like a kid and need your sippy cup of apple juice."
"The palate opens light and airy with the clove-like spice quite dominant with some banana too. Not as balanced as the nose, this still tastes excellent. A definite cocoa presence is noted, and there's a touch of caramel, and a moderate toasted whole wheat bread character. Medium in body with high carbonation, this beer dries on the finish, leaving a strong clove character along with some banana. Thoroughly enjoyable, I wouldn't pick this over their regular hefeweissbier, but that's hardly a surprise."
"D: The beer goes down smooth and is quite thirst quenching."
"It's not as delightfully quaffable as its traditional wheat siblings, but makes up for it with loads more complexity!"
"Drinkability: Great smell and mouthfeel, but the taste doesnt quite match. I'd be happy to drink it again though."
"D - Great drinkability. I think I like the regular Hefeweissbier better, but this is still a great brew."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer. I could certainly get this again and drink it many times. It could be a very good session beer as well."
"A really good classic beer from Germany. A really drinkable beer but it doesnt make me crave it as much as the normal Hefe."
"D - Extremely drinkable, I could down 3 or more pints of this delicious brew. You got to like the clove/spice flavors to enjoy this beer because it has allot of it, but I would definitely buy this one again, and I'm excited to try this breweries other beers. Very refreshing on a warm day. Cheers!"
"Notes: Really nice beer. Good mix of classical Hefewizen flavors and sweet dark flavors. I'll mention it for one more time, really reminiscent of a banana bread french toast. A touch sweet but a really enjoyable beer. I'm not sure if it is better than the original Hefewizen, rather it is just a different beer that I would crave at a different time for different reasons."
"Pours a very cloudy dark brown color body, big foamy off-white head, somewhat lasting, decent lacing. Very fruity aroma, lots of banana and fruit like strawberries. Dry somewhat spicy too, maybe clove. Not overpowering. Nice thick mouthfeel, almost like drinking thick syrup. Very thick, some flavor, but not very much. Almost a chemical taste to it, plastic or something. Warming up a bit more, more dark fruit like grape, raisin. Not very complex a flavor, light. Better as it warms."
"D – Anyone who doesn't get their regular fix of Weihenstephaner brews is: A) nuts, B) missing out on great beer, C) getting sheisted (there is no greater value than Weihenstephaner)."
"Slightly sweet, toasty caramel bounces in and out of the flavor into the finish and fade. Soft with subtle spice character to compliment the malt. Fantastic!"
"Mouthfeel is medium with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"This might be the best Dunkelweizen I've tried to date!"
"Yellow-brown with a creamy, foamy head that recedes to 1cm. Aroma powerful cloves and a hint of banana. Lovely wheat sharpness carries throughtout, clove-heavy spiciness, and a touch more maltiness than the regular Hefeweizen. Fantastic classic dunkelweizen."
"Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier Dunkel is a delicious Dunkel Weizen. This Dunkel is another stellar brew from the world's oldest brewer."
"Notes: A very nice dark wheat brew, that is one of the best from the typical German offerings for this style."
"Drinkability: Very good for the style. Love the mix of caramel and wheat. Not the most complex beer I have had, but a really good one. I could have several of these."
"D: Easy to drink, but I'm not a fan of the style. None the less, it's a good price for what it delivers. One to try out for sure."
"great stuff. definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability: Being a dunkelweissen, this one has a little more substance than hefeweissens. I like it better for cold weather than the hefes. As tasty a beer as I have ever quaffed."
"D: A wonderful brew, and definitely something I'll pick up more often if I see it."
"Bottle from LCBO. Brown pour with generous white head. Roasted wheat and clove aroma, bananas. Wheaty flavor, quite acetic with some cloves. Good palate, I had low expectations for this beer but it's on equilibrium and quite enjoyable. Highly drinkable."
"D: It's crazy that a beer this good is also such an incredibly cheap buy. If you only have a $10 bill in your wallet, pick up three of these and call it a night."
"Yup, another incredible beer from Weihenstephan, who make many of my favorite beers. Goes down easy and is so well balanced. Just about flawless."
"It must be noted I was given this as a gift. The best before date was approximately 6 months away but my experience with the style is freshest is best and seeing as it was part of a gift pack I wonder if I would enjoy this more if I drank one closer to bottling."
"A stellar Dunkelweizen. I will be seeking this out in the future, its tremendously drinkable with enough layers of complexity to be a truly contemplative brew."
"D- A very enjoyable, rich beer that is a bit on the heavy side for a beer at this ABV. Still, this is one of the best German beers I have ever had."
"If you have not tried this beer before you really owe it to yourself to relax and enjoy a glass."
"this is one of the better beers I've had in recent memory with little doubt. a big thank you adil for this gem, I only wish this was available where I live it would be in my regular rotation all year round. this is a must try for any beer lover and for the style it's awesome, you could spend a lot of time and money searching for a better one and may not find it"
"D: As before, very crisp, would definitely have another. Perhaps two or three."
"This is probably my least favorite style of beers, which is why it's the 90th style I've reviewed so far. I don't buy these often because I just don't like them, but I do like Weihenstephaner and hope they don't let me down with my least favorite style. Pours a hazy russet brown color with a large white head and decent lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Aroma of wheat, light banana, and slightly flowery. Taste is wheaty, a strange minty flavor at first, gives way to some sugary sweetness, and another odd anise flavor on the finish. Yeasty. Medium body, carbonation is good and tingly. I still don't get this style. I think this would be a top notch brew if this your thing, but it's certainly not mine."
"Served in a Weihenstephaner weiss glass at Stuff Yer Face in New Brunswick, NJ. First I loved the glass and need to track one down. Very cloudy malt brown color with a decent head and nice lacing. Great wheat/bready aroma. I love this taste. Malty and wheat. Sweet but not overly so. Very refreshing but filling too. This is what all other dunkles should be judged by."
"This is a very nice one and a great example of what a dunkelweizen is...essentially, a dark, maltier hefe."
"O: A truly world-class beer. My favorite wheat, favorite of the style, and one of my favorite beers of all time."
"Overall an enjoyable quaff."
"Generous foamy beige head poured carefully into its own glass. This dunkel is medium brown, transluscent with lots of miniscule bubble streams drifting upwards. Very good retention, creamy sheets of lace and lots of staying power carbonation-wise. The aroma of a wheat beer upfront, lightly spiced, banana and vanilla- fudge nose. Taste has a mild hop presence, a touch fruity but with nice balance. There are hints of allspice, clove, molasses. Smooth and creamy texture in the mouth, nice and even. The aftertaste is a bit earthy and detracts marginally from an otherwise exemplary beer experience."
"Clearly a thousand years of brewing has perfected the strength, flavour and mouthfeel because this just goes down in gulps. Bravo!"
"Overall, an excellent beer and one I'm more than glad I picked up while the LCBO had it in supply. This beer marks the first A+ that I've given a beer while on this site (not that it means much), but it says something to me. The addition of toasted malt to the flavours of an excellent hefe really made this beer stand out. This one leaves me looking forward to trying their original hefeweizen. Fingers crossed that it will come around here soon. Highly, highly recommended."
"nicely balanced beer that is drinkable, with a head that lasted till the last sip, it went well with pan seared yellowfin tuna."
"Can't wait to have another."
"Extremely drinkable for a meal of a beer."
"Drinkability - A very easy-drinking beer with a nice balance of flavor, body, and carbonation. I could easily drink this for a long, long time."
"It's very drinkable but not all that interesting. I could drink a couple of these but won't be actively seeking it out in the future. I expected a bit more of a complex taste."
"Final Thoughts: This beer deserves to be at the top of the dark wheat beer pile and I think with a bit more roasting of the malt and some minor tweaks it would be perfect. Excellent desert beer, or perfect with sweet foods. I cannot recommend it enough, if you are reading this, go buy a bottle right now."
"D: Easy drinker again. I could have more than one. Very well balance and nothing throws you off. A nice beer."
"Pours a murky caramel color with a voluminous fluffy off-white head. Aroma is bread crusts, bananas, vanilla, and clove. Flavor is similar, bready with a strong banana note and just enough clove. Mouthfeel is silky and smooth. Another well-crafted Weihenstephaner beer."
"D: Highly, highly drinkable. A great session beer. Would love to have this fresh from the brewery. Excellent example of style."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of banana bread with some spices. Taste is also of banana bread with some cloves and spices, quite tasty. Feels creamy in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine brew."
"This beer is slightly heavier in my opinion than the hefeweizen. Still a stand up beer. More sweetness, beer is still wet and not dry at all. Finishes nicely, not as high drinkability as the hefe but still a stand up beer. Mouthfeel is heavier than I would like but that's why its a dunkel."
"The pour is a darker amber but also rather cloudy with about an inch of puffy beige head that settles down after a few moments. My first sensation on the nose is of cloves, coriander, and malts with fresher Euro-hops pulling up the rear. The mouthfeel is bold and creamy. Cloves, wheat and something akin to Allspice mingle together in the taste. This is not bitter at all. It is very mild and mellow. I found this to be an enjoyable, likeable, generally easy to handle dark beer."
"From a technical perspective, this is a solid dunkelweizen, as the appearance and mouthfeel are world class. But the aromas and flavours leave much to be desired. With a bit more boldness in those areas, this would be a kick-ass brew."
"Cloudy brown with a huge, creamy head of tan foam. Excellent lacing. Big wheaty-banana-earthy aroma with some light clove. Smooth as silk body. Not an overly dark, roasty flavour - maybe a hint - but mostly a banana/clove wheatiness with a hint of anise. Light fruitiness and a mild bitterness round out the flavours. Very nice."
"A great wheat beer from Wehenstephaner? Shocking, I know."
"Dunkelweiss is a style I haven't been able to come across for a while, and I'm glad to find it again! Another great one from Weihenstephan!"
"500 ml bottle from the LCBO- Decants a murky brown with orange hues as it is held up to the light. In the aroma, there is soft fruit, banana, some spice, clove, some dark fruit. Tastes of sweet banana and clove, dark fruit and a bit roasty/nutty with some yeast towards the end. Very creamy and fulfilling finish. I like this quite a bit."
"D - I was so sad when this beer was gone. Here's one I could drink all night and everyday."
"D: I thought this brew to be immensely drinkable."
"Nice smooth, not too carbonated mouthfeel and pretty drinkable. This is more of a summer beer to me, not as good as their regular weiss, but still exceptional."
"Not as tasty or put together as some other dunkels I've had, more weiss as well. Light and drinkable though despite it."
"Um....I feel like I should have more to say about this beer...but that's all I got. And yeah. It's beyond excellent. What more is there to say?"
"This beer is something special. I've had enough dunkelweizens by now to know that a lot of them overplay their spices and underplay their potential for a textured body. This one hits them both just right. It pours a muddy looking brown with a nice head. Rich aromas of wheat and toastiness with cloves and spices that don't overdo it. The flavors are rich and complex, with a very full-feeling texture that gives me the impression of a much-chewed wheat bread in a glass. Absolutely delicious in every respect."
"Overall I'm a little let down, while it is a very refreshing wheat beer I didn't really get the hit of toasty darker malts I was looking for. Maybe I'll give it another shot but right now this dark Deutschlander will be on the backburner as far as wheat beers go."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Nice subtle carbonation. It's a very hearty and refreshing beer."
"Nor anything that makes it a worthwhile pickup when this same brewery offers a world-class weissbier, dopplebock and weizenbock. It's good but warranting a repeat purchase is hard to justify when the mighty Weihenstephaner Vitus, the flavour-packed Korbinian and the endlessly drinkable Weihenstephaner Weissbier are out there."
"Weihenstephaner know how to make a damn decent beer, and this dunkelweizen is no exception."
"D: Highly drinkable and an impressive session beer. Full flavored but a little watery at the end."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange-brown with a nice tight white head that fades to a ring. Light aromas of banana and bread. The taste is fuller and richer with lots of banana and more fresh baked bread. A touch of sweetness and possibly a touch of astringent clove in the finish. Really drinkable and a great late spring refresher. It has enough body and complexity to capture your interest before a hefe is required for the dog days of summer. Really pleasant."
"T: Similar to aroma. Spices and dried banana stand out the most. Some well-done caramel sweetness carries through in the back. The body is wonderfully soft and slowly floats through your mouth leaving a juicy, clean finish."
"Overall - A very good example of the style. Definitely worth drinking."
"Drinkability - Despite the recommended food tastings I had it with a potato/carrot/onion/parsnip/cream soup (Pottage) and I thought it went really well with it. Quite nice and a good beer to savor over the course of a meal and later on."
"I could definitely have another one of these. In fact, the next time I have one of these, I think I'll pair it with a Hefeweissbier because I think they would complement each other very well. Another simply amazing brew from Weihenstephaner."
"I would pair this with its brother, Hefeweissbier, only if it was more readily available to me at my local. Definitely deserves high honors as a top sessionable beer."
"Poured a dark nut brown with large beige head with good retention. Smells of banana and clove, typical hefeweizen smells with some malt as well. When I took a sip, my first thoughts were banana bread. Tastes of malt, banana, some mild cloves. Very delicious. Mouth feel was medium with good carbonation. Smooth and creamy. High drinkability."
"This is one of my favorite beers. Dunkelweizen is very interesting German style. It has everything people look for in quality hefeweizen with out all the orange and coriander flavors. Instead they taste like applesauce. Tangy acidity, nice color, wonderful flavors, there is nothing not to like about this beer from the oldest still operating brewery in the world."
"Drinkability: this would make a great session beer. It's got a great flavor and texture that make this eminently quaffable."
"Body is medium (or even light-medium), with a high carbonation level. Crisp and refreshing. A supremely easy drinker."
"i think smooth pretty much sums up this beer. where the lighter hefe comes through bright and sharp, this one mellows out and maybe loses a bit of the refreshing quality but replaces it with a laid back mellower character. nicely done."
"Drinkability: Really nice beer, great example of a dark wheat beer, from the oldest brewery in the world."
" Glad I picked this one up. This is my second beer from this brewery and it's got me wanting to try more German beers!"
"Drinkability- Definitely worthy of another purchase. A nice autumn beer with a nice refreshing quality balanced by a fuller malt flavor than a traditional hefe."
"D - I'm a big fan of this style and this is probably my favorite version. Its extremely drinkable during any time of year. I could drink these all day."
"D: Despite the thin moments with the mouthfeel, I really enjoyed this beer and, at the price ($2.99), I would not hesitate to buy another."
"Overall, a good representation of the style. My bottle is going somewhat slow, but I will be able to finish it without a problem."
"This is another great Weihenstephaner beer. Probably not as good as the standard Hefeweissebier but a tasty, refreshing beer that fills hits all the marks of a solid wheat beer."
"Frothy creamy off-white head of thick foam, bubbles just large enough to dissolve quickly down from two fingers, any lacing slides down the glass sides. Murky light brown to orange in color, fairly muted, actually looks like rusty pipe water. The amount of banana in the nose is shocking, outpaces the mineral water as well as the cinnamon bun, caramel, clove, can't shake this metallic edge, gentle apricot to pear scents slip in unobtrusively. Medium-bodied, the carbonation has a strong lifting effect, to the point where it combats the flavors as they try to soak the palate. This keeps things waxing and waning, from the chocolate, caramel, clove spice to the fig, date, peach, apricot fruit. Nothing can rise above the rest and enunciate clearly. More dough than cooked bread, retains some minerally freshness. Creates a perfumed moistness in the mouth. You just wish there was more depth and length in the primary flavors."
"A very good beer and it's this good even being a bit out of date. I really want to try this one fresher (as with many German beers locally fresh just doesn't seem possible, but I was counting on quality keeping it great tasting for a longer period and I was not dissapointed)."
"Cheers!"
"I wish I could by this beer by the gallon, I would have no trouble finishing any amount of this beer. An absolutely fantastic beer."
"Interestingly complex for a wheat beer. One you can savor given its complexities, or quaff down some food with given it's moderate ABV. Preferred slightly over Franziskaner's offering given the lighter malt body and more evident subtleties."
"Subpar for Weihenstephaner."
"Very drinkable."
"D - Straight 4's all around! First time I've ever rated a beer this way. On the whole, this is a pretty good dunkelweizen. Like the regular Hefe, but darker and bolder. Goes down easy, tastes great and is very refreshing. I still prefer the original Hefe."
"I have been typically steering away from dark beers and wheat beers lately, but this is the best wheat beer I have probably ever had AND it's dark! Go figure."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Sweet, malty, and smooth."
"Bottle date reads 7129 which fyi means the 7th or 17th day of the 12th week of 2009. This beer looks awesome: huge, fluffy head with an effortless pour that never quite disappears, tons of lacing, unfiltered hazy goodness with a copper hue that gets a bit lighter towards the bottom of the glass. Smells wheaty, prominent banana and clove, spicy. Tons of banana and cloves in the flavor as well, peppery, some lemony zest. Excellent bitterness/sweetness balance. This is a lot more similar to the regular hefe than I anticipated, which is not a bad thing. The malt is just slightly toastier. The high carbonation lowers drinkability, but it tastes so good that my glass is emptying pretty quickly. Great beer."
"A very pleasant mouth feel, too. The rich malts and fruit overtones really compliment the wheat well, making for a richer hefeweizen. This is a really pleasant and satisfying beer - especially for the price!"
"Finishes soft and smooth. Refreshing, yet a real drinking experience."
"Cheers!!!"
"Overall, it may not rub right with others on here, but I think I like this even better than the regular Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. Perfect amount of flavor and just the right amount of chewiness. Would have again without a doubt."
"D: This is a very tasty dark wheat beer. It's very flavorful yet light and refreshing."
"Not as good as the dunkel or the hefeweissbeer, this is nonetheless another great beer from weihenstephaner. Shared this one after the dunkel, had a good combination of both beers with a refreshing quality that will knock you out as much a the stonger dunkel. Would recommend this if you can find it in the states. And, once again, if in berlin, you should find this restaurant."
"D - Personally, I can't session wheat beer's like this. The bread flavours seem to fill me up too much and won't leave room for any other booze. But still an awesome beer that I will endeavour to drink more of."
"Is extremely, extremely smooth and drinkable. One of my favorite Dunkels, and only second to Schneider Aventinus."
"Notes: This very good beer is not as good as the standard Heffeweisbier but is a very drinkable and respectable beer."
"Deep copper, with orange tinges. Big fluffy, welcoming head that laced nicely. Typical banana, clove and wheaty notes on the nose. Just a little restrained, would've liked it to jump out of the glass a bit more. Magic in the mouth! Smooth as silk, nice carbonation. Just right for a weiss. Those expected banana and clove notes melt nicely with a bit of malt. Could drink this everyday without getting sick of it. Yum."
"Pours coppery brown/darkblood red. Huge biscuity head, just like every other Weihen beer I've tried. Just awesome looking. Smells a lot like a hefe, big citrus, banana, some clove. A bit of cherryness in there also. Tastes a bit lighter than I was expecting, not a very dark or strong dunkel. Like a slightly darker version of a hefe. The banana-ness is tuned down a notch from the nose, and maybe a bit more spicing/clove than in the smell. Overall on the lighter side of medium body, like a slightly heavier hefeweizen. Mouthfeel is awesome, so creamy and easygoing. A smooth, easy drink. Not my favorite Weihen brew, but still quality like all the rest."
"Weihenstephaner is an outstanding brewery. Try as many of their beers as you can find. All of the ones I have had so far have been great."
"This is such a drinkable Dunkelweizen. Great on a hot day. It reminds me a lot of the hefeweizen but the scents are more subdued & the maltiness stronger in the taste."
"D: Not quite what I expected, honestly, but a very solid beer. A tasty and drinkable wheat beer that will appease any wheat beer fan. Weihenstaphaner continues to impress me and I will definitely search out more of their products. No complaints here."
"Overall Impression- A very good beer. Good body, not too light but not too heavy. Wonderful flavor profile that makes this a great pairing with dessert."
"Thin to medium bodied with a medium but sharp carbonation"
"This brewery has a nack for making perfectly balanced, supremely enjoyable, well-rounded beers. I've never had one that wasn't great and this is no exception."
"Still has a nice spicy finish, and the mouthfeel is reasonably interesting, but it's a bit too tangy as a complement to the sweeter malt. As with the Hefeweißbier, a bit too bitey to be greatly drinkable."
"I know this bottle was not old at only six months and would definitely purchase another but still would like to try it a little bit fresher. All in all solid beer."
"It was very good. I will definitely drink this beer again."
"Brauerei Weihenstephan knows what's up. Another excellent beer."
"Crisp, sessionable beer, very refreshing, easy to drink, a very good beer that leaves you wanting more."
"Overall this is a tasty dunkel and once again Weihenstephaner does their job well. Worth a shot."
"Overall, a great Dunkelweizen, but I'd reach for an Ayinger first..."
"D - A bit disappointed. I could not detect bittering hops and the roasted, almost burnt malts made this a tough one to drink. I really enjoyed Franziskaner's Dunkel and expected similar features to style."
"I'm springing for the flagship Hefe, though this one is a great beer...it's not quite as good."
"Drinkability: excellent session beer. Highly recommended."
"D- all night long. this one was finished in record time. ill check this one quite often this summer. probably the best dunkel ive ever had."
"this beer pours a nice hazy amber color with an amazingly thick creamy off white head... lots of co2. but that might be helping the aroma, the hefe yeast have done their thing, and there still might be a bit of malt in the back. the taste definitely hits the mark, the banana and spice is nicely rounded out by the roasted malts and wheat. the co2 was a bit aggressive, but a nice body none the less, a very drinkable beer."
"had this on tap at the breezy point inn at greenwood lake - the waitress taught me the correct pronunciation when i ordered - following a hofbrau maibock - chunky brown with a 1 1/2 finger head - smells sweet and malty - i agree with the heffe/dark malt take on this beer's taste - crisp and malty sweet - goes down easy."
"This brew is good, but I don't think it's anything special. It tastes like a malty Weihenstephaner Heffe... good, but better as the Heffe."
"Spritzy carbonation works well to support the traditional watery wheat flavour/texture. Highly drinkable!"
"I'm kind of embarassed I've not given this style a fair shot before as I'm more into Belgian and English styles. While not exactly up my alley this was very interesting and enjoyable. After this I'm going to take a second look to see which other styles I've been missing out on."
"Highly recommended. The Weihenstephan crew definitely know how to do it!"
"I was expecting this to be one of the best dunkels I've ever had and it lived up to the expectations. A supremely drinkable beer."
"I was a huge hefe lover a few years back and its probably best I didn't review this beer then as it would have no doubt been ""brilliant"" just like others. Now i'm a little jaded on hefe for reasons unknown, however, I can say that this is a great Dunkel."
"Drinkability is killer. I had a stein of this and needless to say this was beyond magnificent. Great flavor, great volume, and overall provides a great buzz. Definitely grab a pint or two of this, as you will thoroughly enjoy it."
"Poured a dark maple brown color with a thick foamy tan head big and cloudy too. Nose is chocolate, brown sugar, clove, wheat and banana. Taste is smooth tasting beer with hints of maple, chocolate maltiness, banana and a touch of clove spiciness. Really good Dunkel overall."
"Overall: Really awesome Dunkel. I love banana bread so a banana bread tasting beer is right up my alley. Next time I'm in a dunkel mood it's going to be hard to find a better candidate at the store."
"I strongly recommend this bier and everyone should have it at least once in their life. This, along with hacker-pschorr, are the best weizens in the world. Prosit!"
"D: Exceptional drinkability. This is a prime example of a session beer. Flavorful, refreshing, exciting, and lower in alcohol. I could drink this year round."
"Drinkability is as good as it gets. You'd be hard pressed to find a brewery that makes weizens as good as Weihenstephaner."
"Drinkability- Well even after all this time the beer remains pretty darned tasty. Sure it's not as good as it could be but it's still better than a lot of fresh Hefs. Glad I tried this and I'll definitely edit my review upon trying this fresher."
"Overall: Very drinkable, Delicious flavors but not overpowering. The subtleties are wonderful and make this beer very interesting. I could drink three of these and still want more! Nice roasted flavor I didn't expect. Very refreshing for how complex this is."
"Beer poured into my Paulaner Weisbier glass. Brew is cloudy and brownish-orange in color. Beautiful pillowy 3 finger head is formed easily, even with a gentle pour. Rings of lacing cling to the glass and the head rescinds a bit initially but then holds 2 cm or so for most of the beer. Nose is malty with lemony notes as well as what I can best describe as jalapeno. Taste is sublime; beer is amazingly well balanced. Caramel is present and some malty sweetness. Beer is smooth and crisp and the finish leaves a light lingering caramel taste. You just want to keep drinking this and quickly and I polished this one off quickly. This and Gordon Biersch DW are the best I've had."
"just really getting into the dunkel's and this is by far the best i've had, to me lots of drinkability but more of a night capper than anything, can't wait to get my hands on more"
"Despite the light mouthfeel, I still feel that this beer has alot to offer with its crisp taste and refreshing finish."
"drinkability is perfect and most likely the fresher the better"
"Hefty white pillowy head with plenty of stick atop a murky dark amber body with plenty of brown hue to it. Reeks of delicious ripe banana with subtle malt sweetness. Complexity of the taste is standout. A subtle peppery and very faint clove spiciness owes it to the yeast's work on the wheat. Bready malt sweetness covers the tongue. Banana settles down considerably after its work in the aroma, but still plays a solid part in the taste. Slightly drying finish. Man, words just don't really do it justice. Chewy mouthfeel with a great level of carbonation - not exactly viscous but it just coats your mouth in a similar way. A truly great beer from ""the world's oldest brewery."""
"This is the most refreshing dunkel weizen I've ever had. Too bad this isn't readily available in my neck of the Odenwald."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy and hazy medium amber color ale with a supper huge off-white foamy head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma of banana ester with some great wheat malt is quite excellent. Taste is very smooth with great notes of banana ester with some lightly sweet wheat malty which provide a great refreshing factor. Full creamy body with great carbonation. One of the best example of the style."
"Drinkability: A delightful dunkelweizen and a fine example of the style. Go out and get some!"
"Taste is much more muted than I expected. This is very much a thirst quencher for a hot day. Clove flavor is the most prevalent yeasty ester, but there is some banana and bubblegum in there too. Zippy wheat tang finishes crisp and smooth. Can I have another please?"
"Brauerei Weihenstephan continues to impress. While I don't find this one quite as special as Vitus or Hefeweissbier, it is very tasty. This one just doesn't have quite the depth or breadth to reach that level. Nonetheless, it is easily one of the top Dunkelweizen's out there and should definitely be sought out."
"D - Very good drinkability. Session type beer. First of this style I've had. I prefer the regular hefe, but this is a very good beer and would love to drink again."
"D = This is a very pleasant drinking beer, I could easily see having several of these at the biergarten."
"I can see why this yeast has become the premier dunkelweizen yeast, excellent flavor profiles."
"This review comes from 3/16/09, which is close to three years since I last reviewed it. On the other hand, I have had it numberous times since then. Pour went in to a Schneider Edel Weiss glass. Color was a light tan brown, about a finger of head. Smells of powdered brown bread, bananas, cloves. More fruit and bread in the taste...extremely complex. Drinkability is perfect, carbonation in just the right place. The best Dunkelweiss out there. One of the best beers out there."
"A very nice dunkelweizen. You can't get much more flavorful than this and it's so easy to drink, which adds to its' appeal."
"Overall I would say this is another success by Weihenstephaner. This is a great Hefe."
"This beer pours a cloudy caramel brown color with 2cm of creamy tan head that shrinks a little, but never really goes away. It smells of yeast, banana, raisins and some hops I can't identify. Very pleasant. The taste is much like the aroma, yeast, banana, raisins, just enough hoppy bitterness to balance it out. The mouthfeel is very fizzy like a hefe should be, but still somewhat heavy and not watery at all. Overall, it's very drinkable, like every other Weihenstephaner beer I've ever had."
"A tad too thin at first but good carbonation level and refreshing."
"Half-liter bottle with a batch-code on the back label. It pours an opaque mahogany, with lively carbonation that builds up a three-finger head, which reduces to a quarter-inch and leaves little lacing. One the nose it's bananas, spicy yeast, wheat, chocolate?, some grassiness, a touch of cloves and perhaps some nuttiness. Light wheat and chocolate on the palate, yeast, a mild bitterness, and just a kiss of green hops on top of a medium, tingly and dry, yet smooth body. Very drinkable and quite delicious - one of the benchmarks for the style."
"D - This would be a definite session beer for me - delicious, incredibly affordable, low abv, light, crisp, and sweet. I'll be buying these over and over again."
"Sweet banana and fruity flavours - almost bubblegummy. Has a crisp mouthfeel with light carbonation. Very smooth. Very nice."
"This is probably exceptional on draft I think I might like this better than their bottled Hefe."
"I could session this all night."
"Great, malty wheat beer with a flavor that is clean, spicy and full. The beer is a light brown with a frothy head. The nose has a ton of wonderfully-spiced banana. There are wonderful caramel malt flavors lurking in the aroma, as well. The malt is sweet and doughy. There is some light bitterness. Bananas and cloves come in from the wheat. It's a maltier version of the Hefeweizen. Great beer"
"OVERALL: Fantastic. One of the best looking dunkels I've seen, and the rest of it is a complete enjoyment. The body needs a little more weight, which would probably give the taste a bigger presence as well and made this one a whopper. Other than that this is spot on. Very enjoyable and dangerously drinkable, this is one I'll be grabbing again either at the shop, or at the Belgian bar in the city."
"Yum."
"A refreshing and highly drinkable Dunkelweizen."
"D - WOW! This one could be dangerous on a summer day, make that any day, when you've got a good thirst built up! If you like weizen beers, this is a MUST TRY!"
"Deliciously bitter, without being aggressive. So being a very drinkable and enjoyable experience. Good beer to keep at hand."
"D - A very clean and crisp beer that's a pleasure to drink."
"The carbonation and light body remind me why the liter beers in Munich went down so quickly. Weinhenstephaner is a perfect example of German breweries. There's a reason why this is the world's oldest brewery. They know how to make a beautiful tasty beer."
"Pours a nice cloudy dark brown, with a cloudy big white head. Excellent lacing and light carbonation. Smells wheaty, a faint lemon, light spices. Has a nice balance of spice, wheat, and an amazing malt that comes together beautifully. Mouthfeel very light and extremely drinkable. This is a fantastic product - as you would expect from such a distinguished brewery."
"MF&F - the carbonation makes a crisp clear drinking beverage, that is more than smooth to drink. though not overwhelming, the carbonation is a prominent effect in the finish and tasting process. I find nothing wrong, whatsoever, with this beer's feel or drinkability. it is wholly amazing an to be awed at, admired, copied, and respected."
"Taste starts off with a slight banana and yeast. There is a subtle chewiness that finishes with an ever so slight carbonation mouthfeel. Smoothness and relatively low ABV make this one very drinkable beer. Due to the color I was expecting this beer to be a little bit thicker and a little more chewy. Very good beer though."
"Decent carbonation and medium-light body make this delicious and refreshing. An absolutely easy one to knock back all day. Fantastic beer."
"Superb German beer from brewers who don't miss a beat. Weihenstephan once again proves why they are one of the best breweries going."
"very drinkable!"
"Mouth feel: Smooth, nicely carbonated, full body beer."
"(rated Jun 26, 2008)"
"A huge off-white head tops a murky brown, bubble filled brew. Head retention is excellent, leaving thick stripes of lacing around the glass as it falls. Smells fruity and spicy(coriander) with some medicinal notes working there way in and out of the aromatic profile. Tastes buttery and malty at first, with some spice, sweet bread and fruits working there way into the mix quickly. Mouth-feel is extraordinarily creamy, but not to thick, which leads to remarkable drinkability."
"Taste: A little bit of bananas and cloves. The taste isn't really wowing me, but it's still a quality beer."
"Picked up a .5L at Abe's. Poured a light, hazy brown with a tall off-white head. I found this to be an aromatic and surprisingly smooth dunkel, but didn't think the flavor lived up to the reviews. I only got simple, dark bread malt and creamy (very slight banana) yeast character. Not exactly as deep as the Hefe, but a fine beer."
"D - I can see drinking a few, but these are much better when you take your time and enjoy them with some light food pairings. The fruit/citrus notes would do more to prevent a session with this more so than any 'heaviness.'"
"It has a good balanced carbonation and a subtle bitterness."
"Pours cloudy amber with a fluffy white head. Nose of bananas and clove, but with more malt and wheat. Bubbly mouthfeel. Sweet flavors of banana are blended nicely with the wheat, bread, and yeast tastes. Good malt profile that gives it a filling feel."
"D: Very, very drinkable. Could drink quite a few of these easily. The price makes this a really good deal...I'll be getting more of this one for sure."
"Could only drink one or two of these at a time."
"Pours a dark maple brown color with a thick foamy tan head that settles into a lasting lacing. Aroma of chocolate, brown sugar, clove and banana. Very smooth tasting beer with hints of maple, hazelnut, chocolate maltiness, banana and a touch of clove spiciness."
"Overall, I'm usually not a big fan of dark weissbiers, but this one is just exceptional. A must try!"
"Poured a light brown-orange with good foam head. Smelled of cloves. Taste was sweet and malty with banana cloves and other spices with a reasonable amount of carbonation. A very drinkable session beer. One of those beers that show why Weihenstephaner is very popular and highly regarded."
"A pretty good example of a Dunkelweizen. Not sure why I haven't had this before. Great flavors with juat a hint of tartness. Recommended."
"From notes. Poured from 500ml bottle, very cloudy brown with amber/yellow around the edges. Dense foamy head settles to a half inch or so, nice lacing. Smell: sweet malts, cloves, yeasty, pumpkin pie spice, ultra ripe bananas. Taste: first thing to hit is bananas (hey what do you know...), then a crispness with the cloves, followed by caramel/roasted/wheat malt flavors, raisin. Mouthfeel: awesome. medium carbonation, creamy, perfectly in-between crisp and sticky, smooth. World's best dunkelweizen in my opinion. Unfortunately I see this less and less around here."
"Good feel on the palate without being too thin. Easy to drink. Another excellent weissbier from Weihenstephaner."
"D - Excellent wheat beer... Well balanced with hints of complexity throughout... Would drink again, but I'm not sure it lived up to my expectations based on the stellar reviews of other BAs..."
"The taste is again a more darkly toasted version of their hefeweissebier, more darkly toasted grain, hint of toffee, some bubblegum and banana, but less than the hefeweissbier. It's light and smooth, yet has nice complexity and balance of flavours, making it unusually interesting and enjoyable."
"drinkability is good. this is a well proportioned dunkel with just enough caramel malts to satisfy the palate, and enough restraint on the citrus and wheat malt to keep it honest. a nice play of subtleties for the palate, with a satisfying finish. cheers!"
"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel pours dark with a large tan fluffy head. It has a wheat and malt aroma. Tastes great with malt, banana, and wheat coming through. It's considered world class by many and I must agree. This beer really hits the spot when I'm looking for something sweet and malty. A must try. Purchased at Chan's Wine World in Panama City Beach, Florida."
"Drinkability is amazing. I could drink these all day every day. At $3.25 a bottle makes it a good deal as well. If you like weihenstephaner or wheat beers in general you should definately try to find this one."
"Pours a hazy brown orange color with a small white head. Bananas and floral yeasty esters. Toasty sweet caramel malt, and a spicy hop bitterness. Good medium body gets a bit more chewy as the beer warms and nears the bottom, very drinkable."
"D- its light but it feels heavy, full flavored and refreshing. the top d-dub on my list hands down."
"D- It's definitely an easy drinker and a nice transition from the warm-weather wheats to the fall seasonals. I drank this on an unexpectedly warm fall evening. I'd look for it again when I'm in the mood for a dunkelweizen."
"This beer looks like cider, like bubbly apple cider, the difference here being the enormous rootbeer float-like head that tops this baby off but doesn't cling too well. Oh yeah, it smells a whole hell of a lot different than a cider as well. Banana bread, but that is a bit of an overstatement to be honest. We've got slight bits of cinnamon-apple and/or cloves, but more of an apply kind of aroma rather than just plain cloves. Yeast is a beast on this, does some wonderful things to this beer, first sips reveals decent amounts of everything, sort of like picking and choosing different spices from your spice rack, sounds lame but it's true. Slight, standard banana, but with an added, creamier, depth to everything. I've never had a pumpkin beer but I feel like I get the idea of one as I drink this beer. The creamy and spicy characteristics of this beer lead me to believe this. Yet for all this beer has to offer, and it's a lot, something about this beer leaves me wanting more, the mouthfeel is just a bit lagging and taste is a bit one sided, a good, but not great, beer. This is a beer that I imagine would taste quite a bit better fresh, but then again, what beer wouldn't."
"D: Very drinkable and the flavors mesh really really well. Definately worth a try."
"Overall this is a solid drink with a bit more character than the standard hefeweizen of the same brewery."
"Pours a dark, opaque, golden brown with a thick, foamy, pale tan head. Nice, fairly strong aroma is wheaty, malty and ""rubbery"" with hints of orange and spice. Flavor is rich, wheaty and malty, and has a spicy and orangy undertone. Texture is very smooth, and finish is pleasing and satisfying."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. One of my new favorites."
"D: Overall the appearance, gentle aroma, summery flavours, & light easy mouthfeel definately left me wanting more. This is one beautiful drop, with flavours leaving me pining for more. Go an easy 6 pack of this."
"Mouthfeel is thick and substantial - creamy up front with a peppery finish, drinkable any time."
"D: Great taste, easy drink, definitely a sessionable beer."
"D - Personally, I could do with a little more fruitiness and nuttiness in my dunkels, but this is obviously a top notch example. While there are others that are more suited to my palate, this is a highly balanced example and as with most dunkels I appreciate the relative lack of phenols."
"If I had to pick a ""favorite"" beer, this could easily be the one."
"I will buy this one again."
"Cloudy dark amber/ brown color with a pillowed cream-colored head. Aromas of yeast, dough, bananas and bubblegum. Bubblegum/ banana flavor mixed with caramel and slight clove notes on a medium body. The fruity chewing gum follows through to the finish on a slightly tart wheat flavor."
"D: It was refreshing complex with great balance and wonderful taste. A bit heavy for a long session but great for a session beer if you are a fan of heffwieissbier."
"Drinkability: Refreshing enough, not as drinkable as the regular but still a good score in this department."
"Highly recommended..."
"The first sip was a challenge. Getting through that head in the tall weiss glass is a challenge. Let's try again. Tip it a little further. Oh what beautiful carbonated tingling to the taste buds. Behind the tingle was some sweetness and citrus with hints of caramel. This is a fine drinkable beer. I would be hard pressed to find a better example of german wheat beer."
"D - Overall, not a bad beer at all. I could easily drink this all night. Good flavor and aroma, and sessionable alcohol content. I dont think this is better than Franziskaner dunkelweiss IMO, but its definitely up there."
"Deep mahogany color with a silky tan head. Nose has citrus fruits, candy malts and spicy yeasts. Taste was a little dull in relation. Still a nice mixture between sweet wheat malts, tart fruits and peppery yeast strains. Nice clean, crisp body. Another great brew from Weihenstephan."
"taste is creamy and thick, cocoa, malt, touch of spice, some wheat, slight banana, and some yeast."
"D- Pretty tasty. I had this with smoked pulled pork sandwiches and it complemented the pork and honey bbq sauce I was using nicely."
"This Dunkel is very similar to the Schneider Weisse Original, which is also dark for a hefe. Very good flavors with this Weihenstephaner and definitely a beer I'd have again."
"Really terrific dunkelweizen, I need to drink some more, but compared with the standard hefeweizen versus an Aventinus I find it somewhat lacking in complexity and heft."
"Poured into a weizen glass for a thin, tawny brown (think thin syrup) with a soapy, three-finger head that stayed forever because of constant carbonation (left lace patches). A sharper than expected citric hop smell with some pepper clove notes. Also picked up vauge sugary malt smells along with some caramel and chocolate. A great citric bite when it first hit my tongue with banana and orange prominent along with clove and some pepper. Medium-bodied and smooth with some creaminess, also tasted some chocolate and roasted malts with a drying backbite (could've been some coffee malts also). Not an ultra heavy dunkle, this is a great beer to sip on and have a couple at any time."
"D- Amazingly drinkable here. Just a touch maltier than the original with a deep down notes of roastiness and chocolate. A definite must have staple in the fridge."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Wonderfully spicy and tangy finish."
"D: This beer goes down very easily. Nice, balanced flavor combined with a crisp feel and medium body makes for one hell of a drinkable beer."
"Poured into a hefeweizen glass, showing a pleasant iced-tea color with a huge dirty-white head that very leisurely skated down the sides, riding the beer to the bottom. This had an outstanding and understated aroma of prunes and cherries in addition to muted bananas and nutmeg. Mildly fizzy going in, lots of malt at the back end that lingered a long time. Definitely a bit denser than a plain hefeweizen, but not heavy. An absolute pleasure to drink."
"Pours a very nice cloudy brown with some slight yellow tints and a lovely foamy white head (pour these slowly!) Nose is all banana and wheat. Taste follows with super banana and cloviness. bubble gummy flavor and radical wheat and yeast flavor. A very light malty caramel note in here. Mouthfeel is nice with ample carbonation and a great smooth feel. Drinkability is second to none (that I have had) and makes me wish I had a case of these for a hot summer day. A near perfect example of the style, the closest to perfect I have found anyway. A goddamn delicious brew, really no other way to say it."
"Weihenstephaner, to me, still is my benchmark beer for Hefeweizens and other related brews in its family. An excellent brewery."
"This is a delicious and refreshing beer. Although pricey, I'm definitely going to get some more!"
"This is a medium bodied, very carbonated dunkel. It has a full palate of nice malty flavors, some apple and clove notes, and a big blast of sweetish wheat like flavors. There is a slight green apple tartness to the beer towards the finish, and a bubble gum sweetness in the middle. This is a fairly complex beer with loads of flavors drifting in and out. There is a nice balance of sweet malts, some a little toasted, some very wheaty, but all very enjoyable. The beer finishes a bit tart with a slightly metallic aftertaste, but very slight. This is a beer well worth seeking out. It is refreshing and eminently drinkable. L'Chaim."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, I would drink it again for sure. It may sit at the bottom of my top 5 hefes, but that's still better than the vast majority of the hefes out there"
"D: This is a drinkable beer, for sure. It's very well-constructed and goes down easy."
"Drinkability: Again, the low ABV yields a fantastically drinkable beer. It's about a half-step away from perfection, in my mind, but it's still in the running for the standard of its style."
"Pours a copper, amber, brownish color. Somewhat murky with a big, frothy head that lasts for days. Smell is subtle but nice and clean. Spices, mainly clove. Banana, light doughy scent. Some caramel and hints of brown sugar. Yeast. Taste is great. Nice and well-rounded. Basically same as the nose. A sweetness but a nice spice and light bitterness to counter it. Again, very balanced and tasty. Apples are also present here. Mouthfeel is perfection. Crisp but creamy if that's possible. So soft and delicate on the tongue. This makes it go down all too soon. Quite the drinkable brew and a classic example of this style. One of my favorite breweries...I think I need to revisit the regular Hefe..."
"Ah, smooth crisp and refreshing what a pleasant surprise. The pour is a murky water brown. An extravagent pillowey head forms and never leaves. The aroma fills my nose with some nice banana and clove scents. The flavor is good there is a nice touch of sweet maltiness that helps tame the yeast & wheat dominance. As stated before this beer is really smooth, and absolutely enjoyable. This Dunkelweiss is much better than their original Hefeweiss."
"This beer is a nice dark amber color. Pours slightly clear until you add the yeast at the bottom of the bottle with a thick dense white head. The aroma is of a nice banana and clove yeast aroma, some soft sweet breadiness as well. The flavor has a bit of malt sweetness with fruity banna flavor. The body is medium with a robust carbonation. Very good drinkability, especially as a hot summer quencher."
"D - I wish I had another. And another. This is my new Dunkelweizen standard."
"One of the best dunkelweizens I've ever had."
"D- Easy to drink. A definite must if you want to live on the darker side of summer."
"D-Excellent brew, head if its class. Could be my everyday session beer."
"Mouthfeel is effervescent and lively, but the entire package is just a bit wanting."
"This Dunkelweizen is truly one of the best as far as presentation goes. Be that as it may, I still think I prefer Franziskaner in the flavor department."
"Pours a nice murky brown with a huge rocky head. Nice lacing on the surface the whole way down the glass. Aroma has cloves, bananas, a hint of smoke with some underlying sweetness. Taste has great wheat spicy complexity. Cloves, cinnamon, bananas and pears. A bit of roasted malt flavor. Some yeasty earthiness. Medium to full bodied and well carbonated. Pretty drinkable and and an excellent dunkel"
"Slightly toasted banana flavor, along with clove and coriander spiciness create a pleasant dark beer summery flavor. Marshmallow sweetness followed, along with a very subtle bitterness. Overall this is a nice dunkel that is worth a try."
"An enjoyable Dunkel. Refreshing and easy drinking. Could be an all year beer instead of just a summer beer."
"D - Drinkable in spades! Outstanding for the style and even better for summer consumption when one tends to veer for lighter brews. Yum! :)"
"Very drinkable, and at 5.3% abv, quite sessionable."
"M/D: Carbonation not really that noticeable as in most beer of the style. The beer was smooth and creamy, but as noted above, slightly watered down. Overall, still highly drinkable."
"A good Dunkle, but not my favorite of the style. This needs a more bold roasted flavor in my opinion. Still, very enjoyable and one I will not pass up very much when I see it."
"Had this at Track 84 on draft a couple weeks ago and thought it was excellent, but wasn't really able to take notes, so here goes. Served in my Oberon weizen. Poured a translucent brownish-amber with gold highlights. Tight, dense four inch off-white head with lots of sticky lacing present throughout the tasting. Scent of spices hits you immediately out of the bottle (corriander and clove), followed by bubblegum and a light banana essence. Wheat flavor dominates up front in the mouth; flavors identified in the nose are present, but very much watered down and somewhat muted and bland. Also detected a light yeastiness towards the finish. Mouthfeel was somewhat watery and light without very much effervescence; surprising considering the density of the head. Very good drinkability. Went down easy, but the experience was very different than when I sampled it on draft."
"D: Drinkability was incredibly, rich, creamy, sweet and very smooth going down."
"D: This is a very nice beer and although it comes across dark, it is still a very drinkable brew. It is not intimidating in flavor and very well rounded. Great beer."
"This one looked incredible; a deep orangey-brown color with a huge frothy head that sat up there for forever. Nose was a ton of yeast, wheat, sweet but roasted caramel malt. Taste was likewise, really delicious, although not quite as overwhelmingly flavorful as their standard hefeweizen. Feel was nice and thick, good for the style. Overall, a very tasty beer that I would get again."
"Drinkability here is good. This isn't something I've tried before so I don't know the style too well, but it has amazing character and I'll be getting a few more. I wonder how this is a bit warmer."
"The mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Drinkability is excellent.This is a beer you could drink a lot of on a warm summer day."
"Freshly baked wheat bread sits beneath a perfect blend of bananas and cloves. More of a ripe banana bread esteryness rather than just straight up bananas. Bubble gum is there as well. Whiffs of caramel. Nice. Taste follows suit, more or less. Wheat bread twang up front. Nice and yeasty. Quick notes of noble hops as well (Tettnang?). Caramel and banana bread flavors take over. Some banana bitterness around the edges (and through the finish). Clove and rye bread spice come in near the finish. Thick, protein-rich feel. A bit drier in the finish. Damn good! Man these guys know wheat beers."
"MF&D - Outstanding. A must try."
"Pours a cloudy copper penny color with a nice even white head. Nose is malt and esters, caramel and tart fruit. Taste is a delightful light maltiness with a healthy serving of hef fruitiness/citrus; a deliciously light malty beer. Mouthfeel is nicely middle of the road, considerably fuller and chewier than a standard hef but light enough to still be an enjoyable warm-weather beer. At 5.30%, it's still very sessionable. A very good beer!"
"there was this month or two in my life, mid-summer, that i was living in a flop spot and looking for a job and i was eating all these granola bars someone threw out and cans of peaches in the oppressive summer heat, and i blew my grocery budget on a bottle of good single malt scotch that i would make a dinner out of... it was good but a case of this would've been a better way to spend that 50 bucks"
"Crisply carbonated and a bit spicy."
"D - Quite spicy, this is a nice example of the style and easily drinkable."
"D: Good, nice flavors and easy to drink."
"Perfect carbonation with a smooth finish and an intriguing essence of clarified butter. Easily quaffed, and frankly, hard not to."
"Average body."
"Very light, smooth, and refreshing. Maybe there is a reason they have been brewing for so long. A very elegant beer sure to impress and sure to satisfy."
"Overall - An excellent Dunkel... certainly lives up to it's ratings.. recommended..."
"Overall this is a very good beer. Not too sweet, not too thick - just right for a hefe weizen. Good work Weihenstephan!"
"The smell brought scents of cloves, bananas, yeast, malt and lemon. It was sweet malts initially finished semi dry. It had the classic Hef taste but also some yeastiness which gave it some excellent complexity. It did taste close to banana bread. Overall a excellent beer to drink anytime. I bet it would be awesome on sunny day."
"D: My first dunkelweizen in a while, a tasty beer, though I do prefer their regular hefe beer."
"Poured from a bomber into a weizen glass I acquired with this great sampler. Poured a hazy iced tea brown with mysterious cloudy movement, very intriguing. I get my balls broken for always picking up banana smells in my weiss beers but this one had banana all over it followed by hints of fresh bread. Awesome smell. Loved the smell but was blown away by the taste. Banana sweetness followed by delicious chewy biscuit breadiness and finishing with a very faint malt flavor. Nice chewy thick mouthfeel. Each swallow left behind a delicious tasty coating. A perfectly balanced beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange-brown with a nice tight white head that fades to a ring. Light aromas of banana and bread. The taste is fuller and richer with lots of banana and more fresh baked bread. A touch of sweetness and possibly a touch of astringent clove in the finish. Really drinkable and a great late spring refresher. It has enough body and complexity to capture your interest before a hefe is required for the dog days of summer. Really pleasant."
"Drinkability - A couple in a row would go down smooth. A warm weather beer with a little more to it. I've yet to try a Weihenstephaner that I didn't like!"
"(Respectfully) extremely drinkable and sessionable."
"drinkability is quite good, it's a tasty, well balanced, easy drinking beer, and spot on for the style."
"Supremely drinkable. A standard for Dunkleweiss, nothing better for cooler days and night. Delicious and easy to knock back as many as you want. It is a bit more filling than a hefe due to the more substantial body but who cares!"
"Mouthfeel is very crisp and clean. Very session-able. I'm going to have to revisit this one in the summer."
"All in all a fine beer, not the best Dunkell Hefeweissbier I've ever had, but well up there with the better ones."
"This Dunkleweizen pours out a dark-amber hued tan, absolutley gorgeous,billowy head blooms from the top of the weiss glass. Notes of colves, some banana, citrus, yeasts,hallertau hops. Flavor is absolutley refreshingly delicious-cloves,citrus,banana on the finish some bready yeasts in there as well. Crisp mouthfeel makes for crazy good drinkablity. Having this beer oder Radler(with a splash of lemonade) is how it was presented to me in Germany, where they drink this at 10 Am. read on the health benefits of these brews, and these people are really on to something!"
"I can see me drinking a lot of this in the summer months."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this brewery just continues to impress me with their knack for keeping beers simple and making them very, very well."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D - Outstanding, this brewery is awesome, I can't wait to pop the hefeweizen. An excellent brew, very highly recommended."
"D: I have one of these in front of me the whole night through."
"The flavor was nice along the same lines. Was stronger of the sour bacteria and the aged malt. No hops anywhere in this beer at this point. Very smooth and enjoyable. I was told that last year this same batch was at its peak, too bad."
"Appearance cloudy brown white head that left to quickly but had decent lacing on the edge. Smell tosted grains and hints of apple. Taste tosted grain caramel and again apple. Mouthfeel mediam body and high carbonation. Drinkability not bad if its late spring or early fall I will buy this one again."
"Overall a superior dunkel."
"still a decent beer"
"A beautiful beer."
"Mouthfeel? Holy smooth beer! Minimal bitterness, smooth texture, and perfect carbonation... you'll never get tired of having this in your glass. I wish I had a second bottle. Off Veetersayin."
"D- Fantastic drinkability, classic weizen flavours, with the nice chocolateyness of the dunkel, sprizty and refreshing, a classic from a world class brewery!only gave a 4 for appearance as i like dunkels to be darker, but thats just me!"
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, very low carbonation on the tongue, excellent drinkability, really smooth and refreshing."
"Overall - I doubted that this would be as good as the regular Hefe, but I was certainly wrong."
"Well what can one say about this beer?? Yes it is a dunkelweizen or dark wheat beer. but really it is an absolute fantastic beer. I have read so much latley about how German beers are one dimensional and boring but after drinking a beer like this how can anyone belive that stupid argument. This beer is great looking. Smells better and tastes better than that. Try one you will see."
"Throughout this review, you might have noticed that I found this brew really sweet. Wait until I brew my own hefewiezen and I bet I'll appreciate this one more, but for now, meh."
"D: Again, the carbonation was a little strong. A touch of bloat, which I would not expect following only 2 drinks. Goes down seemingly light, but bottoms out a little on the heavy side."
"On the pour the beer looks just like fresh apple cider with a smell of mault and a touch of bitterness. Nice fluffy head that stays for a bit with a touch of stickeyness. Good taste of mault and maybe butterscotch that balances out well, almost perfectly. Mouthfeel is good, maybe a little fuzzy but good none the less. A very drinkable brew with a nice taste. Another high score for Weihenstephaner."
"D - This is a very easy to drink beer it could easily be a session beer"
"Pours a clouded gold brown with no head. Nose is slightly sweet in a banana kind of way. That is basically the prevalent fragrance that hits you the whole time. Bananas. Big fields of them. Flavor is smooth and a bit mild, but even. There is that hefe typical character there with a strong banana skin profile to it, just like the nose. Feel is smooth on the mouth. Definitely drinkable. A really good brew that is worth trying."
"Overall, a decent beer that I could see myself possibly buying again but not one that I would actively look for or really try to buy frequently."
"This style seems to be all over the place. From lots of ester presence to lots of malt presence and everything in between. If you like the malty emphasis, then you will like this."
"D- Was okay, the carbonation bite and the weight of the beer makes this a little cumbersome."
"Very impressive."
"In my Weihenstephaner glass. This beer poured a cloudy, murky light tan color and formed a foamy off white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of cloves, spice and a hint of malt. A flavor of malt, clove and spices. The body is medium light and slightly sweet finish. Very much like a hefe, but with slightly different charactistics."
"D: Very drinkable - the cleanliness at the end keeps the flavors at bay so they don't interfere with a meal. This would be a great dinner beer, but it isn't really my style for casual drinking. I will be buying it again."
"#3 on my list was this one ; pours a hazy med-brown w/ a huge fluffy off-white head which lasted, good lacing as well, another dunkel-weizen that turns tri-color in my weizen glass, this one went from straw to a reddish-gold to light brown in front of my blu-spectrum flourescent desk lamp, the bubbles, only visible in the light part of the beer, start to rise slowly at first, then after where the glass narrows, they scream skyward & out, sorry it's just kinda trippy ; a fruity bread-like aroma w/ a slight citrusy, bananna-ish undertone ; a tart fruity taste, crisp and malty w/ hints of caramel, lemon and coriander ; a light body w/ plenty of bubbles, sticks on the tounge just long enough to let the flavors come through, and dry enough to make you want more ; a very drinkable beer i consider this the best dunkel-weizen i've tried.."
"Wheat beer is glorious, and this one is even better as its a dunkel. Very malty and fruity while not bogging you down with a huge amount of carbonation. If you like munich dunkels, and hefeweizens, you should give this a try. It's not the best of both worlds, but its pretty close."
"from a bottle at our Octoberfest, hadn't had one since same time last year. Obvious phenolics in the aroma with that hint of caramel and chocolate. Slight wheat tartness and then rounded off with the coloure malt flavours. A bloody nice change from the lighter weizenbier"
"Was almost caramel colored, with ok head, and ok lacing. Smell was very fruity, not only bananas, but some citrus too. Taste matched the smell, bread, bananas and a hint of citrus. Mouthfeel was ok, a bit girtty, and there was some sediment in the bottle. Drinkability is above average. Goes down smooth. Overall I enjoyed this beer. This is a nice beer to drink in the autumn. Not to filling. Good with some grilled foods."
"Overall - you've probably heard that beer is liquid bread. well, this one is liquid banana bread. its really very good and one of my favorite dunkel hefewieizens, but not one that I would drink all the time, only when I am in the banana mood. It might not be a beer for every occasion but it comes highly recommended from me."
"500 ml bottle. Slightly murky,brown beer, with a terrific tan head.( tight and bubbly). Very wheat filled aroma, some toffeeish malts. Nice flavor profile, semi-sweet milky almost maltiness, then a good strong wheat mouthful, can barely detect hops in the finish, overall very nice and well balanced. Very good palate, quite thick for the style and a pleasant after taste. Good drinking beer."
"Drinkability is very high though because it is refreshing as hell"
"D – A drinkable, not overly dark, roasted beer with subtle nuances in the flavor, aromas, and finish. Not the best but a a definite improvement over mass market commercial grocery store. I've a preference for Stouts but this is a nice change and would go well with a beef or BBQ dish and still hold it's own. Not my first, second or third choice as an everyday brew, but one I'd grab given a limited restaurant beer-list. Buy again? Yeah, probably as a change of pace or definitely Yes if on sale."
" Overall I do not know what else I can say. I love all things German and this was no exception. One of the finest quality brews I have had in a very long while. I would be happy to try this one again any day and in fact will be looking forward to having some again very soon. Great choice here and another very solid offering."
"Pours a cloudy brown with orange edges, thick off white head forms, eggshell colour, leaves a few lace spots, settles to a thin ring. Smell is sweet and malty, caramel, chocolate, light vanilla and banana, touch of yeast and spice. Taste is similar, nice caramel and bready malts, banana, touch of citrus, spices, chocolate, yeasty finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation. Another solid beer from Weihenstephaner, a nice dunkelweiss! Thanks Jan."
"I could drink this all night. It is a shame it is so warm in October. This is a perfect fall/winter beer."
"I was having a big Southern style party with a blues band and we served this and the Brooklyn Pils. The chocolate and banana nuances that came through so valiantly before were toned down in the taste, but you could smell them like flowers. That was odd. I would like to try this again on tap to see if it was just me."
"500mL bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a murky, muddy brown with good head. The head does fade and there is little lacing. The aroma isn't overly strong, but then again I don't seem to be smelling all that much these days. The flavour is sadly weak. There's some OK wheatiness, but it fades quicker than I would like, and there isn't much in the way of the banana flavours that I like in a good weizen. That being said, this may be one of my first dunkelweizens, so perhaps those are different."
"dark amber to brown hazy beer with a foamy, pillowy head. A flavorful banana with a light hop smell. Refreshing, light mouthfeel. Has a similar taste to the smell up front with a bit more of a caramelized aftertaste. An excellent beer. My second favorite of the brewery's offerings."
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable dark wheat... one of the best examples of the style, and one of the best wheat beers available. My personal standard for a dark hefeweissbier. Just a great beer!"
"Just a wonderful all-around dark wheat bier. More will find the way into my fridge! Every beer I have tried from this brewery has been nothing short of wonderful."
"Overall it was very smooth and drinkable, and I can definitely see myself downing too many of these in a single sitting."
"This beer started off at 4.25 for me, but now rates 4.4 (you will see that some of the comments don't quite match up to the score). Very malty, moderately spicy and fruity, completely delicious. The second best wheat beer in the world after the regular hefe."
"D - This is good stuff! It's refreshing and complex at the same time, and that is the key to drinkability IMO, but the only reason that I didn't give this a five is that it is pretty damn sweet. I think that without big hop flavors, high ABV, or a little bit of roastiness, beer like this can get cloying after maybe two. That said, this is my second Weihenstephaner beer, and my second beer from ""the world's oldest brewer"" to receive a score of 4.5+! I'm impressed!"
"D: Good. No problems drinking this one pretty quickly, though it is nice to slow down a little to enjoy the taste. . . ."
"D- This beer seems like it would be pretty drinkable in that it is not too offensive but its not nearly as flavorful as I was expecting. None the less it seems to be a good thirst quencher"
"A classic dunkel weizen that is absolutely delicious. This clearly outshines so many others. Unique, yet well within the style. Another great brew from this awesome brewery!"
"Pours a murky mud puddle brown color with an egg shell head that was average but left a nice cap once dissipated. The smell is subdued, but still has distinct clove and banana characteristics. The taste is of light clove and banana, the flavor are a bit subtle but good, a slight touch of metallic malt to offset the sweet banana/clove. The feel is moderately bodied with a nice creamy texture, nice and smooth, very balanced, finishes quite nice. Great dunkel weisse, not as good as their hefe or kristel, but quite superb."
"Extremely enjoyable and drinkable Dunkel. I could drink this all day and at 5.3% I could attempt to. All around great beer that will turn me on to try out more of this style.."
"A very solid wiezen, especially on this hot summer evening."
"D - Overall a very delicious Dunkelweizen, but it doesn't live up to the hype. I honestly think that Franzikaner is superior. Regardless, this is a delicious brew."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a murky rust-orange color with a glistening off-white, bubbly head. The smell is like a typical hefe - cloves, yeast, slightly sweet and this one is a bit bready. Taste is similar to the nose, very clovey and spicy... very similar to Weihenstephaner's traditional Hefe. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a frothy, creamy carbonation and incredibly smooth. This is a very drinkable beer, another testament to the quality of beer from ""the world's oldest brewery""."
"Drinkability: not too sweet makes for easy drinking. Thirst quenching brew. I love burping up that fine banana flavor. Bring on a few more!"
"Drinkability: I have a soft spot for wheats, especially during the summer months. This one is nice, a little fuller than a regualr wheat."
"Four fantastic beers, but just one winner. What a shame, because all these beers deserved a nomination. The Wei Invite has been wrapped up, so check back to see what you missed. Good night everyone!"
"D - A Nice beer but not all that different from their hefeweizen. A bit more malt to show a difference would have been good. Still tasty and highly drinkable though."
"So the winner in my dunkle weizen taste off is definitely Ayinger Ur Weisse. This one just doesn't have much character. While Ayinger has a banana bread quality, this is just a slight variation on the hefe weizen = boring. I want something that I have to chew, not a thin, meek beer like this."
"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel was red-brown in color and hazy. The towering off-white head had great retention and left lots of lace stuck to the glass. The aroma was very fruity with banana dominating. The taste was fantastic with fruity flavors and some spice. The finish was dry. It was medium bodied with nice carbonation. Drinkability was excellent. This is by far the best dunkel weizen I have tried so far."
"85 degree day, cooling off as dusk approaches, hard day working in the yard. Perfect beer to end the day."
"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel pours a hazy copper color with a thick off white head from a brown 500 ml bottle. The aroma leans toward the clove side of the spectrum. There is a nice thickness to the mouthfeel. The flavor also is on the clove side, with banana being noticeable. A fine beer."
"On tap at Zenos in State College. A- Dark, murky brown with a small, foamy, off-white, quickly-diminishing head. Light lacing. S- Mild. Fruit, whole-wheat bread and berry. T- More pronounced than nose for sure. Clove, berry, honey, citrus, bread and straw. M- medium body, slightly oily texture and moderate carbonation. D- Oh I like this one. Meaty with a very nice light fruity character. Worth a try for sure."
"It had a taste of nice yeasty sweetness with banana flavor - VERY filling. It was consistently sweet and creamy, and went easily. This dunkelweiss has great flavor and isn't at all dumbed down. I do wish that Dunkelweissbiers were more readily available, but oh well."
"No one makes a better hefe than Weihenstephaner (those crazy Germans), but this is my first dunkel. Pours a light milk chocolate with the typical overflowing yeasty head of a wheat beer; the thick head will stay for the duration. Aroma has hints of banana and pie crust. Taste has a peppery spice with a gum like aftertaste, but the lemony hints the regular hefe has are not here. A refreshing beer that goes down smooth."
"Taste is fresh with less cloves and bananas than the smell would suspect. The wheat is very much present and the dark malts add a nice biscuity taste. Aftertaste is dry and refreshing with a very low and almost non-existant hop presence. Drinkability is very good, I could drink this every summerday."
"D - A very good dunkel. Impressive appearance and a very good flavor."
"I love helles hefes so I was keen to hace a crack at this. Poured into Oz schooner glass and there was a good rich head which I made overflow. Bugger. Anyhow, there was a lovely caramel, wheaty aroma which was even more present in the taste. This flavour was cut by a nice clovey, stewed apple note which balanced off the sweeter taste. Not much hops and the more I drank the more interesting things I tasted. Roast beef? Dark chocolate? Its all there but the banana I like in the hefes. The mouthfeel was nice and rich with a full body but rather sticky like a dessert. The carbonation is perfect with continuous moderate bead. I love this and now have a need for it. Now!"
"Wonderful beer, and one of the best dunkel weizens I've had for sure. I'd definitely drink it again and probably will soon!...Very drinkable, very enjoyable. I'm only dissappointed that I waited so long to try it!"
"Recommended."
"Pours a very dark amber with a massive head that takes several minutes to subside. Very sticky lacing down the glass. Aroma is sweet bready yeast and some fruits. Taste follows the aroma with a certain brown sugar taste to it. Nice interplay of the sweets with the fruit. Mouthfeel is very good and beer is very drinkable. You could session this beer very easily."
"Overall a good brew thats tastes much like the name would lead you to believe. A little sweet, but still very enjoyable."
"Overall: A good dark hefe, definitely worth a try. This would be a good one to introduce to your friends who like hefes but not dark beers. Yet another step on the path to great beer."
"Drinkability was also above average. Perhaps the slight acidity makes you want to drink it less quickly (not necessarily a bad thing)."
"cloudy light brown, like fresh cider, with a fluffy white head. aromas of overly-ripe bananas, walnuts, toasted bread, cloves. tastes exactly how it smells, with an emphasis on the ripe bananas, and a bit of bubblegum sweetness. toasty malts and wheat flavors balance perfectly, and the finish is very dry. very smooth, unassuming, and natural tasting. goes down fast."
"At first glance I didn't think this beer would taste anything remotely like a dark beer. The appearance was brown at best, but after smelling it I knew it was going to fit to the weinstephaner reputation of quality. The slightly smokey smell that the hefeweisen has was present and the dark wheaty smells come in right after it. Great spicey mouthfeel that I look forward to trying again."
"Drinkability- not bad."
"D: Weihenstephaner continues for me as one of the more over rated breweries out on the market. This beer was good but nothing special by a long shot."
"Drinkability: I prefer their light hefeweizen in flavor, but this is very delicious and went well with a reuben sandwich."
"Drinkability is pretty good as well."
"D: Highly drinkable and very refreshing. This would make a superb session beer. Also, a perfect brew for hot weather. This is the benchmark for this particular style in my opinion."
"Bottom line: Plenty of flavour in this Dunkel Weizen....I can easily recommend it. Thanks go out to Wasatch for this sample!!"
"Overall quite mild and smooth, and a nice melding of a darker beer with a hefe-weizen. Neither component dominates, and the result is a nice, highly drinkable beer."
"Verdict: one of my favorite dunkels, but not quite the top of the list. It definitely had a ton of esters from the fermentation, but not quite as much as others that I would have to give the cake to, but make no mistake, dunkels don't get much better."
"This beers pours a cloudy medium brown color with a very thick creamy head. Has a very fresh slighty sweet malt smell. Tastes like the smell with a hint of banana. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. This was my first dunkel weizen and was very drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy light brown color, nice carbonation, nice creamy 2 finger head, tons of lacing afterwards. The nose is of malts, yeast, bananna, cloves, slightly grassy, and slight caramel. The taste follows the nose malty/grassy, nice taste of cloves/bananna, nice crisp finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, very freshing brew, highly recommend."
"I like this beer and will drink this one again."
"Notes: Would be an excellent change up beer for summer months. Recommended drinking."
"Cloudy, toffee-ish brown. Huge offwhite head with fabulous lacing. Aromas of sweet fruit (not just banana) and clove. Soft mouthfeel. Flavors are not too sweet. Yeastiness that appears on the back end is interesting and not unpleasant. Fine example of the genre."
"This poured lighter than i expeced for a dunkel. There was a nice head which it retained as i drank it down. The smell was excellent, banana, cloves with a bready yeast smell. this is how you want a hefe to smell. The taste was musty and delicious. A nice fine example of the style, the yeast really shone through, with some nice malt undertones. A very nice beer, perhaps not suited to the winter."
"The beer has the classic, zesty, citrusy, gingery, hefeweizen aroma. The color is a hazy gold-tinged light-to-medium brown. The color is lighter than the ""dark"" designation might suggest. The beer pours with a large amount of head, as is typical to the style. It tastes just as it smells, which is a good thing, but whereas the aroma is powerful, the flavor is mellow. Has a steady stream of carbonation when poured right to the finish."
"Mouthfeel is where this really runs short. Thinner than the frontliners with a higher carbonation that really adversely affects the drinkability of this beer. An average Dunkel compared to the others. nothing wrong with that. Just that there are better and worse choices to be had."
"Very drinkable, I still have some Hefe and Korbinian left; gotta consider getting some more of this too."
"All this made for an extremely drinkable brew. Recommended."
"This is high quality as anticipated and worth searching out for any afficianado of German brew. Tough to beat among dunkels."
"Overall: I have to agree with pretty much everyone here ... this is one of the best Dunkel Weizens out there. Just like their Hefeweissen this hits the spot. The oldest brewery in the world ... and almost undoubtably one of the best!"
"A great example of the style, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: certainly one of the nicer examples of the style and my favorite."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is good, not exceptional, and drinkability is very high for this style. Stylistically, this is an excellent beer, one of the best Germans I've had, and I would consider it for future purchases."
"Notes: I've said it before and this beer is exactly what I'm talking about, if your going to be a malt based brew the malts must have depth. This brew has tremendous depth while still being soft. This brewery never ceases to amaze me. Excellent."
"Drinkability: It's definitely worth a try once, but I think there's better in the style and I probably won't try this again."
"This beer had a creamy off white head on top of a cloudy brown body with hints of orange flashing around; it almost looks like a solid not a liquid. The nose has many components: spicy clove, nutmeg, banana, bubble gum sweetness and a hint of toasted malt. The taste reminds me of banana bread. There is spiciness from the cloves and I am getting a citrus flavor in there too. It has a light mouthfeel making it very refreshing and drinkable."
"An excellent dunkel. Very smooth and flavorful with great carbonation. Also a beautiful beer, it's a pleasure just looking at your 1/3 drank glass with all that huge rocky lace sticking to the glass. Highly recommended."
"In my opinion, Erdinger is a superior Dunkel Weizen"
"Drinkability/Notes: A highly drinkable Hefe Dunkel. Rich and creamy in the mouth with flavors of fresh banana bread, cloves, and bubblegum. Fruity and caramel sweet. Extremely easy to drink at 5.3 % abv and very refreshing. My first hefe dunkel and its a nice contrast to a hefeweissbier, doesnt have that lemony thing going on that most hefes seem to have. Definitely a beer and style that I will have again. Another quality beer from the folks at Weihenstephaner. Seek and enjoy."
"All in all, one of my top dunkels, a favorite to drink anytime, anywhere. A more assertive nose and longer finishing taste would earn it perfect scores."
"Pours with a nice foamy head mmm just the right carbonation with a fruity nose. Good foamy mouth feel with a hint of cloves and a fruity flavor mixed in. It tastes so good; I think I'll have another one. All I need to go with it is some BB-Q. Where is the charcoal lighter fluid? Enjoy!!!"
"Head retention is good, lacing isn't very strong, and the brown color is cloudy and a little golden. The smell is os deep clove, with a little banana and a slight lemon backround. The taste is a little sweet, metallic, very clovey, and a slight banana backround. The mouthfeel is fine like a hefeweizen should be, crisp and foamy. Overall I thought this beer was a little metallic, but I might try it again later."
"Very drinkable and flavourful."
"Presentation: Packaged in a pint brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass. In order to conform to Texas alcoholic beverage laws, the label reads ""malt liquor""."
"Hazy deep caramel colour with a big, fluffy, beige head. As the foam subsided, fine bubbles clung to the glass in clumps. Head retention was supported by ample carbonation. All the aroma notes from a hefe were there (bready yeast, cloves, vanilla with citrusy undertones) along with mild caramel and a hint of cocoa. The same could be said about the flavour. There's a pleasing caramel backbone that played very well with the hefe character. And there's a bit of dry cocoa that came out in the finish. Very nice indeed! The body was on the light side, carbonation fairly high. Crisp and lightly dry on the palate. I was a fantastic beer that I really enjoyed a lot. I'll be picking more of these up at some point."
"I think great...actually fantastic for style. I don't like what I perceive as bubblegum so much but I think for the style they are...how you say...'spot on'."
"This beer pours a hazy brown with a frothy white head that holds and laces well. The smell is very strong with the wheat. The taste mimicks the smell. I expected more of a roasted flavor but didnt get one. The mouthfeel is nice and overall highly drinkable, a great beer."
"D: This would still make a very good session beer, especially during a weekend marathon of football games with friends."
"D: Definitely an excellent beer. A little heavy for drinking more than one, but for a single drink it's definitely delicious."
"Light and refreshing."
"A very solid German Dunkel Weizen and quite enjoyable."
"This beer has well balanced flavors. I couldn't detect the roasty malts in here as much as I would have liked. I'll have to revisit this one for sure."
"Drinkability - this is decent, not great. I'd rather have something different after one of these."
"A real pleasure, a meal in and of itself. Not because it's so heavy (it's not, it's extremely drinkable), but because it's so satisfying and the flavors are earthy and robust and completely, utterly satisfying. Top-notch."
"D- very mellow relaxing beer. So smooth, so tasty, and so freakin easy to drink. I could seriously dream about this beer. Amazing."
"Pours a darker shade of brown with a bit of redness to it. Very large head, especially if poured with any slashing. Had to wait some time before I was able to pour the whole thing in. Definitely a matly nose, most likely of the toasted variety, and also a hint of brown sugar or something equally sweet. Taste is great. Perfect level of carbonation, noticeable but not overpowering. Again the sweet brown sugar taste is back in the middle of the tongue, this time with nut added. Finishes pleasantly with candied fruits and more clove-like spices. This beer goes down very easy as well, if this were more readily available I would drink it all the time!"
"Mouthfeel is fairly still after the pour. For a hot day, this does surprisingly well. No roastiness, very little nuttiness, slightest effervescence prevents this from being cloying AND stops the acidity of an overcarbed hefe."
"Sweet, fruity, juicy taste. Sugary sweetness with a blend of grape jelly, bananas, and citrus. Refreshing on the palate. Yeast notes permeate throughout. Easy to put down, that's for damn sure."
"D- ultimatly refeshing a very very drinkable beir especially on a hot day"
"I bought a bottle of this by mistake, thinking I had grabbed two bottles of the regular hefe. I certainly wasn't disappointed in my blunder when I poured this beer into a hefe glass. Nice coloring, a dark khaki almost and of course hazy. Smell is incredibly robust. There is a sweetness in the aroma that is very difficult to describe and something I haven't really found in any other weisse beer before this one. This beer tastes phenomenal, hints of fruit flavors and very smooth. It was a little to easy to put down a 16.9oz bottle in no time. If imports didn't cost as much as they do, this would always be in my refrigerator."
"This is like a light version of the regular Hefe cause it taste kinda watery. All in all, get the regular Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier cause it is 10 times better."
"Smooth and creamy with a burst of banana split and yeasty bread-like flavors. Transitions to a slightly bitter finish with a hint of clove. Extremely complex for a weiss, this is both an excellent value and an excellent beer."
"Poured to a hazy, milk chocolate brown, with off-white head that dissipated quickly, and little lacing. Aroma of malt, nuts and chocolate. Taste is malt, chocolate and spice, mostly clove. Could not detect much wheat flavor. Not a bad beer, but have had better Hefe Weiss."
" Masterfully made by ""the world's oldest brewery"""
"Drinkability is great. On a hot day, there is nothing like a world-class Weizen."
"I completely recommend this, it's on par with Aventinus."
"Murky brown with a golden hue at the bottom where the light illuminates it. A huge head cascades up to fill the top of the glass with whiteness, which eventually fades to just a thin film. It has a very yeasty aroma. It smells dark and dank, but a bit subdued. The taste is full of yeast, imparting some subtle fruity esters. Banana is in the background. There is also some brown sugar in the background and maybe cinnamon. Throughout, a heavy wheat tang presides. Little to no hop bitterness or flavor, probably just enough to cut the wheat and yeast. It is very soft and easy, not biting in any way. The mouthfeel is full...a true German experience. This is 5.3% and goes down easy....very easy to drink. This beer is very intriguing to me, but I do prefer the straight hefe. I have a feeling this bottle wasn't the freshest specimen around and imagine that hurt it. Unfortunately, no easy to read freshness date was present."
"Overall, a very solid beer for summer drinking. Very drinkable."
"Tasty looking brew. Pours a very cloudy, copper-brown color. Very much looks like iced-tea. A huge three inch thick off white head forms, with excellent retention. Lots of malt of yeast smells, with hints of spices,cloves and bananas. Very nice combination of wheat and malt flavors. A little sweetness in there, like sweet apple cider. Excellent mouthfeel very light and refreshing. Way too easy to drink. A great beer to enjoy, on a hot summer's day. a must try!!"
"D-Very drinkable, a beer to be enjoyed year round"
"I mean, what do you want to hear? its darker, more rich smelling, a bit more full of floaty particles; but man this one sure does deliver. This is like a more tan version of your significant other. Its just darker, and better. Its no less refreshing, but it would certainly pair a little better with stronger food flavors. It is really malt paradise. I prefer mine chilled up and consumed in the following manner. Since this is not a sipping beer, its best to take a giant swig every minute or so, until the beer is gone; repeat until empty, or until you start to understand German."
"This is very solid dunkel weizen."
"Definitely no lemon needed for this wonderful brew."
"Pours a deep copper color with a large fizzy head. The aroma consists of malt and yeast and slight hints of banana. Taste is very clean and crisp and extremely refreshing. There is a nice combination of yeast/banana/cocoa flavors over a nice malt backbone. This is simply another stellar brew from Weihenstephaner!"
"if i had to choose my favorite style, right now, it would be hefeweizen. and this offering is not so different. a nice, slightly darker version. highly recommended, i will get this again and again."
"Hard to go wrong with the world's oldest brewery."
"Taste is a biiit of a letdown after the smell. Isn't as potent. Still good, though. More of the cinnamon, pumpkin, allspice, banana thing going on, just a bit muted, more subtle. Mouthfeel is absoluvely lovely- thick and creamy, smooth, really good. Quite drinkable- perhaps too sweet, too spiced after a while, but if you're in the mood for this, it really hits the spot."
"Very easy to drink, refreshing, and excellent taste and malt concentration. Nice option."
"Pours a cloudy tan-brown, looks like A&W cream soda. Very carbonated, lots of lush head. As a hefe should be, nose is very yeasty with some nice malts and citrus. Taste follows as well, yeast is a bit overpowering, was expecting a bit of balance from a dunkel, this one is very hefe and not much else. The malts aren't expressed as much as I would like, but still very enjoyable."
"Pours a translucent brown honey color, hazy, with streaming carbonation and a fizzy but lasting head. Surprisingly, no lace. Faint wheaty aroma, with a hint of honey sweetness. Taste is quite mild. Wheaty, with the same hint at honey as in the aroma. A metallic edge, and a late spiciness. Quite smooth, with mild, small bubbled carbonation. Light to medium body. All in all a small, tasty beer."
"Poured a murky, yellow-brown color with a frothy, thick head that was colored white. Huge bubbles seemed trapped in the head. Rings of lacing were left behind in my weizen glass. Aromas of wheat, fresh bread, grains, bananas, and cloves. The taste was very much like that of a hefe with the addition of caramel and bread/grain flavors. The fruit flavors were present throughout the session and added depth, in my opinion. Not nearly as sweet as other beers I've had within this style, but still sweeter than bitter. Chewy texture with nice carbonation. Quite drinkable."
"Malt flavor is prevalent, with the slight bitterness of the hops just kissing the palate in the finish. In between there's a flavor of doughy biscuits, slightly salty yet sweet; the bubblegum and lemon citrus flavors floating on top of the wheat malt. Mouthfeel is undeniably perfect. Smooth, not cloying in the least and the carbonation is spot on - not overdone or bubbly like many wheat beers can be. I could drink this all day and night. An exceptional brew, and I've noticed this is becoming one of my all-time favorite styles."
"Drinkability is high. I got 1/2 a case left and it is all I can do to make it last through the week. MK"
"Great smooth mouth; this is an extremely easy drinker. Hats off the brewery & hats off to Glunz for taking such good care of this beer!"
"overall, not as robust in flavor as i expected for a dunkle, tasted more like a regular hefe-weizen, still a tasty beer though, very refreshing, not much to complain about."
"Served in a tall Weizen glass, the head reaches nearly two inches in thickness, with amazing retention. The color is a hazy caramel brown and the head is off-white. Aroma of citrus spice, banana, wheat, and yeast. The flavor is lightly sweet and bready, with a lemony spice, and bit of clove. The flavor carries through unchanged into a rather unremarkable finish. Strong on carbonation, the mouthfeel runs slightly thin. Alcohol seems low. I found it a very easy to drink beer, but I would have liked a little more kick from the taste to make it a top notch selection. I'd stick with the original hefeweissbeer..."
"Overall, a very, very good dark wheat beer, one of the best I've had. Complex and pleasing, deep and easy to drink, Weihenstephaner Dunkelweizen pulls off several seeming contradictions to make for an excellent drinking experience."
"D: Exceptional (So much flavour, yet they go down so easy!)"
"Draft, at the Maple Tree Inn, Blue Island, IL. Not quite up to what I hoped to find. Still pretty nice, though. Color is beer-bottle brown under a fizzy head. Taste is sugary and kind of light. Banana flavor builds up with not much else to balance it."
"D: I think that I prefer the original Weihenstephaner Hefe, but this is definitely a good beer. Get some."
"A classic offering from ""the oldest brewery in the world"""
"A nice hefe."
"Quite possibly the best sandwitch beer ever concocted. I'm having an early lunch soon on this lazy day, and I am aching for sommadis already! Light hazy amber with a nice thic head of pure white foam that stays around. Aromas of clove, spice, banana, and some nice malt complexity come through hardcore and make this one smell like wonderful fresh German bread. Taste is awesome as well, very 'bready' with spice and fruit notes as well. Not much hops, but the style calls for almost none anyways. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is very, very, very good! Bring on the ham on rye!"
"Poured a dark very hazy brownish dark red with a big foamy head of about 2 and a half inches. Smell is dark fruity , malty, slight green apple aroma, faint banana, and spicy yeast. Taste is a light bodied and refreshing blend of wheaty-tart malt , some fruit like green apple sweetness, subtle hops, phantom clove and banana, and a slighty spicy yeast profile. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. A very renewing , flavorful , and thirst quenching Hefeweissbier."
"Pretty drinakble, but I expected more from this. This didn't quite hit al the notes (more fruitiness) I expect from this style. Will try again this summer"
"Wow. This is an interesting Dunkel Weizen. It reminds me of the Ayinger Ur-Weiss, because the dark munich malts really make their presence known. Their rich, smooth malt character blends with the complex, grainy malt character of the wheat with spicy clove and other yeast notes balance the malts to produce one of the finest beers I've had in a while. Wow."
"Overall- this is a good Hefe. I think I like the Dunkel Hefe more than a plain Hefe. This adds another dimension!"
"I'm happy that I can get some of these Weihenstephaner beers in my area now."
"I was hoping to be blown away. I wasn't. But having said that, this is still good and towards to top of the class for style."
"Weihenstephaner has made a class beer here. There's a reason this is the top rated Dunkel Weizen in the world -- because it is!"
"d: great brew for a hot summers day!"
"A very smooth, drinkable dunkel weizen. Some malty undertones, with a pumpkin spice flavor. Billowing head that lasted like some chunky clouds giving way on a bight summer morning. I would buy this again, i'm very happy with weihenstephaner's beers. This brauerei is fantastic."
"I've always had a hard time getting hold of Weihenstephaner for whatever reason, and thought that what I had been drinking was as good as it can get, but I was wrong - this brewery really does make the best hefeweissbiers in the world."
"not totally for me, not bad, a little too fruit (sweet) like for my personal tastes."
"Drinkability -- A very agreeable beer and a nice introduction to the style. I would recommend this beer to fans of the weizen style. I look forward to trying additional beers of this style."
"This beer surprised me in a positive way. Lots of potential with food."
"With an alcohol content in the mid 5s this can be a nice session beer on warm nights will relaxing on the patio."
"cheers"
"Full bodied wheat characters, very refreshing and drinkable."
"Drinkabilty: simply put - fantastic. Go out and grab one of these to bring home."
"Drinkability: I have not had a good weizen in ages. Having this reminded me of why they are fantastic. Light, refreshing and airy and relatively low in alcohol, this is one good beer (and style, too). I highly recommend this one."
"Overall, a good HEFE and damned impressive to see. I will drink this beer again."
"Paired with eggs over easy with 9-grain wheat toast, spiced with salt, pepper, and Herbs de Provence for brunch."
"Sehr Gut!!!"
"Not my favourite style but would appear to be a good example."
"A solid but not overpowering taste. A classic dunkel!"
"I was aggresive with my pour and ended up with about 7 inches of head in a standard pint glass.Surprisingly doesnt look too carbonated. Cloudy amber brew head is slightly off white.Has a wheaty estery smell.Taste ofmalt and wheat not much else,low hopped if at all.Mouthfeel isnt too bad. Drinkability not too bad a lot milder then i thought it would be.Not a bad brew."
"Ooooh my goodness. Everything this brewery makes is excellent. They could spit in a bottle, cap it, and distribute it, and I would still rate it a 4. They've been at it long enough, sho they should have it down pat. This beer has all of the clove, estery, fruity, bubblegum, creamy, silky characteristic in flavor and aroma that you'd ever want in a wheat beer, but with soft caramel, maltiness, and a light maple syrup character. Bring out some nuttiness and earthiness. The addiditon of ingredients that make this beer a dunkel never dominate the wheat character or the yeast derived flavors. Supurb. Finishes clean, crisp with a mild and lasting sweetness."
"This brew pours a cloudy brown color with abmer hues. The head is mammoth and white. The aroma screams of cloves. The taste is of cloves and banana. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall, this is a good dunkelweizen, but I still prefer Franziskaner."
"D- It is missing a lot of the depth of fruits and yeast characters that I like in German wheat beers. It would be nice to have a little maltyness and maybe some other characters to tone down or balance the bubblegum notes."
"Taste: Easy drinking, the wheaty malt can become a bit cloying. It finished silky smooth with witbier banana ester yeastiness. Mixed along with something salty to kill off the sweetness, this Beer is fantastic."
"Poured a huge, dense, light brown head that left puddles of lace as it slowly faded to a film. Hazy cider looking beer with streams of bubbles rising along the edges. Yeasty aroma mixed with doses of lemon zest and banana. Aromas carry over into the flavor with a dash of that zesty lemony wheat flavor on top. Solid yeasty base mixes with bananas and even a bit of cocoa. Soft, light mouthfeel that's almost crisp. I'm a big fan of the refreshing wheat beers (German and Belgian). The cocoa flavors along with increased yeasty flavors combine with traditional Weizen flavors to make this one of my favorite beers overall. The fact that it's 5% and so tasty just makes it all that more amazing."
"Drinkability: 3.5"
"A solid brew all the way around and likely the best Dunkel-Weisen you'll run into just because it seems like a style the US hasn't really welcomed yet."
"There's nothing like a good dunkel weizen, or a dunky beer, as it is usually known. This beer pours out a dull brown color with a big head. The aroma is a delicious blend of banana bread and chocolate. Nutty malt flavor with a wheat tang and plenty of spice. Huge flavors of banana and chocolate too. This is an incredibly complex beer. Thick mouthfeel. Great drinkability. I highly recommend this beer."
"Not my favorite style (I prefer the Heffeweissbier), but a genuinelly solid choice if you're in the mood for a dark German ale."
"This poured with a real frothy head, with a good dark color. Not much of an aroma, but nothing displeasing either. This had a smooth flavor with medium body on the wheat, with a hint of malt to round out the taste. Overall this is a really good beer. A dark hefe, at least in the case of this beer seems to suit me more than a traditional hefe"
"Definitely worth getting again, and one of the better dark wheat beers I've had."
"D - It is good, but it could be better. I will have it some other time, but with the elements presented for this style, I can dream of a truly awesome dunkelweizen, and Weinstephaner simply isn't it."
"Drinkability is very nice and enjoyable. One of the nicest German brews available."
"I would not rate this as one of my favorite dunkels, but it was worth a drink. I prefer the Weihenstephan Hefeweissbier; or Ayinger Ur-Weiss and Franziskaner Hefe-Weiss Dunkel for other examples of dunkel. This was not a bad brew, but it just wasn't on par with any other dunkel I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"With such a positive review of the original, I thought this one would have something exciting to write about. Nothing did it for me. It was above average for the style, but no characteristics stood out, other than the ease to finish. Maybe I'm not a dunkel fan, but i'll pass on this one next time."
"all the while, this is a very bright beer. despite its dark appearance and nutty character the generous carbonation lends to its overall zestiness"
"Pours out a deep, dark, burgundy-orangish with an almost chocolate tone to the color. Excellent head (slightly off-white) with much better than average retention and nice lacing. Smells of wheat, yeast, and typical citrus notes. Very good flavor with very understated hop bitterness and aggressive sour wheat hitting the tongue first. Notable carbonation, but balanced well. Finishes strong with the sour flavor contributing to the dry ending. Mouthfeel is exactly what you would expect from the style - light and refreshing with good carbonation. Very drinkable and extremely enjoyable. My only regret is that I only have this one bottle!"
"Yeah baby, this is one of my all time favorite styles and Weihenstephaner, turns out a very fine version! Plummy brown with a long lasting light tan head, the lacing is slippery and doesnt last long. The nose here is softly spicy and I also get some ripe fruit notes. this stuff is velvet on the tongue and bursting with fruity, yeasty, clove and banana goodness. Finishes with a drying winey, slight sourness. elegent, complex and all around fine stuff."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin. Drinkability was quite nice. I could have this- I think I prefer the lighter hefeweisse in general, but this is quite a happy beer!"
"Drinkability and Notes  Very drinkable, there is nothing objectionable in the flavor whatsoever. This is probably the best dark wheat beer I have had and one of the best wheat beers out there period."
"Body is medium with a very slick and juicey mouthfeel that is quite creamy and soft. One of the best I've had."
"overall this is an awsome beer. The taste is so crisp and clean that i could drink this stuff anytime."
"D - amazing and delicious, clearly an amazing beer."
"Overall, with the exception of the mouthfeel, this brew matches what you'd expect it to be all the way across the board. The look, the smell, the taste all come together to emphatically say ""this is a dunkelweizen", and that's a good thing. Oddly, I'm not a huge weizen fan. Maybe I just caught this one at the right moment. Whatever the case may be, I found this to be a superb beer, and one I'd highly recommend."
"Slàinte!"
"Taste: Sweet with dark fruits, slight spiciness, and some herbs. Hops slight. Finishes with a lingering sweet and spicy bitterness."
"taste? smooth and wheaty, mostly bitter though with some sweet caramel notes also weighing heavy. fresh tartness of lemon and sweet clove back it all up. doesnt measure up to the regular hefe. flavors cancel each other our here moreso than complementing each other. banana is still here but forced into the background by a dark burnt breadiness. ok, good german session."
"Poured a cloudy amber with a huge head of foam that had a hint smell of banana to it. The smell had a fruity yet malty smell to it. The taste to me was a wheaty citrus that was actually very good. The mouthfeel had a citrus banana feel that lasted a little bit in your mouth. Due to the low alcohol content you might be able to drink 2 of these in a sitting. For $2.39 in a 16.9 oz bottle this is an excellent dunkel weizen that I sure to buy again. Keep up the good work Weihenstephaner."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and I will drink it again. At $5 for two 16oz bottles, this is a great deal. I highly recommend it and would suggest it to people who are looking for better beer. It's approachable, yet full of character. I think I actually prefer this to the hefe, but I like them both very much."
"Pours a cloudy, dull brown color with a huge, whipped cream thick white head. The aroma is spicy and fruity, dominated by malt, you can smell banana, corriander, lemon peel, and a biscuity maltiness. The taste, too complex to go throuh all of it, but this is a whopper of a Dunkel Weizen. Begins with a subtle banana taste that segues into a clove and corriander spicyness and then a bready malt flavor with hints of nutmeg and perhaps almonds. The benchmark for a dunkel, complex, easy to drink and very sessionable especially in the warmer months. Easily the finest dunkel out there"
"Overall a good beer, but the hefe is better."
"From this 16.9oz bottle pours a very beautiful deep copper brew with healthy looking white frothy head. Very delicious aroma of bananas, apples, along with sweet citrous and some toasted malt. Taste is a creamy blend of fruits, along with some good clean bittering hops that prickle the tongue. Full taste leaves me wanting nothing. A good blend of toasted pale malt with some darkness provides a hell of a backbone for the subdued sweetness. Some yeasty notes are there as well. Crisp carbonation moves the taste along, and compliments the beer well. This brew is hella good, and wickedly drinkable."
"There is something about die Dunkelheit that I really like. This beer draws parallels to Kozel Dark, although naturally this one is a Weizen, although the only real effect of that is more pronounced carbonation and a slightly more acidic taste. This beer looks nicely nut-brown and cloudy in the glass (important for a Weißbier), but has inadequate head retention for the style. Despite this, smell is pleasing, and body is happily nutty, chocolatey and slightly sour on the palate. Mouthfeel is upset by the rabid effervescence as the beer enters the mouth, but is still good. I would drink this all night in Bavaria if there weren't other magnificent beers on offer. But in Australia, I'd buy the cheaper, similar but superior Kozel Dark (different style but close enough for the comparison)."
"Pours a deep chestnut color, with a fairly small head. Fairly subtle aroma; wheat, banana, but not as obvious as a standard hefeweizen. Taste is also like an understated hefe. Still the wheat flavor, but with a little more of a burnt malt characteristic. A little hint of banana. Very clean aftertaste; smooth drinking with little of the flavor lingering once it's gone. My first venture into this style of beer. I still prefer a hefeweizen, but all in all a very drinkable beer."
"Not quite as lively and complex as the straight hefe, in my opinion. A damn fine beer nonetheless."
"Final Thought: Almost as good as it's non-Dunkel form, a very nice brew from Germany."
"Drinkability- Not my favorite style, but I have to say it was quite tasty. These guys make awesome beers for very reasonable prices."
"overall pretty good, i've haven't had many dark hefeweizens, but this one's good, although i do like weihenstephaner's regular hefeweiss beer better."
"Pours a light brown color almost like a deep amber with ruby hues and a billowing head that leaves no lace. Aromas consist of sweet wheat and huge yeasty esters that give off plummy and grape tones, along with hints of bubblegum and clove. Initial flavors consist of sweet fruits, and an intense wheaty body. There are hints of caramel and almost cocoa like flavors in the mix but these are soon overwhelmed by the strong fruity flavors of plum and fig. There is also just some slight hints of clove and a bit of molasses. The finish has a spritzy carbonation and a sweet wheat tone with hints of bubblegum and more sweet molasses. Overall this beer had a decent body to it to match up with all the great flavors. Another excellent offering from this classic brewery..."
"A smoothy banana weizen. Brown-amber, fruit highlights with sourish and malt finish. Some nutmeg, cloves, cinammon, roasting. Medium-light mouthfeel with high carbonation. Easy draught like drink. Reasonable malts and hops, not overdone. Good with spicy pizza."
"A cloudy bownish beer. Has a big foamy off white head and some lace. The aroma had a light sour aspect to it with a hint of clove in the background. The flavor also had bit of a sour character with a pleasant hint clove. Pleasant mouth feel with a resfeshing nice drinkability."
"A good Dunkel from Weihenstephaner (but I gotta be honest, I still can't pronounce their name)."
"I can't say that I prefer Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel over this brewery's standard hefe weizen, but it is exceptional beer all the same. It may be a while before I have another version that's this good."
"Terricfic taste very smooth and well balanced. The malt was present but not overpowering and the hops and yeast played well with each other. It was perfectly carbonated too, with an after taste that seemed to last quite a while and as I finished this beer I was determined to have more."
"Pours a hazy brown with huge offwhite head that leaves light coating of lace. Aomas of grainy wheat malts, cloves, bananas with a roasted nutty presence eminate from my glass smells good. Taste of grainy earthy malt sweetis that light toffee flavor coming threw with bananas some spices from yeast. Light hops spice in finish along with nutty flavors that linger. Mouthfeel is good medium light smooth good winter brew nice to sip and enjoy the flavors. Drinkability is good this is my first dunkel little strange wheat beer with darker nutty malt added will try again I am sure but not something I would drink often, not yet anyway."
"Nice beer."
"Drinkability: Man this is good. No reason to stop. Excellent all around."
"Poured an opaque brown ale with a fairly thick white head that subsides fairly quickly leavingt a little lace on the sides of the glass. Aroma is more on the malt side of things with a dark malt scent to be detected but not much else except wheat. The taste is very different from both Erdinger and Franziskaner as the esters are very subdued and i can only pick up the barest clove esters. Beginning with a rush of carbonation the toungue experiences a slight noble hop bitterness quickly overtaken by the dry wheat flavor which is blended with a delicate chocolatey malt flavor which segues into a clean finish. An excellent session beer it presents clean flavors with complexity as well as being different from the other Dunkelweizens out there so as to keep beer drinkers in a heaven of diverse beer choices."
"An incredibly good dunkel weiss. Pours with a big head which goes down into a nice, thick lace. The smell is very good, yeasty and malty. The taste has a lot of yeast ester notes, which remind me of Chimay but is typical of other dunkels. A lot of other breweries use this yeast strain (so I remember), so this should be expected. Very drinkable."
"Brown opaque sort of like Mott's apple juice with small tan head that dissipated. Bready and malty aroma. Sweet burnt malt flavor dominates. Fruit flavors also come through (plums?). Very lightly carbonated. I did not detect any banana nor cloves flavors, which I would have also liked, but was good tasting nevertheless."
"Pours a murky brownish color, looks like apple cider. Fluffy head, no lacing (what am I doing wrong?). Cloves, banana dominate in the smell. NIce wheat beer flavor, again with a bananas and a medicinal cloviness (is that a word) dominating. Mouthfeel is smooth, but seems a bit thin. This is a pretty good brew, I could drink a couple pints of this no prob."
"The beer pours a nice cloudy brown color, a little darker than others I have had. The head is about 3 fingers, falling to to a quarter of an inch. The nose is nice and malty. What a blast of flavor. There is creamy banana with nice malty tones. I want to let this one warm up a bit and see where the flavors go. There is a nice thick creamy character to the mouthfeel. Very nice. Drinkability is outstanding. I would love to have a few more of these waiting for me."
"A bit powdery, medium bodied, goes good with grilled meat."
"Sampled 5/17/04"
"This is one of my favorite beers right now. I can't get enough of them. It pours a cloudy copper color with a thick head that lasts about half way through. Smells of malts, banana, and fruit spices. Tastes incredible. Very flavorful. All smells jump around in your mouth to create a unique flavor, and end with a slight hop bite. Mouthfeel is smooth, somewhat thick. I could drink this everyday!!!"
"This is a top notch beer, no doubt about it. It is quite sweet, but it isn't cloying in any way and remains very easy to drink. This beer has also reminded me that no matter how busy you are, there is always time for beer."
"drinkability: fantastic! I only wish I had a few more of these in the fridge!!! recommended! Cheers!!!"
"This beer poured a dark crimson color with a moderate tan head. The smell seems rather weak to me and all that I could get is some sweet malts. The flavors in this beer also seemed slightly on the weak side but they worked together very well. There's a toasted caramel taste upfront which turns to chocolate the further I go. Some fruity aspects lie underneath along with a hazelnut taste. The wheat is there but not too prevalent. Slight hop bite in the end. The flavors linger. This beer goes down easy and is enjoyable but nowhere as good as their original hefe."
"Drinkability is fantastic, but this beer goes down like a rare treat not meant to be guzzled en masse."
"When I first saw the tap handle, I thought it must be a dream. Poured a deep, tawny brown with a nice familiar opaqueness. There was a nice, dense off-white head, which receded leaving minimal traces of lacing. Aroma is dominated by sweetness and accompanied by a pleasant yeast smell. Taste is also sweet, with the malts being the dominant one in this complex relationship. There is a light citrus in the flavor and a perfectly placed crispness from the carbonation. The mouthfeel is medium and incredibly smooth. I don't usually drink wheat beers in session, but this one would be the one I would choose. One of the strongest features is that this beer is very smooth and easy to drink which makes it perfect for people testing the waters of better beer. It also has enough character to please the veteran beer advocates."
"This brew is a dark brown, cloudy brew, with a off-white head comprised of tiny bubbles. Good hefe scent, cloves, bananas, wheat, but not as intense as i was expecting. The tastes starts off with a hint of caramel malts, and has some excellent hefe characteristics. Wheat, naners, cloves, all that good stuff. A little spritzy on the tounge. Very refreshing after 8 hours of mowing lawns."
"Murky reddish golden appearance is only slightly darker than the regular Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. The head is appropriately tall and foamy, and carbonation level is high as is should be. This beer is much less aromatic than its paler brother, with a lot more wheat bread on the nose than cloves or bananas. The taste is also quite malty, with only a mild level of sweet fruitiness, but a bit of a spicy bite and lemony tanginess. The mouthfeel is light and feels a bit watered down. A good Hefeweizen for the people who prefer their iced tea unsweet rather than sweet."
"I chose to rate this beer using the customary senses. Still, if I could employ a six sense, I might grant this one a higher score. It drinks like a refreshing tonic and may have appeal to some who are well content with modest tastes in a German beer."
"This is a beer that can be sipped or gulped--I prefer somewhere in between. This can be a great after dinner beer or a great summer beer."
"This is an excellent dark wheat beer. It is one of the best around."
"One of the most drinkable beers I've had in a while. The same spicy, fruity notes as their Hefe, but with a nice round malt base. A nice cocoa taste complimenting the lemon and clove. Mouthfeel is perfect with a prickly carbonation and peppery flavor. No matter how many Dark Hefes I try I can never get over the contrast of the murky look and crisp flavor."
"The beer pours a hazy dark amber color with a thick off-white head that eventually fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has the nice fruity banana smell of a regular hefe, but with a little more of a malty scent. The taste is good. It is a malty hefe with excellent wheat/yeast flavor. It is sweet and finishes dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good dunkel, but I've had better; mouthfeel was lacking."
"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel was served from a half liter bottle. In a hefe glass, the beer was a murky fresh cider-like orange brown, and was topped by a collosal and rocky off white head that wouldn't quit. The nose was quite nice and well-developed, consisting of a banana spice bread maltiness accented with clove and estery notes of dried apple and pear. The flavors resembled the nose closely, with a pear tinged doughy clove maltiness that builds in intesity and tartness towards the nicely bittered and powerful estery finish. The body seemed just a tad watery, but in other respects was appropriate. I found this beer to be quite drinkable, due to its deliciousness and lighter body feel. A very enjoyable, ester-laden dunkelweizen that satisfies."
"man what a beer! a dark wheat at it's best, i really enjoyed this one. completely unique flavor done extremely well. kudos."
"Cloudy, deep amber, copper, reddish hue? A bit cloudy, some yeasty sediments present towards the bottom of the glass. Slightly toasty nose, yeast, some apple pie and malts as well. Up front, a mild based malt body is clearly evident, some cloves and lemon notes. Evenly balanced and a bit dry, some cloves and vanilla beans noticed on the tongue. Tarty, twangy, yet very crisp and clean, ever so refreshing, some fruitiness towards the finish, perhaps grapes, plums, apples noted in the body as the glass is drained. Full flavored, rich, creamy, are you kidding me? Absolutely world class, one of the best dark wheats you can get your hands on."
"A fantastic wheat beer from Weihenstephan. The mix of the malt and wheat makes for a simply fantastic experience, and this is a beer I'll certainly have again."
"Poured a cloudy amber or slightly darker shade. Nice creamy, fluffy head of white. Smells faintly of that typical weizen beer, bannanas and cloves. Tastes of slightly carmel malt with the hint of bannana. Not too thin. Very drinkable indeed. I will certainly need to investigate this style more. Refreshing."
"This hefeweissbier was a dark cloudy amber color capped with a good head. The lace was fairly decent. The aroma was complex- very metallic and spicey (clovey) with hints of banana apearing as it warmed. The taste was complex as well -spicey (clove) and citrusy with some caramel and sweetness. Mouthfeel was sharp and bitter. The finish was dry and clovey. I've never really cared for wheat beers, but I keep tasting them and this was the first German one that I've appreciated."
"This is one of the better dark Hefe's I've tried. It pours a cloudy orange-brown with a wispy white head. The aroma is very pleasant with some estery, yeasty twang, some bubblegum and a lot of cloves. The banana smell is very light and typically light banana / heavy cloves means a wheat brew was fermented on the cooler end of the yeast's range. The taste is a nice blend of light bubblegum and clove with a bit of caramel and bready malt. The malt is fuller and more pronounced in this hefe than in a lot of others I've tried putting this on the heavier end of the spectrum for hefe's, even dunkel hefe's. Not malty by O-fest or Bock standards, just malty for a hefe. Crisp, bubbly mouthfeel...prototypical for a hefe."
"Overall Impression: Crisp apple is the primary flavor. It’s dark in color, light in body, refreshingly spry in taste. It has a long tart lasting aftertaste that I enjoyed. Not as nice as the straight Weihenstephaner HefeWeissbier in my opinion, but a quality beer that should be sampled. Seek and find!"
"John"
"Beer is not quite as good as the normal Hefe but excellent nonetheless"
"This beer pours a brown color with a nice, thick head and it leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is that of malts, with some fruit and caramel as well. The flavor wasn't very enjoyable, in my opinion. There was something slightly skunky about it - which I've found rare in darker beers. The flavor was a mixture of the malts and the caramel, but I didn't find much of the fruit that was in the aroma. Again, not a terrible beer, but I didn't care much for it."
"1 pint bottle. Poured a hazy, dirty brown witha massive head that really stuck around and lots of nice lacing on the glass. Aroma typical of Weihenstephaner yeast. Cloves, bananas, spice. Taste is more of the same notes, throughly enjoyable. This beer reminds me why Hefe's are my favorite beers. I could drink this and never get tired of it. Smooth and yeasty!"
"This is just a lovely example of the style by any measure. Brewed in the oldest brewery in the world just outside of Munich, this Bavarian import brings all the authentic Dunkel Weizen flavors right to your living room. The aroma is so dead-on for the style that they ought to have a picture of it on the BJCP style guide page. It is easily the most authentic Dunkles that Ive had here in the US, and rivals most that I enjoyed in Germany."
"Appearance: Chestnut brown ruby effervescent offwhite chunky head leaves huge collar of lacing nice appearance big yeasty dregs pour out of my bottle it's nice. Aroma: I'm getting an array of fruit tones, green apples, raisins, and soft banana tones with a slight citrus hint to it all leaves me with spices and clove with some Hallertau in the finish giving it an herbal quality. Taste: Soft chocolate hints blended with banana clove yeast notes and other spices once again the plethora of fruit shines light upon my palate nice. Mouthfeel: Spritzy and bubbly but not overcarbonated medium to light in body this is a magnificant dunkel hefe. Drinkability: Unparalled for the style simply put just enjoy it's worth it."
"The Hefewezien by these guys rules as one of my favorite beers. The dark follows strongly and is highly recommended!"
"Wow, blew my socks off from first sip to last glup! This fantastic hefeWeissbier was a dark, thick and creamy with loads of spices and wheat. Spices like, cloves, nutmeg and list goes on. The finish had a pleasant after taste that was absolutly outstanding in my mind. This Dark Hefeweissbier I would rate on the same scale as my favorite doppelbock, ""Adventinus""."
"Hazy, orangey bronze color with a nice thicket of beige-colored head in the weizen glass. Aromas of dark malt (especially wheat malt, luscious), some cloviness and yeastiness and throw in a bit of mustiness like a drawer that hasn't been opened in a couple years and is layered with a bit of dust over it's sitting. Very clean smelling. Taste is a little refined, too. A bit malty sweet, yet retaining a classic dunkelweiss style. Smooth and flavorful. Drinkability's good, a 5.3% ABV doesn't hurt that one at all. Effervescent and smooth, perhaps an underappreciated brewery with a rich heritage that brews quality beer."
"Drinkability was off the chart. I quickly polished off the first glass and ordered up a second which I savored at a less greedy rate. I just couldnt help it with the first glass - it was just so damn good. This dunkel wiess is a stellar offering from Brauerei Weihenstephan, to go with their superb hefeweizen."
"considering the prices you can get weihenstephaners here in aus, you really cannot do any better for the dollars. this beer, and several of their others can proudly claim, and with plenty of justification, to be among the worlds best beers. if they laid that concept on me id agree wholeheartedly. a must buy."
"Zum wohl!"
"Dee- licious! I thought I had already reviewed this one. A local store owner gave me a nice Weihenstephan glass, so I bought a dunkel for the occasion. What a tasty beer. Reminds me a lot of Aventinus, without the extra kick. Banana flavor stands out, some clove spice - but not too much. Pours a huge, foamy head with good retention. Nice full mouthfeel. Refreshing and crisp. This will be a regular for me. Great brewery, great beer."
"Pours the colour of cola- with a nice fluffy tan head that lingers around like shaving cream. The scent if redolant with weak cocoa and banana bread smells. The taste is as it smells with the addition of the nice spicy clove like finish found in hefe's. Mouthfeel is pleasant and smooth. A very drinkable beer on a nice mild summers day. Would go really good with some sauerbraten with red cabbage and potatoes"
"Cocoa-colored deep brown appearance, hazy, and a puffy tan head of good lasting power. Nice and simple, but complete, lace. Malty aroma, slight chocolate and an attractive ester balance. Very nice mouthfeel, creamy and pudding-like with a sweet chocolate malt impression with just a hinty of fleshy fruit. The aroma that ""damps"" some Dunkelweiss brews is more complimentary here. Yeast appears slose to the finish, giving added texture and more fruit. Not a favorite style, but among the best in style in my opinion."
"This was my first ever of the style. And, as this is probably my favorite regular Hefe, I could not wait to try this. I was intrigued from the start with the beers typical fluffy white head that was accompanied by a nice nut brown color. The lacing was ample and remained throughout. The aromatics favored the malty side, more so that the regular. The mouthfeel was both creamy and cleansing-which is what I like about the regular hefe! In the mouth I found this beer very similar to the regular hefe, yet with a punch of heath bar toffee. Some banana and clove chimed in as well, yet more subdued than the regular. On the finish a rich maltiness prevails. The beer is nicely refreshing and offers rich malty, grainy, bready flavors on the finish. A spectacular selection to try on tap at an Octoberfest with your favorite sausage or German snack of choosing."
"Pours to a frothy, gassy, explosive head that leaps out of the glass and all over the table. Cloudy brown-amber color. Aroma is comprised of alcohol, phenolic yeast and sharp wheat malt. Flavor is crisp, tart and yeasty with noticable clove and banana intermingled with warm alcohol. Finishes dry and refreshing. A very good dunkel-weissbier."
"This dunkel weissbier poured a cloudy, brown color with creamy, light tan foam. The smell was mild and malty with a slight sweetness and faint fruitiness. The taste was slightly sweet and malty with notes of wheat and yeast. Very little fruity ester flavors. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with medium body and low carbonation. Very low hop presence. A nicely enjoyable weiss bier."
"Smelled of bananas foster, as big banana scents mix with alcohol and roasty sugar/syrup notes. Also had a strange cleaning fluid smell that many dunkels have. Taste was sweet, of bananas and yogurt (in that both are sweet and slightly lactic sour), a spot roasty in the middle, and creamy at the end. The sour flavor cleared my palette, keeping my tongue fresh, which was nice. Tasted very fresh, active, and complex. Highly drinkable, a perfect mouthfeel, outstanding given it’s a style that I don’t care for."
"This is an awesome beer....maybe the best wheat beer I have ever tried to date..I will seek this out and buy many more..."
"Overall, a good dunkel hefeweizen."
"This is swank beer. Not up to Aventinus standards, but damn near close (yes I realize they are different styles). Just a tad darker than Schneider Weiss -- cloudy tarnished copper. Big meringue head, the kind where bubble pop and a leave a permanent pit. The aroma, in addition to some of the typical aromas had this aroma I associate with stilton cheese. It's not a cheesiness, but that aroma that I can't really describe but think of as a smokey earthiness. Great hefe flavors, a bit milder than I prefer (I'm a Schneider Weiss aficionado) but this is made up by the darker malt flavors. A bit like caramel and bananas. Great, elegant beer."
"I can't believe I'm giving this beer relatively low marks, since the other beers I've had from the brewery have been very good. Perhaps I expected too much. Poured a hazy ice tea brown. Not a lot of aroma. Mild banana yeast esthers jumped up at the front, but then surrendered to nondescript sweet yeast flavors. Did not detect a lot of wheat malt, which was surprising for a dark wheat."
"Murky, multi-shaded brown/dark amber with a massive, three fingers worth of off-white head. Excellent retention. Minimal lace. Almost perfect Hefeweizen nose (spicy, yeasty, clove) then sprinkle in hints of caramel malt what an invitation! The potency is a touch light, oh well. Very tasty palate, well balanced with pepper, clove, and spice upfront yeastiness and apples (briefly) in the middle the end is softly caramel, distant maltiness the aftertaste is softly peppery and provoking carbonation that tickles your tongue loiters on the dry side, rather clean. Medium body. Exceedingly drinkable! This is a great dark wheat ale, my high expectations were easily met if you see the name Weihenstephaner on the label, buy it! As for this one, recommended."
"An initially large off-white head that almost overflowed the glass with moslty fine bubbles. This wheat beer was not one of my favorite, but more or less middle of the road for me. There was no strong after taste, but the taste did linger for a long time."
"Taste is a nice mellow lemon flavor, easy tartness, balanced nicely with darker malts and wheat, a bit of breadish dryness, touch of banana and spice in there, smooth the entire gulp. Nice open and mellow medium body feel, mostly midway action then thins out nicely in the finish leading it to be drinkable beyond comprehension. One excellent, fine beer to drink any Ol' time, but favors the warmth of summer."
"Wow! What a beer! It offers all of the flavors and aromas of the standard Weihenstephaner weizen with the addition of a light caramel note. It pours a cloudy, tawny brown body with a full head of creamy off-white foam. Soft banana, light clove-like spice, light brown sugar and apples appear in the nose. The body is medium and it appears initially crisp and then creamy across the palate due to its very fine and effervescent natural carbonation. Gentle spice appears first in the flavor; followed by a soft maltiness that's just slightly tangy and backed by gentle fruitiness (bananas, apples). It's very well-balanced by an underlying bitterness, and it finishes with a lingering note of nutty malt and some drying clove-like yeastiness. Refreshing but full of flavor. Exceptional!"
"i love the hefe-weissebier, figured this would be good too. pours a beautiul dark amber color with a nice medium white head. reduces a bit, but a nice small head stays and laces the glass nicely throughout the drinking session. smells of wheat, clove and a bit of spice, and pretty much tastes the same. not quite as ""wheaty"" as the normal hefe, but is a little heavier and fruitier tasting, reminds be of a mix between the hefe and the korbinian? i dont know. finishes a bit dry and the mouthfeel is great. good carbonation that just feels great on the toungue. this stuff is great."
"It's muddy brown and lighter brown on the edges. The head is huge and laces well. The aroma is a direct early look into the flavors; of which include banana, chocolate, yeast, lemon, clove, spice, toasted malt.....very awesome and refreshing brew with crisp carbonation. It's kind of like a mellow chocolate covered banana with lemon zest to boot. Awesome stuff."
"German wheat beer is probably my favorite style if I absolutely had to choose one and Weihenstephaner is one of the great breweries of germany. That said, I find this dark wheat to be exceptional in flavor and quality. Beautiful dark brown with standard huge wheat head of froth. Smell is sweet and malty with a definite yeast presence. Full of wheat flavor that is sweet and malty. Full bodied and ultra smooth on the palate."
"I have been looking for a good beer in this style striking out a few times but I hit the jackpot with this one.Poured a rich brown/copper color with big blooming head.Smelled of caramel and toffee with come faint smokiness to it as well.Pretty nutty flavor with some fresh tartness in there,pretty complex and rewarding.Should have known this was the brewer who would get this beer right."
"Ah, summer's around the corner and the hefe weizens will be pouring on out of the breweries. Here's a bottle of one of the best, this one's a slightly tan color ( not as dark as most dunkelweizens) with the traditional big hefe foam. The aroma is huge! Lots of clove,banana cream, a hint of chocolate and spices. The flavor is malty and sweet with bubblegum,clove,more banana cream with a little yeast tangyyness on the tongue. It is lighter body with lots of carbonation at first with a creaminess as it settles. I like the flavor but the darker grains don't show themselves well in this one like others of this ilk. It is a very refreshing beer that's getting my groove on for the warmer months ahead."
"This beer pours a rich, creamy, bronze color with a rather large white head. During the pour, yeast is seen diving from the bottle and splashing gleefully into the glass, which makes me pause and reminisce about my last batch of homebrew which unfortunately is no longer with us. The aroma is a fruity caramel scent which is quite pleasing to the nasal passages. The taste is pretty sweet with almost a caramel taste to it. While it wasn't exactly love at first taste with this beer, by the time the bottle was finished, we had warmed to each other quite nicely. Now I'm looking forward to seeing her again."
"Pours the brown color of a deep, brown wood stain with a surprisingly white, rocky head. The taste is a standout on this beer. Reminds me of some sort of citrus-inspired yule log -- that is, lemon and caramel-chocolate intermingle. A perfect play of the wheat with a sweeter, fruity malt flavor. Just a great-tasting brew."
"Pours a hazy brown/copper color with a huge rocky head. Head retention is great, it lasts until the last drop. The aroma is full of malted goodness mixed with a hint of cocoa and toffee. The taste is an exceptional medley of malt, hops, vanilla, and bananas. This is a great medium bodied beer from the folks at Weihenstephaner."
"My favorite style beer from my favorite brewery. Great flavor, great color.A slightly stronger taste than an average Weiss beer, and the typically rich Wiehenstephaner quality.Anyone who likes Weiss beers would love this beer, and I suggest that they try it as soon as they can get their hands on this semi hard to find beer."
"Firm, yet soft medium body. And a dunkel drinkability that has not been surpassed in my experience."
"Clear brew (until the yeast is poured in), medium-amber in color forming a peaking, meringue-like off-white head atop medium-large bubbles with strong carbonation, and very active spiral streamers. The head remains at least 1/2"" thick until the bottom of the glass. Lacing is good. Aroma is rich with phenolic bananas and clove, peppery alcohol, and lightly husky amber malts. Mouthfeel is bright, yet remarkably smooth in finish despite the high carbonation, with a light body. Taste starts out with spritzy bananas and wheat malt, some very subtle soft hops, fading into a slight metallic note, and ending in a wet, lightly astringent, lightly grainy amber malt profile with just enough hop bitterness to balance it. Very easy to drink."
"Pours like most good dunkel weissbier, dark in color with fine beads of carbonation. A towering off white head is at the top of this beer. Aroma is of most beer of this type, cloves, banana, citrus and yeast. Taste is a bit malted but the natural flavors emerge. A bit dry in the finish but very drinkable. A good beer!"
"An impressively foamy, bilious head tops a beer with a dark brown, almost pruney, or figgy hue. Aroma is lively and satisfying: citrus, notes of vanilla, banana, cloves, rich, deep, dark. Reminds me of Belgian abbey dubbels, a favorite. Taste is sharp, dry, with a hasty finish, that leaves you yearning for more. A very sociable beer: not too difficult to drink, and not in the least forgettable. Slight bitterness, medium body, and as for flavor, I feel like it's close to a lighter version of a barleywine, crazy as that sounds."
"Absolutely world-class. If you're curious what wheat beers are 'really' supposed to taste like, this and it's lighter brother are German Wheat Bier 101. Take a seat, 'cause class is in session!"
"Hefie dark: Not really one of my favorite styles, but this remains a very fine beer. It pours a cloudy brown, with a huge head that is as tall as it is smooth. This beer has sort of a lemony aroma. The taste is very nice, a very malty hefe style, with the traditional yeast flavors being muted and very much in the background. A good version of the style."
"This brew (along with everything from this brewery) is just another example of what excellent beer is all about. Nice chocolatey-looking color as you would expect from a dark weiss beer and the taste is nothing short of outstanding. Very smooth, not at all harsh or ""too strong"" even for those not accustomed to this type of beer. Generally, I prefer Hefe-weizens to their darker cousins but this is an outstanding exception as this ranks as one of my all time favorites."
"This is truly a wonderful example of this style and but one of a number of great products from this brewery outside of Freising."

"On the pour, a clear deep amber color, impressive head, creamy in consistency, lace in fine sheets to coat the glass. Malt nose, clean, fresh, crisp, the front semi-sweet, top skimpy, the finish has a pleasing carbonation, daintily hopped, droughty aftertaste. The whole Weihenstephaner line of beers are quite quaffable, and well worth the time and effort to sample."
"Cloudy and amber in appearance.  This beer has a sour, somewhat nutty aroma.  Very spicy in the mouth -- cloves and a subtle hint of cinnamon seem present.  Smooth, with a full-seeming body.  Quite tasty."
"Sewage brown with a tall, brash sandstone-colored head that recedes quickly. Strong aromas of banana bread and banana muffins, complete with walnuts, clove and cinnamon. Dry. Some fresh tartness gives the flavors lift and clarity. Creamy, cOOl, velvety richness that plays light as a feather on the tonsils..."
"Burnt caramel apple color with enormous head. Nice yeasties dumped into the glass making it hazy and tempting. This is a luscious brew, creamy and refreshing in the tradition of the best Bavarian wheats, and roasty and nutty like a good dunkel. Hints of banana, apples, slight medicinal quality in aroma. Quite tangy and sharp on the tongue. I love dunkelweisses but I'd say Weihenstephaner's best brew is the hefe, which is a notch above this, and in the dunkel category overall my nod goes to Ayinger's superior Ur-Weisse. It's good to have choices though. This beer seems a little subdued so I wonder if my palate is off today. Regardless, it's excellent."
"Pours with a towering, long lasting head.  Medium-dark, hazy brown color.  Slightly spicy aroma.  Very mild esters and phenols.  Soft, smooth, malty sweetness:  very subtle beer.  Medium body.  Very nice."
"The color of this beer is a nice blend of scarlet red, amber and orange.  A little murky.  Nice creamy two finger off-white head tops it off.  Aroma seems to indicate a fairly high phenolic content.  There are also some spicy, peppery tones present on the nose.  The mouthfeel is on the high end of the spectrum in regards to carbonation.  Body is medium to full.  I get some banana esters on the tongue as well as mild (to my surprise) phenolic content and peppery spice accents.  Some slight roasted overatures are noted also.  Not bad.  Pretty decent dunkel weizen here."
"An excellent dunkel, slight sweetness to it, chocolate and banana flavours, slight bitter finish, a bit of saltyness in there aswell, not as good as their regulare weissbier though, but highly enjoyable."

"Pours a rich creamy deep brown color. Super fluffy marshmellow sweet tannish head. Very balanced banana, toffee malt sweet smell. Taste was unbelievable. Balanced sublte hops, followed by sweet malty body of bananas, cloves, hints of vanilla, and crisp delicious wheat and malty sweet finish. Make sure you swill the bottom of the bottle to get all the yeasty goodness out. Medium to thick bodied, great finish, malty sweetness throughout. Very delicious by itself or with a meal."
"The murky, tawny, effervescent, dark bronze hued brew is topped by a formidably dense and mountainous head that deserves respect. After an eternity, the head settles and allows access to the liquid.  Light toasted malt, smooth chocolate notes and mellow banana w/ clean wheat tartness round out the aroma. Banana esters are prominent in flavor while clove is subdued and when combined with the rich, vanilla - like and slightly sweet malt backbone the overall flavor is very enjoyable. Medium in body, w/ a slick, proteinaceous and agreeable mouthfeel typical to good German wheats.  Hop bitterness only serves the purpose of preventing overbearing sweetness, but does its job well.  Finishes w/ a hint of caramel malt sweetness upfront, followed by grainy tartness and lingering but mellow hop bittermess.  This beer exhibits tremendous balance and drinkability.  It's among the best Dunkelweizens I've had thus far."
"Ummm, dunkel. A caramel brandy sauce covered apple baked in cinnamon and clove with fried plantains sits on your fork. As you place a tasty morsel in your slavering mouth some mutant hop freak gives you a bitter slap to quell the sweetness. Weihenstephaner sets the standard for Bavarian wheat beer brewers. All the characteristics of their awesome hefe with an addition of sweet malts. Seems on the verge of weizenbock the flavors are so powerful in this brew. A must try for all hefe lovers!"
"Notes: By far one of the greatest dark wheat beers available in the US market to date, very soft on the palate … no harshness at all. Malt flavour is near perfection with all the other flavours kept as a backdrop to let the malt be dominant."
"So far this is my favorite Dunkel Weiss. Slight friuty ester, didn't get too much phenols. Nice wheat sourness without being over done. All and all very tasty."
