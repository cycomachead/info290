No head on the beer when it arrived, dark copper color without much in the way of bubbles. I was surprised off the bat by how sweet the beer was. Not overtly or cloyingly, but enough to seem out-of-place. Once my tongue adjusted to that, I found a medicinal, slightly metallic, flavor waiting for me which would last through the next 3/4 of the glass until I finally gave up on it. Felt a bit undercarbonated, and had an unpleasant aftertaste. It's possible this beer wasn't getting a fair presentation; I'd be pretty surprised if this bar does proper draft line maintenance; but I don't see myself rushing out to give this beer another try elsewhere.","kscaldef","Jul 16, 2011"

Thanks to the use of that Bavarian weissbier yeast strain, Winged Nut gives off wonderfully sweet banana esters. Behind the yeasty aromas you're also greeted by the light and dry pop of the finely milled chestnuts the beer is brewed with. The beer tastes similar to the way it smells - a wonderful balance between the sweet yeast notes, some rich Munich malts, and the dry chestnuts on the finish of the beer. A lot of nut beers are one and done, but UCBC finds a way to make it a session beer.","jmvecchio1","Jun 28, 2011"
