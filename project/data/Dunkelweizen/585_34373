3.67,-1.3,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Had a pint on tap at an Edmonton, Alberta area pub (Spruce Grove to be specific). After being pleasantly surprised by this brewery's weissbier offering (see that review), I had fairly high expectations for this one. Certainly this was technically proficient and nothing was obviously wrong, a brown-red wood color with ample fizz and an inch or so of beige quick-breaking head. Aroma features the expected banana and clove elements along with some caramel and faint chocolate. Body is much like that of a lighter macro-brewed weiss, on the thin side and featuring an apple-like fruity ""young beer"" flavor along with some brown sugar, raisin and clove. Banana is low level, at least to my palate. A little sour and quite crisp. Not as complex as its lighter stablemate but pleasant enough I suppose. I have enjoyed less fruity and more malty examples of the style but makes a decent enough patio brew when in the mood for something a touch darker. Not particularly sweet and maybe a little bland. Was hoping for something more robust.","CalgaryFMC","May 26, 2014"

3.98,7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Comes out of the tap a dark, nearly opaque chocolaty brown with a fine-bubbled light tan head. Tempting malty aroma has hints of chocolate and caramel. Flavor - such flavor! Malty mainly, plus caramel, horehound, earthy and yeasty notes. Texture is fairly smooth with a sharp yeasty undertone and hints of fruit, not a lot of fizz. Definitely worthy of at least a sample.","Cyberkedi","Apr 02, 2012"

4.2,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O- This is a fine beer, and this might be the one to get me really into Dunkels! It's definitely easy enough to drink, and the flavor, along with the mouthfeel, gives this enough character to make me want to have more than one of these in a sitting. This beer would go well with a roast beef dinner or perhaps with a chocolate cake for dessert. Thumbs up!","ChrisCage","Jan 23, 2012"

4.05,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"A deftly easy to drink dark wheat beer, enjoyably straight forward, but hardly plain.

4.18,12.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Flavour is on the clovey side with slight banana noted that linger. Light carbonation and high drinkability make this a winner as fair as I'm concerned. I like the balance in this. One of the nicer Dunkelweizens I've tried.","rjimlad","May 26, 2009"
3.64,-2.2,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours dark copper with a small (for a weizen) head. Nose shows bready wheat, milk chocolate, banana, and oatmeal. Very nice.

3.93,5.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"I truly love this style, possibly more than the regular hefeweizen. A solid example that falls short of the benchmark (Weihenstephan) but is still a very good beer that I thoroughly enjoyed drinking.","LittleCreature","Oct 27, 2008"
3.75,0.8,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"OVERALL: Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Certainly a dunkel I could drink all day.

3.65,-1.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"M&D: the fluffy mouthfeel upfront leads towards a medium-bodied mid-taste, although the finishing touch is a little more spritzy than necessary. All in all, this dunkel weizen is very decent in quality, showing a balanced profile b/w fruit-esters and wheat+malts. Although this is not my favourite type of ale, I won't hesitate tasting it again (but preferably on draught!).","wl0307","Aug 23, 2007"

3.58,-3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Body is medium and the beer is slightly sweet. Aftertaste is dry and drinkability is OK. To me this tastes like the normal Weisse, but with the dark malt pushing away the fruity notes, the Weisse has.","Absumaster","0"
3.36,-9.7,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured a tall, dense, foamy light brown head was so solid it looked like I could scoop it out like ice cream. Deep cola colored beer with a hazy chestnut hue. Moderately strong aroma is dominated by banana and bubble gum esters. Mouthfeel is light a fluffy. Not a whole lot of flavor up front except for a faint astringency. Mild banana yeast flavors and some cocoa mix towards the finish. The aroma hinted at some nice flavors, but they never materialized. A tad watery and boring. Nothing wrong per se, but there are better Dunkels.","HappyHourHero","0"
