"-- Classic aroma, if nothing more. Thin, over-carbed, and I’m missing all those fruity esters. Almost a weizen with food colouring, and even then not a great one. A sub-par example of the style. 3.5"

"Served from 2 yr old bottle into hefe glass. I was anticipating some clumping of yeast due to being in cellar, but was fine. Pours a nice reddish brown with plenty carbonation and nice creamy head. Smell of fruitiness with banana. Tastes much like smell with some malt insets and other fruit. Fruitiness with malty biscuit following and a slight happiness bite on back end. Comes together very well with smooth feel. A very good dunkle hefe. A favorite for sure."

"A solid, tasty dunkelweizen, well balanced."

"Bready, yeasty, creamy and delicious, my only complaint is the banana flavor is a bit muted."

"O- It is worth trying if you are a weizen fan. I will likely have this one again."

"Overall - disappointing. The krystalweizen was the big winner between the three Tucher's tonight, and it wasn't even close. It's good, but nowhere close to great, and I probably wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
""
"O: very drinkable; not too much clove or banana."
"Overall, this is pretty average for the style. It's a nice, affordable quaff for sure, though."
"Solid dunkleweizen, and another warm day refresher."
"Overall, a fairly hefe heavy dunkel weizen. The malt character is pretty much overshadowed by the wheat, citrus, and spice characteristics."

"This is a beer with great appearence, pours a nice brown dark honey color. head is big creamy beige in color with low retention. lacing is medium. carbonation high. It has some sediment at the bottom og the glass. It is a nice thirst quencher with dry taste."
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 1 inch puffy light beige head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Random chunks of lace stick to the glass on the drink down. Some sketchy looking chunks of sediment sink to the bottom of the glass after the pour. Smell is of dark wheat, burnt caramel, and some off metallic notes. Taste is the same with some subtle banana flavors on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average dunkelweizen with some weird stuff going on."

"for a dark hefe it is pretty good... ive had better of course but id definately drink this again... looing forward to try another one os Tucher Brews!!"

"Generally slightly above average. Very bready with less emphasis on the esters and phenols. A little plain. Not really what I'm looking for in a dunkelweiss, but I could see how some prefer this."
""
""
"Nice presentation in my stemmed pint tulip. Bold hazy brown with lots of stuff floating around. Rocky head with nice lacing. Like a meal in a beer. Smell is good and fruity and a bit malty. Tastes great but not less filling. Wheaty sweet and a little fruity like a peach marmalade on wheat toast. Mouthfeel is great a medium bodied jefe. Overall an excellent beer and well worth looking for again, also, sessionable if you don'tind the caloric value. Cheers. Btw I poured most of it in the glass and then rolled the last ounce or two around the bottom to loosen up the yeast for the final pour. Didn't want to waste the bonus on the bottom. Another great Tucher."
""
"M: nice mouthfeel, it is simple but nice not to bitter nor too sweet."
"T: the same way as the smell, very refreshing, medium body, chewy and long lasting end"
"D: This one is a little bit on the heavy side for the summer, but I think this might be preferable during the colder months of the year."
"Overall Drinkability - Worst I've had in style. Flavorless. Bodyless. The high point is the appearance. Not a bad beer, just horrible in style. If BMC made a Hefe-lite, this would be it."
"Delicious and enjoyable. Easy drinking."
"It is a decent Franconian Dunkelweizen, but not amazing."
"EDIT: Had to go back and rethink my scores after this beer warmed SO nicely. I thought it was good to begin with, but after it's finished, I think it's excellent"
"O: This is a solid brew but it shows more characteristics with a Begian Dubbel than a Dunkel because the yeast is a bit under-played."
"The body is on the light side of medium, which seems proper. It's not quite as crisp as a great hefe but enough, with enough of a smoothness to the body to make for pleasant drinking. It gets pretty filling without quite going too far."
"Body is light + and carbonation is active and a tough rough. A bit gassy. Overall the least favorite of the Tucher brews that I've tried."
"Drinks pretty easy. I was expecting more from this one, given how good the Kristall was the other night..."
"Luckily the amount of sediment and hairy appearance don't affect drinkability or flavor, otherwise this beer would've been a lost cause."
"Head city, frothy, light brown, lasts for days. Even lace, but little cling. Color is a 31 on the SRM chart. Very fragrant, smells of banana, cloves, wheat, citrus, lots of malt, and vanilla. Tastes that I recognize are banana, wheat, clove, rye, chocolate, malt, and a little pepper. Plenty of body here for my mouth, good carbonation and creaminess. Great flavor and body, a good beer to drink again."
"Poured this beer out into my wheat glass out of a 500ml bottle. Poured out with a silky creamy white head. The body of the beer is a deep mahogany with less carbonation then the other Tucher wheats. Smells like bananas and grain. Tastes like bana bread with a more hoppy feel. Very bready and grassy as well. There is more barley in this. Mouthfeel is medium with a dry hop kick back and and tingly carbonation feel. This is drinkable and I can sit down in a pub and slow drink a few."
"pretty decent for being a dark wheat beer. the carbonation might drop it down a little, but perhaps its because I didn't use a weizen glass."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass. Got a brown color like you would find from a Newcastle. There was a head that dissapated very quickly to a thin white lace at the top. The smell was a bit fruity with the usual scents from a hefe. The taste had a bit of a bite and a little bit too much carbonation for me. All in all a good brew that should be enjoyed on a hot day. Enjoy!"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down quickly. I could easily have several of these in one sitting."
"Drinkability was pretty low as having this brew didn't leave me wanting another at all."
"Impressions: Definitely good, although I think some additional hoppiness could have balanced it nicely."
"D – Excellent, so enjoyable and richly flavorful. Also very complementary to certain foods"
"Drinkability is much better than I anticipated, good change of pace for wheat beer lovers, try it in the colder months as a dark beer alternative."
"MF&D - A light lighter/watery, but still overall a fine beer. I would buy this again."
"This is a drinkable Dunkel but a bit too much on the light side for the style."
"Goes down very smooth and very easy."
"OVERALL: Pretty good dunkelweizen. Palate was average at best, but the rest was a good experience. Certainly a more impressive and memorable brew than their helles hefeweizen. Pick this one up if you happen to find it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Gassy and belly-filling, the texture is this beer's Achilles heel. With just a gentle swish, it becomes overbearing and quickly forces the mouth to contain all that it holds. As this feature alone plays such a key factor in enjoying this beer, it is average at best overall for me."
"D - This dunkel lends itself well to the drinkability category. A good session dunkel."
"Disappointing, although not undrinkable. I did all the right things--swirled the yeast at bottom, let it warm up for 20 minutes from the fridge, served in an authentic German hefeweizen glass. Guess this one simply isn't a mindblowing dunkelweizen. It happens."
"drinkability- it was enjoyable to drink with a nice taste."
"Easy drink, good for the 100f weather which i am sitting in now."
"Whatever, cheap beer and better than the 9 dollar pabst at the new yankee stadium. Fluffernutter."
"One of my favorite styles, and while not the best, certainly a really good beer. I would not hesitate to buy it again."
"M + D: There's a little size to the body, with an evenly balanced carbonation, followed with a nice and smooth finish. It's not an incredibly 'intense' brew, and I don't think that's the point of it at all. Easy drinking brew for an easy going night."
"Mid sized bottle, pours plummy brown under a huge frothy khaki head, that stays and stays. Light chocolate and fruit in the nose. I get some more chocolate, bananas, light powdered sugar, light toast and some maple. The problem I have here is that this one is on the watery side, compared to the all stars of the style. Decent enough take on a tasty style, just thin body and flavor wise"
"This beer pours a earthy carmel color with a cloudy/hazy touch. Good head that went away slowly. No lacing strangely enough, I could've sworn I would have gotten some. Bananas jump right out of the nose of this beer. Also noteable are some other spices, clove in particular, but a very sweet scent. Almost a champagne-y kind of smell- very agreeable. The taste is more bready, banana spice giving way to some nut flavor as the beer got a little warmer. Mouthfeel was light and easy to drink, not much carbonation here. Very drinkable and refreshing, give this one a shot. Its an affordable dunkleweizen. cheers."
"Taste: dark malts, banana, a bit wheaty at the end. Medium-to-thick, bready, creamy and smooth. Very nice."
"D: This is a bit of a mixed bag. Some aspects of this beer were good, but when it comes down to the taste, it was a bit uninteresting. Oddly drinkable, though."
"D- Decent dunkelweizen."
"D: A good dark weizen, not as good as Franzikaner, but a solid beer I could have again, one of the least expensive dunkleweisse beers around."
"Fullish in body with great carbonation, Tucher's Dunkle is a fun and fruity take on the style. Very enjoyable and highly drinkable."
"A pleasant traditional beer. Certainly worth a try. Flavor is balanced and mild."
"A very mild and easy to drink brew, not quite as full flavored or as complex as I would have hoped, but not bad either."
"A good example of the style that make a great sausage pizza pairing."
"A very well done beer by a respectable brewer."
"Overall not bad but cant compete with some of the others of the style."
"Drinkability- I love it. I used to drink tons of this back in the day."
"M/D: High carbonation, as expected, the beer was very smooth and very easy to drink. I could have had another. Overall, an excellent beer and I find it in a beer store I will definately be picking one or more up."
"D'ability - A very easy drinking beer, just not a great dunkel. May simply not be at the peak of freshness, but definitely down the list in my personal Dunkelweizen pecking order."
"This big bottle pours a murky,muddy brown with a tall kakhi head that leaves behind some big lace.The smell is sweet like almond whiped cream if there is such a wonderful thing,some faint spice is also notable.Lightly roasted malts followed by spicy pepper and clove are first to greet the tounge.Nutty flavors emerge mid way,followed by some sweet fruits and a underlying skunk that is almost undetectable.The body is medium to light,with a tangy bite.Nice solid body and still refreshing,a nice rainy day summer brew."
"This is a nice Dunkel, however I think mine may be a little old. It pours a nice dark brown color, but not as much cloudiness as I expected. I did swirl the bottom to get some, but it didn't come up easily, so it has settled a long time. It smells a little of banana, but not enough for the style, and no clove was detected at all. It tasted a bit oxidized, but had some nice wheat and yeast flavor at the end. The aftertaste was dry and slightly acrid. I think the bottle I had was an injustice to the Tucher brand, since I've been to Germany, and I know this would be far better on tap and fresh there. If you can find this fresh, buy it, otherwise don't waste your money--brew your own!"
"Very drinkable and tasty beer for all seasons."
"D: Not a bad brew. Being German, I have a special place in my heart for Tucher. This beer is good but I often don't go past one 500ml in a sitting. Enjoy this beer."
"D - Outstanding, well balanced decently sessionable brew. It's lack of sweetness could make this a very accessible weizen. Definite reco here."
"I have come to the conclusion that I just like dunkels better. Here is a good example. Had it in a pilsner glass chilled. Poured the usual pleasent light brown, hazy color with a decent off white head. Smelled of chocolate, yeast, and hint of banana. Taste was clean and smooth with some yeast in the finish and chocolate, banana, cherries, and a little spiceyness in the front. It's TOO-ker!"
"Body is light and overly carbonated for my liking. Easy to drink and nothing offensive. I actually like the US microbrewed versions of this style I've tried more than this one. The flavors seem to pop a bit more."
"Drinkability: The dunkel hefe weizens are a more robust, full version of the helles hefe weizens and very enjoyable. This bier is best in the fall and winter months where the heaviness and more full taste works vs the helles. Any considering it is 27 degrees here in Chicago, I think I will have another. I haven't had this bier much, but will more often now, a well rounded bier that is very enjoyable to drink."
"D- This is an okay Hefe, defiantly not he best in the category but also not the worst. I might get it again, but would not rush out to buy it."
"M/D: Medium to light bodied, perhaps a little watery, low carbonation and easy drinking. Can't really go wrong with a dunkelweizen."
"Walnut brown body capped by a finger of off-white head of modest duration. Nicely malted, with yeasty overtures and caramel. The taste follows suit, impressing with the caramel and malt, but lacking some complexity. Rather than fruited hints, I'd prefer they were more directly involved in the taste. The modest hop flavor could also use an upgrade. Still, it's good and smooth. I'd like a little more carbonation on this, but the texture atones. It's not hard to knock down a couple of these by any means. Though I certainly prefer the Helles Hefe Weizen, this is a solid, smooth, nice-tasting beer, worth trying and returning to in the future."
"Pours a cloudy dirty brown color with a below average head for a hefe, though it left a nice cap. The smell is quite nice, clove and banana, with a light wheat malt aroma. The taste is quite neutral. It starts off with some light clove and banana flavors which are quickly offset with the malt presence, leaving quite a neutral brew. There is a slightly tart apple skin presence as well. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, finishes neutral. A very easy drinking brew. Could use some more hefe phenol flavor but a nice enjoyable brew."
"D - I think I would get this again good taste and pretty smooth I could drink this all night"
"Drinkability, oh ya, Very easy to drink. Not strong or overpowering, just pretty good for the money."
"An average dunkel. I would definately drink it again. I don't think I could drink many in a sitting because of the fruitiness."
"D- The flavor is a bit light but there are nice toasted notes. The mouthfeel is full but the overall impression was that it is a bit dull."
"D - Poor. For some reason this stuff is just not sitting right with me. It seems all out of whack. I probably won't buy this again, but I may try to buy another bottle to see if freshness was a negative factor with this sample. There is not freshness date, and I've only had the bottle in the 'frige for maybe two weeks."
"Not the most complex or tasty Dunkles hefe Weizen, but it certainly gets the job done and is quite tasty."
"Drinkability: A really great Dunkles Hefe Weizen. Very pleasant complexity and tasty flavors , refreshing and delicious."
"Overall: My sample was a solid dark wheat brew but a bit underwhelming in the taste department. This ones worth revisiting at a future date to see if I got a bad bottle."
"d - wonderful brew as usual from tucher. i'll be going back to the well for this one this summer."
"D - This is a pretty good dunkel. A nice dried fruit flavor mixed with a sweet taste."
"Pours a murky brown color with some amber hues. Aroma is cloves, overripe bananas and yeast. The smell reminds me of banana nut bread. The taste a nice malty flavor with plenty of yeast and a touch of banana. Overall, this is a good brew that I would not mind having again."
"Medium body with a moderately mild ABV, this is a good solid easy drinkin dunkel that's certainly worth a try...it's from Germany, go figure."
"The taste is clean and particularly quenching, even for the style. Firm malt backbone with ample carbonation and tasty, no nonsense finish and aftertaste. This goes down very clean and natural tasting. Very pleasing and drinkable and almost textbook for the style."
"Overall, the aromas and flavors are all in check, but it feels like somebody threw Perrier in my beer! Blech!"
"Overall- A delicious beer!!! Dunkels are so much better than regular Hefe's and this is my new favorite Dunkel!!!"
"Tucher Dunkles Hefe Weizen pours a caramel brown with a huge off white head from a brown one pint, one ounce bottle. The aroma has a hint of cloves, but way toned town from what I expect in a normal (non-dunkel) hefe. It has a smooth mouthfeel. There is a good amount of malt and clove in the taste. Pretty good, definitely worth a try."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into pilsner glass. Good appearance, with a light brown body and thick, off-white head. Good wheaty aroma, and a long, smooth finish. Not a bad wheat beer, especially on a hot summer's night. However, I prefer the Helles to the Dunkel in the Tucher Hefe Weizen line."
"Gulp Gulp,"
"The buttery (diacetyl) compound is unusual in the style, but I link it up to the slight vanilla-like or almond-like taste that can add beneficial complexities. But the diacetyl here interferes with the mouthfeel and brings rise to the light taste of paper and stale breads. This is likely not the most fresh version of the beer. Not knowing the stability of the bottles, I'm not sure about how much of the taste is brewhouse or old product."
"A solid beer. I'm a bigger fan of the style than most, though."
"Drinkability: While this beer is quite good, I think I would prefer it paired with some bold german food: of course, in such a situation, the flavors of the food would dominate and the beer would serve as a tasty means to wash it down."
"The mouth is inviting and brisk. Extremely easy drinker. Well worth searching out!!"
" Clean, refreshing and very drinkable. Well done!"
"Easy to drink however some what of a bland beer, I should try to find a dunkles hef on tap somewhere."
"Just excellent."
"A smooth, lightly carbonated brew, medium bodied with a touch of tangy hops on the tip of the tongue at first sip then it just folds into all the other flavors in the aftertaste. Vey nice, pour me another, please."
"Drinkability is good. Not the best German version I've had but not a dud either."
"This beer poured to a rootbeer looking dark with a large dense billowy head that is off-wight. The smell is like banana oil. When I drink it it's like nothing i've ever tasted before. It's delicious, but it's hard to qualify. Very very slight roasted malt flavor on the back of the tongue. The hops is in perfect balance. The initial taste is, ready for this....rootbeer candy. The wheat yeast starts to become aparent on the front of your tongue as the brew gets warmer; it's funky but not at all unpleasant. Unique, delicious, and so refreshing that in your bones it feels like drinking a lager. If I were to drink this in a cozy bar with good friends, this beer would quickly become galvanized in my memory as associated with happiness. Recommended"
"Very pleasant, but i could tell it wasn't uber fresh. Would love to be able to make it to Germany someday and try one of these on tap close to the brewery."
"Tucher Dunkles Hefe Weizen is a damn good dunkel weizen. It's more than solid across the board and is at least as drinkable as its better known competitors. As late summer gives way to crisp autumn, I'll be sure to purchase a few bottles of this beer along with my favorite Oktoberfests."
"drinkability is very good, a bit different from other dunkel weizens I've tried, definitely worth a try."
"Overall, a bland and disappointing entry, even Franzy Dunkel is better. And that's not saying too much."
"If I found this one on-tap, or found a good price on a six-pack, I might buy it again. I'm not sorry I bought this one as a sampler. But the overall quality of this beer leads me to the opinion that it's probably not as good as I'd like it to be."
"Pours a hazy light amber brown color with a thinning head that never quite goes away. Aroma of strong malts, with some bananas. Taste is pretty good, decent balance between sweet caramel malt, yeast, fruit, and very slight hops. Finish has some sweet malt, bananas, and toasted flavors. Mouthfeel is about average for the style. Good dunkel for the price, but nothing to write home about."
"Overall, an excellent dunkel style beer. I am usually not too big on the style, but I will be purchasing more of this."
"An OK drinkable brew. I expected more maltiness from this. It is OK but I would pick a stronger flavored beer if I had the choice."
"Overall: The third of the Tucher brews that I have tried to date, all have been well above average offerings. Worth trying, a dependable Teutonic brew."
"Overall, an easy drinking dunkleweizen thats got a nice taste profile and has a clean, fluffy feel. Another good effort by Tucher."
"A pleasant enough example of the style, though a bit bland."
"Light in body even for the style, light in flavor all around. Drinkable, for certain, and it's generally pleasant, just a bit blah."
"16oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a hazy medium brown color with two fingers of off-white head. There is just a touch of lacing. The smell is sweet and malty, with some dark fruit even. Just a bit of caramel aroma as well. The taste is light and slightly sweet, with more caramel coming through. A hint of fruit and spice as well. The body is nice and thick, yet smooth. The drinkability is very very good. A really nice Dunkel Weizen."
"This one pours a dark hazy tea color with a good. The nose is a sweet malty banana. The flavor is just not quite as different from a hefe as I would want. There is a little more malt flavor, but still not quite as different as I want. Its nicely thick and smooth. Drinkability is high, but I like this style."
"This is an easy drinking beer that lacks some of the complexity of my favorite Dunkels. That being said, I'm still pretty satisfied with this beer and would drink it again."
"Wow, I really liked this beer. Can't ad much to what Jason said on his review. It poured a clear rusty brown. Smal frothy head that lasted throughtout. Nice lacing too. The smell was pegged as ripe banana with a sweet bread and spicey note. The taste was delicatable. Caramel, apple, banana, malty, bready, you name it. I think I like this one better than the Weihenstephaner. Great mouthfeel, smooth, and chunky at the same time. I wish I had more of these. Alas, it's back to the beer store."
"Pours a paler copper color with a big tan head in the weizen glass. Some husky, dark wheat malt aromas as well as some fruity yeast notes. A slight bit diluted in flavor. I guess I expected a fuller body than what I received because it seems a little thin. Medium carbonation. Basically a pretty boring dunkelweizen. I'll have to give it another try sometime because I seem to have enjoyed many of Tucher's other brews."
"A nice example of a dark wheat beer, and highly recommended."
"The dunkel pours an amber-brown with some sizeable head formation. It's attractive and offers a seductive roasted grain aroma. The flavors, while not as complex as some dunkels, provide some interesting notes to support this drinkable, and medium bodied beer."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light wheat scent with the addition of some crystal malts for a dark malt aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth, yet mildly malty flavor with a wheaty finish and a fruity taste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This a good dunkel, but I've had better. It has adequate malty flavor and a nice wheat taste; a fine sessions brew."
"When poured, the color was a hazy weak looking brown, that just lack depth in color. The smell was of a mild aroma of spice and malts, nothing outstanding, just an average aroma. The taste was disappointing. It had a bitterness that was a little overpowering for a dunkel and there was also a sour feel in the mouth and palate that was a turn off. Also, there was no after taste to speak of and to me just a turn off."
"Another good offering from Tucher. A little more subtle than the Julius Echter and the Weihenstephan that I followed it with, but real nice just the same. Impressive pour, goes down incredibly easy. I wish I could regularly find the Bajuvator, as that is quite a beer. This one would certainly be worth trying for the Dunkel fans out there."
"Light to medium feel, very pleasant, but a little too sweet. Gets a little puckering as a tartness builds as it warms."
"ng"
"Drinkability: A solid and very drinkable hefeweizen."
"A murky, dirty brown, tea-like appearance, thick, one-finger soapy/bubbly head. An aroma of banana esters and some spices detectable. Creamy and bready up front, maintains a fair amount of hefe-qualities, cloves, bubble gum texture, the clean wheat malts come to play throughout the body, bordering on medium bodied, a pepper-spicy palate and aftertaste. Not as wheaty or malty in flavor as others in it's class, however, very clean, solid and easy to drink, can't go wrong with this dunkel"
"Drinkability  This was a little lighter than I normally like my Dunkel Weizen, but all the necessary ingredients were there and it went down well. Good job!"
"If you like Hefe at all, I strongly advise you try this. It pours a reddish brown, almost like tea, with a slightly carmel toned off-white head. It has the spiciness generally associated with hefeweizen, but keyed up just a wee bit more than say, Franziskaner or Weihenstephaner. This also seemed to leave a very, very faint trace of a cream like aftertaste in my mouth. Perhaps it was just me. Nevertheless, I thought this was a fantastic Hefeweizen and will most certainly buy it again."
"This one's a pretty nice solid brew. Appearance perhaps isn't anything to write home about perhaps, the head being a tad overfizzy, and dissapearing quickly. The smell's nice, sharp and clean, like a good Weizen, but with a significant malty backing. The taste is exactly where it should be, without any bonus frills, malty, and with a decent weight to it. A very drinkable beer."
"Prosit!"
"Very easy drinker. Tastey and enjoyable, just not enought wheat quality for style."
"A big, dense, beige, slow head leaves sticky, thin sheets of smooth, complete lacing. Beer is hazy amber/brown. Smell is sourish, with some chocolate and chemical. Sugar and chocolate in the front; some chocolate and a little fruit in the thin, watery middle; a tangy, slightly bitter finish. This is not bad. A straigh-ahead dunkles."
"One of the better dunkelweis beers. This is one I'll be having again."
"The Rathskeller Wine & Beer Fest:This beer had a small sized white head that contained fine sized bubbles that was fully diminished.The body was clear with no carbonation.The hue of this beer was brown and the nose was fruity (banana) and sweet.The flavor was somewhat acidic from start to finish.The mouthfeel was tingly and medium bodied."
"($1.99 / 16 oz.)"
"I could see carbonation bubbles. A great lasting head was produced that was a beige to tan color and was thick and pillowy. It created a fluffy lace as well that was the same consistence as the head. The aroma was on the mild side, noses of sweet and dark malts, wheat grains, cream and light spices with banana were all present. The flavors seemed more pronounced in certain areas, the malts were in the for-front, then flavors of wheat grains, wood, caramel, roasted nut, banana and light spices seemed to intertwine. The aftertaste was of light malt, wood and wheat, all light. The body was light at the start and got slightly heavier (medium) as it warmed. IMO this is a rather simple beer, refreshing but simple. Seemed to loose carbonation and become almost flat as it came to the finish. An above average beer, that when served cold seems to be better then it is warm."
"Pours a medium brown color with a great pillowey,sticky head,the aroma is sweet and clovey.The taste is real clovey with some banana undertones.I like the light fruity finish,this a real nice beer,Iam not a huge fan of the style because it seems a little heavy to drink very many."
"Pours a hazy brown amber with golden highlights at the edges. A heap of fluffy off-white foam tops it off. Smell is highlighted by crisp grains. Nothing remarkable in the nose, but nothing offensive either. Taste is similarly ho-hum with a texture that is light but on account of being somewhat watery than being crisp like other wheat beers. Some sweet malts up front that fade to typical grain tastes and a hint of light crispness at the very end. Quite drinkable, but there are more interesting choices among hefeweizens."
"This beer pours a hazy brown color with a medium head and minimal lacing on the glass. It has carbonation that stick all up and down the sides of the glass when poured - looks great! The aroma is wonderful. Reminded me of fruits and some sort of nuts - similar to Newcastle Brown. The taste is somewhat sweet and fruit is evident here. Very rich in flavor, but extremely enjoyable. The taste doesn't really remind me of a wheat (weiss) beer as it says on the label, but it's a great tasting beer either way."
"Initial pour yielded a huge wite head with small to medium bubles that immediately filled my glass to the point of overflowing (just perfect). It's aroma was hard to distinguish. Almost non-existant. Very faint smell of its malt. It's body is a nice carame brown not quite opaque with the yeast visibly floating around. Very little carbonation on the tongue and a mild initail taste. As I stopped to right this article the alcohol feeling started to hit. A good sign of a nice beer. It has a very pleesant taste that was very much to my liking. Another great Hefe-Weizen much to my liking. Very mild hoppy taste with a hint of caramel. Very esily drank. I liked it. Another good German brew."
"Interesting offering. The pour created a nice, smallish off-white head that never disappeared. A very attractive dark amber that was only slightly hazy. Great thick lacing throughout the glass. The mouthfeel was very creamy and rich. The taste was sweet and fruity with a hint of cloves. The aroma was also very fruity. I had a sense of spice in the aftertaste that left the mouth feeling a bit of peppery hotness. Attractive labeling and tightly capped amber bottle."
"Pours a brownish amber color with a thick and creamy off-white colored head that coats the sides of the glass as it recedes into a heavy lace. Nose is fresh ripe banana with some underlying notes of clove and nutmeg. Medium in body with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is sweet roasted malts and fruity banana up front quickly followed by a yeasty bready flavor. A bit of nuttiness and spicy clove comes across in the end. A pretty nice Dunkel. Any wheat beer lover should enjoy this brew."
"Pours a cloudy copper with a beautiful pillowy head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Aroma is a nice blend of banana and quite a bit of cloves. Flavor is a little on the bland side for the style... not very sweet, and the banana isn't very noticeable. Some cloves, but mostly just a slightly tart toasted wheat flavor. Very smooth as it warms, but a little rough when first poured. Not bad, but not overly impressive."
"Pours a very dark mahogany color with a nice frothy head.  Unfortunatly that is the best thing about this beer IMO.  Almost no aroma and very very bland boring taste.  I couldn't wait to finsih this brew so that I could order some other type."
"Pours a hazy brown color with a sizeable tan head which retains and laces well. The smell is of faint clove and perhaps some banana and bread, but none come in very prominently like other beers of this style. The taste is somewhat sweet at first and features a good deal of caramel malt. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, is a little watered-down and thin for the style. It does feature a little carbonation, but not enough for the style. This is certainly an easy drinker, but could easily be improved with some more malt, which would give it a desireable, fuller body. Still not a bad beer."
"Murky light brown in hue, topped by a stiff and sticky light tan head.  Wheat tartness and banana esters are most prominent in aroma, with hints of chocolate and toasty Munich adding depth. Caramel sweetness is perceptible upfront, yielding to mild roasted grain and light chocolate.  Understated banana ester profile.  Lightly bodied for style, perhaps even a touch thin in mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ lingering wheat tartness and hints of toasted grain.  A clean, but unimpressive Dunkelweizen that could use more malt and yeast character.  It's not unlike many prosaic US microbrewed versions."
"Had this yesterday at a restaurant called the Austrian Village, in Rockledge, PA. Pours a cloudy reddish-brown color, with a decent creamy off-white head. Banana and other fruity aromas are on the nose possibly apples. Mouth feel is fairly smooth, body sort of thin. Enjoyable on the palate though, pretty balanced, a nice sweetness, fruitiness, banana notes, apples, and caramel malt. I though this went pretty well with my (warm) corned beef sandwich. Overall this was an enjoyable brew."
"16 oz. bottle.......Pours a full rich brown, with a super creamy beige head. The head settled slowly, and evenly very nice. Sweet smells filled up the glass, (I guess my nose doesn't register the bananas, I nver get that.) but I can see candied apples, pears etc. Very full rich fresh smells. Tastes are dominated by the sweet malt. After the rich smell the feel is somewhat thinner than expected. I was looking for a little more doughy taste for the color and smell, but overall very refreshing, easy to drink, and I nice beer to compliment a big meal."
"Dunkles Hefe Weizen: (half liter brown bottle) Cloudy reddish beer, with a very pale beige head.  Very pleasant odor of bananas and sweet apples.  Nice sticky Belgian Lace.  Refreshing.  The taste is very sweet, but the beer is not very lively, although I see by the side of the bottle that I’ve got an old one.  I’ll get a fresher one, as it is worth another look."

"Deep orange color with a fluffy tan head.  The beer gets darker the higher in the glass you look (orange type of black and tan).  Slightly sweet/wheat malt nose.  Smooth and malty brew.  Not complex in any way, but straight at you with mouthfeel."
"Notes: A very tasty Dunkelweizen ... on par for style and a sure thing for any traditional wheat beer lover. Lots of flavours going around to satisfy all of your taste buds. 5.35% abv."
"I'm still looking for a dunkel weiss that has enough malt sweetness to balance out the tart finish associated with this style. Except for a lucky batch of homebrew, I have yet to find it. This is a quality weissbier, no doubt, but to my taste, still lacking as a dunkel."
"First is the very foamy head, but it quickly goes and this dunkle is very drinkable. ABV is 5.3% but pound down a few of these - 1 pint - and you will notice."
"Not as dark as some dunkel weizens but that doesn't take away from the flavor. All the classic hefe flavors with a little added malt character. A pleasure to look at when poured into proper glassware."
"Tucher's Kristall is a hard act to follow, and this dunkel did a pretty fair job.  Substantial bannan esters which are pretty well integrated in the balance.  Overall, a tasty dunkel, but seemed like it needed just a little more kick to in order to be outstanding."
"I'm always impressed by Tucher brews, and this one is no different. A very crisp and flavourful dunkeles hefe. I highly recommend pouring the beer, leaving a bit in the bottle, then rolling the bottle between your hands to losen the yeast and pour it into the glass. You'll gain much more flavour."
