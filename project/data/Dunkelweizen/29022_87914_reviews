"Purchase with caution. A bottle of this was shared this weekend among friends and was explosively carbonated. This smells and tastes nothing like a dunkelweizen. All mineral character and fruity sourness. Sad to say that my only experience with this brewery has been 2 bottles of infected mess."

"Overall, I would call this beer good! I would recommend it to try. I would like to see what it's like on draught and warmer but it's a little flat. I give it a 3.5 out of 5."

"O- Not bad there are better examples out there but I'd drink this again. I was surprised to see that the ABV is only 5.4%, from the hints of alcohol heat I would have thought it was more."

" The taste is good with nice yeast which is dominant and has a tropical taste similar to ripe banana yet not overly sweet with subtle grain toastiness and light spicing. The overall impression is this is a pretty decent wheat with some good dunkle characteristics true to the style in general."

"Lightly hazed brown in color, minimal spots of tan froth. Scent brings light yeast bread, heavy clove and brown sugar. Taste follows suit, really sweet for the style, lots of spice and yeast notes without much flavor depth. Way too carbonated and prickly. Not too into this one."
"Dark, ruddy brown in color, hazy, with a tall fizzy head. The aroma is spritzy, twangy, and refreshing....clove, baking bread, some wheat, and citrus rind. The beer is not as sweet as expected...it has the refreshing zest that I expected, but is maybe tilted a bit too far toward sour. Nice try, though, and very drinkable. Medium in body. This would be nice, served cold on a very hot day."

"My initial pour resulted in just over a finger of deep-tan head, but it faded to wisps in the short time that it took me to type the above verbiage. Wow! Color was a slightly hazy iced tea-brown. I definitely got notes of banana and clove from the nose, so kudos for truth in advertising. Mouthfeel was medium and it tasted of banana and clove with the wheat adding a slight tartness to the mix. The caramel seemed to be lost on me, however. Finish was semi-dry with the clove esters really leading the pack. It was not bad, nor was it great. I am still not totally sold on their lineup of beers, but I am willing to keep knocking them back, one by one."
"Overall: a decent dunkelweizen that is easy to drink and a bit refreshing."
"Good amount of dark fruit complimented by a touch of banana flavor and a nice fluffy texture. Finishes with a bit spicy clove and a touch dry with a lingering sweetness. A bit of alcohol heat for some reason. Long finish with carbonation that sticks to the gums. A nice sweet beer with a bit of balance. simple flavors that go really well together. I like it."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some spices. Taste is of wheat, spice, a bit f caramel, smooth and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing beer, probably better on a hot summer day."

"Overall â€“ Its flavor starts out rather decent, but in the end, with the fading of much of the sweetness, it leaves a little too dry yeasty and spiced flavor on the tongue."

"This beer has a lot of flavor, but I feel like it could finish a touch sweeter. A nice interpretation of the style."
