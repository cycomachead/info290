Pours a nice reddish brown with plenty carbonation and nice creamy head. Smell of fruitiness with banana. Tastes much like smell with some malt insets and other fruit. Fruitiness with malty biscuit following and a slight happiness bite on back end. Comes together very well with smooth feel. A very good dunkle hefe. A favorite for sure.","Gobearswalter34","Aug 01, 2014"

Overall an excellent beer and well worth looking for again, also, sessionable if you don'tind the caloric value. Cheers. Btw I poured most of it in the glass and then rolled the last ounce or two around the bottom to loosen up the yeast for the final pour. Didn't want to waste the bonus on the bottom.

Very bready and grassy as well. There is more barley in this. Mouthfeel is medium with a dry hop kick back and and tingly carbonation feel.

It tasted a bit oxidized, but had some nice wheat and yeast flavor at the end. The aftertaste was dry and slightly acrid. I think the bottle I had was an injustice to the Tucher brand, since I've been to Germany, and I know this would be far better on tap and fresh there.

The taste follows suit, impressing with the caramel and malt, but lacking some complexity. Rather than fruited hints, I'd prefer they were more directly involved in the taste. The modest hop flavor could also use an upgrade. Still, it's good and smooth. I'd like a little more carbonation on this, but the texture atones. It's not hard to knock down a couple of these by any means.

The taste is quite neutral. It starts off with some light clove and banana flavors which are quickly offset with the malt presence, leaving quite a neutral brew. There is a slightly tart apple skin presence as well. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, finishes neutral. A very easy drinking brew.

The initial taste is, ready for this....rootbeer candy. The wheat yeast starts to become aparent on the front of your tongue as the brew gets warmer; it's funky but not at all unpleasant.

It has a very pleesant taste that was very much to my liking. Another great Hefe-Weizen much to my liking. Very mild hoppy taste with a hint of caramel. Very esily drank. I liked it. Another good German brew.","TheDM","Mar 20, 2003"
3.38,-10.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Interesting offering. The pour created a nice, smallish off-white head that never disappeared. A very attractive dark amber that was only slightly hazy. Great thick lacing throughout the glass. The mouthfeel was very creamy and rich. The taste was sweet and fruity with a hint of cloves. The aroma was also very fruity. I had a sense of spice in the aftertaste that left the mouth feeling a bit of peppery hotness. Attractive labeling and tightly capped amber bottle.","AtLagerHeads","Mar 11, 2003"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a brownish amber color with a thick and creamy off-white colored head that coats the sides of the glass as it recedes into a heavy lace. Nose is fresh ripe banana with some underlying notes of clove and nutmeg. Medium in body with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste is sweet roasted malts and fruity banana up front quickly followed by a yeasty bready flavor. A bit of nuttiness and spicy clove comes across in the end. A pretty nice Dunkel. Any wheat beer lover should enjoy this brew.","Morris729","Mar 08, 2003"
3.78,-0.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a cloudy copper with a beautiful pillowy head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Aroma is a nice blend of banana and quite a bit of cloves. Flavor is a little on the bland side for the style... not very sweet, and the banana isn't very noticeable. Some cloves, but mostly just a slightly tart toasted wheat flavor. Very smooth as it warms, but a little rough when first poured. Not bad, but not overly impressive.","zerk","Jan 19, 2003"
2.94,-22.4,4,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a very dark mahogany color with a nice frothy head.  Unfortunatly that is the best thing about this beer IMO.  Almost no aroma and very very bland boring taste.  I couldn't wait to finsih this brew so that I could order some other type.","tigerpaws","Oct 30, 2002"
3.58,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a hazy brown color with a sizeable tan head which retains and laces well. The smell is of faint clove and perhaps some banana and bread, but none come in very prominently like other beers of this style. The taste is somewhat sweet at first and features a good deal of caramel malt. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, is a little watered-down and thin for the style. It does feature a little carbonation, but not enough for the style. This is certainly an easy drinker, but could easily be improved with some more malt, which would give it a desireable, fuller body. Still not a bad beer.","Jon","Oct 07, 2002"
3.13,-17.4,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Murky light brown in hue, topped by a stiff and sticky light tan head.  Wheat tartness and banana esters are most prominent in aroma, with hints of chocolate and toasty Munich adding depth. Caramel sweetness is perceptible upfront, yielding to mild roasted grain and light chocolate.  Understated banana ester profile.  Lightly bodied for style, perhaps even a touch thin in mouthfeel.  Finishes w/ lingering wheat tartness and hints of toasted grain.  A clean, but unimpressive Dunkelweizen that could use more malt and yeast character.  It's not unlike many prosaic US microbrewed versions.","marc77","Sep 03, 2002"
3.95,4.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Had this yesterday at a restaurant called the Austrian Village, in Rockledge, PA. Pours a cloudy reddish-brown color, with a decent creamy off-white head. Banana and other fruity aromas are on the nose possibly apples. Mouth feel is fairly smooth, body sort of thin. Enjoyable on the palate though, pretty balanced, a nice sweetness, fruitiness, banana notes, apples, and caramel malt. I though this went pretty well with my (warm) corned beef sandwich. Overall this was an enjoyable brew.","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 16, 2002"
4.23,11.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"16 oz. bottle.......Pours a full rich brown, with a super creamy beige head. The head settled slowly, and evenly very nice. Sweet smells filled up the glass, (I guess my nose doesn't register the bananas, I nver get that.) but I can see candied apples, pears etc. Very full rich fresh smells. Tastes are dominated by the sweet malt. After the rich smell the feel is somewhat thinner than expected. I was looking for a little more doughy taste for the color and smell, but overall very refreshing, easy to drink, and I nice beer to compliment a big meal.","StevieW","Jun 10, 2002"
3.27,-13.7,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Dunkles Hefe Weizen: (half liter brown bottle) Cloudy reddish beer, with a very pale beige head.  Very pleasant odor of bananas and sweet apples.  Nice sticky Belgian Lace.  Refreshing.  The taste is very sweet, but the beer is not very lively, although I see by the side of the bottle that I’ve got an old one.  I’ll get a fresher one, as it is worth another look.","jackndan","May 07, 2002"

3.51,-7.4,4,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Deep orange color with a fluffy tan head.  The beer gets darker the higher in the glass you look (orange type of black and tan).  Slightly sweet/wheat malt nose.  Smooth and malty brew.  Not complex in any way, but straight at you with mouthfeel.","frank4sail","Apr 20, 2002"
4.03,6.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Notes: A very tasty Dunkelweizen ... on par for style and a sure thing for any traditional wheat beer lover. Lots of flavours going around to satisfy all of your taste buds. 5.35% abv.","Jason","Apr 05, 2002"
3.8,0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"I'm still looking for a dunkel weiss that has enough malt sweetness to balance out the tart finish associated with this style. Except for a lucky batch of homebrew, I have yet to find it. This is a quality weissbier, no doubt, but to my taste, still lacking as a dunkel.","inebrius","Mar 21, 2002"
4.24,11.9,4,5,4,4,4,"First is the very foamy head, but it quickly goes and this dunkle is very drinkable. ABV is 5.3% but pound down a few of these - 1 pint - and you will notice.","jdhilt","Jan 08, 2002"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Not as dark as some dunkel weizens but that doesn't take away from the flavor. All the classic hefe flavors with a little added malt character. A pleasure to look at when poured into proper glassware.","John","Nov 12, 2001"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Tucher's Kristall is a hard act to follow, and this dunkel did a pretty fair job.  Substantial bannan esters which are pretty well integrated in the balance.  Overall, a tasty dunkel, but seemed like it needed just a little more kick to in order to be outstanding.","Brent","Oct 30, 2001"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"I'm always impressed by Tucher brews, and this one is no different. A very crisp and flavourful dunkeles hefe. I highly recommend pouring the beer, leaving a bit in the bottle, then rolling the bottle between your hands to losen the yeast and pour it into the glass. You'll gain much more flavour.","Todd","Jun 24, 2001"
