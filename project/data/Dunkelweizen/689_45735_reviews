"Bonfire Dunkle Weiss is ok....I am just not a fan of this beer style so ratings from me are probably skewed. This was a retro release from Two Bros. The beer was dark almost opaque with brow/ruby hugh. There is a almost non-existent head that is not lacing. There is a light wheatly smell and a sweet mlt taste. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with bland carbonation. Overall...eh."

"D/O Drinkability is good with the manageable ABV and the good tastes. Overall this is a fine Dunkelweizen. 4.0"
""
"Overall, this is a dunkelweizen worth your time. It was perfect on draught, and I can say that it is a testament to a great brewery."

"The feel is crisp and light, but smooth as well. A good dunkelweizen will dispel the ""darker is heavier"" notion held by those who don't know better."
""
"Pours a dark brown with a two finger cream-colored head. Smells of light roasted malt and a bit of clove. Opens with a mild chocolately flavor mixed with light tones of clove and banana and a bit of bread. Finishes smooth with light chocolate roasted malt flavors. Very light bodied. A decent brew, however the flavors never really come through and were never as upfront as I would have liked."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with mid-level carbonation that's enough to foam this up slightly on the palate without creating any ""prickly"" sensation. The resulting mouthfeel is smooth, flowing, and well-suited to the beer: it sits around on the palate long enough to pick up the flavors as necessary. Closes out semi-dry with a bit of stickiness around the edges of the mouth."
""
""
"Overall: Decent Hefeweizen, but needs more yeast to balance the roast."

"The malty dunkle/bannana/malt/sweetness comes through more in the smell than the taste. Taste is a bit drier and hoppier with a chocolaty finish with less complexity than others of this style. It is good, not great, and for $6/bommer it was solid value."
"Kinda going out of order in this anniversary series (1, 3, 2), but who's counting? This stuff pours a dark, somewhat hazy russet-ruby topped by a half-finger of off-tan foam. The nose comprises clove, dark wheat, light banana, a pinch of black pepper, and a half-pinch of cinnamon. The taste comes through with a blast of spice: cinnamon, clove, brown sugar, allspice, and black pepper. Some mild dark wheat and banana notes populate the background, but they're clearly relegated to the supporting cast (they're petitioning for more than their couple o' lines apiece, but the director seems to be a bit of an ass...). Something akin to mild tea sits amongst the scenery behind everything else. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a muddled, weak take on the dunkelweizen style. Not my thing, yo."

"O: The beer seems to be over carbonated and takes a delicate hand to pour this and get more beer than bubbles in your glass. The beer is interesting but doesnâ€™t seem to fit the style."
"O: The bottle describes this as a darker, more chocolaty version of their Ebel's Weiss hefeweizen. This is really quite tasty."
"Ah it was alright, pretty drinkable although more flavor in any direction...whether it be more roastiness or more hefeweizen characteristics. Good price point but wouldn't seek out otherwise,"
""
"This one is pretty drinkable, and I'm not usually a dunkelweizen fan (or wheat beer in general for that matter) but this one has a distinct enough profile where it distracts from the clove; my worst enemy."

"O - I wish I would have looked at reviews before my spontaneous, joy-filled purchase. It seems there had been issues even when fresh. Then again, I knew what I was getting into, buying an old beer. Still, it's not as bad as some reviews have made it out to be, even with it's age."
"I hate to tank a rating, but in reality, there is an infection here and the beer didn't have anything to fight back with. If you still have this beer, drink or destroy."
"Holy carbonation batman. Seriously, 1/3 of a inch of beer and a whole Tripel Karmeliet tulip filled with head. Jeez. That's a shit ton of head. Serious lacing all the way down the glass. Bad sign, only time I've ever seen that much head is in a infected beer. I'm glad I put in the the kegerator when I did, otherwise my cellar might have been a tad stickier. The nose is interesting. Muted notes of caramel and toast mixed with green apple skins and pie cherries. The flavor is much the same but the sour pie cherries and green apples dominate the flavor profile pushing the caramel and toast to the outskirts of the flavor profile. It's not horrific at all, but it doesn't seem like its supposed to be there either. Its not a bad beer, but I think its turned into something that its not supposed to be. I once had a barleywine that picked up a slight infection that just lent itself to a mild tartness in the background. Made it really tasty. This is more along the same lines. Malt is still there, but its definitely secondary the the tartness of the beer. It kind of hits you in the back of the jaw."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, although there are better beers in the style this is still a solid beer that is worth drinking for a while."
"Quite drinkable but somewhat sweet. Clearly cold weather beer."
"Not a bad offering from Two Brothers, but I like some of there other stuff better."
"Drinkbility overall an enjoyable fall/winter seasonal that I would like more access to, I think these two brothers should move into Pittsburgh they are makin' some great versions of classic styles and this one sits no differently."
"D: I should have done my research and checked out the reviews on this one before getting it. The drain ended up getting more of this one than I did. I was all excited to try different dunkelweizens, but this one is a big disappointment. Stay away...I wish I had."
"Sampled this beer at room temp poured into a pint glass. Beer is dark chestnut hue with garnet tints and fizzy beige head of 4 cm foaming up even with a gentle pour, would have overflowed without precautions taken. Aroma is chocolate malt and roasted notes a little fruity, but not as complex as I had hoped. Not too much twang in there either. First sip reveals an average body and rolling gentle carbonation. Flavor is very mild but similar to nose with bits of brown sugar and chocolate and a hint of dark red fruit, plums??. No hops or ABV show through, but again not very complex flavor. The beer is an easy drinker, but I was hoping for more subtleties and mix of flavors. I am a little disappointed."
"My first time experiencing a Dunkle Weiss. I was skeptical at first since I don't care for Weiss beers. This is very different than the usual Weiss. When it is poured, Bonfire looks like Root Beer with a very thick, but light head. The color is similar to root beer as well. It has a sweet flavor with a rich coffee/chocolate aftertaste. I learned tonight that I don't mind a Dunkle Weiss, but don't prefer it either."
"D: Drinkable and interesting."
"Two Brothers is a pretty solid brewery. This is not one of their finer efforts. It's okay, but suffers from overcarbonation and a strong banana deficiency. Ultimately the flavor never really materializes into what I'd hoped it would be. Those probably wouldn't be big problems to correct. Fix it and get this fire blazing. It's worth a try. Stick with a single bomber though."
"This was served with a small light tan head and a little lace. Color is a fairly hazy very dark mahoganey. Aroma was roasty dark malt, pumpernickle rye, a little dark ripe fruit, and not a lot of spice. Flavor is dominated by tartness, then a little bittersweetness, the above aroma characteristics and a little nuttiness. Body is ok, a bit sharp. Finish is mainly dark sour malt. Nothing special, but not too bad."
"D: This one is enough for me. Maybe I'll check back in on the next, uninfected, batch."
"So after a delicate twenty minute long pour the beer is finally ready to be drank. How annoying. The beer is a dark brown color (perhaps the darkest dunkelweizen I've yet seen, but alright). The head is massive, and doesn't recedes. The aroma has the nasty chemically breadiness to it. It smells nothing like a dunkelweizen. Unfortunately this translates over into the taste. There is some roasted malt, and chocolate with a hint of yeast that cover some of it up, but it is still there. It is also lacking of the usual banana bread and clove that are expected in the dunkelweizen. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with likely carbonation. Overall, this beer doesn't do it for me. It seems like Two Brothers was trying for a dunkelweizen/porter hybrid along the lines of New Glarus Black Wheat. If that is truly what they were going for they were completely off. On the other hand if they were going for a traditional dunkelweizen they were way off too. The aroma makes me scared with every sip that it will taste like it smells. That, and the over carbonated pour make this beer a something I would not recommend."
"Overall, very easy drinking beer. This bomber didn't take me too long to finish. I really liked it. Good representation of the style and I would buy more."
"D - Very drinkable but not much to it, overall just a average beer. If it wasn't for the beer notebook I would have completely forgotten about this one"
"Drinkability is great, I enjoyed this one and could enjoy several more. Would love to see it on tap sometime."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with good carbonation. Goes down easy enough but in the end it just doesn't really strike a chord with me."
"Bonfire Dunkel Weiss Dark Wheat Ale is not one of Two Brothers's better efforts. Having said that, it's a decent example of the style that would probably be just fine after a few well-chosen tweaks. A purchase price of $5.99 isn't too bad for a bomber, but a second chance probably isn't in the cards."
"This is easy to kick back definitely. I need to find a sixer now."
"I love a good dunkel weiss, and this joins the ranks. Way to go, Bros!"
"Drinkability: While I could drink a few more bottles, I see no overwhelming reason to. Probably the most disappointing Two Brother's beer I've had. Their beers are normally very good, very well balanced. This one just didn't do it for me."
"Dark reddish brown. Diluted milk chocolate head, leaves a wispy lace. Light aroma's of caramel and chocolate malts. Light toast and ghost nuttiness. Flavors of pumpernickle and toasted bread crusts, very light roasted malt flavors. Again hints of nut. Finishes with faintly sweet caramel. Mouthfeel is slick and thin. Drinkability is effortless. A nice easy drinker. I would have preferred more maltiness and a bigger body on this. Sausages anyone?"
"Not a great dunkel, but a drinkable dark brown with a decent white head, and substantial lace down the glass. Boozy, spicey chocolate aroma. Above-average carbonation and about average mouthfeel as a tad more watery than I would expect. I taste a bunch of cloves first and foremost, and then chocolate.Fairly sourish finish. Could be much creamier."
"Probably could use a bit more carbonation and the body isn't as full as others of the genre. Still, a nice entry from Two Bros. and a worthwhile brew to give a shot."
"Overall this beer failed my expectations of a Dunkelweizen. It is too bad this was my first Two Brothers beer as I've heard nothing but good things about them, but this really did not impress me. It is drinkable, but not what I expect from the style."
"A decent-drinking beer but a bit underwhelming for a dunkelweizen."
"Wow, surprised at Two Bros with this one, usually they produce tasty brews. This one misses the mark badly."
"Drinkability - a decent brew, crafty but not all that enticing. 3.0"
"22 ouncer, under $6 at Cable Bev in Bardonia, NY. Pours dark cola, moderate head, dissolves to a medium khaki ring and leaves just a smidge of lace. dark ripe fruit nose. Figs, earth, dark fruit juice, and a slight metallic or perhaps a hint oxidation picked up before it was warmed up. Ehh, nothing special going on here. I'd say worth a try if you're in love with the style."
"D - This is a pretty interesting dunkel. Pretty tasty, too."
"Good solid atmosphere. Subdued but complex flavor and nose. Great light feel, but taste is not sacrificed. All of this makes for great drinkability. Great quaff."
"One more thing. The bottle I purchased claimed 6.2 ABV, not the 7.5 listed on this site. Was gibt es?"
"D - Solid drinkable brew that met my expectations."
"D- This beer is a bit bland with the flavors coming through being a bit off and one dimensional."
"D: I highly suggest that all sediment be swirled around and poured into your glass. Doing so really dials in a toasty/creamy/chocolatey presence that I think is what the folks at Two Brothers were going for with this beer. Very enjoyable."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, carbonation a bit prickly but overall a mostly silky and smooth mouthfeel. Good drinkability, a pretty nice example of the style."
"Drinkability: In the end it was a nice light Dunkelweizen, but it just didn't anything for me. I liked almost everything this beer had to offer, but it just didn't anything for me. Maybe it's the Dunkelweizen style. Two Brothers brews a few quality brews and this is another one on that list. It is worth a shot? Not really unless you really like Dunkelweizens or Two Brothers beers. If not, then you can pass this one up. One of these was enough for me."
"Slightly less complex than Kyle Orton's neck beard, though infinitely more drinkable this one reminds me of the Packers season, full of hope with flashes of brillaince but overall a let down."
"Pours a good two finger head after the pour that retains to a ring of foam. Dark cola colored, ruby beer with strong bubbling. Figgy and some chocolatey aromas. Plus some light roasted malts as well. Fruity toasted and roasted malts give layers of complexity to this dunkle weiss. Plums and cocoa and figs. Complex and tastey dunkle with a malty, fruity palate and a juicey feel."
"Pours a super murky brown with a quick two finger light tan head thatdies down to a thin layer of foam. Some stick remains on the sides of the glass after swirling, but not much. Smell consists of chocolate covered bananas with some smokey malts and grains. Metallic notes, roasted marshmallows, and gritty earth in the nose as well. A nice aromatic balance between toasty and sweet. Taste starts off with metallic banana bread and brown sugar, interesting. Midway dark wheat flavors emerge on the tongue with clove, nuts, and cocoa powder. Unfortunately this beer suffers in the aftertaste with a wet carboard flavor, caramel, and ashy bark. Light to medium body with a somewhat smooth feel but the strong carbonation sting really gets in the way. I must say though, the 7.5% is hidden quite well. A nice winter beer, but a bit rough around the edges. Thanks for the chance to give this bad boy a try Dan."
"Overall: I've had only one or two dunkleweiss beers before this one and I'm not sure if it's my style. I enjoy this particular one for what it is and the thing I liked the most about the flavor was the unexpected sourness, made it quite refreshing. Despite that though, I doubt I will pick this up again but I'm sure some would enjoy it immensely."
"Drinkability- Honestly the beer isn't bad while cold but once it warms the sweetness really is a bit overbearing. It's fairly cloying and becomes a bit too much. Unfortunately the best part of this beer is the mouthfeel and look. Not the worst beer I've ever had but not my favorite from Two Brothers."
"D: Tasty and easy to drink. Definitely worth a try and re-buy."
"Dark murky mess of brown liquid. Bubbly light brown head. Barely. And lacing is damn near absent. Aroma is muddy, earthy and vegetal. A little clove and chocolate, but the nose is mostly goth. Flavor is phenolic, a little roasty, slight anise and some bread pudding. All in all, pretty agreeable. Easy to drink. Smooth feel to it. Close to medium in body. Decent enough, but not really up to Two Brother's standards."
"Not a well done dunkelweizen. The 6.2% ABV is well hidden in this light bodied beer. It was also a bit expensive as well. There are many dunkleweizens that are better and cheaper on the market."
"A nice dunkelweizen, but I would have liked the banana to show up in the flavor."
"This is a very solid and drinkable beer. I'm a big fan of the beer and the brewery."
"As I find with most Two Brother's offerings... this was good, not great. It's a fun style to play with but I wouldn't be sad to let the rest of this season pass without having another Bonfire."
"Very drinkable. Like this one a lot."
"Tastes cidery, there are grape and clove notes, with sort of a funky yeast presence that doesn't help things. It lingers into the aftertaste, with a sort of slick feeling. The body is thinner than a dunkelweisse/weizenbock, about as light as a standard hefeweizen. I finished the pint, but didn't really enjoy it. This is a brand new keg, as this was just released. I don't have high hopes for the bottled version, although this may be a bad draft line issue (not likely looking at other bottle reviews)."
"A lightly hazy dark wheat beer with a thin but persistent white head, aromas of wheat malt, chocolate, and banana/clove yeast notes, leaning more toward the clove. Solid toasted malt flavor with enough roastiness to balance. Little hop presence until the aftertaste. A very easy-drinking beer for one with as much flavor as it has and a welcome addition to TBB's lineup. Since it uses the same yeast and hops as their year-round Ebel Weiss brew, I would not be surprised to see this one make a return appearance, maybe next year."
"D- very easy to drink and a welcomed addition to the two brothers family. the growler went well when split between three people"
