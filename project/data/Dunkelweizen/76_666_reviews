"This beer was poured from an 11.2oz bottle and enjoyed in a Erdinger World Cup weissbier glass at apx. 60F."
"Overall, this is a very good dunkelweizen, too bad I have glanced over it before."
""

"Pours a cloudy brown amber with a slowly fading beige head. Aroma and tat of wheat, some mild banana notes and grass, light caramel, yeast flavors as well. A medium body with mild carbonation. The finish the same as taste with a bit of a nutty yeast ending, mild wheat flavor. An enjoyable brew"

"Pours a dark copper-amber in color with a 2-finger off-white foamy head that settles along the top and sides. LOTS of sticky lacing is seen. The aroma is of yeast, caramel malts, wheat with a hint of spice. The taste is about the same with a good mild flavor that goes down very easy with a sweet finish. No bitter aftertaste. A super good brew!"

"O - To be honest, I would love to give this beer closer to a 4 than a 3.5; it really is a smooth and enjoyable beer, but it lacks the intricacy and higher complexity a 4+ beer deserves. An enjoyable and present beer, but by no means a powerhouse."
"Home tasting, 11.2oz bottle into Snifter. 1/28/14."

"O: This beer has some nice complexities and is very easy to drink. It is a good representation of the style."
""
"A decent dunkel, the sweetness definitely the star here, as outlined above. Good, overall, but the barest of upticks in ABV surely isn't enough to justify the hit to my tastebuds. Nice, but unfortunately readily forgettable."

"Prost!"

"O--This is the perfect example of the style. The Germans can really get a lot of mileage out of only four ingredients. Others would have to add a couple of ingredients to get this much of a varied flavor profile."

"O- Solid dunkel. Was expecting more depth or complexity. Felt slightly watered down. I'll chill the next one a bit."

"Hacker Pschorr Dark Hefewisen: The brown translucent body proves it’s a dark beer. The head forms with large bubbles and settles into a thin layer. The aroma is true to style, with wheat, malts and citrus notes coming through. I must have not been in the mood for a dark wheat, as the malt flavor seemed too much, and there was a bit of metallic ness to the flavor. A regular Hefe would have been preferred. I have had dark Hefe’s on tap in Munich, and they were to die for. But the Hacker Pschorr from the bottle did not do the trick."

"Taste shows more wheat than the nose and is crisp and light despite the color. The choco notes come out much more and the yeast is more nutty than clove and banana. Kinda nice for a switch up. I like it. The mouthfeel is nice and sooo easy to drink. Good stuff!"
"Overall, and excellent German brew, this one. I could session this easily."
"Pours a cider like brown-amber with nearly no head at all. The bouquet is characterized by Rhone apple and cherries. Belgian yeast are noticed first with the initial pull. A dulled, not sweet, apple cider follows. An astrigent pithiness gets the final say in this average dunkel weisse. Hacker-Pschorr did ok with this one."
""
""
"Overall for a mass produced German beer this one is pretty close to style. Prost!"
"O- Not to impressed at first but after giving it a look over it really is delicious and very drinkable.. Somewhat watery tasting when warm. It tastes much better cold. . Very session-able. Would not necessarily buy again unless I was drinking with someone who only likes wheats."
"O: This is a good example of a Dunkelweizen. A relaxing beer that goes down way too easy. Well worth a try."
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a 2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, yeast, spice, and some banana aromas. Taste is of wheat, spices, and caramel banana flavors. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good dunkelweizen but I do think this one is past its prime at this point."

"overall a definite winner and excellent for the style. yummy stuff!"
""
""
""
"Overall: A great example of a style that I really enjoy"
""
""
""
"Overall: As with the other Hacker-Pschorr beers I've had over the years, it's firmly just OK."

"I know this was an old beer and I'm somewhat disappointed that I bought it, but did so because it's rarely seen in these parts. Will revisit again when I can find a fresh bottle."

"O - I just finished a vigorous 15-mile hike and sat down to enjoy this beer. It tasted great and sure is a nice start to replacing the electrolytes I crave (see the movie Idiocracy if you don't get this joke)."
""
""

"Overall- An interesting beer for sure, but really, it is 98% hefe and 2% dunkle. Find yourself a good hefe and go with that."
"D: This is a very good dunkelweizen, and a perfect great example of the style. I could drink these all night."
"Poured a brilliant orange/amber color, with a smallish beige colored head. A little spicy on the nose, with a bit of caramel, some cereal and rye bread. On the palate, this one is sweet, crisp, gingerbread, mint and medium bodied, with some caramel, toasted malt and cereal."
"Overall Drinkability - Creamy. Smooth. No off elements. Has interesting point like the effervescent carbonation. I like."
"Drinkability: Yowza. This is an incredible brew. I think this may be one of the best dunkelweizens I have ever had."
"O- Very drinkable without being over-powering on any front. I would definitely recommend this to someone that doesn't normally like ""darker beers."""
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, fairly smooth and easy on the palate. Drinks nicely, solid classic example of the style."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Pours hazy brown with a nice off-white head that recedes fairly quickly. Caramel and bread in the aroma (cake?). Similar taste with caramel maltiness up front, some breadiness and earth, some light spice, and an acidic wheat-beer bite. Overall rather smooth, with a medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"D: This is an great tasting beer. Not quite as good as Weihenstephaner's version, but very close. A great example of one of my favorite styles of beer. Getting this at 13 bucks a case was the deal of the year for me."
"O - This is a very nice beer."
"Taste was more yeast and clove than I was hoping for. Dark caramel, tea leaves and bready. A good deal of complexities, but not really up my alley. Drank it first from Koppa's in Milwaukee, gave it another try, just can't get into what it brings to the table. Doesn't falter because of lack of taste, I just can't get too much into dunkels still."
"The mouthfeel is dissappointing, though not bad. It's too thin, nearly watery. And it doesn't have enough carbonation to make up for it. It's certainly below average in terms of mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Dunkelweizen. It's not revelatory by any stretch of the imagination, but it delivers solid flavors."
"Pour brings a somewhat-muddy light caramel brew that isn't terribly hazy. Off-white head with a bit of lacing and not too much retention. The nose brings some light dark malts and even a hint of chocolate along with clove and a bit of banana. The taste doesn't offer too much more and is a bit plain--it's almost as if the malt was to be the focus in this beer rather than the yeast. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a touch of carbonation. Drinks decently enough, but there was nothing really getting me to finish the bottle."
"This isn't a bad dark wheat beer. The flavors are well balanced and plentiful without being watery."
"Overall the appearance and scent over promise on the taste but its not really a grave offense for this style. Personally I prefer weizens overall which have a more pronounced fruity flavor but I think everyone should try this at least once to see if it caters more to their personal preferences. There is nothing bad about it all."
"Like with current Paulaners a 6 or 12 pack may contain a sour stinker, if you drink this and it's sour or metallic tasting then it's gone over, pour it out and move along to the next."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, nice flavor."
"D: Very high. For all its flaws this beer was very drinkable."
"Beer is medium bodied and really creamy, a very good beer. Finishes nicely, not dry. Good fruit flavors on the midpalate, a really good dunkelweiss, even if its misspelled."
"D) A good example of this category."
"A nice hazy brown German beer with a good frothy light tan head. Goes to lacing. Nice even carbonation. The aroma is sweet and nutty. Flavor is very smooth, malty, nutty with a slight buttery finish. Banana too. Medium body and mouthfeel. Flavor is good, but a little ""soft"" in the finish. Still, a top-notch dunkelweizen."
"A lot of acidity comes out first with the initial sip. Muted fruit, and a buttery finish. Yeasty on the tongue. Thin in the flavor category. Noticeable attenuation. Medium-bodied. Somewhat bland & a little disappointing. I've also discovered a ""Produced On"" indicator on the bottom-right corner of the label: 10/08. Tell me that's a mistake..."
"a subtle dunkelweizen of a lot of flavors but little boldness. come forthright a tad sweet. good look... my pour was like the pictures. nose is of citrus and crisp yeast. palate is mild sweet wheat malt. and apple toasty in there somewhere. some apple pie... but very discrete... coriander finish..."
"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a root-beer-brown color with a finger of khaki head. The retention was poor and the lacing was sparse in scattered, broken bands. The aroma was of caramel malt, chocolate malt, light toasted malt, nuts and (curiously) malt extract. The flavors were of toasted malt, the tang of wheat, caramel malt and hints of crappy coffee. Slightly tart and a bitterness of citrus peel and sharp hops came through on the finish. Didn't exactly land the dismount. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation good."
"D= This beer is an amazing Dunkel. I'll be buying more of this for sure. It's no Vitus but it's up there just as much. A little less intense than the Vitus but worth every penny and it's a little more avalible to me."
"Pours a slightly hazed dark amber color with a two finger yellowed white head that clings to everything. Popping the cap sends sweet wheat malts aromas wafting towards my being. Hints of various fruits, lots of clove and some banana round out the nose quite well. The taste of this pulls me in a couple of directions. I'm first hit with some caramel, burnt sugar, and plums. That is followed up by and hint of lemon, clove and banana. First I think bock then its clear the hefe is in the house. Leaves a lingering spicy wheat taste on the tongue. Medium body, creamy smooth mouthfeel, lots of carbonation. Not usually something I would pick up, but I rather enjoyed this one. I could see a few of these on a warm day in my future."
"Hefeweizens are fantastically suited to hot and sunny days because they are such easy going, refreshing beers; Dunkelweizens sort of carry that same affability over into the cooler, darker evening setting of those same kind of days by adding that extra bit of colour and malty richness. Of course, they're also good at every other time of day, too!"
"poured into goblet. large, rocky white head, rustic reddish brown with golden edges. nicely retained head. smells like wheat, banana, and a fair dose of clove. fairly caramel-malt sweet on the nose as well. i take a nice quaff and its got good spice zip up front that quickly turns sweeter, with banana and malts coming in nicely. very bready all the way through, has good medicinal clove and banana interplay on the mild finish. excellent mouthfeel; very delicate and balanced well with the carbonation. could drink these all day. an excellent dukelweizen."
"Poured an attractive copper color with a fluffy white head that lasted for quite some time. Aroma is of banana, clove, dark fruit and bread. Flavor is very much the same as the aroma. Very smooth and easy to drink. None of the flavors are overdone. Mouthfeel is very pleasant making the drinkability of this beer quite high. Very thirst quenching."
"This is my favorite H-S Weissbier...just loaded with favor, refreshing and sessionable."
"D: One taste and I wanted to guzzle the whole glass down. This is what you want in a brew. Would be good any time of year. Maybe not quite as good as Weihenstephaner's version, but very close. Another wonderful example of my favorite style of beer."
"Overall it is a pleasant beer, would be a thirst quencher in the summer."
"Pours a dark oakish color with a yellow-ish hue. Head was light and khaki in color and bubbly and foamy in texture; it was about 3/4 in thick. Aroma was a relatively strong smell of raisin bread. Taste was a mix of sweet wheat, cloves, and a kick of spiciness to go down. Great body, decent thickness and perfect amount of carbonation. Not too heavy and a great taste, so I could definitely have at least 3 in a row if I wanted."
"Overall, quenching and delicious, a very very good dunkelweizen. Worth trying if you like the style."
"Noticed production date of 11/07. Neverless enjoyable brew and look forward to sampling other offerings from brewer."
"This is one of the best dark wheat beers in the world. The taste is so smooth for a wheat beer. A lot of wheat beers will leave a funny flavor if your not used to drinking them, but this one is so smooth. Color is exceptional and you have to pour this beer in a tall glass and watch the beautiful bubbles. Its magical."
"D-Good, great body, with pleasant smooth taste"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer with flavor and substance that is worth drinking for a while."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a big giant head. The smell was sour and sweet. The beer cloudy. The beer tasted rotten sour. If you like sour rotten beer the by all means drink this. Beer should not be sour I don't care which country likes it makes it or loves it. It is just wrong."
"Drinkability- extraordinary drinkablity, i could drink this all nite long, very thirst quenching and well balanced, really nice finish and flavor, very great example of the style,"
"Smells of sweet banana and wheat. Bit of clove spice, becoming more evident with warming. More wheat on the palate, somewhat dry, and with a light toasted grain feel on the finish and just a hint of fig. Smooth close yet a bit thin at times, not offering the body of the more refined Weihenstephaner in my view even though it may be truer to style. Solid nonetheless though not as complex as their standard Weisse with regards to yeast nuances."
"I still prefer their hefe, but the Hacker dunkel is certainly a first rate example of the style. Glad I could try it on draught: could drink this all night!"
"One of the best Dunkles. Great flavor and head retention. Love the malty, clover tase. Not very hoppy....true to style. Wonderful mouthfeel and smooth, malty aftertaste. Cloudy as a summer day in Seattle....and that's a good thing! Enjoy this one in the summer. Some like it with fruit, but I think it's much better straight up!"
"This beer has a medium body and is pretty carbonated. It has some nice drinkability and is pretty easy on the palate."
"Overall, this is a great dunkleweizen. Pour every drop of sediment out of the bottle to maximize your dunkle-drinking pleasure!"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink on the whole. A good standard for this beer style."
"From a 12oz bottle poured a slightly cloudy amber colour with a huge frothy off white head. Smells of lighty toasted malts, light fruit and bread. Tastes sweet and smooth, pretty well balanced. I'm usually not a fan of this style of beer but this one is quite good and I could see my self picking it up again."
"Pretty drinkable beer, overall rather good."
"Overall: Really good drinkability, a little high on the carbonation which takes away from the taste. Pretty sweet, but has a nice roasted character and tang from the yeast and wheat to help even things out a bit."
"D: Very flavorful, smooth and balanced. Interesting drink that easy to drink."
"This is one of the best dunklewizens I have ever had. Great beer, I will be buying more of this!"
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is mild, a hint of cloves. taste is of malt and wheat with some fruitiness, very flavorfull. Medium bodied in the mouth and highly drinkable. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a cloudy, copper/maize color. 5/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of pear, coriander, yeast, sweet malt, and tart malt. Fits the style of a Dunkelweizen. Mouth feel is sharp and acidic with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pear, and tart malt. Overall, a good aroma, good appearance, lacking in complexity, and weak in body."
"D - easy to drink."
"* Just had, but reviewing from memory.."
"It is very drinkable. I wish there was some more fruity zest; however, it was very good none-the-less."
"D- Drinking this I could of swore this was in the 7-8% ABV range with all the malts used but I was surprised when I read 5.3%. Sessionable but my tall hacker glass was enough for me. The taste is just very one-demensional leaving me not wanting to order another. This is pretty drinkable though."
"M + D: A moderate, yet assertive carbonation over a body that holds its own with a little weightiness. An easy going drink, and a good pairing with a sauerbrauten sandwich!"
"Nice looking brew, poured to a cloudy brown color, almost a iced-tea color with a huge thick fluffy off white to very light tan head that has good retention. Some nice lacing down the side of the glass though not as much as I had expected based on the size of the head. The aroma has a nice wheat smell, slightly toasted, fruit flavors highlighted by banana. The flavor is good, wheat malt flavors come to mind right away, nice roast like taste. The middle and tail end see the flavors changing as fruit flavors come out more and more. Banana is the major fruit flavor but I feel that I am also picking up some pear? Has a very smooth feel, ind of silky as it goes down. Real nice brew and for the price you can't beat it. This brew drinks very easily as I am pretty much finished with it already, could be a good session brew."
"Pretty damn good wheat beer. Very similar in character to Boulevard's Lunar Ale (which I tasted recently), but the flavors are better blended and the body is noticeably more substantial. Solid all around and worth trying for sure."
"I'm not a huge fan of the Hacker-Pschorr Hefe, but I've found that with weizens freshness is key, and bottles sitting on unrefrigerated shelves don't cut it. My feeling is that for an kegged import this is still in relatively good shape, and has benefited substantially."
"Pours a dark brown colored body, somewhat cloudy, with a big foamy white head. Has a somewhat flowery aroma, lots of wheat, dark roasted aroma. Enticing smell. Very bubbly, dark wheat flavor. Some flowers. Very good flavor."
"I wonder how this would pair with an apple pie, or if you could cook an apple pie with this beer? I think this beer knocks off one of the ""servings"" of fruit I should eat every day."
"Pours a hazy, kinda muddy looking brown with a small tan head. Smells of sweet, toasted wheat, fresh tobacco, and lots of yeast. Tastes like liquified Wheaties (in a good way). This bottle isn't as cold as it should be and so I'll have to update this review later on this week, but it's obvious that this beer is a solid choice."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Gentle carbonation throughout this tasting, playing off of the flavors with a light to medium texture. A very enjoyable, drinkable beer and right for the occasion... whatever that may be."
"Tastes sweet like the black spots on bananas with nutmeg. Clove and a yeasty snap with swallow. Spicy on the tongue, albiet a little thin. I'm down with anything that tastes like bananas."
" Drinability: Fantastic Dukel and extra tasty very enjoyable"
"Nice blend of mellow wheat and caramel malt with mild banana and spices. Rather good brew. Nice copper/amber pour clouded with the swirled yeast from the bottom of the bottle, big thick head and moderate lacing. Mouthfeel is a touch thin and watery which sure detracts from the nice aroma and very good flavor."
"D - I wouldn't buy it again, but the dark wheat had me curious.. I hadn't seen many around and I was looking for more Hacker offerings because the store had just finished off their Hacker-Pschorr Marzen (Octoberfest) growler filling keg."
"Pours a clean brown color with a decent off white head that stay around a while. Smelled of sweet malts and some citrus. Tasted of a brown ale with a good malty caramel flavor but with citrus flavors coming through as well. I picked up some orange, it was a very nice blend, and went together perfectly. The best part was the nice creamy rich mouthfeel it had, it went down easy."
"D: Oveall a well rounded dark wheat that was balanced quite nicely and drank clean. Really nice experience."
"D: Very nice beer that I'd love to visit again. Good for a summer session."
"D - This is a great tasting Dunkel. I've only seen it one place and I only grabbed one - a decision that I regret."
"D: A solid dunkelweizen, though I've had many better. No problems finishing the bottle, but for this style I'll go elsewhere next time methinks."
"In summary...try this one, you won't be disappointed."
"I don't like weisse beers. Having said that, this beer is extraordinary. Appearance is cloudy mocha brown wih a tight beige head. Tons of lace. Aroma has loads of banana and clove esters that dance ever so delicately with that familiar German melanoidin and bready malts along with floral noble hops. Very complex. Flavor is where it's at, though, with a complex palate-full of banana esters, spices like nutmeg and cinnamon, bready maltiness and molasses cookies or maybe ginger snaps. Flowery noble hops are moderate here but bitterness is just enough to balance everything together. Medium-full mouthfeel with all that suspended yeast and a bit sweet in the finish. This is a treat to drink on tap if you find it."
"I like this beer. Not as much as the Hacker-Pschorr hefe-weizen, though. Still, it's a totally drinkable session beer if you're in the mood for a dunkel. I think it would go very well with a grilled pork chop with apple slices."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. poured a thick, foamy head on a light caramel colored body. Smelled of a typical weisse, with a nice measure of sweetness. Throw banana and caramel in there as well. Taste was along the same lines, with the caramel and sweetness a touch stronger than the smell led on. Interesting that I detected little or no citrus. Exceptionally smooth, very, very easy to drink. Excellent brew."
"D & Notes: I have had this beer before, and I remember it being even better that the one I am drinking right now. The bottle says ""produced on 03/07", which, if this is true, obviously means I don't have a fresh beer in front of me. I can taste the fact that the freshness isn't there any longer, but this is still a very good brew that is complex, and would be a great cold weather beer for somebody who is a hefeweizen fan, but doesn't necessarily want a winter brew that will weigh them down."
"D: This beer is very drinkable, if you like the Dunkle Weisse style, this is definitely one to get your hands on."
"My suspicions of age first arose when a massive head started to form. I poured it gently from there on out, into a pint glass. It looks nice - a brownish orange, full of haze, and while some of the off-white head dissipated, much remained. The nose is a little sour (again, suspicious), but very wheaty. The flavor isn't bad, but it isn't great - it's crisp, somewhat lemony, but otherwise mostly wheaty again. It's quite full in the mouth, while all the carbonations hanging around, so it feels good. I'm guessing that something's not quite right with this bottle, so overall this may not be a fair judge of this brew. I really liked their regular Weisse, but this one's letting me down, but maybe not of it's own fault."
"all in all this is a VERY good dunkel...I must have again."
"D. Fairly drinkable and made for sessions."
"Mike."
"I tried this beer on November 1, 2007 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The beer was a brownish colour with a thick tan coloured head that lasted throughout the beer. The aroma was malt, caramel, and apple flavours. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was a mixture of malt, and apple."
"A fine example of the style. There's enough going on, but not so much that you can't just sit back and enjoy."
"A quality hefeweiss that I will visit again many times..."
"Semi-dry backbite seals the deal, as this is a great dark hefe and I would recommed this beer to anyone to try, not just dunkel fans."
"D: Love my wheat beers this time of year and this is no exception. Really nice example of an unappreciated style."
"D- Is good."
"D - Great tasting beer. Little less sediment might be better, but then again, it's a weiss."
"D-no fireworks here,but overall a very enjoyable Dark Wheat"
"D,notes: I love a good dunklewizen - this one is pretty good but nothing spectacular. The moutfeel was kind of lacking in this one but this did not really hurt drinkability."
"I am sampling this beer out of a 12 oz bottle and into a mason jar. It has a nice dark amber color to it with a nice white 1/2"" head on it. The aroma of this beer is very malty with a touch of banana and maybe some clove. Tasting this beer was a joy it has a disticnt malt taste with a touch of sweet candy sugar and some banana flavor as well. This is a very drinkable beer smooth on the palate, but it has a slight bite at the end. The bite doesn't linger though."
"This is an exceptionally good dark wheat beer that hits all the right notes. The aroma is strong banana, malts, some peach scents, and root beer. This is a slightly cloudy copper color beer with moderate carbonation and light to medium bodied. The taste is malt, root beer, a nice bready grain, mildly balancing hops, and some caramel dash. There is a bit of a bubble gum taste to this beer as well. There is an underlying sweetness to this beer, but overall it isn't that sweet. And the same goes for the dryness as well. This beer is representative of the style and is an essential seeker out if you want a genuine dark wheat beer. L'Chaim."
"D - A very good beer. Two or three would be fairly easy."
"D- A little above average, only a few of these in the evening."
"All in all, just an average wheat beer to me, though I haven't had many wheat beers. It was different in the fact it was my first dark wheat beer. I would recommend it to people to try and see how they like it, but I would probably not buy it again."
"D: Very drinkable as an aperitif , but i think I'll need something else to wash down this glass of liquid bread as my mouth is still dry, maybe a sandwich and some Hofbräu."
"It looks cloudy and brownish like apple cider. Thick long-lasting tan head. I detect some fruity aromas. Maybe banana. Maybe peach. Perhaps a little malty wheaty essence. It tastes smooth with light carbonation and a semi-sweet fruity flavor. Tastes pretty good. Filling beer. I wouldn't take this beer tailgating for a marathon drinking session. Good beer if you just plan on having one or two with a meal... Such as with eggs and toast for breakfast."
"D- This is a good drinkable beer that I will have again. Nice example of a dunkel weizen. I wish this style was as common as the hefe weizen."
"Bottled 3/07. Pours out a murky cloud somewhere between brown and orange. Bright body though with a decent head. Smell is dominated by banana and yeast. Clove and a bready molasses background. Appetizing. A banana sweetness stands out in the taste with a mild hop bitterness riding along underneath. Bready malts are present but a bit more understated than in the smell. A little too sweet for my tastes, although the hops do seem to tug back on the reigns a bit. I expected something thicker, but the carbonation level is perfect and makes for a smooth ride."
"D - Overall an good tasting beer. Flavors are pretty simple but still very solid and traditional."
"D- Maybe slightly heavy for the style (and I like that!). A satisfying, enjoyable beer."
"From my notes 6/7/07 - Pours a two-finger off-white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Yeasty/raisin nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is yeasty and bready, clean finish. 2.90 ($3.97) for a 0.5L glass on-tap from Cafe 7 Numero Heidelberg, Germany."
"Poured from a bottle into a weizen glass. The beer pours a deep amber, forming a very thin bubbly head that fades very slowly. Light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is wonderful!! A strong mix of fruit, wheat, along with a hint of alcohol. The taste is very much the same, beginning with a light malt, and finishing with a full fruity wheat flavor. Very smooth and complex. Nice medium and smooth mouthfeel. Full body and flavor, along with decent abv. makes for one extremely drinkable brew. Overall, In my search for better German beer, this is a big step forward in the exploration of the style. I loved this beer, and will definitely be trying it in the future. Try it!!!"
"I've never liked the dunkel weizens as much as a good ole hefe, but this is pretty good. Heck, I like it better than Hacker-Pschorr's normal hefe. It tastes of dark bread and light toffee without any edge. Very very smooth with a touch of banana and clove. A heck of a drinker."
"Overall impression: Other than the prickly carbonation, this was a great beer - nice balance of flavors, highly drinkable, should go well with food"
"Overall- An excellent beer to drink on the golf course or sitting out on the patio."
"Well carbonated and finishes smooth. Certainly a beer I could drink more often."
"I feel I have had better dunkel weizens that were a little smoother. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: This is my first German Dark Weisse and I love Hacker Pschorr . Very drinkable, especially in the warmer months. I am sold on this style and brand!"
"Verdict: this beer is very true to style, a fine dunkel weizen. No flavors are too extreme, wouldn't call it the best I have tried of the style, but it's pretty good, and very sessionable."
"I have to say that usually a beer is better on-tap. But, in this case, the beer is just as good, if not better in the bottle. Nice mix of banana-clove and caramel with other candyish malts. Nice malt/yeast balance. Delicious and easily drinkable. See my review of it on-tap (two reviews down)."
"another solid offering from hacker. I do prefer the weiss but the dunkel weiss is still good. Pours an amber/orange hue with a huge head with below average retention for its size.... Lots of banana ... lemon ....and is that....it is ... a little caramel hint....unusual for the style... some other florals( a lil clove). PROMINENT wheat...the hops come late....mouthfeel is excellent...grassier than the reg weiss...and not as high on the drinkability...but this still knocks the socks off of most of our domestic imitations...recommended. While some prefer the reg weiss...stating that this has more taste...I disagree...because this is far less consistant for the style...I expected a little more flavor from a dark wheat."
"D: The springy taste of a pale wheats is still there in addition to the carbonation, so the drinkability is lowered."
"Ahh the Mrs. bought me a six-pack of this. I guess I should buy her some flowers or something now. Served in a weizen glass with a murky amber appearance and nice two finger head. Smells of bread with a light smell of roasted malt and hops. Taste is similar to smell bread up front with cloves and roasted malt cutting to just a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is light with plenty of creamy suds, thats the way I like it! This is beer is very drinkable. It would be great summertime beer, for a hot afternoon."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, but it's OK. Overall I like this and could drink it anytime. Not a favorite, but I think that has to do more with my feelings about the style than this particular offering. Pretty good!"
"A nice easy drinking refreshing beer."
"I'm not sure what I was expecting with this one, but overall I wasn't that impressed. It poured a murky brown with little head that faded quickly. Aroma was nice with dried fruits, a bit of banana, and malts. Taste was very thin, just a bit of fruitiness and a malt finish, I was expecting more, and it just wasn't there. Mouthfeel was very watery and not smooth in the slightest. Overall, not great, but not bad, one that I would drink again if someone offered, but not one I'd seek out again."
"You would think that this beer would be thick, but it is much thinner than expected. The aftertaste is sour and not in the way I think the brewer intended. It has too much of an overwhelming alcohol flavor to be the smooth dunkel-weisse I was hoping for. Apparently it doesn't age very well."
"I have to say, this is an attractive beer, dark reddish copper with enormous head, good lacing, decent lacing that doesn't really stick much. Aroma is pretty nice, a musky and spicy clove and some banana. Taste is good, good touch of husky wheat, some nice spices and clove, tasty. Medium body, good carbonation, an easy drinker, 4s across the board."
"Notes: A bit of yeast sediment rolls around this unfiltered brew. I liked this one alot. Simple, smooth (until the finish), and tastes great."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle with bottled on date into a weizen glass. Had the classic dark amber dunkel color with a good head. Smell was awesome with overtones of overripe bananas. Mouthfeel was standard fare. Taste was great - I love dunkels and this ranks up there with the best (Ayinger Ur-Weise). Highly recommend you try and always has a home in my fridge. (4.5,HR,T,Y)"
"Overall, this is quite easy to drink and nice for a summers evening on the porch. This isn't my favorite style, but I think this represents the style quite well. Decent."
"Pours a hazy reddish brown, huge off white head forms, great retention, and great lacing, really looks fantastic. Smell is sweet, little bit of roast, caramel, banana/clove, wheat. Taste is sweet and toffeelike, chocolate, banana and clove, some citrus, very nice and chewy. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, very refreshing and flavourful."
"Pours out a cloudy leather brown with a quickly fizzling head. Head eventually faded out into nothing. Smelled of primarily dark malts with banana following and just a hint of clove. Some bready aromas present. Tastes mirror the smells of this beer with a dark malt forwarded flavor accompanied by bananas. Good banana nut bread flavor that I look for in dunkel weizens. Mouthfeel was pleasantly bubbly but lacked any real body to back it up. Kind of thin. The flavors are all there, but the relatively weak mouthfeel kind of hurts the drinkability."
"This brew pours a brown color with reddish hues around the edges of the glass. The head is massive last long lasting. The aroma is cloves, chocolate malt, and banana. The taste is like the aroma, but with a little less clove. The mouthfeel is a touch lighter than medium bodied, and the carbonation is high and too style. Overall, this is a pretty good dunkel weizen...not the best, but pretty good."
"D- Not as deep and brooding as other dunkle's but still very good. I like a little roastier malt but this is okay. Could be spicier and more citrus notes. Very sessionable and great on a hot day when the thirst seems unquenchable."
"If this stuff wasn't crafted in 1516 by Martin Luther himself (I'm lying) foretelling the birth and brilliance of Richard Wagner (aka the white Redd Foxx)(Again I'm lying.) I'd say it could pass for a jailhouse beer of bread, water and sugar sifted through a sweaty t-shirt. Not that it's a terribly crafted beer but it tastes like Kroger Wheat Bread liquified into a weak cider and then thickened with whole milk. Very malty and creamy but a copper dark instead of the midnite brown I prefer whilst drinking in the hot flames of hell (In fact if I was standing on Satan's shoulders with my skin peeling off I'd drink a schwarzbier.)(Not lying)."
"Pours a cloudy amber brown, with orange hue. Thin head, with decent retention,and nice lace. Smell is wheat and sweetness. Body is medium, with some carbionation. Taste is sweet from start to finish. Not overpowering ar all. Fruit,and spice in the finish. Very very good!"
"Pretty good."
"I used to not like this style much. That's because I was drinking a lot of bad Dunkelweissbiers and didn't know it. Apparently a tough style to get right. This one does. It keeps everything that I like in a Dark German Wheat without letting it dominate the finess fruitiness esters and phenols. Both shine well and compliment eachother nicely. The beer is very bready and yeasty, evident in the flavor and texture. Strong on the banannas and hints of bubblegum, then rounds out with a smooth dark malt flavor. The beer never feels weighted...just light and crisp throughout. Slight astringency from the dark grains come into play late. Very nice beer."
"Overall, this reminds me of Franziskaner Dunkel, although the Franziskaner is better."
"Pretty easy drinking here...just not sure I'd go with this one over the hefe."
"A rather plain brew. Easy enough to drink, but mediocre overall."
"This is my first Dunkel Weisse. Not much aroma initial as it was served waaaay too cold and with a lemon slice. Why do people that know little about beer think that ALL weisse beers should have a slice of lemon. Anyway, there was a slight malt aroma. Not as wheaty as I would've expected. This is, however, a medium to full body brew. I can see myself drinking this on a cool fall day with some game."
"One of the best Dunkel Weiss' around. Easily as good as any from the other ""Munich six"" It's also easy to find, too!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a pint brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"This went down okay, but didn't really do much for me. There certainally better dark wheat beers to be had in germany (Bischoff, Oderdorf & Andech come mind of the top of my head)"
"I think it would be better with more of a hop bite or maybe a tinge more of tartness."
"overall, a very pleasant summer beer, nice balance, not the most remarkable brew ever but solid nonetheless."
"D: I'm not always a big fan of dunkels, but I like this one. Good marks."
"Worth a try."
"D: Quite good."
"Verdict- Very drinkable and easy on the taste buds, but not quite exceptional."
"Carbonation was pretty strong. Soda like in carbonation. I didnt like that. Almost tastes like a Dr Pepper. Fair drinkability. Too many of these beers and bloatiness will take effect."
"Excellent! I loved this beer. Nice wheat aroma up front. Very smooth mouthfeel & taste with a crisp, dry finish. This was more highly carbonated that was expecting going into the tasting. I found it very suitable to the beer, though. This was a very smooth beer, easy drinking & light. I would recommend this to any who like wheat beers & even those who don't!"
"A smooth creamy taste with lots of clove character and good malty backbone, but still quite light on the palate. No booziness. This really was rather sublime. I'd almost given up on this style after having lots of bad bottles from the grocery store, including this brand, but fresh on tap is a whole other story. Brilliant."
"Opinion: I am not the biggest fan of Wheat beers, but the Dunkels are a little easier for me to work into. This beer is really refreshing, and the phenolics are not distracting to me. This is a pretty good beer, and one that I wouldn't mind trying again on draft."
"12 ouces bottle, nice old German chap pictured on the label. It reads, Hacker-Pschorr, Weisse Dark, Traditional Dark Weat. I see... Pours a deep opaque reddish rusted metal color and makes a rocky offwhite head. I like the asymetrical head, always a curious feature to a brew. Aroma brings me to the yeast, oh so much yeast, powdery floral esters, light sweetness, odd hint of wheaty funkyness. Really interesting.. Flavor is a bit bready, and that yeast quality in the aroma comes back again, strong banana and strawberries, spicey cloves, not too shabby. Mouthfeel starts out creamy, but quickly turns into a peppered carbonation all over my mouth, light to medium body and an almost dry finish. Interesting ale, I don't tend to drink too much in the way of wheat beers... however, this one has a few really nice qualities to it. The remainder of the 6 pack will not be going to waste."
"Notes: Since having this beer on tap, Ive had it repeatedly out of a bottle and my opinion of it has not degraded. I find the flavor somewhat smoother and some of the fruit notes more noticeable on tap, but this remains an excellent beer."
"Had this on-tap at Smokeless Joe in Toronto. I hadn't had a Dunkel Weizen in ages, and on tap even! :) Hazy mahogany, with a thick creamy white head, lots of lace. Aroma of cloves and some fruit, definitely inviting. Taste of bananas, with some smokiness and malt coming in second, hint of chocolate crept in and well. The mouthfeel was quite effervescent and full, with the creaminess of a weizen. I think this is one of my favourite draft beers, if not my absolute favourite. I don't think I could drink enough of this."
"This was sampled fresh on tap at Kurtz's Deli in Two Rivers Wisconsin. The 22 ounce glass was a feast for the eyes, the dark red color with ruby highlights, the full pinkish head. The nose was not left out of the equation as the slight fruitiness of the aroma shines through the malt backdrop. A slightly vinious flavor preceeded the malty sweet blast for flavor. The mouthfell was lightened by the wheat and was not as heavy as the color would allow you to believe. Short winey finish. The right beer to drink at this place-yum."
"Muddy light brown colour topped by a creamy tan head. Served in a weiss glass, it left plenty of lacing and maintained its head through to the end. Banana and cloves are prominent in the aroma, and there's a rich chocolate maltiness here as well. Light fruity banana sweetness and a little bit of a doughy flavour. Some dark grain chocolate character and finishes with a round spiciness. Creamy, slick texture and just off-dry at the end. Slight grain astringency. Very enjoyable and not a style that shows up around here very often."
"A solid effort and an enjoyable beer."
"This is a very tasty full flavored beer. It didn't seem as spicy as a hefe-weissen. It would go great with a nice hearty meal or dessert."
"D: One of my favorite examples of one of my favorite styles."
"Had on tap a few months later at Smokeless, much more carbonation which could be them. Fresher, more aroma, so I upgraded my review."
"Bottle says 5.05, guess I'm a month late. The color is a nice chestnut brown with an average-sized head. Not much carbonation or retention. The aroma has a moderate level of clove with a faint underlying body of malt. The taste features a nice interplay between a moderate malt body and an equally moderate yeast flavor. Drinkability is enhanced by this, but the degree this interests me seems to decrease. Very good beer, but I think it could have been better. I'll be looking for a fresher sample."
"I poured this one in a tall Hacker-Pschorr Weiss glass identical to the one in the pic of this beer. It pours a nice light brown with an off-white head. The smell is estery/bananas but is pretty mild. The taste is estery as well with kind of a dry yeasty flavor. The fruitiness of the esters gives it a refreshing quality. The mouthfeel could be better but overall not bad. I don't really notice a lack of good mouthfeel until I get about halfway through the beer. I tends to get a little watery about halfway through. I think overall it is a very drinkable beer. I would recommend trying this or any other of the Hacker-Pschorr brews. There is not a bad one that I have tried."
"Pours a huge white head out of the bottle. I can smell the hefe already. Color is a light brown, dark amber; somewhat cloudy. Smells of yeast, overripe banana (alot of it), banana bread, some spice and brown sugars. Highly carbonted, very refreshing and smooth mouthfeel. Taste is of banana, wheat, and some spiciness. Finishes with a lingering fruity, sweet spiciness."
"This beer is average, not outstanding but no serious flaws. Pours a light brown color. Head is off white, light, and drippy. Smell is mild. Taste is mild as well, slightly hoppy, slightly sweet, and light-bodied. Very drinkable due to its light body. A decent beer, but not spectacular."
"This could be a great session beer."
"Hacker-Pschorr Weisse Dark looks good and tastes good, and I am sure its good for you as well!"
"Pours a murky light brown into my weisse glass, with quite a large head once the yeast has been swirled and poured. The head sticks around for quite some time, never quite going away through the whole experience. The aroma is defininately of wheat and of baking bread. Taste contains hints of bananna, bread, raisins, and overripe apples. Very pleasant. Mouthfeel is very smooth and well carbonated, with just the right amount of oilyness. A very drinkable, very enjoyable ale. The best I've had from Hacker-Pschorr so far."
"Pours a medium brown, cloudy with a smallish head. Smell is malt, molasses, caramel, hint of fruit, bread and yeast. Taste is the same as the smell with alcohol making an appearance on the back end. Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, relatively smooth with decent effervescence. Drinkability is good but this not your typical wheat beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: The thing I like so much about this beer is its unique flavor. It's complex and well balanced without being overwhelming on the taste buds. As for drinkability, I could continue enjoying these all night without a problem simply because of the great flavor."
"Much better than I had expected from the rather unpleasant sounding name. (har har)"
"Pours murky brown with a huge off white thick head. The aroma is yeasty. Malty flavor with hints of banana. Noticeable amounts of yeast. Chocolate as well. Wow, this beer has a lot of flavors. Mouthfeel is a little watery for my liking, but not bad. Highly drinkable. I wish there were more examples of Dunkel Weizens available to me, because its a nice style."
"All in all, another excellent offering by Hacker-Pschorr. Get some."
"This has one of the most crisp bodies of any weizen I've ever tried. It's very refreshing! This would be a great session beer for the times when you and a group of friends have just got done with some hard work. Like, if I had just built a doghouse and wanted to reward myself this is the beer that I would drink a lot of."
"Drinkability: Above average representation of the style which I'd never turn down...or seek out."
"Notes: Decent dunkel, with malt a significant part of the profile. Still, I find it a slight bit lacking."
"Taste is similar to the smell, but not as strong/assertive. Theres more banana, and less banana bread/toffee. Medium-bodied feel. Finish is wheat bitter."
"I found this exceptionally drinkable..I shall be returnin to the store to by a few cases of this stuff."
"A good dunkel-weisse is a wonderful thing, and Hacker's is a sterling example."
"Very nice for style, and a solid addition to anyone's cooler. Good drinkability, and an excellent, all purpose, dark wheat ale."
"Consider this review temporary."
"I really enjoyed the bottle, but wouldn't have more than one in a day. Would certainly entertain the thought of purchasing this again, even though I don't usually tend to purchase wheat beers of any kind. Definitely left an impression."
"A huge, slightly tan-white, firm head collapses unevenly, leaving lava lamp lacing. The beer is a mostly clear, dark mahogany. Spicy citrus notes in the nose, but not much else. The tangy, citrus front is a little acidic. Middle is milky-malty, with slightly cooked caramel. More tangy fruit in the finish: syrupy, but not sweet. This is very good: quite light and fruity; nicely spicy."
"This style of beer is quickly becoming my favorite and this beer is one of the reasons why. Complex, mellow, mysteriously dark and infinitely thirst quenching. Splendid."
"Slighty hazy, tawny gold with an off-white head that holds up nicely. Sweet caramel scent with a hint of clove. The foam tastes nutty and bitter. Nice yeasty, nutty malt with a fruity finish that suggests bananas on the verge of overripe that have been made into banana bread just in time. Some cidery tartness develops as it warms. Pleasant and easy-going."
"Overall I was very pleased with this beer, a good changeup to drinking hefeweisen's. Definately something I would buy again."
"Sampled 2/13/04"
"A good beer in the style, but not something I will repeat all that often."
"Cloudy golden orange with a creamy monster head, citrusy\grassy smell. Wheaty citrus cocktail flavor (banana, orange, grapefuit, even a bit lemony) with a good malty foundation. The carbonation coupled with an additional sugary spicyness makes this almost like a soda in drinkability, it goes down smooth but the fruitiness is a little too pronounced for me compared to others of this style. Still a good beer worth a trip to the corner store (if, that is, you can find it there.)"
"This is perfectly drinkable, but a little on the plain side. This didn't compare favorably with the Franziskaner version of this style that I had last night. Still, it's not bad, just not worth seeking out."
"If a normal hefe, this would have been average, but I expected more out of this dunkel-weisse. Not a bad beer, but just a bit disappointing."
"The beer poured a nice golden brown with a fine tan head that left a good lace. The aroma is of sweet malt flavors with a hint of fire. Then when it hits the tounge you get the full effect of the gently fired malt. There is no hint of hops and the finish is nicely rounded with a cherry taste and a nicely tart back end. The beer is smooth, oily, and just a little bubbly. I'm glad I bought a 6 pack of this beer as I would hate to only drink one at a time. A nice filling dark wheat is always a good find and this definately meets that mark."
"Zum wohl!"
"Sweet wheat aroma with lemon and clove with a touch of chocolate. Hazy brown with a voluminus tan head. Taste is very well done with a typical array of wheat flavors as well as a cocoa note thrown in. Medium-thin, creamy mouthfeel. Tasty and very drinkable."
"This one pours out to the most bizarre color of brown in the glass with a very generous, light brown head. The aroma is that of wheat and malt. The taste is good, with a nutty caramel taste mixing in with the typical weiss, clove/banana flavors. Overall, thirst quenching and easy to drink."
"Another one of my whim purchases. This is a very interesting beer. It beers a dark amber color with a tan head. Smell is very similar to the Hefe only a tad more sweet. Taste is very grassy but is balanced by some citrus and a small hint of malt. Mouthfeel is good, nothing special but good. Drinkability is pretty decent as well. I like this beer a lot and it was worth the experimentation, I just don't see it reaching my top 10 anytime soon. I would also love to try it fresh, maybe i will in 2006... World Cup!"
"This beer poured a murky brown color with a moderate head and left some lacing on the glass. The aroma was very wheaty/yeasty with some citrus - pretty good aroma for a weiss beer. The flavor was a smooth blend of citrus and the wheat. Very enjoyable weiss brew."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It boasts of wheat and caramel malts. It has a average wheat scent with an intense caramel odor. The taste is good. It has a strong dark wheat flavor with a honey type finish. It has a light caramel taste that mixes well and finishes smooth and sweet. The mouthfeel is excellent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation; just right. This dunkel drinks great. It has a smooth taste that goes down easy."
"This is a great beer that I pick up on a pretty regular basis. It doesn't have as strong of a dark, roasted malt component as some other dark wheat beers, but it is highly-drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Had this at the Lucky Dog Saloon today a nice find on tap,pours a murky brown almost tea-like with a big fluffy head that becomes more creamy as it settles.Aroma is lightly smokey and very spicey and anisy with a nice amount of clove thrown in,the taste hits with a bubble gum flavor at first with a nice subtle spicieness to it.A nice flavorful beer,Iam becoming more hip to this style of beer because of brew like this,well done."
"Cloudy orange hue, huge two-finger head, thick and foamy, lacing quite noticeable. Ear shattering carbonation, some spices and banana cloves on the nose. Spicy notes up front, refreshing and cleansing, quite tasty; hangs on the chewy side. Some vanilla beans noted, and some wheat notes, rather sweet for the style. Fresh palate, Munich malts noted towards the end, with a rather dry and grainy feeling, leaves you yearning and itching for more. Great, awesome, fill in the blanks, seek-and-destroy, this baby is awesome!"
"Medium, ""chewy"" feel. It's an easy drinker."
"It's near fucking perfect beer. Something akin to a peppery feel -- cloves, perhaps? -- tingles the tongue while the palate is stimulated by the tiniest hints of oak and those same forceful caramel-banana overtones. It's sweet, but it's not sweet. It's flavorful, but it's refreshing. It's drinkable, but it's got some character. This is unquestionably one of my favorite wheat beers on the planet."
"Mid-brown, slightly hazy, with a light tan head; adequately carbonated. A pleasant strong fruity, yeasty aroma makes for a good start. A mix of flavours are present, including roasted malt balanced out by sweetness (caramel?); quite assertive on the tongue at first, but the aftertaste was less dominating. A good enough beer, quite complex."
"I was surprised to see this on draft at Todd English's. The bartender stuck a wedge of lemon on the edge of the glass, and I promptly and hopefully, politely removed it. It pours a cloudy brown with a fair-sized fizzy beige head. A yeasty, clovey aroma is easy to notice. A damp earthy and hop aroma appears in the background. It's medium bodied, slightly grainy and loaded with mild to faint flavors. Yeasty, and clovey with a bit of banana, coriander and orange zest. A mild lemony bitterness and a faint flavor of limes emerge as the glass warms. The fizzy effervescence and dryness of the brew remains throughout."
"Cloudy syrup brown color with a finger high frothy thick cream colored head that sticks around for a few minutes before crumbling down to a solid skim always present and drippy strings of lace with some minimal stickyness. Secure hefe nose of wheaty toastyness and clove spice with hints of apple skin and banana and some phenolic notes underneath. Taste is a toasted malt forthcoming in a pleasant full softness, playful and fluffy wheatyness with mild spice of clove and small notes of banana and melon husks. Feel is medium bodied with a nice soft fluffyness of nearly full carbonation that floats through the palate with ease and makes for some good drinking."
"Overall an average, enjoyable beer that just fails to stand out."
"Pours a brown chestnut in color in appearance with a thick foamy beige head. Aroma consists of bananas & cloves, with a hint of wheat. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied. Rather nice flavor. Banana, clove and vanilla hit the front. Malt sweetness adds depth the the midtones. Finish is mildly yeasty with some grain and lingering chocolate-banana flavor. Pretty enjoyable overall."
"1 pint, 9 oz. bottle, $3.00 in Omaha."
"A nice brown brew with an ample white head of foam. The aromas hit you in the nose with a 1-2 punch of spices/cloves and bananas. The taste is fruity and spicy all at once, with no alcohol to be found...anywhere! The mouthfeel is light and airy, yet substantial for a dunkel. The drinkability is endless and that's the way that it should be..."
"Cloudy dark chocolate brown with a beige lofty spectacular head. Smells rich of dark malts mixed with esters, wheat, yeast and clove. Taste is smooth and delicious. Banana bread, caramel and a yeast tang all come together seamlessly. Touch of clove on the finish. Enough carbonation to quench my thirst, and this one was gone way too soon. Exceptional style and an exceptional brew."
"Nice drink. Smooth and thirst quenching."
"From the pour to the bottom of the glass, a truely exceptional beer. It has the smell and taste of unpastuerized apple cider and chocolate. This was the thrid brew by Hacker-Pschorr I have sampled, and I have to say it is the best. Average ABV, but a pint of this got me nice and warm."
"Update  I reviewed this beer shortly after joining the site so thought it would be fun to re-review it after having been here over a year and rating 1,200+ beers. Its a solid 4 all the way around. There are just a handful of imports within the style that Ive had that I enjoy better than this, and I think the Ramstein Classic is the only American made one to date."
"Notes: Stellar; thoroughly enjoyed Ayinger's Ur-Weisse the other night and prefer this; not entirely unreminiscent of a toned down Aventinus."
"Poured from a large 500ml bottle. Brown mahogany in color. The beer was cloudy as some yeast was stirred up while pouring. Large glass, but had to be a double pour because the head on this beer was so massive. The creamy white head on this beer kept bouncing back up after every sip and just wouldnt recede. Bubble gum and candy like aroma with some fruits and spices. Maybe some unripe bananas there, too. The taste is like a traditional Hefe, with the added caramel and chocolate flavors from the roasted grains. A very nice dunkelweizen and very drinkable."
"One of my ""old"" all-time favorites that I'm realizing is still good, but not as spectacular as I thought a couple of years ago...still an enjoyable beer I would buy again..."
"Nice deep dark brown color. Shiny. Foamy light brown head, rich and full. Carmel and toffee smells. Candied fruit sweetness. Tastes follow the nose. Sweet candied fruit yeasty earthy tastes follow. Cotton candy and toasted carmel flavors follow. Beer is full of flavors to the end, no watery finish. Light to medium bodied. Very refreshing. Easy to drink and worth a try. A good version of a dunkel weisse."
"Medium brown color, large foamy head. Aroma is spicy and slightly yeasty. Medium bodied German Wheat. Malty and spicy. Lighter taste, yet lots of flavor. Yeasty and citrusy. Nice taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Very drinkable beer."
"Medium dark and cloudy with mammoth rocky head. Aroma is spicy with clove dominating over wheat malt and yeast. Medium bodied and smooth with no noticable bitterness. Flavor is of roasted wheat malt which is on the sweet side. Overall not a bad Dunkel."
"This beer poured a nice dark color for a weisse. It had an estery aroma that was dominated by bananas. The flavors in this beer however seemed not to mix well. Strong banana taste with some clove but there was also a roasted barley flavor. It ended with a slight acidic sourness that did not seem to be in place. I am going to try this again and maybe change my review if I find the next bottle better."
"For a BJCP dunkelweizen I'd put this at about 4.5/5 - could stand to have a bit more fermentation character to compliment the maltiness."
"Smooth drinking and refreshing. Rich sweet muffin like mouthfeel with hints of banana, vanilla and nutmeg. Nice quaffing brew that finishes unassuming and clean."
"This would be great filling an oversized stein... but for pure shock value, a clear glass in a room full of swill-lager drinkers would be classic."
"I would like to try this made into a Doppelbock. As this is pretty good beer. Note: Updating this review. This is one of the most drinkable beers available. Great session beer."
"This beer pours a clear amber tea color with a massive cream colored head. As hard as I tried, I could not keep the head controlled. But thats okay too ;-) It has a very nice wheat aroma with cloves being the next in line to dominate the smell. Very nice! Ive waited some time now, and the head is still 3 fingers and holding. I guess Im going to have a cream colored mustache. The taste is a nice tart wheat flavor with mild but well-balanced hops and tapers into cloves, wheat, and light yeast to finish each swallow. Very nicely done! This complex brew is light to medium bodied and finishes with a light dry clove flavor left on the tongue. I will have this brew again! Prosit!"
"The beer poured a hazy amber brown with a nice white head. The bottle must have layed on its side before I bought it because there was sediment on the cap and on the neck of the bottle. The clove aroma and taste dominates but is not so strong as to overpower. There was a lingering tartness in the finish. The mouthfeel was a little creamy and light. It was a good beer which I have enjoyed but would probably not buy this beer again. The tartness spoils the overall beer for me but I know that it is within style."
"""Oh shit, it's Mister Cleraseaux!"""
"Pours very cloudy burnt orange with an off-white fluffy head that is large and laces well. The aroma is sweet, grainy, yeasty, and some banana as well. It's a very smooth beer, medium bodied, zingy carbonation, malty sweetness, a little bit of hops in the finish. I really enjoy this style. I love hefe-weizens and this style is even more interesting to me. This beer is worth a try for sure."
"Poured hazy brown, nice thick white head, slowly diminishing to a strong lace. Aroma seemed a little off, some sour smell, and something else that just smelled bad. Flavor was of strong banana, and then some strong sourness in the end, which stuck around on the palate for for too long. I wasn't impressed with this one."
"Begins malt sweet, the top middling in mouth feel, the finish tart, somewhat astringent, the hops powerful they strike your Taste Buds, dry lingering aftertaste. Quite a quaffable beer that is well worth the effort to find and sample."
"Poured a decent head, but didn't last. Color is a cloudy, light copper color. Smells of sweat maltiness. Taste was slightly sweet with a bit of fruitiness. Fairly easy to drink. I probably won't buy it again though. Average at best."
"Hazy caramel in color with a light brown foam that cling's to the glass. Taste is a hint of banana with little wheat flavor. Not what I expected in a dark weisse. It is just an average dark weisse beer. I've tasted better and worse. It is smooth and flavorful, but, still lacking for a wheat beer!"
"This is such an incredibly smooth beer to drink. Malt and banana were tasted, as well as toasted grains, maybe a little cocoa, and a slight, perfect amount of bitterness. The yeast in this was perfect! Great brew!"
"Cloudy brown with a thick foamy head.  The head eventually settles to about 1/4 inch, and leaves a trail down the glass. Full of banana and spice esters in both aroma and flavor, with a toasted bread malt.  A touch of nut in the flavor as well.  Slightly thin bodied, with medium carbonation.  This is a very good dunkel weiss, something I like to come back to often."
"Hacker Pschorr:  Big wheat beers are getting to be my favorites, and this is as good as it gets.  Wonderful, refreshing summer beer.  Huge thick head, with a cascade of beer toward the bottom.  Nice hint of banana in the aroma, a little more malt flavor in the taste, but that makes worth the extra buck.  Very nice, very refreshing, and the yeast at the end is healthy as well. Buy it now."
"Cloudy light brown body with effervescent and impressive head that lasts. Smells of clove, banana esters with slight wheat sourness.  Taste similar to aroma, but followed by malty chocolate undertones.  Well balanced dunkel weisse that I would come back to again and again"
"On initial taste you get a blast of citrus (lemon) and yeast followed by a wheat malt finish.  A solid dark wheat beer.  Nice smooth mouth.  The head is constantly 1/4 inch to the end of the brew."
"I did not like this beer all that much as the flavor was a little off to me.  The appearance was nice with a hazy brown color and a good amount of head.  Odors of bananas and grains.  Flavor profile had some cloves, bananas and a dominant flavor that I could not identify but was not really keen on.  I will probably try another bottle from another store to see if it is better, but overall I was a bit disappointed."
"Attractive beer, hazy clove-brown with a good 1 inch head that holds shapes well.  Sweet grainy smell, some roasted nuts.  Estery but also a little back of the mouth chocolate tone along with a little citrus.  Nice light body with full flavors.  I noticed that more sips bring out more lemon citrus, not an improvement, to me.  But, refreshing and drinkable."
"Had this on tap.  Beautiful color.  Murky and muddy.  Copper/bronze tones.  Aroma consist of vanilla bean and banana.  Taste is very nice. The predominant taste that I pick up is vanilla.  There's a nice malt presence too. Hop notes are absent.  And some of the other typical weizen characteristics that are present include cloves, tartness and phenolic character.  Very nicely done."
"Nice, yeasty, fruity aroma.  Billowing white head.  Brown color.  Refreshing, and true to style.  An enjoyable, good beer.  This is a safe beer (and representative) to introduce friends to new beer styles.  Sometimes seems ""light"" with an unsatisfying finish, but still worthwhile."

"Absolutely appetizing in appearance.  There's a tremendous, thick, creamy and persistent head that sits atop of a hazy brownish - orange brew.  The carbonation is high and serves to maintain the ample head and add to the effervesence as well. The classic German weizen yeast aroma dominates, and includes lots of banana, bubblegum, and just a touch of clove.  A slight hint of smooth, perhaps dehusked chocolate malt adds to the complexity.  The body is quite full, due to the high protein content from the wheat (I do feel that residual protein is more important than dextrins in body)  Hop bitterness and flavor is nearly nonexistant, but obviously must be there or this beer would be too sweet.  The brew finishes w/ Munich malt flavors and just a touch of sweetness.  This is a clean,  flavorful and drinkable Dunkel Weisse.  Tasty stuff."
"Not quite as dark as some other Dunkel Weizen beers but a pretty sight in the proper glassware none the less.  Cloudy brown appearance, maybe a notch or two darker than regular Schneider-Weisse. Definitely swirl the yeast in as part of this beer's experience. Nice pillowy tan head. Aroma is of multi-grain bread. Rich mouthfeel with caramel, clove and banana flavors."
"Pours a slightly hazed/cloudy- amber/peach color, generous frothy head, & sheet lace upon the glass. The aroma that I noticed first was that smoke smell, earthy grainy malt, the start is sweet, the middle is medium, as is the carbonation, & the finish is faintly hopped, dry, acidic & overall a pretty decent beer for the the type. I myself can do w/o it, mostly due to the aroma. There are many other Dunkle Weizens I much better perfer then this one."
"What a great beer.  Not as dark as other Weisse Dunkel's, but great flavor and smoothnes.  Creamy head, makes it look just wonderful"
"A nice effort.  A huge head, aided in part by the obligatory swirling of the yeast at the bottom with the last inch of the beer.  The typical banana/bubblegum weisse flavors and a slight caramel flavor to tell you it's a dunkel.  Is it my imagination or have Hacker-Pschorr beers gotten smoother in recent years?  I know their Oktoberfest has . . ."
"Notes: A most extraordinary Weisse beer. For beer drinkers not accustomed to bottle conditioned beers such as this one, it is highly recommend pouring the entire bottle in the glass, including the yeast. The yeast is one of the best parts of this beer, as in it contributes most of the flavour to this beer."
