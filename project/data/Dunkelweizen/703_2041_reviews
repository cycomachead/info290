"This is a very easy drinking beer that goes nicely with food."
""

""

"Delicious! Enjoyed it very much. The Germans know their beer!!"
""
""
"Nice beer... prior to beginning drinking  micro/craft beer I would have said this was great, now with the abundance of amazing local ales most foreign beers have lost their cachet."
""
""
"The bitterness of this offering is not for me..."
"Both thin in mouthfeel and I got only coffee malty aromas and taste rather than fruity/ester weissen. Decent beer but not particularly distinguished or memorable."
""
""
"It has dark brown and hazy colour. It smells bready and roasty malt. Its taste is average comparing with other dunkels. At the end you can feel the bitterness. However, I tasted Erdinger Picantus yesterday.Personally i think that Picantus is better than this dunkel. If you have a chance, you should taste Picantus."
""
""
"A huge fluffy light tan head sits atop a dark brown brew. Smells of banana, citrus, coriander and a bit of pine. The taste does not live up to the promise of the smell. A dull intro is followed up by malts mixed with faint bananas and a bit of spice. Mouth-feel is smooth and light-bodied. Carbonation is fairly active."
"Crisp, smooth and just enough after taste."

"I like this beer and will look forward to my next drink."
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good, above average even but it is not the best you will come across and not as balanced in the flavour as I would hope for."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice Dunkel! This has a surprising amount of carbonation, that helps push out the toasty malt flavours. It's not overly complex or layered, just tasty. Once you get past the yeast/corn nose and let this sit in your mouth, you can appreciate the overall balance of the Erdinger Dunkel."
""
""
""
"It smells great and tastes nice."
""
""
"Average dunkelweisen. Sweet malt, raisins, dates. No trace of hops."
""
"Decent, but no Weihenstephaner."
""
"Tap one is better than bottled"

"O: unless this was an old beer this was a horrible beer and I poured half of it out"

"Lite and refreshing. A perfect dark wheat brew. We love it down here in The Bahamas!"
"Review according to BJCP2008 guidelines (style 15B). Bottle 50 cl - batch L041107. AROMA: faint wheat, caramel and vanilla notes. no hop aroma. APPEARANCE: dark brown color and opaque. thick tanned head with good retention. TASTE: some faint inappropriate roasted notes. faint wheat background. low bitterness. finishes somewhat sweet. no hop flavours. PALATE: medium-light body with some creamy sensation. moderate carbonation. OVERALL: a not very malty nor fruity nor spicy weizen."
""
"Quite tasty and refreshing. It's very crisp and highly carbonated, which sharpens the otherwise smooth and rich maltiness. It's definitely more dunkel than weissbier, but style aside, it's still really delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy"

"Drinkable but nothing special - about par for Erdinger. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are decidedly lacklustre. Caramel and light wheat notes with some yeastiness - muddled and indistinct. So-so body. Goes down without complaint but a pretty forgettable dunkel - no need to hunt it down."
""
"Overall this is a great mild beer for someone not looking to adventure outside the box. This beer is sweet with not a lot of carbonation. Don't let its dark haziness fool you into thinking this will be too rich. This is a very easy beer to drink and it gets extra points because of its cheap price."

"Roasted malt and wheat flavors dominate with a definite hint of fruity sweetness. Refreshing and easy drinking. I enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle.  Aroma of hay and herbs.  Pours very dark brown with big head.  Very mild bitter taste.  Full bodied, oily texture, with lively carbonation.  Overall it looks like a dark beer but tastes quite close to other weizen beers."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Who would have thought serving temperature affects the beer? ... At least I got another reminder with this tasting experience. Served at the proper temperature this was a nice balanced brew that focused on the malt profile and let the esters play second fiddle. Clean and well brewed, good drinkability. Personally I think I'd prefer a Dunkel with more emphasis on the yeast produced flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was actually a great beer. However, it was not a very good example of what I expect from a dunkelweizen. I wonder if this beer wasn't fermented at the low limit of the temperature range for its yeast."

"Picked this up at Oak Barrell in Hagerstown. Excellent looking beer, darker than many which I liked, had that delicious look. Smell was odd, more of a caramel than wheat. Taste was outstanding, very smooth and easy to drink. This was quite the surprise, I liked it very much but may not buy often as others I like more that cost less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I've never thought that the wheat and dark malts have worked all that well together, except in rare circumstances. This is lacking that special quality, but still tastes pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: my first dunkelweizen ever happens to be very flavourful, though one-sided, while being simultaneously drinkable -- this beer went down ridiculously fast. definitely wouldn't mind having more in the future"
""
""
""
""
"Body medium, watery, lively carbonation"

"My mark out of one hundred would be 78."
"O - I enjoy this style, so even though it is bland by the standards of the style, I like it. I just with it had some spice to it. It is easy drinking, but I'll stick with my favorites in this style."
"Overall, a very good German wheat beer, but not quite good enough to advance to the head of the class. The flavor is a bit mild and the phenols and esters don't run quite deep enough. Still, one heck of a nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- I nice lighter version of a dunkel, I enjoyed the added raisin notes and enjoyed this much more than Erdinger's regular hefe. A very affordable beer as well, a quality pint of beer for 2 bucks is always welcomed."

"O - A deep inviting beer for those that like this style. Easy to drink even though many will be put off by its dark appearance. Although I prefer other Erdinger beers as this one feels a bit too heavy on the taste buds."

""

"Overall: I sometimes get caught up in the world of American craft beer with something new coming out every day and forget about some of the really great beers that have been around forever. The darker fruits in this beer really shine through. All the traditional Hefe accents one would look for."
"Taste starts out slightly metallic but not so much that it ruins the beer, roasted malt with a toffee like backing comes, huge carbonation that just explodes in the mouth like a cola, it's quite distracting and thins out the beer."
""
"MF – Medium-light bodies, semi-dry finish, rather thin but well carbonated and bright in the mouth. 3.0"
"O - Looks great but slides downhill thereafter. I wouldn't bother with this one again."
""
""
"Overall - A nice easy beer. A rather safe and low on flavor version, yet its still a pleasure to drink. Not a world class, or well done version of this style but its certainly worth drinking for anyone that wants a easy drinker with low alcohol and still can cover the craving of a good, solid craft beer."

"O- I am admittedly in love with this beer. So much so that I plan to pick a few bottles up the next time I go to purchase beer. Erdinger Wessbier has no doubt become my favourite wheat beer."

"500 ml. bottle. Dark almost opaque colour, with a average head that does not hold for too long. Smell is wonderful: prunes, dark fruits, toffee, peaches and hints of chocolate. Average body, taste is almost the same as smell, maybe with some roasted grain notes. It was the new 5.3% version."

"Had a bottle at a beer parlor in Calgary's Kensington area. This dark wheat offering pours a murky opaque brown, almost like coffee with just the faintest hint of cream mixed in. Aroma was dark malts and hefe yeast all the way, no discernible hops but a decent amount fruit and spice, a bit like pumpkin pie. Palate was big chewy dark malts and yeast phenols, I get a lot of stone fruit (cherry, plum), raisin, and toffee/irish creme flavors with a healthy dose of spicy clove and some toasty notes that are not out of place in the sea of dark malt and yeast. Body is chewy and rich, albeit thinner than a huge doppelbock or the like. The rich malty character and spicy yeast leads the way but there is a decently bitter finish that includes some herbal hops (but you have to look for this) and syrupy booze. Solid German wheat beer albeit more coarse and perhaps ""rough around the edges"" than some other examples. Would have liked to see the sweet flavors pop out a bit more."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy!"
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer isn't much to look at. Also, unlike a good Weissbier, the taste of this beer is fairly one dimensional (sweet malt). The beer looks and taste like Dr. Pepper. Weird."

"Light to medium body. Leaves a yeast residue in the bottom of the bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A fine beer, but nothing out of the ordinary for the style. However, always worth drinking especially if a certain other legendary German brewer does not have their dunkelweizen in stock."
""
""
"O: this is okay, I certainly would try again, but I'm not incredibly impressed overall considering how much I normally like wheat beers."
""
""

"Overall - 4/5"
""

""

"A nice flavorful beer, although not quite what I was expecting. A bit sweeter than I would have guessed, but not overly so. It does go down easy, and is worth trying."
""
""
"O: It's one the most well-balanced beers I've ever tasted, makes you want to drink one after another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A light body dunkel with good drinkability, though I found the other Erdingers more interesting."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is light and the finish is easy. It's extremely drinkable and really a treat. I would have this many times again."
""
"Mouth feel is full bodied. Good thickness and well rounded. High carbonation. Easy to drink and very pleasant. No astringency."
""
""
""
""
"O-definitely not how an authentic German should be tasting. Still though, it's an enjoyable beer by all means. I just expect a lot more in terms of raw flavor."
""
""
"O - Really good,i like it."
"Overall an okay attempt but this is really an example of how bland some wheat beers can get."
"Poured a 500ml bottle into an Imperial Pint glass. Fairly short-lived creamy light tan head (probably due to the glass used), but it did linger and leave some lacing. Nice deep brown (almost black) and no light gets through. Not much aroma detected, but had a nice roasted malt taste, with coffee and little bitterness on the finish. Had a nice mouthfeel, as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: First ever dunkel but I'd gladly try more. A good beer that I'd drink again."
""
"500 ml bottle into signature weizen glass, best before 9/2013. Pours very hazy dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice rocky cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, banana, clove, pear, apple, brown bread, wheat, pepper, floral, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malt and ester notes. Taste of caramel, chocolate, banana, clove, brown bread, wheat, pear, apple, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, banana, clove, pear, apple, chocolate, floral, brown bread, wheat, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and yeast esters, with good robustness of flavor; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish as expected. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a moderately creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice dunkelweizen! Very nice balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable well rounded example of the style."

"Pours a hazy dark brown with an impressive tan head, that has good staying power as well as lacing. A visually impressive pour. Aroma is wheat and ""German"" yeast forward, although with some caramelized and roasted dark malt undertones. Very rarely do I pick up on ""toffee"" that many others smell, but even I can find it in this nose. The sweet flavour is rather simple and uninspiring, but true to form. Caramel notes and some roasted malts, but I find the wheat and yeast typical of this style pretty overwhelming. As I'm not a big fan of either flavour, this is the first time I've purchased this beer outside of Germany."
"O: The tin flavour just takes it all away for me. Not all that great of a wheat dunkel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Load of citrus and dark fruits contact the palate sensation. Bready malt and hint of roasted malt participate with some spiciness. The body is medium with smooth mouthfeel and dry finish. Pretty good overall."

"O- I was very disappointed by this beer. Fortunately I drank it after finishing my excellent Austrian meal so it did not get in the way of that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"No spectacular beer..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is light and easy to drink but does not have the same strength of flavor and aroma that some other examples have in the style. This is a very solid beer but not anything special."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the depth to the grain profile in both the nose and taste. If we had one complaint, it was that the nose was a bit too light. We wish that it popped more right from the time of opening the bottle. The flavoring was robust enough, and was well balanced among the complexity, for a nice treat."
""
""
"Overall: This is definitely a great brew, having this during a barbeque [priceless]. Drink up and enjoy, Salud!"
"This is good stuff, quite nice to drink. Wouldn't rank it up with Weihenstephaner, for a couple setbacks. It doesn't have the same depth of standout flavour, and the mouthfeel while pleasant, is far less full and has more of a thin carbonation aspect. Still worth trying, and nice drinkable stuff."
""
""
"i liked this one. on sale at the duty free fridge in delhi, india. poured a reddish brown color with a glorious rising off white head. smells like fruity yeast, german malts of many varieties, and a touch of hops. flavor is nice, very well balanced without the sweetness that usually comes with this style. more of an amber taste to me, with the wheat malt being playing more of a supporting role. notes of caramel and banana also present themselves in turn. feel is a little light i think, but i liked this beer a lot despite that. its got relaxed bubbles and a long complex finish. i could have drank quite a number of these if i had more rupees. good juice!"

"Pours an opaque dark brown with a 2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat, caramel, and some yeast aromas. Taste is of wheat and caramel mainly with some slight yeast flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy drinking but nothing really stands out with this one."
""
""
""
""
"D - A decent representation of the style, but even in my limited exposure to Dunkels I've certainly tasted better. Just an average, run-of-the-mill German brew, but a drinkable and solid one at that."
""
"Not a bad offering from the world's number one Weissbrau."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy brown with some ruby notes, 2 fingers of eggshell coloured head, some lace. Smell is malty with some dark breads, grainy wheat with a slight roast, also a metallic like scent was present at first but as it warmed became non existent. Taste is malty, dark breads, chocolate, faint flavours of bruised banana, light smokey roast flavours in the finish as well. Medium carbonation, medium body, odd grainy rough feel on the palate. This is just OK but nothing about this really comes together for me, honestly cant picture a situation where I would have this again."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is Pretty good, a little to much Carmel flavor for me... Won't turn it down but won't rush to buy it again... After all, I really like beer. It was about 3 1/2 dollars at the local beer store in Calgary. I tend to think there's probably many other beers that are a better bang for the buck."

"O: I was very surprised with this one. I have not been a strong fan of their standard hefeweizen and didn't expect much. The sample at the brewery definitely would rate up their with the best of this style that i have tasted."
""
""
""
""
"What a wonderful beer indeed. Highly recommended."
""
"Overall - Not bad, but not great. Reminiscent of something like Negra Modelo, but with more of a wheat-like profile."
""
""
""
"O- A good dunkel for a good cheap price."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a wine goblet. Impressive head am deep brown ruby brown color. Smell is not aggressive but can smell malt over wheat. Sweet like brown sugar influenced by the malts. Some wheatiness but not like most jefe style. Mouthfeel is light to medium with an appreciated carbonation in there. Overall a nice dunked jefe and certainly sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into a snifter, best before 03-2012. This pours a dark brown almost black with a large foamy Mocha colored head. The smell is a little weaker than expected, a little wheat, roasted malts, coco. The feel is medium to light with high carbonation. The taste is okay, wheat spices dark malts."

"O - A nice example of a classic German dunkelweizen. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
""
"I think this ones an industry stranded for a Dunkel, nothing too be ashamed of but nothing worth searching for"
""
""
""
""
"O - Well rounded dunkel from a classy brewery."
"O- Very different than other dunkels, but this is the ""World's most popular Weissbier Dunkel"" for a reason, it's damn good."
""
""
""
""
"Not my bag baby but not terrible, like Warren Beatty said 'nice'"
""
"Drinkability is fair. It's a good occasional choice."

"D: I like how this beer feels in the mouth, but the flavor dissapoints. It seems to be very one dimensional in flavor with roasted coffee overwhelming the tastebuds. I probably wouldn't buy another bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: ridiculously refreshing. not a ton of flavor here. a touch of roast there and touch of fruit here. overall a refreshing, highly drinkable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is well-made and very clean tasting, but I find it too clinical and bland. You would not know you were drinking a German wheat beer. Very uninteresting."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, quite roasty with nice coffee notes. In the taste, a small roast with notes of coffee, and some lingering hints of wheat and lemon citrus. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry citrus and coffee like aftertaste. Nice coffee roast, and a refreshing lemon citrus to back it up."
"There’s a date of 3/2012 so this should be considered fresh enough, but I feel like something has gone wrong here. This just seems off especially for the always by the book Germans."
"Taste - Roasty and bready with soft fruit and spicy cloves."
"o - Not nearly as comples or flavorful as other German Dunkels, but smooth and very drinkable. Not the best but a pretty good example of the style."
"Overall just a good beer and not much else. Had it on tap at the Oktoberfest held in Grand rapids and was much fresher there and had a crisper body. There wasn't much I could pick up on this beer otherwise, but it wasn't bad."
"O: This is a solid dunkel. I would definitely revisit this again if I'm in the mood for a dunkelweizen."
"o - nothing spectacular here. it is quite drinkable but i wish it was more dense - that's just my taste. solid brew and worth a shot if this sounds good to you. i won't be getting this one again"
"O: not bad, first I've had of this type, subdued flavors, easy to drink. More exciting than the very light wheat beers."
"cross-posted on http://booksbitesbrews.blogspot.com"
"Overall, it is just an ok beer. Lacks depth of flavor yet is smooth and drinkable."
"Overall, this was a good experience. I'm not sure exactly when I would have this kind of beer, as it isn't exactly a summer thirst-quencher. Still, it's worth a try and generally quite easy to find."
"Overall I was pleasantly suprised with the quality of this brew. At 2.99 it's alright but in the town over for 2.49 it is better."
"Final Grade: 3.61, a B."
"Overall: Very nice beer"
"O- MILD! This is the boringest Dunkel I've ever had, nothing stands out. This is just as bad as the hefe, scratch that it's definitely worse. I guess I should of expected this."
"Will look for again."
"O: A very nice wheat beer that is an easy drinker any time of year. I like the added malt, as I am not typically a wheat beer fan."
"O - Overall, it started off looking and smelling like a winner, but finished with a fizzle. Certainly nothing to sneeze at, but I had higher expectations and hopes."
"Cheers!"
"O - A suberb beer. First time trying - would drink again."
"Overall: Very sessionable. I have had mostly hefes lately; I had forgotten just how much I enjoy this style. Smooth and inviting."
"O - Not bad at all but lacks that nice banana/ bread, cloves punch I like about the style - nice on a hot day though."
"Overall- When I first tried this one I loved it a little more, but now as my palate is growing more refined it doesn’t hit the same notes that it once did, although don’t get me wrong this is still a very quality wheat beer and probably one of my favourites. It is still one of my go to’s when in search of a good wheat beer but it’s just not in the same high regard it once was when I first started trying new beers."
"Solid dark hefe, clean and refreshing."
"This beer pours a clear, very dark, brown with 2"" thick head and lace lasting to the finish. It's aroma has hints of banana, dark chocolate, and bread. The flavor is very well balanced between banana, chocolate, malt sweetness, and hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium, smooth, and has the right amount of carbonation. Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel is an outstanding beer, very drinkable, an excellent example of the style. Highly recommended!!"
"Mouthfeel: Creamy and buttery"
"[The average of my two reviews is a B.]"
"Pours very dark brown with fizzy mostly white foam. Little stickiness very pleasant malt bouquet. Notes of chocolate and toffee. Rich malty chewy taste, like a liquid candy bar. Sweetness implied but not powerful. Firm carbonation. Altogether flavorful blend, very tasty. Excellent."
"Overall this was about as solid as it gets. A tremendously good beer that I would love to be able to try again."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"O - I really enjoyed this beer and well worth a try"
"Overall this Dunkelweizen was average at best. The flavor and aroma seems muted and were not as full as they should be. The typical flavors I would expect from this style were there but they were muted and overpowered by dark fruits and tartness. I have been disappointed with Erdinger, both beers I have had from them never meet my expectations, I am weary about trying any other brews from them. I wouldn't buy this again, there are much better dunkelweizens out there."
"O: Really great for me. I thought this was one of the best of the style that I have had. I gotta get out and try more."
"This is a classic Dunkel however I would say it was less than I had hoped in flavor."
"Overall - At first this tasted a little bit harsh, but it seemed to mellow out as I progressed through my glass. It's a fairly decent beer but there are so many better options within this style category I'd rather be drinking."
"D: I don't have any other Dunkelweizen to compare this to, but it seems like a pretty solid representative of the style if not very complex."
"Not much of a beer. It's inoffensive, but that's a pretty short list of positive attributes. No need to try this again."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of banana and spices. Taste is somewhat mild, malts, some banana, not really as much clove or spice as I expected. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a pretty good beer."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy with lots of fine carbonation. Very drinkable. I coould drink these all night."
"Easy enough to drink but not something I can imagine buying again. Just not enough character to the flavor or the aroma to make it worth the expense. Pity."
"Scented nose, dried fruits of Autumn but no real coffee beans instead of wheat, but light enough compared to other weizenbieren. Fairly light body with a little acidity significantly. Aftertaste which is reminiscent of jam, both bitter and slightly sour, with an aftertaste found in nuts finely. A good model for the kind Dunkeweizen but without transcending it."
"D - This one got really dull after a while. Wouldn't buy this again."
"D - Good drinkability. The thick creamy appearance and mouthfeel are this dunkel's strong points. It's not so competitively priced where I'm from, but I definitely wouldn't turn down a free glass."
"This is my first dunkel and I find it an extremely interesting take on wheat beer. After several samples, I can't quite put my finger on what I like about it, but I definitely like it."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas. It's an overall good beer."
"I might have to explore the Erdinger library more. This is the 2nd beer from them (that I've had) that deviated from the fruity weizen notes and focused more on the body and spice character. While that can be both good or bad, it's a solid change of pace. Unique and tasty stuff!"
"Pours a beautiful deep brown color with a fluffy tan head. By appearance, one of the darkest dunkels i have seen. Smells of wheat with dark fruit. Taste includes some nuttiness with that great dark wheat background. Mouthfeel is medium. Drinkability is great. A well crafted and delicious beer."
"D: I've had this one before but it seemed to have less flavor this time around. Nothing really stands out with this beer but it's still decent. I'd recommend to try it at least once."
"I had this beer in Germany and at a German restaurant in China. The first time on tap and the second time poured from a bottle into a glass. It was almost like a dessert with a creamy taste, extraordinarly smooth. This time from a bottle. It wasn't as good as I remembered but still a high quality beer. It still had the characteristic barley smell with chocolate/sweet notes and went down smooth. Definitely good for a session."
"D- Easier than some, but still heavy boddied and filling, Good though."
"One of the most drinkable beers I've had lately. Nice dark flavors with some Hefeweizen characteristics make it refreshing and a tasty alternative."
"Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel has a brown colour and an excellent 2 cm head that lasts. It smells more like a typical wheat beer than a stout. The taste is slightly sweet at first and malty and the finish is quite grainy. This beer is quite thick in the mouth. This beer is very tasty and drinkable."
"Overall, kind of disappointed even though I didn't have huge hopes going into this one. My girlfriend likes the Erdinger Hefeweizen and so she was drinking that while I had this and honestly, hers had more flavor than mine! What's that about? I didn't care for this one. I would give it a try just to say you had it but don't expect much."
"Drinkability: It doesn't excite but it certainly manages to go down... undetected (in the, rather, positive sense of the word). I've already drunk two today and I could go on with more."
"Excellent beer, reminds slighly Czech dark lager beers and red stouts, very smooth, spicy and aromatic. Didn't try neither cask or on-tap versions , but the bottle version is great. The colour is nice, a little bit reddish, but generally a very good appearance."
"D - A very Enjoyable Dunkel that is a classic example of the style. I could have a few of these in a sitting, if the mood was right. I can only imagine that this would be sublime on tap at the source."
"D: I found this one to be disappointing. I don't know if the bottle was old or what, but the flavor was really not very good."
"This beer is ok at best I would say the appearance is a dark brown with reddish hues the head starts out huge very bubbly then quickly disapates leaving little lacing. The smell is mild with a light malty odour. The tast is light also with a malty flavour but to me tastes more watery than it should. Mouthfeel is this beers strongest point as it is so watery it doesn't feel harsh or overly alcoholic. Overall I wasn't thrilled by this beer as I hoped I would be but at the same time I wouldn't turn it down if someone gave me one."
"D Very good drinkable beer, easy to have one after the other. 4  "
"cheers"
"D - Decent. Nice flavours mixed with a nice ABV. Refreshing in a different light."
"Pours a very dark, yet slightly clear fizzy color with a light tan head. Really nice body and good lacing. The aroma is lightly aromatic with some chocolate notes, maybe some banana esters. Flavor is light and a little bland for me. Really doesn't have the chocolate banana flavor I look for. The mouthfeel is nice with some fizzy qualities but it's over carbonated and tastes too dry and boozy. Drinkability isnok, not the best example I have tasted."
"Pours a murky chocolate brown color with a soapy tan head that settles into a light ring. Head retention was fairly short and left no lacing. The aroma is of a wheat malt with some metallic notes as well a light banana. Not too much in any yeasty goodness. The taste has a banana creme pie thing going, which I am not too wild on with hefes or dunkels. The metallic characteristic can be found in the flavor as well as some vinous notes. There is some milk chocolate flavors towards the end which smooths out the profile and is nice. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, which cuts through the body; sweet throughout on the palate. I would like to see more yeasty phenols in this beer but the flavor is not bad. It drinks easy and is refreshing."
"Pics here: http://wp.me/pNKWo-1cG"
"Pours a amber-brown colour with white head. Head takes a while to dissipate, but no lace on the glass. Smells of dark fruit with some of the regular wheat beer characteristics. Flavour is quite sweet, but a little lacking. A bit thin mouthfeel. Easy beer to drink, but not a favourite of the style."
"Erdinger Weissbier Dunkle Good stuff here"
"D - Easy to drink. Like Erdinger's Hefe-Weizen it's another good brew but it doesn't stand out."
"M: Nice body, balanced flavor with some bitterness at the end but mostly acid as a good wheat beer, refreshing feeling and easy to drink."
"d - good balance of pure beer flavours, flowing nicely from rich malt to crisp bitter, an all around enjoyable beer"
"D: Fairly drinkable, and the ABV is pretty reasonable."
"This beer is a good beer. It's not great, but not bad. It's missing some normal dunkel notes and ends up being just like other Erdingers, average and very drinkable."
"Erdinger Weissbrau Brauerei--Erdinger Hefe-Weizen Dark--All Natural Bottle-Fermented Dunkel--Wurzig Aromatischer Weissbiergenuss--2010 16.9 oz. Bottle. 5.50% ABV. 10 IBU's? (3.5 / 5.0) Dunkel Weizen. Big foamy thin mild lace light tan head. Cloudy dirty red black brown color. Tight Bottle Conditioned sediment. Mild wheat ester toasted fruit hint front. Slightly creamy mild sweet light toasted clean dark fruit smooth Hefe wheat body. Light refreshing clean Dunkel end. Delicatly fruity. Not a favorite style, but very drinkable. Sampled 7/3/2010. 2 @ $2.59 Each."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect pint. It's a cola brown type color. Pours with a a thick white head with many different sized bubbles. It took a few minutes to go away, but once it does, it's gone. No real lacing to it, there is a slight ring around the very top. Not a whole lot going on with the smell. Little bit of dark fruit, doesn't quite have that almost banana smell that some dunkelweizens tend to have. The taste also isn't very strong either, almost a little bland. A little sweet and malty along with bready and yeasty. As mentioned earlier nothing jumps out at out at you, but I will mention that it does taste ""pure"" like several German beers. Never really been a huge fan of the mouthfeels of these beers, don't like the texture that much, so with that I think it's pretty average from any I've had. Despite that it's pretty drinkable. All in all an ok beer. Nothing very unique about it, it is what it is, not bad."
"D: The beer is rather easy to consume, although there's nothing particularly special that would definitely make me want to have another one."
"All in all, a good beer to try."
"D-it's definitely not a terrible beer, but not a great example of the particular style IMO; definitely drinkable but leaves you wanting a bit more spice because it is a very flat beer in terms of overall depth; worth a try, but probably won't be seeking it out again"
"D: This is a great beer that I could have a lot of. Good taste, but still relatively light bodied. A good beer even on a hot day in Bulgaria."
"Mouthfeel is mdium bodied, semi sweet and dry."
"Poured the last inch to the drain. If only because I had another beer waiting on deck."
"All the flavors are in the right place, but maybe a bit thin and simple. Could stay on this a while, though."
"Not a bad Dunkel, but a bit darker than most i.e. the roasted malts are more obvious here. Preference in this category would be Hofbrau Dunkel but this is great to drink regardless."
"Feels nice in the mouth, with the carbonation being below average for the style, but still crisp. A decent glass of beer, though flawed in (IMHO) the most important places."
"Higher ABV than I would have thought for this one after tasting it. Drinks pretty easy, but there isn't as much to taste as I would have expected. I'd like to try some other beers of this style to see what the best are supposed to be like."
"Pretty drinkable. I don't think I like it enough to be motivated enough to have more than one at a time, though."
"I drank it. Didn't dig the sweet part of this and all of the elements missing from traditional versions of the style. With all of the other good, complex and easily available versions of this beer out there, there is no way in hell I'd seek this out for another go. Again, it was drinkable, but falls far short of others."
"It is a very easy drinker and the sweetness only slightly hinders that."
"Taste: Noble hops play a bigger part of the taste than I was expecting. Dark malts and a little banana after the noble hops have faded from my palate."
"Nothing outstanding here, just a solid offering. Very plesant brew."
"Dark brown pour. Heady beige foam atop. Spices, peat, and roasted malts in the nose. Flavours include sweet candy malts, a subtle spiceyness, with mild earthy peaty flavours in the finish. Medium light bodied, with a somewhat watery finish. No trace of the ABV. Pretty good Dunkel."
"Notes: Nothing remarkable but it is one of their better offerings and makes for a fair dunkelweizen."
"D: A Dunkelweizen is always a nice experience. This one was a bit to light in taste and smell to be a top-beer for me."
"Overall, I'd go with the regular hefe-weizen anytime."
"But anyway a good and well made beer."
"D - This is a very enjoyable beer with nice yeast character and a touch of dark malt that adds color and complexity to the beer without overwhelming it in caramel sweetness. I particularly like the way that the yeasty clove flavor in the finish compliments the sweet toast and toffee flavors of the malt. A nice example of the style and an enjoyable, refreshing beer."
"D: I've had better dunkels, better hefeweizens, and have even had better dark hefeweizens. This has almost no relevance to hefeweizens as far as my palate is concerned. This isn't a terrible brew, but it's just lacking in complexity. For those who like dark, malty brews, check this one out. Those who prefer their hefeweizens taste, smell and feel like hefeweizens, this one is probably not what you're looking for."
"Almost void of flavor aside from some chocolate malt and faint hefe yeast. The carbonation is soft, the finish is quick and clean, but in the end, it just doesn't deliver."
"Overall: Excellent example of a dunkelweizen - as expected."
"Drinkability: really, quite drinkable, if a little sweet. I could definitely have a couple of these over fried food at a pub."
"Had a pretty damn good mouthfeel. Decently good drinkability. I would have consumed another had I purchased more than one."
"Very easy to drink.. like it.. and will drink it again.."
"D: Fairly easy drinking. This dark wheat is enjoyable in all seasons. The dunkel imparts a more hearty feel for cold weather months, but also has a refreshing quality during the summer as well. Goes well with schnitzel, sausages, even seafood. Or just enjoy by itself on a relaxing weekend afternoon."
"Pours dark brown with a fluffy white head. Strong caramel malt presence in aroma as well as the flavor. Slight smoke presence in the flavor as well. Light-medium body and a very easy drinker. Medium carbonation. Drank this with some homemade venison German sausage and it was outstanding."
"Even though I suffered through the overly light taste, the mouthfeel was surprisingly thick for that, and felt sediment-thick instead of creamy thick. Not a bad beer, necessarily, but not one I would drink again."
"Lacks any real substance or bold flavors. Quite embarrassing when compared to other German dunkels. May be a bit better when fresh from the brewer, but having tried other Erdinger brews, that's quite an assumption."
"D: Quite an easy beer to drink. The flavor certainly isn't blow-your-mind or anything, but overall it's a good beer."
"D: Not a bad beer, I don't know how this comapres to other dunkels but I wouldn't be resilient to try them. Very tasty if you enjoy the taste of the darker fruits."
" Smooth, tasty, and very, very drinkable."
"of all the dark wheat beers, this is the probably my favorite ""every-day"" beer. It never disappoints. On tap, its even better."
"A highly drinkable dunkel, not my favorite, but certainly worth a go. I'll keep an eye out for this one on tap (and will make sure I let it warm a little next time!)"
"D: Very tasty, the best Erdinger i have proven."
"Mouthfeel is good, medium bodied, smooth, no aftertaste. Drinkability is high, as it should be. A pretty good beer."
"D - I thought this was a pretty damn good Dunkel easy to drink with a good taste is a thumbs up in my book worth trying sometime"
"Final Thoughts: Well this was my first Dunkelweizen and I have to say, I'm a fan. I've really taken a liking to wheat beers, and this one is no exception. If you are a hop head, you will not enjoy this beer, however I am a bit of a sweet tooth, and that really comes out with this one. Great dessert beer, or something to have by the fireplace."
"Very carbonated mouthfeel with a slightly watered down body. Very prominent spicy clove flavor with some roasted malt along with strong citrus peel flavor. The bready yeast notes aren't as strong as I would like, resulting in the slightly watery feel. Also, not as much chocolate malt as expected. To me it just seems like a dark hefe that's slightly roasty with a lot of clove and lemony zest."
"I had it cold, and drinkability very good, taste average. Smell was almost like a weaker beer shoud smell, if that makes sense."
"The drink was also satisfying but unmemorable. It goes down fine but doesn't really leave any stong lasting impressions. And that's the beer itself. A good beer with simple, consistent and subtle flavors that is too carbonated and at times, perhaps, a little too subtle."
"Very easy to drink."
"Overall: Looking at other reviews makes me question my particular bottle's quality. It's drink before date is still months away, so I am not sure. Judging from this bottle, I would say this beer isn't worth the time. However, it comes from a respected brewery, so I will try to get another and re-review it soon."
"Overall, a good dark Hefeweizen, maybe slightly too light and intense than desired."
"1pt. 9fl. oz. bottle served in a .5l weizen glass. 11-2009 printed on the back label. Poured a deep garnet color with red highlights when backlit. Incredible, rocky, khaki-colored head occupied three quarters of the glass as it slowly cascaded and receded into a quarter inch cap. Delicate, cloud-like clumps of lacing were revealed during the session. Nose was malty sweet with dark fruity esters. Taste consistent with nose, but a little more muted and balanced with a subtle, bready quality that formed the backbone of the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium/light with a consistent, lively background effervescence from start to finish. Easy drinking brew - not much complexity but very flavorful and sessionable."
"Great beer, and one that never has let me down."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this one is a little darker than most others I've had in the style, but it's a decent beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for this kind of beer."
"Overall, I like this beer, because I like hefeweizens, and this is like two hefeweizens in one bomber. Tasty, and fun to drink. It might get a little old after two or three glasses, but it's a interesting change from the same old Blue Moon and Sunshine Wheat."
"Poured into my moose drool hefe style glass. Forcefully pours a thick ""big bubble"" off-white head that doesn't have much retension. No lacing found on the glass at all. Color is a murky dark brown. Nose has the usual yeasty wheat touch with some spicy cloves and some caramel tossed in there for kicks as well. Fair amount of carbination makes this one lighter in mouthfeel than I expected but strangely smooth as well. Taste from the front to finish features a very low hop profile, some bready notes, malt sweetness easily detected with the yeast ever present. I found the smell of this beer to be the star of this show instead of the taste, the smell was slightly more enjoyable than the taste but still it was a good experience."
"A good introduction/gateway to the style and one you could drink a lot of."
"D - Decent for the style, but I don't think I'd really want another. I wouldn't turn it down, but I doubt I'll seek it out again with better options available. Ayinger and Weihenstephaner do the same style to a much, much better degree."
"But, it is hard to find many Dunkel beers in the UK."
"D- Pretty easy to drink but I probably wont pick this one up again."
"D: To my humble opinion this beers seems like a hybrid between a weizen and a Guiness. I really like this one. It's my favorite german beer next to Aventinus and Sternweizen."
"Hazy dark brown with a creamy tan cap that leaves some fine lace on the glass. The nose is really faint and comprised of roasted malt and cocoa. The taste is pretty malty and roasty with some nutty yeastiness in the finish, not the most flavorful example of the style. Medium light bodied with bright carbonation. Tasty brew but a little wimpy for the style IMO."
"The taste is no surprise. It is a bit creamier, and little less prickly than most wheat beers. It has the big malt palate, with molasses, caramel, and semi sweet grainy malts present. The consistency is a little heavier than most wheat beers, although I wouldn't label this as medium bodied either. There are some sweetish roasted flavors on the back end of this beer too, but the molasses does take precedence here. A nice beer, easy to drink and enjoy, not bad with some interesting character for the style."
"Very big tan head, cloudy dark brown colour. The aroma is very clean, malts and hops and roasted malts too. Flavour is roasted a bit acidic and hoppier than most german weisses. Mouthfeel is crisp with medium bubbles. To me this was a very good weissbier, not exceptional like weihenstephaner, but still very good."
"And the nose was so promising... darn."
"D- Give this beer to me any time and I'll be sure to enjoy it. Spicy, yet sweet, and a very smooth bitterness to finish off. Very well rounded beer. Another one that would be excellent on tap but that isn't available in my area at least. One of the better beers I've come across. I highly recommend this one!"
"Extremely easy to drink, at least for me anyway."
"Drinkability: Relatively drinkable at 5.6%. Not overly complex, does not ""beg"" for you to drink it though. Best served in my opinion more on the chilled side rather than just cool. Goes well in a hot summer night on the patio."
"Has a dark opaque brown color with a beige, thick, and foamy head. Not too much aroma; nothing distinct nor strong. Taste was also pretty weak, but there were hints of a roast and banana flavors. The mouthfeel is pretty much the highlight of the beer. The beer itself is pretty thick, and mixed with the lingering foamy head, it feels great in the mouth for savoring what taste there actually is. Pretty good overall, decent beer that can be drunk at anytime, just needs more taste."
"D : Really good beer to enjoy during or after a meal. Its great with roasted meats."
"The mouthfeel, carbonation, etc make for a very well balanced beer."
"T: A thicker tinge, but overall clean experience. Most of the flavor comes towards the end with a smokiness and tacky molasses."
"What's really interesting is that it isn't a watered down feeling when you drink. The medium to full body of this beer makes you expect more flavor but it just never materializes. Like a stripper this beer has a great body to look at and feel, hell even spend a few bucks on it at the bar but there is no substance to it and it's not one to take home."
"Very impressive after the pour huge thick head that I had to let settle some before completing the pour. The body is deep dark brown with red highlights and a bit of cloudiness. The nose is a bit weak, I get some dark fruit tones and a bit of dark malts but absent are any clove or wheat aromas that would be nice. The taste of this too is somewhat lacking. I'm not really getting nearly as much yeast flavor either clove or banana or wheat as I should be with a beer of this style. It tastes like a solid dark beer but not a dunkel weiss. Mouthfeel too misses the mark, this beer is just too light and doesn't have the creamy fullness that a wheat beer should have. Drinkability is ok but there are much better options in this style available and the lack of complexity makes this a bit boring."
"D - Good. not interesting but would be terrific with food."
"In conclusion, this is not a bad beer. It is procedurally correct and all the components are there. But these components aren't top quality and as a result are substantively deficient. Therefore, it is not a bad beer, its an allright beer. But it is not a good dunkelweizen."
"Decent, and rather plainly inoffensive, and nowhere near the fruit/yeast bomb that I was expecting. It's more akin to the well-made but boring brown ales around here. Very old-world, I suppose, as I always seem to see older Euro gentleman carrying armfuls of this stuff to the tills at the store."
"D - Can be had all year round"
"This beer tricked me at first. It pours so dark I thought it was going to be like a stout. but it smelled and tasted almost the same as the hefe. If I closed my eyes, i could have thought it was an pale orange color. It was a little lacking of the strong flavors like the erdinger hefe, but it was still good. I enjoyed the beer, but nothing amazing ."
"PS. After writing the review, I checked some others to see where mine settled in. I see my score is a bit high, but then again, I'm a dunkelweisse fan. . . so I shouldn't be surprised at that, I suppose. Kind of a polarizing style, I've noticed."
"MF&D - again the beer (like the regular version) is incredibly carbonated and thin; though it is hard to tell between viscosity and sheer carbonation."
"Bottle has a best before date of 07 2009, so I guess I'm getting to this just in time. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is an almost opaque brown color with a huge brown-cream head. The smell is a mixture of sweetly roasted malts, breadiness, spicy yeast and just a hint of banana/clove. The taste is much the same, no flavor is overly dominate but it is a slightly sweet mixture of the toasted malt, bready yeast and subdued spice. The mouthfeel is good, full bodied and almost chewy, carbonation is present but in check. Overall, a very drinkable beer but not the most impressive Dunkelweizen I've had. Non-offensive, it might be a good beer for a BMC drinker to try as a gateway beer."
"Overall I liked the look and mouthfeel to it the most. The taste and smell was good but very subtle. Although I must say it's a very drinkable beer."
"This is a tasty brew and makes me look forward to trying more in this style."
"D: Average. This beer is an outlayer from all the other dunkels that I have had so far. There isn't much yeast flavor and the malt is what dominates."
"Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel poured a dark brown, much darker then I expected. Almost looked like a stout. The smell was faint, hints of bread and yeast. Taste was very full, hints of chocolate, but lighter. Mouthfeel was good. Drinkability was ok, was a little filling. Overall this was an interesting beer. I liked it, was a different style of hefe. Unexpectedly pleasant. Would look for again."
"Poured into a weizen glass for a soapy, off-white one-finger head that died at a medium pace with no lace on a cola colored body. A balance of clove and citric notes along with caramel malt passes for the aroma. Medium-bodied, smooth and creamy, has a little spicy clove taste up front the citric notes and hop bitterness (along with some good carbonation) mix with some caramel, roasted malts for a slightly sweet and citric beer that is a little sticky and has a dry, crisp backbite. A good all-around beer but there is nothing outstanding about it that makes it great."
"Overall, I found this beer hard to fault and I would not hesitate to keep a few of these around the house. However, that is likely because I tend to favour North American dark lagers over German dunkels in the first place. Frankly, this would not have struck me as a dunkel to begin with, or at least not very representative of the style."
"Ordered a a beautiful half-liter at Sunswick 35/35 for $7. This dark brown beer with its light tan head looked oh-so promising, but fell flat once I started sipping. Sure, the carbonation was fine, but it only tasted like a creamed wheat or oatmeal cereal with a hint of cocoa powder."
"Overall, a fine example of the still: good, but not the best in class."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and medium-plus bodied. Overall a very nice drinkable dark wheat beer. I could enjoy this on a regular basis."
"Fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, so drink this beer unless like Fred Dorfman your a closet case."
"Otherwise a pretty good beer."
"Drinkability: As with all German low ABV brews, I could drink these all day with ease. German beer drinkability never ceases to amaze me."
"Overall I'm surprised at how good this dunkel weizen turned out, since their regular weissbier is somewhat average to most people."
"Pours medium to light brown with off-white head. Nose is somewhat tame compared to other Hefe-Weizens I've sampled recently, whether dunkel or not. Palate offers a medium malty flavor with brown bread, light baking spices, and a faint suggestion of cookie dough. Finish is medium short with more cookie dough."
"Drinkability: While not much more complex than the Weissbier from Erdinger, this dunkel is fine and I could have more, both now and sometime again."
"Man, this is one tasty beer. dark chocolate flavors are in the forefront with a bit of banana esters in mid palate with a nice, crisp wheat tang on the finish. It is a bit mild mannered compared to others of the style, but extreme is not really what I look for in a German wheat beer. I like the lively carbonation it provides with a careful pour. This is one of the better dunkelweizens I have had, and I will definitely be buying more of it. Highly recommended."
"It is what it is...dark brown with a tan, rocky head. Not as much on the nose as I was hoping even after it warmed up a bit. Touch of cocoa, coffee with just a dab of fruity esters in the background. Drinks super smooth and a little creamy even. Not bad but I just expected a little more."
"500ml bottle with a best by date of October 2009. Nice dark brown color, small head. Smells decent and malty but not much like a hefe. The flavor is nice and malty but i get no clove or bubblegum nor banana that I usually get from a hefeweissen. I need to drink more dunkelweizens to get a good feel for the style."
"Drinkability- Haven't had very many of this style. Quite nice and enjoyable."
"D: Not as drinkable as Erdinger's other brews, but good. One is enough, I'd rather order a bunch of Erdinger Kristallklar instead."
"A pretty average dunkel, drinks ok but there are such better versions out there that this won't be spending any time in my fridge."
"Conclusion: Nice, clean, simple, tasty, smooth, full of dark fruit; not quite what I was expecting, but super tasty nonetheless."
"500mL bottle. Pours a very dark muddy brown with a fluffy tan head that drops quickly. Smell is tart wheat and some very faint chocolate and a bit of banana. Slightly tart taste with a roasted character, and very faint fruits. Metallic, dry finish. Thin feel with moderate carbonation. Pretty mediocre."
"I am very pleased with Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel. As others have noted, this is mildly surprising, as their standard hefeweizen (at least the way it turns out after being bottled and imported into the US) really isn't stellar. Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel is easily the brewery's finest offering (stateside, at least). I strongly, strongly recommend this beer, to any fan of hefeweizens, doppelbocks, and/or weizenbocks."
"Pours a dark reddish colored body. Brownish head, creamy & lasting, and pretty big. Malty, somewhat banany aroma, grapey. Not too strong an aroma. Somewhat banana, dusty taste. More body than a hefeweizen. Nutty."
"Not bad. No off flavors here, but could be more robust. This brew has a lighter flavor profile than some Hefe's but certainly drinkable."
"D-Not a bad example of the style, but it could be much better. The drinkability is rather low, courtesy of the high carbonation. It would be difficult to have a few of these in a row."
"It is very good. I think it might be too strong to be a session beer, but the other characteristics make it close."
"Part of an Erdinger gift set; served in a tall weizen glass. Chocolate brown color with a tremendous tan head. Minimal aroma; mix of malt and banana. Taste is pleasant, if fairly mild. A little banana, perhaps a little less complex than I prefer. Relatively easy drinking brew."
"Final final note: I debated buying this bottle, as I actually despise their normal hefeweizen. I closed my eyes and bought it, then avoided opening it for about a month. These two beers are worlds appart and I wish I had tried this sooner. A complete surprise."
"D-Not very drinkable, turns flat after 15 to 20 mintunes.:( Not very good at all."
"D: Disappointing overall to me. I'm certainly glad I was able to try it, but there's not enough going on here to make me want another. There are much more complex choices in this style out there."
"overall, if i could get a six at cheaper price than i pay per 16.9 oz bottle id buy it more. Right now, its a buy when i dont have the cash for a better dark hefe/dunkel."
"Overall, a decent dunkelweiss but its a little tame in the nose and taste."
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark dunkel with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt with light caramel and light banana aftertaste. Taste is mostly dominated by some roasted malt with a light bitter finish and some light fruity notes also noticeable. Average body with good carbonation. OK but again a style that really doesn't appeal to me that much."
"Mouthfeel is ok despite the high carbonation and drinkability is passable. But what a boring beer!"
"A huge billowing light tan head three fingers deep. Color is a dark brown. Nice aroma of banana and some clove but mostly banana. The taste does not live up to the promise of the smell. Mouthfeel was weak, Some malt and fruitiness in the flavor, somewhat chocolatey. High CO2."
"Overall- Decent but simple and lacking real umph!"
"Poured an attractive dark brown that was nearly black with a generous tan head that lasted a while. The aroma is a combination of fruit, chocolate, and caramel. The flavor is similar to the smell and I think the chocolate intensified a bit as the beer got warmer. The mouthfeel was pleasant. This was a good beer with good drinkability."
"D - Not bad, but not great. Doesn't have much moreishness."
"This could maybe pass as an American dark lager but not a true German dunkel. It may be dark but it is far from spicy, fruity, malty or refreshing. A real dunkelweizen should posses all the zesty yeast and citrusy wheat character of a hefeweizen and all the heavy, malty caramel richness of a dunkel (hence the damn name!) but this fails at both ends of its title."
"A nice drinkable dunkel - very simple and straightforward, but pleasant and refreshing, making it an easy drinker. Its definitely not exceptional in the field, but I would consider it again."
"A nice 16.9oz bottle at propwer temperature poured out a rich, deep dark brown with a mild roasted malt and citrus aroma. The head was minimal but had retention and the flavor was malt-roasted with slight citrus & wheat, but not grassy or hempish. There was a nice hazelnut undertone and though there was good thick body, it still ultimately was light in drinkability and delicious! More please..."
"Easily drinkable beer, low ABV, good taste, and good mouthfeel make sure of that."
"Drinkability would be great but its just a little too sugary for my taste to drink too many."
"this is a nice looking dark beer. the coudy hefe body lends to a think looking dark beer. the head is off white and one of the creamest and lingering heads i have seen. the lace on the glass just doesnt go away. I was expecting to get more from the smell but all i get is a typical lightly fruity, fresh hefe smell. The taste is very very smoth and balanced. the darker malt lends to a great balance. the hefe yeast still contributes it's fruity esters. not as much banana flavor as other breweries. And a crisp clean finish is classic. beeing a hefe the mouthfeel is solid, but erdinger has the thickest mouth feel i think. some of it has to do with the release of the carbonation when you drink it, so bubbles froth in your mouth. due to the balanced flavor, and overall light, crisp, and refreshing nature of this beer and style this is for sure a full on session beer"
"This pours a dark brown with a two finger head which disappears. The nose is dominated by toasted malts and dark fruit. A wonderful creamy mouthfeel. The palate is bananas and some light chocolate. A bit of spiciness gives it a bit of zing and provides some length."
"Not a good first impression of this brewery."
"A nice mouthfeel, it's certainly an easy drinker beer. A sessionable wheat beer, the kind that Erdinger excels at. Nice, but look elsewhere for complexity."
"Drinkability - There is nothing offensive about this beer but I would definitely prefer a different wheat beer."
"Poured from 500ml bottle, a translucent dark brown with light tan head, no retention, spotty lacing. Smell: dark fruit, prunes, maybe fig. No banana. Wheat and a touch of astringency + alcohol. Taste: wheat, dark fruit, caramel, chocolate, and a banana-esque softness but without the banana. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, hard-water feel, a little too effervescent for the style, it's there and gone with not much to remember it by. It's immediately recognizable as an Erdinger, maybe it's their yeast? This was enjoyable but doesn't rate with the top German dunkelweizens."
"D- It's a pretty easy drinker, like most Bavarian wheats. It would be a great pair with classically German meal."
"As soon as I opened the bottle I noticed the bread like aroma with yeast tones it was not as malty as one might imagine or as their other beers for that matter. It is a very foamy beer with lots of head and lace. The body is dark almost cola looking with a very dark amber hue. It has very bread like taste and is not as roasty as most dunkels. It is very balanced though. The malt and the hops equally each other out well. The mouthfeel is egg like and slick. It is a very drinkable beer that goes well with food"
"Drinkability: Not too heavy, relatively low ABV, etc. Not that bad really, I could have a couple of these. I've had better dunkelweizens though. Franziskaner comes to mind. Or Weihenstephaner. This ones a good pick though. I'd pick the other two over this, but I won't avoid it either."
"This beer is ok but lacks any ""wow"" factor....not bad but pretty average."
"I expected more, especially from the nice look of the initial pour of the brew, but it's not a bad hefeweizen. Just not one that I would buy too often, or at all if there are other choices around."
"This is now my second bottle in two months, and I don't feel the need to try another one. But maybe if I see it on tap..."
"Pours a dark brown with reddish highlights. Smell is of wheat and molassas. Taste is malty, with hints of chocolate and a slight wheat twang. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, carbonation high. Quite drinkable though, a smooth drinking beer, I would drink again."
"d: One of those beers that just disappears from your glass it goes down so easy. That being said, I was really looking for a stronger, more complex flavor."
"D: I found myself disappointed by this offering. I have had some delicious beer from Erdinger and this did not match my expectations. It was drinkable, since it remained extremely light throughout the glass, but it lacked a certain complexity that I wanted from this dunkel-weiss. It is worth trying, especially is you wanted to pair it with a plate of grilled chicken."
"When poured into a Erdinger Weizen glass, this Dunkelweizen was an appealing murky dark chestnut brown with some caramel coloring mixed in with it. Usually Weizens have a massive head of foam on it, but the one on this beer was more controlled. It was about 1 1/2 inches in height and was an off white color. This head of foam quickly fizzled away and only left behind a handful of fizzy off white colored rings. I liked the color, but the head of foam needed a little something. This beer needs to be swirled around to wake up the aroma. When it was, the aroam was still very subtle with dark roasted wheat, a splash of sweet caramel, and a hint of banana and cloves. To me, the aroma needed more malted wheat and banana and it shouldn't have to be swirled around to get any kind of smell out of it. The taste was very crispy and carbonated with plenty of dark roasted wheat, a hint of banana, a pinch of cloves, and then finishes up with more malted wheat. It is a Weizen, but there should have been a little bit more flavor in here. Wheat can get a little boring by itself. This was a light bodied beer that was heavy on the carbonation and featured a faint aftertaste of dark roasted wheat and a hint of cloves. No banana, just wheat and cloves. It wouldn't be so bad if they lowerd the carbonation so I could get more of an aftertaste out of this beer. In the end, this Weizen was overly carbonated with a ton of malted wheat and really nothing else. There are better German or American Dunkelweizens out there. I will continue to use the glass with the Erdinger name on it, but I won't be pouring this beer into it any time soon."
"overall a nice dunkel."
"Dark brew with large foamy head that stays around. Alcoholic scent coming through the open medicine cabinet with some roasted nuts laying around. A bit malty taste, light carbonation zing with a touch of chocolate grain makes for a beer that sits well on the palate and easy on the stomach. A great balance of a light bodied beer that has characteristics of a dark, heavy bodied one."
"In the mouth, it feels maybe just a little too thin for my full bodied tastes, but just a tad."
"The carbonation is mild to medium. All-in-all, this is a crisp, refreshing Dunkel; about on par with Franziskaner but not as good as Weihenstephaner."
"D: Can be difficult to drink due to the carbonation. Similar to the hefe from this brewery, I'm just not getting much. Compared to the real good weisse beers out there, this one just screams average."
"D- This is a decent beer overall but not what I have in mind for this style. I didn't detect the characteristic banana or spiciness. This is light, mild, and drinkable-nonetheless."
"Overall a nice change from a hefe, sort of on the way towards a weizenbock."
"The brew pours a deep brown, almost rusty color with lots of haze and a huge and healthy beige/tan head that leaves lots of sticking on a .5L Erdinger Weiss glass. The nose emits aromas of toasted wheat, apple and a subtle chocolate malty sweetness. Its flavor drops off rather quick while tasting. Hints of spice, some detectable hop twang mid palate and on the finish, some metallic funk notes, oats, and definite notes of banana. Lots of active carbonation through out the bottle, light body and extremely drinkable."
"A very enjoyable brew, drinkable, and a nice change-up from the standard Weissbier."
"D: Nothing that makes it really special, but beer is drinkable. Maybe due to 5.6 ABV."
"Newly stocked item at a local store, picked up a single. Even with the glass tilted an enormous fluffy head sat atop a dark cola colored beer. After a few minutes the head settled and a nice looking glass of beer sat in front of me. Nice and aromatic sweet yeasty scents are easily detected. This one is definitely different from the other hefe' and dunkel-weizens where as it doesn't seem to contain a large presence of banana and clove esters. Although unique it is still very appealing. Mouthfeel is better than average, very smooth but somewhat dry. Flavor is good and surprisingly mellow for this style. Seems balanced and the sweetness from the aroma carries through. Not the best I've sampled but well worth picking up."
"Wheat beers are good to drink for breakfast, but if you want liquid apple strudel flavor over liquid banana bread, grab this beer."
"I poured a 16.9oz bottle into my Smokestack goblet. This beer pours as dark brown as a ale can get. When held away from the light it looks completely entirely black. It also pours a nice 2 finger beige head. The aroma of this beer is as unoriginal as you think a German brewery could do. The aroma is sweet malt, up front in the middle and at the end. The taste is as uninventive as the Ford Taurus. Once again, hello sweet malts. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mild carbonation. Wow, I really expected a lot more from this beer. Erdinger makes wonderful wheat beers, why would they allow this beer to be put out to market and be so average."
"Despite the fact that this is a good beer I must say that after the nice appearance and a good first impression it actually ends in something of a disappointment."
"Medium bodied, crisp, clean, but still smooth."
"This is a very good beer. One of my favorite Dunkleweizen's, and one of the first good German beers that I tried as I was moving away from macro's. Though this is more than a gateway beer. Something I still enjoy years after my first try."
"looks like a good dunkle, nice cloudy dark color with an off white rocky head that fades to lacing. that's pretty much where the good dunkle thing ends isn't it? the aroma isn't spectacular by any means, little bit of maltiness, maybe some fruit esters, buy not much. the taste is much the same, fruit, little wheat, not a lot else. the mouthfeel is pretty decent, a bit of maltiness that isn't overshadowed by the carbonation."
"Drinkability- Not great, not bad. I'll try it again on the off-chance I got a bad bottle. Erdinger normally puts out a pretty good brew."
"All in all, a pleasurable drinking experience and a fantastic diversion from the actual work I should be doing (metrical analysis of Beowulf - there's a reason I need a beer break)."
"I have to say I liked the dunkel much better than the hefewiess in this case. Poured it into my Duvel chalice. Had a nice, cloudy brownish color. Smelled was malty, a little yeast, hint a cherries. Taste was smooth and creamy with a forward maltiness balanced by a touch of spicey hops in the background. Went down smooth with a crisp finish. Hooray for dunkels!"
"A nice balance. You can first taste the toasted malts then caramel with a faint spice at the end. Very creamy and enjoyable. A certified bargain at 2.99"
"D. Goes down fairly easy, but my is this one filling. Its like having a meal."
"Pours a five finger light tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer and leaves traces of lace. Cloudy amber color, yeast left in bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Mostly malty nose. Flavor is malty, sweet, hints of yeast. Clean finish. Nice hefe. $3.99 for a 500ml bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Poured a half glass of creamy, light brown colored head that faded faster then normal. Hazy cola colored beer has an amber hue around the edges. Smells of raisin and cocoa with spoon full of yeast. The flavor is rich and has hints of rum and raisins under then doughy dark malt base. The flavors remind me of something stronger like a Weizenbock, which is nice because there is something freaky about a dark weizen beer that tastes exactly like a pale weizen. The mouthfeel is a bit fizzy and not as smooth and full as I was expecting, but it's not a deal killer. It's definitely my type of Dunkelweizen."
"some other dunkel's"
"Just a delightful beer. Even as I review it today it's making me want another glass right now. Just delicious stuff."
"maybe i'm just not as big a fan of dunkelweizen as i am with regular pale hefes? i can't drink more than one or two of these. still, for erdinger, actually a better choice than their regular weiss."
"This one pours a dark muddy-water brown with some red highlights and a pretty big very light tan head. The smell is light with some fruitiness and a touch of spice. Taste is light as well. Toasted and wheaty grains mostly with a bit of earthiness to it. A good amount of carbonation but unspectacular feeling in the mouthfeel. Not very impressive overall."
"quite a good beer, which could become a truly great beer with a bit of improvement in the brewhouse ...."
"A huge fluffy light tan head sits atop a dark brown brew. Smells of banana, citrus, coriander and a bit of pine. The taste does not live up to the promise of the smell. A dull intro is followed up by malts mixed with faint bananas and a bit of spice. Mouth-feel is smooth and light-bodied. Carbonation is fairly active."
"Not my favorite by any means. I'll probably pass on this one."
"Drinkability: At 5.6% I could drink this one now and then but the mouthfeel being so overly carbonated makes lowers the drinkability."
"MF/D - Thin and watery with a hint of alcohol warmness. This beer is drinkable, but not nearly as good as it other German counterparts. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one, there are much better examples of this style out there."
"This beer is very dark which sets it apart from a lot of other hefeweizens."
"Palate is, as expected in a wheat beer, exquisitely smooth and drinkable."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown, slightly translucent with massive off-white, tan head. Aromas are really muted with very little phenols present, no spice, no citrus. What I get is mostly caramel and toasted bread from the darker malts. On the palate more of the same. There are some banana flavors, but still no clove, just a fair melanoidin character. I don't know if my sample is just too cold, but not much of anything is coming off this beer. There is a nice malty, tart finish though. A medium bodied beer with high carbonation, not quite as high as a heffe, and also with a slight stinging feel. Overall, this is a so-so dunkel."
"Verdict: A drinkable dunkelweizen. I don't really notice anything that sets it apart but It's smooth, it goes down well and that counts for something."
"D: a good drinker, could have quite a few of these."
"D- This is a very easy beer to drink, goes down very smooth. It looks dark but there is not mistaking that it is wheat."
"The taste is OK but not much complexity. Some malt a little ""dark"" tasting. Nice caramel addition to the taste. The mouth feel is very good."
"Poured from a 500mL bottle into a traditional Bavarian Sturzl. This puppy had a nice, big soft foamy head that slowly dissapated but did not dissapear completely. They put a decent amount of Munich malt into this one. I really like Munich malt and that characteristic malty carmel flavor with almost no sweetness. However, I detected absolutely NO hefeweizen characteristics! No wheaty tang, no clove, no banana. Oh well, I love Dunkels and I enjoyed this beer."
"D - Nice in all, it is easily quaffable. I could make a night of this brew and not get bored once. If you see one of these, pick it up, recommended!"
"Poured into a wine goblet, resulting in a two finger head that settled down with some mild lacing. Color a medium coffee intensity, just shy of Guinness darkness. Aroma is of malt and alcohol esters, with less wheat than one might expect, especially compared to its competitor from Spaten. Malt and fizziness dominate the taste sensation, with bits of dried dark fruit and very little wheat taste apparent. Great mouthfeel with notable carbonation. The Spaten is eminently drinkable, but this might be even more so."
"Overall: nice dunkel weizen. Not top of the notch but very interesting and quite enjoyable."
"Appearance is a dark brown with a thick off white fluffy head. Smell is light wheat mostly malt, fruity. Taste is heavier in malt with a hint of coffee, not alot of charactor. Mouthfeel is light - medium with good carbonation. A good beer, but not great, I don't think I'll run out any time soon to grab another."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. High carbonation."
"D: I downed two bottles with my pork chops and sauerkraut and potato cakes at the Edelweiss Restaurant in Greenwood. Fuhrer Num NUm!"
" I personally enjoyed this up to a point, it become a bit boring in the long-run."
"Pfft. Pours with a nice finger of head, which settles to half that in about 10 seconds. Pours a deep rich dark brown, almost black. Hold it to the light and there are caramel-red highlights a plenty. Smell is weak as expected for the style, but you pick up notes of caramel and hop. Taste is where the hops come out of the woodwork - hops are the first thing you notice after the medium carbonation. The hops settle out with the bubbles, and you're left with milder hops and sweet caramel aftertaste. Carbonation is good - a bit of a bite, but not overdone. Drinkability is good, but there is a bit of carbonation to process. Not to overstate the carbonation, but letting it sit for 15 minutes helps. Poured from a bottle this attribute is more noticeable, but I expect if you got this in Germany it would be in a bigger glass than 16oz, and therefore would have time to breathe. Alcohol content is 5.5% according to the label. Would have uploaded a picture but I see one is already awaiting review."
"Not bad but I like the lighter Hefes better.Nice to try but dont think I would go out of my way to try again."
"Tastes of sweet malts, dark fruits, chocolate, spicy hops and caramel. I enjoy this dunkel but it is lacking in some areas"
"D'abiliy - Clean when cold, and almost lager-like. Nice dark malt character."
"D: Very drinkable. I will be buying it again."
"500 ml bottle, best by 4/2008. Served in a weizen glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch off-white head. It smells like roasted malt, wheat and a little bit of chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, except there's also a bit of spice (clove) noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, and with a lot amount of carbonation. The carbonation hurts the drinkability a bit, but it's not hard to drink. Overall I think this is a decent beer, but it seems like something is missing from it. Lowering the carbonation would definintely help."
"Malty nose. Low hops with almost no aroma which is par for style. Smooth beer with rich mouthfeel. A taste of roasted malts lingers in your mouth at the end. Pours dark with a large tan head that subsides quickly. I usually don't like Hefe's but I would drink this one again."
"i went on a dark "" heavy weezin' "" trip today for some reason, this one was #1 on deck ; pours a dark slightly cloudy ruddy-brown w a fluffy tan head which dissapated rather quickly ( may have been the glass tho) left a moderate lacing ; not a strong aroma at all, a faint hint of some wheaty yeast esters, a little fruitiness to it, bannana maybe, some hop spiciness, metallic aroma, too ; a thin almost ""watery"" flavor, you can taste some darker malts and hops in a ""euro macro"" base, not much wheatiness to it, kinda metallic aftertaste as well ; a good mouthfeel true to style, light w/ lots of bubbles, sticks to your tounge just right ; this is a drinkable one, but i feel it's not really "" weezy"" enough..."
"d: this is the second bottle that I have had and both have suffered from pretty strong metallic flavors which made the beer a little harder to enjoy; overall i feel that this beer is ok but i wouldn't go out of my way to drink it."
"Overall: I'll probably have it again and I would recommend it for a dark hef, but it probably wouldn't be top on the list."
"Drinkability: I was expecting a Hefe(and if you are...don't drink this beer because it is not a Hefe) but it rather enjoyable. A nice mild beer that goes down easy."
"Comment: I enjoyed it but it did little to entice me to become a regular."
"Drinkability: Excellent drinkability, I could drink this all night."
"Drinkability: Goes down wonderfully. Again, if you view this as a dark beer with wheat hints, it is as original as it comes."
"Poured into a wheat glass, pours a dark black color with a fluffy 3 finger head that stays around the entire drink, looks like a Russian imperial stout. Smell is a bit of a weedy citrus smell with a roasted malt in the mix as well. This beer is not to flavorful, I can detect a bit of citrus and also a bit of lemon as well. This beer did go down quickly and pretty smooth, good for a summer day, but kind of weird drinking a dark hefe, over all not to bad and one I would probably have again."
"malts which was very delicious; yeast was also clear in the taste. Some spices are in the package too but the usual Weizen banana taste is lighter on the dark version probably because of a stronger dark wheat malt taste; a rather enjoyable taste and also with some wheat, malt and yeast aromas on the nose. The finish was very slightly bitter and going into the after taste it was malty, wheaty as expected but as it lingers a little; it becomes a little fruity plummy like Belgian dark ales and I could sense some breadiness and bananas on the nose. Some spices was detected in the after taste as well; it finally fades off to leave a light grape citrus finale; not too shabby! The mouthfeel was around medium body with a intense carbonation which was at first pretty stinging. The smoothness and refreshing nature was however very well crafted as expected in Weizen beers. A very enjoyable refreshing tasty beer indeed. I definitely prefer this to the non dark default version of the Erdinger."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is over carbonated. So much so that it interferes with the flavor of the brew. Carbonation is sharp and quickly foams up in the mouth. However, the bottle could've been infected, but still... As to drinkability...I will not be buying this beer again. It just plain sucks, overall it has no redeeming qualities. I won't say avoid it but I will caution the buyer-""caveat emptor""- this is a poor brew, not only stylistically but all around. Poor appearance, poor taste, poor mouthfeel, and the drinkability, well I'll never buy it again."
"D: Goes down fairly easily. With very little banana presence, it's a better fit for me than most weissbiers."
"Taste is light wheat and Weizen taste. Banana's and clove are almost not present. The chocolate and roasted/burned notes are present and let the beer's balance lean the total opposite of a normal Weizen. Nothing phenolic, but more caramel. The yeast also seems to differ from a standard Weizen yeast. Aftertaste is dry and light chocolate. Good beer, but not what I expected."
"Poured from a bottle dated 1/2008. As others have said, the beer poured nice. Big thick head, nice dark red color but the taste really was a downer. To me, this doesn't even taste like a Hefeweiss. There are no pronounced characteristics of the wheat at all. It's not a bad beer but just not a good example of what it should be. Would I drink it again? Sure, but I wouldn't order it over other Weiss beers if given the choice."
"Pours a dark cloudy brown color with plenty of creamy tan head that just won't go away. Smells of yeast and fruity. Some plum and raisin in the aroma. The flavor also fruity, some plums and also a small amount of chocolate. There's also a yeasty flavor through it. The mouthfeel is very fizzy and scraping on the tongue, and a little heavy, just like a wheat should be. Overall, it's a very drinkable and tasty brew. I just wish I could afford to get it all the time."
"A nice dark reddish-brown with a decent tan head. Aroma is malty but a touch of sour too. It is very smooth going down but does leave a bitter charcoal taste, pretty nice. Not overly carbonated. Quite drinkable but not quite as impressive as I expected on tap. Definitely worth a try but not one I would hang my hat on."
"Overall, its good a good dark wheat flavor which is one of my favorite grain flavors, but nothing extraordinary. Overly carbonated and generally light flavors make this a good session beer, but nothing to marvel about."
"D - Excellent. It's almost perfectly sessionable. The only thing I didn't like is it's weak nose and light flavors....it just needs kicked up a notch."
"Yet another decent dunkel in Manitoba's liqour stores, this is a very dark deep take on the style with a lot to explore when the beer warms. More caramel than banana this beer shows real legs on the finish with a semi sweet exit. I will certainly buy this again when I see it as it often difficult to get a dunkel as nice as this."
"D - This is a very good dunkel. Another good German brew."
"A decent dunkel weizen, though I've had better of style from Bavariia. It's well-within freshness date, but slight oxidation and blandness make me wonder how well this one held up in transit."
"Interesting variation on wheat beer and I have to say that I really liked this one. Will certainly be trying again."
"The beer pours very dark brown with a frothy tan head that sticks around for a while. It has a light smell of caramel that is clean and crisp. The taste is really toasty and dark - almost like drinking a stout. The mouthfeel is excellent - creamy and the right amount of carbonation. Overall this is very drinkable and creamier than the average hefe weizen."
"Overall very drinkable and a very good dark hefe. Dunkels make wheat beers redeemable. This is one of the better dunkels."
"d: Yes..would order again..."
"¡Salud!"
"The drinkability is OK maybe good as well. I would like to try this on tap. It looks awesome but slides from there. MK"
"Beaut looking beer with a big creamy head. Deep and dark colour like black Assam tea. A slight doughy, wheaty aroma but nothing too apparent. The flavour is pretty subdued but wheaty with faint dark chocolate notes. My wife just says ""molasses"" but she doesn't like dark beer although she has an excellent nose and palate. I agree with other reviewers that its a bit watery but I think this may be a saving grace in terms of drinkability. I like this beer and if it weren't for the price it would be a session beer for me. Sure, it's not overly complex but its a medium body dark with nice wheaty flavours and creamy drinkability. Nice."
" D - A quaffable brew that goes down easy. I would probably hestitate to drink more than one, though since it is more carbonated than I would prefer. This is perfectly fine for the style."
"Pours a dark, ruby brown with a great pillow head and excellent lacing. Smell is lightly malty, garssy with a soft ""cotton candy"" quality. Taste is mainly malty, sugary quality, but with a crisp quality. Smooth and refreshing...mouthfeel is lightly chewy and smooth."
"Yeast haze dark cola brown with a large, dense, foamy, dirty khaki brown head that sticks around. Nose is wheat bread dough, yeast, spicy carrot cake, light banana, and herbal, noble hops. Mild toffee mixes with charred fruits, cardboard, light-roasted coffee, and cooked banana. Finish is yeasty with a light herbal hop snap. Moderate body could use a little more substance. Mouthfeel is a little over-bubbly, lifting the flavor off the tongue too soon. Not bad, but a little disappointing overall."
"Nice looking beer..dark opaque brown with a frothy head that took forever to go away...ramp down the aggressive pour if you want all 500ml to fit in to a standard glass. Faint bread/wheat smell and not much else. Taste was a bit disappointing..very bleh and watery with some faint spiciness at the end of a swallow. Mouthfeel was similar to the other dunkel I tried with medium amounts of carbonation. Really felt let down by this offering."
"Overall: Pretty underwhelming. Not sure if I got a bad bottle. Definitely warrants a second try."
"This is okay, but only okay. Largely bland and unexciting. When it comes to dunkel weizens, Julius Echter and Franziskaner far outclass this ho-hum offering."
"A tasty and refreshing beer. Very drinkable, and would serve as a good intro to brews using roasted barley, or would make a nice refreshing beer in the dog days of summer to give one their fix of roasted barley. Glad i got to try this one."
"I will not be rushing out and buying a crate of this, but if I ever see it on tap anywhere I will give it another try."
"Mouthfeel is thin. Carbonation is noticeable. Does not lend itself to big gulps like the JE and the Franz. Not terrible, just not great. Drinkability would be fine if I could get past the taste, but I can't. This stood out significantly on the downside from the other 3 Dunkels. I will not buy this again."
"drinkability is good. alcohol is hidden well. tasty."
"Pleasant medium body, very easy to drink. Good beer, but Aventinus delivers a lot more."
"This beer is definitely worth a revisit at some point."
"D - Not bad, but somehow it's a heavier beer with lighter flavour."
"Drinkability: a very drinkable dunkel weizen , a refreshing tonic of a dark brew."
"Notes: I'm on a bit of a bad streak. Sometimes you need to go back to the tried and true to get some perspective. This didn't do it for me and for now I""m going back to proven winners only for a while."
"Pours a clear brown color, nice carbonation, huge head, lots of lacing afterwards. Scents of sweet slightly roasted malts, yeast, and banana. The taste is kinda sweet malts, slight tones of banana. Medium body, highly carbonated feel in the tongue. Drinkable, not a bad brew, but other's of this style are quite different and more re-freshing."
"Overall this beer was unimpressive. The smell and taste were weak, and lacked complexity for the style. Worth a try perhaps..."
"Slainte!"
"Had this on tap at the Esplanade Biermarket in Toronto. Pours an impressive dark brown with a bubbly off-white head that laces well. Aroma of raisins, cloves, some malt and a hint of cranberry (I would have liked some banana in there). Taste was a sweet chocolately front, with bananas and chocolate malt pouring in, and a raisiny malt finish a feeling I just a ate a banana. Hop character was low, as the style would dictate. Mouthfeel was effervescent yet very smooth and creamy. This is a great Dunkel Weizen."
"This was my first dunkel weizen, and i was expecting somethin a bit different - perhaps more fruit notes.The flavours and smells do become more apparent as the beer warms slightly, even though the beer was not excessively chilled. I could drink a few of these, a nice simple creamy sweet flavour and texture that sits comfortably in the stomach. Something nice when you are not looking for anything too complex in the weissbier category, a good sessioner"
"I love the Weissbier Dunkel style and Erdinger is an excellent example but I believe I am still searching for the style defining beer."
"Eh, just a completely average dunkel weizen. Easy enough to drink, but not much else to make it interesting."
"D- I'd say this is my favorite hefe-weizen dunkel so far. Nice and clean."
"Flavors in this are a little stronger than a standard hefe-weizen, lowering the drinkability a little. Still a good beer; it's worth the try."
"think that sums it up."
"I reckon this would make a great breakfast beer, if such things were allowed in my house..."
"The taste is no exception. Bliss. Nice sweet malt flavor up front, along with some banana esters. Fades nicely into a gently toasted malt bitterness with a touch of clove and lemon. A nice crisp carbonation brings everything together on the palate. Has everything you could ask for: the full-flavor of a ""dark beer"" as well as the quenchability of a ""light beer."""
"M&D: the carbonation is on the verge of being too spritzy, not as soft as the appearance suggests; medium-bodied, no sign of alc., easy-drinking... but the texture is thinner than ideal. Like two other Dunkel Weizen I've tasted, I guess this style is simply not my cup of tea, as compared with Hefe-weizen I mean. Still a solid brew by all standards, though."
"D - OK. This would probably be better right out of the bottle so that you didn't have to smell it."
"Mouthfeel is pleasant, effervescent, and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Pleasant, not too heavy, quite drinkable. Nice Hefe to savor, though not as wheaty as some, which works in its favor and actually makes it quite the quaffable brew."
"All and all this is a quite elegant dunkel weizen. This to me has too much of a predominantly flowery and perfumed flavor to drink too many, but I am sure reasonable minds could disagree."
"I can't recommend this, get Weihenstephaner instead."
"Drinks okay, just not very memorable. Try it & decide yourself"
"A tame, malty dunkel...not the best example of the style as it lacks complexity and just about any weizen characteristics. Not bad as a beer though..."
"Not too shabby, refreshing and good looking."
"Poured dark and alluring. Head didnt last long but I wasnt paying attention as I was captivated by the deep darkness of color. Earthy scents predominated with some sweetness after a bit of persistence. The taste was nice and mildly sweet, with earthy, nutty aftertastes. In fact, I should note that the lingering and shifting aftertaste is one of the key aspects of this beer. The carbonation kicked for a bit but it was really not a problem. Ill keep on coming back to this one. Ive been converted to the ways of the dunkel."
"On wine, virtue, poetry, whatever!"""
"Taste: Mmmm. I love the dark wheat. It's almost sweet and malty, but it has that wheat sharpness that makes it almost refreshing. This beer is like the ""swiss-army-knife"" of beers, I could drink it on a hot day, or on a winter night. It is well balanced and tasty. Try one now."
"Color is a dark brown with a big fluffy tan head. The foam keeps growing, be carfeul not to pour to aggressively. The head shrunk down leaving a thin floating cap. Slightly hazy, and by the end of the glass, a few floaties had settled to the bottom. The smell has some dark fruit to it like raisins. Also detected a touch of smoke, but didn't have a lot of yeasty aroma. Nice flavorful beer, with no overpowering tastes. More prune or raisins balanced with wheat beer background. Nice amount of carbonation gives it a great body and mouthfeel. Easy to drink, the big bottle disappeared into the glass, then into me. Good all around."
"Overall, just average really. Goes down easy, but too much head and not enough character to be an impressive brew."
"Slàinte!"
"""A dark hefeweizen?", I thought when I picked it up. ""Oh, it's a dunkel."" I thought they'd made a stout/hefe frankenstein! It definitely has the wheatiness of the hefe with the malty flavorings of the stout. I like it! It's very dark in the glass with a good strong head. I thought I smelled rootbeer at first, even in the taste. It's a great balance of the two. I think I've only had one dunkel in my life, but if this is a decent representation of the style, I'll be gettin' down on the dunkel!"
"Immediately after pouring this guy into a glass a thick head forms and stays. Very nice head retention with some good residue left on the sides of the glass. The appearence is great with a very dark cloudy brown hue underneath all the creamy white head. The nose reveals malty fruity esters. Oh man, fantastic taste. The malty fruity esters that I expected to taste from the smell are mild and hidden. They are over powered by a toast/biscuit flavor that crisp the tounge beautifully. This beer has a thicker mouthfeel with a slight bit of carbonation. Overall I really enjoy this beer. The bottle advertises the ""World's #1 Weissbier"" and they might be on to something. Quite tasty and highly recommened."
"Expiry date 9/06. Sits in my glass beautifully with an amazingly rich and fluffy head. Black to ruby to brown edges, very inviting. Really weak smell where I can pick up very small bits of banana and sugar. Taste is a bit watery unfortunately, but there is some flavor underneath. A banana pudding start with kind of a chocolatey-sugar sweetness and some mild spice that sits on the tongue pleasantly. There is a solid creaminess going on but even that falls flat with a bit of seltzery carbonation in the finish. I could probably only stand one of these as it sits a bit thick in the stomach, but at least it looks pretty."
"Pours a cloudy dark-brown / black with prodigious tan head that quickly recedes without a trace. Smells of restrained roasted malt, wheat, maybe a touch of chocolate at the edges. Full of tiny bubbles and surprisingly light and quenching in the mouth. Flavor is more delicate than expected. Creamy toasted malts and wheat intermix, building to a simply but tasty and snappy nutty finish."
"Apparently, I like dunkel weizens more than I remembered. My fondness for them may be due to the fact that I've tasted some of the best that the style has to offer. Or it may be that I just like dark wheats in general. Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel, on the other hand, isn't weissbier enough or dunkle enough to suit me."
"D: Quite good."
"Drinkability: The ale is good, not the best dunkel weizen, but drinkable nonetheless."
"Fifteen minutes later I still notice the sour taste, which now extends with a light candy sugar aftertaste. The mouthfeel is rather light, almost to the point of being watery. I cannot say that I am fond of this beer as it is overall unremarkable and rather bland. Given it is one year out of date, but I do not know if I am motivated to try again at $3/500ml bottle."
"A, dunkel weizen... my favorite beer style.This beer looked absolutely magnificent. It had a thick, dark head that lingered throughout the beer and left lacing down the glass. It had a rich taste, a bit reminiscent of a doppelbock. Though this isn't as good as the Weihenstephaner doppelbock (in my opinion, the gold standard of doppel bocks), this is still a very good beer. Try it if you find it."
"The vigorous carbonation and full body made this a pleasant drink that left a nice alcoholic warming effect going down. Not my last Dunkel by any stretch of the imagination...."
"Drinkability  This is a very drinkable beer. It tastes surprising light not heavy in weight (i.e. isnt filling)."
"I always ignored this beer. Now that I started reviewing again, I felt it was time to try. Im happy to review again!"
"Honestly, even though I didn't give it the highest grade, I'll probably find some to keep in stock for a nice change of pace."
"Nice looking beer.mahogany with a lovelly and huge ,creamy tan head. Very malty type aroma thjough much sour and wheat notes are detected. Taste is quite smooth and mostly all malt, with slight touches of estery tastes and the mearest hint of bitterness near the end. Not too bad on the palate..thin but acceptable given the style. Nice enough beer not great but much better than their Hefe."
"This beer is dark in color, darker than a bock for example, with less of a billowy head than a wheat-based beer might normally offer. The aroma is light but there is a slight metallic tinge to it. For that matter, this beer drinks fairly easily, despite the noticeable malt character. There's not too much wheat here, I don't think. Not a whole lot going on here but this is a decent beer. Why not give it a shot."
"Taste is dark, a little sweet, and rather dry. It really is quite flat when you get down to it. Starts with a malty, dark flavour, but flattens very quickly to a dry, barren and rather insipid nothingness. It's a shame, as there's genuine promise there. You can see where it's going, but it doesn't actually get there."
"I could see myself swallowing this rather than spitting, anyway."
"Wow, I can't believe I'm giving this such a high rating... But damn, it deserves it! I can't think of any reason not to love this beer. It's so easy to drink, tasty, and satisfying. It has all the flavors I love with an awesome crispness, nothing cloying or extreme. Cheers!"
"I look forward to this ,come winter , when I think it would be a fantastic beer , standing around an open fire."
"I really wanted this beer to be more than it was, maybe I had too high expectations."
"Unlike other wheat beers (i.e. Hacker-Pschorr) the taste doesn't hit you right away. It's just very refreshing and pleasent."
"Body is medium, silky smooth, with a crisp wheaty mouthfeel and surprising drinkability."
"Pours black like a stout, with just a little hint of ruby glowing through. Big, fluffy head that ever so slowly disipates to about a finger and a half worth of foam. Delicious looking. Dark, sweet smell. Very malty, with lots of ripe and dark fruits such as cherries, plums, blackberries... Nice, thick sweet taste. Plenty of wheat malts, bit of a spicy crispness, and lots of sweet fruits and breads. Bit of chocolate as well, with some... Coconut? Interesting. Makes the aftertaste a bit more refreshing. Thick, smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Absolutely delicious. An excellent beer. I hope to try more offerings from this brewery."
"Thanks"
"Pours a cloudy brown, orange edges, huge off white head forms and laces on the glass. Smell is sweet and malty, with some orange, citrus chocolate and yeast notes. Taste is chocolate and malty, with some iron, citrus and yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied and medium carbonation. The glass is killer."
"Unfortunately, I guess you can't go back to Seoul again..which is just peachy with me. I enjoyed this more on tap but either way the lighter version is preferable in my humble opinion."
"Very standard all around, which isn't bad, but won't keep my imagination entertained. Regardless, its qualities win over my wishes, and it is what it is."
"Slight hazed dark toffee brown with a fluffy, light brown head. Great retention and clumps of foam stick to the sides of the glass. Mild aroma, cocoa, vanilla, and caramel malt along with a bit of yeastiness. Light chocolate flavour, a bit doughy, finishes with caramel sweetness. Moderately high carbonation gives the body a lot of life and adds a bit of acidity. Creamy texture with a hint of slickness. Quite tasty. I'd definitely try it again."
"Im impressed with this Dunkel. Its got lots of complexity. I would buy it again if it was sold by itself in Ontario."
"Slightly better than a macro, that's about it."
"Drinkability: Nothing complex, just a very enjoyable dark weissbier"
"Dark brown in colour with lots of carbonation. Aromas of raisin, spicy yeast, and a touch of roasted grain. Surprisingly astringent roasted grain flavors dominate the palate, with a bit of the standard hefeweizen banana flavors creaping in at the tinish. I thought that the roasted flavors dominated too much, and it would have been better to get some other more subtle flavors out of the darker grains."
"this pours a dark brown with huge off white head and very little recession. rather than a nice lace it left huge patches along the sides of the glass. lots of bubbles racing up the sides due to the high carbonation. smells of malts, yeast, wheat, grains, etc. the taste is quite excellent, very sweet and complex on my palate. banana flavor sort of jumps out at you and then subsides to a good full wheat flavor. there are also traces of maple syrup, and dates. the complexity of this is fabulous. this is a medium bodied hefe, very complex throughout. the finish is fantastic. man, i have to find this on tap."
"22 ounce bottle. Dark brown with a huge, creamy head. The aroma is wheat with some spiciness and hops. The flavor is very doughy, with chocolate and spice. Some toasted malt flavor. This beer is strange, and it's not really what I expected, but it's not bad. Not malty enough, or spicy enough. Medium mouthfeel. Good drinkability. There's nothing wrong with this beer, but it would be better if all the flavors were turned up a little. Still, I prefer this to the regular hefe."
"Overall - An OK dunkel weizen... pretty drinkable..."
"Not really much more to say about this one. It is possible that this is simply an old beer. The best before date stated August 2005, so it's about a month past date, but that shouldn't be too bad. Thanx to my buddy Harlan for giving me this bottle."
"Tastes like it smells...soft malt sweetness mingles with the yeast flavor for that classic dunkel flavor. Medium bodied, high carbonation help this one to be very refreshing. Slightly tart and dry towards the finish, with the characteristic German hops making their presence known in the finish. Extremely drinkable, crisp dunkelweizen. A great standard to measure other dunkels against."
"16.9 oz bottle. Exp - 12/2005"
"Not my favorite style, but a solid beer. Has the flavors of a very light Brown Ale or a Viena Lager with the body of a Bavarian Wheat. Got to get over the muddy brown color, but the head, retention, and lacing makes up for it. Faint roasty aromas, mildly cocoa, and lightly estery and tart. Flavors are mildly bready, roasty, cocoa, and fruity. The darker grains tend to mask what I like most in a Wheat. The darker grains don't display enough character to make this beer interesting. It's caught in the middle. There is more malty sweetness than is detected in the first sip. The body is quite large and full. Finishes mildly sweet and slightly dry. No alcohol or hops detected; just for balance. It's a clean, well balanced beer--maybe too balanced. It's ok, you just got to be in the mood for it."
"Overall, a good beer but nothing to write home about."
"A pretty solid Dunkel. A bit on the tame side; non banana-like but worthy with its bold body and dryness of husks and cocoa. Easily sessionable."
"mid sized bottle, with best before dating. Pours the expected dark chocolaty brown with a faint tinge of plums, head quickly goes bye bye and this leaves no lacing (booo). Fruity nose, mouthfeel is kind of sharp and prickly and flavor notes are suprisingly minor, just some cola, overripe bananas and a slight metalic finish, yuck, there are much better dunkle weiss beer out there, give this one a pass, I wish I had..."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with a thick light head. Malty and fruity aroma. Not overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with crisp, almost sharp, carbonation. Flavors of wheat malt and husky grain. Unsweetened chocolate and the slightest hint of banana. Fruitiness emerges in the middle. Finish is smooth. Enjoyable, yet easily forgotten afterwards."
"Appearance is very dark with a hint of red, some foam followed by good lace. Aroma has notes of raisin and cherry, followed by malt and spice. Initial taste contains a clean carbonated malt and grainy brown sugar middle. Finish has a hoppy bite. Chocolate and barley. Very complex."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium brown with a big blooming white head that settles pretty quickly leaving no lace behing,aromas of banana,smoke, and clove dominate here staying true to style wich is very nice.Pick up some banana and clovey spiciness up front flavor wise,finishes with a black liquorice flavor I havent encountered with this style I have to say.Not very complex but enjoyable pretty straight forward and thats ok,not bad I would try again some time for sure."
"The color is a hazy dark brown. Head is large, forthy, and light brown. Retention is very good. The aroma was a little unexpected, rather sparse with a generic spice smell over mild malts. However, the taste is very good. Sweet malts dominate but are enhanced by a mild nutty yeast taste. None of the expected banana/clove flavors were present. A mild herbal hop taste adds complexity. Drinkability is great, I could drink this all day long anytime."
"This one pours a real dark brown with an off-white head that discipates to a thin layer, not much lacing. The smell is yeasty and malty. The taste is malty with a little bit of fruitiness. It is also a little dry and metallic in the finish. The mouthfeel is O.K. medium carbonation. This is an O.K. beer. It didn't really impress me but overall it's O.K. Just O.K. Try it if you are running out of beers to try at your local beer store."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, roasted malt aroma that boasts of crystal malts and roasted barley. It has some yeast fruitiness, but not much. The taste is decent as well. It a dry, earthy flavor that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It goes down slow due to the overwhelming carbonation. It has a slight tart aftertaste, but little sign of wheat malt. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, but I prefer a sweeter, fruitier dunkel. This was neither."
"Decent mouthfeel, smooth, a little bit oily and very light in body. A refreshing beer that would be good once the warmer weather hits."
"Drinks well, best with only a slight chill."
"Bottle. Poured tan with bubbly biege head that disappeared quickly and left hardly any lacing on my weizen glass, which usually picks up heaps of lace. Aroma dominated by caramel malt. Similar with the taste, smooth and mild with a slight metalic coffee finish. Easy drinkin and uncomplicated for a dark beer."
"Flavor mirrors the nose. Ripe banana, bready wheat malt, sweet and sticky and spicy pepper and clove flavors. a lemony finish and sticky in the mouth. Pretty good stuff if not overly complex."
"This brew is a very-dark brown/black color, with brown light hues showing through. Big cream colored head, though the pour was fairly aggressive. Earthy tones with caramel malt on the nose. Wheat characteristics, some clove/banana, along with some level of caramel malt. Highly active on the tounge. Thinner mouth. Not horrible, but could use a little more of the flavoring to become better. Nonetheless, it wont kill you if you try it (See cave creek)."
"A dark brown beer with ruby highlights. Has a small light brown head. There is a nice sweet malty aroma with a good molassess character. The flavor starts with a bit of malty sweetness on the tip of the tongue with thw molassess taste landing on the back of you tongue on the finish."
"WOW! Pours an almost black color, with dark brown at the flute of the glass. A large head unless poured at an extreme angle. Just a perfect taste, almost like no taste because it is so agreeable. I ordered this off of a whim from my favorite bar in London. It has a pseudo creamy taste almost like a stout but much easier to swallow. It has a slight chocolaty finish, but for the most part there aren't any tastes that jump out at you."
"Well, not really excited with this one. This tastes more like a schwarzbier than it does a hefe-weizen. A disappointment. Average at best."
"Pours a hazy sedimented deep reddish brown, capped with a frothy light tan head. Fruity and bubblegummy nose over a base of sweet malt. Light roasty tones compete with a malty sweetness, subtly hopped. Finishes with a slight dryness at the very end. The relative light body makes this easy to drink in quantity."
"Pours a hazy, deep brown body with a beige head that rises about an inch before falling flat. No lacing. Aroma is subdued, with some dark fruits(mostly figs), spicy clove, and a note of ripe banana. I really enjoyed the mouthfeel which is smooth, almost creamy, yet well carbonated. Light medium body. Taste is mostly dark roasty malts, with toffee and dark fruits(more figs), a hint of chocolaty Munich malt, spicy clove, and minimal hops bitterness. Well balanced, but I would have preferred more assertive hops bittering. Very understated, overall, but well constructed and pleasantly drinkable."
"A nice beer, that accompanies Spanish Tapas in a fantastic way, a combination that I really recommend!"
"Overall Impression: Take away the metallic note, and this is a great example of the style. The aroma is lacking, but the taste is fairly solid. It is filling and slightly flawed, so drinkability is a bit impaired, but not a bad beer in my book."
"This brew is certainly worth a try if you are a fan of dunkel-weizens. While other German dunkelweizens may surpass it, this is an easy to drink wheat brew that still maintains a good quality of flavor to it. A nice surprise from Erdinger."
"I love dunkelweizens; I did not like this beer."
"This is a brew that is good in all categories, and is one of my personal favorites. Good whether you just want one, as there is enough flavour to satisfy, or for a session as it goes down easy."
"What a great looking brew. Cloudy walnut brown with a tightly bubbled tan head. Some lacing on the glass as the brew receded. The aroma which was doughy, and clearly wheaten, it was not what I was hoping for. The yeast was faint, no cloves no banana . The taste was mild. In fact it was tough to get beyond the carbonation which was intense almost excessive. I will let it warm up a bit and try again."
"Pours a nice, dark brown color with a towering, large-bubbled, tan head. The head is ever-lasting and impressive. Just a bit of yeastiness, banana, and alcohol in the aroma, and rather muted at that.slight disappointment. Its smooth, creamy, and rather full-bodied. Sweet and fruity. Theres just a little mouth-puckering astringency, but just enough to make you want another sip. Finish is soft and spicy. Its not a top-shelf Dunkel Weizen, but it is good."
"Flavor/Body: Sweet malt on the front, wheat flavor detectable. Esters aren't as prevalent as the aroma would lead one to think. Somewhat neutral on the phenolic side as well. Finish is fairly sweet. Highly carbonated and effervescent."
"Nice looking and creamy. Easy drink but not one that distinguished itself. Some aroma there including cocoa. Bit of different flavours, including nuts but altogether on the thin mouthfeel side. Roast and also a tad burnt wheat. Malty more than anything. Thanks Pootz. Had another bottle straight from Germany and more carbonated less mellow. Thanks Mark."
"never would have thought about a dark wheat as a session beer, but tonight it seems like it would fill that role very well. sadly i only have the one bottle. to be honest i didnt think i had reviewed this yet, but im not too upset as its a classy beer."
"Poured a cloudy, deep redish brown with an off white head that started pretty thick and subsided to a quarter inch of foam with no cling at all. Aroma was of dry malt with a touch of roasted malt and a touch of herbal hops and a banana ester as well. The flavor begins with a rush of carbonation tickling the tongue revealing a dry very wheaty malt flavor with roasted accents but no bitterness associated with roasted malts. The flavor is very clean and easy to drink while still giving the drinker a complex malt flavor. The carbontation is very high which is typical for the style though I find that at the bottom of the glass when the beer has gotten a little flatter that the flavor becomes more balanced and enjoyable. This is an excellent session beer and would be great on either a cold night or a hot summer day as is is very easy to drink yet gives the drinker a good dose of flavor to keep things interesting."
"A few yeas ago, I was fortunate to do some business traveling in Europe and used Munich as the base for the trips. The hotel I stayed at, had Erdinger beer on tap at all of their bars, so I really acquired a taste for this fine product. In a recent trip to Denver, I stopped in at Falling Rock, and saw this beer on draft. I had to try it. If only the reality met the memory. I was mildly disappointed. The beer poured a dark brown with a nice head for a Hefe, and a minimal lace. No real nose to speak of, light citrus aroma, no cloves or malt. The taste was primarily a light malt flavor, and gain, none of the citrus or spice I expected from this beer. As with any Hefeweizen (dunkel or otherwise) it had a nice light mouth feel and was very drinkable. My memories of this beer led me to expect much more. I know the lines had just been cleaned, and the folks at Falling Rock seem to really care for their beer, so I must assume that time had blinded me on the quality of this brew."
"Drinkability is quite high, I will have this one many times."
"Ah, the first beer after getting off the pain meds from a bout of kidney stones. It pours a nice dark brown, darker than other dunkels I ahve had recently. I had to let the head fall a bit before pouring the remainder of the bottle in. The head has fallen to about a finger and a half of nice tan foam. The nose is mostly sweet wheat malt, but there is a bit of caramel in the nose as well. The flavor is more full than the other dunkels I have been drinking. There is more of a roasted flavor, along with a more full wheat flavor in this one. The finish is spicey and delightful. Overall a nice taste. What I find missing is the creamy banana. That detracts just a bit from the flavor. The beer is not quite as creamy as I would like. Its a nice moderate to thick texture, but it needs that added texture from the yeast that I find missing. I like the beer, but I think that there are others in the style that I would pick up again before I tried this one again. Still, worth picking up and trying."
"Overall: Second Erdinger of the evening and definitely another easy going brew just as with the standard Hefe-Weizen, its pretty average, and nothing special."
"The smell and body of this beer were fantastic...very malty and almost thick in aroma...the head was impressive and very rich, making me think I had a rich dunkel-weiss on my hands. Erdinger says it gets its full-bodied taste from fine 'flavor hops' and dark malt. on the contrary, when I tasted it, I was surprised to find just a malty flavored, watery, beverage. Dissappointed with this one."
"The head was exceptionally large, even when poured relatively slowly. Light brown coffee coloured. The beer is not black or brown but a dark dark caramel, toffee, somewhat moccha, and very singular. The head is thick and viscous and very solid; chunky. The aroma is deliciously sweet, recalling grape-juice, raisins, and fruity-sweet yeast, akin to some Belgian fruit beers. The aroma was very bewildering--I did not expect this sweetness, but the surprise was welcomed: I love a sweet beer. So the malt combines supremely with the yeast and exudes an ultra-sweet aroma, mouth-wateringly rich. There are some drier smells, hops hiding in the background, but I picked out mostly the tart sugariness of the nose. This really smells like a yeasty Belgian, but I am sure the Germans have been producing this wonderful yeasty smell for just as long as the Belgians. However, it is the first German beer I have tried with such strong yeasty sweet fruitiness. Ambrosial. The taste is very sweet too, where the dark malt announces itself, but not like a stout--this malt makes itself more known as a grainy, sweet, creamy caramel. I suppose the wheat is detectable, but the barley malt is too. Grapes, dates, dusty yeast, flowery sweet honey and candy-like flavours. The two malts make for a crisp and highly refreshing dark lager. This is exceptional, and it suits my personal palate very well. Dark, sweet, yeasty, and preeminently drinkable. I could quaff these all day, summer or winter."
"This did not in any way taste like the color hinted. It was a smooth easy-drinking beer, and although it was not remarkable it went down nice and easy. I'd recommend it to fans of wheat beers, but not with the expectation that there would be a lot of depth to it like a dunkel would usually have."
"In the mouth it feels full and soft without being syrupy. It has a nice rich feel to it. Overall, I find this beer to be quite drinkable."
"Pours a thick, opaque, brown color, and is topped by a thick light brown head. Enticing aromas of raisins, caramel, and toast waft from my glass to my nose. Overall the aroma is quite fruity as well. The taste is mildly sweet and finishes with a hint of clove, and smooth mellowness. This has some really nice bready notes mixed with caramel and biscuit flavors. There is a dry finish, which begs for you to take another sip. This is a nice enjoyable example, that could use, perhaps, a bit more of the traditional Hefe flavors, but it is quite good as is."
"Drinkability: could drink many, but for a hot weather brew give me a pilsner"
"Very big, gray-tan head. Dense, uneven foam. Cloudy, dark brown beer. The aroma: spicy, but there's a little sour milk. It's kind of sick, but not really off-putting. Strange. The creamy, sweet, fruity front registers bananas, strawberries and cherries. Bring in the chocolatey malt of the equally fruity middle and I'm getting black forest cake. And nuts in the finish. I really like this. It starts creamy with bananas and strawberries, through chocolate to a nutty finish: this is a banana split!"
"This is a well-made, drinkable beer, It tastes to me that, like Erdinger Hefe, this is made from fairly hard water. (I could be wrong about this.) Although this doesn't taste much like other German dunkelweizens, it's a good beer when judged without reference to it's labeled style."
"Very nice dunkel, its grown on me over time"
"Magnificent to the eye: deep opaque brown under a beautiful firm tan head that creates a crown above the glass and lasts forever, leaving good lace. The nose is very mild, in fact, I'm not picking up much of anything at all The mouth is light and quite prickly. The flavors are also very mild, with just a touch of spice and an initial hint of caramel. The taste is actually quite watery, with neither yeast nor hops. There is essentially no aftertaste. Real disappointment."
"This one looks and smells like a big wheat dunkel. Poured a lush cloudy mahogany red with a big frothy off-white meringue cap. Light but steady effervescence. Aromas of dried fruits currants, prunes mingle with cinnamon and cloves....wonderful nose on this beer. Starts bold with a big ol wack of sweet toasty malt then builds to a creamy mouth feel punctuated with banana, spices and other ester tastes as malt and hops fuse on the tongue. Then the finish is fairly clean for such a big beer...almost watery with little more than a sweet malt after taste. This is a good import beer and a great representastion of the dunkel style in the wheat beer tradition. I like it and will always have a bottle or two around."
"Medium-dark brown in color with a huge tan head. Pour carefully, not over white carpet. Aroma is very muted, tending towards chocolate and a touch bready. Flavor is malty with cocoa and fruits tending more towards the dark end of the spectrum. Mouthfeel is light, but toward the medim end of the weissbier range. Good drinkability, but somewhat lacking in complexity."
"Light bodied with good effervesence. Nice and refreshing. A little light in the smell and taste department. Looking forward to trying more Dunkel Weissbiers to get a better idea of the style."
"I like the style, but this beer is too much like candy. Too sweet with no real depth."
"This is a great beer. It is a beer of contradictions--a dark beer that is light and refreshing; a wheat beer that is complex and flavorful and a beer that can be both a sipping beer and a thirst quencher. I could drink this beer anytime of the year and feel that it is the right time to drink it."
"Medium-low body. Aftertaste with predominance of liquorice and woody notes, but even with some bitter. Drinkable."
"Came in a 50cl bottle. It poured a cloudly dark brown color. The tan colored head was tremendous. Even with the gentlelist pour the head was more than the height of the beer in the glass. Highly carbonated, very malty and crisp. Not much bitterness or hopiness. As for the beer, poor drinkability because too much carbonation because it was overly carbonated."
"Beats Budweiser, but there are better beers."
"Malt is apparent up front in the aroma & makes a bigger statement immediately on the tongue, but it soothes wonderfully to a creamy wheat sweetness. Yum! Yum! Mild roast & toasts flavors come in & play with subtle bitter hints. A wondrously subtle yet complex beer."
"The first time I ever tried this style, and it won't be the last time I go back to this beer, or the style."
"i like my dark beers to be a bit more powerful than this, but this dunkel ranks highly on the drinkability charts. very smooth, clean and crisp, it has a pleasant subdued nature which allows continued drinking. another enjoyable beer from erdinger."
"This one pours a nice dense coffee colour. Streams and streams of small bubbles rise from the depths to create a wispy head that quickly dissapates. The nose is very, very subtle with sweet fruity notes. The taste and mouthfeel are a bit lacking. It just doesn't have richness one would expect from a dark wheat. I would not make an effort to find this one."
"Nice dark pour, extremely foamy for this type of brew, taste was enjoyable but somewhat light and thin for a weisbier, sort of reminded me of what a lite American malt liquor would taste like. It was OK but not at the top of my list.Weissbiers should be a little bolder than this."
"Summation: A good brew and something I would not pass up in and of itself."
"Pours a dark color with hints of gold. Although carbonation is persistent, head is short-lasting and disappears before the finish. Smell is sweet, somewhat like maple syrup. Taste is much more sweet than bitter, and I feel the substance is only mediocre, giving the bulk of the spicy flavor only in the aftertaste. Not a bad brew but not the best either."
"A bemused deep brown beer with a large and steady head that is light tan in color and frothy in its texture, as it slowly erodes a thick and glutinous sheet of lace blocks off the glass. Roasted grains, sweet caramel, refreshing is this nose also a light hint of yeast, start thick malt, sweet, and the top rich and somewhat full. Finish is perfectly hopped, the carbonation benign, dry aftertaste, a quite quaffable beer."
"Comments  This is currently labeled as a dunkel weitzen. It is completely off-style from this and is more like a classic German schwartz (black) bier. I rated this in accordance with this style."
"This is a decent beer. I have had better, but this one was most certainly not awful. The quite dark appearance is intriguing and its smell was quite lovely, too. However, to be that dark and smell the way that it does, the taste wasn't as aggresive or powerful as I was expecting. Very pleasant taste and fair mouth feel to say the very least, just not as bold as I was anticipating. I felt that a rating of 3.5 was in order for drinkability. It is indeed quite easy to drink, there are just better beers available and I feel given this rating system, 3.5 is the most suitable rating for this one."
"Deep brown color, large white foamy head. Nice malty and fruity nose. Malts are slightly sweet. Chocolate, caramel and a slight touch of vanilla. A milder flavored Dunkel. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Drinkability: only average. I could drink more of this beer but with the lack of taste, why should I bother? A pretty big let-down. I was hoping for more."
"Very enjoyable! Dark, slightly cloudy. Fruity aroma with a slight hint of tobacco (sounds strange I know). The taste profile is very similar to the aroma. I found it to be lighter in the mouth than expected with a light dry finish. I am enjoying this beer as much in winter as I did in the summer, when I found it to be an excellent thirst quencher."
"Not bad, just not much. Thanks to JohnnyDuvel for the sample."
"Originally sampled on 26 April 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This pours an opaque brown color with a tan head. The aroma is malty. The flavor is malty. This is a very drinkable dunkel. It's slightly sour, but very nice to drink. definitely worth trying"
"When poured into my glass, this beer had a medium sized head with small bubbles. The lacing was good on the sides of my glass and there was some carbonation observed with this beer. I found this beer to be very smooth along with a very good flavor. This is a beer that I definitely could drink all night at a bar or party. Party on!!"
"I love German brews. Upon pouring this brew I noticed a highly carbonated and very lively brew with an excellent light brown head that contained very fine creamy bubbles and lasted a very long time. Its aroma was very pleasant and filled with malt. It has a very malty taste that goes down superbly smooth with a hint of aftertaste. It has notes of mellow caramel and deep dark malt. Some carbonation was noticeable on the tip of my tongue. Its taste was excellent and very much to my liking. Exactly what I expect of a great German beer and very SMOOTH!"
"A very drinkable Dunkel Weizen with chocolate flavors and a nice head retention throughout the beer. Low carbonation for a Weizen and was sampled at Erdinger's Brewery. This beer has a roasty smell and is delicious, made well and has a great malt character."
"Came in a brown 500ml bottle, freshness date marked on the back. When held to the light is a deep oak colour, a deep cloudy brown with reddish highlights. Thickish spongy tan head that recedes but lasts. Nose is of malt and spice. Flavour is sweet, I can't quite put my finger on that predominant taste, like anise and sour cherry, but not quite... Grainy undertones. This is very drinkable, far more than what I had expected, I'm quite impressed."
"Very dark and hazy brown color with a glistening tan head of 1/2 an inch, medium duration, and slight lacing. Sweet malty aromas, slight diacetyl butter impression along with some wheat grain of a mild toastiness. Medium mouthfeel with mild esters and a caramel sense overall. Fruit (currants) mid mouth. Finishes light and without ""suffocating"" properties that I note in many Wheat Dunkels. An impressive beer in a style that often leaves me cold."
"A nice beer to try but not the best dunkel. Pours a dark close-to black tone with a brownish, thick and consistent head. Its smell gives off a nice malty feel with some acidic and bitter presence. The taste, clearly malty and wheaty is accompanied by some soury and bitter mouthfeels that enhance the mouthfeel. Despite all, it is a little watery. A good beer afterall."
"The color is deep dark ruby. A small creamy brown head floats on top for a while. The aroma is wheat, clove, pepper and a little medicinal. There is nothing bad about the taste of this beer other than it seems very watered down compared to others I have had of this style. There is really not a lot going on with the flavor profile. Some light notes of dark malt. Very little of the typical weizen characteristics. Just a dab of pepper. Close to light in body. An uninspiring experiment."
"This is a beer I've always enjoyed, and it stands out as a somewhat unique offering for the style. Not nearly as spicy or ""clovey"" as many other wheat beers. Smooth and tasty, and I enjoy it more than it's stronger ""Pinkatus"" version. Pours a very impressive head, which remains throghout. Ranks right up there with my favorite wheat beers, and provides a nice alternative."
"500ml bottle Pours a deep redish brown with a moderate head that receded quickly. Slight lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt, with a vague hint of banana and clove. Strong carbonation that I prefer, and a creamy soft mouthfeel that really quenches the thirst. A very fine dark wheat! Then I am partial to wheats!"
"Dark caramel colored beer pours with a mountainous tan head that maintains a rocky layer. Yeasty, malty aroma with a decent clove component and just a touch of banana. Also a surprising hop note in the aroma. The taste is almost non-existent when it first hits your tongue, but then roasted malt, chocolate, faint banana, and a touch of breadiness (less than expected) appear, all finished off by a touch of bitterness. This beer has less sweetness and richness than many weizens, and actually reminds me of a dark lager in some ways, such as the finish, some of the roasted flavor, and the mouthfeel. But these are not neccessarily bad qualities. The carbonation is a bit too enthusiastic at first, but as it warms just slightly is takes on a much smoother mouthfeel and seemingly a finer carbonation. The drinkability is very good, and I'm sure this could be a regular year-round wheat beer for many persons. I really liked this dunkel, although I am a fan of the weizen style in general."
"First tasting on 26may04 - Dark brown opaque body with a thick white head that stays to the last drop. Mellow aroma of soy sauce. Higher bitterness than I have ever tasted in a wheat, but still subdued. Malty brown sugar (but not sweet) flavor. Medium body with fading after taste. Yummy, this 500 ml was gone in a flash. Gimme another."
"The bartender took his time and poured this one slowly with perfect head. Quite dark, almost mahogany colored and off white mountain of suds. Smell of caramel and a little sweet. Very smooth on the palate withy a buttery creamy texture. Taste is a litle spicy, slightly bitter and nicely rounded out."
"Taste: More malt, with an extremely soft and creamy mouthfeel. Very quenching, with just a hint of dryness in the finish. Yeast is more apparent as it warms, with just a tad bit of alcohol present in the end. My mouth feels sugar-coated, but the sweetness is offset well enough by this brew's bready, wheaty charms that I'm quite enamored by the result."
"This beer pours a clear very dark reddish brown color with a large tan head and a firm mouthfeel. The smell is of roasted malt and raisins while remaining somewhat crisp and clean. The taste is rounded malt and slight bubblegum. Overall a nicely rounded crisp, clean beer with very little alcohol taste. Enjoyable."
"Its always nice to see a listing of all ingredients on the labelnow if only North American breweries would get on board with that."
"This beer poured a dark amber almost brown with a great off white to light tan head. The head retention was excellent and left a lace on the glass for the entire 500 ml. The aroma was not strong and had only a hint ot malt. This is probably its biggest flaw. The taste particularly in the first few swallows had a delightful maltiness but not overpowering. There might be a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel was almost creamy but not quite and had a bit of carbonation which tingled the tongue. This is a great session beer. I might not offer this to someone wanting to know the style characteristics but certainly would offer this to someone trying out different beers."
"Pours a VERY dark almost cola-like brown. Reminds one a lot of a dark stout. Pours with a nice head. A good dark weiss to be sure, although I still felt it ""paled"" (no pun intended) in comparison to some of the others such as Weihenstephan or Franziskaner dark. Still, it is a very smooth, very tasty brew and I would gladly accept it if offered!"
"Very dark, murky, muddy brown. A large tan head forms. The aroma is yeasty and sweet. The aroma speaks well for the flavors in this beer; it's a mellow yeasty and sweet, very smooth. It's medium bodied, very smooth mouthfeel. I prefer regular hefewiezens more than dunkels, but this is an enjoyable brew."
"Erdinger weisbeer dunkel; Deep brown/hazy body. Huge head that has great staying power. Sweet aroma, with yeasty notes. Wow that is easy drinking, smooth and flavorful. The main flavor is a sweet malt, but its got a little bit of yeast/weiss beer taste. Very nice, very easy to drink."
"Cheers"

"I got this one in a completely black 500ml bottle. I was very curious on how it would look, not suprisingly it poured up very dark, it looked really awesome. I have to say I think it had a bit of watery taste, it's a bit disappointing because it felt like it had more to give. The main wheat taste however had a touch sweet toffee. This is definitely a beer I will buy again."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy. A very good example for the style."
"Deep garnet in color with a large off-white head that unfortunately fades to a paper thin layer in a minute or two. Mildly carbonated with excellent lace. Rich aroma of black bread, molasses, and dark fruits, as well as pronounced alcohol notes. Taste begins with zesty carbonation, semi-sweet cocoa notes, caramel, molasses, and almost wine-like dark fruit notes. Midway through the taste malt flavors become a little more pronounced, yielding a dark bread flavor. Finish is mildly spicy and a touch hoppy with a little residual sweetness. A complex and satisfying beer, perfect for a winter's afternoon."
"This is a dark, dark brown beer, on the verge of black with a sort of tan head. The smell of roasted malts and wheat filled my nose with its pleasant aroma. The taste was of a sweet, malty wheat with an after taste that was again, pleasant, but not long enough. That was the only set back about this beer, the finish was to short! But, I still liked it!"
"[16.9 oz - 500ml] for $1.99 -- A bargain but pay a bit more for the Weihenstephaner..."
"I have been on a big German kick lately so why stop. This beer doesn't have much of a smell at all and the taste is very mild. Pours dark brown in color, almost like a Porter with a healthy head. Starts out kind of thin but has a great aftertaste. Malty and smooth in the finish. I solid beer but not outstanding."
"I hope Im not coming down with a cold or something, because I really could not pick up on a lot of flavor from this brew."
"Notes: Spicy with a clean zip, rich malty flavours from start to end. This makes for a near stellar brew of such a delicate style."
"A most delicious dunkel weissbier. A highly recommended brew ... from this expert weissbier brewer."
"Not bad, I guess. It's just not what I expected."
"As a fan of the Dunkel Weizen style, I really looked forward to trying this one... unfortunately I was a bit dissapointed.  Very dark, almost black with a foamy head.  Aroma was very understated, with a touch of clove, chocolate, and banana.  Flavor was weak, with hints of banana and clove.  Very watery, with unusually high carbonation.  Not a very good representation of the style in my opinion."
"Better head than on the weissbeer. Darker than I was expecting despite the dunkel name. Same well balanced, mild aroma and flavor with the addition of a hint of chocolate in the aroma and flavor. The clove and esters weren't as much of the profile here, though."
"Mit Feiner Hefe In Der Flasche Gereift  Whos a jelly doughnut?"
"Pours very dark brown with reddish hue on the edges.  Pleasant tan head is surprisingly large and persistent.  Despite that, aroma is a bit subdued.  Taste is interestingly consistent from beginning to end with a nice weissbier alcohol bite showing up more at the end.  Mouthfeel is nice, with excellent drinkability for a dunkel weissbier."
"The very persistent, billowy, creamy and dense krauzen - like head tops a turbid ruddy brown hued brew w/ profuse threads of bubbles.  Light banana esters and carob dominate in aroma, with grainy wheat tartness secondary.  A touch tame aromawise.  Flavorwise, mellow chocolate malt emerges first, followed by notes of toasty Munich and caramel malt sweetness.  Mild banana esters persist at a constant level from start to finish.  Lightly bodied for style, but viscous enough in mouthfeel to help lend excellent drinkability.     Finishes mostly clean, w/ trace bubblegum esters quickly fading.  Not an outstanding example of the style, but certainly well rounded, flavorful and highly drinkable."
"Shiny dark brown, wet shoe leather color. Big, fizzy, tan head. Full of sweet necter and thick yeast smells. Lots of sweet, but not syrupy, malt taste. Great balance of the natural wheat flavors, subtle bananas, and clove, and a really good rich creamy sweet malt middle. Nice crisp and clean finish. You expect a dark beer to be a little more bodied, but it is very refreshing, and really easy to drink. I had this with leftover roast beef, roasted red potatos, steamed vegetables.  A great beer with dinner."
"A fuller, smoother wheat beeer that is malty sweet.  Why not?  Try one out.  Cheers!"
"(Paired with a specialty sandwich from my local Alpen sandwich shop: well-done roast beef, shredded lettuce, Bernaise sauce on Bavarian black bread. The sandwiches from this terrific store - I hate to call it a deli - always go excellently with well-made German beers... but this was a particular match in heaven.)"
"Nice translucent, deep red/brown color with nice carbonation.  Pours with a very thick, long lasting, tan head.  Slightly citrusy aroma and flavor.  I enjoyed this more than the Pinkatus.  A refreshing beer."
"Pours a murky brown, and when held up to the light a slightly tan-ish tint appears. Malt aromas on the nose.  On the palate malt flavors appear up front, then slight carmel tones, then finally the tiniest hints of banana poke through.  Rather smooth and quite enjoyable!  Overall a very enjoyable weissbier dunkel..."
"This is an excellent weissbier.  Very dark in color, like coffee or birch beer, but the flavor is lighter than it looks. Slight sweet with a fruity palate.  There are hints of vanilla or honey.  Goes down smoothly.  Drink with a pinch of lemon to enhance its flavor.  Try drinking on a hot day.  Very refreshing."
"Pours a very dark hazy brownish color with a nice big tan head.  The smell is of sweet dark malts.  Taste starts off with dark maltiness and then goes into a nice smooth wheat flavor with hints of bananas and you are left with a taste of chocolate on your tongue.  Nice and creamy and very drinkable.  A great brew.  Great smoothness and a nice wheaty backbone to the flavor make it very drinkable."
"Nice dark amber color with light tan head.  Very nice aroma with hints of chocolate.  Malt and sweet flavors with not trace of hops.  Not overly complex but nicely balanced.  Good carbonation.  Extremely easy to drink.  My first dunkel.... I think I will be trying more."
"A nice Dunkel, but lacks some flavour, still light and easy to drinkable, and hints of chocolate and banana, smooth aswell."
"But I disagree with the previous note: I never could find any chocolate bits in the its taste..."
"Darkest dunkel I've encountered with little if any of those wonderful bubblegum/bannana aromas.  A little roasty on the palate but was otherwise pretty bland.  Drank almost like a weak porter(?).  Not bad, but there are better (Edelweiss)."
"Creamy head, as if cream was added to it.  Definetely better if poured completely into a glass so all the yeast is removed from the bottle and into your belly.   Great color."
