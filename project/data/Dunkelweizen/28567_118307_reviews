"Overall - Not egregiously over the best by date, but is probably a lesser beer than what was initially brewed. Having said that, I didn't find much to think this is a much better brew when fresh. I've had dunkels way out of freshness date with significantly more flavor than this. If I ever get the chance to re-review with a fresher sample though, I find it my due diligence to do so."

"Really great that Tin Man got the official beer of Star Trek."

"Taste is surprisingly toasty and malty, with plenty of fruit undertones and a spicy, sharp rye malt character. Seems to be pretty faithful to the style, but I had a tough time choking this one down with all the sweetness and spice overwhelming my palate."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium to dark bronze amber with a one finger off-white head that dissipates to patchy foam and a ring around the glass. Nice aroma of caramel malt, rye, brown sugar, hints of clove. Flavor follows, dominated by caramel malt, syrup, light rye sourness, hints of clove and hops. Starts semi-sweet and finishes drier and a bit starkly with residual sharp rye and hits of hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. I can actually see Klingons drinking this, it has enough malt and character to not seem like some weak creature's beer. Would have liked a bit more rye; the aroma leans towards a roggenbier, but the flavor is solidly in dunkelweizen territory. As either, it's OK, not amazing. As a Klingon ale, a perhaps a bit thin and tame, but acceptable. Quite drinkable and a nice can. And I don't say that about every alien beer."

"Overall: this feels more like a roggenbier than a dunkelweizen, but it does contain elements of both. It doesn't have enough delicious banana-and-clove to be a really great dunkelweizen, but there are rye elements here that work well. It is bready and hearty, to be sure, which I'm sure would appeal to Klingon sensibilities."

"I suppose that the blending of styles is de rigueur of late, and German ones, despite their entrenched laws, are fair game on this side of the pond. Here, we have a roggenbier-assaulted dunkelweizen, one where the invading rye more or less eclipses the native wheat, and adds insult to injury by propping up a ghost of the clove and banana esters. Yup, from what I know about this part of Star Trek lore, that seems about right."
"Taste is pretty much like the smell, I would have never guess this is a wheat beer, tilts more towards a weak brown. I found it a little thin on the mouth. A little more carbonation would be nice. I probably wouldn't have again. A star trek collectors item and that's all."
