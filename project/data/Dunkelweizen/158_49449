3.92,8.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a warm and inviting clear brown tinged with golden red, almost mahogany, with a fairly decent light tan head. Aroma is strong, yeasty and wheaty with a hint of citrus. Pleasing flavor is mainly wheaty with hints of fruit - mainly pear and apple plus a subtle note of orange - and wood. There is also just a whisper of cloves. Texture has average body but plenty of fizz, leaving a persistent tingle and a fruity, wheaty finish.","Cyberkedi","Jun 06, 2011"
3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a slightly hazy chestnut with a mediocre head that fades to a thin cap. In the nose, you get some notes of banana, some lemony citrus, and the barest hint of clove. Definitely on the lighter side. The taste is also a bit light , but there are nice notes of banana and clove that grow as the beer warms. Smooth and spicy in the mouth. Definitely on the lighter side for a dunkelweizen, but smooth and pretty tasty, especially on-tap.","Georgiabeer","Apr 18, 2011"

3.97,9.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a muddy brown color, as the bottle describes it, visible carbonation. The head disappointed me a bit, most wheat beers present much better head with good retention, this one had a decent head, but retention was poor. Smell was of clove, wheat, brown sugar and a little bit of raisin. Taste is great, as far as American made dunkels go, this is pretty good in the taste department. Sweet wheat taste with just a little bit of alcohol present in my nose as I sip (since the head has now fully receded) the taste is good, but would not stack up to something like weihenstephaner. Overall, a decent representation of the style for an American brewer, but there are better offerings in the same genre available to me that I would rather buy.","gkunkle","Jan 15, 2011"

Nice munich-type malt flavor late and lingering into the aftertaste. There is also phenolic cardboardy character that I find rather off-putting. Md body and moderate carbonation. Fair drinkability, would be moreso if I enjoyed the style. This bottle was a gift that I enjoyed trying, but won't revisit. Judged to style, not my preferences.

3.23,-10.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a light brown with a two-finger head that takes forever to die and leaves minor lace around the glass. A funky roasted malt aroma and hints of bready yeast but not much sweetness nor is there very much in way of lemon/citric zest or spices. Light-to-medium bodied that for some reason has a smokey edge and while trying to combine with the spices and citric hops it doesn't mesh well. So basically a rather dry malted hefe with very little in the citric/spice taste category that is well-carb'd so it finishes crisp, dry but bland. Minimal sweet malts like caramel and very hard to notice pepper and clove in there as well. A nice attempt at this style but not very good and the price isn't exactly inviting me to buy another.","clayrock81","Jun 16, 2010"

Smells of nuts, malt, slight peat, chocolate and small roast. Taste is roasted malt up top blending into a nutty assortment going into chocolate. A small earthy hop kick somewhere towards the beginning. Nothing to big. Feel is medium and lightly carbed. It goes down like a dunkel should so there's that.

This one has some characteristics more akin to a dunkel lager than a dunkelweiss...strong nutty presence, honey malt sweetness and some grassy hops. Mouthfeel is good, as it has a nice creaminess to it but seems to fall a bit short of some of the best German D-weiss'.

2.36,-34.8,3.5,2.5,2,3.5,2,"I paid $6 for a 22oz bomber which is awfully expensive for a dunkel weizen. I generally respect Great Divide so I went ahead and bought a bottle anyway. My bottle had a recent bottling date of April 17, 2009. When poured, it looked okay. The head was a bit small for a wheat beer, but it wasn't a big deal. The label claimed a German yeast was used, and the aroma seemed to back that up. I could smell a bit of banana/clove character which I like. Unfortunately, the taste was a bit disappointing. It has some of that banana/clove character, but the phenols seem to be slightly out of whack. Either that or they just don't mix well with the slightly off-putting grainy/dark flavor. I like some quality German dunkel weizen beers, but this beer has something in it that doesn't sit well with me. It's almost some sort of unpleasant dirty/dirt-ish flavor. Whatever it is, it gets worse as the beer warms. I was only able to get through half the bomber before I had to dump what was left. I like that GD is doing some new/seasonal beers, but I'll look elsewhere when it comes to dark wheat beers.","ohmybock","Jun 07, 2009"

4.04,11.6,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"The head is a coppery brown color, tops off at a finger plus but made of large enough bubbles that they pop off into a thin coating across the surface, lacing doesn't stick around very long either. Reddish brown liquid with a slight orange lightening at the rims, solid haze gives it as much translucency as you can get without opacity. Very sweet and thick nose of clove, molasses, honey and caramel, with no lack of pralines, milk chocolate powder, apricot, cherry fruit with a touch of banana and, perhaps, tangerine. Full-bodied, finds more balance here with a hoppy floral mist and little grassy nip before the clove, nutmeg spice and molasses, butterscotch and caramel take over. The carbonation puts up a good struggle against the density but eventually falters and gets squeezed out through the mid-palate. Smooth enough mouth feel, allows the apricot, peach, pear and mango fruit to slowly spread wide. Minor pie crust or fruit bread notes. Could probably have been made denser, a good thing it was not.","farrago","Beers"
3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Dunkel Weiss is a good Dunkelweizen that isn't quite good enough to compete with the world's finest. Nonetheless, it's a little better than you might expect from a Dunkelweizen hailing from Colorado. Having said that, it could be better. It would benefit from more strength on the nose and a stronger banana presence (in smell and in flavor). Nonetheless, I like it. It's grown on me more with each passing sip. A little warming helps a lot. The nose and the flavor seem to open up and its body feels more substantial. I kind of liked the first half of the bottle and I really liked the second half. Overall, it's good and I have no hesitation recommending it. Once again, I'm pleased with the direction Great Divide is taking. Keep rolling out good new beer, guys.","prototypic","0"
3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a murky brown color with a solid head. Smell is wheaty with slight bananas in the nose. Taste is cloves, banana and wheat. Unfortunately, the taste was a little bit more subdued than I was hoping for. Decent amount of carbonation. Overall, a decent brew. Not my favorite dunkelweizen though.","jdubjacket","May 27, 2009"

3.57,-1.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Not as malty in the taste as I thought it would be. Spice, clove, banana, some bready yeast and malt. Maybe it's be, but I think this style should be a slight bit sweeter or maltier than a saison. Not that this is a saison, but it more closely resembles one to me. It's good. That's true. Very drinkable.","Mebuzzard","May 19, 2009"
4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Although I don't have much experience with the style, I picked up an authentic German example (from the BA top 10) and had it earlier today. I don't know how true this is to the originals but it's a tasty beer in it's own right.","GilGarp","May 12, 2009"

3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"EDIT: The 2010 version of this beer I find myself absolutely loving. It's still expensive and only in bombers, but it's more affordable at the tap room. There's a distinct flavor that can almost be described as like peanut butter that I love.","Domingo","May 08, 2009"

3.46,-4.4,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"22oz bottle $7.49. Dark chestnut, not brown. Smells quite wheaty and tastes like cloves, wheat, yeasty, not bad for a dunkelweizen at all. Too bad there are plenty of German examples which are cheaper and are obviously a tad bit more authentic. Still, this was interesting and I am glad to see Great Divide releasing new beers in bombers.","ArrogantB","Apr 28, 2009"
3.75,3.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a deerper amber color (almost brown) with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of breadiness, wheat, toast, and some fruitiness. Tastes of bananas, wheatiness, some spices, and lighter roastiness. Lacing left on the glass.","hopdog","Beers"
4.47,23.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is one of three new beers that I know of from these guys, the other two being Saison and Belgica. I like the blurb on the side of the bottle telling the drinker not to add any lemon to this. Decadent pour reveals a cloudy dark red, with a large white head. Musty smells of banana, brown bread and bubblegum come through in the aroma. Overall the smell is juicy. Taste is still incredibly juicy, but with a beautiful wheat backbone. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation and flavor to make it complex, yet approachable. This is an easy drinker, but it deserves to be sipped. A great beer here from Great Divide that is as good, if not better than many of the great German examples. Hopefully this is a year round offering. Not to be missed for wheat beer lovers.","jamie2dope","0"
