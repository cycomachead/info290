Excellent appearance and decent smell but then the taste did not follow. Overall it was a decent beer that I enjoyed drinking but would not likely buy again.","JamieDuncan","Jan 07, 2014"

4.09,16.2,4,4.25,4,4.25,4,"Mmmm! Nice. Dark murky creamy bitter... Brings out the best of both Parmigiano Reggiano and the Dunkelweisen characteristics as a perfect matching set. Wanted to try it with some dry sharp white cheddar but there was none in the house tonight. Yea, it's December. Yea, it snowed most of today. And yea, wheat beer is fashionably way out of season right now, but I have a special fetish for a wheat any day of the year. Gimme that light, easy drinking dark wheat stuff and I'll drink it as happily as any other beer winter or summer. I'm gonna visit this brewery and get some more of Neshaminy Creek's good stuff in me.","rixcat","0"

2.31,-34.4,3,2,2.5,2,2.25,"On the fuller end of medium body with a prominent zesty clove presence up front but again, there's an artificial chemical-like flavor coming in mid-palate that throw things off a bit. It's not as offensive as in the nose but it takes away from the spice, banana bread and sweet malts. The bread and banana flavors stand out more than in the nose as do the sweet chocolate malt notes. Sweet chocolate with caramel, toffee and biscuit. Again, the metallic solvent like character shows up in the finish, lingering a bit after the swallow. Overall, this beer has some decent flavor but it's buried underneath a mess of other things that don't work well for the style.","corby112","Sep 11, 2013"

3.5,-0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Rather nice, on the lighter side of being medium bodied. Like the hefe by neshaminy lots of banana notes through out. really does taste like a chocolate dipped banana in a good. Bright effervescence that really break the body up. Slightly medicinal finish. Faint sweetness, some bready notes, a pretty complex low abv beer. Balanced and clean on the back end unlike the hefe, chocolate and caramel notes all blend together into one nice concise and somehow refrshing sip. Pretty good. A little bit of burnt toast comes into play at times that doesnt blend as well but overall a pretty good beer. Lingering banana and hearty breads in the mouth.","jtierney89","Sep 05, 2013"

3.49,-0.9,5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Update: Picked up growler and bottles of the 2014 release. The mouthfeel is not as thick and rich as the 2013. The aroma and taste are similar, but less sweet and dense. The dark fruits are missing this year and it is closer to a Bavarian dunkelweizen in density and flavor. The sourness now dominates the palate and the malty sweetness takes a backseat. The bitterness in the finish are still bold which should please the trendy IPA crowd.","wattoclone","Jun 20, 2013"

4.06,15.3,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Muddy brown in color and murky with an orangish hue. Poured with a billowy white foam with good staying power that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet banana aroma is dominant with hints of earthy grain and dark bread in the background. Medium bodied, a bit syrupy, with tight, tangy carbonation through the middle. Sweet banana flavor throughout with peppery spices in tow that peak with a tangy bite through the middle. A pleasant spicy hop flavor ushers in the end as this finishes with a sweet, slightly yeasty, slighty spicy aftertaste.","IronLover","Feb 08, 2013"
