3.62,-1.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, dark fruit, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a better smell than flavor in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 11, 2012"

The price is a problem, it's pretty much the most expensive dunkelweisse on the shelf, and it's not the best so it's hard to make it a repeat buy even though I like the beer.","Halcyondays","Aug 22, 2011"

3.76,1.9,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This was liquid apple pie. Brown pour. Nice head. About 4 finger in hef glass. Nose of apples and hef yeast. Palate and feel is quite nice. Apples and crisp end both dry from hopping and mineral with a toasty malt note. Although once the carbonation goes its a very plain drink. First half was better than the second. And thats saying a long seeing a good hef is for the thirsty.","rtepiak","Mar 18, 2011"
3.77,2.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"nice medium brown pour with a slight reddish touch to the sides yielded a nice head of off white that stuck to the sides of the glass fairly well as it trickled down. aroma is nice and earthy with touches of roasted nuts and caramel coming through as it warms. nice deep flavor, nothing over the top but nice and consistent for the style, about what i would expect from them. deep sweet malts are driven home in the finish with a long taste of caramel that really just drives it home.","mikesgroove","Mar 07, 2011"

2.96,-19.8,4,3,3,3,2.5,"This is one of those beers that look and smell great, but when you actually try to drink it, it leaves a bit to be desired. It pours a beautiful golden brown color, has an excellent malty aroma as well. But when you drink it, the taste is bitter and it is very chunky beer. I was a bit disappointed in this one, but hey, it could of been alot worse!","ronniebruner","Jan 08, 2011"

3.36,-8.9,4,3,3,4,4,"Bought this to compare it to the Franziskaner Dunkelweisse. It was served from a bottle into a pint glass. It poured a cloudy, opaque, brown/caramel color w/ an offwhite head. The smell was wheaty and even sour. The taste was clean and a little sour. The taste wasn't very impressive or complex. I would have almost said insipid, but after letting it warm a little, it gave more flavor. It had good drinkability because it was refreshing and not heavy.","Fillpott","Oct 12, 2009"

4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Rather decent Dunkleweisse, but nothing special. pours ark brown with offwhite head. Nose is fairly active with some traditional banana/clove of the regular Hefe, but also some fresh baked brownbread maltiness. Palate is somewhat thin bodied, but the fruity flavors come through as well. Nothing spectacular but not worth passing up either.","yemenmocha","Dec 16, 2008"
3.97,7.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy brown color with a thick billowing head. Really good lacing. Aroma is basically predominantly bananna with some roasted malt. The body is medium. Good carbonation. The flavor is a combination of soft chocolate malt with wheat beer fruitiness. It's very well balanced. A good dark wheat beer.","bigbelcher","Mar 09, 2008"
3.14,-14.9,4,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours opaque brown with a thick, foamy, rocky off-white head. Metallic wheat aroma, with only a small amount of clove and bubblegum. Sour wheat taste at first, but after 2-3 pulls, it gets a nice cereal taste with a good amount of banana. I've had better, but this is not that bad.","magictrokini","Mar 04, 2008"

3.58,-3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours out a deep caramel color, settling in the glass as murky brown. In the aroma, there are notes of apple cider and spice. Caramel and raisins appear as it warms. Unfortunately they don't really meld together. As for the taste, it's a smooth taste, one which tends to be more apple dominant. Bitterness is very low, with the spice providing the balance to the apple. Light feel of alcohol is felt when the beer lands in the stomach. Overall, it does the job.","DoubleJ","Oct 25, 2007"

3.76,1.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Hazy deep brown/black, with a 1"" off-white foamy head that fades gradually. Looks tasty. Nose is sweet bananas, cloves, and wheat. A bit of spiciness comes through on warming, but mostly it's sweet bananas. Taste is more bananas, some grains, and spicy sweetness. Fits the style, a bit above average but not exceptional. Mouthfeel is good, it's tangy and foamy. Maybe a bit thin. Drinkability is great, this is a good agreeable summer beer.","shivtim","Aug 03, 2006"

Nose has a sweet caramel aroma with a nice bit of wheat, fresh and pleasant to the senses, start is lightly sweet with a good grain presence, and the top is light to middling in feel. Finish is benignly hopped and the acidity purposeful, very dry aftertaste, a pleasant enough beer, and one that goes well with the rapidly approaching Arizona summer.","Gusler","Dec 29, 2004"

4.47,21.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It pours a cloudy, tawny brown body with a full head of creamy off-white foam that holds exceptionally well but leaves only minor lacing considering the style. Light brown sugar and soft red berries dominate the aroma with only subtle hints of banana and a gentle clove-like spice appear in the nose. The body is medium and it appears initially crisp and then creamy across the palate due to its very fine and effervescent natural carbonation. The flavor delivers a beautiful combination of soft maltiness and gentle fruitiness (berries, apples, bananas). It's very well-balanced by a soft bitterness, and it finishes dry with a short note of fruity yeast. Quite nice! It's weizen yeast character is somewhat restrained, offering a bit more drinkability. Certainly on-par with the better known brands and well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Sep 13, 2003"

3.6,-2.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pouring a funky sewage brown, it has an off white head that disappears quickly. The usual banana and clove smells are in there but in lesser amounts than others of the style. The same holds true for the taste. It's not unpleasant, but it's a bit on the light side in the taste and also in the mouthfeel. Despite these drawbacks it-like most other weissbiers-goes down easy.","mickeymac","Beers"
