The lacing on this was great. Very impressive pour. A very yeasty taste with a great mix of malts. This had an even better aftertaste. I can't say I have had many beers of this type, but this may keep me coming back for more. Very good","BradMacMullin","Dec 07, 2013"

3.5,-1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a respectable Dunkelweizen, not brilliant, but respectable. It pours a slightly bright amber color, which isn't characteristic for the style as this should be a touch more dirty water, cloudy, brown. The beer is plenty carbonated, with not much head or retention, no lace at all. The beer is a bit more full bodied than you typically find in the style, with just enough of a coarse mouthfeel to let you know that this is a wheat beer. There is a bit more caramel in the taste than I expected, more sweet malts too, some cloying malty notes, definitely crystal malts at play here. The is a touch of floral texture to the beer, with a slightly syrupy consistency, a slightly musty finish, but still relatively sweet throughout. This is a decent, not brilliant.","albern","Mar 18, 2011"

4.18,17.4,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: My new favorite from the brewery. This is a nice bready brew that hides the alcohol well. I could see myself spending a night with a couple of these.","tigg924","Feb 14, 2011"
3.98,11.8,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Light body with an smooth feel from start to finish. Only a minimal amount of lingering bitterness. Very drinkable. A growler went down in a night.","DrinkingDrake","Jan 25, 2011"
3.87,8.7,3,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"First sip reveals an average to light body with mild carbonation that gently rolls across my palate. Flavor is as the nose advertises, with sweet malt dominating the beer. I get some caramel and then a bit of fruit and some wheat twangyness mixed together. No hops and no booze to be detected. The beer is a nice easy drinker and is pretty sweet. While not the most outstanding dunkel Ive had, it is a solid representative and is worth the $4 I paid for a bomber.","sulldaddy","Jan 22, 2011"
3.46,-2.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Nice slow beer but can see the taste becoming blah after a 22oz bottle. Would definitely get again as a treat.","bierschmecktgut","Jan 22, 2011"
4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a very drinkable beer that has characteristics of a hefeweizen, but at a more mellow level. It's more bready with a nice balance of spice and sweet malt.","WanderingFool","Dec 31, 2010"
4.08,14.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The feel of this beer is medium bodied, there seems to be a big more then there ends up being in the end. This goes down well and leaves that fudge like flavor of an aftertaste that is welcoming.","Duhast500","Nov 17, 2010"
3.88,9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Picked up a growler to try the new seasonal release from BHB. Poured into stemmed beer glasses. Dark caramel color to the body, with a nice white head. Smell had a burnt sugar and spice smell to it. Lots of malt in the flavor. Just a hint also of chocolate and ripe fruit. Mouthfeel was very nice, as it had a proper body to it and at the same time was smooth to drink. Drinkability was high, as the abv was very well hidden, and the overall taste was appealing. A great new addition to the Blue Hills portfolio that I will definitely be having again.","morebeergood","Oct 22, 2010"
