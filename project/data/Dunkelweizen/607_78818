4.08,14.9,3.75,4.5,4.25,2.75,4,"O - This is a nice beer. If it wasn't so ""bubbly"" I'd dare say its one of the best domestic dunkels out there. I've had the maibock from Ramstein as well and I would try this and other offerings if I get the chance.","socon67","Feb 05, 2013"
3.45,-2.8,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"O: Overall it's tasty and doesn't have any distinct flaws, yet it lacks typicity and a sense of direction","ONUMello","Nov 25, 2012"
3.94,11,4,3.75,4,4,4,"On the palate I get more bananas, dark malts, some light smokyness, and drying hops. Long and tasty finish. Flavorful, quality creation from Ramstein. They put out high quality brews and this one is no different. Worth seeking out and enjoying.","Billolick","Nov 14, 2012"
3.92,10.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This is my third Dunkel of the evening and it is the best. I have had a good experience in the past with Highpoint on tap. The look and smell is point on for the style and and it is comparable to many of the best in class. A good brewer of Germanic styles, Highpoint is a respectable entrant.","slammo","Jul 31, 2012"
2.69,-24.2,2,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"This isnt a bad beer necessarily but its a bad dunkelweizen. Label this a schwartzbier or something and i mightve graded this higher. Needs less roasted malt and more wheat. Good yeast strain though.","tzieser","Jul 09, 2012"

The other High Point beers keep this beer's profile and offer more but this isn't a disappointment by any stretch. A bit more caramel stickness and dark spice could have made this great but this stands just fine as is.","JerzDevl2000","0"
