"Overall:  not bad, but the lack of a really good texture hurts this beer for me."

"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, dark fruit, and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a better smell than flavor in my opinion."
"this beer leaves a little to be desired. looks and smells wonderful but when you taste it kinda falls flat. not that its not any good just wish the flavor profile matched the look/smell"

"O: Definitely a wildly uneven beer. Had some good qualities, but somehow fell short."

"O: The early promise of the nose was a letdown in the taste, but this is still a solid beer. The price is a problem, it's pretty much the most expensive dunkelweisse on the shelf, and it's not the best so it's hard to make it a repeat buy even though I like the beer."

"This was liquid apple pie. Brown pour. Nice head. About 4 finger in hef glass. Nose of apples and hef yeast. Palate and feel is quite nice. Apples and crisp end both dry from hopping and mineral with a toasty malt note. Although once the carbonation goes its a very plain drink. First half was better than the second. And thats saying a long seeing a good hef is for the thirsty."
"nice medium brown pour with a slight reddish touch to the sides yielded a nice head of off white that stuck to the sides of the glass fairly well as it trickled down. aroma is nice and earthy with touches of roasted nuts and caramel coming through as it warms. nice deep flavor, nothing over the top but nice and consistent for the style, about what i would expect from them. deep sweet malts are driven home in the finish with a long taste of caramel that really just drives it home."
"Overall, not a bad beer, not a great beer. There are many much better options for a Dunkel. But I don't think you'd go wrong giving it a try."
"This is one of those beers that look and smell great, but when you actually try to drink it, it leaves a bit to be desired. It pours a beautiful golden brown color, has an excellent malty aroma as well. But when you drink it, the taste is bitter and it is very chunky beer. I was a bit disappointed in this one, but hey, it could of been alot worse!"
"This is a very D - drinkable beer, and a grat option for weiss drinker that want the malt, solid beer."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly; it is quite sessionable."
"This was my first Hopf, I will try others!"
"Medium-bodied and kind of creamy. It's a tasty and drinkable dunkel. Came recommended from Tiffany's."
"Overall this is a solid brew, I don't see it around much but it is pretty good."
"This beer was recommended to me at Bierkraft in Brooklyn and I must say it does not disappoint. Overall this is an excellent beer and I recommend it to anyone who likes hefeweizens."
"Bought this to compare it to the Franziskaner Dunkelweisse. It was served from a bottle into a pint glass. It poured a cloudy, opaque, brown/caramel color w/ an offwhite head. The smell was wheaty and even sour. The taste was clean and a little sour. The taste wasn't very impressive or complex. I would have almost said insipid, but after letting it warm a little, it gave more flavor. It had good drinkability because it was refreshing and not heavy."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. Not as nice as some other dunkelweizens, but decent."
"notes- solid beer"
"Rather decent Dunkleweisse, but nothing special. pours ark brown with offwhite head. Nose is fairly active with some traditional banana/clove of the regular Hefe, but also some fresh baked brownbread maltiness. Palate is somewhat thin bodied, but the fruity flavors come through as well. Nothing spectacular but not worth passing up either."
"Pours a hazy brown color with a thick billowing head. Really good lacing. Aroma is basically predominantly bananna with some roasted malt. The body is medium. Good carbonation. The flavor is a combination of soft chocolate malt with wheat beer fruitiness. It's very well balanced. A good dark wheat beer."
"Pours opaque brown with a thick, foamy, rocky off-white head. Metallic wheat aroma, with only a small amount of clove and bubblegum. Sour wheat taste at first, but after 2-3 pulls, it gets a nice cereal taste with a good amount of banana. I've had better, but this is not that bad."
"D - A nice brew. Malty and pleasant, very true to style. If I crave a dunkel, I will likely have this again."
"D- Very drinkable, nice balanced wheat would defiantly buy this one again. There might be some better Dunkles out there but this is one not to pass up."
"I actually poured the rest of the bottle out, not because it was bad, but because I have other, better things to drink than this."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Pours out a deep caramel color, settling in the glass as murky brown. In the aroma, there are notes of apple cider and spice. Caramel and raisins appear as it warms. Unfortunately they don't really meld together. As for the taste, it's a smooth taste, one which tends to be more apple dominant. Bitterness is very low, with the spice providing the balance to the apple. Light feel of alcohol is felt when the beer lands in the stomach. Overall, it does the job."
"Anyway, good beer."
"would match with foods well but....soooo many better beers out there...why drink this?"
"Zum wohl!!!"
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to drink, but the aftertaste kinda weirds me out. I would be happy to have it on tap, but it's too average to get another bottle of when there are so many other brews to try."
"Drinkability- Like I said earlier, a tad astringent, but not bad overall."
"D- This beer is very smooth with some good dark flavors with no notes of hops but the big fizz cleans up the finish."
"D - Quite drinkable, but the fruitiness could wear on me after more than one."
"Hazy deep brown/black, with a 1"" off-white foamy head that fades gradually. Looks tasty. Nose is sweet bananas, cloves, and wheat. A bit of spiciness comes through on warming, but mostly it's sweet bananas. Taste is more bananas, some grains, and spicy sweetness. Fits the style, a bit above average but not exceptional. Mouthfeel is good, it's tangy and foamy. Maybe a bit thin. Drinkability is great, this is a good agreeable summer beer."
"Hopf Dunkle Weisse is a good effort and is one of the better, more drinkable versions of the style that I've had in quite a while. It's hefe weizen brother is no slouch either. Both are easy recommendations."
"Drinkability  I had no problem emptying my Weihenstephaner glass."
"Would not buy this beer again, even if it does look beautiful in its glass."
"A good choice for an easy to drink beer, but if you've got the chance to grab another Dunkel like Franziskaner or Erdinger, it's probably worth the extra few cents."
"Drinkability: Dud of a style, by and large and this is no exception.It looks a lot better than it tastes. More than adequate, less than spectacular."
"eh, just okay."
"A different taste from a different region in Germany, a good session dunkelwiezen."
"The beer pours from the 500ml brown bottle a cloudless burnished copper color with a humongous creamy head the is light tan in color, as it ever so slowly fades away the residual lace forms a fine blanket to coat the glass. Nose has a sweet caramel aroma with a nice bit of wheat, fresh and pleasant to the senses, start is lightly sweet with a good grain presence, and the top is light to middling in feel. Finish is benignly hopped and the acidity purposeful, very dry aftertaste, a pleasant enough beer, and one that goes well with the rapidly approaching Arizona summer."
"Drinkability: Good but not great. For such a dark colored beer the flavor is very light."
"Another solid beer from Hopf. Flavors are quite similar to the Helle, just with an added touch of toastiness. Easy drinking on all corners, a solid session beer."
"This is a nice find and one I will be going back to. Purchased at Sams in Downers Grove for $1.79. What a bargain!"
"Drinkability is average. Nothing bad to note here but absolutely nothing that stands out."
"Overall, very drinkable. Not the best example of the style but above average."
"Overall: Cost $2.59 for the bottle, as indeed did all three of the Hopfs I picked up recently. A tasty brew, better than most."
"Brown with orange hues, good creamy head with ample retention. Aromas of cooked caramel, sweet malt and banana as well as some barnyarn/gamey notes. Somewhat fat in the mouth while soft in texture with mild carbonation. Flavors are a bit gamey and very nutty with some husky and caramal malt flavors. The beer finishes mildly watery."
"Very drinkable, just it isn't the top beer of its kind."
"It pours a cloudy, tawny brown body with a full head of creamy off-white foam that holds exceptionally well but leaves only minor lacing considering the style. Light brown sugar and soft red berries dominate the aroma with only subtle hints of banana and a gentle clove-like spice appear in the nose. The body is medium and it appears initially crisp and then creamy across the palate due to its very fine and effervescent natural carbonation. The flavor delivers a beautiful combination of soft maltiness and gentle fruitiness (berries, apples, bananas). It's very well-balanced by a soft bitterness, and it finishes dry with a short note of fruity yeast. Quite nice! It's weizen yeast character is somewhat restrained, offering a bit more drinkability. Certainly on-par with the better known brands and well worth trying."
"When poured, it was amber in color with some foam and a little lace. The smel was fruity, with a hint of some spice. The taste was dyr in the palate, fruity and had some spice. Not overly found of this Dunkle Weisse. Sort of a flat taste on the finish."
"Overall, I was impressed with the attractiveness and smell of this beer. However, I thought it to be coming up short on taste and feel."
"Pouring a funky sewage brown, it has an off white head that disappears quickly. The usual banana and clove smells are in there but in lesser amounts than others of the style. The same holds true for the taste. It's not unpleasant, but it's a bit on the light side in the taste and also in the mouthfeel. Despite these drawbacks it-like most other weissbiers-goes down easy."
