Really, a 'dunkel', from Bamberg tutoring, no less, welded onto a traditional English ale (so here in Canada, Trad from Big Rock, then?).  Fails abound, no lie, the German association is not even particularly wheaty, let alone a smoke-filled miasma, as I might have been coerced into being led into believing.  Not a bad brew overall, just nothing like what the marketing arm sai- oh, right.","biboergosum","Aug 17, 2014"

2.31,-28,3.75,2,2,3,2.5,"Pours a crystal clear dark brown with ruby at the edges and a wispy off white head that dissipates quickly. Butter caramel and toffee dominate the aroma, with traces of dish soap. I find no weizen or hops in the aroma of this brew. The flavor isn't much better than the aroma. Buttery burnt caramel with a soapy edge. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. I'm not sure what they were shooting for here, but its safe to say they missed.","johnnnniee","May 17, 2014"
2.09,-34.9,3.5,2,2,2,2,"I must admit I've never had a dunkel (not available near me). I have had many english ales, and brew mostly english style ales. To me, this is just too damn sour.","BeerLaw","Apr 30, 2014"

3.5,9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Contrary to Picaroons' intentions, Dark and Stormy Night does not ""provide all the rich flavours of a stout or porter with the easy drinkability of a wheat beer""; it lacks the quantity of the former and the quality of the latter. It has only a mild, trifling amount of roast and nowhere near the spice, fruit, or effervescence of a dunkelweizen. Nice beer, but not what's advertised.","biegaman","Dec 10, 2013"

3.86,20.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The taste is drier than the smell indicates, although the swallow brings out some of the sweetness. Again, there is little wheat flavor. The body is somewhat chewy but the carbonation is appropriately high. There is a good dose of toasted malt (crystal?) that provides a biscuity flavor. This is smooth and easily drinkable, but don't expect a typical dunkelweizen.","smcolw","Aug 26, 2012"

2.5,-22.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Overall: This one is a delicious malt bomb and one of the better beers I had on my trip to Canada. I love the chocolate and caramel combo—yet this one is not cloying somehow. Could drink this all night. It falls in line with other sweeter beers like those from Southern Tier. I graded this though to the style of dunkleweizen, though....and this I believe does behave like a dunkleweizen at all. There is no murkiness or wheat balance--maybe this is just a strange hybrid brew. Call this a porter and I give it 4s.","tigg924","Mar 15, 2011"
1.77,-44.9,2,2.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"OVERALL: Well, you win some and lose some I guess. That’s the fun of trying new things. The brewery called this a cross between dunkelweiss and an Engligh brown ale, but it’s basically just an identity crisis in a bottle. It’s dark with lots of wheat, a bit of bitterness from the hops, and then some tartness from the land of ooops. Combine that with an annoyingly noisy head and an over-carbonated body, and you’ve got a recipe that will make drain a happy camper. Not my thing. Thanks again for the trade cjbmcdon.","Jeffo","Jan 11, 2011"
3.55,10.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Poured a deep deep, golden-amber. Big egg shell colored was fluffy but leveled out rather quickly. Big malty nose, sweet like candy, is strong. Hard for other scents to find their way through. The taste is a little funky. Bland to start and then the roasted malts, coffee beans, hit. An overload of carbonation is also noted. Other than excess carb. there is a creaminess to the beer. Somewhat acidic. A pretty good beer here and the low alcohol and decent pricing make a good buy. Nice to mix it up every once in a while.","spree92","Sep 11, 2010"
3,-6.5,3,3,3,3,3,"D: I don't think this beer knows what it wants to be. Listed here as a Dunkel, but the brewery lists it as a hybrid of a Dunkel and English Brown. I commend trying new things, but this combo doesn't particularly work.","berley31","Jun 13, 2010"
2.85,-11.2,3,3,2.5,3.5,3,"It is somewhat drinkable and the finish is decent. Just not a beer I'd make an effort for.","socon67","Feb 07, 2010"
2.3,-28.3,3,3,2,2,2,"In short, the bottle I had contained something out of style and with some problems. If Picaroons can figure out the diacetyl issue, this could get better. Right now, however, it is a mess.","Seanstoppable","Oct 18, 2009"

3.06,-4.7,4,3,3,3,3,"D: Not hard to drink, but the dark fruits and hops seem to be unbalanced. Also this is not a great representation of a dunkel.","Long813","Jul 23, 2009"

2.77,-13.7,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Bottle: Poured a dark black color beer with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with great notes of candi sugar with some medicinal notes. Taste is surprisingly bland with some very light sweet notes and a light cough syrup finish. Body is kind of thin with good carbonation. This was a very weird experience and doesn't really resemble a dunkleweizen.","Phyl21ca","Jul 15, 2008"

3.56,10.9,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Note: I was going to add this one tonight, though it seems as though someone beat me to the punch. I was going to add it as an English Brown Ale as it tastes more like that than a Dunkelweizen (not much yeastiness and breadiness present). The label calls it a mix between a German dunkel and an English Ale (brown ale is the closest I could come up with).","RunawayJim","Beers"
2.27,-29.3,4,2,2,2.5,2.5,"500 ml bottle- Deep chestnut brown pour is topped with a frothy, mocha cap, leaving nice lace. The aromas are grainy and sour, and filled with diacetyl. There is a dark fruit component trying to come through, but it only makes a brief appearance, as the off aromas constantly take over. Tastes sweet upfront, of figs and grains, some bready yeast as well. Then comes the unfortunate sour and buttery disaster. It completely takes over everything else. The finish is grainy and sour, with a boatload of buttered popcorn in the aftertaste. I've never had a butterbomb dunkelweizen before. I really wanted to like this beer, but unfortunately, I just couldn't.","mrmanning","0"
