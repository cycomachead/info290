3.33,-4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This was a little bit surprising to me. I liked the fact the Michelob tried appealing to the craft beer nuts out there with their attempts of putting these types of beers out. The Dunkelweizen is probably the best of the series. Its got a muddy brown color with a pretty nice size head in it. The aromas of wheat and clove billow from the foam. The taste is a little light but it still has enough to stand out. It's also got some earth and dark fruity flavors in there too.","Knapp85","Jan 10, 2011"
3.74,7.8,3,4,4,3,3.5,"Oh the Michelob Dunkel, probably their best offering. This beer pours a pretty thick dark hazelnut brown with a light cream colored head which laced the glass. The aromas are not too shabby for the style. It's a ton of banana bread and spice. The yeast is out of this world. The taste too, for the style, pretty solid. It's a lot of banana bread, super yeasty, with good spice. This beer drinks very, very thick. It's too thick. After two of these I feel like I ate two loaves of banana bread. It's a little over the top. For the style though, this isn't too shabby.","aasher","Jan 03, 2011"

1.18,-66,4,1,1,1,1,"Had a bottle of this with a buddy of mine last night. Great pour and appearance but everything else was terrible. This must have been a bad batch because the yeast was stuck to the side in a big clump and was as black as night. Every single bottle was this way. Horrible taste and smell. I'll need to try another in the future that isn't tainted.","jfrank85","Nov 25, 2010"
4.23,21.9,3.5,3,5,4,4.5,"When pouring this beer it pours out a nice dark color that has a decent head with some lacing and decent retention. The smell is of a banana and cloves. When drinking this beer I taste some bananas and cloves with a hint of chocolate and some wheat. This beer has a nice smooth medium mouthfeel and is very drinkable. I would highly recommend this beer for anyone that loves a good beer.","DannyDan","Nov 24, 2010"

3.72,7.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Could easily throw a few of these back, if it weren't for the fact that something just seems off about this beer. Overall, its not bad, its just not well balanced.","king75","Beers"
3.48,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,2,4,"Pours slightly hazy amber-brown color with off-white head. Nose is light, but has some banana and brown bread notes. On the palate it comes across as very light bodied, almost watery, but nonetheless has a resemblance of the traditional dunkelweizen flavors. Also more wheaty sweetness is noted. Finishes thin and a bit watered down without a lot of flavors. Thanks to Herb for the bottle.","yemenmocha","0"

3.37,-2.9,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a ruby/amber color with a fizzy head that quickly dies down to nothing, leaving a stagnent looking beer, save the bubbles rising to the top of the glass. The nose is not overwhelming but is a nice mixture of a nice malty base topped with fruity and spicy phenols; I get more banana than clove. The taste is pretty similar with the malt being able to ascert it's sweet presence more than in the nose. Banana is still present but the clove flavor seems to be more dominant; there also seems to be a very slight astringency on the finish. The mouthfeel seems a bit on the light side for a dunkel and the carbonation could stand to be more viscous. Overall, not a bad beer, not overly good either. This could be a good intro beer into the craft world for BMC drinkers.","gmfessen","Mar 14, 2010"
3.18,-8.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"quite drinkable. nothing bad at all. i mean this has a real FLAVOR. kudos to a conglomerate that achieves that. but i will stick with the ole Pale as the only A-B brew i'll touch (that is, buy).","mempath","Mar 12, 2010"

3.6,3.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Very enjoyable beer. Came in variety 12-pack of wheat beers, had never had one until I bought that. Very tasty, and the smell makes you want to drink it even more, including a nice hint of chocolate. Only thing I didn't really like would probably be the aftertaste that sticks around for a little while. Otherwise, excellent dark wheat ale.","wolfpack87","Feb 15, 2010"
3.98,14.7,2.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Taste is pretty good as well, a bit thin and lacking a bit in the creaminess department, but this is a fine stab at the dunkelweiss style. Chocolate and wheat tang are accentuated nicely by medium amounts of banana and clove, probably leans a bit more clove-ish. Most likely the best In-Bev beer made. Most certainly worth a shot for any wheat beer fan out there. If it were not for the poor appearance, this would achieve a much higher score.","twiggamortis420","Feb 14, 2010"

No. But it is worth a try, especially for someone who hasn't had this style.","JerseyPaul","Dec 14, 2009"

1.53,-55.9,2,1.5,1.5,2.5,1,"Not a very good looking beer. Grayish brown, chocolate milk color. Big chunky sediment. Not apealing. Big head that goes away quickly. Yeasty overripe bannanas with some kind of baking spice. Not for me. I don't know much about this kind of beer, but I think it might be a case of not liking the style. I'm not a fan of the Heffewiezens with the bannana and clove. This has that but with stronger flavor. So it should stand to reason that I don't like it. It needed some malty sweetness or hoppy bitterness to balance the flavors. It's just kind of bland with that spicey mushy bannana aftertaste. I could't finish the bottle. If you like Dunkelweizens, this is probably a good one. Evidently I don't.","lester619","Oct 21, 2009"
3.8,9.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Reddish amber color. Smells of banana, clove, and bready sweetness along with dried fruits. Lots of banana flavor. There is also quite a bit of bready malts. I didn't really notice any caramel. It is nice, though, to have a beer from AB that exhibits different taste characteristics for different taste buds. This isn't just a good beer for AB, it's a plain good beer regardless of manufacturer. Carbonation gave a pleasant feel. I'd not have a problem drinking these in multiples.","alkemy","Oct 12, 2009"

The nose is toasted grain with the requisite banana/clove aroma typical of the style. I must admit this is an above average example of the style. Toasted pumpernickel and wheat malt with soft banana and savory spice notes. The body seems a little light with ample carbonation that adds to the drinkability. Hey, good beer is good beer even if it is brewed by the dark side.","biggred1","Sep 25, 2009"
3.95,13.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a very hazy reddish brown with a soft tan head. Has all of the usual good dunkelweizen aromas: a yeasty breadiness, bananas and cloves; smells are not as potent as some in this style, but are pleasant. Taste is right on the money. Has a nice toastiness and pleasant sweetness with light spices. Its body could bit heftier but overall this a good beer. Its also an excellent value.","droomyster","Sep 22, 2009"
3.55,2.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Thanks to brothercannon for tossing this my way. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker glass. Appears a cloudy dark brown color with about a finger of light tan head.

I could definitely have a few in a row.","smallbatchbrewer","Sep 20, 2009"

4.02,15.9,4,4.5,4,3,4,"The aroma is great. I am surprised. Very nice estery banana aroma. The aroma is reminiscent of banana bread with not much in the way of the clove phenol that I personally don't like about Weisse beers. You can break the banana bread aroma down into some banana, vanilla, and some mostly bready and sweet malt character. Very nice job there for a macro brewed beer. It pours a nice brownish red and had a decent head on it. It is cloudy as a weisse beer should be. This is from the yeast, and there is quite bit of yeast in this bottle yet even though I swirled it up mid pour. In the flavor I do get some clove but it's low, and the banana flavor is also what I think of when I smell an over ripe banana. Sort of what reminds me of what I think the peel would taste like. There is some mild vanilla flavor which just adds to the beers overall appeal. The malty goodness of the dunkel weisse style is not lacking here. There is some crisp chocolate toast and sweet caramel, as well as that typical wheaty grainy flavor. There are some flavors from the yeast that I like as well. Although the flavors are very noticeable, they are not overpowering and the overall balance between the malts, esters, phenols is done very well.The mouthfeel is a bit chewy and quite nice for this style, but maybe just a bit too much. For the Dunkel Weisse style the mouthfeel should be medium-light and I think this one is just a bit over that.Overall, I really like this beer. It showcases the banana esters and even the clove phenols (even though those are on the lower side) real nice as well as play well with the malts used. The mouthfeel is a bit much, but that is minor issue. The fact that there is yeast in the bottle was a big plus that I was not expecting with Michelob. The flavors and aromas were not only true to style but also done fairly well. I may be scoring this a bit high simply because I had much lower expectations that were just shattered.","barleypopmaker","Jul 25, 2009"

The bottle design & label is a nice touch that seems to indicate some care for the product. The beer came in a mix-pack that some friends had grabbed & quickly referred to the dunkel as the ""bacon chips beer"" and wondered if I wanted one. Well, such a description I thought was not too savory, but then again, their tastes are a bit more 'restricted' shall we say. The pour was a decent light brown with golden-orange edging that left a finger plus tannish head & a bit of lace. It was a bit of a pleasant surprise to see some yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle & to see it haze up the appearance as well. The aroma was not as smoky as it was made out to be, rather, it had a nice roasted cracker malt aroma with some lemon-yeast. The flavor was likewise, but with a nice banana, pepper & sweet malt qualities as well. The body was lighter than many dunkels, but still had some creaminess to its crispness, which was unexpected. By no means a great dunkel, but a nice & worthwhile beer. Cheers, Michelob!","selecter70","May 24, 2009"

The flavor is much the same but unfortunately the banana comes off more as a Laffy Taffy banana then a fresh banana. It makes it just a tad to sweet.

Aromas are faint and may have a touch of graininess, but fares similarly to most other craft beer attempts of the sytle. The beer has a pronounced clove character throughout and I'm not entirely convinced it is derived completely from the yeast- maybe something was added to intensify this flavor, yet give little else in terms of yeastiness or breadiness.

3.79,9.2,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I wasn't expecting much from this beer as every other Michelob product I've ever had has seemed to be a watered-down version of the style their meant to represent, But I'm glad to say that this is a very fine brew and it appears that Michelob is finally stepping up their game.","BierFan","0"
4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"I poured this 'dark wheat ale' into my mug and found it to be a dark, murky copper color with a khaki head. The head formed a thick cap and retained very well. The aroma was earthy and robust, 'wet' wheat and hints of spice. The flavors were smoky, roasted and toasted malt, hints of cloves and a pleasant but subtle sweetness. Quite smooth and well balanced with a mild carbonation and medium body. Though the wheat character is a bit subdued I have to give this one credit. Michelob name aside, this is a very good Dunkelweizen and well worth picking up. Against all odds, A-B has produced a true-to-style, American version of a German beer competitive with craft brewers around the nation.","thekevlarkid","Sep 27, 2008"
3.71,6.9,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Notes: Not bad at all. Worth the try and decent. If this beer was a woman I would say yes to another night out. I would still come home though.","Lexluthor33","Sep 26, 2008"
4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The first of the Michelob specalty beers that I've had that wasn't a twist off. I went three rotations before I got the opener. It pours out a nice hazy amber dark bronze with a foamy tan head. No seeing through this one. It has that banana and clove sweet aroma typical of the style. Flavor reflects the smell perfectly but also the faint flavor of prune or plum can be picked up on. This is the best beer Michelob makes, I believe. Creamy and a pleasure to drink. Good stuff for a great price. I'll definitely be getting more.","berserker256","Sep 25, 2008"
4.12,18.7,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability is decent here. It takes a step of offering more flavor than their other offerings I've had. Not as dark as it could be but a very solid brew otherwise. I haven't had many dunkelweizens but I would buy this one again in a 6 pack if I had a choice.","Brad007","Sep 23, 2008"
3.41,-1.7,2.5,4,3,4,3.5,"I'm glad it was free. The first time I had this I really liked it and was impressed. However, that was on an already fatigued palate. Actually dissecting the flavor now, I'm a bit disappointed. Still, it's one of the best beers I've had from our friends at AB.","khiasmus","Sep 22, 2008"

3.53,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: I normally take wiesse biers in ones or twos. The flavors end up being cloying after too many. Michelob (A-B) really surprised me with this one as it overacheived my expectations. Kudos to them and bring some more craft style beers to the marketplace.","usmittymc","Sep 19, 2008"
3.88,11.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This poured a cloudy reddish/brown color with fluffy beige head that it retained for a while. Aroma was banana, clove, and spice. Flavor is pretty much the same. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Good mouthfeel and the drinkability is quite high. This was a nice effort from A-B.","biggmike","Sep 18, 2008"
4.14,19.3,3,4,4.5,4,4,"Really, this is a good beer; and while not perfect, a pretty damn good example of the style! Hats off to AB... I never thought I'd say that.","adams82","Sep 17, 2008"

3.65,5.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Cloudy rust colored ale with an initially large foam that slowly fades and leaves a thin layer that lasts well. Telltale Bavarian aromas, with hints of banana, clove, vanilla, and other fruits, maybe even some graham and cookie. Well balanced and well made, it even finishes really well. Authentic german dark wheat and a great effort from AB. It's not a complex ale, nor or the flavors as vibrant as I'd like, but it still a well brewed, high quality ale.","Crosling","Aug 12, 2008"
3.6,3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"One of the best if not the best of A-B's efforts. Classic weisse aroma with the standard spicy fruitiness found in the Bavarian unfiltered wheat beers. Poured with a good long lasting head and plenty of lace. Nice dark hazy amber color. Flavor is same as aroma but with more malty. Definitely fresh! Very drinkable. One thing is its lack of depth. Very short finish. But pleasant.","drpimento","Aug 09, 2008"
3.32,-4.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"One could drink a bunch of these and not feel all full as with good dark wheats.","peabody","Jul 26, 2008"
3.42,-1.4,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured a cloudy meduim red-brown color with a voluminous pale sand-colored head of foam. Complex patterns of lacing inside the tall weisse glass as the head subsided. The note is full of fruity and spicy esthers - what you'd expect for the style with cloves, banana, and sweet malts dominating the nose. This beer smells ... dare I say ... like a German dark weisse bier, not an A-B clone of one. The palate fails to impress as much, but isn't bad. You get the sweetness from the dark malt right away with some phenolic characteristics coming through subtlely. A good flavor profile, but somehow a little disjointed. I don't get the wheat malt as strongly as I'd like here. The mouth feel is quite thin, save for the presence of quite a bit of residual yeast in the bottle. This helps, of course, but the beer still comes across just a little thinner than I'd like. Good carbonation and the finish is dry with a slight spiciness lingering in the mouth. All in all, a nice attempt at the style, but nothing groundbreaking here except for the fact that this beer is brewed my Anheuser-Busch. Could use a touch more wheat in the grain bill, perhaps, along with a slightly fuller mouth feel. Otherwise, not too shabby at all. The R&D department at A-B is doing some good stuff ... let's see if the die-hard craft beer world can accept these faux-crafts as legit.","beerphilosopher","Jul 23, 2008"
