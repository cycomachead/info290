"Light to medium bodied. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Highly (not overly) carbonated with a lasting dry finish."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head. Aromas of clove and some light grain. Taste is a hint of coffee up front followed by some grain, finishing with a bit of spicyness. Mouthfeel is average. Overall a pretty good beer. Its light and refreshing though I would have preferred more yeast flavor."

"O: I'm a big fan of dunkelweiss and I like Sam Adams but this one doesn't quite come together like I had hope it would; not a bad beer, just not one of SA's best or one of the better options out there for the style"
""
""
"This beer pours up a deep fairly clear gold with a big three finger head which stays around for awile and leaves a little bit of lacing behind. The smell is mainly yeast and banana. The taste is mainly yeast as well. There is also a metallic taste. Not much bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is nothing special. Just average. I'd say this beer is very average. Just not a treat to drink at all. I'll pass on more."
""
""
""
""
"O - It's not bad if you enjoy the clove and banana character of the Bavarian yeast. Not really my thing, but it is what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is actually a really terrific beer and a great example of the style. If it had a little more haze and a little more body, this would be at least a 4.5 all around. I am very impressed by Sam Adams on this one."
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this beer, but it wasn't memorable."
""
""
""
"O- The yeast is front and center, dominating everything, after that the beer turns to water, most likely from the wheat dulling any malts or hops. Meh..."
"not too bad of a dunkel, however this is definatly not one of my favorite styles. but they seemed to have nailed all the basics."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The wheat really outshines all the other elements in this beer. Very mellow and easy drinking, however it is lacking flavor. Average at best."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells like cloves and apricot and a couple days until ripe banana. Tastes like cloves with a sour wheat tang in back. Mildly sweet and nutty. Bottle claims tropical fruit but that's a bit of a reach. Mouthfeel is fair but lacks any standout wheat beer creamy, smooth wheat beeryness."
"Taste is eclectic hints of honey,clove, fruit cake perhaps. Not overbearing though. Not at all bitter, very crisp. I'll have another!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Not sure how I feel about this one, I guess it isn't bad, but not preference at all. I will drink what I have, but will not go out of my way to have this one again."
""
""
"O- Disappointed. I like dunkelweizen's, but this one is just totally off kilter on the taste. Not horrible, but misses the mark a bit."
"O: it would have been OK if BBC hadn't completely missed the boat on taste, maybe I got a bad bottle but this is approaching drain pour territory based solely on taste, the other good qualities cannot make up for that"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I found this a fun beer that made the fall sampler pack even better. While not the best in the pack (Hazel Brown is nice!), I'd be happy to try this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is of wheat, a slight sweetness with nice spiciness, roasted malt, cherry, banana with other fruits which I cannot identify. It seems pretty similar to the imported varieties to me . Drinkability is very good too. Overall this one is pretty good, and it is much better than I expected."
""
""
"O) A decent brew overall. I'd drink another one."
""
"O:  Complex and well blended. I haven't had too many dunkels but this IMO is pretty tasty. I picked up the harvest seasonal 12 pk and I think this is one of the better ones in the group. "
"O - This is a strong beer coming from America's rather poor inventory in this style. The German counterparts are indeed better, but this is not a failure."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into tumbler pint, the beer is a clear, hazelnut coloring with no lick of head whatsoever. Aromas of clove spicing, malty sweetness of caramel and toffee, and an overall roasting. Flavors are sweet, with a toffee and caramel backbone that is kept in check by the light, carbonated body. Roasty, warmly spiced characteristics. The aftertaste is sugary sweet, with some balance from spicing, but the sweetness wins out. Sharp, effervescent in mouth at the end, with a slight sweet linger."
""
""
"Served from bottle into a shaker. Poured brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, wheat, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, wheat, grain, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. While this was a decent example of the style, it really didn’t stand out from others I have had. There were some good things going on here with the bread and wheat, but also some things that it could have done without as in the earthiness. While it was nice to have something different going on, it can also hurt a brew unfortunately. Worth trying at least once to judge for yourself, but I doubt I will be having it again if I am completely honest as there are better easy to get ones out there."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good version of the Dunkelweizen style. Nice fruity esters and spicing. The smoke adds a interesting kick."
""
""
"Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen pours a copper color with a small head. The aroma is just what I feared it would be. Clove and banana, my two least favorite beer flavors coming in for the tag team. The taste is more restrained than the nose, with roasted barley and caramel malts working with the banana and slight clove flavor, along with some nutmeg. The mouthfeel is light and velvety, and the drinkability is decent. Not my favorite Sam, but it's probably a decent representation of a style that isn't really for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is the really GOOD...not perfect but considering how easy it is to get and the quality brew that it is, love it. Hope you enjoy as much as I did...Salud!"
""
""
""
"O- I like to see breweries take a shot at dunkels. This one is merely ok."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a muddy light brownish mixed with copper. The half finger of head dissipates quickly, but leaves some sticky lace on the glass. The nose is troublingly reminiscent of burnt hair. The flavor is certainly better than the taste as this offering has three distinct tastes that follow one another. First, there is a dry character present. Second, a touch of sweetness comes on in the middle. Finally, this offering has a tart finish that is not totally pleasing to the palate."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is a murky, copper color with a thick, eggshell colored foamy head. The aroma is dominated by clove and banana with some pineapple and toffee in the background. It tastes kind of metallic, other than that you get the fruity banana and clove spice with lots of wheat. It's medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall this beer is pretty average, I think they could have done better."
""
""
"Overall a unique, refreshing brew. Worth a try"
""
""
""
""
"O: Sam Adams is always my go to when I go to places with slim pickings on the beer menu and you cannot go wrong. They a great company that helped rekindle America's micro-brew Renaissance. Try one on!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I am a dunkelweizen fan, and you might call this one a little non-traditional but it's nice. Well balanced with interesting taste notes. It has character. A solid Sam offering."
""
"O-not a bad beer, there are better examples of the style but I would definitely drink this again"
""
"Overall – An easy drinking, tasty brew with a good balance between roast, malt, and sweet."
"Thin head on a hazy amber with slight golden hues body. Sweet aroma of caramel malts, spices and breads. Flavor is semi sweet with mostly caramel malts, hints of lemon, spices, a little mill chocolate. Light to medium body and high carbonation. The flavor in the end is mostly sweet, not very dynamic or memorable. Still drinkable usually."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Crisp and slightly dry."
""
""
""
"O- This beer is up my alley, and I'd be happy to have another. It's my first of the style, and I don't assume it's a perfect representation. I plan on having more similar brews."

""
""
"An okay beer, not a good dunkel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) A solid option in the 2012 fall variety pack. I think I would buy a six pack of this offering. Quite good... Glad to recommend..."
""
"O: not my favorite style, this one is a little too dark fruity and sweet for me. not bad to style though"
""
""
""
"O- One of the better Samuel Adams I've had. It loses points on the smell but it's very enjoyable otherwise."
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer, overall. Not the greatest or most complex, but tasty and drinkable."
""
""
"O- Impressive offering. A lot of flavors are mingled together, but it works well."
"O: One of the better options from sam, its nothing mind blowing but a well executed malt forward beer. Reccomended."
""
""
""
""
"O- I am not a huge fan of some weizens because of my distaste for cloves. However, with this beer's lack of overpowering clove flavor it makes for a great beer to welcome in the fall."
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm a sucker for both good dunkels and wheat beer, and this one is alright. Will drink again."
""
"This is my first ever dunkelweizen, and I have to say, it tastes super fruity with all the banana -- maybe that's not what this style's supposed to be about, but I really do enjoy it. This is the kind of beer your girlfriend or wife would enjoy... it really is that fruity tasting to me. While it is a lot of banana, it's not overpowering, and that's why I like it as much as I do. As usual, another solid beer made by Sam Adams. Actually, one of my favorites from them."
""
""
""
"Overall, a thin interpretation of the style to me, to sweet in flavor and scent - would like to see more yeast flavor presence and wheat notes."
""
"12oz bottle, pours a cloudy amber color with a foamy, cream colored head that holds good retention but doesn't leave much for lacing. Aromas are yeasty, caramely, banana, spice, clove, with a somewhat odd woody smell. Tastes are better however, with banana, yeast, clove, caramel, and a nice spiciness reminiscent of an Oktoberfest style beer. Mouth-feel is the star here - creamy and smooth, full bodied. Overall, this was better than I remember, and better than expected, but still falls short in comparison to others of this style."
""
""
"O/D-This Sam Adams variety is pretty solid. Another tasty keeper. Need to go out and try a few more Dunkels now."
""
""
"Overall: A better-than-average mass market wheat beer. I'm always impressed that Sam Adams makes such a wide variety of styles that are more or less faithful interpretations of the style. This one falls squarely in that category and is definitely something I'll be having again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Complex, delicious, and very drinkable—everything a good dunkel should be! Sam Adams did a nice job with this."
""
"Overall it is a decent beer- not bad for a mixed pack, but certainly not one to seek out. Was better looking and smelling than tasting."
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid beer, could use some more heft, but the wateriness could be by design. This style has always been one I am interested in picking up, albeit occasionally when I am looking for something different, not as a fridge foundation piece."
""
"Liked this beer, but couldn’t pull the trigger on higher ratings. I’d probably try it again though."
""
"This is basically just a plain dunkel that isn't to fancy but doesn't suck at the same time. I guess if you wanna try the harvest variety pack you'll do alright getting two of these but I would suggest if you want to drink more of this style look to the European versions, you'll be more satisfied."
"Not a bad beer, but not a real outstanding one either. I wish the flavors were just a bit more up front, but they are nice, and come forward a bit more when warmer. A nice beer for late summer."
""
""
""
""
""
"OK, NOT MUST HAVE!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Goes well with Pauline Oliveros electronic drone music."
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours hazy light brown with a large eggshell colored head. There aren't many visible tiny bubbles in the beer. The head retreats slowly. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. The aroma is prominently of banana with some clove. I can detect some of the malt. I can't detect the nutmeg that is mentioned on the bottle. The flavors are what you'd expect in the classic dunkelweizen. There is banana and clove from the yeast and the wheat and barley malts provide a nice bready backbone to this beer. The body is light to medium with low carbonation. The finish is crisp. The drinkabilty is high. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I won't avoid this in the future but I also won't go out of my way for it."
""
""
"A middle-of-the-road interpretation of the style and a tad watery for what I would like."
""
"O: Definitely drinkable, but not something I'd ever seek out by SA. Not really sure how this works into the fall seasonal pack, would like to see it removed and replaced with something else."
"O- I enjoy this beer and would certainly accept some of it. IDK if I'd purchase a 6er of it however"
"Overall: An enjoyable beer that is one of the best American representations of the style I have tried (only 2 or 3 to be fair). Not quite as full-bodied or carbonated as some I've had in Munich though."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy amber/honey color with a large fluffy white head which disappears quickly. Aroma, right off the bat is the expected banana and clove with mild citrus notes. Taste follows suit, strong banana and citrus flavor, mild clove. Slightly fruity and malty sweet. Has medium carbonation, not enough for a true weizen. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium light in body. This beer I feel is only called a dunkel because it's too dark for a hefe, and there is no amber category. I prefer my dunkels to be more black, and I was surprised when I first poured this beer at it's amber color. It's a good wheat beer, but not a great one."
"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color dunkel with a large foamy had with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of banana cake ester are pretty strong with light sweet notes and some what malt. Taste is a good mix between banana bread ester with light cloves and some light wheat malt notes also discernable. Body is a bit light for the style with good carbonation. Nice work on the yeast strain with huge ester but lacking body and malt profile is a bit weak for the style."
""
"O: an interesting style that I do not know much about just yet other than homebrews and failures to write down notes on other commercial brews, I`ll come to this personally to note changes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking wheaty brew, smooth mouth feel and interesting flavor characteristics. It's pretty good, not fantastic, but I will enjoy it and I would have it again."
""
"This beer is a rich amber, chestnut color with an off-white head. The aroma has a moderate wheat twang, with a mild undertone of malt. It's not a usually strong smelling dunkle...it could have more fruit and esters. The taste is clean, however, and the beer is semi-sweet. It's smooth and yeasty. Some bread and doughy grain. It's not as intense a sensation as I expected. Medium-full in mouthfeel. I've come to expect more from Sam Adams beers...this was average."
""
""
""
"a deep amber pour with a slight amount of off-white head and nice retention. smells of dates, grapes, nuts. a tart fruit/wheat flavor... not really my thing, has a bologna-like aftertaste. coriander, orange peel, all spice. light body nice carbonation is making this easier to gulp down and get over with. i'm sure for the style it's not bad.. but to me most dunkelweizens are very heavy on the weird bologna like aftertaste... not sure what it is in there that makes it this way, but i don't like it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I like what Samuel Adams is going for here. I've had other beers of this style that are just over-the-top spicy but this one seemed to dial in that flavor a bit for optimum drinkability and enjoyment. It's also one of the more full bodied beers I've had from them. I wouldn't seek this out again but if it happened to be part of a mix pack or shared among friends I would enjoy it all the same."
"Overall - If banana flavour in beer is your thing, this beer is for you. Unfortunately the banana tastes a little too artificial, bit it's still an above average brew. Worth a shot."
""
""
"Overall, Its great on a hot day. Doesen't seem like a fall beer to me but no complaints. Would definately have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"new to the fall mix this year is this tastz dark wheat brew. appearance is nice, brown and cloudy with a lively head. wafting aroma of wheat malt, clove, home made coffee cake, and banana. very well balanced, and much more happening on the palate than the average dunkel. the yeast is unique and is the star of the flavor experience. its got some vanilla and spice notes to it that really support the dark wheat malt. this is one i could easily drink a bunch of. feel is good, plenty of body but not at all filling, and proper carbonation to let the flavors evolve. overall this is an excellent beer and a nice addition to the fall pack. ill be grabbing these up quick when the box is in the fridge."
""
"Overall - Worth trying one time. I won't buy it again, but it was a decent brew. I just think it has the deck stacked against it with the quality of German dunkels that are on the market. Good effort though. Not a bad beer, just not really worth seeking out."
""
""
"Pours hazy dark brown red with a one finger white head. This beer has a lot of wheat in the nose and a slight fuityness. The taste is pretty tart and wheaty. There is a also a lot of berry flavors and some dark fruits. There is also some banana and clove. This beer has a somewhat of a bread flavor. Finish is tart, dry and kind of funky. A solid beer, not my favorite style but a decent wack at it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my first time having this beer that I can remember anyways. I enjoyed it a lot and is a good summer time beer, not sure about releasing it for your fall collection, but not complaining. This is something I will be drinking often this fall, cheers!"
""
""
"This is a decent beer that has a good flavor. The yeast adds a nice banana, peppery aroma and flavor. There is also a nice, balanced caramel sweetness throughout. Not bad."
""
"I should have stopped after the smell, and I had such high hopes for this. Instead of making a thousand average beers, I wish Sam Adams would focus on ten really exceptional beers. This is just above average and that's only because I liked the look and smell. It's not the easiest thing in the world to drink, and please, up the ABV."
""
""
"O- pretty good, was looking for a little more complexity in the malts, but has a great creamy mouthfeel."
"O: An average American take on a standard Bavarian classic. It's good out of the gate, but eventually falls slightly short of the mark. Certainly a good effort, though, and worth a shot"

"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours hazy amber with creamy, white, long lasting head and lovely carbonation. Aroma is of cloves, banana, wheat malt and yeast. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is sour first, followed by banana, spices and wheat malt. Finish is long, tart and refreshing. Not bad."
""
""
""
"Cloudy deep chestnut color with a small, but thick frothy head. Spicy banana and moderate clove-like phenols over some toffee, raisins, and light bread crust. More clove in the flavor...banana sweetness and a touch of brown sugar and wheaty tartness. On the lighter side of medium-bodied and a bit creamy, finishing quick and dry. Nothing thrilling or complex, but not terrible."
"O- Flavor left me slightly disappointed and the beer is too small in body."
"O: This is a decent beer, although the sweetness and medicinal flavor combined to reduce my enjoyment of it as I neared the end of the glass. Still, nothing to hold up a purchase of the Harvest 12-pack."
""
""
""
"O - A solid take on a German standard, but with a few less-than-stellar notes that keep it from being great. That said, I did enjoy it and will gladly drink it again every fall when the craft pack comes out."
"Overall - Not a bad effort from Sammy Adams here. It's no world beater, but it's certainly drinkable and somewhat enjoyable. A little more depth and complexity from the yeast would be nice, but I'm not complaining too much. It's the first dunkel I've had from an American brewery and so, by default, the best I've had this side of the Atlantic."
"Overall a decent drinking been. perhaps I need more exposure to Dunkelweizens in order to develop a better critique of the style."
""
"Overall it was very nice but just ok... to be honest this isn't my favorite style of beer but for this style very flavorful."
""

"O: A pretty nice surprise. Thought this was a pretty good beer and actually worked well on the hot day I consumed it on."

"The taste starts with cloves then transitions to banana bread and brown sugar, and some darker brown bread flavors. The mouthfeel is a medium bodied with active carbonation. Creamy, but not as full in the mouthfeel as most dunkelweizens. Overall not too bad."
"O: A lot of the seasonal Sam Adams beers aren't very good, but this was quite the opposite."
"Overall: A pleasant dunkelweizen and a good example of a style you don't really see everyday."
"would not go out of my way for another."
"Pours a medium to dark brown with a white frothy head. Smells like your typical wheat beers with a subtle hint of hops. Taste is the most surprising part, not super bready but a healthy balance of bread, roasty qualities with a refreshing finish. Overall a good addition to the Sam Adams seasonal line."
"This tasty beer comes out of the tap a nearly opaque dark honey brown. Malty aroma has firm wheaty and yeasty tones and a chocolaty hint. Rich, wheaty, malty flavor has yeasty, nutty and caramel notes to round it out. Full-bodied texture is lively and fizzy."
"Enjoyed this beer on tap. Special Draft Release by Samuel Adams. This Dunkelweizen poured a nice light brown color. It produced a very nice thick tan head- excellent head retention and lacing. The aroma smelled of bananas, cloves roasted grain. Taste was Medium in body, full of malt, banana and cloves. Easy to drink beer...excellent session beer. i was glad I ordered it. Samuel Adams never seems to disappoint."
"For the most part this is enjoyable. Something I would not hesitate to drink again. Though there are better examples of the style and better SA beers. Again, enjoyable and very much worth a try though."
"The brew pours a mahogany hue and is capped by a soapy tan head. The nose immediately offers an unexpected roast and smoke note; it is not overdone, but is unexpected, as I said. The mainstay of the brew's flavor and aroma is a strong and sweet banana-bubblegum flavor. The bubblegum note intensifies upon the finish. The feel is a tad lighter than medium and suits the brew well enough. I give it points for being complex, and for being a banana-bubblegum bomb, but it is not something I would drink much of."
"O: a solid and drinkable beer from sam."
"Medium carbonation and overall ok."
"Overall an ok brew though the clove spice tended to stand out for me, not my first spice choice. That limits what i'd pair this brew with."
"This beer pours out as a earthy color of brown, with some highlights of yellowish orange around the edges. The aroma has some nice clove in there along with the rational banana smells. The taste is mostly full of grains and wheat, with an aftertaste of driedfruits and clove. The mouthfeel is smooth much like any other weizen. It's a pretty good beer."
"Poured a medium brown in color with a small head that diminished rapidly with virtually no lacing. The aroma was that of cloves and raisins with the scent of grainy malts and an earthy yeast odor. It tasted a little acidic and sweet with a mild bitter aftertaste that only lasted a little while. Mouthfeel was smooth, dry and medium bodied. Overall a tasty but average brew."
"The CPj"
"overall a really solid beer and a good example of the style. nicely done."
"Somewhat thinner medium body, decent carbonation and fair feel on the palate. Okay drinking, but a little too sweet, especially since nothing in particular stands out in a positive manner."
"Overall: No flavors tend to overpower the others which is good. Acidity seems high, maybe needs to sit longer. All of the Sam Adams beers I've had in this seasonal mix pack have been good, but a little lackluster. This one is no different. Not memorable."
"D: It is good, but not really impressive. Crispness make it good with a meal, or for any other time you want something quenching. At the same time, it gives it a bit of a bite by the bottom of the glass. I would like it a little softer with more depth and character. This brew is something of a summer version of the style with its interesting-but-not-complex profile, mild heft, crispness, & softly tart edge."
"Sam Adams Dunkelweizen is easy drinking and a good entry level Dunkelweizen - falls short of the German examples."
"this beer was discovered as a nice surprise in a mix pack. In the glass it presented as a nice milky unfiltered beer. the initial smell gave great citrus and malty notes that complemented each other rather then competed. Over all a nice darkish beer with a great mouth good flavor and decent drinkability. Good unfiltered beer but still no hefey."
"Situation: Recovering from a three-hour family photoshoot at the mall...Glassware: Celebrator Doppelbock... Appearance: soft brown body that holds a healthy, thin, off-white head; little observable effervescence... Aroma: fresh malt softened by wheat; pleasantly subtle... Palate: soft, smooth, almost to the point of an oily consistency (in a good way); extremely drinkable... Taste: an almost bubble gum (!) like quality to the clove sensation that dominates; malts provide a pleasant underpinning... Overall: In a merging of styles, this is more weizen than dunkel--still, its finish, is sweet enoughto encourage a second bottle; within the fall sampler, this may be my selection to sixpack and savor..."
"Notes: This isn't bad, but there are much better examples of the style out there. It tastes about right for the style. The esters and phenols are there, but the yeast doesn't contribute much flavor. It feels like it's missing something. Mouthfeel leaves a bit more to be desired as well."
"You could definitely couldn't drink a few of these. it does seem to fill you up quite a bit. I drank two and felt kinda bloated and full. Without eating anything."
"The taste is yeasty banana with crystal sugar is it sweet and tart. The taste is a mix of honey mead, white wine and barley"
"Boston Beer Company--Samuel Adams--Dunkelweizen--Brewmaster's Collection--Part of Harvest Collection--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.10% ABV. 10 IBU's? (4.0 / 5.0) Big dense foamy lacy off white head. Light tight dark sediment. Cloudy dark amber tan orange color. Sweet banana toasted wheat ester front. Creamy cloying mellow sweet doughy light toffee fruit smooth tasty Dunkel body. Clean mild citrus fresh refreshing end. Sampled 1/2/2011. Not my favorite style but this was tasty and balanced. Purchased @ Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 8/31/2010."
"Not half bad, the buttery tone does take away from the other yeast characteristics my taste buds were waiting for."
"Drinkability: I liked it. I really could drink this again. If Sam Adams started selling this in 6-packs, I would buy it."
"D: Just too sweet to enjoy more than one. Not up to par with the great German representations of the style."
"Wonder if this is the dark wheat recipe they used to brew years back, I used to drink that but it doesnt seem like they're the same."
" The flavors of the malt have a pleasant toasted quality and mild earthy element w/ subtle weizen spice tinge and light tang of tropical fruit.The flavors are married well with thte slight caramel in the malt w/ wheat especially notable in the taste and mild dark brown sugar in the finish which is semi-dry. A good Dunkelweizen, I was not expecting as much flavor since Samuel Adams other wheats have not impressed me, but I liked the flavor and found it enjoyable throughout the bottle. I would probably order it again since I liked it better than the hefe."
"Drinkability. Maybe would get a little bored"
"D: Nicely palatable but as far as drinkability in concerned, this is what I would consider to be exactly average."
"D- I liked this beer but it was average at best. A nice drinker with a low ABV making it easy to drink a sixer of it if given the chance. Another above average beer from Sam Adams."
"Wow! This is truly a unique beer. Is it a dunkel? Is it a porter? Who Knows? But besides the quandary of categorization, this is a great dark beer Ive never tried before. For a dark beer, it has almost a lager feel and taste to it. Minimal head, beautiful molasses color, and a wonderful taste. The only knock on this brew is that it could hae a better aroma."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good poundable beer with flavor and substance making it worth drinking for a long time."
"Pours a murky, brownish amber color with a head that is almost non-existent. No carbonation to speak of. Smell is sort of sour and herbal, like potpourri. Taste is nicely complex, crisp and aromatic with a nice balance of sweet, sour, and bitter. Finishes crisp and satisfying, with a mildly tart aftertaste. Lots of flavor notes in the profile, from spices to fruits. Drinkability is decent."
"D: Easy to drink. Nothing special just a decent beer."
"Purchased by my dad as part of a mixed Sam Adams 12 pack containing 6 different beers. Pours a cloudy copper-brown colour with fairly thick off-white head. Some lacing on the glass. Smells of banana, clove and toasted caramel malt. Taste is fairly sweet, no real bitterness. This paired quite well with the ribs we were eating."
"D - Plenty drinkable if you're a fan of the style."
"This is an easy beer to drink, but overall was not overly impressive. I'd certainly drink it again, but would not seek it out."
"This beer pours a cloudy copperish color, with a white frothy head. The aroma I can describe as a german wheat funkiness. The taste is of a sweet, estery beer. Tastes funky, like something foreign. Maybe you could describe it as cloves and bananas. The mouthfeel is light to medium. As for the drinkability, I would have to say im happy with having to have tried this one at least."
"I have to say that this beer is somewhat odd. I've had a few dunkels before and this one has the lowest abv but the taste is similar. The problem is that the flavor comes on strong and then seems to muddle the different components together in a way that just confuse my taste buds. The flavors mix in an unsophisticated way. I probably won't have this one too frequently."
"Smooth, bready wheat malt up front. Toasted edges around banana, tropical fruit, and clove mid-palate. Banana bread richness (and some sweetness) near the finish. Very light noble hop notes with lingering clove, sweetbread, and yeast. Pretty taste all around. Medium to full body with nice, even carbonation to give it a creamy feel. Better than I expected."
"All in all, a great cool/cold weather beer from the BBC. This would actually be a great one to offer all throughout the fall and winter months."
"Beer is thin and has a pretty dominant aftertaste of wheat and wet grains. The midpalate is mildly sweet and fruity, it got better the more I drank and the further my standards for the beer I had in hand and I easily finished it but it was my only beer last night and I was left pretty disappointed. I won't bother again. There are literally dozens of better dunkelweisses out there."
"D - refreshing, and a bit enjoyable but missing some key qualities that makes the good ones great. a nice (and different) addition to the SA samplers which i will look forward to again."
"Eh, this could be a lot better. Not a bad beer, but missing something."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is basic dunkelweizen with some caramel, toffee, banana and clove notes. The flavor is more of the same with bananas and cloves, as well as some caramel malt, vanilla and brown sugar. Thin to medium mouthfeel, slightly water. Medium carbonation."
"D: Nothing special here. It goes down, pretty easy, but I don't want another. Average at best."
"I think this one is too carbonated. I know this style is highly carbonated, but this one kind of explodes in the mouth like soda and isnt pleasant, refreshing, or palate cleansing. I didnt really enjoy this one that much. Average at best."
"By the time your glass is half-empty, carbonation has reached a 'sweet spot' and you'll find the flavor carnival much more palatable. At this point, you'll nod to the Sam Adams Brewmaster and say, ""I see what you're trying to do here."""
"D - Man I don't know what they created but it seems to be a great brew filled with fruit, clove, and wheat flavorings. It is complex and original as mass produced. A very good brew!"
"I don't know what to say about this one. The taste is one of the most unique that I have had in a beer. It is also one that I did not like. I has a weird sweetness to it that I can't place. To me it was almost like cantelpope that was past ripeness. It also finished with a really odd aftertaste that I can't describe. I know that doesn't help but I just can't place it. Although it looks good in the glass it didn't have a multi-beer drink ability that I like. To be sure I had two and the second didn't go down any better than the first. It is obvious from the mostly favorable reviews that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum on this one."
"Though a bit mild for an American dunkelweizen, this beer still manages to feature most of the classic characteristics. If you don't like bold, dry beers, then this one probably isn't for you. Though I didn't explicitly dislike this beer, I couldn't find anything about it that I really, really liked. The Boston Beer Company made a good attempt at crafting this style, but I don't think that I will go out of my way to look for this particular beer in the future."
"Overall a very solid fall brew from the BBC"
"D- Drinks very nicely. Complex without being too rich. A very nice take on the style from the Boston Beer Co. I am pleasantly surprised to say the least."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to copper color with a small white head. In the aroma, small fruitiness, a small roast, and wheat notes. In the taste, roasty wheat like hints and an underlying fruitiness. A smooth a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry fruity aftertaste. Nice representation of style, but not too overwhelming in impressiveness."
"D - Very drinkable but not impressive. Overall not bad for dunkelweizen."
"Overall a good stab at a style most Americans never try, BBC makes another attempt at a style that keeps most craft drinkers happy while not alienating the typical marcro drinker. I just wished it had that creamy wheat feel I get from most German made wheat beers."
"I probably would not drink this beer again, unless I didn't have any other real (beer) options."
"D - This is pretty nice dunkel weizen. However, I prefer a true German dunkelweizen."
"D- It's really solid. A good early-fall drinker. I'd love to see this one in a sixer as it's good enough to session (tailgate beer perhaps). This one really exceded expectations. Unfortunately, my experience with American weizen beers kind of fall short of the banana and clove features from the yeast. This one was pretty spot-on."
"D. I would definitely pick up a six pack of this stuff. I'm already looking forward to another one."
"Picked up a SA Harvest twelve pack to try the Dunkel and the Pumpkin. Poured into a stemmed glass. Very light brown color with a moderate sized white head. Smell had a bit of freshly baked bread aroma to it. Taste was good, as I enjoyed the banana and clove flavor, and there was a decent amount of malt. The one flaw I found with this beer was the mouthfeel. It was extremely thin; borderline watery. Not pleasing in the mouth. Drinkability was nice, as I found this beer to be smooth and low in abv. A nice take on the style, but I'd say stick to the Germans if you have a craving for a great dunkel. This one just didn't impress me that much."
"Drinkability: Meh. Glad I got to try it, but really nothing I would seek out. Just really kind of watery and weak in the end."
"Pours a hazy amber orange color with a thick three finger slightly brown orange head which has nice retention but not a lot of lacing. The aroma has a caramel and bready malt backbone with hints of clove and banana fruitiness over the top. The fruit is haint but there. Taste has a nice caramel malt backbone with hints of toastiness and breadiness. There is a faint banana and clove flavor with a small hop bite at the very end. There is a sweet balance on the beer. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and a tad dry. The drinkability is good, it is an easy drink with a well rounded flavor with hints of sweetness. The mouthfeel is a little rough, but it is a solid beer."
"D-easy to drink, but not the best replica of a Dunkelweizen"
"D: OK drinkability, this wasn't too high on the abv scale and the flavors were all there. Perhaps if I let it mature a bit it would be better."
"Drinability is bleh too, some sticky mouth feel and bad lingering tastes."
"Pours a hazy amber orangish color, light to dark progression, with a touch of foam that settles virtually out. Mild banana smell, hints of spice, some malt. Taste is like a rich hefe, nicely balanced, with a light sour close. Wheaty mouthfeel, with decent carbonation. Pretty good, quite drinkable, nice beer."
"D: This is pretty disappointing flavor-wise. Very little complexity or character, although there's nothing at all wrong with it. Too light and basic to be anything more than decent."
"Pours a slightly cloudy mild brown the head is white and tall at first but settles to a thin film of tight bubbles pretty quickly but leaves a bit of nice lace on the way down. The smell is a bit faint but of clove, banana and yeasty esters the grain note is wheaty with wheat bread coming to mind. The taste is mainly clean crisp grain with a touch of the banana and clove overall probably too light and too clean. The finish is dry with a touch of lingering banana and apple while the body is crisp and light I would prefer something a bit fuller. Drinkability is ok this isn't the best of the style or the best beer with Sam Adams on the bottle but it's different and that alone wins it a few points."
"D. A little to sweet, sour finish. It's not my favorite in the fall beer selection of brews."
"Was in the Harvest Mix pack and it does suit the Fall season with its slightly dark spice nose mixed in with bananas and pumpkins. Add to it the low ABV for the style and you have a great session beer for Autumn evenings. Not too sweet and not overly complex it scores points for being very drinkable ."
"Drinkability - not a bad brew at all. Seems closer to a fall seasonal due to the ""pumpkin"" taste, but not bad. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"Pours a clear, brown color. 6/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight hop, sweet malt, yeast, wheat, slight alcohol, hint of citrus, hint of clove, and a hint of grain. Fits the style of a Dunkelweizen. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, yeast, clove, slight hop, hint of alcohol, and wheat. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"This beer was poured into a pint glass in anticipation of my Oktoberfest celebration. The appearance is beautiful, pours dark; lightens up and has a nice white lace head. The nose is pure cloves, it nice but pure cloves. The taste is sweet and some slight spiciness. Nothing great on the the mouthfeel, and in my opinion the sweetness of the brew takes away from the drinkability."
"This beer was decent until the last couple ounces, where it went from decent to ...undesirable. Not terrible, but a pretty lifeless, very messy interpretation of the style."
"Drinkability: It isn't bad, but there are better examples of the style out there. Too much emphasis on the banana and yeast. Not enough complexity to keep me coming back for more."
"Overall this beer was a let down. I love this style but Sam Adams didn't give it the justice it deserves. Everything about this beer felt held back. Go back to the drawing board and drink some good german examples for inspiration. Wont be getting this again."
"I would love to find this in a 6 pack, but unfortunately it came in one of those sampler packs. So go pick one of those up. Sam Adams, northern for beer."
"Edit early November 2012, best by Jan. 2013. Bit murky with some yeast chunks on the pour. Aroma is subtle with very limited caramel and yeast influence. A few months on the bottle but still within range and a bit of a let down. No modification on scores.."
"This is what I wish SA would do more of. Try some more unique styles. A nice clovey malty aroma. The taste is cloves but also hops that ends drier then I expected. Which makes this a very easy to drink brew. Its not a classic example of the style, buts thats ok. We need more out of the box attempts from SA. This one has a nice malty sweetness that would do well if they put then out in 6-packs."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Comes out an amberish type color, small off white head that goes away very quickly, no lacing to it. More clarity than I expected, slight haze, but not much really. Smell is the best part in my opinion. Very herbal with some touches of some yeast in there. Cloves and a slight banana smell to it. Wheats and malted barley give it a slight sweet smell to it. Taste is good to, very bready/wheaty. Yeast also very present. The clove and banana flavors are there again. There are certainly some caramelized malts provide sweetness. There isn't a hop flavor but there is some bitterness to it. Mouthfeel is good, good carbonation level and a good balance of bitterness and sweetness, medium bodied. Drinkability is good."
"D: Refreshing but sweet and tasty. A real treat, and among the better SA choices."
"This beer pours a darker cloudy amber color with very little head. The beer has a good banna smell to it. The flavor is rather complex. A smooth wheat flavor with hints of banna and clove. Nice flavors easy to drink. Overall a good beer with nice flavors would get again."
"The pour is darkish amber/copper with about an inch of cream colored head. Yes, there's banana and clove, but I got an overwhelming musty grass aroma. Some breadiness in the taste as well as the requisite banana and clove, but the musty funk carried over from the scent and incorporated itself into the flavor. It almost presents as a sour note. There's just something about the smell and taste that really rubs me the wrong way. Quite a bit of carbonation, but it had the feeling of some thickness after it went down, which was a plus. I won't go looking for this again."
"Final Thoughts: Two Thumbs UP!!!! Would reccomend and would by a 6 pack if i can find one. This beer was a part of the harvest collection mix pack."
"Drinks easy, delivers a lot of flavor for the ABV. Not the best dunkelweizen out there but respectable enough"
"Hmm.. Not sure where this one went but I wasn't a huge fan.. There was a sour element to this that seemed to throw me off..."
"12oz. bottle served in a weizen glass. Pours the color and clarity of unpasteurized apple cider with a dense, one inch, creamy, off-white head. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with thick swaths of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses dark fruit and yeast. Taste follows nose; however, flavors are a bit more muted and there is a suggestion of bubblegum, as well as a slightly bready quality that presents towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a pleasant, even background carbonation. A solid and easy drinking dunkel. Would love to see this one added into the regular rotation as a seasonal."
"Overall this is a plain beer that presents its style but doesn't do anything great."
"Pours out a cloudy light bown color, with no yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. The smell of the beer is impressive, smells like a fresh wheat beer, slightly spicey, but more phenolic, with hints of banana and vanilla. Also smells slightly bready, which is spot on for a dunkel. Taste is more clove, banana, and mouthfeel is crisp on the tonque with adequate carbonation. The notes on the bottle say that this is a traditional Bavarian yeast strain, and yet this beer taste mildly familiar. Which makes me wonder, where are you getting the yeast, Jim? Weih...something? ;-)"
"D- An average dunkelweixen, certainly not the best but I would never turn this down if offered"
"Morey's Bottom Line: I've only had a handful of beers in this style, but this is a pretty good one. The only one that I like better is Great Lakes Glockenspiel. It's obvious that this beer is well crafted."
"I poured into a pint glass to a couple inches of off white head. It is a hazy dark amber, bordering on copper, color. The aroma is bananas and clove. The taste is bananas and cloves at first. Then I get a real carbonation bite. I get some caramel malt in there, too. This beer seems overcarbonated to me. This is only my second dunkelweizen, but I prefer my previous selection."
"A good brew but nothing I would seek out or buy if it were a stand alone beer, not in a variety pack."
"D - Very high"
"D - Overall its not a bad beer. Though I did enjoy it, I don't think I'd have another soon after. In comparison to other dunkels, especially those from Germany, this one doesn't seem to match up. It lacks that balance of crisp wheat deliciousness with the darker notes that most dunkelweizens have."
"The beer has a medium body and average carbonation. A slight coat persists that feels like a wet film. It isn't very sticky or flavorful. This individual bottle drinks well, but because it is only available in a mixed 12 pack, I have to limit the drinkability. I wouldn't buy the whole thing just to get two bottles of this beer; I'd rather try another brewery's product. If it because available on it's own, I'd be more likely to seek this one out a second time."
"Pretty thin and weak for a dunkel, seek others. Disappointing."
"D: not a bad dunkelweizen, features all of the flavors I am familiar with in a hefe, maybe a little sweeter than normal"
"Taste is a bit of a letdown after the aroma, light with bubbly carbonation, the feeling is way too thin for a dunkel though and drags things down, the fruitiness is most prevalent in the taste with hints of banana."
"I liked this beer, but I'm not in love with it. Maybe we'll just date occasionally."
"D- yes, it's drinkable, and I could have several of these in a sitting if I wanted, but it remains to me just an average beer at best, there's nothing offensive about it at all, but leaves me feeling like I could take it or leave it"
"D- Not a terrible beer, but the flavors just weren't as vivid as they are in good dunkelweizens."
"Pours a hazy copper with a small off white head. There's some lacing but not very much. The smell is malt and some breadiness with a little banana and cloves. The taste is sweet up front and then some wheat and lemon flavor along with some spices. There's a little banana in the taste but its fairly faint. Medium bodied and smooth in terms of carbonation. Very drinkable to where it could be a session beer if Dunkelweizens are your thing."
"Overall this is an OK dunkelweizen, though SA needs to work on the haze."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a really nice wheat malt scent along with a delicate hefe yeast aroma and a touch of caramel sweetness. It has excellent yeast character with only a minimal crystal malt contribution. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth pale, wheat, and caramel malt flavor. It's dry with a moderate caramel sweetness and plenty of yeast esters. The banana/clove character is ever present with a pretty slick malt profile. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking dunkel. It's not as sweet as some, but the caramel malt taste is there."
"D: This is a pretty tasty beer. Not sure I could do more than a couple due to the strong flavors and sweetness."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D - Out of all the beers in the Harvest Collection 12-pack, I was probably looking forward to this one the most, so that may account for much of my disappointment. Unfortunately, this is basically an American pale wheat ale with dark malt. I'm not sure who Boston Beer is trying to impress with this one, because it's ""too dark"" for the masses and too bland for craft drinkers. That being said, it's an easygoing beer for mindless drinking, which I suppose bumps up the drinkability score by a half point."
"D- This is like fall's version of the hefe, Darker/maltier, but still with that clovey banana notes. Overall I like the idea, but this version is alright."
"D- not really hitting the mark of a true German dunkelweizen, but it's definitely a drinkable beer; like most SA beers it's tame in it's flavor and does an average job at hitting the style, but with it's low alcohol makes it a decent session beer"
"Look is heavy on the dunkel, everything else drives home the weizen. A tight, persistent khaki cap sits on a hazy caramel pour, like an unfiltered Yuengling. The smell screams German hefe yeast, with a decent dose of funk (a word I've never used in relation to a Sam brew) and earth to burn. The first sip feels surprisingly slick, but the sweetish finish hangs on longer as the glass warms. The hops are appropriately restrained to let a decent yeast strain shine, though I wouldn't mind seeing a deeper malt platform. A good, drinkable American effort, though not a contender to the German big boys."
"Bottle with a layer of fine yeast in the bottom pours a hazy brown with one finger of off-white foam that lasts about 30 seconds. Aromas are predominately of toasty wheat and yeast, with a fair amount of cloves. First thing that jumps out to me is not how the beer tastes, but how it feels. Texturally, as with with many Sam Adams, it is nearly perfect: a medium body is carbonated such that it feels electric at first and becomes sumptuously smooth as it washes over the tongue. The flavors are certainly good and consistent with the nose, and is just a tad less complex and interesting than those of my favorite dunkelweizens."
"Drinkability: Just decent. Not a terrible beer, but not very exciting either."
"I was excited to try this, but ultimately was dissapointed. I think SA borrowed too much from its now deceased ""hefeweizen"" to create this dunkelweiss."
"D- I liked this beer, would go for it at a party or something but would not go apeshit over it. A decent dark dunkle that needs more wheat."
"As far as smell goes, the presence of tropical fruit and some clove spice brought to mind apricots covered in clove. Pretty nice. Taste was less satisfying. Not much on the fruit or bready end of things, but rather boldly-crisp and quite spicy. I could have wished for some hints of banana. I would have been pleased with a fuller mouth feel as well."
"Overall a nice and easy dark wheat beer. Not exceptional but not bad either."
"D-dark hefeweizen or light dunkelweizen. This beer is nice and drinkable but not as flavorful as it could be."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of fruits, cloves, and spices. Taste is good, banana, cloves, fruits, lots of flavor. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this is a very good beer worth seeking out."
"The beer pours with almost no lacing. It starts out as a ruby brown at the top and gets progressively lighter until it ends in a ruby orange bottom. The smell is citrus and spice. Nutmeg, clove, allspice. A hint of yeast. That of what you would use tor rise bread - fruit cake-ish. The flavor has the smooth, creamyness banana flavor and the tart-sweetness of apple. Spiced-bread - pumpkinbread. Clove. Mild hop finish. Mouthfeel is decent. Smooth on the tongue despite some carbonation bite in the back of the mouth. Drinkability is passable. Better of two dunkelwizens I've had."
"Overall, this one isn't bad. For a lighter beer in the Harest Variety Pack, it tastes way too boozey for me. Still better than Cherry Wheat or the horrid Cranberry Lambic, though."
"Pours a light brown color with a 1"" white head that remained for a while and left a little bit of lacing in the glass. Smells wheatey, with a little bit of banana and clove as expected, I also think I detect a little bit of spice. Taste is good, its an enjoyable beer to drink. Its wheatey with the banana and cloves, with the spice, like the smell, but the wheaty taste is a little... toasty and malty? Mouthfeel is medium light, with average carbonation. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer to drink. I would definitely buy these if you could get them outside of the Sam Adams Harvest seasonal pack. I enjoy wheat beers and this was a nice variation. Its a little darker and denser for the fall or winter months than a Hefeweizen or Wit, but it retains that refreshing feeling."
"Taste: Once again, it's very close to it's German counterparts. Doesn't seem to have the same depth of flavor and complexity of the best examples of this style."
"D - This was a pleasant surprise in the Harvest Mix Pack. Very drinkable, this one really hit the spot!"
"This is a good beer for the fall. Probably my vote for the weakest in the Fall Harvest pack for this year. This being the weakest makes it a pretty good 12 pack."
"Drinkability: Another solid specialty offering from Sam Adams. This one is a bit on the sweet side, but is good for the style. If they released this in sixes, I would pick one up."
"Picked up this years SA Harvest Sampler Pack, which has a fine selection of SA brews. You only get two of each beer and in this case it is both a good and bad thing, while the dunkelweizen has all the right tastes and traits they are all muted. The flavors are here they are just light, a good beer to try on noobs to German wheat beers but its no good for a pro."
"D- over all mouth feel deteriorates, flavor stays though. the whole bottle is enjoyed."
"The aroma is true to the style, fruity, wheat, grainy, and spicy. The appearance is a cloudy amber color, a decent size white head that disappears quickly. The flavor is spicy, grainy, wheat, dark fruit. The mouth feel is a little thin with high carbonation. The finish is clean with lingering cloves and mild hops. My first dunkelweizen, so I don't have anything to compare it too. It was very pleasant though. It is one of the better offerings that I have had from Sam Adams."
"light to medium bodied with slightly above average carbonation. fairly drinkable; the problem is you'd lose interest before sessioning became a possibility."
"T - A simple flavor - slightly dark, but mostly clean and refreshing. Absolutely evokes the german style. A solid, if not spectacular, offering."
"D: Not impressed. Better German beers out there for this style."
"D: Not one of BBC's better efforts. I won't be seeking it out again."
"Overall it lacks some body and complexity as I mentioned earlier but that helped this beer for me."
"Another fantastic beer from Samuel Adams."
"Overall, a solid effort fo the style, although not something I'll necessarily be looking for in its own sixers."
"Recommended, of sorts."
"D: A slightly above average version. At least they used the traditional yeast which was not apparent in their Hefeweizen. A nice brew, but not a reason to buy the Harvest Collection."
"d 3.5-4 started off much more promisingly than it ended, yet still competent."
"A pretty good brew, but I would've liked them to amp up the roasty bitterness a bit. This tastes practically like a regular hefeweizen. That being said, a fine brew for the fall, and a worthy addition to the sampler."
"A very easy beer to drink thanks to the pleasing taste. Sam Adams did a great job on the Kellerweis hefeweizen, but I feel that they went a little too ""safe"" on this one. It's too clean in terms of looks and taste to stack up to its German counterparts, but is by no means a terrible dunkelweizen. A good, solid beer that's still head and shoulders above 90% of the crap sold out there."
"Pours a light brown into a pint glass with a nice head. Smells of cloves, and wheat yeast, which smell I love. The taste is light, refreshing, and wheaty. I don't know what else to say about this basic wheat beer, other than that it's delicious and very drinkable."
"D-I love a good dunkelweizen but this falls short in my book. I'd like a bit more malt richness...a good bit more actually....also the banana esters could be stronger on the taste too. Also missing a spicy element I also expect. This could be improved a lot."
"Dark amber-orange in color topped with white bubbly head. Aroma of sweet malt, caramel, slight spiced fruit, and cloves. Malt in the taste, cloves, spices, carrots, bananas ride out the finish. Light in body and carbonation. A strange sweet drink that is rather annoying to finish."
"It's pretty good."
"Pour is a deep orange color with a touch of maroon in there. Surprisingly light for a dunkel. Head is solid with a touch of lacing. Nose is tasty, strong somewhat spicy wheat dominates, with a touch of general fruity malt sweetness. Flavor is likewise - more of a straight-up wheat beer than anything unique, this again has a lightly biting wheat sweetness, a touch of fruitiness, and maybe a bit of hops on the back end. Nice, quite drinkable brew. Overall, another solid entry by Sam Adams, although this one is maybe a little off in terms of the true ""Dunkel"" style."
"Im not a fan of this one. Weinhenstephaner has a much, much better example."
"Good drinkability but could be better with a tad more flavour."
"A tasty example of the style that would be a good way to introduce someone to it. I wouldn't recommend it if there were other examples available. Still, it's tasty and it's worth a try. I recommend it on these merits alone."
"Poured into a New York New York wheat glass a hazey brown with a thick froathy head. The scent coming off of it is banana, cloves, and belgian yeast. Strong on the belgian yeast and spices. The taste isn't a strong as what the nose would lead you to expect. Everything that the nose found can be found on the tongue, banana, cloves, and belgian yeast. Add in some carmel and you've got a nice little dunkel here. But the flavors just don't have any pop to them. I would like to have some more sugary flavors in this. The mouthfeel is a little high in the carbonation."
"D - Easy drinking, sessionable with clean flavors. I'll happily drink the second one that came in my mix pack, but I think there are better Dunkelweizens worth picking up on a regular basis."
"Copper colored brew, pretty hazy, medium sized cream colored head. The main scent is wheat grains and darker malts. Same for the taste, a predominantly wheat grain taste, with a darker malt infusion. Unfortunately the taste doesnt really evolve much beyond that. Not that its bad per se, its just fairly one-dimensional. Thinner bodied. Overall its certainly not bad, its just alright."
"D-An easy drinker for sure, but weizen yeasts just aren't really my thing. I'm just not a fan of the esters that are characteristic of these beers."
"Pours a dark, semi cloudy brownish red color with a very faint head that dissipates quickly. Obviously not bottle conditioned nor was there any yeast sediment in the bottle. Disappointing appearance. Aroma is true to German dunkleweizens with rich toffee, banana, and a touch of croissant breadyness. Really typical but nothing jumping out. The taste however is right on par with what I am looking for. Big bold lemony banana and toffee flavors with a bright acidity that wakes up the palate. Fresh flavors of banana peel, orange zest and maybe some milk chocolate. Mouthfeel works for me. It's carbonated well just not like traditional dunkleweizens. Has a solid level of dryness on the finish but that typical touch of sweetness to balance it out. Drinkability once again is high on this with the nice low abv and delicious factor. Worth trying for sure."
"D - It goes down like most Sam Adams brews, quick & easy. It's very easy to drink more than a few of these in a sitting. A highly drinkable Dunkelweizen here that's worth a try for sure. I'd drink it again but probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again unless I was low on cash."
"d: Refreshing, solid beer. Moderately drinkable."
"Pours a dark, cloudy amber-orange with a big clumpy, off-white head. Smells of cloves, and other mild spices. Tastes of caramelized plantains and roasted almonds. Good carbonation, a medium-light body, and a dry finish. Quite a complex brew with a lot going on for the palate to enjoy."
"Still, a great drinking beer overall. I'd have no problem polishing off a sixer of these, and hope SA decides to sell it that way in the future."
"D- whatever. I'm not sure if this is a summer beer, a fall beer, a spring beer...just a mess"
"In all honesty, I'm kind of on the fence about recommending this beer to other people. It's definitely worth trying & I wouldn't turn down one of these in the future, but probably won't go buy a sixer of it either."
"D: Easy to drink and not particularly offensive, but this one falls far short of what I typically expect of a good dunkel in every category."
"D= very drinkable if you're in the weisse mood and especially if you want something darker and more creative."
"Not your typical Dunkelweizen, with generous banana and clove; oddly, we did not pick up on either of those traits, as it was a bit mellower or restrained, though still flavorful. That said, it's hard to pit this against the bells and whistles of your typical Dunkelweizen."
"D - A good example of the style but not stellar. Easily quaffable and goes down smooth and easy. Could drink a few in a sitting."
"D: Flavorful enough to not be boring, but good with food because the taste isn't overpowering."
"Conclusion: Really glad I got to try it, but it's not something I'm broken up about not getting to try regularly."
"Pours an aged copper penny color with thin off white head, but decent lacing. Smell and taste is of freshly roasted grains with a touch of yeast, bread, dark fruit and spice. Medium body, fully carbonated. Nothing complex, but just a pretty good beer from Sam Adams."
"Pretty good overall. It goes down easy, but it's not really something I would want to drink all night. I would like to see a little more sweetness in the way of fruity flavors and a little more carbonation. A solid addition to the Samuel Adams line."
"i poured it into a glass it was a nice medium brown color with a nice head then floats to a nice thin lace. Have a nice smell of malts and a hint of fruit. Has a nice crisp malty, fruity flavor. Has a little of a heavy mouth feel on the back of the tongue. I think it is very drinkable. I really enjoy this beer, another good one from SA."
"A solid Dunkelweis from Sam Adams. Not a German version at all, but pretty damn good, and very drinkable. Just a solid American Dunkelweizen session beer."
"I was impressed when it was like a German style since I had tried other American Wheat beers. Pours red brown in color with a decent head. Taste is very yeasty with slight fruit notes, maybe dark fruits. It is very drinkable, if it comes in 6-packs I would buy it just for a regular. Impressive wheat from SA"
"A very drinkable beer, especially in the autumn season. I don't think I'd make a habit of the style, but it is a nice change of pace."
"Tastes very good, but not quite as full-flavored as I'd have liked given the promising aromas. Bready flavors all-around with flashes of apple and white grape. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and a little on the light side, which is how I often find SA beers. Just a touch of bitterness to end each sip. Overall, a tasty beer that I'd enjoy drinking again."
"(D)- Would not be my first choice for a Dunkelweisse, but decent enough to have a few of."
"Would I buy more of it? - hmm, tough call as I'd have to buy the entire 12-pack. I'm leaning towards no."
"Pours a dark copper body with a rocky white head. Aromas of spicy yeast esters and toasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a tingly level of carbonation. Flavors of sweet caramel and dried cherries. There's a very low bitterness in the finish. Pretty good drinkability."
"M/D - Clean, smooth, some slight carbonation, great feel and taste throughout the palate. Great beer and very drinkable."
" ~ This is a good brew. It has a certain sessionability to it. I recommend you try this one."
"This is one beer Sam Adams ought to plug in six-packs. One of their best new beers in some time, I gladly boasted about it to a cashier the next time I grabbed a 12 at the store. Very good, and well worth trying."
"I would buy this again, if I could find it in a six pack."
"this is a nice stab at a flavourful style which i quite like. sam adams (BBC) would be wise to put this in six packs. i know i would revisit this quite frequently because of the value of SA brews. definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: this dunkel is quite drinkable in my book. I got it in a harvest beers multipack but haven't seen it around here in sixers. I think I would buy it every so often if it were so available."
"This is a very drinkable beer, but is somewhat lacking in flavor. It's pretty good, but not as rich and complex as I would like. Like I said before, let it warm up a bit."
"Very cidery for some reason."
"Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen is a cloudy tawny beer with a thin, dense, off white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It smells spicy and a little sweet, with notes of clove, pear and raisins. It's medium bodied with a metallic feel. The finish is quick and a bit gritty. It has a mellow flavor of banana and pear, with a light, grassy bitterness. It seems like it will get sweet, but it doesn't. The aftertaste is musky. It's not bad."
"good mouthfeel, a touch grainy maybe, but good drinkability."
"Really smooth medium in body. No bubbles on the back of the throat if it wasn't for the taste I would think I was drinking water."
"D - Not a bad dunkel. It's appearance and nose don't represent the rest of the beer well though. After that it tapers off a bit making it less drinkable but I still wouldn't turn it down. Not bad, just a fair dunkelweizen."
"A creamy light khaki head sits comfortably on a leathery tan colored body. The bready, malty aroma is loaded with cloves and bananas. Medium in body. A sweet malty front leads to an abundance of spicy (yeast) banana fruitiness. Some clove, brown sugar and a hint of molasses are there also in the flavor. The finish sees a return to that dominating banana flavor. Pretty solid for a dunkelweizen. I enjoyed this in the SA Harvest Collection, but I don't know if I'd go out of my way to pick this up if it were available in six packs."
"Pours a clear medium brownish amber with a creamy tan head. Aroma is big on artificial banana with lesser notes of clove and vanilla. Flavor is also overbearing with the pure banana oil and clove, with no room for bready malt to even it out. Finish is a bit weak. Mouthfeel is surprisingly supple, similar to the authentic German versions. Some good qualities, some bad, overall a decent beer at best."
"Dryness on the palate, but with a maltiness. Could be a little less attenuated to bring the beer around, which also effects drinkability."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber-brown color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into lacing that lasts until the beer is gone. The aroma is of banana, toffee, malt, and a hint of chocolate. While there is some banana present in the aroma, it isn't as strong as most German examples. It is almost as though they used a neutral American yeast strain, instead of a German weizen yeast. The taste is like the aroma. Again, I'd like to see more banana bread flavors, and some clove too. The malt flavors that are present are nice though. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but lacks the chewy texture that I expect in a weizen. Overall, this is a mediocre beer, and not a dunkelweizen I would pick up again if I had more than one option."
"Cheers!"
"M: Medium-body with noticeable texture."
"Notes: A nice beer from Sam Adams. I think they would be smart to sell this in six packs."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: It is very crisp and clean but the beer retains some good weight which fills you up. It has a very light carbonation and is easy to enjoy."
"For me, hefeweizens are not a very drinkable style, but this dunkelweizen is perfectly fine in the relative drinkability department; I finished mine quite quickly and would have another."
"The taste is a bit watery, was expecting more flavorful malts. Very little sweetness. The yeast does its thing, but the overall impression is that of a dunkelweizen light. It's not a bad beer, and in fact is one of the better SA beers, but it does not come close to the likes of Julius Echter or Weihenstephaner. I would like to see this in 6-packs by itself and would be worth a purchase every now and then in the usual SA price range for Bavarian wheat beer fans such as myself."
"The malt and fruitiness of this beer are superbly balanced, and the sensation of drinking it is a real treat. Simultaneously, it glides down and settles gently in the gut, making it easy to declare this an extremely drinkable brew. Both flavorful and easy to drink? Get me another!"
"The body is exceptionally crisp; not smooth enough for a weizen."
"O - Reminds me a lot of german represenatations of the style in a good way. This is definitely not a weak representation and is pretty true to the style. Would have this again. I hope they put this out in its own six pack eventually."
"overall a nice dunkelweizen."
"I bought the harvest collection cause this beer was in it and i'm thinking it wasn't worth it but it's the only way i've seen it."
"D: Better than the sum of its parts, it's an enjoyable although low-impact brew. Nice if you like a more sour wheat bite to your dunkel."
"Medium bodied, with a bit of a syrupy feel. Not filling at all though. Nothing stellar here, but a good drinker."
"Drinkability is good. This beer has some very good tastes and goes down very smooth. Dunkelweizens are a tough beer to make great, but Sam Adams does a very good job with their offering."
"Pours a murky brown with a medium sized head. Smell is spicy wheat with a bit of caramel also a white wine note. Taste has a very mild sweetness. A roasted grainy flavor. A bit of spicy wheat. Herbal flavor in the finish. Maybe a touch watery. Overall a decent dunkel for an American version."
"Very nice foggy brown appearance w/ slight amber hues. Burnt toast , biscuits and nutmeg on the nose. The taste is complex and you taste the dark malts up front; caramel, and malted wheat adds a nice cereal note. Some hints of fruits and banana shows up in the middle ; crisp finish ; medium bodied ; well done,"
"Pours a very nice copper-mud color, unfiltered, with a tiny bit of head, but no lacing. Nice scent, some nice dark grains with a nice sweet wheat malt aroma and a hint of pepper/spice. Good taste, deep and rich, a nice dark wheat with a strong pepper aftertaste from the noble hops. Goes down fine, if a little too thick."
"Medium bodied, with medium-full carbonation. A bit prickly, nice and crisp in flavor, which seems to be an American touch, but I think this style should comes across as creamier on the palate. Overall I do like this beer, and it is real easy to drink this one down. Maybe too easy."
"RB!"
"Notes: Looks good, smells good, tastes good, but something is kind of missing. It lacks punch or distinction. Fades into mediocrity."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, not a bad beer, appears too clear for an unfiltered weizen, perhaps a draw back from having it from a bottle."
"I drank the one beer, but that would be my limit on this one."
"The clear winner of the beers in the fall sampler, I really enjoyed the dunkelweizen. Tasty blend of flavors, and a little more heft than many hefeweizens. Good stuff."
"A refreshing drink but I'm not a big fan of the style."
"D: It's a great balanced beer and to be honest I would have no clue it was American in a blind taste test. Standout beer by Samuel Adams."
"Pours very hazy, almost muddy looking, amber like a good quality unfiltered apple juice. Little head, and what there is fades to a thin swirl. Smells bread-like with some hints of banana and clove. The taste is a trifle sweeter, with a good deal more banana, a bit more clove, and a touch of lemon in addition to the lighter breadiness. A little on the lighter side, but quite tasty. Clean and smooth in the mouth, this is a fairly light Dunkleweiss, but really quite nice."
"drinkability - Nice craft beer from SA. Worth a try, just didn't like the fact I had to buy a case to get to it."
"Not too crazy about green apple touch, though it is slight. Quite wheaty... Drinks well enough, though don't know that I would want to keep drinking it...Solid, though would take a some classic German examples of style over this one."
"D= pretty decent. Not bad but not great. Exactly what you would expect from sam adams. A very middle of the road for any style. Ill drink it again if offered in a heartbeat but I dunno if I would buy it again myself. Rthe reason I would buy it is to introduce to someone else."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I would drink it again."
"The most exciting new release from Sam Adams in at least a few years. Compared to their hefeweizen this is a benchmark accomplishment. I squeezed the two bottles from the fall Harvest sampler pack to find one of the most inviting looking dunkelweizens I've seen in awhile. Big amber brown clouded body with a billowing cream tarnished head that rises above the rim of my 1/2 liter Ayinger weissbier glass. Lacing is even and fine with intricate detail, beautiful looking brew. Aromatics come with a touch of raisin and tart sliced green apples, a bit of clove, banana, and bubblegum as well. Even some mango juicy characteristics arise with further sniffs. A touch of herbal hops in the nose with a nice roasted malt edge on the biscuit and wheat malt profile. Flavor is perfect none of that traditional Sam Adams house yeast this one is authentic German weissbier yeast, brings out all of those great phenols. Juicy sweetness with roasted malt edge brings to mind brown sugar sprinkled banana bread with sliced green apple tartness, and mango fructose complexity. Herbal hops for balance with big yeast characteristics finishing sharply wheaty with drying yeast components. Mouthfeel is perfect with effervescence in the carbonation and medium to lighter bodied. Nothing cloying or heavy on the palate, perfect version of the style. Drinkability is crazy, a beer they will be successful with if released in six packs on it's own. Every once and in awhile the Samuel Adams Brewmaster's Collection hits a homerun, I'm glad I was here to experience it."
"M & D: Not the smoothest beer in the world but still very drinkable and a pretty good carbonation level that adds a nice kick."
"D: Pleasantly subdued aroma and taste. Very refreshing."
"Purchased as part of the seasonal 12 pack this year. 12oz bottle. I had this years and years ago, probably 15 years ago and remember enjoying it but never being able to find it. The website has all the other ""brewmaster collection"" brews, but not this one. Hrmmm. Pours out to a cloudy dark amber, forming a tall off-yellow whipped head with excellent retention and awesome lacing. Carbonation is moderate-brisk. The aroma is very nice...lots of old brown bananas, cloves, a nice toasted malt base, phenols, some spicy hops...The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice tang. The taste is as a good dunkel weizen should be...cloves and bananas with dark malts popping through but it doesn't quite get to the ""fresh banana bread"" ideal...in this case, there is some burnt rubber in there as well..something that either my taste buds have gotten more sensitive to over the last 3 years or some mutation that has been going on with a prominent manufactured yeast strain. At any rate, it's nice to see it back, but honestly, with Michelob Dunkel Weizen being available for $6.99/6'er (and the fact that it is one of my very favorite dunkel weizens ever), I'll stick with that when I need a DW kick."
"D: Overall this is a good dunkel. It was actually better than I expected. Flavors and aroma are a little subdued, but still a solid offering."
"M&D - easily drinkable, no drawbacks in mouthfeel or drinkability, nothing stands out though"
"Tastes good and feels smooth, and does not seem to be over 5.5% abv or so. Very easy to drink. I'd buy a sixer of this over a lot of SA's beers, and it's easily the best thing in the harvest pack (even if the mediocre appearance is going to knock the score down a bit). It's hard to get a fresh dunkel, often. This isn't the truest one in the world, but it's a good beer."
"D - I was really suprised by this beer. Alot of Sam Adams are hit or miss, but this one is actually very good. Good flavor and sessionable ABV makes for a beer I wouldnt mind having several of."
"D=good and enjoyable, nearly sessionable"
"D: I was quite impressed with this dunkel; drinking it made me wish that it was available outside of the Harvest Pack (not that the pack is a bad deal, but it'd be nice to be able to buy this on its own in a sixer). I'd definitely have it again."
"D: A nice dunkel overall. A better appearance would be nice, but the aroma and flavor are very nice."
"Notched best by Jan 10."
"Drinkability - Easily drinkable. How sad this only comes in a variety pack - they will do a six pack of Cherry Wheat but God forbid they do a six pack of this. Perhaps they are gauging people's reactions to this since it is newly released? Let's hope so."
"Pours a cloudy yellow copper with a pillow head. Nice wheat presence on the nose..somewhat understated cloves. Taste mirrors smell with slightly understated qualities. Mouthfeel is smooth, slightly creamy..nice on the palate. This lends itself to a very drinkable product."
"The carbonation was nice and spicy and the body was more medium to full with a hearty character. The drinkability was there and was only harmed by my impression of the aroma and flavor."
"I would buy this often if it was in 6'er's.. It really is the only reason I bought the Autumn pack... that said... I'll probably buy another or two while they're available... this a pretty damn good example on the style.. very drinkable."
"Easily drinkable; a decent interpretation of the style, though a bit lacking in the richer character of traditional examples. Could use a bit more malt character and perhaps a little more fermentation character in the nose. Much better than the Sam Adams ""Hefeweizen," as this one can truly be called a Dunkelweizen without hesitation. Definitely one that Boston Beer should put into more regular circulation."
"Eric"
"Drinkability: Another Sam Adams brew, and another job well done. This beer isn't outstanding as many German dunkelweizens may be, but it's still damn good."
"D- a very drinkable brew, this is a good example of the style, but not a great one"
"Drinkability: A solid dunkelweizen. Not great, but still pretty good."
"Taste: It has a strong spiciness with a hint of the banana bread flavor that only stays for a little bit. There is very little taste after the initial taste which is disappointing but overall this is good."
"Not a bad effort, the banana is fairly muted with the clove spiciness taking the foreground. Pretty spicy, maybe from the hops? I didn't like how thin the mouthfeel was or the finish. If i didn't know any better, i would believe there was no yeast in suspension. Pretty good effort, very sessionable, but nothing special."
"Since Sam Adams obviously knows how to make an authentic German Weizen, what the f*** is wrong with their Hefeweizen?"
"D-IMO, it is very drinkable. I think one could session this beer preety easy. I highly recommend this dark wheat beer."
"This beer is very easy drinking, low abv, and straightforward. To be honest, I remember the sample of this beer at acbf before it came out to be much better, with a lot more character and better mouthfeel. Maybe my palate wasn't in the best shape then, but I was a bit underwhelmed. But its worth having in the mix pack."
"Very good overall. I would make it a year round offering were I BBC, I liked it much better than their hefeweizen."
"This is both incredibly drinkable and flavorful at the same time."
"It's okay. There are a ton of better examples. Interesting to see a niche Bavarian beer as a ""flavor of the moment"" style right now. Lots of DW's are showing up, and this one really doesn't stand out for any other reason than it's amber color. Take it however you want, but the Michelob version is MUCH better than this one."
"Pours a honey brown color with a tight off white head that dissipates into a sparse cap. The aroma is of banana and clove, wheat malt, and a light metallic scent. The taste is of bubble gum and clove, some toasted malt gives a little bitter edge and the flavor is rounded out by a lemon essence. Nice moderate body, dry and astringent, a bit crisp for the style. A nice dunkelweisse. I would like to see some more banana and clove flavor but seems to be on track for the style. Got this out of their harvest 12 pack, can't we replace the cherry wheat with the Black Lager?"
"Bought as part of the new SA mixed 12 pack (good batch of beers I must say!). Pours a cloudy/murky brown color.. nice head to it that stays with the beer the whole time, nice lacing too. Sort of a toffee/nutty aroma to it. Taste is medium bodied, get a hint of the clove/banana hefe taste along with a nice malty taste. Nice smooth finish, pretty drinkable. Not overly tasteful but for the style I guess it fits the description pretty good. Maybe not something I would seek out but a nice change of pace in the mixed 12 pack."
"12oz bottle purchased at Shaw's as part of the new Samuel Adams Harvest mix-pack. Pours a hazy to murky copper brown body with over an inch of khaki-colored head. Smells nutty and banana notes and hints of spice and lemon-zest and pith. Toasty nuttiness hits first in the flavor, with hints of caramel and toffee, and suggestions of banana and spice. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Pretty darn drinkable. Not at all a bad example of the style - a welcome addition to the Samuel Adams fall line-up!"
"Light bodied and an easy drinker. Clean, malty/wheaty and crisp. One of the best dunkelweizens I've had. Some may not like it because there isn't a giant slug of yeast in the bottle. But me and my stomach are happy it isn't there."
"Overall, a decent offering from Sam Adams, although I was disappointed. The Michelob offering is a better value."
"A refreshing treat but I'm not a big fan of the style."
"Taste is smoky and excellent. Better than most American Hefeweizens and well worth the effort. Stands on its own and will hopefully move out of the mixed 12 pack."
"High drinkability though a bit more malt would be nice. Tasty Dunkelweizen though it is decidedly dry for the style."
"Overall, definitely worth picking up a 12 pack for (in my opinion anyway). If you like hefeweizens and dunkels like I do, be sure to grab this"
"SA hit a homerun with this one."
"I will admit that I have not had a lot of Dunkelweizens, so my tasting experience on the style is quite limited. But this is a decent tasting beer. Not going to knock your socks off, but is worth checking out as it is a solid effort from Sam Adams."
"I liked the smokieness to it but needed a bit more of it to really describe this brew. This needs to be added to the Brewmaster collection"
"Poured an extremely dark color when only held up to light, it would reveal a dim ruby hue. Nice dead that subdues after a while leaving minimal lacing. Smell is of roastiness like a stout with some lactose ala cream stout along with that banana-ry aroma. Beautiful aroma. Flavor also has that banana ester flavor up front ala Aventinus but also comes with a roastiness. This beer is like a cream/milk stout mixed with a dunkelweizen. Unlike anything I have ever tasted before and absolutely marvelous. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation and very smooth. Extremely drinkable. Wonder what the abv% is?"
"I am really impressed with this style. After searching out other traditional Dunkelweizens, I am unsure that Boston Beer version would show up a true German Dunkel, but it was a great representation of the style nonetheless. I hoped this would make the Beer Lovers choice to just to expose others to this wonderful style of beer."
"Another interesting Americanized version of a German style. Not the full Dunkelweizen that a Schneider-Weisse would be, but tasty and unique enough for me to cast my vote for it. Vote Sample B in '07!"
"I voted for the Dunkelweizen...however it is a shame both beers can not be added to the collection."
