I must have not been in the mood for a dark wheat, as the malt flavor seemed too much, and there was a bit of metallic ness to the flavor. A regular Hefe would have been preferred. I have had dark Hefe’s on tap in Munich, and they were to die for. But the Hacker Pschorr from the bottle did not do the trick.","iSip","Jun 05, 2012"

The middle and tail end see the flavors changing as fruit flavors come out more and more. Banana is the major fruit flavor but I feel that I am also picking up some pear?

Flavor is where it's at, though, with a complex palate-full of banana esters, spices like nutmeg and cinnamon, bready maltiness and molasses cookies or maybe ginger snaps. Flowery noble hops are moderate here but bitterness is just enough to balance everything together. Medium-full mouthfeel with all that suspended yeast and a bit sweet in the finish.

The flavor isn't bad, but it isn't great - it's crisp, somewhat lemony, but otherwise mostly wheaty again. It's quite full in the mouth, while all the carbonations hanging around, so it feels good.

Not that it's a terribly crafted beer but it tastes like Kroger Wheat Bread liquified into a weak cider and then thickened with whole milk.

The beer is very bready and yeasty, evident in the flavor and texture. Strong on the banannas and hints of bubblegum, then rounds out with a smooth dark malt flavor.

Pours a deep opaque reddish rusted metal color and makes a rocky offwhite head. I like the asymetrical head, always a curious feature to a brew. Aroma brings me to the yeast, oh so much yeast, powdery floral esters, light sweetness, odd hint of wheaty funkyness. Really interesting.. Flavor is a bit bready, and that yeast quality in the aroma comes back again, strong banana and strawberries, spicey cloves, not too shabby. Mouthfeel starts out creamy, but quickly turns into a peppered carbonation all over my mouth, light to medium body and an almost dry finish.

The 22 ounce glass was a feast for the eyes, the dark red color with ruby highlights, the full pinkish head. The nose was not left out of the equation as the slight fruitiness of the aroma shines through the malt backdrop. A slightly vinious flavor preceeded the malty sweet blast for flavor.

The smell is estery/bananas but is pretty mild. The taste is estery as well with kind of a dry yeasty flavor. The fruitiness of the esters gives it a refreshing quality. The mouthfeel could be better but overall not bad. I don't really notice a lack of good mouthfeel until I get about halfway through the beer. I tends to get a little watery about halfway through. I think overall it is a very drinkable beer. I would recommend trying this or any other of the Hacker-Pschorr brews. There is not a bad one that I have tried.","Brian700","Jun 06, 2005"

The carbonation coupled with an additional sugary spicyness makes this almost like a soda in drinkability, it goes down smooth but the fruitiness is a little too pronounced for me compared to others of this style.

It's medium bodied, slightly grainy and loaded with mild to faint flavors. Yeasty, and clovey with a bit of banana, coriander and orange zest.

3,-24.6,4,4,2.5,3,2.5,"I did not like this beer all that much as the flavor was a little off to me.  The appearance was nice with a hazy brown color and a good amount of head.  Odors of bananas and grains.  Flavor profile had some cloves, bananas and a dominant flavor that I could not identify but was not really keen on.  I will probably try another bottle from another store to see if it is better, but overall I was a bit disappointed.","jreitman","Jun 22, 2002"
3.71,-6.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Attractive beer, hazy clove-brown with a good 1 inch head that holds shapes well.  Sweet grainy smell, some roasted nuts.  Estery but also a little back of the mouth chocolate tone along with a little citrus.  Nice light body with full flavors.  I noticed that more sips bring out more lemon citrus, not an improvement, to me.  But, refreshing and drinkable.","ADR","Jun 20, 2002"
4.35,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Had this on tap.  Beautiful color.  Murky and muddy.  Copper/bronze tones.  Aroma consist of vanilla bean and banana.  Taste is very nice. The predominant taste that I pick up is vanilla.  There's a nice malt presence too. Hop notes are absent.  And some of the other typical weizen characteristics that are present include cloves, tartness and phenolic character.  Very nicely done.","Bighuge","May 19, 2002"
3.73,-6.3,4.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Nice, yeasty, fruity aroma.  Billowing white head.  Brown color.  Refreshing, and true to style.  An enjoyable, good beer.  This is a safe beer (and representative) to introduce friends to new beer styles.  Sometimes seems "light" with an unsatisfying finish, but still worthwhile.","Suds","May 17, 2002"

4.08,2.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Absolutely appetizing in appearance.  There's a tremendous, thick, creamy and persistent head that sits atop of a hazy brownish - orange brew.  The carbonation is high and serves to maintain the ample head and add to the effervesence as well. The classic German weizen yeast aroma dominates, and includes lots of banana, bubblegum, and just a touch of clove.  A slight hint of smooth, perhaps dehusked chocolate malt adds to the complexity.  The body is quite full, due to the high protein content from the wheat (I do feel that residual protein is more important than dextrins in body)  Hop bitterness and flavor is nearly nonexistant, but obviously must be there or this beer would be too sweet.  The brew finishes w/ Munich malt flavors and just a touch of sweetness.  This is a clean,  flavorful and drinkable Dunkel Weisse.  Tasty stuff.","marc77","Apr 05, 2002"
4.3,8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Not quite as dark as some other Dunkel Weizen beers but a pretty sight in the proper glassware none the less.  Cloudy brown appearance, maybe a notch or two darker than regular Schneider-Weisse. Definitely swirl the yeast in as part of this beer's experience. Nice pillowy tan head. Aroma is of multi-grain bread. Rich mouthfeel with caramel, clove and banana flavors.","John","Feb 18, 2002"
3.44,-13.6,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazed/cloudy- amber/peach color, generous frothy head, & sheet lace upon the glass. The aroma that I noticed first was that smoke smell, earthy grainy malt, the start is sweet, the middle is medium, as is the carbonation, & the finish is faintly hopped, dry, acidic & overall a pretty decent beer for the the type. I myself can do w/o it, mostly due to the aroma. There are many other Dunkle Weizens I much better perfer then this one.","WilliamPhilaPa","Feb 12, 2002"
4.9,23.1,5,5,5,4,5,"What a great beer.  Not as dark as other Weisse Dunkel's, but great flavor and smoothnes.  Creamy head, makes it look just wonderful","AaronRed","Nov 10, 2001"
4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"A nice effort.  A huge head, aided in part by the obligatory swirling of the yeast at the bottom with the last inch of the beer.  The typical banana/bubblegum weisse flavors and a slight caramel flavor to tell you it's a dunkel.  Is it my imagination or have Hacker-Pschorr beers gotten smoother in recent years?  I know their Oktoberfest has . . .","BKotch","Nov 05, 2001"
4.3,8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: A most extraordinary Weisse beer. For beer drinkers not accustomed to bottle conditioned beers such as this one, it is highly recommend pouring the entire bottle in the glass, including the yeast. The yeast is one of the best parts of this beer, as in it contributes most of the flavour to this beer.","BeerAdvocate","Oct 23, 2001"
