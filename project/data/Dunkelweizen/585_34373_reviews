"Always pleasure to drink Dunkelweizen with a good balance between drinkability and flavor complexity."
""
"Medium-light body, high soft carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Overall a flavorful but light dunkelweizen. Drinkable and pleasant."

"A pleasant beer & one that was easy to enjoy without really exciting. Not bad & quite refreshing but the hefeweizen version of this one is better."

"Had a pint on tap at an Edmonton, Alberta area pub (Spruce Grove to be specific). After being pleasantly surprised by this brewery's weissbier offering (see that review), I had fairly high expectations for this one. Certainly this was technically proficient and nothing was obviously wrong, a brown-red wood color with ample fizz and an inch or so of beige quick-breaking head. Aroma features the expected banana and clove elements along with some caramel and faint chocolate. Body is much like that of a lighter macro-brewed weiss, on the thin side and featuring an apple-like fruity ""young beer"" flavor along with some brown sugar, raisin and clove. Banana is low level, at least to my palate. A little sour and quite crisp. Not as complex as its lighter stablemate but pleasant enough I suppose. I have enjoyed less fruity and more malty examples of the style but makes a decent enough patio brew when in the mood for something a touch darker. Not particularly sweet and maybe a little bland. Was hoping for something more robust."

"Overall a solid dark hefeweizen, a tasty pairing for my plate of jaegerschnitzel and spaetzle."

"O: Delicious, love this Dunkelweissen. Not usually a fan of these, but I am of this one. Could see it going well with cheesecake."
"A slight Amber hew. Mostly sweet with a thick mouth feel. The banana flavors of the yeast dominate the palate and not much else is going on here. I did finish my growler but I wouldn't buy it again. There are lots of better Weisse beers out there. The quest continues...."

"Compared to the regular Maisel Weisse this is a bit of a letdown. The mouthfeel is fairly thin and the flavours are more subdued than I expected. Not a bad dunkel but this brewer is known to be top shelf in wheat beers so a bit of a drop in expectations."

"D - An all around solid beer, and something I hope to have again. Definitely a step behind Maisel's Weisse Original, but still a tasty and damn drinkable brew."
"Overall: Weak offering. I'd rather have their standard weisse, as this just had sooo little going on that it was instantly forgettable."
"Comes out of the tap a dark, nearly opaque chocolaty brown with a fine-bubbled light tan head. Tempting malty aroma has hints of chocolate and caramel. Flavor - such flavor! Malty mainly, plus caramel, horehound, earthy and yeasty notes. Texture is fairly smooth with a sharp yeasty undertone and hints of fruit, not a lot of fizz. Definitely worthy of at least a sample."
""
"Overall: A fairly ok beer. My only REAL problem was the mouthfeel which was very weak. As for everything else, it was ok but nothing spectacular. It has whetted my appetite for more dunkels though."
"O- This is a fine beer, and this might be the one to get me really into Dunkels! It's definitely easy enough to drink, and the flavor, along with the mouthfeel, gives this enough character to make me want to have more than one of these in a sitting. This beer would go well with a roast beef dinner or perhaps with a chocolate cake for dessert. Thumbs up!"

"not up there with the better examples of the style but still nothing too be ashamed of"
"Taste is so-so. Again there's potential, but nothing jumps out and the mineral water AND an overall watery feel make this an average offering in the Dunkel Department"
"A deftly easy to drink dark wheat beer, enjoyably straight forward, but hardly plain. The expected yeast and spice are notably understated, and that's ok, as everything else is quite agreeable. I could very much see ordering this a few times over in any rustic Germanic pub whose doorway I might darken."

"Overall Very nice and drinkable dark wheat beer"
"Dr: Cheap enough in Germany, but far from amazing. It slides down easily enough, and is of normal ABV."
"Flavour is on the clovey side with slight banana noted that linger. Light carbonation and high drinkability make this a winner as fair as I'm concerned. I like the balance in this. One of the nicer Dunkelweizens I've tried."
"Pours dark copper with a small (for a weizen) head. Nose shows bready wheat, milk chocolate, banana, and oatmeal. Very nice. Similar flavours (minus the banana) but not as complex. Low bitterness but a lasting toasty finish. Somewhat watery, carbonation is nice and high."
"I truly love this style, possibly more than the regular hefeweizen. A solid example that falls short of the benchmark (Weihenstephan) but is still a very good beer that I thoroughly enjoyed drinking."
"OVERALL: Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Certainly a dunkel I could drink all day. The finish was a little odd, different to what I'm used to when it comes to various sorts of German weizen, but that's not a bad thing. I'd go for seconds, and thirds."
"Overall - An excellent Dunkel... definitely recommended..."
"M&D: the fluffy mouthfeel upfront leads towards a medium-bodied mid-taste, although the finishing touch is a little more spritzy than necessary. All in all, this dunkel weizen is very decent in quality, showing a balanced profile b/w fruit-esters and wheat+malts. Although this is not my favourite type of ale, I won't hesitate tasting it again (but preferably on draught!)."
"Overall: Not very impressive. Average wheat beer. I was expecting more from a dunkel weizen. I prefer the original Maisel's Weisse."
"Body is medium and the beer is slightly sweet. Aftertaste is dry and drinkability is OK. To me this tastes like the normal Weisse, but with the dark malt pushing away the fruity notes, the Weisse has."
"Poured a tall, dense, foamy light brown head was so solid it looked like I could scoop it out like ice cream. Deep cola colored beer with a hazy chestnut hue. Moderately strong aroma is dominated by banana and bubble gum esters. Mouthfeel is light a fluffy. Not a whole lot of flavor up front except for a faint astringency. Mild banana yeast flavors and some cocoa mix towards the finish. The aroma hinted at some nice flavors, but they never materialized. A tad watery and boring. Nothing wrong per se, but there are better Dunkels."
