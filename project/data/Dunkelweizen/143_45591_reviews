"The Worst beer Ever! Taste like Parmesan cheese. AWFUL"
""
""
""
"12 oz can part of a six pack from Winco mega grocer in Salem. $7.29 I have no idea how this got here..but lets try it out! Pours a very attractive darker amber with garnet hints. And a lovely smooth creamy tan head. Can get peaches right enough in the aroma. They tend to dominate. Only later do the nuts and caramel arrive. Taste is rather thinner than expected..but its nice enough..again getting lot of peach, some spicy peppery stuff and a bit of nuttiness. Fine. KInda thin mouth feel but its got nice tight carbonation..that helps. Nice fruity beer"
"The first time I had this beer in 2010 it was amazing. When it is bottled or canned it just doesn't taste anything like the draft version. If you can get in tap go for it. If not, just skip it."
""
"Seasonal brew that you better get early. San Antonio favorite crisp taste and very refreshing. Many whine lovers enjoy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a good combo one and done"
""
"Can.  Murky brown amber with off white head.  Smell is sweet and on thick side.  Taste follows.  Don't really get peaches or pecans.   Just sweet bordering syrupy.  Have tried this twice and couldn't finish either."
"Got the beer because it was on sale at my local store. Not bad but I'd never buy it for its original price. Really not worth it."
"A friend from work gave me a couple of these beers. I like several Spoetzl products, but was skeptical of this one. I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth and tasty this beer was. This would be great anytime, not just the holidays."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Strong, malty aroma has a firm overtone of peach, sweet and tempting but not too sweet. Got a nutty hint, no doubt from the pecans. Pours a clear sienna with a fairly thick buff head. Peach dominates the flavor, but does not overwhelm the malty, nutty, earthy and hoppy notes - hop bitterness nicely balances the sweetness from the peaches. Texture has average body and plenty of lively fizz. Anytime is the season for good beer!"
"There's just something about it.."
"If you're a fan of peach and pecan you'll be very happy. I'm not so I didn't care for this."
""
""
""
"Great light peach flavor with mild pale ale bit"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It smells and tastes like peaches. Way too sweet and syrupy for my tastes."
"Sweet to taste. Not bad. As seen before you don't want to drink too many. Too much peach"
""
""
""
"Way to sweet tasting. Very sugary."
"O good holiday brew, very cheery and flavorful"
""
""
""
"Great peach taste, but you can't drink too many."
"Getting rid if the holiday brew."
""
""
""
"Not bad, Interesting peach taste"
""
""
""
"O: Definitely interesting and different for a winter brew and dunkelweizen, but a good iteration if you want just that. The peach and pecan certainly mark the brew, which is a good thing (for the sake of being different). Worth seeking out, which isn't easily said for any other Shiner beer"
""
"Was very sweet, even for a dunkel. First beer in months i've had to give away."
""
"Perfect color great taste really enjoyed it should be rated higher"
"Nice winter option. Good alternative to the typical dark Winter Warmers."
"Had this on draft. Fruity aroma. Smooth and very drinkable, with a hint of peach. Although this is a seasonal I could drink it in the summer."
"Beer advocate made me do this"
"I don't like fruity beer. But this stuff is different. I like this."
"A cheerful beer at the end of the year."

"Medium Amber, fragrant head fades quickly to a small swirl, smell of peach and primary taste of pecan over a medium sweet malt base.  A nice holiday beer!"
""
""
""
"Brownish-copper with golden edges. The peaches come through in the nose and flavor profile too. The finish was tart and dry and was accompanied by an odd aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - different and not bad but I doubt I would buy a sixer or a pint. Cheers."
""
""
"Perfect after a long day of work or holiday prep!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, if you’re into the peach flavor it’s a decent beer, otherwise it’s just mediocre at best."
""
""
""
"Pours with a medium-sized, white head. Had a very dark amber color. Has an aroma of wheat and peaches.   The taste is a mixture of flavors. Initial one is peach and wheat. After taste is of malts and roasted pecans with a slight bitterness caused from the malted barley. A great balance is created between all the flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Although it's meant as a holiday drink, I can imagine drinking it in the summer also.  The fruitiness is not too sweet.  I can discern the caramel or dark wheat but not so much the nutty flavors in the description.  Strong aftertaste on the tongue.  The texture is like a light beer with a hint of bubbles.  Easy to enjoy."
"I liked this beer a lot.  Good peach flavor that seems to be missing in most peach beers.  The brownish color caught me by surprise.  Head did not last and no lacing to speak of.  Smell is pure peach.  The taste is peach on the front and a sweet nutty taste on the back.  Smooth, easy drinking beer.  Pleasantly surprised with this offering from  Shiner.  My favorite from this brewery to date."
""
"Outlier detected. Please enter a review."
"Canned peaches, hint of pecans, hint of malt VERY SLIGHT hop bite on the back end.. Just TO MUCH peach for me."
""
""
"With a deep crystal clear garnet hue supporting a beige creamy head this beer has a strong perfumy peach aroma that comes though more on the exhale.  The flavor has a crisp light roasted bitter note and some soft nutty notes to follow.  The dry peach note in the finish is a bit artificial.  This is a mellow soft flavored beer but the peach flavor is a bit odd and dominates the flavor."
"This old-world style brew actually pained me physically to drink. One of the few beers I've ever had to pour out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid twist on a Dunkel. Really nice peach flavor that is sweet but far from cloying."
""
""
"I don't taste much difference between this and their regular flagship brew, and that's pretty okay with me. They're both solid beers and this one fits in line with many holiday beers in that it's safe; it's not going to knock your socks off, but it's not bad at all."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet and full of peaches. Taste is peaches, sweet, a bit of grains, not what I expected from this style, but not bad. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."

"Overall: extremely good as far as flavored/fruit beers go. The first pecan beer I can recall having where I can actually taste the pecan flavor. Well done Shiner!"
""
""
"I had this poured into a pint glass, my first review of a Shiner offering. The color is nice and inviting, a warm copper brown. The taste..well it's super fruity. Like very fruity. I like dunkelweizens in general, but this might have been a bit too much peach. I could have one of these around the holidays each year, but probably not more than that."
"I love it in a black & tan>"

"Interesting taste, with a fruity zing. Had to read about it here to figure out the fruit was peach, underlaid with pecans. The comparison to fruitcake is apt, but in a good way: doesn't taste stale or dull by any means. Enjoyed it very much last night as a complement to Texas bar-b-q at ""The County Line on the Lake"" in Austin."

"O (4) – I’d been wanting to try this one, but didn’t want to commit myself to an entire 6 pack.  I was actually much more pleased than I thought I’d be.  I’m not going to run out and by the six pack, but I’m not mad that I bought this at the restaurant.  I would consider drinking it again."

"Flavors are toasted malt, dark chocolate, and light cherry--peaches come out as it warms.  This one is a nice malty holiday treat.  Not traditional for the style, but a good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a weird beer that I wouldn't want a six pack of."
""
"Sweet with the perfect amount of dry bitterness I love. You can taste the pecans, not so much the peaches. I love almost all of the shiner offerings, but yet will tell hold nothing back just cause I'm from Texas. I feel like it could use just a little move uph but that's just me.but over all a decent beer for 10 a sixxer."

"Perfect beer for a holiday meal. Though the peaches and pecans cone through, they are subtle and well balanced."

"Anyway, get this in cans if available, and enjoy!  Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Nice and fruity without being overly fruity and cloying. A little thin throughout, but I was actually pleased.  Don't think of spruce and cinnamon."

"A shiner beer I really like. The pour was a straw yellow with a good head. The smell had peach and pecan but also what smelled like Belgian wheat which gives off a banana scent. The taste was nice with heavy notes such as bread and pecans in the beginning and mellowing out with the semi-sweet peach coming through on the finish. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer. ""Brewed with pecans, peaches, natural flavor and caramel color"". Aroma is of faint peach and malty sweetness. Flavor has the malty taste and a hint of fresh peaches. Decent mouthfeel. Goes down well and leaves a little pecan flavor at the end. Getting a little of that weird dry feeling that you sometimes get when eating fresh pecans, maybe its just me. Overall, pretty well balanced and a nice change from the overly dry spiced beers that are abundant around the holidays !"
"Overall: I was slightly hesitant to try a cheer beer, but after tasting it, it opened up a whole new range of possibilities in the future. In other words, I was pleasantly surprised, and I would recommend. I drank this beer after a cold night run while I was taking a hot shower. There's not many better feelings than that."

"O- The descriptions of this beer sounded very intriguing, but the peach flavor is a bit cloying and very artificial tasting.  The pecan flavor was very subtle and pleasant.  It is certainly a one-of-a-kind beer for the season that lacks the usual holiday spices, but still manages to evoke the season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's unique, and you've got to give them credit for originality. Additionally, I feel all of the components work together, and stand out at least a little bit on their own. It's balanced by a firm bitterness, and it's pretty nicely polished. It's certainly worth trying!"
""
""
""
"O : I'd have it again, but i probably wouldn't buy it again. Nice change of pace. 3.41/5."
""
""

""
""
"I was prepared to be disappointed, since their bock, the only other Shiner beer I've had, is a poor example of that style. But I was pleasantly surprised with this one. And, for the price, (a little more than 2 dollars for a 24 oz bottle), it is one of the tastiest beers I've had. After guzzling this one, I'm going back for more."
""
""
"Love the fruity notes of this beer."
""
"Always look forward to this coming out.  First time I tried it, I was kind of like no not really, but once I got it on tap it changed my mind.  If you get it in a bottle find something to pour it in as it improves as it breaths.  The peach and pecan are right there in your face.  Best experience with this beer was on a rooftop bar when it was snowing :)"

"The Shiner Holiday Cheer was a good seasonal beer. I do not remember everything about this beer. It has been so long since I have had it, but from what I do remember it was that too strong, or too light. For a seasonal beer it was actually really good. Also the taste of this beer was not really all that bad actually."

""

"A weird and sweet beer. This is more like a dessert drink. After a big holiday meal this beer should just about seal the deal, so-to-speak, on your slumber. Take a big swig of this whilst downing copious amounts of Aunt Bessie's Triple Decker Cinnamon Plum Pudding. It will be a great compliment."

"Pours a dark reddish-amber in color with a 1+-finger off-white foamy head that settles down quickly. Some spotty lacing is seen. This is 'brewed with peaches and pecans and with natural flavor and caramel color'. Love the aroma when first opened and poured as the peaches and caramel hits the nose. Nice taste of peaches with wheat flavor with spices that goes down easy. Slight sweet aftertaste that isn't bitter. One of the better Shiner's in my opinion."
"Pours a clear dark ruby amber with a well formed head that laces well. Said lacing lasts only a few minutes, however. Nose is of peach over a slight caramel. Light bodied with a thin mouthfeel. Slightly above normal carbonation level. The flavor profile is not complex. Like the nose, it is peach predominating over a light caramel. The beginning is a nice peach which effervesces into an ending that has pecan, but you have to really search for it. The finish is a lingering taste of peach that is OK, at best."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Eh its ok, neat idea, poorly executed."
"Overall / I gave it a 2.75 on this as I am not a big fan of fruit flavored beer not because it is a bad brew. I am sure that the brewer achieved what he was going after. Overall I think it fits into it's style but I would rather have a beer that has more beer flavors than fruits. That is just my preference."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 1/25/2014. Pours almost crystal clear deep ruby brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big peach, caramel, toffee, brown bread, wheat, floral, light banana, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with big peach presence and moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big peach, banana, caramel, toffee, brown bread, wheat, clove, pepper, floral, light nuttiness, and herbal earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, banana, caramel, toffee, brown bread, wheat, clove, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of peach, yeast, and malt flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice fruited dunkelweizen. Good balance and robustness of fruit, malt, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"Not what I was expecting, but I enjoyed this beer. I may have overrated it a bit, but I would have it again for sure."
""
"Not horrible, but we wouldn't order it again."
""
""
"The flavor is unique and delicious. Peaches... Big peach taste. You can some what taste the pecans in it and a little spice of some sort. It definitely screams Christmas. Unfortunately is is a seasonal, but if you see a 6 pack in the store during the holidays, it is a must to try with friends of family."
""
""
""
"Shiner created a nice, easy drinking holiday ale. The peach and pecan nuttiness are noticeable but not overpowering. Good complexity and balance with a unique and enjoyable flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oh well. A good enough ale with a soft and smooth feel."
""

"Pours to a nice buff head and clear brown color. Aroma is peachy, nutty malty and grainy. No hops detected. Flavor is bold and complex with bitter pecan, peach and sweet grain notes. Mouthfeel is medium and pleasingly sticky. A good hearty winter brew that is askew but tasty."
""
""
""
""
"one of those beers i have passed over about a million times without realizing what i was missing. this is a particularly unique brew, a wheat beer that features both pecans and peaches, a refreshing and tasty rewrite of holiday beer. huge peach nose is very authentic, not real nutty, but fresh and juicy in front of medium toasted wheat malt. i really like the subtle spice flavor with the sweet peach, its like real good iced tea from the south. could maybe use a little more hops to soften the sugar, but i like how different this is. the pecans add an earthy richness which is nice with the grain, and the beer is robustly carbonated and lively on the palate. this beer deserves more credit, its one of a kind and among the very best ive had from shiner. worthy of any holiday feast, i may make this a tradition."
""
""
"This is light-medium bodied. It starts going down rather quickly, but the carbonation seems to create some drag when it hits the back of the tongue. Overall it's a pleasant effect, as it helps keep it around longer for the flavor."

""
""
""

"O: It's a shame about its lack of balance, because I enjoy the fruity flavors of this. Wasn't a fan of this one, frankly. On the plus side, I can see this appealing to other drinkers."
""
""
"Overall a nice light peach dunkel that might be better during the warmer months, but surely enjoyed more than expected. Would have been nice to get more pecans though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma. This, as with the mouthfeel, enhanced with each further degree that the liquid warmed. We were then better able to appreciate the nuances of the fruity inclusions, and the inherent spiciness of the grain bill. These lent to each other well, for a balanced, blended experience. We felt much the same way about the flavoring, with fair representation from each corner. This is really what being a Christmas beer should be all about, with richness, depth, warmth, and a touch of fun. All of this, actually, might make it harder for one to indulge all by themselves, as at points we wished we had smaller pours, but that just lends itself to the spirit of the holiday, so go find someone to share this tasty beer with."
""
"Overall: Not bad, i would drink this again."
""
"I appreciate that this beer had such wonderful patience in waiting for me to get around to drinking it. The pour began to foam up pretty quickly, so I backed off and let the pseudo-cascade do its thing before settling into two fingers of dense, light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with mahogany highlights (SRM = > 22, < 27) and NE-quality clarity. Man, but the nose was just redolent with peaches! Peachy keen, I say. I may run out and get a Tastykake Peach Pie after this. Mouthfeel was soft, kind of full and creamy and the taste was heavy on the peaches, but with a nuttiness, also. Finish was fruity, nutty, semi-sweet, but not over the top. Man, I could drink this year-'round!"
"Thankfully, the alcohol was low and hardly detectable and I could have had a few more in a sitting had I bought more than one bottle. The roasted nuttiness wasn't as strong as I would have liked but had it been, this would have felt like a Brown Ale. As it was, this was enjoyable on its own even though it paled in comparison to its more highly-rated European counterparts. Some may feel like this is a lighter version of the Shiner Bock but for the holidays, this would be a good choice as a lighter alternative to what's currently on the shelf."

"Shiner Holiday Cheer ---3.5/5"

"A dunkelweizen??? I get no wheat notes and only a very mild yeastiness that MIGHT be German. Nope. Call it a fruit beer and we'll talk."

"Overall I thought this beer was just ok and I didn't think it was a good example of a Dunkelweizen since none of the aspects that I look for in the style came through, if they were there they were pretty much covered up by the creamy peach flavors and with how much the peach flavors stick out I think this would be better classified as a Fruit Beer. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth and not filling, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and I think one is enough for me, I don't really have the urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, I thought they were both nice and worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the how dominating the creamy peach flavors were, they weren't bad, but I thought they were too overpowering. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't seek it out and I don't think I would really recommend it unless you really like Peach flavored beers. All in all I was a little let down with this beer, Shiner is usually pretty solid, but this beer seemed a little too unbalanced and artificial for my taste. Better luck next time guys, this one could use a little bit of work."
""
""
"O: This seems to taste more like a Fruit/Vegetable Beer than a Dunkelweizen. It's an interesting Texan take on a holiday beer and is a lot easier to drink than some of the other holiday beers in the heavier styles such as winter warmers. There seemed to be a good balance between the peaches and pecans/spices because the beer wasn't overly sweet."
""
""
""
"O: On paper the peach & pecan combo should work quite well but in practice it tastes candied and the sweetness is out of balance"
""
"Pours a dark reddish amber with a thin finger head that fades quickly with a decent amount of lacing. Gives off the aroma of beets or grapes. It's very sweet to the tongue. The taste is very similar to the smell, grapy with a hint of beets and citrus. The flavor doesn't last long however and you're not left with much of an aftertaste. But it's worth a try. I would certainly recommend it to a friend."

"I enjoyed it and could detect no alcohol in the taste. Never did taste any wheat presence either."
"Bought a six pack and poured into a glass. Not much head. Pours a nice reddish orange and the smell is fantastic. Great ""natural flavored"" peach smell. But when it comes to the taste there is not much peach or pecan taste at all. Tastes like a regular semi dark beer. I'm very disappointed in the taste. Not sure how a peach/pecan inspired beer has anything to do with Christmas. I think this would better be marketed as a summer type beer with the peach thing. Anyways if you like the smell of peaches this thing delivers. If you are looking for a peach and pecan tasting beer forget this one. I'm a big fan of Shiner beer but this is disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The perfect Christmas beer. The flavors of pecans and peaches are subtle and not over powering like that crap made with water from Lake Michigan. This is a truly sessionable Christmas beer. There is no need to put anything girly around the rim of the glass to kill the taste, it is great on it's own. I am drinking it right now!"
""
""
""
""
"This would be much better with the more of the banana taste of a decent dunkel weizen to go along with the peach sweetness."
"O - 3.75 - Good beer. Unique in it's own way."

""

"Actually works out better than i thought it would. Almost like a dunkel meets a roasty toasty english brown meets a fruit beer. Sweet peach juice up front rolls into other dark fruits along the mid-palate and some weizen flare, creamy body but not too heavy, prickly carbonation. Just enough bitterness on the back end with a big roasted malt and toasted bread flavor to balance the sweetness. Toasty flavors linger on the palate. It does finish a little soapy however with what feels like a bit of alcohol heat which is strange for such a flavorful beer at a low abv. but overall it is definitely something different for the holidays. I wouldn't call it a dunkelweizen however it is a very unique take on a fruit beer that combines some other interesting traits from other styles. Something you can have a few of with a unique flavor."
""
"A simply unique seasonal Christmas beer! Living in NE Ohio we are fortunate enough to enjoy Great Lakes Christmas Ale and Thirsty Dog's 12 Dogs of Christmas. However, Shiner Cheer from Texas has become our favorite Holiday beer surpassing all the fantastic beers we are able to enjoy in Ohio. Additionally, the branding and color permutation of the label may be the best out there. So cool and so glad this beer has arrived!"

"Pours dark red with finger width foamy head.  Head retention is decent with very little to no lacing.  Very fruity aroma.  No hops.  Peaches and pecans predominate.  Very sweet but good.  Darker malty taste followed by a mild pecan flavor with a sweet peach taste at the end.  Sweet, peachy aftertaste.  Wish there was just a little more hops to this.  For a sweeter beer, it is actually tasty and would go well with dessert."

"Pours a clear dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, peaches, and a slight nutty aroma. Taste is much the same with peach and apricot flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is fairly interesting with the peach and pecan combo going on."

"O- This is an incredibly unique and funky take on a Christmas beer, or even a dunklewizen in general. Indeed, this is the most unique dunkleweizen I have ever had. Maybe it's a ""Texas"" thing, but nothing about this beer really says ""Christmas"" to me. For this reason I find it funny when people tell me that this beer is a bad ""winter warmer"". OF course it's a bad winter warmer, because it's NOT ONE. The disappointing thing about this beer is that it is really not sessionalbe (at least for me). This is more of a 1 and done kind of beer which is really unfitting considering how low of an ABV it has. Still, kudos on your creativity shiner and making a beer that slightly stands out from the rest during the holiday season."

"Overall: This is the second beer ive had that has been brewed with pecans, personally it doesn't seem to me to have a strong enough flavor to come through in the beer. I got this brew in a gift basket so i was happy to try it, however i won't be buying this in a 6-pack."

"At the very least, this one sounds interesting. Shiner Cheer pours out a red color with a decent head. The aroma comes strong with the peaches. The taste comes really hard with the peaches too. There's a bit of nuttiness and just a tiny amount of spices on the finish, but otherwise this is a one-note peach fest. Unique enough and pretty tasty. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and lightly carbonated. Overall, Shiner Cheer is a solid and unique winter beer. However, stay far, far away if the idea of a primarily peach flavored beer doesn't tickle your fancy."
""
""
""
"O: What a let down. The nose was good but lacked in taste completely. All that comes to mind is a cheap replica of a great beer style. I won't be cheering next year."
""
"OVERALL: A decent holiday beer, with a major peach influence. The flavor is genuine and everything more or less works. A bit light and confused, but still quite drinkable."

"This poured out as a clear reddish brown color with an off white head on top. The retention is thin and there isn't any lacing. The smell of the beer to me was really impressive. I poured out and was overwhelmed by the peach in it. The smell is sweet like candy and won't appeal to most beer lovers out there. The taste is also sweet, again with peaches I wish the nuts came out a little more. The mouthfeel is very drinkable and easy going. Not bitter at all or cloying. Overall despite it's ""artificial"" aromas and flavors that it more than likely has... it's still a really good tasting beer in my opinion. I would prefer it if it wasn't artificial at all and all natural but either way I enjoy this beer. I feel it's a bit too clear to be a traditional Dunkelweizen as well. All in all I would drink this beer again though."
"Sidenote: The beer definitely improves as it warms. The flavor profile gains in nuts and maltiness which does a better job of balancing the peach tartness."
""
""
""
"Clear mahogany pour with one finger head that fades quickly with minimal lacing. Nutty, fruity nose with subtle hints of peaches along with brown sugar, and caramel. Taste is dominated by the sweet malt with hints of peaches, toffee, and maple syrup. The mouthfeel is syrupy and sickly sweet. The description of this beer sounded interesting, but Shiner definitely didn't pull it off. Way too sweet for my tastes."
"Mouthfeel is probably about right, but overall I feel like Shiner is just doing a bit with this and I can't take it seriously."
""
""
""
"This beer tastes 10x better on tap than bottle. The bottle taste reminds me of sour milk on the after taste. Have you ever tasted your own ear wax? Well after drinking this you might be able to recall that. Now, why I say ear wax??...well I tasted my ear wax numerous times out of curiosity. I wouldn't buy this beer. I'd rather bum off someone else."
""

"O: Not my cup of tea. Too much like drinking a candy."

"This seems to be more of a fruit beer. The peaches are nice though. The wheat shows on the fell more than the flavor. This could be a great summertime beer as well."
"An interesting holiday beer. It was worth trying, but probably not one I will revisit."
"A must try if you like peach flavored beers. An interesting diversion, and one of the better Shiner beers that I've had."

"Overall – While a little too fruity and sweet for the style, it was actually a very tasty brew. Easy to drink and one to go to from time to time."
""
""
""
""
"O: The addition of peaches to a holiday beer is an interesting but completely successful...it leaves the beer a little too sweet, especially in the smell. It goes down pretty easily but I don't think I would want to drink more than one of these in a session."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I'm having a difficult time describing the very distinctive, non-beer flavor. Maybe it's just the 'holiday' in the title, but it does have a yuletide feel."
""

"I think this one should be in the Fruit/Vegetable category. If this is a Dunkelweizen, it's well disguised. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Pinkie's in San Angelo."

"Taste is toasted bread, faintly caramelized, plus light woody-peppery bitterness, hint of nuttiness. Peach is noticeable but barely so, being very faint (unlike in the aroma). Finish has light nutty caramelised toasted bread. Overall, it is fairly dry, balanced. It is good, enjoyable, and solid. It’s a little different, too, and in a way that works well. Feel is light but not watery."

"I have a Texas license, but I'm not a Texan. Maybe that explains why I don't love Shiner. It's better than the standard AAL... and this is completely unique and better than the Bock... but Shiner still isn't great in my book."

"O - I was monumentally surprised at the changes in SHC for '11. It was a delight. It was impressive and will replace all other cozy, holiday beverages in my household."
"Overall - This is my first time trying this style of beer, I like it. It's a lot different from other styles. I wouldn't be able to drink a lot of this though because it's so sweet.."
""

"O: Not what I enjoy in a holiday beer, but a good novelty beer for non-craft beer drinkers."
""
""

"O-I was throughly impressed by this beer. I really enjoyed the peach flavor along w/ the other flavor combinations. When I had this on tap...they rimmed the glass w/ brown sugar and cinnamon...fantastic...I copied this at home as well on a couple bottles. One of my favorite, shockingly, holiday releases."
"This is a unique brew. I would not have expected it for a ""holiday"" brew - maybe it's ""southern-style"" though. And, it's certainly not typical for a dunkelweizen. Anyway, it's a nice ""change of pace"" brew with a refreshing peach and pecan character."
"12 oz bottle into a 9 oz glass. Pours a dark red with a small head that dissipates quickly, but lacing remains. Smell of peaches is dominant but is very appealing. Peaches also dominate the taste, but not overly powerful that it will offend. Goes down really smooth and leaves no real bad aftertaste. Overall, a good holiday beer that can be a session beer."
""
""
""

"Overall, although this beer is light and drinkable, the gimmicky, candy-sweet fruitiness is not something to come back to."

"D: This had an unusual scent and taste for a holiday beer, but it was clean and enjoyable. The peach character didn't mix with the copper taste too well, and the pecan wasn't very noticeable, but it was still easy to drink. Not a bad beer, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O= Overall, It's not that bad but I would basically buy it for a holiday party where not a lot of people are craft beer drinkers because this beer isn't that intense. I would rather have a Sierra Nevada's Celebration in the fridge for a holiday type beer."
""
"This is a nice twist on a the winter beer. Rather than some heavy, rich, spiced beer, Shiner made a delicious, sweet, almost dessert-like beer. This is a welcomed change of pace."

"O: Though I dont care for Spoetzl's beers, I ususally tend to enjoy their seasonal beers, but this one really let me down. I dont get the whole peach in winter thing. Just doesnt make sense to me."
""
""
""
""
"O: really nice aroma, not sure how they pulled off the peach but I'm impressed. Not really getting the dunkelweizen character, but for what it is, it's tasty"
""

"o: this is one of the better holiday beers i've had. good flavors and aromas blend well together."
"Overall:	I thought this was great holiday beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a sad letdown as to what I hoped it would be the name sounded festive and like haveing a good time, but sadly that was not the case here."
""
"O: At first, I absolutely hated it. The aftertaste is definitely peaches, and that isn't a terrible thing. As a recommendation, I'd say you have to have it once."
""
""
""
"If find the aroma of this beer the best part, and better than the flavor, but I like it overall. It's a refreshing break from the more heavy and spiced winter ales."
"O: Eh, smells way to sweet and tastes almost as sweet. I guess this is good for holiday parties...or something. I won't compare to the Scuttlebutt since they were less similar than I had hoped they would be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a great specialty beer. I wouldn't have this every night, but definately in the winter."
"Overall it's not something I would drink all the time, but one season out of the year I think this is a pretty decent beer. Also, it has all the qualities that it professes on the label. You get exactly what you're promised and it's worth including in your winter beer lineup."
""
"Is this a gateway beer for macrolager drinkers, as some have suggested? Only if they really want to drink artificially sweet, candy flavored beer that mocks its supposed progenitor. I don't need a beer with ""natural flavors added"" or ""caramel color added," and this one has both. Essentially cloying, no need to revisit."
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: I don't think the peaches are overdone here at all. After reading some other reviews, that's what I was expecting. If anything, this dunkel is a bit tame and thin. Still an enjoyable beer though. By far the best I've had from this brewery."
""
"Overall: The drinkability it high for the newbie, it's be a good introductory beer for those just starting to branch away from the generic flavors of american standards. It's a great Monday after work beer."
""
""
"The taste is quite sensual as well, but not something I would enjoy AT ALL if a beer is what I craved. It doesn't have any kind of satisfying beer character. It is a fruit flavoured beer. It should not be considered a dunkelweizen at all even if that is what the base ale is. Shiner doesn't mislabel it as they explicitly state that it is brewed with peaches and pecans. It has a very light character and high carbonation, with ripe fruit really being the dominant character. The aftertaste is a bit odd. Very dry, but not entirely unpleasant. This is a fantastic beverage if you are in the mood for something fruity and not for a traditional beer. I can't say that enough. Good stuff, though."
"O - Compared to other American wheat beers and/or fruit beers I find this one to be average but I will be the first to admit that this is not my style. If Spoetzl had marked this beer as Dark American Wheat I still wouldn't like it but I would be forced to give it slightly higher marks. As it stands, the ""Old World Dunkelweizen"" on the box is an outright lie."

"O- Who likes peaches? If you're looking for a peach soda clone this is probably your best bet."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is a nice clear dark copper color with a slight hint of ruby red. A cream colored head dissipates to an even film. Sticky, watery lacing. The beer smells tremendous, because you can really smell peaches here. Again, peaches dominate, but it's got enough of a caramel malt presence to help, sort of. It's overbearingly sweet, and peachy. The mouthfeel is smooth, perhaps a tad watery. Overall, this is a weird one. It's just too sweet! And peachy! I don't equate peaches with Holiday Cheer in any way, but I do realize this beer is a regional thing. It's fun to have one, but a 6 pack? yikes."
""
"It sounds weird to say, but everything about this beer was good except the flavor. In fact, I ha to pour it out after I drank about 3/4 of the bottle. And I hate to do that, but there's other way better beer in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
"Even though its not a traditional Christmas ale (in my eyes) it is a very unique and delicious change. Add some cinnamon/cardamom and nutmeg and this guy would be perfect."
""

"I often enjoy Shiner Bock because it's pretty cheap and widely available, though I enjoyed this more and could definitely enjoy this in the future."
""
""
"The body should be thicker and the watery taste spoiled it. The peach smell and flavor was worked in really well, but the rest of the beer could not hold itself up."
"Overall: this is a decent winter beer, if one you've got to be in the mood for. I wouldn't want to drink too many of these, but having one amid some winter warmers would not be amiss."
"O: Well, it's okay. I would suggest to a novice to craft."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark copper that was translucent and very filtered. The ivory white head was robust and consistent, fading to a small sudsy layer. First smells are overwhelmingly peach. It definitely has some carbonation to it. I'm not sensing pecans but after the peach fleets there is a slight maltiness. As the beer is consumed, the head is very uneven and looks quite unusual. Appears to be continents drifting apart as seen from the space shuttle (I know.. crazy). It finishes up with a slight cream mouthfeel. This is the first beer in awhile that I actually really don't care for. The tastes are not robust. The taste is overwhelmed by peach. Not sure how peaches even play into the winter holidays. Unfortunately I have 5 left."
""
""
""
""
"O - Fun holiday beer that really captures the style while taking a little holiday zig, or zag."
"Prosit!"
"O - This is not a bad beer, some would probably like to see more spiciness or malts, I like the finish being somewhat dry, the peaches aren't overpowering."
"Overall-Interesting take on a Dunkleweizen and one of the better beers by Spoetzl brewery if I had to pick one. Not going out of my way to get this but I'll be drinking more tonight, considering they serve it across the street from me for 1.50 pints during the Alabama/LSU game tonight."
"Interesting but not something I'd drink more than a sixer of during the holidays. Still, it's not bad."
"Nice amber color in appearance. The mouthfeel very exceptional, if all the wheat beers had this we would be big fans. There is a nice hint of peaches in the nose of this beer. This is very nicely noticed in the taste. The taste is very nicely balanced, giving this beer a great taste. We feel this is a nicely brewed beer. Enjoy"
"As a dunkelweizen, I'm not too impressed. After letting the beer warm some out of the fridge, it poured with an average sized light tan head that soon subsided to a few small islands, a ring, and a little lace. Color is a nice, clear, red amber with a couple of bubble trails. Aroma is up front peaches with malt and yeast coming in way below. Flavors about the same as nose and with enough carbonic tang to save it. Body and carbonation are decent. Finish is like flavor with all components lasting to the very end of some good length. A peach beer."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a frothy white head that faded fast. The smell reminds me of kool-aid, lots of fruitiness and sweetness, I started to doubt this one once I smelled it. Upon my first sip I was sad that I ordered this one, the fruitiness and sweet hit you all at once. Not much else going on except some wheat toward the end. The beer is smooth, light mouthfeel, mostly thin. Overall I would recommend against this beer, the flavor got to me only a few sips in. I will not get this one again, too many bad flavors going on here."
"Wow a holiday beer in mid October...it gets earlier every year it seems like.Poured into a weizen glass a deep reddish infused russet color with a thinner pillow-like head atop.Peach and toasted wheat in the nose,not bad but the peach seemed artificial,maybe its not,just seemed so.Alot of peach flavor and there is some of the roasted pecan flavor in there,its smooth and surprisingly rich.A bit of toasted wheat malt to go with the fruity and nuttiy flavors.Not a bad beer,I bought it for my wife and I came out liking it more than her.Again Shiner gives me a pleasant surprise."
"Overall, this is a decently-balanced beer, the peach and pecan flavors mingling nicely with the malts and hops (and not over-poweringly so, which was a real concern when I'd only smelled the brew)."
"Overall, the peach is a bit much after awhile, but I though this was an unexpectedly interesting, easy drinking holiday brew."
"I only kept one because I wanted a friend of mine to taste how bad it was. He didn't mind it that much. I guess there is no accounting for taste."
"This beer pours a clear brown with gold and ruby tones under the light. It's aroma begins with molasses followed by hints of fruit and roast. The flavor is complex and well balanced with molasses, nut, fruit, and toast notes with maple in the finish. It has a medium mouthfeel and is quite drinkable. Spoetzl Shiner Holiday Cheer is a very good beer, complex and balanced and is a great match for hard sourdough pretzels. Highly recommended!"
"Overall: Not bad. Drink this if you like peaches and fruity beers. Would like to see a bigger mouthfeel, maybe some extra alcohol and more complexity. A nice change from the spice bombs I've been seeing this winter. I'm giving extra points for originality."
"I have bought this beer for the two holiday seasons. It is a very solid beer and another quality seasonal from Shiner. While it falls into line with the Dunkel's I have had, there is just somthing a little extra with it that I would recomend. If your a fan of shiner then you will probably love it, if you don't care for shiner, then you may could go either way. That tends to be the opinions I hear."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Dark amber colored with light brown head. The aroma is predominantly peaches and apricots. The taste is naturally heavy on the peaches with some nutty malt, banana bread and caramel flavors also in the mix. A peach flavored Dunkelweizen is not exactly my ideal winter seasonal but the overall flavor is surprisingly smooth and refreshing. Neat vintage label and this beer was a major let down for me - too peachy for a winter. I'd rather stick with the Shiner Bock here."
"Decent body. Carbonation is spot on. Finishes fine. The fruit is definitely the main player with flavors of strained peaches, more jam, cherries. I'm not getting any of the nutty quality others noted. Slightly drying on the finish. This is a decent beer, but is the style correct?? I'd just call this a Fruit Beer and be done with it."
"No real dunkelweizen character here but the peaches and pecans create a unique taste profile. An interesting take on a holiday brew."
"Another good beer from Shiner, different and good."
"D - This is an interesting beer. Some dunkelweizen flavor with peaches mixed it. I would drink it again. It could be something to have on hand for guests."
"Sounded interesting with the peaches and pecans, so I had to try one. Pours an amber gold color with minimal white foam that settles fast. Aromas of baked apples and cinnamon with a nutty undertone. Flavor is lightly sweet and refreshing. A nutty malt base with hints of honey and peach fruit. Nice carbonation, pretty much an adult holiday soda."
"12oz bottle, 2010 batch. Pours clear copper amber with a one finger off white head that quickly recedes to a wispy cap and ring, not much lacing at all. Aroma is a bunch of funky peaches, I can dig peaches but these are just...well...funky. A lot of pecan as well, maybe too much as it ain't playing nicely with the peaches and may be what is contributing to the funk. Also a bit of caramel malt. Good strength. Flavor is also loaded with the funky peach taste, particularly on the finish, pecans, good caramel malt backbone, bready, rather sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily becoming sticky, medium carbonation. Not my cup of tea. I know they use real peaches and pecans but can't help but feel that those may be boosted by some artificial flavorings as well. Doubt I'll make it to the end of the glass..."
" O: Thanks Shiner for spreading Holiday Cheer & a Happy New to all . Its not complexed but fun to drink. Thank you too for Mike Brawley for getting this one for me."
"D/O- Drinkability isn't bad, as long as you'd want to. No glaring inadequacies, just not what I'd pick to have a few of. I always like to enjoy a few of these around the holidays. Unique widely-available brew."
"D: Its unique smell and taste make it an enjoyable novelty beer, but not something that I would want to drink on a regular basis."
"D: Pretty high, might get tired of this after a few."
"d- okay, just cause this was a bit off the beaten path, and not exactly up my alley. it was interesting to try, but not anything that i'd seek out."
"To me, this is a once a year type beer. Its unique and a great beer to enjoy during the holidays, I would not probably drink this year round, even if it were available."
"Definitely different. If you like pecan or mild peach, this might be the beer for you. Not either of my favorites though."
"Drinkability: Considering how sickly sweet this beer can be, you probably couldn't drink it non-stop. But that being said it is still so good that you should check it out."
"Overall no way its a dopplebock and no way would I do it again"
"D: Strange...not wintery at all but I could see drinking it on my porch after mowing the lawn. I don't quite understand the idea of labeling a beer ""winter"" unless it tastes like winter."
"Pours a clear brown with a long lasting tan head. The nose delightfully packed with fruit and spices. I get a lot of raspberry aroma with a bit of molasses, cinnamon, and something like all spice. The flavors are considerably more simple than the nose, with most of the spice coming together to taste something like gingerbread. Raspberry/cranberry flavors are also quite prominent. A cranberry essence and tea-like bitterness linger long. Not a bad beer by any means, but doesn't live up the promise of its nose."
"Pours an amber reddish brown with a fluffy brown dissipate not too long after the pour. There is no evident carbonation or lacing. The smell is very sweet. Lots of peaches and strawberries up front. Artificial candy notes actually take over the whole nose. Taste is artificial as well with candy strawberries being the highlight. Mouthfeel. A bit syrupy and with medium carbonation. not good. Drinkability is minimal. Ill finish the one and move on to good beer. Not very impressed with this one."
"D- For any faults as a dunkelweizen, it's actually pretty good as a flavored holiday beer. I could see putting a few back at the big family Christmas gatherings. It would probably compliment the rich, Christmas dishes quite nicely."
"D- A unique beer that drinks a lot easier than the aroma indicates."
"Notes - An interesting take on a dunkelweizen. I'm surprised at some of the low marks it gets in the reviews; I guess innovation is only appreciated in the trendy brewers. Sure there's better dunkelweizens out there, but it's both tasty and unique, and that's good enough for me."
"Wrongfully labeled a dunkelweizen, this beer would not hold up to that style. Anyhow, I read they placed peach juice and pecans into this brew after the review. I think the peach juice is what kind of gives off the sour milk aroma and taste. I'd say take the crap out and see how this brew tastes then."
"This holiday beer has a distinct nutty and peachy smell/taste. Although sometimes it comes off smelling like popcorn... don't know if that's just me. Finishes smooth. Nothing special about the color or head features and came off a little flat... but that may have been the tap that it came from. Could use a little more hops, very strong malty flavors with a fruity/nutty aftertaste."
"Excellent holiday offering from Shiner. Made with pecans and peach, a great blend of sweet and nutty with a little touch of citrus. Very good to drink one, but all the flavors make it tough to drink more than that. The peach flavor is definitely a pretty unique one."
"Shiner nailed the ""holidays in Texas"" theme with the great peach and butter pecan notes on the nose, but the body/taste of the brew was nothing spectacular. However, given the flavors involved it was very drinkable!"
"I rather enjoy the notion of peaches added to a beer like Dunkelweizen, but only if the subtle complexities of the base beer can be read, and not dominated by such a finess type of fruit as the peach. As with many Shiner beers, the over-attenuation leads to astringency and grainy taste: signature Shiner. No real mention of pecans? I thought that a walnut flavor from grain/malt made more of a contribution than pecans- would have missed it if the label hadn't said so."
"F/D - Carbonated with a smooth finish. Definitely worth a try and I'll have another. I'm not sure how peaches are holiday flavors but it's an interesting change."
"Drinkability: Great beer to show your woman or friends who need something different. Definitely a great beer from Shiner, TX!"
"Overall, another enjoyable beer from Shiner, but as expected nothing out of this world. The peach and pecan are unique. Would be a good recommendation for a newcomer to craft brew."
"Drinkability: Not too bad, but too fruity for me to go more than one bottle at a time."
"This beer is caramel or light coffee color..with quite a bit of carbonation. Not a whole lot of head though. Nice sticky lace..almost like a watered down syrup. I can definetely smell the peach. Very good tasting. Goes down well. You gotta have one of these."
"A nice surprise and a totally different kind of Holiday beer from Shiner."
"Pours a reddish-tan with a hefty head which dwindles to ~1/4inch. First smells strongly of peaches, slightly nutty and then peachy lingering. Tastes similar to smell, except tastes more like a dunkelweizen beer. Does not smell all that much like beer to me. The taste is not too strong, with a slightly wheaty finish precluded by light hoppy bite. Feels a bit to fizzy, I could have gone for a slightly greater viscosity with less fizzy carbonation. Overall, a fun beer to try, but not something worth going out of your way for. Very cool bottle, though!"
"Overall, I'm glad I tried it but I don't feel the need to revisit it again until next December. It was good and worth the try, however, there was something too artificial about it. The peach flavor tasted like the peach flavoring in an Arizona Ice Tea, only not as pronounced."
"Overall, a very interesting. Somewhat drinkable. Very fruity. At first, I thought I would be able to drink multiples, but quickly found out that one would be enough."
"overall, i don't hate it but do not necessarily like it too much, either. for a winter/holiday/x-mas ale it's interesting but not something i think i would want to revisit or look forward to every year."
"A very drinkable beer and much better than I expected it to be."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a dark ruby with a thin diminishing head that leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is very mild caramel and sweet fruit. The taste is an interesting blend of sweet fruits, caramel and mild spice. The beer is quite light but seems a bit undercarbonated. This one was worth trying, but I can't see myself drinking it again."
"D- I like this beer a lot. I've had beers from this particular brewery before, and wasn't impressed. This is a whole new level from them. It is easy to drink, tasty, and unique to a point."
"Dunkelweizen? Really? I wish it had struck me more like a dunkelweizen, I like a good DW. This Shiner Cheer just isn't for me."
"I picked up a 6 pack of these and after finishing 2, had no desire to grab a third, the peach flavor gets pretty old pretty quick and I would not say this beer is very drinkable. The peach flavor is a nice novelty, but when that novelty wears off you are left with a mediocre nutty ale."
"The flavor has loads of Peach Jolly Rancher character and a lot of artificial peach character. Just overwhelming here. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of this. A bit of peaches and cream throughout with a bit of light sweetness. The feel is a bit creamy with a medium body. I can't really drink much of this. The peach character is fairly fake and quite overwhelming."
"If you're from Texas, or you have a special place for Hill Country peaches and Texas pecans, and Shiner, you're gonna love this beer. It pours out dark amber, has a wonderful peach aroma and just the right amount of bitterness. I like it better than the Hefe Shiner makes, but its kind of like that the first time you drink it you know you're getting something different, and something good. Like the hefe, it is fairly high ABV, you wouldn't really know it though as smooth as it goes down. Who said they could only drink two of these in a session, lmao."
"Overall a beer that definitely isn't boring or forgettable. When I think of Christmas, peaches aren't the first noun to come to mind. But now that I've tried it, I'm glad I did. If the peach flavor could be knocked down about 25% and replace that with more pecan, I think we'd have one humdinger of a Texan Christmas offering."
"Spoetzl Brewery could really improve Holiday Cheer with just a little effort. It'd improve easily with a little less peach, and a little more spice and body. It's just okay. Probably worth a try if you're compelled. But, stick with a single or bottle or two. A six pack seems like a stretch."
"drinkability- this is a great beer for any season and a nice session."
"A beer that will pair excellent with fruitcake if you like fruitcake. Holiday Cheer pours a dark brown with a fruit scent, peaches are the most obvious. It drinks rather smooth as you get a semi-mild taste of different fruits ending in an ever so slight spice. Out of all the beers I've tried to date, this has to be my favorite. The only way to improve this to a 10 of 10 is by adding a slight more texture and taste to it. Definetly a must try if you can find it."
"Definitely a fun and interesting beer that is worth a try. Not sure I would drink a ton of them in a sitting, but happy I drank one."
"A curiosity here - a seasonal ale flavored with peach and pecan. Odd and not necessarily a typical cold-weather brew, but Shiner's always been dependable enough for a good tasting beer. Nonetheless, I'm not overly fond of this one. The sweet flavor is followed by a nutty finish, which sounds well enough, but this is just not one I'd purchase a 6-pack of, at least this year. Maybe next year's batch will be better?"
"Drink up for it will be gone soon!"
"Overall an interesting holiday beer id say by its self. A good reason to break out those tasteing glasses for family to try before they commit and waist a good beer."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I love the flavor. The flavor of peaches in this beer are awesome."
"Overall, this one is decent. Give it a shot. If I see it again when I am feeling better, I will review it again. Maybe my tastebuds are messed up right now."
"D- The sweetness really was a touch too much for me, it could have had a bit more balance or a little more restraint with the fruitiness"
"Notes: love this one-of-a-kind ideal holiday brew"
"I liked this one... Not sure I could drink more than a couple but the uniqueness of the flavors would keep me interested for a bit..."
"2010 version poured into shaker pint glass. Poured an amber coler with a small head that disapated fairly quickly. Aromas of peaches, light brown sugar, and lightly roasted malt. Taste was pretty good: malt, a touch of peaches, nuts, and brown sugar. Out of the offerings I've had from Shiner, this one comes out on top."
"D- Somewhat different than other dunkels I've had, yet pretty tasty. Its a nice seasonal beer."
"Mouthfeel is a little syrupy and sweet. The peach aftertaste has a fizzy character that has nothing to do with the carbonation. This is a great dessert beer and would be great for a holiday party. I don't see this as a dunkelweizen as more of a straight up fruit beer."
"Drinkability was pretty good, considering. Pretty tasty, interesting combination of ingredients. Don't know how much I'd want one one a cold holiday night. This is way more of a summer beer. Unique and one of the few decent brews Spoetzl makes. Nice job."
"Pours a very dark amber to brown color with light tan head that is nice at first, but recedes to a thin rim. Nose has plenty of peach and toasty aromas, maybe some black tea. On the palate the peach comes through nicely with a wheat cracker malt flavor. Extra nutty sweetness. Finishes like a dessert cake."
"I think they did a good job of marrying a peach beer with a dark wheat beer. Probably not something I'd want to have more than one or two at a time, but good nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Most drinkable beer I've had in a long time. I think the dry finish and fruity taste help a lot with the drinkability."
"In the end, if they were trying to make a peach beer, they nailed it. That being said, this is most certainly NOT a dunkelweizen. Furthermore, I'm a little pissed at Spoetzl honestly... I see the neck of the bottle peaking above the cardboard holder, and it claims to be ""A Bavarian style dark wheat"". ""Sounds great!"" I thought to myself. It wasn't until I got home that the little tidbit about peaches and pecan showed itself at the very bottom of the label. In the end, I guess it is my fault for not reading the entire label in the store, but honestly, if you're making something that smacks you across the face with peach like this... it needs to be more clearly advertised as such."
"Pours a light brown color with a frothy beige head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is a nice blend of peaches, caramelized pecans, wheat, toasted bread, and a hint of bourbon. The flavor has some peaches in syrup notes upfront, along with a pecan nuttiness, a bit of toasted bread and caramel, wheat twang, earthy hops, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is pretty good. An interesting and unique dunkel, with an amazing aroma but it's too sweet to have more than one."
"My first thought here is WOW! Six and a half bucks from a brewery that is meh at best, and I am very impressed. Pours a medium amber color, with a bit of a white head on top. Light to medium bodied, with a good amount of carbonation. Huge peach aroma and flavor carry the day here, along with a hint of nuts, some light brown sugar and earth. A very surprising, inviting and delicious ""holiday"" beer."
"mouthfeel medium-full, strongly carbonated. easy to drink, but not really for me. it's the overwhelming taste of peaches that turns me off to it."
"Interesting, a flavored holiday ale where we would possibly want more than one. Nice to see something different rather than the usual pie spicing that ends up tasting like organic toothpaste. A good pick for the holiday party, as it will definitely spark some interest if not conversation. This is without a doubt a beer that non-beer drinkers could approach and hopefully get pulled into."
"Its a bit cloying but not too bad. I actually enjoyed it despite the review seeming negative. Its a decent brew, a bit sweet, but not bad."
"A tad tardy for ""holiday cheer", strictly speaking, but who's counting? It pours a clear amber garnet topped by a somewhat short-lived finger of tan foam. The nose comprises cranberry sauce, maple syrup, peaches, brown sugar, sweet flowers, and a touch of miscellaneous grains. The taste brings some darker wheat to the table, along with the advertised pecans in some decent abundance. Meanwhile, the rest of the smell's constituency returns, the fruit (and I'm including the cranberries in this group) clashing with the pecans in a strange and not altogether good or bad way. A toasted biscuit factor is introduced as well, adding to the already cluttered complexity. As far as the flavors go, the sum of the parts suffers from too many disparate parts that don't quite synergize all that well together (some do with others, but it's clear the office is not moving forward in a unified manner). The body is a nice medium, with a light carbonation and a decently smooth and easy-going feel. Overall, a good idea on paper didn't translate too well in practice, but, given the circumstances, things could have gone much, much worse."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Solid mouthfeel, nice and light, and I found it easy to drink without loving the flavor. Very interesting and unusual, but far from up my alley."
"Libation: I can't put my finger on a specific taste I don't like here, but the blending isn't to my liking and I'm not sure it's balanced. A hint of peaches would go great in a beer, but this is too much of a peach wallop. The nuttiness and alcohol try to reign in those peaches, but they fail. It's an interesting beer, but not one I'll naturally turn to at Christmas time."
"D- More impressive than I had thought"
"For some reason Shiner is everywhere in California, and for cheap, me likey. Sad thing is that I am not so much a fan of this beer. To be true to the BA code, I am supposed to compare this to a dunkelweiss, but I can't because this is a stretch. Comparing this to the other winter beers, this one was a bit much on the ""drinking a cake"" thing. Yes you get a pecan flavor and peaches, but really, not the best in a beer. poured dark, little head, sweet candy taste. Overall, this was ok, not bad, they did explain the beer on the bottle and it tasted like it said."
"Not a bad drinker, but really one is enough. A little two sweet and filling to drink more than one."
"D: Flavorful and drinkable. The dominant light fruit sweetness hinder sessionablity."
"If you like peaches and pecans, I can't imagine you not enjoying this beer. And here's the kicker: I don't even like peaches!"
"It's drinkable provided you like the taste of peaches."
"Notes: This is certainly a unique brew. I like peaches, so I enjoyed it. But if you don't care for canned peaches then watch out! I'll at least have a few bottles next holiday season."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink though not something I would want to have again"
"Overall I am glad to get my hands on this beer for the ABV it's both smooth and delicious."
"Bottle poured out a dark amber color, not very big head. It smells slightly fruity, you can pick up the hint of peach. The taste is less peach and more pecan, but it finishes slightly fruity and a little bitter. I didn't hate this beer, but I didn't love it. There are definitely better seasonal options out there."
"Pours dark red with an off-white head. Aroma is strong peaches and maybe some pecans. Flavor is pecan, caramel malt and peaches. Quite a bit of nuttyness in the flavor and it finishes slightly bitter. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. I think this is targeted towards macro drinkers but it is an interesting beer anyway. Not bad overall."
"D - easily sessionable if you dig the flavor combo. Don't think I could do >2 myself."
"Interesting take on a holiday beer. I took my first smell and sip expecting the holiday spice cabinet as I had not yet read the label and found the peach flavor to be a nice change from the usual holiday beers."
"Dribnkability: Decent beer overall. Quite drinkable and a light, refreshing beer for the holiday season. Would go well with pecan pie or a Christmas dinner."
"Sweet peach, molasses, honey and spice in the aroma - this holiday brew really has a nice nose to it. Body is a bit thin, but the peaches and roasted nuts come into play with the quaff. On the sweet side, esp. for a winter holiday brew - this could use more spice and hops, but all in all, not too bad of a drinking brew. Might be tough to work through a sixer in a sitting though."
"Cola, peaches, strawberries, caramel and pecans are dominant on the tongue, along with a touch of nutmeg and chocolate. It's very sweet and syrupy, though the body is thin and carbonation high. It finishes on a dry note, with some lingering bitterness, Cherry Coke and peach. This is strange, unsettling stuff; it's like a soda/beer hybrid. If you're the type of person that adds shots of vodka to their RC Cola, you may enjoy this, but otherwise it's best avoided."
"Overall no where near what I was expecting. I didn't read the label when I grabed this beer. Lesson learned. Not a bad beer by any stretch. Just not a typical holiday beer. Unique for sure."
"D: If it were me, I would have filed this beer under Winter Warmer, as the peach and nut character are the true centerpiece, not the very faint weizen flavors. Overall, quite drinkable. I'm glad I picked it up."
"Quite an odd beer. Probably worth trying for the experience if you can split a single bottle with someone else - a full 12oz bottle was a bit much of this for me, and I have no desire to get more."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated, sticky, rich, and creamy finish. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. I really like this beer it has a roundness to the flavor and a nice supple finish. This is a wonderful easy drinking beer."
"Very interesting and rather drinkable, though the finish is perhaps a bit too astringent. Peaches are not the sort of fruit I generally think of when it comes to winter, though having been born and raised in The Peach State on the site of an old pecan plantation, I do very much enjoy both peaches and pecans, and the combination in a beer is pleasant, unexpected, and uncommon. Certainly recommended."
"Overall, I'd suggest this beer to any of my friends. Cheers."
"Overall impression: A very artifical, confusing ale. Not sure what to think of it but it just tasted industrial and artificial. Avoid."
"Probably too harsh on this. It's a good value for the price, but I guess I've been spoiled by Shiners other recent offerings like Commemorator."
"pours is copper lager clear. with as small head that doesn't stick around long. nose is that initial cereal i've found in other shiners... after it sits a very prominent strawberry. palate is sweet. not much wheat character. not much of anything besides the fruit citrus of a strawberry then a overly hoppy. and i'm not saying its actually a hoppy beer but no balance at all as for malt character interaction. quite plain. might have been decent if it wasn't clear... crisp, not bready dense. not as misplaced yeast as some of the other shiners. definitely not a dukelweizen so don't try if that's what you're hoping for."
"This beer is not sweet like I thought it was going to be, which was a pleasant surprise. I would probably spend 6 bucks on a 22oz rogue style bottle, but luckily it is that price for a 6 pack. Very good deal and very good beer. The flavor is very complex and the peach/cream/caramel comes first with the hop bitterness next. Both flavors then lighten up. Also, the beer is very carbonated. Best beer that I have had from Shiner. They did a great job brewing this beer."
"Drinkability? Interesting stuff going on but 1 bottle was all that I could handle. Worth a shot but nothing really sessionable about this brew and really, not much of a dunkelweizen."
"Sweetness and the extent of the peach is a bit too much for this beer enthusiast."
"The mouthfeel is pretty thin with a light to moderate carbonation giving it a crisp bite."
"Holiday cheer indeed..."
"Taste-Fresh peaches, dark malts and wheat, subtle roasted pecans that just balance out the sweetness of the peaches. Nicely balanced, as a little peach essence goes a long way , but this brew seems to get it right. Flavor is not cloying, but rather refreshing and very drinkable. A very interesting and tasty offering-Certainly worth a try!"
"Oh God, the peaches. It's not so much that the peach flavor is all that bad, in fact it's one of the more natural-tasting fruit flavors in a fruit beer that I've tried, but it's just extremely peachy, like someone mixed peach preserves and beer. The smell is particularly peachy, literally rather than figuratively. The flavor is like a cross between a strawberry soda, a light possibly decent dunkelweizen and a giant bowl of peaches (and a trace of bile - but I hate a lot of sweet fruit beers). I've never really associated peaches with the holiday season, so it leaves me a bit confused. Maybe, it's a Texas thing. Also, if anyone can taste pecan in this beer, my hat is off to you. It's really not a horrible beer, I guess, but it's not my thing."
"Alright, so this is my first review, and I am partial to dunkelweizen, but this beer was very interesting. The peach notes are obvious from the moment you open the bottle, and the pecan is tasted from the first sip. While this isn't my first rodeo, I did appreciate the subtleness from the first note onward. While this isn't the best dunkel I've had, I have been enjoying it thoroughly. All I can say is the description on the bottle has been accurate, and isn't going to disappoint."
"After reading about this a Christmas or two ago, this is my first sampling, and I must admit this is like finding a surprise package under the tree. I have never tasted an ale like this one before. The use of peaches and pecans gives this a unique flavor profile, which is neither dry nor sweet, but has bit of tartness in the finish. Getting over the initial flavor shock, this becomes a very tasty, drinkable beer. A krausend 5.4 % delight."
"If you see it grab at least one bottle to try. The interesting Peach component makes this pretty unique at least from a TX brewer."
"A good Christmas beer - although I'm not sure its a dunkel."
"Not a very desirable beer by any means and definately a stretch calling this a Dunkelweiss."
"I must admit, peach isn't a flavor I'm fond of in beer. I'm glad I only bought a single bottle of this. I applaud the creative spin on a holiday beer, but it's just not my bag."
"Not sure if I would buy it again or not."
"D: This is a nice beer. The fruity peach flavors remind me of a summer beer, while the full body and toasted malts are more of a fall feel. Overall the beer works, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't like sweet fruity beers."
"i drank all right away cause that was about the only enjoyment i got from them"
"I'm usually not a fan of Holiday spiced ales. They are mostly over the top with artificial flavors; however, this one dispite its weird smell is quite nice. I could do a couple of these during the holidays or any other days. It would be nice with a slice of pecan pie. Which reminds me....I did't even notice the pecans!"
"Poured a Clear fizzy amber color with a creamy off white head and good lacing. Smells of artificial peaches, nutty, bready. Taste is about as it smells, Huge peach flavor but not in a good way. It taste way too artificial and sweet. Light to medium oily body. One is definably enough to drink in one sitting. I don't believe I will drink this again to tell you the truth."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"An interesting beer and not bad.... I'm glad to have Shiner trying offerings like this, and I think I'd drink a few again next winter."
"Drinkability: I don't get it. The union of peaches and pecans alongside a dunkelweizen (which is as much a proper dunkelweizen as Shiner Bock is a bock) is totally lost on me. This just isn't what I'm looking for in a fruit beer, winter beer, or dunkelweizen."
"Shiner Holiday Cheer is a unique beer that gets points for originality. On the other hand, only peachophiles will love it. Since I'm not one, I don't. Here's hoping the boys at Spoetzl come up with something completely different this coming holiday season."
"Overall I loved the smell of this beer, but the taste did not match it. For me that killed the experience a little bit. If they added some sugar to increase sweetness and found a way to make that nutty pecan smell come through in the taste this beer would be downright awesome."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 3/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of fruit (peaches), tart malt, some caramel, a hint of all spice, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of a Dunkelweizen. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of peaches and earthy malt up front. A strong dryness is present after the initial sip. A slight hop background is barely noticeable and a strong peach/biscuit flavor dominates the finish. Overall, not a very good Dunkelweizen. I would not recommend this brew unless you're trying to find a decent peach flavored beer."
"Medium mouthfeel and smooth with a malty sweetness in the front and some balancing hop bitterness in the back. There is some bite from the carbonation and a little punch from the alcohol. I can't really decide if the flavor is to style or not, but it is pleasing."
"Good beer unlike anything that I've had."
"A little sweet overall, but definitely a flavorful and interesting beer. The odd combination of pecans and peaches in a beer really works here."
"While it seems to be just what Spoetzl was going for, it's not a beer for me. I guess I'm not a big fan of peaches in beer."
"This is a love it or hate it kind of beer. I am not a huge Shiner fan, but I really dig this beer. They really stepped out of their comfort zone with this one, and I could not be happier they did so. An odd choice for a holiday beer? Yes. But is it delicious? Hell yea, damn near chuggable. I freaking went through over a case of this and hope they release it again next year. Important to note that it does not age well, as it really loses the peachy brightness of the beer."
"Clear red brown, very dense light tan head. Possible tiny reindeer tracks in the head, but I can't be sure. Smell is VERY fruity. Peaches, oranges, lemons, bananas, cherries. And peaches. I'm serious, this smells like a soothie. Taste follows suit, very sweet, with oranges and vanilla. It tastes like one of those orange cream candies. Interesting. I would have a VERY hard time classing this. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Drinkability is excellent. You could just suck these down all Christmas eve. Until you went glucose intolerant. To sum it up...I have little to no idea what to make of this."
"Overall impression: Its different, but overall not all that interesting. That being said there is nothing overtly bad about it, and I'm sure I'll have no trouble finishing the six pack."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, the best wheat beer I have ever had. This is also the best Shiner beer I have ever had. A great job and an excellent beer."
"Thanks to Deuane for picking me up a few bottles of this while out in State College. This has to be one of the coolest, retro looking bottle of beer that I've ever come across, right down to the cap. Seems like it jumped out of a time machine from the 50's. Cheers to the graphic artist(s) that designed the artwork for this beer. Poured into my nonic pint glass a clear deep brown amber color reminiscent of cream soda with barely a finger of off white foam. Smells of toasted grain and fresh sweet peaches. Tastes of creamy caramel malt, fresh peaches, and a pleasant nutty bitterness. Medium in both body and carbonation. A very tasty and different take on a holiday beer. Well done."
"Overall a drinkable, if odd dunkel. Flavor is not as unified as I would prefer."
"Another boring fruit beer, where is all the Dunkelweizen goodness."
"pours a clear amber body with a billowy-bubbly lightly brown head. the smell is very interesting. it's very berry like, fruity, fruit punch. with a hint of saaz hops i think, graipfruit / pine smell. Taste is interesting. lots of different fruits going on, peachy for sure. the dominant flavor is the grapefruit / pine hops. it could use a little for malt up front to match the hops. mouth feel is light a carbonated. drinkability is average, maybe not a session beer but you could do a sixpack in one night. this might be my favorite xmass beer because it's not super high alcohol, not super heavy, and not heavily spiced."
"An orange/ yellow color with a slight white head. The peach comes right to the front with added smells of apricot and cherry. Very refreshing in taste with the peach being a subtle flavor that blends well. An easy drinking beer with a nice balance of flavor. I like this beer. Simple but good."
"Solid holiday beer from a place you wouldn't necessarily expect it from."
"D- The added peach flavor really detracts from drinkability. However, this beer has enough character to be a delight all by itself(rather than paired with a meal)"
"It's a better than average beer, but not great, or even good. It's a nice change of pace from usual beers and is an easy drinker."
"Mouthfeel is thin, and I wouldn't drink this again if I had to."
"D- Not to bad not something I'd have all the time."
"D - I still can't over how much peach flavor was in this beer. Even after some time of having a sip, the flavor still sits, very sweetly, in my mouth. I can't see having more then one at a sitting."
"taste is somewhat watery, tangy, dark fruit, some cherry, malt, and spice, flatting out quite quickly, end is slightly dry."
"Poured a medium reddish-brown color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of peaches and some roasted nuttiness. The nuts were in the background at first, but came out more as I drank. Tastes of peaches, nuts, and caramel. Medium sweet. Lots of Peaches."
"I just tried this new Shiner beer last night before the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio .. definately has a holiday taste to it. I normally don't like ""fruity"" beers but this one has a lot of flavour! I don't find it nearly as good as Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale, a bit sweeter, but still, you ought to try it. I'd just had about 4 plates of Tex-Mex food (mostly marinated chicken to make some fajitas with) and this ended the meal on a positive note."
"D-Low. This beer is overly fruity, making a beer that's a bit too one-dimensional, focusing on the fruit while seemingly leaving the rest of the beer behind."
"Drinkability - Overall, I would have to say fairly good drinkability. I like combination of the pecan and peach flavor. It is a sweeter brew, but its a nice seasonal type variety."
"A very easy drinking beer! Very Nice! Im going to hide one of these away for the 4th of July."
"D-Wow! A different take on a holiday brew with peaches and pecans...a nice southern twist from Shiner. This one is a winner IMHO. I really like the fresh, real peach taste combined with the tannic dryness from the pecans. A well balanced and flavourful brew. Wish I had more of this one! Although they call this a dunkleweizen? I find no dunkle or weizen in here at all...regardless I enjoyed it!"
"Merry Christmas 2008/Happy Holidays/Kwanzaa/ Hannukah, etc. BA, and thanks for the bottle Dr. Brad!"
"Where's the beer? This is pretty strange, very non-dunkelweizen. If you like really sweet, fruity alcoholic beverages though, this one is for you."
"It wasn't bad, really. I could have gone for multiple in a session no problem, but there is always other beer to check out."
"I hope if Shiner offers a Holiday Cheer next year, they experiment in another direction. I'll be sure to pick it up if I see it."
"Normally I'm not a fan of fruit beers, but this one was really enjoyable, surprisingly so actually. When I first smelled the beer and the sweetness to it, I figured it would be like drinking fruit juice mixed with beer. It was nothing like that. I found this rather enjoyable to drink."
"D: The peach flavor is novel, but I'm not compelled to have more. I'll add the bottle to my Christmas collection, but I'm think I'm pretty much done."
"O- Wouldn't be that bad if the peach flavor wasn't so freaking overwhelming. A one trick pony."
"Drinkability: Very high thanks to the bubbles, and they help remove the stickiness typically left from a beer like this. I really enjoy the taste. Despite the peaches seeming more like a summer fruit, I think this is an excellent accompaniment to holiday celebrations."
"Drinkability - maybe it's just a fad, but I'm digging this beer and contemplating a few more sixers to share around the family and 'hood. Kudos to HawkinMI for alerting me to these babies over in NKY."
"D- Very smooth texture, but the sweetness and peach flavor are quite out of balance. Probably couldn't drink more than two at a time. Would go really well with desert however."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some peach, toffee. The taste is malty, with a very nice peachy note, with some toffee thrown in. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, quite different."
"Drink ability is great. Overall good seasonal beer, another solid product from shiner, one of my favorite winter seasonal beers even though its not your typical winter beer."
"D - The peach is definitely the focus of this beer but it isn't overpowering. A simple beer overall, but certainly tasty. One of Shiner's better offerings."
"Drinkability is moderate. A tasty beer, but the overbearing peach flavor will definitely limit the consumption of this beer."
"Drinkability- This is a really hard one on drinkability, it's one you have to try just to sample those flavors, but it may not exactly be your cup of tea. After drinking the whole beer, I'm still not exactly sure if I like it or not. There are good and bad aspects to this beer. That said, I'm glad I have a six pack to re-evaluate at my leisure."
"D- Very drinkable. More drinkable than most fruit beers."
"D - This isn't a bad beer as long as its pretty cool but as it gets warmer the peaches come out all that much more until its almost undrinkable but its worth trying as long as its cool"
"Oh i just thought i would add that i found out the ABV is 5.4"
"Despite that... it isn't awful. I managed to finish the entire bottle but I'm glad I didn't buy a six-pack."
"A very drinkable holiday beer, and a nice change of pace from the heavier ""barley-based"" beers of winter. I would have liked to have seen a bit more spice in the beer and just a bit less carbonation. Having said that, though, this beer exceeded my expectations quite a bit."
"Pours a clear dark brown-reddish color body. Big cream colored head, somewhat diminishing. Strong aroma of peaches, some dark malts. Almost like an acidic aroma. Peachy, pecany taste, medium body. Tasty, peachy aftertaste. Nice grainy taste, maybe wheat or something. Nice fruity taste from the peaches. Somewhat carbonated."
"D: Well, what my initial sentence stated. Having a hard time wrapping my mind around peaches, and Christmas. Not working. This, however, would be a great beer to fall back on on a hot July afternoon, something different than my normal Saison/Kolsch/wit habit."
"Let this beer warm up. After it does it becomes a refreshingly crisp beer with a huge peach flavor and aroma."
"A very easy drinking beer! Very Nice!"
"Drinks easy, this an Americanized dunkleweizen. I could drink a few before moving on. Probably on the better brews I've had from these guys"
"I found this to be a balanced and interesting brew. Tweak it a little, lighten it little and bingo!.. you could have a delightful summer refresher."
"A tasty treat from Shiner. Absolutely amazing aroma, and great taste. Not quite as good as Shiner Black, but this one is unique and one of a kind. Nothing like this one, so check it out folks!"
"wow, I was very surprised on how much i enjoyed this. Pours a dark brown-ruby colour .. stable head, covers the top like a blanket .. dark semi-sweet malt and lots of peach, fresh and burnt, nice! ... very drinkable, with just a touch of bitterness on the finish... thank god, this beer is actually really nice! .. a great beer for the weird texas winter?"
"I knocked out two of these right off the bat. Very good beer."
"Verdict: Between this and Shiner Dunkelweizen, it's no contest: Holiday Cheer just doesn't measure up. But that's not a fair way to rate the beer. Viewed objectively, this is a nice middle-of-the-road Dunkelweizen with an interesting splash of Peach. It fits well into Shiner's portfolio of beers stuck in a bizarre purgatory between macro and micro. I'm still not sure what peach has to do with Christmas, but I'm willing to look past that here."
"D) Flavorful, festive, not a bad beer and I'm glad I got the 6'er. High marks for creativity, but I would like to see the peach dialed down a mark or three."
"Not Shiners best work, but a very easy drinking Christmas beer."
"Overall, nasty and a drain pour. One and done. Very glad I got a single instead of a sixer. Another sub-par effort from Shiner - a faded Texas icon. Avoid."
"This will be the last 6'er I buy of this. There are just far too many better winter/christmas beers out there."
"D - Great flavor, low alcohol, and smooth drinkability makes this a very holiday sessionable ale. With that said, its almost impossible to view this as a dunkelweizen. I dont see many traits of a dunkelweizen in this beer, and IMO should be considered a fruit beer. Highly drinkable and delicious!!!"
"What a funny thing to come from Shiner. I love the idea, and the beer's not bad either. It's fun and different and, well, peachy! Prosit!"
"D: Definitely drinkable, good work Spoetzl. I'm always pleased when the little brewery in Shiner cranks out a quality brew."
"Great beer, one of Shiner's best in my opinion. The fruitiness was a nice surprise, would recommend this beer to anyone."
"D - This is a great beer. Yeah, I'll be drinking this all season long."
"I appreciate a fruit beer that isn't cloyingly sweet. This isn't a beer I'll seek out again, but I don't dread finishing the six-pack. In fact, it's quite drinkable."
"This is different and unique. Something I would recommend. Definitely one of Spoetzl's better offerings."
"Overall this beer suprised me. I found myself enjoying it. Although I could not drink more than a few due to the big present of peaches. Not a big peach fan but the beer was tasty."
"What an odd beer, this Holiday Cheer. Not sure I'd call it a dunkelweizen, although it is, according to the brewery, a variation on their dunkel theme from a previous brew. Still, I can't see this one catching on with the mainstream. Interesting, yes, but probably a one-time brew. Glad I tried it, though, if nothing else."
