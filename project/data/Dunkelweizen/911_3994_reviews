"Pours a light brown color with a foamy head.  Aroma of bubblegum and toasted malt.  The flavor of bubblegum and banana, roasted malt, caramel and dry grains.  Truly a remarkably tasty, authentic dunkel wiessbier from Germany. So good and to drink it in the Teutonia Mannechor, Pittsburgh's German club, was outstanding.  Absolutely fantastic."

""
"Not as lovely as their Helles and not at the level of Weihenstephaner, but this brew is plenty enjoyable."
""
"Head is unimpressive. Darker than expected, even for a dunkel weisse. Smells of roast, pencil shavings, and faint notes of fruitiness and cocoa."
""
""
"O) I was expecting something similar to Schneider Weisse Original and Weihenstephaner Dunkel, but this is an entirely different take on the style and that is great.  The roasted flavour comes more into place here giving a well balanced and enjoyable bier.  Fill your boots."
""
""
"O- Delicious. Yet another Andechser beer I feel is underrated. Try this beer if you like Dunkelweizens."
""
"We need to import more of these Bavarian banana bombs over here. This one has aroma of fresh baked banana bread and a rich ripe fruit and caramel taste to match.  Unfiltered and dark with more ester flavor than most of the other German imports typically available. Exceptionally smooth with a slight tart finish."
""
"My first Andechs beer.Pours into a weizen glass a chestnut brown with a large blooming tan head atop.Roasted bananas in the nose along with clove and chocolate.Bananas are big on the palate with a bit of nuttiness and chocolate,the phenols are not in your face.Wow a great dunkel weiss here flavor packed but subtle."
"The taste and texture are both outstanding."
""
"A good amount of flavor for a dunkel without being too like a hefe simply with toasted qualities."

"T: Plain and simple, like a slice of chocolate chip banana bread. Light twang of bubblegum, toffee, brown sugar, walnuts, cracked wheat, and hop spice. This beer is just as good in summer with its light body as it is in the winter months with its comforting flavor."
""
""
"Overall: So much flavor for a 5% beer. This style and doppelbocks are becoming a favorite of mine. This brewery makes both. Both if which are awesome stuff."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."
"Overall, yes. This is a very nice beer. Simple and elegant."

"Notes : First Dunkelweizen I ever try."

"Medium body with soft carbonation and a strong peppery spice presence up front that lingers over the yeast, citrus and sweeter malt notes into a spritzy, tart finish. Hints of black pepper and clove dominate at first but are soon countered by some sourdough bread and banana before some citric acidity kicks in on the back end. The malt presence isn't as prominent as in the nose but it's still evident with subtle roast and hints of toasted malt, hazelnut, caramel and toffee. Decent amount of sweetness without taking away from the classic wheat beer flavors. Slightly tart lemon juice/pith flavor toward the back of the palate. Crisp and refreshing and while it's heavier than an average weissebier, it's still pretty easy to drink."
""
""
"Spicy, malty, fruity and sweet. The carbonation was just a bit low for my liking but it didn't detract enough from the delicate balance of flavor for me to deduct too much. Between Ayinger, Weihen and now Andechs, it seems like those 500ml German bottles are always a hit."

"Deep chestnut brown with a reddish hue and a one inch beige/brown cap of fine bubbles. Decent head retention, some lacing. Aromas of malt and bread, banana and caramel, hint of cloves. Low to moderate bitterness with malt and toffee sweetness, light banana and clove character, a bit bready. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, a bit dry on the palate. Pretty good overall."
""
""
"O: Like dark bread, banana bread and bananas foster all in one. Very delicious, but a touch thin."
""
""
"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Cloudy chocolate brown pour with a huge three finger beige head with great retention and nice lacing. Malty, spicy, earthy nose with hints of brown bread, banana, dark fruits, toffee, and subtle cloves. The taste follows suit with big banana bread notes along with hints of toast, cocoa, spicy hops, nutmeg, dark fruits, toffee, nuts, cloves, and just a touch of cinnamon. The mouthfeel is lighter bodied than I had expected, but still substantial and slightly chewy. Subtle fizzy carbonation, great balance, and hugely drinkable. Overall, a great interpretation of the style from one of my favorite German Breweries."

"appears a very dark brown, nice thick cream colored head. great head retention and lacing, which lasts to the bottom of the glass. strong aroma of German ale yeast esters. very herbal. taste is slightly sweet. bready malt flavors, wheat. earthy. yeasty aftertaste. medium body, smooth carbonation, easy drinking."
""

"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of some bananas, light wheat. Taste is mild, banana, a bit of wheat, good but kind of mild, not much spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good, easy drinking beer."
""
""
"Light in flavor profile, malt-forward but well-balanced by bitterness. Banana and clove notes. Nice malty sweetness. Prickly carbonation that takes a while to settle down. Good flavor for only a 5% ABV beer. This is a solid, if unspectacular dark wheat."
""
""
"Prost!"
""
"O: This beer is an excellent representation of the style as the taste has lots of complex flavors, even without getting all of the yeast out of the bottle."
"Taste is sweet to start, cloves and banana and slight burnt in the middle, with a light acrid character coming on at the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is great. Another good brew."
""
"Cheers!"

"A friend who lives in Munich took me to the and echo bar in downtown Munich. Heavenly beers in tap. Never knew that Andechs was available in the USA. Wonderfully delicious and refreshing beer, even for a dunker weissbier. Full flavor, sweet malts. Ill stock up if I can find more. I recommend you do the same."

"Pouring a very dark brown with reddish brown highlights, this beer is capped with a dense, light brown head with excellent retention and nice lacing. The nose is all sorts of dunkelweizen delicious ridiculousness. Caramelized bananas spiced with cloves and dusted with cocoa just jump straight out of the glass, exceptionally flavorful and balanced. Minimal roast with some toffee, honey and toasted wheat bread are present. The palate is like an alcoholic candy bar, and I mean in the most refined and addictive kind of way. Sweet bananas tempered by toasted wheat and a carbonic acidity; a delicate but fresh and clean clove phenolic character balanced by a touch of chocolate; and a mellow hop character with earth pairing beautifully with the spice and sweetness, this beer is outrageously good. Medium light in body, crisp but creamy in carbonation, this beer finishes dry with a blend of banana, clove and cocoa. The wheat huskiness and carbonic acid lend  a cleansing bite to the finish, making this downright quaffable if a hair watery. Still, this is outstanding. Very highly recommended. For under $3 a bottle, it doesn't get better than this."
""
"Very nice. An under-appreciated style and one that is very well done here. Nice complexity and balance here, with an underlying richness that you appreciate as you drink. Bought one bottle, could easily drink another right now."
"Mild, darker malt taste of toast and raw grains. The swallow has a hop presence, but the stronger flavor is of the wheat. Brief sour aftertaste. Thin bodied with a sizable carbonation level."
"A classic taste from an old brewery."
""
"Top dark wheat and great autumn beer."
""
""
""
"O - A very fine dunkel. Right up there with the best."
""
""
""
""
"I finished this beer in no time flat. This is not by any stretch one of my favorite styles, but this beer is probably my benchmark now for the style. It is flat out incredible."
""
""
"Overall a tasty Weissbier."

"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"O: A bit uneven, nice though. The best part is the mix between barley and wheat - very smooth and well balanced."
""
""
"Pleasant dunkelweizen, however I lean towards the brighter weizen of this brand."
""
""
"Overall nice but a bit thin, nice malts, interesting almost steinbier flavors, fairly tasty and very drinkable."
"Body is medium to medium-light, with just a bit of wateriness around the edges. Carbonation is present, but light and effervescent, allowing the beer to feel fairly crisp, and yet foam up a bit on the palate as it travels along. Finish is dry. Generally very drinkable."
""

"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Dunkel weizen."
"O - Well worth a shot"
"this is not a typical Weissbier, in a blind tasting I perhaps would rather have thought of a Rauchbier (although not as rich as Schlenkerla) ... interesting, but not necessarily something I would buy regularly"
"Pours a opaque dark brown color with medium, off-white head. Aroma is wheat, cereals, spice and yeast. Taste is banana, wheat, some slight clove and spice with a roast grains balancing it out. Doughy yeast is also evident. Medium body with a good mouthfeel. Aftertaste is sweet."
"An even mahogany, translucently opaque with a solid ivory head. Huge molasses aroma dominates the smell, with pumpernickel bread on the side and heaping helpings of licorice, raisins, and rum without the burn. Sweetish taste, like a dry, drinkable cinnamon roll, sublimated with nuances of basil, anise, clove, root beer, and some faint banana bread. The carbonation is slightly too sharp, and the body slightly too thin, to carry all these wonderful flavors, but nonetheless this is delicious."
"I wish I could have tried all the Andechser beers at this place but unfortunately could only get through three. Next time..."
"Overall neither the aroma nor the flavors blew me away with this beer although both were very solid. Everything else was solidly above average making this beer well worth a shot."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is dark fruit, yeast and caramel. The flavor is similar with dark fruit, caramel, toffee, yeast, bananas and cloves. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very good dunkelweizen from a very good brewery."
"Notes: Best before 29/09/10. Overall a nice dunkelweizen. WEll balanced and flavorful, all though it was a bit thin. It didn't blow me away, but was a solid beer."
"A great combination of yeast esters, wheat and darker malts. This really comes across as a typical example of the style with al the great flavours I want. A great summer quaffer."
"Once again, Venison with a port wine sauce, or Duck, as the spiciness of this brew would clean the palate nicely with a rich meat. Well done"
"I think for a DW to truly be great, it should stand out like the Wiehenstephan example."
"Tasty brew, quite drinkable."
"OVERALL: Definitely a disappointment. There was just nothing much to this, and what was there wasn't all that great. The scent, beautiful colour, and the little bite at the end were nice, but this one just didn't have the complete package. Won't be looking for it again."
"The beer has a thick head, almost like Guinness from the tap. The beer is very dark, almost black. I could smell cloves and a hint of malt. The initial taste was that of cloves and banana bread, and the aftertaste had a roasted malt character to it. As I drank more of the beer, I noticed more of a chocolate taste."
"A nice example of a rather unusual style; a good wheat beer for the winter nights."
"Definitely not Andechs' most impressive offering, but it confuses me to see average ratings for this brewery's beer. As far as I can tell (and after having drunk most of the Andechs' line) most of their brews are clearly above average."
"Not what I was expecting, a big disappointment to be honest."
"Quite short aftertaste."
"Taste was great without the vegetables and much better balanced. Ripe bananas with some exotic fruit with caramel and dark chocolate. There is also some powdery cocao in taste and mouthfeel, which is also slightly sweet and sticky. The yeast adds a nice phenolic taste and makes the mouthfeel a little coarse (?)"
"BB15-11-06.Cola to coffeeblack beer and a beige head above. Nose is bananas floating around in a sweet wet grass field. Quiet some maltyness but no roast detectable and bit of butter there. Not a bad beer but the whole beer is comming as a mess to me, quiet unbalanced as is taste. Dry and caramellic dont fit together and missing a burnt feeling in a dark beer as this is, though having quiet some bitterness for a wheatbeer as this is. Litle more wheat detectable in taste as in nose but wouldn't give this a weizenbeer when tasted blindly except maybe for the mega bananatree that's right there. Still well drinkable and certainly something else as the regular."
"D: IST GUT!"
"Bham UK"
"Sampled on 10/10/05 at Probka, the beer came out a cloudy caramel brown under 3.5 fingers of thick beige head that lingered throughout the session and left some very nice lacing. The nose is marked by yeast and lemon, but is fairly mild. The mouth is light and very prickly. The taste is mild and characterized by yeast, slightly heavier than a pale, with subtle coriander and fruit. A bit of caramel emerges as it warms, but hops are nowhere to be found. Mild, smooth and nice brew."
"I don't really know what I think about this beer. I guess I just expected more from Andechs on this one. A very dark opaque body, almost black, with a lasting thick bubbly head on top (not exuberantly foamy though). The smell was kinda weak, showing some light bready notes and hints of the traditional weizen styles, with a lot more emphasis on caramel. The taste too, was very caramely for a dunkel weizen, toasted and lamost burnt. The classic bready weizen thing was almost hidden. Mouthfeel was round, but the brew overall lacked of balanced, not fitting right into its style. Not bad, but just nothing in comparison with their doppelbock."
"500 ml bottle, bought in Germany. ABV is 5.0%. Cloudy dark brown colour, enormous thick and creamy light tan head. Lovely aroma of brown bread, yeast, cloves, banana and caramel. Flavour has malts, caramel, chocolate and cloves, some hops in the fairly dry finish. I had it on its own, must be good with food too. A very fine dunkelweizen."
"D - A beer this plain from Andechs? A big surprise for me. I had a bottle fo this and was underwhelmed, so I kept my notes, waited a couple days and rereviewed with consistent notes."
"Drinkabliity: This is a decent beer, but I have had better Dunkel Weizens. I really expected more from Andechs."
"Drinkability: More please!!"
"Props again to joe Rhodes"
"Overall: A good beer but not a great beer worth the drink but nothing to write home about"
"An excellent little wheat dunkle, very smooth, nice chocolatey banana flavour, and even though its dark i thought it was even refreshing, excellent stuff."
