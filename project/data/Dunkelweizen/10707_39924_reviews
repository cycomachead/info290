review_text
"I find this to be strangely alluring and complex. I get a lot of Belgian yeast aromas and flavors of peppercorn, anise and clove. There are some wheat tones, molasses, bubblegum-like sweetness and barley malt. It feels a bit cheap but I like the flavors and diversity of this beer."
""
"The flavor is very nice as well closely following the aroma. All of the flavors could be stronger overall but this beer nails it in the drinkability category. Slightly sweet mouthfeel with decent body. For $5.99 a six pack you really can't go wrong here."
"Smells sweet, wheat, slight banana, fresh fruit. Looks reddish brown. Very opaque. Pours with a nice off white head. Taste is very sweet, bread like. Lots a yeasty flavors. Extremely drinkable. Overall very good beer for the price."

"I was quite surprised by this beer. It's got the traditional appearance, although the head retention and lacing don't live up to the finest Bavarian examples. The body and mouthfeel are what you'd expect as well, although slightly on the thin side. The flavor and aroma are where it stands out: I was expecting a standard dunkelweizen which generally displays less fermentation character than their hefewiezen brethren, but this one's loaded with dark fruit, spicy clove/bubblegum, and banana. It's gently caramelish with a light dollop of honey as well, and it's balanced by a combination of mild bitterness, herbal hops, and its softly spicy and mildly tart yeast. It's certainly not the best expression of the style available, but at the same time given the price it's hard to ignore."
"Aroma is herbs, fruit, hint of spice and roast, and banana. Taste over-the-top sugary-sweet musk, wheat malt, caramel, more of citrus and wheat sourness.  Scant head of white bubbles."

"Fairly typical wheat beer. Generally not a big fan but I didn't enjoy this one much at all"

"O: very impressive and inexpensive version of this German style."

"Quite good. Sweet and banana bready, with a tingly spice-and-carbonation bite in the back end."
""
""
""
"O: This beer lacks a lot of the complexity that I have come to expect for the style, though I guess I should have tempered by expectations based on the pretty low price point for the beer (less than $1 for a single). Easy to drink but not interesting enough to grab again."

"Easy drinking, tasty dunkelweizen."

"More caramel, more banana notes. Malty but quite dry in the finish. Meh, not really as flavorful and complex as the heavy hitters of the style. Easy drinking enough and fairly priced. Worth a try, but nothing special."

"Overall - Maybe not a perfect dunkelweizen, but a darn good one, and one of the better (if only because one of the only?) stabs at the style that I've had from an American brewery. Gordon Biersch sure know their german styles, eh? At $5.99 a sixer, it's a steal. Maybe my go-to beer this summer. We'll see."
""
""
"I can't tell if this was a bad batch or what. Tastes and smells like a sponge that's been sitting in the sink for three weeks. Real metallic bitterness, like if you bit the inside of your cheek and tasted blood tainted by some Amazonian mosquito transferred disease."
""
""
""
""
""
"i will be going back to this one, good for what it is (cheap)"
""
"Body is medium but isn't as thick and chewy as I'd like for this style. Overall the beer isn't bad tho, the banana flavors are making it quite enjoyable for me."

"Good job hippy supermarket dudez."
""
""
"Sour and puke; bottom of the vat? Poured out the whole six-pack. Been enjoying this beer all summer, but sorry Trader Joe's, I'm off my feed for life as far as this beer goes."
""
"This beer was so awful, im just going to get straight to the point. I dumped it out after a few sips. Its way too syrupy tasting and watered down. Did not taste like a wheat beer at all, just tasted like a really bad amber. Almost no carbonation and it smelled like rotten fruit. I rarely dump a beer out but I could not stand this one. I guess that's what I get for buying it for a buck at trader joes."

"O: This beer doesn't have as many complexities in the taste compared to some of the German dunkelweizens, but it is easy to drink and a fair representation of the style. It's a pretty good value for a beer from Trader Joe's."

"A fairly clear ice tea color with just a couple of yellowish bubbles. No retention whatsoever. The nose is of under-ripe banana, roasted malt, butterscotch, caramel, and some cocoa powder. On the palate, butterscotch and caramel roll onto the tongue with banana, cocoa, and some mild roast. The finish is of sweet caramel/butterscotch and banana. LIghter body with medium carbonation. Lingering roast and cocoa. A fairly average dunkle that hits all the style notes but really does nothing for me."
"JosephsBrau Dunkelweizen is a cloudy and lively dark amber beer with a thin, soft, slightly yellow film that leaves nice lacing. It has an aroma of clove, banana, plum and dark malt. It smells pretty spicy and a little sweet-- perfect for this kind of beer! It's medium bodied and quite smooth. The finish isn't very tight and leaves the tongue feeling starchy. Wheat is certainly the dominant flavor. Lemon, clove, stone fruit and an herbal note are present. The flavor isn't as strong as the aroma. There isn't really any bitterness here and the sweetness is barely detectable. This is pretty pleasant. I could have more than one of these."
"warmer: Again, very enjoyable flavor but the coolest thing was simply the DRASTIC change in flavor that I experienced. Loved this beer."
""
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium to dark red-orange amber with a fine two finger off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, banana, butterscotch and cloves. Flavor follows with caramel malt, butterscotch, dark and light stone fruit and clove. Medium bodied. Nice combination of flavors, but a bit sweet and attentuated in the finish. It fits the bill for its intent: a decent, pleasant dunkelweizen at a good price point."
"The Verdict: Not bad. I’m not familiar with the style, but if you were looking for a banana flavored Hefe, this would be it. I won’t reach for this first when I head to Trader Joe’s, but I won’t turn it down if you offer me one, either."
""
""
""

""
""
"Got this in a home made beer advent calendar and I didn't realize this was Trader Joe's Brand. It pours a cloudy deep red/brown with thin head. The aroma is sweet, ripe banana, with malty dark fruit. The nice banana estery character in the flavor fades a bit too quickly into thin malt. Overall there are some nice things going on in this beer and it's a nice change of pace from the hop bombs I've been drinking, but it falls a bit flat."
""

""
""
"For the price of $1 a bottle this is pretty decent I'd take some of these tailgating certainly better than the bmc stuff."
""
""
" A bit on the sweet side, and a touch full. Lacks complex yeast esters of the more notable brands."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't realize that ""Joseph Brau"" was their own beer till now. Still, I commend Trader Joe's for offering Bavarian beers, and give the store a thumbs up.I may have gotten an off sixer, as the other reviews seem to like it."
"Taste throws more banana than cloves and the chocolate is light, but noticeable. Malts are pretty light overall and the carbonation is nice and fluffy. This is not too shabby of a brew, Id be happy to drink this again...and is probably a leading candidate for 'best value dunkelweiss'. Im having a tough time coming up with anything decent for less than $8 a sixer...maybe Michelob's DunkelWeisse is the closest."

"O: Pretty damn average on all counts, but there's a modicum of enjoyment to be found here. It's cheap as hell, so it's still definitely worth a look."
""
"O: Not great, but a solid Dunkelweizen, and better than most made outside of Germany. It's also reasonably priced (for which I gave it an extra half point), so I'll be getting more of this in the future."
""

"Hands down this is the best Dunkelweizen I have ever tasted for only $5.49 a six pack! I am impressed"
""
""
"Overall I found this to be a good beer and a great value, at around $6.50 for a six pack."
"C"
""
""
"Overall: Though my thoughts are contrary to many others, this one is a nice dunkelweizen which stays true to the style which some venture away from."
""
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy brown color, produced a average white head. Average retention and it left some lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of ripe banana and fresh baked bread. Medium in body, this Dunkelweizen consisted of sweet malted wheat, and banana. Overall it is an average example of the style, dont regret drinking a glass but i wont seek it out in the future. Prost!"
""
"O- For the price this is an outstanding beer. This is similar in taste to Sprecher Hefe Weiss but a much better deal. I will have this one again."
""
""
"o: While I thought this beer was decent, I probably won't be reaching for another. While I think it was brewed pretty much to style, there was a bit too much vanilla esters in the flavor to my liking. I thought it took away from the other fruity and potentially spicy esters. Maybe they could try a different yeast that would have so much of a vanilla profile."
""
""

"A surprisingly good dunkel for not a lot of cash. Appearance is a cloudy brown with orangey highlights. Nice tan head that fades to a light covering that stays. A touch of lace here and there. Active carbonation is working all the way down. Smell is where starts to impress. It is full of overripe banana and clove. There is some nice malted wheat that cuts through and a lovely yeast ester that works a little bit of alcohol and pepper. Taste is again a really solid effort. All the flavors you want and previewed in the nose wrapped in a banana bread with raisins. Wheat malt gives a solid core. Finish is mild as it should be, slightly tart apples creep in with a darn near perfect balance that leaves more banana and clove and a mild floral hop bitterness. Feel is light and crisp with a lightly tingly carbonation. Light creaminess. Super drinkable and my new winter session brew. At $6.50 a six this is a stupendous value. If you like dunkel and you are feeling the tight economy buy a six of this and put your cares aside for a while."
""
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 2 inch fizzy khaki head that settles to a thin film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, dark fruit, banana, spices, and yeast. A nice caramel/toffee smell comes about as the beer warms. Taste is of dark fruit and banana up front followed by spice and yeast flavors. The dark malt flavor comes through on the aftertaste and provides a slightly bready taste. This beer has only a slight level of carbonation and seems a bit sticky/syrupy. Overall, this is a pretty good dunkelweizen but it smells better than it tastes. Also a deal at $1 a bottle."
""
""
"O: I actually like this beer. Buck a bottle, you really cant beat it."
""
"Overall, I didn't really appreciate this beer. For a dunkelweizen, it seemed to be lacking several characteristic odors and flavors that I do enjoy and miss when not found. I probably wouldn't seek this out again, though their hefeweizen was much truer to style."
"Decent for this style, and for a cheap Trader Joe's beer. But, I think I'll stick to other styles at Trader Joe's, as I much prefer other Dunkelweizens."
"O: Another solid Trader Joe's beer. At the same price as BMC I really can't complain with a B- beer."
""
"medium brown pour with a slight reddish touch to the sides yielded a nice head of off white that stuck to the sides of the glass fairly well as it trickled down. aroma is nice and earthy with touches of roasted nuts and caramel coming through as it warms. nice deep flavor, nothing over the top but nice and consistent for the style, about what i would expect from them. deep sweet malts are driven home in the finish"
"12 oz single from Trader Joes, Salem store. $1.20 slighly murky hazelnut brown beer with a small dissapating off white head. Spicy,phenolic and slightly sour aromas..the our is a concern seeing how crappily TJs take ""care"" of their beers. Happily it is not a problem..there is a slight sourness, which is unusual for style but it works against the spices and bubble gum well..semi sweet wheatiness..actually very nice. OK on the tongue..not to thin and to style. Overall a very nice sour wheat beer!"
"Aroma is strong and malty with a firm fruity overtone that is mainly apple with a shade or two of banana. It pours a hazy, barely transparent mahogany-gold with a thick, if not too persistent, ivory head. Malty, fruity flavor is quite pleasing and refreshing with a hint of yeast. Smooth, firm-bodied texture has a decent amount of fizz. Overall, a rather nice beer."
""
""
"A decent beer and for $1 a bottle it's holy crap good."
"Three finger head that dissipates down pretty quickly. Nose is a nice banana-pink bubble gum stick with spicy cloves. Sweet wheat malty in flavor with a nice spicy finish. Has a bit of a watery mouth-feel, could use a bit more bubble and body. Nice fresh tasting brew though. I would recommend!"
"Overall: Was this a bad bottle? This was atrociously bad - I drank just enough of the bottle to ascertain the relevant information and poured the rest."
"O - An interesting flavor."
"Pours a rich, deep amber color. Smells fabulous -- I detected honey, cloves, and other spices that almost gave it a floral smell. It doesn't taste too bad, either -- pleasantly spiced, with a rich and complex flavor. Somewhere between the smell and taste I got a hint of banana, I think. It's a very curious, aromatic beer. I think I'll definitely be trying it again."
"O - Overall, it's a pretty decent dunkelweizen, and quite a bargain in the price to quality ratio. Craft beer at BMC price is always welcome in my book."
"all in all, drinkable, but not the best example of the style. but for the price, certainly not bad. I'd consider picking up a pack again, but not exactly one I'd seek out."
"O: This is a solid dunkelweizen and for the price, it is well worth it. If you're in a frugal state of mind, this isn't a bad way to go."
"I would say this is a perfect beer to be enjoyed, perhaps with a meal, but not to cool off with or drink quickly."
"Poured a hazy amber- head/lacing were nothing special. Smelled great, very sweet, with the obvious banana and other sweet notes, as well as spices including cinnamon. Taste was also sweet, but was less complex than other varieties, focusing more and the fruit notes than anything else. Maintained a pretty high level of carbonation through finishing the glass. Smooth, with a bit of stickiness. There are better dunkelweizens out there, but as far as the price to quality ratio goes, this is likely the best."
"Compared to other dunkelweizens that I have had, this one drinks more like a traditional hefe than most. If I had one complaint, that would be it. However, it's very tasty and for the price point, you really just cannot go wrong."
"O - For $6/6-pack this actually is a pretty good beer. The aroma and taste are right to spec just nothing too intense and nothing overdone. A solid above average beer."
"Pours a light caramel brown color with an aggressive, foamy beige head that doesn't last too long. The aroma is sweet but not dense, with a combination of brown sugar and ripe bananas being most apparent. These characteristics continue through into the flavor, but there is also more of a yeasty earthiness, along with a light milk caramel character. The medium body and light carbonation allows each layer of the sweet malty profile to make its mark. Overall, I would consider this beer to be a bit too sweet, but not so much that it becomes a chore to drink. Rather, I would call it pleasantly over-sweetened."
"M: The sweetness it not present but at some point you feel some bitterness that last in the back of the mouth."
"O - overall, a decent dunkelweizen. Especially for the price, an outstanding value, but I liked the beer less as I got to the end of it - the flatness didn't really help here."
"T: Lots of banana and a bit of clove with a bit of nuttiness and a hint of roasted malt. Something slightly citrus-like and lemony towards the finish. Not my favorite of the Trader Joes beers."
"Overall: A very solid dunkel and one of the best values you can find for the price."
"This is a slightly above average interpretation of the style. For the price, it is a good beer to have on hand when you want something other than another pale ale or IPA."
"My expectations were that Dunkelweizen Amber Unfiltered Wheat Beer would be a darker (but otherwise similar) version of Hefeweizen, though that didn't turn out to be the case. This is a lovely version that packs a lot of flavor punch in a $1 single. A several bottle purchase on all future trips to Trader Joe's is a no-brainer."
"Quality beer and the right price."
"Very drinkable and very enjoyable - and at a great price to boot!"
"Watching a somewhat surprisingly good game here between the Cards and the Pads, I figured I'd grab a beer, and this is what came out of the fridge. It pours a generally clear sunset amber topped by just under a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light corn, mild rye bread, light black pepper, and just a pinch of nutmeg. The taste darkens the wheat, slightly sours the rye a bit, and seems to pour on the black pepper as though 'twere going out of style. I don't know about anyone else, but there are times where I find the pepper a bit o'erwhelming. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly prickly feeling, though this comes more from the peppery-ness than the carbonation. Overall, I think this could have been a pretty good dunkelweizen, but something went awry at some point in the process. A definite disappointment."
"Slam-dunk for $5.99 a six-pack. There are few beers that are this inexpensive that taste this good, which fits Trader Joe's motif nicely. Another session beer for me."
"Poured a nice orange-amber-brownish color with some beige head on it. Sweet malt aroma with some fruit coming through. Great tasting beer. I really enjoyed it. Not too heavy, hint of smokiness. Medium bodied mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable beer. I could definitely see myself having a handful of these no problem."
"WOW! For $5.75 a sixer, this is a really good beer! I'd happily pay $7.75 for a sixer of this! I wish I got another...."
"Then again, it was $6 a sixer. Recommended to try; maybe I got an older bottle. Nice job TJ's for doing a seldom-had style on the cheap."
"D - goes down easy."
"From fall brew ranking notes (2010): The aroma is loaded with banana and moderate bubblegum. There's a hint of roast, but the banana is pretty dominant. It pours a cloudy brownish-orange with a small off-white head. The flavor starts with strong banana. There's a faint roastiness in the background. The finish has bubblegum and some tangy wheat flavors. Medium bodied moderate carbonation and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel."
"D) OK but nothing spectacular. Middle of the road. Can't get past the smoke flavor so I'll likely pass on this in the future."
"Drinkability: Very high. If you like the banana quality of German hefeweizens, I implore you to head to Trader Joe's and try this beer. At only $5.99 a six pack, it is something that can be afforded on a regular basis as well."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, especially for the price, a great picnic or lawnmower beer."
"This beer is a very dark amber, almost brown color. Quite cloudy and a thick not-quite-dark-enough-to-be-tan colored head. The aroma is sweet and a little spicy, with banana and fruitcake like scents. It's light-medium bodied and quite smooth. The flavor is very similar to the aroma. It basically tastes like liquid banana bread but it's not overly sweet. Quite a good dunkelweizen. An incredible beer for the cost!"
"Taste is unmistakably hefe, not a heck of a lot of body with this one, but very smooth and super easy on the palate. I don't care for super hoppy tart beers, and this fits the bill perfectly. In fact, this would make a very refreshing beverage on a hot summer day - PERFECT for barbecues with friends!"
"Pours a translucent amber-darkbrown body with a small head dwindling down to a thin film of lacing sitting on the body. Smells distinctly of citrus (particularly lemon), rye bread and, of course, lager yeast. Tastes of yeast (strongly), has a dark malty sweetness following carbonation and has a slight hop feel throughout. Overall, quite a nice beer in the dunkelweizen style and a brew I would easily go back to."
"Overall: As I mentioned before, this beer is a nice change of pace in the wheat category."
"D) Easy to drink. I don't love it and am not too familiar with the style."
"12oz bottle from TJ's. Pours cloudy brown with tanned long lasting head. The aroma of bananas, caramel, and brown sugar. Medium-bodied . The flavor of bananas and brown sugar, very cloying. Also lightly tart. The finish is long and sweet. On the whole, is not bad. Too much sweetness though"
"A thick, dense head on this malty Bavarian-style unfiltered hefe, with a nice scent of caramel, clove, and banana. The taste is bold and roasty with hints of buttery biscuit and clove - spicy and tangy. Not bad, but I found this one somewhat lacking in balance, with perhaps a tad too much of the spiced element."
"My advice - for $5.99 a sixer this is hard to beat. No. Unbeatable."
"Not a bad Dunkelweizen but not my favorite of the style. A little on the light side for the style and the color and aroma are a little light but in general it was pretty good. I'll buy it again."
"Brown color with tan head. Not much in the nose: some clove and fruitiness, but a bit muddled. Taste is very good though. Fruit flavors abound with grape, date, banana, green apple. Mild clove with a general sweetness - light on the hops. Smooth wheat body, however a bit fizzy. Very good beer overall, with interesting taste. Wouldn't easily tire of it."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and somewhat rich. Drinkability is good. Just right abv and good flavor. I will buy more of this one!"
"Drinkability: Not the best dunkelweizen overall, but very good as far as American interpretations go. This one was definitely a pleasant surprise, very true to the style and definitely enjoyable."
"I wasn't expecting a true Germanic version of a dunkelweiss, and that's what I got. However, it's better than some American labled wheats, pale or dark. The price won't kill you, as it's $5.99 a six pack."
"D - Very drinkable dunkel. ABV is certainly manageable. Flavors are smooth, well integrated. Only knock is that it is lightly filling as I approach the bottom of the glass."
"Very refreshing and interesting, but not quite on par with their ""Bavarian Hefeweizen"" (also brewed by Gordon Biersch I believe). Still, a good value and a tasty summer beer..."
"Mouthfeel is pretty strong, this has a very well rounded feel to it, sharp but not to sharp, flows easily which leads me to drinkabliity. It is very good, with fall aproaching, I dont think this will be the last bottle I will purchase, there should be a few more."
"Drinkability: This style is a toughie to hide faults in, so I'm not surprised a get a bit of them in the final product. However it's not all that bad and if you're a malt hound this one will fit the bill. For $5.99 it's not all that bad."
"Drinkability: This is not a bad-drinking brew, and it's worked admirably as a thirst-quencher for me today, but I certainly wouldn't make a session out of this, even with it's low alcohol. I may be fooling myself, but I could almost swear I could taste some alcohol in this one."
"D - Good stuff! I'd buy this again in a heartbeat. Good beer at a very reasonable price. Trader Joe's offers some really good stuff for less than $6 per six pack!"
" ~ This brew is not the most friendly. For its light body it is still rather difficult to get down. I don't think I'll be looking for this one in the future."
"Overall: Overall it's a decent beer. My bottle tasted slightly old, but I could tell what the beer was saying."
"Lovely beer for a massive value."
"I'm not disappointed at all! I'm rather impressed actually. For $5.99 a six pack this is a bargain as well as a decent beer in it's own right."
"I like one once in a while since I don't see many of this style, but TJ's Hefewizen is a better beer for more frequent quaffing, I think. And of course the price is hard to beat."
"Murky brown color with a thin tan head. Nose is strong but very one dimensional, with banana and clove doing all the work. The flavor is even more so, with overripe (nearly rotten) banana overtaking the cloves and other spices for dominance. A little metallic from this bottle. the mouthfeel is too thin to be good, but it's not bad. A prick of carbonation and alcohol on the finish is a healthy reminder that it is a beer. Drinkability will vary but in my opinion it is too sweet and one-dimensional to be considered a very good beer."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Hazy brown color, surprised to see that this is unfiltered. Decent beige head, not as fizzy as other TJs beers. Aroma is big on banana oil and clove, with a clear milk chocolate note as well. Flavor is similar, Cocoa and bread with a lot of sweet banana and bubblegum and a light clove note. All the flavors that should be there are there but I'm not convinced they're in the right proportion. Too heavy on the sweetness. Body is medium, so is carbonation. A pretty good beer for TJs."
"I do like dunkelweizen, just not this one."
"Pours a murky brown with a thing white head that fades leaving no lacing. Aromas are of slight fruity banana and clove. The taste is rather muted, but still holds some of the style characteristics that match the aroma. The mouth feel is light which holds to easy drinking and session quality. This isn't what I want in a dunkel weizen, but at $1.00, who can complain? Buy it, but don't think too long and hard about it. Share this with a Newcastle Brown or a Blue Moon drinker that might want to cross over into craft."
"D - Pretty drinkable wheat brew, sweet flavored, a little on the heavy side but even's out. My first brew from Trader Joe's, pretty tasty brew for such a cheap price. I good beer for those wanting to try the style."
"One bottle of a mixed-sixer I received from my parents for my 26th birthday."
"I don't have a Trader Joe's in my area and I've heard they have pretty good beer and they were right... and at a buck a beer !!! You cannot go wrong.... Go check out Trader Joe's and give this stuff a try...."
"Drinkability- A bit lower on the carbonation and a touch more flavor and this would be top notch. Very good job by an American brewer."
"Murky, dark brown, caramel color, like apple cider with a retentive light brown head and dots of lacing. Very strong aroma, mild sweetness, bananas, cloves, yeast, etc. Not that complex, but pleasant. Smooth, full body with sharp carbonation (almost too much) with a very strong banana and yeast flavored bodied. Mild sweetness in the finish, not much spiciness. You get what you pay for here, not the best Dunkel or even best of some of the Trader Joe label beers, but one of my favorites since this is a style I enjoy and this represents it well."
"Drinkability: Oh, sweet nectar. It's not the best dunkelweizen I've had, and not as impressive as TJ's Bavarian Style Hefeweizen, but it's decent. It's good drinking, but not mind blowing."
"D- easy to finish, and a great value considering the cost. something ill be drinking more of this summer. check this one out if you find yourself in a trader joes."
"D - One of the better Trader Joe's brews. It really seemed authentic."
"Drinkability: decent beer."
"Overall its a nice dunkelweizen for the money. Wheats for the most part are just not my thing though so I probably wouldn't purchase again."
"It's really not a bad dunkelweizen, especially for a buck a bottle. Simple, but not boring, and probably easy to session. (And, much to my surprise, my girlfriend enjoyed it. Gateway beer? Let's hope)."
"Bought at Trader Joes it seems that this dunkel is brewed by Gordon Biersch out of CA. The head seemed to dissipate rather quickly for a wheat. Aromas of clove, banana and a total polyphenol explosion in the mouth. Drinkable, not as dark for a dunkel as I would like but for the uninitiated in this style it may be worth a try."
"My wife, who usually hates hefes, actually enjoyed this, so that that as a good sign or a bad sign :)"
"Cloudy, light chestnut with a really small, off white head that leaves some fine lace on the glass. Smells of overripe banana, clove and citrus. Tastes of gingerbread and citrus,decent and typical for the style. Medium light bodied with a fairly lively carbonation. Nothing to write home about, just above average beer. Good quaffer."
"A surprisingly good beer. There are definitely better dunkels out there, but this is quite good and easily accessible, if you have a Trader Joe's where you live."
"Any wow factor this beer had was in the smell and look if it. An enjoyable dunkelweizen but, not the best."
"This is right on par with the other GB Dunkelweizen, so close I'm going to drink the other right now. What a bargain price and it's OK to mix and match at TJs."
"D: Great drinkability. And a fantastic beer for the price. Pick some up the next time you're at trader joe's."
"Alone, this Trader Joe's beer was a little bit above average for a Dunkelweizen. What separates this above average average beer from the others is this beer's low price. I believe I only paid $1 for this beer. Better yet, it's really good too. Would I drink this beer again? I sure would and you should too. If you got a pocket full of change you want to spend, then you might as well buy a bottle of this beer."
"Poured into 12oz glass. Poured with a small, tan head that quickly dissipated, leaving no lacing. A very cloudy, almost muddy, medium brown. Very bold aroma, a lot of banana and clove in the nose. The flavor also has noticeable banana and clove, with a hint of spice. Has a quick, sharp bite on the finish. The body is a little on the thin side, but not detrimentally so. Solidly drinkable, I can see myself drinking more of these as the weather warms. This a Trader Joes house brand, and I find it to be a solid value. A basically average beer for the style, for $6.00 a 6er, I think I'll explore the rest of TJs house brews."
"D: Excellent session beer. I enjoyed the taste and my friends loved it. A great compromise for the beer aficionado and the beer newbie. Will definitely buy this again."
"D: I would have liked to rank this higher except for the really bad metallic finish and aftertaste."
"Drinkability: Despite an initially promising beginning based upon a great smell, this beer failed to perform. Once again, like so many Trader Joe's stuff, not a drain pour, but nothing that exciting."
"Pours an extremely cloudy brown with a tinge of amber and a small off-white head that doesn't linger. Some folks here are calling it ""muddy"" but I happen to like this beer considerably and prefer to compare its appearance to that of the darker unpasteurized apple ciders. Powerful clove aroma, with bananas and tons of yeast on the nose. The taste is simpler than it could be but is good nonetheless. Wheaty and carmelized malts come through loud and clear. The creamy texture and medium-heavy feel of this brew are extremely appealing. Easily my favorite of the beers made by Gordon Biersch for Trader Joe's. An excellent deal."
"Pours a cloudy brown/amber color. There's a small head with poor retention and only slight lacing. A sweet malt smell (almost fruity). A little too much malt in my opinion for a dunkelwiesse. A chewy mouth feel with excellent carbonation and a very slight bitter aftertaste (grassy). Overall a beer worth trying, but that slight aftertaste hold it back from being a very good beer."
"D - this was a well-crafted dunkelweizen. I was very pleasantly surprised by this one. I know I will picking up a lot of these in the future."
"Cloudy dark brown, plenty of yeast and foam. Rich malt, slightly tart with bread, banana, clove, vanilla. Richer mouthfeel than the hefeweizen as should be expected. Very drinkable and a great U.S.-brewed example of the style. You can't beat the price/quality ratio of this beer."
"Drinkability: Along with the Hefeweizen, for a buck you can't go wrong with this beer if you want to pick up a pretty good version of the style as far as a domestic goes. Lots to admire here from right out of the fridge until room temperature and beyond, at least as far as I'm concerned."
"Jk"
"D - Very drinkable but not terribly exciting."
"The Dunk was dark, as well as more rich than the Bavarian, but it did not match the complexity of flavors at all."
"The taste is almost all bubblegum-dominated whole wheat at first. The bubblegum subsequently mellows slightly to allow other flavours to become more prominent, but this is mostly just the unpleasantly tangy bittersweet taste of damp whole wheat bread. Even so, the bubblegum quality still stays too strong throughout as well. More full-bodied than some, it has strong enough flavour but it does not appeal to me at all."
"It's a Schneider."
"D- Honestly a pretty great beer from trader joe's for a decent price. This is one beer I'm going to have to pick up in the future."
"Pulpy, cloudy, dark caramel brown. Gold around the edges. Tall, rocky, whipped, light beige head. Wheaty nose of fresh bread, mushy bananas, banana bread, plums, toffee, and cloves. Nice. Tangy wheat malt flavors up front. Hints of toffee and bread pudding as well. Banana and banana bread flavors settle in along with some pear and clove. Yeasty, spicy hop finish with lingering wheat bread and fruit sweetness. Medium-bodied with a hefty, protein-rich feel. Pretty damn good--especially for 5.99 a six pack."
"Sweet ripe banana and clove on the nose with a distinctive lemon malty scent. Taste is slightly malty rich and has decent depth, more body than expected. A spicy carbonated finish yields a bit of cinnamon and clove. Carbonation is about right given the structure of the beer and offers decent drinkability though the sweetness may become a bit too much after a few. Tastes like a nice accompaniment to Thanksgiving dinner."
"Pours a murky brown with a medium head that dissipates quickly and leaves nice lacing on the surface. The aroma is mild and pretty typical dunkel- cloves, dark fruit, bananas. Taste is low sweetness. Lots of wheat tang. Some caramel notes. Cloves and spice. Dry finish. Medium bodied. Fairly drinkable. Surprisingly good for trader joe's especially for this style."
"Not on the caliber of a Weistehephaner but far better and more drinkable/pleasurable than Slam Dunkel."
"Drinkability: Not bad but I do not think I would buy it again."
"Drinkability: Personally, I didn't care for this one at all and was asked repeatedly to stop glaring at the bottle. I'm glad unclemattie dug it though."
"It's not bland or flavorless...but is that the best I can say about this dunkelweizen? It just can't compete with so many of the German-brewed classics. Killed by stiff competition, basically. Still amazes me that the vast majority of U.S. brewers can't seem to master the hefe-weizen style...dunkel or otherwise."
"pours a nice and cloudy amber color with a big white head. smells are all over the place, a spicy yeast dominates the flavor, almost has a rasberry taste and flavor too. its an easy drinking beer, the spicy yeastiness is more profound than alot of other hefe's"
"D- Although it is not super heavy, I don't think I'd drink it all day, but could definitely have 2 or 3 in a row."
"Too sweet to be a contender. I won't be repurchasing this again."
"Aroma is very nice indeed. Some banana, wheat, and yeast. Taste has some zesty spice to it, in addition to the banana, cloves, and wheaty malt backing. Mouthfeel is way to thin, but it's a drinkable, solid lager."
"D'ability - Very easy drinking as should be. The slight off-flavor (copper penny) is the only item that keeps me from giving this one a major thumbs up. But another winning wheat beer at TJ for about $6/six pack. You can do a hell of a lot worse!"
"I'm glad a company like Trader Joe's puts a style like this on their shelves. Keep up the good work and spread the craft beer!"
"I've never had this style of beer before, so I'm not quite sure what it is supposed to taste like. The look is cool - very cloudy, dark brown. Aromas are just like any wheat beer with banana and bread at the forefront. There is a slight roasted tone as well, maybe that's the amber coming through? The flavor here is lacking, however. Not really a wheat and not an amber with the taste of neither. The mouthfeel is watery with decent carbonation. Not a great beer - maybe the properties of each style cancels the other out? Not recommended."
"Could not beat the price so I decided to buy one, not usually too big of a fan of these beers but this was slightly above average, possibly would drink again, worth trying mostly because it is so inexpensive"
"Bought one bottle at trader joes. Did not have the foaming characteristics of a Wiehenstephaner.It did however have that banana bread aroma and taste. Mouthfeel is good, about the right carbonation but feels a bit soda like, not quite luxurious as the style should have. This is a unique style for a bargain beer. Very nice brew and I will try the others, this I will buy again."
"This beer was pretty decent, but I really don't think it fit the dunkelweizen category. Poured a cloudy amber with a nice bit of head, smelled typical of a weizen with clovey, banana overtones. Tasted like a decent hefeweizen, with maybe a touch of roasted flavors but honestly if I wasn't going out of my way to look for them I might not have noticed. Basically, It's a nice tasting hefeweizen that is darker for some reason; it really doesn't have enough dark malt flavor to be considered a dunkel. But for the price, a nice beer, just think of it as a hefe."
"Thanks for the bottle, Jen!"
"Not bad + well worth the price we paid."
"The flavor could be better, but it's definately not without its merit. Citrusy, wheaty, yeasty Hefe notes form the backbone, while a bit of pale chocolate and caramel malts add a nice complexity. The label's proclaimed ""roasted malts", however, I found to be lacking. Mouthfeel is creamy and zesty at the same time, with a well-carbonated body and medium-light thickness. All in all, a pretty solid brew for the always cheap, $1 Trader Joe's lineup. I'd consider having this again."
"The flavor was alright. Plenty of dunkel beer sweetness but it was a bit over the top. There was also a little german hefe yeast banana quality in the flavor. It was nice and smooth and drinkable but the flavor wasn't anything special. I'd drink it again if it was free."
"Drinkability> very easy to drink."
"Its not bad, and the more I smells it, the more I likes it. Not the best example of the style though and I find it hard to have more than one or two."
"Bought this at Trader Joes. Cannot beat the price, was about 4.99 for a six pack. Pour is a cloudy brown color, looks very similar to german dunkels. I've had some mixed results with Trader Joes beer, ranging from ok to good. This one I would say is quite good.Especially for the price. Doesn't compare to German Dunkeweizens but it is one of the better US dunkels I've had. I definitely recommend this, especially for the price. Recommend picking up a six pack and giving it a try."
"single bottle from TJ's Cary"
"trader joes has done much better with their other value-conscious brews. i guess you win some, you lose some."
"This is tolerable, especially for the price, but if I can get Ayinger or Weihenstephaner than there's really no reason to drink this."
"Easier to drink than its heffe- counterpart due to less sweetness."
"This beer surprised me with how tasty it was. It might not be the most versatile beer to pair with food, but it was quite good by itself. At less than $6 for a sixer, it's a great deal. Price often factors into my drinkability score, and it's definitely reflected here."
"Poured a hazy burnished dark copper with a creamy tan head that had excellent retention and left a good bit of lacing up and down the glass. Faint banana bread smell -- not a huge nose presence. The taste was also a big dose of banana bread and bubble gum, a lot like the TJ's hefeweizen (which I always thought was a fun-house caricature of a hefe). Pretty much indistinguishable, actually, from the hefe, except for the appearance. Mouthfeel was medium-to-light bodied with decent carbonation. One goes down easy, but the intense banana and bubble gum with a complete lack of hop presence to balance things makes this a little much for sessioning."
"All in all, a very good beer, and for the price, an excellent deal. Just wished it were a tab bit fresher."
