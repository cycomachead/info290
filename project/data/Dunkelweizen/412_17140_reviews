"Prost!"
"I found this to be very delicious.  Doesn't taste like a weizen at all.  Rich, roasty, smooth and delicious.  Amazing inch plus head that doesn't shrink as you drink.  This is a luxurious dark beer.  Highest recommendation."

"Pours a very dark brown if not a bitch black as you can't see through it. Has a good 3-finger foamy creamy thick beige head that settles down to a good 3+mm near the end of the drink. A good amount as well as sediment is seen in the bottom of the glass as well as in the bottom of the bottle. On the label it says ""Hefe-weizen must be drunk from the glass-never from the bottle"". No problem there. The aroma is of wheat with some hop aromas. The taste is even better than the aroma and has some sweet toffee and brown sugar in the mix as well. Very pleasant and goes down very easy. A tasty brew with medium body and perfect carbonation. A great brew!"

"Great beer. It was like a great Schwarzbier but with the added flavors and tickle of a great Weizen. Almost like Monchof Schwarzbier made love to some Vitus and had a healthy offspring. I had it in a glass as always, but it was funmny to read the text on the back which read something to the tune of: ""Hefe-weissbier should always be enjoyed from a glass, never the bottle"". Looked nice and dark with substantial aromatic head. Carbonation was nice and the drinking was refreshing. Good stuff."

"Overall: Really easy drinking but nothing about this beer really grabs the drinker. Overall malt sweetness really makes itself known throughout."

"Slightly different than a Dunkelweizen and not quite a full Schwarzbier, but firmly in the middle. The bottle was one of those cool German flip tops that made a loud pop when I opened it. It poured an opaque dark brown with a full head with great retention. Overall the palate was light and thin for such a dark beer and the flavor was subtle with roasted malt, caramel and a bit of wheat. The flavors became more pronounced and complex as it warmed. This was definitely a lighter beer than I was expecting, but a solid German beer nonetheless and highly drinkable."

"If I didn't know better I'd swear there was some oats in this brew. It's creamy and varied in flavor/aroma. And it's not too heavy. One of the best Weizens I've had in a long time."

"O: If I didn't look at the label I would have guessed this as a straight Schwarzbier. Not bad, but I do like the esters the come through with hefe yeasts which i didn't get in this beer."

"A fairly decent beer, tastes authentic but not really a favorite style of mine."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is balanced, zesty-winy, roasty grain (gentle but long-lasting), not strong but well-rounded and very engaging, a little like a schwarzbier."

"Pours an opaque, murky dark brown-black with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and some slight cocoa bean aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, burnt coffee, and slight cocoa bean flavors. There is a very mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smell is somewhat lacking compared to the taste."
"RJT"
"Thinner than I expected. Good carbonation, quite drinkable. Overall it's a decent beer, but nothing to write home about. Probably won't get one again, but would drink it if someone offered me one."
""
"Overall: This is a great, tasty beer. It's sweet, but not too sweet. Nice blend of tastes. I'm impressed."
"Notes: This is amazing very drinkable anda very smooth finish. Cheers."
"Dark, rich looking like a stout. Surprised how thin it tastes, almost watery. It certainly looks like the type of dark beer for a cold winter's night, but the taste is closer to a thin pilsner or even a Hefe. It just felt like it was missing that richness a dark beer usually delivers. Even so, I thought it was pretty enjoyable, and is great if you want a dark beer without that dark beer weight in taste. But it can be deceptive if you want a dark beer and all the elements a dark, heavy beer delivers."
""
"Poured a half inch beige head which faded fast. Dark raw umber brown body, almost coffee. Smells of malt and bready yeast. The tast is an interesting combo with roasted malt, cola, sour rye, even a little tart fruit. There's an interesting acidic sour zing which reminds me of the start of a mild sour beer. The body seems creamy like a stout yet is very light. Finish is fairly long. I was really pretty impressed."
""
"O: A bit uneven beer, but drinkable nonetheless."
"Its...dark chocolate both in color and in primary aroma, one finger foamy white head with really amazing retention time. Holding the glass up close to a light source reveals that there is actually a remarkable lack of sediment for something so chewy and toothsome in texture. Smell mostly like a turbo charged chocolate malt and very little of the expected banana bread. It may have been mentioned before, but this beer really DOES smell more like a Schwarz profile (chocolate, chicory, roastiness and a certain level of acridness) and taste more like the cloven banana bread of a Weizen profile. Not that I'm saying that the Schwarz-like flavors aren't there, they just push back further into the background while the wheat comes forward for a turn. Its really odd how they take turns on your tongue like that. Body is well carbonated, medium thick, and manages to remain refreshing for it despite the relative boldness of the flavors contained within. Well worth trying just on novelty factor alone, but also exhibits some real care and craftsmanship behind the scenes. Straight 4's across the board."
"Blackbier, the literal traslation from German. There is no mistaking this Bier for anything else. I am normally a fan of dark bier, and the one was very good, but the only thing is it really is black as night and it a bit more challenging for me to drink because of that. If you say the blacker the better, than buy this!!"
""
"The feel can use a bit more bubble to cleanse the palate and give more weizen character. Other-weiz this is a nice beer with a bit of a twist on the style"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this variation on the weissbier theme. The components were unique and enjoyable. One I would drink again."
"D- Quite enjoyable, but nothing special."
""

"Mouthfeel is rather light and bubbly but finishes nicely. Overall, Kapuziner is a excellent authentic German weizen but it still leaves you wanting a bit more."
"Pours black with a somewhat slight head that fades t a ring and leaves just the barest lacing. Smells bready, with a slight tang of the grain, and a note of caraway. A very light beer, one of the lighter dark beers I've had. The problem here is that there is a slight (very slight) roastiness, which doesn't add a lot to the beer in itself, but does negate any yeasty flavors, and once again there aren't a lot. For me, one of the great pleasures of a German wheat beer are the esters from the yeast with it's hallmark flavors of banana and clove, set against the backdrop of the soft wheat. Unfortunately I don't get that here at all, and there is no great roastiness or maltiness to compensate. Easy to drink, but doesn't hold my interest."
"A good dunkel and would drink more no problem."
"D - Flavors aren't the usual German wheat beer taste such as clove and banana. Still, the beer is enjoyable, clean and refreshing."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a large tan head. Smells of roasted malts, coffee and brown sugar. The feel is sort of light. The taste is also a little light, I get lots of coffee and a little roasted malts but its also a little watery. Overall not bad but I expected a little more from the look."
"This ones is subtle, yet aggresive and packed with different nuances to be discovered. A solid beer yet not great."
"O: Not a good example of what beer can be."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is full of wheat with some light chocolate and banana notes. I get some classic German yeast in the aroma as well. The flavor is full of chocolate and wheat. I don't get any banana or spice notes in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent dunkelweizen but there are better ones out there."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit and prefer it to Kapuziner Weissbier."
"O/D - I wouldn't seek it out to be honest. It's pretty run of the mill but worth a shot if you're into the heferoos."
"Not entirely hateful, but this is not what I want in the style. What was there was ok, but missing a ton."
"This is much darker and drier than most Dunkelweizen. I can see where it gets it's ""Schwarz"" moniker. Overall a decent beer, though the standard Kapuziner Hefeweizen is far better."
"Overall, it looks good and smells good, but seriously lacks flavour."
"Opinion: Well, this is my first beer of the night, so this may be influencing my opinion, but I have enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I like the malt balance compared to the yeast, and the fact that even though the beer is opaque, you don't get any harshness or acidity from the dark malts. All this said, I doubt that I will be buying this beer much more when there is Kostritzer out there that, IMO, is superior to this beer. Though they are different ""technology", agreed, but they are similar enough that I would use the descriptions of one to compare the other...to a point. Regardless, this is a pretty decent beer and give it a shot...especially if you like wheat beers."
"D: Good. I like that I do get instances of hefeweizen and black ale. I could have this on all but my most picky nights."
"This beer might make a great hot weather thirst quencher if served cold. The chill temperature wouldn't affect the flavor."
"Overall, an interesting beer. I'm a big fan of both styles and this blend worked out pretty well. The other problem I had is that it really made me crave a true schwarzbier and not necessarily another of these. Avail here in TX. Rotation - would like to try on-tap. For bottles, maybe the rare one. [O;O]"
"Good beer though!"
"Pours a dark brown color. 5/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight yeast, slight hop, hint of wheat, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of a Dunkelweizen. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, slight pale malt, slight yeast, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend."
"Drinkability: Not bad. Tastes like a cross between a hefe and a schwarzbier. Though it's not the ideal wheat beer, especially for your ideal wheat beer occasion, this is good drinking. I would gladly buy this stuff again."
"D= I think I would stop before I even bought another one, but if I had another bottle offered to me I probably wouldn't have much urge to have two."
"Snappy wheat is well balanced with the dark, roasty malt...very nice. Yeastiness is there, but not completely overbearing. Almost like eating a chocolate covered banana. This is a really well done beer. I am guessing the 'Schwarz-Weizen' term separates this from the typical dunkelweizen with more of a roasty malt as opposed to a sweeter caramel flavor found in many DWs. The low sweetness factor enhances the drinkability for me, along with a body thats just a notch below medium...my glass is emptying at an astonishing pace. One of the better dunkelweizens out there."
"what would look exactly as it called... a good swartsbier... but with an interesting quality and grit of a hef. pour is really nice near blackness with a mocha head of volume. nose is chocolaty, and hef fruit and clove all at once. palate is the creamy quality of a shwarts with the gritty zest of a hef for the finish. very elaborate... first molasses, cocoa, that breaks to a hop wheat malt grit and mild sour... like a smoked malt sour... quality... this fruit twang and sourness is the finish of something like burnt clove. blends well with the dark malt/wheat malt sweet finish. great beer. the closest thing i'm had is probably new glarus' black wheat. but more dimension."
"D - Very drinkable at the 99 cent price-point that I procured it at today. Usually it is less drinkable, especially when it costs over $3."
"This is a solid beer but lacks the body to be a really great representation of the style. Very drinkable though."
"All in all I would consider this average. I don't think I would necessarily recommend this, but I certainly wouldn't knock it either."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and thin cream-colored head. Smell: astringent, roasted, some black malt, no contribution from the wheat. Taste: same as the nose - astringent, middling roastiness, a touch of black malt, and no wheat. Thin feel, lowish carbonation. This sounded like a hybrid of a shwarz and a dunkelweizen, but this is pretty much garbage."
"This was an interesting beer and i'm glad I took the chance on it unlike ABBA"
"Real good, drinkable brew. Solid, but still able to drink this on a seventy+ degree night."
"D - I recommend this if you are a fan of schwarzbiers and dunkles - A very tasty wheat with slight hybrid taste of schwarzbier/hefeweizen -I consider this worth seeking out"
"Mini hop snap on the finish, but what is most interesting about this german beer is its authenticity and nailing that yeast flavors. Hints of bananas, bubble gum and pineapple. So drinkable, smooth and interesting if you're in the mood."
"Can't for the life of me understand why this isn't rated higher. Of course, I generally love Hefe- and Dunkel-weizens in all their permutations, so maybe it's more about me than the beer. Still, I strongly recommend this to all wheat-beer fans."
"The schwarz-weisse is a little thicker than the typical dunkel, but remains fairly drinkable."
"D: Dark wheat beers are always very good."
"D: fairly good, a light bodied affair like a good Schwarz with a smooth bitterness that goes down well enough. Good recommend."
"Beer is good, odd yeasty bitterness, mouthfeel is overall really nice, beer is really smooth. Beer has some sweetness, some fruity flavors, full bodied, clean finish. Drinkability high."
"Purchased a bottle at Wine Gallery, Brookline. New swing top version. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark black color. Slight white head. Somewhat fizzy with carbonation. Smell was a bit smoky. Taste was quite unusual but enjoyable. The weizen part gave it a nice and light wheaty flavor. But the schwarz part gave it a toasted and almost burnt malt flavor to it. I found this beer a bit lighter in body and lower in abv that over dunkels I've tried. Easily drinkable, but not a beer that I'd have several of at one time. I bought it for the novelty of the style (are there many schwarz-weizens out there?) and I was impressed by Kulmbacher."
"One of the new 500ml swing-top bottles. Pours black (no way!) with a thick light-beige head that leaves great lacing. Typical weizen character in the aroma, but augmented by a sharp, bitter roastiness that seems quite unusual. Light banana notes. Interesting, but not necessarily bad. Notes of carbon/graphite. Dry, roasty taste with the typical tangy yeast. Really interesting stuff. Medium, well-carbonated body. Though I'm a fan of the regular Kapuziner weisse, this one doesn't quite stand up. Interesting for sure, but not a favorite."
"D - This is not the best dunkel. The flavors were pretty bland."
"Great atmosphere. Appearance is quite appealing, and a really pleasing nose. Great full balanced flavor, and light body. Overall, great quaff."
"it's got good drinkability. nothing super special, but it's quenching and interesting with it's wheat flavors, and darker malt flavors."
"Conclusion: This is an odd little beer, unique and a bit different...It's definitely interesting; I wouldn't pick this up regularly, but I might try it again."
"From a swing-top bottle, this beer pours a dark, solid brown color. The aroma contains wheat (a bit of twang), nicely roasted malt, fresh-baked bread, and quite a lot of yeast. The roast scents are the most appealing. Although the taste has a little breadyness in the front, it's essentially dry. The taste also has a lot of wheat flavor...the nearly tart twang that starts in the mid-taste. The beer is full bodied and very drinkable. I could have a few of these easily."
"Murky dark brown with a dense cap of tan foam. Clumpy lace. Aromas of sour wheat, banana, fruity, chocolate, nuts, toasted malt, hint of lemon and spice. Sweet malts in the flavour, caramel and a bit of toffee, chocolate, banana, faint lemon and sourness, bread. Nice texture, fairly creamy with a medium body. I liked it and I'd buy it again."
"This beer is not a typical Dunkelweizen. Thus the ""Schwarz"" in the title, and not ""Dunkel"". Think along the lines of a black lager crossed with a weizen, then you have where this beer is going. Pours a touch darker than the average dunkelweizen as well. Nose is subdued with some earth and some light wheat. Flavor begins with a dryish cocoa/chocolate entry then switches to a tangy weizen finish. As it warms the wheat takes a back seat and sort of blends more giving this one a single distinct taste. Overall not bad as it's a unique take on a weizen, but for me the chocolately malt belongs elsewhere..."
"A pretty decent drinkin' Dunkel, but there's better out there."
"Very satisfying. I could totally see myself slaying a bunch of bandits by swordpoint in some Germanic forest and quaffing a horn of this while wolfing down some dried deermeat, nuts, and black bread. Tastey."
"Very mediocre for a German heritage brew."
"It poured with a creamy, foamy, tan head that receded to a thin coating of the surface. The nose brings out the wheat and malt aromas nicely. A little bit roasty. It pours dark, showing a very deep red when held to light. It has a creamy mouthfeel, albeit with a prickly carbonation dominating the initial sensation. The malt and wheat flavors are the star. A touch of alcohol comes out on the finish, along with a lingering bit of dark, sweet bread. There is a bright sweetness in the middle that works well, allowing some yeasty action to join the fray, though subtly. No particular fruit comes to mind, just an essence of fruitiness. After sitting for a while on the palate without another drink it is a bit like a porter--some toasty chocolate notes."
"This is good, kind of plain and ok."
"Mouthfeel is decent, but again, not stellar. Makes for a drinkable beer with fair amount of roasted flavor."
"D - This has more schwarzbier characteristics than a dunkelweizen but comes across as a nice blend of the 2 styles. Very drinkable."
"D - It wasn't what I had hoped for but is alright."
"Pours a dark ominous color with a big frothy head that dissipates quickly. Smells more smoky to me than the usual weizen aroma. Misses the clove and banana completely. Big malty taste with a hint of smoked flavor. I don't taste anything close to a weizen flavor. Not appealing to me as it seems to be a beer that is not sure what it is trying to be. I barely finished this one so I won't be going back for another."
"From a 0.5L bottle purchased locally. Aroma is a little clove and fruit, with some dark malt. Color is a dark brown with dark red highlights. A big beige head. Taste is fruity and malty. Not too much yeast character in there. Easy drinking, but not too complex. Dry finish with a little toast lingering."
"This is a pretty full bodied beer with a big chocolate, mocha, and grainy malt presence. After the beer settles, there is a definite wheaty taste in the background. The beer is slightly sweet with some drying tendencies in the finish. There is a slight mouth puckering quality to this beer with maybe a pear or apple presence hidden deep down underneath. This is a creamy beer, with modest carbonation, very drinkable, and very enjoyable. I wouldn't rank this as high as say an Ayinger dunkel or Hacker-Pschorr DW, but this is a good beer nevertheless. L'Chaim."
"D - Gonna wrestle to finish it. Very interesting style of beer, but could be improved."
"thanks to BuckeyeNation!"
"Poured a cloudy dark brown color with generous tan head that lasted for quite some time. Aroma was of chocolate and a bit of smoke. Aroma was of roasted malts and chocolate. Mouthfeel was pleasant. I found this to be a tasty beer and at 5.4% abv, I believe I could drink quite a few."
"Not what I was expecting. A bit too sweet to have more than one serving, but it's interesting."
"After 2 pulls, I was really looking forward to a Paulaner. The Schwarzbier is unique, but not what I like. If you wanna dark weizen, Franziskaner's Dunkelweiss absolutely blows this one away!!"
"Overall, the flavor of cigarette smoke is the dominant flavor and not appetizing. I would say it is a defected bottle, but i just dont see how it is. Perhaps one day i may try it again, but as of now i wont, nor will i recommend it."
"Pours a very dark brown with a decent white head. Nose is banana yeast and dark malts. Taste follows with some banana flavor and a somewhate overbearing maltiness. spice profile is good, but a bit akward. Mouthfeel is pretty good, but nothing to be marveled at. Drikability is ok, but again nothing special. Overall, an OK dunk, but really kind of akward. I would say try it, but i wont be revisiting this one. Their weissbier is fantastic, but this one missed the mark for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium thick, this is great, even better than schwarzbier,more prononced version of a dunkle weizen."
"When we meet."
"Medium body, medium effervescence, toffee/vanilla aftertaste. Nice smooth finish. Good, not great, but good."
"I was between scores on drinkability, but it shows itself nicely enough overall to give it the higher of the two scores in mind. A nice dunkel with schwarz characteristics. Interesting, and quite drinkable."
"Pours a dark muddy brown with some caramel colored highlights,three fingers of foamy,medium brown head disapates slowly leaving behind a lackluster amount of lacing. The nose is slightly sweet with some roasted coffee aromas. This Shwarz is slightly bitter with lightly chared malt flavors,yeasty sweetness,and some faint dry hoppieness on the tail. The body is light and seems to lend its self to drinkability over substance. This one is'nt going to be a staple in my beer pyramid,it is worth a try."
"Loads of tan foam when poured into a pint glass. The color was a dark brown. The smell of roasted malts and yeast filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste had the roasted malts and yeast flavor, but it was sort of weak compare to other German Wizens. Still not to bad a flavor, just lacking a balance of Malts, yeast and other component that seperate the good from the outstanding!"
"Drinkability - A good drinker that won't blow you away but is a definite step up from the many sub-par efforts at the style."
"D: Tough call. Not as eminently drinkable as many other wheat beers, but still refreshing and enjoyable. I think I'd prefer this beer with a substantial, hot meal, or by the fireplace in the winter. Ultimately, I think I will drink this one again, but it's not an instant favorite of mine."
"Glad I tried this. Very bread like. Not my favorite style, but enjoyed it. Will probably pick one up again when I'm ready for a change of pace."
"D: A quite tasty and interesting hybrid between a black lager or stout and a dunkleweizen, unlike no other weizen I have hitherto tasted. I believe any fan of German beer would find this interesting and should pick up a bottle."
"Drinkability: It started with so much promise, when I first smelled the roast, but the beer just didn't follow through in the flavor department"
"Very very interesting brew... glad I picked it up."
"drinkability is very good, I wouldn't mind have a couple more of these.(although...I have had better dunkels)."
"Pours out a murky dark brown with a moderate sized khaki head. Aroma is some interesting roasty, smokey and ashy grains are up front with a heavy dose of banana and a touch of clove. Definitely different from any other weissbier I've had. As much as I liked the smell, the taste was just kind of weird to me. The typical mild tartness of a wheat beer seemed to clash with some lactic roasted malt character. The banana phenol is definitely there, but most of the yeastiness is overshadowed by the roasted malt. I get a lot of tobacco as well. Nice fluffy, wheaty mouthfeel here with an active carbonation. Drinkability is OK as I'm not totally into this."
"A solid offering. Nothing mindblowing, but a good example of the style. Strikes me as a beer that would probably make people who say they ""don't like dark beer"" actually like dark beer."
"D- This one goes down easy and is an excelent companion to Bratwursts, steak or hamburgers. A very impressive brew."
"Smell was of faint raisins, plums, and a bit roasted. Taste was mellow and not at all overpowering. A little bland for my taste, but good. I got a little diacetyl, but did not feel that it was unacceptable. Aftertaste was sweet and a little plummy. A nice change all in all."
"While the dark color was very appealing, the lack of a decent head lowered the appearance quality. Smell was not as malty as I expected. It was somewhat faint, yet still appealing. Taste was smoky, highly sweet with a slight astringent quality...very nice. Mouthfeel likewise was very good...a smooth yet dry quality was very nice on the palate. Drinkability was also very good...definitely could have another!"
"Pours an almost opaque ruby brown with a great tan head. Nose is slightly malty, but exhibits very little character. Flavor is sweet with an interesting almost corn like flavor. That is what hit my mind at first. Overall it is a really odd combination of flavors that almost seems like more than one beer blended together. I get a really odd yeast flavor with a hearty weisse flavor lingering in the back. Feel is good with a nice slightly higher level of bubble and the liquid feel is slightly bodied, though not very thick. Definitely drinkable. A very interesting and unique take on the style and worth trying out. I am glad I did."
"this was the last of my dunkel-weizen sampling ; pours a dark brown color, not as dark as i'd thought it'd be, but w/ a 2 finger off-white head which dissapates quickly, good lacing ; a wheat-type aroma w/ some roasted malt undertones, a slight fruitiness too ; more of the same here , a faint roasted malt flavor w/ a typical weizen flavor, some bananna in there as well, a little thin, though ; a light body, a good level of co2, most weizens have a bit too much for me, a dry finish ; a good drinking beer here, i'd buy more of this..."
"D: Rather drinkable, but not the most impressive of its style that I've tasted. Nevertheless, for any Dunkel fans, this is worth a taste. Still, I found it flavorful and balanced enough to still be enjoyable."
"Ok so I have to admit when I saw this lone, actually dusty bottle sitting on the shelf of an un-named local store, I was more then intrigued. I had never heard of a black Hefe and I knew I had to have one, I just had to. Rang up for 1.99 so I was not complaining and out the door I went. Pour was true to the name, very dark brown, nearly black and you could tell it was hazy and full of suspension. Big, towering two inch plus head of foam on top nearly would not stay in the glass and really looked quite full. Tons of side glass lace and a great look. Smell was very nice as well, the main player here being a yeasty and wheat aroma, but the nicest blend of roasted malts and even a touch of some caramel or dark nuttiness mixed in really set it off. The flavor was fantastic. Such a smooth creamy feel, but then again such great carbonation that it did not feel too full or too dull. Flavors were all over, you could definitely tell it was a Hefe as the classic flavor was there, but there were definite hints of roasting, or smoked aromas which were also as big and served to not only darken up the flavor but also the color. Really quite rich, with a touch of sweetness in the middle, and a bite of bitter at the end. This was great with dinner and I actually took a while to finish it, it was just that good. Overall I was not only impressed, but shocked at how good this was. This may have been one of my favorite that I have reviewed in a long time. This was just really outstanding and a shining example of a new style to me. I will be grabbing every bottle I see if I ever see it again and making this my choice of the week if I can. If you see it, pick it up and try it, it is really outstanding. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability- This is actually very drinkable. I could go to town on this and with the low ABV. It's quite possible without getting hammered. Even after aging which should have spoiled the beer altogether, the beer still holds up and remains the easy drinker it was before. I'm glad that I bought the case, even a year later. This is the gift that keeps on giving with the reusable bottles for homebrewing as well. This is not my favourite beer overall, but it is a fine lower gravity beer that was well worth the price."
"Drinkability: This is an outstanding beer and very affordable (just under $3 for a bottle here in Lincoln, NE). Relatively low alcohol, I could drink this all night if given the chance. As a side note for those who have had Boulevard's Lunar Ale; this is what I wish that beer was like."
"Awsome four inch rich tan head with fat bursting bubbles jumps off this carbonated jet black body. Rich malty wheat mix is rather soft for such a bold body and style. Enters the mouth amazingly smooth and mellow with soft even richness and a nice twing of coffee and maybe even a hint of coco. Mouthfeel includes a hint of anise and almost mediciney mineral mouth hue with hints of the dark wheat. Very drinkable but lacks personality."
"The dominant aroma was bubblegum, backed up by some bananas. It was real nice, and a little unexpected although I previously had some good experiences with the standard Kapuziner weissbiers. The taste was delicious, bananas and cloves mixed with fruity bubblegum, very nice. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy, this was very easy to drink. And only 5.4%, excellent dark weisse."
"D: This is an excellent beer, never been a fan of the style but I could drink many of these."
"For a different twist on a wheat beer grab a bottle of this beer. It's more sweet than I thought it would be. Otherwise very tasty and easy to drink."
"500ml bottle from A-1 To-Go. Dark brown body with ruby-red highlights and a half an inch of light tan head. Smells like chocolate and caramel malts. Very sweet and roasty, with chocolate and caramel malts playing a prominent role in the flavor. A bit of a smokiness is present as well. Creamy mouthfeel with a fair bit of carbonation to support it, making for a clean finish. A pretty damn good dunkel all-in-all."
"Boy the label is spot on on this one this truly in a black wheat ale,poured into a weizen glass a deep ebony with some reddish tint thru out a big blooming almond colored head atop.Soft fruit and chocolate mainly i the nose not alot of that clovey spice like you find in many of the style a hint of toastiness as well but its actually quite clean.More delicate than you might expect on the palate soft fruit tones with some wheat malt present with a lingering chocolate and smoke note.This is a delicate brew extremely easy to quaff but it wont knock your socks off flavor wise."
"Thanks to Todd the beer guy at McKean and Charles for getting me to try this. I probably wouldn't have gotten it without his suggestion. A 500ml bottle poured into a pint glass, it was a very dark, almost black, beer with a medium head. The aroma was a little nondescript, mostly grain. The taste made up for the aroma, however. Sweet fruit, dark chocolate malt. Very pleasant. Bready in the mouth, very easy to drink."
"Body is medium, silky, smooth, and very creamy. It feels like whipped mousse on your palate, so soft and slippery. Mouthfeel is really something. Drinkability is great, wheatbeer sessionability with heightened complexity and a unique personality"
"This was one of the most unique beers I've tried in quite a while. It has some characteristics of a Schwarzbier, but is more Porter-like in its chocolately malt profile. This was excellent, and I will certainly try to find more of the genre. I could see this being a fantastic summer evening beer, with its outstanding Weiss brother for the light and heat of the day. Incredibly enjoyable, crisp, clean, yet almost a subtle dessert like quality to it. Highly recommended, especially if you can enjoy the Weiss version as well. If you are looking for a malted, chocolatelycoffeesque ""summer beer", look no further. A tip of my hat to Kulmbacher for setting the bar for the Weiss style, in all its forms, high."
"drinkable:"
"D: Great beer that meets nearly all the qualities associated with a dunkel weizen. A great session beer to boot."
"The dark color contrasts the mild flavor profile nicely. This is very drinkable but I tend to prefer bolder beers."
"An OK beer but I don't think I will ever seek this out again it is just not that special. Probably pick an Erdinger Weissbier Pikantus over this one."
"The more I drink, the more the taste grows on you. Quite nice. Dunkel Weizen this!"
"Kapuziner Schwarz Weizen pours a dark brown with a tan head from a brown 500 ml bottle. The aroma is mostly malty with a little bit of banana noticealbe. The flavor is interesting, it's definitely different than other dunkel weizens I've tried. Banana is definitely noticeable, but so is roasted malt and some chocolate notes. I like it. Definitely worth a try."
"Banana creamy beer, bold molasses and licorice.Good head. Malty sweet. Touch of choclate malt, some spices, tad roast in mid-sip.A change up on wheat beers and you can taste the German quality, but could not have every day. Picked up days ago at Belmont Party Supply."
"Despite high hopes, Kapuziner Schwarz-Weizen isn't the dunkel equivalent of the outstanding Kapuziner Weissbier. It is, however, an original creation that attempts to combine two (not dissimilar) styles and manages to pull it off. I recommend it for the novelty factor alone. Thankfully, it's also good beer."
"Flavor is some sweet chocolate and brown sugar but mild overall, just a faint hint of cloves resurface on the finish. No hint of ABV as this i an easy drinker and very mild. Maybe would be more complex fresh on tap?"
"Poured a thick, solid, pale brown head leaves a few thick strands of lace. Dark chocolate colored beer with a hazy amber hue around the bottom. Doughy banana aromas upon pouring. Not as evident after a few minutes when all I can pick up is some zesty floral notes. Light flavor. Refreshing wheat and yeast mainly with some underlzing chocolate. There is a tinge of sourness that comes off as lemony in most wheat beers, but for some reason makes me think of sour cherries. Possibly the mix of dark malts with the lemony flavor? I don't think it's bad, but it does seam out of place. Finishes fairly clean leaving a feeling of carbonic acid in my mouth and burps of yeasty banana. Mouthfeel is just ok. The carbonation is a bit abbrasive and not as soft as I was expecting. It tastes like the diluted a really good Dunkel Weizen with about 20% sparkling water."
"Mouthfeel is pretty empty and drinkability is lower because of the dryness."
"Well, I'm glad I tried this. An interesting hybrid style that doesn't quite work for me. It's drinkable but one is plenty enough."
"Pours a five+ finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace, ton of yeast left in bottle. Deep mahogeny/brown color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Starts balanced, slight malty flavor, roasted malt finish, yeast is not noticeable. $2.45 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Worth trying, though the flavor profile is unusual for a dunkel weizen."
"Pours a dark brown with a huge off white head that fades away. Smells of citrus, hops, banana, with a bit of yeast and wheat. A strong hefe taste mostly of the banana with a small bitter taste. The aftertaste is mostly wheat but fades quickly. After the first sip the beer has a good balance of flavor and has a watery feel to it. The carbonation is subtle. This beer is refreshing and different, but worth checking into for hefe fans."
"Standard 500 mL German bottle with some code on the back label. It pours into the weizen glass almost black with some sediment and a finger of tan head with an aroma of roasted/earthy malts. The taste adds to this faint notes of chocolate, spice, banana, and a yeast/wheat tang on top of a light to medium body that seems a bit thin. About average for a dunkel I'd say."
"¡Salud!"
"Poured a dark almost black brown with a small bubbly tan head. The aroma is very nice typical hefe nose of banana, wheat, honey, cinnamon, citrus hops. The taste starts malty on the palate with a slight caramel sweetness followed by a cinnamon, pepper, spicy citrus hop bite. Finishing light on the palate, soft and bready in the finish....fantastic."
"Served in a 1pint .9oz bottle. Pours murkish black, with a ruby red hue when put against light. Has a frothy head that slowly settles to the size of one finger width. Smells like a wheat beer. Taste has notes of chocolate with the wheat malt. Seems a bit to watery in the mouthfeel. Was OK. Would drink again but not in a hurry."
"D: Definitely not impressed."
"The body is medium with a decent carbonation. Pleasant, but not as drinkable as a regular hefe. I was glad to be able to try it."
"This is how I like my ""smoked"" beers. The smoke is not overpowering and really compliments the rest of the flavors. The smoke stays through almost the entire taste including the ending. The ending also has a slight bitterness that makes it a bit dry. The sweetness (chocolate, coffee and malt) is mostly in the beginning. Much more complex than I would have thought. Very easy drinking. Just a great, solid beer. I will look for the Weisbeir in this line as well."
"Taste; nice wheaty bread dough, with dark chocolate malts on the initial sips. It has a little lemon to it with cloves and just some hints of bananas as it gets warmer. There's a bit of a hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. Very drinkable."
"Medium mouth with lots of carbonation. Not too much tingle, but enough to move things along nicely. Good beer! I like this almost as much as Aventinus."
"A great beer."
"Overall a great beer that I'm very delighted I found at the Cloverleaf in Metro Detroit. The leathery flavor is quite unique and a bit puzzling, but I think I like it more now that I'm close to finishing the .5 liter bottle. Definitely will buy more in the future."
"Pedro Ximenes solera brown -- dark -- with a hissing tower of foam. Lemon and herbal tea aromas pick up parched black coffee, toast and charred black bananas elements. Limber, bitter roast flavors have a juicy core and are battered with stormy waves of prickly gas. Crunchy green and red apple juice flavors (I believe these are considered ""esters""). Dry, light bodied and lemony with roasty bitterness that persists. This is like Hefeweizen with a shot of espresso, only it seems to work ... in a Cuban summer patio sort of way ... with roast pig on a spit."
"Notes: VERY GOOD, one of the best dunkel weizens I tried"
"This is bad. The bottle must be split between 5 victims, as none of us alone are strong enough to finish it."
"Beautiful to behold. Cloudy dark caramel under a 2.5 finger tan contoured head that settles to about half a pencil, then lasts and lasts. Great lacing most of the way down. The nose is crisp with spice, orange and yeast. The mouth is prickly and not too light. The taste is as it should be - nice spice, banana and clove, with just a hint of sweet caramel. All of this is followed by a mellow hop bitterness that lingers very nicely, blending with the spiciness to form a smooth mosaic of pleasure throughout the mouth. Nice."
