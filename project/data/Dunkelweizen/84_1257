3.67,-6.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Their regular hefe is a little on the weak side so it is a nice surprise that this is a full bodied dunkel with a strong malty finish. The nose is bready rather than bubblegum or bananas. The beer needs to warm up to show its nuances but the beer is quite balanced with the typical hefe showings arising late in the finish. One of the better dunkels available.","canucklehead","0"
3.88,-1.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The dunkel-ness of this beer hit me in the finish  clean, dry and smooth. A pleasurable easy-drinker I'll definitely revisit.","vanrassel","Feb 21, 2006"
4.2,6.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Taste carries all the spice over from the nose, with lots of punchy malt flavour. Low bitterness but some classic lemony sourness and a bit of acidity in the finish. Tied all neatly together with the banana, apple, and pear flavours. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy with a medium, near perfect carbonation. A very tasty summer evening session brew and hands down beats the Edelweiss Hefeweizen.","trevorwideman","Oct 12, 2005"
4.08,3.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This doesn't draw you in and urge you on to drink more. Instead it has a quiet confidence and subtlety, as if to say, ""Go ahead, take your time, I'll be hear when you're ready for another sip."" The nice gentle mouthfeel is relaxing and reminiscent of wraping yourself in a nice fuzzy warm blanket. Definitely well worth having again, unfortunately I brought this one back from Calgary and neither this nor any of it's style are available in my neck of the woods.","Noxious26","Aug 26, 2005"

3.37,-14.5,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Toffee coloured, hazy, and well carbonated. Its got some pleasing yeasty and banana aromas. The flavors are your typical hefe: banana, clove, yeast, with a bit of caramel thrown in. Strangely drying finish. This beer is mellow and easy to drink, but the flavors are a little too muted.","fisherman34","Jan 07, 2005"
3.98,1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Edelweiss's dunkel red-cap bottle poured with typical German-wheat beauty, bubbling over the rim enormously but somehow never spilling due to the genius of the designed glass. The head was mammoth sized, and had the consistency of whipped cream--exceptional! No glass is more fitting for its style in my experience than a German wheat beer or hefe glass. This dunkel is not as dark as say, Erdinger's, but more a dirty brown, darker near the top than the bottom. Caramel and butterscotch colouration, and dense with yeast; hazy. A cream coloured head, with some darker spots where the remaining yeast dripped in from the bottle. Large bubbles of lace on the sides, leaving some web patterns. It smells similar to many pale hefes, and the dark malts really do not make much of a difference; instead the lovely fruity aromas of banana, strawberry, spices, some lactose, and in the background some lightly roasted malt. The dunkel has more spice than their hefetrub. The malt is a little more felt in the mouth, leaving a nice grainy taste. The intensely fruity aroma is also more subdued in the taste; indeed the taste really balances all the notes from the smell. Estery cloves and banana can be tasted at first, in the middle I can taste the hardness of the water, and the finish is the best part, not very lingering but leaving my mouth with a desire for another sip. The alcohol is detectable in the middle, and the hops, barely. I found the mouthfeel a little light, even for a wheat beer. The water is a little too detectable, and the ""dunkel"" style had me expecting some more body from the malt, but that is not the case. What it lacks in body though it makes up for in drinkability. A very nice summer wheat beer from Austria's renowned weissbier brewery. Paired nicely with Jarlsberg cheese.","Cwrw","Dec 22, 2004"
3.5,-11.2,4,4,3.5,3,3,"It's worthwhile to try this beer out if you are a fan of the dunkel or hefe weizen style.","elricorico","Aug 29, 2004"
3.85,-2.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Clovey and peppery notes all through. A yeasty, bready wheat character builds over time. Clean and refreshing, with a nice maltiness to it too. Vanilla and banana fill out a bit of the sweetness. A nice round mouth feel with a refreshing tingle finishes this all off. I like it a lot.","Garin","Feb 17, 2004"
3.95,0.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Comes in a tall 500 ml brown bottle, a direct German import as it is strictly German writing on all the labels, just a thin white importer's sticker on the back with the domestic details. Best before date on the front label is 09.2004. Cloudy and murky body on the pour, quite opaque in the middle of the glass, varying degrees of ochre colour. Massive spongy off-white head at first, which takes its sweet time to descend and leaves a fair sized cap most of the way down the glass. There is a sweetness of wheat and yeast on the nose, along with banana and some nutmeg and clove. The profile is definitely sweet and then mildly spicy. More balance in the flavour with the sweetness and spice, crisp wheat at first, sweetening up in the middle with some banana, and then the crispness pops up again on the finish with some light hops to accompany the nuttiness of the spices. The mouthfeel is light and a bit on the watery side, but adds to the drinkability of this beer. The aftertaste leaves me with the impression of candied bananas, yet fortunately the crispness of texture and taste helps take the edge off of that a bit. Would be a big hit for those with a sweet tooth.","IronDjinn","Dec 04, 2003"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Very drinkable, but I like a stronger flavor to my wheat beers.","Zorro","Nov 20, 2003"
3.04,-22.8,2,3,3,3,3.5,"Orange to brown body, not too hazy, under a frothy head. This was an older bottle, so some of the haze may have been in the sedimentation. Retains a hint of dark roasted flavor, but lots of tiny bubbles from the wheat. German hops pretty well balanced.","DrunkMcDermott","Nov 08, 2003"
3.75,-4.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This is a real nice beer in my opinion. It won't make me a wheat beer drinker on a regular basis but it could be a change of pace beer for me.","Rumrunner","Aug 01, 2003"
4.04,2.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a cloudy light brown under a pale tan two-fingered head with good retention but only a few spots of lace. The nose is full of flowers, fruit and wheat. The mouth is light and prickly, with lots of sweetness. The taste is full and delicious - cloves, plumbs, yeast, wheat. There's just a touch of hops that adds bitter to the fruity aftertaste. Definitely a good drink!","Globetrotter","Jul 03, 2003"
3.26,-17.3,4,3,3,4,3.5,"This brew poured a large frothy white head of fine to medium sized bubbles that left very little lacing and a cloudy carbonated light brown body. It has a medium strength malty wheat banana aroma and a banana wheat flavor with a smooth mildy tingly mouthfeel. An OK brew at best.","TheDM","Mar 24, 2003"
3.65,-7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"When poured into my glass, this beer had a medium tan head with small bubbles that fully diminished. The body was cloudy and was the hue of cider. The lacing was fair and the carbonation was somewhat fizzy. There were numerous aromas such as banana, clove, spice, and fruit. The mouthfeel was smooth, thin and watery. This was a mild tasting beer and one that could probably get me in trouble on any given night as it was very smooth which is very much to my liking.","hotstuff","Feb 24, 2003"
2.9,-26.4,3,3,3,2,3,"Not bad, slightly chocolatey, and fruity (banana) flavours, but not one of the better dark wheats you'll find. Generally, easy drinking dark German wheat, smooth and lghtly tart and refreshing, uncomplex flavour, and a nice one for session drinking, look to Andechser, Paulaner, for better examples of the style. This isn't bad though.","rastaman","Dec 28, 2002"
3.58,-9.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"It poured a nice hazy medium dark golden brown with some foam and not much lace, if any. The smell was of cloves, with a hint of malts and hops. Couldn't pick up any wheat aromoa at all. The taste was had a lot of cloves and a hint of malts and hops with a very little wheat if any. The big set back for me was it was to acidic, to over powering and not enough wheat. No much on the after taste, just lack all around to be an exceptional beer!","BeerManDan","Nov 16, 2002"
3.77,-4.3,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"The color as it sets in the glass, a dark amber color that is somewhat murky, the head monumental in size, the texture frothy and the lace nice sheets to coat the glass. Yeast at the front, malt underneath, with light hints of earthy wheat, clean and fresh. The start is sweet and lots of malt, the top skimpy, the finish pertinently acidic, the hops a bit sparse, dry aftertaste, drinkable, but not really something I would call a Session beer as it is a bit overly sweet.","Gusler","Jul 03, 2002"

3.88,-1.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A very good dunkel, it is very dark and well balanced nice aroma not strong but enough to satisfy the nose.  Very smooht if it is somewhat heavy. I recommend this beer to all lovers of the dunkel style............CHEERS","tigerpaws","Aug 16, 2001"
