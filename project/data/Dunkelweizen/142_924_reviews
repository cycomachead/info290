"O: One of my go to beers.  Often when I can't decide what to get, I'll grab one of these.  Sweet, malty hefeweisse."
""
"General: Una cerveza muy agradable, balanceada y ligera. Puedes tomar varias."
"Spaten Franziskaner Bräu dunkelweizen weissbier is my favorite beer ever, but it has always been hard to find.  My specialty beer store had a time getting it, and they don't have it anymore. For the last year or so, World Market was the only place I could get it, and now they tell me it's been discontinued in that size.  This site says its' still available. How do I get it?"

"Years ago as I was going thru craft beer education, wheat beers were my favorite and this beer topped my list. I have grown to be an open minded hop head and haven't had this beer in a few years and not much wheat beer in general. I'm not the best person to review wheat beers. This is a very good beer but I am sure there are others better made. Worth a try, works very well with a couple orange slices."

"My favorite beer. It is dark but smooth."
""

"Overall- A nice German wheat beer that is easy-drinking and unassuming. All of the required pieces are there (sweet malt and sour yeast flavors). It's just that, when compared to some of its German competitors, such as Wienhenstephener, this ale comes off as a touch bland. A very good but not great hefeweizen. P.S. You shouldn't be surprised to learn that this is an InBev product."
"great dunkel one of my favorites"
"Poured from a bottle into a weisse vase, the beer is a dark, muddled, golden brown coloring with a frothy,  low profile, tan head. Aromas of nut sweetness, smoked caramel, and subtle toffee. Sweet and balanced. The flavors are nutty and tangy caramel sweet, with hints of date and fig, and subtle roast notes.  Smooth and full bodied, with a short lived fruit bread aftertaste cut by the crisp, clean finish. Solid beer."
"This beer was a big disappointment.  I generally like wheat beers but found this one lacking flavor and just generally bland."
"My favourite dunkel. It was also the first one I tried."
""
"This is my favorite commercial beer. I'm always surprised that more people don't love it. I even love that happy monk on the label. I probably don't drink this the way a beer snob would think is correct. I like this very cold."

"I love this beer, smooth easy drinking. caramel  and toffee  ,sweet bananas, more than just a wheat beer, Dunkelweizen's are a awesome combo of hefe's and dunkel, a good year round beer"

"16.9 oz bottle in a chalice glass.  Pours a dark amber, brown color with a light head.  Taste of sweet fruits with a tinge of lager-like bitter bread/yeast.  Very light body with a mineral water consistency;  the carbonation making it very refreshing.   Overall, very good."

"O - A solid Dunkelweizen. Maybe not the best...but it's up there."
""

"Poured from bottle into my tulip glass... mahogany tones with a full finger of white head. Didn't last long. The aroma had some banana, spice (nutmeg?), and a bit if a bready/yeasty note. The tastes were in line with the aroma, and I mentioned at least once or twice that it had some of the same taste profiles as a banana-nut bread... and again, a hint of spice. Good carbonation and a smooth overall mouthfeel to this brew. Overall, I thought that this was a nice beer, nice change of pace from my go-to IPAs and stouts, and well-crafted. Quite a good deal for the big bottle at around 3 bucks. Glad to be expanding my beer horizons a bit, and this was a nice stop along the road. Try it!"

"O - A really well balanced weissebier.  I prefer my dunkels to be a bit lighter brown. All in all, this was just a good, well-rounded beer..  I was hoping it would be a great hot summer lawn mowing beer.  I'll probably drink it as an early autumn refresher, though."

"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Murky mahogany-brown pour with a quickly fading one finger off-white head with decent lacing. Nutty, earthy nose with hints of banana, brown bread, clove, and a subtle vinous character. The taste follows suit with lots of malty brown bread up front along with hints of banana, clove, toffee, apple, tobacco, molasses, and a subtle vinous finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly chewy with medium carbonation and good balance. Overall, a solid interpretation with good drinkability."

"I am a big fan of German beers and this one definately did not dissapoint. It poured a mix of golden, brown, and orange, average head and carbonation. It has a pleaseant aroma of sweet malts and orchard fruits, with a taste of german malts and different types of grain/fruit taste. It is a bit watery, has no sdge, a strong german malt aftertaste, and is filling. Very good beer for a big brewing company."

"500 ml bottle into weizen glass, bottled on 12/10/2012. Pours very hazy reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, light roast, banana, pear, apple, pepper, clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, light roast, banana, pear, apple, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, pear, apple, banana, light clove, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and moderate fruity yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good dunkelweizen style. Good balance and robustness of dark malt and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"500ml bottle. Hoepfner Weizen glass. Deep amber color. Foggy appearance. Beige foam remains as a close & thin crown. Intense aromas of banana, toasted malt & bread, hints of clove & floral notes rounded by caramel on the back. Toasted upfront. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Watery texture. Gentle malts, bread notes & brown sugar touch balanced by low bitterness. Fruity finish. Refreshing & easy drinkable."

"Overall: Great brew, I would have this one again."
"Overall, good but featuring a few offtastes and an intense mouthfeel... I'd need to try it in Germany to compare."
""
""
""
""
"Nice flavor with hint of banana. No hint at all of a metallic aftertaste. Noticeably heavier than a hefe, but clearly related."

"Pours a hazy dark brown, like ice tea that has a good finger+ white foamy head. Lots of lacing was seen right to the end with each sip. The aroma is of dark bread with a hint of cloves and banana. Very pleasant. The taste was even better with a hint of dark fruit as well. Very easy to drink with perfect carbonation. Goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. This is a really great brew for the colder months and never have been disappointed."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was amazed. It really fit the context I was in at the time of drinking it. I really would drink this again, and again, and again. Perhaps this beer tasted so good because I had just finished cross-country skiing in -15 (Celsius) weather in Northeast China with a group of German and Swedish diehard ski bums. We went to one of the few German pub/restaurants in N.E. China right when we finished skiing. This brew really complemented my borsch, warm pretzel bread, sour cucumber cabbage salad, potatoes, and marinated beef. Quite a hearty meal on a frigid day. Give this beer a try if you haven't yet."
""
"Overall 3.5: Good beer, but nothing special. This beer is strange: watery and weak in places and assertive and complex in others. I imagine it would be good with food, maybe a nice plate of haxen. Not the best for sessioning, as the aftertaste is a bit off, in my opinion. Not a horrible beer by any means, but certainly not the best you will ever imbibe."

"Had this from a bottle poured into a pint glass. Color is brown/reddish. You get a lot of clove and banana in the smell. Taste is a lot like the smell, but has a caramel kick to it. This is my first Dunkelweizen and I'm pretty impressed. I am a big fan of Hefe's, so I wanted to try a Hefe that was a little darker. Really like this beer. The caramel kick it has is a fantastic twist to the beer. I recommend it."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid beer. Delicious and tasty."
""
"Overall- Very solid Dunkel Hefe."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"One of the four or five best examples of this style that I have ever had. Excellent on tap, especially if you get to Bavaria."
""
""
""
""
"Lively and flavoursome, very pleasant and one of the best Dunkelweizen I've had so far."
""
""
"Not a bad beer by any means, however, I found myself looking forward to the end of the glass as time went on. More enjoyable to smell than sip."

""
""
""
"I was actually slightly disappointed given how much I like the Franziskaner Weissbier."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Hazy and amber with a giant head, but no real lacing. Nose is wheaty with some sweet and bittersweet accentuates. Woody wheat, with a little molasses and raisin. Feels a little shallow. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"I usually order a hefeweizen with a meal in Germany and this dark hefe was a treat. I really enjoyed the complex taste and aroma of this beer. It has a nice balance of malts that leave a nice smooth almost chocolate aftertaste. I prefer dark hefe if they are not too bitter and this one is really nice. It is a touch sweet though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very enjoyable beer. Only the second dunkel I believe I've had, I feel this is a good bar to set as a guideline for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"But with more of a banana feel to it. And it leaves a nice smooth wheat aftertaste."

""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall as this is the beer that started it all for me I am partial to it, but think the taste could have a bit more oomph to make it really great."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good wheat ale in the German style, good nose, okay flavor. Their hefe is one of the best, but this is just pretty good. Still worth trying though, and enjoyable enough that I would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorites Dunkelweizen, solid flavor with a good price and drinkability."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: not a very good wheat beer neither a very good dunkel, particularly for what would be approx. AU$75 a case of 24 x 330mL. Get something else."

" Head was creamy and light with aroma being a light malt. Mouthfeel was creamy, almost like a hint of Guinness, though not as robust as that. Malty, slight floral aftertaste."

"overall, this is, like i said, one of my favorite beers for so many years, before i tried so many others from belgium and before Total Wine and BEVMO came to town. OLD WORLD was the greatest place in the world and the best place to drink them. this isthe last one of the case i bought a few months ago and i'm srprised to find i hadnt reviewed it yet. i rated it, but didnt review it. i still love this stuff..."
""
""
""
"O: A solid example of a dunkle. Very representative of German beer in general. It seems like a great Oktoberfest beer, to be drunk in the outskirts of a 18th century German brew town, overlooking a field of two row barley, in some September afternoon, with friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer, but a little lighter in the malt department than I expected. I had more of a dunkel lager with heavier flavors in mind, but this was also an enjoyable, cheap beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable and super easy to drink, this beer takes me back to the years when I had the opportunity to visit Bavaria at least once a year (sitting outside in a beer garden and enjoying these on a Saturday afternoon). Definitely sessionable and a beer that you could easily drink all day."
""
"Not the best I've had, mainly because it's nowhere near aggressive enough in it's attack, but pleasant and enjoyable. Maybe a good gateway for newcomers to the style, due to its restraint. You can see if you at least like the idea before you start getting ambitious."
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours hazy caramel brown with a thick, off-white head that dissipates slowly. I pick up those aromas of banana and clove, but they're light. I detect some of those darker malts in the aroma. This is a more malt forward dunkelweizen, which permits the barley and wheat malt character to shine. The banana and clove flavors are mild, but they do come together to give this a light banana bread type of character. The body is on the lighter side of medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is smooth. The drinkability is high. This is a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a Hefe with moderate dark malt characteristics and a little less clove and banana then a straight Hefe. Spice and fruit still dominate most aspect of the beer."
""
""
""
"A good traditional representation of a style that I don't get very often. I wish that I could compare this back-to-back to other beers of the same style."
""
""
""
"I've had the Hefeweizen from Franziskaner before and was hoping this would at least match it, but I'm severely disappointed."
""
""
""
"O: an exceptionally good-looking beer with fine flavor but a mediocre mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I would recommend this beer for an easy drink. Would have expected more taste from a Franziskaner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hefe-Weisse Dunkel pours a dark brown color, with a nice size lasting head; almost looks like a root beer. Their is a strong malt and yeast aroma. The taste has a solid malt backbone, and a nice bitterness, and dryness. Good full flavor. Overall a decent Dunkel, enjoyable but not the best."
""
"o - lots of flavor and seems to be a good representation of the style, i just didn't enjoy it very much. probably won't be purchasing this one again."
"Review from 3/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a hazy medium brown amber with a two finger light tan head and lacing. Aroma of wheat, banana and clove. A refreshing wheat beer with a good balance of wheat, yeast, malt and just the right light spiciness. Fairly dry in the middle and finish. A very nice dunkelweizen."

""
""
""

""

""
""
""

"Interesting beer, not quite what I expected. Sweeter and more fruit notes than a wheat beer, almost reminds me of a Belgian. Not a bad beer, one that is a good choice on a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really good dark hef. Not quite on the level of Weihenstephaner's dunkel, but good enough to pay for time and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing."
""
"500 ml bottle. Pours hazy-brown with a thick long lasting white head and much lacing. Aroma of yeast, wheat malt, cloves and caramel. Body is full and crisp. Wheat malt, cloves, some caramel and banana notes fill the mouth, some tartness. Finish is short and slightly sweet. Overall good brew."
""
"Hefe-Weisse Dunkel is definitely a favorite of mine over the traditional hefeweizen. If you want a darker, heavier and sweeter version of the style this is your beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: the sensation is good, it represent the style, a refreshing medium body balanced beer with low sweetness and low bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Classic dunkel. Worth buying and re-buying and re-buying. Get the point? 4.0"
"Light bodied with average carbonation. As mentioned before, somewhat thin and watery. Not bad, but not worth seeking out again either."
""
"This is a very decent, easy drinking, flavorful beer. It has good flavor, good body, and great drinkability. I recommend checking this out."
""
""
""
"A solid Dunkel. The nut flavors really pull everything together."
""
""
""
"A moderate pour yields a caramel colored body that is not as translucent as anticipated. A finger-wide head comprised of eggshell white bubbles adorns the surface; retention and lacing seem a bit lacking. The aroma is of wheat, straw, grass, and some grains that, while don’t seem roasted, do seem to have been “warmed” in some way. Some faint lemon and malt dropped in as well. The flavor follows suit, with an emphasis on the wheat, grass, and straw notes. Some caramel mixes well with the muddled grains, while some lemon pulls through towards the rear. Mouthfeel is crisp and finishes clean. The consistency is thinner than the color of the body may suggest, but it lacks not in flavor. Overall, a great beer. Not particularly rare or sought after these days, but one that is certainly worthy of revisiting any time."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this dunkel weisse..its what others should be. Just plain great. Every sip takes me back to Germany..."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky brown with a 2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Thick foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat toast, spices, and some slight banana aromas. Taste is of wheat, spices, brown sugar, and subtle banana on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good dunkelweizen but nothing really stands out to me."
""
"O - I've had a good number of German and American wheats but not too many of the associated dark versions. This was a good beer, but to me, they are a step down from their brothers."
""
"Overall- Nice, drinkable brew. I would be willing to drink this again from time to time."
""
""
"Pours a mid-brown, caramel color with a two-finger very off-white head. Aroma of spice, caramel malt and a bit of wheat. Flavor follows. Fairly mild. Hints of wheat, grass, spice to start. Subtle sweet caramel, bready malt with a bit of banana on the back end. Not nearly as big or sweet of a malt compared to others in the style. A bit subdued overall. No big heffe flavors either."
""
""
"o: a very good dunkelweizen, but a bit of a heavier and chewier mouthfeel would definitely improve this."
""
""
""
""
"Very easy drinkable with fine refreshing character, it’s mild, smooth and balance Dunkelweizen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A good, look and smell and a pretty nice flavor profile, but the mouthfeel definitely leaves something to be desired. Not bad, but not great either."
"Bought in Celle, Germany. This beer smells sweet and fruity (bananas). Unlike many popular dunkels it is completely unfiltered. The head gives way after a minute or two, not too much lacing. Taste is rather sweet, much like a their hefeweizen, just with some added chocolate malts. Definitely a solid beer, I would buy again. However, I believe there are some better dunkels out there."
""
""
"Raisin brownish-red in color with a murky haze. Poured with a thick beige foam that slowly reduced to a thick cap. Wheat malt aroma is prominent with spicy clove and hints of banana. Medium bodied with ample rich carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Wheat and toasted malt flavor with clove up front . The spiciness intensifies into the middle giving way to banana and yeast flavors and wheat malt flavors to the finish. Finishes clean and semi-dry."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very well rounded dunkelweizen. Very refreshing."
""
""
""
"A very drinkable and well priced beer. I'm more of a fan of their regular hefe-weisse but this is good when your drinking a few franzis in a row."
""
""
"B-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its not quite as good as their regular hefeweissen, but its still stands out a solid drink. I paid two fifty for a pint-sized bottle, so I can easily say that what I paid was worth the taste."
""
"The aroma really had me looking forward to this but unfortunately the taste was just average and the mouthfeel was a bit disappointing."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This was an easy drinker with each sip following easily from another and tasting as good as the last. A good solid, well made dunkel weisse that hits the mark easily. Recommended."
"From a 25 fl. oz. bottle stamped L-152136-20:54. Sampled on February 8, 2012. The pour is olive brown coming out of the bottle but it becomes a dark amber tone with a generous head in the tall glass. The aromas are modest with dark malts, wheat, yeast, banana, and clove. The body is on the light to medium side. The flavor is scrumptious with its sweet dark malts and wheat up front and a slightly dry finale. It is a beer that is easy to drink quickly while at the same time savoring it."
"A good one. I'll have another!"
""
""
""
"This is a beer I could drink for a long time. I will buy this beer for special occasions in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good example of a dunkel weissbier. I could session this beer with no trouble. Refreshing and satisfying."
""
""
"O: This was an alright beer, but not anything I'd look for in the future."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is very soft with a light sensation of tingliness. the head is creamy and dense due to the tiny nature of the bubbles, it's like a pillow in your mouth."
"In the taste is where you get the banana and citrus notes, as well as carbonation in your face; crisp and not thick is what makes this brew quite refrshing for the Andalousian summers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy translucent chestnut, color with temporary lacing and good retention. A nice nose of roasted malt, yeast, banana, chocolate and clove is similar to that of most Belgian Ales. The initial flavor isn’t bold, but hints of wheat with some sweetness and spice are present. The flavor quickly subsists to a very thin, watery mouthfeel with light carbonation. Overall, the ale is great right up to the finish. It’s a nice session ale if no other good options are available."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into weizen glass. Darker side of mahogony body and three finger head. Nice wheaty smell, cherry, a little spice, not too strong, average. Crisp bite on palate, up front spicy wheat, and sweet cherry finish. Quite good, I like their hefeweizen also."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is definitely a beer you would use to introduce to someone who is somewhat close-minded when it comes to beer. It is very easy to drink but super smooth. To other this might be your ""diet-coke"" for beer connoisseurs but then again we all need a light drink every now and then. If this beer had a season it would be late summer to fall, why??? because something this filling works best in warm drier climates. Hope you all enjoy and cheers!"
""
"O: Absolutely delicious beer that was very enjoyable and one that I would definitely have again. Great drinkability and flavors with a beautiful nose all contribute to this experience."
""
"O: Good, but I've had equally-good dunkel weissbeir for less money, and better ones for not much more. It's a solid contender in its class, but not a standout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is very light, almost watery. The yeast feels chewy and crusty. Like the curst of yeast bread. The hefeweizen yeast is taken over by the bready crusty malt."

"Mississippi river brown and cloudy with an off white head. Head formation consists of tiny uniform bubbles and good retention. No lacing. Effervescent bubbler in the center of the glass a la Belgium triple. Very nice nose of yeasty banana / fruity esters. Taste banana right away, sort of clove and hair tonic / dry at the end. Thin, watery feel but the good amount of carbonation offsets the thinness. Flavors and feel are definitely subdued in this one. The banana smell and flavor makes this a unique offering of the style, and one that I always enjoy. Thanks to Dan and Mary Ann for the Holiday gift bottle."

"Overall, this is a solid and extremely drinkable session ale. It's readily available and can definitely be your saving grace at a bar with less than desirable tap selections."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is a hazy amber red. A very fluffy creamy white head. Little or no lacing. The beer smells amazing! Banana bread, nuts, raisins ... Tastes a bit malty with a bready overtone. Hints of bananas, nuts, and caramel. The mouthfeel is very solid, not watery at all, nor chewy. Overall, this beer is delicious. It reminds me of Orval with its complexity. I bought a single 16.9 oz bottle of this, and won't mind doing so again."

"My review is based on the draft version. Although first introduced to this beer in the bottle, I highly prefer draft beer and have owned a keg cooler for over 25 years. Anyone who owns a keg cooler system understands that selection is very limited compared to what is available in the bottle. The two dunkel wheat beers available where I live in the US are Franziskaner and Hacker-Pschorr. Both are very good, but the Franziskaner is more readily available year round and is therefore my favorite. The great thing about this beer is that there has never been a guest in my home who has not been pleased when served with a glass of this brew, including people who generally do not like beer and only drink light beers. It is truly exsceptional to find a beer that virtually everone from craft IPA drinkers to light beer drinkers enjoy. I can only hope that this dunkel and more of this style become available in the keg."
"A fantastic beer to imbibe!"
"Overall – not a bad brew at all, and a nice German beer, but not very interesting or thought-provoking."
"Overall, I feel the flavor profile tips a bit too far into banana and the beer is not quite fresh enough, i.e. too malty and syrupy with not enough fresh elements to balance."
"This one is worth trying but I feel that it falls short of the top tier as far as this style goes. Everything you’d want is there and is all nice enough but it certainly isn’t anything profound or even particularly memorable. Doesn’t really stand out amongst the other Dunkels I’ve had. Enjoyable and definitely worth trying, but could be bigger in both taste and aroma."
"Overall nice, drinkable, nice flavors all blended well between the wheats, fruits, bananas foster, slight sweetness, soft malts, and dry slightly bitter finish. There are plenty of dunkels that are better, but this is a nice drinking one, esp one that I can buy regularly."
"Draught poured at Canterbury Ales, Huntington, NY. Deep copper brown, good head, with a very nice wheat beer aroma. I love the taste of Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel. Good maltiness and the kind of subtle complexity that causes people to write they taste cocoa, bananas, etc. I understand the analogies, but I'm content to say this is the finest drink I've had this season - malty, not bitter, a great Bavarian beer I certainly enjoy. This is dark beer with a light mouthfeel. Drinking a pint doesn't feel like you just ate an entire meal. Now I'm curious about Dunkelweizen style and will have to try more examples."
"Overall this is a decent example of the style but lacks any nice umph or rememorable flavors to make me want to revisit. Not a favorite style of mine to be honest but I have had much better and more full flavored examples. A one and done for me."
"The beer tasted of caramel sweetness with a dominant banana toffee backbone. Nice, sweet but not in your face. The taste panned to a tartness that was pleasant and gave the sweetness a good foil. Very refreshing and balanced on the palate. Mouthfeel was creamy, but at the same time light enough to be enjoyed in copious amounts. I would really rate the 'Kaner hefedunkel very high on the drinkability front. A nice, flavourful, sessionable beer that wont, as the say ""break your bank"" !"
"This is a good interpretation of the Franziskaner-Hefe. It is a good late night version of the its daytime hefeweizen counterpart"
"Lastly, it goes down petty smooth. It has a nice low level of carbonation, starts out wet, has a nice medium body and then it finishes with a light waster crispness."
"Crisp with a creamy mouthfeel. Overall very likable."
"Pours a dark caramel brown with an inch thick foamy ecru head. Smells of biscuit breads, clove, and slight hint of banana. Tastes similarly with a weary sweet clove. The banana isn't noticeable in the taste as it was in the nose. The mouthfeel is full, but not quite what I would call thick. The unfiltered proteins make for that recognizable and enjoyable texture. A very drinkable and versatile beer for food pairing. Always enjoyable having this familiars beer in front of me."
"Absolutely awesome!"
"Loving Dunkels . nice beer here ."
"Boy what a nice drinker. Those Germans, they sure know how to make a nice wheat ale."
"Poured from the bottle to a weizen glass."
"This beer is just about as enjoyable as the regular Franziskaner Hefe. This one poured out as a murky brown color with a fluffy light tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer is a little spicier than the regular version and still holds onto the banana aromas. The taste of the beer is earthy and a little spicy, the clove and banana still shine through. The mouthfeel of the beer is on the thicker side as well. Overall this beer is really pretty good and totally worth trying."
"O: A fantastic Dunkelweizen, this is a beer I'd definitely drink again."
"O - A surprisingly tasty treat. Improves as it warms and gets a bit spicier. As a hefeweizen fanatic, I prefer this dunkel to their straight, light hefe, which is itself a beauty."
"O) I really enjoyed this beer and am glad to know its well stocked here in Chicago."
"Overall couldnt ask for a better dunkel."
"O- Average, maybe it isn't my style of beer. However, the rotted banana flavor probably isn't going to make anyone happy."
"Overall-If you like Dunkels, I would buy this. If you dont, then I wouldn't. Plain Jane."
"O: Straightforward but really good tasting. It’s sweet and easy to drink. Definitely worth a taste."
"D - Outstanding. Delicious and quaffable, this is a Dunkelweizen done right. Definite reco here."
"a very malty and dry (in the palate, the nose is quite fruity) Weissbier, could be mistaken for a light bodied stout in a blind tasting .... lacks a bit of freshness and fruityness (in the palate) of a typical Weizen ...."
"Pours a dark ruby brown with about 1cm of lumpy and creamy head that sticks around forever. Smells spicy, yeasty and of noble hops. The taste is of caramel, yeast and and very sweet. Just enough bitterness to offset the sweetness. Not much in the way of hop flavor. The mouthfeel is creamy and heavy, slightly fizzy. Overall, it's very drinkable, especially if you like hefes, and I do."
"Overall: The smell was the best part. A good beer, but I would have liked the flavor to pop a little bit more."
"O (D) - this is pretty good. Not spectacular. Solid, tasty."
"The feel of this beer is smooth and pretty drinkable. A really great beer for a low price."
"D-very smooth and highly drinkable. Would love to have this with food. I will drink this again."
"Even though the Franz brand has fallen into the hands of macro giants, this brew along with its varieties still maintain their resounding reliability. I'll continue to buy them as long as it stays that way. Cheers!"
"O- a good dunkel smooth and tasty but could use some more depth in the taste..to make it top tier"
"O-it seemed to get more watery as i drank it. i didn't appreciate that. i had 500mL of this. the first 200 were great. the last 300 had lost a lot of quality. it just doesn't have a lot of robustness to be considered a great dunkel"
"Enjoyable and drinkable. Not the best dunkel out there but very accessible, available, and affordable."
"Poured a cloudy deep mahogany brown into a weiss glass, with a small tan head. The smell was of sweet malts, bubble gum, and clove. The taste was excellent on this one: Banana bread, clove, bubblegum, dried orange peel, and some floral hops. This is a very good beer, that I would recommend to anyone. It is very easy to drink and would not offend immature palates."
"Bro. Francis came roaring out of his home, resulting in a big foamy finger of tan head with moderate retention. Color was a VERY cloudy dark reddish-brown. Nose was big with a pleasant admixture of banana and clove with the former leading the way and the latter directly underneath. Mouthfeel was big and full with banana the main attraction, followed by pink bubble gum and then clove spiciness. It is a good thing that I have been exposed to a number of hefeweizens recently or I would have HATED this. I am more mature in terms of my palate, so it is palatable, but I am still not a big fan of the banana esters being so prevalent. Finish reminded me of banana bread, simply in liquid form, which is appropriate since it was the monks who first referred to beer as ""liquid bread"". I just wish that the clove/spiciness had been more forward."
"O: A refreshing beer, went down quite easy. nice change of pace from all the hops I usually consume. Next time BevMo has them on sale for $2 I'll grab some more."
"I am always impressed by Franziskaner. Quality and consistency. Head is constructed by tiny bubbles with a cream color. Head retention is seemingly endless and leave thick rings on the glass. Hazy brown color. Smells of caramel malt and wheat yeast. Much less banana aroma than I remember the Hefeweizen being. Pretty appetizing looking and smelling. Full and amazingly smooth mouthfeel. Acidity is just right. Bananas come across in the flavor much more than the smell. Nicely balanced caramelized sweetness. The darker malts are just delicious. Great beer."
"An easy drinker. I could have zipped through a few more of these."
"Overall / Drinkability: A solid good beer, but one that needs to warm up to 65F or more to really be good. Good with a meal (salmon cakes, new potatoes) and by itself after the meal."
"D: I generally like dunkelweizens more than the lighter versions. This one is not an exception, and a really fine drinker. Only the best traits from Dunkels and Weizens ( and then some) all rolled into one."
"Not so loud in aroma - the proper scents are there, yet weak (glassware?). Surprised the head poofed out as quickly as it did. Giving it the benefit of the doubt here, though. It's a solid beer - extremely drinkable like it's companion lighter version."
"I'll skip this one in the future. to many outstanding ones from others."
"O-A fantastic summer beer. I like keeping a few around and hitting them up every once in while. It's not something I would want to drink every day, but a great once a week summer beer."
"I suppose I like dark colors more than light colors, but between that and a few light darker malt notes this beer comes off as bit better than their other beer. Still I’ve had far better Dunkels."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Overall: Very enjoyable. Not as good as Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel, but is easier to find. I'm enjoying the dunkelweizen style quite a bit."
"O- High drinkability, a simple and yet fullfilling taste. A perfect beer for the summer"
"Overall a good session brew for a warmer spring day."
"First had this on tap in a 22 oz. glass. It was kind of disappointing. I'm a big fan of dunkels, and in my early drinking days, I saw ""dunkel"" on this tap handle, so I ordered it up without a second thought. When I saw the ""light," golden brown tea color come out of the tap, I was disappointed right away. When I think ""dunkel"" I think something darker nearing schwarzbier territory. Then I noticed it's also a hefeweizen. So it's a blend? It was then that I discovered that there are such things as dunkelweizens. :) Anyway, it was okay, but just not what I was expecting. Smell of dried fruits and malts. Bready taste, with some light fruits coming through, dried bananas, and a bit acidic and harsh. Medium body, and average drinkability...22oz. was alot."
"All great brews, but this was my favorite of the Franziskaner -weizen's."
"O - fairly drinkable - a nice balanced beer, but left me wanting a bit more."
"O - Tasted very nice but lacked a little everywhere else. Overall though, I'd enjoyed this because of the taste."
"overall - this is a very solid dunkel that i have had many times but never reviewed - this was a great buy @ 1.99 a bottle"
"Very drinkable. This one goes down smooth and really hits the spot."
"Almost didn't want to finish this tapped beer. The fruit flavor is past expiration and nothing else grabs onto me. Not my cup of tea...er..."
"Overall very good, I want to try more in this style and will definately recommend this one."
"D- 3.5 I am disappointed by this, frankly. I remember the original Franziskaner being a tasty hefe and so I was excited to learn that they also had a dunkel. Unfortunately it just didn't live up to expectations. It was a little bland and watery; while I could probably down a bunch of these I wouldn't want to if I had other options."
"I likes me some dunkelweizen, and Franziskaner is a classic. Even when I was in Germany, it was my go-to. Great balance, crisp, and a super summer beer."
"At the bar that I run Franziskaner Dunkel is a staple on our wall. When ever I want a good beer this one never fails. It's dark in color and the smell is only average. The taste is refreshing and easy to drink. It's a little sweet with a light bite. I highly recommend this beer when you run across it."
"D: When I think Dunkel, I typically think of a good warming winter beer with lots of malt sweetness. This just doesn't fit the bill."
"A generally good or above average beer. I will consider keeping a few of these on hand for when I need them."
"D: For the price of this beer it's really tough to beat. A solid dunkelweizen."
"Pours a cloudy oak brown with a fairly retentive and aromatic head. A mix of subtle, but complex citrus, spice, and grassy aromas bounce of the carbonation. Taste is of wheat, caramel, and wonderful dunkel flavor, with medium to full body, and a highly carbonated smooth, crisp aftertaste. Nearly perfectly balanced, a brew worthy of Bavarian Kings. If I could live off of nothing but beer, I think I could do it with this one. It's not the most extravagant, but refined, and true to the style."
"Short white head, dark caramel brown body. Floral, nutty scent. Very hoppy, tobacco flavor. Balanced. Very mild bitterness, but becomes noticeable as time goes on because the bitterness there is sticks to the tongue. Smooth, fully bodied mouthfeel. Very drinkable, could drink these all the time."
"Drinkability: A great beer to drink. I like the sweet fruity flavors and the smooth creaminess. I am a big fan of dunkelweizen and I think this is very good and drinkable."
"There are some good things going on in this beer. The smell is good. The taste isn't as good as it could be, but it is still solid. This beer isn't a world beater, but it stands up on it's own."
"Poured out with alot of head. Golden color but the smell didn't impress me. smelled like a cross between band-aid material and hand soap with a hint of banana peel. Feels very watery on the palate with very malty wheat flavor. Probably the last time I will try this one."
"D: Pleasant, but a bit uninspired. This isn't as good as Franziskaner's hefeweizen, primarily due to its relatively flat, watery finish. Not the most exciting version, but fairly enjoyable at any rate."
"Yeah, this beer's drinkable. Too damn drinkable for what I paid for it. Honestly, this beer's a pretty big disappointment after my first experience with Franziskaner. But I guess not every brewery can be perfect."
"Drink - Another solid beer from this brewer. I did however prefer their regular Hefeweizen to this beer."
"Overall a solid example of the dunkelweizen style."
"I had this right after the Weihenstephaner version of this style, and to be quite honest, that one was quite a bit better. This one just doesn't have the banana and clove I've come to expect. Everything is restrained. It's drinkable....but not a top choice."
"Caramel-brown in tone with a huge frothy head, this German dunkel is thick and tasty, with a well-balanced sweetness and a hint of spice. A delicious and deep brew with hints of banana, clove, and caramel, this one's well-worth seeking out. Thoroughly satisfying."
"drinkability; a very easy drink, super refreshing and nice for a warm spring day."
"One of my new favorites, especially for the fall."
"D/M: smooth but has a strong depth, slight sweetness makes it quite drinkable but it does sit a little heavy"
"Overall: This is a readily available mass-procuced German beer that anyone can appreciate. A great gateway beer for noobies, and a great price to boot. When I'm at a loss in my local beer store, I can always count on this one."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a tulip glass. Small amount of head, no lacing, nice brown cloudy tint with cloudiness. Taste is nice and wheaty with some cooked malt, slightly fruity. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with some carbonation. As far as drinkability is concerned, I am certain I could have a small session with this."
"This is a very drinkable Dunkelweizen, but there are other examples of the style I'd reach for."
"Appearance is an opaque rich brown with a very active head at first pour, let it settle and stirred up some of the yeast at the bottom of the bottle then finished the pour with a consistet 1/4"" head at finish pour. Head went away after about a minute. Lace sticks around and slowly climbs down glass. Smells malty, chocolaty, sweet. Taste is thick, rich with malty goodness and very light hints of chocolate or toffee, banana is really coming thru more in taste than in smell. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, nice even taste with sweet aftertastes and undertones. I would definitely drink this again. Sits very well on an empty stomach. A very nice composition for a Weisse."
"Mouthfeel was very smooth with a good carbonation balance. Drinkability is respectable. Not a flavor powerhouse or the best of breed, but gets the job done."
"Pours a transparent brown color, a little on the lighter side of the brown spectrum. Has a tall white head that sticks around for a little while. Smells of wheat banana clove and other spices. Taste is very similar, very smooth, sweet and balanced. A great tasting beer with a clean finish. Lighter body with medium carbonation. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that is very sessionable."
"Overall, a very solid Dunkelweiss and one I'd gladly drink again as long as the price is reasonable."
"Pours a very nice ruby red auburn color with some nice cloudiness and a large 3finger head that recedes quicker than a traditional hefeweizen. Great looking body. The aroma is big time banana fosters, rub and brown sugar. Some steeped raisins and a hint of vanilla round out the body. Carbonation cleanses your palate but is not overwhelming and rather silky on the palate as it transitions between wheat malts and caramelized malts on the finish. Great beer overall and again, this is a beer I used to pass by all the time. Really worth a shot."
"Dark and hazy amber body, crowned with a rich 2-finger head, leaving random blots of lacing. Banana, yeast, cloves, and bread in the nose. Thin body with buttery feel and fairly aggressive carbonation for the style. Flavor palette is built on a sweet malt foundation, slightly overpowering wheat, the banana esters, and clove phenols, though they complement each other very well. Easy to quaff and quite refreshing, nothing to write home about, but very dependable and classic."
"D: Very drinkable and enjoyable, especially if you're in the mood for a good German ale."
"Overall, pretty much you're bog-standard dunkelweiss. Nice and easy to drink."
"Pours a dark brown almost cider like color with a thick four finger head which gives resides to a thin layer with a little bit of lacing. The aroma is of spiciness and a slightly fruit bite, with hints of clove, banana, and citrus. The taste has a caramel malt backbone with some toffee and a hint of darks fruits with hints of banana and clove also there is a slight hop bite at the end.. The mouthfeel is moderate to low carbonation and is slightly thin. The drinkability is good, a very smooth flavor that is nice and well rounded."
"Notes:"
"This beer brings me to the rare occasion where it smells better than it tastes. The smell had me anxious to take the first sip, but I was slightly disappointed by the taste. The smell makes me anticipate a great Belgian beer, but the taste is lacking the kick I was hoping for. It is an average beer that does not meet expectations."
"This beer is extremely quaffable and very refreshing. It would be nice if it had a bit more of a contribution from the Dunkel side of it, but this was still a well made and heartily enjoyed beer."
"Serious head on this one about four fingers of light brown frothy bubbles. The amber color rates a 9 on the SRM beer color scale. This brew is not as clear as most because of the amount of little bubble action happening. Deep aroma of malt, berries, yeast, and wheat. Wonderful flavor of grains and fruit, but the best is the aftertaste, yeast roll with jam. Feels good in my mouth as it rolls over my tongue and around my teeth, good zing, but not over baring with carbonation. Being a little pricey it would not be one of my regulars, but for a treat and guests I would spring for this fine Dunkelweizen (dark wheat)."
"Poured in a weissen glass, with a deep amber color and cloudy look. The head is very large, three inches high, that is beige color. A yeasty and bread fragrance at the start, then blending to a strong and lasting scent of cloves. The taste starts with a hearty bread flavor, then to slightly tart citrus flavor, moving to a spicy clove taste. It all finishes with a yeasty twang flavor, that lingers on the palate for some time. A light watery feel at the front and stays that way all the way till the finish, that is when it gains a slight bit of weight. The palate is left with a clean dry finish. A classic, nothing more to say. The aroma is spicy and intoxicating. The look is dark, cloudy and inviting. The taste is yeasty and bready, with a feel that makes you wanting more."
"D: Very easy to drink, great on a hot day. Would have to switch it up after 2 or 3 tho."
"Overall, I could drink gallons of this beer and keep coming back for more."
"Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but still with a good drinkability, due to the pleasant carbonation."
"Taste is sharp and sweet and wheaty. It's creamy and rich with a sharp bite. It's really creamy and drinkable. Very easy drinking."
"D- This is a average drinker which makes me a little dissapointed since just the Hefe is great. Can't win them all and to be honest this is a average drinker for me."
"This is a solid dunkel. Wonderful flavor and I would get it all the time if I could. Lacking in a few areas but makes up for it in flavor - where it counts."
"Would be great on a hot day. I'd have one a little colder than what I just tried. 2 would be about tops as I would have to switch to something lighter."
"D: Easy to drink. A low ABV makes this quite sessionable."
"D= It was an ok beer, but I was expecting a lot more flavor and some backbone."
"goes down ok. nothing earth-shattering and nothing I haven't had before. Malt flavors are the most dominant (especially as it warms) but not the most pleasant. Not bad, but I like others in the style better."
"Although it's not the most extravagant or extreme ale, this beer is nicely balanced and eminently drinkable. Refreshing on a warm summer night."
"Final Notes: Perhaps not the best Dunkel out there, but very good indeed and I liked it a lot."
"Drinkability: Deceptive. This offering with its not-too-overpowering-taste or ""buzz"" sensation one could go a little nuts with this before you knew what hit you. Probably a good all-around brew to drink with about any sort of good food."
"Hazy, coppery amber with a short beige cap. Good head retention, clumpy lacing. Strong banana and clove in the aroma, bready yeast, lemons and wheat crackers. Slight brown sugar character. The flavour was bready with lemon and banana, slight tartness. Mild bitterness. I found it to be overly dry, which probably explained the thin mouthfeel. The only thing holding the texture together was the carbonation. I liked the aroma, but was ultimately disappointed with the beer."
"D: I will drink about three of these before I am full. It is filling. this is a meal in a glass."
"Poured into a pint glass, a cloudy brown-orange with a big clumpy 3 finger head that reduces to 1/4 inch after about a minute. Minimal lacing. A nutty smell of almonds, cloves, and wheat. Medium to light bready taste with a subtle bite of cinnamon. Faint cider similarities. A pleasantly light carbonation to the tongue followed by a smooth swallow. A year-round session brew for all occasions. Though not as good as the regular hefe-weisse, I still like it very much. The Spaten brewery can do no wrong."
"Drinkability is so-so. Their regular is better, but this one ain't bad. It lacked a bit for the style. Not in a big hurry to have another."
"At Croxley's Ale House in NYC. Into a weizen glass, it poured a chestnut brown with less than a finger of offwhite head, average retention, and average lacing. Little visible carbonation. Smelled of banana, clove, lemon/lime, brown sugar, and cocoa powder. The taste was a great blend of the aforementioned flavors, with some caramel also sneaking into the finish. A smooth, modestly carbonated medium bodied beer. Nicely drinkable."
"D. Very drinkable. I could put this one away by the case. Not too heavy just ultra smooth and creamy. What more could you ask from when drinking a German hefeweizen."
"Overall, a very good beer, a must try."
"poured from a 500ml bottle into a Weizen Glass, nice head, with god retention. Smell is pretty much your average hefeweizen smell, and so is the taste. Mouthfeel is OK, if a bit watery, and the taste is good, but not great . All in all, a pretty good beer, but I'm not sure it's worth the steep price here in Brazil (usually the equivalente to U$ 5.00 for a 500ml bottle)"
"Drinkability: not too impressed...a little too wheaty with that sweet candy flavour that leaves it a tad sickly. One is enough for tonight."
"A good dunkel without being mind-blowing. A rusty water kind of colour with a tight collar and good lacing. No surprises on the nose with those cloves and banana notes shining through. A nice earthy kind of yeast aroma backing up. Smooth, dry not at all cloying. A slight nutmeg presence on the palate with the slightly grainy yeastiness. Overall a pretty good beer. Not much to dislike about this."
"D: Very good! Easy to drink and enjoyable to do so. Not as good as the Franziskaner Hefeweissbier, but still a sold brew."
"Very sessionable dark wheat brew. This would be easy going on a nice summer day."
"D: I could drink this beer all day if I didn't have a life or job. It is refreshing and at 5% alcohol, very much sessionable."
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable, can't think of a better beer in terms of richness that remains so drinkable (except maybe Weihenstephaner)"
"Overall, the pint drank pretty easy. No real problems finishing it. The only difference with this beer was the roasted malts that I picked up."
"D - At 2.99 a big bottle at my local Giant E it's easily going to something I would pick up from time to time. Man I could drink it all the time."
"I prefer the Franziskaner Hefe but this is really a great beer. A bit too sweet and the texture--creamy vs. smooth--is not where I want it to be. If you like wheat beers, definitely worth a go."
"Drinkability - This is an very good beer for the style. It will be on my short list."
"I'm usually not a big fan of dunkels. I think darker malts and higher alcohol content usually doesn't work with an unfiltered wheat beer. It usually ends up being a terrible combination of cloying sweetness and overpowering alcohol. This one is everyone thing I want in a Hefe with some dark malts that don't get in the way of its refreshing quality. I still prefer Franziskaner's regular hefe, as well as straight up hefe's in general, but this is a very nice dunkel that makes me rethink my dislike of them in general."
"D: The lower alcohol and rich flavor are big plusses. I'm struggling to come up with any minuses..."
"D: could be a christmas beer, like most all German beers its very easy to drink."
"O: I get some of the deeper malts in this one, but still the characteristic phenols. A nice beer, I prefer it to the blond."
"D- A very drinkable dark wheat beer... sessionable even."
"Definitely an easy drinker. Quite good overall but I'd prefer if a little more of the aroma was apparent in the taste."
"Another smoky-smelling German brew that doesn't quite compare to a few beers from Aecht, but for half the price per bottle, I can't complain. A solid, thick head covers a beer with a surprisingly, unfortunately thin body. The taste builds with each sip, however- kind of smoky, meaty, and rich. Hovers around in your mouth for quite some time after the beer is finished. This is a very sensory drink, which I'll probably buy again in the future."
"D: One of my favorite session beers; I could drink this all day--especially in the summer."
"D: Complex and flavorful taste profile. Medium-bodied. Low ABV. This Dunkelweizen is about as sessionable as it gets. Cheers!"
"Easily drinkable, albeit a bit on the thin side. Not as bold as others of the style, but likely good in large quantity."
"Session beer? This has it written all over it. Sure, it's a slightly bigger bottle than what I'm used to but no matter. It didn't take me long to work my way through this. The sediment and opaqueness of this were the best aspects, but I wish that the taste was as full as its appearance. If you're looking for a good accessible beer, look no further!"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both textbook hefeweizen and benchmark type material."
"D: Very smooth and easy to imbibe. Nice and refreshing."
"Drinkability is huge. Went down far too smoothly on a warm Spring day. I've never been a huge Franziskaner fan, but this one won me over."
"The Franziscaner Dunkel Weizen pours into the tall glass in typical cloudy weizen style, topping off with an off-white dense head. Aroma is heavy on the banana, a bit spicy cloves and faint caramel. Slightly creamy texture with a slight bit of carbonation. Thin to medium overall. Dry finish. Enjoyed it in the late evening with a cool wind blowing across the deck."
"D: This goes down very smoothly and is a breeze to drink. I could easily drink these all day long."
"Pours a cloudy brown color with a finger of slightly tanned head. Fair amount of retension and minor spotty lacing on the glassware. Aroma of cloves, malt and slight bit of fruitiness lingers. Taste is equally clovey with malt sweetness. Thin body and lightly carbonated. There is a slight amount of breadiness and yeast that remains in the mouth."
"D - very drinkable as a dunkel should be, the carbonation is the only barrier to me having a few of these"
"I must first say that I am not a huge wheat beer fan, but this beer did impress me despite my initial reservations. Tasted from the bottle at the Al Udeid ""Bra"" cantina. The appearance is a hazy light amber/copper color with a good sized cream-colored head from a gentle pour. Smells fruity with subtile yeast character. Taste is good (again despite my wheat beer reservations), lots of creamy fruit, banana and heavy clove. I can also detect coriander and bitter orange peel, not my favorite flavors but they are balanced well by the residual sweetness of the beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and the flavors are not cloying on the palate, as each sip leave you ready for another immediately following. Overall impression is this beer is well crafted, but not something I would want to spend the entire night drinking."
"Drinkability: this beer was easy to consume. A few could be had in a session. Slightly less refreshing than the Hefe."
"D: This beer would be more drinkable were it not for its high carbonation. Somehow, despite an otherwise balanced flavor profile, I could not imagine drinking more than one of these in a session."
"D:Very drinkable cand drink quite a bit of these with out realizing it. i would buy this beer agian if i was out to eat of in a bar having a few but i dont think i would buy it buy the case any time soon not that its bad just that after i drink it one day i dont wanna drink it the next."
"D: Fighting the carbonation all night won't make for an easy drinker"
"Notes: Fair offering and worth the repeat but without much making it worth searching for either."
"Under a thick dense head that didn't last very long and left no lacing at all, lied a banana bread smelling, semi sweet malt flavor with a really low bitterness. Despite an after taste that slapped a moderately strong malt imprint on my palette with every sip, I surprisingly experienced a good drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is a medium light with a fizzy amount of carbonation."
"O: Good drinkability. Easydrinking. Not as good as the Hefe-Weizen version but still a nice and pleasant German ""to the bone"" beer"
"D: This beer tastes like an old, infected brown ale. I'm really disappointed here, but will give it another shot and re-review in the event that I got a bad bottle."
"Drinkability: This is a decent beer. I like whats there, but it needs a little more body."
"D: A little bit to thin in body for beeing a great beer. Now it's just a nice beer."
"D: Not bad, but not great. There are a lot better examples of Dunkelweizens out there."
"The drinkability is still pretty high, though."
"Mouthfeel - Full/medium body, smooth with lots of carbonation."
"Can't give it good reviews on mouthfeel and drinkability. Its value to me is that of something different to sip, but I don't see myself going back to these."
"d-could have a couple..nothing to really brag about but good enough to have another"
"The Franziskaner Dunkel pours a hazy reddish brown in the glass with a thick white froth, great retention, & good lacing. Aromas of dark berry esters, raisin, banana, fresh wheat, & freshly baked biscuits that follow through on the palate with an added red hard candy flavor. Overall, a solid brew that I could easily see myself drinking a lot of (& at 5% abv...I probably could too!) Recommended."
"Medium mouthfeel, not too full, finishes tingly and bubbly. Tasty beer, very drinkable."
"T- Highly carbonated, very wheaty. Slight spice to it. It has a bit of a dark malt taste. Nice balance. High quality. Highly recommend."
"Drinkability: A really nice dunkel weizen, with plenty of banana and spice flavors; perhaps a bit too sweet, but spicy through and through"
"pour is a dingy amber cloud. a banana forward dunkelweizen. nose heavy of wheat and initial bubblegum. palate is wheat malt and apple. some toasted qualities. very mild beer that leaves me searching... and not really finding. essentially a toasty wheat malt that goes down a tad sweet and a tad lemon sour."
"Drinkability: A really nice dunkelweizen, with plenty of banana and spice flavors; perhaps a bit too sweet, but spicy through and through"
"Rich mahogany color with cloudy light brown on the edges. Retention is good, but not much lace is produced. Tart dark fruit and yeast aromas are evident as soon as the beer is poured. Flavor is not as impressive, but includes yeasty banana and clove with a lingering wheat sweetness. Light-ish body with carbonation on the high side. A reliable and very drinkable dunkel, but certainly not the best of the style."
"D: I'm gonna give this a 5 because it has a certain X-factor that I can't really put a tangible measure on...but I think that this beer excels at being thoroughly enjoyable. I'd drink this again any time."
"D - I don't remember liking this beer much when in Germany, but not bad. I would have another."
"Drinkability: I really like how the wheat and malt come together here. A good example of the style, I could have one more, but not two. I think the taste is nice and multi-layered."
"D - It's good, but there are a couple examples of the style that I've had that're better. The price is pretty nice, though, at $3.50 per 500ml. Ayinger's Ur-Weiss, which is my favorite, is unfortunately a couple dollars more for the same size."
"A pleasant surprise to find this one on tap at my local watering hole. Wasn't sure what to expect, but the dunkel version compliments the standard Hefe nicely. A little heavier, with more flavor. Less of the standard ""bland"" wheat flavor found with many hefe's. Some spices detected. Overall, a joy to drink....From the biggest glass available"
"muddy brown with 2 fingers of head, that leave nothing behind. notes of caramel, dark fruit and cherries. taste is some banana, a lot of clove in the back end of it. no residual bitterness. a bit sweet. a slight hint of cherries in there too. mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, with a residual stickiness. wish it was a bit drier."
"Not bad, I really enjoy this style, especially in the autumn, even though it is not personally my all-time favorite. I downed this like it was nothing, and since the guy on the label and tap handle looks God-like, this was probably intended as his session beer. If I find it locally at a decent price, I might try it again. But I wouldn't go far and wide to search it out."
"The aroma is filled with wheat and some fruity esters. It is not the most inviting aroma unfortunately. The taste is somewhat cereal like but it finishes cleanly. No aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little thin but that is ok for this style, beer is very wet. Overall a decent beer, but I've had better dunkels."
"Drinkability is okay. It's not difficult to down by any means, but the different taste and thin feel aren't going to make me want to drink more than one. I've had better dunkelweizens, so I think I'll stick with them before I think about revisiting this one."
"D- This beer has a nice taste but the dry bitter finish just didn't do it for me."
"D: A perfect beer for a nice late summer day. The light body and low ABV make it easy to drink multiples without fear of doing something dumb. A great beer."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a murky terra-cotta and brown color with three fingers of billowing head. The retention was ok but the lacing pretty good off the collar. The aroma was of wheat, a little caramel malt and toffee, cloves and Belgian yeast. The flavors were similar but not great for the style. Toasted grains and caramel sweetness dominated with only allusions to the spices and tangy yeast that lurked beneath. I kept expecting the later flavors to bloom as it warmed up but it never happened. The mouthfeel was foamy, the carbonation high and the body medium."
"Drinkability is very high, as the flavor is pleasant and there is no hint of the alcohol at all."
"Drinkability: It's much spicier than I expected, but it's still enticing, complex, and smooth. Oh, it's drinkable."
"fairly smooth to drink, slightly bitter aftertaste, a hint of hops."
"Picked this up at Whole Foods in Dublin, Ohio. Was eager to try a Dunkelweizen again after a lengthy respite from the variety (not intentional, just how things came into being). This was a good choice."
"Cloudy russet brown with a fine whipped head of sand colored foam. The nose is clove heavy with soft banana and cocoa. Nutty and spicy flavors of cocoa, clove, banana and lemon zest. Some fresh bready yeastiness. Medium bodied with a lot of good carbonation. Top notch."
"This is a beer that I would drinking during the fall, and something I would enjoy with a nice cigar. Possibly a beer to recommend to someone who is exploring dark beers."
"A final pour was a bit aggressive by accident and resulted in excessive foam formation, followed by a lighter bodied brew. So pour carefully, especially if the bottle has had any time to warm up."
"Very drinkable and refreshing, I would buy it again."
"Notes - Good moutfeel and carbonation."
"D - Very drinkable, good yeast character with an undeniable malt richness. I had not had one of these in several years and after drinking this one, I think I will be making it a more regular option."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable, but perhaps a little heavy body for a real session beer. I could see enjoying this beer in a lot of different settings, though."
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Aroma is of wheat and bananas with cloves. Taste is very flavorfull and quite good. Malty with notes of clove and banana. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"Poured into my Paulaner Weisbeer glass. Gorgeous maple syrup color, with a 3 inch head which holds for several minutes. Nose is banana, clove, malt and some caramel. Taste is bit more subtle than I hoped, carbonation is abundant and seems to constrain the flavor. With effort, you get some banana and light malt with very mild bitterness. A little sweet mid-way but very mild again. Easy to drink, really easy to drink and refreshing but was hoping for a little more flavor. Still a very, very good beer just a little less than what I had hoped for from this brewery."
"D- Very easy to drink and somehow not overly sweet. The bannana may get to me though."
"I've had this quite a few times recently from the bottle and each time it's been a little different, I think because of the age of the bottle. This review is based on the freshest example, but the other bottles may have altered my thinking a little bit. The appearance is plain with an offwhite head that I would like to be a tad darker and a simple brown body. It's dark enough so that the yeast haze adds to the tone. The smell is of caramel and banana's but not nearly aromatic enough. It could use some more intensity in the aroma to really pull it off. The taste is quite nice with the caramel, molasses and chocolate of the darker malts coming out with the support of a fruity yeast background. It adds to the mouthfeel which is creamy and light thanks to the wheat. Quite drinkable, more so than many of the style, and a little lower in alcohol to make it sessionable. If I had other dunkels available I would skip this but it's not bad when the craving hits."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and a great Hefe for fall or winter due to the heartier malt flavors. Another winner from Spaten-Franziskaner-Bräu."
"This brew is very drinkable. A very solid brew. This would be a nice alternate to the Franziskaner Hefe brew to try from this brewery from time to time. I dont have much expierence with the dunkleweisse brews, but this is very good. This brew is not exceptional - but I am not sure this style brew is intended to do that, at least fot me anyway."
"Taste is descent, but nothing special, a little burned Malts and the characteristic earthy fruit of a weiss beer... Then it finishes with a....wait nothing mouthfeel is like water and finish is a bit sweet and bitter, like a coors weiss beer, bummer!"
"D: Drinkable if all the complex flavors work"
"MF&D - body could be bigger, thicker, more carbonated. carbonation really starts to get weak after the brew warms up. again, though the beer is kind of lame it would easily be sessionable since it is infact so bland"
"It will be a disappointmnet to finish this beer. Very drinkable, and delicious."
"D-This I could session all night long. It's not an impressive beer, ""perse""... But I could really drink the mess out of this and enjoy it."
"D - While it's medium-bodied the pairing of the flavor and the creamy mouthfeel makes it a delight to drink. It's not superb in this category but good enough to partake in more than one."
"D -- Outstanding. I've had this on tap before and I almost like the bottle better -- maybe better handling."
"Overall, a little disappointing, compared to the regular hefe. But, that's a very high standard."
"D: I'd drink another one. I'd put it somewhere in the middle of all the dunkels I have ever tried."
"I enjoyed this."
"A rather standard Dunkel Weizen. IT is probably better paired with some German cuisine or BBQ than on its own."
"While it may not pack what I was looking for, it's a very drinkable Dunkel and quite refreshing. Not bad just hoping for more."
"d amazingly smooth drink, would definitely purchase this beer again. very smooth"
"5.0% ABV, on tap at Mecklenburg Gardens, Cincinnati"
"Pours a hazy dark amber/brown. Sizeable head diminishing slowly to light head - head is beige. Pleasant, sweet aroma of caramel, chocolate, toast, dark fruits and definite yeast notes. Well-balanced, smooth with plenty of taste. I'd be happy to sit and enjoy several of these with friends. Alas, I bought only two. But they will be enjoyed - Cheers!"
"Not as bad as these tasting notes make it sound, however if I was to recommend a sample of the style - this wouldn't be it."
"Overall it's a decent Dunkelweizen, not complex or flavorful enough to rate high, but still gets the job done..."
"I found this beer to be very dull and bland. I was expecting it to taste much different. First off, the mouthfeel was very thin and watery; and overly carbonated. The taste was just a little bready and a little sweet, not much going on here at all. I enjoy the regular Franziskaner Hefe fine, which is also why I was surprised. Obviously it would be easy to put a few of these away, but doesn't seem worth it to me."
"Overall: flavors and aroma are great and unique. Enjoyable. The carb seems a little too much for me."
"This is a hefe weiss, and despite the non creamy mouthfeel I'm used to is impressive."
"Drinakability: Sessionable. quality price ratio is great. Although a very awkward style, it ends up working well, but still confusing at times."
"500ml bottle $2.49. Nice dark, cloudy brown color poured into a pilsener glass and had a foamy head but now its just a two centimeter blanket atop the beer. Aroma is slightly spiced but not what I would expect from a hefe, average. taste is nice and fruity and almost makes me think of chocolate bread for some reason. Not a bad beer at all considering the price."
"Notes: For me I felt that this beer had a few ruff edges but overall was good."
"Overall: not impressed"
"Drinkability: Pretty nice and unique , I'd like to have one more please!"
"One of the better Dunkelweizens out there, one of my favorites this time of year as the weather is warming but it hasn't gotten too hot."
"Tasty."
"It was pretty drinkable. I liked it."
"D - Drinkability is good, a very clean refreshing beer overall. Pleasant taste and smooth mouthfeel allow this to be an easy session brew."
"Drinkability: This is probably my favorite weißier and maybe the most ""interesting"" beer I have ever tasted. It has some very interesting and complex flavors, and I'm sure if mine were colder it would be extremely refreshing as other beers of the style are."
"Pours dark brown with fluffy thick head. There was a huge CO2 release when I opened the beer. Yeasty sweet banana clove scent. At first there is a roasted malt flavor followed by the banana clove spiciness. This particular batch was very carbonated and it was noticable with a tingle on the tongue. small bitterness in the aftertaste, but no apparent hop flavors. I'm not sure if this batch was overcarbonated but it I like how the carbonation tingle, which appeared spicy, segued with the clove spiciness. It was very unique. Very easy drinking. I would really enjoy on a hot summer day while grilling some brats."
"Poured .5L bottle into hefe glass."
"all in all this is probably the dunkelweizen id get more often than the rest. but its not the best. but i love it none the less."
"Drinkability: A good dunkelweizen, but nothing too special."
"D - Easy enough to drink but that's because there isn't much to it. Sure it is is drinkable and has something to it but it is uninspiring and there are much better examples of the style."
"D - Overall a very enjoyable beer thats easy to drink with a good taste that I could session worth trying sometime"
"Dr It's a very peculiar tasting beer to me. I could drink a couple, but one will do for now."
"Pours a medium brown colored body, cloudy, with a big foamy creamy head, cream colored, and very lasting. Has a malty sweet aroma, light, with some roasted scents. A light fresh taste, malty, sweet. Somewhat a floral taste & aftertaste."
"Overall, a decent drinker. Not the best, but pretty good."
"Conclusion: Nice, classic Dunkelweizen...refreshing, tasty, awesome"
"It felt alright, better than your average brew, which was nice. But wasn't the most drinkable. I definitely had to take my time to get through it. Not easy going, but I was glad I got through it as it was unique."
"The drinkability on this is very good, all in all it's a fairly tasty Dunkel-Weisse,that's very easy drinking and I could definitely have a ""session"" with these."
"Overall, an average dunkelweizen, but nothing spectacular."
"I enjoyed this beer and found it quite easy to drink."
"Malty to initial taste, strong finish, nice mouthfeel and no aftertaste. Filling, certainly not a session beer, but nevertheless decent drinkability, better than the regular Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse in my opinion."
"OVERALL: Solid, very drinkable and enjoyable. Not quite as good as I remember it when I lived in Germany, but I'd certainly line up for more. Recommended."
"A great example of a Dunkelweizen, and for me much easier to drown in than the brewery's normal Hefe, with the dominating clove and banana flavors so inherent to the lighter version of the style being balanced nicely with the darker, maltier flavors. Very refreshing."
"D: It was quite easy to drink"
"An easy drinker but for me Dunkels just don't go down as easy as hefe. That being said I can easily session this beer in the winter months. As a matter of fact it is on my fall/winter session short list."
"Pours a cloudy brown, tan head with nice retention. Smells of malts and light fruits and some nice sweetness. Nice smooth malty taste with nice complexity makes this one pretty enjoyable. Mild carbonation and smooth mouthfeel that you'd expect. Not my favorite dunkel but found everywhere in Bavaria."
"Pours a hazy brown with dark amber edges and fluffy white head. Smell: cloves, toasted grain, wheat. Taste: clove and spice (cinnamon?) on top of tangy wheat and caramel, perhaps dried banana. Toasted and nutty flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel leaves something to be desired - light to medium bodied and a bit watery and crisp. Doesn't rate with the top German versions of the style."
"Drinkability: Pass. While not bad any stretch of the imagination, it fails to show the depth, grace, and deliciousnicity of the finer examples of the style."
"Drinkability is super-high. At 5%, this sucker makes for a badass session beer. And $2.55 for a 16.9'er is alright by me."
"D- Very drinkable. If only it tasted half as good as it smelled...."
"Very low ABV but to watery for me makes this not to drinkable"
"D: while not the most complex of the dunkel weissbiers, this one is certainly enjoyable and drinks very easily."
"very fizzy and refreshing to drink. decent flavor and lowish ABV make this a great session beer if you find it on sale."
"Pours cloudy copper with an off-white head. Aroma is still bananas, but more spice and toastiness. Light mouthfeel. Good yeast and malt in the taste with a back of banana and fruit. Usually more is better, but the caramel kind of took away from the cleanliness of the hefe base. I like the hefe better, but still a good beer."
"Jk"
"(rated Jul 8, 2008)"
"Overall great beer, nice balance of flavor and carbonation, could drink many more."
"Overall: An excellent example of the style that's generally easy to find and affordable; you can't really do wrong with that."
"One of the better dunkelwiesses Ive had. Color is a dark brown, very stiff head that sits above glass. Not much to the scent but this doesnt matter as the taste has much depth yet goes down easy. Perfect if you want something a little heavier but not as filling. Delicious."
"One of the best of style that nobody seems to love."
"MF&D - There may be better examples of this style out there, but I grew up on this stuff and to me its a classic. Esay drinking and delicious."
"My only complaint was the lack of complexity. I thought the flavors were too subtle."
"Pours a hazy, matte brown color with a wonderful, slightly off-white head that doesn't leave lace but has incredible retention. The nose and aroma are wonderful and extremely similar. Clove and banana make a dominating appearance along with the malt. It almost has a banana bread like quality because of the nuttiness. The mouthfeel is full yet the the beer has somewhat of a light body. Wonderful...I could drink a lot of these."
"D: Most definitely."
"Freshness may be an issue but a bottling date is nowhere to be found. The bottle is a lighter than normal brown with some greenish tints. I'm not sure the journey west did this one much good."
"D- I have no worries that I couldn't sit here, or at a pub, or anywhere and just drink this beer without thinking about it. It just goes down so easily."
"Dark brown with a real banana nose, this is a hefe on a dark kick.The spicy notes are in the first sip. Fruity but with a real malt kick in the mid body this beer takes the hefe into the winter months. Food friendly and complex I wish I could get this in BC"
"The taste is strong on whole-wheat bread, slightly tart, with banana primarily on the edge of the mouth and in a perfumy quality. It's somewhat dry and lightly zesty with a light mineral quality. The feel is a little watery feel. There is a long grain aftertaste, a light banana-bread element, and it's rather crisp and refreshing, but still doesn't do much for me."
"Pours a hazel brown color with big creamy head. Aroma of wheat and vanilla. Tastes of creamy wheat, slight vanilla extract, and light grain. A sweetness underlies the drink and enables it to be considered an any-season type brew. Does well in the autumn as a transitional, suffices as a winter brew, and satisfies the dark temptation of a someone ready to leave the summer behind."
"Drinkability is decent. I don't think this is a bad beer, I'm thinking it's just a style that I don't really care for."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This makes for a very drinkable beer that is a good change from regular Hefeweizens."
"apart from the color, what's the difference? maybe the banana is a little riper? in any even, very good!"
"Poured into an 80oz glass boot. Poured very dark with just a bit of light brown head that dissapated pretty quickly. Smelled of coffee and some alcohol could be sensed. The taste was coffee and chocolate and it went down smooth. Despite having on the medium side of a heavy body, this one was quite drinkable, as the boot took just barely over an hour so I would guess. I would definitely get this again, perhaps in a smaller container. Perhaps not!"
"D: Refreshing and light for the style of beer. Packs in plenty of flavor and like it better than the regular hefe and perfect for many a long session. Good stuff."
"This is a great beer. Drinkability is very high as it goes down super easy, perfect beer for football!"
"This brew poured a hazy brown that looked like apple cider to me. Magnificent head as you would expect with a hefe. The smell was of over-ripe fruit. The taste wasn't for me. This was my first dunkel ever and I found that after the yeast flavor, the extra-malty body provided too much sweetness for me. Not a good combination as far as I am concerned. I still love the standard Frankiskaner Hefe though!"
"Good drinkability as a thick but smooth finish. I would drink it again."
"Full feel and good flavor make a very enjoyable beer to drink."
"Overall I thought this was a solid Dunkel. Nothing is done exceptionally well, but it's very solid. Worth a shot."
"M&D: quite soft in carbonation, this dunkel weizen drinks not bad, albeit not so impressive in terms of the flavour profile and in lack of the necessary spicy edge that is indispensable for a weizen."
"Pours a very nice looking dark copper with a cream colored head. The aroma is reminiscent of a banana muffin. The taste is predominately malts with a nutty banana type taste. The beer feels pretty thick with minimal carbonation. Overall it is a pretty solid beer. I would almost say that I this better than the regular hefe iirc."
"I prefer their standard Hefe a little more. This pours a gross looking hazy amber color. Much like that of dirty, sewer water. Nice thick white head though. Taste is sweet and fruity, that of bananas and vanilla flavor. Some mild malts in there but fruitiness is the main taste. It's alright but nothing too great. Price was pretty good though. Once the beer settled down the appearance was a little well, more appealing, but at first it wasn't something I was excited to drink."
"Awesome, mine had a brown mucus plug that tasted like some kind of alcoholic vegemite - the smell of this beer really appealed to me and probably increased my enjoyment of it - I will have to try more Dunkels in the future if they are similar to this."
"Pours a very nce copper-brown (dirty) color with great head and a little bit of lacing. Has a nice crisp and malty scent, with hints of bananas and walnuts. Great taste, very deep and thick, very much like yeasty/malty/banana/nut bread. Even with its thick look and taste, it goes down quite smooth. An excellent beer."
"A lot of people don't seem to like the fact that this beer doesn't jump out and grab your throat. I actually kind of like that about it. Of course its probably because they are cheaper bastards but oh well...it makes for something a little different. I would drink it again."
"Pours a dark amber color with moderate head. Had to swirl the bottle after a 3/4 pour to get the sediment off the bottom of the bottle and the sediment immediately sank to the bottom of the glass. Appeared a little more caronated than I expected and I could hear the carbonation. It gave me a pretty good burp after just a few sips. Smells of cloves and spice but not at all overpowering. It smells stronger than it tastes. The taste is mild and and doesn't linger, so there is very little aftertaste. Very faint taste of alcohol. It drinks down real smooth and I would imagine I could drink quite a few of these."
"Drinkability: The Hacker Pschorr and this are among the cheapest of german imports, on this level at any rate. This will be one of my new session beers. Paired great with a turkey burger and clausen pickle."
"Nothing mind blowing but could easily be my everyday session brew."
"decent mouthfeel."
"Overall, this is a nice, solid dark hefe weizen. It's relatively easy to find, so pick one up and check it out!"
"D: Probably my favourite dunkelweizen I have had, though I haven't had much experience with this style, in my neck of the woods we usually just have the common German versions available. Liked this better than the Weihenstaphner, go buy it, it's cheap to boot, good beer by Spaten."
"This was a great beer with awesome drinkability. I did not like it as much as the Franziskaner Hells but overall it was a great dunkel. Plus, the price was right (it was a gift)."
"D: A pretty decent dunkel, though a little light. Goes down easy enough and certainly good to put down a few at a time."
"I've had many Hefeweizens but this is actually the first dunkelweizen that I've ever had. Pretty good stuff, very similar to a regular hefe but with more caramel flavors."
"I do like a good dunkel, and this one looks like it might fit the bill. pours a nice cloudy deep amber, with a nice off white head that wants to fade to lace but can't quite make it. the smell isn't bad either, it's got the requisite banana and clove yeast esters, and a bit of wheat malt, not as full as some but notably there. the taste is nice, the same as the smell, but a little light and the spiciness isn't there either. good mouthfeel, nice carbonation, and if it were on tap, I'd drink a lot of it."
"Pours a dark root-beer brown. Average head, but lots of lacing. Smells of yeast, but not that strongly. Flavor actually isn't that impressive; a friend of mine took a sip and says I may have gotten a bad bottle. Still not a bad taste - slightly sweet and malty, but just not that much to work with. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable, but still disappointing for a Franziskaner. I had high expectations."
"Taste is good. Some nice wheat flavors in there, slight banana flavor. Yeast is present too. Also has some roasted/toasted malt flavor which is more pronounced then the other flavors. Good mouthfeel, a bit dry. Overall not bad. Would recommend it."
"Pair it with ginger snaps, rainy summer afternoons, or a good conversation with a friend."
"A solid dunkelweizen. Poured rubyish brown, with a thick foamy head. Chunks floatin' around. Aromas , of course, of cloves, bananas, spice, sugary malt sweetness. The flavor was a bit muted, but still quite nice. Banana bread is in there. Awesome mouhfeel. Quaffable and zesty, smooth and lush. A great drinker. I could drink this everyday."
"All around, quite delicious! I'd drink it all the time if I lived in Germany."
"This is an exceptionally smooth beer, and is augmented by sedate carbonation. Outstanding drinkability marks a nice example of the style."
"Pours a cloudy brown with a big, off-white head. Smells of cloves and banannas. Taste is bready, sweet, with a slight sour twang. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, carbonation medium. Quite drinkable, somewhat low in alcohol, and would make a good session beer."
"D: very tasty, low to medium ABV, great balance of esters and spice, carbonation excellent. very re drinkable."
"D: Refreshing and light and easy to drink. The interesting yeast flavors had me curious for more which let this one do down pretty quickly as well. Interesting and cool. I liked it."
"Drinkability"" Rather drinkable. Would have again. Franzi is always fancy."
"Smell is great with the most prevalent being banana, spices, and bread. I also smell clove and a bit of something sour. Taste is like banana bread. All of the other smells are in there too. Mouthfeel is very good finish is smooth with lively carbonation."
"I was a little hesitant to try this one because I really didn't care much for Franziskaner's Hefe-Weisse. However, I actually enjoyed this brew a lot better - although I drank this one on tap so it's not an entirely fair comparison. Anyways, in the glass this brew resembles a black and tan, with a dark caramel color. The smell is reminiscent of apples and maple syrup. The carbonation and mouthfeel is excellent with a dry (but not too dry) slightly medicinal finish. An apple fruitiness dominates the flavor with hints of bubblegum sweetness. Although I found this sweetness to be more balanced than the Hefe-Weiss. Towards the end of a sip there is a tiny bit of bitterness and hoppy sting. This is not my favorite Hefe Weisse, but it's a pretty good beer on tap."
"What came out of the bottle was a murky mahagony brown with a small amount of orange highlights. This one had the usual 2 inch creamy head of white foam. Slow retention that left behind a small amount of white spots and a streak or two of white lace. This Weizen didn't have any bananas in the aroma, but it sure loved the lightly toasted malts and butter popcorn. It smelled so much like popcorn, I almost took this beer to the movies. The taste was light and wheaty with roasted wheat, a hint of lemon, subtle cloves, yeast, and some juicy fruits here and there. I thought there could have been more flavors in the beer, but I guess not. The mouthfeel was light like a Weizen should be, but this one had a faint aftertaste of malted wheat and yeast. It's just a standard German Dunkel Weizen. I honestly thought it could have been better than this. I might give it another whirl in the future."
"Pretty good example, but the yeast needs to step back a little to distinguish the dunkel side of this beer."
"Poured this into my hefe glass and received a cloudy body that was a mix of leather brown and apple cider. Left two-finger head that receeded quickly and left no lacings. A nice roasted/dry malt smell came through, accentuated by some tart fruit such as orange, cherries and also some clove. Spices are the first thing that struck me, then a warming sensation as the malty goodness came through. A slightly dry finish as the citric fruits are tucked on the backend; this a medium-bodied beer that is smooth and a tad creamy. There is some caramel in there too, but it does not make the beer that syrupy. Not the best dunkel, but I did enjoy it."
"Mostly what I thought while sipping this dunkel were it's similarities to Franziskaner's Hefe-Weisse. It's fairly identical, though the lemony aspects are absent and instead a caramel-like flavor comes through. It compliments the banana quite well, though everything is muddled and ultimately the flavor is a little weak."
"Pours a very dark orange, short lasting head with not as much carbination as the regular Hefe. Nose contains hints of yeast, bananas, some spice, with some doctor band-aids, and one of those terrible candied white chocolate waffers all sitting on top of a slice of an old raunchy orange. What can I say, the nose ruined this half-house effort for a dark wheat. The palate gives a little bit more hope with a little bit more creamyness that can off-set the off nose, but the dunkel gnome malts never really find a finish and leave you wondering where did the little flavor dunkel gnomes roll out to at the finish? I can only imagine what kind of whip they are sitting on, but i guarantee it has to have like a trillion horse-power. Its not really that atrocious, but theres better!"
"D: Very tasty beer. The banana undertones add an unique atmosphere to the beer. No sharp or shocking tastes make an easy drinking beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, even though I prefer the regular Hefeweizen to this style, this beer is a very good one to drink for a long time."
"pours a beautiful orange-golden hazy, fast rising thick head, which drops to a quarter inch and sticks around. smell is a bit of alcohol and some fruity notes lightly mixed with malt. taste follows suit - a fruity light plum-raisin and strong banana, balanced pretty well with medium malt,can deifnitely taste the alcohol on the back. As warms up a little getting more of the bitter at the end, nice touch. relatively dry finish. medium-high carbonation, very smooth, pretty refreshing."
"Definitely worth the money, but Schneider Weiss and Weihenstephaner are still the reigning champs of German Hefes in my opinion."
"I found this beer to be quite drinkable and was confused as to how I drank the 16.9 oz bottle so quickly. At only 5.0% ABV, this could certainly be a new session beer (and it's on tap at the Bulldog in uptown New Orleans) and I don't think just drinking one of these does it justice. Highly recommended."
"D: Oh so drinkable. One weizen glass is not enough! My favorite dunkelweizen that I had in Germany."
"Poured 1PT 9FL. OZ bottle into a hefeweizen glass. This was my first dunkel weisse and I was blown away. The appearance was a dark amber with a foamy/thick 1.5 inch head. It contained floral and clovey scents layered by the usual banana, wheat, and hoppy smells of a typical wheat beer. However, I felt the sweetness of this hefe was quite unique and would have to say that this beer ranks among my favorite wheat beers."
"Pours a very good looking cloudy prune brown with nice fluffy white head. Smell reeks of Banana and clove. Banana and bubble gum abound in the taste and with clovey sweetness. mouthfeel is good and nicely carbonated. Taste improves as it warms. Drinkability is pretty stellar on this one. I like it. Defenitely a good wheat session choice."
"Drinkability: A good and decent beer. Nice example of a decent dunkle weis beir. An enjoyable drink with a good character yet not so much to dominate."
"Poured a murky brownwith biscuit large colored head. Very malty aroma, mainly a roasted nutty scent. Medium body and smooth going down. Strong flavor of malt - very complex, with banana, wheat some citrus and spices. A good brew but not an everyday drinker."
"pours a dark hazy brown with a one-finger head that does not hang around too long. It smelled very sweet, with huge tones of banana. It tasted sweet, with banana hanging around the end and with down creamy and soft. It was a little more bland than I was expecting, however this isn't supposed to be overpowering in taste. I prefer their hefe wiess over this, however it was still good. Even better when sitting out back playing horse shoes."
"This brew pours a hazy rust color with a thick almond head that dissapates quickly leaving behind no lacing.It smells of sweetness,caramels and dark fruit mostly.Banana bread and rasins are the first to hit the tounge followed by clove and maple syrup.The mouthfeel is a little thin but it makes up for it with good carbonation and a very soft silky finish.This is a really enjoyable Hefe-Weisse Dunkle,I would like to find it on tap at some point and have a pint or two."
"Into a tall pilsner pours a dark amber beer with a 2 inch heads that's gonna stick around for awhile. Pours right to the top of the glass with a nice dome, looks great! Smells sweet and yeasty(the good kind), that banana/clove/orange smell that comes with the German Hefes. It tastes of oranges, bananas, dark malt, and spice. A fruity, simple beer, but one that still has a complexity to it. A creamy mouthfeel, and definitely the right kind of carbonation for the style. Very drinkable, and very agreeable, A great beer for sittin out on the deck. I was part of a tasting group that had this beer as the group's perennial favorite. I don't think because it was so fantastic, but it got consistently high ratings from just about everyone. A great, classic brew that I thoroughly enjoy every time."
"overall this is really good and i know ill get it again"
"This isn't the best hefedunkles weizen, but still I wouldn't turn this away. Goes very well with wiesswurst mit kartoffelsalat."
"I remember that it leaves the mouth dry and the head virtually disappears to nothing but the tiniest of collars."
"D- I wanted to try this Hefe Weisse and did. I wouldnt make a session out of this. I think the banana flavor was a bit too much for me."
"Purchased at my local BevMo. Buck 1.99 is quite a deal for a quality heffy. Drinken, or dranken? during a Rock Band Session. I think I'm actually singing better. Anyways to this awesome brew. Poured into a common red wine glass. Appears like swampy water, and slightly bubbles with a lil' foamy head. Smells like gingerbread, frozen banana, muffins, oat bread, pop tarts and a hint of grapefruit? Taste, much the same as the smell but with a hint of lemon drops and pancake syrup. Bubbly on the tip of your tongue, foams as you roll it across your mouth, tart as it filters under your tongue, overall easy drinkability! Aftertaste is clean as some new Chrome 26""'s. Lingering aftertaste is plesant. Thank you Mr. German Monk. Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Good Beer...Amen."
"Overall, I'm really ignorant to the style and my palate still doesn't appreciate it, so I really didn't enjoy it, though I suspect it's a good beer for the style."
"D - Surprised on how much cloves flavoring there was a bit much, but nice surprise."
"Drinkability is good with this beer. Not a bad dunkelweizen at all."
"D - Meh. Not that much different then the non-dunkel, not worth the extra cost."
"Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel pours a murky dark orange with a thick white head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is bready and a bit sour. Clove dominates the front and the back, but there is some mushy banana flavor in the middle. A pretty good beer."
"I definitely plan to try this again alongside a reuben or some Jagersnitzel the next time I am at Mr. Dunderbaks in Tampa. (great place btw, German cuisine and beer, I'm pretty sure they have this on tap or at least in stock.)"
"I don't know if I've had a dunkelweizen before this, and I'm not sure how often I'm going to want one in the future. While I'm a fan of new blends and divergent styles, these two just didn't mesh real well on my palette."
"Very drinkable. I haven't been too impressed with some wheat beers I've had, but the taste of this is enjoyable."
"Recommended..."
"I've had this brew many times over the years.. alot recently because I've been trying to find time to review it and ultimately waiting until ""get"" to share it with a friend/coworker. Almost certainly not the best dunkelweizen out there, but still very nice for the style.. I wish more American brewers gave them a go."
"drinkability is decent. this is not an overpowering brew, but it does lack a bit in profile character. the caramel malt tries to hold the profile together, but in the end it remains a bit flabby."
" Medium bodied with little carbonation this beer is very smooth and enjoyable."
"Not bad but not a beer I could drink more than 2 at a time."
"Pourned into a goblet, but really should have gone for a flute or pils glass. Visible yeast at the bottom of the bottle, and it pours a slightly cloudy tea color, with mild head and no lacing. Aroma is of wheat, bananas, and malt. Lively carbonation, fairly light mouth feel, starting with a sweet malt taste and ending a bit dry. Highly refreshing and very drinkable. Could be a decent session beer."
"D: This is great winter sesion. Iwill be drinking more of this in the future."
"This bier is just great; I would have to say it is my favorite. It looks great; I love the smell as I lift my Weizen glass to my mouth. Ive offered it to friends and they also love it. The price is usually less than other German Weizen biers, which make it even better."
"M/D: Medium to light bodied, maybe a little watery, carbonation is just right on the tongue. Drinkability is good on this one, really refreshing."
"d: Easy to find and damn tasty, a great combination."
"Bring on the Brats..."
"Wow this was a good one, I have had this beer long agom but am currently trying it as we speak, the taste is much better since I have quit smoking, I believe this would go good with a wood smoked pork or chicken possibly a nice pecan, hell I think this would go alright with venison. Maybe a good hearty pasta dish, perhaps a goulash (sp?)."
"Poured into my new weihenstephan weiss glass. Nice golden brown color, super frothy head. nice aromas of yeast, bananas,citrus, wheat(duh). Tastes wonderful, nice yeast taste, finishes with fruits. Tart mouthfeel, high drinkable. The midmorning German treat to start my day that I was looking for!"
"poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a pint glass, pours a dark cloudy brown copper color withs a big tan head that dissapates rather quickly. smells mostly of sweet bananas and spices. taste is of bananas, malt and kind of has a nutty aftertaste. mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. this is an interesting beer and worth a try."
"This is one of my go to beers at bars. Very nice malt character that I enjoy tremendously."
"I have to admit this is the first beer of this style that I've tried. I liked it and I will be trying more."
"Overall: very nice dunkel weizen. Complex, rich, friendly and round. A must have."
"Overall, not great, but not bad. There are certainly better dunkels out there, but this one is better than average. It's definitely worth a try, but don't go driving all over town to find some."
"this was #2 in my session ; pours a deep cloudy brown( had to update,this is a beautiful beer, just noticed halfway thru me weizen glass that it's 3 different colors under flourescent desk lamp,gold edges blending to an amber color, then the deeper brown !!! ) w/ a huge head that lasts, plenty of lacing : a wheaty,fruity aroma w/ an ""applish"" undertone, a faint spicy hop aroma as well ; a slighly tart bread-like flavor w/ a sweet caramely finish, a little on the thin side, though ; light bodied w/ lots of carbonation, dry finish ; a very drinkable brew, i can see why it's # 1 on the style example list..."
"Highly recommended, and overall delight."
"This dunkel hefeweizen beer poured a murky brown color (light coffee color) with tall, creamy, light tan foam that persisted long and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was a pleasant lightly fruity (banana) malt aroma with notes of wheat and bread. The taste was malty, lightly sweet, with a gentle flavor of banana and hints of caramel and yeast. There was a mild hop flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth but with a mild tangy touch. There was a lingering caramel malt type aftertaste. This was an enjoyable and drinkable weiss beer."
"A very drinkable beer, I would recommend."
"Very easy drinking."
"Drinkability: a good beer in the style dunkel weiss"
"D- Nice beer very smooth and very drinkable. Would defiantly buy again. Nice for a hefe-weisse that it is dark."
"D - I like carbonation, but the carb on this one turns me off."
"D - very drinkable and highly recommended! would work fine with some bar food or just by itself, or better yet with wurst and sauerkraut. I'll have no trouble finishing my 16.9 oz. sans any food. Hats off to Franziskaner for a very quaffable Hefe-Weisse Dunkel!"
"This is the first dunkel weizen I have had and I must say that I am now a fan."
"Ok, so I had to get my German fix on last night as always. Looking through the fridge trying to decide on where to go with this, I saw this foiled top beauty sitting on the back shelf. Probably been there a couple weeks, so I figured it was about time I gave it a try. Poured a nice, very clear russet brown color with a huge billowing tan head gracing the top of it. A good amount of sediment came off the bottom of the bottle and rested atop this as it took what seemed like forever to get back down. Copious amounts of lace then followed and almost totally obscured the contents of the glass as you went down. Smell was kind of light, nice smoked and roasted malts with a touch of caramel and some slight nuttiness to it. This carried over well into the flavor as it displayed a noticeable earthy grain type back with a touch of a smoked bitterness in the finish and a nice caramel sugar accent in the middle. Very consistent feel throughout as it was very medium bodied, and had just the slightest amount of carbonation once it got to the bottom. Very easy drinker though as nothing really held you back from it at all. Overall I really thought this was pretty decent. I have had much better but I really could not say it was bad in anyway, just not the greatest brew I have had of the style. Still, a quality choice and something that should not be overlooked when sitting on a shelf. If it is there go for it, you could do a lot worse."
"Poured into a wheat glass pours a brown amber color with a fluffy carmel colored head that hangs a bit but does not stay around to long. Smell is very citrus with hint of malty goodness in there as well. Taste was a bit blandn heavy carbonation and a bit of citrus flair with a small bitterness brought on by the hops, over all this was pretty good and went down very smooth and quickly but the heavy carbonation was a bit of a turn off for me. I would have this again though."
"Additional Note: After it warmed a bit, the flavors started to come out. Pretty much tastes as it smells, Banana and spice, very tasty. Get this one, you won't be disappointed."
"Cloudy orange to brown in color with a gigantic foamy head. The head looks like a scoop of ice cream in a root beer float! Phenolic smell with spice and a touch of apple. More phenolic flavor in the taste. Coated plastic on the palate, some nutmeg, a little sizzle of wheat malt, with the aftertaste leaving spiced apples and cinnamon. The beer has a firm and creamy feel, not crisp like other wheat beers. Not quite the same as their hefe, but definately worth a few samples. At $1.59 a half-liter, I'm not bitching and moaning."
"Overall a good offering for the style that is highly drinkable."
"Bready flavors take over, a little apple from the yeast esters. Creamy mouthfeel due to the yeast addition. Very smooth and drinkable. Not my favorite Dunkelweizen by far, but a worthy offering."
"Pours a hazy brown copper with a creamy tan off-white head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is slightly sweet with a malty wheaty caramel flavor. Tastes of bananas, cloves, and the typical sweet hef flavor. Mouthfeel is thick, yet easy drinking, but not as good as their regular hef. Overall, an average beer; I would prefer the regular hef."
" ~ I certainly enjoy this German Dunkel. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and will surely have one again soon."
"Pours a brownish, amber color with a minimal one-finger head. Aroma is one of banana and clove. Taste is much of the same except that the clove is more prominent in this brew. Much like the regular Franziskaner beer except that it's darker. Smooth and tasty though. Very drinkable."
"D: Not all that drinkable unless you can deal with lots of carbonation. Burping is a must after every gulp. It's too sweet for me to drink a lot of."
"Mouthfeel is medium (maybe slightly thin) and the beer is reasonably carbonated. This is certainly a drinkable brew, that can get quite heavy. Overall this is certainly a pleasant tasting beer, but it doesn't quite have the bursting of flavor that its lighter brother has."
"Poured a dark color with a thick head that laced the glass well. The overall smell was kind of fruity with hint of nut. The taste of this beer was kind of standard, kind of bland in my opinion. I wasn't overly impressed with this beer. It was good, just nothing I would preferably drink. I personally was expecting more from this beer than what I got."
"D- Fairly drinkable. Leaves a sticky sweet coating in my mouth that I don't like so much but other than that I could drink a few on a hot summer day."
"Very drinkable. While no substitute for a fresh example in Deutschland, this is the best I can do for the style around here, and whenever I have it, it seems to not be too worse for wear after it's voyage across the Atlantic (and most of North America). Now, if only I could regularly get beers of this style from local brewers..."
"D: Goes down easy, but the clove, yeast, & banana are too much for me to want to drink a bunch of these (which is pretty much how I feel about a lot of weissbiers)."
"Drinkability - Great summertime brew, was perfect on a hot day after a bowl of ice cream..."
"I could drink one at a time and then I'd move to something else. But I would come back to it."
"Not bad, but kind of uninspiring."
"Overall, this beer is a pleasure to consume, and is just as good, if not better than regular Franziskaner Hefe-Weizen."
"D - I could drink a couple of these. A nice beer for when you want something summery but a little darker."
"Big Bottle. Brownish-orange pour with fantastic creamy head. Aroma and flavor of roasted malt, clove and banana. Had only had one dunkelweizen before this one and expectations were low, but this is one fine tasting beer. I would definitely recommend this one."
"D - good drinkability, nice summer beer for bock/dark beer lovers."
"d: this dunkel started off very promising but didn't quite finish what it started -- finished off too light. not a bad beer though."
"D: Decent drinkability. It is refreshing and an interesting twist of the hefe-weizen but I didn't really care for it."
"Aroma is nice and strong and malty, some hints of yeast. Pours an interesting orangy-brown amber with a fairly thick and persistent head. Flavor is well-rounded, malty and wheaty with a strong undertone of lemon. Very smooth and refreshing, one of the best hefe-weisses I have ever tried."
"Had on tap at the BSP, Decatur, Georgia. Pours a chestnut brown with a slightly beige head that settles into a cap after a nice initial head. The smell is a little light, but there is mostly banana and clove as well as some light wheat. The flavor is a little more pronounced. Raisins, clove, banana. Somewhat mellow. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel combined with the flavor profile makes this one delicious. Not sweet, and there is still a snap to the mouthfeel. A nice summer brew especially."
"An above average offering. This one is great to go with a plate of smoked kielbasa. A nice solid beer. This one is worth checking out, but there are others that bring a stronger flavor presence."
"carbonation on this brew is uniform and strong, and maintains as it sits out. It provides a nice mouth feel, and allows for the palette to reach the subtleties of the beer. I Like this one, drinkability is high."
"In my quest to try more German beer, I decided to try this one. Poured from a bottle, into a weizen glass. The beer pours a hazy brown, forming a creamy 1 inch head, and leaving light spots of lacing. The smell is a great mix of fruit aromas and light sweet malt. The taste is just as good as the smell. Thick malt followed by a light fruity sweetness. Very smooth medium mouthfeel. Full flavor and good abv. makes this a delicious session ale. I have to say that this beer far surpassed my expectations. I havent been impressed by the majority of German beers that I've had up to this point, but this brew is not only a great German beer, but its also introduced me to a new style that I was not familiar with. Highly recommended!!!"
"D: Uh, yes. A very good, but not great, hefe. Easy drinking, but it doesn't have enough excitement for me. Weihenstephaner dunkel-weisse is my choice. More complex, and well, better."
"This Bier fills the glass with a soft brown color with hints of a deep cherry hue.Cloudy but not milky with yeast. A very nice head builds quickly and leaves lace throughout the session. The first aroma impression is spicy and of cloves. This is very well balanced by fruity aromas and the dark malts in combination with the yeast provide subtle raisin and dried fruit aromas. Caramel malt and a slight malt sweetness are detectable. Somewhere in there, although in the background, were small whiffs of buttery diacetyl. The flavor begins with a mild upfront bitterness followed by a light malt sweetness. Yeast flavor was crisp and fresh but not overly bread-like. The dark malts are subdued. The mouth is between medium and light. This Bier is very well carbonated to style. This is definitely a great drinking Bier and understandably popular in the Biergartens of München. Definitely a mild Dunkles Weißbier, by Dunkles Weißbier standards, but a very solid offering. I would highly recommend this Bier as an introduction for someone who isnt familiar with the style. Noch eins bitte! Zum Wohl!"
"Drinkability is great and mouthfeel is good. Reminds me of being in Germany. Quite enjoyable."
"Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel was red-brown in color and very murky. It had a huge off-white head with very good retention. The aroma was malt, banana, clove, and a little yeast. The taste was wheat, malt, and a fruity yeast twang with dry finish. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkabity was good. It's a decent dunkel weizen."
"Refreshing and lightly sweet. A nice Dunkel."
"Overall an exceptionally easy to drink hefe. Just as clean and refreshing as the standard hefe (perhaps it shouldn't be this way however)."
"From a bottle with no experation date at Central Market in Dallas. Pours out dark brown, the color of apple cider. Good light brown head. The smell is very wheaty and has a hint of banana to it. I think it tastes very good. The wheat flavor is very strong and the banana flavor is present as well. Ends a little sour and dry. I could drink lots of these on hot Texas days."
"Drinkability is high for me-I can see drinking this while sitting in my beach chair reading a good book"
"very drinkable if you like the taste, but if you don't like the taste it's not too drinkable is it?"
"D - This is a supremely well balanced Dunkel-weizen, one of my favorites. Very drinkable!"
"D: I could go for about 2 tops on this one. Very nice."
"Not a bad overall effort at a dunkel weizen, and glad I tried this. I could easily finish another, but it is just an average beer to me. And why have another when their regular weisse is significantly better and equally available to me?"
"I typically like German dark wheat beers, but this is just a so-so example of the style. It pours a cloudy, dull brownish color, with a decent head that does stick around for awhile. The smell is yeasty, a little musty, maybe earthy if that is what you want to call it, but I wouldn't call it enticing. The taste is roughly medium bodied, there is just a tad of sweetness, I can taste a little clove maybe a little maple in there, along with the yeasty wheat flavor of a hefe. There is very little in the way of hop flavor, maybe a tinge in the middle, nothing on the end. This may be a little on the too watery side for a dark wheat beer, probably less sweet than other typical wheat beers. It's an okay beer, but that is all I can say. Recommended but you can do better. L'Chaim."
"An enjoyable Dunkel Weizen, though I've had better. I prefer the taste and complexities of Franziskaner's regular Hefe-Weisse; this seems somewhat monolithic. Definitely worth a try, especially if you're curious. But I probably won't buy this unless I have curious friends with me."
"Not a bad dunkel weizen. However, I feel I have had better. The malts run the show in this one. It's definitely worth a try."
"Just as the blonde one, be careful when pouring this, or you'll have just a lot of foam. Creamy a bit brownish head, with lot of chunks that go straight to the bottom of the glass, with very long retention, but it doesn't leave lace. Cloudy dark orange colour. Aroma is similar to the blonde, banana, clove, peaches, but with a hint of chocolate, specially if you pour the sediment, and hints of dark fruits. A bit of sweet fruity flavor, taste is similar to the aroma, banana, cloves, peaches, chocolate, dark fruits... and some coriander. Not very strong body, very refreshing and drinkable."
"Thick like orange juice. Nice bite. Quite dry. A really full beverage. It's a wonderful, hefty drink. A thick sippin' beer. Excellent excellent."
"Just a good, flavorful Dunkel Weizen. I generally prefer Hefes to Dunkels, but this is a good change of pace for me. I could see myself drinking this again in the future. Recommended."
"D: Good easy drinking dunkel weizen. Falls between lighter and heavier styles. Makes for a nice filling but ultimately easily drinkable and refreshing beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a murky amber-brown color with a huge, dense, cream colored head. The smell is primarily of cloves, a slight banana profile and a hint of bready yeast. The taste is very similar to the nose, with the toasted malt coming out ever so slightly. A decent amount (but not overly noticeable) of hops balances out the sweet weizen flavor nicely. The mouthfeel was slightly lighter than I had expected, the carbonation is thick and viscous. This is a very drinkable DW, the light body makes this good tasting beer even more drinkable."
"D- Nothing to good. I am not sure if its the style or the single beer."
"Drinkability: This beer was great to wet the appetite for the main course. If I had the choice I'd go for the regular hef, I didn't get anything extra from this brew."
"Dunkel is one of my favorite styles in all the land. This one leaves me feeling like I need to search elsewhere. Now that doesn't mean it's not worth trying. It does, however, mean that it's not the best of the style I've had during my travels. Appearance is such a bogus category of the overall review, since it speaks to essentially nothing. I suppose one could argue certain styles should have certain physical characteristics, but appearance in and of itself is meaningless to the taste which is all that matters. That being said, copper brown is what is obviously observed with this beer. There is a slight head, but no lace to speak of and the head itself simply floats on the surface in a thin line. The aroma is very discreet...not much to talk about here for a dunkel, which should blast out malty something or other. Tough to figure this one out. There is an aroma but it is tinny which is a very deragotary description, but it is what it is. The taste is slightly malty...a very clean flavor but so limited in the mouthfeel. I expect a dunkel to be bursting with maltiness and hearty on the toungue, but that ain't happening with this one, much to my chagrin. I'll give this an average drinkability rating at best, but boy, what an average to sub-average beer altogether. I hate to write that about any beer, but it is what it is. A wholly unremarkable dunkel. I expected so much more."
"Drinkability: A tasty , refreshing , and fairly dry Dunkel Weizen. Nice showing of dark wheat flavors , nice balance , well made. A good choice in its style , espescially if your in the mood for a dry finish."
"Pours Dark Murky brown with biscuit large colored head. Very malty aroma, mainly a roasted nutty scent. Medium body and smooth going down. Strong flavor of malt - very complex, with banana and spices. Overall, a good beer, though not Franziskaner's best."
"Poured with an amber color and an attractive head that rose up much higher than I expected. Strongly malty smell, with some herbals and bourbon. Yummy. I thought it tasted delicious -- the piney herbaciousness nicely complemented the malts. That said, it left the mouth with a bit of a metallic feel, and it was quite fizzy. Despite the high carbonation, I'd gladly drink a few pints of this dunkel -- I felt that it was very nicely balanced."
"Very easy drinking."
"A well done dunkel, subtle but good and extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability - A good dunkel-weisse, although some of the the flavors seem to be a little subdued. Quite refreshing, however."
"Cheers!"
"D - Goes down easy without being bland and boring. Great balance of hops and malt."
"'world go by..."
"Easy to drink. Refreshing. Sweeter than not, but not overly so. A basic, decent example of a dunkel weizen."
"Pours a cloudy, dark red-brown with a creamy, thick and everlasting taupe head. Big aromas of bananas first off; those morph into cloves and phenols as the beer warms. Promising. On the palate, quite complex and evolving; I can pick out each flavor element in succession as it rises to the forefront and then falls away to be replaced: sourness, carbonated acidity, bananas, barley malt, and a phenolic finish. Wow. Very well done. This beer walks the line between giving each flavor its turn and being disjointed. It's mouth-filling, eye-catching, tasty and aromatic. It's not poetry in a bottle, but it's hard to find fault with any one characteristic. Well done."
"This looks like a great beer, it's a dark brownish/reddish color and very murky. It has a nice head on top and smells really sweet, it does have a banana scent to it. It has a some what crisp feel to it and is absolutely smooth and very tasty,it has a very mild bitter but crisp aftertaste. I really enjoy drinking this one."
"Poured a hazy dirty brown color with a huge tan head that dissipated unevenly, not much lacing but retains a nice cap. The smell is of cloves, spice, banana, light bubblegum. The taste is not as strong as the smell. Clove, banana but has a sweet malty backbone that I didn't pick up in the smell. Has a twang to it. Moderate mouthfeel, a bit fizzy yet smooth. A very enjoyable dunkel hefe and very drinkable"
"Poured a cloudy brown. Foamy as a Hefeweisse should be. Faint clove and wheat smell. This beer really opened up as it warmed, this is another case of buying a beer too damn cold. As it warmed more taste of banana came forward. Nice bit of grass in the finish. Good beer here but there are better examples of the style to be found."
"I drank about a pint and tossed the rest."
"This one is a big-time thirst quencher and incredibly drinkable (as the case with most well crafted Hefe-weizens). I just finished up my holiday shopping and this was a pleasurable beverage to kick back after the madness."
"D - It is a very good tasting beer. The malt and wheat combo is quite nice."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable dunkel. Not quite as sweet as one would expect, but a nice smooth creamy mouthfeel combined with the soft buckwheat tastes make for a good combo."
"D- very drinkable dunkel, could happily drink it in a session, but i would actually choose the erdinger dunkel for aethestic appearances ( super dunkel!) and for its more chocolately finish."
"Verdict: one of the best examples of the style that is widely available. Very good, but not quite my favorite of them."
"Mouthfeel was heavier and creamier than the others with a less harsh carbonation. This led to a much higher drinkability. It was a close call between this and the Julius, but I would say this is the more outstanding Dunkel of the lot, for the mouthfeel and drinkability as well as the boldness of the taste."
"Mmmmm... German beer..."
"This is a drinkable beer, but the flavors are a bit unusual. I don't know that I would want to drink a whole bunch of this in one sitting, but a pint or two at a time is OK."
"Body pours nice, medium brown, hazy as hell, with an eggshell-white extremely fine head. Aroma is quite sweet-fruity, very much towards tangerine and strawberry-type flavors with a hint of clove spiciness. Carbonation is extremely prominent, so much that the initial flavor is overwhelmed by the CO2 buzz. At the end of each sip is a slightly deeper fruit flavor, with just a slight touch of a slightly toasted, bready aspect. As the carbonation gets mellower, a pronounced estery sweetness is increasingly evident. Although each sip is delicious, the dirty, slightly sour aftertaste is somewhat taxing."
"Big ol' half-liter German bottle, served in a weizen glass. It pours like dark, murky iced-tea with almost 3 inches of meringue-like head that I managed to tease above the rim of the glass. The head has nice retention and slowly recedes to a quarter inch, leaving decent lace behind. The aroma is spicy, with banana, molasses, light clove, and some yeast, with green/perfumy hops hiding in the back. The flavor is quite similar with mild wheat and clean malts, light at first, but becoming more fully-flavored as it warms. Additional notes of chocolate, caramel, faint smoke and an increasing clove presence round out the flavor profile. The body is light and tingly, smooth, with a medium finish, which is just right for a wheat beer. Overall this is a nice dunkelweizen that is light yet full of flavor."
"Like most good hefe-weisse beers, it's got a crisp, clean flavor. Because it is a dunkel, the dark malts add a roasted toffee flavor to the traditional wheaty, spicy, slightly citrusy flavors. It straddles the line between a pure hefe and a pure dunkel. The interplay of flavors is very satisfying. Fairly light in your mouth, the flavor does not linger. This is good or bad, depending on what you are looking for from this beer. I like the lightness and clean finish, because you still get that burst of lots of malty flavor. Someone who expects a thicker, darker beer might want that mouth coating flavor. I think this beer is excellent the way it is. People who are turned off by the light lemony flavor of traditional hefe-weisse beers will love the depth of flavor added here with the malts. This is great beer."
"D: A pretty decent example of a Dunkel Weisse. Nicely complex, and something I will probably get again."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable German brew. During my recent trip to Germany, I was surprised to see that most Bavarians prefer the classic hefe weizen style. While I like that style a lot, this is a really good wheat beer to change things up."
"Pours a cloudy dark orange with a long lasting sudzy head. Smells floral an d delicious. The taste is an interesting mix between hops yeast and alcohol. This seems strange to me because I haven't noticed the flavor of alcohol in beer in quite some time. I could be just me.Flavors or roated bananas are apparent! This is a pretty damned good beer, but then again I haven't had a bad dunkleweizen yet, this style is really a gem. Somewhat light of a mouthfeel which isn't a bad thing as it can really improve the drinkability.Good beer, not quite as good as ayinger's version of Dunkles-hefeweizen, but still worth a try as you may like it better."
"VEyr nice to have, it was my first dunkel Weizen. VEry cloudy and dark, with nice foam. But it was a little incipit considering the other hefe. Not bad, but somehitng wa smissing, VEry creamy. SOme wheat spots but in general is more like something else, maybe the process of roasting the grains has something to do."
"Overall one of the better Dunkels I have had. I recommend it!"
"D: Oh-so-drinkable. I was just looking at some other reviews and noticed some negative comments that I just feel didn't apply to mine, BUT, my local haunt just yesterday had this come in, so I know mine's very fresh, and perhaps that's why others have spoken ill of this beer. I for one thoroughly enjoyed it, despite never having had it before, and think it's pretty damn drinkable. The body's not too heavy, but it's certain fuller than your average lagers, so I can't say this is the kind of beer you'd want to throw back a six-pack of, but it's too good to turn down without a good excuse."
"D- Not a bad beer. Not totally a fan of the really wheaty stuff but this has just enough color to keep me satisfied."
"Taste is lacking in malt complexity. It finishes dry and wheaty, with no hop character."
"Pours a dark brown with a huge offwhite head that remains the whole way down the glass. Nose is tangy wheat with a bit of a roasted flavor and a touch of herbal hops. Taste is sweet malt, wheat tanginess and hints of chocolate, not a lot of hop impact. Mouthfeel is medium and well carbonated. Pretty drinkable stuff. Good overall and interesting as this is my first dunkel."
"Crystal/cara malty flavours, with the ubiquitous banana/clove. More bitter than the Hell, although the beer menu states they both have 12 IBUs. Maybe just a little less tart."
"The taste is really big. Big on cloves, wheat, not so big on bananas and just a bit of sourness to it which adds to the drinkablity of this brew for me. Good stuff."
"Drinkability - pretty good, rather sessionable."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a hazy light-brown appearance with thick off-white head, that lingered through most of the glass. Good lacing. Aroma of malt, and a sweetness of candy. Flavor was mostly wheat, with clove and corriander spices becoming more evident at mi-glass. Palate was dry, and the only drawback to this beer was that it was also a little watery. All and all, a good beer."
"Nice thick and chewy body but it didn't compensate for the strange flavors. Not the best in my opinion."
"CRUX: TOP NOTCH DUNKEL HERE! As good as the hefe; maybe better. I can't believe I've passed these over for so long in favor of their hefe, which I love...I'm goin' to the beer store to stock up on these! Prost!"
"I was not really surprised by the taste here. there was a terrific smokey twang mixed with vanilla /clove which imho adds some depth to the hefe weizen category- it gives body and helps the carbonation fill out. There is a nice finish that is surprisingly not any less refreshing than the its non-dunkel brother. This is an outstanding product from Fransiskaner/Spaten. It may be to pedestrian for some of the more unflinching snobs, but I can't imagine an instance of needing more that a tall glass of this stuff with a bunch more- Euro-pints chilling in the ice box."
"D - Not bad, and certainly very drinkable, but the taste is a let down."
"An easy to drink pleasant offering."
"An excellent dunkel weizen. Very smooth and harmonious flavors."
"Drinkability is quite awesome, this beer really works well, and excellent example of a dunkel hefe. Really enjoyable, I could drink his all day. Prost und Zum Wohl! MK"
"Opted to buy a bottle after an excellent serving of the hefe off tap. Pours with a rather large head, an odd brown in colour - strongly resembled tea actually. Two fingers at least (off a soft pour) and stayed constant through the course. A warming flavour, profiles cinnamin, brown sugar with a light spritzy, rotting wheat aroma. A lot of yeast in the aroma as well. Not bad. A good mouthfeel, easy on the wheat punch - fairly light and certainly more dry than most others. I like how this one is a little dulled. Flavour is also a little restrained. Nothing too rich. As it warmed I could taste more and more (until almost exclusively) raisons and prunes. The darker fruity notes (prunes, raisons) of this one make it a great compliment to the lighter (banana, etc) fruity notes of the hefe they offer. Very little, where any, aftertaste. Yeast became a little too strong near the end. I found that both this and the hefe lack tremendous complexion but are quite fair - and overall - quite nice."
"So it has its faults, in spite of being a style classic. And yet, the small presence it gives off goes a long way toward making it a beer that goes down easily and smoothly. The thing is, though, I'm not sure this is something I'd seek out. I'd drink it gladly if it was offered, but as seldom as that's likely to happen, my exposure to this one is likely over. But one never knows, does one?"
"The watery mouthfeel really leaves something to be desired. And I will have to move on to the next brew instead of drinking these in quantitiy."
"Pours a cloudy brown with orange hues with a nice white head that leaves wonderful lacing. Smell is of wheat, yeast and a hint of banana. Taste is crisp and dry malt, clove and a little banana. Overall this is a good brew from a brewer thats products are rather easy to find which is great. Pick this up and at least try it if you come across it."
"Taste; the caramel malts are there but not quite as dominant as they are in the aroma. The yeast and wheat flavors come out as well as the typical cloves you would expect, but it's a little lacking as far as any banana flavors go. Don't get me wrong, the bananas are there, they're just weak enough that you have to search for them a bit. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied, and would be easy to put down a few of these."
"D: Very nice beer overall. Taste is clean and interesting. Will enjoy this one again."
"It's wierd how all the beers from this company have a sweetness too them no matter how light or dark they are. It's somewhat dark with a sort of bitterness, but it comes out sweet. Don't be afraid to add a lemon it doesn't hurt the beer, but it is good with out it."
"Overall: Definately a nice dunkel, I would drink this on a regular basis."
"A very strong and intense clove aroma is evident, followed by a very fruity banana smell. This mixture gives it a pleasent overall first impression. The color can be described as a deep copper brown with a very thick , bubbly off white long lasting head. The clarity is slightly hazy and cloudy. Flavor of banana and clove is strong but good. High carbonation with no bitter aftertaste. Goes down very smoothly, a very filling rich beer. This will be a beer I will drink more often, and have my friends try."
"Pours a dark cloudy brown with a huge light tan head. Smells like citrus and hops, with a hint of dough. Taste is not overwhelming, a hint of citrus, not as much as the smell would suggest with a bit of hops, no sweet flavor, a small aftertaste of malt though. Again you would think heavy carbonation from the appearance but it has a nice balance which adds to the mouthfeel. This is an interesting beer, my only complaint is it has a watered down feel the more sips you take. Could have had more flavor, but worth a try. This isn't your typical beer but worth a try if you find it. This is very easy to drink, not much aftertaste, could go well with just about anything."
"Overall- A nice, chock full of flavor, Hefe. A pretty good beer to drink on a warm afternoon."
"Pours a very cloudy dull light brown with enormous off-white head. The head takes quite a while to recede to a thick blanket of film. Smells a bit bland; metallic hops and hard water over slightly sweet malts. Flavor is thin and dull; carbonated water, tinny hops, and a touch of malt that flashes by leaving no finish. Weak and uninspiring body, enlivened slightly by a trace of wheat creaminess. Not a particularly good dunkel weizen."
"Sweet wheaty malts with subtle hints of clove and banana in both the aroma and quaff. A tad disappointed in the weakness of the spices  I thought they would be more pronounced. The weakness carried over to the mouth, weak, and thin, with low carbonation. However, this did not distract from the overall drink ability  this one is smooth and enjoyable. It works for a cross-over and a steady session brew!"
"The estery and toasty flavors you like in a Dunkel Weiss and the balance and cleanliness you expect from Franziskaner. A terrific blend of wheat malts, yeasty esters, and bready / roasted barley equally evident in the nose and flavor. A dense tan foamstand lurks over a muddy / hazy brown. Though less exciting to the sight as it is to the palate, the beer is quite ideal per style. It has a very creamy, yet mellow bread-toast-yeast flavor, decorated with cloves, bananas, and citrus. The beer remains full until the finish, where it thins nicely for easy drinking. A good summer beer when you need a break from the yellow stuff."
"An excellent value at $1.75 for a pint bottle at Byron's Liquor store in OKC."
"I compared it to the light one when drinking, and for me the light is way better."
"overall, absolutely delicious and beautiful, the finest dunkle-weizen i've tasted to date. highly recommended!"
"Medium bodied, alcohol hardly detectable, the mouthfeel is rather uneventful. Easy enough to drink, worth a try for this style."
"Appeared a semi-translucent orange-brown color with a hefty pale head that dissipated quickly and left behind small amount of lacing. Medium level of carbonation with thick bubbles gracing the surface. Aromas of bananas, toasted bread, and oranges; fruit aromas seemed to mix with toasted malt aromas. The taste was spritzy and refreshing with the perfect level of carbonation. Fruit flavors (bananas & oranges) seemed to provide a nice balance to the malt and subtle hops giving the beer an overall sweet feel, but not overdone at all. A bit thin in the mouth, but still flavorful and refreshing. I could have had another one, if it weren't for the fact that I wanted to try another beer on the draft list."
"Opinion: I am not a huge fan of Weizen beers, but I still keep trying them. I am partial to the Dunkels more so than the light lemony traditional Weizen beers as I like the added depth of malt. I am just a malt head. This is one of the better representations of this style that I have tried, so I am sure that I will be drinking it again in the future."
"This is a good beer for the summer, of which I can drink a couple."
"drinkability: high. i easy drinking beer no doubt but this is a disapointment. next time i will pay the extra 40 cents per bottle more for an aiyner."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Light, but very alive in the mouth... the effervescence supports the beer like a zephyr, fleeting but active. Super-drinkable beer, a terrific example of a summertime brew to go along with some sausages off the grill."
"D - This is a very good dunkel weizen. It is easy to drink and I plan on having more in the future."
"D: Very good."
"Cheers!"
"Poured out a cloudy, murky cola color with an enormous, rocky, almond colored head. Head maintains its fluffiness. Banana is up front with bubblegum in there as well. Clove kind of takes the backseat. Some caramel notes are present. The spicy yeast is very apparent in the flavor, but the malt just isn't as complex as some other dunkelweizens I've had. A little bit of alcohol in the finish, which I wasn't too fond of. Mouthfeel is light yet lively and creamy, in a way. Very drinkable, but just lacking a little something."
"O--Give it a shot if youre a hefe fan and want something kinda sweet."
"Another great one from Spaten. Poured a dark cloudy red / brown colour. Looked like cloudy tea. VERY fluffy slightly off-white head with super sticky lacing. Lots of clove spiciness and a healthy dose of banana in this one!!! A tiny bit of the dank basement lambic farmhouse ale smell. The taste was full of clove spice and very ""wet"". I know that must sound funny, but it seems thirst quenching and doesn't leave a dry after taste at all. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and easy to drink. I enjoied this hefeweizen tremendously, although my favourite is still Ayinger (yes I know this is Dunkel-Weisse). Not a bad one at all!!!"
"4th pull now, and we're definately into a chocolate muffin taste. I am a lemoner however and citrus addition brings that quality out nicely in this dunkel."
"Overall, i like it, but would pick the normal hefe over this anyday."
"Nice muddy brown, lots of lace.neutral aroma, creamy sourish moutheel, not too tasty or interesting . Fresh at Brick pub store in Atlanta with Dano213, blitz134, smchnsg. Tingling carbonation, medium-to-light mouthfeel. i like their regular weisse for straightforward session ale."
"Flavor was full of fresh whole wheat bread. Reminded me of a wheat version of that bread they serve at Outback. Hints of banana and canteloupe too. Slight hints of clove and spice but had to look for them. Thick and heavy mouthfeel that almost had a texture that made me think of a cotton t-shirt."
"Drinkability -- this would be an excellent session beer. Not too much carbonation or alcohol. Not too much going on -- just nice and spicey. Very drinkable."
"D - This is a great dunkel weizen. It is easy to drink, very pleasant and easily sessionable. I will not hesistate to enjoy again."
"D-ULtimate session beer and could be enjoyed all night. I love this beer!"
"It's on the heavier scale, though for a German dark it's not imposing. Still, you wouldn't want to have more than 2 unless you were looking to be weighted down and well-buzzed (not a high ABV, but I always get the large bottle). So maybe it's not perfect, but darn close."
"I'd purchase again."
"from the bottle.poured orange brown, with a big fluffy head. aroma yeast, citrus, caramel. flavor, yeasty, caramel, fruity, lighty sweet and lighty bitter.at 1st taste I didnt think I was going to like this beer but as it warmed the flavors got better.not to bad of a beer"
"not quite as exceptional as some of the others ive had recently but it is good, relatively inexpensive and extremely drinkable. if you like this type of beer its definitley worth a try."
"D: Pleasant scent, interesting taste attributes, and a mild mouthfeel all make this dunkel wiesse quite enjoyable time and again."
"I will try to review again and see if the I had a bad bottle the first time."
"One of the best Hefeweizens I've had the pleasure of quaffing. I have always loved the standard style so I wasn't sure what I'd think of the Dunkel version; Turns out, I love it. There's just enough slight variation to make this a different beer in other terms than color. Delicious, easy to drink, satisfying!"
"Notes: Interesting brew for sure. Malt profile could use a bit more power. The wheat/floral/fruity middle is what I really enjoyed. Highly reccomended."
"It pours and very good, frothy head. It looks dark and amber brown and very inviting. Smells like a good hefeweizen with hints of orange mixed with the roasted dark barely malts. Mouthfeel was very good. It's drinkability wasn't quite as good as it's counterpart-the regular hefeweizen. Still very nice."
"~A great dunkel, complex in character yet a little chalky and perhaps too earthy at times, now that I think about it, partifularly in mouthfeel."
" The mouthfeel is nice, not heavy. Can't really taste the alcohol but its there. nice beer overall, reasonably priced, I would definitely buy more."
"Drinkability: This is quite yummy, but I can imagine it might get somewhat cloying after a while. Still, very drinkable."
"Smooth and easy to drink."
"Purchased this beer in bottle form from the local store. Originally had this in Los Angeles, in tap form, so I wanted to try this in bottled form. The appearence resembles apple cider, but with a kick! The aroma, just like the other reviewers had mentioned, had a banana odor to it. This beer poured out some significant head, in the Bavarian style that it is, which settled down pretty quickly. The taste is malty. In terms of its mouthfeel, it feels very jumpy but good. Drinkability is good, especially when enjoying hot dogs or German sausage with it."
"Mmmm, so amazing on tap. This came to me ina tall weizen glass all murkey and brown with a nice creamy head. The smell is awesome w/hints of banana, caramel, and wheat. Clove and banana simply dominate the flavor portion of the beer. Malty and earthy taste. The mouthfeel is very smooth, thick and creamy. Amazingly drinkable."
"This is a pretty good beer, very original but still in a traditional, recognized style. Two thumbs up."
"The beer is very drinkable. I only had one, but I could've certainly ordered more without a second thought!"
"At 2.00 a bottle it's well worth it. Great session beer during the fall season."
"In appearance a little more dark than its sister Heffeweizen; i cinfirm its fruitty taste, smell like a malt liquor; mouthfeel and drinkability are low in the average, i try this beer with salad and cheese, not try with mexican or american food; i always serve on a glass mug; 45% recommended."
"Tasted just as good as it smelled, even better. Grainy, caramel, banana and cloves. Finished dry and grainy, with a hint of fruityness... Awesome."
"Pint bottle bought in Lincoln City Oregon. Nice enough looking beer, murky dark chesnut coloured with a frothy/chunky light tan head. The aroma was not as strong as I expected from a ""real"" German Dunkleweizen, all the regular components were there but very muted. fruity and peppery aromas. I was really quite dissapointed with the taste weak overall..yes all the usual ""bananas and clove"" was there but extremelly weakened. Palate was very thin and almost watery. Overall i felt let down by this one, below average for a German weiss beer"
"A very fine beer this one, supremely drinkable, ultimately enjoyable."
"A dark amber brown beer that pours a huge foamy head with good retention. After the head finally recedes, it looks like fresh apple cider, but with carbonation. Smells and tastes like a hefe weizen. I would have guessed a hefe weizen if blindfolded. The malts may be more complex than with a hefe weizen, but the typical sharp wheat flavor. Clove taste is abundant and also a little bit of floral hop flavor. Mouthfeel is very good if you like your beer on the dry side. This would be a great beer with a German or pork meal."
"Mouthfeel is decent. Seems to be medium bodied and refreshingly not to cloying. This would score a bit higher if it filled out the palate just a tad more but it's nice, nonetheless."
"Notes: very good"
"overall: good dunkel weisen. i prefer similar versions by weihenstephaner and schneider, but very good just the same. as stated before, this would make an excellent sessional as it's a little milder than those listed. great try, though."
"Drinkability: Initially, I found the name (Dunkel) and appearance of this type of beer somewhat intimidating. But this is an easily approachable, drinkable beer. I purchased this for $2.49, at this price I'd pick another up again. I'd recommend it as a good lead in to the style."
"D- There are some real complex flavors in this soft beer. The toasted malt adds another dimension that is really nice. Very nice smooth soft yet complex beer."
"Having been pleasantly surprised by my introduction to Franziskaner Hefe-Weiss, I decided to give the Dunkel a try. The beer poured a copper-brown color, with hints of red. It had a nice half-inch tannish colored head, and was almost opaque. Overall the appearance is somewhat dank and murky. Smells fruity, with banana being most dominant but other sweet aromas definitely present. Hop and wheat come out at the end. The taste is full and malty. Initial bready flavor is followed by a kick of banana. This is a very flavorful sip. In the mouth, however, this beer feels somewhat thin. It is not very bold and the initial good taste does not linger long enough. Overall, I would define this as another drinkable Hefe by Franziskaner for an unbelieveably low price. It is flavorful, but light on the tongue. All in all a good beer and worth a try."
"Pours a cloudy brown/orange color. Thick tan foamy head. Great retention, the head lasted almost the enitre beer. Typical banana and clove aroma. Hint of caramel and almost chocolate, followed by the tart wheat flavor. Banana flavors at the end. Light body, high carbonation. Pretty drinkable. Solid beer here."
"Pours a reddish brown, cloudy, apple-cidery color with a nice tannish head with decent retention. Smells and tastes like a hefe-weisse - floral, dark fruits, with a hint of banana and hops at the end. Reminded my of Ommegang's Hennepin quite frankly. The roasted malts are a little more pronounced in this dunkel than in a traditional hefe. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, making drinkability quite nice. Didn't knock my socks off, I don't know if this style is exactly my cup of...uh, tea - but it was a solid brew no less."
"Mouthfeel is a bit weak, aside from the nice body. This is good beer for shamelessly throwing down the gullet on a hot summer's day, but contemplating the subtle flavors of the mouthfeel is seemingly diffucult with such a highly drinkable beer on such a thirsty night."
"FH-WD is far from bad beer, but neither is it a slam dunkel. My less than enthusiastic review probably has something to do with the fact that my first two beers in this style were the excellent versions from Brauereien Aying and Weihenstephaner. Given the fact that I rarely drink dunkels, and the fact that I have better dunkels available locally, I doubt that I'll be drinking this one again."
"Pours a cloudy brown, with a large tan head. Aroma was full of banana, clove and spice. I expected more twang in the flavour, but what I got was a bit bland. Very crisp and clean. Lots of carbonation. Goes down real smooth. Thirst quenching on a hot summer day."
"Taste is pretty good. Grape notes with some banana and a crisp tartness near the end. A bit watery and light on the mouthfeel, but overall a good beer with many refreshing qualities."
"This is a quality ""anytime"" beer. I can drink it with food, without food, and while participating in a variety of activities. One of my personal favorites."
"Of course, I can have several of these."
"Body is thin and the mouthfeel is very light with large bubbles of carbonation. Very refreshing, but a bit too subdued for a dunkel. Perfect for summertime refreshment in mass quantities. Good price too-$1.75 for 16.9 oz bottle."
"Drinkability: This beer is certainly not a session beer, as it trends to sit in your stomach. However, it is great to sip down one or two, and relax."
"This was even better than I remembered it. Perhaps the lack of sediment actually helped? Regardless, a very drinkable and highly enjoyable beer."
"Paid 2.99 for a bottle"
"This beer poured a slighlty cloudy dark amber color with a large, foamy head that stays with the beer all the way down the glass. Minimal lacing. Smells of cloves and yeast with a hint of citrus. The taste is very refreshing and pleasing to the palate. Somewhat dry but very crisp and clean. This is a great summer beer and I think would go great with Brats and french fries."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all the time, I think, summer or winter. It's a crisp beer, one to be savored or one to have as a session."
"I'd recommend this and would definately get it again."
"An absolutely delicious brew, to be had any time, any where, and for any reason."
"This grew on me by leaps and bounds as I continued to enjoy it more and more after each sip. The softer smooth body is more to my liking compared to most weizen type brews. Quite smooth and nealry chewy with the perfect tang and spice. A solid dunkel."
"The color is amber brown. Head is large, thick, and creamy. The aroma is mostly of light clove smell with a touch of malt. Taste is initially clovey, bready malts kick in towards the middle and are most prominent in the finish. This is very drinkable, but I find the mouthfeel a little lacking, especially after the crispness of standard Franziskaner's Hefe-Weisse. After having this I definently feel it is time for me to explore the style some more."
"The mouthfeel is peppery and substantial with a nice amount of carbonation. The tang of the yeast puts it over the top. This ale is extraordinarily drinkable, and very enjoyable."
"The flavors are fairly good, both in the smell and the taste. Banana and wheat are present, along with some caramel that comes out in the finish. The mouthfeel is pleasing while the beer is easy to drink."
"Its appearance is dingy brown, but it also has a nice fluffy head that lingers for the whole liter. Aroma has a sour component and not much else. Flavor is quite refreshing with a mildly tart finish that wisps away rather quickly. Light chocolate and caramel malts give it some subtle complexity. It coats well with a clean finish, leaving just enough aftertaste (good) to keep me wanting more. Not as strongly wheat-ish as I remember the light Franziskaner Weiss, but still an excellent tasting and refreshing beer that tastes lighter than its name suggests."
"Sampled along side the regular Franz last night. The beer pours a hazy brown color wtih a huge billowing head that sticks around nicely. The nose is caramel coverd bananas and cream. Wow. I like it, but its a little weaker than I want it to be. The flavor has the banana and clove layerred over a creamy caramel background. Nice. The feel is thick and creamy. Maybe a hint more on the feel for me. Another great offering"
"Pours a cloudy red color. Has a monster head like a good German Wheat beer should. The head never seems to go away. I can smell roasted malts, banana, and cloves. The taste is clean. Notes of banana, yeast, and alcohol come out from behind the malts. Over all this a great beer for the price. Spaten keeps their Hefe-Weisse Dunkel very true to the style."
"This is a nice dark wheat beer that poured a very nice head. One can see the unfiltered yeast when holding it up to a light. Smell has hints of banana and clove, other than that nothing noteworthy. Taste is a medley of yeast and wheat with a slight hint of banana and cloves. This has a nice full mouthfeel. This beer nicely glides over one's palate. Near-excellent drinkability, this is a beer that has grown on me tremendously since I have started it!"
"Yeast upfront. Yeast in the back. Yeast yeast yeast yeast yeast yeast yeast. There's some more banana in the back, and though the flavor is kind of complex it just doesn't have that ""zing"" that I like in a weisen, that explosion of wheat malt and fruit that I look for in a wheat beer, especially a dunkel. It's not a bad flavor; it's just not very good."
"Drinkability  Superb! This is a rare, lovely import. The strong yeast and darkish fruits make this one a standout and clearing the gem of the Spaten weizens."
"Pours a deep chocolate color, with a glowing carmel base. The head was huge and creamy. Smells very similar to it's hefe-weiss brother, of banana and clove. This beer does have a biscuity maltiness in the nose that seperates it from it's brother. Taste is sweet with malt and highlighted by strong banana and faint clove flavors. Mouthfeel isbn't as thick and creamy as it should be, left me wanting a little. Not a bad beer, above average, and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: It's ok. It's pretty refreshing for a dunkle, and I could have more than one, although it really starts to get boring after 16.9 ounces. I'll just call if average and leave it at that."
"Drinkability: Nothing particularly bad, but nothing exactly fantastic either. The plain old Franziskaner Hefe is better."
"The flavor is fruity sweet, I pickup a bit of caramel to start off with which rolls to some bananas and lemons and I detect a bit of cherry in there too. The beer finishes a little mild and empty and perhaps leaves a bit of a soapy taste in my mouth not the best finish for an up to now tasty brew. While I enjoy this brew, I know there are better examples of the style out there. This may be a good brew to use as an introduction to the style as it is not in your face spicy/fruity but does give some of the standard characteristics of the style. A decent brew but if you are craving a great dunkel weizen experience, look elsewhere."
"Nice refreshing beer."
"Poured a slightly transluscent nut brown color with a thick rocky off white head that subsided slowly. Aroma has hints of clove with a distinct yet subdued banana ester with that distinct wheat scent. The flavor begins with a crisp carbonation which quickly lets a dry,dark malt flavor which is not roasted but does have a hint of chocolate in the flavor. The hops don't make much of an appearance and the flavor quickly presents a complex yeast profile that is very clean with only the banana and clove to linger on for a few seconds. The mouthfeel is excellent for a wheat beer as it has a very low carbonic bite yet is still crisp and carbonated and the head retention is indicative of this. Pretty good for a Dunkel Hefe although i would prefer Erdinger it is nice to have diversity and it is great if you are presenting a Dunkelweiss tasting."
"Pours a clouded chestnut copper color with a volumnous beige head that lasts a good duration. Some roasty wheat notes, mild yeasty twang and ripe banana/clove, but overall the nose is pretty tame for a dunkelweizen. Lively carbonation gives a fluffy mouthfeel. There's some fruitiness upfront that melds with dark, sweet wheat malt, and then moves towards the clovey, phenolic dry finish. Overall feel is that it's rather thin and one-dimensional. Pretty drinkable, though."
"I don't remember whether this beer or Paulaner's dunkelweizen was my first dark German wheat, but it's certainly been a constant favorite of mine for more than a decade (moreso since the Paulaner no longer seems to be imported; I haven't seen one of their dunkels in the US in about 5 years)."
"My first Dunkel-Weizen and a good one it was. This beer poured a dark brown color with a very nice head that lasted the whole glass. The smell was typical for a bavarian wheat beer but had a bit more malt presence. The flavor mirrored the smell, with the great bananna and sweet flavors of a traditional hefe but with a bit more malt presence. I can't say if I like this more or less than a traditional Hefe but I can say that it was a damn good beer!"
"Poured a cloudy, iced-tea color, with a big thick and pillowy head, typical of a Hefeweizen. Immediate aromas are the obvious fermented wheat, overripe bananas, cloves, and a touch of vanilla. Taste was a bit spicy up front, then fruity like sour apples and a bit tangy, with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is light and very carbonated... the mouthfeel was just a little too thin. Nonetheless, a totally drinkable and tasty Hefeweizen Dunkel, just nothing spectacular (and nothing compared to their regular Hefeweizen)."
"A far wheat, there are much better dunkels out there"
"(500 ml bottle, bought in Denmark). Cloudy brown colour, large lasting head. Aroma of brown bread and some spicy sweetness. Flavour is malty but not overly sweet, some spicy and subtly roasted edges. Smooth and mellow, nothing to blow your socks off, but still a beer it is a pleasure to drink. I had it on on its own, must be good with a meal too."
"pours a nice iced tea looking amber/brown colour with an off-white fluffy head. looks a bit better than i really expected. smells sweet and citrusy with wheat, wood an deearth in the background. everything is a bit muddied though and the smell can be weak at times, but overall, it's pretty nice. the taste is far from what i expected based on the smell here. not bad, but pretty average. the problem is the heavy caramel sweetness here. it's like drinking just the syrup from a soda at times. there's a malty sweetness throughout as well. again, not bad, but too dominant over what amounts to only slight hints of the characteristics that i mentioned in the smell. overall, this is a pretty decent brew, though not great. the flavour balance needs some serious overhaul in my opinion."
"Overall a very full flavorful hefeweizen, however I do prefer the regular hefeweizen from this company."
"From a tall, wheat-beer glass, this is an attractive beer: towering, puffy, solid head and a muddy brown color. The beer has a round, yeasty aroma with a touch of banana and clove. Its fruity, soft, full of yeast flavors, and a bit malty. Theres a little wheat flavor mixed in there as well. I enjoyed this beerits a tasty example of a dunkel-weizen. I always enjoy this style in the mid-summer, but its always better when its absolutely fresh and very yeasty."
"Pours a cloudy caramel color, with a quick bubbly head, that went from large to small after a couple sips. Smells malty, and possibly like chocolate flavored bananas. Tastes slighty sour. Has a malty flavor, and is dry. More carbonation than some of the other hefes I've had. I don't enjoy the aftertaste at all. This is only drinkable to me for 1. But well worth a try."
"A very solid beer that is worth another try. Very nice."
"It was rather more intensely carbonated than I expected, and the malt taste was strong. It had hints of yeastiness and bread. Quite nice."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy off-white head. The aroma is good. It has a nice wheat scent with some dry crystal malt sweetness. It is a fruity with a refreshing yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has a dry malty flavor with some wheaty notes. It is lightly fruity on the finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine Dunkel. It has good aroma and mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel is lively and cleansing and smooths out as the beer gets warmer in the glass."
"The taste is unbelievably flavorful with the overwhelming wheat that makes me understand why Germans believe that beer is food. This could get me throught the day or night. There is a hint of the yeast near the end. It is very thick in the mouth and is extremely easy to drink. It is satisfying in almost every way. I haven't had many dunkel weiss beers but this one will have me looking for others."
"16.9 oz bottle, pours a soft dark brown and cloudy. Stately puffy tan head, excellent retention and leaves creamy lacing. Nose is of ripe bananas and a wiff of chocolate. Soft creamy mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Flavors of bananas, chocolate, vanilla, and cocoa. Reminds me of a yeasty chocolate milk shake. Love the style and love this Spaten creation."
"Overall, the best example of the wheat dunkel style I have come across yet."
"Taste is of dark wheat malt, some banana and clove but muted and disappointing. Some hop bitterness in the finish. Light sweet maltiness. Very thin in the mouth and not creamy at all like it looked during the pour. Drinkable, yes. Fulfilling, no. Very disappointing."
"Pours a deep brown with a touch of orange, topped by a surprisingly creamy head that lingers for a while. Deep nose of lightly sweet malt and a hint of yeast. Nice creamy mouthfeel yields a malty body balanced by the yeast. Not particularly my favorite style, but this is definitely a quintessential dunkel weiss. A good one nonetheless."
"poured a brownish orange hazy body with a white head that lasted well through the drink. pleasant aroma and flavor, definately wheaty with some banana and tropical flavors along with some darker dried fruit and a dry finish. a good beer with tasty, but mellow flavors.not something that wowed me but its all around a good choice."
"Smooth and very drinkable."
"Drinkability - very pleasant experience, especially in its proper container. A session beer with some class, I still like their hefeweiss a little better though."
"Personal note: warm 40-mph winds on the patio and this brew give me warm fuzzies."
"I was expecting this beer to be much more assertive in the flavor department, but it didn't offer much more than what a regular hefeweizen would. This does happen to be my first dunkelweizen, so maybe I just need more experience with the style. I usually don't give a beer the same numbers all across the board, but this one pretty much finishes up the same in all categories for me. All in all, it just seem to be a little too similar to a hefe but it adds up to be a good all around easy to drink wheat beer."
"Maybe it just hits my personal button- I like this brew."
"This is one of the few times that I will say that this Hefe-Weisse Dunkel had a better smell and flavor while being poured into a glass from a bottle. The color was a nice medium dark brown with loads of lose foam and plenty of lace while drinking a pint glass. The flavor had a sweet wheaty flavor but not much spice in the flavor or aroma. Nice Dunkel, but not the finish I expected while poured out of the tap!"
"The hazy greenish-brown brew pours quite hearty, and has a fair amount of retention. The aroma is faint with yeast notes and hints of the roasted grains that dominate the flavors. Wheat malt flavors provide the foundation and the majority of the taste. There are alcoholic notes in the nose, and a very dry yeasty finish. Hints of banana and other fruit flavors are mild, but noticeable. This brew is quite hearty, and a bit heavier than I expected."
"This Hefe Weiss Dunkel had all of the usual smell and taste characteristics...banana, bubblegum, cloves. I'd say this brew is right on target for the style. It's also a very beautiful wheat beer. It pours a nice creamy, cloudy brown with a puffy off-white head. I was particularly enticed as I let it sit in front of me in a tall hefe glass. Affordable, beautiful, and tasty. What more could you ask for?"
"Overall Impression: A nice dunkel. Refreshing, clean taste, smooth texture, pleasing appearance. The body seems a touch light, and the flavor is a bit mild, but it helps drinkability."
"I always get a kick with the picture of the monk looking into this empty mug. Looks like he had a few too many already. Anyhow...this poured out a murky light brown color with some medium carbonation. Smell consisted of some wheat, quite a bit of cloves and some fruit distant away. Not bad. Taste was alright. Some light exotic fruits hit with some clove and malts. Taste is kinda light, but quite thick in texture actually. I gave the mouthfeel score a little higher because I liked the amount of carbonation in this brew. Overall, it's not bad. I wouldn't mind sipping this in the summer time."
"Pours a murky, medium brown color. Head is big and billowing, even with a careful pour. The light tan head is big and billowing, even with a careful pour, and lasts forever. Looks like cake icing, in a way, and lacing sheets the glass. Aroma features bananas and some grapefruit, with a solid dose of allspice, and wheat/yeast earthiness. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and a creamy coating is present. Taste is twangy yeast, caramel malt, banana, clove, and a peppery bite. The carbonation remains very active throughout. Hops play only a minor role. I'm not a major fan of this style, and this one seems to be middle of the road compared to the other Dunkel Weisses I've had."
"I've slowly come to appreciate wheat beers, though that wheat/grass taste still comes to the fore in every wheat beer I drink. This one pours cloudy brown into my nonick with a thick white head that releases a spicy aroma, with that grassy sour smell. Taste is similar. Crisp, almost lemony (this without adding a lemon, thank you very much), full of grassiness. The carbonation is subdued, but seems to stand out in every sip. Mouthfeel is typical for Weiss beers, nice carbonated light and crisp, though kind of makes me long for a thick, chewy wheat beer. Overall, a good beer, though I would probably prefer this one in the warmer months."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Had this on tap at the hotel bar where I was staying at in Nurnburg. First, this is not my favorite style of beer at all, but David asked me to have a wheat beer for him, so I ordered it, and sat down to review like I always do. I was pleasantly surprised! Unfiltered light root beer color when served, it have a very thick cream colored head riding on top. I detected the banana/clove notes when taking big whiffs of it, but also found a nice, dark brown bread undertone as well. I found the taste well rounded, with a light malt, slightly sweet flavor. There was also a bit of dryness in the finish. I am starting to appreciate this style of beer slowly but surely."
"The beer poured a cloudy medium brown with a thin head. It smelled of fruit and spice over a light maltieness. It had a light malt taste with hints of fruit. Just a tinge of hops in the finish. It was well bodied and oily. This is a real grainy beer, almost a grain soup. A very soft flavored beer that is extremely filling with a bite. A nice change of pace."
"Beef Notes: It's kind of like their regular hefe mixed with an Aventinus. I'd like to try it again."
"Drinkability: this is a little lower because it is just so full and potent in its pint bottle that you cant get very many down before bedtime."
"Those numbers are right. This beer looked, smelled and felt like it should taste good. But somehow, it didn't. This beer was incredibly bland, nearly flavorless. Amazing. It's worth buying just to experience it. Very strange. Other than the weird taste thing, the beer was good. I will not buy it again though."
"John"
"Drinkability is very good! I like the Erdinger version better, but this is certainly acceptable!"
"I enjoyed this dunkel weizen right after the standard Franziskaner Weizen and it was only a slightly better than good. The beer poured a rust color with a really thick fluffy head. The smells were yeasty, lemon - grapefruit with a hint of caramel malt. The flavors folowed suit with the breadlike yeast flavors dominating over some caramel malt and dry lemon-like hop bitterness. Finished nice and dry. A good example, easy to drink one after another and rather enjoyable, especially at $1.99 per bomber."
"Overall: boring, somewhat one dimensional in taste, absolutely could not stand the murky shade of brown, I was turned off as soon as I poured the beer"
"Zum wohl!"
"Very nice dunkel, albeit on the thin side. I had this in comparison with a Weihenstephan dunkel, and it held up favorably. Nice, thick foamy head, very good retention. Spicey clove taste, with more than a hint of banana. Quite refreshing and drinkable. No complaint with this one."
"One of the best Dunkel Weizens I've had. Chestnut brown and cloudy from sediment. Huge rocky head looking like the Swiss Alps. Big roasted malt aroma with significant clove and a bit of caramel. Smooth and full bodied with a slight crispness. Nice big spicy wheat flavor that is good till the very end. Great brewery and probably my favorite in Deutschland."
"Francis"
"This one poured nice with a dark full body and heavy head. The smell was of banana and cloves, as for the norm in this style. The taste was a complexes dry toasted malt with a light banana fruitiness. It finishes with a dry malty flavor with a hint of cloves, very refreshing!!"
"It is an enjoyable beer with interesting characteristics of a hefe and a dunkel. Finish was a little dry and tart. Not as well balanced as some hefe-weizens."
"Pours a nice medium brown with a billowy cloudly like off white head. the smell is the typical clove, caramel banana scent. The taste was a nice malty finish with the clove undertones and w hint of the wheat. The mouthfeel was a bit grainy but pretty smooth overall. Drinkability is medium i could drink a few but not make a night of it. This would be great with a sauerbraten or german roasted pork with mushroom onion gravy with this beer as an ingredient."
"Overall, this was a well-rounded and very, very good beer--and a nice recovery for Franziskaner after the Club-Weisse I had a week ago."
"The off-white, big, pillowy, foamy head leaves thick, foamy lacing. The beer is cloudy/opaque, dark brown/reddish. A slightly cheesy, sweetish nose. Dark fruit and chocolate in the front. The middle is fruity, a little watery. Nice chocolatey, dry finish. This beer is downright ok."
"This is a nice, average beer. Not bad, not great"
"Not as complex as I would have liked. Just very one dimensional. Which makes it clean and refreshing, but simple."
"Though I prefer the light weizen, this was an interesting treat nonetheless. I think I could probably grow to like this if I tried it a few more times."
"Dark brown color, hazy. Large head. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate and bananas. A nice medium bodied dunkel weiss. Malts are slightly roasted chocolate malts. Slightly sweet. Citrus, chocolate and banana flavors. Slightly spicy. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"A nice beer to add to the repertoire at the Beer Sellar, Newport, Kentucky. This brew came fairly dark in color, being somewhere between a dark amber and mahoghany, but without the reddish highlights of mahoghany. The head was off-white and the lacing was very nice. The flavor tended a bit toward the sweet side and it did not have much hop bite. The aroma was mostly of malt and a bit bready. A smooth, creamy feel added to the overall experience."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Overall, a decent brew but kind of lacking in taste and character. Guess I expected a little more....."
"This dunkel hefeweizen beer poured a murky brown color (light coffee color) with tall, creamy, light tan foam that persisted long and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was a pleasant lightly fruity (banana) malt aroma with notes of wheat and bread. The taste was malty, lightly sweet, with a gentle flavor of banana and hints of caramel and yeast. There was a mild hop flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth but with a mild tangy touch. There was a lingering caramel malt type aftertaste. This was an enjoyable and drinkable weiss beer."
"I've never had a dark hefe before. I really like the combination of the wheat and lemon zest with the dark malt flavors. I think I would prefer a plain hefe on a regular basis, but would enjoy one of these on occasion."
"A nice cloudy brown color with a light head on top. The aroma was dominated by toasted malt and yeast. The taste was very tart with a strong yeastiness and light toasted malt holding up the rest of the beer. A decent beer, good for a session beer, but somewhat boring. I much preferred the plain hefe-weiss."
"This beer was a very deep brownish-red color. The head was tremendous, lasting through the whole beer at about a quarter inch thick. A really nice looking beer. A nice aroma as well, sweet malts and a strong fruity smell. The taste was pleasant, sweet malt up front followed by a slight citrus flavor. The aftertaste was sweet but not sugar sweet, more like dark fruits. There was a slight roasted malt flavor hidden deep inside the brew. Not much hops to speak of but this beer did have a nice balance. Mouthfeel was crisp but a little thin. A very drinkable beer, especially during the summer."
"Pours a beautiful cloudy dark brown hue under a big firm tan head that lingers long but left surprisingly little lace. The nose is very strong: lots of yeast and a bit of flowery sweetness. The mouth is prickly sweet, as it should be. Yeast dominates the taste, with just a touch of sweet flowers. Don't go looking for hops here, but this is a fine example of what an unfiltered dark wheat beer is supposed to taste like."
"Pours beautifully. True hefeweisen in appearance. Nice high rising head with good stick around ability. Medium cloudy brown. Aroma didn't do much for me. Taste is classic hefeweisen, but a little sweeter than some others. Maltier and good bite, some lemon. But yet it is a little watery tasting. Mouthfeel is velvetty. Very enjoyable drink."
"Half a liter bottle poured into a Franziskaner Weizen glass. It pours a dark reddish-brown with 3 fingers of light tan head that has awesome retention. There is some lace left down the side of the glass. The smell is full of toasted malt, spices, and fruit. The taste has some raisin and malty flavors, but was lacking the flavor of other weizens. The mouthfeel is fairly strong, and the drinkability is good."
"Drinkability/notes: A pleasant, although somewhat undistinguished wheat. Although it may not overwhelm, neither does it disappoint."
"This is a premium beer. Pours a dark tone with a thick and lasting (and lacing) head between white and tan. As poured, the smell is let off immediately, and in such a memmorable fashion. Strong wheat and yeast aromas in a somewhat skunky fashion, very appealing. The taste, quite similar to the regular Weissbier has perhaps more body and a bit stronger perception on the hops, which enhances this feel but slightly opaques some other flavours. The mouthfeel is, still, soft and comfortable but the beer may come a bit heavy (at least when drinking a few too many). An excellent beer from this brewery."
"Pours a dark, cloudy, brown with a very thick, frothy, almost creamy white head. The head persists, both as a thin (a few millimeters thick) layer, and as lacing on the glass for most of consumption. The aroma is malty and a bit floral. As it warms a bit of a spicy (cinnamon and others?) aroma can also be detected. The taste is also of malt, there is some sweetness, and as with the aroma, cinnamon and other spices come out in the taste as the beer warms. Both the aroma and taste make this a very inviting and enjoyable beer. Very smooth drinking, with a fullish body."
"Dunkel weizen is an incredible style done right, and this is one of those!"
"Poured a hazy light brown color with big pillowey head,aroma a little spicey and somewhat sweet.taste is a litle tart balanced with some toffee sweetness,a little light in the body but overall pretty drinkable.Not a real big fan of this style but a pretty decent brew."
"Served with lemon."
"It's burnt orange, cloudy, and murky. The head is huge at first and thick. It then subsides to a confident coating of protection. The aroma seems pretty subdued. My allergies are acting up as of late, so it might be great to smell. I just get some faint hefe whiffs. The maltiness is superb in this brew. It's medium bodied and the maltiness leads with the typical hefe flavors following along for a solid background. It's definitely more filling and ""mealish"" that a regular hefeweizen. So it's not as easy to drink as say Franziskaner Hefe...but it's a treat."
"Appears a cloudy brown tone with slightly hazy tan foaming head, very good retention on this hefe. The aroma is mild and delicate with tones of clove, banana, and a citrusy undertone. The flavors are all present that are characteristic in the hefe, buthe dunkel wiesse also produces a sweet caramel wheat tone that is very mild but detectably good there is also a slightly more bitter aftertaste than the regular hefe. Dunkel hefe with a medium to light body which continues to deliver me pure refreshment being one very drinkable offering."
"Flavor has a lot of lemon in there, and it is balanced well by yeast and bananas. It has a crisp start, and it then smoothes out to a very creamy feel leaving tingly little bubbles on your tongue. Grains come in big in the aftertaste adding to the complexity. I was searching for darker malts, but I did not find them. I expected something a bit roastier out of a dunkel - weizen. It was a great beer, but I think it lacked the dark character it needed to receive more credit from me according to style."
"I was never a fan of Wheats, this beer gave me second thoughts. Pours a cloudy almost orange with a good tight head. Aromas are of bananna, caramel, a hint of clove, and a bit of bread. Taste is malty, with the typical yeasty bananna flavor reigned in. I think of this beer as a much more restrained version of a Weizen. If it has one real flaw its just a bit too watery. Thin mouthfeel or not, it is refreshing and quite drinkable."
"Nose was of cinnamon and all-spice, and was a bit smoky. The classic German banana phenol was faint and not too sweet. Its flavors were dominated by a little bit of apple and a slightly chewy, lightly roasted wheat. Beyond this, the beer was lacking in much anything else - its caramel flavor was not very good and the finish was fairly drying. Mouthfeel was tingly from the carbonation. Overall, it was fairly easy to drink, but fairly unimpressive. Next to the Ramstein Classic Wheat, it was definitely the lesser by a bit."
"Overall not a bad brew...I think in the future I'll just do the Franzikaner hefe-weiss (non dunkel) but I wasn't disappointed with this journey."
"A very good Dunkelweiss. Good flavor, but not as good as some others (most notably Weihenstephaner) Very easy to drink, very smooth taste. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Weiss beer or is willing to try it. For around $2 a bottle, its affordable and enjoyable."
"I grabbed a few of these before coming back to the states for about 50 cents(.50 euro) a piece. About a week or two after coming back it was still just as fresh as I'd had in Germany. 4 months later I broke open the last one and it had deffinatly gone down hill a bit. Starting to lose some of it's spice flavors, and getting some skunky flavors. Still, a great beer, but I'll deffinatly be looking for the newest imports at my local store if I plan on picking this up anytime in the future."
"A good solid dunkel that is much preferred to their hefe-weiss. The tap version seems a much better bet than the bottled form, which is an oddity for a weizen."
"I thought this stuff was God-awful. I could not even get through drinking what I had. Pours a cloudy brown with a decent foamy head. Could not detect very much from the nose. Some banana flavors, maybe some chocolate, and definite malt characteristics. Full-bodied mouthfeel. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, but this stuff just did not go over well wiht me. Besides macro-swill, this may be one of the worst beers I've sampled."
"Maybe I got a bad bottle, but this didn't go down to well. Poured out brown with a nice head. Lots of sediment. Tastes of wheat, and sour fruit. I like Franziskaner's regular Hefe (was my first of the style,) but this one just doesn't hold up. Although it was cheap, it tasted cheap. No more will this enter my home!"
"Pours a cloudy chestnut with a thick tan colored head which settles to a dense layer after some time. Aromas are of malts, caramel, yeast. Clove taste comes through the sweet maltiness at the start. Becomes more bready midglass and finishes kind of flat with a mild bitterness. Thinner mouthfeel than other dunkels I've sampled but pretty drinkable."
"This beer looks like liquid caramel topped by a two-finger layer of light tan whipped cream. The aroma is very bready and yeasty with hints of coriander. The taste is lively, with a nice yeastiness to the tangy wheat character. Hints of chocolate covered bananas push through the crispness and are quickly whisked away by the carbonation and cleaned up by a very faint bitterness. A full bodied mouthfeel is floated on the proliferous carbonation, which expands in the mouth and makes this beer very refreshing. This is my first dunkel-weiss, and I was expecting a bit more chewiness. It is every bit as refreshing as a standard hefe, but with a bit more malt character. A very nice brew."
"Had on tap at D's. Pours a dark tinted pale brown color with minimal head. Fragerance is that of cloves, bananas, and apples. At first I noted a taste of apples, but after that I tended only to taste the mellow hops and malts. Carbonation is light and its body is almost heavy enough to be characterized as chewy, but not quite. Extremely drinkable, i polished off two without realizing it while watching the pens game. Goes down very smooth."
"Banana and cloves on the nose....muddy brown in appearance with a spritzy, white lace....taste is cloves and spicy..a bit thin in the mouth..I like dunkels a lot and this is solid, but no earth mover..."
"A solid offering. Poured a cloudy dark color. Had a ""gruff"" taste in my throat, a pleasant one at that. I found this very enjoyable, easy to drink and quite refreshing. It ad a great fresh taste to it, almost like the grain was still suspended in the beer. I will definitely drink this again."
"Dark cloudy brown, with an off-white head. Banana and malt aroma. Watery mouthfeel, that teeters between smooth and crisp towards the finish. Taste consists mainly of malt, yeast and sour fruit. As beer warms flavor takes on an almost ""pumpkin"" taste to it. This one didn't appeal to me at all."
"Pours a slightly indistinct garnet color with a Herculean sized head, frothy in texture, the lace is thick clinging sheets. Aroma of fresh bread dough is upper most with nice hints of malt and coriander, fresh and clean and a pleasure to the senses in all respects. On the outset sweet with a middling top and a modest acidity that is followed by an apropos hop spiciness ending in a dry long lasting aftertaste, quite a decent drinking beer."
"For me this is just another average beer."
"The bottle I had the other night, which was a seriously hot November night, really hit the spot. I especially enjoyed the hints of chocolate."
"Pours a cloudy deep golden-brown with a thick cream-colored head.  Very good head retention.  Earthy and malt flavors are dominant in this medium-bodied brew.  All around, an average to nice Dunkel Weiss."
"Cloudy brown with a 1/3 inch head and lace trailing down the glass.  Aroma is a beautiful combination of cloves and banana, and a bit of yeast. Flavor starts yeasty, then switches to banana and clove... also a bit earthy.  Slight metallic taste in the finish. Medium body and low carbonation; initially it was prickly, but quickly became very smooth and dry. A very soild dunkel weiss."
"It seems odd that I shouldn't rave about a beer for which I can offer no legitimate complaints..."
"Medium-brown cloudy liquid with puffy three-finger tan head looked impressive in appropiate weisse glass.  Yeah, this beer had a banana, clove, bubblegum profile, but it was very subdued and any kind of chocolate and/or roasted dunkel flavors were almost undiscernable.  Not a bad beer, mind you, just pretty average."
"Pours with an average cream-colored head, over extremely murky opaque brown liquid. Nose is clove and banana aromas. Gentle carbonation. Taste is malty sweetness followed by a fruity yeast flavor. Finishes effervescent and light, a nice dunkleweizen"
"This is a solid hefe-weisse. Its hazy amber color and off-white head are impressive. The head leaves beautiful lace in the glass. The smell is a little fruity with some notes of malt tied in as well. The malty tones are present throughout the beer, and the typical hefe-weisse yeast character is there, too. It's smooth on the tongue with some decent carbonation. It could use a bit more, however. It's quite drinkable, also, making it a very solid brew. I prefer this to the standard Franziskaner Hefe-weisse."
"Hazy, hazy light brown, big and pillowy head.  Yeasty and citric aroma.  Early orangey flavors, a little ester that strays toward nutmeg.  Some sense of hazel nut.  Cottony and very mild, mouthfeel is light and fades fast.  Definite orange-rind aftertaste.  Minimalist brew, doesn't strike me at all."
"Earthen colored and thick with a massive creamy head. Smells of cloves, spices and banana. This brew fills the mouth. Initially attacks with a wheat and orange flavor with a tinge of cloves. This soon moves to a thick flavor not unlike banana bread. Hop taste is hidden amongst the onslaught of chewy chocolate malt, but manages to sneak into the tail end of the long musty finish."
"I enjoy drinking this while eating some fruit or dessert."
"Thick milkshake-like beige head tops the dark scarlet red brew.  Aroma is musty and stale.  The taste is better than the smell, but not by much.  Slight phenolic tinges and fruity esters.  Slight chocolate.  Slight roasted malt.  Creamy medium body.  Drinkable, but pretty average for a dunkel weizen."
"Nice head that lasted all the way through to the end. The permanent part was even a bit large for beers who do keep permanent heads. Full brown cloudy body was nice but not spectacular. Nose is slight esters with good wheaty aroma. Reminded me vaguely of brownies, but less chocolatey. Ester taste is present but a bit subdued. Nice maltiness. Would probably have rated this higher if I had tried it before having Schneider Aventinus in bottle and on tap."
"In this style of beers, I like the Erdinger or the Tucher better, but this is a refreshing beer.  The light brown color and good carbonation upped the appearance and mouthfeel.  The aroma was a wheat sweetness, with hints of malt.  The flavor was more of the same, although the maltiness was more subdued, while the wheat came to the forefront.  I think the wheat is too overpowering, but it is a good beer all-around."
"Pours a dark brown with a little amber coloring and has a LARGE cream colored head like none other.  The smell is that of strong wheat.  The taste has a mild almost no sign of hop bitterness with the wheat taste prevailing as it should in this style.  However, even with the wheat taste protruding through, it is a rather mild flavored beer.  Not bad, but a very simple brew.  Prosit!"
"It has a big beautiful head that develops almost immediately upon the beer hitting the glass.  The color is a nice brown with hints of red.  It has the unmistakeable smell of a wheat beer, with hints of clove.  The flavor, however, is a bit of a disappointment.  It's a very mild flavor, to say the least.  In fact, the taste is really almost completely lacking.  It does have a decent mouthfeel and goes down like water on a warm day."
"248"
"Dark amber color with lots of head (had to wait a minute for the head to settle before I could finish pouring the glass).  There was a slightly off smell that made me think twice about drinking it. Mouthfeel was pretty poor to the point where it felt like I was drinking water.  However, the flavor profile was spot on, albeit subdued."
"Pours a caramely, earth browny with a short-lived tan head.  Aromas are smooth but nondescript and short-lived as well.  Taste is smooth but somewhat dull.  Starts rather like toffee before finishing with more traditional weissbier flavors.  The highlight of this beer is its pleasant mouthfeel."
"Notes: A decent dunkel weiss, not as expressive as others but just as nurturing as the rest. The malt is the show it seems, all of the other flavours are meek in comparison but this does not take away from the brew too much because it still has the lovely wheat twang."
"25 oz. bottle, brown with gold foil wrap. Cloudy amber to brown color, with floating yeasties. Big fizzy, not fluffy head, overly carbonated? Nice off-white color, though. Sweet smell of maltness, tartness, some bananas. Slightly carmel sweetness on the taste, some faint yeast flavors, despite the floating particles. Thinner body than expected, and overly carbonated, made it taste maybe thinner than intended. Overall, good, but lacked the doughy wheat flavor I expected, combined with the carbonation, made it less than I expected. It looked better than it was."
"Pours chocolately borwn with tan head. Smells slightly roasted with hint of yeasty bread.  Taste is slightly more rich than one would expect from a hefe-dunkle.  Slightly sweet with lemony clove flavor.  A little less body than I'd like. A decent hefe."
"Pleasant musty aroma, blossoming head, handsome cloudy leathery look. Ended up with a big blatch of yeast on the bottom of my glass. The malts and wheat contrasting with the yeast is what makes this brew. It's a healthy struggle, going between one and the other: first toffeeish, then fruity, then grainy, then crisp and refreshing. It ends up balanced just so, and relaxes in the belly, so it would probably be a suitable after-dinner beer, although that's not how I used it in this case. Like a fresh red apple, it's gently tart, appetizing and fulfilling at the same time."
"I love the creamy head that forms on this beer.  Had an interesting smell to it.  Interesting taste, almost a bit tangy.  Might be because I usually drink heavier beers.  A good beer."
"The absolutely massively thick and creamy head tops a dark bronze hued brew.  The copious bubble production slows the settling of the impressive head to a crawl.  The classic German Hefeweizen banana esters are followed by a rich, mellow chocolate note. After what seems like an eternity (if you're thirsty) the head settles and the liquid becomes accessible.  It's about time.  Moderate body w/ a proteinaceous viscous mouthfeel. Along w/ the typically musty, German hefeweizen yeast esters the complex flavor profile includes rich Dark Munich malt flavors along with very mellow and refined (dehusked?) German chocolate malt.  Hops bitterness is almost lost amongst the malt flavors and esters, but manages to eek itself into the finish.  This is definitely a complex brew.  It's quite rich, and thus isn't quite as drinkable as other brews.  A beer to treat yourself to if you're into German wheats."
"1Pt.9Fl. Oz Brown Bottle Gold foil wrap. Light brown cloudy beer with fine bubbles and a thick tan head that lasts and lasts.  Fruity/yeasty smell.  sweet light taste at first with a yeasty citrus, malty finish.  A great summer beer for the evening.  A beer of which starts simple and light but then shows its complexity while keeping its body throughout.  Truly crafted and drinkable."
"Starts by pouring a big / proper head. The body is a bit lighter then some other Weisse-Dunkels, nice and smooth none the less. The aroma is a pleasant, grainy, banana and toffee, which continues on the palate. Fine characteristics of banana then moves towards cloves and malt textures, as well as hints of spiciness and lemon. Overall I thought this was an good dunkWeisse and it was excellent with my potato pancakes & and cream of broccoli."
"Cloudy, unfiltered amber in color, followed by a dense, creamy, long lasting head. Banana clove flavors upfront with toffee, caramel in the middle. Nice clean finish of noble hops. I appreciated the bold, complex flavors of this true to style German beer. I've had too many insipid pretenders claiming to be hefeweizens."
"This is a beautifully cloudy amber colored dunkel weiss; when poured, it is crowned by a thick rich head.  The flavor is slightly smoky, with hints of cloves and banana (although, unlike other reviewers, the banana was not overpowering).  All told, not as good as Franziskaner's standard hefe-weiss, but still a beer worth drinking."
