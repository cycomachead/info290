"Pours a dark cloudy brown head, a medium beige head some light lacing. Aroma and taste is of dark lightly toasted caramel malt, yeast and some grain flavors. A medium body with light carbonation. Finish is lightly toasted caramel malt, yeast and grain. Aroma and taste seem a bit mild for the style, but still an ok drinking brew."
"It tastes more like a black lager than a dunkelweizen. Either way it's not bad"

"nice pour, good head, great color. Tastes closer to a light porter than a wheat. Not much wheat taste or character here. Overall, very nice flavor with a crisp, clean finish. Some malty and possibly some choclately flavors. Overall, a well done beer sitting above average on the scale !!!!"

"o: As a dunkel, this misses by a mile. I don't think it even uses a hefe yeast. As a wheat stout, this is good beer."

"It has far too much roasted malt for a dunkelweiss (coffee, chocolate) and not enough of the characteristic yeasty flavors (clove,banana), quite a disappointment"
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with little light transparency and half finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, mildly nutty, slight sour note. Flavor of toasted and caramel malt, hints of chocolate and charred coffee, finishes with light toastiness and light grassy hops. Medium bodied. The malt profile seems closer to a mild porter than a weizen; I'm not getting much wheat character at all. Flavor has nice toasty malt and light chocolate elements, but seems to finish thin with a light sourness. An OK dark malty beer, but not really meeting the dunkelweizen style, and a bit odd for that. This is the second Leavenworth wheat style ale that seemed to be more of a traditionally malted style than a weizen. Odd. OK, but better choices if you're looking for a dunkelweizen."

"Pours an appealing dark brown to black with a quickly dissipated head. Mouthfeel is bubbly like most wheat beers. Flavor is lacking for a dunkel the malty taste overpowers the effervescent nature of a wheat. Not bad but not great and I'm only reviewing this based on 1 beer picked up at Total Wine from the warm shelf."
"I did not finish this one. It's not out of the question that I had a bad bottle though. You never know how long something is sitting around. There was no bottling or best-by date on the bottle that I could find."

"Pours a sexy dark brown with a size able off white head and plenty of lace. Nutty aroma of roasted malt, wheat and hops. In the taste, roasted malts, tangy lemony wheat, and a firm bitterness. Good roast, but odd sourness and misplaced hops. I think this one needs some cleaning up."

"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of ripe banana, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, molasses, toast, clove, roasted malt, earth, and light yeast spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance. Taste of chocolate, banana, toast, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, roasted malt, toffee, pepper, earth, and light yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, banana, toast, nuttiness, and clove on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors with decent complexity; though it does feel a bit on the watery side; no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice and interesting take on a dunkelweizen. Nice roasted flavors with decent balance of fruitiness; very smooth and easy to drink. Definitely enjoyed this."

"Overall a drinkable dunkel but probably not a great one."

"Overall: This is a decent dunkelweizen, but I think it could be improved if the clove and banana flavors came through more in the beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a touch of yeast detected. Taste is also somewhat mild, some banana, a bit more hops than usual for this style, some mild spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is decent but mild for the style."
"Overall the beer is not flawed but is not really memorable either. A little more yeast centric flavors could make it more interesting, I could describe the beer as a filtered dunkelweizen. Makes the overall experience, not bad but dull."
"A hard sell at 18$ a 6er here in Alberta, I doubt I'd try this one again with all the other options available too me"

"Bruised banana logo would have been more appropriate. Pours a hazy brown with smallish head. Nose is a big, fat bruised banana. Palate offers a nice mix of brownbready flavors and esters from the nice yeast, along with more bruised banana. Medium-light bodied. Easy drinking. Not bad for an American attempt at the style."
"Starts out with a great head, doesn't retain it as well as it might. Actually a little darker and hazier than I had expected from a dunkelweizen, I know it needs to be dark and wheat is gonna mean some haze, but I've seen beers in this style look a lot more inviting. Still, something I can look at and think yeah, I'll drink that. Little bit of malt and hops on the nose, no bananas or cloves or any fruitiness to speak of really. Taste leans pretty strongly toward sweetness, not real balanced, but not undrinkably sweet or anything. Slight bit of roast from the dark malts, no mistaking the wheat in the malt bill, but much like the aroma, nothing really going on in the taste that jumps up and says ""good 'ol dunkelweizen!"" The mouthfeel on this reminds me of just about every beginner homebrew with wheat extract: undercarbonated and thin. Altogether, not really the beer for me - I'll stick with the import classics where this style is concerned unless I get wind of any must-have USA iterations. That being said, the beer is not so much bad as it is not good - remember how much worse it could be. Below average? Yes. Undrinkable, terrible, should be forcibly removed from the market? Not in my opinion. Is it even a dunkelweizen? I dunno about all that..."
"Malty aroma has a subtle fruity underpinning and a hint of cloves. It pours a dark, rather hazy mahogany with a decent, fine-bubbled, light tan head that leaves some good lacing. Flavor has a malty core and fruity, caramel and nutty notes. Smooth Texture has average body but a good amount of fizz."
""
"If you like session beers, look no further as a six-pack of this could easily be enjoyed in a few sittings. This wasn't bad so much as it was just ""eh..."". No banana, not much of a body, and lack of carbonation and head all combine to make this unmemorable but for anyone who wants a low-cost version of this style that's accessible by nearly all, this would be a sufficient choice."
""
"Overall: Nothing stuck out at me with this beer, which I'm not even sure could be considered a Dunkelweizen."

"Popured a light brown with one-finger head that sticks around glass on top of a rather mild, almost airy, sweet malt aroma although there are citric hefe notes as well. Light body, the lgiht citric/hefe characters are there, although no spice or wheat twang is really prevelant, and there is very minimal sweetness...like touches of toffee more than caramel or chocolate. Nice blend and balance so I don't mind sipping on it and there's touch of fruits and a dry malt base in the finish, but overall it's just too bland to be anything other than a half-decent beer."
"Pretty good beer. Nothing crazy outrageous. Something I could drink all night."

"D - Okay, but not a good representation of a dark wheat. Easy to drink though, so it might be a good gateway brew for someone."

"O: This beer recipe needs to be re-examined and given some TLC because it damages the rep of Fish Brewing and Leavenworth."
"This is a pretty good Dunkelweizen. I hav'nt had much of this style in a while and this is a good way to get back into them."
"Overall: Like the Leavenworth Whistling Pig I tried the other day, this beer is kind of a flop. I fear it's time to just clear the word ""Dunkelweizen"" right off the label, guys. Black IPA's are all the rage, so let's call this a Black American Pale Wheat Ale. Feel free to shoehorn ""alpine-style"" in there somewhere, too."
"O: This beer is better than advertised. Its very drinkable and has a nice flow of flavors as it is enjoyed."
"Poured into a weizen glass a deeper chesnut brown with thicker but quick to fade off white head atop.Aromas were very light with some minimal clove being the main component,a passing toasty wheat note comes thru as well.Alot like the aromas the flavors are minimal,light clove and again the toasted wheat.Very average beer for the style,not horrible but lacking any real punch of flavor."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, but not terribly complex either. Fun for drinking, but not for thinking."
"An ok summer drink and worthy of a session or two,,,but not as a Dunkel."
"Overall this is a good dunkelweizen. Not spectacular, but it has pretty good flavor, seems fresh and is very easy to drink."
"M/O: Very crisp and refreshing but the beer lacks a lot of the classic dark wheat qualities. The spiciness is nice but overall this beer lacks a lot of character."
"I wouldn't call it a Dunkelweizen. Maybe an American Amber flavored with some wheat. It's not actually bad, and as a quaff, it's acceptable."
"all in all, drinkable but not earthshattering. which is how i feel most of Leavenworth's stuff has turned out. I'd drink it again if it was on sale, but kind of unmemorable... and there are a lot of better dunkelweizens out there."
"The beeer is medium-bodied and effervescent. It certainly doesn't seem like a poor effort in this respect. A decent mouthfeel does not alone a good beer make, however. My overall impression is that this beer is a complete waste of time and money, Avoid at all costs. In this bottle lies nothing but shame."
"D: Very drinkable. Again, I was surprised by this beer, and would be happy to recommend to others."
"Pours a dark brown color with a tan head of moderate height. Head dissipated quickly but left a little lacing. Smell is of roasted malt and some caramel. Taste is mostly of roasted malt and a little of hops. No wheat taste at all. Mouthfeelnus a little watery, carbonation is fine. I was pretty dissapointed with this beer. It's not really a dunkelweizen if there is no wheat. It would be ab okay beer if they would rename it."
"Not much to bring me back to it. I'd drink it again if offered but it isn't something I'd probably buy again. Overall I'd say this is decent but not exceptional or outstanding."
"Doesn't seem much like a dunkelweizen at all. It's certainly easy to drink. If this were sold as a Dunkel lager, I'd give it better marks."
"Hmmm...a mild, in alcohol and flavour both, dunkelweizen, with the suggestion of a west coast hop dalliance. Interesting, I suppose, and it has enough basic elements to not write off entirely. I wouldn't refuse this if offered, as it's well made and plainly drinkable."
"D: Nowhere near what a good dunkelweisse should be, no yeast esters, and frankly not a real good tasting beer. For Leavenworth, just stick with the Alt."
"3.5/3/3/3.5/3.5"
"Not a well crafted Dunkle, some nice flavours and @ 4.7% certainly sessionable. Hefty price tag in Alberta will probably make this my last Leavenworth Dunkle I try for awhile."
"Appearance pours a dark amber with minimal head and lace. Smell of grainy sweet malty caramel. taste has a sweet smokey maltiness, with light hops and a note of chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is light, fair bodied, but almost watered down with good carbonation. Not bad of a brew, but could use a bit more balance."
"Not a bad beer but definitely missing some key elements for a dunkelweizen, or a memorable beer for that matter. Not worth the hefty import pricetag here in Alberta."
"Pours a murky bog of brown with a light frothy head. Smells of malts and wheat stretch out to grab the nose, but they do not overstay their welcomes. Those malts and wheat return when the tongue gets involved, with the wheat appropriately making up the majority of the flavor profile. Not too much complexity, though a very faint hint of smoke signal can be detected somewhere in the wheaty static. Lighter than most dunkels that I've had, the taste doesn't hang around too long, but that does make for a pretty drinkable brew."
"Drinkability is high, this is a tasty, nice fall flavor without being to sweet and cloying. Highly quaffable."
"In the final reckoning, Boulder Bend Dunkelweizen Alpine-Style Dark Wheat Ale is no better than Whistling Pig Alpine-Style Wheat Ale. Maybe if Fish put as much effort into brewing as they do into naming, these Leavenworth Biers would at least be decent."
"The body is good, light and full with out being sticky. Drinkability is very good, a great beer for these last few days of summer. Worth trying if you see it and perhaps worth some effort to seek out."
"taste is of some wheat, some chocolate in the back, sour malt, and roastiness, ends a little dry."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I got to be the second reviewer of this beer. Unfortunately this really isn't anything to go crazy about. Its a very average beer, making the marks of the style just barely. The brewers played it really safe with this brew, no experimentation, just a basic american wheat beer with darker coloring and roasted malt. I really appreciate smaller brewers, but in order to compete some of these guys really need to step up there game."
"Not bad stuff, just not very good either. What a find i have made ; ("
