3.62,-12.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a cloudy, golden-brown coloring that is slightly hazed with a thin, filmy coating. Good lacing along the glass. The nose is subtle, with fruity highlights, some clove spicing, as well as some coriander. Flavors are heavily spiced, with coriander, nutmeg, and all-spice on a tangy caramel backbone. The aftertaste is a spicy blend, with a smooth, creamy finish. Interesting brew.","GarthDanielson","Mar 10, 2012"

4.18,1.2,5,4.5,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is a bit heavy for a wheat beer but it gives this more of a robust quality I feel is appropriate for a Winter beer. Overall, a nice dunkelweizen but spice qualities overpower the malts a bit too much.","Kinsman","Feb 15, 2011"
3.36,-18.6,2,3.5,4,1,3.5,"Overall, I think this has the potential to be a quite solid dunkelweizen. It would have been vastly better if the spice and clove was cut back a bit in order to let the banana shine, and if it were carbonated - these two crucial areas really hurt its overall score.","mjn5036","Nov 02, 2010"
4.28,3.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D - Very drinkable. The banana flavor is really present and stays perfectly balanced with the other flavors. There is quite a bit going on here, but it all works really well.","ngeunit1","Jun 14, 2010"
4.27,3.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a moderate brown color with a nice off white head. The nose is caramel as well as banana and clove. The taste is a good balance between caramel sweetness and some banana and clove. Great feel with a really nice balance between the yeast and malt. Drinks very well and is a nice take on the style.","Thorpe429","Beers"
3.73,-9.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D - This is a tasty brew, a good hefeweizen but still lacks some of the smooth wheat character of a traditional example. I consider this better than average for the most part.","Slatetank","0"
4.67,13.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Drinks like a low abv beer. You want to quaff this one and kick back but it's so well made you have to sip and savor. At least for the first glass. After that all bets are off. Then you have to watch out for the sneaky abv. Now that I've had it I'm going to have to contact my new friends in the area to procure some more of this stuff. If I could get this all the time the only thing that would stop me from drinking it would be a hefe of the same caliber. Then I could switch beer from warm months to cold. Best dunkel I've had","scootny","Mar 02, 2010"
4.27,3.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a really nice beer to session with for a long time.","TheManiacalOne","Apr 21, 2009"
4.25,2.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"22oz. bottle purchased on KTG eve. Served in a weizen glass at 50 degrees. Poured a dull burnt orange with hazy clarity and a three inch creamy, off-white head. Head eventually settles into a frothy, quarter inch cap. Some web-like swaths of lacing revealed during the tasting. Smells great - banana and bubblegum dominate the front with some clove character coming out behind. Taste is somewhat muted in comparison to the boldness of the nose. Also, a bit of citric acid comes out in the middle, as well as a subtle wheat quality in the mix. Finish reminds me of banana peel strings. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a pleasant background carbonation. I love this style and I really dig this beer.","Jwale73","Apr 01, 2009"

4.8,16.2,5,5,4.5,5,5,"Notes: This is absolutely the best Weizen/Weizebock/Dunkelweizen I have ever had. Better than all the big name german ones, even. Kudos to Todd and Tyler for putting Portsmouth on the map, again. I wish this was a year-round brew.","GarthTaargus","Jan 31, 2009"

4.4,6.5,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Overall this was a very tasty beer. The flavors are crisper than I've come to except from this family of beers, and needless to say I was impressed. Worth a shot, and thanks again for Norica for sending this one along!","glid02","Dec 15, 2008"
4.63,12.1,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured into a weizen glass, appearance and lacing doesn't get any better. Aroma and finish of slight cloves, faint banana in the nose but predominantly bubblegum. This beer blows away any import dunkelweizen that you can find stateside, a true joy to drink. 7% and loaded with yumminess, a beer to drink all day/night long that doesn't B$#@*slap your palate and forget where you parked your car. If only other US brewers would pay more attention to similiar styles and doing them as well as this. I hope there is more left the next time I'm in Portsmouth. Cheers to great beers <7%!!!","Norica","Dec 06, 2008"
4.33,4.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A summery winter wheat, or a wintry summer wheat? Both. And as such, something very drinkable throughout the year. Recommended by staff at the brewpub itself, this Weizen poured out a bit flat with no head, yet upon sampling had 'hidden' carbonation that opened up a nicely complex flavor. On on hand there was a slightly Christmas quality with apple ginger hints and a medium body. On the other hand, there was a lightness that displayed lemon-cloves that reminded one of summer. Not too sweet, nice wheat hops and definitely an easy beer to enjoy.","selecter70","May 29, 2008"
3.8,-8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a weizen glass. Color was a golden amber, beer was very cloudy with small amounts of bubbles rising from the bottom. A very small thin foamy head disappeared quickly leaving a ring around the top. Aroma was strongly banana bread, and was slightly sweet with a dash of vanilla. Taste was slightly of banana bread, more bread than banana with a bit of sweet cloves. Also a bit of citrus hiding in there. Felt good in the mouth. Coated nicely, a bit of carbonation. Vey easy to drink. Worked pretty well for a style I usually associate with summer not winter.","mountdew1","Apr 19, 2008"
4.21,1.9,3.5,5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazed copper color, darker around the edges. Creamy white head diminishes, but stays with the beer for the duration. Smells like banana bread, and I'm loving that! There's clove in there, too. Crazy lingering banana flavor, spicy too. Nice creamy mouthfeel....this is just excellent!","corey0212","Apr 07, 2008"
4.19,1.5,3,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I say this brew is a must try for any fans of the style","joepais","Dec 29, 2007"
4.3,4.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Taste is very spicy, bit malty but the spiciness really controls this beer, strong orange taste with a yeastiness, very sweet, slight lemonish taste, good carbonation if only slightly high.","deltatauhobbit","Feb 07, 2007"
3.85,-6.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall- Tasty but the alc. really comes through for a 5.5% beer.","NJpadreFan","Apr 16, 2005"
3.88,-6.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A cloudy orange color with a medium head and nice lacing. The beer had a sweet, malty aroma. A fruity, banana taste with a little hoppiness at the end, althought the hops presence died out as I drank the pint. Decent mouthfeel, and very drinkable. I will have this again.","lordofthewiens","Mar 06, 2005"
3.97,-3.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer was still on tap when we last visited the brewpub. Pour when served was the color of burnished copper, and was slightly cloudy. The 1/2 inch white head died quickly. I was still able to pick up on the banana/cloves/yeastiness in the aroma. Medium in mouthfeel, tastewise the bananas and yeastiness is what stood out for me.","PatandDavid","Mar 06, 2005"
4.42,7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I was wonderfully surprised to see this beer on tap today when I drove to Portsmouth for lunch. It poured a hazy dark gold color with little head or lace. The nose has the clove, banana, and vanilla character you expect from a hefe weizen, but there is a little caramel not from the malt. All of the same is found in the flavor along with just a hint of orange peel, and a little roast malt character. Nice rich, smooth mouth feel. This is a highly drinkable beer that is really growing on me. I'm not sure about this being a dunkel. Great beer though.","carln26","Dec 29, 2004"

3.84,-7,4.5,3,4,3.5,4.5,"Fluff of half-inch head that stuck and laced straight down; very pleasing. Hazy, golden honey to an almost amber hue with little discernible action going on. Kind of a soapy fining note on nose with orange peel and maybe some annise; on the whole, a sedate bouquet that is difficult to pull out. Cloves, allspice, nutmeg, clover honey, husky wheat throatiness to taste that dissipates quickly. Quite busy at the start, it finishes quickly and leaves little residue.","Truh","0"
