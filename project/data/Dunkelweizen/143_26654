Was told that the distributor is selling them and had a six plopped down in front of me. Picked up a bottle and it's clearly stamped "03-20-2008".

3,-9.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Mightily impressed with the beer. It's not quite a dunkelweizen, but would make a nice German Dunkel. Solid malt backbone with mild graininess, hints of toffee, bread, and clean malt flavors. Lacks any wheat character at all -- not fruitiness, esters, phenolics, or wheat flavor. Clear appearance with a solid brown tint and moderate head retention. A little light in the body, allows graininess to come through. Finishes with a clean, sweet malt taste.","BEERchitect","Mar 08, 2008"
2.61,-21.4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Served in my Harpoon IPA glass (I really need to buy some weizen glasses). Poured a dark amber; almost brown in color. Half-inch off-white head subsided into a thin skim of foam almost immediately and then nothing. Nose is hard to place; malt I guess. Flavors are predominantly malt, but it was very difficult to detect other flavors due to the slightly metallic taste at finish; kind of like pennies. Pleasantly effervescect mouthfeel, but drinkability is seriously compromised by the aftertaste.","Jwale73","Mar 02, 2008"
3.52,6,3.5,4,3,3.5,4,"Nice dark color but not very much head. The smell was nice, had a little roasted aroma to it. Taste was decent but fairly bland with some more roastyness.

2.42,-27.1,2,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Amber to crimson shades in a weizen glass with a tall beige head. Actually, a nice looking beer. Smell is a touch metal, very light roast malt. Taste is a bit watery, yet somewhat creamy, very mildly flavored with a lightly bitter and tart malt flavor. Not really getting a lot of wheat, really. Not too familiar with the style, but this probably isn't the best example. Drinkable, but unremarkable.","JDV","Feb 07, 2008"

2.79,-16,4,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Because Shiner Hefe-Weizen (along with 98 Bavarian Style Amber) is my favorite Spoetzl brew, I thought they'd do a pretty job with their dunkelweizen. Uh... no. I'd recommend going back to the drawing board and rethinking this whole thing.","BuckeyeNation","Jan 14, 2008"
3.55,6.9,4,4,3,3.5,4,"Poured into a mug, this is somewhat light in body for a winter brew. Chocolate in the nose, the palate is doughy but not very complex. Well assembled, this may not be on the level of say Aventinus or Erdinger, but from a dignified brewery in Texas, this is very impressive indeed. In fact, I really have no beef with Spoetzl Brewery's products. They are a real brewery with a real personality. This dunkel is good, their Bohemian Black Lager is an American schwartz beer classic.","thebeerdoctor","Jan 04, 2008"
3.28,-1.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"d: Would benefit from more complex flavors, but overall its not too bad. Simple and easy drinking, it wasn't bad, but I probably won't buy it again.","BradLikesBrew","Jan 03, 2008"
3.36,1.2,4,3,3.5,4,3,"Poured out a clear dark amber beer with a nice fluffy one finger head. Smell of sweet malt. Mouthfeel is surprisingly a bit creamy. Drinkability is ok.

3.76,13.3,4,3,4,4,4,"Appearance is dark amber, garnet with very little head. Aroma is pleasant, somewhat sweet and toasty. Taste is taosty, oaty, malty, with a little bitterness. The sweetness and maltiness dominates, but the aftertaste is a bit bitter and leaves a bit of smokiness. Mouthfeel is bubbly and smooth. The beer feels a bit overcarbonated to me. It is tasty and quite drinkable, but not exceptional. If you are a Shiner devotee this might be a nice way to vary your consumption a bit, but I wouldn't recommend seeking it out. I will probably buy it again, but it is not one of my favorites.","Ryanbob","Dec 10, 2007"
4.05,22,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer was a nice find. I was not expecting it to pour so darkly (between the color of a bock and a nut brown ale). The beer poured with a thin head that dissipated quickly into lacing. The smell was good, of wheat, yeast, and sweetness. The taste was pretty darn good, almost tasted like a brown ale mixed with a wheat. I was very surpised at how refreshing this beer was. I will definitely purchase this beer again.","kguyty","Dec 08, 2007"
4.28,28.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a pub glass. Poured a dark cola color with a tan 1-finger head. This beer has a slight wheat smell to it and has the flavor of a pale hefe-wiezen, with a little carbonation. There is a slight wheat and malt smell to it. Overall this is a very drinkable beer.","KodyBrannon","Dec 07, 2007"

2.98,-10.2,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Having always been able to either tolerate or enjoy all of the beers from the Shiner line I picked up this dunkelweizen along with their Schwarzbier awhile back. Pours a ruby brown cranberry hue with a thin off white beige head leaves thin trickled lacing all around my wheat beer glass. Aroma contains mild metallic notes with a muted chocolate and toasted nut with caramel drizzled on the load of fermentable sugars provided from the roasted malts balanced with mild herbal hops almost minty again this is tame with not much yeast fruitiness going on here. Flavor my beloved clove and banana yeast traits are absent, it tastes more like a dunkel lager clean roasty mild chocolate, with caramel malt sweetness and a touch of toasted nut quality with a light dose of herbal finishing hops. Mouthfeel is very thin bodied for a dunkelweizen light to medium bodied range with no effervescence typical of the style standard moderate carbonation here. Drinkability poor lacks the standard challenging and refreshing characteristics typically found in a dunkelweizen.","WVbeergeek","Jul 25, 2007"
3.4,2.4,3,3,3.5,3,4,"This was ok, but maybe a little boring. Nothing really stood out. Not bad, but if you want a really good Shiner beer, try the Shiner 97 Bohemian Black Lager (schwarzbier). That stuff is fine. Not much head and it left quickly. Lacing was minimal. Decent dunkelweizen but nothing to write home about.","biggmike","Jun 25, 2007"
3.75,13,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"What this beer lacks in overall talent, it makes up for in gumption. This is by far Spoetzl's most ambitious (and possibly most talented) brew, and many could do well to follow its example.","McStagger","Jun 25, 2007"

3.15,-5.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Drinkability -- This is an OK beer. Not a dunkelweizen in the traditional sense, or in the sense that I recognize a dunkelweizen. I kept waiting for this beer to "open up" and it never did. Unfortunately, not much for me to come back for.","MUSHROOMCLOUD","May 07, 2007"

3.92,18.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The flavor is not as rich or malty as the nose suggests, but there is a clearly wheat-like character to it; and the traditional Bavarian wheat-yeast characteristics are missing (banana/clove), but they're generally restrained within the dunkle style anyway. It's nicely balanced with a sturdy bitterness beneath; and some spicy and grassy/floral hop character gives it some depth and off-sets the dark cocoa component. It finishes dry with a dusting of cocoa and a smattering of grassy hop flavors.","NeroFiddled","Jan 01, 2007"

The aroma is of slight fruit notes. The mouthfeel is light, but average for the style. The taste is like Shiner bock, but with the addition of a light fruity backdrop.

3.12,-6,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"12 oz. with no freshness date and a blurb about the beer being krausened. It pours a crystal-clear, radiant amber with a good amount of carbonation and a finger of tan head, with an aroma of overripe fruit and molasses. On the palate, it has light carbonation on top of a medium body and tastes of molasses, ripe banana, mild wheat and apple, and spicy hops that leave a mild bitterness and finish. First off, this should be unfiltered, and second, it doesn't taste enough like a wheat beer. They make a pretty decent hefe so I figured this one would be on the same level, but it falls short.","mmmbeer","Apr 28, 2006"

2.98,-10.2,3,2.5,3.5,2,3,"Opinion: This is pretty typical of Spoetzl brewing. It is pretty thin and uneventful with some flavors that are out of balance with the rest of the beer. I have drank numerous DunkelWeiss beers in Bavaria, and this beer comes as close to a DunkelWeizen as their Bock is to a true German Bock. This is a drinkable beer, but I would prefer something with a bit of depth and some real flavor. I won't be drinking this often, I tell you.","SkeeterHawk","Apr 08, 2006"

2.48,-25.3,3,2.5,2,2,3.5,"There were several places where this faltered: 1) hardly any wheat characteristics; 2) filtered (and it doesn't help that Shiner's yeast strain is boring, to begin with); 3) hop bitterness had too much presence. Really this just reminded me of a sub-par Munich dunkel lager.","goochpunch","Beers"

3.25,-2.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"The beer after its extraction from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a deep clear brown, with a portly semi-creamy light tan head that after its dissipation leaves an obfuscating sheet of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet with malt and a hint of toasted wheat, also seems like a little caramel, fresh an pleasing to the senses at any rate, start is somewhat sweet with a fair to middling grain presence, and the top middling in feel.
