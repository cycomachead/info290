3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I wanted to make some sort of blaxploitation reference/joke here, but I just couldn't pull the trigger. Hashtag full disclosure. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear topaz topped by over a finger of wan cream foam. The nose comprises dry wheat, mild orange zest, light pumpernickel, and a pinch of cardamom. The taste brings in more of the same, with the citrus coming through a bit stronger. This is balanced, though, by strong spicy contingent, mostly clove, though with bits of brown sugar and cinnamon in there as well. I also get some rye bread in the finish. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively smooth feel. Overall, a tasty and enjoyable dunkelweizen. 'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","Oct 19, 2012"

Dark and hazy, smooth, mellow taste, without the bitterness you find in some dark beers. This is one of the best dunkel weizens i've tasted. I have a whole rack of twenty different dunkels arriving on Thursday. let's see if this one can stay on top of the heap. worth trying if you can find it!","stevoj","Dec 04, 2011"

3.71,1.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Smells of bananas semi bitter chocolate figs and spices. Very smooth mouthfeel. The taste is chocalatey and spicy with some bananas floating around. It's easy to drink and lighter than most other Dunkeweizen's I've tried. It's a pretty solid wheat beer but not one of my favorites.","cooch69","Feb 21, 2010"
3.21,-11.8,4.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Tasted in mid-April 2010....500 ml with BBE date 30.Sept.2010, into the Franziskaner glass. Pours cloudy chestnut brown body topped by huge, off-white to light tan long lasting head that never sets completely. The aroma profile exhibits strong (for a weizen) melanoidin character, bread crust, caramel and some subdued bananaish sweetness . Apart from the bread crust sensation the beer doesn't smell bready nor gives off intense banana and clove aromas. The taste is melanoidins, wheat, muted tartness, light hoppy bitterness and yeast, lacking banana and clove. Mild carbonation, light-medium albeit somewhat watery body. A good session weizen but not a memorable one.","crnipeter","Nov 22, 2009"

3.13,-14,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"D: Not a bad brew, but not much remarkable about it either. I think I would much rather tackle an above-average hefe than another one of these.

Bits of malt, banana and clove dance slowly together, as mentioned, a lighter brew but still tasty and enjoyable. A decent beer to try, but you can get local dark wheat ales at a much better price - and even tastier.","Vancer","Nov 18, 2008"

3.61,-0.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"M&D: carbonation is a strong point, fresh but not fizzy, on top of a moderate body and relatively soothing flavour profile; all in all, this is not a strictly-speaking ""delicious"" Dunkel Weizen in any sense to me, but a rather harmonious and drinkable version worth revisiting time and again. I wonder if the oxidised-fruit-like sour edge could be milder if served slightly fresher?","wl0307","Oct 12, 2007"
3.11,-14.6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"The bottles on the shelf were fresh at the place I bought this at.

Although it didn't deliever as much as I hoped, it was worth the try.","DoubleJ","Aug 05, 2007"
4.07,11.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours hazy amber. Nice creamy head. Smells of clove/bannana/malt. Taste of clove, bannanas and dark fruit. Finishes with a smooth, shot of alcohol. Ratings on another site are really under rated. This dunkel is a a very good one. Tough to find a crappy beer from these guys!","KI9A","Feb 02, 2007"
3.66,0.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured to a dark brown with medium-thick tan head that lingered well and left decent lacing. Aroma was mild, but wheat, nuts and malt scents were the prominent notes. Mouthfeel was slightly tingly, but the body was slightly on the thin side. However, the flavor followed thru again on the malty sweet wheat side, all leading to a medium duration, pleasant finish.","kimcgolf","Jun 08, 2006"
2.1,-42.3,5,2.5,1.5,2,2,"From a well-chilled half-liter bottle. This poured like a textbook dunkelweizen ... hazy and orange-brown with a solid, stoic head of white foam. I need a flavor identifier to help me pin down this aroma ... wheres the wife when you need her? I dont always want her around when Im breaking out new bottles in my beer room, but this is an exception. Its like a mushy overripe banana or a caramel banana split without the ice cream ... hard to describe. The first swish is incredibly disappointing, I cant tell you. Much more watery than you can imagine. And that same odd essence in the aroma comes thru in the flavor ... cooked banana chips, dark brown sugar, exceptionally sweet.

3.63,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Klosterbrauerei Weltenburg's biggest positive as a brewery is that they don't brew anything that I consider to be average for the style or below. Only the doppelbock and the hefe weizen have been well above average. This dunkel weizen is a passable version that failed to capture my fancy as well as I thought it might. I'm still glad that I had the opportunity to give it a go and might recommend it to those who don't like a strong hefe presence in their hefes.","BuckeyeNation","Apr 25, 2006"

It tasted a bit saucy to me and I'm not sure if i would order another one in the future. weltenburger is not my favorite brewery.","drewmprs","Dec 29, 2005"
3.67,0.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Medium brown shoe polish hue; tan, solid bubble bath head. The nose is yeasty, as the head settles, some caramel and powdery malts are detectable. Simplisticsome sharp light hops, dark roasted malts and yeast like offerings are blended well together. Sweet, watered down caramel malts give way to chocolate and even some banana peel. The finish is bitter, yet a bit sweet. This is pretty enjoyable; always thought this was a tough style to produce. While the flavors are a bit subdued, this one was smooth and enjoyable enough.","GeoffRizzo","Apr 28, 2005"
3.48,-4.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Big 500 mL German bottle with 10.01.02 on the back, which I hope isn't the date - it was new in the store so pretty sure it's not. No weizen glasses available so we used pilsners, which is the closest thing we could find. It pours a cloudy chestnut color with a 2 finger off-white head of dense tiny bubbles that pits when it recedes and leaves good lacing. The aromas are banana, bubblegum, caramel?, medicine?, sweetness, and clove. The body is light and tingly like a lager and is kinda thin with a short finish. It tastes of bananas (banana pudding), clove, metal/spiciness, caramel/toasted malts, and a mild bitterness. The flavors are there but too subdued. Pretty average in my opinion.","mmmbeer","Apr 13, 2005"

2.97,-18.4,4,2,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with this brew. I was hoping that a brewery around since 1050 A.D. (it said so on the label) would have cracked the code for a top-notch dunkelweiss. Too bad this beer fell short.","Boilermaker88","Beers"
3.3,-9.3,4,4,3,3,3,"Pours a hazy brown color with a nice big dark tan head that slowly subsides.  Sweet chocolatey notes with some very light fruit scents in the aroma.  Nice opening chocolate flavors that soon begin to feel a little watered down.  Definitely a little dissappointing since I've tried others that were very full flavored from this brewery.  Just very thing and watery with no real yeast flavors and no wheaty graininess either.  Thin and not nearly as full in the mouth as it should be, again, dissappointing.  I could drink this beer but I'm not sure why I would want, there are some many better tasting dunkel weizens out there.","Murph","0"
