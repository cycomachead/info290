Pours a very attractive darker amber with garnet hints. And a lovely smooth creamy tan head. Can get peaches right enough in the aroma. They tend to dominate. Only later do the nuts and caramel arrive. Taste is rather thinner than expected..but its nice enough..again getting lot of peach, some spicy peppery stuff and a bit of nuttiness. Fine. KInda thin mouth feel but its got nice tight carbonation..that helps. Nice fruity beer","Reidrover","Mar 17, 2015"

Pours a clear sienna with a fairly thick buff head. Peach dominates the flavor, but does not overwhelm the malty, nutty, earthy and hoppy notes - hop bitterness nicely balances the sweetness from the peaches.

Flavor has the malty taste and a hint of fresh peaches. Decent mouthfeel. Goes down well and leaves a little pecan flavor at the end. Getting a little of that weird dry feeling that you sometimes get when eating fresh pecans, maybe its just me. Overall, pretty well balanced and a nice change from the overly dry spiced beers that are abundant around the holidays !","hophugger","Nov 17, 2014"

This is 'brewed with peaches and pecans and with natural flavor and caramel color'. Love the aroma when first opened and poured as the peaches and caramel hits the nose. Nice taste of peaches with wheat flavor with spices that goes down easy. Slight sweet aftertaste that isn't bitter. One of the better Shiner's in my opinion.","BeerWithMike","Feb 13, 2014"
3.67,3.1,4.25,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear dark ruby amber with a well formed head that laces well. Said lacing lasts only a few minutes, however. Nose is of peach over a slight caramel. Light bodied with a thin mouthfeel. Slightly above normal carbonation level. The flavor profile is not complex. Like the nose, it is peach predominating over a light caramel. The beginning is a nice peach which effervesces into an ending that has pecan, but you have to really search for it. The finish is a lingering taste of peach that is OK, at best.","tillmac62","Feb 13, 2014"

Pours almost crystal clear deep ruby brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big peach, caramel, toffee, brown bread, wheat, floral, light banana, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with big peach presence and moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big peach, banana, caramel, toffee, brown bread, wheat, clove, pepper, floral, light nuttiness, and herbal earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, banana, caramel, toffee, brown bread, wheat, clove, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of peach, yeast, and malt flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice fruited dunkelweizen. Good balance and robustness of fruit, malt, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2014"

We were then better able to appreciate the nuances of the fruity inclusions, and the inherent spiciness of the grain bill. These lent to each other well, for a balanced, blended experience. We felt much the same way about the flavoring, with fair representation from each corner. This is really what being a Christmas beer should be all about, with richness, depth, warmth, and a touch of fun. All of this, actually, might make it harder for one to indulge all by themselves, as at points we wished we had smaller pours, but that just lends itself to the spirit of the holiday, so go find someone to share this tasty beer with.","TheBrewo","Dec 07, 2013"

The pour began to foam up pretty quickly, so I backed off and let the pseudo-cascade do its thing before settling into two fingers of dense, light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with mahogany highlights (SRM = > 22, < 27) and NE-quality clarity. Man, but the nose was just redolent with peaches! Peachy keen, I say. I may run out and get a Tastykake Peach Pie after this. Mouthfeel was soft, kind of full and creamy and the taste was heavy on the peaches, but with a nuttiness, also. Finish was fruity, nutty, semi-sweet, but not over the top. Man, I could drink this year-'round!","woodychandler","Dec 06, 2013"

The roasted nuttiness wasn't as strong as I would have liked but had it been, this would have felt like a Brown Ale. As it was, this was enjoyable on its own even though it paled in comparison to its more highly-rated European counterparts. Some may feel like this is a lighter version of the Shiner Bock but for the holidays, this would be a good choice as a lighter alternative to what's currently on the shelf.","JerzDevl2000","Dec 04, 2013"

3.31,-7,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this beer was just ok and I didn't think it was a good example of a Dunkelweizen since none of the aspects that I look for in the style came through, if they were there they were pretty much covered up by the creamy peach flavors and with how much the peach flavors stick out I think this would be better classified as a Fruit Beer. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth and not filling, but the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention and I think one is enough for me, I don't really have the urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, I thought they were both nice and worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the how dominating the creamy peach flavors were, they weren't bad, but I thought they were too overpowering. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I'm glad I tried it but I wouldn't seek it out and I don't think I would really recommend it unless you really like Peach flavored beers. All in all I was a little let down with this beer, Shiner is usually pretty solid, but this beer seemed a little too unbalanced and artificial for my taste. Better luck next time guys, this one could use a little bit of work.","StoutHunter","Nov 23, 2013"

It's an interesting Texan take on a holiday beer and is a lot easier to drink than some of the other holiday beers in the heavier styles such as winter warmers. There seemed to be a good balance between the peaches and pecans/spices because the beer wasn't overly sweet.","metter98","Nov 23, 2013"

But when it comes to the taste there is not much peach or pecan taste at all. Tastes like a regular semi dark beer. I'm very disappointed in the taste. Not sure how a peach/pecan inspired beer has anything to do with Christmas. I think this would better be marketed as a summer type beer with the peach thing. Anyways if you like the smell of peaches this thing delivers. If you are looking for a peach and pecan tasting beer forget this one.

Sweet peach juice up front rolls into other dark fruits along the mid-palate and some weizen flare, creamy body but not too heavy, prickly carbonation. Just enough bitterness on the back end with a big roasted malt and toasted bread flavor to balance the sweetness. Toasty flavors linger on the palate. It does finish a little soapy however with what feels like a bit of alcohol heat which is strange for such a flavorful beer at a low abv. but overall it is definitely something different for the holidays. I wouldn't call it a dunkelweizen however it is a very unique take on a fruit beer that combines some other interesting traits from other styles.

This is more of a 1 and done kind of beer which is really unfitting considering how low of an ABV it has. Still, kudos on your creativity shiner and making a beer that slightly stands out from the rest during the holiday season.","Zachtheporter","Feb 24, 2013"

The taste comes really hard with the peaches too. There's a bit of nuttiness and just a tiny amount of spices on the finish, but otherwise this is a one-note peach fest. Unique enough and pretty tasty. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and lightly carbonated. Overall, Shiner Cheer is a solid and unique winter beer. However, stay far, far away if the idea of a primarily peach flavored beer doesn't tickle your fancy.","shand","Jan 06, 2013"

4.13,16,3,5,4,3.5,4,"This poured out as a clear reddish brown color with an off white head on top. The retention is thin and there isn't any lacing. The smell of the beer to me was really impressive. I poured out and was overwhelmed by the peach in it. The smell is sweet like candy and won't appeal to most beer lovers out there. The taste is also sweet, again with peaches I wish the nuts came out a little more. The mouthfeel is very drinkable and easy going. Not bitter at all or cloying. Overall despite it's ""artificial"" aromas and flavors that it more than likely has... it's still a really good tasting beer in my opinion. I would prefer it if it wasn't artificial at all and all natural but either way I enjoy this beer. I feel it's a bit too clear to be a traditional Dunkelweizen as well. All in all I would drink this beer again though.","Knapp85","Dec 24, 2012"

Shiner doesn't mislabel it as they explicitly state that it is brewed with peaches and pecans. It has a very light character and high carbonation, with ripe fruit really being the dominant character. The aftertaste is a bit odd. Very dry, but not entirely unpleasant. This is a fantastic beverage if you are in the mood for something fruity and not for a traditional beer. I can't say that enough.

It's overbearingly sweet, and peachy. The mouthfeel is smooth, perhaps a tad watery. Overall, this is a weird one. It's just too sweet! And peachy!

Upon my first sip I was sad that I ordered this one, the fruitiness and sweet hit you all at once. Not much else going on except some wheat toward the end. The beer is smooth, light mouthfeel, mostly thin. Overall I would recommend against this beer, the flavor got to me only a few sips in.

A lot of pecan as well, maybe too much as it ain't playing nicely with the peaches and may be what is contributing to the funk. Also a bit of caramel malt. Good strength. Flavor is also loaded with the funky peach taste, particularly on the finish, pecans, good caramel malt backbone, bready, rather sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily becoming sticky, medium carbonation. Not my cup of tea. I know they use real peaches and pecans but can't help but feel that those may be boosted by some artificial flavorings as well.

The flavors are considerably more simple than the nose, with most of the spice coming together to taste something like gingerbread. Raspberry/cranberry flavors are also quite prominent.

The taste is not too strong, with a slightly wheaty finish precluded by light hoppy bite. Feels a bit to fizzy, I could have gone for a slightly greater viscosity with less fizzy carbonation.

3.33,-6.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"A tad tardy for ""holiday cheer", strictly speaking, but who's counting? It pours a clear amber garnet topped by a somewhat short-lived finger of tan foam. The nose comprises cranberry sauce, maple syrup, peaches, brown sugar, sweet flowers, and a touch of miscellaneous grains. The taste brings some darker wheat to the table, along with the advertised pecans in some decent abundance. Meanwhile, the rest of the smell's constituency returns, the fruit (and I'm including the cranberries in this group) clashing with the pecans in a strange and not altogether good or bad way. A toasted biscuit factor is introduced as well, adding to the already cluttered complexity. As far as the flavors go, the sum of the parts suffers from too many disparate parts that don't quite synergize all that well together (some do with others, but it's clear the office is not moving forward in a unified manner). The body is a nice medium, with a light carbonation and a decently smooth and easy-going feel. Overall, a good idea on paper didn't translate too well in practice, but, given the circumstances, things could have gone much, much worse.","TMoney2591","Aug 01, 2010"

It's not so much that the peach flavor is all that bad, in fact it's one of the more natural-tasting fruit flavors in a fruit beer that I've tried, but it's just extremely peachy, like someone mixed peach preserves and beer. The smell is particularly peachy, literally rather than figuratively. The flavor is like a cross between a strawberry soda, a light possibly decent dunkelweizen and a giant bowl of peaches (and a trace of bile - but I hate a lot of sweet fruit beers). I've never really associated peaches with the holiday season, so it leaves me a bit confused. Maybe, it's a Texas thing. Also, if anyone can taste pecan in this beer, my hat is off to you.

3.87,8.7,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Normally I'm not a fan of fruit beers, but this one was really enjoyable, surprisingly so actually. When I first smelled the beer and the sweetness to it, I figured it would be like drinking fruit juice mixed with beer. It was nothing like that. I found this rather enjoyable to drink.","Contagion","Dec 18, 2008"

3.87,8.7,3,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: Very high thanks to the bubbles, and they help remove the stickiness typically left from a beer like this. I really enjoy the taste. Despite the peaches seeming more like a summer fruit, I think this is an excellent accompaniment to holiday celebrations.","kels","Dec 12, 2008"

3.23,-9.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D- Very smooth texture, but the sweetness and peach flavor are quite out of balance. Probably couldn't drink more than two at a time. Would go really well with desert however.","fctoaster","Dec 11, 2008"
3.53,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some peach, toffee.

After drinking the whole beer, I'm still not exactly sure if I like it or not. There are good and bad aspects to this beer. That said, I'm glad I have a six pack to re-evaluate at my leisure.","blakesell","Dec 06, 2008"

3.64,2.2,3,4,3.5,3,4,"A very drinkable holiday beer, and a nice change of pace from the heavier ""barley-based"" beers of winter. I would have liked to have seen a bit more spice in the beer and just a bit less carbonation. Having said that, though, this beer exceeded my expectations quite a bit.","beerphilosopher","Dec 01, 2008"
3.28,-7.9,3,2.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a clear dark brown-reddish color body. Big cream colored head, somewhat diminishing. Strong aroma of peaches, some dark malts. Almost like an acidic aroma. Peachy, pecany taste, medium body. Tasty, peachy aftertaste. Nice grainy taste, maybe wheat or something. Nice fruity taste from the peaches. Somewhat carbonated.","jujubeast6000","Nov 29, 2008"

Pours a dark brown-ruby colour .. stable head, covers the top like a blanket .. dark semi-sweet malt and lots of peach, fresh and burnt, nice! ... very drinkable, with just a touch of bitterness on the finish... thank god, this beer is actually really nice! .. a great beer for the weird texas winter?","Onslow","Nov 16, 2008"

3.35,-5.9,4.5,2,3.5,4,4,"Verdict: Between this and Shiner Dunkelweizen, it's no contest: Holiday Cheer just doesn't measure up. But that's not a fair way to rate the beer. Viewed objectively, this is a nice middle-of-the-road Dunkelweizen with an interesting splash of Peach. It fits well into Shiner's portfolio of beers stuck in a bizarre purgatory between macro and micro. I'm still not sure what peach has to do with Christmas, but I'm willing to look past that here.","BeanBone","Nov 14, 2008"
3.72,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D) Flavorful, festive, not a bad beer and I'm glad I got the 6'er. High marks for creativity, but I would like to see the peach dialed down a mark or three.","HardTarget","Nov 12, 2008"

4.42,24.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - Great flavor, low alcohol, and smooth drinkability makes this a very holiday sessionable ale. With that said, its almost impossible to view this as a dunkelweizen.
