3.91,10.1,4.25,3.75,4,3.5,4,"Huge lingering beige head. Translucent cloudy brownish in color. Fine lacing as head diminishes. Some soapy qualities in head. Roasted malt and banana nose. Tasting cloves, coriander as well as some banana nut bread. Very creamy, lightly lingering carbonation and somewhat viscous in mouth feel. Leaves some acidity and drying sensation on my tongue. Overall, well balanced and not overly wheated. I admire many of Bayern's brews and applaud their adherence to the German purity law. I highly recommend this beer to followers of this style.","sporklift87","Feb 23, 2015"

Dragon's Breath is reminiscent of that beer - deep and rich in colour, slightly sweet nose, plenty of toasty malt flavour. I will freely admit that it's New Years and my taste buds may be somewhat dulled, so I will keep it short and sweet. Good beer - I'm looking forward to trying one with a clean palate tomorrow!","Bunman3","Dec 31, 2014"

Earthy, malty nose with hints of brown bread, subtle dark fruit, toffee, and a some metalic/mineral notes as well. The taste follows suit with lots of earthy, bready malts up front along with hints of molasses, brown bread, toffee, dark fruit, and a touch of banana. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and subtly creamy with good balance and drinkability. Overall, while this is not the dark Weizen I'm used to here in Germany, it's still a solid offering.","beerdrifter","May 11, 2014"

The alcohol is very well hidden, it's very flavorful and rich, yet it's also a very smooth and light on the palate. Now I can understand how this was brewed in Bavaria and won awards so many awards! I highly recommend this!","ChrisCage","Jun 02, 2013"

3.67,3.4,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a dark red amber with a thin off-white head that dissipates to a thin film and ring around the glass. Light aroma of toasted and caramel malt, dark fruit, wheat. Flavor follows with toasted and sweet malt, cloves, wheat and a hint of grassy hops. Light to medium bodied. Subdued, but very pleasant malt and wheat flavors, well integrated. As another reviewer noted, a nice light weizen beer, but the ""Dragon's Breath"" seems to indicate something a little more dangerous. A pleasant, low-key dunkelweizen.","LiquidAmber","Feb 16, 2013"

3.51,-1.1,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"not sure why a german style dark wheat beer thats under 6% abv is called dragons breath, with flames all over the label, kind of gimmicky or misleading or something, but nevertheless, the beer isnt all that bad. i can see a thick layer of yeast or bottling sugar on the bottom of the bottle, but a careful pour yields a slightly murky dark brown thin liquid with a half inch of head that fades instantly. the nose is not real german yeasty at all, nor german malty really, more american medium roast barley, somewhere between a porter and a black ale in that regard, with some doughy yeast and a lightness not explained by the color. the taste is rather generic, and off the mark a bit for the style theyre calling it, but its a drinkable dark brew. yeast forward, but nothing too interesting. nice roast on the malt, slight chocolate note and a tad sweet at the end, still clean in the finish and easy to drink a fair few of these. i didnt love this one, but it served its purpose as the only non gold craft beer i could find at a town pump servo in colstrip, montana. wont seek this out again, but it didnt offend me by any means, and at under 8 bucks a 6 pack, i cant really complain...","StonedTrippin","Jan 21, 2013"

I have tried many good hefeweizen's in my day and this beer has a great heff flavor that hits you immediately, but there is much more to this beer than this first flavor lets on. After the first fairly normal, but good, hefeweizen flavor a darker malty taste starts to take over and blend with the wheat-like heff. This darker tone blends into the first flavor in a very bold way to give this beer a distinct, rare and bold taste. Dragon's Breath is definitely worth giving a try. I probably couldn't drink it on a regular basis but it is a solid beer that would be great every once in a while.","ShwarzAl3r","Nov 14, 2011"

3.23,-9,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a murky, dark brown color with a large head that had good retention. Very little lacing is left on the glass. The yeast gave this beer a spicy note rather than a banana, bubblegum one. A little bit of dark wheat bread aroma but otherwise the smell is muted. The flavor also is a bit weak. The yeast does not add much to the flavor. Almost like it was brewed with an ale yeast. Some wheaty malt and a touch of spice and that is about all that there is in the flavor. Not bad but far from great. The body is alright but feels a bit watery. Nicely carbonated. Just a weak tasting wheat beer in the end. It drinks alright but why bother when there are far better ones in the market.","morimech","Jan 16, 2011"

It's not a bad dunkelweizen, but the flavors all around are a bit muted compared to other examples in the style like Franziskaner Dunkel. There's a bit of dark bread with spicy phenols. It's smooth and drinkable, but the whole character just isn't there.","tempest","Nov 27, 2010"
