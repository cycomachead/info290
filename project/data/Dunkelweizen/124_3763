In my experience though, when a brewery offers both a weizen and a dunkelweizen, the latter tends to be smoother and rounder. With that in mind, Paulaner's is quite enjoyable. The yeasty tartness is rather prominent but backed up well enough by the other elements not to ruin the experience.","The_Mad_Capper","Sep 27, 2014"

The beer looked like rust coloured gravy with coagulated whipped egg on top. I didn't wanna do it mom but I had no other choice. It smelled totally generic for the style. Also of spoilt dough wafting with spent yeast. Tasted just like the other four I'd had. Sweet - sour, fizzy, caramelite - not bad mom but just that I wanted it no more. I like Paulaner beers mom, but it was the right thing at the wrong time. I'm sorry mom, but I will wean off wheat for a while and come back again.

It pours in a nice amber color with 1-2 fingers of foam, and smells like dark bread. The first taste is of sweet bread with a bitter aftertaste.

I enjoy the malts and the way they are balanced; the darker malts take off from the beers refreshing aspect but maybe add some complexity to the brew.
