"Probably my favorite beer.  Exceptionally good for a beer with 10+% alcohol."
"Deceptive, but tasty.  Doesnt have a tripel profile that im used to.  Dark and chocolate notes.  Alcohol content is well hidden.  Surprised this is a mckinney local.  Would drink again."

"A very tasty very strong lager. Black in color and about 10% alcohol."

"Dangerous. Very drinkable with medium mouth feel. Alcohol is well hidden. Dark and smooth. Very nice, Franconia!"

"Not complex, and could use a bit more carbonation as it all but vanishes by the time I'm 2/3rds of the way through my pint.. the alcohol is more hidden than I expected, the beer screams dark and German, and it's balanced in flavor. I like what I like about it."
