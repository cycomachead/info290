"Very crisp and satisfying but with a rather straightforward flavor for the style. It's not at all bad, but it could benefit from greater sweetness, a more notable malt presence, and softer carbonation."

"A surprisingly light dunkelwiezen. Much more gulpable than the pale one."

"500ml bottle. Wide lager glass. Dark brown color, chill hazeappearance. White froth creates a close, thick & lasting crown. Some spots are left. Roasted, lager yeast & flowery aromas rounded by bread & subtle banana notes. Malty, sweet & roasted upfront. Medium body. Soft carbonation. Creamy & dense texture. Low bitterness & slight spicy touch. Long sweet finish. Estery & kind nutty aftertaste. A flavorful beer & nice spot of the Style."

"I was thinking about going with 3.75s for the taste, feel, and overall rating, but this is an excellent beer for *me* if I want something of the style. Silky feel on it, pleasant lingering slightly spicy and tangy banana biscuit aftertaste... this is some good stuff. My first from Hofbrau, and it won't be my last."
"Serving type: bottle (which is not good because usual)"

"My profile pics from the Hofbrauhaus in Munich and I was pretty happy to have this little memory show up on the shelf here in Alberta"

"An adequately enjoyable dunkelweizen, the lack of expected roasted notes, while a concern at first, fades from worry rather quickly, leaving us with a nice fruity quaff, suitable for summertime excursions, and early spring snow days alike."

"The quaffable quality is so good, worthy Dunkelweizen."
"o: a really nice dunkelweizen at a good price. perhaps the taste let me down a bit after such a great aroma, and there is a bit of a metallic finish."

"O - Nothing fantastic and there are much better examples of the style."

"O: Very drinkable beer. Creamy and pleasant"

"Flavor is again on par with the style guidelines but in terms of the mouthfeel it's a let-down. Too thin and metallic, not enough good bubbles and the ones present are a little abrasive. Drinkable and decent, but the overall attenuation is off and it takes away from drinking this style."
"This beer is highly enjoyable, being a bit sweeter and more complex than its lighter sister. Hofbräu nailed the style... because they probably invented it."
"D It is certainly an easy drinking beer, interchageable with the hefe, so far the best Hofbrau beer I've tasted and will be my choice when I visit HB until its gone. 4    "
"D- You could drink this all day"
"Taken while watching the first game of Mexico at the world cup, dark wheat beer, one of my favorite styles, served in a weizen-bayern glass. Look: brown-chocolate color, fat foamy head, bad lacing. Smell: Roasted malts with chocolate and biscuity malts, some wheat too. Taste: Roasted malts, similar to the smell but with spicy hops and more wheat. Mouthfeel: Clean, high bitterness, medium body and high carbonation. Drinkability: too much wheat, it's good but has nothing to do against the great erdinger dunkel weissbier."
"M: Refreshing at the beginning then the bitterness and sourness that last good enough with a some sticky feeling in the mouth."
"T: Very easy to drink, their flavors are subtle, making it lighter, the acidity is what most stands out, did little to end widespread."
"Pours light brown/copper cloudy beer with dense head. Yeast, clove, sweet malt in aroma. Taste - expressive, sweet malt, wheat, tints of caramel and banana, light hop finish. A bit harsh aftertaste, it seems not similar to classic dunkelweizen, but pleasant in common."
"500 ml. bottle. Pours a big head, that doesn' t last much, leaving some lace. Colour is not really black, as the name suggests, is more brown reddish. Aroma of sulphur, yeast, ripe fruits, dates or prunes, clove. Good mouthfeel, with the sulphur flavour, taste of banana, fruits, hints of caramel. If I have to say something bad i tcould be about the not so strong body, but I could have some more of this."
"Overall: nice dunkel weizen. Pleasant taste and great mouthfeel. Could use more hops and I missed a stronger banana presence."
"From a half-liter bottle, this beer pours a dark chestnut color with a thick, dense head. The foam is a light shade of tan, and all-in-all, the beer is quite attractive. The aroma clearly has a wheat character, backed by a little caramel and toasted grain. Not bad. The taste is a little drier than expected, but presents a nice wheat twang. There's a little spice and some roastedness in in the flavor was well. Medium in body, with a sharp (slightly acidic) bite in the finish, this is a very engaging and drinkable beer. Enjoyable and worth having again."
"I had this on tap at the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, presented in a 0.5L weisse glass. It was a dark copper color, very hazy, with a light tan (almost white) foam on top that lasted half-way through the session. The aroma was correct in my opinion, bananas and cloves all the way. This translated to the taste as well, nice estery flavors from the yeast and good solid mouthfeel, not thick per se but it coated the mouth very well. Solid and drinkable, I liked this best from the Hofbrauhaus. But I'm partial to weizenbocks and dunkel weisse beers."
"This is one of the finest Dark Wheat beers I have tasted, although I am far from an expert on the style."
"Final notes: a really nice option to the style, it has its own personality, a really nice beer."
"Good and thirst quenching beer, after all, even if I'd like it a little less sweet."
"(500 ml bottle, bought in Norway.) Pours with the typical large & lingering weissbier head, colour of the beer is brown, not black as the name suggests. Slightly hazy. Pleasant aroma of fresh baked bread and weissbier yeast, hints of dark syrup and caramel. Flavour has a slight roastiness and some farmhouse bread character, smooth and pleasant to drink, but not very complex. Just enough hops to leave a pleasant aftertaste, but like most weissbiers the aftertaste does not last ""forever"". This is a decent but unpretentious beer, a nice accompaniment with a meal or as a refreshment on its own."
"This is an interesting seasonal from Hofbrauhaus (they called it a ""DarkWeiz""). Cloudy orange color with a thin off-white head. Aroma is a little fruity and a little wheaty. I am not that familiar with the DunkelWeizen style but the flavor was a mixture of malt, cider, banana and caramel. Smooth and mostly drinkable but lopsided. I would go back to the Dunkel next time."
