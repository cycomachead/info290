"Interesting beer. I’d definitely have another of these."

"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a slightly hazy, medium-dark mahogany amber with a fine three finger off-white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of mildy sweet caramel malt, wheat, clove, light cola, spicy. Flavor of mild wheat, hints of caramel, nuts, toasted malt; finishes dry and bland with residual light wheat and clove. Light bodied. A nice smelling, but ultimately underwhelming weizen beer. Really quite a nice presention, and the flavor is fine, but it is very mild and unassuming. Meh."

"Overall, a disappointing beer. Overly sweet, yet bitter, which is off putting. Would not buy this beer again, not my preference. But I would encourage everyone to try it"

"O: This beer was quite fruity and yeasty and felt like it could have had more complexity in the taste and a bit more fullness in the body."

"0.5l swing-top bottle. Pours murky brown beer with bubbly tan head, transforming into 2-finger foam in a few minutes. Relatively poor aroma: biscuits, raisin, banana. Actually watery taste as if sterling weizen was diluted, apple tartness, metallic tones, dull undertones. Inconsistent low carbonation, mild body. Disappointing experience."

"This was an avearage dunkel that I truly wanted to rate higher yet I just couldn't do it. Someone out there might just love it but alasnot me. There are so many better choices. I bet it tastes great in Germany. That's what I also want to think...and I'm sticking with it."
"Moosbacher Schwarze Weisse Dark is not a bad beer by any means, however, falls short of the better and richer German and American dunkelweizens."

"Overall: The label wasn't notched, so I don't know anything about the age of the beer; I have had this beer twice now and in both cases there were flaws, though not the same flaws; this review is a composite of both tastes but doesn't really capture either as the tart example didn't have the right fruity tones and the one that tasted like a hefe was very flabby"
"Notched 2/11. Poured into a weizen glass. Opened with a loud pop, and initially poured solid foam. After resting poured better. Poured a medium brown color with a thick foamy head. Head lasted a few moments, but as quickly replenished by massive carbonation rising from the bottom. Once the bubbles stopped, the head disappeared quickly. Smelled slightly sour, with a bit of fruity spice. Taste was a gentle banana bread, with a bit of pepper finish. Felt overly thin in the mouth, coated towards the back of the mouth slightly. Carbonation just felt funny on the tongue. Overall not bad, but seemed a bit bland."

"O - Not bad. Very interesting flavor."

"This beer is a murky, chocolate-milk colored brown. Muddy, yeasty, and sporting a towering head, the beer is nicely attractive. The aroma is full of the usual twangy, wheat character and citric smell of a weisse. Lots of yeast, a touch of pale malt. Still, it's not particularly interesting...average at best. The taste is a bit more spritzy and citric, with a little pepper, spice, and light roasted notes underneath. Nice. Spritzy and enjoyable mouthfeel."
"An initial smoothness rides together with a crisp nip up front. It's pretty thin, though not heinously so. There's enough going on that it's interesting, but not particularly so."
"O: Overall this was an alright beer, but not spectacular. With these imports it can be hit or miss, and is never a really good judgement of what the beer really tastes like. I probably wouldn't pick this one up again."
"D- 3.5 Not a bad brew by any means, but not all that exciting either. I'm a fan of dark wheats, so I had my hopes up for this one. It has some good things going on but isn't very complex. It's light and would be easy enough to drink a few, though I don't see myself wanting more than the big single."
"All in all, a very drinkable, quality experience. The brew is quite mirky looking and the lacing peels right down the glass (does not stick)."
"Tasting it: Clean and even malty mouthfeel. Flavors of cocoa and nuts. Minor hops. Smooth wheat character comes through, very scrumptious."
"Ranks as a top 5 in my Dunkelweizen list."
"Pours a clear golden brown with a fairly thick pale tan head that hangs around for a little. Aroma is malty with a strong overtone of fruit, mainly apple, and a hint of spice. Flavor is malty and a little fruity, not very well rounded but still acceptable. Texture is quite fizzy, just a bit on the watery side, but it leaves behind a decent tingle. Overall, not too shabby."
"500ml swing top bottle ""Schwarze Weisse"".From Capital Market, Salem.$3.49 Huge POP when the swing top is opened!!! HUge white head is released into my glass..rakes a while for it to calm down..not a good sign! When i can actually now see the beer its a redish amber colur..head is large and thickly frothy. Aroma is actually OK Bready, spicy yeasts,some barnyard and orange! Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma..kinda ends very abruptly though. Ok on the palate i actually liked the carbonation..very refeshing. Overall not great but certainlly not bad."
"a touch unique for the style and I really liked it. would not mind doing this one again any day."
"It has a nice vanilla taste to it. I'm getting a little bit of Banana as well. Lite toasted malts. little to no hop taste. It is very pleasant to drink."
"Pours a shade of brown with an off-white head of about 1""that slowly dissipates. Smells malty/wheaty and a little of clove. Taste was pretty easy going but likeable. A slightly more potent taste wouldn't be a terrible thing. Has a fairly typical dunkel taste, just a little light. As others mentioned, it had a sort of tobacco aftertaste which really intrigued me, it is certainly different from other dunkels I have tasted. Mouthfeel is light with light carbonation. Overall this is an intriguing take on the dunkel style, but it could use a little more in the flavor department."
"D: Very drinkable. Well crafted, and it seems effortless in it's delivery. Not something that is a ""wow"" but something that is enjoyable, and solidly made."
"Sinkability - I really enjoyed their Helles Lager but this completely missed the mark."
"Notes: The mouthfeel changes noticeably if the yeast pellet is agitated. While some may find the tobacco-y after taste off-putting, I enjoyed it as the memory of a good cigar. (And luckily, the flavor doesn't last that long.) This is probably one of my favorite beers, even if it has a milder body than the classification would suggest. The simple complexity is nice."
"Pours a dark red amber. So much rocky head it's almost unbelievable. Huge amounts of lacing and decent carbonation. Only faint aromas, though. Some mint, a hint of lavendar, tiny bit of vanilla. Not much else...maybe a tiny bit of bubblegum in there. Unique so far. Weird flavor. Very thin, unfortunately. There's some of the aforementioned bubblegum notes in there. Very easy drinking. Too easy-drinking if you ask me. No big hop or malt characteristics at all. Kind of like a lite dark beer. I don't like this, but you could probably session it all day as it's mostly water. Don't bother with this folks, even though it's relatively cheap. You get what you pay for."
" D- The fizz really oppresses the flavors and there isn't much depth to it but it does have some of the classic hefe characters underneath."
"The beer pours an amber color with a huge white head. The aroma is a lot of toffee and caramel malts with some wheat, orange and earthy hops characteristics. The flavor is wheat with a lot of toffee. I also get some citrus. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Sharp effervescence, medium heavy body, slightly warming. A very good beer indeed once the head drops."
"If a fresher sample tastes better than this one, would be a nice, drinkable beer. Only 5% ABV and no rough edges to the flavor profile."
"Pouring this into a glass, I thought I had grabbed a coke by mistake. Body looks like a hazy cola and the head is very fizzy. Definitely get your standard banana and clove off the nose, along with faint nutmeg and bread undertones. Lots of banana and hearty spice qualities on the palate with a faint caramel and light tartness up front. The fizz of the carbonation is pretty overwhelming here and settles down to a very slight body. Overall, this one lacks the depth of flavors that is somewhat common to the style accompanied by a very thin mouthfeel."
"D - Very cleanly made beer with no flaws, but also very little flavor. Yhere just is not much going on. The big flaw is the fizzy carbonation that gets in the way of the delicate flavors."
"Not bad but certainly uninspiring and I've had better examples of the style. I assume it would taste better on tap."
"As mentioned, I'd had it's sister beer (the Weissbier) and have to say I much preferred that one. This schwarze weisse just didn't cut it."
"Drinkability: Even though I rated this brew as average, I don't think I want to drink a second sample."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is on the thin side, a bit watery. The drinkability is about average, not the best, but not at all hard to get down."
"Pours a cloudy medium brown with lots of haze visible as I hold the glass near a light. Very little head that dissapears quickly. The beer tastes slightly of wheat malt with some caramel like character. The flavor is very straight forward. Just malted wheat with very little hop presence or any other flavors."
"I'm also not sure why Moosbacher gets such low ratings on this website. Both the offerings I've had from them were tasty, and at a good price for German imports."
"Flavor is a little better after it sits for a little while. Papery and oxidized somewhat, thin and bland. Something vaguely like apple cider and nutmeg. Aftertaste is dull and flaccid. The hollowness makes me think it's past it's prime, though the label says it has 6 months on it. The body is ok, it feels like a weizen, just without any flavor. Slowly working on finishing this, but wouldn't drink it again."
"Beer has a slight harshness to it. There is a flavor of roast there, subtle. There isn't much bitterness. This beer is wet, not dry, interesting, but not my favorite dunkel, not by a long shot. Drinkability is moderate but its still sessionable. I don't think I would order it again but it may be an important stop on the dunkelweiss journey."
"I think they are on to something with this beer, but it is the characteristics of the brewery to under-malt their beers. Though clean, crisp, and refreshing; the lack of meaningful maltiness leaves the beer wonderless."
"Definitely more so in the dunkel weisse vein than a new style called a Schwarze Weisse. No where near black in appearance a slightly clouded amber chestnut brown with a bright white head forming thick with soft carbonation rolling with tightly packed bubbles. Lacing fares well and sticks on the edges of the glass in sporadic patterns. Aroma has a slight nutty tobacco herbal quality with fruity banan bread notes as well slightly spicy with clove and some extra estery goodness follows. Flavor wise this one deals slightly sour tart edge with the banana and clove mild roasty and nutty finish a pretty nice mix and definitely easy drinkin' version of the style. Mouthfeel is light bodied especially for a darker weisse beer, but carbonation is soft and delicate yet carries the beer extremely well. Drinkability overall is pretty effortless and carefree the only thing slowing down my consumption of this version of the style would be the price per bottle compared to buying a case of Franzy or Paulaner examples. Solid and refreshing beer that I'm sure I'll try out again in the future."
"Pours a dark brown, opaque body with thick, fluffy head that fills the Schneider Weizen Edle-Weisse glass (and then some)...malt and yeast esters float clove, banana and vanilla--quite a tantalizing combination, clear and crisp... thin, slightly effervescent in the mouth; the weakness may be in due part to its age (drink by 12/07?)... smooth with only a bit of back bite... the sightest sediment tickles with a soft acidic presence... the malt and yeast explosion simmers quickly, and what promises by look and smell to be a strong, thirst-quenching palate pleasure turns out only half right: smooth and easy drinking, yes, but the weight that would be the dunkel seems to have been misplaced..."
"Drinkability- It is lighter and easier to drink. This beer goes down easily but seems to stay on the lighter side of carbonation and body."
"Got this bottle at Sam's in Chicago. Bottle had a great little pop when I opened it. Poured with a big light tan foamy, frothy head and some lace. Light typical Bavarian Weisse nose. Flavor was the same but maltier and wheaty. Also a little metallic flavor. Body is good, full with good carbonation. Color is a brownish dark amber. Ok beer, I guess. Had many better dark weisses. Finish is ok. Could be a session if you can get around the metallic thing."
"The beer is very easy to drink with no hop or booze presence. A solid beer that is at best enjoyable, but not excellent."
"The taste is quite light. There is a dark, sweet lagery wheatiness to the beer. This is well carbonated with plenty of yeastiness that keeps this to more of a sipping type of experience. Sweet caramels, sweet malts, some slightly off mustiness in there as well. There is a candy fruitiness underneath the beer. It is an okay beer but I was hoping for more."
"Overall, bland and uninspired."
"A very watered down Dunkel, I would skip this in the future."
"Interesting beer, nothing grand regarding a dunkel weizen. Acidic aroma slightly sour, a touch of wheat and some mild fruitiness. Real light brown pour, huge fizzy head that settles, not much lacing to speak of. Mouthfeel is light, finish is weak. Flavor is very similar to their Hefeweizen, sour fruit and applesauce. I enjoyed the regular hefe much more than this."
"Schwarze Weisse. Dark muddy brownish pour,with some yeast sediment,huge foamy head. Aroma of caramel,banana,pepper,and yeast. Flavor is yeasty,bready,mild banana,maybe corriander,a little spicy.Mouthfeel is ok but a little too much carbonation,kind of a thin body,crisp finish. Not the best brew in the world but was drinkable and fun to try."
"2.0 D: I'm afraid that if I drink too much of this, my stomach will explode from all the pressure created by the copius amounts of carbonation."
"Pour this brew carefully for it is very likely to overflow, much like it's lighter brother, weissbier. I could drink this all night, as it's light and flavorful."
"Overall not too impressed, but its drinkable."
"Drinkable - a bit bitterish for style, which would be fine, but the expected malt character seems restrained for a dunkel. All-in-all it becomes less impressive down the line, but in the end is still a nice dunkelweisse (don't really get the ""schwarze"" part - they should call it ""dunkelweisse, as that's what it is - dark but not black). Anyway, certainly worth trying!"
"PS: As this beer warms, some more flavor develops -- however, you lose the refreshing aspect that is it's best feature, in my opinion."
"Overall.. pretty good.. very good.. Expensive.. but I am really glad I had a chance to try it."
"16.9oz flip-top bottle poured into a weizen glass. Pours a dark brownish color with a nice off-white head that possesses excellent retention and lacing. The aroma is wheat with some banana and clove and a bit of yeastiness. The taste is a nice dose of wheat and malt with some spices and a yeasty finish. Overall, Moosbacher Schwarze Weisse is a solid Dunkelweizen that is perfect for a hot summer day. Recommended."
"Gorgeous cloudy brown color on the pour with a decent head and minimal lace. delicious taste with a wheaty-appeal to it. Mouthfeel is perfect, very clean and refreshing with no bitter or poor aftertaste. Highly drinkable beer, and if it were not for the price, this would be a perfect session beer"
"This one had alot going for it in the beginning. Poured up medium to dark brown and somewhat cloudy resembling some nasty, rusty rain water poured from an old pipe. Precisley what I look for in this style. The smell was rather spicy and in a round-about way kind of reminded me of banana bread dough with more spice and less banana. So far so good. I take a sip, and everything comes to a woefully abrupt stop. There is a very noticeable sourness in the flavour of this one that is more akin to a farmhouse / spontaneously firmented...thing, than a weisse bier. I don't mind sournes in beer, so-long as it's *supposed* to be there. I have never encountered this characteristic in this style. Ever. And it was very ""off-putting"" for lack of a better word. I'd give the flavour average at best. Mouthfeel was about what was to be expected. Drinkability would be great, but that sourness just really distracts me. I love this style, but I can't do this one. Perhaps I got a bad beer?"
"Overall, this was drinkable, but I'm not really excited about it."
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a fruity banana clove scent along with a light wheat, crystal, and pale malt aroma. It's very dry with a slight crystal malt sweetness. The taste is average. It has an extremely dry wheat malt flavor with just a touch of fruity yeast esters. It's quite earthy with little crystal malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is average also. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average dunkel. It's looks great, but it's not very interesting."
"i've never had this one, figured i'd give it a shot, BB date is 12/08 & says it must be stored under 50*, must be fresh, it was on a shelf ; pours a light orange-brown color w/ a huge light tan head which lasted forever in spite of my delicate pour leaving loads of pinhole lacing in my weizen glass ; a bit of a light smell, but good nonetheless w/ the classic banana and clove aroma sticking out the most, some bready malt aroma as well as a bit of coriander ; an interesting flavor, slightly tart, more malty than fruity, an almost smokey quality in the malt profile, w/ faint caramel notes, more banana and coriander at the finish w/ something i can't put my finger on lingering( dark fruit ?) ; light-bodied w/ lots of co2, the flavor hangs in just enough ; i like this beer, def. a drinkable one too...."
"I will always judge dunkelweizens to the perfect one I had in the pub just outside Charlemagne's Dom in Aachen on a rainy day in June 2004. Ayinger comes closest on a consistent basis, and the Weihestaphaner (sp?) is always quite good, too. Keep the search going."
"Prosit, MK"
"Firm body and finished crisp, even when the bottom yeasties were swirled into the mix. I could easily drink more, but wont make a big effort to get it again."
"Overall- A good representation of the style. It's a nice cooler weather alternative to the hefes I enjoy during the summer months."
"Hrmmmm. Quite an interesting beer here. It's not amazing, but quite good. Considering the cost, I think there are much better and cheaper alternatives, but the benchmark for this category in my book is Franziskaner."
"d: a little inconsistent, fizzy and metallic at first but improving in depth and mouthfeel over time"
"Light/medium bodied, fairly smooth and easily drinkable."
"Moosbacher Schwarze Weisse pours a beautiful mahogany color with orange highlights and a thick off white head from a brown half liter swingtop bottle. The aroma strikes me as being sweet and yeasty. There is an almost metallic flavor at first, some nutty flavors. Banana is noticeable, but clove really isn't to me. I would like a thicker mouthfeel. Worth a try."
"Unpleasant astringent mouthfeel leads off this sickly sweet mess of a beer. This is a year past it's prime, and I hope that explains the flavors that require me to rinse my mouth after sipping this atrocity."
"From the ceramic-lidded swing top bottle, consumed right after the Weiss. this poured with a less-pronounced head, looking more like a regular dunkel bier than dunkelweiss. The aroma, too, is much more malty than yeasty ... with a big sweet cookieness to it. Likewise the flavor was like a sweet Girl Scout treat ... very sugary. Light and slippery, this was closer to a homebrewed soda than a dunkelweiss. (#2727, 2/25/2007)"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3"" tan head above the clear dark caramel brew. Head fades down sedately, but still keeps an 1"" of height, with hordes of thick, coating lacing. Aroma is clovey spicy wheat. Taste is sweet upfront, then the wheat flavors kick in, with citrus lingering. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin, but is quite smooth, and drinkability is alright as well. Not a bad beer, but not one I'd probably head out to find again."
"I like this beer because it captures all that is good about Weizens, without being over-the-top about it. Man, I would be really bummed to learn these guys are fascists. They make a killer beer."
"Hopefully, this is accurate, considering the past-date freshness, but I wanted to throw this in to contribute to the rating of this apparently unknown beer. Will update next time I pick it up."
"Pours a thick hazy brown, with a nice tan head. Looks good. Nose is wheat with sweet bananas and a hint of spicy cloves and maybe some nutmeg. Very nice! Taste is not quite as exciting, but still good. It's a basic wheat/malt balance, with not much sweetness or spiciness. Mouthfeel is tangy and bubbly like a hefe. Drinkability is good on this one."
"Moosbacher Schwarze Weisse isn't a vastly different beer than was Moosbacher Weissbier. Yeah, they taste different due to the different styles, but in terms of quality they're two peas in a pod. Or, if you prefer the German, 'sich gleichen wie ein Ei dem anderen'. This is a decent dunkel weizen without being an especially memorable one."
"""yessir, I think I like it"" - mr horse"
"I had visions of Captain Morgan spiced rum while drinking this. It wasn't sickly sweet, but still it had some comparable flavors."
"0.5l flip top bottle. Best before 10 06 on label."
