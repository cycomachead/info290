"Pours a really dark brown with almost no red tone to it, and looks like there's some cloud to it due to this but held to the light it's clarified. Not much head to speak of, and I'm having this in a tallish sort of goblet that I like for lagers, saisons, and Belgian IPA's. Not the ""prettiest"" beer I've ever beheld, but the aroma is nice, bready and malty, and the flavor follows suit with a nice tang to it. Very sweet and a little chocolaty, with very, very light alcohol. Super drinkable, nice and clean, good carbonation. I would definitely drink this again, but don't think I'd buy another sixer - probably opt for some Leffe Brun or an Oktoberfest with a little more abv. Still, I think they did really well with this one, and I'll surely have to try one on draught next time I'm at Prost."

"i see what the hype is about now, this prost beer is good stuff! served at the bicycle cafe and apparently a different brew than the dunkel lager already on BA. this is a weiss beer, meaning wheat malt, and trust me when i say its malty. it pours a very thick and cloudy almost brown red color with a very dense white head on top. there is a ton of suspended sediment, just how i like there. its got a hefe nose on it, all spicy and clovey and banana smelling from the yeast. only difference is the dark wheat base it has underneath it is a bit sweeter than the lighter version. its got a gentle sweetness, maybe a touch of molasses or something going on here. feel is excellent and quite unexpected. huge body for the style, and mild carbonation. its incredibly smooth and drinkable, especially at this low abv, this could be consumed all day long pretty easily. its very very soft in the mouth, and glides down easy. my first prost beer has inspired a brewery visit, maybe next weekend..."
