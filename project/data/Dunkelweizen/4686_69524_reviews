"Had this with some bratwursts and sauerkraut at Hofbrau Munchen in Panama City, FL, at Pier Park.  Paired very well with my meal, and as far as I know you can only get this beer at their restaurants/gastropubs.  Not the best dunkelweizen I've had, but solid nontheless, and a great accompaniment to German cuisine."

"A touch more malt body and lose the light metallic character, and this would be fantastic."

"Enjoyed 12 oz. at Beer Revolution. A reddish murky brown, about as dark as some North American brewed weizenbocks, with an unassuming tan head. Smells like the expected banana and clove yeast flavors, with the banana predominating, along with smooth caramel and a tinge of citrus rind. This was just what the doctor ordered after recently trying some fairly sour dunkelweizens that underachieved in the malt department, a nice rich malt complexity, almost smoky, with subtle dried apricot notes ... Potent yet refined. Very banana-forward, with clove present as well but relatively downplayed. I do not taste much in the way of citrus but there is an earthy root cellar spice in the finish. Not super sticky or thick but does have some chew, and pleasingly enough the spice builds on the palate as you go, drying things out and providing a nice contrast to the rich malty and fruity beginning and middle. This is how this style ought to be executed ... Says the non-German amateur beer geek. If nothing else I try to pay close attention, and this was well worth the mental effort."

"I have bought many a dunkle weiss in the states and have been unable to find anything close to how good this beer is. If you ever come across this beer, do yourself a favor and order a full liter."

"A classic Dunkelweizen that favors banana esters and malty sweetness over hop balance and acidity. A great variance to many of the the more zesty or lemony wheat beers out there."
