4.15,-2.4,4.25,3,4.75,4.25,4.25,"Very tasty beer! Scents of fruitiness and hops dominate when the bottle is cracked. I smelled either hickory or some other smokey kind of scent about half way through the bottle. I tasted caramel, cinnamon, and very subtle banana bread. 30 seconds after a sip I can taste some sort of berry flavor which is sweet, like strawberries along side a gentle maltiness. Somewhat complex, and a good beer to share with a close friend at a bbq for those who like to savor a beer. Overall, very pleasant beer. My favorite so far from Weihenstephan.","McGooTheWise","Mar 29, 2015"

Rating it is hard because I don't know a lot of wheat beers and this one seems to check all the right boxes. I definitely like that it's not too sweet. That said, it didn't bowl me over - I guess it could be a matter of the style and personal preference. Also, I guess it would be better on a hot July day versus a freezing cold February night ;-) Anyway, highly recommended as an authentic German wheat beer, despite the price tag.","maedhros09","Feb 10, 2015"

Color is a cloudy amber while being poured then settles into a tobacco brown with plenty of visible yeast, and a two-finger white head that slowly dissipates with almost no lacing. Smells like wheat bread, I am not kidding. Reminded me of Sara Lee. The taste is very bready, with rich wheat flavors and little hop presence and a sweet finish.

Great aroma of German malts and hops with a dark bread aroma as well. Even more going on with the taste as this is very flavorful, more with every sip. Medium+/Full bodied with perfect carbonation but not a 'heavy' beer. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. This is a fantastic brew like their others since this the World's Oldest Brewery from 1040!

Weihenstephaner makes the best hefeweizen in the world, and they certainly can throw their hat into the ring on dunkelweizen as well--if you like clove and spice and everything nice. I also must say that the flavor profiles come through a lot more aggressively on tap than when I've had this out of the bottle. Not sure if that's due to a freshness issue and the likelihood that a keg will be fresher than a bottle, but this is by far the most I've ever enjoyed this beer.","LambicPentameter","Jul 14, 2014"

4.42,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Picked this up at a great beer shop in Darmstadt, Germany, Maruhn Welt der Getränke. Cloudy amber-orange pour with a beautiful four finger off-white head with great retention and lacing. The nose is big and earthy with lots of banana and brown bread along with hints of clove, toffee, caramel, and brown sugar. The taste mirrors the nose with huge notes of brown bread, banana, and clove along with hints of caramel, nuts, apple skin, pear, and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is smooth and subtly creamy with perfect carbonation and a great balanced finish. Overall, I've never been much of a fan of wheat beers, which sucks having lived in Germany so long. But I've recently had some great experiences with them and have decided to re-explore the style. This is an amazingly flavorful beer that's hugely drinkable extremely well balanced. It will definitely be restocked in the beer fridge.","beerdrifter","Feb 25, 2014"

Aroma is immediately spicy and semi-sweet, with clove, fresh ripe bananas, toffee, and dark bread crust all vying for attention. I was immediately struck by the sensuous, smooth, creamy mouthfeel ... Great weizen texture, rather chewy but smooth as a cue ball. As is the case for Weihenstephan's lighter-colored weissbier proper, there are a lot of clove phenolics on the palate, clove trumping the sweeter elements, but there is ample banana as well along with what registers as vanilla to my palate. Nice banana bread effect with clove and allspice accents, some sultana raisin, and cooked pears, a tinge of berry. Great stuff. The malt flavors are distinguished and classy, not aggressive, leaving plenty of room for the spice and fruit to shine through. The mouthfeel is amazing. An essential and iconic example of the style.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 21, 2014"

I am a huge fan of Dunkels and this may be on the lighter side but still has it's own distinct flavor to it. The German hops take precedent in this beer early and stay through all the way to the last sip. Poured a great dark amber color with a cloudiness to it as well. A small finger width head with an easy not overwhelming aroma. Sweet malty flavor followed by a fruitiness, however not overpowering at all. This is a great beer from a great brewery and I will always hold a spot in my heart for the Weihenstaphan brewery!","Petey9790","Dec 23, 2013"

The sweetness lies delicately and just underneath every flavor quality giving it it's dark character with the nuts and grain. Spirited, civilized, sensational.

The flavor perfectly matches the aroma, so I won't reiterate it here. I will say that the mouthfeel is divine, as the effervescent carbonation complements the flavor and body perfectly. This is very similar to their hefeweizen, just with more of a caramel flavor, which I actually find to be a little too sweet for my tastes. With that said, it's right for the style, and there's no denying the execution. This is one flavorful and refreshing beer.","MaximalC","Apr 29, 2013"

I like the additional body it provides, there is a nice soft feel too, although the carbonation is still quite lively. its traditional, its cheap, and its damn good. how can you beat that? I think of the four ive had from this brewery, I like the regular hefe the best, but all have been extraordinary. again, the value cannot be beat!","StonedTrippin","Feb 11, 2013"

Although I have always been a pretty big hefeweizen fan, dunkelweizen acceptance has eluded me - probably because there have never been any particularly good ones available locally. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel changes all that for me, as it shows the same level of quality and craftsmanship as their flagship hefe. Even though I probably like the hefe a bit more, this stuff is still a strong contender in the wheat beer category, and undoubtedly the best dunkel I've ever had. This is a delicious brew, and no fan of German wheat beer should hesitate to try it. A magnificent selection for my 400th review on BA, one that I will assuredly pick up again soon.","thehyperduck","Dec 20, 2012"

4.18,-1.6,5,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer tastes of subdued banana, spicy clove, and sweet wheat grain. It begins surprisingly light with hints of plantains, before opening into unripe banana flavors with spicy clove notes, and then folding into a thick wheat grain and spice flavoring that lasts in the mouth. In the middle of the taste there is also an almost-pear flavor alongside the banana esters of the yeast, and there also rich caramel notes alongside the wheat grain in the aftertaste. On the mouth, the beer feels creamy and smooth, with a medium body. Carbonation is velvety, and the tongue is left sticky in the back with malty saliva, while the rest of the mouth feels quite dry. Overall this is a lovely Dunkelweizen. I feel that some of the rich banana esters from Weihenstephan’s Hefeweizen are lost here in the darker malts, which is too bad, but the addition of heavy wheat grain flavors is nice. The smell is definitely more complex than the taste though. This beer is a classic and definitely worthy of a taste, though I hold their Hefeweizen up as a better beer than this.","Maxwell","Dec 14, 2012"

It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I really liked the spice aspect going on in this one as it added quite a nice touch to all of the typical bread and fruit flavors you would typically expect from the style. It was very easy on the palate and fairly well balanced throughout. Definitely worth trying for the curious and the fans of the style alike. A must try.","thagr81us","Sep 27, 2012"

Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are strong notes of banana and clove in the nose. There is plenty of wheat malt in the aroma as well. There is mild sweetness and breadiness from the malt and the yeast expression comes through very well with the banana flavor and spiciness.

Weihenstephan has once again gone for balance over potency, restraining the banana/bubble-gum/clove notes you might expect to find in abundance; not to say this lacks flavor.","augustgarage","May 23, 2012"

4.28,0.7,5,4.5,4,5,4,"500 ml bottle into signature weizen glass, bottled 2/2/2011. Pours super hazy red orange color with a beautiful 3 finger fairly dense off white head with incredible retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some nice thick lacing clings to the glass; with a ton of carbonation streaming up as expected. Took me a while to pour this as I anticipated. Aromas of huge banana, clove, bubblegum, orange, wheat, bread, and yeast spices. Huge on the bubblegum here, amazing. Taste of orange, clove, bubblegum, bread, caramel, light banana, pepper, and yeast spices. Fairly dry on the finish; with some light lingering notes of citrus, clove, caramel, and biscuit on the finish for a short bit. Great overall balance of flavors. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is pretty much invisible, and this drinks incredible smoothly. Overall this is a fantastic dunkelweizen, and my first one in the style. Nice amount of complexity; with very smooth drinking and a great mouthfeel. I will definitely have it again.","superspak","Mar 06, 2012"

Nose has banana and light bubble gum as per the regular Weissbier, a bit of cocoa and caramel as well adding a touch of dunkel character. Taste has caramel, banana, bubble gum, light cocoa and some darker malt and bread notes, albeit subtle. Light chalkiness.

The smell has a very nice clove and banana like the regular hefe, with other more Belgian spicy malt and yeast notes, bready and darker ripe fruit all of which translates to the taste. The taste has the elements of the smell but it seems muted in a way. It's great banana, ripe dark fruits, clove but it seems more watery to me. Nice carbonation accents the spice. Overall it's quite nice, but the regular hefe is just so divine it might almost be effecting my review. Definitely worth a try.","Dreadnaught33","Aug 26, 2011"

4.32,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark ruby/brownish hue with a tall 1" off white head. Smells bright of typical banana and clove esters. Taste is spot on dunkelweizen, and the best version I have ever had. Crisp and clean without a strong aftertaste and easy drink ability of this beer makes it an excellent summertime treat.","OhYesILoveBeer","Aug 18, 2011"
4.41,3.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Soft and sweet, it is a very easy drinking beer. Not quite as good as their standard hefeweizen, this dunkel is still an outstanding beer.

4.15,-2.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer poured with a two-finger head and a cloudy, honey-brown complexion. The head retention was good seeing as the head lasted throughout. The aroma was pleasing, presenting with a light spiciness, fruity esters, a bread-like heartiness, and no noticeable hop presence. The taste bore a strong malt sweetness, light spiciness on the tongue, and cloves. The mouthfeel is pleasing with a light coating left on the tongue. Overall, this is a good beer, hearty and satisfying.","alexolit","Aug 05, 2011"

4.67,9.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This was one of my first overpours in a long time, just broaching the lip of the glass. Once it finished playing around, it settled into a finger of light-tan head with mild retention. Color was a very cloudy orangish-brown (or was it a brownish-orange?). Nose was very clove/spice-forward, underlain by banana esters. I am finding that the bubble gum scent fades when overpowered by clove. Yay! Mouthfeel was full, approaching creamy, with lots of spicy clove flavors up front with the banana taking a backseat. Now, here is another beer that I can solidly endorse! Finish continued to be extremely spicy and I could hardly get enough. I must mark this one down for future reference.","woodychandler","Jul 03, 2011"
4.47,5.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: I've had little experience with Dunkelweizen, but would still venture to say this ranks amongst the best examples of the style.

3.78,-11.1,5,4.5,3,4,4,"The taste just isn't there relative to what I want it to be. The initial bursts of flavor similar to the nose aren't there and it comes across as watery.

When I went for my first taste I initially got a little bit of foam on my nose (definitely a good sign, great head retention) the taste was similar to the smell but also brought out a nuttiness or a dark fruitiness of some sort, there is also just a slight bit of a roasted flavor to this.

Nice mild hop drying effect that balances off the malts. The mouthfeel is wet up front drying in the back and medium overall. Carbonation is prickly and burpy.

The smell is of the traditional belgian yeasts which include the heavy smells of banana and clove. In addition there were aromas of orange zest and the overall bready malt aroma. The taste was strongly of the banana, clove and citrus most closely associated with orange. There were also hints of rock candy and brown sugar.

There are a number of aromas coming from this beer; I can smell clove, banana, and a slight sweetness reminiscent of brown sugar. It tastes of musty yeast, like a weissebier should. There is lots of banana and some clove in the flavor. The finish has a bit of peppery spice to it. The beer has a medium body and high carbonation. The coating is very good and it contains some sweetness. The pepper in the finish provides a bit of a bite, but otherwise it finishes cleanly. It is a very drinkable beer.

Taste is more banana, almost banana flambe: banana, sweetness and alcohol. The only bitterness there is is right at the end of the taste. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation brings out the flavor.

The taste is fuller and richer with lots of banana and more fresh baked bread. A touch of sweetness and possibly a touch of astringent clove in the finish. Really drinkable and a great late spring refresher. It has enough body and complexity to capture your interest before a hefe is required for the dog days of summer. Really pleasant.","Anthony1","Oct 06, 2009"

Murky light brown to orange in color, fairly muted, actually looks like rusty pipe water. The amount of banana in the nose is shocking, outpaces the mineral water as well as the cinnamon bun, caramel, clove, can't shake this metallic edge, gentle apricot to pear scents slip in unobtrusively. Medium-bodied, the carbonation has a strong lifting effect, to the point where it combats the flavors as they try to soak the palate. This keeps things waxing and waning, from the chocolate, caramel, clove spice to the fig, date, peach, apricot fruit. Nothing can rise above the rest and enunciate clearly. More dough than cooked bread, retains some minerally freshness. Creates a perfumed moistness in the mouth.

Smells wheaty, prominent banana and clove, spicy. Tons of banana and cloves in the flavor as well, peppery, some lemony zest. Excellent bitterness/sweetness balance. This is a lot more similar to the regular hefe than I anticipated, which is not a bad thing. The malt is just slightly toastier.

Like a slightly darker version of a hefe. The banana-ness is tuned down a notch from the nose, and maybe a bit more spicing/clove than in the smell.

Nose is malty with lemony notes as well as what I can best describe as jalapeno. Taste is sublime; beer is amazingly well balanced. Caramel is present and some malty sweetness.

Complexity of the taste is standout. A subtle peppery and very faint clove spiciness owes it to the yeast's work on the wheat. Bready malt sweetness covers the tongue. Banana settles down considerably after its work in the aroma, but still plays a solid part in the taste. Slightly drying finish. Man, words just don't really do it justice.

Light wheat and chocolate on the palate, yeast, a mild bitterness, and just a kiss of green hops on top of a medium, tingly and dry, yet smooth body.

Oh yeah, it smells a whole hell of a lot different than a cider as well. Banana bread, but that is a bit of an overstatement to be honest. We've got slight bits of cinnamon-apple and/or cloves, but more of an apply kind of aroma rather than just plain cloves. Yeast is a beast on this, does some wonderful things to this beer, first sips reveals decent amounts of everything, sort of like picking and choosing different spices from your spice rack, sounds lame but it's true. Slight, standard banana, but with an added, creamier, depth to everything. I've never had a pumpkin beer but I feel like I get the idea of one as I drink this beer. The creamy and spicy characteristics of this beer lead me to believe this. Yet for all this beer has to offer, and it's a lot, something about this beer leaves me wanting more, the mouthfeel is just a bit lagging and taste is a bit one sided, a good, but not great, beer.

Poured a translucent brownish-amber with gold highlights. Tight, dense four inch off-white head with lots of sticky lacing present throughout the tasting. Scent of spices hits you immediately out of the bottle (corriander and clove), followed by bubblegum and a light banana essence. Wheat flavor dominates up front in the mouth; flavors identified in the nose are present, but very much watered down and somewhat muted and bland. Also detected a light yeastiness towards the finish.

Not much hops and the more I drank the more interesting things I tasted. Roast beef? Dark chocolate? Its all there but the banana I like in the hefes.

The same could be said about the flavour. There's a pleasing caramel backbone that played very well with the hefe character. And there's a bit of dry cocoa that came out in the finish.

A huge head cascades up to fill the top of the glass with whiteness, which eventually fades to just a thin film. It has a very yeasty aroma. It smells dark and dank, but a bit subdued. The taste is full of yeast, imparting some subtle fruity esters. Banana is in the background. There is also some brown sugar in the background and maybe cinnamon. Throughout, a heavy wheat tang presides. Little to no hop bitterness or flavor, probably just enough to cut the wheat and yeast. It is very soft and easy, not biting in any way. The mouthfeel is full...a true German experience. This is 5.3% and goes down easy....very easy to drink. This beer is very intriguing to me, but I do prefer the straight hefe. I have a feeling this bottle wasn't the freshest specimen around and imagine that hurt it. Unfortunately, no easy to read freshness date was present.","Hagbard","Jul 05, 2006"

It is really malt paradise. I prefer mine chilled up and consumed in the following manner.

The taste was very much like that of a hefe with the addition of caramel and bread/grain flavors. The fruit flavors were present throughout the session and added depth, in my opinion. Not nearly as sweet as other beers I've had within this style, but still sweeter than bitter. Chewy texture with nice carbonation. Quite drinkable.","jaluria","May 19, 2006"

Smooth, not cloying in the least and the carbonation is spot on - not overdone or bubbly like many wheat beers can be. I could drink this all day and night.

Strong on carbonation, the mouthfeel runs slightly thin. Alcohol seems low.

Solid yeasty base mixes with bananas and even a bit of cocoa. Soft, light mouthfeel that's almost crisp. I'm a big fan of the refreshing wheat beers (German and Belgian).

Very delicious aroma of bananas, apples, along with sweet citrous and some toasted malt. Taste is a creamy blend of fruits, along with some good clean bittering hops that prickle the tongue. Full taste leaves me wanting nothing. A good blend of toasted pale malt with some darkness provides a hell of a backbone for the subdued sweetness. Some yeasty notes are there as well. Crisp carbonation moves the taste along, and compliments the beer well. This brew is hella good, and wickedly drinkable.","BeerFink","Apr 24, 2005"
3.87,-8.9,3.5,4,4,3,4,"There is something about die Dunkelheit that I really like. This beer draws parallels to Kozel Dark, although naturally this one is a Weizen, although the only real effect of that is more pronounced carbonation and a slightly more acidic taste. This beer looks nicely nut-brown and cloudy in the glass (important for a Weißbier), but has inadequate head retention for the style. Despite this, smell is pleasing, and body is happily nutty, chocolatey and slightly sour on the palate. Mouthfeel is upset by the rabid effervescence as the beer enters the mouth, but is still good. I would drink this all night in Bavaria if there weren't other magnificent beers on offer. But in Australia, I'd buy the cheaper, similar but superior Kozel Dark (different style but close enough for the comparison).","Weizenmensch","Apr 08, 2005"

Still the wheat flavor, but with a little more of a burnt malt characteristic. A little hint of banana. Very clean aftertaste; smooth drinking with little of the flavor lingering once it's gone.

Initial flavors consist of sweet fruits, and an intense wheaty body. There are hints of caramel and almost cocoa like flavors in the mix but these are soon overwhelmed by the strong fruity flavors of plum and fig. There is also just some slight hints of clove and a bit of molasses. The finish has a spritzy carbonation and a sweet wheat tone with hints of bubblegum and more sweet molasses.

Aroma is more on the malt side of things with a dark malt scent to be detected but not much else except wheat. The taste is very different from both Erdinger and Franziskaner as the esters are very subdued and i can only pick up the barest clove esters. Beginning with a rush of carbonation the toungue experiences a slight noble hop bitterness quickly overtaken by the dry wheat flavor which is blended with a delicate chocolatey malt flavor which segues into a clean finish. An excellent session beer it presents clean flavors with complexity as well as being different from the other Dunkelweizens out there so as to keep beer drinkers in a heaven of diverse beer choices.","RenoZymurgist","Oct 03, 2004"

Taste is also sweet, with the malts being the dominant one in this complex relationship. There is a light citrus in the flavor and a perfectly placed crispness from the carbonation. The mouthfeel is medium and incredibly smooth. I don't usually drink wheat beers in session, but this one would be the one I would choose.

The taste is also quite malty, with only a mild level of sweet fruitiness, but a bit of a spicy bite and lemony tanginess. The mouthfeel is light and feels a bit watered down.

The nose was quite nice and well-developed, consisting of a banana spice bread maltiness accented with clove and estery notes of dried apple and pear. The flavors resembled the nose closely, with a pear tinged doughy clove maltiness that builds in intesity and tartness towards the nicely bittered and powerful estery finish. The body seemed just a tad watery, but in other respects was appropriate. I found this beer to be quite drinkable, due to its deliciousness and lighter body feel.

The malt is fuller and more pronounced in this hefe than in a lot of others I've tried putting this on the heavier end of the spectrum for hefe's, even dunkel hefe's.

Just a tad darker than Schneider Weiss -- cloudy tarnished copper. Big meringue head, the kind where bubble pop and a leave a permanent pit. The aroma, in addition to some of the typical aromas had this aroma I associate with stilton cheese. It's not a cheesiness, but that aroma that I can't really describe but think of as a smokey earthiness. Great hefe flavors, a bit milder than I prefer (I'm a Schneider Weiss aficionado) but this is made up by the darker malt flavors. A bit like caramel and bananas. Great, elegant beer.","aracauna","Jul 28, 2003"
2.7,-36.5,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"I can't believe I'm giving this beer relatively low marks, since the other beers I've had from the brewery have been very good. Perhaps I expected too much. Poured a hazy ice tea brown. Not a lot of aroma. Mild banana yeast esthers jumped up at the front, but then surrendered to nondescript sweet yeast flavors. Did not detect a lot of wheat malt, which was surprising for a dark wheat.","Brent","Jul 25, 2003"
4.33,1.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Murky, multi-shaded brown/dark amber with a massive, three fingers worth of off-white head. Excellent retention. Minimal lace. Almost perfect Hefeweizen nose (spicy, yeasty, clove) then sprinkle in hints of caramel malt what an invitation! The potency is a touch light, oh well. Very tasty palate, well balanced with pepper, clove, and spice upfront yeastiness and apples (briefly) in the middle the end is softly caramel, distant maltiness the aftertaste is softly peppery and provoking carbonation that tickles your tongue loiters on the dry side, rather clean. Medium body. Exceedingly drinkable! This is a great dark wheat ale, my high expectations were easily met if you see the name Weihenstephaner on the label, buy it! As for this one, recommended.","bditty187","Jul 23, 2003"
2.74,-35.5,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"An initially large off-white head that almost overflowed the glass with moslty fine bubbles.

4.51,6.1,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Taste is a nice mellow lemon flavor, easy tartness, balanced nicely with darker malts and wheat, a bit of breadish dryness, touch of banana and spice in there, smooth the entire gulp. Nice open and mellow medium body feel, mostly midway action then thins out nicely in the finish leading it to be drinkable beyond comprehension. One excellent, fine beer to drink any Ol' time, but favors the warmth of summer.","tavernjef","Jun 22, 2003"
4.5,5.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow! What a beer! It offers all of the flavors and aromas of the standard Weihenstephaner weizen with the addition of a light caramel note. It pours a cloudy, tawny brown body with a full head of creamy off-white foam. Soft banana, light clove-like spice, light brown sugar and apples appear in the nose. The body is medium and it appears initially crisp and then creamy across the palate due to its very fine and effervescent natural carbonation. Gentle spice appears first in the flavor; followed by a soft maltiness that's just slightly tangy and backed by gentle fruitiness (bananas, apples). It's very well-balanced by an underlying bitterness, and it finishes with a lingering note of nutty malt and some drying clove-like yeastiness. Refreshing but full of flavor. Exceptional!","NeroFiddled","Jun 19, 2003"
4.45,4.7,4,4,5,4.5,4,"i love the hefe-weissebier, figured this would be good too. pours a beautiul dark amber color with a nice medium white head. reduces a bit, but a nice small head stays and laces the glass nicely throughout the drinking session. smells of wheat, clove and a bit of spice, and pretty much tastes the same. not quite as "wheaty" as the normal hefe, but is a little heavier and fruitier tasting, reminds be of a mix between the hefe and the korbinian? i dont know. finishes a bit dry and the mouthfeel is great. good carbonation that just feels great on the toungue. this stuff is great.","DESTRO","Jun 03, 2003"
4.5,5.9,4,4,4.5,5,5,"It's muddy brown and lighter brown on the edges. The head is huge and laces well. The aroma is a direct early look into the flavors; of which include banana, chocolate, yeast, lemon, clove, spice, toasted malt.....very awesome and refreshing brew with crisp carbonation. It's kind of like a mellow chocolate covered banana with lemon zest to boot. Awesome stuff.","AudioGilz","May 27, 2003"
4.1,-3.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"German wheat beer is probably my favorite style if I absolutely had to choose one and Weihenstephaner is one of the great breweries of germany. That said, I find this dark wheat to be exceptional in flavor and quality. Beautiful dark brown with standard huge wheat head of froth. Smell is sweet and malty with a definite yeast presence. Full of wheat flavor that is sweet and malty. Full bodied and ultra smooth on the palate.","BierReise","May 22, 2003"

4.54,6.8,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Ah, summer's around the corner and the hefe weizens will be pouring on out of the breweries. Here's a bottle of one of the best, this one's a slightly tan color ( not as dark as most dunkelweizens) with the traditional big hefe foam. The aroma is huge! Lots of clove,banana cream, a hint of chocolate and spices. The flavor is malty and sweet with bubblegum,clove,more banana cream with a little yeast tangyyness on the tongue. It is lighter body with lots of carbonation at first with a creaminess as it settles. I like the flavor but the darker grains don't show themselves well in this one like others of this ilk. It is a very refreshing beer that's getting my groove on for the warmer months ahead.","jeffboo","Apr 08, 2003"
4.17,-1.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This beer pours a rich, creamy, bronze color with a rather large white head. During the pour, yeast is seen diving from the bottle and splashing gleefully into the glass, which makes me pause and reminisce about my last batch of homebrew which unfortunately is no longer with us. The aroma is a fruity caramel scent which is quite pleasing to the nasal passages. The taste is pretty sweet with almost a caramel taste to it. While it wasn't exactly love at first taste with this beer, by the time the bottle was finished, we had warmed to each other quite nicely. Now I'm looking forward to seeing her again.","darklager","Apr 06, 2003"
4.38,3.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours the brown color of a deep, brown wood stain with a surprisingly white, rocky head. The taste is a standout on this beer. Reminds me of some sort of citrus-inspired yule log -- that is, lemon and caramel-chocolate intermingle. A perfect play of the wheat with a sweeter, fruity malt flavor. Just a great-tasting brew.","marburg","Apr 02, 2003"
3.5,-17.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy brown/copper color with a huge rocky head. Head retention is great, it lasts until the last drop. The aroma is full of malted goodness mixed with a hint of cocoa and toffee. The taste is an exceptional medley of malt, hops, vanilla, and bananas. This is a great medium bodied beer from the folks at Weihenstephaner.","Scooter77","Mar 30, 2003"
5,17.6,5,5,5,5,5,"My favorite style beer from my favorite brewery. Great flavor, great color.A slightly stronger taste than an average Weiss beer, and the typically rich Wiehenstephaner quality.Anyone who likes Weiss beers would love this beer, and I suggest that they try it as soon as they can get their hands on this semi hard to find beer.","WMBierguy","Mar 10, 2003"

4.28,0.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Clear brew (until the yeast is poured in), medium-amber in color forming a peaking, meringue-like off-white head atop medium-large bubbles with strong carbonation, and very active spiral streamers. The head remains at least 1/2" thick until the bottom of the glass. Lacing is good. Aroma is rich with phenolic bananas and clove, peppery alcohol, and lightly husky amber malts. Mouthfeel is bright, yet remarkably smooth in finish despite the high carbonation, with a light body. Taste starts out with spritzy bananas and wheat malt, some very subtle soft hops, fading into a slight metallic note, and ending in a wet, lightly astringent, lightly grainy amber malt profile with just enough hop bitterness to balance it. Very easy to drink.","Mitchster","Feb 28, 2003"
4.01,-5.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours like most good dunkel weissbier, dark in color with fine beads of carbonation. A towering off white head is at the top of this beer. Aroma is of most beer of this type, cloves, banana, citrus and yeast. Taste is a bit malted but the natural flavors emerge. A bit dry in the finish but very drinkable. A good beer!","Stubbie1","Feb 26, 2003"
4.6,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"An impressively foamy, bilious head tops a beer with a dark brown, almost pruney, or figgy hue. Aroma is lively and satisfying: citrus, notes of vanilla, banana, cloves, rich, deep, dark. Reminds me of Belgian abbey dubbels, a favorite. Taste is sharp, dry, with a hasty finish, that leaves you yearning for more. A very sociable beer: not too difficult to drink, and not in the least forgettable. Slight bitterness, medium body, and as for flavor, I feel like it's close to a lighter version of a barleywine, crazy as that sounds.","feloniousmonk","Feb 20, 2003"

This beer has sort of a lemony aroma. The taste is very nice, a very malty hefe style, with the traditional yeast flavors being muted and very much in the background. A good version of the style.","jackndan","Jan 19, 2003"
4.88,14.8,5,4.5,5,5,5,"This brew (along with everything from this brewery) is just another example of what excellent beer is all about. Nice chocolatey-looking color as you would expect from a dark weiss beer and the taste is nothing short of outstanding. Very smooth, not at all harsh or "too strong" even for those not accustomed to this type of beer. Generally, I prefer Hefe-weizens to their darker cousins but this is an outstanding exception as this ranks as one of my all time favorites.","mikes2923","Jan 10, 2003"

4.33,1.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Burnt caramel apple color with enormous head. Nice yeasties dumped into the glass making it hazy and tempting. This is a luscious brew, creamy and refreshing in the tradition of the best Bavarian wheats, and roasty and nutty like a good dunkel. Hints of banana, apples, slight medicinal quality in aroma. Quite tangy and sharp on the tongue. I love dunkelweisses but I'd say Weihenstephaner's best brew is the hefe, which is a notch above this, and in the dunkel category overall my nod goes to Ayinger's superior Ur-Weisse. It's good to have choices though. This beer seems a little subdued so I wonder if my palate is off today. Regardless, it's excellent.","Thrasher","Aug 28, 2002"

Aroma seems to indicate a fairly high phenolic content.  There are also some spicy, peppery tones present on the nose.  The mouthfeel is on the high end of the spectrum in regards to carbonation.  Body is medium to full.  I get some banana esters on the tongue as well as mild (to my surprise) phenolic content and peppery spice accents.  Some slight roasted overatures are noted also.  Not bad.  Pretty decent dunkel weizen here.","Bighuge","Aug 11, 2002"

Make sure you swill the bottom of the bottle to get all the yeasty goodness out. Medium to thick bodied, great finish, malty sweetness throughout. Very delicious by itself or with a meal.","StevieW","Jul 03, 2002"
4.21,-0.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The murky, tawny, effervescent, dark bronze hued brew is topped by a formidably dense and mountainous head that deserves respect. After an eternity, the head settles and allows access to the liquid.  Light toasted malt, smooth chocolate notes and mellow banana w/ clean wheat tartness round out the aroma. Banana esters are prominent in flavor while clove is subdued and when combined with the rich, vanilla - like and slightly sweet malt backbone the overall flavor is very enjoyable. Medium in body, w/ a slick, proteinaceous and agreeable mouthfeel typical to good German wheats.  Hop bitterness only serves the purpose of preventing overbearing sweetness, but does its job well.  Finishes w/ a hint of caramel malt sweetness upfront, followed by grainy tartness and lingering but mellow hop bittermess.  This beer exhibits tremendous balance and drinkability.  It's among the best Dunkelweizens I've had thus far.","marc77","Jun 22, 2002"

As you place a tasty morsel in your slavering mouth some mutant hop freak gives you a bitter slap to quell the sweetness. Weihenstephaner sets the standard for Bavarian wheat beer brewers. All the characteristics of their awesome hefe with an addition of sweet malts. Seems on the verge of weizenbock the flavors are so powerful in this brew. A must try for all hefe lovers!","inebrius","Jun 07, 2002"
