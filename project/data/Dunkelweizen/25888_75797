4.61,20.1,4.5,4,5,4.75,4.5,"Roasted, nuttiness, caramel malty sweetness. Not as strong of a traditional flavor of a Dunkel. It was a little thinner but easy to drink. The Walnuts worked very well. A tasty and inviting treat. Easy to drink. Not one dimensional but not too complex ether. Just enough to figure it out by the end of the bottle. I hope to get this one again!","KriekKrazzed","Dec 15, 2014"

Perhaps it's the black walnuts that contribute to the weird taste experience and the rather acidic and phenolic character. A hint of a hefeweizen styling and a bit of a nutty character barely pokes through the fruit and sour notes yet can't pull this brew together in the end. Interesting but not necessarily all that great...","beergoot","Sep 10, 2014"

3.72,-3.1,2.75,4.5,3.75,2.75,3.5,"Picked this up because it was on clearance at Riverside Liquors in Frederick. I figured it was interesting enough to be worth a try. Good looking beer but had a weird fizz when poured, almost like a soda instead of a beer. Fizzy head also dissipated quickly, had me a little worried. But the smell was excellent, very interesting, The taste was also interesting, and very good, but not awesome. But feels a little light, and again, kinda fizzy. Overall while not a bad beer by any stretch, being interesting is the best thing it has going for it. While I enjoyed it I will not be swinging back by to grab any more of these despite the good price.","JamieDuncan","Jul 07, 2014"

4.35,13.3,3.75,4.25,4.5,4,4.5,"i have always wanted nut browns to be more nutty, to actually taste like nuts, and a dark lager is just a fabulous format to finally find a beer that tastes like real nuts. a hazy dark brown beer with a short inch of tan head without a lot of retention. the beer appears quite thick for a lager, and there is some yeast sediment present. it smells amazing, like fresh roasted walnuts, or fresh baked dark chocolate walnut cookies, as it has a nice dark german grain complex in there too, and a hint of bakers chocolate from the roast. the walnuts are by far the dominant flavor, adding an earthy and semisweet protein complex, that has notes of vanilla and tree bark, as well as a general sweetness akin to fresh maple sap before its boiled down into syrup. its perfect for spring, sturdy enough for cold weather no doubt, but jovial enough to remind us all that we have almost made it through winter. how to describe the flavor of a walnut? thats very tough if youve never had a walnut personally, but i think this beer showcases that unique flavor brilliantly, while still being a really cool beer underneath. the lager yeast is bready and adds to that cookie feel, while the finish is pretty clean for its vanilla sugar sweetness throughout. fuller medium body and a smooth texture. maybe a little undercarbonated, but i like the way this sits in my mouth and stomach, extremely satisfying. a memorable brew, perennial is on a roll!","StonedTrippin","Mar 01, 2014"

The nose is walnut banana bread, but is more banana than walnut. The taste is bready sweetness upfront followed by a slightly bitter walnut skin and alcohol. The beer feels medium bodied with rich, nutty, malty sweetness, and a lingering bite that doesn't seem to sit heavy on the palate. This beer is quite drinkable and has a distinct and subtle walnut presence. I think this beer is definitely worth the bottle/growler price and I plan on getting more next week.","ThePorterSorter","Feb 03, 2014"

Aromas of rich sweetness, roasted nut highlights, toffee, and earthy notes. Flavors of roast and tangy sweet forward, with toffee notes, roasted nutty highlights, cream highlights, and some chocolate notes. Pretty layered on the palate. Lighter bodied, but smooth, providing a crisp finish to a beer that is almost velvety and light in mouth. The aftertaste is more of the tangy sweet, with caramel and toffee blending together. Very flavorful and tasty beer.","GarthDanielson","Nov 15, 2013"

3.97,3.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Nice to see another up and coming brewery available in Chicago. Poured into Goose Island wine glass. Appearance is somewhat murky and brown, minimal head upon pour with no retention. The nose features familiar notes of dunkelweizen, plenty of orange and coriander. The walnut comes through in subtle waves as it warms in the glass. Hints at molasses and brown sugar present as well. The taste is similar to the nose. Somewhat sweet up front with lots of ripe fruits and some spice. The walnut provides a delicate nutty finish, but definitely hangs in the background. The mouthfeel is thin with medium to high carbonation. Overall, this is a unique twist on the style. It seems that brews that add nuts are hit in mis as far as the nut presence is concerned. The walnut is evident, but it did take some time to discover. Overall, worth a try.","homebrew311","Jun 24, 2012"
3.64,-5.2,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and toffee. Taste is the same with some mild nutty flavors and a slight tartness. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a better smell than taste in my opinion. The walnuts used in this one are pretty subtle too.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 24, 2012"

3.78,-1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of wheat. Fits the style of a Dunkelweizen. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, slight alcohol, sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of sourness, and a hint of wheat. Overall, good appearance, body, and blend.","Tone","Apr 01, 2012"

3.92,2.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours deep brown, almost black. Smells sweet, with some caramel malts, sugary fruits, and a little nutty. Taste starts off with lots of caramel malts that move into darker fruits (grapes and plums). A little sweet nuttiness and sweet malt is on the finish. Really nice, rich flavor profile. Mouth is full bodies and smooth. Pretty solid dunkel. The walnut adds a nice layer of complexity to a pretty solid beer.","birchstick","Feb 24, 2012"
