"Solid Dark Lager From Germany"
"This pours a dark, murky brown color with a thick, foamy head. The aroma is full of banana and yeast. The taste is sweet, bready with a lingering tasting of some bread and spices. Smooth and easy drinking with a malty finish."

"A pleasant light Dunkelweizen, not super complex, but it is not completely naked as well. Well balanced, nothing is really predominant here relatively to style."

"I wanted to make some sort of blaxploitation reference/joke here, but I just couldn't pull the trigger. Hashtag full disclosure. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear topaz topped by over a finger of wan cream foam. The nose comprises dry wheat, mild orange zest, light pumpernickel, and a pinch of cardamom. The taste brings in more of the same, with the citrus coming through a bit stronger. This is balanced, though, by strong spicy contingent, mostly clove, though with bits of brown sugar and cinnamon in there as well. I also get some rye bread in the finish. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively smooth feel. Overall, a tasty and enjoyable dunkelweizen. 'Nuff said."

"Beer is medium-bodied with medium to medium-high levels of carbonation that are complementary for the style. The result is a slightly fizzy at first, then smoothed-out and foamy mouthfeel. Closes dryly, with a bit of tartness and very minor stickiness across the palate."

"O -- Just about the best Dunkelweizen I've had since I was last in Germany. Very rich in character and flavorful, a solid example for anyone wanting to experience the style."
""
"O: A beer certainly unlike any normal hefe, but easy enough to drink. Nothing to die for, but a session-able beer."
"O- Thought I might like it from the smell and appearance. Nope."

"Poured into a weizen glass from a bottle I picked up in Nuremburg area. Fait head faded fast, minimal lacing on glass. Note glass was rinsed from previous serving. Dark and hazy, smooth, mellow taste, without the bitterness you find in some dark beers. This is one of the best dunkel weizens i've tasted. I have a whole rack of twenty different dunkels arriving on Thursday. let's see if this one can stay on top of the heap. worth trying if you can find it!"

"Clear medium to dark amber color with a average to large, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, beige head. Aroma is moderate malty, bread, caramel, light roasted. Flavor is moderate to light heavy sweet and light to moderate bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft"
"drinkability: I love the dark wheats of germany. this is a great examaple."
"D: A really solid Dunkelweizen and exceedingly easy to drink. Wouldn't hesitate to pick one of these up."
"Drinkability: a decent dunkel. I would prefer more yeasty character on top of the lightly roasted malt backbone."
"D - Not a bad demonstration of the style and I recommend it."
"Smells of bananas semi bitter chocolate figs and spices. Very smooth mouthfeel. The taste is chocalatey and spicy with some bananas floating around. It's easy to drink and lighter than most other Dunkeweizen's I've tried. It's a pretty solid wheat beer but not one of my favorites."
"Tasted in mid-April 2010....500 ml with BBE date 30.Sept.2010, into the Franziskaner glass. Pours cloudy chestnut brown body topped by huge, off-white to light tan long lasting head that never sets completely. The aroma profile exhibits strong (for a weizen) melanoidin character, bread crust, caramel and some subdued bananaish sweetness . Apart from the bread crust sensation the beer doesn't smell bready nor gives off intense banana and clove aromas. The taste is melanoidins, wheat, muted tartness, light hoppy bitterness and yeast, lacking banana and clove. Mild carbonation, light-medium albeit somewhat watery body. A good session weizen but not a memorable one."
"taste is of caramel, some sour malt, roasted nuts, and a touch of cocoa, ends on the dry side."
"Overall a rather unoffensive beer. Nothing real notable. I could see sessioning this one for it's easy going nature."
"Overall - A very solid Dunkelweizen, but I'd still say I prefer Franziskaner. Would glady drink this again though."
"D: This is a nice dunkel. It's light enough to make for a good session beer. A little extra complexity would have been nice."
"D: Not a bad brew, but not much remarkable about it either. I think I would much rather tackle an above-average hefe than another one of these. Weltenburger's offerings, with the exception of their Asam Bock, have been a bit on the disappointing side."
"It is very drinkable. It hit the spot."
"Thin malt in the aroma, pretty darn weak. Taste is better, but still on the light side. Bits of malt, banana and clove dance slowly together, as mentioned, a lighter brew but still tasty and enjoyable. A decent beer to try, but you can get local dark wheat ales at a much better price - and even tastier."
"D - The metallic aftertaste makes this tough to drink more than one."
"A bit strange for a dunkel weizen."
"D- Very drinkable. This is a hefe with good depth, yet not overwhelming."
"M&D: carbonation is a strong point, fresh but not fizzy, on top of a moderate body and relatively soothing flavour profile; all in all, this is not a strictly-speaking ""delicious"" Dunkel Weizen in any sense to me, but a rather harmonious and drinkable version worth revisiting time and again. I wonder if the oxidised-fruit-like sour edge could be milder if served slightly fresher?"
"The bottles on the shelf were fresh at the place I bought this at. It's generally hard to find any lesser known German beers fresh on the shelf regardless of retailer; many of them are old and possibly stale. Although it didn't deliever as much as I hoped, it was worth the try."
"Pours hazy amber. Nice creamy head. Smells of clove/bannana/malt. Taste of clove, bannanas and dark fruit. Finishes with a smooth, shot of alcohol. Ratings on another site are really under rated. This dunkel is a a very good one. Tough to find a crappy beer from these guys!"
"Poured to a dark brown with medium-thick tan head that lingered well and left decent lacing. Aroma was mild, but wheat, nuts and malt scents were the prominent notes. Mouthfeel was slightly tingly, but the body was slightly on the thin side. However, the flavor followed thru again on the malty sweet wheat side, all leading to a medium duration, pleasant finish."
"From a well-chilled half-liter bottle. This poured like a textbook dunkelweizen ... hazy and orange-brown with a solid, stoic head of white foam. I need a flavor identifier to help me pin down this aroma ... wheres the wife when you need her? I dont always want her around when Im breaking out new bottles in my beer room, but this is an exception. Its like a mushy overripe banana or a caramel banana split without the ice cream ... hard to describe. The first swish is incredibly disappointing, I cant tell you. Much more watery than you can imagine. And that same odd essence in the aroma comes thru in the flavor ... cooked banana chips, dark brown sugar, exceptionally sweet. (#2676, 2/2/07)"
"Klosterbrauerei Weltenburg's biggest positive as a brewery is that they don't brew anything that I consider to be average for the style or below. Only the doppelbock and the hefe weizen have been well above average. This dunkel weizen is a passable version that failed to capture my fancy as well as I thought it might. I'm still glad that I had the opportunity to give it a go and might recommend it to those who don't like a strong hefe presence in their hefes."
"It wasn't bad to drink, but nothing to go out of the way for."
"tastes pretty good. it has all the smells and flavors of a good hefe, but seems unable to pull it together for a clean finish. no crisp bitterness, or any sort of bite. leaves sort of a flat sweetness, even a bit of a bad aftertaste. overall decent. one of the few german beers available at the local store, i'll definitely get this again."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Code dated 10.01.02 H."
"Nothing too great about this beer. THe bottle I have looks slightly different than the one on this profile. A traditional dunkel meaning that one could see through the beer glass to the other side. It tasted a bit saucy to me and I'm not sure if i would order another one in the future. weltenburger is not my favorite brewery."
"Medium brown shoe polish hue; tan, solid bubble bath head. The nose is yeasty, as the head settles, some caramel and powdery malts are detectable. Simplisticsome sharp light hops, dark roasted malts and yeast like offerings are blended well together. Sweet, watered down caramel malts give way to chocolate and even some banana peel. The finish is bitter, yet a bit sweet. This is pretty enjoyable; always thought this was a tough style to produce. While the flavors are a bit subdued, this one was smooth and enjoyable enough."
"Big 500 mL German bottle with 10.01.02 on the back, which I hope isn't the date - it was new in the store so pretty sure it's not. No weizen glasses available so we used pilsners, which is the closest thing we could find. It pours a cloudy chestnut color with a 2 finger off-white head of dense tiny bubbles that pits when it recedes and leaves good lacing. The aromas are banana, bubblegum, caramel?, medicine?, sweetness, and clove. The body is light and tingly like a lager and is kinda thin with a short finish. It tastes of bananas (banana pudding), clove, metal/spiciness, caramel/toasted malts, and a mild bitterness. The flavors are there but too subdued. Pretty average in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Nice beer. Not too strong of a flavor, but still very drinkable."
"Smooth micro bubbles and the yeasty silkiness make this very pleasing."
"Overall: Shouldn't this style have more banana or clove?"
"Drinkability This one was unusual for the style but very drinkable. The purists will brand it off-style as should I, but a decent, drinkable weizen of any kind, more or less a dunkel, is so rare here in the US Ill give this one a thumbs up."
"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with this brew. I was hoping that a brewery around since 1050 A.D. (it said so on the label) would have cracked the code for a top-notch dunkelweiss. Too bad this beer fell short."
"Pours a hazy brown color with a nice big dark tan head that slowly subsides.  Sweet chocolatey notes with some very light fruit scents in the aroma.  Nice opening chocolate flavors that soon begin to feel a little watered down.  Definitely a little dissappointing since I've tried others that were very full flavored from this brewery.  Just very thing and watery with no real yeast flavors and no wheaty graininess either.  Thin and not nearly as full in the mouth as it should be, again, dissappointing.  I could drink this beer but I'm not sure why I would want, there are some many better tasting dunkel weizens out there."
