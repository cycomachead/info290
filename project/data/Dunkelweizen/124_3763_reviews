"I have yet to try a noticeably malty dunkelweizen, and Paulaner does not break that trend. In my experience though, when a brewery offers both a weizen and a dunkelweizen, the latter tends to be smoother and rounder. With that in mind, Paulaner's is quite enjoyable. The yeasty tartness is rather prominent but backed up well enough by the other elements not to ruin the experience."

"500ml bottle. Weizen glass. Deep amber color, foggy appearance. Off-white foam lasts as a thin layer on top. Toasted, banana & spiced aromas, phenolic hues & subtle chocolate on the backside. Toasted malty & bready upfront. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Low bitterness in the middle lingers into a bitter/sweet finish, Toasted bread notes on the aftertaste. refreshing & flavorful."

"Not bad, but I'm not yet sure if I like it. Takes more than one to be sure about it."

"overall: Not a bad brew this is one I would give a rookie beer drinker who never had grerman brews but I personally have never been a Paulaner Fan"

"Very smooth and mild tasting which only gets better as one consumes. I believe I paid 1 euro for this 1/2 pint beer."
""
"O: Smooth, creamy, light and delicious, mild hefe tastes and somewhat the texture of a cappuccino. Refreshing and beautifully dark. I prefer more flavour, but really like this one for what it is. Would go well with chocolate, as a summer sipper, chocolate based dessert."

"O: A very balanced beer, not too watery and not too heavy, but exactly in the middle experience. A very good beer with a real soul."

"T^his beer pours a nice medium dark brown with a medium head. It smells of fruit and spice. It tastes of fine malts-fruity and spicy. It is a bit thin in the mouth with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Its color is nice but I expected a yeast haze that I did not get perhaps it was just all stuck to the bottom of the bottle. Definatly on the sweet side for a hefe."

"Like its popular helles sibling, the dunkelweizen is one to respect. One to try."

"Overall a pretty nice beer but not the best of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This was a fairly simple beer. The flavors were not unpleasant, but were just middle of the road in both character and complexity. I would have preferred a little more carbonation and a touch of citrus flavor or something else to liven things up."
""
""
""
"Tastes reminded me of ciders with some caramel and hints of plums, though not overly sweet. Here the yeast is also a key player. Citric taste, more lime than orange. Slightly bitter and a bit toasted. Interesting beer."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with high to medium-high levels of carbonation. The result is a beer that is slightly fizzy, but quickly calms to a foamy, creamy, generally smooth mouthfeel. Modest wheat twang/tartness from mid-palate onwards. Finish is dry, with some residual stickiness across the palate. Quite up to style, and rather satisfying."

"O: Good drinkability. Smooth and pleasant beer. Paulaner quality. Recommended"

"Good but not that great however indeed a worthy pick, eminent aroma is the best part of it."

"O - This might not be the most flavourful weissbier dunkel, but it's probably my favourite. I love its smoothness and its great sessionability. It's a shame I can't get it in my region +("

"Overall:	It was great very refreshing and went well with some curry wurst."

"Dear Mom, I had a Paulaner Dunkelweizen today. Its the 5th Wheat Beer that I've had in two days. I am OD'ing on the banana clove thing mom - I can't feel it no more. The beer looked like rust coloured gravy with coagulated whipped egg on top. I didn't wanna do it mom but I had no other choice. It smelled totally generic for the style. Also of spoilt dough wafting with spent yeast. Tasted just like the other four I'd had. Sweet - sour, fizzy, caramelite - not bad mom but just that I wanted it no more. I like Paulaner beers mom, but it was the right thing at the wrong time. I'm sorry mom, but I will wean off wheat for a while and come back again. Come back and do justice to Paulaner Hefe Dunkel."
"O-Very easy to drink,but must admit,it hit's you in the head very fast. Neverless,you could drink it all day."
"After many lagers here in China, a grocery store had some more interesting beers. Paulaner Dunkel Weiss was kind of a disappointment though. I like their Hefe and was hoping for a yeasty flavored treat, but the yeast flavors took a back seat to the wheat in this beer. Still pretty decent but I probably won't have in a bottle again (maybe on tap!)."
"O/D - I could have a few but it was nothing overly special. Interesting dunkelweisse."
"Overall, although it provided some refreshment, this beer seemed a bit boring and disappointing to some extent."
"Pours hazy brown with a large, lasting head. Nose shows lots of doughy wheat, caramelised bananas and spicy phenols. Similar flavours, mainly doughy wheat with soft toasty malt also joining in. Quite light, very easy to drink. Carbonation is moderately high, which suits the flavours well."
"D- Very nice easy drinker. Could go through quite a few of these on a hot day."
"D - very very drinkable.. the taste of bread makes it heavy, however the banana and citruses makes it fresh and easy and it has not so high ABV, so very drinkable"
"Drinkability: I am savoring all of this bottle, but it feels so filling that I don't think I want more than one in a session. Easy to drink, but 0.5L is plenty for me."
"D: Wonderfully consumable. I could down glass after glass, but I'm not particularly sure why I'd want to. A very well-made beer, but kind of boring and nothing special. Still, a recommended dunkel if you're in the Bavarian neighbourhood."
"D: Quite drinkable. Not exciting in any way, but certainly pleasing."
"This is a decent Dunkelweizen, though it lacks a bit of character. I'll reach for the more interesting Paulaner Hefeweizen (Naturtrüb) next time."
"Overall a delicious summer beer with a hint of fruits and very refreshing"
"Overall a great, smooth beer, perfectly enjoyable by itself or with a meal. It's popular in Oktoberfest for a reason. Recommended."
"D: A very nice Dunkelweizen - a little of everything nice about the style. This is a must-try!"
"a great example of a the style but on the sweeter end that mutes a lot of the other possible flavors. nose of banana, apple, lemon and yeast and sweetness of wheat malt. palate is wheat malt first then a tad citrus cleaning followed by other fruit and zest of pine to clear the palate. for those that don't like sweet things you may really be disappointed. this is not a savory dunkel hef. and tastes a lot brighter and less syrup sweet on tap."
"Medium bodied and very easy to drink."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability: Personally I couldn't drink a 12 pack of any dunkelweizen, but then who would want to??? 2 or three would go down very well with a meal."
"Look: Copper color, balanced foam of head; Smell: Fruity with spices, invites you to drink it; Taste: Sweet and sour, something like tamarind; Mouthfeel: Citrus and refreshing, high carbonation and medium body; Drinkability: I really enjoyed with my meal."
"As expected this beer is a cloudy dull brown. There are lots a chunks of various size. It also came with 2 finger tan head that dissipated rather quickly. The smell is sweet banana bread, it is a very good Hefe smell. The taste is also almost entirely banana no clove at all. This is a very easy drinking and smooth Hefe. I look forward to another one of these."
"Dark cloudy chestnut beer, some carbonation at the botton, an off-white head with staying power. It smells like plums and caramel and dark fruits all with a smokey roasted edge and tastes the same, very much like a dark banana bread. You don't forget it's a wheat beer, and the mouthfeel is light, maybe even a bit too light--I found myself wanting more carbonation--but overall a highly drinkable beer, would love to try again, and could imagine some excellent food pairings."
"Serving type: 0,5 liter bottle, 0.55 purchased at the Getränke Bee around the corner from my house."
"Pours a cloudy dark orange, lots of brown highlights in the corners, very thick slightly off white head forms, very tall and creamy, slowly settles down to a thick ring and layer, good lacing everywhere. Smell is nice, but similar to their hefe, decent banana and a touch of clove, caramel, biscuit, yeast and wheat, a touch of chocolate, pretty solid aroma. Taste is similar, nice banana/caramel character, clove is light, biscuity malt middle, some light chocolate/roast character, quite yeasty, some wheat and very fruity in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation, pretty drinkable stuff."
"D: This is a nice Dunkelweizen. It has nice complexity of flavors and a low ABV that makes it an easy drinker. Overall, a solid discovery."
"OVERALL: This is a great representation of the style. It was very enjoyable and very drinkable, though it was perhaps a bit too sticky at the end and the colour wasn't ideal. Non-the-less, a complete pleasure that I'll be having again sometime soon."
"D- Goes down nice; good representation of dark weisbier."
"All I can say is gimme more."
"Drinkability : a solid Hefe and prbably the gold standard of hefe"
"It smells like bananas and Cocoa Crispies over a thin layer of peanut butter. The tall, creamy, light-tan head sits above the hazy chestnut colored beer. Soft and smooth mouthfeel with a moderately full body. Yeast and banana flavors up front mix with roasted malt. A hint of lemon merges in at the finish."
"Drinkability : a good hefe weiss dunkel beer brewered by Paulaner"
"This is a decent dunkel. It is a little smoky on the aroma but well balanced."
"A top tier commercial hefeweizen"
"see. I am looking forward to try the Aventinus."
"Taste has an average dose of banana and clove, layered on the grainy wheat backbone. The dark malts add a caramel and roasty, biscuity touch, even some candisugar, which obviously isn't in there. The yeast is quite fruity and gives a nice extra to the beer. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and somewhat sweet. A nice and decent beer."
"The aromas are of bananas, cloves, chocolate, wheat and caramel. Some other fruity aromas and flavors too. On mouth feels pretty much like the paulaner weiss, only a little more bitter: fruity, high carbonation, wheat, and malt tastes. Drinkability is great, pretty much of an easygoing, refreshing beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very smooth carbonation, and the drinkability is really good. I would have no problem enjoying more than one of these in a night."
"D- Drinkability is fine but i would want a dunkel with more character, franziskaner and erdinger beat this one for me. No chocolately notes in taste as i have experienced with other dunkels. An average one!"
"¡Salud!"
"D: Not very stimulating, but fairly drinkable."
"Notes - Good. Would have it again."
"Looking at the label of Paulaner Hefe-Weissbier Dunkel I noticed that it looks like the Bavarian version of the Last Supper (or last jug). It pours in a nice amber color with 1-2 fingers of foam, and smells like dark bread. The first taste is of sweet bread with a bitter aftertaste. But the bottle I had was too carbonated which gave it a bad mouthfeel, blocking the tastes. All and all, I have had many better weissbiers."
"One of the better weizens that I have come across."
"When I was in Germany this was my go to beer at all the places I went in Bavaria. Simply amazing. I brought a couple bottles back and waited a few months to taste them again and the flavor had definitely mellowed and lost a lot of its flavor. Still an amazing beer that its a shame they dont export."
"500 ml bottle, bought in Germany. Pours cloudy brown with an enormous offwhite head. Intense banana aroma with notes of caramel, toffee, chocolate and cloves. Refreshing hefe-weissbier flavour, with some extra notes of malts and dark bread, but light-bodied - if blindfolded, I might mistake the flavour for a pale hefe. I wouldnt mind having this beer as one of my ""regulars""."
"Fresh, smooth, not very complex, just roast and chocolate malt aroma and chocolate malttaste. Medium satisfying mouthfeel, great after Sushi with wasabi and ginger. Pure brown, lace. Dry aftertaste. Some malt, banana and citrus, bit of yeast. Well carbonated. Thanks Mark for bringing back from germany."
"Will be interested to try other examples of this style"
"This is not the best DW I have ever had, but it was worth the money and definitely worth another try."
"A beautiful brown copper color. The dense foamy head quickly fades into a thin collar. Carbonation wasnt as high as I expected. Very enjoyable smell, sweet wheat and and yeast, some nice roasted aspects too. I enjoy the malts and the way they are balanced; the darker malts take off from the beers refreshing aspect but maybe add some complexity to the brew. The wheat is less noticeable than in non dunkel hefe weizen, but some citric aspects still appear. A good beer, but I expected more of my first dunkel hefe-weizen."
"--Joey"
"Pours a dark cloudy amber colour into the glass, with alot of foam like all weissbier. It has a mild smell of yeast and malt, maybe some hint of citrus. The taste is the same as the smell. You can also feel a little bitterness in the after taste. A good beer but not as good as the naturtrüb."
"Unbalanced toward sweet."
"Smooth and refreshing with a citrus bitterness. Bitterness coaxed out with sliver of lemon. Slightly roasted flavor with hints of clove and vanilla. Very refreshing."
"This dunkel is pretty similar to the hefe-weissbier naturtrub. it pours a dark honey colour with a thick white foam head. the smell is slightly perceptible but it previews the soft, woody flavour with a very slight bitterness. It has a Full body; another good beer by paulaner, although not top notch."
"Pours a deep golden colour and is very murky. The head is limited, but what there is, does sit there for the duration. As for the taste, it leaves no doubt that it is a wheat beer... with after taste.The body is full. Really does nothing for me......but then again is not my style of choice..."
"Pours a cloudy light amber color, huge frothy off white head that lasts, fruity spicy aromas of apple, caremel and bananas. Sweet fruity wheat and caremel flavors, very spicy and yeasty. Medium body and has a soft and creamy and somewhat watery mouthfeel, very light and drinkable, I will have to try another bottle of this."
"Yummy little dark wheat, lots of banana, clove, wheat (of course) and chocolate, very smooth aswell, nice appearance, deepish brown, with a big rocky frothy head."
