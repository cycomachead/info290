3.58,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"A muddy dark brown pour with a nice wheaty smell. Slightly fizzy on the tongue, but with a very small head. Tastes of wheat, banana, and maybe tarragon (some kind of herb at least). Leaves a very mild sweet taste in your mouth after swallowing. My first ""dark wheat."" Would definitely drink it again and will try other dark wheat beers.","AUGRAD06","Beers"

3.77,9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D - Reminds me of a blend of brown ale and hefe. A little bit of a watery entry level beer but I don't like a lot of clove and banana so I am fine with that.","brewcrew76","Apr 29, 2010"
3.45,-0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A dark iced tea brown color with a thin fizzy cream-white head and minor traces of lacing. The aroma gives off sour apple/lime malt with an almost chocolaty hint. The flavor is also tart sour-mash with malt sweetness and a touch of herbal hop bitterness. It's pretty thin with a tingly near refreshing feel but a little limp for the style. I'm not sure this was entire on point even though it was supposedly a fresh bottle. Seemed more tart than normal. Nothing I would seek out but it was okay and i could drink a couple if that was the choice.","Durge","Apr 23, 2010"
2.36,-31.8,3,2,2.5,3,2,"As it is, I didn't finish my first bottle and I'm struggling through the second and the third... the third is being passed off on an unsuspecting soul or poured out without being drank. Shame.","errantnight","Mar 21, 2010"
3.68,6.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Taste is pretty well balanced, a bit of hop, a bit of malt and yeast. This is a very drinkable beer.","DAllspaw","Feb 06, 2010"
3.91,13,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Nice and drinkable. I have already recommended this to a few weiss-drinkers and would purchase again if and when the mood strikes. Another solid effort by Sprecher.","nsmartell","Jan 29, 2010"
3.75,8.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid to drink if you're in the mood for the style but there are others in the style that I would pick first.","TheManiacalOne","Dec 22, 2009"
3.95,14.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D - This is a pretty good dunkel weizen from Sprecher. It was quite tasty and fit the style nicely.","zeff80","Dec 21, 2009"
3.33,-3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"D: A good winter alternative for those who live for wheat beer. Low ABV makes this a session-able beer.","kylejohnson03","Dec 02, 2009"
3.85,11.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Great to get a BOTMC brew from Milwaukee where they have never quit making better (or drinking) beer. Here's to Milwaukee, lets give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a Belgian type brew smell with a pungent wheaty aroma. Poured into my trusty Spiegelau Weizbierglas yields a dark brown translucent brew with a creamy micro-bubble three-finger head. Head holds up like a champ. On first taste this brew is very balanced with a nice toasted malt sweetness but a good hoppiness. The wheat gives it incredible body and mouthfeel. The finish of this brew is more bitter, slightly dry with a aftertaste that is actually sweet. A great wheat a great dunkle and a very god brew.","mooseisloose","Dec 01, 2009"
4,15.6,4,4,4,4,4,"(D)- A good Dunkelweisse that has all the right stuff. Nothing fancy; just a good drinking beer. Solid stuff. Just as a side note: Sprecher normally does 16oz. bottles, why is this in 12oz.?","sweemzander","Nov 28, 2009"
3.33,-3.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall a less then stellar beer. Considering it comes from Sprecher I'm not surprised.","beerwolf77","Nov 02, 2009"
3.55,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkabilty - Maybe I just don't prefer this style of beer, but to me this was not that enjoyable. As stated it had a very odd, smoky, funkiness to it that I couldn't get past. I feel like I will be sitting on the other two of these that were sent in the BOTM club. Oh well, you can't like everything!","SpdKilz","Beers"
3.86,11.6,3,4.5,3.5,4,4,"D - It's a good fall transition beer. When you can't let go of the summer hefes but want to start welcoming in the darker, more substantial beers, grab one of these dunkels. Definitely worth picking up from their gift store. A nicely done and easily drinkable beer.","BeerFMAndy","0"
