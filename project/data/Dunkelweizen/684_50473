Aroma of toasted malt, mildly nutty, slight sour note. Flavor of toasted and caramel malt, hints of chocolate and charred coffee, finishes with light toastiness and light grassy hops. Medium bodied. The malt profile seems closer to a mild porter than a weizen; I'm not getting much wheat character at all. Flavor has nice toasty malt and light chocolate elements, but seems to finish thin with a light sourness. An OK dark malty beer, but not really meeting the dunkelweizen style, and a bit odd for that. This is the second Leavenworth wheat style ale that seemed to be more of a traditionally malted style than a weizen. Odd. OK, but better choices if you're looking for a dunkelweizen.","LiquidAmber","Feb 16, 2014"

Pours hazy reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of ripe banana, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, molasses, toast, clove, roasted malt, earth, and light yeast spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance. Taste of chocolate, banana, toast, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, roasted malt, toffee, pepper, earth, and light yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, banana, toast, nuttiness, and clove on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors with decent complexity; though it does feel a bit on the watery side; no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice and interesting take on a dunkelweizen. Nice roasted flavors with decent balance of fruitiness; very smooth and easy to drink. Definitely enjoyed this.","superspak","Beers"

2.36,-27.8,3,2,2.5,2,2.5,"Starts out with a great head, doesn't retain it as well as it might. Actually a little darker and hazier than I had expected from a dunkelweizen, I know it needs to be dark and wheat is gonna mean some haze, but I've seen beers in this style look a lot more inviting. Still, something I can look at and think yeah, I'll drink that. Little bit of malt and hops on the nose, no bananas or cloves or any fruitiness to speak of really. Taste leans pretty strongly toward sweetness, not real balanced, but not undrinkably sweet or anything. Slight bit of roast from the dark malts, no mistaking the wheat in the malt bill, but much like the aroma, nothing really going on in the taste that jumps up and says "good 'ol dunkelweizen!" The mouthfeel on this reminds me of just about every beginner homebrew with wheat extract: undercarbonated and thin. Altogether, not really the beer for me - I'll stick with the import classics where this style is concerned unless I get wind of any must-have USA iterations. That being said, the beer is not so much bad as it is not good - remember how much worse it could be. Below average? Yes. Undrinkable, terrible, should be forcibly removed from the market? Not in my opinion. Is it even a dunkelweizen? I dunno about all that...","kc44","Feb 17, 2012"

Light body, the lgiht citric/hefe characters are there, although no spice or wheat twang is really prevelant, and there is very minimal sweetness...like touches of toffee more than caramel or chocolate. Nice blend and balance so I don't mind sipping on it and there's touch of fruits and a dry malt base in the finish, but overall it's just too bland to be anything other than a half-decent beer.","clayrock81","Dec 13, 2011"
