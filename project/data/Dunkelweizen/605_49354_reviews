"Huge lingering beige head. Translucent cloudy brownish in color. Fine lacing as head diminishes. Some soapy qualities in head. Roasted malt and banana nose. Tasting cloves, coriander as well as some banana nut bread. Very creamy, lightly lingering carbonation and somewhat viscous in mouth feel. Leaves some acidity and drying sensation on my tongue. Overall, well balanced and not overly wheated. I admire many of Bayern's brews and applaud their adherence to the German purity law. I highly recommend this beer to followers of this style."

"This beer takes me back to my first visit to a pub in Dusseldorf. I learned later that the amazing beer from the wooden keg was called Altbier. Dragon's Breath is reminiscent of that beer - deep and rich in colour, slightly sweet nose, plenty of toasty malt flavour. I will freely admit that it's New Years and my taste buds may be somewhat dulled, so I will keep it short and sweet. Good beer - I'm looking forward to trying one with a clean palate tomorrow!"
"Overall – A pretty nice drinker overall with a good blend of wheaty and darker flavors all while keeping a good drinkability."

"It's a big and tangy brew with a lot of carbonation but the oxidized taste is more like an Old Ale. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Special Brews in Lynnwood, Wash."

"Got this from a friend from Montana. Murky dark brown-mahogany pour with a two finger creamy beige head with decent retention and nice lacing. Earthy, malty nose with hints of brown bread, subtle dark fruit, toffee, and a some metalic/mineral notes as well. The taste follows suit with lots of earthy, bready malts up front along with hints of molasses, brown bread, toffee, dark fruit, and a touch of banana. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and subtly creamy with good balance and drinkability. Overall, while this is not the dark Weizen I'm used to here in Germany, it's still a solid offering."

"O- A very nice and easy drinking dark wheat ale, which is a style I enjoy but don't see too often."

"This beer pours out a nice brown with a nice creamy brownish head with lots of lace. The smell is of fruits with a hints of nuts. Nice really malty taste that is just a touch sweet which I like in a nice dark wheat beer. Has a really smooth finish with a bit heavy mouth. For a dunkelweizen this is one of the better ones. Goes great on a hot summer afternoon with salsa and chips."

"O- This is a very highly drinkable ale in my humble opinion! I would have no problem enjoying this beer over the course of an evening and appreciate the well balanced nature of the brew! The alcohol is very well hidden, it's very flavorful and rich, yet it's also a very smooth and light on the palate. Now I can understand how this was brewed in Bavaria and won awards so many awards! I highly recommend this!"
"Overall: This beer is very unlike most wheat beers- which is okay by me, since the bananas and cloves can get to be tiresome. Another easy-drinking beer from Bayern."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a dark red amber with a thin off-white head that dissipates to a thin film and ring around the glass. Light aroma of toasted and caramel malt, dark fruit, wheat. Flavor follows with toasted and sweet malt, cloves, wheat and a hint of grassy hops. Light to medium bodied. Subdued, but very pleasant malt and wheat flavors, well integrated. As another reviewer noted, a nice light weizen beer, but the ""Dragon's Breath"" seems to indicate something a little more dangerous. A pleasant, low-key dunkelweizen."

"not sure why a german style dark wheat beer thats under 6% abv is called dragons breath, with flames all over the label, kind of gimmicky or misleading or something, but nevertheless, the beer isnt all that bad. i can see a thick layer of yeast or bottling sugar on the bottom of the bottle, but a careful pour yields a slightly murky dark brown thin liquid with a half inch of head that fades instantly. the nose is not real german yeasty at all, nor german malty really, more american medium roast barley, somewhere between a porter and a black ale in that regard, with some doughy yeast and a lightness not explained by the color. the taste is rather generic, and off the mark a bit for the style theyre calling it, but its a drinkable dark brew. yeast forward, but nothing too interesting. nice roast on the malt, slight chocolate note and a tad sweet at the end, still clean in the finish and easy to drink a fair few of these. i didnt love this one, but it served its purpose as the only non gold craft beer i could find at a town pump servo in colstrip, montana. wont seek this out again, but it didnt offend me by any means, and at under 8 bucks a 6 pack, i cant really complain..."

"Looking for a different kind of bock? Look here. This is not your typical clove-and-banana German Wheat beer profile. It’s more of a rustic Altbier yeast with some depth to keep things interesting."

"O- tasty, but don't go out of your way to get it. Subtle and fairly forgettable."

"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This beer is slightly disappointing and a tad watered down. I have tasted better Dunkelweizens."
"Maybe they should remove the heff from the label."

"This beer is truly unique. I have tried many good hefeweizen's in my day and this beer has a great heff flavor that hits you immediately, but there is much more to this beer than this first flavor lets on. After the first fairly normal, but good, hefeweizen flavor a darker malty taste starts to take over and blend with the wheat-like heff. This darker tone blends into the first flavor in a very bold way to give this beer a distinct, rare and bold taste. Dragon's Breath is definitely worth giving a try. I probably couldn't drink it on a regular basis but it is a solid beer that would be great every once in a while."

"Overall: Light bodied with moderate carbonationl. Not too bad here. Overall, not a real good dark hefeweizen.The flavors just clash rather than complement."
"O: Overall, this was a pretty good beer. Would drink again for sure, but it's not my first choice."
"Taste: dark malt, smooth, refreshing what, but comes across as very pedestrian. Eh, it's beer and you can drink it,..I guess. But doesn't do hardly a thing for me. No complexity, nothing special, bland as can be. Sorry."
"All in all, an interesting take. I feel like this follows the typical Bayern pattern of almost-awesome but just falling a bit short. The spice is a bit pungent for this one to work well... I could see myself drinking it again, but not my favorite dunkel."
"BTW - it's not really a dunkel, but rather a ""dark"" hefeweizen. That's why it seems a bit more restrained than dunkels that really pop with the flavors."
"Pours a murky, dark brown color with a large head that had good retention. Very little lacing is left on the glass. The yeast gave this beer a spicy note rather than a banana, bubblegum one. A little bit of dark wheat bread aroma but otherwise the smell is muted. The flavor also is a bit weak. The yeast does not add much to the flavor. Almost like it was brewed with an ale yeast. Some wheaty malt and a touch of spice and that is about all that there is in the flavor. Not bad but far from great. The body is alright but feels a bit watery. Nicely carbonated. Just a weak tasting wheat beer in the end. It drinks alright but why bother when there are far better ones in the market."
"Had a bottle from Princeton's. It poured a dark brown with a short light tan head. This tasted like a wheat porter at first, but then the malts seemed to fade away. It's not a bad dunkelweizen, but the flavors all around are a bit muted compared to other examples in the style like Franziskaner Dunkel. There's a bit of dark bread with spicy phenols. It's smooth and drinkable, but the whole character just isn't there."
"Appearance has a dark ruby red with a firm fluffy head that dissapates slowly leaving nill lace. Smell is lightly roasted with not much else as it is in the Taste as well, also having grain and light caramel with moderate hops. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Not a bad dark heff, but could use a little more compexity."
"D: Easy enough to drink. Perhaps not as stellar as the German iterations, but no slouch either. Dunkels aren't all that common out west, especially ones that stick to a truer, less-hopped recipe: in that regard a winner I'd enjoy again. Just not one that wins out over the Germanic originators..."
"Overall a pretty good beer. Not great but pretty good."
"An overall decent dunkel, but a bit too restrained, to live up to its moniker."
"Drinkability: The flavors are all present and accounted for but overall are quite muted which I suppose makes it easy to drink and the low ABV doesn't hurt either."
"Compared with previous dunkelweizens I have enjoyed, I thought this one was lacking a bit in terms of malt and was overly bitter. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the smooth mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is decent. Very bland, but not offensive."
"Update 10/3/10: Thanks to Miss Whitney for bringing me back another one of these that she grabbed on her vacation. Many kisses sugar. My first review holds up to my second experience with this brew, I'd like for it to available local to so I could drink it more regularly. Perhaps worth a trade."
"D: Pretty smooth and drinkable, not a lot going on so it makes it easy going down and the low abv makes it pretty quaffable."
"D - very drinkable, good flavor, i definitely want another"
"Taste cloves,banana,hint of carob like flavors to me.Not much lacing or head.muddy brownish red color.Best Bayern beer ive had yet really like it."
"Fairly easy drinking dunkelweizen, and not bad for this side of the Atlantic. I wouldn't mind sessioning this."
"The smell was of clove and the taste was real spicy. In the mouth it seemed to have a strong bitterness on the finish. It left the roof of the mouth tingling. It also had some dark fruit in the finish. Overall I am not well versed in this style but it was a pretty good beer."
"One of the best Dunkelweizens I have had. Something I would highly recommend."
"Drinkability- Very nice job by Bayern. I would buy this off an on for a change of pace beer if I lived back there."
"Huge tan head after the initial pour that recedes to a film after a couple of minutes. Very dark brown, almost muddy with a little cola. The taste has some nutty roasted malts, clove like yeast and a pretty dry middle and fiish. None of these flavors stand out, pretty subtle overall. But still an ok session wheat beer."
"the body is about the same as a hefe.. with maybe just a tad more from the leftover sweetness... the carbonation is about right too."
"D - A great beer, but not according to BJCP guidelines. A bit dark and overly bready for the style. A good beer nonetheless though."
"Though not as good as some German versions of the style, it is much more affordable and tastes pretty decent."
