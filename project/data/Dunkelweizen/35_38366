Roasty, warmly spiced characteristics. The aftertaste is sugary sweet, with some balance from spicing, but the sweetness wins out.

3.5,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served from bottle into a shaker. Poured brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bread, wheat, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, wheat, grain, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. While this was a decent example of the style, it really didn’t stand out from others I have had. There were some good things going on here with the bread and wheat, but also some things that it could have done without as in the earthiness. While it was nice to have something different going on, it can also hurt a brew unfortunately. Worth trying at least once to judge for yourself, but I doubt I will be having it again if I am completely honest as there are better easy to get ones out there.","thagr81us","Oct 18, 2012"

Clove and banana, my two least favorite beer flavors coming in for the tag team. The taste is more restrained than the nose, with roasted barley and caramel malts working with the banana and slight clove flavor, along with some nutmeg. The mouthfeel is light and velvety, and the drinkability is decent. Not my favorite Sam, but it's probably a decent representation of a style that isn't really for me.","shand","Oct 15, 2012"

The mainstay of the brew's flavor and aroma is a strong and sweet banana-bubblegum flavor. The bubblegum note intensifies upon the finish.

Taste: an almost bubble gum (!) like quality to the clove sensation that dominates; malts provide a pleasant underpinning...

The smell screams German hefe yeast, with a decent dose of funk (a word I've never used in relation to a Sam brew) and earth to burn. The first sip feels surprisingly slick, but the sweetish finish hangs on longer as the glass warms. The hops are appropriately restrained to let a decent yeast strain shine, though I wouldn't mind seeing a deeper malt platform.

Aromas are predominately of toasty wheat and yeast, with a fair amount of cloves. First thing that jumps out to me is not how the beer tastes, but how it feels. Texturally, as with with many Sam Adams, it is nearly perfect: a medium body is carbonated such that it feels electric at first and becomes sumptuously smooth as it washes over the tongue. The flavors are certainly good and consistent with the nose, and is just a tad less complex and interesting than those of my favorite dunkelweizens.","droomyster","Sep 13, 2010"

Its wheatey with the banana and cloves, with the spice, like the smell, but the wheaty taste is a little... toasty and malty? Mouthfeel is medium light, with average carbonation. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer to drink. I would definitely buy these if you could get them outside of the Sam Adams Harvest seasonal pack. I enjoy wheat beers and this was a nice variation.

Everything that the nose found can be found on the tongue, banana, cloves, and belgian yeast. Add in some carmel and you've got a nice little dunkel here.

The taste however is right on par with what I am looking for. Big bold lemony banana and toffee flavors with a bright acidity that wakes up the palate. Fresh flavors of banana peel, orange zest and maybe some milk chocolate. Mouthfeel works for me. It's carbonated well just not like traditional dunkleweizens.

It is almost as though they used a neutral American yeast strain, instead of a German weizen yeast. The taste is like the aroma. Again, I'd like to see more banana bread flavors, and some clove too. The malt flavors that are present are nice though. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but lacks the chewy texture that I expect in a weizen.

I squeezed the two bottles from the fall Harvest sampler pack to find one of the most inviting looking dunkelweizens I've seen in awhile. Big amber brown clouded body with a billowing cream tarnished head that rises above the rim of my 1/2 liter Ayinger weissbier glass. Lacing is even and fine with intricate detail, beautiful looking brew. Aromatics come with a touch of raisin and tart sliced green apples, a bit of clove, banana, and bubblegum as well. Even some mango juicy characteristics arise with further sniffs. A touch of herbal hops in the nose with a nice roasted malt edge on the biscuit and wheat malt profile. Flavor is perfect none of that traditional Sam Adams house yeast this one is authentic German weissbier yeast, brings out all of those great phenols. Juicy sweetness with roasted malt edge brings to mind brown sugar sprinkled banana bread with sliced green apple tartness, and mango fructose complexity. Herbal hops for balance with big yeast characteristics finishing sharply wheaty with drying yeast components. Mouthfeel is perfect with effervescence in the carbonation and medium to lighter bodied. Nothing cloying or heavy on the palate, perfect version of the style. Drinkability is crazy, a beer they will be successful with if released in six packs on it's own.

The taste is as a good dunkel weizen should be...cloves and bananas with dark malts popping through but it doesn't quite get to the ""fresh banana bread"" ideal...in this case, there is some burnt rubber in there as well..something that either my taste buds have gotten more sensitive to over the last 3 years or some mutation that has been going on with a prominent manufactured yeast strain.

Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Pretty darn drinkable. Not at all a bad example of the style - a welcome addition to the Samuel Adams fall line-up!","MrHurmateeowish","Aug 27, 2009"
4.6,32.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Light bodied and an easy drinker. Clean, malty/wheaty and crisp. One of the best dunkelweizens I've had. Some may not like it because there isn't a giant slug of yeast in the bottle. But me and my stomach are happy it isn't there.","mschofield","Aug 26, 2009"
3.3,-5.2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall, a decent offering from Sam Adams, although I was disappointed. The Michelob offering is a better value.","Gosox8787","Aug 23, 2009"
3.88,11.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"A refreshing treat but I'm not a big fan of the style.","JoeyBeerBelly","Aug 23, 2009"
4.15,19.3,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Taste is smoky and excellent. Better than most American Hefeweizens and well worth the effort. Stands on its own and will hopefully move out of the mixed 12 pack.","tvljr","Aug 21, 2009"
3.95,13.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"High drinkability though a bit more malt would be nice. Tasty Dunkelweizen though it is decidedly dry for the style.","Zorro","Aug 18, 2009"
3.98,14.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall, definitely worth picking up a 12 pack for (in my opinion anyway). If you like hefeweizens and dunkels like I do, be sure to grab this","tzieser","Aug 18, 2009"
4.85,39.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"SA hit a homerun with this one.","OverToad","Aug 17, 2009"
3.65,4.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I will admit that I have not had a lot of Dunkelweizens, so my tasting experience on the style is quite limited. But this is a decent tasting beer. Not going to knock your socks off, but is worth checking out as it is a solid effort from Sam Adams.","OldSchoolGamer","Aug 16, 2009"
4.31,23.9,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I liked the smokieness to it but needed a bit more of it to really describe this brew. This needs to be added to the Brewmaster collection","Duhast500","Nov 16, 2008"
4,14.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured an extremely dark color when only held up to light, it would reveal a dim ruby hue. Nice dead that subdues after a while leaving minimal lacing. Smell is of roastiness like a stout with some lactose ala cream stout along with that banana-ry aroma. Beautiful aroma. Flavor also has that banana ester flavor up front ala Aventinus but also comes with a roastiness. This beer is like a cream/milk stout mixed with a dunkelweizen. Unlike anything I have ever tasted before and absolutely marvelous. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation and very smooth. Extremely drinkable. Wonder what the abv% is?","Doomcifer","Dec 24, 2007"
3.91,12.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I am really impressed with this style. After searching out other traditional Dunkelweizens, I am unsure that Boston Beer version would show up a true German Dunkel, but it was a great representation of the style nonetheless. I hoped this would make the Beer Lovers choice to just to expose others to this wonderful style of beer.","trkerrigan","Oct 13, 2007"
3.7,6.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Another interesting Americanized version of a German style. Not the full Dunkelweizen that a Schneider-Weisse would be, but tasty and unique enough for me to cast my vote for it. Vote Sample B in '07!","Gambrinus1184","Sep 20, 2007"
4.4,26.4,4,4,4.5,4,5,"I voted for the Dunkelweizen...however it is a shame both beers can not be added to the collection.","WilliamPhilaPa","Aug 24, 2007"
