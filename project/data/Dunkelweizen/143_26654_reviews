"Update 2011-01-27: Stopped into the LBS and mentioned that this beer has been long discontinued, yet I just bought one here. Was told that the distributor is selling them and had a six plopped down in front of me. Picked up a bottle and it's clearly stamped ""03-20-2008"". No real concern from the LBS about it; rather an attitude of ""we stock whatever the distributor gives us and we don't pay that much attention""."
"More dunkel in the straight lager sense than a weizen, I feel. Good, and pretty drinkable, but... eh."
"D : About what I expect from Shiner (except for their anniversary beers), it's nothing special and I'd turn to something else instead."
"Eric"
"Full and rich mouthfeel, finishes bubbly and tingly. Decent beer, pretty drinkable."
"D - This is a pretty good dunkel and one of the better brews from Spoetzl Brewery."
"This is a good beer that I could enjoy anytime."
"D: A misleading dunkelweizen. Tastes very similar to the style, yet doesn't look and feel like one. Easy to have more then a few of these."
"O- The drinkability is pretty high I would say, based on its overall lightness/thinness. Not overall an excellent beer, but not bad. It's not like previous dunkels I've had before. Seems like a good intro into quality beer, though maybe not the best example of a dunkel out there."
"D - A drinkable beer."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this isn't really one that I would want to drink again."
"Mightily impressed with the beer. It's not quite a dunkelweizen, but would make a nice German Dunkel. Solid malt backbone with mild graininess, hints of toffee, bread, and clean malt flavors. Lacks any wheat character at all -- not fruitiness, esters, phenolics, or wheat flavor. Clear appearance with a solid brown tint and moderate head retention. A little light in the body, allows graininess to come through. Finishes with a clean, sweet malt taste."
"Served in my Harpoon IPA glass (I really need to buy some weizen glasses). Poured a dark amber; almost brown in color. Half-inch off-white head subsided into a thin skim of foam almost immediately and then nothing. Nose is hard to place; malt I guess. Flavors are predominantly malt, but it was very difficult to detect other flavors due to the slightly metallic taste at finish; kind of like pennies. Pleasantly effervescect mouthfeel, but drinkability is seriously compromised by the aftertaste."
"Nice dark color but not very much head. The smell was nice, had a little roasted aroma to it. Taste was decent but fairly bland with some more roastyness. Mouthfeel was ok also, a little bitter, can't taste the alcohol. Fairly drinkable, but not much to write home about."
"Amber to crimson shades in a weizen glass with a tall beige head. Actually, a nice looking beer. Smell is a touch metal, very light roast malt. Taste is a bit watery, yet somewhat creamy, very mildly flavored with a lightly bitter and tart malt flavor. Not really getting a lot of wheat, really. Not too familiar with the style, but this probably isn't the best example. Drinkable, but unremarkable."
"My favorite part of this beer was the aftertaste, which used to be very sweet on your lips. This year's batch tastes very ""skunky"". I was very dissappointed."
"A decent brew, it reminds me some of a dopplebock than it does a wheat beer. A solid brew that's worth the try even if it is a little scattershot on the style chart."
"Because Shiner Hefe-Weizen (along with 98 Bavarian Style Amber) is my favorite Spoetzl brew, I thought they'd do a pretty job with their dunkelweizen. Uh... no. I'd recommend going back to the drawing board and rethinking this whole thing."
"Poured into a mug, this is somewhat light in body for a winter brew. Chocolate in the nose, the palate is doughy but not very complex. Well assembled, this may not be on the level of say Aventinus or Erdinger, but from a dignified brewery in Texas, this is very impressive indeed. In fact, I really have no beef with Spoetzl Brewery's products. They are a real brewery with a real personality. This dunkel is good, their Bohemian Black Lager is an American schwartz beer classic."
"d: Would benefit from more complex flavors, but overall its not too bad. Simple and easy drinking, it wasn't bad, but I probably won't buy it again."
"Poured out a clear dark amber beer with a nice fluffy one finger head. Smell of sweet malt. Mouthfeel is surprisingly a bit creamy. Drinkability is ok. Seems to be a weak version of the style,,not a bad beer but there are better versions of the style."
"Appearance is dark amber, garnet with very little head. Aroma is pleasant, somewhat sweet and toasty. Taste is taosty, oaty, malty, with a little bitterness. The sweetness and maltiness dominates, but the aftertaste is a bit bitter and leaves a bit of smokiness. Mouthfeel is bubbly and smooth. The beer feels a bit overcarbonated to me. It is tasty and quite drinkable, but not exceptional. If you are a Shiner devotee this might be a nice way to vary your consumption a bit, but I wouldn't recommend seeking it out. I will probably buy it again, but it is not one of my favorites."
"This beer was a nice find. I was not expecting it to pour so darkly (between the color of a bock and a nut brown ale). The beer poured with a thin head that dissipated quickly into lacing. The smell was good, of wheat, yeast, and sweetness. The taste was pretty darn good, almost tasted like a brown ale mixed with a wheat. I was very surpised at how refreshing this beer was. I will definitely purchase this beer again."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a pub glass. Poured a dark cola color with a tan 1-finger head. This beer has a slight wheat smell to it and has the flavor of a pale hefe-wiezen, with a little carbonation. There is a slight wheat and malt smell to it. Overall this is a very drinkable beer."
"Overall, I enjoyed this a lot. Not the best beer or Dunkelweizen, but a good version by an American brewery. Pick this up instead of Shiner Bock when it is in season."
"Being from Texas i always enjoy a good shiner. Wasnt able to taste it at the brewery, but picked up a 6 pack. It pours a nice reddish amber color and doesnt have much head. The taste and smell are kinda fruity and nutty. The mouth feel is ok and it can easily been drank."
"This isn't bad, its highly sessionable, but it just doesn't have any flavor or smell... Its weird, it pours so nice. Its as if someone stole the flavor from the bottle!"
"Drinkability - Great beer to drink, not too filling but just right"
"You won't confuse this bier with a good German dunkel wiezen like Weihenstephaner or Franzisckaner (sp?)."
"Having always been able to either tolerate or enjoy all of the beers from the Shiner line I picked up this dunkelweizen along with their Schwarzbier awhile back. Pours a ruby brown cranberry hue with a thin off white beige head leaves thin trickled lacing all around my wheat beer glass. Aroma contains mild metallic notes with a muted chocolate and toasted nut with caramel drizzled on the load of fermentable sugars provided from the roasted malts balanced with mild herbal hops almost minty again this is tame with not much yeast fruitiness going on here. Flavor my beloved clove and banana yeast traits are absent, it tastes more like a dunkel lager clean roasty mild chocolate, with caramel malt sweetness and a touch of toasted nut quality with a light dose of herbal finishing hops. Mouthfeel is very thin bodied for a dunkelweizen light to medium bodied range with no effervescence typical of the style standard moderate carbonation here. Drinkability poor lacks the standard challenging and refreshing characteristics typically found in a dunkelweizen."
"This was ok, but maybe a little boring. Nothing really stood out. Not bad, but if you want a really good Shiner beer, try the Shiner 97 Bohemian Black Lager (schwarzbier). That stuff is fine. Not much head and it left quickly. Lacing was minimal. Decent dunkelweizen but nothing to write home about."
"What this beer lacks in overall talent, it makes up for in gumption. This is by far Spoetzl's most ambitious (and possibly most talented) brew, and many could do well to follow its example."
"Drinkability: Not ""off"" by any means. Just way off the mark for a dunkelweizen. I wonder what kind of yeast they use for this..."
"Drinkability -- This is an OK beer. Not a dunkelweizen in the traditional sense, or in the sense that I recognize a dunkelweizen. I kept waiting for this beer to ""open up"" and it never did. Unfortunately, not much for me to come back for."
"All in all a very drinkable brew."
"Light body, not enough carbonation. Still, this was tasty, if not seeming to be in the style. Certainly worth trying, and one of the better Shiner beers for me."
"D- light taste and body make it drinkable"
"The flavor is not as rich or malty as the nose suggests, but there is a clearly wheat-like character to it; and the traditional Bavarian wheat-yeast characteristics are missing (banana/clove), but they're generally restrained within the dunkle style anyway. It's nicely balanced with a sturdy bitterness beneath; and some spicy and grassy/floral hop character gives it some depth and off-sets the dark cocoa component. It finishes dry with a dusting of cocoa and a smattering of grassy hop flavors."
"Drank really easy, probably not yeasty enough for most purists, but not a bad beer to knock with some brisket or pizza or to enjoy watching a sunset or football game. I'll take ths over their ""so called"" bock any day!"
"this is a really nice looking beer that has a nice dark amber color to it, it poured out with little head and has no lace.I could smell a hint of alcohol in it and there is a faint smell of wheat mixed in the aroma. It has a smooth feel to it, not crisp but not dull either, it goes down smooth and has a mild alcohol after taste."
"drinkability is good. it's missing some of the characteristic weizen character, but has a great solid malt body. enjoyable."
"A highly drinkable German style brew brewed right here in Central Texas! Not the best, but a very good interpretation of the style."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep amber, forming a thick 2 inch head, leaving nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is of slight fruit notes. The mouthfeel is light, but average for the style. The taste is like Shiner bock, but with the addition of a light fruity backdrop. Not a bad brew, but not exactly something that I could drink a sixer of in one setting. An okay offering from Shiner."
"Apple phenol comes out as the beer warms."
"A good Dunkel, that could be world class with some tweaking. Recommended."
"Average dunkel weizen. Not as bad as the hefe weizen (or renamed American Wheat beer). Highlights of this beer is the sweeter malt component. Not much hoppiness to balance it, which is a good thing for those who like that style. Consider it an American Dark Wheat ale."
"D: Eh... could do or could not do."
"12 oz. with no freshness date and a blurb about the beer being krausened. It pours a crystal-clear, radiant amber with a good amount of carbonation and a finger of tan head, with an aroma of overripe fruit and molasses. On the palate, it has light carbonation on top of a medium body and tastes of molasses, ripe banana, mild wheat and apple, and spicy hops that leave a mild bitterness and finish. First off, this should be unfiltered, and second, it doesn't taste enough like a wheat beer. They make a pretty decent hefe so I figured this one would be on the same level, but it falls short."
"Overall, it's not great for its style, but for the price i'd say its quite good. if it was available around here, i could see buying this in a pinch more often than not."
"Opinion: This is pretty typical of Spoetzl brewing. It is pretty thin and uneventful with some flavors that are out of balance with the rest of the beer. I have drank numerous DunkelWeiss beers in Bavaria, and this beer comes as close to a DunkelWeizen as their Bock is to a true German Bock. This is a drinkable beer, but I would prefer something with a bit of depth and some real flavor. I won't be drinking this often, I tell you."
"A nice American adaptation of a dunkelweizen. Not nearly as much character as some I've tried, but German wheat beers aren't my favorite style so that doesn't particularly bother me. Quite tasty."
"There were several places where this faltered: 1) hardly any wheat characteristics; 2) filtered (and it doesn't help that Shiner's yeast strain is boring, to begin with); 3) hop bitterness had too much presence. Really this just reminded me of a sub-par Munich dunkel lager."
"Actually one more thing worth noting is that I tasted it when it first was sold in Oklahoma and wasn't impressed with it, but now it seems much better (even past the expiration date). Either this beer improves with age or I got a bad six-pack before."
"The beer after its extraction from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a deep clear brown, with a portly semi-creamy light tan head that after its dissipation leaves an obfuscating sheet of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet with malt and a hint of toasted wheat, also seems like a little caramel, fresh an pleasing to the senses at any rate, start is somewhat sweet with a fair to middling grain presence, and the top middling in feel. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops subdued as one would expect, very dry and clinging aftertaste, a drinkable beer."
"Good Spring beer if it's still a bit chilly outside, but warm enough for wheat beer."
"I am not entirely impressed with any Shiner beer I have had. This one also falls into that ""not memorable"" character as much of the other Spoetzl beers do."
"The best Shiner I've had so far. Nice head. Pretty dark and reasonably carbonated. Has the typical ""shiner"" taste, but is not as prevalent as the original bock. Live other shiners, the alchohol is not to strong. It is worth a try sometime, you could do far worse than this beer."
"The taste carries that toasted wheat with a sweet side. Hints of toffee, caramel, honey and spice. The mouth is left with a cream like feel with hints of malts left behind. Overall, drinkable as well."
"Body is medium, creamy texture with big bubbles lending an expansive mouthfeel that ends up flat."
"Looks like coke and bourbon with a nice white head. Smells of wheat and light fruit citrus touch. The flavor is pretty forgettable, some sweet wheat malt and a slight undercurrent of dark malt flavor, but nothing really screaming out good, but nothing bad either. Thin in the mouth makes for a bad impression, but good for drinkability. It is what it is and that ain't much."
"This plenty drinkable, but not crazy good either."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer that works well on cooler evenings in late fall."
"Very nice deep, chestnut brown color with a great head that lasted a while. Good aroma-somewhat sweet and malty. Very slight yeast and phenolic notes. Good malty flavor. None of the usual characteristics you would find in a German dunkelweizen. Finishes slightly dry. Good mouthfeel. Overall a decent dunkelweizen. Im not a huge fan of weisse beers period though I find US versions palatable. I wasnt impresed with this at first but its actually quite a good beer."
"D - Overall it was ok. Nothing too fancy, but an ok beer to have every now and then. Ofcourse, it was a little better than what I thought it would be."
"Received this beer when I ordered the ""pot luck"" special at Mitch's Tavern. Nothing special, somewhat deviant from the style, but not bad."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"12 ounce brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a rich, dark reddish brown with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Nice sweet, toasty malt aroma with a little caramel and toffe in the background. Taste very much like it smells, rich and malty with just a little hop bitterness. Very clean finish. A good, solid offering from the folks at Shiner."
"Overall impression: I actually drank most of this six pack straight from the bottle, and after taking the time to review this one, I think that is the best way to drink this beer. It is highly drinkable, but no outstanding qualities. Nice session beer, but nothing to specifically seek out."
"Formerly the Shiner Winter Ale, renamed and repackaged with a recent label facelift. Why the label has Austin's Congress Street bats on it I can't figure, as the town of Shiner is 80 or so miles southeast."
"Rather mundane beer from a rather mundane brewery. Really tastes more like a warmer than a dunkleweizen."
"This is Shiner's Winter Ale rebranded, which I never tried."
"A very disappointing beer from Shiner, which has generally improved their line in recent years."
