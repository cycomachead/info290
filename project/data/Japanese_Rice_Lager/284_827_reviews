"Over the average good taste and feel."

"I intended to review this beer at Tsunami Sushi & Asian Cuisine, but since they gave away my Valentines Day reservation (bastards!) I had to settle for a can from Publix. By the way, bonus points for the insanely sturdy can. If I ever get in to a bar fight, screw the bottles, give me a Sapporo! The beer doesn't have the same constitution as the can though. It's comparable to your average domestic macro lager. Pours with a transparent, fizzy yellow-water appearance with active carbonation and several inches of nice, frothy, snow-white foam. Quality lacing remains as the snow cap cover gradually melts away. The mild, unoffensive aroma whispers of soft grain. Not much going on in the nose. Traces of hops, and perhaps a touch of fruitiness. Super clean. The first sip has me thinking of cork. A husky cork-like flavor and a little woody accent ride over mild malt sweetness. A bit dry, with an interesting complimentary bitterness. Nicely balanced with a clean finish that hints at white rice in the aftertaste. Adequate body and carbonation produce a light but respectable texture. This would have been the perfect palate cleanser to the shrimp tempura that I never got to eat."

"It's just a standard lager. Not overly refreshing, not overly tasteful. Wouldn't turn my nose to it, but wouldn't look for it."

"Average beer, better than american domestic drafts but only drink when it is the only option"

"lifeless and flat taste. carbonation okay. Color clear. okay for a light beer,  but if you getting the steak its not a great pick.  get the sushi."

"C'mon, people. It's THE sushi joint beer of choice. Kirin Ichiban? Please. That said, I'd never order one of these outside of a sushi restaurant, despite that oh so sexy looking can. You should always drink the same beer as the cuisine you're eating, IMO."

"The body is light and goes semi-dry only toward the finish. It's quite crisp all the way, and more than moderately clean. It's got a bit of smoothness to it as well. Alcohol surprises with some unexpected heat partway through."

"DATE TASTED: December 1, 2013... GLASSWARE: standard pilsner...OCCASION: Christmas tree-trimming and decorating... APPEARANCE: clear as crystal golden body; thin, filmy, off-white head; steady effervescence; thick, screening lacing is surprisingly attractive... AROMA: malty base; some bubblegum and dough--not really articulated... PALATE: a bit creamy; crisp and clear--surprisingly smooth...TASTE: woody aftertaste follows a swift, slightly metallically hopped profile; as macro lagers go, inoffensive...OVERALL: a good compliment for the pita chips I'm eating now--palate-cleansing and soft..."

"I drink this when we go out to Asian places for dinner. Its OK, I like it, nothing special. Similar to a Coors Lite but with more aluminum in the flavor. Light, very easy to drink, slight hops. Price for what you get is debatable. If you find it at a good price by all means try it, but as an import its going to be more expensive when you can usually find a happy hour Coors Like for more then half the cost of this."

"Over all not a bad brew given the proper setting. Went very well with stir fry veg and sea scallops."

"There is a good maltiness and lacks hoppiness. However, the drinkability makes it a go to for me as an adjunct lager."

"Poured from a can into a pilsner, the beer is an extremely light, pale, clear, yellow coloring with a tall, foamy, light, white head. Roasty and grainy aromas, but light overall. Flavors are light, with a grainy profile, and a slight lemon highlight. The aftertaste is toasty and slightly cereal, with a crisp, clean finish. About what is expected from a rice brew."

"Blue Sushi in Omaha had these on special for $1 so I figured I couldn't go wrong. I guess you get what you pay for though. I have never really looked into Japanese beer before so I was excited to give this one a try. Turns out it is pretty much the Japanese equivalent to an American Macro Brew. This beer had no smell to it whatsoever and tasted pretty much the same. I can't complain to much for a buck, but I won't ever be drinking this one again."
"Had this one while enjoying some Thai food. Good thing the food was good... Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a golden yellow with a minimal white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, and subtle fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, subtle banana, and very subtle fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was not really anything to get excited about. This is basically the BMC of Japan I'm guessing and it lets you know this with similar flavors. However, the fruit hints I got were a nice touch, but did not do anything well enough for the beer to save it. Will not be having again."
"O - Predominant rice additions don't hinder this defect-free beer for me. For the style, it's delicious and damn if it isn't refreshing after a long day at work. Thank you sir, may I have another?"
"O: Interesting Japanese Rice Lager – one of the few that I’ve had. It was a nice beer on a hot summer day, but nothing I would grab again."
"Beer is medium to light in body and sweet throughout, The finish is mildly dry and not too bad. All of these Sapporo beers are identical IMO. Just different cans."
"Pours a fizzy yellow hue. Typical adjunct lager look. Mild carbonation and a one finger head. Smeels of corn syrup and rice. Taste is similir, cornsryup with just a touch of rice at the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied. Overall a decent beer for a party."
"T: It's actually not that bad. There isn't a lot of flavor here, but it's crisp and clean and doesn't get incredibly undrinkable as it warms. One of the better lagers in mass production. Light citrus and pale malts along with the slightest bit of grassy hops."
"Pours a nice one finger head, it's really frothy and it looks like it's giving me good lacing. It's diminished substantially since I poured it, but it's still leaving a good layer on the top of the body. The body is piss yellow and completely see through, it looks like a standard macro lager, accept for the decent lacing. Overall not a very good look, but the lacing is nice. There is some crisp hop on the nose, along with a sweet and sour malty smell. Smells like a lager, but one tiny step above the rest because I can get some hops on the nose. Overall the smell is very faint, but it smells decent when I can smell it. Yeah, there is for sure a nice hop character in this beer, when you compare it to a budwieser or some macro beer like that. It's a pretty small hop flavor, but that's really ok, because it's a lager. Overall the flavor is pretty simple, there is for sure a malt flavor, and on some sips you pick up significant alcohol, considering it's only 5%. You can tell the beer is made with rice, but really it doesn't bother me because it's not like they are trying to cut cost, that's just the style, where as when it's used in an american macro, they are trying to cut cost, and it doesn't work with the beer. Mouthfeel is decent, pretty thin and a little watery, but the carbonation is just perfect. The drinkability is pretty damn nice too, there really isn't anything wrong with this beer, so it's not hard to drink, and it's pretty light. Overall, I good lager, and since it's mass produced, a very good macro lager. Not an amazing beer, but one I wouldn't mind having, especially over a normal macro lager."
"(D)- It fits its style easy enough, but not much really going on with this at all."
"mouthfeel/drinkability; a bit more substance than one would expect for such a light colored beer. Almost creamy but some fizzy qualities thin it out a bit. Quite crisp and refreshing. Really not that good in my opinion but not bad either. I would definitely buy again if I was having some sushi, would make a nice pairing."
"Easy drinking beer makes this good for summer. Of course it's a staple at many sushi restaurants as well."
"The brew is really light and easy drinking, not something I would seek out; this style brew to me is boring. But honestly, I would rather have this then an american macro brew."
"D - I tried it and now know I don't like it."
"For a sushi pairing, this beer is fine. By itself I wouldn't buy it, but I'll give it an average rating."
"I would call this a very good candidate for the beer geek's lawn mower beer. Deserves to be quaffed at a very cold temperature. By itself, I would not enjoy this beer, however, I had it with a big plate of sushi and it was a perfect match."
"D: A fair lighter lager, lighter than regular Sapporo or Reserve, basically Budweiser with a Japanese label."
"D - Not bad, definitely a decent session beer but I would not drink it again."
"This beer is a mystery! But finally I got the urge to get this at my job, and take it home. Awesome beer! Nice gold color, sweet malt, foamy white head, decent lacing, floral or buttery taste that lingers, kind of waxy after taste, and very drinkable. This beer is one of the few that I have encountered better out of a can!"
"Drinkablity: Tasty Sapporo brew. Slightly crisper than standard Sapporo. Very easy drinking."
"Drinkability: Pretty good for quenching the thirst, light and inoffensive tastewise."
"-RR"
"Comment: This beer is refreshing and light with a good mouthfeel and drinkability. A good beer, plus the can is pretty unique."
"A pretty good beer for the style anyway. Easy to throw back a couple with some sushi or tenpura. Not going to blow anyone away though."
"D- Overall I wasn't impressed. It tasted like a ricey version of the American Macro light beers."
"The can that it comes in is it's best attribute IMO, really cool looking can. The color was pale as expected. I didn't note a real distinct flavor that would make it enjoyable to me. Mouth feel was pleasant and finished dry. For it's style it certainly is right on and in the right circumstance, such as a sushi restraunt it has it's place. Just not a favorite style for me."
"If there was a score for making the beer bland and taste like nothing: 5/5"
"A little different. But I could drink a couple of these in a sitting."
"D- If paired with food or a hot day, it would be pretty sessionable, but this is must a touch to thin."
"Cheers!"
"Smell and taste are both grainy the whole way through. Lots of dry rice flavors in there with a solid crispness bringing it all together. There's really no complexities to this beer, and it's kind of nice. It's very humble."
"Could drink more than one of these if desired"
"I buy this beer today,does not have any date on the bottle and other thing that i found interesting is that the bottle says ""japan's oldest brand"" but the one that i have was brew in Canada.. I put the beer on a mug. It have a gold color with a white head that leaves inmediatlyThe smell is nothing to be impress about.Good taste ,i taste like honey just i little bit but is there. This beer would be good will fish. I would drink this beer again."
"This is maybe one step above the American macros which isn't saying much. If it wasn't for the sushi I probably wouldn't drink it."
"This is my choice whenever I have Japanese food, or even just some sushi. This rice lager pours and light pale yellow with a quick head and plenty of carbonation. It's good with a lot of rice and a clean scent. The taste is clean and a bit sweet, a fantastic compliment to sushi, tempura or teriyaki. Very refreshing and it balance out wasabi perfectly. Quite drinkable and I'll usually put away a couple of these with some good toro, uni and ikura!"
"Pours a light straw color, with little head. Slightly sweet, reminded me mostly of an American macro lager, except with more carbonation, which created an interesting, crisp mouthfeel. Malts are evident in the smell and taste. Good when very cold. Props to Sapporo on the bullet can, and making a decent rice lager."
"Taste was grainy like corn or rice. I would call this a green taste, very little bitter and aftertaste is dry. Every sip this beer is starting to bore me more and I can't imagine drinking this all night."
"D- If I wasn't eating Hibachi, I wouldn't normally drink Japanese Lagers. This is fine for mass consumption but I will stick with domestics for that since these can be spendy. Asahi is better for food IMHO but try both or Kirin to find what you like most."
"Very drinkable, I could have had several but since we were just out for dinner I had to settle for two."
"Best Japanese beer I ever had."
"Lowlights: It was yellow, fizzy and devoid of any real smelling or tasting notes."
"Unimpressed."
"Pours pale straw, with an slightly imperfect clarity. Soapy two and a half-finger head, fades quickly to dismal lacing. Clean nose, some rice adjunct possible. Pale malt taste, with plenty of rice adjunct flavor. Aftertaste is dry, with a husky astringency that has a bite to it; yet not quite harsh. Both tiny flowing and rapid and large chunky bubbles make a high carbonation in a thinnish body. Mouthfeel is somewhere between crisp and rough. Finishes clean with a touch of rice adjunct but fairly drinkable for a rice lager."
"Hops are not found, body is light and is drinkable."
"rather clean tasting. sort of light vinegary twang (acetic acid?) in the finish. some fruit characteristic again too. not terribly enjoyable."
"I struggled to down the last half of this beer. Is this the worst beer I've ever had? I'm not sure...but it's definitely a top contender."
"I have held out on reviewing all the other beers I have endured, which is to say that all of the macro beers on the north american continent that I can think of ( canadian, american and mexican). I think this should become the watermark for american (mainly U.S.) macro. Especially since if you have enough to afford them, you can afford this. There isnt nearly as much corn and rice flavor as in the macros, you can let this warm up and sit for a while and its still is palletable, as opposed to the U.S. macros that become undrinkable. Actually there are some that cant be drank unless they are ICE cold. Definantly worth being stocked."
"I keep trying this in the hopes that all the friendly suggestions I got for it weren't wrong. It's not a bad beer but it's really inconsistent and doesn't stand out in any setting I've had. Overly carbonated yellow-golder color with a fluffy white head that faded quickly. Nothing but a bit of grass on the nose, really really slight and almost nonexistent. Mostly you smelled acidic bubbles bursting. OK malting and hops but nothing special and each time I've had it, it has varied quite a bit. A bit thin and the carbonation was too much."
"It's a pretty good beer considering the style, ingredients, and origins. It's tough to get this one right. Its light and refreshing. Pours a thin straw color with descent carbonation that fades quickly. A little lacing, but nothing to get excited about. Faint aromas of light vegetables, grain, sweetness, and hops. Flavors are lightly citrusy, grainy, and sweet. Body is fair for style. Light by BA standards, but medium for a lager in firmness, texture, and creamyness. Finishes very crisp, yet not overly dry. Mildly alcoholic and hop flavored. It's not that this is a great beer, but there are no obvious flaws."
"Poured light golden yellow in colour, weak white head, not much to the aroma and it didn't excite the palate. It wasn't bad however. Cold it is quite satisfying. It comes in a neat looking silver can shaped somewhat like an hour glass. My first adventure with Japanese beer. Not great but in a pinch if I was thirsty I could drink one of these. Colder the better for this brew."""
"As far as a dinner beer goes, this one could be versatile as it finishes clean. The smell is the only downside of this brew."
"Though not as nasty as some of the beer from Asia, this one is not a favorite. It also isn't useful by itself. It is, however, okay for washing down sushi and for the coolness of the oilcan."
"Smooth, moderately carbonated, and light bodied. Easy to drink and great with Grilled dishes and raw fish."
"If you do go out for Japanese, you might as well go the whole 9 yards. But I wouldn't try this stand alone again."
"Pale yellow color with a decend foamy white head. Smells clean with some grains, faint malts and hops. Light carbonated body. No soda like mouthfeel like most American mainstrem lagers. Taste crisp with some hop bitterness, light malts, and cooked grains. Not bad! Not bad at all. Goes great with any Asian cuisine! A higher quality than American premium lagers."
"22 oz. can that can presumably be called a metal bomber. Clear light gold color, lots of visible carbonation. Small white bubbly head. Just a layer on top of the beer. Smell is metallic and slightly malty. Taste is thin and grainy, no hops anywhere, with a metallic funk that makes this rather unenjoyable. Just an average, at best, lager. Get it above BMC, but I tend to stay away from Japanese beer brewed in Guelph, Ontario..."
"Mouthfeel was a bit thin. Drinkability was average... nothing stood out, really."
"This beer pours a golden color, with a small head that dissipates quickly. On the nose, I get some maltiness. The taste is thrist quenching, with malty characteristics. The mouthfeel is bubbly effervescent. This would be a good beer to pair with a spicy dish, that is probably why it is notorious for the sushi beer. To quench the wasbi flame."
"Drinkability- I could drink these things all day while working in the yard, etc...It's a beer you have to drink cold though. I don't know what it would taste like warmed up and I don't want to find out."
"Light bodied, pretty generic middle of the road lager."
"Smells crisp, slightly fruity. Very crisp, light taste with hints of grain and fruit, kind of a creamy aftertaste. Not all that much in the way of taste, though. High carbonation makes for a nice mouthfeel and it goes down smooth."
"I did not like this one. It has more flavor than the big American macros, but the flavor is a bit of a putrid flavor. It is not overly bitter, for I cannot detect any real hops. I struggle to pinpoint the taste. It basically tastes like spoiled corn I would say. Overall, it does not go down very well. It is no better than Bud or Coors or MGD."
"Like I said, I can only hope that I got a bad can. If I can bring myself to buy another and it tastes better, I will update this review."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a spotty white lace head. The aroma is sweet almost like a weak hefe. I guess it's from the yeast because it looks like nothing but pale malts. The taste is not that good. It is extremely watery with little malt flavor. It has a refreshing finish, but it lacks any real character. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with low carbonation. It drinks not too well. It is a lousy lager."
"This is one of my favourite asian beers. Though at this time, I'm consuming it from a can, I have poured it before and it is a golden, straw colour. It has a very light weight smell to it and lightweight taste, as well. A tiny bit of biscuit (I think, personally) an a light carbonation which accounts for its drinkability. This stuff is almost thirst quenching. I can chug this stuff with no problem. If you're wanting a deep, flavourful beer you can drink and pick apart, get something from Bavaria. If you want a cold beer you guzzle, but don't want some mainstream foolishness like Bud or Coors, grab a Sapporo."
"22 oz. artsy can. Um, so this is dry? Really? There's a nice smell when you first flip the can tab, but it doesn't carry over into the taste. Less malt taste to come through, which makes me think of adjuncts. Sure enough, the taste is gone as soon as I swallow. I suppose it would go good with food, but so would an instant iced tea. Draft should imply that its filtered instead of pasteurized, but I get none of that here. Just barley water."
"God, I hate cans. Of course, I dont think this brew would have been that much better from a bottle or an draft. Overall, another sub-par Japanese beer."
"I found this difficult to drink. Liquid metal has never been one of my favorite beverages. What little flavor is present in this beer just isn't very good."
"Appearance is a bit cloudier than many beers. Head vanishes without a trace in almost no time at all. Smell is faint. Tastes like it smells. Not really bad in any way, but it's a bit bland. More than drinkable, but not really impressive in any way. Not really worth the inflated pricetag that seems to come with it."
"Pours a light golden color with a thick, frothy white head (the tall silver 22 oz. can the beer came in was much more impressive in appearance with its narrower base and textured sides). Both the aroma and taste are very mild, a hint of freshly cut grass and perhaps a hint of hops. Fairly smooth, with a light to medium body. A fairly drinkable beer. While I didn't dislike this beer and would drink it again (if someone handed me one), it is not something I would seek out."
"This beer pours a pale yellow, with very foamy white head that reduces quickly. A few carbonation bubbles can be seen floating to the top after being poured. The head reduces to a very thin film. Lace is very nice near the top of the glass. Grains are the dominate aroma. The taste is quite bland and finishes weak. This is a light bodied beer and at the price that I payed for it, I will not be drinking it again."
"everything we know!"
"I could not even finish the can , I poured a full half of this beer down the sink..forgive me Beer Gods!"
"Bleeech!!!!"
"This is a good brew here. It's like a regular American beer, but it tastes way better. It's rich in malt and hops, plus it even has a nice little head to it. Ofcourse it doesn't last long, but it's still there. It's a pale yellow color. It's got a dry finish, but it's not that dry. The can is friggin awesome though! Looks like a space age torpedo from the 50's."
"Expiration date: July 2003"
"Sapporo: In the well-known silver bomber can. What can one say; it is a fairly undistinguished beer, imported from Japan. Easy to drink, sure, tasty, not really. It had a slightly, and not at all unpleasantly, euro-lager taste, but it still had the euro-lager taste, with what I thought was more than its own fair share of adjuncts. On the other hand, it was crisp, light, and helped wash down the day old turkey. As good a lager as you’ll see outside of Germany, and better than their macro-imports, Czech, and most of Eastern Europe. (in other words, it eats henie/becks/budmillercoors for lunch)."
"16 oz. bottle. Clear fizzy golden yellow color. Large, explosive fizzy head. Served in a tall pilsener glass at PF Changs restaurant. Sour, and grainy smells, but somewhat pleasant and appealing. Carbonation was a bit highly charged but did not overwhelm the very adequate sweet malty taste. Super clean and crisp taste paired great with spicy Chinese Food. Decent shot of bitterness in mid taste, then a sweet balanced finish. Nothing lingers, very refreshing and a great choice with Japanese or spicy Chines food. Easy going, well balanced, and compliments food nicely."
"To the best of my ability, I've only ever been able to find the ""Original"" draft beer in a 22 oz. can. I've often wondered if it's the same beer that comes in the sharp looking embossed bottle with the shiny black & two-color gold label. The can advertises ceramic filtration, but the bottles only say ""cold filtered""... all beer is filtered cold! So I did a side by side tasting. The color and head retention appear to be the same, although the beer from the can is slightly hazy (and may have to do with the age of the sample). The light ""beer"" aroma appears to be the same with the exception that there may be a little skunkiness in the bottled sample. The flavor also appears to be the same, although the mouthfeel of the canned beer is a little smoother. So, in conclusion, it's my belief that if there is any difference between the two beers it's simply in filtration and packaging. A decent beer, but nothing special."
"Pours a clear gold color, modest white head and fair lace that dissipates quickly. malt nose, thin middle, finish is crisp and potently acidic, adequate for those times your into something  light. Been a long time since I sampled, still the same, drinkable, but not something that appeals to me."
"not terrible, but this is like the heine of japanese beers. it is just better out of the can. the bottle was much more bitter and had more carbonation. it was not the same crisp brew that comes out of the silver bullet cans. oh well"
"Behold."
"This beer has a nice sized head and a malty nose with a hint of lemon. It is light yellow in appearance and perfectly carbonated. This beer is one with a body that isn't too big and is very smooth. This is a very well balanced beer and nothing really seems out of place. When sipped, it starts out with the fizz, alcohol, and a little citrus, followed by a tiny bit of grains and malt. A very good beer all around."
"Also the can rocks!"
"Poured a nice golden straw color with a creamy white head that slowly sank.  The smell was mostly skunk with some mild sweetness.  The skunkyness wasn't too bad in the flavor but the only other flavor I got was adjunct sweetness.  The mouthfeel was somewhat crisp and refreshing although I didn't find the beer to be very drinkable.  I really didn't like this beer but after reading the other reveiws I think that maybe it was a bad can of it.  The flavor was not very good and it certainly wasn't dry.  I couldn't even bring myself to finish the can.  I have to say that I was drinking this while eating chinese food that was not good and it may have effected my opinion of the beer as well as it kind of made the whole ordeal unappetizing (sp?).  I will give it another try next time I get Japanese."
"quite hazy golden color, a decent head forms and sticks around, and a fair amount of carbonation.  a sort of citrusy zest in the nose.  not much malt character and thin in the mouth.  a crisp sort of lemon/lime flavor imparts itself on the tongue.  pretty quenching and refreshing.  i know this a japanese beer, but i think it would be killer with some hot mexican food or as a chaser for a shot of tequila."
"Crisp and refreshing.  Made to eat with spicey beef.  Not much to it and that's a good thing.  You don't want this beer to dominate, just to fulfill your thirst and allow you to drink and eat more."
"Worth ordering at a sushi bar just for the cool can.  Reasonably crisp and clean and a good choice with a meal, but not enough character to merit having a couple without food."
"Notes: This is the same beer that is sold in 12 and 16oz sizes, however we have to give the can it's due respect. Hands down, this brew is at the top of the list for some of the better mainstream lagers imported into the US. Goes extremely well with Asian dishes, working as an ideal palate cleanser."
