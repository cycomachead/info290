"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a bubbly white head that dissipates quickly despite the constant stream of carbonation bubbling up from the bottom of the glass. Pretty weak aroma, light grainy malt with a hint of toast and a mild sweetness. Taste is grainy toasty and sweet just like the aroma promised. Finish is fairly dry but leaves a lingering sweetness on the tongue. Spirited level of carbonation, light body with a lightly sweet bubbly mouthfeel. Really nothing special or objectionable. Its not bad, in fact I have had macros that are much worse. I could drink this if I had to."

"Nose is metal, corn, barny malts. Taste is similar, with a bit more malt, and some odd turpentiney ethanol. These are just mild tastes; it's mostly another macro lager. Not sure what makes this the special winter's edition! Note to self: avoid all canned Japanese beers."

"Not much too get excited about here, even for a mass market Japanese beer. While the autumn seasonals at least attempt to mimic Oktoberfest beers, I have no idea what the inspiration for Fuyumonogatari is supposed to be, and it hardly distinguishes itself from the many other bland lagers available in Japan."
"Drinkablity: A good brew. It was refreshing and satisfying. I am still getting used to the Japanese winter brews. They do not seem to be too much of a departure from their regular brews."
"Drinkability: This does get a bit sweet after a while, but it's pretty drinkable nonetheless. A welcome addition to the shelves of my local 7-Eleven."
"2006~2007 Limited Edition can. Nice looking can. Smells like basically nothing at all. Decent amber color, considering the style. Taste is a bit metally, bit of an unpleasantly bitter afterbite. Generally a step down from the usual Japanese Rice Lager. Nice can though."
"This beer is getting exceptionally low marks b/c I really think it's not so good. Japanese beer companies like to put out new Happoshu every once in a while, and this is their ""winter brew"". It's all image though: this beer really blows. It's a little crisp on the onset, but there's really nothing, NOTHING to this beer. It's even got a strange, processed taste, which musters up memories of nasty cheap beer available in the US. Anyone can tell it's a lousy brew, even Japanese people I've drunk it with. I'd rather drink natty anyday. The can is cool though, w a nice image of the Sapporo Beer factory in Sapporo, Japan. Like I said, all image."
"Exp. June 2003"
"Notes: Named for William Shakespeare's poem, this beer is nothing special, nor does it live up to Sapporo's other ""stout draft"" beers (not to be confused with the actual Stout style of beer). Not worth spending a whole lot of time talking about ... next beer."
