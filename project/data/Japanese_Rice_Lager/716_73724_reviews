"Poured from an 11.2 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is virtually odorless, not much of anything. Taste is mild, some malts, bland, finishes dry. Feels light in the mouth and overall this beer is very weak and not worth seeking out."
"I agree with the previous review, so I won't go into detail. Just wanted to add that I have tried 7 or 8 of Asahi's various flavors and they are indeed pretty much the same. For some reason, I keep buying the special editions or ones that I don't see as often, as was the case with the Orion, but they always let me down. Compared to most other average Japanese beers, Asahi is definitely done well, but for a girl who grew up on micros from the Pacific NW and watched Ninkasi get started, they all lack complexity."

"O: Uninteresting, not special. I haven't tried very many of Asahi's 40 or so varieties, but part of me wonders if the rest are similar."
