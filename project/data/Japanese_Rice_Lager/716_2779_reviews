"Really bland.  Typical lager.  Not very good."
"A disappointing beer with a nice can"
"Nice aromatic lager, not bad but not great either, drinkable that´s it."
"This is terrible. Just plain terrible"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good one but nothing spectacular."
"Just wasn't impressed with this beer. Definitely bitter mouthfeel and not much body to the beer. The aroma that was present was very faint."
""
"Not the best of it's style"
""
""
""
""
"Plain and simple beer.  I always have an Asahi with sushi as it goes really well with it.  Color is typically pale straw, taste is crisp and clean.  Not a lot of hops little to no malt.  Smell is like an American lager. Overall this is one of the better Japanese beers.  I like this beer served ice cold."
""
""
"For a beer made with filler, it is ok and heel, goes good with sushi, and not because I think it's supposed to. It's just so light that it helps cleanse the palate. Have you ever tried drinking something really robust with sushi? Not me. This beer has its place. The Japanese need the equivalent of a Busch, anyway...."
""
"I think best of the Jap beers, I'll buy it again."
"Nothing intermingling about this one... In conclusion: a complete disappointment, probably better to drink some tap water with ice"
"Asahi Super Dry is my favorite Japanese beer."
""
"An adjunct like lager but no worse than many of the same style. A nice dry finish."
"Very, very bland. Almost watery. Not great."
""
"It's almost like drinking water"
""
""
"Serving type: can"
"I had to do this...."
""

"Bud Miller Coors equivalent of Japan."
"Working off old notes.  Will update with more details if/when I have another."
"There is not much to say about this beer. It's carbonated, it looks and tastes the way the majority of people expect beer to taste. It's far from terrible, but it's just bland. Karakuchi, indeed."
"A common Japanese brew that does not fair well in the States.  Has a pretty good look (pale yellow) but the smell and taste are average.  Not the best Japanese beer out there."
"OVERALL:  this beer is kind of bland but totally inoffensive, it went down very easy, this is a good lawnmower beer because it quenches your thirst but I would not seek it out again as there are better beers out there."
""
""
""
""
"I pretty good lager, but nothing special."
"I am neutral on this beer."
"The beer is light golden colored beer.  It has a wheat taste and it goes down smooth.  This is very popular beer so most beer fans have already drank this one like I have.  If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting for.  Got get some!"
""
""
"a nice, crisp lager with a bit of a bite from the hops. Again, a slight cut above the standard macro lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: a decent macro lager - not mind-blowing but reasonable and refreshing. A reasonable price also at AU45 a case of 24 x 330mL."

"It's great for the style. Is it a complex hop bomb? No, so it's understandable that it's rated so poorly, but it's great when looked at through the lens of Japanese lagers."

"Solid beer. Nothing fancy, a simple Japanese rice lager. It has a light, crisp, refreshing mouth feel, which alone elevates it above most american style lagers for me. Certainly doesn't have a complex or interesting taste, so I can understand why BA does not rate it very high, but I think they are underselling a well made traditional Japanese lager."
""
"Another decent beer with an awful rating. Get a reality check. This 33. something can was very enjoyable with freshly caught New Jersey crabs. Followed a Founders Harvest Ale so maybe I was still getting the hoppy bitter aftertaste from that, but this was surprisingly hoppy, very dry, clean, crisp and very refreshing. No off taste or aromas, just good, fresh, regular dry beer. Kept going for the glass soon as I put it down, that says it all."
"Overall: I would avoid. Even if you are in a Japanese place, order something else."

"I certainly would not  classify this as awful, as I drank it all, but it is relatively poor and non-descript."
""
""

"Japan is not known for their beers. I can see why. This is a mostly tasteless pilsener with a ricey aftertaste."

"Let's just dive in for a rice lager, eh?  This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a half-finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises hard water, wet grass, a hint of plastic, and a tiny and evanescent whiff of egg.  The taste brings in more of the same, the egg thankfully a momentary bit of madness that never recurs.  Still, not much goodness to be found here.  The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel.  Overall, this stuff just isn't for me.  Rice, barley: it don't matter when it has to be served ice cold to enjoy it."

"Overall: It was neat seeing this beer in seemingly every third vending machine I encountered in Tokyo. It's not really appealing to me, though. I'd like to find out exactly how much rice they use in this puppy, because it tastes like a lot, but their website suggests it isn't. There's almost no malt backbone or hop presence at all. It's kind of like Budweiser, which is fitting, because it's the Budweiser of Japan."

"Frankly I'm surprised that this beer is not getting more love here. I test a lot of craft beer and this is better than half the crap out there."
""
"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of strong rice, sweet malt, pale malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Japanese Rice Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong rice, hint of hop, slight sweet malt, and pale malt. Overall, weak appearance with the body and aroma dominated by a cheap adjunct character. Besides the adjunct, there is little to nothing else to this beer. A poor representation of a Japanese Rice Lager."

"O: actually, for what it is, pretty enjoyable... I would say certain characteristics - its dryness - does make it stand out... flavor-wise, it's fairly standard as far as macro lagers go"
""
"I am quite shocked to see the bad reviews. I love the dryness of this beer. To me it is better than Sapporo, though who can compete with the sturdiness of that can? Well, this is one of my favorite beers so wanted to give it a thumbs up. This minimum character ruling is annoying by the way!"

"ASD poured a very clear golden yellow colour with lots of large visible carbonation bubbles. Pouring produced 1/2"" of bubbly, extremely short-lived white head which left no spotting or lacing down the glass. Its aroma was quite mild, sweet light malts with hops in the background.The flavour began with a sweet light maltiness, with a delayed impact moderate bitterness after swallowing the beer and a dry finish. All very subdued. The carbonation was quite active though, but stopped short of prickly, and I would describe the beer as light bodied with a watery mouthfeel. In summary, I can't figure out why this beer is so big in Japan. It's certainly not offensive in any way, but there's really nothing here to bring me back for another. At $2.60 per 500 ml can, ASD is not inexpensive."

"I'm usually having Sopporo with my hibachi but tonight I wanted to try this Asahi again. Does not disappoint. Finishes dry enough to accompany Japanese fare extremely well. I'm not sitting in my backyard with this but this does the job with dinner. As far as I'm concerned, that has to mean something."
"Very crisp and clean taste, though it has a dull taste, but the rice adjunct here does not bother at all. Its body is too thin, especially after carbonation slows down. All in all, it sure goes down well with Japanese food."

"Pours a pale gold in color with a small thin head that settles down to around the top of the brew. Some spotty lacing is seen. Lots of small streaming bubbles rise up from the bottle during the whole drink. The light aroma is just of some grains with a hint of sweet corn. The taste clean with a dry slightly bitter finish. With the high carbonation, the aftertaste is a bit on the 'stinging' side, which is over done. Overall, not a great beer."

"Not great nor unpleasant, to summarize : Meh-Ok!"
"I love the 33.8oz can. I'll have to get a Sapporo Premium soon to compare. It's not a terrible style for cheap, after all."

"I'm not really a beer specialist, but I know what I like. So my overall score is a 3.5 and i'm just giving the other things a 3.5 since you can't skip that part."

""
""
""
""
""
"Not much of a head. Tastes clean crisp and light. Not much body but very easy to drink. Could have had 3 of these easily. Not much flavor. Tasted like a clean beer with not much sweetness or heaviness. Not sure why it is rated so poorly but I like it. A very popular beer in Japan."

"Had a tall can at a pub in Calgary's Kensington area, on a whim. Pours a watery pale/just this side of light yellow shade with ample carbonation. Very aggressively carbonated adjunct lager, so much so that the bubbles burnt my lips a little. Initially aroma notes were perfumy and bright, but this quickly moved to a wet grain and corn sugar character that one might expect in such a beer. In all honestly though, this beer smells like little except fizzy water. The taste is a bit more robust than the smell and includes the expected wet grainy malt, DMS cooked vegetable, and a residual sweetness (despite the ""super dry"" moniker), along with a tart yogurt acidity and a little peppery spice. Metallic notes and a rubbing alcohol astringency emerge in the finish along with hints of grass. I'd say the finish is indeed pretty clean and crisp as the bubbles scrub the palate of the sweet/cooked flavors. If one is going to judge this beer for what it is, its probably a potent thirst quencher on a hot day and in the right frame of mind could prove to be rather refreshing. Don't look here if you seek complex fresh malt flavors, hops, or anything else associated with craft workmanship."

"330ml bottle. Weizen glass. Enjoyed on jun´13. Golden color, crystal clear appearance. White froth, good retention, some lacing left. Slight metal, grainy odor. Grainy upfront, quite fizzy. Light body. Moderate/high carbonation. Watery texture. Dried adjuncts, maybe corn & low bitterness in the middle. Dry finish. Sweet extract malt on the aftertaste. Boring !!"

"Really nothing offensive like some of the American BMCs, impressively lacking flavor in a way. Hard to really kill this beer but it also doesn't leave you with much to say."

"O - I like this more than many beers and I feel this is definitely above average. Something about this beer makes me want to buy it over and over again. Its rather addictive if you like this style of beer with an extra dry finish."

"Date tasted: July 21, 2013 ... Glassware: Baltika stange... Occasion: looking forward to rest after a fun trip to LBI--and a new mattress upstairs....Appearance: clear golden body with slim bubbles; head flourishes and quickly dissipates, leaves spongelike, wide gaps between foamy nooks and crannies... Aroma: funky corn adjuncts plague the nostrils; slight suggestion of floral hops, but they are beaten back by macro malt... Palate: clean, slightly irregular finish with some warmth at its end; rather watery with little character...Taste: light bitterness from the malt adjunct makes this a rather bland mouth rinser; exhibits little of its promised ""richness""... Overall: at $1.99 for a 38-ounce can, one could argue this beer actually gives the drinker his money's worth... unfortunately, this beer didn't have to come from Japan to deliver its pedestrian malty, bitterly bland aftertaste...at least there was a lot of it?..."
"Overall, this is a beer I do not want to come back to. I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance and even the aroma wasn't too bad. but the taste is just wayyy off. Go for something else."
""
"Overall- I only bought this beer to tick off a beer style. I really didn't need to actually taste it to review it- I've had this beer many times just in different packaging from different companies. The style description suggests moderate bitterness and a firm malty character- this beer has none of that."
""
""

""
""

"I like a dry beer (Ballantine Ale), and this one does not disappoint, if that's what you're seeking. Smooth, clean, and super dry with little to no aftertaste. I've only had it from the bottle. It is not a heavy, hearty brew by any means. And, granted, it is on the expensive side."
""

""
""
"Highly drinkable because there is nothing to this beer. Honestly tastes like flavored water. Inoffensive, but not satisfying, as a previous user has stated."
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and subdued hay and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with watery grain, hay, and grass flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with aromas and flavors that get worse as the beer warms up."

"O: One of the easier reviews I’ve written as there wasn’t much to write about. The weird thing is that I might actually review it more favorably than some other ""real"" beers because it is the least offensive beer I’ve ever consumed. The bad ones are at least flavorful...even if I dislike them."

"This is a mediocre beer. Pours a bland yellow with a quickly dissipating head. Too much carbonation. Smells a bit like soap. The taste isn't awful. Has more of a malty flavor than the average macro lager but has a faint metallic taste to it as well. Crisp and dry mouthfeel."

"o - Overall I've had this with sushi once or twice, though not a fan of it. Nose is pretty bad and while easy to drink, don't think you'd want to drink a ton of these. I'd prefer something like a bud light to this beer."
" I like the flavor it is decent with some rice taste which adds a sweetness to the profile with light yeast tinges and mild spice aspect in the very dry finish - apropos. Overall a decent lager and I wouuld not hestitate to get it again, but not above average really, just good overall."
""
""
"Overall not something I would seek out but am not disappointed. Has a unique flavor that I'll sit on the fence whether I like or not."

"Pours a pale straw color with fine bubbles rising to the top of the pilsner glass forming a thick sea foam head. The nose is of sweet corn syrup and malt. The taste is like the smell with a light mouth feel and high drink ability. Not my cup of tea and quite tasteless. I am a imperial stout and Belgian style guy so lagers don't really impress me. Not bad but not good either. Easy drinking my watery"

"As the name implies, this is a dry beer. The bee rpours a typical golden lager color. Very average and bland looking. The aroma is pretty much non-existent. The beer is not bad though, it could be a bit better, but is one of the better Japanese brews I've had. I've never been a fan of Japanese brew. Asahi is a worthy addition to the lager category and is relatively easy to find in the U.S."

"This is quite bad. I the goal for light beer was not very well attained with the attempt at flavor here ending in a stale imprecise bitterness. Pass on this one."
"This is way too sweet. It honestly tastes more like apple juice than beer. This is definitely a one and done. I'll avoid this in the future."

"nah. id rather have water with my sushi i think. pours pisswater yellow with zero head. smells like metallic mass produced adjunct crap, but doesnt taste nearly as bad. actually some nice tang in the malt flavor and a sort of hoppy back end. mouthfeel is brutally light, but with enough carbonation to get the food moving. overall this is not a craft lager, but the rice malt makes it unique to a degree, and its lightness makes it crazy drinkable. have quite a few before you realize you dont like it, ya know?"

"The beer pours a very pale yellow color with a foamy white head. the smell is almost non-existent, I just noticed grain and a slight grass smell. Not much taste at all either, just a hint of grain and lemon. Very light with lots of carbonation and it actually is pretty dry. I could see this being refreshing on a hot day, not much else going on though."
"Overall: Just a beer. Nothing special but the members of this genre are pretty much all the same."

"Will order again but only at a Japanese restaurant and would not buy for home. I am surprised given the innovative abilities of the Japanese and the unquenchable thirst of the Japanese that Asahi has not refined this formula better. Why it has become tops in Market share is beyond me. Maybe the price point is low."

"M&D: carbonation is lower than meets the eye, remaining moderate actually, while the body is light for 5%abv. without going thin. To be fair, this “Japanese Rice Lager” is not of lower quality than brands like Bud or Coors, which show far more obvious thin-ish impacts of rice adjuncts. This beer actually shows some balance and a surprising presence of appealing maltiness in the middle. That said, I guess this beer would go down well with (any kind of) food rather than being enjoyed on its own."

"This is a very dry beer. It's not the best, but it's my sushi beer of choice. Too bad it's Canadian. A beer for all seasons, indeed."

"This beer was nothing to special. I don't mind drinking it nonetheless. It is a bit dry, hense the super dry. I have no problem drinking this beer when I go out for sushi, but I tend to prefer Sapporo if it comes down to it. This isn't a beer I would recommend going out of your way for."
"Ice cold from a can in an ice-box? Might be different..."
"Not interesting in the least, but it's crisp, refreshing, and palatable enough (or at the very least, not especially unpalatable). Drier than Sapporo Premium, but in the grand scheme of things not much different from most mediocre rice lagers. Something to pass on if you're not a fan of the style, but it works well enough with sushi or salty snacks."
"Yet, when the beer tastes good, should one worry about mouthfeel or color? Still not my all-time favorite, but its going back in my fridge one day."
"One of my first Japaneses Beers... I'll keep on trying them."
"I doubt that I will be giving this one another try, definitely something I would advise others to avoid."
"""Super dry"" might be a stretch; it goes pretty dry in the finish, but I'd call it semi-dry overall. It's light as expected, with a constant carbonation keeping it from flatness. I'd expect it to be a bit crisper, though it is to a point, and it's not terribly lacking smoothness either."
"Had this in Japan 10 years ago. Picked up a single at Wegman's. Contract brewed by Molson this time. Typical macro appearance and aroma. Some rice/corn/grain smell. Slight metallic and light taste. Mouthfeel was easy drinking and reminded me enough of the Japanese version. Not so great but at least brought back some good memories."
"Being the first Japanese rice lager I have tried, I did not have anything to compare against. From what I can imagine others of the style taste like, this would still be about average. There is really nothing here to get excited about (or repulsed about for that matter.) Just a bland, flavorless beer."
"It is what it is, and it isn't much."
"O - A session beer worthy of washing down some spicy Mongolian food, it's certainly not my top pick for an Asian brew, but it's not awful."
"The taste is nothing to be excited about, I know, but you can knock this one glass after glass or bottle after bottle. not bitter, and you can still enjoy the beer like taste that it provides."
"O: Surprisingly drinkable Japanese Rice Lager that I enjoyed with my sushi."
"The flavor is minimal and not at all enjoyable. I get vegetal quality. The after-taste had a decent amount of grassiness."
"RJT"
"Ok, so why is this so expensive?"
"O: Nothing about this beer is impressive. Not even when I'm really thirsty. I just don't get the taste - and it's pricy as well!"
"M: The light body and mild sweetness aided in cutting through the fiery dinner. A good drink that does justice to Asian cuisine."
"clear golden with a two finger white head that quickly disappears. smell is awful, grassy with a little skunk to it. taste is horrible, rice and grass. mouthfeel is thin and watery. overall, about what i expected, i hope not all rice beers are this disgusting."
"Beer is light in body with a mild sweetness. The label says ""SUPER DRY"" on it but this must be a loose translation because this beer is not super dry, mildly dry is what I would have called it with a slightly tiny bitter finish. Unoffensive but unremarkable. What a loser style."
"Boring."
"Dry? Yes, it is. Super dry? No, sake is super dry, this is just dry. It is crisp and refreshing when cold but I bought the 33.5 ounce can so it's a bit warmer now. Despite the flaws in this beer I still managed to finish all 33.5 ounces. I should seek help."
"This isn't amazing. I'll stick to Sapporo if I want a change from my generic North American Lagers."
"D-it serves its purpose as a very light and refreshing beer, but if I wanted a beer this light, I'd probably just drink water."
"T: a watery beer, light body, sweetness at first, tiny bitterness, but is kind of flat all the flavour, not end at all, refreshing, crisping on tongue"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the look. While there was no outstanding coloring, the beer looked the part. For the style it looked appropriate, with an unexpectedly showy head. In the end, however, it fell majorly when it came to aroma and taste. Neither were full or bold, and did little to invite the drinker in for more."
"Overall it'll do when you're eating sushi, but I'd avoid it for regular everyday drinking."
"Second beer tried during my layover in Hong Kong....whilst on my way to Singapore. Asahi Super Dry was much better...to me...than Tsingtao. The appearance is average. Nice clear golden color with good carbonation. The smell is ok....not over the top with grain. The taste is smooth, subtle grain, comes off the pallete clean and crisp....""dry"". The mouthfeel of this beer is ok as well. Very easy to drink."
"Clear yellow straw color. Fluffy head that dissipates quickly, but it does have some nice lively carbonation. Not much of an aroma, bit of straw and grain. Flavor is obviously light and mostly flavorless, but I am not picking up on much in the way of off flavors or bitterness. Maybe my palate is a bit compromised right now since I am broke and have been drinking mostly cheap beer (I am looking at you Goldmine) but as a cheap macro lager I really don't mind this at all. It's not going to set the world on fire, but I would drink it again as an affordable lawn mower beer."
"I love my California ipas, and my muddy imperial stouts, but sometimes you just need something simple at the end of the day. My usual is a pabst with a shot of rye (or 2...:). However, I found that asahi along with a shot of rye is quite satisfying. I can't put a finger on it but I think it's that metallic taste people complain about. I guess I kind of like it. I'll probably come back to this when I feel like a plain old macro lager."
"Meh..."
"12 oz can into a pint glass...this is an interesting beer because what it purports to be is pretty much tasteless. It's crystal clean and there's nothing objectionable going on. It's basically intended to be beer-water that goes with anything. It's easy to swig these down, they're pretty smooth drinkers. Not a bad beer to have around. I'm probably biased sentimentally a little bit from drinking these out of vending machines on a trip to Japan when I was 17."
"Overall, not terrible but not good, wish it had more flavor because it is quite refreshing and if it had the flavor to back it up it would be bad at all."
"It appears that the pretense and snobbery of craft-brew-Gestapo affectations has overpowered the ability to objectively analyze something's enjoyability. Mild, refreshing beers are not bad, they're a different style, and we should look to rate beers according to how well they embody a style or accomplish a purpose, and this beer's purpose is to be well carbonated, light, and refreshing— which it is through and through."
"O - A very poor beer. I'd take a bud/miller/coors product over this any day."
"O - The drinkability here isn't very good, but its not the worst either. I would choose this over some of the other macros available for sure. The taste isn't too offensive (Just don't let it warm) and it goes down fairly easy. I'd drink one again if some one offered me one, but I wouldn't spend money on it again."
"Tastes sweet biscuity malt, and somewhat like carbonated rice water, and the mouthfeel is just carbonation, not noticing any ""dryness"" out of the ordinary."
"Nothing special here. Pours a golden straw color, no head to speak of. Had a metallic taste for sure and it just seemed to linger on the tongue, which was unpleasant. Reminded me a lot of a US Macrobrew Budweiser/Coors, but with that strange metallic taste to it. Had a faint grain taste to it, but just barely. Not something I would drink again."
"overall, meh. don't have a big frame of reference for this style, but to me it falls somewhere in the macro continuum alongside coors and heineken. drinkable but really not doing a lot for me."
"Wasn't able to get much of a rice flavor from this. I've had other beers from Japan that do have flavors of rice in it. Anyway this beer was another Pale Yellow in color Lager, the smell of malts are all that I got out of it. No aroma of hops. My favorite thing about this beer is the label."
"Overall, not the greatest beer, but it's simple and works. If your thirsty and it's hot out, grab a tall can of this."
"Nice break from some moree complex beers. Pours a pale straw color with fine bubbles rising to the top of the pilsner glass forming a thick sea foam head. The nose is of sweet corn syrup and malt. The taste is like the smell with a light mouthfeel and high drinkability"
"D: This is very drinkable and doesn't have a terrible taste. If it was a little cheaper, it would be a viable party option."
"It looks like a fizzy BMC product, doubtless. The nose, however, well, it actually has substance; much more so than I would expect from a JRL. The taste is there too. I get some honey-floral sweetness, very restrained but still readily discernible. There is a fair amount of sweetness here for something labeled as 'Super Dry', although it is not 'sugary sweet' in any sense; the sweetness is a product of the nature of flavor suggestions (i.e. honey, flower blossoms, rice-sake-jasmine, etc.) Good stuff, at any rate. Feels good, easy drinking. I will always order this from now on at the Japanese steakhouse, no more Sapporo or Kirin (thankfully...), and I'd take this over Chang or Singha (by a smaller margin) as well."
"Drinkability: By itself (as I had this one), it is not impressive; just not enough here to interest me. But with food it should do fine."
"Not quite up to par with Sapporo, but I'd order it at a sushi restaurant and just may buy a sixer when I'm looking for an easy drinking beer in the Summer months."
"I don't imagine it would be as enjoyable on its own but with spicy or bold-flavored food I think it works pretty well."
"So from my limited experience of Japanese beers they tend to be crisp yet malty, dry yet soothing. Basically something like this.. except brewed in Japan. In Australia we have three common Japanese brews available, however none of them are actually brewed in Japan. This is brewed in Thailand, Sapporo is brewed in Canada and Kirin Ichiban is brewed here in Australia. For the record I have experienced the proper Asahi (from a delightful 1l can) and it deserves better than the C rating which this version should earn. Much more crisp and vibrant - drink that one if you can.."
"Notes: Simple plain and yes dry."
"D- Its as drinkable as it gets, nice to have around for a hot summer day or if you just want to quaff."
"Standard ""Dry Beer"". Seems to go best with Asian food."
"Still, despite the novelty of a rice beer, this one ended up tasting watery and just about as average as can be."
"D: Barely."
"Not exactly something one should endeavor to quaff on its own, but easy enough to put back alongside some spicy Japanese fare, the kind made for accommodating (or maybe vice-versa) the kind of hideous sweet and tangy character of this offering. I'm guessing 'Super' somehow translates to ""now less sickly malty, and with a metallic offset instead"". Pardon my French."
"I thought the Japanese brewed version might have been better than the OS brewed versions I have tried but if anything it was worse."
"You really have to love beer to appreciate the nuances in appearance and smell. Although I agree with my counterparts that the beer may be lacking in appearance, its the bottle itself shining the advertisement of the brew itself. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The brew has a rice taste quality to it, and it wasn't a pun by identifying the brew by the manufacturer as satiny smoothness. Went down well. To me, as long as the beer tastes reasonable, then its worthy of my session. You wouldn't be disappointed."
"D: it drank very good cause it was thin in body and went very good paired with sushi and shrimp tempura."
"Drinkability - Well... I like to give each beer a fair review and I respect all brewers, but I probably won't be visiting this beer again. Some may like it and I'm sure it has its place, but it's just not the beer for me. I'm better off having tried it though."
"Nothing to really brag about here, but it is better than some BMC products I've had. I wouldn't recommend this unless you just want ti try a Japanese Rice Lager."
"A bog standard lager beer, delivers exactly what it says; a dry pale lager. Only down sides were that it went flat quicker than I would have liked & that it wasn't exciting in any way. No doubt I'll try it again sometime in the future if the price is right."
"Just really nothing to write about. Supremely watery...on par with many macros."
"12 oz bottle from Japanese restaurant. Pours Corona color with hay, grassy nose and metallic, skunky, hoppy taste. No malt balance in this brew at all. I really had to struggle to finish the bottle. I think I would be much better off ordering Heineken."
"Pours a light golden yellow color with a thick non-relenting white soapy head with a little lacing. Smells of rice and a little hops aroma. Tastes of rice with strong notes of fresh cut grass and some hidden hops. Mouthfeel is a little thin but the carbonation is decent. Drinkability is pretty high."
"People gotta take into account the style. There aren't many examples of Japanese rice lagers, and from the three or four I've had, this is easily the most refreshing and unique. Was my staple beer of choice years ago before I discovered Sam Adams and craft."
"Bland, but good for sake bombs, if nothing else."
"D- Despite having a little more of a distinctive flavor than most run-of-the-mill macros, it did not go down as smoothly to me. Might just be the difference in Japanese vs. American lagers, as I know many people who really like this beer."
"Pours an average lager gold with tons of carbonation and a head that disappears quite rapidly. Tastes of strong hops and a hint of metal, has a very strong aftertaste that lingers for a while then turns kinda gross. The beer is slightly bitter but its ok, its still refreshing when cold on a hot day :P i think any beer is (except light beer, unless you want water) This beer is way too over carbonated but i could and the aftertaste isnt really the best but you know what overall i would say its drinkable. nothing terrible about it but it could use some work. not bad yet not great."
"A refreshing enough brew to knock back a tray of sushi, but nothing substantial."
"No not really recommended unless you don't want a beer that is as unobtrusive as possible."
"Not something i will take again."
"Drinkability: I can drink this as quickly or slowly as a feel like, and I don't lose the flavor or become overwhelmed."
"The lightest beer I have seen in my life. It is almost transparent. It looked like someone mixed a 20oz. bottle of water in a 12oz. beer. The head is almost nonexistent. The nose doesn't really exist either. The taste is thin and watery. A metallic taste lingers on the finish. I would have to say the highest quality of this beer is the drinkability only because of the lack in taste."
"So it seems Asahi is nothing different, just another dull lager brewed for the un-beer-educated."
"Atmosphere is ok. It has a pretty solid appearance all in all. Nose is not much to talk about except for this faint rotten aroma that emanates from it. Flavor, nothing to speak of. Nothing really there, and a rubbery aftertaste. Overall, this is not so great a quaff."
"My question is, why is this beer so popular in Japan? Advertising and prevalence would be my guesses."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. First time I have tried a Japanese beer. The rice lager pales a pale yellow and shows plenty of carbonation showing thru. Slightly malty smell and small amounts of lace stayed on the glass. The beer is not overly complex and leaves a bitterness as you drink. The beer is a little bit watery and drinkable but not something I would go out of my way to get."
"The taste is very mild grain, specifically a definite cooked rice character and indeed rather dry with little sweetness or bitterness. It has a rough character in the middle with water metallic quality and only a mild rice aftertaste. Bland up front, it gets a little flavour in the middle, but by the finish completely loses all character of any sort for an abrupt and utterly tasteless, watery finish before its mild aftertaste. Even for the style it is extremely watery, with a rough, unpleasant palate. It tastes like a basic ""beer"" quality, but only just barely."
"D: yep im admitting to being a ticker here, it alright but not great, if you want rice in your beer just get a bud"
"Great light-medium body. Smooth, slightly grainy finish. Went well with mixed vegetables dressed with a kung pao & peanuts sauce. Much better than most macro American Lagers."
"-notes from 12/04. would only try this again for the novelty of small sized cans. this was pretty bad"
"D - Interesting beer, I could have had another."
"D - an average, reminds a little bit of TsingTao. If you like a dry aftertaste, and rice beers - this will do the trick"
"Fairly typical of the style, this is a refreshing session beer with the familiar flavor of rice lagers."
"At their worst, industrially produced lagers can be distasteful, unpleasant, notably cheap products that the average non-beer drinker will find repellent. At their best, they are neutral, unmemorable, pedestrian beverages that even the general public should find inoffensive. This is closer to the latter... although not by that much."
"[Note that like most beers, this is far better on-tap and fresh though (common in Japan, but I've only seen super-dry in bottles in the U.S.). I'm also a bit skeptical of the consistency in other markets -- many of the reviews here note that they were of bottles which were brewed by other breweries under contract, and given that even the bottled version of super-dry is pretty good in Japan, it seems quite plausible that some of these contract brewers just aren't doing a very good job...]"
"Notes: It's a good tasting beer. I for one like the taste of a rice lager, but I can understand why a lot of guys don't. I wouldn't mind having it with some Sushi or Japanese food. It has it's own flavor and character. And it goes down well."
"Golden Pour. Nose was of weak lager, nothing stands out. Little bubbly head dissipates quickly. Flavor is better than the smell. Label says ""Ultra Dry," which I usually associate with being less sweet. This definitely has a sweet underlying flavor. Not hoppy, just sweet, almost like a bit of maple syrup. Light on the palate, though. The high carbonation throws me off a bit. Not bad to drink, but no so sure if I'll buy another 6-pack."
"It has drinkability. Get it if you are having some guests over who know nothing about beer. But for something really pleasurable, skip this one."
"Drink it cold - it doesn't get better at room temp."
"Overall, not bad and not terribly good. Kind of a unique change of pace to lager fans."
"In all, not at all a bad beer and is fairly good in terms of drinkability. Very light and doesn't get in the way of food (which is what this beer was made for anyway)."
"Wouldn't drink, let alone review this on my home continent. But with limited options, I eventually found this better than the Thai and Cambodian lagers (which really isn't saying much). I'd even go so far as to say it beats the crap out of the Thai beers, and was surprised that it is rated lower than Chang??? The taste is far from memorable or exciting, but neither was it offensive, which in its regional environment, causes it to stand out from the pack."
"taste finally hurdles into something admirable. rich foamy mouthfeel allows a near-toasty malt flavor to drift through in a high-end macro-way...not bad at all. nothing skimpy or skunky or thin or even 'boring' here...some bantam-heft for sure. a summer brew after lawn care...and even with some Trader Joe's California Rolls...or a Starkist tuna sandwich. with bacon. and kettle chips."
"Light bodied, similar to sparkling water. Not very drinkable. Fairly unpleasant to drink."
"Sweet flavor, everything is whisked away in seconds by the high carbonation. Really, no flavors really emerge to hit me. A little corn, some light grain, no hops; fortunately not much is actually 'bad'. Body is super-light, very thin, and pretty abrasive with the carbonation. Not too good."
"M/D - Pretty heavy on the fizz for my taste. The combination of the high carbonation and the dry finish muted out what little flavor there was to begin with. This was about as drinkable as a glass of ice cold club soda."
"O: Refreshing with an average drinkability, after all. At the same time, the taste of adjunct malts is a little bit overwhelming"
"A very clean and a bit dry. It isn't bad in any way, but it's just... Insipid."
"D-Not bad. It's crisp and refreshing, & I could picture this going well w/some Pacific rim cuisine."
"D: OK, not much flavor or texture to it so it's kind of a bland beer. The flavors are there, but I guess it's good with bland foods that you don't want to overpower the subtle taste."
"Drinkability: It's okay, really. While mild, it is clean and crisp with no discernible off-flavors - as a lager should be. I'd say it would be a good go-to beverage for pairing with sushi, but, that's what the sake is for!"
"D: Nothing outstanding about this beer; just decent for washing down some well-made sushi without drowning the delicate balance of sushi flavors out."
"Meh. Not particularly memorable, nor is it worth picking up again. There are better pales out there for the price, and I hate giving Molson money. I wish we could better brews from asia, because other than Sinha, it's all bland macro lagers. I know there are better brews than this."
"Went for sushi the other night and thought it would be appropriate to try a Japanese-style beer with my Japanese food. (I say Japanese-style because the Asahi we get here in the states is brewed by Molson for Asahi.) I did not expect much, and this worked to the beer's advantage as it turned out to be an improvement on our domestic adjunct lagers. Worked well as a palate cleanser between bites of different dishes, was blandly inoffensive and called little attention to itself other than to notice that the taste was unexpectedly not wretched. Good for sushi. Can't think of any other setting in which I'd choose it though..."
"Appearance has a light golden color with a nice crisp head that sticks around for awhile. Smell has a nice rice grain to it . Taste has the graininess from the rice with a metallic hop leaving the mouth fairly dry. Mouthfeel is light with a good amount of carbonation. Not a bad beer, but nothing exciting either."
"Ok to drink but the price is rediculous. 4.99 for a 24oz can."
"Pours basic macro yellow with a white head. Aroma is that of a basic macro lager with some sweetness. Flavor is more of the same with a little more sweetness than you get with American macro lagers. You also get some hop bitterness, but it is subdued. Thin mouthfeel and highly carbonated. Not a terrible beer, but not something I think I will try again."
"as a great beer, I probably would take it over any light beer, would taste good after a hot day."
"Drinkability - Certainly drinkable. Not terribly complex or noteworthy, but I don't expect it to be. Pairs well with sushi and other Japanese delicacies, and can serve as well as Kirin beer as a background for sake bombers."
"Overall, I'd highly suggest this, despite my low rating, but it's nothing too special. Cheers."
"D - There is just not enough here to justify spending the extra money on this over a domestic macro. I might wash some sushi down with one, but otherwise I am not having another Asahi Super Dry."
"I've always had a soft spot for this beer but honestly hadn't had it for about 4 years. That has kinda gone out the window now. I thought it might be nice on this stinking hot evening to have an icy cold Asahi. Should've had water. Husky, metallic nose with no real hop notes to speak of. Palate is again kind of grainy nad husky up front but falls away to nothing on the finish. Not crispy dry or refreshing at all. Leaves a rather unpleasant metallic aftertaste."
"As I said, this (along with several other beers in its price range) is indicative of what a ""Japanese beer"" is all about. Easy-drinking, nondescript, unassuming, how-many-have-I-had? beer."
"This beer appeared to be brewed with the idea of giving no offense, and it succeeded. Nothing really wrong with it, just not the bomb craft beer drinkers expect. There are plenty of beers I'd rather drink, but in a pinch, I'd drink it again without any qualms."
"Not a terrible beer, but far from good. I've read that Asahi Super Dry is one of the best selling beers, which goes to show that what is popular and what is good are two entirely different things."
"D: The best Asian beer I ever drank, much better than the Sapporo Premium, i liked with salmon."
"Pours out to a clear pale golden, forming a tall white head with excellent retention and impressively solid sheets of lace, with moderate carbonation. The aroma is rather nondescript. It certainly smells like beer, with some type of pale malt and likely lots of rice, some distant esters of fermentation and no noticeable hop character. The mouth-feel is light bodied and watery. The taste is as nondescript as the nose. Flavor of beer with a mild grainy sweetness, very mild to nonexistent bitterness, and a little aftertaste of adjuncts. Easy to drink, but not really fulfilling. Nearly devoid of character, and easy to drink several of these in a row on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability- I'll pass on this any time if Sapporro is available. That's my benchmark for the rice lager catagory."
"Overall: This mouth feel is crisp and light. This beer is okay nothing great to write about."
"D= This isn't a world class beer by any means but it was interesting and paired well with spicy Thai cuisine. I am not sure I would want this beer on its own (i.e. not paired with food) but for what it is and for the purpose of accompanying an asian meal I found it quite drinkable!"
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is of malt and grain. Taste is crisp with some maltiness but not a lot of flavor, finishes dry. Feel light in the mouth and has o.k. drinkability. Overall this is a very ordinary beer."
"looked better then it was"
"Pours clear and fizzy from the can, no head to speak of after a few sips. The color is essentially yellow-gold and light. Smells like your typical adjunct lager, maybe with a little more rice than average. The taste is fleeting, with only some of that adjunct beer flavor that pretty much disappears by gulp's end. The ""Super Dry"" is at least half right, there's not much in the way of taste after you swallow. This is a fine session beer (even at 5% ABV, just know what you're getting into) and goes well with Asian food in general. Just don't expect much from this Japanese macro and you'll be fine."
"I am big on lagers, and this is definitely one of my faves. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Pilsner glass. Bright golden colour with a 1 finger head. Heavy rush of fizz is rushing to the surface. Smells of grain all the way, less of everything else. Tastes malty sweet which is shortlived, ending with a rice water feel. The best part about the beer is the crispness and the dry feel. Simply amazing to wash down tons of food, anytime of the year. Best enjoyed ice cold."
"Hell, I lived in Japan for close to six years, and while this is not the worst beer in the land of the rising sun (nor is it even close to the best) it is a decent Adjunct Lager and goes great with a bunch of mates at the local Izekaya. Drink a lot and it is fine."
"Can: Poured a light bright golden color lager with a large bubbly head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with minimal adjunct being noticeable. Taste is also dominated by light sweet malt with a bland finish. Not the worst pale lager out there and with well hidden adjunct it is still quaffable with my sushi."
"I tried this beer on August 13, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent pale gold colour with very little head. The aroma was grainy malt with some hoppiness. The mouthfeel was thin bodied, watery, and highly carbonated. The flavour is grainy and otherwise tasteless."
"Feels thin, watery, and spritzy. Nothing special, but refreshing on a hot day. Aside from feeling light in the mouth, it feels light in the stomach as well. I'd say its pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability - As others put, it's decent. I wouldn't buy one again. But it's alright for a hot day. Didn't really go well with my Fish and Chips pairing. Try it out for yourself. Again, Decent/Average."
"Drinkability - I wouldn't drink this beer on its own, but it is great with Sushi. This beer acts as a good pallet cleanser."
"Had this with a mess of sushi at a nice restaurant in Campbell, CA. The sushi was happily better than the brew! It shows a pale yellow color with a modest white froth and traces of lacing. The aroma is metallic light wheat with perhaps a hint of anemic citrus. The taste is crisp but thin cereal rice and wheat grain. Refreshing but pretty anemic. Easy drinking, good with sushi, but not a taste sensation."
"I found this beer surprisingly disappointing. Maybe, it's an issue of age or something. At any rate, the beer pours a straw yellow color, a shade darker than other Japanese lagers, with a puffy white head. The head dissipates rather quickly, leaving some lacing. The shade of yellow is a bit strange, but perhaps that's just my opinion on the flavor/aroma of the beer coloring (pun) my feelings on the appearance. The odor is light but still off-putting. It's on the weak end of the spectrum of macro lager aromas but definitely not the bottom of the barrel. The flavor is a mix of bitter, grassy hops, cheap super pale malt plus adjuncts (rice, I guess) and a mildly stomach-turning sourness. The mouthfeel is light with some graininess. Drinkability isn't horrible, either, but it's certainly nothing to write home about. It's light and sits easily, but I don't think that I could finish this enormous can by myself unless I was fairly drunk and not really noticing the flavor."
"I really wanted to like this one. I love most all Japanese food, and really wanted to like this one to have something to go with my Sushi, and so on, but I'm going to keep looking. It pours a fairly light yellow, pretty much like any macro, but it had an absolutely enormous head, that stuck around for quite a long time, very white. Not much smell, and I really couldn't tell the smell from any macro. As long as it was really cold, it was fairly palatable, but once it started to warm, the flavor became more metallic. I managed to finish it, but I really wasn't impressed. I'm going to keep it really cold, and drink it after work when I'm hot and tired from a long day in the 110s. Try it if you want, but there's much better out there."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down easily and is not too filling since there isn't much to it, mild kick, decent representation of style, I wasn't expecting much from this beer and I'll admit it was better than I thought it was going to be, but it's not a beer that I would want to drink again."
"Well, it definitely is super dry. Bone dry finish. Pretty crisp and refreshing, but not really interesting enough to really enjoy."
"M-D- For a rice lager it is very easy to drink with only the normal american adjuct lager distractions. That being said, slightly easier on the buds with a nice smoothness that is water-like. I could consume in mass amounts."
"-RR"
"Pours extremely pale gold. A finger of brilliant white head shows promise, but then disappears as quickly as it arrives. No lacing. Extremely light grain smell (read: next to no smell). Very light grain taste. Finishes fairly dry with a quick snap of lemonish and metallic bite. A terribly boring beer."
"Nothing to speak of in the way of mouthfeel or drinkability. I must say though, it wasn't nearly as terrible as I might've expected. I wouldn't turn it down if offered a cold one. But I won't rush to try another one either."
"Not easy to finish this beer. About the only good use would be really hot sweaty guy after mowing the lawn."
"D = This is not a great beer, but it is perfectly pleasant for what it is."
"I bought a 21.4 ounce brown bottle of this beer today mostly because it's something that I wouldn't normally buy. I figured I'd try something new. I don't ever recall having a Japanese Rice Lager. Right off the bat, I don't think beer should be made from rice but I'll keep an open mind. It looks... OK. Light gold with a big puffy dish-soapy head. Smells... Not OK. It smells like cheap duck feed, dirt, and metal. Flavor? Extremely weak hints of an undetermined grain that was used instead of malted barley. Rice, I guess. Earthy hay, perhaps. inferior ingredients for sure. Very light and watery and quite flavorless. The carbonation distracts me from trying to determine what I'm tasting. Maybe there's a tiny touch of sweetness there. I don't know. It's not very good."
"they say the dry taste appeals to the japanese palate, and sales show that it's the best-selling beer in japan. that being said, i'd recommend avoiding this beer at all costs. seriously, i've had better hopposhu."
"I don't recommend this beer. However, if you ever ask a Japanese person from Japan what their favorite beer is, there's a 95% chance they will say ""Asahi SuperDry!"". Then again, they tend to follow what is socially popular here and if the commercials on TV say ""It's the #1 beer in Japan!", they will agree perpetuate that mantra..."
"Asahi Super Dry is not good beer. It's consistent with my other limited experience with the style. It's also very consistent with adjunct/macro lagers...lacking in just about every respect. I'd offer constructive criticisms, but that would require a complete overhaul here. It needs a substantial amount of work. But, I suspect it's just as it was intended...beer for people who really don't like beer. Not recommended."
"Overall - A boring, bland beer."
"Drinkability- Its strongest point is certainly its drink ability, as its so light and crisp that you could really throw this back quick, would be one not to really savor the flavor but reminiscent of a macro that you would just be using to throw back quick, not terrible but not great,"
"This beer is a prime example of higher cost not always giving better product. I bought this thinking it would have more to offer than other Japanese beers I've had. I definitely will not be trying this again."
"Final Thoughts - I knew when I bought this beer, it would be a disappointment, but I figured ""Have an open mind, don't judge it till you try it."" Well I tried it, and needless to say I wasn't surprised. This beer is tolerable, but not much else. I'd drink it if is was the only beer available, but other then that, it's not worthwhile. It will be some time before I chance a Japanese style again, that is for sure."
"I like substance and flavor, so this did not meet my cut. I believe that there is no beer in the world that deserves an F as I love beer too much to fail one and no matter how bad a beer is, it could likely be safer than local water of the area... but this was pretty bad and not worth the premium price."
"While admittedly not an amazing beer, it's definitely a very nice cheap drink that goes really well with Japanese food. I only wish that the domestic version tasted true to the original."
"This beer is more tasty and refreshing than I had expected, and puts up a damn-good drinkability factor. But again... it's also either make or break with a personal opinion. If you don't like really dry beers, you probably shouldn't even be trying this in the first place. But if you do, and you are looking to try something a little different, I could recommend this. For what it's worth, this beer has me a little curious about higher caliber brews of this style."
"I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
"Taste is better than the smell indicates. Still quite light in flavor, but it is crisp with a dry finish. I can actually discern some hop flavor and bitterness here. I would take this over BMC light beers any day. Not super, but could do plenty worse for a saki bomb accompaniment."
"Pours a typical lagerish clear yellow, OK white head. Aroma is crisp, simple, not too strong. Flavor is crisp, strong, malty, better than most macro lagers if lacking in complexity. Texture is fairly smooth and firm, not at all watery. Not great, but acceptable."
"Drinkability: The best tasting beer of the group of Asian beers I recently tasted. I would enjoy having this again, although not necessarily regularly"
"Conclusion: It is what it is...it's not a style that lends itself to greatness (or even mediocrity, IMO) and this is average at best for the style."
"D: At least it's pretty to look at. Not worth a revisit."
"Had this with my buddy that told me that this is his favorite Japanese beer. I was less than impressed. Gold color poured in glass with little head. Smell...not really. Taste was even more disappointing with no real discernible flavors. Was carbonated. I wouldn't want another one of these for free."
"An average beer overall....but for these parts it's good enough."
"This beer is simply too dry and left me extremely thirsty after drinking it. It pours a light yellow and has a bitter smell with a small, fizzing head. It's almost impossible to notice any sort of taste, because the liquid almost immediately evaporates after hitting your tongue."
"Aroma is lightly malty with alcohol. It has an average head but has some clumps in it after it subsides, very little lacing. Golden amber color typical for Pale Lagers. Taste is a little weak and the only thing that save this is the unique hops. Too bad there is not much of them to taste. Brief maltiness in the finish. Aftertaste is almost non existent but being a super dry beer that would be expected. Pretty so so at best."
"Decent carbonation, lighter bodied, but enough flavor to know you've had a sip. Fights through the salty-ginger flavors of decent sushi. Overall, I could have had seltzer or stuck with tea and gotten the same effect. Greasy italian food last night, and this for lunch -- I'm done for the day."
"Pours a light yellow colored body, and a small white head. Mm, a malty aroma, fresh. Taste is clean, and nutty. Watery mouthfeel. Refreshing. A little alcoholy, a little dry, but not too bad overall. Eh, a lager, but more flavor than most big brother beer."
"D. Good for what it is, preferred to many american light beers. A good sushi bar brew."
"The smell was grainy and of lemons. The taste was plain and grainy. It was pretty dry and moderately carbonated. Overall not bad for its purpose. Washing down some sushi."
"There's really very little to say about beer like this, as it doesn't excel or leave a lasting memory in any area. Not even that great when compared to some of the other Japanese beers in its class. Looking back on this review in 2010 I've finally come across a good rice lager brewed in Toronto, and it really highlights the potential of the style that the big brewers have missed out on. It also makes this swing and a miss all the more disappointing."
"I could definitely drink this in large quantities if presented with them. Part of me has a liking for this because I just like beer in general, but I know when I'm standing in front of the cooler I will not choose this one often. There's little reason that they couldn't drop the price on this, in which case I'd think about it when looking for budget beer. I could see it going well enough with food, and I reckon I prefer this over Sapporo Draft if given the choice. It's pretty refreshing, mainly due to being hoppier and drier than other macros."
"Bud, or if your feeling charitable, Bud Select. There isn't much else to say about the beer. Spending time in consideration of its various qualities is sort of like thinking hard about a number 2 pencil: its there, you know what it is, there isn't really anything more to it. Its also dull, unimaginative, and worth not even drinking beer if its your only option. There really isn't much else to say, you get the point, don't buy it. To be fair, you could do worse. The beer may even be slightly better than I have listed, but at some point, there is no point, bogus beer is just that, and not worth your dollar."
"After the Sapporo, this just didn't make the cut. Pale yellow fizz in the glass, with a white foam that quickly disappeared. A mild ""beer"" smell in the nose, watery and bubbly, with a mild malt and subtle fruity hops taste. Reminded me of a US ""light"" macro. Just didn't have the same quality as some others. A lot of variety in Japan, apparently; so it would be interesting to try some of them there. And since you can buy beer from vending machines, it sounds like my kind'a place. Nihon ni ikou ka?"
"Decently drinkable, but that's just because it's unoffensive."
"Pours a nice bright gold with a small fizzy white head,dont blink you may miss it,no lacing either(I really was'nt expecting any). If I was blindfolded I would swear there was apple juice in my glass,it smells sweet and has a little tangy earthy smell that is mildly intriguing.The taste is not offensive and does go well with food.Some fresh grainy flavors are the first to appear,followed by some nice grassy,slightly bitter hop dryness.Overall I could drink a couple of these and enjoy them again,Asahi was the best part of this crappy little buffet expierience."
"All in all, it was average. It had a clean and crisp character, but otherwise wasn't worth what I paid for it."
"Drinkability: Easy yet unenjoyable. This beer is very forgettable."
""
"D-I would not order this again Sopporo for me with my sushi or Habachi"
"Drinkability isn't bad for this brew. It goes well with sushi and other Japanese foods, but as a brew to drink this summer, I'd only drink it during special dinners."
"Good level of drinkability due to the lack of cloying flavors and low ABV..."
"It's thin, it's got no positive character to speak of, and it is skunked on the nose. And yet, the clean finish and dry character end up making it quite refreshing. And against my spicy tuna roll and hibachi steak and shrimp combo, it goes rather well, complimenting also the crafty chef building onion ring volcanoes and flipping shrimp into his toque. In that scenario, the gleaming silver 33 ounce can isn't an unwelcome companion. Outside of that, however, well, let's just say that most beers have their places, and this one's is in the hibachi restaurant. Enough said."
"D: Very drinkable with this type of meal. I was very satisfied. But I'll go with Sapporo next time."
"This lager pours a light golden color and holds a poor whitish head. The nose is mostly ricey malts and stale hops. The taste, unfortunately, is not much different. Really light with rice and grass. A watery body is highly carbonated. Not the most drinkable brew as it does not taste very good."
"Tried this one at a Japanese steakhouse. Came out bright yellow with a two finger, quickly fading head. Smell of faint corn, rice, grain, nothing exciting. Taste a touch malty then immediately disgusting. Big bubbles makes it hard to enjoy. Definitely doesn't pair well with the otherwise good tasting food!"
"Asahi is made by Molson under the supervision of Asahi beer. After I saw that I was upset, I just ordered a macro. That said there was a slightly different yeast taste in this beer that made it at least drinkable. It was obviously very clear and light. The subtle differences definately propelled this above the standard Molson but it was nothing special."
"Drinkability here is average. If someone has it, and offers it I wont turn it down, however, I might ask for something else."
"My aggressive pour produced an easy three fingers' (!) of rocky, bone-white head with really impressive retention. The nose had a sweet, lager-like aspect to it, which was right for the style. The color was a bright golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. I have to agree with the can's verbiage, which read: "" ... and satin smoothness."" The mouthfeel was very smooth, gliding across my tongue like the back of my hand running down my lover's spine. Just enough to remind me that it was there, but not enough to be obtrusive in any way. The taste was a bit sweet in the mouth, but not in the usual lager-sweet way. It was more subdued, with an idea of sweetness, but then again, not sweet. Definitely not hoppy. Hopheads, look elsewhere. The finish was dry, but it also left a lingering perfume-y taste after the swallow. I did not totally mind it, but I really wish that there had been some hops to offset all of the mild sweetness. Hey, for the price, the jug, I mean huge can, it was a bargain. Do I like lagers? Sure, but is just a kiss of the hops too much to ask for? I remain ambivalent."
"D - Meh. It's OK, nothing off, but exceedingly flavourless."
"Drinkability: I'm quite sure I would've been happy with anything else on the menu, even though there was Sapporo and a few others of the same ilk, and a few domestics. Do folks really drink this style and enjoy it? I'm personally going to be avoiding it, as any other beer would've complimented the sushi I got much better than this. Not really worth a try..."
"Not too terrible at all I thought. In fact it was fairly decent for the style. Typical light gold pour with light head and smelled of corn like malt mainly. Taste was corn like malt with some sweetness, but not too much and no real off flavors. Average body and carbonation for a pale lager. Nothing too special but works fine at a sushi bar."
"Do not waste your time."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1/2"" white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pretty light malt scent. It's crisp and clean with little character. The taste is average. It has a dry pale malt and adjunct flavor that is easily quaffable. It goes down quick and finishes clean. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking Asian lager. It would go good with spicey food or a hot summer day. It's nothing spectacular, but it drinks well."
"Drinkability: Definitely good with Japanese food (I suggest tempura or tonkatsu which are both fried Japanese dish.)"
"another from the sub-par ""Beers of the World"" pack"
"I don't expect these types of beers to have a lot of flavor and aroma but I do expect it to be pleasing. This failed on all counts."
"Smell? Mouthfeel? No. Just ... no."
"Body is thin, fizzy, and watery. I drank about 3 sips and the rest went down the drain. Avoid."
"This is bland and nearly flavorless."
"D - This wouldn't be my first choice in a Japaneses beer its not the worst one that I've had but theres better ones than this"
"D: Super drinkable. Good session beer. Goes well with sushi but little else. Had this after a few good beers and it was like having a glass of water."
"it's actually cheaper by volume in bottle than in the can here in china, so maybe this is a slightly better value after all."
"-Oelergud"
"Clear, average amber yellow with virtually zero head rentention and definetly zero lacing. Somewaht sweet smelling, somewhat grainy with a hint of metal or hemoglobin(j/k) Fairly innoculus at first swig, then there's a sharp bite and it's all down hill from there. Certainly dry ini the finish, but I can't get past the metallic astringincy. Mouthfeel was average. This beer took the finish off of my desk when I spilled a small amount...enough said!"
"Asahi is not an enjoyable lager. It is too puckery and disagreeable in the mouth. First and last time."
"Very wimpy aroma of cooked veggies and a lil pop of the euro yeast skunk. But the taste was not bad  a clean and crisp lager taste with a steady flow of malt. Tad high import priced at over $7 for a sixer, but would make for a good beer for a tasting of import lagers."
"D - Probably scored higher than what it really is because this beer is supposed to be, well, bland. I guess it's probably suited to delicate japanesse cuisine."
"Could drink a lot of these if you wanted to, not filling beer"
"A fuzzy two- finger white head, a bit soapy, but it settled quickly enough. Clear yellow or pale gold in colour with moderate carbonation initially. It smelled more of the aluminum can it came out of than anything else. It tasted dry alright wth only a hint of anything that might approach a hop, very muted in that regard. Dry again in the mouth with a bit of refreshment value. Aftertaste, however, was a wee bit salty, the finish sharp and abrupt. Eventually went flat. Not what I'd like to be drinking all night but okay for a short while around a campfire."
"D: One of the better mass-produced beer's that I have had, but really nothing to make me come back with it, though this would be good with sushi or a nice Japanese dinner at Matsu on Talbert."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was a very pale straw color. It had a decent white head that quickly faded into a thin foam fed by average carb. The aroma was awful. Skunked with no other redeming qualities to it. The taste was just as bad. Mouthfeel was very watery. Just not a good beer at all and would never have again. Would rather have a Bud Light than this mess. (1.5, NA, ML, N)"
"Final Statment: What did I expect from a Japanese rice lager brewed under contract by Molson? Not much."
"from a 12oz can pours a very clear pale yellow color with a white head. this beer really has no aroma to it at all. this beer really doesnt have any flavor either, just slightly sweet with just a hint of bitterness and very watery. i think i will pass this beer up in the future."
"Overall: Another average Japanese macro-lager."
"Asahi Super Dry pours a golden yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. A little bit of grainy malt sweetness is noticeable in the aroma. The flavor is also mostly malt, it's a bit grainy, maybe the slightest bit of hops too. Corn husk like flavor in the aftertaste. Not too bad, but nothing worth going out of the way for."
"Drinkability was OK. I'd take this over American lagers which are unbalanced and too rich with adjunct flavors. At least this goes down like water. I've had worse."
"Overall, the taste is a bit odd and a bit bland. At least it's actually imported from...Canada?"
"Had this with dinner last night at the Hibachi steakhouse. It was the last one on their menu I had not tried, so you know I had to try it. Poured a pale golden yellow, very clear with lots of visible carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass. Initial head was a big white fizzy mess that dropped back down to earth, or nothing, and essentially left a pale yellow fizzy liquid in front of me. No lace to speak of whatsoever. Smell was very light grain or rice. It did have a noticeable smell though which was an improvement over my first beer(see last review). The feel was very crisp, short lived, with a clean, and a slightly dry finish, not super dry or whatever that should mean. The flavors were somewhat muted, what was there was a grainy, yeasty, rice sort of taste, like a liquid crispix beer. Served ice cold this is not that bad, and it is definatly drinkable, if it is ice cold. I have had worse beers, and I have had alot better. I would really like to try a damn fine Japanese beer, it seems the only ones I ever see are these muted macro lagers. Someone bring on something good!"
"They were either out of or stopped serving our usual yakitori companion, Sapporo Reserve, so I gave this a shot. Next to Kirin it was much better. Couldn't see it in the opaque cup but as it poured it was golden--we all know what macrolagers look like, so who cares? Foamy white head. Very little detectable aroma but no skunk. Taste is clean, crisp, and yes, dry, mild pleasing bitterness. This beer refreshes and to wash down grilled chicken parts I was quite happy...will probably order this for our regular yakitori outings...I am strating to crave grilled chicken heart and gizzard already..."
"16oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. The aroma is some faint grain and just a touch of hops. The taste is clean and crisp with some graininess up front with a dry finish that is mildly hopped. Overall, this is a decent brew but it does not possess anything that makes me want to try another."
"Typical Japanese rice beer. Pours a decent yellow-gold with a nice white head. Smells of malt and little else. Tastes dry, very little malt, not much hops either, but balanced. Feels thin on the tongue, very carbonated. Very light and refeshing however with several pieces of fresh sushi."
"I have had lots of these thaks to Joe at Susi Sapporo. Looks like your average macro lager. Clear gold color. Small head with average retention. Very little smell. Very little flavor. Dry finish. However, very good while waiting for good sushi after a 12 hour work day."
"Avoid if at all possible."
"D: A very easy to drink beer due to its light, almost water-like, flavor. It's smooth and goes down very easy. I guess it goes well with sushi, that's the only time I ever get it."
"M/D: very crisp, not as dry as i expected it would be. it is relatively refreshing not much carbonation. a decent beer, but not great"
"This is a delicious change of pace.A nice crisp taste with little or no aftertaste.This beer offers little carbonation without any bloating.Slightly higher price than your average beer but your tastebuds and stomach will thank you for it.In my opinion give it at least a try!"
"This beer poured a straw like yellow but wasnt too bright. With a foamy head that left quickly and left athin film with lacing as i drank it. The beer as tated in the name haws a ver dry mouthfeel that is actually quite plesaent and refreshing. Th smell is has some hints of malt but obviously rice overwhelms the smella as well as most of the taste. It has minimal bittrness. Overall a good Asian beer IMHO. I drink it everytime i go to any Japanese restaurant."
"Clear pale yellow, white head settles fairly quickly. slightly fruity grainy smell. Rice taste is present. The faintest hop flavor as well. Very watery mouthfeel, Very easy to drink, but not much taste to speak of. Could easily drink this over a long evening. It went well with the sushi i had for lunch today."
"This is the first time I've had the Asahi. It poured a pale yellow with a white head that faded and had little lacing. Smelled of rice and a faint yeasty quality. Tasted of light hops and grainy, but mild and was pretty refreshing. It was very dry and didn't leave an aftertaste, but it was quite pleasant and complimented my sushi dinner. I usually drink Sapporo at Japanese restaurants, but I think i've found it's replacement wherever the Asahi line is served, this was much better than Sapporo in my opinion."
"22 oz. bottle- color of pale yellow, with a short off white head - nose of mild hopps , some cereal , oats , and not much else  taste of mild hops , malt , and acidic quality - body watery , crisp , and dry  aftertaste of almost nonexistent except minimal hopps"
"D - This isn't bad. It is the first I've ever had of the stye. It is still fairly similiar to most import lagers."
"On the macro spectrum, I'd put this in between Bud Light and Heineken, but that's not so hot. If I lived in Japan and needed a lawnmower beer, I might go for this. Maybe."
"Pours pale wheat colors with a thick foamy head, a little bit of lacing. Looks like a light pilsner. Smell is very light grains, malts. Taste is also light, almost like seltzer. It isn't bad per se, just nothing stands out either."
"D-I dont think i will be having this again. All i can say is at least it didnt ruin my enjoyment of my sushi. sort of went well with my shiokara"
"Obviously catering to a market that don't really want a beer that's going to challenge the tastebuds, which is fine. There's certainly nothing unpleasant about it. I can also imagine it being a good accompaniment to Japanese food, the ""clean crisp taste"" complementing a cuisine focused on fresh ingredients and letting the delicate flavours of the food have the limelight. However for me there are plenty of other mass produced lagers that offer more than this. In both the UK and Australia Asahi is marketed as a premium lager with a corresponding price tag, but all you are getting for this is the packaging. I had a sip of my wife's Nastro Azzuro and this was in a different league by comparison."
"Pale yellow color with a fizzy head that rises and falls quickly. Smells grainy, adjuncty. There's some kind of fake sweetness in there. It has a cereal type grainy flavor. A bit of a sharp acidity at the top with basically no body. A main flavor I get is paint which is not good. Finish is dry but only because there was basically nothing to it. Really lacking in all aspects."
"D: very drinkable with the right food (sushi)."
"Overall, very drinkable. Nothing too exciting but nothing offensive. Went quite well with the Japanese food I was eating. Certainly good enough that I had another big bottle."
"This was my first and last 'Super Dry Asahi' unless I am stranded on a Polynesian island and this is all that is available."
"Drinkability - I could drink a lot of this because it tastes like H2O."
"D: Probably one of the best sushi beers. Unobtrusive and complimentary to sushi."
"Surprisingly hoppy smell straight away. Little nutty and wheaty afterwards. Pleasant light amber color. Very clean taste. But you can still taste that bit of riciness at the end, along with a mild carbonated bite. Overall a clean and very very drinkable beer. Draft of choice hands down in any restaurant, izakaya, snack bar, etc. in Japan."
"Asahi Super Dry is very direct and simple, with the smallest amount of malt and hops necessary to make it legally permissible to call it beer. The flavor is adjunct- laden, with light grain as the primary taste and almost no hop taste at all. There is the slightest taste of grassy hops but they are flushed away quickly as you drink, leaving behind the taste of light, sweet malt. It is easy drinking, that is for certain. But it is no better than other macro- brewed beers and it should be avoided if possible."
"Probably wash the wasabe down quite well, but I wouldn't drink it on a daily basis."
"Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a light golden yellow color with a small white head. It has a faint smell of grain and rice. There isn't much of an aroma at all. The taste is pretty much the same, like grain and rice. Not a strong flavor, but it's not offensive either. The mouthfeel is light, has a good amount of carbonation and it's crisp and refreshing when drank cold. But it's mostly like any regular macro lager. It's not something I'd drink all the time, but I could drink a couple now and then."
"D: Should appeal to most macro drinkers... but I didn't have any trouble consuming it either."
"Not much here. This went well with the spicy noodle soup I was eating at the time, but at that point, anything wet and cold would have worked. Without the label, I would just assume this was another BMC macro product. This had the same lack of aroma, taste and finish."
"Light golden color with a white head that lingers for a moment. Not much in the nose. No flavor. Somewhat fizzy. Drinks super clean, no after taste whatsoever. Ok, this is the lamest review I have ever done, but this was just about the lamest beer I've ever had."
"Drinkability: It's not bad ice-cold and straight out of the can... but even then it's not exactly a joy to drink. Not recommended."
"I don't recomend this one. Save a buck or two and just order from the domestic selection. I wish I would have ordered a glass of the excellent plum wine my girlfriend had. Or some saki."
"D- Not a beer to complement food but to get out of the way of it. Didn't clash with any of the multitude of flavors from the japanese food. Good and bad as I like beer to accentuate my foods not hide from them. If you just need a beer to go with whatever, this will do the job nicely. Would not drink this normally unless at a Japanese place, when in Rome..."
"I had this beer prior to dinner at a Japanese steakhouse. Poured from a bottle, its a light yellow color with a small, short-lived head. The beer smells faintly of grain, with a brief note of hops. As promised on the label, the beer is very dry, with almost no sweetness in the taste at all. Unfortunately, that also eliminates a lot of the flavors that make a beer tasty. Theres a little bitterness in the (abrupt) finish. Light mouthfeel. Nothing about this beer is particularly bad, its just very empty, so theres also little to praise."
"This beer is similar to your Macro, especially with the obvious adjunct. However, it did seem to lend a little more flavor (which could be improved a little with some hints of hops). Maybe I'll try it again with sushi."
"Not a bad brew when you consider the style. Smells sweet, lagerish. Tastes sweet as well, with some hops but not a hell of a lot. Says super ""dry"" on the label - I'm not sure what that means though. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice bubble, slightly sticky, thick sweetness you don't expect from a lager of this kind."
"This beer lacks some complexity, but redeems itself in being refreshing and easy to drink."
"Drinks okay, certainally a cut above BMC, but nothing to get excited about. Look for a sapporro review soon, since that's the last beer they have there beside american whizz beers"
"12 ounce brown bottle with no freshenss date to be found.Pours a clear gold straw color with a nice fluffy head. Some lacing clings to the glass. Not much in the aroma department other than a little grainy malt and faint hops.The flavor was of light malt with dry, crisp finish. Highly drinkable, just not much going on in the flavor department."
"Maybe my taste buds are off, but this wasn't sooo bad. There's some color in the body, the head shrinks, but never goes away, there's no DMS, and very little offensive corn flavor. It's still a virtually tasteless macro lager, but it's not nearly as hateable as many of the others."
"It seems like the guys at Asahi have gone to far in their effort to make a 'clean & dry' beer. Avoid!"
"D: Easily drank but not good at all. I was very disappointed seeing I ordered this beer for my birthday lunch, went out for sushi, and was severely let down."
"Definitely drink this one in the summer with sushi."
"as far as I remember the Japanese one is much better ...."
"I have had lots of Asahi in the can, but this is my first time with this one in the bottle. Of course this isn't spectacular compared to the likes DFH or 3F's, but then again, it isn't that kind of product and it isn't marketed toward that kind of consumer. For what this product is, I really enjoy it. It poured a crystal clear golden straw colour with a 15mm snow white head that lasted for approximately 90 seconds. I was actually impressed with how long it hung around, quite honestly. Even when it faded, it did not go away completely. It simply subsided to about a 5mm blanket across the top. Thick sticky lacing clings to the sides of the glass. Has almost a green apple smell to it. You can certainly smell the rice and the rice-alcohol in this. Doesn't smell terrible by any stretch. Taste is slightly yeasty with some definite rice sugar sweetness present. I typically do not go for the Japanese rice lager style, but if I had to pick one, it would certainly be this over Kirin. I also like the dryness of the finish on this one. It is what it is, I suppose."
"Overall: Imported from  Canada!, but perhaps it is the oriental part of Canada. Whereever it is brewed, it is nothing to write home about, unless the grass needs cutting. It is fairly clean, except for the very faint (and not really all that objectionable) metallic aroma."
"Overall: Not a bad beer. Wish it had more of a nose and better head retention."
"Some carbonation on the tongue is the only mouthfeel worth noting. About as drinkable as a typical American beer. Does work well cleansing the palate between the tuna roll and the salmon nigri at the sushi bar."
"Taste is quite weak, extremely thin in body, very watery and uncomplex. If I didn't know better I'd say this was a ""lite"". There's mostly just a slight sweetness and a hop presence that is so far in the background it's tough to find. This is drinkable, but only in an extremely cold glass so you can't taste it. Not that there's much to taste in any case."
"Very fizzy, but refreshing and actually kind of fun. Very nice on a humid boat day."
"Drinkability: This is a decent enough offering, that I would have again when having more traditional Japanese food. Best of the Japanese brews I have had."
"Light watery mouth. Just enough carbonation to give it something more than water. I don't regret buying this beer as it has no off or even bad flavors, but I won't buy it again. Too boring."
"Pours a clear yellow, medium sized fluffy white head forms, some spotty lace, no retention. Smell is really sweet, ricy, some caramel, and a little citrus. Taste is almost nonexistant, little bit of malt, some rice, bread, citrus, thats it. Mouthfeel is light bodied, medium carbonation, and a dry finish."
"This is one of my sushi beers. It pours a pale yellow  slightly golden color with a ½ head that lasts for a while and had a little lacing. The smell is of grain and a little bit of light hops. The taste is nice and dry, a little bit more dry than the standard Asahi it seems. It has a very clean taste of grain and some hops but very light on both. It goes well with food and I would not drink it without the food. The astringent aftertaste lingers a bit much for my taste. Not my particular style but if I had to choose between several of the American Light Lagers and this, I would choose Asahi."
"Light bodied, as expected. I could (and did) drink so much of this, and not get tired of the flavor. Asahi in America simply sucks, get it on tap in Japan and you will see the huge difference."
"Overall we can confirm the rewiew made 5 years ago."
"The beer had a thin mouth with decent carbonation. While it was able to standup to my excellent spicy Shanghai noodles, it would not be a beer that I would search out to drink on its own."
"A middle of the road macro brew that at least refreshes"
"I'm surprised this beer got such a low rating. I guess people have a certain standard in their heads and anything falling outside that standard will be rejected irrespectlively of any real quality, unorthodox as it may be. This pours a yellow color and is moderately carbonated. It has a somewhat watery mouthfeel, but the taste is great. It really is super dry and as a person who really enjoys a dry alcholic beverage whether it be whisk(e)y or beer this really hits the spot. I used to drink this stuff when I was a kid; I would keep my stash hidden outside my house in the bushes during the winter. Inevitably it would freeze and let me tell you this stuff gets even better when it's been concentrated. I won't have any problems when I go to Japan because this stuff is alright with me. I especially like the 32oz. silver can it looks hilarious when you slowly pull it out of you front pocket, it looks like God's beer and that Asahi font is like a memory trigger."
"The body is light but with some generic sweetness on the back end. A nice crispness but not much to the beer overall."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Tastes like just another lager. It's got a fair bitterness to it, but not enough to recommend it. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Finish is very dry and ultimately the beer is quite refreshing. For a simple to drink beer, you could do worse, but it's quite bland really."
"BB 2006.05. Some white head up on top that actually stays for a while and a clear golden beer. Nose shows some maltyness, litle papery, a hint of hops and the ricecaracter together with some alcohol. Taste is pale, watery, oxidised and ricefattoxidation IMO. Nos this is again a big disappointement and mouthfeel is again watery empty and unplesant. Runs down like water but for me no pleasure drinking this."
"The beer is easy to drink, but I probably wouldn't buy another just because there's nothing that really makes me want another one of these beers. Its not a beer that you drink and get the impression of ""Damn this is good!"" Not even ""Oh this is good."" What I got was ""Well, Its better than a macro."""
"mouthfeel is as expected, pretty light. drinkability? well, this isnt quite my cup of tea, uh, beer. probably ok for a rice lager, but i wouldnt be looking for this again."
"Has a massive off white( eggshell) coloured head, even with a careful pour, regulation pale yellow/gold colour for the beer, livelly carbonation. Smell is fresh and not unpleasant, weak hops and quite grainy., Taste again is light with essense of grassy hop and some sweetness from the malts, not great but not horrid. At the start i sort of liked the dry mouthfeel but as this 633ml bottle went on it became less pleasurable and more annoying! Overall not a beer I would buy again, but its far from disgusting. Notes: This was brewed in Canada by Molson."
"super dull"
"This is drinkable beer but nothing really to get excited about one way or another. If in Japan, go for the Sapporo Draft."
"As for the smell, it was fairly mild, with some what I thought was a hint of rice. The taste is similar... very dry as the label suggests, and clean, but without a whole lot in the way of flavor. The carbonation is moderate, and certainly not overpowering. Overall a fairly drinkable beer that would go great with a hot/spicy meal, but not one that I'd sit back and chill with on a quiet evening. Like most beers, probably best in its country of origin... but I'm certainly not making a trip to Japan for this one. Overall not bad, but not amazing either."
"Asahi is very dry as the label indicates finishes complete. A decent session brew at best."
"Drinkability - Being weak and flavorless, effectively slightly alcoholic water, it has potential for drinking it indefinitely and with virtually any food that is complimented by water. Although, I have no idea why one would want to do that to themselves."
"This is a great beer to match with eating at the beach on a hot summer day and it goes very well with fish of all kinds and cooking styles."
"There really isn't that much to this beer. If you breathe in through your nose right before sipping, the skunk aroma overwelms the flavour and it tastes like nothing. This isn't a bad beer, it's just a really non-descript beer that seems like a cheap knock off of a European lager/pilsner."
"poured a pale amber color with moderfate white head that quickly feel to a slight ring. Smell is lightly of malt. taste is a bit malty with a nice dryness. Finish is a tantalizing dryness that is the best part on the beer. A nice, easy, refreshing drink."
"Pours a very light color with a great tall, fluffy head that sticks around for a while and laces the glass. Has a light smell of yeast, not much else in the way of aroma. The flavor is minimal. Not much sweetness, not much bitterness, not much of anything, really. Almost like drinking water poured into a glass that used to have beer in it. Not a whole lot of carbonation, either. Slightly creamy. Having tasted a fair amount of japanese flavor, I'd say this beer seems to fit right in. Very very little flavor, allowing you to pick out the individual wisps of flavor. All in all, it's very drinkable, you could drink it all day, just like water. I don't mind it, wouldn't turn it down, but probably won't spend the money on it again. I prefer my beer with lots of flavor."
"Poured a sickly pale straw color... tiny white cap that vanishes immediately, no lace, no aroma, no real taste...but very crisp and dry...acheived with agressive infused carbonation and bittering oils. Much like club soda with lemon. At least this is one mega brewer with the guts to fess up to using rice as a main ingedient."
"Overall-a nice change of pace lager from the norm, not outstanding in any respect but you could definitely try this as a change of pace beer sometime when your looking for something different. If your expecting anything more though expect to be dissapointed."
"Drinkability: Definetely, average is the word to remember here. Not bad, but nothing exceptionnal too."
"The taste is sweet, with a slight lingering hoppiness. The beer is slightly too carbonated. I know I am kicking this beer, dont know why but I guess I expected more. It aint bad, and sometimes if you got limited choice, I do choose it. I guess its just an average beer."
"Golden yellow, with a mustardy glow. Head is loose, bluish-white, and doesn't last long. Aroma is thin, clean cereal malt. Rice chex maybe. Subdued sweetness, and minimal hop bite. The malt flavors up front are a little cardboardy, adjuncty, and not sweet in the least (makes sense since this is ""super dry""). Hops come in surprisingly strong and are pretty tasty! Hmmm...could still use more though. No skunk, just a semi-bitter herbal lemon blaze. Finish is dry with lingering cereal malt. Not bad. Might go well with very subtle-y flavored dishes and sushi. Good thirst quencher too."
"Had this at a party last night as the only option. Pours a light yellow without much head. What is there doesn't retain very well. The smell has malt and metal in it, and the taste is obviously dry with rice and metal flavors overpowering pretty much everything else. The mouthfeel is thin and fizzy, but the overall drinkability isn't terrible, I guess. Honestly, I'd prefer a Coors light to this one, if that says anything."
"The mouthfeel was a little watery, but it was rather drinkable, if not one I really enjoyed. Given a choice between this and Bud, I'd pick this, but I'd much rather go for almost any micro."
"Overall, it's an underwhelming experience...but damned if I can't stop drinking these."
"Her smell is very watery, a shy smell of cereal. Her taste is not much, nothing present, shy, very shy, nothing at all no character nothing. The malt takes over and then water. Yep I prefers Japanese cars!"
"It pours a clear straw color with a big tightly packed head that dissipates quite quickly. The aroma is of sweetish malts, some corn husk, and just a whisp of hops. The taste is much the same with a tiny bit of hops and a lot of water. There is virtually no aftertaste in this beer which makes it hard to really enjoy. A beer without an aftertaste is like a car without wheels, it just doesnt fly. That being said, theres nothing offensive about this beer and its worth a try (definitely waayy better than Blue or Canadian)."
"But it is entirely drinkable, not offensive, easy to swallow, and slightly pleasant. Plus, it is a 'best seller!', if that sort of thing is important to you. It makes a perfect companion at the typical Japanese drinking party where beer is treated the same as hard liquor, with (very) slightly larger glasses."
"I always have this beer with sushi, it is good in a glass. Pours a pale golden with a bubbly white head. Smells of hops and bit of grain. Taste is nice and dry, with a crisp finish. Nothing special, but certainly drinkable. I didn't realize this was a Japanese Style... Makes sense."
"Beer is good. Happy (cheap) beering."
"The label says that Asahi Super Dry has 'excellent richness' (uh... no), 'truly refreshing drinkability' (okay, I'll give 'em that one since I'm feeling generous) and has 'satin smoothness' (not a chance). One out of three is pretty good in baseball, and might even win you a batting crown, but doesn't cut it in this case. Avoid this one."
"Served as a bottle and a frosted glass. Clear light gold with brief white head. Faint sweet scent. Clean malt taste develops a metal tinge as it warms. Fine, sharp prickly carbonation with a sweet corn aftertaste. What's so dry about it? It's still a hell of lot better than Singha. At least I can finish the bottle without getting a headache. I'd have it again if there's a bowl of edamame involved."
"A below average brew that wont offend anyone."
"Yellow and very clear. Fizzy with absolutely no head retention. Very mild aroma with some bread yeast and a bit of hops. Some sweetness at the front switches to a short-lived sharp hop bitterness. The finish is very dry, but is certainly not due to hops. Slightly metallic aftertaste which is probably contributing to dryness. Light and fizzy, moderate smoothness except at the finish."
"1.5"" fizzy, bubbly, white head with huge bubbles. Clear, rich gold beer with lots of carbonation. There are nuts, ink and sweet shpunku in the nose. A tangy, citrusy front leads to a thin, cheesy body. The finish is a little fishy with some toasty crackers. It's dry and citrusy-fresh. Not bad. Gets fairly nutty at the end."
"This is quite a boring beer. I guess it could be considered crisp and maybe even easy to drink, but I could not imagine drinking too many of these. There is nothing here that would want to make me come back to this beer."
"I guess I should start off by saying that I wasn't expecting much from this beer, and I got even less than that. This beer is just horrible. It is very dry and I can't say that it plays to its advantage. This is falls into the swill macro class. I am really gonna have a hard time finishing this one. I think I am gonna need a SN stout chaser."
"Overall Impression: Some good points, but it all falls apart in the taste. Smells fairly inviting, had a nice head, not unpleasant on the tongue, but the taste just didnt do it for me. Have to admit a bias toward the style, so Ill have to adjust my scores up slightly, but I dont think I can finish this one. Ill use it as sacrifice to our troops in Iraq, who Im sure wouldnt turn it down."
"Drinkability: I had no problem drinking this beer every day for a week in Japan. It's better than Kirin and more drinkable."
"The beer after forsaking the 33.8 ounce can pours to a crystalline gold color, the head in portly in size and is a bright white color, the texture is semi-creamy with the residual lace a thin veil to obfuscate the glass. Nose is all malt; fresh and crisp, start is quite sweet and fair to middling on the malt with the top thin. Finish is authoritarian in its acidity, the hops apropos to the style, quite dry and makes a good palate cleanser for the Real Ales to come."
"overall- a typical Japanese beer. Too watery, too sweet, goes good with rice and noodles but otherwise not worth drinking. At all!"
"Not real drinkable, I know 3 types of Sapporo that are better."
"Kinda plain and bland. Seems as though it's missing something..."
"good, but nothin special"
"If you're having sushi and need a Japanese beverage with alcohol but can't stomach warm sake, give it a try. If you're in the supermarket and see it on the shelf, run away, run far away."
"Very pale clear yellow under a one finger head that lasts surprisingly long, and even manages to muster some body before fading to film. There are a few drops of lace on the glass. The smell is so mild as to be nearly non-existent, with just a hint of sweetness. The mouth is well carbonated and a bit heavy sour. The taste is mild, and, yes, dry. There may be a hint of the rice, but no sign of the corn. Rather, the opening is grainy and a touch lemon sour, while the finish is less hoppy bitter than wet paper moldy. The aftertaste leaves the impression of wet socks. I actually didn't think the first few sips were that bad, but this beer has grown on me in the negative sense. Not sure I'll finish it... The Czechs should be ashamed!"
"This is a very pale straw color that lacks in head. Smells of almost a hay and grains. The taste is very dry like the label suggests. Leaves much to be desired. There is really something lacking in this beer. The aftertaste is not very noticable. The label says it was made under the supervision of Molson but how could they let somehthing like this leave the brewery? I wan't a big fan of this ""import"""
"Decent. A dark yellow/golden colour with a nice white head of foam. The smell is like that of regular beer, a bit of malt, a bit of hops, and not much else going on. The taste is just like the aroma, as straight forward a brew, as i've ever drunk. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but decent and the drinkability is OK. Not the worst."
"Really decent beer that goes with any type of Japanese food. But I do not aspire to drink merely decent beer."
"This beer poured to a clear gold with a head that was gone quickly. There was very little aroma. The taste was crisp and grainy. Good carbonation. Not much hop presence and kind of watery. The ""super dry"" premise? Not that dry, any dryness was probably more noticeable due to the near absence of any other ingredients. There was a slight sweetness in the aroma and taste as it warmed up. I had to try one, but I don't think I'd have one of these again."
"So dry and carbonated theres not much flavor to this one. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at a japaenese restaurant."
"I heard that it is brewed in the Czech Republic."
"I'm sure this beer gets dissed alot, just because it's probably so accessible outside of Japan, but I have to admit that if I'm out in Japan, this is probably my beer of choice, despite my otherwise undying loyalty to Sapporo. This beer's to be ""superdry"". I don't know about all of that but it tastes EXCELLENT very very very cold, in a very very very cold mug--which Japanese bars and restaurants seem to understand. I think the talk of this beer matched with sushi or whatnot is a bit of baloney: it's a macrobrewed pilsener, the Bud of Japan--but NOT the BUTT of Japan. I enjoy drinking this beer--which is important. Just as there are moments when a Budweiser tastes excellent, there are those same moments for this beer. Give it a try extra cold: my personal recommendation."
"Match with suhi. Was better in Japan where fresher and less watery or corn tasting. Dry! Have to follow up with a full 16 oz. water. Not for everyone. Slight lemon finish and liked it with a slice of lemon. Good for its style but not much going on for you beer pros."
"ive never actually had this with japanese food, so perhaps this is where im missing the point. i wouldnt drink too many of these in succession on their own, ive found them just a bit too full on and overall unbalancd. perhaps with some sushimi or teppanyaki i might find a more suitable place for it. worth a try but not a keeper."
"Overall, I didnt think too much of this beer. It was almost too dry, leaving me feeling kinda parched instead of refreshed. The medicinal aspect of Super Drys flavor profile did little to endear it to me. Ill order something else if I see it on a menu anywhere and it wont find its way into my fridge again."
"Accented my left-over ribs just fine."
"A highly compromised imitation of a classic style. Doesn't hold a candle to Sapporo Draught in the steel can imported from Japan."
"Try not having a beer for 2 weeks then jumping into this combination. You'd be as hyped as myself."
"This beer pours a yellow color with a small head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is pretty boring. The taste is slightly better than Sapporo, but still very much like Bud Light. It is very uninteresting because it is a mass product, but it is the best Japanese beer I am familiar with."
"This beer pours a clear medium light golden color with a large white head that dissipates to small and slightly clingy. The smell is mildly malty and grainy. The taste has an odd sweetness(probably atributed to the adjuncts) with a medicinal bitterness. The mouthfeel is not surprisingly on the thin side of firm. Overall an uninteresting lager that considering the sweetness makes the name ""superdry"" difficult to understand."
"Clear medium gold appearance with a slight white head that turns down quickly. Little glass adhesion. Lawn clippings aroma, light grass and associated aromatics and weedy huskiness. Lots of carbonation, at first matching a lightly sweet graininess but later, re-inforcing some very astringent hop and metallic flavors. As in some, the overcarbonation makes the sharpness linger into the aftertaste, popping up the back of the nasal cavity. The finish of this beer is its downfall -- unsettling, medicinal, and gassy..."
"The good notes are it is refreshing at first when cold and it is drinkable with Japanese food. That is the only time I ever have it. Not too many Japanese restaurants with micro brews on tap."
"This lager poured a clear, golden straw color with thick, creamy white foam. Not much smell to speak of, but a bit of malt aroma. The taste was mildly malty, with a bit of hops. The mouthfeel was clean and crisp with medium-light body. Not bad when served cold with some yakitori. Decent, at least in Japan on draft."
"Medium gold color, medium head. Dry hopped and slightly malty. Medium bodied. Crisp and clean taste. Good hop/malt balance. Better than average Euro-lager. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is very dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Crisp, clean and refreshing."
"A 500mL bottle of Japanese beer which says it was brewed in the Czech Republic on the back. Hey, it can't be that bad. And it isn't, but it isn't anything spectacular either. A fair middle-of-the-road beer, it's usually my first choice when out for sushi, and I suppose the meal either enhances it or masks its flaws. Pours out with a big white cloudy head that lasts a while, and leaves a bit of lace in it's wake down the glass. Colour is a straw gold, with lots and lots of bubbles. The nose is a bit metallic, and the taste is very dry, the flavour nearly comes and goes before you can pick up on it. Very faint taste of grains and light hops. Mouthfeel is akin to almost any higher end marco lager. An okay match for sushi or hot weather barbecuing, but it needs to be partnered up to enjoy."
"Drinkability/notes: I found the aftertaste of this beer to be quite unpleasant. It was not the bitterness that I objected to, but rather the harsh and lingering medicinal quality. I will not be drinking this again unless it is free."
"Well well, this beer from japan was contractually made in canada. Wont make much of a difference, this will be the last one of these ill have. It reminds me of a few of the 'macro lights' that many of us love to joke about. Only difference is that this one probably isnt dirt cheap (got it in my international sampler, so i dont know the individual price). Stick with your natty light if youre into this flavor."
"Pale golden color, sudsy head that dissipated to a thin white ring and left a very tiny amount of lace as it went down. Smell is not strong, mostly grainy. Taste is weak grain with a very low hop flavor and low bitterness. finishes very clean with little aftertaste. Feels watery. Yes, it is dry in that it is not a sweet beer, but it does not parch you like Sapporo. The sample I tasted was brewed under contract by Molson in Toronto."
"Pours out very clear and straw yellow. I like that the label claims this ""Super Dry"" is the ""Beer for All Seasons."" Heads up with a clear white foam that doesn't last more than a minute. A nice mix of sweet malt and herbal hop in the nose. Not a lot of flavor in this somewhat smooth brew, though it fills the mouth with crispness and refreshes. Finishes with an understated blend of hop and grain. It's brewed by Molson and sure tastes like it."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a thin white head that immediately fades into a trace amount of bubbly lace. Nose is grain husks and is a bit metallic. Very light in body with an initially sweet taste that soon turns to a flavor of stale grains and rice, maybe a bit of cardboard as well. Mild amount of hops in the very dry finish. Not a beer Ill be buying more of."
"As light beer goes, and this is probably the lightest beer that I would ever intentionally drink, it wasn't too bad. Clear straw color with crisp malty taste was really all I expected from this beer, so I guess I wasn't dissapointed. I was drinking this with chinese food and went well. Certainly not heavy, but able to compliment spicey food"
"Had a few on a recent overseas flight. Surprised by its nice balance of flavors. Pale straw color. Medium light body. Mild bitterness. Mild malt. Mild hops. Dry. Reminscent of fruits. Pleasantly clean with a refreshing carbonated note and a lingering bitterness. Overall, a nice effort from japan."
"As for the beer itself, its clean and refreshing and works well with food. On its own, it isn't overly enjoyable, but its blend of hops and malts, with an emphasis on the hoppier side of things makes it a great accompaniment to some good food."
"Clear shiny golden color. Fizzy white head. Head left in seconds. Moderate glass shaking kept it alive. Wierd mixed smell of stale corn water, iron ore, and sour mash. Taste was oddly corn like. Some sour old beer tastes as well. Faint fizzy, hop presence. Not much though. Thin watery finish. Taste reminded me of burnt scrambled eggs when I finished. I tried to stay positive on this one, but couldn't get much out of it. I'll have a Sapporo next time or ice water. Although the food was great !"
"This is nice, I could consume a number of these critters in any given session. Appearance is its weak point, really nice colour with limited head. Aroma is crisp and clean. Taste is of a well balanced brew with an ever slight lean towards the hops. Body is medium light which leads to a higher drinkability."
"Clear, golden in color topped by a good sized bright white head that holds well. The head drops to a good collar and light surface coating but leaves no lace. The aroma is of a sweet, grainy malt with minimal background hops. The body is light with a fine, median carbonation that's crisp in the mouth, but also smooth. The flavor starts sweet but soon reveals interwoven notes of hop flavor, and a balancing bitterness. As you progress through the glass the bitterness builds on the palate. The finish is dry with a light spot of bitterness that lays at the back of the throat. Very clean. Well brewed. A nice, mainstream beer that actually has a touch of bitterness to it."
"Not much going on here. Completely mild and unremarkable. Thick head that disappeared fast, typical lager coloring. Really lacking in the taste department though. I am still waiting for that first really good Japanese beer."
"Interesting to note: japanese beer, but brewed for our consumption by the Czechs."
"Asahi is a pretty drinkable beer, but nothing significant.  The pale golden colour and magically disappearing head are unimpressive.  The smell is weak and the taste is fairly indistinguishable.  The body is fairly light with a slight bite on the toungue.  Although this brew is not 'super,' it is pleasantly dry and drinks pretty nice, although I would not compromise my sushi with it.  A good choice to drink when thirsty by itself, and probably better with food.  I would not turn my nose up at it."
"Went out for Chinese food, the take out kind, (sweet and sour pork with steamed rice) and picked up a 21.4oz bottle of Asahi with a twist off cap. Asahi Super Dry poured a light golden straw with a nice head that cleared to a wispy ring soon after. Taste is hops bitter up front with the malt not far behind then comes the dry and pleasantly bitter after taste that will linger on for a bit. There is also some slightly detectable yet undefinable carbohydrate sweetness.  The carbonation charge was still ample even with the twist off cap. Asahi Super Dry is a nice table beer that goes well with Chinese food."
"Asahi Super Dry really has little flavor, mouthfeel, or aroma.  It's very watery, and as the name implies, crisp and dry."
"Pours a shiny clear yellow/golden or maybe straw color, head dies very young. There are slight peppery saaz hop notes on the nose as well as on the palate, nothing great in this brew, it is truly refreshing and crisp though. The finish is dry of course. Overall drinkable, refreshing, but as the name states... its super dry, drinkable but pretty bland IMO, it is lacking in the taste department."
"Clear dark straw hue.  The head dissipates quickly.  Mild Saaz hop nose & a bit of light graininess in aroma.  Light in body as expected.  Decent balance of light hop bitterness and malt sweetness, but unfortunately slightly offputting cooked veggie flavors come through in the finish. Super Dry is a bland lager, with only a bit more overall character than an American macrobrew.  There are better thirst quenchers out there."
"One of those drinkable but not interesting beers, a bit expensive for what you get, not much taste, dry-ish and a bit grainy, only drink it if the weathers hot."
"Very light but somehow looks like stained glass. No head, perhaps a poor pour. It was very dry and veyr pleasant to drink. Relatively plain taste, goes well with just about any food as such. It had an odd 'tongue on battery' type of light taste at first, which wasn't too bad."
"A very drinkable beer. It's good with a meal when you don't really want to pay attention to the beer. In my opinion, that's all most lighter colored beers are good for. For the style, it ain't bad, but it also ain't worth the price."
"Had one of the big bottles, 21 ozs? States that it is brewed in Canada by Molson. Bit darker than I thought it was going to be with a strawish golden colour ... the head lacked big time. Husky almost metal-like aroma, little hay in there also. Thought it would be bone dry but there was a touch of residuals in the front, crisp finish was very dry. Lots of husky malt with metallic undertones from an astringent flavour, hops were quick and snappish with a sharp bitterness that went hand and hand with the husk flavour. Not a beer that I'll go back to."
