3.56,55.5,4,3,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is weak, but clean and dry. It has the scent of pale malts and lager yeast. The taste is decent. It has a dry finish. The beer is pretty simplistic in flavor. There is the presence of pale lager malts and not much else. It tastes refreshing and clean. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. It drinks well; a fine lager.","WesWes","Jan 08, 2004"
2.87,25.3,2,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"In the mouth, there's low carbonation, just enough to feel at the end of a gulp if not taken too quickly. A very much drinkable beer. The carbonation disappears completely no doubt but the maltiness rounds out and the covers the bitterness over.","donnebaby","Jan 06, 2004"
3.03,32.3,3,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Its slightly hazy golden body is topped by a decent-sized head of creamy white foam that diminishes shortly but leaves some thin lace in its wake. The nose displays some lager yeast sulphur over a bit of grainy malt and a drop of floral hoppiness. The body is light, and it's gently crisp with a fine and median carbonation before warming to become slightly creamy across the palate. But apart from its sulphur constituent, the flavor is not much different than most mass-produced American lagers. Its lightly grainy, but obviously adjunct-influensed, character is balanced by a firm bitterness and some dull, leafy, herbal, and grassy hops. It finishes short and dry - almost like a light beer! There's not alot going on here.","NeroFiddled","Dec 07, 2003"
2.18,-4.8,2.5,2,2,2.5,2.5,"The head, made of big, frothy bubbles, was initially large but quickly receded into a thin film; the lace made a valiant effort to stick and wasn't entirely unsuccessful. There was a touch of citrus and cereal to the aroma but there really wasn't anything noticeable or noteworthy about the smell. Therefore, it wasn't surprising, after taking the aroma into consideration, that the beer was virtually flavourless. The aftertaste was skimpy, lemony and slightly bitter. I suppose Kirin is drinkable (perhaps, as a palate cleanser when you put an extra large dollop of wasabi in your mouth) but I don't see much point in trying another.","mwrseeley","Nov 13, 2003"

2.64,15.3,2,3,2.5,3,2.5,"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized off-white bubbles that quickly disappeared. It had a medium strength aroma of fruit and a smooth fore and after taste. Its flavor contained notes of malt, bread and roasted nuts.","TheDM","Jun 25, 2003"

Taste is an overly processed grainy husk flavor and is a bit astringent. Very light in body. This is simply a bad beer. Several other reviewers mentioned that it goes well with certain foods, and that might be true, but I drank it by itself, and its not good alone.","Morris729","Feb 06, 2003"

The beer was a nice golden color with a little bit of a white head to it. It had a nasty aftertaste of skunkiness. All in all, it's a bad brew, maybe I got a bad batch of it.

Malt nose, clean and crisp the front is sweet, top skimpy. Finish is hop spicy, middling in its acidity, droughty aftertaste, drinkable as Lagers go, but not a real hit me, but then nine out of ten lagers/pils elicit that reaction from this old Stout and Belgian strong lover. I think these bad boys have corrupted my Buds as in taste.","Gusler","Dec 01, 2002"

2.03,-11.4,2,1.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Not a striking sight with a golden straw colour and foamy, white head.  The smell is a turn off that is musty short of stinky/skunky.  Taste too metallicy for a bottled brew, but has hoppy tones.  Aftertaste lingers a bit much.  The feel is pleasantly light and airy but a shade too biting.  It drinks better than it looks or smells.  Would be best suited for post-lawn mowing thirsts.  I do not know about the sushi thing as I would prefer a better beer for such a meal. I would not trun my nose up to it, it is beer afterall.","BillyBrew","Jun 25, 2002"

This one had a weird biting acidic smell, then a simialer taste. No really positive tastes. Mostly some acidic finish tastes, very harsh. (Is it the rice ?) I didn't care for it. If presented with a choice, I prefer the Ichiban. Owned by AB, but tried not to let that influence the tasting.","StevieW","Jun 06, 2002"
2.32,1.3,2,2.5,2,2,3,"Pale color, big bubbled head that splits in an instant.  Very weak in most categories, head, color, flavor.  Watery to the extreme, though I taste no corn characteristics.  But with such little malt flavor, it might benefit from a little sweetness.  It is dry but the hops are uninteresting.  I had a lot of Kirin's in Japan as well and it doesn't come off well there, either, IMO...","ADR","May 27, 2002"
