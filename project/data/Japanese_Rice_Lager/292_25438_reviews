"Clear dark yellow body with a small white head. Full bodied malt aroma, with some fruit and flora/grassy notes. Quite sweet, but also dry, with a nice leafiness, reminiscent of a pils. Pleasant bitterness. Medium body and carbonation... quite refreshing taste. Not bad for a macro beer."
"Classic German pilsner, I'd say. Not bad at all."
"Not the worst beer to pick up off the shelf in a combini -- hopefully it sticks around for more than a couple of months. All the best Braumeister."
"D - I was pleasant surprised by this in its robust flavor. I dont think I will be hitting again, but I definately enjoyed this above average beer."
