Pours slightly hazy pale straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon, cracker, light bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with good balance of pale malt, rice, earthy hops, and light yeast notes; with poor strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, light bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, light bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and solid robustness of pale malt, rice, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly dry mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a very solid rice lager style. All around good balance and solid robustness of pale malt, rice, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Beers"

There's also a decent amount of lacing.  Not much to the aroma, the brew smells like sweet malt and some light breadiness.  I think the taste is pretty much like the aroma, it's sweet and bready, but also has a bit of bitterness in the finish.  Also has a flavor that reminds me of Budweiser.  Not sure if it's from the rice, but there's just something similar about it to me.  Mouthfeel/body is light, it has a good amount of carbonation and it's easy enough to drink.  For what it is, it's not a bad brew at all.  I'd just have to be in a certain mood to drink this again, it's certainly not an every day beer for me.  It's worth a try if you've never had it before.","bluejacket74","Oct 24, 2014"

This beer would be enjoyable except for one key point. The major flaw of this beer is a nasty metallic aftertaste it leaves in your mouth after you swallow. It seemed to get worse and stronger the more you drink. I did get this beer from a can, but that aftertaste alone makes me leery of ever trying this again.","MMaxim11","Jun 23, 2014"

Taste is again crisp and clean and would really go with sushi, miso soup, pho or any Asian food fair....because you need to be able to taste the food.

Light in body, a base of grain and some light hops. This is basically a typical macro brewed lager, says its from Japan but it is brewed up north in Canada. Overall, the flavor was typical of a mass produced lager, as the brew warmed it went south quickly. Poor.","GossageBrewery","Jan 05, 2013"

After a long day in the field, I looked forward to the thermal baths at the ryukan where we stayed, then walking over to the beru machine, dropping in my yen coins and getting a big bottle of Sapporo for the evening. It was a special time. Fast forward to yesterday, when I was getting a quick dinner at Tokyo Joe’s. The marketing guys have done a good job; I could not resist the cold bottle of Sapporo on display as I placed my order. Despite the plastic cup, the Sapporo was a light straw color, with active carbonation, pure white head and subtle sweet aroma. The flavor was what I remember, very clean with a light sweetness and faint hop finish. I love this beer for the memories it brings back to me. Despite all of the wonderful IPA’s and Hefewiezens that are out there, there is a place for a great light beer such as Sapporo.","iSip","Sep 10, 2011"

Hopping is very muted and indistinct, giving it a the barest touch of bitterness. Appropriately light for the style, but I find the carbonation prickly and aggressive. This is actually pretty palate cleansing stuff, for what it's worth. If given a choice between the two, I would rather drink Asahi Super Dry at a sushi joint. It's just as palate cleansing and mild, but lacks the unpleasant mustiness of the Sapporo.","mintjellie","Sep 08, 2010"

Taste is very neutral niether sweet nor bitter. Good body and not watery at all, but really no backbone. Kind of a run of the mill adjunct flavor.

This beer went great with the Asian food I ate, but at the same time, just about any run-of-the-mill lager would have done almost as well. I think I paid $3.50, which I think is a standard price for the beer... what a ripoff! I'd much rather get a 12-pack of my local Full Sail Session for $9.

From here on in, we're all generic, and you may as well be drinking budweiser. No scrub that, this isn't as bad as that rice lager, and at least it has a redeeming crispness to its finish. Aroma and taste is all pale malts and metallic hops, which abruptly disappear moments after sipping. The body is lagerish - light and perhaps overcarbonated, but really we're par for the course.

Not much smell to speak of. Somewhat distinctive taste as I mentioned earlier, although it's clearly a light colored lager - no new ground broken. It goes down very smooth, and has a bit of an aftertaste that sticks around for a while. Could very very dangerous in those big cans that seems to appear so quickly at Karaoke bars... but I digress.

Quite well balanced all in all and certainly different than most macro lagers. Mouthfeel is pretty average for this sort of beer. Nothing out of the ordinary there. I find this beer to be very drinkable if you're not a malt or hop fiend. The good balance between malt, hops, rice and even corn is it's best feature.

2.92,2.8,3,3.5,2.5,2,3.5,"This pours a very pale gold with a whiffy white head. The aroma is slightly citrusy and I have to admit, its pretty appealing. The flavor is very dry and absolutely no aftertaste. You taste it when its there, but when you swallow, all flavor is gone. Its bizarre. Its got a little bit of hoppiness to it.","aracauna","Beers"

2.88,1.4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Not bad. Reminds me of a couple of the Polish lagers. Not much flavor, but crisp and clean. None of the macro-sweetness you find in U.S. macros (and their many imitators). Nice appearance, with a foamy head and lacing that lasts. Not too pale. Worth trying, probably good with spicy food.","JohnnyDuvel","Feb 08, 2004"

The taste is about equally as funky, with a very strange taste. Not an overly drinkable beer and not one to seek out.","arizcards","Jan 24, 2004"

2.41,-15.1,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Budweiser with a Japanese twist. It poured a clear golden color with little head. The smell was skunky with the faint scent of hops. The taste was watered down, but I did get a grainy hops taste in it. Like I said before, it seemed very watered down. It had little to offer.","CBFanWish","Dec 26, 2003"
2.26,-20.4,3,2,2.5,2,2,"This beer poured a pale yellow/light gold color that was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head that was produced was pure white in color, and had the consistency of a fluffy cloud, and seemed to last quite some time until it fell to a ring on the edges. The lace that was created was fairly detailed a good way to the bottom of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly faint, but I could detect some sweet malt, faint fruit, hops, and a kind of corn grain. The aroma reminded me of Miller products, Light to be exact. The tastes were also kind of weak, hops, husks, malt, grains and a hint of pine were all I tasted. As it warmed considerably, I noticed some light fruit come out. The aftertaste was just as faint, some pine or hops were just about it and they did not last long. The body was light. Kind of watery on the tongue and over all, very average at best. The bottle and logo seemed to be the best part of this beer","Jarod","Dec 08, 2003"

Taste is virtually non-existent. Starts with faint malt but never goes anywhere. Nothing more than a hint of bitterness, minor spice. Pretty bland. My guess its brewed with a lot of adjuncts.","CRJMellor","Dec 07, 2003"

Hops start big, but then fade into almost nothing. Finish is slightly bitter. I also detected some weird, almost fruity rubbing alcohol notes (sake? just kidding). Not bad, but I'm still not a huge Asian lager fan.","alexgash","Nov 03, 2003"

2.93,3.2,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Came in a brown 600ml bottle. My thoughts are this is just a slightly modified version of Sapporo draft with a shiny gold label. Pours out a pale clear straw and a pretty impressive head. The head manages to stick around more than halfway down the glass to my surprise, and leaves a decent lace. Nose is mild with some sweet malt and only a hint of floral hops. Flavour is dry, vaguely sweet with a mild hoppy finish. Nice full mouthfeel for such a pale lager though. I'd order this one with sushi rather than the draft.","IronDjinn","0"
