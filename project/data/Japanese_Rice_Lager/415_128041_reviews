"This was sold in a single 22 ounce can for 3-something.  Overall, this is a pretty decent adjunct lager."

"Pours out to a nice creamy white head and falls down and leaves bits of lacing. Pale gold color.  Smells of clean grains and spicy/grassy hops. Flavor is crisp, clean and refreshing with a nice hop background. Feels good doing down, light and moderate CO2. Overall, a good choice to wash down sushi or hibachi."
"its wet that the best way to describe Sapporo, but I feel this way about this entire style, its a rice beer and they are mostly devoid of all flavors."
