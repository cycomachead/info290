4.24,27.3,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured a semi-clear rich golden body with one finger of bubbly white head that quickly receded. A very nice looking lager, with a richer color than most examples of the style. Very nice. Scents of softly sweet malt, grainy malt, a light hint of rice and light levels of earthy, dank herbal hops. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic Japanese Rice Lager, very true to form and quite appealing in its delicate, light aroma. Flavor begins lightly sweet, with soft, sweet malt notes and light hints of honey, and a touch of an earthy quality. Middle opens up with more pronounced flavors of honey and a light green tea with honey flavor, alongside softly sweet and bready malt and an undercurrent of earthy hops in the background. Finish is lightly dry with notes of honey, grainy malt and medium-light level of dank, earthy herbal and floral hop character. Aftertaste is medium-dry with notes of earthy and floral hops, lightly sweet honey and a medium-light bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a fantastic Japanese Rice Lager that is rich and flavorful, with a nice balance of sweetness and dryness, ending crisp. Simply fantastic and other examples of the style do not compare. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with medium-high prickly carbonation and a smooth, crisp feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very nice Japanese Rice Lager. Refreshing and crisp, light and balanced. Overall this is the finest example of the style I have sampled. It has a delicate and balanced aroma and flavor, aided by the crisp mouthfeel. Yet it is not weak in aroma and flavor, being both aromatic and flavorful, but in subtle, subdued and balanced ways. A true example of a truly Japanese style of beer.","Auraan","Jan 24, 2015"
3.34,0.3,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,"This poured a slightly golden straw colour with a minimal white head that quickly fades away leaving small islands of head.  The nose is very subtle with a hint of grass/straw, green apple and a mild hoppiness.  The flavour is crisp.  There is a mild graininess and citrus that flavour wise leans to the lemon/lime family but the tartness that is more apple.  A pretty standard lager feel and taste.","Svingjo","Jan 09, 2015"

I enjoy it more than your average cheap macro, but there's so little of interest to take note of that it's hard to give the beer a higher score. The flavor of rice is, of course, present, and while it's not my favorite grain flavor, it's so mild that I can't complain really. The feel is fizzy but nice and light, which I appreciate with this style. It's easy to drink, except you might die of boredom from too many, so that's a minus.

2.93,-12,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is delicate if not thin. Highly effervescent. Really clean on the palate but that's just a result of the lack of flavor. Drinkable but not that enjoyable.","illidurit","Feb 16, 2008"
3.98,19.5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Amazingly drinkable, and perfect for paring with the more subtle nature of Japanese food, the one your West Coast Double IPA will overpower. Try it!","watchnerd","Feb 07, 2008"

3.12,-6.3,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Very floral, fruity, citrus aroma with banana, apple, and a dash of malt. Pours with a large white head that leaves in about 2 minutes. No lacing. Very sweet tasting Japanese beer, almost as if it had corn in it (which I doubt is the case). Dry palate with lively carbonation. Nothing to seek out.","BMan1113VR","Jan 17, 2008"
3.46,3.9,1.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability: Meh. In my opinion this is kind of a waste of koshihikari rice. It's great to eat and it lends a very nice, delicate character to sakes, but gets lost here among the malts and hops. This is a good lager, but it's a good lager that could have been made from pretty much any other cultivar of rice. After tasting it, the koshihikari seems a bit gimmicky to me.","soulgrowl","Dec 30, 2007"
3.16,-5.1,4,3,3,4,3,"Another from Uwajimaya in Seattle. Appearance is a light golden color with a crisp head that keeps a thin film on top when dissapated. Smells is not typical of a macro lager, it's slightly sweeter with rice and grain that is cleaner. Taste is somewhat saline with hint of rice and a good cabonation that dances on the tongue finishing clean with a light mouthfeel. Nothing to dramatic here, just a good one to try.","Bookseeb","Oct 22, 2007"
3.9,17.1,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Nice label. Pours a clear straw with almost no head. Nose is slightly grainy. Flavor is pretty subdued. Overall smooth with a slight grain influence. Feel has a nice bubble on the tongue and a well balanced liquid feel. Very drinkable, but keep the style in mind.","RblWthACoz","Oct 04, 2007"
3.5,5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mouth and drinkability- very crisp, clean, and like the appearance- clear. Easily drinkable, and would obviously go well with sushi or tempura.","Dukeofearl","Aug 19, 2007"
3.3,-0.9,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer evacuates the 500ml brown bottle a clear gold, the head average in size and bright white in color, the texture creamy, as it dematerializes, and the lace forms a thin veil upon the glass. Nose is somewhat sweet, crisp and clean; start has a decent malt presence, sweet with a modicum of bitterness, light to moderate in feel. Finish has a stern acidity, hops light but pleasing and the lingering aftertaste is desert bone dry, I must say on average I like Japanese Rice lagers much more than American macros.","Gusler","Jun 13, 2007"
3.6,8.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, quite drinkable. Good session beer or drink with light food. One of the better beers of the style.","atigerlife","Jun 03, 2007"
4.1,23.1,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,5,"Wow!! this baby is sooo clean and crisp and refreshing that I'd love to see this enter the country in a case of cans. The oversized bottle will work for now.","DogFood11","Feb 22, 2007"
3.88,16.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This was what I'd call a very good version of Asahi Superdry. Say what you want about light lagers, there are good versions that exist that are crips, refreshing, and full of flavor. This is one of them.","SacoDeToro","Jan 23, 2007"
2.9,-12.9,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Drinkability- Very easy going. Good as a dinner brew or as a working out in the yeard brew. The finish does get worse as it warms and flattens.","theopholis","Nov 12, 2006"

2.45,-26.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Overall: Nothing outstanding or vaguely interesting and it suffers from some of the worst aspects of the American Macro lager. A reasonably clean drinking brew that doesnÂ’t take much effort, which is suited to a warm sunny September afternoon in Long Beach.","TheLongBeachBum","Beers"
2.65,-20.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Mouth: Rice. Not in a sake way, but like rice on your plate. Has a strong bubbly mouthfeel. Malts up front and along sides of mouth, almost to the extent of a malt liquor. Has just an inkling of a bitter finish with some warmth and a chewy hop sensation, tingly with chili peppers and a grape skin sweet/bitter character. It's an excellent beer for a hot day in the sun, as long as it's served cold.","clickpush","0"
3.42,2.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"tastes like a japanese rice lager, and a fine one. smooth and thirst-quenching after a hot day. the amazing thing about this beer, and i will probably remember it for this reason, there are no off flavors. as i said, it's probably an old can. but it is still tasty and lacks the tap water taste i get from so many macros. worth a try.","davidchollar","Feb 08, 2005"
3.72,11.7,3,3.5,4,3,4,"It's drinkable but not special in any way. More could have been done with the ingredients, but as is it's just mediocre.","adamatari","Apr 09, 2004"
