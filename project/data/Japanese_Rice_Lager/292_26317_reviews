"Comes in 12 an 20 oz cans"
"The aperance was its strongpoint. Had a very clear golden piss color. Nice frothy head and various size bubbles rising to the top of the glass. Abundant frothy lace. The smell was metalic and sour. There was almost no taste at all, very watered down. I couldnt even detect any flavors at all. The mouthfeel is somewhat crisp in a watery way. Made me burp a lot. I like kirin ichiban but not this ""bar"" beer. May be a good beer for drinking games. This beer was definetly below the bar. pun intended."
"This is a good beer for what it is aiming for. Refreshing, goes well with spicy food."
