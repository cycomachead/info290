3,4.9,,,,,,"Overall: I am generally not a fan of lagers, but this one is my favorite so far (primarily because I can actually taste it). It has more malt flavor, bitterness, and body than something like Stella or Bud Light. It's still too bland for me to drink on its own, but goes well with sushi. The right tool for the right job!","SensorySupernova","Aug 27, 2014"

3.13,9.4,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"I drank this beer before and during dinner at a sushi restaurant. It was a nice compliment to sushi. I tried this beer out of a 22oz can. It's pour resulted in a low, short-lived head and had low carbonation overall. The aroma was light, crisp, and slightly skunky. It consisted of a light, clean, and crisp taste, but was distinctly light and clean - better than an average American pale lager. I enjoyed the difference in the quality of this beer in comparison to other pale lagers. Despite my enjoyment, it wasn't anything extraordinary. It was a nice, new experience, but an average beer, nonetheless.","JonesyMSU","Jan 05, 2013"

Fell a light bronze colour with plenty of effervescence and life. The head was gone before I could blink. Smell was all grain, a little pils malt and a faint herbaceous. The sip was stingy on the tongue - that was the near metallic carbonation at work. Tasted of wet grain, a faint shadow of malt sweetness and a near leafy bitterness. Very shortlived on the palate - frankly I would prefer Asahi Super Dry any day. The only noticeable aspect is the carbonation and the fact that it washes down the oriental spices rather well. Dont expect anything more from this one.","BeerSingh","Sep 01, 2011"

Might be a bit more carbonation here than what I'm used to getting in an Bud, but that's about it.

It is a bit more balanced and more drinkable than things like Miller High Life or Pabst Blue Ribbon, but it is also a little more expensive considering the fact that it has been imported. If you're an rabid anime fan or Japanophile, this is an ideal beer to prove how obsessed you are; othewise, I suggest opting for a domestic equivalent. On the other hand, taking its Japanese origins into account, Sapporo is light and subtle enough to compliment fairly delicate foods like sushi without overpowering the flavors as stronger, more blatantly-flavored beers might.","jporf911","Jul 19, 2010"

Has a flavor that's grainy-adjuncty with a sharp hoppiness and puckering dryness. Mouthfeel is unimpressive and thin. Very easy to drink, however it has a disturbingly ultra-dry finish: a chalky, dusty feeling was left in my throat after I finished it. When they said this beer is dry they were not messing around.
