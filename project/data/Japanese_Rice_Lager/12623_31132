2.5,14.7,2.5,2.5,2.5,1.5,3,"Apart from that, it's what you expect from an Asian beer. Minimal potency, light and subdued flavour, smooth drinkability without any party-animal excitement. A bland, stoic beer for the masses.","laituegonflable","Sep 22, 2007"
2.27,4.1,2.5,3,2,2,2,"I am sorry but the review stops here, there is nothing to write about. This is a nothing beer, no taste, no aroma, no flavour. There isn't even anything nasty to say about it, it is just an all round unbeer!","BlackHaddock","Apr 17, 2007"
2.56,17.4,3,2,2.5,3,3,"330 ml bottle.Clean golden colour, pours a more than decent head that fades almost instantly. As for the smell, I only can find grain, bread. Taste of grain, metallic notes and some sweet flavor. I really expected less of this one, nothing special but it has a clean palate and it's very refreshing.","janubio","Jul 15, 2006"
2.2,0.9,2.5,2.5,2,1.5,2.5,"In short it is a refreshing beer, although characterless and empty. You can drink dozens of this one, as there is almost nothing there.","AlexLMS","Jun 16, 2006"

2.35,7.8,2,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Taste was very bland, no bitterness and very few malt. So what do I taste? A faint bitter with some vegetable taste, that's it. The big nothing.","Absumaster","0"
