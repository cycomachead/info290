"Overall, I suppose this is a good beer to nail before the back nine on a summer day. I'll stick to something with a little more flavor, but it's a rice lager I guess and it was refreshing at the very least."

"Definitely drinkable on a hot day. But on a chilly night like tonight, it's little more than an appetiser. Hopefully the Tokyo Black I'll follow this up with has a bit more guts to it."
"Great summer beer. I'll be getting a lot more of these in next few months. Those who've already reviewed this beer, maybe give it another shot, it's really quite good...and I don't even particularly like lagers :D"
"Drinkability: Not quite world-class or anything, but it's a good, refreshing and nicely hoppy lager. It's cheap for what it is, too. Recommended."
"Almost no head on a boring pale golden color. The smell is of sweet fruity tea and caramel. The taste is quite fresh, sweet citrus, ginger. Maybe sweet hints of caramel. A chewy grassy hoppiness in the back of the mouth. Kind of watery. Probably a good session brew."
"Easy drinking."
"Beautiful pale gold. Restrained bitterness. Malty broad creamy flavor. Tastes like creamed corn. Could not get the taste out of my mouth for a day and a half. I went to sleep an hour after drinking this beer because the creamed corn flavor was making me feel bad and I woke up an hour later barfing my intestines out. I felt like this beer was trying to turn me inside out."
