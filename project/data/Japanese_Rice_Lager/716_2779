The taste brings in more of the same, the egg thankfully a momentary bit of madness that never recurs.  Still, not much goodness to be found here.  The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel.  Overall, this stuff just isn't for me.

Pouring produced 1/2"" of bubbly, extremely short-lived white head which left no spotting or lacing down the glass. Its aroma was quite mild, sweet light malts with hops in the background.The flavour began with a sweet light maltiness, with a delayed impact moderate bitterness after swallowing the beer and a dry finish. All very subdued. The carbonation was quite active though, but stopped short of prickly, and I would describe the beer as light bodied with a watery mouthfeel. In summary, I can't figure out why this beer is so big in Japan. It's certainly not offensive in any way, but there's really nothing here to bring me back for another. At $2.60 per 500 ml can, ASD is not inexpensive.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

2.59,-4.1,2.75,2.5,2.75,2.25,2.5,"Had a tall can at a pub in Calgary's Kensington area, on a whim. Pours a watery pale/just this side of light yellow shade with ample carbonation. Very aggressively carbonated adjunct lager, so much so that the bubbles burnt my lips a little. Initially aroma notes were perfumy and bright, but this quickly moved to a wet grain and corn sugar character that one might expect in such a beer. In all honestly though, this beer smells like little except fizzy water. The taste is a bit more robust than the smell and includes the expected wet grainy malt, DMS cooked vegetable, and a residual sweetness (despite the ""super dry"" moniker), along with a tart yogurt acidity and a little peppery spice. Metallic notes and a rubbing alcohol astringency emerge in the finish along with hints of grass. I'd say the finish is indeed pretty clean and crisp as the bubbles scrub the palate of the sweet/cooked flavors. If one is going to judge this beer for what it is, its probably a potent thirst quencher on a hot day and in the right frame of mind could prove to be rather refreshing. Don't look here if you seek complex fresh malt flavors, hops, or anything else associated with craft workmanship.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 05, 2013"

Occasion: looking forward to rest after a fun trip to LBI--and a new mattress upstairs....Appearance: clear golden body with slim bubbles; head flourishes and quickly dissipates, leaves spongelike, wide gaps between foamy nooks and crannies... Aroma: funky corn adjuncts plague the nostrils; slight suggestion of floral hops, but they are beaten back by macro malt... Palate: clean, slightly irregular finish with some warmth at its end; rather watery with little character...Taste: light bitterness from the malt adjunct makes this a rather bland mouth rinser; exhibits little of its promised ""richness""... Overall: at $1.99 for a 38-ounce can, one could argue this beer actually gives the drinker his money's worth... unfortunately, this beer didn't have to come from Japan to deliver its pedestrian malty, bitterly bland aftertaste...at least there was a lot of it?...","dacrza1","Jul 24, 2013"

At any rate, the beer pours a straw yellow color, a shade darker than other Japanese lagers, with a puffy white head. The head dissipates rather quickly, leaving some lacing. The shade of yellow is a bit strange, but perhaps that's just my opinion on the flavor/aroma of the beer coloring (pun) my feelings on the appearance. The odor is light but still off-putting. It's on the weak end of the spectrum of macro lager aromas but definitely not the bottom of the barrel. The flavor is a mix of bitter, grassy hops, cheap super pale malt plus adjuncts (rice, I guess) and a mildly stomach-turning sourness. The mouthfeel is light with some graininess. Drinkability isn't horrible, either, but it's certainly nothing to write home about.

Not much smell, and I really couldn't tell the smell from any macro. As long as it was really cold, it was fairly palatable, but once it started to warm, the flavor became more metallic.

For what this product is, I really enjoy it. It poured a crystal clear golden straw colour with a 15mm snow white head that lasted for approximately 90 seconds. I was actually impressed with how long it hung around, quite honestly. Even when it faded, it did not go away completely. It simply subsided to about a 5mm blanket across the top. Thick sticky lacing clings to the sides of the glass. Has almost a green apple smell to it. You can certainly smell the rice and the rice-alcohol in this. Doesn't smell terrible by any stretch. Taste is slightly yeasty with some definite rice sugar sweetness present. I typically do not go for the Japanese rice lager style, but if I had to pick one, it would certainly be this over Kirin.

There are a few drops of lace on the glass. The smell is so mild as to be nearly non-existent, with just a hint of sweetness. The mouth is well carbonated and a bit heavy sour. The taste is mild, and, yes, dry. There may be a hint of the rice, but no sign of the corn. Rather, the opening is grainy and a touch lemon sour, while the finish is less hoppy bitter than wet paper moldy. The aftertaste leaves the impression of wet socks. I actually didn't think the first few sips were that bad, but this beer has grown on me in the negative sense. Not sure I'll finish it... The Czechs should be ashamed!","Globetrotter","Feb 05, 2004"

This beer's to be ""superdry"". I don't know about all of that but it tastes EXCELLENT very very very cold, in a very very very cold mug--which Japanese bars and restaurants seem to understand. I think the talk of this beer matched with sushi or whatnot is a bit of baloney: it's a macrobrewed pilsener, the Bud of Japan--but NOT the BUTT of Japan. I enjoy drinking this beer--which is important. Just as there are moments when a Budweiser tastes excellent, there are those same moments for this beer. Give it a try extra cold: my personal recommendation.","donnebaby","Dec 18, 2003"

A fair middle-of-the-road beer, it's usually my first choice when out for sushi, and I suppose the meal either enhances it or masks its flaws. Pours out with a big white cloudy head that lasts a while, and leaves a bit of lace in it's wake down the glass. Colour is a straw gold, with lots and lots of bubbles. The nose is a bit metallic, and the taste is very dry, the flavour nearly comes and goes before you can pick up on it. Very faint taste of grains and light hops. Mouthfeel is akin to almost any higher end marco lager. An okay match for sushi or hot weather barbecuing, but it needs to be partnered up to enjoy.","IronDjinn","May 21, 2003"

The aroma is of a sweet, grainy malt with minimal background hops. The body is light with a fine, median carbonation that's crisp in the mouth, but also smooth. The flavor starts sweet but soon reveals interwoven notes of hop flavor, and a balancing bitterness. As you progress through the glass the bitterness builds on the palate.

Asahi Super Dry poured a light golden straw with a nice head that cleared to a wispy ring soon after. Taste is hops bitter up front with the malt not far behind then comes the dry and pleasantly bitter after taste that will linger on for a bit.

Lots of husky malt with metallic undertones from an astringent flavour, hops were quick and snappish with a sharp bitterness that went hand and hand with the husk flavour.
