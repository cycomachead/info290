"Overall: I am generally not a fan of lagers, but this one is my favorite so far (primarily because I can actually taste it). It has more malt flavor, bitterness, and body than something like Stella or Bud Light. It's still too bland for me to drink on its own, but goes well with sushi. The right tool for the right job!"

"I drank this beer before and during dinner at a sushi restaurant. It was a nice compliment to sushi. I tried this beer out of a 22oz can. It's pour resulted in a low, short-lived head and had low carbonation overall. The aroma was light, crisp, and slightly skunky. It consisted of a light, clean, and crisp taste, but was distinctly light and clean - better than an average American pale lager. I enjoyed the difference in the quality of this beer in comparison to other pale lagers. Despite my enjoyment, it wasn't anything extraordinary. It was a nice, new experience, but an average beer, nonetheless."

"Japan's Budweiser? Pours a light gold color with a slight fizzy head. Smell is of a slightly sweet, carbonated starchiness -- mostly what you would expect from a basic lager. Obviously pairs well with a nice japanese bento box. Very easy to drink thanks to the right amount of carbonation and an overall freshness. Finishes dry. Solid beer."

"I used to have an old alcoholic roomate who loved this stuff. He had me try it once, and by god, it was fantastic. It could have been the atmosphere, since we took our girlfriends out to a sushi bar, and the beer looked and tasted so great, it could have been a culmination of the whole pleasantness of the entire situation. Great beer tho regaurdless, after trying it several more times in several different types. Never thought Japan would make a great beer, especially one made from rice."

"This was surprisingly available at a high end oriental grill in New Delhi - expensive but I had to try it with the food. Poured from a can into a pilsener glass. Fell a light bronze colour with plenty of effervescence and life. The head was gone before I could blink. Smell was all grain, a little pils malt and a faint herbaceous. The sip was stingy on the tongue - that was the near metallic carbonation at work. Tasted of wet grain, a faint shadow of malt sweetness and a near leafy bitterness. Very shortlived on the palate - frankly I would prefer Asahi Super Dry any day. The only noticeable aspect is the carbonation and the fact that it washes down the oriental spices rather well. Dont expect anything more from this one."
"The best part about this beer was that it came in a 4oz can size. I wouldn't wish this one on any other BA. FOr the love of God, pass on this."
"It's straw yellow, not bitter, light head that fades quickly. Decent"
"O: Not an amazing beer, but it's easy to drink, especially with a typical Japanese meals."
"The look is very light and fizzy. Not much aroma to speak of. Overall, an ok tasting beer, which can be refreshing but not a real standout in my mind."
"There is good thirst quenching quality here, very refreshing, high drinkable and good to have more than one in row."
"Cool tall silver can poured this beer-san into my glass, with not much to offer to the eyes save for a different color than the glass. Smelled like most mass-produced lagers, not surprising since the rice thing is a similarity. Flavor was decent, but nothing different from the decent mega-schlubs of yore. Might be a bit more carbonation here than what I'm used to getting in an Bud, but that's about it. What I did like about this is that it's very drinkable, and would go well with that wasabi you had with your sea urchin...now I know it's making everyone hungry."
"Grassy honey nose, some spice notes. Yellow gold,quickly dissipating medium head. Slight biscuity sweetness, good bitterness. Very fizzy, light to slight medium body, pretty crisp finish. This is a fairly basic, but solid easy drinking beer. Maybe it is all those sushi nights and sake-bombs that make me think so fondly of this beer, but it just seems to have an extra quality over many other similar such Pale Lagers."
"D: Good drinker, only if it is served fresh on-tap. Seems to go best with Japanese food. Will do in a pinch by itself."
"Not something I will have again, most likely."
"Poured lightly for a 1-finger head, reduces to thin bubbly head, runny and blotchy, color is faded straw gold. Aroma of college and skunk. Taste is same. Smoother drinkability than other low class beers."
"12 oz bottle in Japanese restaurant. Pours a pale straw with a quickly fading white head. Aroma is of grass, some hops and sweet malt. Flavor is light hops with some biscuit malt. Finish is not existent. Body is watery. At least it was not disgusting"
"In my opinion, this is one of he most overrated beers in the world. It has such a strong bitter taste and tastes so dry! It is very watered down, has a poor color, way too much carbonation,and leaves a horrible aftertaste. This beer is the Jap equivalent of Budweiser."
"[Bottled or in cans, meh, not so good. But BA doesn't seem to make that distinction very well.]"
"D - Extremely drinkable, but not worth drinking if something else available."
"Drinkability- 4 out of 5. As with most beers on the light end of the spectrum, Sapporo's drinkability is its highlight. It is a bit more balanced and more drinkable than things like Miller High Life or Pabst Blue Ribbon, but it is also a little more expensive considering the fact that it has been imported. If you're an rabid anime fan or Japanophile, this is an ideal beer to prove how obsessed you are; othewise, I suggest opting for a domestic equivalent. On the other hand, taking its Japanese origins into account, Sapporo is light and subtle enough to compliment fairly delicate foods like sushi without overpowering the flavors as stronger, more blatantly-flavored beers might."
"Taste, not much. You could workout and drink this stuff. Carbonated. Good with good food, because it won't interfere with just about any flavor profile. Very polite and non offensive beer here. Just missing the camera. Prolly good with spicy stuff or when you just feel like a water but it isn't available. This used to be cheaper, price has crept up lately."
"Overall, a decent beer but pretty indistinguishable from any other Japanese beer."
"Poured from a 2 liter can! Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, slight grains. Taste is crisp, not very flavorful, mild notes of grains. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a mediocre beer."
"Drinkable just not complex. Fine with sushi as it doesn't get in the way of the delicate flavors. But obviously, not one to grab when you are on the mood for a bold craft beer."
"Pours a straw yellow color with a one and a half finger head to it. The smell is of a rice grain backbone, however, there is a little sweet smell as well. The taste is of rice grain and a slight sweet malt as well as a slight citrus hop. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall it is a drinkable beer, it is slightly more flavorful and complex than the regular version, but still not enough to make you crave it."
"But its very drinkable. Had like 4 in a row. I just had to ignore the smell and the taste. The sushi was delicious though."
"D-Drinkable, it is a session beer. One that is easy to drink but doesn't pack a lot of complex flavors. This way the taste doesn't get to overwhelming after a few"
"The lack of hop is disappointing but expected. Thin bodied, highly carbonated. Yep, get out the lawn mower, work up a sweat and down this in seconds, then you might find it satisfying."
"Drinkability: A refreshing, crisp lager that's fine for Asian restaurant drinking, particularly if sake bombs are called for."
"As Japanese beers go, this one deserves, if not a significantly better review, at least a more favorable one. Compared with the readily available varieties of Japanese rice lager here in the US, this one stands out as having at least some quality in taste and body. Golden, slightly grayish color in the glass, with a nice head of foam that fell quickly. A bit watery (as expected) and bubbly, it was nonetheless refreshing and drinkable. The taste was malty, with a rice smoothness and a hint of hops that adds a very subtle spicy edge to the aftertaste."
"This beer reminds me of Sapporo Premium. In fact, I can't come up with any discernable differences. It is a pale straw color with a weak beige head. The nose and taste are both ricey and a bit skunky. A light boddy has more than ample carbonation and does not go down well."
"Not much one can say about this beer except its malty sweet and goes down easy with sushi. Has a nice good white head a gold color, has a relatively boring taste which makes a good palliate cleaner for sushi. Has a grass smell with lite floral taste. Not bad beer by any stretch and easily drinkable"
"Can't say much about it but it would be good to have on a hot day. Its light in colour and taste. Reminded me of miller lite. Probably would not have it again."
"Drinkability: Not a great brew by any means, but easy to drink in a mindless, refreshing way. Near the top of my list among the mass-produced Japanese non-premium lagers."
"Even with a sake shot glass dropped into it, just not a fun beer. Avoid."
"I rated this one in the mindset of thinking that Budweiser and Michelob are made of rice. Shouldn't they be considered Rice Lagers? I would have to say that if I measure this beer up to Budweiser there is no contest. Sapporo brings home the trophy. At least I understand why they use rice. Does japan have any other grains. All in all it's not a bad lager. Even matching it up against Heineken I would say Sapporo wins."
"Drinkability : bière correcte, dans le style des pilsener Allemandes"
"Im partial to ales, so consequently I was surprised that this was better than anticipated. Smooth and drinkable and not over-carbonated like American pale lagers. Nothing spectacular, but not heinous like American macro-brews. Aroma was almost undetectable, and lacing was minimal."
"Nice can. Pours with a yellowish wheat color and a tall foamy head with not much lacing. Smells like generic beer, but doesn't have any skunk which is good. Taste was light, bubbly, with slight wheats. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth actually, and I was expecting skunk at each level but did not detect it. A good beer to just down when you've had too much wasabi."
"Pours an extremely pale yellow, with a light amount of foam on top. Plenty of carbonation keeps the foam intact. The head did not disipate, even after the beer was gone. Smell is a bit like raw grain husks, with some floral aromas as well. Taste is rather simple. A bit of a dry bread and cracker taste, some floral notes afterwards, and even a small amount of vanilla. Mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated. Gave my throat a prickly sensation, and left me with a bit of gas. However, it's quite refreshing. A decent session beer. For what it is, a simple thirst quenching lager, it's quite good."
"worth a shot"
"Pours a very light straw color with chunky white head that sticks around for a while, but eventually fades away to form a thin chunky layer that laces the glass. Really doesn't have any smell to it at all. The flavor was slightly tinny from the can, even though I poured it into a pilsner glass to review it. Other than that, it's very clean and creamy, no real aftertaste. It's a very nice lawnmower beer, and possibly very good with sushi (I'll have to try that soon). An all-around very drinkable beer."
"Not every going to be a regular, but I do have some of the old bumpy 22 oz bottles from some time ago that i like to use for home brew..."
"Enjoyed this beer. Recommended!"
"Cheers!"
"Poured a light gold, bright and inviting leaving a thin white lace. The aroma is sweet, fresh, hard to breakdown sort of plain some yeasty essence throughout. The taste starts crisp, dry, and actually nice. It has a small hop bitterness upfront, followed by a malty sweetness that dominates the finish with a lemon tart bite. Overall this is a pretty decent brew which I accompanied with some sushi the perfect pair."
"Taste was malty and dry, absolutely not bitter. The thin body and high drinkability make this a straight forward pilsener, perfect to accompany an Asian dish. Yet it is not uo there with the top 10 pilseners."
"The mouthfeel is very crisp and light. Quite cleansing. Quite pleasant. Overall, though not a style I enjoy [though seem to have frequently enough], this beer is what it is supposed to be. Quite drinkable in the right environment [e.g. Japanese restaurant]."
"Sapporo Draft Beer pours a hazy (chill haze most likely as it is a filtered beer) light orange with a white head that dissipated quickly from a brown sixteen ounce bottle. No freshness date on the bottle, and I'm a little suspicious about it's age. A little bit of malt and maybe a little alcohol in the aroma. Taste is on the malty side and a bit of skunk in the finish, this beer is actually better than I remembered it. That being said, it's nothing special, maybe a change from the norm, but not worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: Very good with a hearty meal in front of you."
"As Japanese beers go, it's one of the better ones I've tried; however, it's only marginally more enjoyable than a standard macro-lager."
"A rather well made Japanese rice lager."
"looks standard rice lager golden, decent head sticks around for a few minutes, even leaves a little lacing. the smell is what separates this from asahi and kirin, you can actually smell it from a little distance, and it's not bad. typical macro lager scents, malty, but more complex than the others. i swear i detect some toastiness and even a hint of pear! tastes pretty watery and plain up front, but with a pleasant little bitter finish making this quite drinkable. I'll take yebisu over this for a session beer, but this might be better with food."
"A beer that remember me CRUZ BLANCA, a beer made from rice, differenciated only by the marketing purpose words ""draft beer""; appearance on the average; cereal flavor; hops smell; good with asian and mexican food; 75% recommended; try too with cheese and snack."
"Overall, this is my new favorite drinking beer for Japan, although I usually only see it in cans, not bars."
"I have many nostalgic memories associated with this beer. It evokes many trips to the Oregon coast near Tillamook where my wife and I would stop at the Blue Heron and pick up some cheese, crackers, fruit and Sapporo Draft  and then go sit by the ocean for a picnic. The appearance is translucent, pale and golden. Foam and lacing are excellent. Aroma is a grassy/floral hop nose with some grain. Nicely carbonated initial taste contains a medium body filled with lovely malt flavor offset by citrus. Aftertaste is nicely dry with a hint of fresh baked bread and flowers."
"Pours a light, pilsner-like gold color. Head is good, carbonation is very visible.Smell is negligible. Taste is average, a very light bodied beer, with minimal hop flavoring. Sweet taste is prevalent, and carbonation is evident, but nothing really interesting going on here. Just as drinkable as any other adjunct beer. I would skip this one if I was offered it again."
"Meantime stick to Sapporo Black Beer (smells like a box of chocolates) or if you favor a Dortmunder try Sapporo's Yebisu. If smaller new generation Japanese brewers get swallowed up - as is the trend in US this brewer could provide some beer that we all will advocate"
"Starts a bit mild but then a goodly amount of DMS and musty hops grabs your tongue and holds on. Some sweetness and slight sourness. Theres enough carbonation that you can almost taste it. That musty bitterness lingers on the tongue long after youre done. The DMS and mustiness is just too much for me to detect anything else there."
"Overall a delicious, drinkable beer. Very good compliment to a koroke teishoku lunch."
"Can: Poured a clear golden colored beer with a pretty decent head with standard retention. Aroma is very weak, almost watery I should say. Taste is also quite watery and boring. I guess it would go well with the kind of spicy food where you loose all your taste buds. Taste is even worse when I notice that this is brewed by Sleeman at their Guelph facility."
"Not a bad offering for an import lager. Pours a light golden yellow with a little white head that retains farely well. Lacing isn't to bad either. The smell is very grainy with hints of corn, slight skunk aroma as well. The taste is earthy, heavy grain and corn with a slight citrus. Some french bread aftertaste, slight syrupy malts brings a little bit of flavor to this. Feels crisp and medium in the mouth. Not bad, average."
"Light and pleasant to the taste, if undistinguished. Crisp and leaves the palate quickly. this is a decent brew, with or without sake, particularly for the hot summer months. Light enough to refresh without stupefying."
"Pours with a big white head. The color was a clean bright yellow. For the most part the only aroma I could pinpoint was a sweet grassy smell. A very watery flavor. No real sweetness as indicated in the aroma just a light crisp bitterness on the finish. It is quite possible that if served ice cold on a good hot day this beer could be refreshing."
"comes in a bad ass can. pours out a pale golden, clear with a big white head, somewhat rocky and it eventually dies down to a foamy white ring. light lacing. the nose smells of sweet grainy malt, very clean. the flavor is in the same arena, light sweetness comming from the malt with a small hop bitterness evening things out. clean and simple, crisp in the mouth and refreshing. a nice palate cleanser (spicy food, pizza, thai food etc.) or a good ice cold quencher. i expected less, not bad at all."
"I had this at the local Japanese restaraunt. Poured a golden straw color with a white head. Aroma is very clean. Can't really pick out much grain or much of anything for that matter. Taste is what the smell alluded to. Very crisp, faint notes of hops are present but that's about it. This fits in well with the BMC crowd. Nothing special overall but I was glad to try something new and my first asian beer as well."
"I would say that it's the Japanese equivilant to Budweiser or coors. It is a pale yell ow colour with no head, smell husky and corny. There was no trace of hops in either the taste or aroma. I was pissed that it was getting skunky in the short time it took me to drink it."
"Drinkability  Im not dumping this in the sink as I do with many examples of this sadly worn-out style."
"Japanese Bud... really. Went out to hibachi last night with friends (the food was great, but expensive). The beer was lackluster and even more expensive. When in Rome, do as the Roman's so I ordered a Sapporo. Cool looking can, a bomber or more I believe. Of course I poured into a Pilsner glass but nothing special here at all. It really did taste exactly like Bud, maybe even a little lighter with no malt backbone at all. The mouthfeel did cut through some of the vegetable and shrimp aroma's from the meal and it was nice to have something light for this meal, but not worth the money. I would never buy this for home use. If you do go to Hibachi, save your cash and get a Bud draft."
"It is drinkable and probably is pretty optimum for Sushi, but I like mixing a little soy sauce and wasabi in a small amount of a good Doppelbock and dipping my sushi in that. Of course I might be a bit weird!"
"Nothing amazing about Sapporo Draft. Better than a normal American macro, and it would certainly go nicely with spicy Asian food. Not much to say beyond that."
"Thick bubbly head that dispates quickly. This a pale golden color and smells of grains and a slight floral hint. The taste is grainy with a crisp taste that bites your tongue. This pricks the palate. Not a bad blend of ingrediants. Would go well with spicy asian foods. Still not something I could sit back and enjoy regularly."
"Cold Filtered Draft = low aroma & flavor. It pours a clear gold with a fizzy white head. The aroma is much like a distant slice of Wonder Bread. The light/medium body is slightly grainy and a little sweet, but otherwise non-descript. This brew is lacking in the hop department. A seltzery fizzy mouthfeel is used in place of any hop flavors. Bottled not draft! But, despite all its drawbacks, it is fairly drinkable."
"Clear as day with a yellow tint. It almost looks like champagne. The taste is extremely crisp and dry. It complemented the meal very well. I could have gone for another one of these when I was done, and I'll certainly take it over Bud any day."
"Nothing too special. I would drink it again but I wouldn't care to buy it again. My guess is it complements Japanese food and, if anything else, it would be an effective method of washing down wasabi."
"Standard macro yellow w/ white head. However, this is definitely a cut above the rest. I actually could taste some malt and hops. Nothing to write home about, but certainly better than Buttwiper"
"Pours a normal and boring yellow color. The aroma is the same: boring and not very strong - showing that it is a mass-produced beverage. Everything is very much like Bud Light, including the taste. Nothing special here, but a fairly drinkable beer. Think expensive Bud Light."
"This beer poured a very quick dissolving head and there was no lacing whatsoever.It had a moderate bitter taste.The body had a lot of carbonation and the hue was gold.A very prolonging aftertaste was observed with this beer.This beer reminded me of Budweiser.Yuck."
"This brew poured from a can yielded a small white head of fine to medium sized bubbles with little lacing. It had a transparent light yellow orange body and a typical American beer like aroma with a mild malt and a mild hoppy smell. Carbonation continuously rose from the bottom of the glass. It had a fizzy taste of hops and went down fairly smoothly, but I could feel the gas building in my stomach after only a few sips. It was very much like a typical big American brewery beer like bud or miller. Well, I guess we taught the Japs everything we know!"
"12 oz bottle. Poured a very light yellow, not much head or lacing. Aroma is muted, but there is a slight hint of malt. The taste is light, slightly sweet, with no hop presence. Still it is quite drinkable, just as I remember it when I was in Japan in the mid 80's. Nothing like those street corner beer vending machines!"
"Thx"
"Drink when cold as this beer looses zip as it warms. Fairly easy to drink, but I would recommend 12 oz bottles so the beer doesn't warm. All-in-all not a bad beer with the appropriate food, but not one to really enjoy on its own."
"Not a bad Japanese beer. I liked it better than the Yebisu I had just before this one. Clear golden very little head but tasted fresh like n American lager. Highly carbonated and not a beer I'd drink often. Fine with dinner though, and a good aid to spicy japanese food."
"Pours a nice head, but it is gone very fast. Looks a pale golden yellow. Smells pretty wheaty, surprisingly. Tastes a little wheaty, too. Crisp and clean, a good light beer. Smooth, but spicy enough to keep it interesting and make it drinkable. Better than most beers ""in its class""."
"An average ""cheap euro-lager"" tasting beer. Nice if it is all you can get--usually at Asian/Japanese resaurants. It will get the job done if the alternative is Budweiser. Just order a glass of water to go with it. Smells like cheap grain and slightly skunked noble hops. Pours to a frothy, sudsy head that dissapears rapidly. Has a flavor that's grainy-adjuncty with a sharp hoppiness and puckering dryness. Mouthfeel is unimpressive and thin. Very easy to drink, however it has a disturbingly ultra-dry finish: a chalky, dusty feeling was left in my throat after I finished it. When they said this beer is dry they were not messing around. Not a good sign when a beer leaves you parched and wanting a glass of water."
"Color is a pale clear yellow with a white head of foam that faded fast, leaving some smallish bubbly lacing. Smells faintly of sweetish malt and grain of bread or cornbread with barely a hop in the back. Taste is crisp and grainy with a slight sweet cornbread taste thats smooth and easy. There's a little hop in the back, but hardly noticeable unless a big swig is taken from your glass. This is a OK drinker, nothing outstanding, a bit airy and watery, thinned out and could use some body and flavor."
"Clear yellow with a voluminous white head. This created a fair amount of lacing down the glass. The taste was rather weak and watery with a sense of breadiness and grain. Not a bad beer; rather innocuous overall. This lager seems more like a macro American beer than anything else."
"Golden in color with the matching white foam that I will call a head. Definitely fizzy white. It is a basic macro, although I find that this beer does pair well with the japanese food. When poured you can almost smell the corn and rice, mostly rice come at you. All rice minimal malt, almost unnoticable hop aroma. A simple, very low in flavor carbonated beverage, but it is refreshing just nothing here to say it's a good beer. Light bodied, meant for the masses of the population in mass quantity. It was so run of the mill. I should have done a sake bomb with it."
"Pours a clear golden color - the nose is mostly bitter hops. The head rises and falls quickly. The taste is sweet malt and bitters hops slightly out of balance. Pretty decent and drinkable. I don't usually just drink this beer by itself like tonight. I find it is my best friend at the Sushi bar though. Good friends, Sapporo, Sushi, sashimi and hand rolls with a lot of Wasabi are the perfect combination. Very drinkable - even by itself. Good clean finish."
"typical american style lager, basically, nothing special. golden in color with thin white head that vanished almost immediately. almost unnoticable malt nose and sweet taste. slightly floral bitter hop bite. somewhat dry finish, but it left my palete still salivating because it was so sweet in the finish. light in body. drinkable when you have just gone beer shopping but nothing is cold, and your roomate left on in the fridge."
"The beer pours the prototypical lager golden yellow color with a modest bright white head that is semi-creamy in texture and the leftover lace a thin but concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is all malt, crisp and clean, start is malt with the top skeletal and the finish pertinently acidic, hops adequate, and the aftertaste dry and long lasting. O.K. when youre into something light, but not anything to write home about."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a thin white head. Nose is fresh malts and grains with notes of wet wood. A bit of a musky quality comes through in the taste with a dry finish. Not a beer Id recommend."
"Lemon-colored pour with active carbonation that contributes to a substantial head of foam. Smell is light in both flavor and strength with some floral scents and a hint of crispness. An interesting flavor with the light, crisp floral scents showing up at the front of the drink. Those flavors fade gradually in favor of a dryer, almost yeasty taste. Mouthfeel is not as clean as expected from a clear, crisp beer like this, but it's fine, as is the drinkability. Despite an interesting flavor profile, this is a simple beer that neither amazes nor offends."
"Result: it's akin to a middle-of-the-road everyday lager....."
"ps do not get the bottle."
"Pours a bright, light-golden color with a nice white head and some lace. Head does not last long and settles into a thin sheet. Skunky aroma with some malt and floral hop. Light body and slightly watery mouthfeel. Very weak and not much taste, some malt is percieved. Finishes with a dryness and some hop bitterness. Another fizzy yellow lager, we have enough of these so there is no need to import more."
"I enjoyed this Japanese offering. Here is a brew that is appealing to the eye as well as the taste buds. A light golden honey colour with a 2 finger head when first poured, that disapates to a gentle lace and ring. A slight hoppy taste is evident but pleasing."
"There is NO similarity between this fluid and draught beer! It has a dark gold color, good white frothy head that slowly dissipates, a flowery (pilsen hops) nose and then the let down.. Nice grassy start then a heavy bread-like heavy taste and a sweet finish. Some sort of lingering after taste (sorry I dont have my beer thesaurus handy) but the finish was so much unfamiliar from the draughts I am used to I have to assume the thing is a marketing scam. This beer can only appeal to Mr.  Roboto who buys on image .not beer taste.certainly not draught beer."
"Not bad. Serve cold."
"Pours a pleasant medium gold with lots of carbonation and a decent snow-white head, good lace.  Aroma of malt and some mild hops.  Taste begins with sweet malt and a sting of carbonation, towards the end of the taste the malt fades and bitter lemon hops come into play.  Finish is a touch dry.  A pleasant, drinkable beer."
"The Original Draft Beer that Sapporo makes is much better; try that one instead."
"This clear light golden brew is topped off with a medium sized fizzy white head.  Carbonation is evident.  Smells skunky and moldy.  Taste is not much better although I do detect a drying effect on the buds that isn't bad.  There is hardly any perceivable malt backbone in this thing.  Very light body.  A little too carbonated which makes it less drinkable.  If there was no other choice on a 100 degree day, I'd drink this.  Otherwise I wouldn't."
"Well to start with, the soapy head looked like the foam in the toilet after you finish going. It was the most unappetizing thing I have ever seen. Stinky aroma, with no real flavor to speak of. Kind of tastes like soapy water. I have heard this is better in the can, but I am now reluctant to try that."
"Pours a very clear straw color with a small head that fades into just a thin layer.  The smell is faint but reveals a lemony twang and not much else.  Very watery mouthfeel and bland taste.  I would say this must be Japan's own Coors Light ;-).  It is crisp, but it's nearly like drinking carbonated water with a little alcohol.  I can usually pick out flavors, but I'm struggling with this one.  There is absolutely nothing there except the mouthfeel and a little carb bite.  Sorry, I couldn't do any better with this beer.  Definitely non-offensive, but bland as hell!  Very poor in my book.  Kampai!"
"I couldn't pick this out in a blind taste test with Kirin Ichiban. Are there any really good Japanese beers out there? This is like the geenric lagers from every other country. Yellow, fizzy, and weak."
"Medium gold in color with thin white head that dissipates rapidly. Has a light ""beer"" aroma of a not really discernable malt & hop combination. Moderate carbonation level coupled with a light body gives a zesty mouthfeel. Some hop bitterness in the flavor backed by a mellow malt character. Brief, dry, slightly hop-tinged finish. Clean and interestingly dry, but rather standard."
"Sapporo Original Draft pours a light golden with a fleeting head. Taste of hops and slight malt come and go. Refreshing but somewhat thin for a pilsner, the can is far more interesting and distinctive."
"All in all, not terrible.  This is a good beer to have while you are out eating sushi or other Japanese food as it really cleanses the pallate.  Not my favorite by any means."
"Darker straw / yellow color, w/ a head that settles quickly.  The unenticing and bland aroma is comprised of light dimethyl sulfide, sweet grainy notes, and a hint of sulfur in the finish. Any hop nose is masked by the grainy malt aroma.  Clean, dry and bland all around in flavor as expected from the lack of residual dextrins and protein. The dearth of malt complexity and hop bitterness and flavor renders Sapporo a beer to serve a purpose-- where's my sushi and wasabi?  It's certainly meant to accompany flavorful food."
"Since my wife barred me from sake after an unfortunate meltdown a few years back, Sapporo has to do when we're out for sushi.  It's got to the typical Japanese lager appearance and smell but a slightly less grainy taste than the Canadian-brewed Kirin."
"Slight graininess and hops, very clean finish.  Very light in color.  Basic lager, however I have to confess I found myself liking this while eating spicy foods. Clean, crisp, rather refreshing.  I think it's a lot tastier than the American made macros. Nothing I'd go out of my way for, but seems like it'd be refreshing on a hot summer day."
"I guess i wasn't really expecting much with this one,no real taste to speak of, quite watery, sure was a nice can though."
"Not a big fan a beer in a can and I can see why with Sapporo. The beer poured well and had a nice head,but the taste was average and really no aroma. Budweiser in fancier can!!!"
"Notes: Japan's #1 imported beer and a very refreshing lager. Equal to, if not better than, many US equivalents."
