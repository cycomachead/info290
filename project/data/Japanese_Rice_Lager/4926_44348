2.18,0,,,,,,"Pours an almost white with a hint of yellow with a very thin white head. No detectable aroma-neither hops or malt. Hops are barely there and the rice lends to a very very light body. No finish to speak of and mouthfeel is very thin. Drinkability is low because there isn't much to recommend this beer.","bradybeer","Beers"
3.18,0,,,,,,"Pours palest gold with a watery white head. Little lacing/retention. Light ricey aroma with fruity accents. Flavor is actually pretty nice. Lots of ripe stone fruits provide a pleasant sweetness. The finish however is rice-dominated, like drinking rice paper. I guess that comes with the territory though. Crisp and very clean due to the lightness. Thin body and nice carbonation. Refreshing and drinkable.","illidurit","0"
