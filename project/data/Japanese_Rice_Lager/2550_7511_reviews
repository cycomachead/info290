"Not very flavorful, but still pretty drinkable."
""
"Poured from a brown 21.4 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, malty. Taste is light, malts, a bit of sweetness, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good example of this style."

"833 ml bottle in NOLA.  Pours golden with white head.  Aroma is of grassy  hops and bready malt.  Body is light and slightly crisp.  Some sweet malt and hint of hops on the palate.  Finish is non-existent.  Good water replacement."

"O: Basic and easy to drink and enjoyable with food."
"Decent crisp lager. Overall pretty uninspiring, but plenty drinkable."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light yellow amber with a thin white cap that has decent retention with slight lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with light sweet apple juice and a hint of grassy hops. Flavor is light sweet malt with a minerally bitterness that eventually resolves as light grassy hops. An unusual light bland sweetness that may be the rice components. Light bodied. A pleasant light lager that is milder and slightly sweeter than a domestic adjunct lager. Bland and harmless, tasted pretty good on a hot summer day. My one hundredth style on BA."

"A little too sweet not as crisp as an Asian lager should be just okay"

"Poured a clear pale yellow with a one finger fluffy white head that quickly dissipated to a thin ring of lacing. It's not the best looking beer, but it's very true to the style. Scents of lager yeast, some moderate hop character, and grainy malt. Flavor begins with a moderate level of floral hop bitterness and some grainy malt in the background. This moves into more nice dry grainy malt flavors with a balance of floral hop bitterness. Finish is dry with a nice grainy dryness and floral hop bitterness. Aftertaste is dry with floral hop flavors. A nice flavor profile, quite dry, grainy and with a good level of hop bitterness. Quite pleasant to drink as a result. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a drying feel. Very refreshing, easy to drink and wonderful on a warm day. Overall this is a good Japanese Rice Lager that has a nice dry flavor character, a classic aroma profile for the style and a wonderfully refreshing mouthfeel. It's not the best beer around, but for it's style it is a fantastic drink."
"Pours a nice golden with a nice white head. Not much aroma. This is a typical Japanese beer that is light and easy to drink, especially with Japanese food like yakitori. You could drink a lot of this easily. Overall a decent beer when bar hopping. Not a lot of flavor or substance."
"This is a beer that I normally wouldn't rate very highly. It's a great example of a style that I think has a lot of problems. But you have to be ON Okinawa to understand. This beer was tailor made for Okinawan summer evenings. Any other place, any other time, and it become mediocre at best. But on a hot, humid, summer night overlooking the beach, or sitting in an izakaya, this beer's qualities shine through."
"O: Decent Japanese Rice Lager. Not my favorite style."

"Food match: Sushi is an all too obvious choice so how about pizza as well... or sushi pizza."

"O: I would definitely have it again with sushi."
""
""
"O - if a sushi restaurant has it, I am ordering it; great to cleanse the palate after some spicy tuna (I don't like the pickled ginger)"
""
""
""
""
"Works well as a foil to wasabi or chili peppers."
""
""
"Yeah, it's a rice lager. It's not a bad rice lager, but that's a pretty low bar. Still, I think I enjoyed this more than others like Sapporo, Kirin or Asahi. It was just clean throughout its length and dry and crisp on the finish. That's worth something."

"Orion Premium Draft Beer pours a pale yellow with a thick white head from a brown 21.4 ounce bottle. The aroma is somewhat grainy and sweet smelling. The flavor is a touch sweet, with a bit of grain and a touch of something resembling hops. This is a super light beer, very light in body and flavor. It's as light or lighter than any macro American light beer. That said, it's about as good as any beer I've had that fits that category. Btw, the cap says ""For your happy time."" That's probably the best thing about this beer."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and seems to be a lot more palatable compared to other beers in the style."
"O: Very easy to drink and quite enjoyable, this beer matches well with a lot of different pan-Asian cuisines. I have had this beer at many sushi restaurants and continue to enjoy/order it. Better than many others in the style."
""
"Overall: for the style, pretty good. It's boring and balanced, but basically flaw-free, and quite drinkable indeed."
"Feels very refreshing and clean. The tingle is a good medium. Feels like I could consume a lot of this."

"My pour did not lack for head! I had better than two fingers' worth of dense bone-white head with great retention. Color was a sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a clean lager-sweetness to its scent. I am beginning to understand why not all adjuncts are bad - just corn. Mouthfeel was tending toward full, kind of light and fluffy on the tongue with a pleasant lager sweetness in the mouth. Finish had a real dryness to it which was both unexpected and enjoyable. I may be jaded after so many AALs in support of The CANQuest (TM), but I found this to be quite enjoyable. Now, do not misconstrue what I am saying - this was nothing to write home about, nor would it be worth seeking out, but as a ""find"" and at its price point, it was fully worthwhile. I would like to revisit this in a CAN, if possible."

"O - As I said, just a very generic lager, very drinkable."
"O: In my limited experience, the best Japanese beer I've tasted. Recommended highly for the style, but otherwise not worth seeking out."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow with a 2 inch puffy stark white head that settles to a small cap. Random streaks and spots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains, rice, and some grass notes. Taste is of sweet grains, minor rice flavors, and some herbal grassy flavors on the finish. A pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good rice lager coming straight from Japan. I was expecting something mediocre but I actually enjoy this one for what it is. Much better than Saporro for sure."
"Served really cold at sushi place in New York City this is a very clear yellow gold with a very healthy bubbly, white head and very little of any lacing. The aroma is simple clean cereal grain, sweet bread perhaps. Subtle. The taste brings sweet rice and light wheat, a crisp cereal beverage that refreshes and goes down mighty easily. The flavor is steady and compliments the Sushi nicely. Itâ€™s light-plus bodied with a thinish but lively feel. Still it has a little chewiness for the style. Not bad at all for what it is designed to be."
"This beer is pale like a cheap apple juice. At least it has a nice white head. The aroma ever since I poured it is like some type of stanky lemon and wheat. It kinda yeasty. It's smells like a person who's not bathed in awhile and tried to cover it up with some lemons. I over-exaggerate of course, but the point remains the same. Smooth flavor light lemon mixed with some sort of light lager, because the only other flavors around are malt and mostly mineral water. Could be worse I suppose. The mouthfeel is okay, meaning it's as would be expected per the style. This beer has many faults, but as Kyle said ""We have had SO much worse""."
"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF Round 5. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of slightly dirty white foam. The nose comprises wheat, grass, flowers, light cardamom (sorta), and a minor bit o' pepper. The taste holds notes of wheat, light greens, light lime zest, black pepper, flowers, and some very light caramel. The body is a hefty-ish (in the loosest sense) light, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish that leans toward the crisper side of life. Overall, a decent brew, really not all that bad for a JPL. Normally these things hurt to drink: This one was just kinda bland and, you know, kinda there..."
"Pours pale straw color with virtually no head. Smells slightly sweet and light, with a bit of congee like aroma. The taste is pretty clean to start, definitely with some light, clean rice flavors, and a bit of husky bitterness at the end. Not nearly as bad as I feared it might be, in fact, fairly refreshing."
"Poured a 2 finger head, a very pale golden color. I didnt get too much smell out of it, it kind of reminded me of the beer i drank in college. the taste was crisp but not really much after that. The mouthfeel was a little spicy. I would probably drink it again just to hang out just to drink."
"This beer is really just one of those out there for tickers, I have on'y seen it at a few elect places though."
"D: Well, it's a beer, and it doesn't taste terrible, and it will be there for your happy time. I would probably steer clear of this one from here on out, but it was about what I expected."
"D: it was very light all around but drank really good and went good with some sashimi. Definitely a sessionable brew."
"Drinkablity> average."
"If its on Tap I am drinking it! probably a little to irresponsibly"
"This isn't really a beer that you would drink for the beer's sake, but it does actually compliment Japanese cuisine very well. Besides that, it's just a typical rice lager, nothing more. Kirin and Sapporo are better. It may be on par with Asahi for me. Pair it with food and it gets the job done."
"Atmosphere is decent. Nice full, foamy, head. Nose is pretty non-distinct. Flavor similarly, is nothing special, but not off putting either. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
"Clean from the start to end, undoubtedly one of the more flavorful mass-produced lagers from Japan. A sure pick for us when next thinking of sushi."
"D - Very easy to drink - - would have a few out by the pool."
"D: Very drinkable, but not flavorful enough to want multiple rounds. I would still order it over some american macros though, just because it is a fresh taste for me."
"overall impression, i would drink this again but i wouldnt pay for more than one of these at a steakhouse"
"Aroma is crisp and malty, OK, but nothing special. It pours a clear straw-yellow with a fairly thick white head. Flavor is rather wan, malty and rather sweet with just a hint of hops, again nothing special but still drinkable. Texture is smooth, fizzy and just a tad on the thin side. I won't be seeking this out again, but it was worth a fair shake."
"Appearance is a nice golden color with a fine crisp head. Smell of rice with a light earthy note. Taste of the rice with good hop having a light metallic bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel has good body for a lager with a nice spike of carbonation. Not bad, but could use a little more balance."
"D - A refreshing beer, definitely goes well with sushi but nothing special."
"I'm sure these rice lagers are extremely popular in Japan, their versions of BMC lagers or Euro macrolagers, but I do find this to be a little better than the American versions."
"i keep thinking this tastes like weihenstephaner original. it's the same beer!"
"The taste is similarly bland; watery up front, dry and fizzy with a slight mineral flavor. The mid-palate reveals a hint of malt and a slight slickness. Dry and lightly bitter in the finish. A clean and refreshing lager, albeit pretty bland."
"This may not be everyone's beer, but ahh, the memories!"
"It pours a crisp clear gold with a very small head and no lacing. It smells very similar to the USA macrolagers, except a bit stronger (stronger not always better). Its a sweet smell with only a touch of hops. The taste is also very generic. Its incredibly sweet all the way through with a slightly metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with average carbonation. There's nothing foul in this beer, so the drinkability is rather high. However, I probably won't be buying this beer again."
"I bought this mainly for the novelty of trying an Okinawan beer, and for the sturdy looking large bottle that looks great for homebrewing. I didn't have any expectations good or bad, but there's far better beers to be had from the nation of Japan."
"Paired this with sushi and was pleasantly surprised. Not great, but not all that bad."
"I bought this for the novelty of it. Similar to a lot of light lagers but a little bit cleaner maybe."
"D - I guess this is drinkable as far as cheap macros go, but I was not impressed at all. Definitely not one of the better Japanese rice lagers."
"Sweet 633 mL bottle with some code on the label; brewed with malt, cornstarch, corn grits, rice, water and hops. It's a crystal-clear, bright, light golden color, with light carbonation and three fingers of fluffy head that leaves a few patches of lacing. Very light aroma that is sweetish with a few notes of corn, and is almost pleasing really. Almost. Grassy and doughy malt flavors up front, backed by lemon, a hint of spicy hops, and a mild bitterness. The body is light and tingly, dry, and has a short finish. Not too bad of a beer really - it's nice and refreshing, and there are no real off-flavors. A decent, Japanese lawnmower beer."
"Not that that's a bad thing, if that's what you're looking for. There IS some flavor here, and although it is basically ""fizzy yellow beer", there's a time and place for that just as much as there's a time and place for a thick, rich barleywine. On a really hot day, out in the sun at a ballgame or out on a fishing boat, this would certainly serve a purpose."
"Drinkable in the way club soda is. OK tried this once, NEXT!"
"Obviously, not my first choice, but it is what it is, and I rated it accordingly. Poured up a very light crystal clear straw colour with a one finger thick snow-white soapy head. Smell was a bit grainy like 100's of others in this style; honestly, there was little to it. Taste was extremely light with a small bit of perceivable rice and a slightly dry finish with a bit of a biscuity profile to it. Mouth feel was about as thin as it comes. Quite drinkable considering the style and when you'd be likely to have this. Would I go out of my way to purchase this for drinking at home? Certainly not. Would I order it at a Japanese place to wash down my sushi? Probably. Decent, considering the style and toward whom it is targeted. As always, glad to have the chance to try it out."
"For more tasting details, please consult my other review (the outcome turned out about the same)."
"Drinkability: Nothing special. Average at best. Had it with some sushi and did it's job, just don't envision seeking this one out as a must have. I could see drinking many of these in one setting on a hot day, as it's akin to water."
"Lots of carbonation, not to much effect. Basically a very poor drink."
"If I hadn't poured this myself I would have thought I was drinking an American Macro lager. It needed a bit more taste, but what was there wasn't offensive. It would be easy to pound this beer all day if you were so inclined, but I'm inclined to prefer something with a bit more taste, so the one bottle is all I'd care to have."
"High carbonation made for a clean finish and easy drinkability if you can stand the taste."
"-it's refreshing without being over-carbonated"
"D - very drinkable. a fine choice at a japanese restaurant."
"Grass, rice, lemmon, pear and cinnamon in the aroma. Color of a bud light or any other Mass-Macro. Pours with a largish bubbly white head. Watery and bitter rice taste, but not in a very bad way, actually a decently refreshing aftertaste. Watery start to the mouthfeel ending very dry. Highly carbonated. Pretty boring."
"Overall, i am a little upset i payed about $4 for this bottle. The flavor is not that offensive, but i just do not care for it. kinda reminds me of a highlife. If i ever see this at a japanese restaurant, i will skip it and enjoy a sapporo."
"Pours with a pure white, two-finger head that goes slowly to a ring and leaving a good lace. Light carbonation and light bodied. Crystal clear golden amber color. Nose is weak malt. Flavor is bland, boring and inoffensive; sweet but insipid. Corn aftertaste. Buy only if you are bored with the macro lights. Cheap at $2.95 for a 633ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"D - This is pretty easy to drink and you can drink it all day and when I lived in Okinawa it was everywhere so we would drink it all day"
"Drinkability: As far a boring Japanese lagers go, this one is pretty good. No noticeable off flavors even after it warms a bit. A decent choice among Japanese macrobrews."
"I can't remember a thing about the four Japanese rice lagers that I drank prior to this one. If anything, this is even more of a generic style than American macro lager (and that's saying something). The only English words on the brewery's website are 'For Your Happy Time'. Actually, no time is the right time for Orion Premium Draft Beer. My time would have been happier if I hadn't spent $3.79 for the bottle."
"Drinkability: A drinkable but average Japanese beer."
"This is my pick over Asahi, Kirin, Sapporo, and yes, even (Y)ebisu, if you want to go there. I was pleasantly surprised with this one."
"I bought this to pair with some sushi and it really goes well. Definitely one of the best rice beers IÂ’ve had. ItÂ’s no huge malt or hop monster by any means, but against the other ricers it really stands out."
"By comparison to American macro lager I find this beer to be a step above. I find it odd given the fact that similar ingredients and processes are most likely used. Then again I've been to Japan before, and they do love rice so perhaps it's centuries worth of experience with fermenting rice beverages that gives this beer the edge. It's really not that bad, not quite a Prima Pils but not a beer to scoff at."
"Definitely a beer I can see joining my rotation as every day beers, particularly on a hot day. This goes down easy and doesn't offend the taste buds."
"Drinkability- It's about what you would expect for a macro-American lager."
"I danced around trying this beer for quite some time. Seeing everyone at one of my favorite watering holes pay good money for this, I thought I'd give it a shot. I was expecting it to wow me, but it didn't. It's a typical rice beer that has a corn sugar sweetness and void of meaningful character. Hopped for bitterness and light earthy flavors. Ends up lightly herbal, grainy, and a bit oily. Finishes shy of clean or crisp. Not a bad beer. I certainly prefer this to many other Japanese beers that I have tried."
"633 ml. bottle - dull gold hue Â– white alright head Â– fresh , and bright nose of sweet corn , bread , and sweet rice - watery , bitter, malt, skunk, hay , grassy , and slight hopps taste - light semi dry body but refreshing - bitter / skunk aftertaste"
"Drinkable because its mostly inoffensive, but also incredibly boring.. bleh."
"Overall, my one glass of this beer was enough. A very odd beer that seems to have taken a wrong turn somewhere. Definitely not recommended, except for the novelty of saying you've drunk a beer from Okinawa. I've been there, done that. No need for a repeat performance."
"Interesting, sort of retro bottle. Typical pale yellow and fleeting head that is typical of the style. Hops produced a pronounced grape flavor that I sometimes find in some German and Canadian lagers. Some sweet/tart counterpoint going on in the middle, and moderate astringency at the end. Finished with some husky, adjunct flavors. Not a bad beer."
"Overall Impression: Ok, everyone has slammed this beer, but I actually enjoyed it. Yes, itÂ’s macro water-beer. But it was clean, fairly smooth, and was a fair example of the style. I could see it pairing with many Asian foods. Scores reflect points for the style."
"Just another boring Japanese lager. Watery- very light texture, ricey, corny flavour. Pretty similiar to Asahi, Kirin, Sapporro etc....Reall, really, really, really hard to say anything about it, because there is asuch a distinct lack of flavour, very easy to drink gos down like water."
"The beer was a given as a gift to me by a friend of mine in a 633 ml. brown bottle with lots of self serving boasts on the label. The pour had the look of an ultra pale force carbonated mass produced lager. The smell was almost like tap water allowed to flow for a few moments over some cereal grains. The taste was not offensive, but was not anything to boast about. Basically a crisp, dry, grainy flavor with some malty sweetness thrown in. The hops were very light, but were not totally absent. The mouthfeel was light and watery. It is not a beer IÂ’d spend any money on, no matter what the label says."
"Ingredients: Malts, Hops, Rice, Corn Starch"
"Sinkability Â– IÂ’m not a big fan of Japanese beers, but this one was sub-par at that."
"Tastes like anonymous beer. Next to no hop flavor. Barely even a taste let alone any after taste. Very lightly carbonated. Drink this only when the only other option is to drink spit."
"I'm burping like a bastard and they are fairly loud and nasty burps. A wet guttural emission from the deepest, dankest depths produce the sounds of a thousand tormented voices. If you happen to be in Okinawa and notice some poor lost soul swigging from his bottle of Orion, turn around and go the other way!"
"On a positive note, it wasn't skunky."
"A fizzy yellow beer. It tastes like every other fizzy yellow beer in the world. It gets Points for not being skunky. Light malts and hops. Light flavor. Strange medicinal taste as it warms. Weirdly sweet. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is sweet and medicinal."
"It has a crispness to the mouthfeel but nothing special. After that it is straight down hill. I can't recommend this beer for any reason. Give me a soda please."
"The beer sets in the glass with a pertinent sized white head on top a clear gold body with decent lace forming as the head evaporates. Typical lager malt dominated nose crisp and clean and refreshing as far as that goes. Front is sweet, the top skinny and the finish highly carbonated, scarcely hopped with a malt dry aftertaste, archetypal lager/pils, nothing more nothing less."
