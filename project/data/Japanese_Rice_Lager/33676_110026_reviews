"Food match: Plain rice crackers, flavouring would only serve to overpower this beer."
"Overall, I'm not a fan. I've quite enjoyed some craft rice lagers recently; 2 Brothers Kung Foo is a case in point. But this relies on buttery Sorachi to do anything for it, and it just sort of melts into the overall messiness. Not for me."
