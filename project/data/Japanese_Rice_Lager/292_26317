The smell was metalic and sour. There was almost no taste at all, very watered down. I couldnt even detect any flavors at all. The mouthfeel is somewhat crisp in a watery way. Made me burp a lot. I like kirin ichiban but not this "bar" beer. May be a good beer for drinking games. This beer was definetly below the bar. pun intended.","FrothyBeverage","Beers"
