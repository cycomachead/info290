"Pours light golden in color. Brief white crown.Smells like a regular light lager,floral hints.Slightly sweet at first sip comes grainy,dry rice flavor.Light body,medium/heavy carbonation.Quite bland."
"Drinkability. It's a light beer but the lack of flavour makes it not drinkable."
"Overall, it's an OK lager. Just not the same as others."
"Not bad, worth a try, one of the best easily-available Japanese macros."
"Drinkability: Oh, how I tire of these fizzy, yellow beers. Even so, this one is pretty well put-together and largely inoffensive. More chuggable than drinkable."
"overall, not recommended."
"They're copying off Sapporo I believe with the ""classic"" idea--from Sapporo's ""classic"" beer offering."
"A bit of harshness on an otherwise insipid beer."
