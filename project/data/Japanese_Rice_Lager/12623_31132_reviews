"The taste is not really nice. Too sweet in the beginning and throughout. Some minimal bitterness in the end."
""
"....bland. tasteless, annoying dextrose notes."
"Apart from that, it's what you expect from an Asian beer. Minimal potency, light and subdued flavour, smooth drinkability without any party-animal excitement. A bland, stoic beer for the masses."
"I am sorry but the review stops here, there is nothing to write about. This is a nothing beer, no taste, no aroma, no flavour. There isn't even anything nasty to say about it, it is just an all round unbeer!"
"330 ml bottle.Clean golden colour, pours a more than decent head that fades almost instantly. As for the smell, I only can find grain, bread. Taste of grain, metallic notes and some sweet flavor. I really expected less of this one, nothing special but it has a clean palate and it's very refreshing."
"In short it is a refreshing beer, although characterless and empty. You can drink dozens of this one, as there is almost nothing there."
"This is the latest offering from the province run liquor monopoly. Don't these guys sample the beer before bringing it in? This is garbage. There's gotta be some better beers they could be bringing in. I just don't know why they won't."
"Taste was very bland, no bitterness and very few malt. So what do I taste? A faint bitter with some vegetable taste, that's it. The big nothing."
