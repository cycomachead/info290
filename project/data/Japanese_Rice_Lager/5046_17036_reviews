"Smooth to sip, will go quickly on a hot day."

"Yum. Really light  and a bit sweet."

"Poured a semi-clear rich golden body with one finger of bubbly white head that quickly receded. A very nice looking lager, with a richer color than most examples of the style. Very nice. Scents of softly sweet malt, grainy malt, a light hint of rice and light levels of earthy, dank herbal hops. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic Japanese Rice Lager, very true to form and quite appealing in its delicate, light aroma. Flavor begins lightly sweet, with soft, sweet malt notes and light hints of honey, and a touch of an earthy quality. Middle opens up with more pronounced flavors of honey and a light green tea with honey flavor, alongside softly sweet and bready malt and an undercurrent of earthy hops in the background. Finish is lightly dry with notes of honey, grainy malt and medium-light level of dank, earthy herbal and floral hop character. Aftertaste is medium-dry with notes of earthy and floral hops, lightly sweet honey and a medium-light bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a fantastic Japanese Rice Lager that is rich and flavorful, with a nice balance of sweetness and dryness, ending crisp. Simply fantastic and other examples of the style do not compare. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with medium-high prickly carbonation and a smooth, crisp feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very nice Japanese Rice Lager. Refreshing and crisp, light and balanced. Overall this is the finest example of the style I have sampled. It has a delicate and balanced aroma and flavor, aided by the crisp mouthfeel. Yet it is not weak in aroma and flavor, being both aromatic and flavorful, but in subtle, subdued and balanced ways. A true example of a truly Japanese style of beer."
"This poured a slightly golden straw colour with a minimal white head that quickly fades away leaving small islands of head.  The nose is very subtle with a hint of grass/straw, green apple and a mild hoppiness.  The flavour is crisp.  There is a mild graininess and citrus that flavour wise leans to the lemon/lime family but the tartness that is more apple.  A pretty standard lager feel and taste."

"Good while macking down some cherry salmon, but not much else."
""

"Tastes like a solid adjunct lager, and is actually quite pleasing compared to the usual Japanese macrobrews, particularly in its lack of a skunky quality."

"O: bottle likely had 6+ months age on it, at least... still, it was pleasant and drinkable enough for what it is - great brewing and packaging practices, no doubt"
"Overall it is what a rice forward made beer is, go eat this with some shrimp crackers and it's probably the best pairing. But it doesnt get more exciting than that."
"Bought this in Los Angeles. Pours a medium yellow with a nice white head. A fair amount of carbonation yet when I drink it there is not much carbonation at all. Almost flat. This is your typical malt beer that is clean. Not much body and nothing that stands out."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's no premium German lager, but there's good flavor here, and nothing off. Simple, but flavorful enough. Could easily drink a lot of this, especially on a hot day. Not half bad. Much better than Sapporo and the like."
""
"500ml bottle -from La Tienda de la Cerveza (Madrid)- Lager glass. Golden color, crystal clear appearance. Brief crown, white in color. Lager yeast, cereal, slight sweet aromas, herbal notes & minty hues to the nose. Malty, dried & voluptuous upfront. Light to medium body. Moderate to high carbonation. Sweet maltiness & rice touched by slight spicy flavors then clean & bitter flavor arises & lingers into a long bitter/sweet finish. Bitter aftertaste. Much better than regular Japanese Lagers."

"O: This beer pairs well with Japenese cuisine. It is easy to drink and the adjunct malts aren't too strong."
"17 oz bottle. Pours pale straw with white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of sweet malt and a hint of noble hops. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is of herbal, leafy hops and sweet malt. Finish is long and dry. There is some taste in this brew."
"I find this beer to be a very nice drinking beer.  It's flavors are clean and very late and represent the style very well"
""
""
"O: Lagers may not be my favorite beers, but this is one solid example of the style."
""
""
"Overall not worth the high pricetag for premium ingredients, fancy label, or importation costs. Guessing all of the above are contributing factors to a $10 rice lager."
""
"Pours a brilliant translucent light gold capped by a two finger billowing white head. Herbal notes, fresh grass, light floral accents and subtle hints of pear. Opens with fresh herbal notes and green, light honey notes, apple skin, transitioning to apple flesh. Finishes with delicate floral notes and continued light fruit notes. Light body that feigns heavier at times, abundant carbonation. Slick and smooth with every so light touches of syrup on the edges. I really enjoyed this brew which is fantastic example of the style."
"O- The nice clean light beer has some interesting but soft flavors, and the touch of sweetness really helps. Iâ€™m not sure it was worth the $7.99 price for 500 ml but it was nice to try."

"I'll avoid this one!"
"Bland, overly sweet. Bad beer. Bad, bad beer. Naughty."
""
"Not really all that bad; however, this offers nothing beyond the underwhelming norm - soul-sucking, quasi-sickly grain, crispness an ironically foreign concept, and overall just another lost chance at cross-culture beer knowledge enhancement."
""

"Overall: despite this beer's flaws and relative lack of flavor, it is stylistically accurate and pretty easily drinkable."
"Very little flavor, too. A little bit of dryness, and a more than a hint of corn syrup sweetness. I guess it's inoffensive, and pretty drinkable, but not good."
"Really? What is this? My only opinion is that it's a very generic pale brew brewed to be quaffable and devoid of flavour by someone who knew what they were doing. It's not unpleasant, it's not offensive, it's not undrinkable: it's just goddamn boring as shit."
""
"O- A nice, drinkable brew, goes well with sushi, definitely on par with the big name Japanese beers."
""
""
"O - a better sushi-lager than I've had in a while"
"Taste is bland. There is the vegetable taste and a light grainy taste. Further than that, nothing really sticks out. A very low bitterness and a total absence of a yeast profile. No off-flavors, but capitol bland. Mouthfeel is thin. Great for binging, I guess."
"My impression is this is less flavorful than even the big japo-industo brews. Not that it's bad, just would hope for a little more sparkle. Quite drinkable but but not worth the extra price. From a Sunflower Market in Santa Fe."
"Overall this beer is satisfying. It pairs perfectly with foods that have very subtle flavors."
"From the 500 ml. bottle. Sampled on April 23, 2011. The pour is a golden-yellow tone with a lot of carbonation building up to a two inch fizzy white head that diminishes in short order. There are malts in the aroma along with rice and cane sugar. The medium mouthfeel has a slick, creamy texture to it. Lots of sugar and malts in the taste as well with a slight hop bite at the end. It reminds me of a sweeter Becks."
"Beer is sweeter than expected, mildly grainy at the finish, light in body, mildly carbonated on the palate, overall nice in feel and flavor. Not offensive, overall weak in body and flavor, everything tastes muted on this beer. I'll drink the whole 500 ml but nothing too special here. This used to be the #1 Japanese rice lager, which is why I wanted to review it, but it is currently the #2 and I don't think I can recommend it enough to bump it up to #1, looks like I'm off to Canada!"
"Drinkability: very good with food. Slightly sweet. Very satisfying. One is enough."
"T: Slightly sweet and malty with a hint of citrus. Pretty average, but I'd rather have this than a Sapporo or Kirin. A good sushi beer."
"D: Drinkable and refreshing, but overpriced in the states and not as good as some of its competitors. It was a fine companion to sushi and soup, but failed to live up to my expectations."
"D: I thought this was actually pretty good. A really clean and easy to drink lager."
"D: It is a pretty average beer. I won't be getting it again."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into my Zatec fluted glass. Had no idea what I was getting into, as it's kinda hard to tell from the bottle. Though maybe I'd get lucky and stumble across a Hitachino competitor or what-not. Then I poured it. Didn't even give it a whiff yet, and as I was putting the glass down got a nose-full of adjunct sweet herbal nastiness. Fizzy yellow beer (for wussies). Got about a finger of very quickly dying white tacky head. Smells sweet, grassy, ricey, and like you'd expect from Japanese beer. Taste is overbearingly sweet. Giving me a headache. Overcarbonated on the mouth. Hard to drink. Hope I can finish the pint. Not good. Maybe if I had some spicy food to go with it."
"am strongly wishing i did have some sashimi to eat this with right now. a slightly sweet/slightly creamy fish would be a perfect match."
"D- overall, a good beer with food- wouldn't drink it on its own, but i will be drinking this next time i head to the same sushi bar"
"D: great session beer but not much else. Have had this beer numerous times and always drink lots of it."
"D: A slightly better version of the standard Japanese beer, but at $6 for a 500ml bottle, the price isn't justified. However, it pairs well with Japanese food and managed to cut the saltiness of my miso ramen soup. Personally, not my favorite style (basically just an adjunct lager), but this beer is what it is supposed to be."
"Drinkability> I guess."
"Classic lagers' taste, almost no hops, even weak malt, moderate carbonation, dry palate. Nothing special, only refreshes and let you indulge on the hot day."
"serving type: bottle"
"I do like the mouthfeel to this one, though... just the right amount of carbonation to it, which is good to see. And easily drinkable if you like the style."
"Very smooth and drinkable beer with a slight taste of hops. I have taste tested with friends and they found it to be very good. While somewhat light in body it had a very smooth mouth feel. It would be a beer that I would use to celebrate special occasions. Wish it were more widely available. Great with sashimi or sushi."
"Not really worth the price increase over Sapporo, Kirin, Asahi, Orion, etc."
"D: Not a very good rice lager, way too sweet."
"Overall, it's interesting, but not particularly exciting or even very drinkable. There's not a lot of flavor going on overall, and yet it kind of sticks in the mouth with fruit and sugar."
"Recommended..."
"Inoffensive and thirst quenching except for the initial skunkiness."
"Taste is somewhat malty and has noticeable rice character. The rice is mostly subtle and creates a softly pleasant flavor. Slight herbal hop presence in the finish. Feel is light-medium bodied and grainy with plenty of carbonation. Very crisp, clean, and dry finish. Drinkability is very good - it's very refreshing. The flavor and feel are both very good."
"The taste is light with grain barely dominated by grassy, faintly herbal bitter hops, giving a faint German quality to the character. It's clean, crisp, with brief aftertaste. It's somewhat watery and thin, but decent, like a more bitter-grassy watered-down Moosehead lager."
"Extremely mild beer with a light, sweet profile but little to recommend it. The beer is a clear light yellow with an almost entirely disappearing head. The smell is weak, sweet and slightly malty. Taste is similar with a light citric twist of bitterness if you close your eyes and concentrate. It's mostly just sweet and light. I enjoy it more than your average cheap macro, but there's so little of interest to take note of that it's hard to give the beer a higher score. The flavor of rice is, of course, present, and while it's not my favorite grain flavor, it's so mild that I can't complain really. The feel is fizzy but nice and light, which I appreciate with this style. It's easy to drink, except you might die of boredom from too many, so that's a minus. I definitely prefer it over a lot of American macros, but that's not a high compliment."
"Refreshing and MUCH BETTER than any U.S. macro lager."
"D: There really is no reason to drink this unless you're japanese."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly and leaving traces of lace. Clear pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Sweet grassy nose. Flavor is sweet, light, good lawn mower beer. Clean finish. Pricey at $6.95 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Thin fizzy no lace head. Clear thin watery yellow color.Mild hop front.Thin mild rice malt crisp CO2 tangy hint soft caramel light sweet body.Light tangy refreshing clean minimal hop end. Japanese--Weak but balanced and fresh. Nice artwork on bottle."
"Drinkability- Was hoping for something like a Sapporo. Have seen this beer at Ledger's and Ranch Market for the past couple years, but have been too cheap to drop the almost $4 on a beer hat I know would be no better than Sapporo. I was right and now I can afford one less gallon of gas. Damn you Japanesse rice lager beer!!"
"Mouthfeel is delicate if not thin. Highly effervescent. Really clean on the palate but that's just a result of the lack of flavor. Drinkable but not that enjoyable."
"Amazingly drinkable, and perfect for paring with the more subtle nature of Japanese food, the one your West Coast Double IPA will overpower. Try it!"
"d: i feel that there are other mainstream japanese beers that are much more enjoyable than this one."
"Very floral, fruity, citrus aroma with banana, apple, and a dash of malt. Pours with a large white head that leaves in about 2 minutes. No lacing. Very sweet tasting Japanese beer, almost as if it had corn in it (which I doubt is the case). Dry palate with lively carbonation. Nothing to seek out."
"Drinkability: Meh. In my opinion this is kind of a waste of koshihikari rice. It's great to eat and it lends a very nice, delicate character to sakes, but gets lost here among the malts and hops. This is a good lager, but it's a good lager that could have been made from pretty much any other cultivar of rice. After tasting it, the koshihikari seems a bit gimmicky to me."
"Another from Uwajimaya in Seattle. Appearance is a light golden color with a crisp head that keeps a thin film on top when dissapated. Smells is not typical of a macro lager, it's slightly sweeter with rice and grain that is cleaner. Taste is somewhat saline with hint of rice and a good cabonation that dances on the tongue finishing clean with a light mouthfeel. Nothing to dramatic here, just a good one to try."
"Nice label. Pours a clear straw with almost no head. Nose is slightly grainy. Flavor is pretty subdued. Overall smooth with a slight grain influence. Feel has a nice bubble on the tongue and a well balanced liquid feel. Very drinkable, but keep the style in mind."
"Mouth and drinkability- very crisp, clean, and like the appearance- clear. Easily drinkable, and would obviously go well with sushi or tempura."
"The beer evacuates the 500ml brown bottle a clear gold, the head average in size and bright white in color, the texture creamy, as it dematerializes, and the lace forms a thin veil upon the glass. Nose is somewhat sweet, crisp and clean; start has a decent malt presence, sweet with a modicum of bitterness, light to moderate in feel. Finish has a stern acidity, hops light but pleasing and the lingering aftertaste is desert bone dry, I must say on average I like Japanese Rice lagers much more than American macros."
"Overall, quite drinkable. Good session beer or drink with light food. One of the better beers of the style."
"Wow!! this baby is sooo clean and crisp and refreshing that I'd love to see this enter the country in a case of cans. The oversized bottle will work for now."
"This was what I'd call a very good version of Asahi Superdry. Say what you want about light lagers, there are good versions that exist that are crips, refreshing, and full of flavor. This is one of them."
"Drinkability- Very easy going. Good as a dinner brew or as a working out in the yeard brew. The finish does get worse as it warms and flattens."
"D: Nice beer to drink with sushi and I can see myself drinking it again."
"D: One of the better Japanese rice beers I've had. At the least, it stands out from the pack and I could pick it out in a blind tasting, easy."
"Overall: Nothing outstanding or vaguely interesting and it suffers from some of the worst aspects of the American Macro lager. A reasonably clean drinking brew that doesnÂ’t take much effort, which is suited to a warm sunny September afternoon in Long Beach."
"Mouth: Rice. Not in a sake way, but like rice on your plate. Has a strong bubbly mouthfeel. Malts up front and along sides of mouth, almost to the extent of a malt liquor. Has just an inkling of a bitter finish with some warmth and a chewy hop sensation, tingly with chili peppers and a grape skin sweet/bitter character. It's an excellent beer for a hot day in the sun, as long as it's served cold."
"tastes like a japanese rice lager, and a fine one. smooth and thirst-quenching after a hot day. the amazing thing about this beer, and i will probably remember it for this reason, there are no off flavors. as i said, it's probably an old can. but it is still tasty and lacks the tap water taste i get from so many macros. worth a try."
"It's drinkable but not special in any way. More could have been done with the ingredients, but as is it's just mediocre."
"Overall: the bottle is really pretty."
"This beer is named after a type of rice famous in Niigata, where Echigo is located. This rice is used in the making of the beer. FYI, Echigo is also the old name for the area that is now Niigata-ken."
