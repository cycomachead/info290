2.67,-18.6,2.5,3,2.5,2,3,"Definitely drinkable on a hot day. But on a chilly night like tonight, it's little more than an appetiser. Hopefully the Tokyo Black I'll follow this up with has a bit more guts to it.","Weizenmensch","Feb 22, 2008"

3.66,11.6,2,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: Not quite world-class or anything, but it's a good, refreshing and nicely hoppy lager. It's cheap for what it is, too. Recommended.","soulgrowl","Jun 12, 2004"
3.56,8.5,2.5,4,3.5,2.5,4,"Almost no head on a boring pale golden color. The smell is of sweet fruity tea and caramel. The taste is quite fresh, sweet citrus, ginger. Maybe sweet hints of caramel. A chewy grassy hoppiness in the back of the mouth. Kind of watery. Probably a good session brew.","tjd25","Feb 20, 2003"

1.58,-51.8,5,2,1,2,1,"Beautiful pale gold. Restrained bitterness. Malty broad creamy flavor. Tastes like creamed corn. Could not get the taste out of my mouth for a day and a half. I went to sleep an hour after drinking this beer because the creamed corn flavor was making me feel bad and I woke up an hour later barfing my intestines out. I felt like this beer was trying to turn me inside out.","Naerhu","0"
