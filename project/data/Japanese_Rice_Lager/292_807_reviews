"sapporo is better if your sushi joint  has a choice. But not if its priced much higher."

"The feel isn't as bad as the flavor would portend; it actually feels less harsh and grainy than it tastes, which is unusual. It dries out much too hard for a light-bodied beer, though, and despite a thin texture it's fairly bright. It certainly is crisp, at least."

"Goodbye Hong Kong. Hello Tokyo. Time to try a few Japanese beers on my travels. Poured from an 11.2 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, a touch of malts. Taste is light, some malts, rather bland and boring. Feels light in the mouth and overall, while nothing offensive, just left me wanting more."

"Overall: Not a bad beer, goes well with hibachi and sake."

"O: This is a below average lager by any definition. Really has no character, and its awfully boring. I wouldnt recomend."

"There are no off nodes. Absolutely nothing unpleasant. But it's basically yellow water."
""

"Taste is...ok, I suppose if you want something cold, fizzy, and beer-y to go with food or pub snacks. The rice and starch have really cut the taste of the malt, and there isn't much of a hop presence."
"There's nothing really wrong with this other than it's boring."
"Pours a pale yellow color, some carbonation, little fizzy white head, with not much sticky lacing left behind. The nose is grainy, ricy, skunky. The taste follows the nose, not much going on at all. Light Body, mostly water. A big dissapointment, would not recommend."
"When the choice at the sushi place is Kirin or Sapporo, I'm choosing Sapporo. Or actually I think I'm choosing the iced tea. Iced tea and sushi really go great together and it tastes so much better than this."
"overall just not even a beer to me, i not compliment dinner and was more just a waste of 3 bucks."
"D: A non offensive beer, best when served with Asian food."
"Maybe a little the average AB product, more or less the same.. Smells like nothing at all, maybe slight wheatiness. Tastes of rice adjuinct. No esters or bitterness. Light sugar and barely perceptible malt role. Refreshing like water or instant lemonade, easy to drink. Reminds me of mexican beer, particularly tecate. I could be wrong but im betting they both use rice."
"Taste, more metal, and that's about it. Metal water. No hops, lots of carbonation. This stuff is $7 a 6 pack, are you kidding me? They charge less for water at concerts or sporting events. A decent beer with food I guess, if you don't want to have anything competing flavor wise with the food."
"Not much really to say other than its very easy to drink. Aroma and Taste is non-existant. Very simple rice lager. Washed down a meal I guess but really for $7 a bottle you need to offer a bit more than that."
"The best thing about drinking this beer would be some spicy food or a sweltering hot day."
"Drinkability: all around boring beer that can be consumed with some hot and spicy food, but not as a stand alone session beer."
"Drinkablity: Easily consumable. Cheap and readily available, but has limited character."
"Drinkability : a not impressed beer in the style Japanese rice lager."
"drinkability: not a fan, a blank beer with zero taste. I'd rather have bud light and thats bad."
"Appearance is decent - yellow body with a fluffy white head and some lacing. Sweet, slightly leafy aroma. Body has a very mild bitterness, a good dose of sweet malts and little else. Fairly bland and inoffensive, but not particularly pleasurable. Like water, really, but more expensive. Carbonation is high and body is light."
"Overall not too bad, but then again not too good either...Average on all accounts"
"There is no need for anyone to ever sample this beer, water is a better choice every time."
"Taste was bland, some maltiness and very little bitterness. For the rest not much taste, not even when the beer warms."
"tastes like you would expect, poor. kirin is trying hard to be the producer of the most different kinds of bad beer, they have many. yuck. aftertaste is bile."
"beer make of rice also like sapporo; nice flavor, hops, and rich in adjoincts; special for the seafood and fish, try with cheese; full bodied flavor; its bottle label design is one of the most beatiful in the beer world; 78% recommended. not good for mexican food."
"poured a pale yellow color with a nice puffy white head. Smell is virtually non-existent with only a bit of metallic noted. Taste is very light with nothing offensive or overly enjoyable. Finishes as a refreshing beer, but no better or worse than any other lager. Drinkable, but nothing to go out of my way to get."
"A try for sure, not sure id buy by the pack."
"Medium gold in color with a medium bright white head that fades quickly, cratering itself. Smell is of light grassy malt and a bug spray like alcohol quality. Taste is very light and watery, with most of the flavor coming in the form of light maltiness. No hops present. Mouthfeel is watery thin, making this beer represent itself as a watered down vrsion of a standard euro lager, which is probably the result of rice in the brewing process. Thin and boring, and not for me."
"355 mL brown bottle with the production date clearly stamped on the rear label."
"Another ""World classic""! Line up for this one. A heavy pour and got a three-fingered head that faded quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Clear golden color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Starts with hints of hops and adjuncts, lingering bitter after-taste. On par with Budweiser. $1.60 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"No more for me, please."

"Drinkability: Easier to drink than Kirin Ichiban. Like any number of liight beers, this goes down like water all night."
"Appearance: Light straw yellow tone with a white fizzy head leaves minmial lacing, sorry looking lager. Aroma: Grainy corn and rice combo with some husky offness with a touch of hops should be clean and fresh smelling like a nice crisp lager should be. Taste: Grainy huskiness along with the corn and rice adjuncts not what I was looking for when dining Japanese, is drinkable but the flavors didn't work for me. Mouthfeel: Thin bodied fizzy carbonation doesn't satisfy me. Drinkability: Well, yeah I will probably never give this one another shot much rather settle for a Sapporo before this one."
"Pours light straw, with a white head. Bit of hops in nose, not much else. Very Light bodied lager, high carbonation. Not much malt, hops, or flavor. Some nasty off flavors, apple/cotton candy. Tried this one at my local sushi place, I'd have a bud or miller next time, this stuff is nasty."
"Great drinkability - My wife recommended this after her trip to Japan, which included a trip to a Saki brewery where they were serving Kirin alongside the saki shots. I'll take her word about the saki, but the KL I can verify as tasty!"
"Dry light and crisp feel, too bad the rest of the beer couldn't back up the refreshing mouthfeel. I don't think I'd even drink this in a Japanese restaurant."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is weak, but clean and dry. It has the scent of pale malts and lager yeast. The taste is decent. It has a dry finish. The beer is pretty simplistic in flavor. There is the presence of pale lager malts and not much else. It tastes refreshing and clean. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. It drinks well; a fine lager."
"In the mouth, there's low carbonation, just enough to feel at the end of a gulp if not taken too quickly. A very much drinkable beer. The carbonation disappears completely no doubt but the maltiness rounds out and the covers the bitterness over."
"Its slightly hazy golden body is topped by a decent-sized head of creamy white foam that diminishes shortly but leaves some thin lace in its wake. The nose displays some lager yeast sulphur over a bit of grainy malt and a drop of floral hoppiness. The body is light, and it's gently crisp with a fine and median carbonation before warming to become slightly creamy across the palate. But apart from its sulphur constituent, the flavor is not much different than most mass-produced American lagers. Its lightly grainy, but obviously adjunct-influensed, character is balanced by a firm bitterness and some dull, leafy, herbal, and grassy hops. It finishes short and dry - almost like a light beer! There's not alot going on here."
"The head, made of big, frothy bubbles, was initially large but quickly receded into a thin film; the lace made a valiant effort to stick and wasn't entirely unsuccessful. There was a touch of citrus and cereal to the aroma but there really wasn't anything noticeable or noteworthy about the smell. Therefore, it wasn't surprising, after taking the aroma into consideration, that the beer was virtually flavourless. The aftertaste was skimpy, lemony and slightly bitter. I suppose Kirin is drinkable (perhaps, as a palate cleanser when you put an extra large dollop of wasabi in your mouth) but I don't see much point in trying another."
"In 2/3rds of the sushi bars I've ever been in, your beer choices are confined to this, and Sapporo. Drink the Sapporo. It's not great, but it's better than this."
"Medium gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and very slightly sweet.Medium bodied lager. A hoppy, somewhat malty lager. Full bodied, malty. Mouthfeel is full and round. Good balance. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"A rather weak lager that reminds me somewhat of a mixture of Bud and some weak Euro-lagers. Unimpressive."
"Thin aroma and taste of fruit and hops. No particularly noteworthy characteristics, just factory beer. Simply unremarkable stuff without being actively disagreeable. Yawn."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized off-white bubbles that quickly disappeared. It had a medium strength aroma of fruit and a smooth fore and after taste. Its flavor contained notes of malt, bread and roasted nuts."
"When poured, this brew had a small white head that consisted of small bubbles that completely diminished. There was a fair amount of lacing with this brew. The body was clear and the hue was yellow. It had a light hoppy and fruity aroma along with a bitter flavor from start to finish."
"A bit sweet tasting, slightly slightly bitter, but not much really. The mouth feel is quite watery, no carbonation either."
"Sadly it goes downhill from there..body is weak, taste is mildly of the hops and wanting..leaves you asking ""whats next"" please?"
"Pours a clear very pale golden straw color with a foamy white head that quickly dissipates into a thin lace. Nose is grain and rice with some faint sulfur notes. Taste is an overly processed grainy husk flavor and is a bit astringent. Very light in body. This is simply a bad beer. Several other reviewers mentioned that it goes well with certain foods, and that might be true, but I drank it by itself, and its not good alone."
"And no, I do not know what healthy piss in a mug looks like."
"tasted this beer in a Japanese restaurant with food. This beer poured a golden colour topped by a very poor head that dissapears very quickly. No aroma and nothing special on the flavour. Very poor Japanese beer. Next time i'll look for alternatives on the menu"
"It won’t be on my shopping list again!!!"
"This looked like it was going to be really good. Boy was I wrong! It smelled and tasted like a skunk! The beer was a nice golden color with a little bit of a white head to it. It had a nasty aftertaste of skunkiness. All in all, it's a bad brew, maybe I got a bad batch of it. Oh well, I'm defiantely not going to waste my time on this anymore."
"Born on date is 21-Aug-02, so alas, this is a resonably fresh sample."
"On the pour a crystal clear bright gold color, the head impressive in size, white in color with decent lace to coat the glass. Malt nose, clean and crisp the front is sweet, top skimpy. Finish is hop spicy, middling in its acidity, droughty aftertaste, drinkable as Lagers go, but not a real hit me, but then nine out of ten lagers/pils elicit that reaction from this old Stout and Belgian strong lover. I think these bad boys have corrupted my Buds as in taste."
"Down the drain it goes"
"Not a striking sight with a golden straw colour and foamy, white head.  The smell is a turn off that is musty short of stinky/skunky.  Taste too metallicy for a bottled brew, but has hoppy tones.  Aftertaste lingers a bit much.  The feel is pleasantly light and airy but a shade too biting.  It drinks better than it looks or smells.  Would be best suited for post-lawn mowing thirsts.  I do not know about the sushi thing as I would prefer a better beer for such a meal. I would not trun my nose up to it, it is beer afterall."
"Free leftovers... I feel better than I didn't buy this. More golden in color than the Ichiban, which I thought was more tolerable. This one had a weird biting acidic smell, then a simialer taste. No really positive tastes. Mostly some acidic finish tastes, very harsh. (Is it the rice ?) I didn't care for it. If presented with a choice, I prefer the Ichiban. Owned by AB, but tried not to let that influence the tasting."
"Pale color, big bubbled head that splits in an instant.  Very weak in most categories, head, color, flavor.  Watery to the extreme, though I taste no corn characteristics.  But with such little malt flavor, it might benefit from a little sweetness.  It is dry but the hops are uninteresting.  I had a lot of Kirin's in Japan as well and it doesn't come off well there, either, IMO..."
"The same as the Ichiban, but even less interesting, no flavour, easy to drink, boring for us beer freaks, not that great a beer."
"I've got to question the brewery: the bottle I'm holding says Anheuser-Busch, L.A. Cali.  The bottle has a bottled on date. The beer looks every thing like an American macro-lager.  Head collapsed into soap suds within a few seconds.  Tastes like Bud Dry. Awful."
"Label notes that it is brewed ""under the supervision of Kirin's brewmaster.""  Hey, Brewmaster, wake up!  Weak and watery."
"Notes: A run of the mill lager. Certainly not impressive, but also not revolting. A very commercial example of a modern day American Lager. I must admit that it pairs extremely well with sushi -- so it's true, each beer has its time and place."
