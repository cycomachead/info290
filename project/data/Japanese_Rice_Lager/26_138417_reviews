"this beer was a little too sweet for me"
"Surprisingly sweet and smooth enjoy"
"O- Overall this is a very unique beer with a very plain profile- as expected.  The alcohol is deceivingly well hidden and the overall presentation of the beer is smooth and classy."

"Overall, this was sake as beer if one could ever imagine it.  While this is an imaginative concept, this beer seemed rushed and rough about the edges, but ultimately well-flavored.  Generally speaking you receive the exact beer that is advertised.  The grain bill, from the very beginning, is intensely foreign and unabashed, forcing the mouth and taste buds into an uncomfortable conformity that you soon quickly learn to appreciate.  The feel is intensely drying between globs of lactic foaminess secondary to the sake component of the beer.  This certainly makes things come across as a little boozy, that push to the liquor side of life adds a hard edge to this beer that you can curiously get behind, even if you donâ€™t particularly enjoy that."
