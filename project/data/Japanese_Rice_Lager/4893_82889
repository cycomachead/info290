4.23,0,,,,,,"Bought a bottle of this from Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo. Poured into a Baird pint glass. Gold cup winner in Japan and a first for rice-based lagers. This brew brings the rice to the forefront by focusing on high-quality Koshihikari rice grains. The appearance is a light clear wheat that looks like a sunrise with a thick white marshmallow head. The flavor is definitely different from other beers, clearly focused on showcasing a rice flavor. It does this supremely well, and I can almost taste the husks of unpolished rice. It is a very pleasant brew, and I enjoyed this lager as much as I would an ale. Loved it!","shigg85","0"
