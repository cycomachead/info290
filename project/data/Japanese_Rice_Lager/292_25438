3.75,0,,,,,,"Clear dark yellow body with a small white head. Full bodied malt aroma, with some fruit and flora/grassy notes. Quite sweet, but also dry, with a nice leafiness, reminiscent of a pils. Pleasant bitterness. Medium body and carbonation... quite refreshing taste. Not bad for a macro beer.","bobsy","Jul 13, 2006"

3.62,0,,,,,,"Not the worst beer to pick up off the shelf in a combini -- hopefully it sticks around for more than a couple of months. All the best Braumeister.","donnebaby","Beers"
