"there is a slight clove flavour some malt also in aroma but a huge amount of meh"
""
""
"Alright light, almost no flavor,malty taste"
""
""
"For the style, pretty decent brew."
""
"Just some light beer, to be drunken ironically"
"Not terrible in a pinch."
""
"Poor head and retention. Crystal clear. Oversweet."
""
""
"used to drink the hell out of this back in the day in college.  First time I've had this in 20+ years.  It's decent now, sweeter than I remember...but I'm used to porters and stouts."
"O  -a decent alternative to the regular AALs at a very affordable price of $6/6pk at TJs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A clear gold with a dense, white head that falls off to a ring slowly, this looks great! The nose is rather inoffensive. A mildly sweet, faintly hoppy, lemony character is present with some polished rice. Clean. The palate opens crisp if a bit watery, spritzy, a little lemony, a little earthy. No off-flavors. A little watery on the finish, but still quenching. Among the better pale lagers out there.Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkable but not very good"
"Second time was way better"
"Nothing special about this beer"
"Not a very good beer at all.  Had it Japan so I thought it would be better than what gets exported to the US, I was wrong."
""
"The Sapporo we get in Mexico is made in Ontario, Canada. And it´s not a Rice Lager, but an American Adjunct Lager."
""
""
"Very clear. Smell Apple juice and rice. Taste similar to a Budweiser but also crisp and a little dry."
"Always a safe bet over a macro lager"
"Nice taste, not great, but pretty good."
"Sake Bomb! Sake Bomb! Sake Bomb!"
""
"if I get it right, it's not japanese-brewed one, but CA or US, and surpisingly(!) bad enough that I even didn't manage to drink that stuff to the end. this is a one per very few cases i didn't drink it to the end. i just don't get it. i don't even know where do you get that, I travelled through half a country and never saw this one on sale hre in Japan... something's really off here. anyway even if it's japanese one, it's highly unrecommended buy.."
""
"It's a beer beer. It tastes like beer and nothing more. No dynamic notes for aroma, taste, or feel, but I would not count this as a hated beer for me. If I'm eating hibachi, this still gets the job done."
"O.K...It's bad. However, I do believe that there are much more highly rated beers that are less refreshing and taste worst...It cleanses my palate while eating and ensure I buy a more quality brew on the ride home from our favorite Japanese place...which is great..."
""
"Overall: It wasn't an enjoyable beer to drink. The can was really cool looking though..."
"It tastes like High Life."
""
""
""
"There's no need to knock a macro or adjunct lager if it does it's job.  This beer was thirst quenching and tasty and went well with my yellowtail and scallion rolls.  Not something to pick apart and scrutinize, just gulp it down and enjoy with your Japanese food!"
"Skunky, very light bodied, some buscuity taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's thin and weak. It's ok for the meal but not for afterwards."
""
""
""
""
"Decent beer. Very typical of rice lagers, almost tastes like Busch to me."
""
"650ml can, meaning the beer has a slight metallic taste, otherwise not bad, fairly generic lager if you ask me. As far as jap beer goes, better to stick with Kirin Ichiban if you ask me."
""
"Fairly clean adjunct lager that's excellent with sushi."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very accessible beer with a bad smell...is the can bottle doing this?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a very poor tasting beer.Like a glass of bad water."
""
"asian beers that get exported to canada? .. like.. tiger.. and maybe a few others, the other options are not great either, I'd say sapporo is top of the range for asian beer. but maybe i have no idea. anyways. its pretty decent, i like it for eating with. goes great with guess what... asian food.  haha."
"Just not a good beer. But whats a man to drink when he wants a beer at a small sushi restaurant."
""
""
"This is just absolute crap"
""
"Brilliant golden color with great clarity.  A trace of off white covers half of the top.  Aroma is rice and a somewhat skunk note that seems to dissipate somewhat gradually.  The taste is white rice.  The mouth is crisp and yet a bit thin."
""
"My first rice lager and I was not a fan. Its water with a faint hint of beer. If you are a light lager person or someone trying to expand there palate then I say go for it but for those who are looking for a full body tasting beer than I would tell you to pass on this beer."
""
"A decent beer for the style, and better than some other macro rice lagers. Nothing special, but definitely refreshing in and inoffensive to enjoy with food. My first choice at hibachi and sushi joints."
"Very sweet no bitterness very easy drinking worth a go"
"Very crappy don't like it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an average beer w good marketing behind it."
"Too much sweetness from the rice, otherwise tastes like a macro adjunct. Somewhat fond of this beer as it was always the beer half of the quintessential college ""sake bomb"" combination."
""
""
"This beer is pretty good."
"So overall would I recommend it ? If you find it on special like I find it, yeah its different but not exceptional, if its not on special, get something else."
""
"Pretty decent beer. Better than a regular draft beer."
"Overall: an average and overall unimpressive macro lager that is assumedly designed to have low taste for throwing back, but there are still better macro lagers for the AU$45 a case bracket."
"I will not be buying this beer again."
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, E2313G bottle code. Pours slightly hazy pale straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lemon, cracker, light bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Okay aromas with good balance of pale malt, rice, earthy hops, and light yeast notes; with poor strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, light bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, light bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and solid robustness of pale malt, rice, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly dry mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is a very solid rice lager style. All around good balance and solid robustness of pale malt, rice, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"O – I do like Sapporo better than the larger American lagers, partly because I think the rice provides a nicer flavor and smoothness than corn.  However, this is not very good beer.  For what it is, it is alright though."

"Had with sushi. Pours a light yellow with a lot of fizz although it leaves quickly and cleanly. The smell is of rice and a little bit of metal. The taste was heavy with fermented rice but gave the fish time to shine. As far as pairing with food I thought this beer did it's job well but on it's own it's nothing special."

"22 ounce can.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with a half inch white head that stuck around a little while.  There's also a decent amount of lacing.  Not much to the aroma, the brew smells like sweet malt and some light breadiness.  I think the taste is pretty much like the aroma, it's sweet and bready, but also has a bit of bitterness in the finish.  Also has a flavor that reminds me of Budweiser.  Not sure if it's from the rice, but there's just something similar about it to me.  Mouthfeel/body is light, it has a good amount of carbonation and it's easy enough to drink.  For what it is, it's not a bad brew at all.  I'd just have to be in a certain mood to drink this again, it's certainly not an every day beer for me.  It's worth a try if you've never had it before."

"The nose is a crackery Pilsner malt with a little Euro skunkiness.The flavor follows suit with a lower quality Pilsner style but a move away from the rice centric typical in Japanese beers. The flavor is malty and crackery, despite being a rice beer. Overall it's kind of weak in flavor but it's very easy to drink and delivers beyond most adjunct or rice beers."

"As far as light beers are concerned, Sapporo is one of the better ones that I've had. The beer pours a light yellow with a thick head. The taste is pleasant and refreshing. If you're to try a light beer, I recommend this beer over Coors Light any day."

"Good sushi...pint of Sapporo...enough said..."
"Overall - decent rice lager that is quaffable, but not terribly exciting. Wouldn't pass one up for free though."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not great but not awful either.  The beer reminded me of a better tasting Budweiser, but definitely not a flavor I typically seek out when drinking beer.  However, if you are drinking very flavorful Asian food, and don't want a flavorful beer to compete, this beer would work well."
""

"A decent rice beer, I guess as far as rice beers go. Color was yellow with an average head, which did not stay around long. Ok malt flavor and do I get a hint of hops?. Carbonation was good and finish was crisp and clean. An ok beer that I would definitely need to have very cold. One of the better rice beers I have tasted"

"I bought this ber as part of a make your own six pack. Total drain pour. No flavor what so ever. I've only said this about one other beer, but the only word I can use to describe it is YUCK!!! I will never make the mistake of putting this in my mouth again!"

"Sapporo is a mildly sweet beer with a slight malt flavor, and no hops detected. The beer is easy to drink and goes down somewhat smooth. This beer would be enjoyable except for one key point. The major flaw of this beer is a nasty metallic aftertaste it leaves in your mouth after you swallow. It seemed to get worse and stronger the more you drink. I did get this beer from a can, but that aftertaste alone makes me leery of ever trying this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit too metallic and sour, not as sweet as the Japanese version, this can was brewed in Canada."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I personally like this beer. It's got a good, clean taste. There's just enough flavor to make it yummy, but it's not too rich or bitter. I find it to be great as a refreshing beer, and I totally get why they drink it with Japanese food. It's not too overpowering."

"Rice lager? More like piss lager. I was excited and expecting a lot more out of this beer and it let down. If I had to compare it to anything it would be an adjunct lager. In fact. this tasted eerily similar to Bud Light. Won't be trying this one again."
""
"Overall- I don't know why I bought this, I saw it on the shelf and thought ""what the hell"". I've never tried it before and now I know why. It's not terrible it just tastes like every other macro-brew out there."

"Refreshing adjunct lager with lower than average off-flavors. Pretty sessionable as expected, but I wouldn't miss it."
"Overall, this is basically your average lager, but smoother and thicker feeling. Definitely a good option for when you're feeling like a lighter lager, but something that is just a little bit different."
""
""
"Pours a lighter golden color with a thin white head that doesn't last a long time. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. LOTS of bubbles streaming up form the bottom and sides of the glass all the way to the end. The aroma just of some sweet malt/grains but that is about it. The taste is about the same with a hint of rice sweetness. No bitter aftertaste at all though. Would be great when eating sushi or another dish with the rice taste from the beer. Overall, it was just average."
""
""
""
""
"Extremely refreshing, sweet and crisp lager. Very enjoyable. Advised to try it with Japanese cuisine - particularly with light meals such as sushi and starters such as gyoza and tempura. Although generally quite expensive in English supermarkets and Japanese restaurants."

"Overall an easy drinking lager that has a redeeming sweet quality. Would pick this up at a Japanese restaurant with a meal."
""
"Overall - This a good everyday beer, I prefer it over most AAL."
"*Overall, no. I don't really wish to drink this again. There is a high gravity buttery sweetness and that cooked veggie scent that makes this extremely off-putting. I'll stick to Miller or Coors, or even throwback Shlitz if I want an average type lager."

"The taste is where this beer comes out short, with a malty flavor that sours between sips. You have to hope that restaurants will begin to carry the better Japanese brews (Hitachino, Suntory), or else delicious sushi will have to be paired with less than delicious beer."

"The feel is smooth with moderate carbonation on the tongue, but no harsh feeling going down, so it's a very, very easy beer to drink. Overall, it's one of the better Asian-style macros I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this tastes just like a BMC but Japanese, it met my expectation, and now i'm going to finish it before it warms up and becomes a sink pour. Would not recommend."
"Actually works fairly well for the category. Very easy drinking and sessionable."
"This beer is a aillte above a pretty good lager. The price is high for what you get. I will stick to Budweiser and pabst blue ribbon because those have a cheaper price tag."

"O: Would not go out of my way of my way to drink again, but this seems like a decent everyday beer."

"Food match: Not fit for potato chips."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty average beer. I'd buy it again, but maybe just because I'm a Japanophile. I wouldn't buy it often, but not a bad beer."
"The Verdict: Bland but drinkable. There's nothing exciting at all about this rice beer imported from Japan, but that's not to say it's bad. It's just a bit flavorless, which is still preferable from the skuny cheap macrobrews like Keystone or Coors."

"Atmosphere is ok. Lots of carbonation, nice head, and pretty solid lacing. Nose is a little pungent combination of yeast and wheat. Flavor of white bread.... just kind of there. Nothing distinct about the flavor or feel. Overall, this is an ok quaff."

"Poured from the 22 oz can into a pint glass, nice golden pour with a 1 1/2 finger white head. The smell is as you would expect with this style, crisp and clean with a little malt coming out. Taste is again crisp and clean and would really go with sushi, miso soup, pho or any Asian food fair....because you need to be able to taste the food. This beer is doing what it's supposed to do, I like it for a Japanese Lager."

"O- I got what I expected from this beer. I'd never had it, but I could have told you pretty much what it was gonna be like beforehand. Boring, what little taste is there is foul, etc, etc... One of the reasons people think beer is nasty. Didn't even finish the can."

""
""
""
""

""
"O - Overall, It was virtually the same as it's American counterparts. Wasn't worth the $4 for the aluminum bomber."
""
""
""
""
"Poured this Japanese Rice Lager from a can into a pint glass. Poured a light straw color, Produced a thick white head, retention was average and it did leave some lacing on the glass. The aroma is weak, containing some hints of grain and grassy hops. Light in body, a base of grain and some light hops. This is basically a typical macro brewed lager, says its from Japan but it is brewed up north in Canada. Overall, the flavor was typical of a mass produced lager, as the brew warmed it went south quickly. Poor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Seems like a decent enough beer for the style. Delicate in nature but smooth and easy drinking. Not necessarily my personal preference for an everyday beer, but for someone looking for an easy going, non-complex beer, this one would do nicely."

""
"This beer is as expected, rather anonymous. It does quench one’s thirst and makes a decent lawnmower beer. There is no compelling reason for me to have another."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours clear deep golden color. The nose is a much more subtle aroma that matches the taste. The beer is similar to an adjunct lager at first. It has a definite sugary quality and a sweet caramel flavor. The beer has a lot of grain flavors that are simple but still taste of a high quality. Mouthfeel is light but its easy to drink and doesnt have any offense off flavors. A great improvement over american adjunct lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

" This is clean and crisp. Not an amazing craft beer but not an offensive lager either."

"Served on a chilled glass from a 12 oz bottle. This is a classic japanese lager, when served it had a thick 1 finger head. It's color was dark yellow maybe even light brown. The smell was ricey and very inviting. Taste wise it was somewhat bitter, definitely could taste the hops and had a very good aftertaste. It's a very smooth drink that goes along well with japanese cuisine, I highly recommend it and if you have the opportunity you should give it a try."
""
""
""
"Overall - A beer I love to pair up with Philly and Rainbow rolls at the local sushi place, call me bias, this one holds a special place in my heart. Nothing too special, but there's a nostalgic value I hold with this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Probably... despite there being not much to this beer, it is light and refreshing, but not always with it for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ah,sushi and sapporo match made in heaven. Pours a light straw yellow, crystal clear with a fluffy white soapy head. Smells of cooked grains, boiled soap, hint of lemon. Grainy on the tongue, soapy, hint of lemon, and metallic. Light bodied, stale. Big adjunct taste smell and feel, also a big aluminum taste form the can, very basic standard beer, not my cup o tea."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: As far as macro-lagers and ""imported"" Adjunct Lagers go, it's not the best and it's not the worst. But I'm not sure that any beer can excel given the limited use of hops and real malts. The odd shaped can is about the only appealing thing about this beer."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden rod color with an off-white bubbly head. Scent is mostly of yeast and malts. Smooth, easy drinking with hints of grassy grains. When trying beers from countries that aren’t known for beer, I’m always skeptical but Sapporo Premium delivered a decent taste. But far as the beer spectrum goes, this is average or just above average. Essentially Japan’s better tasting version of Busch!"
""
""
"O- So it's not that interesting to drink...but it's beer and it doesn't taste bad as far as light lagers go. As far as a cheap, quaffable brew to drink in the heat goes, it's one of the best in my book. Certainly still my favorite Asian beer, and I've tried many."
"Overall, I love this beer. I keep going back for more and will keep going back for more because I thoroughly enjoy it. If you are looking for a premium beer at a good price and want to be able to drink the six pack up without getting sick of it then this is the beer for you! Good job Japan!"
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer. Heavier on the grains than I would have guessed, with an interesting mouth-filling richness. Tasty, but I'm having a hard time finding a context for it. It's too rich, and not dry or crisp enough, to be really refreshing. Goes with rice, I suppose."
""
""
"Overall: good beer, but don't expect a lot. It is comparable to other lagers and honesty it's uniqueness is why I praise it. It does hit you quick though an average ABV, this cold right after a meal is greatly appreciated. Salud."
""
""

"O: hmmm..., not sure what to say other than it does remind me a lot like AAL's (not as much flavor and lack of interesting aspects to it). I think before I go any further, I'd like to try some other Jappanese Rice Lagers."
"Overalls- It doesn't say its a light beer, but it is a light beer. I mean i can see right through it. I'm typing right now looking through this beer and it aint gunna stop me."

"The mouthfeel is light and crisp, but with that strange fullness on the finish I mentioned earlier. The drinkability is solid. Overall, this is really just the Budweiser of Japan. The can is the most outstanding part about this beer. It's not BAD, so I'm not going below a 2. It's just thoroughly below average."
"T/M: Generally inoffensive. Clean, crisp, and lightly sweet. A touch of fruit, perhaps, before the less pleasant aftertaste...distantly bitter, but in a bad way. Virtually no trace of hops. Below average, but not terrible. Would drink again, especially with food."
""
"Overall – Pretty much the Japanese answer to the American Adjunct Lager. It wasn’t bad, but it was hardly memorable. If I hadn’t taken notes I’d never remember the beer, I would have thought I just drank another American beer. I wouldn’t necessarily buy it, but I’d drink it again."

"Overall - An interesting lager by Sapporo. There are some nice different flavours in comparison with its cousin, the American adjunct lager. Beats out other adjuncts by avoiding over-the-top corn sweetness. Could see this as being a potential session candidate."
"O: For a Japanese Rice Lager, it's pretty good. Light with no off-flavors. Not too grainy and enough hop presence to balance the sweetness."
""
"More body than I expected though it is still well on the light side of medium. Carbonation is more restrained than I expected, too. Not the bitter bite of so many adjunct lagers, a decent feel and an aftertaste with some flavor of citrus from the hops. Quite watery and some alcohol presence is noted."

"Nice golden color pured on my glass. Medium white head that dissipates quickly. It has a barly malt smell with little hop presence. Taste is nice with good balance. I enjoyed this beer as any good lager. It has good aftertaste and it is refreshing. Really good."

"Tastes like a shitty American macro, wish I hadn't picked up the 22-ounce can."
"Ever notice that beers labeled as ""premium"" are almost always the exact opposite? Sapporo ""Premium"" pours from the can a golden-straw-yellow color, clear, with a fizzy white head. Aroma of grains, corn, skunk...pretty much adjunct lager. Taste is the same, grains, corn, malty sweetness, and vague yeastiness. Light body, thin, unnecessary, undrinkable. Yet strangely still better than Bud or Old E."

"i try to like this at sushi places, but this one doesnt do it for me ever. last night i had a bomber with some nice sushi down the street at john hollys. pours clear watery looking straw yellow color with a small white head. smells like grains that do actually aromatically compliment the sushi, but certainly would not be appealing in any other context. flavor is adjunct lagery, not bad and rotten metallic taste, but just sort of irrelevant really. feel is fine, bubbly and light, drinkable if you are half dead. forget this one"

"This is a much like Asahi. It tastes like a strange sweetened water, but it is very light so it would work after a large meal. But there's nothing particularly good about it."

"Pours a yellowish gold color with a thin off white head. Minimal lacing on the side of my CBS snifter. Fairly clear in appearance. The nose is fairly simple, mainly rice, grass, and weak hops. Not much to write home about here. The taste follows the same profile, with a slightly metallic flavor added to the mix. The feel is slightly under-carbonated, fizzy, and thin with a bitter finish. Overall, a decent brew for the style.... However, I probably will only drink this at Japanese steakhouses. Cheers."

"O: It's very alright amongst a sea of good and great beers. I'd call this one the Melissa Leo of beer. Look her up if you don't remember her. Off to a tried and true beer for me, and more chicken tenders. Cheers."
"Another memory of my youth bites the dust. Maybe its the setting, but I had held Sapporo and Kirin up as special ( I had not had a Japanese beer in 30 years.) and now have concluded it is a beer I will drink sparingly if at all. Maybe its the setting. If I ever get back to the bars in Shinjuku, I will happily try again."

"This beer is very light bodied. It washes over the tongue and down the throat without having time to leave any residue and has a slightly dry finish. Not unpleasant at all."

"Low alcohol contents offers a highly drinkable beer. I wouldn't drink it again, although it isn't the worst thing I've ever had."
"Final Thoughts: My first experience with this style was Asahi Super Dry, and this blows it out of the water. It's an all around good lager with a unique taste, which is what I want and expect from this style."
""
"This beer is bright clear yellow with a thin white head. The smell is thin revealing only a bit of adjunct graininess or 1 dimensional grain and a bit of spicy noble hop. The taste is also typical for an adjunct lager. The grain is thinned out by the rice leaving not much in the way of taste overall but the body is nice and light and that is a hallmark of these light lager styles. Drinkability is ok when the beer is cold and you're not caring about flavor. Overall it's not a good beer but is very much the same as all light lagers from this region although if all the beers are bad I guess that matching them is something you should want to strive for."

"Flavor has an insipid blandness of wet paper and grain husks, but there's a moderate hint of hop bitterness there too that lingers into the dry aftertaste. Crackery pilsner malts, clean and simple. A bit gaseous and thin feeling, slightly coarse astringency, it has a crisp bite. Overall nothing special, something to pair with Japanese or pan-asian cusine. On it's own it's a bit lacking in substance."

"O: not much going on, but for being in the realm of adjunct lagers, this one has a pretty clean flavor which makes for decent drinkability albeit bland"
"O- Good choice at a sushi place, otherwise don't bother."
"O: Not very impressive, but was quite enjoyable with my meal. It actually worked pretty well as a palate cleanser between types of sushi...but that doesn't say too much for the beer."
"Overall - I wasn't too pleased by this beer. This being my first rice beer (and first beer from Japan), I was expecting a different taste, but instead I got a familiar American Adjunct Lager taste. It's by no means a horrible beer, but for the most part I was disappointed by this brew"
"Clean, light, with some hop flavor. No real point in purchasing this beer when you can get a ""craft"" beer for the same price."
"The beer is light and goes down easy with a drinkable feel but really leaves something to be wanted in the taste. Paired with food maybe the flavor would balance out."
"O: Bought it because it was on sale at Von's for 6.99 a six pack. I've never been a huge fan, but I was so enamored by the reserve I had the other day I figured I'd give this a try. Sadly, about as mediocre as I remember it. Try the Sapporo Reserve. That beer is about as good as I've had from Japan."
"O - Great with asian food, easy to knock back, but very simple with little exciting characteristics"
"Overall, this is an okay lager. It's probably the best of the main Japanese macro brews. I understand why this got me into beer."
"It is what it is, and it isn't much."
"Notes: Meh, it's what you would expect. Sweet cereal/corn is strongest. Not a bad beer, just bland."
"Sapporo: I have not had a Sapporo for over 25 years. That long time ago, I was doing some field work in Japan on the southern island of Kyushu. After a long day in the field, I looked forward to the thermal baths at the ryukan where we stayed, then walking over to the beru machine, dropping in my yen coins and getting a big bottle of Sapporo for the evening. It was a special time. Fast forward to yesterday, when I was getting a quick dinner at Tokyo Joe’s. The marketing guys have done a good job; I could not resist the cold bottle of Sapporo on display as I placed my order. Despite the plastic cup, the Sapporo was a light straw color, with active carbonation, pure white head and subtle sweet aroma. The flavor was what I remember, very clean with a light sweetness and faint hop finish. I love this beer for the memories it brings back to me. Despite all of the wonderful IPA’s and Hefewiezens that are out there, there is a place for a great light beer such as Sapporo."
"Overall: Its a typical macro-brew flavored beer. Not terrible and its cripsness makes it easy to consume."
"Overall: Not a half bad beer. Nothing exciting but not offensive either. Could work in a pinch."
"O: I think something was wrong with the keg, maybe it was old, but I barely could choke this one down and as I pointed out I had already been drinking so it was a BAD, BAD beer. I would have sent it back, save the fact it was late and the bartender was already an unhelpful ass to me after I tried to figure out what craft-like beers they had on tap."
"O - A refreshing thirst quencher but nothing else. The best thing about it is the big heavy metallic can shaped like a weizen glass, but I won't be sucked in by that again."
"O- Maybe I'm being a little harsh. Nah, not really. This beer is low quality and completely uninspiring. It isn't all that horrible, it's just too mediocre for me to even give it an average rating. Boring."
"Cheers!"
"Drink- For what this is it isn’t that bad. Alone with a food balance it was a bit tough to take down but as the food flavors come through it makes for a much better beer. Still slightly below if not/average at best."
"Overall not bad, but not great, yet enjoyable."
"O: Overall it's a drinkable, but not great beer. I guess it's ok for it's purpose of being a light beer that will in no way overcome the flavors of the food you're eating (if having it with sushi, as I did) I would probably drink it again as a mindless beer I don't have to think about, and I would definitely grab it before ever thinking of touching Bud or Coors."
"O: The only reason to buy a Sapporo is the awesome nigh-indestructible can it comes in. It loses something in the bottle or the glass."
"This was pretty good for the style, not something I would drink regularly though."
"Not a bad beer, but nothing special."
"O- This was a very light refreshing beer. Would be great on a hot day. I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys a good lager."
"O/D-All I will say is that it did not suck as bad I was expecting."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the surprising hop flavoring right off the bat. This was totally unexpected considering the bitterness of the nose, and actually helped to set things up nicely. The grains were not of the most robust quality, so this lost the beer points, but in the end this was rather refreshing for the style."
"O – A lager with more bitterness than I expected it's refreshing but I still have no reason to seek it out, enjoyed the crisp/dryness after coming in from yard work on a very hot Denver day 3"
"Overall: pretty tasty, although it's more expensive than mass-produced American beers, since it's imported from Japan. I will probably order a pint of this with sushi or pick up a six-pack before going to a house party."
"Taste is rice/grain and but nothing special. There is a minor aftertaste. Unremarkable mouthfeel. Average beer that is ok for a Japanese restaurant but not much else."
"Really not bad compared to the light lagers of today. Maybe it was nice and fresh (more hops than I imagined) and I got lucky with it, not a bad beer at all."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with a big fluffy head that falls quickly, but sticks a fair amount of sticky lace on the sides. Smells lightly of grainy malts, maybe some earthy floral hops. Uninspiring nose puts it mildly. Taste is grainy and slightly sweet, hints of tartness in there somehow with an astringent finish. Crisp carbonation, thin body and a watery mouthfeel. Well that's not all that tasty. Its a thin bodied macro lager with almost no redeeming qualities, one and done for this one."
"Beyond the beer can that doubles as a car axle, there’s nothing “premium” here."
"O: I typically get Sapporo when I want a beer but don't want to spend for a 22 of something decent. It's not terrible by any means. I'd drink it over any BMC any day, and probably before a lot of other brews too. That said, any store carrying Sapporo will most likely have something better (or much better) in stock, for only a few dollars more. Get it if you want a lightish beer without complexity, or if you're throwing a party and you want something cool to serve, but something that won't offend partygoer's taste buds."
"O - I suppose this style of beer inst up my alley. It seems factually its lacking, whereas most good beer should have some body and/or flavor. Reminiscent of a Kolsch."
"Really just a much more refined Busch. Not a horrible beer, but it just doesn't do anything for me. Why pay the premium price tag for an average brew. Although the can is arguably the best part..."
"Pours a super clear light yellow with a 1 inch white head that fades to a thin film. Random thin broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smells of rice, some light fruit notes, and a bit of skunk. Taste is rice/grain and some light fruity flavors. There is an almost citrusy aftertaste after each sip. This beer has a decent level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is a staple at all the sushi places I frequent. Pretty good at washing my sushi down."
"O: decent beer, better beer than many import and domestic adjuncts."
"This style is yet another on my quest to review every style. This beer pours a bright and very clear gold in color with a two finger poofy white head. It looks refreshing. It smells of pale, bready malts with the lighest bitterness. There isn't much. The flavor consists of sweet pale malts, light bread, and a lemongrass aspect that I kind of like. It finishes with a light sweetness. It's hitting the spot after a long day like today. It's light in body and very crisp and drinkable. It's pretty refreshing. I would never want to drink this out of a bottle but out of a can, it's not bad."
"A nice light beer that went very well with spicy tuna & eel sushi I had at Miyake Resturant in Ithaca, NY. The very light yellow color and large head tells you the amount of carbonation to anticipate when drinking this beer. The light beer aroma matches the light taste, and the effervescence cleans the pallette for what you're eating."
"Not special about the mouthfell - its quite dry, very carbonated, and goes down pretty easy. Overall, I'm only drinking this again if someone offers it to me."
"I'll admit I'm not well-experienced with rice lagers but this was a pretty good beer, and certainly a step above your average macro. As a relatively light, clean-tasting lager with very little adjunct nastiness, Sapporo Premium fits the bill. I could see myself getting this again, but it would never be a staple."
"Pours a light straw color. Head is white and disappears in a couple minutes leaving no lacing. Carbonation is evident. Large amount of corn in the nose with some rice undertones. This one is a bit skunky as well. Very grainy though. Sweet corn taste with a metallic twang. Not too good, but not terrible. Light bodied and medium carbonation make for a neutral mouth feel. A forgettable beer. I will not be having this beer again anytime soon."
"drinking with some vietnamese pho."
"Had this tonight at dinner because it was the best they had. Light color, not much head. Expected more carbonation than there was. Tasted a little bit of wheat. The best part was the finish and the surprising taste of honey at the end. I enjoyed this part. This would be better IMO if it had more carbonation. Pretty average beer but the honey flavor was something i enjoyed. I would drink this again if the timing was right."
"I have liked other Japanese beers as an occasional quaff, but this one seems lacking. No malt flavor to speak of. Brewed in Guelph, Ontario."
"Big pale simple lager in the appearance. Same in the smell. Pretty bland, adjunct style pale. Taste is not complex, neither hoppy nor malty. Nothing too bad in the mouthfeel. Goes down easy. Not really a good value, just an upsold adjunct in the US now."
"If it was bought for me I'd drink it, but nevermore will I seek out that great-looking can... Another memory of my teenage years, gone!"
"O - poor mouthfeel, but honestly, the flavor isn't horrible"
"The beer is a very pale yellow and crystal clear, the head is thin white and bubbly. Smell conists of grass, lemon, skunk and grains. Taste is mostly grassy with a bready aftertaste. The liquid is very light with some prickly carbonation. This is a pretty typical light lager, but it has more flavor than your American macros."
"I'd put this just a couple of pegs above BMC. It has a pleasant taste, but it didn't wow me. I think I will stick with my IPAs and stouts."
"D- Its not hard to drink, but after trying it I would take a Bud Light over this given an option. Its bland and plain."
"D - this just isn't good. A bad beer, for sure."
"Overall this is a good drinking beer I will re-invite again."
"Color is clear, light yellow. It has almost no head, but nice white lacing. Smell reminds me of bud light, and nothing more memorable than that. The taste is clean and smooth, surprisingly kolsh-like, not just another light beer. Still a very plain-jane offering."
"Poured a clear, golden color.. whitish head ringed up. Smell is malty and a bit husky. Taste was clean and grainy, not a whole lot of hop profile. Mouthfeel was good, beer finished smooth and satisfactory. Overall, I'd say this was a slightly above average average beer, but I'd drink another a similar situation."
"Overall: interesting... can see the appeal to some but really not anything I would drink regularly"
"D- A standard lager. Maybe a touch better than standard American lagers but not much."
"D: The beer is very drinkable, although there's nothing interesting about the taste that would make me want to try another."
"the cpJ"
"Dr: It's affordable. That's about as much good as I can say about it."
"Drinkability: I would drink it. It's a good palate cleansing beer. It pairs well with seafood. Sapporo isnt a spectacular beer but it does have it's place."
"This is a pretty tasteless beer in so many ways. Super drinkable I guess because of the lightness. I could drink this at the beach or something maybe. I'll take it over a light macro."
"D: Actually not a bad drinking beer. The thing about lagers of this style is that you know what you're in for when you buy them, and this one exceeded my, albeit low, expectations. I guess the best thing to say about this beer is that it's not very offensive."
"Drinkability: I rated this to style. If I was not, take off .5 on each level at least. That said, this is a step up from most American adjunct lagers. A bit sweeter, very clean, and surprisingly decent. Not the first thing I would reach for, but certainly sessionable on a hot day."
"Consumed at a Japanese restaurant because, well, I was in a Japanese restaurant. Poured a clear, light yellow, with a bit of a white head. Did not see much lacing or stick. Smelled, well, it did not really have to much of a scent, maybe some muted, unidentifiable grains. Tasted like it looked and smelled, tasteless and thin, muted grains. Drinkable? Yes but why would you want to?"
"D- Totally sessionable, enough taste to pair with whatever your eating and not clash or to quaff on its own."
"Overall, I will drink this again at Asian restaurants."
"Pours a clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice fluffy two-finger white head, with lots of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some rice notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, ricy. Light-Medium body. Not Drinkable, better than most American Macros, but still would be hard to drink a couple of these."
"Unusual aroma: sweet, floral and delicate but reminiscent of sake? (I later find that this is a ""rice lager""). Not to be mistaken for an AB brew that uses rice for economical reasons, this Japanese lager is a more refined and distinct, if delicately-flavored brew. Some bitterness in finish. Probably best as an accompaniment to mildly flavored foods."
"Basically another weak, light, and watery adjunct lager, with nothing to distance itself from the competition (except maybe the neat silver steel-looking cans)."
"D: For the most part, there isn't anything offensive in this beer. It would be a highly drinkable beer, however at 2.69 a pop for the 22 oz version of this, I could easily get something from Sam Adams and at least then I'd feel I was drinking something. It feels like it would be an easy session brew, but seeing as how it has a craft cost...not an easy sell."
"D: I have often paired this brew with sushi, as it's often the best beer option on the menu at a Japanese restaurant."
"From there, the flavor is pretty bland. Some grainy malt and a touch of sweetness. That's it. The feel is light and crisp. For what it is, not too bad at all. Drinks well enough, though I wouldn't want to drink very much of this and won't be going back to it."
"Pours a pale yellow color, light-bodied and with a very sparse, white head. I first noticed it had the distinctive ""adjunct lager"" smell, which I don't enjoy. Has a moderate amount of carbonation, looks just like a BMC lager. Taste is average, nothing special. I noticed a slight rice taste, bit of malts and low bitterness (as most lagers are). Would be highly drinkable, I just don't enjoy it. Sapporo isn't a bad beer, but to me it's not worth paying $8 for a six-pack when I can get better beers for the same price or pay $5 for a six-pack of High Life. The only Asian beer I would choose is Tsingtao, but only because I prefer the taste."
"One finger head of foam that evaporated in seconds leaving a thin layer of clinging lace. Color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is that of rice, go figure. Taste is a mellow blend of rice and light hop flavor. Much like soda water feeling in my mouth. Not a bad flavor, but not enough flavor. I will not buy another, but will not be rude, if I am offered one at a gathering."
"D: Well not a huge surprise here. It's a rice lager. Nuff said."
"Very clear looking liquid. Taste almost exactly the same as Coor Light (which I happen upon as my first light beer, nothing bad about it at first but I wanted something different after awhile). Tap the rockies! I could settle for this beer as a first time beer drinker. This Jap beer would attract the newbies to lockful tasty strong coffee types of brewery, I think...but maybe after a year or so of this stuff. And as a result of drinking this stuff, I would not be hesitant to try beers in Japan. Compare to steele reserve...which I also can down. Like a champ. Haha"
"D - I don't know much about Japanese beers, but if I'm eating sushi this is what I'm drinking."
"Not a whole lot of head, but more so than most Asian beers. Pours a traditional yellow, the color is the same as every other Asian beer. Smells and tastes like grass, light hops, not a lot of grain or wheat happening. I enjoyed it, but it's not a favorite. I'll drink it again though."
"had this at jade in orlando..not much to order so i tried this one..poured a classic yellow color with a fresh head crystal clear..smell was grass and lemon and biscuit..taste was grass and slight hop with lemon and hay with some malt..mouth feel was crisp and and carbonated just not alot of flavor..i will say that i drank it very fast as it went well with the salty spicy oriental food..not a bad lager it is what it is so i guess that its a good rep of the style"
"I had this beer while at a sushi place. It poured a yellow color, almost straw like. The head was white, and stayed with the beer for awhile. It smells almost grassy or hay like, like a light lager that is foreign. The taste is sweeter than most lagers I have had from the states. Mouthfeel is light, and is a very drinkable beer."
"Sapporo Premium Beer has a light straw colour and a head that fades quickly into light lacing. The smell is grainy with some slight hoppiness. The flavour starts with some sourness to begin with and finishes with graininess. The mouthfeel is watery with a little carbonation."
"This beer pours a light golden color with very little head to talk about. The smell is lots of puffed rice and general stank, but it's not horrifying to the nose. The taste is of sweet rice and it's an odd flavor more akin to a Sake than a beer, but it's not bad. This beer is watery and bitter on the palate and isn't really that good to drink. If you like Sake I say go for it, if you don't then dear God don't go anywhere near this beer."
"Can't say I'd drink much of this. Like I said I am only drinking this to get it out of my fridge. Overall not a terrible beer. Probably my second favorite ""japanese"" beer, after Yebisu."
"on tap - I really like this beer. Decently bittered, and distinctly pilsner-malty. Clean and crisp this beer is very refreshing, and is a cut above the usual run of the mill light lagers. It's far, far, far better than the canned version which is thoroughly mediocre"
"its not that this beer tastes bad it just tastes like nothing at all, for a cheap thirst quencher perhaps but not much else"
"D: Not really that good... I guess it was more interesting than a water. Maybe not a water with Lemon though..."
"cheers"
"Drinkability - Could easily down a few during a football game, but why bother? Just get case of coors light and save your money."
"D= Easy to drink I probably wouldn't buy this beer just to sit down and have a few but when I paired it with sushi I can enjoy it for what it is."
"D: If it's ice cold, this one's not bad for what it is. As it warms up, however, some ""off"" flavors (and scents) show up and make it a bit of a chore to drink. My advice? If someone gives you this as a gift (that's how I got the bottle), keep it in the fridge, mow the lawn on a hot day, and then put it in the freezer for 10 minutes or so. Pour into a pilsner glass and chug."
"Really the only nice thing about this beer is the cool uniquely shaped and classy can."
"This beer has been a saving grace at many a sushi restaurant, in comparison with the other usual offerings. Moderately crisp with a rather full malt middle and a slightly astringent finish. Does a nice job of cutting wasabi heat and fatty tuna. As an independent beverage, however, it has little by which to distinguish itself, other than a really cool can."
"While certainly drinkable, I wouldn't want any more than one of these big cans. I guess it goes well enough with the Asian food you're likely to be consuming it along with, since it's unfortunately the beer-list highlight of a good many such restaurants."
"Overall, this beer dissapoints, as it could be so much more. Rice-based lagers are an unfortunate result of lack of resources and never seem to quite match the pure barley-malt offerings in quality. I find it can also vary in quality from can to can, which did not seem to be a problem in the not-too-distant past."
"Straw gold in colour. Pillowy white head shows decent retention and leaves the occasional patch of lace. Light grain and grass aroma. Grainy, musty flavour. Hopping is very muted and indistinct, giving it a the barest touch of bitterness. Appropriately light for the style, but I find the carbonation prickly and aggressive. This is actually pretty palate cleansing stuff, for what it's worth. If given a choice between the two, I would rather drink Asahi Super Dry at a sushi joint. It's just as palate cleansing and mild, but lacks the unpleasant mustiness of the Sapporo."
"It's got a golden color, heavy carbonation, and I believe this style's called ""Pilsner"". A bit sweeter than Bud, but nothing special. It's good to know what it tastes like though, I've been able to recommend this beer to my father when going to Japanese restaurants, since he's strictly a Bud man."
"This is basically a generic American beer, with a bit more quality and crispness. Tastes like grain and alcohol. Nothing special, but they get a + for presentation. The giant can is pretty cool. I enjoy this beer when at Asian restaurants - this or an Asahi."
"It's good to quench your thirst when you're parched. If you're looking for a beer to sit and enjoy, you better look elsewhere because this is one beer that will disappoint in the flavor dept."
"This beer is the most refreshing of beers. Everything a light beer should be but isn't."
"Drink - I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about with this beer. It's fine, but I'd much rather have a lower priced TsingTao."
"Thinner bodied, but appropriately light. Helps in the drinkability, and it needs it. A food washer at best, not even really that great for hot weather beer. A lightly flavored beverage that won't get in the way of food. Offers little, gives little. Eh. Not horrid or off-flavored, just lacking."
"D- Full marks here! This is very easy to drink, as it is flavorfull enough to want more, doesn't scrub the palate with bubbles, and is a clean, crisp beer to enjoy on the deck, as I did for this review. Anyone who like BMC should try this and I'll bet will find it much more enjoyable."
"D - Typical lager sessionability if you're into that kinda thing. Not exciting enough to want another."
"Drinkability: as I said, it's not awful, and it's light and refreshing. I'll call this fairly drinkable."
"D. I could sip these back all day."
"nb: this was brewed in Japan. Never, ever, ever buy a Japanese beer brewed in North America. I've never had a good one."
"D: Not bad. A light beer to drink very cold when it's very hot :)"
"I poured this from a 22oz can into a heavy glass mug I had in the freezer. Color and smell nothing special. The head was massive, but dies quickly (freezing the glass seems to do this for most beers). The taste is nothing special, but it does taste good. This is a minor cut above most macro lagers. There is a fullness to the mouthfeel and up front nothing bad can be said about the flavor, but it does get better when and after you swallow it, expanding into a pleasant richness going down with flavors of slight orange rind, and a light honey-ish sweetness with hint of spiciness or ""kick."" It's not a world class or exceptional beer in any way, but it is a good, solidly built beer that does not let me down."
"Not the worst, but certainly not the best. Meh."
"Not too bad for a macro, I've had (much) worse."
"Drinkability: Nice easy drinking lager, but nothing special."
"Although in essence Japanese Rice Lagers are designed from an industrial standpoint to be cheaper and more efficient beers to make, the better ones do still make fairly decent quaffs. Sapporo would not be my first choice for the style, much less for a lager in general, but it fairs better than many of its country's other, less agreeable examples."
"D: On its own its good enough, but with food it shines. Sapporo Premium must be among the best-known (and best, perhaps?) versions of a style that is much-maligned for it's use of adjuncts and such. No worries, its still super-drinkable."
"Crystal clear, deep yellow in colour. Fine white bubbles formed a thin coat on top of the beer and left a bit of clingy lace at the top of the glass. Moderate head retention. Mild aroma, crackery grain, a bit of marshmallow, light floral and fruit character, very clean. Low bitterness, mild grain and light fruity flavours, finished very dry with a hint of spicy hops. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, crisp and clean. Very easy drinking without any off flavours. Quite refreshing. A solid example of the style."
"D- A cold one or three on a hot day would be pretty good."
"Overall: Sapporo is the second Asian beer I've tried and I definitely notice some similarities to Tsingtao. A decent smooth beer that goes wonderfully with sushi."
"Overall I'd conclude this beer isn't all that great. I enjoy having Sapporo with sushi, but on it's own it is a fairly mediocre beer. There are better beers out there for your dollar."
"Bought this brew as i havnt had it for ages anyway it pours a pale straw hue with decent carbonation that leaves a frothy two finger head and some clingy lacing but to be honest it looks very macro,and it has a pretty average smell too with feint aromas of rice,grain and some grassy hops and there is not much love with this one on smell and taste is pretty much the same its pretty easy to down but so is water and its lacklustre feint tastes of rice,grain and some grassy hops dont really cut it for me and to be honest i remember this brew being a little better but maybe i was wrong and its definately dissapointing i wont be revisiting this brew anytime soon after this one thats for sure."
"D. It's not interesting, but the low alcohol means that you could easily put away a six pack.. if you really wanted to."
"The body is crisp, refreshing, and smooth on the finish. Great for a lager. Mild grainy flavors, rice I guess, some buttery bread, and a kiss of sweetness on the backend. It's not too different from the cheap American lagers, but I found it just a tad more flavorful. Refreshing. I could quench my thirst after a day in the yard with this offering. Not bad."
"Overall, it was nice to try something light and crisp at lunch and something a little different that did accompany my Mongolian Beef lunch dish nicely."
"The feel is light and carb is at a even pace, not bitey, easy drinking here. It comes and goes just as quick, in and out, no lingering flavors here. I would not call this refreshing more like quenching. This is not bad beer, it's not superior either, it is just what it is, simple beer."
"Value: Slightly overpriced, although I only paid $1.29 for a single bottle, so I can't complain here."
"D - easy drinking, forementioned rice quality is a major factor(also notice this quality in bud, though in that case its the only quality)"
"D: Like many lagers, this beer shines in it's ability to be downed. Very easy to drink, and not unpleasant at all. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, but it's better than a lot of other macros. Overall, it is refreshing, and that's what counts."
"better than bud, coors, etc...by a good long shot. miller might beat it..."
"d- nice drinkability. this is my first rice lager, it's very light, not really packing a whole lot of flavor here, but it went down very easily. i paired this with some tasty lo mein, it complimented it well."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkablility is above average, I think it would go great with any Asian cuisine."
"Well I think the can helps the appearance a bit, but its just a straw/pale yellow beer, with a small, fizzy white head with no retention or lacing. Aroma was extremely faint, mostly of pale malts, maybe even a touch of honey at the end. Taste is similar to the aroma, not much there. Light bodied, high carbonation, it just feels like carbonated water. As for the drinkability, well, I finished the can, but would definitely not get another."
"Aroma and taste are pretty typical for this style; Malty and macro tasting, lacking crispness, with a slight fruity potting soil nose. Eh, not worth it, might as well have a Bud."
"Pours a clear pale gold/yellow hue. Scarcely any head. Smells of grainy adjunct sweetness with some skunk mixed in for good measure. Just a grassy, grainy, metallic taste conglomeration. Carbonation is pretty biting, which actually helps this beer go down easier for me. It's not horrible, but I'd never belly up and order one on purpose."
"Straw yellow color with a large foamy head which fades away quickly. The smell is somewhat generic. Some hops and grain, nothing special. the taste is also nothing special, hops and grain, and an unpleasant bitterness. Also has a metallic aftertaste. This is a beer which should only be consumed cold. Letting this beer warm does not flatter it. Overall, not impressive."
"D-not too bad, don't smell it though. Basically a Japanese adjunct that can go down the throat."
"I love it! Really good beer. The appearance is golden with a lace that sticks to the glass. The smell is light but nice with a smell of grain and a light hint of hops. The taste is great with noticable hop taste. The mouth feel is smooth and helps it finish to a nice clean crisp refreshing beer!!"
"Crisp and dry with a touch of spicy hop flavor and malty graininess. Quite refreshing with more character than American adjunct lagers, which keeps it interesting enough to have several. Not much else to be said. It's great for washing down greasy fried rice and is a nice counterpoint to the delicate flavors of sushi."
"The beer is balanced, which is good. The taste of adjunct not as good."
"The body and drinkability were what you'd expect from a light lager of this style. Overall, not a bad beer, I might not seek it out again, but I wouldn't turn one down either."
"Happy One Year Anniversary to Me!"
"**I actually just went to smell this again and accidentally sniffed it into my nose, OMG the rice smell is now super apparent and lingering, haha."
"M/D: Easy and refreshing to drink, but not overly enjoyable. Finishes smooth."
"Poured from a bottle into a small glass. Pale yellow, little head. Smell was somewhat faint, but what was there was some hops and some light grain (i.e. rice). Taste was okay, nothing special. Just light floral hops and rice. A bit watery overall. Went ok with the Korean food I had, but I wouldn't be going out to get a pack of this ever."
"Look: Yellow bright, fat foamy head with extended duration, looks good but it's very difficult to open the can; Smell: Fresh, sweet malt, corn and possibly rice; Taste: Plenty of rice and grains; Mouthfeel: Dry, medium bitterness with a sour finish, not offensive; Drinkability: I liked with my meal but i had some trouble opening the can."
"D: Would likely never purchase, but it does pretty well cutting through wasabi and eel sauce from a maki roll plate. An average tasting lager and the rice only adds dryness and cleansing qualities to the brew and offers nothing in the way of taste for me."
"Stopped at the market for sushi and stir fry so I saw this Sapporo and said hey, this has to go with it. So let's give it a whirl. For starters the can is a good start towards appearance, it is unique and sensually shaped and a bright silver. Popping the top this brew smells like a typical adjunct but more so even so being made from rice that's spot on. It pours to a bright yellow with a nice foamy head that holds up well. Taste is very neutral niether sweet nor bitter. Good body and not watery at all, but really no backbone. Kind of a run of the mill adjunct flavor. This goes good with the food though, but without a doubt not at all a standout. It would pair up good with a spicy Thai food."
"12 oz brown bottle to glass. Pours a light golden, looks like Bud. Smell is a typical light lager, fairly fresh though. A bit sweeter than typical BMC but that's the closest reference I can think of, actually not bad for the style. Good drinkability but wouldn't be able to pick this out of a lineup of macros."
"D: This complements the sushi I was eating well as it did not overpower the delicate balance of flavors characteristic of Japanese food. However, as a standalone beer it is a fairly mainstream lager and not impressive at all."
"Cheers!"
"I am impressed with the bitterness given how light this beer is. Better than a BMC, but all around pretty bad beer."
"D: I'd rank this one a step above most American macros, which are generally your alternatives at restaurants where you'll find Sapporo. It's bland, but unlike the alternatives, I find it completely inoffensive, and is not an unpleasant way to wash down Vietnamese noodles."
"No mouthfeel, drinkable yeah, so long as you aren't opposed to 'no taste'."
"Overall: Maybe this could be a beer for your guests who swear by the beers that they see on commercials during football games - perhaps served with Japanese cuisine. Actually, just save some money and buy an American Macro Lager. Or better still, offer something with flavor and let's your friends bring the 30-packs if they'd like :-D"
"I was very pleasantly surprised at the depth of flavor. I was expecting a BMC, but this beer has a lot more character."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was yellow pretty normal looking with a thin unimpressive head. The smell was slightly bready. slightly skunky but not too bad. The head was gone fasr. The beer did have a clean taste though and was quite good. I will buyy again."
"D: easily drinkable, like water almost 22oz can will be bought again"
"Drink is not all that bad. It seems to be similar to our Budweiser or Miller Lite but is a little bit tastier than those IMO."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a small head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing. The appearance is straw yellow and clear. The aroma is slightly hopped with some sweet grains. The taste is slight and slightly sweet with little or no bitterness. The feel is light bodied with a clean finish. A very drinkable beer."
"Beer is slightly sweet, low bodied, no aftertaste. Some cereal tastes, disconnected palate flavors. Not enough bitterness. Drinkability is like water. Mouthfeel is fine. Not much to say but its fine to mediocre."
"d: Nothing offensive or interesting."
"Drinkability: Pretty bland. Tastes like a weaker version of an American macro lager. I would only drink this with Japanese food."
"Overall: This is the first rice lager I have had, so I am not sure what the style is supposed to be like, but from my reading it seems similar to Adjunct lagers and Euro Pale lagers, so I reviewed it with both of those styles in the back of my mind."
"D - Not a bad adjunct lager. There is a fairly strong malt profile and it even has some malt richness and herbal hops that are reminiscent of a real pilsner. The finish is not as smooth as it could be, but I let this warm up a bit, and if it were consumed at the near freezing temperatures the brewers intended it would probably seem pretty clean. Pretty good for what it is, and much more enjoyable that most industrial light lagers."
"Overall this beer does not impress to the standard of a ""premium beer"" as labeled."
"Overall - Not a beer I'd go out of my way to drink on a regular basis, but an excellent choice to pair up with Teriyaki or Sushi, which this beer goes quite well with. Also a definite step up from BMC stuff."
"D: This is, of course, a very drinkable beer. That is what it is designed to be. I'm not really a fan of the style nor a huge fan of the beer in particular, but it's okay to drink one or two with a Japanese meal."
"A pretty decent lawnmower beer. Nothing offensive, but also nothing really notable."
"Sapporo Premium pours pale, pale yellow (thanks to the rice) in a pilsner glass. Very semi-dry and light, easy to drink with pretty much anything from chips, to sushi, to cheese burgers. The usual default beer at most Japanese restuarants. No harm, no foul with this beer. For all palates...."
"D: Very high. I don't know where it'll get you, but it's just like drinking water. Low carbonation and everything."
"Drinkability- ok, probably wouldnt drink it again, won't buy it again, would possibly drink it at a japanese restaurant but that's it"
"this beer is highly drinkable a good alternative to macro lagers"
"Not too bad. marked down for the Canadian thing though."
"Pours a totally transparent diluted yellow with a clean white pillowy head that dissipates quickly and leaves a bit of lace behind. Smells like a lager, end of story. Some sweetness on the nose coupled with rice notes. Tastes the same: a sweet aftertaste that lingers (I'm kind of begging for some sushi right now. Why would I buy this for home??? Can't figure it out..) Mouthfeel is solid, though. Drinkability is great as well. I couldn't dream up a better beer (aside from asahi, which I prefer) to drink with a great japanese meal."
"drinkability is great. a light lager with a solid freshness and a profile that is pleasant on the palate. for a brew this light, the profile is pretty well put together, though the rice added does apparently little to the finished product. otherwise this is a solid light lager. cheers!"
"Pours a pale straw color with a near two finger head which gives way to some decent lacing. The smell is of a corn and rice backbone with a little hint of some sweet malt. The overall taste is of rice there is a bitter bite but it is not from hops, its a crisp bite. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation and is very crisp. Overall you could drink these all day, but with there just not being a lot of taste or complexity you might not want to."
"D- Lawnmower beer, not horrible, have had worse, prefer not to drink it...but alright for what it is."
"It cannot be recommended , however if nothing else is available then its drinkable"
"A pale yellow pour with almost no head at all , very little carbonation . Aroma of euro hops and adjuncts , corn or rice, slight grain note . Flavor is lightly hoppy with very little else , malt is nonexistant , watery mouthfeel , thin body . Crisp and refreshing, sessionable ( i guess) . Nothing special at all."
"D - Depending on the day this could be one of the most drinkable beers to me. I have a soft spot in my heart for this as it was one of my early faves, but it is still highly drinkable and fits the style IMO."
"The can makes for more of a conversation than the actual beer. If your eating Sushi and looking to stay ""local"" with your choice of beer I could understand drinking this. Beyond that I wouldn't seek this stuff out."
"Drinkability is good, because it has a lower ABV and a crisp character. It could make a good session beer, if you like your beer on the sweet malt side."
"Honestly, I expected something so much more exciting from a beer that is brewed since 1876 on the other side of the world. I'm sure the land of the rising sun has much better to offer than this below average brew. If you are looking for a unique Asian flavor, look elsewhere."
"D: Average, comparable to american light beers at best"
"D: if these didn't cost so much i would buy them all the time"
"The beer poured a light clear yellow with a small head that didn't last long and some visible carbonation. The smell was sweet malt with just a touch of hops. Whatever hops were in the smell didn't seem to translate well into the taste, and it was basically all sweet malt that lingered a bit. Mouthfeel was a bit watery but with some good carbonation to keep it crisp and it is a pretty drinkable beer. Nothing outstanding, but you could get a worse beer to go with your sushi."
"My two biggest factors in drinkability (and buying this beer again) are how the beer pairs with food and bang for the buck. This beer went great with the Asian food I ate, but at the same time, just about any run-of-the-mill lager would have done almost as well. I think I paid $3.50, which I think is a standard price for the beer... what a ripoff! I'd much rather get a 12-pack of my local Full Sail Session for $9. Try this if you're curious, but I just can't give it a good recommendation because of the price."
"The appearance is good enough (I actually find that rice lagers tend to look quite appetising), and its shiny gold body, and foamy white head score good marks, and bonus point for the rings of lace. From here on in, we're all generic, and you may as well be drinking budweiser. No scrub that, this isn't as bad as that rice lager, and at least it has a redeeming crispness to its finish. Aroma and taste is all pale malts and metallic hops, which abruptly disappear moments after sipping. The body is lagerish - light and perhaps overcarbonated, but really we're par for the course. Drinkability is okay. Heck, at the wedding we attended I drank way more of this than i thought possible. Still its no match for a good shochu, sake, or most other beers for that matter."
"I don't know why people feel the need to hate on a perfectly tasty and drinkable beer. Just because it's easy going doesn't make it bad. If your looking for a good beer to take away the heat from a spicy dish. Or just something new, Try Sapporo."
"Overall, it's fine for drinkability because there isn't much to it, but it's just pretty boring. The taste profile is pretty barren and I""m not impressed."
"D: I'd never pay for this. It was a good BBQ beer to wash down what I was eating, but I'm never going to seek it out on my own."
"Easy & washed down the food just fine. Not as good as Baltika Light as far as my go to for cleanliness/being refreshing goes though."
"D: Easy drinker, simply because it doesn't taste like anything, a little too much on the sweet side for me to really enjoy. I don't think I'll be getting this again."
"Drinkability - Never again..."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a golden color with a small head. Slight grainy aroma. Not much flavor in this beer. Taste is weak and finishes very dry. A fairly drinkable beer. O.k. in a pinch but overall this is a very mediocore beer."
"i dont know why this beer gets a C rating because in a blind taste test with some pils i think this beer would stand stong"
"It's decently refreshing, fairly bland but there's more there than a standard North American adjunct lager. Nice weighty can."
"I always thought Sapporo was the most distinctive of the big Japanese 3 - I'm not sure if it has more rice in it, but it tastes that way. At any rate, poured from the signature Giant Silver Can, it's a light straw with a giant foam head that starts to fade fast but then sticks around for a few minutes, leaving a lot on the sides. Not much smell to speak of. Somewhat distinctive taste as I mentioned earlier, although it's clearly a light colored lager - no new ground broken. It goes down very smooth, and has a bit of an aftertaste that sticks around for a while. Could very very dangerous in those big cans that seems to appear so quickly at Karaoke bars... but I digress. Sapporo's been in my lager rotation for a while, and is probably going to stay there."
"A fairly refreshing, quotidian lager, if you turn your attention to the burgeoning spring sunshine on this fine people-watching patio, and not to the cracks in the foundation of this offering. Not overly flavorful, but I can see how it will get the local crowds, all fired up on pint specials and other Canadian macro swill."
"I could drink a few of these, but I don't think I would."
"Drinkability: I'm impressed. This is a great, smooth drinking lager."
"This beer pours a clear straw yellow color. Thin white lace for a head, merely a coating on top of the beer, no lacing to speak of. Nose is of grains, and some grassiness. It's really a pretty neutral nose. The beer is clean tasting. There is that jumps out or dominates. Some sweet grainy flavors, grass and rice. Minimal hop presence on the finish. Highly carbonated, very light bodied. It's very drinkable, but there are betters out there."
"D: Not very impressive but somewhat decent. Sapporo is a good compliment to Japanese food, but is a questionable treat on its own."
"I had this beer in a Tampa restaurant called Ciccio's. I'd go back to the restaurant anytime. Not sure about having this beer again. Not that it was bad, it just reminded me too much of a macro lager. The beer was a pale yellow color with a thin white head. A little malt in the aroma, and a little malt in the taste, also a bit of hops (a very little bit). It drank easily, and went well with my noodle bowl."
"Notes: Botanical Garden in Brooklyn and paired with a burger. It did the job in 85 degree heat and did not offend me. I remember saying it was a simple beer and it was just average."
"D: This is my go-to beer for pairing with Japanese food and sushi. Light and simple, the flavors are not dominant enough to drown out the subtleties of sushi, but the effervescence cleanses the palate like a piece of pickled ginger. But, while I've had this beer a hundred time before, I virtually never drink it on its own for these same reasons - there's not much flavor and its over carbonated."
"Decent enough taste - not the most flavorful beer in the world, but on an 88 degree April day, it hit the spot. I could have had a few."
"Brisk, lively carbonation, light bodied."
"First of all, before I start, what is up with the can? The indestructable can! That thing is heavy when empty and dense as steel! Anyways pours with fluffy, rocky head. Golden yellow with minimal retention/lacing. Smell was somewhat yeasty but mostly cereal like with a touch of sweet. Taste actually had some citrus to it, some bread, some grass. Kinda like if you took a Belgian Pale and watered it down. Wasnt terrible though for a macro lager. Mouthfeel was light and watery, a crispness to it due to the high carbonation. Overall not bad but I think I'd take a Bud Light over this any day...I'd take this over a High Life or Corona."
"While not good, it's certainly not bad. It's worth a try as it's better than alot of BMC stuff."
"Pours a light yellow colored body, with a small white colored head. Has a malty aroma, but not very strong. Some alcohol taste, and some malts. Not nutty, but kinda biting, almost acidic. Malty taste. Less biting as it warms up."
"It reminded me of Corona, not good at all, please save your money folks. Not recommended!"
"From a bottle into a pint glass. No date or anything on the bottle. Poors yellowish or straw looking color. No real head, although it had a nice little delicate lacing and a thin head/foam all the way down. It looked heavily carbonated. It had the faint aroma of grains and/or grass along with corn(?). No hops detected. Taste is very thin. Very light bodied. Slight taste of grain is evident along with a corn like taste. Heavily carbonated and light in the mouth. No bitterness at all. The taste is very faint, thin and really lacking. Hardly an aftertaste at all. As a result, it is easy to drink and is a rather boring brew."
"M/D - Light and crisp. Goes down easy but the taste just doesnt do it for me at all. If I was heading this direction in a beer I would just as soon grab the old Silver Bullet."
"Drinkability - it's not bad. I'm glad to have tried this brew, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have again."
"Taste was bitter with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall the drinkability was average I suppose. Not something I would seek out. Like a lot of international beers today, it doesnt beat a lot of the domestic beers available today."
"It's an okay beer, but for the cost I expected something more, especially since my bottle was brewed in Canada, not Japan. It's slightly better than American macros, but for the price, I would rather have one of them."
"Easy-drinking and remarkably better and more characterful than many macro-imports, this is one to go to for a nice session beer."
"The dark brown bottle was misleading, disguising this light yellow lager. There's almost no carbonation or lacing. Not much to smell, just a little more to taste. I would say it tastes good for a macro lager. It doesn't have the offensive sting that the average macro does, so this would be a good alternative at the bar if I'm almost out of money."
"D- Is to drink just not a whole lot going on with it."
"D- Goes well with light meals"
"All in all, it could have been worse. Wasn't great, but hey, it's a Japanese lager. I ended up having a second one and it was better than the sake my girlfriend had."
"I think it's better than Budweiser, but only just."
"D: Overall I can't say this is a terrible or bad tasting beer, it's just that there is hardly any taste at all. Unimpressed...find something else."
"Drinkability is somewhat low. I drank the whole 22 oz but i wouldn't get another. I didn't pick up the check so I don't know how much they were charging for it, but Budweiser or Bud Light would have been preferable and definately cheaper."
"D - I could drink this on occasion. I remember drinking these at a Japanese steak house in the past and they went well with the meal."
"I can't say I was overly impressed by this, but I was disappointed one bit. If this were more widely available in the states and cheaper, I think it would be very popular among college kids and people looking for a cheap and easy buzz."
"I would not recommend this beer...not even at your local sushi place."
"If I have to eat squishy fish, sliced thin, and put on top of sticky rice, I might as well reach for this one."
"Drinkabilty: Pretty good drinkabiltiy, and doesn't taste too bad. Only a bit better than American macros, but enough so to be enjoyable. Definitely goes well with Japanese food and, while I wouldn't buy this normally, I would order it at a Japanese restaurant."
"D: Goes fine with sushi, probably would try something else next time, though."
"D: Pretty drinkable as it doesn't have a huge amount of alcohol, taste, or bitterness to it."
"M + D: A good little sting of carbonation on the front... rather crisp and dry towards the finish. Something of a pounder, this would be. Not the most intriguing beer, but not horrid, by any means. It would do alright with a meal."
"Had this beer a couple times at hibachi places, saw the giant can of industrial strength and picked a few up. Goes great with thai or chinese food as well. Overall, rather boring but not a bad choice when paired with something more interesting."
"This beer has become a staple for my friends and I. Anyway, pours out a nice light yellow color, with a 1-2 inch frothy head. Nice. Smells of rice, and it smells very fresh. Oh man does this stuff taste good! Its got a nice light, smooth taste. Goes down smooth, nicely carbonated. Nice and full mouthfeel. I would of gave this one a 5 for drinkability, but since i find that the bottled version of sapporo tastes much better than the canned. So thats why i docked it .5. Anyway, this a great light beer, with 5% ABV, and its of high quality, and can really mix with almost any food! I HIGHLY recommend this one! Cheers."
"D: Good at being what it is. Certainly a decent representation of the style. It's just not that interesting. The weird finish put me off."
"Drinkability: Entirely inoffensive, sweet, low in alcohol, and a way to knock out a style, really. It's not bad, I suppose, but there's so little going on here that it's hardly of any consequence."
"(From a limited, dated journal): Light amber in color, good foamy head, nice bitterness with a slight hoppy balance. Light fruitiness and, frankly, quite refreshing. This was tasty after a day working in the garden, but not something I'd crack open regularly."
"This beer is actually surprisingly drinkable and an OK example for the style - very crisp, good served cold and paired with snack food."
"Pours a clear gold with minimal head. Smells of slightly grainy, but there's not a whole lot there. The faintest nose I've come across. This pretty accurately describes the taste as well; a slight hop finish. Certainly not bad, just not much there. Pretty refreshing."
"Eric"
"My first Japanese beer and a very good one at that. Pours a light golden and filled with ascending bubbles. Smell is of rice (but in a good way), not like the adjuncts used in BMC. I thought this was a crisp, refreshing beer that went down easy. Sure it doesn't have the most flavor but it was nice to have after a long hard day of work."
"Mouthfeel is good, nice levels of carbonation, light in body. Drinkability is very good at least in that you could drink it all night."
"This is not a particularly good beer, though it is true to style, I suppose."
"This is somewhat clean for macro standards but feels a little heavy for the taste profile. Doesn't work bad with sushi but not something I'd reach for regularly."
"Poured a light gold color with a small white head at the pour. Very little carbonation. Smelled of malts, grain, rice and maybe a dash of hops. It was pretty foul.Taste is slightly bitter at the back of the mouth. Not something I would drink again. Ever."
"I expected Sapporo to be skunky like the few Chinese brews I've had have been but Sapporo overall left me impressed."
"While I could drink quite a bit of this, I had it at a Japanese steak house for $8 a pop. Ouch, fuck that. No where near that quality to be worth that much. Maybe if I could find it on the cheap sometimes, but I doubt that'll happen."
"Serve well chilled, add some sushi and a sunset. A good quaffer under these circumstances."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a stanard pint glass. Thwe brew is a pale straw colored yellow with an abundant, quickly dissipating head. The beer has a very faint malty aroma. On the tongue it is slightly sweet, no hop bitterness detected. I felt the beer was a bit thin, but this made it more drinakable. Overall this is a pretty standard lager, good for hot days,BBQ, and a general thirst quencher."
"Pours a clear golden/yellow with a large white foamy head ,with the head leaving decent lacing. The smell is light with only hints of floral aromas and sweet malt. The taste is light,crisp, with floral and sweet malt,like the smell. The m/f is light and not impressive. This is a typical large macro beer,with only some flavor and little else."
"Comes in a neat silver can although that doesn't boost the taste any. A small notch above some of the true crap swill. Light golden color, not a bad head on it. Malty, grassy flavor, a bit sweet and wheaty. It is somewhat refreshing. Didn't sample this with any Japanese food but I don't see how it would be any better that way."
"This is a good hot day beer, perfect for those BBQ's and backyard pool parties. A great everyday beer."
"Overall: marginal. If you get a chance - fine, if you never get the chance - fine."
"Poured a 22oz bomber into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a light straw yellow with just a hint of a puffy white head. The aroma is boiled rice, slightly soured milk and a hint of canned corn. The taste is really basic. Rice, a bit of adjunct, and for some reason just a bit of milk. The mouthfeel is much fuller then a normal ""Macro"" lager. Its still light but the rice must add a bit of body to it. Also, the carbonation is more toned down than a Macro too. This is definitely my go to beer when I get Sushi but not something I seek out."
"Pours clear pale gold. Medium sized head with some nice lacing for the style. Smell is mostly grassy hops. Taste is not very sweet. Rice crispness. Distinct light malt/adjunct aftertaste that's not unpleasant. Some grassy hops again. Light to medium mouthfeel. Wet. Pretty drinkable. Overall, a pretty standard generic lager. Not bad."
"D: Not awful, but I'm not sure that I would want to drink again."
"D. Very drinkable, pairs nicely with chinese food, as well as american grub. A palate cleaner for sure, good beer to drink at 11:30 in the morning."
"I have considered buying the double deuce numerous times over the years, well tonight I gave into temptation and purchased one. I got home after work and popped it open poured it into a glass and was intrigued by it's interesting taste. The first glass was pretty good but buy the time I finished the whole can I was a little disapointed. This beer tasted rather ""sweet"" to me. The greatest aspect of this beer is the beautiful silver can that it comes in, next time I will not hesitate to pass right on by this beer."
"Drinkability is good for an environment like this. This goes great with oriental dinners and even if you wanna try something exotic on a weekend, this is a good ""go-to"" beer. Not bad stuff at all."
"D: Not bad. I could drink this over a macro if there wasn't the import premium on the price. This might be why it wasn't selling at the bar. Don't know. Not bad though."
"D: Drinkability was ok, not bad flavor wise but really didn't encourage me to looking forward to finishing the drink. Mediocrity at its finest."
"Mouth: Very dry body from start to finish. Lovely bubbles tickle the mouth. Hoppy bitter & dry long lasting finish. Not exceedingly complex but very little to complain about. Nice and refreshing."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability off the charts, as this is one step away from water. I do like the shapely silver can with the bevels on it, though."
"Overall: refreshing, overly carbonated, but not otherwise interesting. If it was carbonated a reasonable level it would probably be even less interesting. At least the can is kind of cool, as far as cans go."
"D - Though not a particularly good beer, and a little pricey for what it is, it wouldn't be a bad alternative to American macros. Same general idea but pulled off with a slightly different spin."
"This pours an average lager yellow and doesn't present much of a head. The nose is grainy and unimpressive. Guess what, the flavor follows suit. Quite light with some rice and old hops. A light body has a bit too much carbonation to go down well. Just another macorish lager in my book."
"An okay beer that I probably wouldnt' seek out in the future."
"It pours a very clean light yellow color. The carbonation level was very low and it didn't make much of a head. Its aroma and flavor were subdued with hints of light malts and rice. There was only a slight dry bitterness on the tongue. The body was thin with a mild carbonation and a crisp clean finish. Over all a very simple ok beer."
"Nothing quenching or very sessionable about this guy. Like the Tao, it JUST IS. And boring at that. Wait - forget the Tao reference: The universe deserves better!"
"D - This is a better than average beer that really paired well with the Japanese food. The very light and crisp taste was a plus. I would have this again if it were the right occasion. Hell, I might would have this for the hell of it. Give it a shot."
"Somehow it manages to taste boozy while being only 5% alcohol. It's like water and booze strained through a rice paddy and served two days later. Nothing you'll ever want."
"D: Not too drinkable for me. Poor combination of mouthfeel and taste did not make this beer overly impressive for me. Not really a big fan of this beer."
"If I'm ranking strictly by style, I gotta admit, this isn't half bad. The taste is very clean and crisp, and very light. But this does seem a step above your typical BMC offerings. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style- light and moderately carbonated. This beer is built for drinkability, and I can't deny it props for that in ranking it. Maybe it just brings back good memories of my visits to Japan, but in those rare times when I'm just looking for something to drink that I don't have to think about and it's hotter than H-E-double hockey sticks, I wouldn't mind having a can of this around. Also, you have to admit, the can is pretty bad-ass."
"Poured the 22oz can into a pils glass- why? because BA recommened it - and received a clearish, golden body with a fluffy two-finger head that crashed quickly but left lace patches. A husky, grainy smell that was somewhat airy and had very little hop presence. A light-medium body with a smooth, almost silky finish. Very little taste to speak of, other than rice (natch), but there is very mild sweetness in this beer and there was no aluminum coming off in it. A simplistic but enjoyable beer, I'd have another one but I won't actively seek this every time I am at the store."
"Drinkability is low for me. It wasn't the worst beer I've had but I won't try it again."
"I'll order a 20 ouncer with raw fish, but not what I'd spend my money on to drink at home."
"D: only one or two with dinner, great drink before a glass of Sake."
"Drinkability: A good fun beer. That is very refreshing"
"overall this is not a bad beer, a lot better than a macro lager"
"On the whole, this is not a drinkable beer. It doesn't seem to have much complexity in the least."
"Nothing great."
"My pour produced a finger and a half of fluffy, bone-white head with low retention, but nice lacing. The color was a light yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose was faint and definitely sweet, very lager-like, but how does one discern rice? Mouthfeel was thin to medium with a pleasant sweetness on the tongue. Finish was light, slightly sweet and refreshing. Not bad, kind of innocuous, but a lot of beer (22 oz.) for a little bit of cabbage. I'd certainly take this over some of that Russian swill that I choked down at a comparable price."
"This beer went well with my sushi. It absolutely compliments the food I was eating it with. Very basic flavors. It would also go well with a hot summer day. Overall, an okay beer, not the best lager I ever had, but clean, crisp, dry and light."
" This is not at all hard to drink, a bit ""light"" overall in flavor but not a head-ache inducer like other's of it's kind can be."
"Tried this on tap at Haru sushi restaurant this past Friday night. Looks like an average lager that was served in a tall pilsner glass. The smell reminded me of all the average macro beers out there. The taste was pretty much the same. The only redeeming quality was the fact that is brewed with rice. This type of lager is a good accompaniment to sushi, since the rice flavor compliments the food, and the flavor is not too strong so that it doesn't conflict with the ginger and wasabi you may be eating. Not a bad choice at a sushi restaurant, but not really anywhere else."
"another good combo is miller high life + bass pale ale"
"This is a pretty mediocre beer if there ever was one. The look of the beer is what you'd come to expect, in that its all pale lager, minimal head, retention, lacing. The smell? What smell, it disappeared on me before I had enough time to contemplate it. The taste is adjunct, lots of it, some straw, grass, rice, and perhaps a bit of sweetener in there too. The only interesting quality to the beer is the ever so slight nutty tinges around the periphery of the taste. Beyond that, its sweet adjunct, definite thin rice, pale malts, and watery lager. I guess you can drink lots of this beer given the modest ABV, but why? I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not going back again. When I go out for Asian food, I'll get a tsingtao or a Singha as a beer beverage, not Sapporo. One and done."
"Overall: Light and refreshing. Solidly average example of the style."
"Update: Recent split a 6-pack with a friend. Hmmm. Seems more processed and rough around. Forget regular Sapporo, look for Sapporo Reserve instead."
"D: Went perfect with my meal. I've quaffed these before and they are very very drinkable. Its flavor says please drink more of me over and over again after first sip. ""Please drink more! Please drink more!"" the Sapporo cries. I say, ""Otay."""
"I felt this beer seems like it would be a decent regular beer for me if I could find it for a cheap price. Goes down easy and doesn't fill you up too fast and it has a flavor that you can come back to easy enough. Nice friendly beer."
"Pours a light straw color with a nice soapy pure white head that dissipated quickly into a sudsy cap. This brew is a shade or so lighter than your standard macro. The smell is grainy and sweet from the adjuncts. It has a tin like aroma as well. The brew has a sweet rice flavor, a bit grainy, slight bready malt, and a light metallic twang, either from being in a can or the small amount of hops. The feel is watery and well carbonated, finishes like seltzer water. This brew is lighter tasting than your standard American macro. It is not as grainy as the macro and holds up better when it gets warmer. Definitely not as astringent as the macro. Good pairing with sushi as they are both light. A good alternative to BMC."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. One of my favorites from Japan."
"Without a doubt the best macro-rice lager available. People need to understand the style and intent before rating this beer."
"Overall, a pretty Good, Cheap and refreshing brew."
"Nothing horrible here, yet also nothing that really stands out. Overall, a pretty average, refreshing brew."
"Nothing great here,easy to consume,kinda light,good for a try,but i prefer something a little more flavorful."
"moral of the story - decent beer in the right setting. outside of a restaurant experience, this is not going on my list of to be bought beers. Try it and see for yourself. It's a nice lager and makes no claims otherwise."
"D - This is one of the better Japanese beers that I've had its worth a try"
"Man, you've got to give a little respect to a can this big. Even for a light lager, it's still a little intimidating. Now as a beer, it's light, bland, and super clean. I was surprised that the beer ended on a note of spicy hops, but the rest was just a plain, sweet stream of liquid that resembled beer. Hops good, malt bad, I guess its better than them both sucking."
"Hands down this is one of the best beers I have ever had. It hasn't received the best rating, but for for someone that is just getting into the beer tasting I found it very enjoyable. It was not overpowering or lacking in flavor, the head poured very thick at first, but no more than two fingers. I only gave it a 4.5 in smell because it could have used a little more aroma. Yet another I could add to my arsenal of regular beers."
"D: A better beer than I expected, on par with some of the better European lagers, a good choice in a Japanese restaurant, I liked it overall, but not going to blow you away."
"It's been a long time since I had this, and it's not as good as I remember. Served ice cold with some spicy Asian fare, it'd be yummy. As just a beer to drink: much less so, though it's not undrinkable by any stretch. And yeah, the can is cool."
"Decent, but usually overpriced when it is essentially a Japanese Budweiser."
"Comment: It is reminiscent of a lot of American light lagers...perhaps its the rice and excessive carbonation that does the trick. It is not a memorable beer."
"Could not drink too many of these, but a pretty good beer none the less"
"Light, clean and crisp! I have to say I'm very suprised by the taste and appearance of this beer. This is the first time I've ever had a Japanese beer let alone a rice beer (that I know of). It almost hints of a tripel ale. Very clean pour and clean feel on the tongue. I very highly recommend this beer!"
"Never had this style before. Pours a nice, scant yellow color with a decent head. Smells of rice and bread with a mild sweetness. Taste has many of the rice notes except that it's kind of bready and dry. Nothing too impressive but definitely not offensive. Goes down smooth though. Not bad at all. The aftertaste is a bit dry as well."
"twelve oz. bottle- color of pale yellow, with a off white colored head  light nose of rice , soap , and some metallic  taste of rice , soap , and with some bitterness- body is light , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of rice , bread , and soap"
"I tried this beer on August 13, 2007 after purchasing from the local LCBO store. The beer a nice translucent gold colour into the glass with a large white loose head. The aroma was very weak, wwith no discernable scents. The mouthfeel was weak and watery with some hints of carbonation. The flavour was also weak with little or no discernable flavours"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a shaker. This beer poured a clear golden color with huge, visible carbonation bubbles dancing throughout the glass. A very thin, fizzy white head quickly disappeared. The aroma was grain and sweet malts. The flavor was mildly sweet with notes of grain and some faint hops at the end. The mouthfeel was light and slightly watery with high carbonation. What else is there to say? Just another average beer."
"Overall, I might consider this a step-up from a basic American Macro, but its definately not far off..."
"Packaged in a custom twenty-two ounce steel can, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"The flavors dont bend well, resulting in an unbalanced beer. I simply didnt like this one. I did not find a single redemptive characteristic. I will not be visiting this one again."
"Cheers!"
" Poured from the 500ml heavy-duty can into a pint glass. Body is a pale translucent straw color, topped by a minuscule amount of fizzy white head. Aroma of adjunct malt and just a touch of aromatic hops. Palate is light and refreshing, a lightly sweet malt character accented by a muted hop profile. Body is thin, as expected, but not unpleasantly so. A pretty good thirst quencher after mowing the lawn, but I wouldn't want it around for everyday consumption."
"Dr: Once you get used to the unusual flavor, it goes down pretty easily. But it's somewhat macro-like & thus not my style."
"The taste is malty and grainy and slightly sweet  but not to the point of being cloying. There's very little in the way of hop bitterness here, though the crisp, dry finish redeems it a bit. All in all, a little light-bodied for me. As far as Japanese beers go, I prefer Kirin (and even that's a relative statement) and I wouldn't drink this unless outside the context of a Japanese restaurant."
""
"Pours a typical clear golden-yellow, like most any other lager. Has a nice thick head though. Aroma is strong and fairly malty, about average for this kind of beer. Flavor is crisp but nothing special. Nevertheless, it is refreshing, OK if nothing better is available. Fine for a party or cookout."
"Got this one at a Japanese restaurant on the recommendation of the waitress. Pours a standard macro-lager straw color with a minimal head that disappears too quickly. Nose is nearly non-existent. Taste is just like a Bud; grain and malt, nothing much else. Feel is standard, fairly solid carbonation. Overall, it's pretty much macro-crap, with a Japanese label. Which I guess makes it better. Although not, really."
" ~ This is a beer that I will not likely purchase again. That is unless I'm in an oriental restaurant and I find it on the menu. However, the label indicates its brewed in Canada. My first Japanese beer, and it was brewed by our neighbor to the north, hmh?"
"D: Not very tasty, doesn’t go down very easily, slightly filling, I found it quite difficult to get through the can that I had (luckily it was just one) and would definitely not drink this beer again."
"Drinkability: Exactly what I expected. Refreshing to balance the saltiness of the sushi I was eating, but nothing special."
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer, imo the best of the macro lagers, and one which I turn to quite often."
"This beer to me resembles a domestic light beer.Not much carbonation with a watery taste and little to no aftertaste.I would classify this as incredibly average. There is nothing to this beer that would make me go out of my way to get it.Don't get me wrong it's not bad it just falls in with the same taste as many other beers."
"Taste isn't anything to write home about either. I was trying to distinguish if there was any kind of noticeable rice ""twist"" on this one, but came out with nothing other than the ordinary, slightly sour, very cereal-adjunct low bitterness taste you've come to expect from light lagers. Overall it's not terrible, since it goes down somewhat smoothly and doesn't have a bad aftertaste. But if you're expecting something different, you're in for disappointment."
"pretty much your basic worldwide macro lager. pale yellow with a fizzy head. not much bouqet, some faint noble hops, very faint, along with a slight metallic aroma. no malts noticed either in the nose or taste. very dry with a crisp finish. lots of forced carbonation. clean but uninteresting flavors. no reason to drink much of this other than to cleanse your palate or to get drunk."
"The sculpted silver can is a beautiful marketing tool for Sapporo. It looks great, it's reminiscent of a keg, looks modern (actually, iit's quite like a lot of Japanese architecture), and fits nicely in your hand. Beyond that, the beer is pretty average. The sample I had was brewed in Guelph, Ontario Canada (I'll assume under contract through Sleeman). It was clean in the nose and mouth, and offered a delicate combination of softly grainy malt and diffused floral and spicy hops. All the way through it was smooth and round and very well-balanced... just lacking in any character that would make it stand out from the pack. In fact, if there's any negative to this beer it's that the crystal-clear straw-gold body lacked anything more than a short-lived creamy head of bright white. Overall, no flaws but no sparkling moments either."
"This is apparently Japans answer to Americas BMC macros. Pours to a clear golden yellow, with little head or lacing, an almost skunky, grainy aroma and a flavor of wet grainy cardboard. Palate was stale and dry. Nothing special about this beer at all."
"capable brewer, even if this Sapporo is pretty average."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, very light golden color with a bubbly, white head. Smell is sweet with malt and adjuncts. Taste is also sweet, with a tiny bit of bittering hops. Not much going on at all. The mouthfeel is light with lots of bubbly carbonation. This beer is drinkable like water, mostly because it has very little character and is very light in body. As always though, just because you can do something doesn't necessarily mean you should."
"This is better than most American lagers, but I don't think I would drink this under any other circumstances."
"Horrible appearance.No sign of any head or carbonation. Scattered bubbles rising from the bottom. The color is a clear straw yellow. Aroma has a slight skunk cheap malt liqiour smell. Typical lager taste that has a crispness and a slight hop bite on the finish.This seems like headache beer to me. The mouthfeel isn't that bad and deserves a 3 for just average. Has a better taste than Bud, but other than that it's bad. I think Japan should stick to making cars and not beer."
"Taste is grainy with some dry biscuit aftertaste. Felt almost flat and listless in my mouth. Certainly wouldn't be flying to Japan just to sample beer if this is the best they can do."
"This is a good beer to compliment an Asian meal, but there is nothing spectacular about it. Average lager appearance of a light gold, smelling of light grains, and a taste that isn't repulsive but isn't interesting either. Feels dry and light-bodied on the mouth and drinkable, especially with some spicy dishes."
"Drinkability is average. Not great and nothing compared to any of the crafts out there, but still a decent choice when out to a sushi joint if Asahi is not available."
"Overall, I was impressed with this beer. It had much more flavor than I anticipated and it's light body and moderate hop profile make it a perfect beer to pair with spicy Asian cuisine."
"Poured a pale yellow with no head and lots of visible carbonation. There was no realy discernable smell, and really no taste to it. It was this or a bud light at dinner, and it probably would have been a draw. Its drinkable, ice cold in a frosted mug, but by the time it warmed up I had wished I ordered tea."
"Cool can, non-aluminum, okay beer, but too expensive for what it is."
"D- Goes down like water. Water is cheaper though. But then this will give you an alcohol buzz. Macro lager all the way."
"Not worth your time."
"Of the Japanese brands available in this area, Sapporo is easily the most drinkable. The color is clear yellow, with a nice foamy head that disappears quickly and completely. Smell is clean, with little in the nose. Mouthful is thin, but likely a bit better than many other ""imported"" macros. Taste is surprisingly pleasant and relatively flavorful. Not much malt, but a nice fruity hops flavor that, along with the smoothness provided by the rice adjunct, presents a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. Yoku dekimashita."
"Just another average macro in the style. Would help wash down a plate of lo mein perfectly. It is only an average alternative if you are eating at an asian restaurant."
"Mouthfeel was thin and somewhat watery. Mildly zesty yet smooth in the finish."
"Medium pale straw color with a nice creamy head atop. Smells weak but with a touch of rice husks. Taste is better than smell. More body than most other Asian beers I've tried. Still is rice dominate but has a nicer sweetness with no off flavors like many beers in its categories. A touch fruity with good carbonation in the middle. Finish is super dry. Just nothing. Quenches my thirst for sure."
"Overall, drink it while you're mowing your lawn or putting on a new roof."
"D- eh. This doesn't impress me."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Ahhh, yes, thankfully the mouthfeel here is excellent... alive and elegant, with nice prickliness. No doubt this has its place with Japanese food... it's easy drinking and its lack of character is actually a positive spin, you could argue. Save this one for your next trip to the sushi bar."
"Hmm, not really doing it for me. The malt content is really unbalanced and the bitterness is rather annoying. The carbonation is really what gets me as it is far too fizzy for its own good. This screams ""food beer."" After pairing with a three-course sushi meal, the flavors are neutralized somewhat although there is a grainy aftertaste that persists. Not one of my favorites."
"Pours yellow with a funky foamy head that quickly dissipates. Nose is somewhat fruity with a hint of malt. Taste is crisp and clean a bit of malt with very little hops. Goes well with Japanese steak. Mouth feel was light with lots of carbonation. Overall an average beer that goes well with oriental food."
"Taste is sweet for the style..medium bodied...pretty smooth...slightly dry finish...nothing remarkable about this but decent enough...seems like a thirst quencher type of beer.."
"Aftertaste was clean and refreshing."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. I'm sure it'd go great with Japanese or ""American"" food."
"This is slaking my summer thirst quite well, and it's altogether not a bad beer, but it's just different. Like other reviewers, I have a strong feeling that this would pair extremely well with the delicate flavors of sashimi."
"The appearance was a light amber with a pretty standard smell for a lager; small traces of rice. It left a small amount of lacing on the glass. The taste was slightly dry with a fair amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel was OK, as was the drinkability. This beer is pretty standard. Goes well with spicy asian food, but would also be totally fine with american fare as well."
"D- I am big into pairing beer with food and even though I would not drink this on any given nite I certainly will order it again when having sushi/asian food."
"Not recommended. This review seems slim, but there is nothing more to add about this beer. I would rather consume a BMC."
"This beer poured a nice clear golden yellow, with a nice white head that lasted for several minutes. The smell is hoppy and though the taste at first seems to be light, the mouthfeel is full and hoppy. Though I prefer a more malty beer, this is not too hoppy for me to consider it a drinkable beer."
"This beer poured a clear golden/straw type color with a thick persistent head. The smell is hoppy and very reminiscent of what I think of as bar beer. The taste is mellow and flavorful. It is not as hoppy as I would have expected. The mouthfeel is on the thin side but not quite watery. Overall this is a drinkable beer and could be considered refreshing."
"This beer has a dark golden color with an airy head that sticks around as you drink it. It has a filtered hoppy smell that doesnt over power. The flavor is faint and crisp. The hops are balanced well. The beer has a smooth start and finishes slightly heavy. This beer is drinkable and would be a fine accompaniment to a stake or other red meat."
"D - It is an okay lager. Not something that I would grab often, though."
"Lots of carbonation in this one, masks alot of flavor. Lightly grassy malt, definite rice character in there, just enought hop to keep it from being sweet. Very crisp, not as thin as you would expect. A step above basic for a Japanese lager. Considering where it's from and the style, not bad."
"Drinkability: I'm sure I could drink a bunch of these in succession if it was all that was offered, but I'm not impressed. Bad aftertaste and smell really detract from me wanting to drink more than one of these."
"I can't even see having this with an Asian meal - skip it. If you do venture it, make sure it's cold, otherwise a funky chemical taste sets in."
"Don't buy this unless it's cheap, it's not anything special. Doesn't taste special. It tastes like an american lager. I don't know why some of my friends think this is so awesome. It's pretty decent but not that great."
"The can looks pretty cool. The beer is not as impressive."
"This stuff smells pretty bad, some cooked cabbage, a slightly metallic odor makes it's way up. Not the nicest. This is reflected in the flavor, the rice is evident in this as an adjunct. This isn't the smoothest beer i've had, but it really isn't that hard to drink, but with all that being said I don't think I'd be rushing out to get this one again."
"Overall: Another Japanese beer imported from... Canada! Overall, this is pretty much forgettable, but I wouldn't turn one down after cutting the lawn."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with a smattering of white foam. Nose is light, but with more character than I would expect from a rice lager, musty with a bit of earthy/peaty sweetness. Taste follows nose, sweet rice with a hearty musk and a hint of hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth yet crisp. Not nearly as crappy as I would have expected. Mixed well with the poorly sung, but heartfelt songs."
"This is crisp and clean and sweet for the most part, but lacks the depth in a good lager that I enjoy. My first rice lager though so maybe I am just ignorant to the style? At any rate, I can only see myself partaking in this lager again on a nice hot summer day, possibly at the beach."
"600 ml brown bottle embossed logo on shoulder. Label sports the large gold star and ""Premium: banner. A closer look at the fine print and we find that this is brewed under supervision of Sapporo by Sleeman Brewing , Guelph, Canada. Pours a typical pale yellow, very carbonated which gave a nice white head, but shrank away in about one minute. Smell of sweet corn and rice, no discernable hop aromas. Taste wasn't too bad, slight bitterness in the finish. An alright beer, that would go good with sushi to cut the salty soy sauce, but not what I would call a premium."
"Poured from a 22oz can into a glass stein, it's a rather average looking beer. Lots of head forms but quickly dissipates. Nose is almost undetectable. Taste is pretty solid for macro lager. It's got a sort of sharp flavor, interpreted as 'thin' by some, possibly as a result of the rice and corn used in addition to the barley and hops. Quite well balanced all in all and certainly different than most macro lagers. Mouthfeel is pretty average for this sort of beer. Nothing out of the ordinary there. I find this beer to be very drinkable if you're not a malt or hop fiend. The good balance between malt, hops, rice and even corn is it's best feature. That none of the constituent ingredients overpowers or even really stands out from the rest is desirable in my opinion. Definitely recommended."
"Overall: Some elements certainly stick in my mind, mostly how it starts to hit my mouth like rock salt on a pretzel. Certainly drinkable."
"A nice drinkable beer. Good when you are at a Japanese restaurant."
"Drinkability - Beer would eventually wear on me, however I do not regretting getting one just because of its unique taste. Other beers feature better aroma and are defianetely more drinkable than this beer."
"Bland in the flavor dept. and a rather bland mouthfeel, light in body and alcohol as well...quite drinkable and not bad tasting, this one is enough for my liking."
"Light bodied, watery mouthfeel. Like most macros fairly easy to drink."
"Drinkability: It's fine and easy enough to drink. However, I probably will not seek this out, but I would not turn down a free one."
"A fair offering, albeit nothing special. Pours out to a light yellow color with a medium high level of carbonation that yeilds a large white foamy head. Some lace. Aromas of light malt, sweet adjuncts, grass. Taste was light on the palate, with notes of rice blandness, mild watered down malt, grain, and some hay. Mouthfeel was like a modern day Eddie Murphy movie; uneventful and boring. Average drinkability. Maybe on a hot summer day... only for the cool lookin' can."
"Had a bottle in a Japanese restaurant in Pensacola FL. Tasted like a macro lager. Straw yellow color. Small head. Not a lot of aroma. Has a slightly hoppy taste, not as bland as most macro lagers. Mouthfeel is light but not overly watery. Good complement for food and I could drink it as a session beer, but I wouldn't seek it out. Why pay $4.50 a bottle when you could get SA Boston Lager or Yuengling for the same price or cheaper?"
"Drinkability: Not too good, an unatractive and forgettable beer. Not worth the time, money, or effort."
"Goes down okay. Went good with my sushi. This performed above my expectations. Refereshing if nothing else"
"More hops and more flavor than your standard American macro, which lends a higher degree of drinkability if you ask me. Crisp and dry on the finish with a touch of bitterness, and a milder (ergo more tolerable) carbonation level than your domestic stuff. Don't be mistaken, though-- this is still a generic light lager brewed for mass markets. Another reviewer wondered if people would still buy it if they knew it's made in Canada. Well I knew that and I still bought it, but then again I was at an Asian restaurant and I was thirsty. It went fairly well with my spicy beef noodle dish. By the way, Guinness Extra Stout is brewed in Canada. How many people know that?"
"22 oz. sculpted can, served chilled in a pilsner glass. It pours a very bright gold with a 1 finger white head that doesn't leave much lacing. It smells of adjuncts, some skunk, and maybe some grape/apple notes. The taste is about the same with a hint of hops on top of a light and tingly body. Average at best. Will not be seeking it out again."
"While this isn't all that bad, there really isn't anything to bring you back. There are better macros out there to spend your money on."
"Fairly clean and refreshing as a light flavored beer goes- perhaps a decent lawn beer. But there are so many better choices."
"One of my two sushi beers. I really surprised I like this beer, it doesnt fall into my normal range. I most often have this beer in the 22-oz size at my favorite sushi place. It pours a crystal clear yellow with moderate carbonation and decent lacing. The head is very thin and doesnt last long. The mouthfeel is light and biting. The taste smooth and grain flavored, its really too light if not drunk with food. It has a bit of a bite at the finish."
"This brew pours a clear, pale, golden-straw color. The head is one-finger in height, creamy and white, but recedes very quickly. The aroma is very faint and of pale malt. It is very simple, but inoffensive. The taste...well, there really isnt' one. There is a slight (and by slight I mean barely detectable) bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer isn't quite awful, but if you want something with taste it isn't for you. I am not an expert on Japanese rice lagers, but I couldn't see why a brewery wouldn't be able to make one with a little more flavor than this brew and still be within stylistic guide lines."
"Overall impression: Not much going on here - I've enjoyed it in the past with sushi, but it definitely doesn't hold up on its own."
"Pours a clear medium-pale gold with a small, white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. God lacing. The smell is of mild grainy malt with just a touch of grassy hops. The taste very mild. Weak malts and rice with some very light citrus on the crisp finish. It has a thin body, dry texture and lively carbonation. Nothing special, but nothing terrible. Just bland and a bit below average. Not worth it."
"Overall: I'd take this over a macro, but not much else. I like the can though."
"Although probably not the greatest beer around, I would recommend giving it a try. I don't mind drinking a few cans of this an odd night."
"Pours a medium yellow with a light head that dissipates very quickly. Smells bitter and hoppy, but not exceptionally strongly. Tastes slightly bitter and dry, a little too harsh for my liking. Feels rather thin, not particularly inspiring. Reasonably drinkable, but not very good at all."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Maybe I'll give this another try from bottle on a hot summer day. I just did not enjoy this beer at this time."
"Brought 2 bottles for proper tasting, wish I only had to endure 1 of this junk."
"Nice thing is that the can is strong/thick enough to stay cold for some time, since if fills the pint glass more than once."
"The mouthfeel of this beer isn't all that different from water. I think that this beer is over carbonated. You know how sometimes when you drink a soda you get that burning(for lack of a better word) sensation in you nose because you haven't had something that carbonated in a long time; thats what happens when I drink this beer. I will definitly not be buying this beer ever again. Because this beer has so much in common with tonic water it is easy to drink, but really I think I would rather have plain water over this stuff."
"I like to order this beer when I'm at a Japanese restaurant enjoying sushi. It's the type of beer that compliments sushi nicely. Sapporo is not a beer I would go out of my way to buy when there are so many better options out there."
"Not a truly terrible beer but certainly nothing here to justify the exorbitant price (6500 won)."
"¡Salud!"
"Wouldn't go out of my way for more."
"Pours a very pale straw yellow, with a respectable white head that leaves good lacing. The smell was just weird. The taste was thankfully funk-free though: light rice-malty sweet, a touch of hop bitterness, and little to no aftertaste. Fizzy soda-like mouthfeel, and extremely drinkable. Pretty good for what it is, and a damn sight better than its main Japanese competitors. Better from the bottle than from the can."
"Just another bleh beer, but most Euro pales are."
"Fresh, clean, light and simple. Nothing wrong with that in my book."
"D = A bit pricey. Much better beers availiable for the amount you must pay for this."
"Drinkability: At 650 ml a pop, I don't need more than one to quench my thirst, and I certainly wouldn't bother drinking it for flavour. Nothing offensive though - maybe I would drink it at a sushi bar... for atmosphere."
"Served cold from a 12 oz. bottle, pours golden clear with no precipitating carbonation. Small whitish head which fades quickly leaving minimal lacing. Lemony, hopsy nose, which sad to say is reminiscent of a Corona. Wheaty, flat flavor, more dry than sweet. Watery mouthfeel. No real aftertaste. Decent drinkability. Overall, bland and disappointing. I had expected much more from this beer, especially for the price. Ill have to try the can to see if there is any discernable difference."
"Light bodied, actually a bit watery. This would work very well with most asian cuisine, and not too bad with barbecue. Crisp, refreshing, but better with food - and ice cold - than by itself."
"Though not as nasty as some of the beer from Asia, this one is not a favorite. It also isn't useful by itself. It is, however, okay for washing down sushi and for the coolness of the oilcan. Perhaps I'm just not a fan of the ""style."""
"More drinkable than your average macro, and still preferable over Bud or Miller products. Very pleasant yellow lager color, soft head, and leaves nice lacing in the glass. I can't really detect any odor worth noting. This beer has a very clean taste that doesn't interfere with your meal. I'd never drink this without food, just because this isn't the kind of beer you'd want to enjoy by itself. It can't stand on it's own in that respect. It's great with sushi or pad thai."
"Actually I reviewed a big can, not a bottle."
"Had this at a local Asian restaurant. Pours a clear yellow with minimal head, smelling of corn and very little hops. Tastes like corn as well, going down fairly smooth, but with a metallic type aftertaste that does, to its credit, disappear after a few minutes. The sad thing is that I would choose this beer over any American adjuncts. Not too bad if you have a chaser..."
"Last swigs: Watered down malt liquor. Label states brewed in Canada. This is probably better straight out of the bottle. Nothing to shout about."
"($2.99 / 22 oz. tall silver multi-faceted can)"
"This really could pass for a very nice German pils. It's far better than the Sapporo Reserve. I don't understand how other reviewers missed the flavor characteristics here."
"Sapporo Premium comes in a 22 oz. faceted can. This is my first Japanese rice lager, which I guess is their equvilant to an adjunct lager. Appearance is light golden in color with average head. Aroma is very sweet and full. Not a bad smell for a macro style lager. Taste is also sweet, but not cloying. Flavor here is full compared to my expectations. This is pretty drinkable, but I think it might get old after a while."
"Clear golden color. Lots of bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Thick white fluffy head. Good head retention. Very week adjunct aroma. Sweetness that I assume is from rice, very little malt flavor. A little bitterness to end with. Light body, high carbonation. Not much to get excited about here."
"I wasn't expecting much by this beer, and I expected right. This beer is nothing special. Japanese swill. Really plain, and not exciting. I guess the only thing decent about it was the head."
"All in all, far from being on the top of my 'to drink' list, however, a good, smooth, light beer. And the can is pretty damned cool, I think."
"rather boring pale straw yellow color with a minimal white head which dissipates quickly. smells like cheap beer. taste was rather ordinary but had a crisp hop bitterness that made it tolerable. mouthfeel thin and watery and drinkability average. the best thing about this beer is the cool 22 oz. can."
"A light beer that pours out like water. It has a thick, almost soapy head that dissipates in about five minutes. Bland taste: easily forgettable, but not offensive. Overall, I'd rank Sapporo Premium somewhere in the lower third of the Great Beer Bell Curve. Not awful, but you can easily do better."
"Not a lot to say about this one, appearance was average, smell was rather vague, corn, a bit sweet smelling, you could taste a bit of hops, and a rather dry finish, some grainy sweetness as well, mouthfeel was bubbly , and a little chewy, the drinkability for me is not very high, I just don't care for these kind of beers much anymore, still, I don't think it's that great a beer, regardless, these tasted much better when I was actually in Japan in the 80's, must have been the novelty of ""Wow dude! I'm drinkin Japanese beer!"" lol"
"corn aftertaste"
"I had a 22oz'er of this as I was eating some tasty Sushi and a Filet Mignon. This beer pours a brilliantly clear straw color and it topped by a frothy pale white head. When this beer first hits my lips it has a spicy almost gingery hotness to it that quickly leads to a sweet grain character in the middle of this beer. The finish is still sweet with a bit of sharpness from the hops. This was a great palate refresher in between bites of sushi, pickled ginger, and filet. I must say that this beer worked out quite well, and I think that my review of this beer reflects the fact that had I had this beer on its own I would not have enjoyed it nearly as much."
"This has got to be some sort of foreign beer, but I think my can - which read ""Japan's Finest..."" - was filled in Canada. Strange and a little wrong? Perhaps, but it hardly detracted from the drinking experience. Sapporo pours yellow and settles amber-golden with a thick white head. Over more than 20 minutes, the head will eventually fade to whiskers of foam on the top of the beer. Sapporo premium smells of sugars, caramel, and licorice. It starts malty smooth with a crisp twinge of bitter hops. It is medium-bodied and sports cream and slightly wheat-like flavors. There is noticable hop bitterness throughout as it settles on the tongue. The finish of this beer is wet, very malty, and leaves you with a smooth, light, and bitter aftertaste."
"Not as winey, tart or fruity as the ""Original Draft Beer."" On the nose it is reminiscent of cracked, sun-baked grains. The head is admirably persistent and doughy. On the palate: whistle-clean with simple, butterscotch sugars and a dense, dry flank of seasoned hops. Good clean fun."
"Japanese beer brewed in Canada and imported to unsuspecting Americans. I'm all for free trade, but do you think that if no one drinks this stuff, they'll still ship it across the border?"
"pours a medium golden colour with a fairly thin, fizzy head that's not around for very long. the smell is primarily sweet with some malt and grain apparent. pretty thin smell overall. nothing dominated and it was watery at times. the taste hear is actually not bad at all. one of the better asian macro type brews in terms of taste. there is a slightly creamy malt taste with some sweetness throughout. nothing bold overall but crisp and refreshing. was a decent pairing with my chinese food. when dining at asian restarants, this one would tend to get the call, as most around here only offer the standard us macros, heineken and lesser quality asian brews such as tsingtao and kirin."
"This pours a very pale gold with a whiffy white head. The aroma is slightly citrusy and I have to admit, its pretty appealing. The flavor is very dry and absolutely no aftertaste. You taste it when its there, but when you swallow, all flavor is gone. Its bizarre. Its got a little bit of hoppiness to it."
"Overall a decent beer. Not one I would go out and make a point to buy but I would have it if I am at a Japanese restaraunt and they are selling it."
"-Oelergud"
"If presented with a choice between this and Kirin however, take this, it at least has a unique taste."
"Not bad. Reminds me of a couple of the Polish lagers. Not much flavor, but crisp and clean. None of the macro-sweetness you find in U.S. macros (and their many imitators). Nice appearance, with a foamy head and lacing that lasts. Not too pale. Worth trying, probably good with spicy food."
"Very drinkable, I suspect that this would have higher scores if consumed with Sushi."
"Japenese beer brewed in Guelph, Ontario? This golden lager poured a decent head. The smell is kind of funky, not sure what ingriedients are used, but rice must be one. The taste is about equally as funky, with a very strange taste. Not an overly drinkable beer and not one to seek out."
"About the only good thing about beers like this one is that you don't remember them and you can use those brain cells for something else."
"Bought in a time pinch at a take out sushi place. Will try to do better next time. No nose, highly carbonated, skunky, minimal flavor, watery, corn? rice?. Brewed in Canada according to the can. OK for a very hot day, when you can find nothing else in the fridge. No reason to consume more of this one."
"Budweiser with a Japanese twist. It poured a clear golden color with little head. The smell was skunky with the faint scent of hops. The taste was watered down, but I did get a grainy hops taste in it. Like I said before, it seemed very watered down. It had little to offer."
"This beer poured a pale yellow/light gold color that was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head that was produced was pure white in color, and had the consistency of a fluffy cloud, and seemed to last quite some time until it fell to a ring on the edges. The lace that was created was fairly detailed a good way to the bottom of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly faint, but I could detect some sweet malt, faint fruit, hops, and a kind of corn grain. The aroma reminded me of Miller products, Light to be exact. The tastes were also kind of weak, hops, husks, malt, grains and a hint of pine were all I tasted. As it warmed considerably, I noticed some light fruit come out. The aftertaste was just as faint, some pine or hops were just about it and they did not last long. The body was light. Kind of watery on the tongue and over all, very average at best. The bottle and logo seemed to be the best part of this beer"
"Pours yellow with minimal headbut very good lace. Lots of carbonation. Very light aroma , minor citric hop notes and faint crystal malt aroma. Taste is virtually non-existent. Starts with faint malt but never goes anywhere. Nothing more than a hint of bitterness, minor spice. Pretty bland. My guess its brewed with a lot of adjuncts."
"Ah, the nectar of the Samurai! Bubbly straw yellow with a poofy white head. Smells of sweet grains, and big rusty hops. Tastes of clean, light rice and barley. Hops start big, but then fade into almost nothing. Finish is slightly bitter. I also detected some weird, almost fruity rubbing alcohol notes (sake? just kidding). Not bad, but I'm still not a huge Asian lager fan."
"Pours a pale golden colour topped by a small head that settles down quite easily. Not a bad pilsner bad i found it much more bitter in the taste than other pilsners. Aroma is dominated by malts. Leave the beer for couple of seconds in your mouth before swallowing. You will feel the bitterness of the beer on your taste buds. Goes down quite easily. Not a bad pilsner"
"Got a 16oz bottle at a Japanese 'hibachi' style restaurant. Went nicely with teryaki steak and shrimp. Alone it didn't really measure up, with slight corn aroma and taste. Fizzy yellow stuff to be sure, but the food softened the blow, the beer quenched the thirst and a good time was had by all."
"A pretty easy drinking lager certainly better than most American and canadian macros but not great."
"Light gold color, medium head. A light bodied, lager style beer. Light malts, but fairly hoppy. Smooth, clean taste. Full flavored. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Finish is slightly bitter. Nice refreshing draft beer. Fresh tasting despite being canned."
"Both the smell and taste is crisp but vacant. I guess this might be o.k. with sushi or some other food, but i would opt for Saki instead."
"Altogether a very clean and crisp beer that is refreshing even though it is somewhat lacking in flavor. I've yet to have sushi, but that is something that I hope to remedy soon, and when I do I'll probably have a Sapporo with it. A decent macro import."
"Cleansing if nothing else. Taste is alright and pretty much non-offensive. Still, at $6 a bottle, I felt robbed. Besides, the headache I got later that night (presumably from the beer) didn't help either."
"Came in a brown 600ml bottle. My thoughts are this is just a slightly modified version of Sapporo draft with a shiny gold label. Pours out a pale clear straw and a pretty impressive head. The head manages to stick around more than halfway down the glass to my surprise, and leaves a decent lace. Nose is mild with some sweet malt and only a hint of floral hops. Flavour is dry, vaguely sweet with a mild hoppy finish. Nice full mouthfeel for such a pale lager though. I'd order this one with sushi rather than the draft."
