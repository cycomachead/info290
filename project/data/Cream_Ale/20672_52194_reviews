"O:  Good, but won't be getting again."

"Perfect spring/summer brunch beer!"
"I agree that this is a craft beer drinker's light beer. Really nothing much to the taste. A hint of malt, no hop; however, it is smooth. Just not a whole lot to say about it. If you aren't getting the $6 growler, you're paying WAY too much for this beer. Mediocre."
"great refreshing Cream Ale. One of my all time favorites"

"Very drinkable beer.  Good beer to give to  your neighbor who only drinks domestics.  Creamy and fresh taste."

"O - Light medium body that is fairly carbonation but finishes smooth and dry.  Malt forward beer with only a hint of hop flavor.  3.5/5"

"Cream Ales are not a style that will turn heads but...this is a very good example of the style and it is certainly an easy drinking brew. I like."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Another disappointment from Sun King."

"Overall a 4/5 because of its consistency in taste and appearance, but not a favorite beer for most people I am sure."

"i have said it many times but i will say it again, we need more cream ales out there. they aren't all going to be world class, but its a nice refreshing drink and definitely underrepresented on the beer scene. this one is very light, but still maintains a classic frothy mouthfeel and bright carbonation. there is indeed a milky sweetness to this that hints at corn-like sugar, but the finish is still clean. I'm missing a little body here, and also some balancing hops for bitterness, but i really like the drinkability and the package (four pack of pint cans), a very good dose. this is nothing earth shattering, but it is a useful brew. good blonde beer for colder weather too, as it has a little meat to it despite the thinner body. of the handful of beers i have had from sun king, this is not the highest quality but one of the ones i appreciate the most. let cream ales live on!"

"Poured a clear, yellow with non persistent creamy white head which receded quickly. Highly carbonated. Aroma of biscuits, bread, raw donut dought, yeast. Taste dominated by breadiness, some biscuit malt. No bitterness but not sweet. Finished somewhat clean, high carbonation tingling, refreshing. Quite a lingering bready aftertaste."

"This beer is definitely their introductory beer or for people that are not into strong tasting beer. The appearance was a clear yellow and fizzy. Had about two fingers worth of head that hung around for a while. I really didn't pick up much on a smell. The taste was just ok. It was kind of bland. It was nice to drink on a hot day, but I couldn't see myself drinking a lot of this."
""
""
""
"It was pretty smooth, but it definitely isn't the quality that I have been trying recently. The color is a light orange to a yellow. The smell had a citrus-type of feel. It wasn't anything that special. Since different people like different things, I would read multiple reviews to see if you should try it for yourself."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, was let down. I'd rather Drink Gennese cream ale. Seriously."
""
"Poured from pint can to pint glass, how convenient! Nice golden yellow with bright two-finger head that runs away fairly quickly with little lacing. No huge aroma, smells fresh almost like sea spray! Very smooth on the palate, nothing jumps up and grabs you but the malt is probably predominant. Doesn't hit you over the head with anything, no hops to speak of. This reminds me of listening to the Indy 500 in the garage with my dad in the early 70s and being allowed to take one swig of his beer. Nice. Not the greatest I ever had or the most complex, but would definitely buy again. Good to have on hand to serve at a cookout to those who think Bud Light is good beer."

""

"Note: I was a little bit surprised by this, it was better then I expected and I always like that."
""
""
"Can. Pours a clear and very dark golden color with effectively no head on it. Nose has some corn notes to it, and is very reminiscent of a traditional lager. Taste is actually fairly crisp and not too lager-y, and without the eerie sweetness I feared. Very drinkable."
"O- This beer is a great cream ale. It has some nice flavors that all blend and compliment each other. There is a touch of sweetness here and there to add freshness to the flavor but it says dry making it very sessionable. As the summer heats up this becomes more and more sessionable."

"Taste is, expectedly, light and creamy. This one is sooo smooth and malty, but very drinkable and, as the can imparts, approachable. Sunlight Cream Ale wouldn't turn away lifetime macro drinkers, but has plenty of easy-going flavor for craft nerds, too. A solid and totally session-worthy brew here, not too complex, but smooth and well-crafted to style."
""
""
"O: Very solid cream ale. Spotted Cow is a touch better as the lager flavor profiles come out a little more in this beer giving a sweetness that is just ok."
""
""
"O-A nice light session beer however there are much better options out there. A tad too light to my tastes."
""
""
""
""

"Light to medium body, no traces of alcohol. This is made for quaffing, which is no problem. A very simple beer. Take it for what it is."

"O= Overall, decent summer beer but I won't get this one for the price overall I just think it is to much for such a basic beer."

"I don’t understand why anyone would drink this. If there was a 0 for the 5 categories this would receive 0’s from me. The smell uh if smell is were the majority of taste comes from that’s diffidently not a plus here. Appearance not what I think any beer should look like. Taste none the only taste is a cringing metallic taste. Palate there is none you would think something that has cream in the title would have some body? However this is pure water constancy."

"The BJCP defines a Cream Ale as clean, well-attenuated, American lawnmower beer and I'd say Sun King hit the nail on the head. Smooth, crisp, easy-drinking with enough subtle malt/hop flavor to keep the session interesting. Missing out on brilliant clarity but otherwise not much these guys can do to improve."
"o - terrific session beer for warmer days. hope to get this one again."
""
""
""
"Decent beer for style - goes for a Northwest style golden ale."
"Mouthfeel is the biggest step up. It has all of the light characteristics of a standard lighter body ale or lager, but it actually has a creamy feel to it. EXTREMELY drinkable though, has a good thing going here. I like this and glad to try something from Sun King. Not the best best beer I've ever had, but glad to have the opportunity to try it. Thanks huadog for the sweet extra!"
""
"O- This is an easy drinking beer definetly what I would classify as a BBQ beer. Nothing great but I wouldn't mind kicking back with several of these."

"Mouthfeel: light body, slight carbonation, with a malt flavor that lingers for a bit then dissipates leaving no aftertaste."
"Pours a yellow color with very good clarity. 1 finger head that quickly fades and leaves nothing behind. Nose has some hops and grains present but nothing more. Taste is pretty smooth and enjoyable. Has some sourness to it and malts. Mouthfeel is fairly thin with decent carbonation from the tap. Overall a decent beer."
"exceptionaly easy drinking beer. Low hops make it a great everyday beer. Crisp light flavor with out a strong after taste. Good beer to keep on hand for guests ,watching a baseball game or just to quench your thirst on those hot days around a barbecue."
"It is a step above adjunct lagers, but some hops could of made this a much more interesting beer."
"O-very good example of the style. Would try again"
"O - a good example of the style."
"Thanks to JAYBLACK, for the chance to re-visit in the can"
"O: To me, this is the essence of mediocrity in craft beer: unimpressive flavor wrapped in the shell of a unique style. Sorry guys, but this is one of the weaker beers I’ve tasted from Indianapolis’ own. Not undrinkable, but not worth seeking out."
"O: super drinkable. I was hesitant to crack this thinking I wouldn't like it, but if it was available it'd be a go to summer beer. Best cream ale I've ever had."
"o: a nice transition beer, though I'm at a point where I look for more. It was plenty refreshing and I could see myself revisiting on a very warm day out by the pool as this isn't overbearing but has a nice abv to it. Would have like more of the creamy sweetness, though the velvety feel in the mouth made me happy i tried this."
"O: A solid beer and a perfect summer day/knock back a six-pack kind of beer. Would definitely drink more."
"As I poured this beer into the glass it looked a little pale to me. As i drank the beer it tasted just as bland. I never got a strong enough taste with the 4 that i drank to have anything bad to say about it other than just that: it was flavorless. There was a little creaminess to it but very little. I am a big Sun King fan but this is a weaker beer of theirs."
" Overall this a summer beer in every sense of the word.Not very complex but after reading the can I don't think it's intended to be.Like it says a nice gateway into craft beer."
"Highly drinkable, this sprightly ale is ideal for the heat of mid July. It has enough flavor and character to keep it interesting from beginning to end."
"The mouthfeel was interesting. Rich and smooth but with a coarseness in the carbonation."
"Overall - nothing really stands out too much here, but it's a nice, smooth, refreshing summer type cream ale. Much better session option than a MBC on a hot, sunny day. I'd definitely have this again."
"D - This is probably my favorite lawnmower beer. Very light and crisp, but still actually contains flavor."
"O- This beer is very light and easy to drink. I just like a bit more flavour in by brew."
"Overall: A decent beer, good for summer. Easy drinking, but it was a bit more bitter than I expected."
"O: Couldn’t quite tell the difference between this beer and a BMC. Very disappointing."
"D/O- Very easy drinking, refreshing. Good lawnmower beer. Thanks again dannyfrost for the Sun King!"
"O - Not terribly interesting, but not much wrong with it either."
"O: Good cream ale. Not my favorite style but it is refreshing."
"Light bodied with decent carbonation, this beer definitely has good drinkability. It slides down the throat easily and is definitely a thirst-quencher."
"drinkability is not good - not a drain pour - just a flavorless beer - i will try to enjoy the other 3 while watching some basketball/baseball game"
"Drinkabililty: I would definitely have this again. I recommend this to those seeking a solid cream ale, light and a better alternative than macro lagers."
"Shiny, golden-yellow color, lively bubbles racing to the top which keeps the head intact. Smells of wholegrain cereal with the additions of wheat and oats, fermentation twang and hops in the nose as well. Crispness lays into the lighter but slick body; clean and grainy with a dry, doughy wholegrain bready flavor. Hops rest a modest bitterness on the palate, yet are big enough to balance. Drying finish has a clean linger of grain. A tasty canned treat, a lunch-time pounder. Craft tallboys, FTW!"
"This is a lighter beer that would be great to drink on a hot day."
"drinkable - uhm, seriously ? yes !"
"Quite a refreshing beer, yet still has enough going on flavor-wise to be able to enjoy reviewing it. This little brewery seems to do all the little things right, and is making some tasty non-extreme styles quite well from what I can tell so far. Seek this one out if you can get it."
"You get more bang for your buck alcohol and flavors-enjoyed-by-beer-dork wise with most any other craft beer offering, but it's hard to match Sunlight's intense taste and easy drinking. Would gladly pay the premium to drink this over any other light tasting beer in the warmer months. Please distribute this more widely!"
"D: Not my favorite style, but this was a nice refreshing beer which is one thing I like about these kinds of beers. Worked well on a hot day at the Bruery."
"Sunlight Cream Ale is the micro-brewing equivalent of insisting that Picasso paint something ""recognizable"" just to prove he had the technical skills to make representational art. Artisinal brewing is just that: subjective, aesthetic, and about gathering an appreciative audience. If you (or anyone you know) doubts that micro brewers can handle the demands of brewing a light, tasty, satisfying beer, give them one of these. And then pop open an Osiris. After an Osiris, I had to try the ""other"" Sun King canned offering, and while it is a technical achievement and stand out for its precision, smoothness, and execution, it is, at the end of the day, a cream ale. It brings back memories of school in Binghamton, New York, eating hot wings at the Sportsman's Club and Rathskeller and washing down the Frank's Red-Hot with Genny (Gennesee Cream Ale). Not a bad memory, but also not the height of brewing's Olympus either."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. The tall boy cans will keep give me a little more time before going back to the cooler which means more time for a multitude of backyard games."
"(D)- A good light beer to mix it up with during the summer months. Crisp and dry and just an all-around easy to drink beer."
"My initial pour netted me two fingers' worth of fluffy bone-white head fizzled and popped its way out of existence. Color was sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty sweet and adjunct-free. It is nice to smell an all-malt beer every once in a while. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a very clean malty sweetness on the tongue. I would be curious to know what hops were used since its bitterness is almost non-existent. Finish was crisp and refreshing, definitely approachable for novice craft beer drinkers. A solid CANdidate for the cooler on the way to the beach. Definitely seek this out!"
"D - my first reviewed cream ale, from the look at the rest of the scores, it is not an appreciated or well liked style, however in my opinion this one has to be one of the better ones, worried it was gonna be like genese cream ale however i think its much more complex"
"This was definitley decent for a Cream Ale, with a little more a hop profile to it which helped add a bit more flavor and crispness. Not sure if this is worth the same $10 per 4-pack price as the Osirus but it's still a good one to keep chilled in the fridge and then go to town on during those hot summmer months."
"For all of my distaste for the cream ale genre, I am absolutely, 100%, all my heart, rooting for the fellas at Sun King... So if you're at all curious about their canned cream ale, go out and buy some! they're definitely on to something..."
"I'm upping my scores after trying it on tap, with a fresher pallet. It was fabulous. Easily the best cream I've ever had."
"Overall this would be a very nice light ale if it wasn't for the mustiness dragging it down. There really isn't anything offensive, nor is there anything of merit. I'm not even sure if I would be able to pick this out in a blind taste test vs. a group of American Adjunct Lagers."
"Overall this is a nice intro beer for people first getting into craft. It's good for warm weather but I believe that this beer is best out of a can."
"I'm a fan of Porters, Stouts, and IPA's, but sometimes you just want a clean crisp beer. This fit the bill pretty well. I got a can at an Indianapolis Indians game. It pours a nice golden color with a thick white foamy head. Just the right amount of carbonation and a good clean hop finish makes this a great summer session beer. I usually attend two or three Indians games a month so hopefully they continue to sell this, the Osiris Pale Ale, and the Victory Amber."
"Pours with a white head that hangs around 1.5 fingers thick. It's light golden color. The smell is of light malt balanced almost perfectly with hop aroma. The first sip reflects the smell exactly; light malty goodness balanced with hops. Have to say that this is hoppy than other cream ales I have had...it's definetly a good thing. This beer is super easy to drink and perfect for the a sunny day out on the deck."
"Clear, dark yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves big scraps of lace on the glass. The nose is untoasted grain and mild floral hops. This is by no means a hoppy beer but is still the hoppiest example of the style I've encountered. Light grainy flavors with a splash of hop bitterness to balance. Finishes squeaky clean. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. An easy drinker."
"Pours a very nice light yellow with some nice head and lacing. Very competing scents between the malt body and the English hops (Fuggle?). Very jerky-hop flavor, with the hops running wild over the malt; decent malt backbone with a decent sweetness, but would've been better with less hops. Goes down fine, nothing great, nothing bad."
