It's definitely better than some of the other 'lawnmower' beers that people seem to love so much. Seemingly would be perfect for college frat parties. Or just when you want a cheap refreshing beer that does just enough to be decent.","MVG7113","Mar 22, 2015"

And i would include Genesse Cream Ale in that echelon. Nothing stands out about it per se, but what is there is exceptional for the price ($13.99/30 pack). Very clean aromas and flavors between grainy malts, creamy corn, and a slight hop presence. Yes, i said it, hops! As if that weren't surprising enough, this beer is also exceptionally smooth considering the style. Overall one of the few beers i purchase in this price range, the others being Yuengling and PBR.","Bone53","Sep 29, 2014"

Initial reaction to smell was light beer smell that is pleasing to the nose but not over powering. Overall taste is enjoyable with a sweetness followed by a mild hopiness that balances out nicely. Very enjoyable on a budget and has a level of complexity that you can appreciate in a large production beer that is rarely scene these days for companies that have been sold to large beverage conglomerates. Its starts sweet and then the hops kick in and then finishes smooth, which is a nice play on the palate that made the overall drinking experience very enjoyable. It retains its character throughout the whole 40oz and unlike Budweiser seems that its integrity has been left in-tacked since the company buy out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who can appreciate a cream ale and who wants a quality product at a reasonable price without sacrificing taste and refreshment.","MRHviolin16","Oct 01, 2013"

The flavor is pretty much exactly like the nose suggests. It's a soft and creamy with banana and apple playing a big part. Despite the fruitiness, its not as sweet as some other cheap American lagers. Carbonation is low to moderate.","BeerZack","Jul 08, 2013"

Seriously had to stop and continue the pour multiple times because it kept wanting to run down the side of the can and onto my jeans. Anyway, Pours a very adjunct like medium yellow with a two finger bubbly white head, Leaving half decent lacing. The smell was of cooked vegetables, rice, and some corn adjunct. Nothing more, Nothing less. Tasted like a light lager and almost completely follows the nose. This beer MUST have been wrongly marketed as a cream ale, Because it has no characteristics of a a cream ale whatsoever. It seriously tastes like a light lager without the artificial metallic aftertaste. Also, The beer starts to taste very heavily of rubbing alcohol as you get further into the glass. The mouthfeel brings nothing additional to the table in terms of anything. Overall, The beer isn't offensive, Definitely NOT a cream ale. However, Due to it's easy drink-ability , I'll give it a slightly higher score in this category. Would I buy it again? No.","SometimesIfart","Aug 03, 2012"

3.7,23.3,3,3,4,4,4,"Reviewed from notes. Enjoyed many times over the years, formally reviewed here for the first time. Pours a straw yellow color into Genesee Cream Ale pilsner glass with a good mix of carbonation that yields a decent head of about a half an inch to an inch. Smell of corn, a bit of yeast and general sweetness, taste is good and clean with a sweetness of corn and a very mild ale finish. Coats the mouth and tongue pretty well as it should for a cream style ale. Very good for the price and the style and lately has replaced PBR and even Lil Kings Cream Ale as my go to cheapy session beer to have on hand with the good stuff...better the the usual BMC suspects. I wish Genesee would revert back to the old school design from the late 70's/early 80's as this can/bottle design reminds me more of a soda pop can then a beer.

Even though this is a cream ale and not an adjunct lager I still feel they are both in the same league and are very similar and when comparing this with the macro lagers the cream ale comes out on top, all the flavors that are there are nice and unoffensive just like it should be, I would take one of these over any of the major macros any day of the week. I would buy this again it makes for a good session beer and it was an excellent choice for beer can chicken. If you are looking for a light refreshing and sessionable cream ale then grab a genny cream.

Mouthfeel is a little watery, but the carbonation has a good effect. While this beer is not a sample of something I would give to special beer drinking guests.

Anyway, it pours a clear straw topped by a finger of stark white foam. The nose comprises wheat, corn, and a touch of sweet flowers. The taste bases itself on this successful novel, but the director went too damn avant-garde with it, resulting in a campy, Hackers-like hard water flavor dousing the whole production and a sad excuse for an opening pull. Those poor investors...and to to think they'd just gotten over the calamity of Insidious... The body is a light with pretensions of heft, with a very light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty okay cream ale, but that hard water flavor ruins things a bit too much for my liking.

The flavors were actually pretty good for the style, corn, grain mash, pale malt, a touch of sweet malts (the 'cream') and a crisp finish with a very low hop profile.

Schaeffer, bud, coors extra gold et. al. are too similar and when I spied the genny section my gloomy outlook changed. Okay so in the end its similar to the rest, but the can is mostly green !GREEN! and it has won an assload of beer medals and its a cream ale for crying out loud! Appearance-wise it has the familiar macro-ish straw yellow pour with a fizzy white head, clear with some bubbles but not a whole lot going on. In the glass the creamy nature (mental or no) is lost so the rest of my review is canned. It smells like aluminum, with weaker scents of corn and grass. This tastes corny, but has malty sweetness as well. No DMS sweetness like high life, slightly bitter at the end and dare I say, balanced? Mouthfeel is medium, good carbonation level and creamy.

From remembering it being drunk by grown ups at parties when younger to my grand father having it in is fridge in Rochester. Now we all have joked quite a bit about Genesee beer, but for what it is, more or less a macro brew, IMO it is not a bad beer. The Cream ale is not a bad brew for a warm day when you do not want everything to be about the hops. It has an easy drinking quality to it. The brew pours to a somewhat deep yellow color with a good sized white head that loses its structure pretty quickly but holds a sheet of white that leaves some good lacing. The aroma is very subtle all around, mostly grain like malt scent, slight roast and maybe the presence of hops. The flavor has a sweetness to it from the malt, has a creamy feel, slight corn like flavor seems to come out towards the back end. Overall this is not a great brew, but I will admit that I do pick this up from time to time to have as a throw in brew when drinking with friends. Also has some sentimental value for me.","Stimack","May 18, 2008"

He said that it was the first beer he ever had which surprised me so he told me the story.. "When I was a kid in the early 70's my dad would get home from work and head to the front porch with a Genesee Cream in one hand and a cheap cigar in the other. One day when I was 9 or 10 I asked him what it tasted like and he said "you tell me" and gave me a sip. It's a memory I will never forget."

The immediate sense was that of the creamy, malty goodness that I recall from college days in the 70's. Genny Cream was really the definition of what I like about cream ales although I have come to learn that the style may typically bring heartier concoctions then that. This newer version does not deliver quite the same level of creaminess I admired during those dorm life years. There is a bit more alcohol presence and even a lemony taste at the finish.

The flavor offers a bit of fruitiness and it's well balanced by a malt and hop base that's just slightly sweet. A bit one dimensional, but it offers far more character than the basic "Genesee Beer". It finishes slightly sticky on the back of the tongue without any real dryness, but it's not cloying either. The fruitiness lingers nicely as the malty sweetness fades gently away. Lightly refreshing. Not challenging. More interesting than a lot of basic American lagers because of the yeasty fruit component.","NeroFiddled","Aug 02, 2002"

3.12,4,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Golden color with dissipating head.  Fresh malty flavor with a few hops in the back. Creamy texture and very smooth.  A well made, straight forward, economical, lawn mower beer.  Better than the macros in my opinion.","John1985","Jul 01, 2002"
3.62,20.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured with a dense, white, but thin head. This dissapated quickly.  This was highly carbonated and a rich gold color.  Hop nose was good, in fact darn good for a macro.  The taste was crisp and clean with good mouthfeel.  This is a well balanced beer that doesn't taste like it's full of adjuncts.  I was surprised as my father used to drink this.","canoehornpoint","Jun 10, 2002"
2.93,-2.3,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,"This beer is generally average in everyway, except for the cream ale style.  Body of an ale, with the flavor and appearance of a lager.  As the name implies, it does have somewhat a chewey, creamy texture.  Flavor falls short of expectations.","psugrad98","May 27, 2002"
2.15,-28.3,2,2,2,2.5,2.5,"I had a friend from New Jersey who was always raving about Genny Cream.  We finally found a bar that served it and sat down to enjoy some.  To say I was disappointed after all the hype would be an understatement.  This beer doesn't have anything going for it.  Hops are barely there.  It has an unpleasant sweet taste and an even more unpleasant aftertaste.","mickeymac","May 27, 2002"
1.96,-34.7,3,2,1.5,3,2,"Very clear light golden hue, w/ a thin head that manages to coat the glass.  Sweet corn adjunct and cooked cabbage DMS aroma. Husky 6 - row notes as well.  Definitely not appetizing aromawise.  Light in body and sharply carbonated. The very low hop bitterness leaves the beer quite sweet. The residual corn sweetness is offputting.  The finish is one dimensionally sweet and a bit astringent.  Has this beer always been this poor?  WAY too much flaked corn used as an adjunct.","marc77","May 25, 2002"
2.61,-13,3,2,3,2.5,2.5,"A pool hall in Florida I used to frequent sells this. Sweet, a bit hoppy, seems to have lots of artificials as it'll discolor anything. No odor to speak of. Oddly, it's better straight out of the can. I guess the extra metal helps. A bit thin and leaves residue behind.","packetknife","Apr 30, 2002"
2.11,-29.7,3,2,2.5,1.5,1.5,"Although not a great beer, this brew has an undeserved reputation.  A somewhat perceptible hop flavor and a surprising sweetness separate this beer from many others in its class.  One of the few "non-craft" beers that I still stomach.","Suds","Apr 20, 2002"
3,0,3,3,3,3,3,"Genny Cream isn't readily found in my neck of the woods, but I'll pick it up when I see it from time to time.  This is a decent drink, I don't care what anyone says. Its not complex, but it is refreshing.  Great to drink while BBQ-ing steaks.","proc","Feb 13, 2002"
3.25,8.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"This a one of the classics of my dad who doesn't drink much..he had one while out east about 20 years ago and it has since been his favorite ever since mainly because we can't get it in Minnesota(kind of like the old Coors mystique)..I am not as high on it as him, but it is not a bad drinking cream ale.  It does not have a cheap taste to it at all.  It is slick on the back of the tounge....sweetish, but not like a bad malt-liqour sweetish..a slight hint of a corn adjunct taste...not bad at all, but not one of the all-time greats as my dad thinks..I'd say slightly above average when compared to all the macro lagers out there.  It does have a bit of an unexpected aftertaste.","ZAP","Feb 03, 2002"
3.06,2,4,3,3,3,3,"This beer is a bit nostalgic for me...yes it was my first. At about 15 or 16, I impressed my friends by polishing off a six in about 20 minutes. You can guess the result a short while later, I'll spare the details. Also I find it entertaining that this beer has been around for about 40yrs. and recently it's a trendy "new" style for the craft segment. Better in the bottle and ice cold.","John","Oct 17, 2001"
3.04,1.3,2,3,3,3,3.5,"Notes: Ah ... the memories. I remember my step-dad drinking this stuff out of the can back in the late 70's / early 80's. Given this, I can't hate this beer. It's not all that bad, for what it is. But would I keep it in my fridge all of the time? Hell no.","Todd","Oct 16, 2001"
