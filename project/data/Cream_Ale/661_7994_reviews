"There is nothing wrong with this beer in any way, shape or form. It looks great - I'm not sure what a cream ale should look like, but this one is appealing in a tulip glass. The flavour is, well, creamy. It reminds me of Kilkenny - easy on the palate, with a bit of grainy malt and the faintest hop notes. This is a quaffable brew that would match up nicely with a Steak and Kidney pie!"
"Enjoyable to drink, would buy again or try on tap."
"Average. It is creamy and smooth. A little hop in the finish."
"Overall, its not a bad session ale but nothing I would say to be outstanding, the aroma is muted and the body is mostly grainy with a slight creaminess, thankfully not overbearing, and a bit of a sharpness, so it remains quite drinkable, approachable but not too interesting."

"Concluding I really enjoyed this beer, seriously drinkable and thirst quenching."

"O: Very appealing well balanced brew. Yes, it reminds me of cottage country, though I’ve never had a beer in cottage country though I grew up going to Muskoka in the summer. Delicious brew, fruity, dry, different from mainstream brews, full of flavor."

"Poured from the bottle into an American pub glass. A dark gold brew, just grading into light bronze territory, with around two fingers of resilient beige head. Aroma was unexpected and compelling, mainly tangy English hops (!?) propped up by doughy sweet malts, accompanied by some fruity yeast esters that recall pears and light citrus rind. Taste is correspondingly fruity and reasonably sweet, with a blood-like metallic tang. This brewery yields some nice caramel malt flavors and these shine through here, along with nutty baker's yeast, unripe peach, grape candy, pear, citrus rind, and toffee brittle. The sweet malt flavors develop nicely as the beer warms up. Light bodied and creamy as the style designator would suggest, with a semi-wet finish that features more earthy/spicy hops and hints of toast. Robust flavors for a cream ale and starts to blur the boundary between this style and an amber ale. I like my session options less sweet than this but recommended nonetheless."

"M&O: the mouthfeel is refreshing alright but definitely too fizzy for my taste, against a light-bodied malty theme and a well-attenuated dry-ish palate. This ale probably was filtered and reseeded with lager yeasts to undergo the long, cold lager-ing process, hence the higher attenuation level vis-à-vis the malty and slightly estery flavours. Not my cup of tea, but all in all this ale has shown some decent quality and flavour integrity."
""
""
"O - Decent ale."
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel - Extremely drinkable. Very low carbonation. This sort of goes without saying but...the mouthfeel is 'creamy'."

"O - its close to average but has just enough flavour to keep it semi interesting, i might not buy a 6 pack of this but not problem having it included as part of a mixer, would also make a decent option on tap"
""
"Overall- An easy drinking cream ale by Muskoka. I enjoyed the robust flavours in this brew. This is definitely better than most cream ales that I have sampled."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not to impressed but then again Cream Ales are not my favourite. I find it overly hopped and not much flavour beyond that. Also, too bad my first Ontario microbrew was basically a west coast ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Better than the popular cream ales I've tried from my province."
""
"o a great light choice. Moderately flavoured, not overly thin. A good ""everyday"" choice for the discerning drinker."
"Light bodies, not too much carbonation. Very drinkable beer, very smooth, goes down nice."
"O: An interesting beer. Flavourful but not bold and aggressive. Creamy maltiness. The bitterness lasts a little too long for my taste."
""
"A decent ale, good with fish'n chips."
""
""
""
""
"O- I am just in love with this. I inhaled a six pack in almost one sitting. I just love this, it's sonething I could drink forever. Easy drinking and flavorful."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas. This would be great for one of those hot summer days."

"Overall, not a bad revisit but nothing outstanding. This brewery shines with their newer Mad Tom ipa and the seasonal releases. This beer was one of the original lineup mediorce beers they produced before stepping up the craft experiments recently."
"Draft had a good amount of head and it was a nice amber color. Could smell a little bit of the cream, but it was the tatse where the cream came through. First beer from Muskoka Brewery and the establishment did not have much on tap. I rate this as a pretty average beer. Nothing is standing out to me oday, had the beer a coule of days ago. Good to add a new beer to my list."
"Copper-amber colour, white head and light lace. Smell is of biscuity and cracker like malt, grainy earthiness, some lemony scents as well. Taste is of biscuity sweet cracker like malt, light hoppy bitterness follows, lemon citrus notes, aftertaste is biscuity with some light hop as well. Smooth mouthfeel, creamy, lush at points, light-medium carbonation, good feel overall. This isn't bad but these guys make much more interesting options that I would pick up before this, I would drink this again if offered but it wont see much time in my fridge."
""
"O - A very enjoyable easy drinking session beer."
""
""
""
""
"I was surprised by the character of this beer. I had low expectations going in, but found this to be a nice easy-drinker with some pleasant English qualities. Would be a good gateway beer for the BMC afficionado."
""
"By far the most agreeable cream ale I've ever had, highly sessionable and enjoyable all around. Normally I avoid cream ales as I generally find them bland, but this one is nothing of the sort and is definitely something I'll come back to."
"good carbonation and drinkability. overall not outstanding but certainly enjoyable - nothing bad to say about it."
"Overall, easy drinking, mildly flavorfull. WOuld be easy to drink a bunch of these but certainly nothing profound in the beer world!"
"O - a decent cream ale that is certainly sessionable"
"O/D - Meh. I had higher expectations for this after the rebranding. Nothing too interesting and not worth the $2.65 it cost at all. Maybe better in the bottle but I wasn't willing to take a shot on the whole sixer. Easy to drink and has flavour, but not overly flavourful or tasty."
"Overall- This is a beer for the person who is just getting into craft beers, the one who is used to drinking BMC all day because this is not far off from an adjunct lager or something along those lines, this beer does not really have a whole lot going on in any aspect. The smells are muted although a lot better than the taste, and speaking of the tastes they are so one dimensional and boring this beer just screams fail. Personally didn’t enjoy it but I’ll chalk that one up to having my taste buds spoiled by amazing American craft."
"More citrus notes along with the aforementioned breadiness through and through with this beer. Incredibly drinkable, medium light weight on the palate. This has got to be a new recipie, outstanding for a cream ale. Top tier within the cream ale style category."
"d-pretty drinkable. I really like this beer and it's a great choice when you can't decide what to get at the beer store."
"D- This wouldn't be hard honestly to make a go to beer for something reasonably light, not overpowering flavor wise, nor carbonation wise. This would be a very good example of a starter ale for someone trying to expand out of macro lager! I'll probably pick this up again sometime."
"Drink - It is definitely a step above the basic adjunct lager; but it's nothing spectacular. I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"I wish I could buy it in Northern Illinois."
"saw this and was unfamiliar with it so I picked it up and gave it a go and although not a bad beer I doubt I'll buy it again soon"
"Overall, this is clean refreshing beer, nothing to complex but has some decent features. I consider this a good mediocre."
"Clear and orange/amber with an inch of light beige foam. Sticky, clumpy lace with good head retention. Looks nice. Very mild aroma, biscuity malts, light honey, with a hint of citrus. Same in the flavour, but with more emphasis (but not a lot) on fruity citrus and earthy hops. Malt flavours were light, as was the bitterness. Texture was alright, medium to light in body with average carbonation. Decent overall, but quite average."
"I found it to be a very drinkable, smooth, cream ale. There are very few ""heavy"" beers I enjoy, that don't feel ""heavy"" drinking them such as Rickards Red, and now this beer is one of them. This one will be in my fridge as one of my go to regular drinking beers."
"D - Pretty tasty, nothing completely memorable, but nothing overly offensive."
"It came out a copper-orange colour with nice white head. Good lacing on the glass. I immediately smell more hops than I remember. Floral hops and biscuit malt. Taste has good level of bitterness for the style. I think the beer has gotten a lot better since I last tried this. Nice carbonation level. Good drinkability as I ordered a 2nd pint right away."
"Generally 'cream ale' is a fancier, more marketable way of saying 'plain, ordinary, featureless beer' but in this case it actually turned out to be something rather distinct. While I appreciate that, I can't say that it terribly worked for my tastes. Still, it's reassuring to know that this brewery takes pride in offering characterful, confident, quality products."
"473ml can from the Clarke & Dundas LCBO. Pours a deep amber gold with a thin strip of bubbles that dissipates to nothing despite an aggressive pour. No lacing here. Smell is brown sugar, toasty biscuit, toffee sweetness, and apple pie. Taste is pale and caramel malts, mild fruitiness, pear skin, vaguely spicy and bitter hops, drying chalky finish. Mouthfeel is light side of medium, sorta creamy but not really, juicy silkiness with a subtle hop bite midway, parched finish, more apple on the cough. Nothing crazy but tasty and drinkable enough for me to purchase now and then. Underrated if you ask me."
"Final Thoughts: I'm not sure how I feel about this one. I mean, it seems torn between trying to be a flavorful ale and a more generic offering. I'd be willing to try some other offerings, but this one is nothing to write home about."
"This is a drinkable beer, no troubles here. I don't know how much this comes off as a cream ale. It's more like a pretty decent pale ale leaning towards being a cream ale, though it would probably be quite nice on nitro-tap. I'd be happy to find this on tap somewhere. Quite similar to the other OCB offerings, fairly well-brewed but lacking in character. Nothing wrong with it, just pretty uninteresting. Hopefully these beers converted some Molson, Labatt and Sleeman fans away from macro swill and onto some fresh, local, decently made brews like these. All were better than their big-brewery counterparts."
"Anyhow, it pours a rich amber, darker than I had expected with a fluffy white head that left much lacing. The carbonation is quite evident in the beer constantly cascading upwards. The beer's nose is quite light with an earthy undertone and no hop, although there is a biscuity malt. The beer tastes of the malt with no major hop character, with a little sweetness and a slightly off-putting aftertaste that only seems to linger if you let it by not sipping constantly. Certainly a cream ale, with a light and fluffy mouthfeel, and could easily be a sessionable beer."
"Libation: Mediocre in all ways, neither impressive nor flawed. Very sessionable as there is no serious alcohol or flavor presence to overwhelm."
"All in all, a decent cream ale, which is normally not a style I'm terribly fond of. Not something I'll purchase too often, but never something to turn down. Very sessionable."
"Overall a pretty straightforward beer. I could see it being decently sessionable. For someone else. (Not me.)"
"Mouthfeel - smooth, lightly creamy and refreshingly watery. Higher carbonation as expected for a cream ale."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer. It's a nice cream ale, and I'm not a big cream ale fan. It's particularly good with food. After tasting it for a bit, I tried it with lunch (eggs and toast), and was quite happy with the result. The beer stood up to the food and complemented it nicely. I probably won't search it out, but I'd happily drink this again. It's worth a try; it doesn't suck."
"An inoffensive easy-drinking session ale, with a pleasing hop kick, to boot, in the Ontario tradition of mild English-style ales, awakened to the possibilities inherent in New World hops."
"Light bodied and spritzy, a little bit on the watery side. A thirst quencher for a hot summers day."
"Grain and hop again to taste, but without the metal of the aroma. Passably good, could stand a bit more presence. A cut above a macro."
"D - Fairly easy drinking, well balanced, and decently tasty session brew."
"Pours a clear dark amber, some orange highlights, pretty thick and lightly fizzy off white head forms, quickly settles itself down to a thin layer, some lace spots stick to the glass. Smell is very malty, some caramel/honey sweetness, grains, bread, bit of biscuit, light citrus, a light garbage/vomity aroma, some fruity sweetness, otherwise pretty bland. Taste is similar, malty and grainy at first, quite sweet, biscuit, honey, some grassiness, light fruit, again pretty bland, dry toasty finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, moderately drinkable but nothing anyone should get excited about."
"Notes: For what this beer costs, its pretty disappointing in terms of character. Very refreshing, simple beer."
"I tried this beer on April 30, 2008 after purchasing an assorted 6 pack of Ontario Craft Brews from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured out a beautiful translucent rusty red colour with a generous off-white rocky head. The aroma is heavily grainy malt with some hoppy tones. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, slightly creamy, with a sour feel on the sides of the tongue. The flavour is roasted malt, some grassy malt, and little hoppy bitterness"
"Decent mouthfeel, maybe a bit too carbonated. This is a very refreshing beer and drinkable, I would buy this again."
"Overall I am under the impression that this brew has changed a couple times over the years, but for the best. A decent cream ale for sure, but the hefty price tag might turn people away ( $49.95 for 24 bottles) Still a good summertime brew and worth checking out."
"Bottle from the LCBO. This beer did not live up to my hopes. Both the pour and the aroma reminded me of a lager - its a golden colour with a very minimal white head, while the aroma is a subdued mix of sweet malts and grass. The taste, too be frank, is extremely disappointing. All I can taste is malt and grain, with the creaminess only coming through in the aftertaste. A nice texture on the palate, but a beer needs a lot more than that. My wife tasted it and agreed, saying well at least its better than a blue or canadian. Unfortunately, thats all I can say about a beer I really wanted to like."
"Overall a solid offering. Of the (admittedly few) cream ales I've tried, this one is a favourite of mine."
"A great classic pre-50s Canadian cream ale...true to style and fresh tasting."
"Dark gold copper with a white, pristine head. However, the foam quickly disipates, leaving just a thin ring of film. Smells a bit of citrus, candy, bread and caramel. Even a bit of golden delicious apples. Interesting. Taste is quite simple. Lightly sweet at first, with a definite malt backbone. Their is a subdued apple and lemon tartness, with some caramel sweetness. Almost a candy apple flavour. Finishes slightly earthy and bitter. The finish is definitely the best part. Crisp, and lighty carbonated, making for a very drinkable beer. Another session beer, and quite nice. A cottage beer."
"Notes: Good Cream Ale. Nothing more, nothing less."
"This is a decent example of the style. Very straightforward and unadventurous, easy to drink."
"Bottle: Poured a yellowish ale with a nice smooth head with average retention. Creamy palate with nice floral malt and low hops presence. Body is slightly above average. Overall, this is above your run of the mills Ontario easy drinking beer but it isnt a great beer either."
"An average beer, but likely reformulated since these early reviews. Smell originally malty and fruity, then plain after warming up to room temperature. Short lived head. Creamy and malty, with a spot of fruit. OK with dinner at the end of a summer day."
"In search of a truly good Canadian beer, I was delighted to see a sign for this beer as I was passing through the Muskokas. The search goes on. The color was promising, a nice dark copper, but the promise wasn't kept. This ins't an awful drink, there's just nothing worth noting about it. Not much of a smell, no distinct taste, just another boring Canadian beer, eh?"
"OK.....colour is a deep golden and it does have a slight glass cling....however modest.....sorry, this stuff is terrible, maybe I got a bad one!!!!!!"
