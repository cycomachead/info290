Same with the flavor—it comes across with a taste of light caramel, obscuring a hop kick which would lighten the beer for my enjoyment. Is this an amber ale? Nevermind, I read it’s labeled a cream ale. Still too heavy in my opinion. It felt more like a fall drinker, even in foggy San Francisco.","elNopalero","Aug 31, 2014"

Not too bitter, not too malty, nothing exotic or gimmicky, but certainly not bland and not watery. Nice body. Just right. Some people say it's a bit sweet or vanilla-y, but I'd emphasize that these are subtle qualities. Too many beers go to extremes these days. Like it's a contest to see which brewer can be the most novel, the most interesting. This beer shows how good it can be to be in the mainstream, IF it is done right. And this beer does everything right. I look forward to another of these and more from this brewer.","DKHNOVA","Jul 07, 2014"

Popping the aluminum vessel I get a huge waft of sweet malt and a very fine bubble creamy head forms. Pouring into my trusty SAPP this brew is a cloudy bright reddish orange with a very creamy orange tan head. On the taste the brew is very light and smooth. No evident bitterness just enough background to tone down the sweet maltiness. Slightly metallic bready and very refreshing. Not anything I would have paid the previous 9.99 a sixer asking price for but for 3.99 a sixer this hits the spot in the SoFla heat.","mooseisloose","Sep 02, 2013"

In a way it reminds me of Bell's Christmas ale. It's a scottish ale, when normally breweries go with something like a spiced ale for their Christmas brew. I enjoy the change up/ thinking out of the box, but at the same time, if it ain't broke don't fix it. I have been impressed Anderson Valley's beer, and will continue to try their products, even though this wasn't what I expected.","minterro","Aug 14, 2013"

The flavor has a bit more depth than I'm used to in this style. I'm used to the simple cereal grains but the caramel malts and fruitiness (from the yeast I suppose) is very welcomed here. This is definitely a beer worth trying. It's also a nice change of pace from the lighter wheat beer offerings that flood the shelves in the summer.","tdm168","Aug 07, 2013"

It could be that I was inferring the taste, as I am quite fond of strawberries and oranges with cream, but I swear that this is the most creamy beer I have had. It is so luxurious, but so sip-able at the same time. It has a slightly nutty taste which reminds me of some of my favorite coffees. Just a really great beer. I am always fond of Anderson Valley. I am not very experienced in creamy beers, but this one stood out among the others I have had. I would say that this is among some of the greatest beers I have had, as I am a stout and porter man, and am quite often disappointed with beers that aren't very dark. This beer stood out.

Somewhat malty nose with just a bit of spice. Flavor has a decent crispness, but the beer is still a bit heavy, which I guess is to be expected from a cream, but maybe not from a summer seasonal.

While I enjoyed a lot of the sweetened, creamy flavors this has to offer, the bittered, flaky finish, as well as the enormous syrupy, sludgy body, makes this one something that I patiently sipped on. I'd pair it with food in a heartbeat (think fruit-glazed butter fried lamb with sweet potatoes), but on its own, not so much. More of an ambivalent dessert than a quaffable summer beer.","magictacosinus","May 15, 2013"

It definitely has a Cream Soda like quality and it comes out strongest in the mouth & taste. The nose is definitely a more "beer-like" aroma, it's not unappealing though if you were to introduce this to someone. All in all, an easy quality drink. If you are looking for something sweeter, something that's a bit more than your typical summer-y Ales, this would be a great starting point.","caels1991","May 10, 2013"

Looks more like a regular ale than a wheat, but so what. Crisp, wheaty, malty flavor has yeasty and honey undertones and just a hint of sweet fruit. Smooth flavor has good body and plenty of fizz.

The taste brings in more of the same, with the sweeter notes unionizing for better flavors for all, and the orange being joined by some pineapple and red apple to vainly balance out the sweetness (it's a valiant effort, though).

This beer had great drinkability, it went down really smooth and it had enough flavor to hold my attention, this would make a good warm weather beer, I could see drinking three or four of these on a nice summer afternoon. What I liked most about this beer was how true to style this beer was and how well put together it was. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, I can't think of anything that I would want to change about this beer. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a nicer Cream Ale and I recommend this beer to just about anyone. Anderson Valley makes some pretty solid beers, while this isn't my favorite from them, it sure is close. My gt to Cream Ale is Genny Cream, it's cheap and tastes good, but I feel that this beer has much better flavors and overall is better a Cream Ale, but till Anderson Valley can match the price and put this in 30 packs, I will still be keeping the Genny Cream on hand, but when I want to switch it up with a better tasting Cream Ale, I will go with this beer.

4.08,11.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a clear, vibrant, ruby-hued copper coloring with a thin coat of filmy, white head. The head clings to the glass as you drink, leaving a decent coating behind. Aromas are blended well, with a mild malt sweetness and slight citrus highlight. A bit roasty on the nose, too. Flavors are a little more sweet, with a butterscotch and toffee backbone that has a good roasting to it, and gets highlighted with tart citrus notes and a subtle hops spicing. The aftertaste is light and creamy, with a peppery hop presence at the very end to clean the palate. The finish is quick and crisp, with a slight effervescence to it.

Smells bready malty up front. Some sort of lingering fruit smell in the background. Subdued spicy hops. First flavor is a big bready blast of mellow sweet malt. Flavors are very light.

3.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Half finger of eggshell cream white color, densely solid with an very even surface, settles down to a thin surface coating, the lacing comes as a thin sheet down the glass sides, slips downward with ease. Glowing filminess to the amber to zinc orange liquid, easily opaque, very consistent from top to bottom. The nose does have a strong herbaceousness to it but quickly settles down into more vanilla cream, fudge, orange citrus and toffee to chocolate notes, pepperiness and rye bread notes bloom as it warms, the peach and apricot fruit scents more dense than expressive. Medium to full-bodied, the creamy mouth texture adds volume if not weight per se. Easy to identify the vanilla, butterscotch, honey elements but it’s the pepper, garden herbs, tea leaf and country style bread which gives it complexity. The orange creamsicle pairs well with pine notes. The carbonation is active but in a more fluffy than tightly woven manner. What deserves credit most here is how it remains true to its category but doesn’t settle for “simple” and leaves it open for the imbiber to just groove on the creamy sweetness or follow the more unique elements.","farrago","Aug 22, 2011"

There's also what smells a bit like peaches or apricots. The taste is quite good, it's quite unique for a summer beer since it isn't light-bodied, but still very refreshing. The creaminess of the beer really does wonders for the drinkability. Caramel malts and the creamy sweetness are the front-runners, it does have quite a bit of a cream soda taste to it. The fruitiness also sticks around, along with a bit of spicing. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and very creamy, and the drinkability is quite good.

It tasted extremely malty, a bit sweet and nice and refreshing with a hint of dried fruit from start to finish with a nice caramel note at the end that left the flavor lingering on the taste buds for a good while.

This beer pours an amber color with a frothy ecru foam, surprisingly dark for a cream ale. The aromas aren't much of anything with this beer, but the mild caramel and vanilla are a rather welcome presence in the nostrils. The flavor is quite similar to that of a mix between an amber ale and a cream soda. There is a decent amount of sugary cream flavor as well as a decent amount of vanilla on the palate with a background of a touch of butterscotch and caramel.

Tastes is malty too, nice toasty malts with a clean hop aftertaste. Also has a bit of diacetyl almost buttery biscuit flavor to it, which I don't count as a flaw. Or is that vanilla notes? Beer says natural flavor added?! This is an odd beer for summer, might be more of a autumn beer if I had to place it in a season. However, it is hot out and I am enjoying it, at least it isn't too heavy or anything like that. Very smooth, almost creamy tasting with not too much carbonation could make this a hit at a BBQ with some burgers or brats, possibly some smokey pork too.","Star80","Jun 05, 2011"

Aroma of light sweet malt with notes of allspice, clove, and vanilla. Palate is a medium malt profile with a slight metallic tinge and a hint of hops, accompanied by some mellow spices - mainly vanilla and clove. Body is actually a little thicker than I like in a cream ale, but not too much to handle. A tasty brew, much more interesting than I was expecting.

Aromas are very subtle, but what I pick up are caramel, vanilla, and sickly-sweet soured malts -- not exactly appetizing, but interesting nonetheless. The taste is sweet, but not in a cloying or overpowering way. Absolutely no hops to speak of, yet I would not call this a malt-bomb. There is a certain nuttiness and that same bowl-of-water-and-barley-that-got-left-out-in-the-sun-too-long characteristic that I picked up in the nose. At the finish there is a distinctly vanilla cream-soda flavor that brings it home and the toasty malt aftertaste ties it all together. Mouthfeel is heavier than expected, but still on the lighter side of medium-bodied with enough carbonation to make you pay attention. Creamy as well, of course. Super drinkable. Nice summer brew!

It is such an easy-drinking, smooth, non-aggressive beer, that you could down a six pack (especially in the hot summer months for which it is intended) in no time. It is a slightly hazy golden coppery color, with a little caramel sweetness in the nose. The taste is more of the same -- a light honeyed or caramel sweetness that indicates the light roastiness of the malts, and enough hoppiness (not much) to keep the beer balanced and the finish dry enough to want another sip. This is your dad's beer, only better. I, for one, like it. NOTE: This would be a GREAT brew to start converting a macro swill drinker.","bultrey","Oct 20, 2005"

Light hop spice backing. Malty flavors up front: doughy sweetness and some spice (?). A little vanilla-y flavor. Turns pleasantly and moderately bitter with baking spice and yeast.

Dark with no head Not at all what I was expecting from a summer brew. A bit too thick and creamy malty to be a summer session beer. I could really see enjoying this more on a cool fall afternoon. Or in the spring after drinking imperial stouts and barleywines all winter. This is not as boring as most summer beers, just doesnt fit with me in the heat.","sacfly","Jul 16, 2005"

In the mouth it's medium-full bodied, and creamy smooth across the palate with a moderate carbonation the just lightly tingles the tongue. The flavor delivers a sweet bed of vanilla-cookie-like malt that has just a hint of caramel to it, and a delicate yeasty fruitiness that's reminiscent of strawberries.

Taste: Ah, nice kick of creamy vanilla upfront, encompassing my entire palate, the middle brings out the vanilla even more by being balanced out against a black peppery hop profile, and some soft malt sweetness.
