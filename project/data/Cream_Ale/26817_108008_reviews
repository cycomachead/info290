"On tap at the Saratoga City Tavern 3/31/15."
""
"This is medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. I get the imperial cream ale and think the idea is cool but im not really getting the coffee other than a bit of vegetative aspect. I think the concept is cool and I really wanted to like this but I think its a rare miss from carton."
""
""
"This is an outstanding brew.  Easy drinking"

"Yeah.  You'd fool me.  Tastes exactly like oversweetened  coffee with cream. Head even looks like a latte. It's a novelty but a good one.  Really doesn't conform to any category. Cream ale? Warm, silky coffee stout? Not getting enough coffee astringency to be sure and edges too sweet."
"Way to sweet for me.. Coffee flavor was fun though."
"Thick, amber, nice lacing. Smell is a little bit of cotton candy and something vegetal; no coffee coming through. As it warms, alcohol starts to pop. Flavor is sweet, vanilla taffy, where's the coffee? Thick, slick, a little cloying. Cold the alcohol is hidden but it comes out as it warms. I expected a novelty beer, but I also expected coffee. I got the former and not the latter. Glad I got to try it but this is my least favorite Carton beer thus far. I prefer the pumpkin scobeyville cream ale - which seems to come from the same general recipe - by a wide margin."

"Something was off to me."

"Possibly one of the most interesting beers I've ever gotten to try. Pours a light yellow with a white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of sweet cream and coffee. The taste was just like a coffee with two sugars and cream, I still don't know how they got that flavor with that color of beer. Still scratching my head over this one."

"Overall -  Strong like me, the way I like it.  Drinkability is hindered because of the over the tops sweetness and fullness.  I give it a bump up for originality."

"Great bitter coffee favor and smooth"

"Very odd beer. I am glad I got to try it since it is just such a strange brew, overall. I do not get the high rating, however. It is not bad, but I think it is just ok. The coffee and cream ale style do not play well together, in my opinion. The smell is strange and has little coffee. The carbonation is nice and left nice lacing, but it is not a well-integrated beer."
"I don't understand the hype here. It would be a solid imperial version of a cream ale, but I got absolutely no coffee from the aroma or the taste. Big disappointment considering all the high ratings."
""
"Full disclosure. I'm from NJ, but I take my coffee black. Maybe this one just isn't for me. 077XX on the other hand..."
""
"The coffee flavor is so odd. It just tastes like carbonated coffee. Almost like pop like carbonation. I seriously can't figure this beer out it."

"Pours a hazy orange-gold hue with a thin band around the shoulders.  Nose expresses light, toasted malts with some vegetal coffee notes.  Taste is a bit strange - coffee, but lacking the full body and malt profile usually associated with coffee beers.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive carbonation.  Overall, an interesting beer but not my thing - just not really feeling the Imperial Cream Ale thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overtly sweet, malty and hard to drink. It lacks carbonation. Heavy on the stomach, all cream and no coffee. It's like a malt liquor on steroids. No thanks!"
"O: An unusual beer, and hard to score. Not much of a to-style cream ale; too strong, and (obviously) featuring a distinct flavor additive. But the corn-based sweetness and alcohol notes bring immediately to mind Genny cream ale. In the end, the flavors ultimately don't quite gel, with the unique sweet/coffee profile giving way to cheap, corny alcohol notes. Lower ABV might serve this brew well."
""
"O: A nice novelty beverage but not something that would ever be sessionable. Shared this with the wife and both agreed a full pour would be tough to finish based on sweetness."

"Sometimes a beer tries to do a lot and sometimes a beer tries to focus on something and do it well.  This beer focuses on doing one thing well.  On paper it all lends toward a complex experience.  Big 12% imperial cream ale with two kinds of coffee thrown in to the mix.  The look is golden with a small off white head that fades and leaves small spots of lacing.  The nose nails what it sets out for, it's regular coffee and this would fool me for the real thing.  If like a bit more punch, aromas are muted but what's there is great.  Creamy sweetness up front gives way to bittering coffee notes and a blended coffee with milk and two sugar taste.  It's not overly complex but it absolutely nails what it sets out to do.  Mouthfeel is creamy with some slightly dry feel in the finish.  This beer is fantastic in its simplicity.  The color, flavors and aromas all work to achieve that experience of a beer that represents a regular coffee."
""
"Overall: One of a kind and just awesome. The roasty coffee really balances out the sweetness. It's definitely not cloying and I like sweet beers, so this just works."
""
"Color deceptive. Sweet milk scent. Dunkin' on beer. Super creamy and sweet coffee. Hides ABV well, leaves me wanting more coffee. Great nonetheless."
""
""
"This beer fits the bill 100% to a T as described by the brewer. I'm strictly a black coffee kinda guy, but this was still very enjoyable from the nose through the finish. Well done and a must for anyone who's a fan of coffee."
"Light amber color with a slight haze, and a foamy white head that fizzled down to a tiny ring; minimal lacing. In the nose, Caramel Cremes and distant coffee, booze. The taste was...really pretty bad. Sickeningly sweet caramel and sour cream, cake batter, fusel alcohol, sweet corn, some roast, but any coffee in this was really an afterthought. Mouthfeel was slick and syrupy, with a body like a half-flat soda. The high ABV was definitely there--maybe not all 12%, but it was definitely boozy. Overall, this was a revolting mess. Glad I tried it once, but never again."

"This is beer nirvana.  Great beer, real smooth, creme is great.  FIND IT!"
""
""
"Overall: Comimg into this brew, I heard good things and had high hopes. Overall feelings reveal a great brew. Delicious coffee beer, roasted malts, sweet flavors, everything is great in balance. Would totally have again, but my luck and timing, I may be s**t out of luck. I will be searching for this beer again. I will recommend to everyone and again will search for more of this delicious brew! Cheers!"

"This is a very good coffee brew, but clocks in just too sweet for my tastes."
"Always impresses. Like a cup of coffee in the morning"
"This is one of the most unique beers I've ever had. So tasty, rich, and excellent."

"Really unique beer and hides its 12% exceptionally well.  Not usually a fan of Carton stuff which to my palate can be overhopped and unbalanced, but this is a home run.  Only thing I disliked was that the finish was quite sweet.  It definitely evoked the last sip of a ""regular coffee""  but I thought it may have been just a bit too much."
""
"Overall: Excellent, lives up to the name.  Except it's a good cup of coffee, not a crappy cup of coffee.  I'm loving what Carton is doing!"
""
"Just as described. ""Regular Coffee""  in a beer form, with a 12% kick"
""
"O: Really good beer, nailed the style.  Not the most earth-shattering beer I've had, but I respect the buzz and would definitely get this again."
"O- It is a big brew in two ways. A hearty 12% abv beer and a strong coffee that holds up to the milk and sugar. Beware of the sneaky alcohol content."
""

"As a coffee beer this is just average. However, as a cream ale, this is unbelievable! It depends on how you categorize it but as its listed, its hard to say this beer isn't top notch!"
""
""
"Really just average all around. I completely don't understand the hype on this one but more power to Carton for getting another beer on the map. Love Boat Beer dearly."
"O: A very unique beer that everyone should try. Cup of coffee in a can and its delicious."
"This beer is pretty much exactly what a coffee ale should be. I don't prefer sugar in my coffee so its a little sweet but it works. At 12%abv this beer isn't boozy at all. This is a must try for anyone who has the chance. I picked up a growler tonight and am extremely happy about it."
""
"Very unique, and the ABV is more hidden than almost any beer I have ever drank. Great mouth feel, and it absolutely tastes like a heavy cream and sugared coffee."
""
""
"With a beautiful honeyed color and frothy white head, Regular Coffee is certainly very inviting. It's got a sweet and malty aroma, with a bit of citrus, a hint of coffee and perhaps even some light hops. The taste is very bready, and it's certainly identifiable as a cream ale, however, the genuine coffee flavor definitely comes through enough to make it very unique. What's crazy is that it's so soft on the palate, and the large ABV % is essentially undetectable. Very dangerous to have a few of these and not realize the magnitude of what one has just drank. But truly, a marvel has been crafted here, I am proud that this was made in my home state. A must try if you can obtain it."
""

"An extremely unique beer that I had the pleasure of buying from the brewery this past weekend. The beer has an orange tint to it that doesn't match up with the earthy roasted nose that is accompanied by a slight sweetness to it. The mouthful is fantastic and has more carbonation than one would think from looking at the beer initially. It envelopes your mouth with a wonderful sweetness that I have no beer to compare it to and a slight roasty bitterness that is enjoyable and doesn't linger. You would not believe this is 12% if you were not informed of it. This is simply a great beer that people of any style preference would be inclined to enjoy."
""
"Not a big coffee guy so take that into rating."
""
""
"t/m/o - 12%?  really?  so easy drinking, i'm shocked.  the brew is really nice, it takes a well made cream ale (a style which when made well is actually rather tasty to me) and then slams it with a soft spice forward coffee.  very tasty and very enjoyable.  i'm not sure i understand all the hype surrounding these little releases but i did enjoy the beer very much."
""
""
"Syrupy sweet with a little coffee finish."
""
""
""

"O: Another great, original beer experience. A must try. Can become a classic."

"If someone just handed you a glass of this, you would think it was a DIPA based on color and head, though there is minimal, if any, lacing. But one whiff and that classic coffee smell takes over, filling the nose, accompanied by a slight hint of sweetener and maybe some caramel. Wasn't expecting it to be as sweet as it is though, though maybe I just enjoy my ""regular coffee"" a bit more on the roasted side. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, stopping just short of cloying, but the carb levels are perfect. Can't believe this is 12% ABV though, drinks MUCH lower than that. Unsurprisingly short finish. Really good beer, would love to try on tap."
""
""

"I was utterly shocked at the commanding presence of coffee in this beer. And yet it was not roasty at all like you get from Founders breakfast stout, Ballast Point victory at sea, or Evolution rise up. Instead, you get exactly what the label says... A cream ale with coffee. It certainly fooled me for being 12% abv. If you asked me to guess, I would probably say half that. Buy as much of this as you can despite the $15 price tag for a 4-pack. Your taste buds will thank you."

"O: There is nothing else to say besides commend Carton on this beer, an amazing beer that litterally tasted like a regular jersey coffee, I was super happy I got this and very pleased with the outcome of this beer from Carton."

"Good lacing all the way down, pale copper hue with a perfect clarity. Smells of fresh cold brewed coffee with an edge of toasted malt and alcohol. Mild coffee flavor throughout, some malt sweetness with in the creamy full-ish body. Very warming alcohol, sweetness lingers and so does the coffee flavor. In the end ... this does taste like a Regular Coffee, with a kick of course."
""
""
""
"Color threw me off a bit as it's lighter than i expected, i like it when a brewery can surprise me. Light bodied, easy to drink and 12%? You bet! Gingery, coffee and milk flavor plus a creamy body make this one a winner in my book."

"O/D-One of the more interesting beers from the EBF. A perfect beer to sample. I don't know how well I would do with a lot more of it. It' sure is interesting."

"O - They did Jersey proud with this beer. Everyone up here knows what a ""regular coffee"" is. This one nails that description - coffee with cream/milk and two sugars. I wish my coffee each morning was this nice."
""
"My fiance was skeptical that we went out of our way for this, but ordered her own after trying mine. It really is as it's described."
""
"Overall this tasted like a smooth iced coffee from a national chain. Except it's a beer. A NJ cup of coffee with tons of sugar and cream in beer form. Where's my pork roll and cheese?"
""
""
"An interesting coffee brew that does not have the roasted malt and dark flavors associated with chocolate beers. It tastes more like a coffee syrup drink."

"1/22/15 EDIT: and now it's in cans! absolutely incredible beer. one of the best I've ever had."
"I felt middle of the road ratings were the only appropriate thing to give this, as I feel it probably is doing what it set out to do, but that thing is so odd. I'd rather no longer talk about this beverage."
