"four-pack of pint cans from LW ABC"
""
"Looks like a nitro beer. Thin line of creamy head atop a calm copper sea of ale. Smells buttery and sweet. Tastes quite the same, very smooth and rich. I tend to enjoy these pub ales more than the next guy. Unless that guy is a Brit or Irishman."
"Fantastic, smooth, creamy head with a great mouthfeel and then...pub ale, blah.."
"reminded me on genes see. not cool"
""
"the downside is  very artificial flavour aspects and little aroma"
""
""
""
""
"Sweet flavor nice bite actually recognizable for a cream ale"
""
"Outstanding cream ale. Almost tastes like butterscotch at first . Perfect for all Irish holidays. Don't tell your friends it's English made."
""
"The flavor profile is reasonably intense, not complex and is poorly balanced.  It begins with a non-sweet caramel note that is almost covered by grainy undertones.  The middle is slightly bitter and has an earthy hop flavor that seems stale.  The finish is slightly astringent and that stale hop flavor lingers.  Stale hop flavor dominates this one, and not in a good way."
""
"Wexford is beyond smooth, and very easy drinking. Watching this beer cascade is just beautiful. Definitely a new favorite"
"Beautiful pour.  Light brown with a reddish gold hue and extremely dense creamy head...which is to be expected with these ""draft pour"" type nitro cans.  Reasonably good malt nose and flavor, but definitely not meant to overwhelm anyone's palate...okay, we'll say bland.  Obviously intended to be a pub drink that can be knocked back for a while.  At 5%, this is a little more substantial than some other similar offerings, but it still lacks flavor and mouthfeel.  Disappointing.  Although I wasn't expecting much to begin with the pour and nose made me think it might be better than it was."
""
""
"This is just not a good beer. I can't place the taste that it reminds me of just kinda sweet watered down and just no."
"It's an interesting beer. Not my favorite, but different."

"It came in a nice can. I like the cans appearance. It's golden in color with very little head. I might have kept it in the freezer too long. Had a little ice. Roughy an hour and a half. It had very little smell. Taste is decent. Expected more from a creme ale. Not bad though. I would drink this beer again."

"I used to drink this one a lot but it does not appeal to me as much as it did 10 years ago. Changing palate I presume."
""
"It tastes nice but it is a bit too bland and sweet, but not necessarily with a big drinkability. Anyway worth trying."
"Overall- Easy to drink but a little bland. Great appearance and feel but the flavor needs a little tweaking."

"Love how this nitrogen pour beer goes from cloudy white to a golem colored beer. You can see this unpasteurized beer with good carbonation. A good half inch thick head of foam with small,tightly packed carbonation bubbles. Light cereal grain aroma. Mouthfeel is somewhat chalky and there's a sweetness that seems out of place in the beer. There's a faint cereal grain flavor that diminishes rapidly. The memory of this beer is better than this."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer and it's one of the ones I keep constantly stocked at the house! Served in a can that kept the beer very well, let's out a satisfying froth and hiss when opening. Amber in color. A very smooth beer, sweet, earthy flavors with a very very light bite at the very end when swallowing. Keeps a very strong, frothy head for a long time during drinking. The exact opposite of a bitter IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: The nitro-can turns an ordinary English ale into an interesting beer—one that has a particularly pleasing mouthfeel and is very easy to drink."
"O: I found this one to be real easy to drink and enjoyable though this is a style I likely enjoy more than a lot of other folks using this site. I like the bitterness towards the finish that lingers. Pairs well with snack foods while watching football this Sunday afternoon."

"Just not much here to talk about. Pretty bland."

"The Wexford Irish Crème Ale is decent. It is a nice change of pace from U.S. based beers. The beer pours a clear amber with finger thick foamy head which is leaving a spotty lace. The scent is dull with English noble hops being present. The taste is a smooth creamy flare with not a lot going on. Definite malt presents with some hops for balance. The mouthfeel is medium in body and flat. Overall it is ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Huge head, and plenty of thick lacing. Nose is an unpleasant combination of dish soap and sour wood. Flavor is bready with a slight hop and slight hint of indistinct sweetness. Rubberlike bittersweet finish. Overall, this is not a great quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a mild beer, but it's a pleasant one, with structure and with interest. It's also extremely accessible and very pleasant to drink. Yes, it's not going to wow you with flavour, but for what is presumably a pretty mass-produced English ale, there's a lot to like."
""
"This is a decent gateway beer and, in my opinion, better than the typical mass-produced offerings. It has enough character to be interesting, yet is reserved enough to be enjoyed after a frustrating day of work."
""
""
""
"O- Not a good beer. I'm not a fan of it. But then again, it might be nice as a cold pint at a pub."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a nitro-can into a shaker pint, the beer is a rich, crystal clear, caramel coloring with a great cascade on the pour and a dense, creamy, off-white head of about a half an inch that doesn't budge. Aromas of buttercream sweetness and roast, very rich. Flavors are light and roasty, on a thin, smooth body. Toasted grain and subtle, creamy sweet blend together well, with a slight bitterness at the very end to clean everything up. Flavors end up a bit on the light side, but very drinkable. Tangy sweet aftertase, with a slightly cloying, dry finish."
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm a huge fan of Boddington's Pub Ale but for some reason Wexford's nitro-can Irish Cream Ale doesn't do the trick for me. It's just a little to heavy in body and too sweet. Would I drink it again? Eh, nope."
""

"A nice, easy drinking ale.."

"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small, dense cap on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace stick to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, slight caramel, and a metallic aroma. Taste is much the same with a metallic aftertaste. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat but creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable, but it's best aspect is the appearance in my opinion."
"Pours a burnt amber color with a handsome crown of rich, delicate, Irish foam. Thick patches of lacing cling gracefully to the glass. Aroma is mild but clean and palatable, smelling of caramel with the slightest balance of floral hops. The flavor is sweet and slightly acidic, reminiscent of apple juice laced with caramel, with absolutely no carbonation whatsoever. It may be possible that I've tasted a flatter beer, but nothing comes to mind off-hand. Mild bitterness can be detected in the finish, but the whole affair is far from what I'd consider balanced. The caramel and apple juice waver back and forth on the palate with little else to wrest one's attention. The presentation of this brew was excellent, but the flat, one-dimensional flavor just doesn't back it up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is, lackluster. The beer has a somewhat flat taste which gives it a lower rating from me. If the carbonation was a bit stronger, I think I would enjoy it much more. Overall the taste is smooth and not bitter, with no real after taste or lingering effect. It does have a really beautiful red color to it, which gives it a great look - minus any real head at all. Overall, I would say a 2.5, but it is not terrible and would not be so bad to try if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I couldn't really get into this. Bottom line: tasted a little to much like church wine for me. Almost doesn't even taste like a beer by the end of it."
"O: I couldn't get the thoughts of creamy apple juice out of my mind while drinking this; the metallic presence was definitely a turn off on this one, but the easy drink-ability makes this a decent beer"
""
""
""
"O- I docked it for the metallic taste I got in early sips, but this beer is actually pretty good."
""
""
""
""
"Good God. This is the worst beer I have had in ages. And I'm thankful I haven't had anything nearly as bad that I can recall in recent memory. The beer looks awesome, but it tastes like a malty mess with minimal bitter tones and hardly enough hop influence. It's just...bleh. Nasty. This one is going down the drain."
""
""
""
"Would recommend!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Obviously not a life-changing beer. However, it is very sessionable. I wouldn't mind drinking a four pack of this while outdoors, watching some sports on tv, or even just chilling with friends. It's not the kind of beer you rave about, just the kind you enjoy. I like it for what it is."
"O- I probably wouldn't try this beer again, but it wasn't all that bad and the joy I get out of watching the bubbles due to the nitro can makes up for it's mediocrity."
""
"O - Keep swirling it as you go, like us it loses a lot without its head."
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty one-dimensional but good for what it is. Very easy and fun to drink."
"This beer pours a foamy, caramel color with a billowing, rolling head. It's aroma is of pineapple with a hint of milk. The flavor has notes of butterscotch and thick, heavy cream with an acidic, slightly sour finish. The mouthfeel it thick and creamy like whipped cream. Wexford Irish Cream Ale isn't a real good beer, not recommended."
""
"3.5 D: Not a big fan of nitro beers, but this one is pretty good."
""
"Overall a super creamy and decently flavorful Ale, one that I will most likely enjoy next St. Patty's day..."
""
"Taste: It has that creamy taste with a little bit of caramel, fruits and a slight bitterness. The creaminess balances out any bitterness this has. Like Guinness this gives the impression of it being heavier then it really is (not that that is bad)."
""
""
""
""
"If you can't stand a nitro can, stay away. I do love a nice IPA and this is the exact opposite of an IPA but I loved it. But isn't that the great thing about craft beer - the different tastes and mouth feels that span the spectrum."
"This stuff is actually pretty descent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"BEEN TO WEXFORD NOT GOING BACK"
""
"Overall not bad, drinkable, no harm in having it, but probably wont grab another one in the future. This doesn't grab my attention very much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So this beer is far from profound. Still enjoyed it, more than most, apparently, but not as much as other nitro cans such as Young's Chocolate or even Tetley's. Worth a shot if you like this kind of thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Could use more carbonation, feels a bit slick."
""
"Fruity, slight bitter aftertaste."
"I liked this fairly well. Thanks to the nitro, the pour and the mouthfeel was almost stout-like, though in reality much lighter. Bronzed amber in color, cascading nitro/carbonation, with a finger of creamy white head, when all settled. Sweet malts in the nose, caramel, popcorn. Taste of toasted grains, corn, sweet malts, light notes of peach and apple skin giving a bitter quality, with a definite earthy hoppiness mid- to end-palate. Medium mouthfeel, ""thickness"" from the nitro is an illusion, but still works. Overall a nice, drinkable beer."
"This one pours a very murky honey cream gold in color that eventually settles down to a very clear and rich gold in color. The aromas consist of a good amount of malt and and toffee sweetness. It's pretty appealing. The flavors are very watery. You get a moderate amount of sweet, toffee esque malt with an ever so light bitter finish. The watery aspect, nitro can or not, really takes away from the potential flavor. It needs to be fuller in body and perhaps a bit richer. It's very, very light in body and the nitro can actually takes away from the beer. It started off pretty well, then quickly went downhill. I can see how drinking it would be easy though."
"Overall, not too shabby. Flawed like the dickens, but that is ok -- this isn't perfect brew. A bit too sweet and caramel covered for a traditional bitter. If you can see past that point, you'll be ok with this one."
"Overall: i enjoyed it and would recommend it to most people. Not a bad taste, great mouth feel, i would purchase again."
"O- It's not bad but I think that there are better nitro beers out there."
"Overall Drinkability - First of the style I've had, I believe, so I'm rating as a beer (or at least to analogues) rather than in the specific style. Very creamy, smooth with no bite or sharpness. Makes a great desert beer."
" I like the flavor, it has some mild malt and light bitterness from the hops, but the main flavor influence is the yeast which gives a slight fruitiness and hint of caramel. The overall drinkability is good as this is a decent brew, but pretty average for the style"
"O- Can't recommend this beer. It just doesn't seem to do much well."
"Overall I'm not impressed. I'm always happy to try a new beer especially one considered a ""classic"" but I don't think I'll have this again."
"Overall: This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite beers ever. I find myself seeking it out in any specialty beer store. I normally HATE nitro-beers (Guinness, Murphy's, Boddington's) but for this beer, I couldn't have it any other way. It's a cream ale, and meant to be enjoyed that way. As pure, uncarbonated, heady cream."
"Body is creamy and full, oddly bitter, grainy and harsh, some sweetness on the front, overall weak and nasty. People drink this beer? I don't like it at all."
"O-pretty good. I have only had a few cream ales and I do enjoy the style. It's subtle, very creamy, and looks delicious. Enjoyable brew"
"Pass."
"This beer was pretty cool, I loved the fact that it was in the nitro can similar to a Guinness. The pours was awesome on this brew. It was just like watching the pour of any other nitro brew but it's always amazes me. The color of beer is a light copper color with a very creamy white head. The lacing sticks nicely to the glass. The smell of the beer is a bit subtle, some sweet malts on the nose and a few other fresh grains. The taste is a bit weak but gives off a good creamy mouthfeel. Overall this beer it worth trying I think. I'm glad I did for sure."
"O: Although a nice beer I found this Ale to be empty on flavor but full on mouthfeel and appearance. Too little hop flavor/involvement. Intriguing was the fruit notes."
"I'm impressed with this beer. Great dessert beer!"
"Overall: I am afraid this one was a disappointment all around"
"Overall: Not a bad beer and not very complex either. I can certainly drink this but I don't see myself buying any in the near future."
"O: Smells nice but the flavor was pretty disappointing. Don't know if I'd be interested in having this again."
"Thanks to IlludiumQ36 for the sample!"
" ~ If your a fan of the style you'll likely enjoy this brew. The nitrogen infusion really makes for a smooth texture and soft finish. In my opinion I don't think this to be an all that drinkable brew."
"Overall, it was a decent beer. Something that would go well with a heavy dinner, but I wouldn't drink it outside of that."
"O - A brew that I am glad I tried, and may try again if I see it on tap in a pub but won't seek it out again in a nitro-can. 3.5"
"Drinkability / Overall: High marks for appearance but what lies under the appearance is not great. Maybe there is reason this recipe from 1810 was left in 1810. It didn't quite work well with the meal I had (porkchops and snap-peas) but maybe with the right meal it would work. No, one is enough - I can't see having more. Neat to try for the appearance and the fun of a nitro-can, but that's it."
"Poured a bubbley amber color with a little bit of white head on it. Aroma is not real strong, some malt, maybe some honey to it. Taste left a bit to be desired. Very sweet and slightly bitter. Didn't really care for it. Light bodied beer. Couldn't drink too many of these. Worth a try on St. Paddys day, but I probably won't look for it again."
"D: super simple, super drinkable. almost too light is my only real complaint. however, i know this is supposed to the status quo as far as english bitters"
"Overall a very drinkable brew, I prefer this to anyother in this style that I've had! Would gladly pick up regularly!"
"Overall a good English cream ale that comes from Ireland."
"I don't understand the decent reviews but this is a great beer to try."
"D-despite my initial reaction, i did finish this. i noticed with this one, the trick is to drink it quickly. not focusing on the tastes really helps this flavor. its actually not a bad drinker."
"D: I suppose sitting around, one could fairly easily drink several of these, although it's not one to really sit there and think about, or really enjoy. I have 3-more nitro-cans and suppose I'll finish them off over the next couple of weeks. Maybe one will be used to make a loaf of beer bread?"
"wow this beer was a huge disappointment from the pour. what a beautiful start but it was all downhill from there. won't be going back very soon."
"Pours a clear slightly hazy brownish color with a two finger nitro can head and leaveslittle or no lace. The aroma is of bread and butteriness. The taste. Is of toastiness and caramel malt with a little breadiness. The mouthfeel is a little thin but common for the style. The drinkability is okay there is nothing to make you dislike it and its an easy drink but there is nothing to make you want more either."
"D: I prefer a more quaffable brew in this style. There are more flavorful bitters in the 3.5% to 4.0% range."
"This has some nostalgic flair for me, so I appreciate it in that respect. That said, it's an enjoyable, smooth beer that doesn't really stand out in any way but would definitely be sessionable. I'd really like to try it on cask sometime."
"Poured from can into pint glass. Pours a clear dark gold with a dense 2 finger white head that results in a thick milky lacing. The nose is caramel malt for the most part. The taste is caramel, cream and light hops. Full creamy body. Not much going on in this one, but an easy drinker and very smooth and creamy. Classic Irish cream ale here."
"Creamy mouthfeel as expected, but it's not really one I would repeat often."
"It's a fine line for me when it comes to these nitro-mellowed beers. And I'm a beer drinker who usually likes less carbonation than more. In the end, it tastes okay, but the delivery of the taste just isn't my thing. Worth trying anyway, no doubt."
"440ml ""widget"" can After it all settles down it is a plain copper coloured ale with a creamy off white head. Aroma mainlly malty, cereal, slightly toasted. Taste i rather the same as the aroma, faint toasted, cereal like maltiness. Pretty nice on the palate, nothing bad. Slight bitterness at then end. Overall a average smooth drinking ale."
"I was very disappointed with Wexford Irish Cream Ale. This beer certainly wasn't what I was expecting. This beer poured from the nitro-can as a pale yellowish color. The smell is inviting, but the taste didn't live up to the smell in my opinion. I didn't think the flavor of this beer offered very much, but it's not a hard beer to drink. There are better options out there."
"A very ""full"" beer. Taste is rather simple, but the thickness of this beer and good balance makes it a solid choice."
"D - This is a good session beer. Had it on-tap at an Irish pub in Chicago area, served by Irish and British bartenders just off the boat back in 1998. I wanted to revisit it again 12 years later; still really enjoy this brew. I think love Caffrey's over this, but this is a close 2nd. Definitely a beer I love to come back to, one of the first non-BMC beers I ever tried."
"Overall, this is a great beer. I absolutely love it. I hope to drink more in the future."
"Looks a smooth dark golden color with a beautiful nitro head. Smells of caramel and heavy cream with some background toasted notes. Plenty of lactose and coffee notes come out when first tasting. This would be an excellent beer with breakfast food. Lots of malts and a bit of toasted bread at the end. Hops are present in there, but are actually quite mild. Feels as silky smooth as you could expect from a nitro beer. Borders on meal in a can, but some of that could be the heavy meal I ate with it. Would still make a fantastic session beer."
"Aside from the nitro, which we don't mind the use of that much, this is a really tasty beer. Throw this against a plate of bangers and mash ... heavenly."
"Appearance has the creamy white head lifting to one finger thickness giving way to a clear copper color. Smell is light with caramel sweetness and maybe some breadiness. Taste is lightly tinny with soft malt and hops. Mouthfeel is a creamy medium with low carbonation that makes going down smooth. Not much to it, just an easy going creme ale."
"Pours amber with a reddish tint, one finger of nitro-driven off white head. Spicy hops dominate the nose. Taste seeks briefly to start with a malty sweetness but is quickly dominated by hop bitterness. Great creamy mouthfeel, medium body, light carbonation. Drinkability affected within a very short time as the ""edge"" comes off all qualities of the brew. Everything nose/taste/mouthfeel dulls around 20 minutes."
"It is not pricey, but is a worthy buy."
"Drinkability: Pretty good flavor, however a little bit lacking in the hops department. They go down easy enough though."
"D This is a very smooth drinking beer, light on hops, or more appropriately, light on bitterness. The lack of CO2 in nitro beers make them seem less bitter. Quite good."
"Overall a let down in the most important part, taste. Drinkable but not great."
"Overall the smell and appearance were quite nice, but the flavor was underwhelming. Worth a try."
"Not that good. It's got a very light body but the carbonation from the nitro is fairly nice. The taste is really odd, it's sweet and sharp and bready. I guess there's a bit of that creaminess to it but it's fairly covered up but an odd alcohol note."
"Something about the flavor here just hits me wrong. It is just an average beer with nothing really interesting going on. Pretty boring, and not very appealing."
"D- Deffinitly a session if found at a decent price and on a nitro tap."
"This ale is all about drinkability - while a bit undistinguished, it is excellent with stereotypical fried pub grub."
"I guess I have been on a can kick of late. Decided to pick up some of this the other night. Can has the widget in it which leads to a nitro like pour. The pour produces a very creamy brew, with a thick tan head of foam that has tiny bubbles after the cascade up the glass. The aroma seems to be slightly muted but I wonder if that thick head is blocking a lot of the scents from reaching my nose. The aroma that is there is pale malt and a slight fruit scent. The taste is good, just also seems to be slightly muted. Malts seem to be the most noticeable with a very slight hop flavor. This brew drinks quite easily just for me there does not seem to be much character to it. The mouth feel is very creamy as you would expect. For me this one is something to get every once and a grey moon as more of a refresher to this brew."
"D- Tastes good cold; tastes bad warm. An average drinkability rating would be appropriate, I suppose."
"The aroma is very malty and a bit like caramel and bread. There is also yeast and some grass. The appearance is amber with a creamy head that starts out nice but turns out to be thin. The taste is like the aroma with a mild bitterness. The palate is smooth from the nitro widget. Overall a decent beer but not that impressive."
"I really wanted to like this beer and I really was excited about it when I bought it..."
"Very good drinkability. It's not the most exciting beer, but it goes down easy. Good ""session"" beer."
"D - A little rough at first but this beer grew on me the more I drank it. Depending on my mood I would have a hard time having more than two in a single sitting."
"D- went down like water... much better st. paddy's choice than the other one you see everywhere"
"Conclusion - It could just be because I don't have a lot of experience with cream ales, milk stouts, etc, but I think the creamy texture and taste of this brew is totally enchanting. Recommended; B"
"D- One of the worst pints I've had in a long while. I wasn't able to finish the glass and I wouldn't drink this again."
"I'm not keen at all on Irish brews or Irish style brews and this one sure isn't anything special."
"Mouthfeel is a bit creamy though so that is pretty cool."
"Obviously nothing special, but sure is easy to drink. I have no problem at all with this easy-drinking beer."
"All in all, I couldn't have been more pleased with this beer."
"Drinkability overall was decent at 2 something a can I will steer clear for awhile but I'm glad I grabbed a can while approaching March, so you know at the very least I had a fresh sample."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are a lot of other beers in the style that I would pick first."
"D- Definitely too sweet for the style and for my tastes. It is unique though."
"This is a type I will probably not try again."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't refuse to drink more,"
"D- It's nothing special, but easy to pound back a pint"
"I don't really care for this one."
"D: If there was a beer to drink when one was sick, this would be a good one. It is a joy to drink, and soothes the mouth and throat. It's very filling, though, so drink it slowly."
"The drinkability is certainly high. I could pound five of these, but I wouldn't. Drinkability is a marketing slogan for Bud Light, thus, not an indication of a good beer."
"Rather than chilling for 2-3 hours as recommended, I just stuck it in the freezer for 15 minutes. On this hot Australian day my first thought was that the beer should be colder, but really it is up to individual choice, whether you prefer the full flavour or the refreshment. Either way, an average beer that I probably wouldn't say no to."
"Notes: Watery finish,not really creamy at all and it just seemed to be a bad idea from the start. Not a good beer."
"Highly drinkable for sure!"
"Drinkability: I actually find this quite drinkable. Its general inoffensiveness would make it a pretty good session beer in my opinion."
"D: I can do without the aroma, and the taste is really lacking...I probably won't reach for this one again."
"Poured from a 14.9 oz. nitro can. Has a brown color with a slowly decending 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, slightly sweet. Taste is mild, some malt and hops. Feels creamy in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is not a bad selection at all."
"The mouthfeel however is quite good. It is creamy, smooth and still decently light. Besides having kind of an off flavor, the beer is pretty drinkable. It's not one that I would savor any flavor from, but if I'm putting one down quick it's not bad."
"I had tried a few cream ales before this and this isn't making the top of my charts. Sorry, Wexford!"
"Sweet and thick--slightly sour in the swallow. Light hop in the background. Perhaps the best cream ale I've tasted--reminds me of a British mild. Not complex, but tasty."
"D - Pretty good I guess. Really nothing special here. If you like cream stouts and dry stouts like I do then don't expect much from this beer. I could have drank a second, but normally I would reach for something else."
"Drinking one of these right now. Not the best beer I've ever laid to my lips but by the same token its much better then some. This one has an impresive pour coming out creamy beige with a growing transpanrent bronze color burried beneath the suds. As you drink it you notice it doesn't have alot of flavor going on, a little wheat flavor, but it's not unplesant. Overall it is pretty sudsy. Smell is also like grain. Fairly good to drink and light enough to multiples of"
"Mouthfeel is quite light. As far as the taste goes, it seems a little watered down. It has some malt sweetness and finishes with a very faint bitterness from the hops. Overall it is balanced well and easy drinking, but the initial excitement from the nitro was more appealing than drinking the beer."
"Overall I'm quite happy with this one. I'd walked past these cans for months and finally decided to try it. I wasn't disappointed."
"Overall: The mouth feel is creamy and a touch astringent. The body of the beer is light and creamy. The finish is light. The nitro in the beer is a little too much. It thined the beer out too much. It is an okay beer."
"D: I felt as this beer got a lot more drinkable with each subsequent sip. After you are introduced to the initial flavor of the can it seems to disappear, or I just got used to it. So I guess I just tasted more of the beer as I got accustomed to the canny taste. Not offensive and not that rich so a few of these could be enjoyed if so inclined. I, however, am not."
"Nothing else about this beer matches the bodacious pour and appearance. No real aroma, just a hint of muffled malt. Flavor is odd, but not undrinkable: kind of burnt tasting, almost like charred cookies. A hefty bitterness worsens the overall flavor profile. Mouthfeel was good and smooth, if you can separate it from the flavor. Not something I'd buy again, but luckily I didn't pay for them in the first place. If I feel the need for nitro cans, I reach for Old Speckled Hen."
"D - No one that I would try again (not my style) but might be good as a patio beer on a nice day outside."
"D- Drink by necessity only. The widget sounds like a jet engine when you open the can, Pour is the only nice part of the whole thing."
"D - A very drinkable if you stick with it."
"It's certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability - ok this one may have been on the shelf a bit while but still pleasant and I'd sit down a with a few with buddies and socialize"
"As far as the nitro-can offering, it leaves more to be desired. You get much more of a tinny taste up front, which really detracts from the smoothness of the beer. It also feels a bit thinner than the nitro-tap version. It is still a good beer for a can and would be in my fridge with other nitro-cans like Tetley's or Boddington's, but it really can't be compared with the nitro-tap version."
"The nitro-widget is perhaps one of the best beer inventions, next to the wide-mouth for chuggers or the ""aire vent"" on a Coors : - who pours a Coors or any other American macro brew?"
"Mouthfeel is appropriately creamy, but still light and refreshing. Not too shabby."
"The pour from a nitro can makes for such a cool visual. The cascading look is so appealing. Bone white head is totally creamy and stays around for the entire experience. Faint alcohol smell with a slight sweetness rounds out the nose. Taste is mild with a slight bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel that is slightly thin, but this beer is supremely drinkable. Tastes good with mild carbonation - an ideal session beer. Recommended."
"It certainly lives up to its' name. The nitro can helps this style and it certainly is a good example. Not your dad's Genny Cream Ale though."
"This beer poured a light brown with a lot of visible carbonation and a creamy two-finger head. The smell is biscuity malt with a little bit of caramel. The taste starts off with some mild malt with some toffee that gives way to some mild hops. Not unpleasant, but nothing that really stands out. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy to start off with thanks to the nitro widget but becomes thinner as the beer sits. This is a fairly drinkable beer, might be worth grabbing for fans of the style."
"Flavorful in certain aspects, but a but bland overall."
"D - Not memorable in anyway, shape, or form (maybe the pour and appearance)... Not bad, but not even looking forward to the next sip... Easily forgettable..."
"Drinkability- Smooth as milk, but thinner body. A good spring session."
"D: I'm surprised by so many bad reviews of this beer. I am not compelled to tell all my friends they have to go out and try it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is an everyday beer, refreshing and relaxing to drink."
"Somebody please come over and drink these last two cans."
"Overall I keep trying to get into draught can beers, but I just can't do it. Maybe it's best to save these for the pub."
"Conclusion: Not bad, but there are way WAY better English style pub ales out there."
"(rated Aug 1, 2007)"
"I like this beer's drinkability and character. Not a good session beer because of it's fullness but in my opinion a very good summer night after dinner sipper."
"Where's the cream? Solid, though a little more rough to take."
"D: Good pub hangout brew if they dont have anything better on tap. I personally prefer Tetleys if I am going to go along these lines"
"It looks like albino Guiness, sort of a copper with highlights and a VERY creamy head. The smell is chocolate and sugar and its like Ireland drifted over & ran into Belgium. The taste is like cocoa with a slight hop note. Kind of lacking, actually. The mouthfeel lacks more. Cream, cream, cream. And flat. It's too flat to be drinkable, but the nice flavor is the saving grace."
"It poured into my pint glass very creamy and cloudy. It goes from a tan color to almost a red body which is fun to watch. It has a very creamy beige head that is smooth and milky to the touch. It has a strong alcohol aroma with some malt. It is a very malty beer with virtually no bitterness. The aftertaste is slightly metallic. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy like a shake. Overall I wish it was a little more bitter but it is a great beer."
"D: This is one of those beers that seems kind of average, mainly due to its style. It simply didn't have enough character to keep me interested."
"If I had to pick a binge-beer, this would be it. For the first 15 seconds after the pour it is feels simply ethereal. Once the head develops it remains more creamy than most. It's those initial few moments I wish I could experience for the entirety of a pint. The flavor never crosses the I'd-rather-not-drink-this barrier that I've come to expect from 'Draught' cans. I'll definitely buy Wexford's Draught again."
"D- mild flavor and ABV, but the best thing about this one is the aroma. if they knock back 12 packs of this in ireland instead of BMC then a slainte joe and an erin go, i'm right there with ya."
"Pours an amber reddish color body. Big foamy creamy head, white. A sweet aroma, almost fruity. Similar to a Guinness aroma but without the coffee notes. Watery taste, bitter aftertaste, but not grapefruity. Creamy mouthfeel. Kinda bland."
"Bottom line: nothing exceptional except a thick creamy mouthfeel I haven't encountered in many other beers. This one should be easy to come across too."
"Popped the nitro can and poured into a pint glass. Lots of thick white head. Had to let the glass settle for about 3 minutes. There was still about a half inch of thick, dense head on top. Once settled, the color is gold-copper-orange. Smell is somewhat metallic, probably from the can. Taste is of subdued, caramel malts with the faintest hint of hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, quite nice. Drinkability is good. It's not the kind of brew that knocks your socks off with great flavor and complexity. Definitely worth trying, but not something I'd buy regularly."
"I love creamy ales. I love nitro pours. I love the fact that the thing in the beer can that creates this is called a widget. I love watching the beer swirl around and generate a giant fluffy white head that reminds me more of a latte than a lager. The Wexford pours a light amber, with a thick, off-white nitro head, that leaves mild lacing along the sides of the glass as I sip. The scent is sweet, mild, and maybe a little malty. The first thing I notice isn't taste as much as the overall feeling this beer has. It is slippery and smooth and creamy and feels like dessert. It tastes very mild, almost buttery. I heart it."
"It's certainly drinkable, but in a somewhat unremarkable way. A little too sweet to be a session beer. I'm glad I tried it, but I won't feel a need to do so again anytime soon."
"Sampled from a glass out of the draught can. Nice cascading that leads to a bright amber color. Thick full head with strong carbonation and minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet and faintly malty nothing grand. Mouthfeel is decent albeit i little thin, finish is crisp and smooth. Good flavor nothing out of the ordinary malty and sweet with a touch of bitterness. Drinkable but very common."
"D - I've only had one other cream ale before this one and this one is better its something different to drink worth trying sometime for something new"
"Pretty average all around. Pretty smooth and drinkable, but in the end it isn't all that memorable."
"Notes: Its head is outstanding creamy and smooth with an interesting flavor that I like a little bit more than other nitro canned beers that I have had."
"D - Again, smooth and quite drinkable. Nothing especially noteworthy but still quite good!"
"This pours a light brown color and has a creamy tan head due to the nitro can. The nose has some mild neutral malt and a bit of hops. The taste is also quite mild. There are sweet malts and somewhat stale bitter hops. The body is light and goes down smooth. I think this stuff really depends on the gimicky can."
"This one was fine, and at 5%, close to a session type brew. Give one a try."
"D: Ok drinkability but really nothing special and gets boring half way through. Could live without."
"D: skip it."
"drinkability is good. in appearance, this is a full flavored irish ale with a solid head. in texture, this is a thin and watery brew with a less than satisfying profile. the flavors come up a bit short in richness, while the aroma remains well crafted. overall, a decent cream ale."
"D: Extremely drinkable. Another great social beer. Not super interesting, but goes down way too easy."
"Overall- A mediocre offering but very little flavor. I can scratch this 1 off my Mug Club list and promptly move on!"
"The mouthfeel is less the stellar. Its not very creamy (despite the name of the brew) but it is nice and watery and kind of easy to drink. There is a fine carbonation that allows you to get it down quickly which is a good thing. A great looking beer but disappointing in the long run."
"Definitely fun to look at and smooth to drink. It's an not an overly complex beer, but I think in a true pub atmosphere this stuff would be a great fun to session and slosh around."
"It's Irish Cream ale, but the brewery is in England, and is distributed by a company in SC. This is one lost and confused beer."
"Pours an orangey/amber color with a thick, creamy Guinness like off-white head. The head leaves a thick coat all the way around the glass all the way to the bottom and the head persists until the last sip. Aroma has a subtle hop character and a little bitterness, but also a sweet malty aroma. Taste is alright. There is a malty burst of caramel and maybe some other flavors I can't pinpoint. Not a very complex brew though. Also a slight metalic feel most likely from the can. Mouthfeel is full and thick. It is still and very creamy, but very appropriate for the style. Drinkability is high due to low alcohol and subtle flavor."
"Pours the classic layered look from the nitro: faintly cloudy medium amber color with plentiful dense head. Aromas are quite mild with sweet corn, husky notes dominating. A note reminiscent or reislings is also there, slightly wine-like. An exceptionally clean ale, flavors are very smooth, really no hop bitterness, a faint grassy, floral feel, and a crisp dry finish. Overall, a drinkable, for basically a forgettable ale."
"Pours great, an excellent cascading form that leaves great head and lacing, and has a nice light amber color. Has an odd scent, though, a very well mixed malt/hop scent, but with just a slight bit of rotten aroma. Good taste, a nice English ale, but it has a bit of beef jerkey flavor. Goes down nice. It would never be my first choice, but I would not turn one down, either."
"Poured a fairly appealing straw color, amber tinged color with a beautiful nitro cascade and a finger of white head. Aroma was faint and mundane; some light malts, and a touch of hops. Taste was really quite bland. Some light matlyness with only a tiny bit of hops. Mouthfeel was good, very creamy due to the nitro but seemed flat and lifeless. Drinkability wasn't all that good. This was ok but only because of the nitro. I didn't really enjoy this beer and wouldn't recommend it."
"In summary, this ale was good and easilly drinkable. It's higher ABC will have a greater effect than some other nitro cans. It's not a bad beer, but can become thin after a bit."
"Overall: Decent, nothing special though. Kilkenney's remains my favorite, but we still can't get that in the States."
"Pours a clear orange, massive thick white head forms, very creamy, excellent retention, forms a one finger layer, lots of lacing. Smell is sweet, honey, bread, some grass, light fruits, apricot and strawberry, light floral hopping, quite delicate but nice. Taste is similar, light honey and strawberry, light malts, some bread, caramel, sweet fruity finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, nitro smooth. Not bad, solidly drinkable. Thanks Kyoko!"
"D: Would be a good session bitter or cream ale type beer, I could see buying this again for the night, it is relatively cheap."
"D- A very light beer, could be drunk as a thirst quencher, nothing to write home about"
"Pouring a nitro can is always an experience. You'll come out with a very creamy, thick, frothy head and beneath it will be an amber beer. The joy is in watching the creamy carbonation make its way up to the top. After that, the show is over and what you'll get is a very average beer that really laces it up. The smell is malt, grain, maybe some buttery notes. The consistency of the beer is quite watery and the creaminess dissipates quickly. There isn't much cream after the beer settles. The taste is part tartish hop, part sour malt, bordering on curdled lactose, and part nutty dryness. I won't be trying this beer again anytime soon. Perhaps I've never been a big fan of pub style cask conditioned ales, and maybe this one is trying to emulate that. It's not for me."
"Drinkability: Much to my dismay, this beer followed the exact same course as the can of Tetley's I had recently. Sure, it looked great and smelled fine, but in both cases it's all downhill from there."
"Really good cream ale. Not a lot of complexity but just good smooth taste."
"Really not a bad beer. A bit average and uneventful, but a good sessionable beer if you need to keep up with some other people for whatever reason."
"Could drink a bunch, but I would eventually get sick of it. Guiness gets a slighly higher score here due to the stronger flavor, though the texture is the same or better. Not bad, not bad."
"Overall: Another great offering from Greene King, smooth and enjoyable. Recommended."
"D - I ending up dumping the last 3 or 4 ozs of this brew, as I grew tired of the taste."
"A very flavorful cream stout but I find it odd that it is an Irish cream stout and yet it's brewed in England. It has an excellent pour with an impressive head. Very creamy texture and very golden color. Wonderfully flavored with a distinctive sweet note to it."
"Derinkability: Easy to drink but not a whole lot there"
"drinks very easily, but not very remarkable."
"Not recommended. Boring, and lacking anything that would really keep me coming back."
"Overall, this would be great for a long night."
"I enjoyed this one immensely,it looked great,poured very well,and was easy drinking.The only problem I had with it was the taste,which IMHO was bland or maybe flat would be a better word.I would love to try it again,but at 11 dollars for a 4 pack where I got it,I am forced to buy it sparingly..."
"Not very good on the drinkability scale. Started out OK and seemed to get worse."
"This acutally isn't that bad for a cream ale. The nitro seems to help this style. With the exception of the metallic aftertaste, it's not bad at all, and very drinkable."
"Not my favorite beer here. Too dry and generally boring."
"Don't understand why this doesn't have a higher rating on the beer-o-meter. Pours a nice amber color with a huge creamy light tan head. Mellow aroma of malt with a hint of fruitiness. Taste is big malt flavor with a hint of butterscotch, not much hoppiness but enough to balance it nicely. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. A good session beer."
"Overall this is a great beer for a hot afternoon to just sip on and enjoy."
"Enjoyed on St. Pattty's day, 2006 in honor of the saint and the snake."
"The mouthfeel is thick and creamy from the nitro, which is good, but at the same time it is flat as hell. A hint of carbonation would stimulate the palate a bit and set this beer off, but as it is, the flatness moreso highlights what I don't like about this beer. I'm sure it will work well in a half & half with something more bold, like a Bigfoot perhaps, but on its own I am not a big fan. Marginally better than Boddingtons."
"All-in-all not bad beer by any means. I just wish it was creamier, like a Pete's Wanderlust or maybe like a smooth taste of Irish cream. Ale drinkers might like this, but then again I guess that's what you can expect when the UK brews an Irish traditional Ale. Ouch!"
"I got this beer on tap, but it almost seemed more like a cask ale. It was fairly flat and a bit warmer than normal. That being said, it pours a light amber color with reddish hues in it. The aroma has strong biscuity smells, as well as a good malty background. There are no detectable hops in either the aroma or the taste. What the taste does have is more of the what the aroma offers...sweet malty flavors. This beer is actually surprisingly sweet. As I said before, the beer had very light body and a flat taste, but I'm not sure if that was a result of how it was served or not. I would rate the drinkability as average, mostly due to not knowing the mouthfeel better."
"This beer came to me with a nice nitro-fed stay-put head. It was a tarnished brassy color. The smell was a beautiful mix of sweet musty gran, herbal hop, a barely dectable yeastiness. The taste is a swirl of sturdy honey, herbal hop, and malt swetness. There were definatly some other subtleties there but I was a little to destracted to pick them out. Simple but damn delicious. Mouthfeel was of course dreamy and creamy. Was delicious with Irish Root soup."
"Pretty poundable, but I believe I'd want to move on after a couple, just doesn't hold your attention"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could session this style any day and this one is particularly tasty."
"D= interesting for a few, but not my choice for regular or long-night drinking."
"Cream ale is right! The head looks like dessert and it's not going away anytime soon. Not much to smell, a bit like cream soda. Rich and deep with a bitter, dry breakfast tea finish. If you are already a fan of Boddington's then this ale is right in that ballpark. I could drink this stuff all day every day."
"Fore feels creamy, but the flavor is watery....light fruits-apple mostly though there is some white grape-with a bit of cereal grains. Finish is stale and unpleasant. Not anything Id choose to drink again."
"This ale pours a nice bronze amber, with nice mocha-colored dense creamy head. It has a light hoppy aroma, and it goes down smooth with an obvious creamy quality and good balance of sweet and sharp flavors. I didn't note much or any bitterness, though that may just be my palate. Definitely one to share and enjoy with friends."
"Clean slightly sweet aroma. Copper in color with a consistent white head. Flavor is slightly sweet and tart, with a balanced bitterness, and a noble hop flavor. Creamy nitrous infused brew that goes down smooth anytime. A great session brew ! I'd drink a lot more of this beer if it wasn't around $ 3.00 a can at my local. I LOVE IT!!!"
"Pours a clear clean straw with a fluffy, nitro induced head. Aroma is faint, some grassy hops are present. Taste is good, it's clean. Slight tart taste in as well, and grassy hops again. Mouthfeel is appropriate, on the thin side. It's a passable session beer, but not world class."
"This is by no means a bad beer. It is creamy smooth, has a very caramel and dark fruit taste to it. There's a slight bitterness to the backend of the beer. Unfortunately the flavor isn't all too complex, and not all that exciting. It's certainly a solid beer, and by no means offensive. Mouthfeel is creamy but a bit thin, and it finishes smooth. This is a drinkable beer and worth a try. It's just not overly interesting."
"When I first started drinking good beer this is one of the first I bought. I didn't like it then. I must admit it doesn't thrill me now either. I used to really like nitro can beers. While my opinion has changed I still thin they pour a pretty looking glass of beer. This is no exception.Head is like whipped cream that stands an inch tall. Body is hazy honey and caramel. Nose is the achilles heel. At first I can smell only caramel but eventually I also get honey sweetness and a wisp of hops. I wish there was more going on taste wise, but as of now I only get some caramel, hops and a bit of sugar. There's a weird sourness in the aftertaste that I dislike quite a bit. Did I say the nose was the achilles heel? Make that the taste, and mouth too. Mouth is sometimes thick and sometimes thin and watery. I don't have plans to try this again any time soon."
"good beer but i like old speckled hen a little more, but still very good beer."
"D - Outstanding. Easy to drink. Flavor is simple, but this is an enjoyable beer. Sessionable and a natural for food. Tastes like most other English-esque ales though. I might have it again, but damned if I'm buying it."
"I have to admit, I'm a sucker for nitro cans. I'm also a sucker for a sexy looking beer, and thus, I'm a fan of Wexford. If you see the can and expect a Guiness style beer, this isn't it. This is not a Irish Stout, it's a Irish Cream Ale and it's damn good. This beer is smooth, very drinkable and has a mild yet full flavored taste. I would recommend this beer to anyone. It's a very high quality brew."
"I just love nitro-can beers. Every beer should be in a nitro-can. Beautiful cascading pour with a thick creamy head. Looks like a golden Guinness. Maybe it's the nitro cartridge, but it even smells a bit like Guinness as well. However, the taste is not Guinness. This may have been in my fridge a little long. A bit of a mettle taste on the palate. The alcohol is more vibrant here as well. Too much so for the 5.0 ABV. I don't I think I like this as much as I thought I would."
"The mouthfeel is a bit weak & watery."
"I was somewhat dissapointed by this brew. I had it at a pub on-tap the other day and at first glance, it looked apealing. I could barely finish the pint. There was just something about it that was wrong. It did have a nice malt taste but other than that, there wasn't a whole lot of flavor, and the finish was bitter in a bad way. You'd do yourself a favor by having a better Cream Ale."
"Drinkability--slides down real nice."
"Drinkability - not very good tasting, so it's not sessionable."
" Never really cared for the pressurized widget cans, because it leaves a certain undesirable taste on my taste buds. But I would definitely recommend this one all the way."
"D - It was good but a little unusual for my taste. I may try one again sometime just to see what I think of it at a later time."
"Cheers!"
"Pours pale orange amber with hazed clarity. Holds a one finger head well after the nitro ceases. Sticky patches of lace. Nitro aroma masks a typical macro aroma. Sour nitro tastes dominates, but cereal adjunct and butterscotch in the background. Extra-dry aftertaste with a hint of vannila cream flavor. Nearly flat carbonation and medium body allow a solid diacetyl mouthfeel, which is done well if you like it that way. A little light on the hops even for an irish cream ale, but aside from the slick finish it is mild and drinkable."
"Well, those nitro can beers are really impressive in appeareance, but they lose in their lack of complexity and mildness. This one was supposed to be a ultra-creamy beer, but it doesn't work. The nitrogen gives a good start, but after that the beer shows itself soapy, quite poor and over-bittered. It doesn't seem to be an ale, complex, fruity, etc... It didn´t impress me anyway."
"Poured from the nitro can that makes it resemble a pour from a Guinness nitro except for the blackness. Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a creamy light tan colored head. Aroma is creamy with buttery notes of caramel. Taste is extremely smooth and thin with malt, caramel and a metalic taste. I absolutely love the appearance of the pour produced from nitro can's and this beer proves no different. However, it is just lacking on taste and body. Decent but nothing there that makes me want to try again."
"Poured a clear copper color with beautiful head (as would be expected from a nitro can). Moderate sticky lacing. Smell is caranel malt and very pleasant. Taste is a bit flat with a distinct overpowering dryness. Very creamy with a strong dry finish. A good drink, but nothing great."
"Pours a nice gold color with a tight creamy nitro head. Smell is not very strong with hints of malt and some hops, but no real dominate smell. Taste is very much the same, a blend of malt and hops that is very smooth yet a little bland. The mouthfeel is very flat with little carbination in the beer aside from the nitro head. While I don't find this beer to be outstanding, it still makes a good session beer."
"Good beer, but if I had known, I would have but OSH and got the extra beer and no nitro tab."
"D - high, you could pound this beer very easy, in the future, this is a beer i would enjoy mroe straight outta the can"
"I tasted this beer right out of the fridge after over 8hrs in and as it warmed the flavors really came out and I enjoyed it much more so than at the cooler temp. Can says serve well chilled next time id serve slightly chilled."
"Drinkablilty: I could drink many of these, very good beer I was surprised it didn't have a higher average rating."
"Light carbonation on this can. It's mouthfeel is actually a little on the creamy side. It goes down smooth and is very easily complimented."
"Since this beer has almost no flavor or aroma, I think it would make a decent session beer. Also, with a low alcohol content, it would be easy to have a few. Not much to this beer. Better than bud though."
"Poured from a nitro can, a deep golden color developes after the nitrogen settles, a nice thick head is there at the end. A lite citrusy scent is there at first, followed by a sweet creamy aroma at the end. The taste is what one would expect, creamy sweet taste, a touch fruitiness, followed by a hint of bitterness from the hops. In the mouth it feels slightly rich, but a little more to a watery feel, and finishes dry at the end. This is a very drinkable beer a nice taste, with an excellent finish makes this a solid beer."
"The beer pours a very deep copper color with a finger of thick and creamy head over top that gives no sign of breaking up. The requisite cascade from the nitrogen settles quickly and leaves a brilliantly clear beer. I really like the fortitude of the head on this beer. Its almost a colloid. Nose is light caramel and cream, with almost a hint of banana. Very mild, but very good. Flavor is more generically fruity than the nose, with a very healthy creamy character, finishing with just a kiss of bitterness on the finish that lingers just long enough to let me know its there. The feel is on the thicker end of moderate with a very light carbonation...as expected from a nitro can. Overall, this is a very tasty beer. I could see drinking this one to mix things up from time to time, as the ABV really makes it something to session, but there is enough flavor there to make it more approachable to me."
"Overall, if I wanted something pleasant to have without wanting to think about it, this wouldn't be a bad choice."
"This beer was a lighter colored beer. There was a creamy head as is typical with nitro beers. There was a little bit of bitterness in the smell. The taste had subtle notes of bourbon in it. I asked wcudwight his opinion and he seconded that. The mouthfeel was smooth. I could drink these again but I would not make a habit of it."
"This brew has a bit of sentimental value for me, it reminds me of sophomore year of college, but then again, I also feel like I shouldn't appreciate an English brew that claims to be Irish. All in all, a very drinkable beer, I would have it again if available, although it might not be my first choice."
"Ah, say what you will about nitro, it makes for a beautiful pour, truly a sight to behold. This beer poured a copper color with a creamy head from a one pint nitro can. Smell is on the malty side. The mouthfeel is luxurious as it usually is with nitro. Taste is pretty mild, malt up front fading to a little bit of a hop bite at the end (not much of one though). Very sessionable, not an outstanding beer by any means, but quite drinkable, and most definitely worth a try (unless you are a nitro hater of course, I think nitro beers have their place, much like malt liquor and Belgian ales have a place as different as they are, it just may not be the place you are at)."
"Thin creamy taste and feel. Smooth malt taste that pleases my mouth with every sip. Easy going down with an amazingly pleasant palate. I will drink this almost anytime it's available."
"The cascade that forms when this brew is poured is excellent. It posesses a thick, heavy, cream-filled head and awesome amber-hue. The taste caught me a little off-guard though, as it was certainly more English in taste than Irish. Another look at the can revealed that this Greene King product does hail from England, although the name suggests someplace greener. All in all, a good brew; left me a little heavy at the end, though. It's a good thing this is only a 4-pack."
"D: I could drink a bunch of these, wouldn't necessarily seek it out again though."
"The color is a caramel copper. Head is typical of a nitro can, medium-sized, creamy, and milky white. The retention is, of course, excellent. The aroma is of sweet English malt, a bit fruity, with a little of that ""gassy"" nitro aroma. Wexford's taste is more of the same, English malt, sweet and mildly fruity. A note of honey is a bit of a surprise. This is better than the few creams I've tried before and is certainly easy-drinking; but then again, this isn't that great and not worth buying again."
"Pale amber in color with a frosty white head that holds together beautifully in a thick lace, lasting until the last gulp. The soft, silky mouthfeel of this beer is the first thing you notice, followed elegantly by a subtle vanilla ice cream/irish cream flavor that lingers on the palate, finishing with an aftertaste reminiscent of a shot of Bailey's. A truly unique and delicious cream ale."
"The creamy/watery texture and grapefruit metallic/astringent finish would limit my session with this beer."
"I was really excited about this brew. Damn. Oh well, I guess my expectations were too high. Poured out to a nice orange color with a constant 1/8 inch creamy head. Nice so far. Low overall carbonation. Not much aroma, if any. Some buttery and creamy odors, but not much. Taste was a bit too rigid for what I would call a good cream ale. Flavors of caramel, nuts, and some malt. Little hops. Very smooth mouthfeel, but that is expected when discussing this style. I guess this is an average brew at best, but some thicker mouthfeel and flavor would really improve this brew. Worth a try."
"A little light on taste, mellow and velvety in the mouth. Not exciting, but a very decent drink in any case. Serve this one cold."
"Opinion: Well, this is one of those beers that you just have an opinion on. As far as delivery, cleanlines, and balance...I would say that it is a decent cream ale. This is a British version, so you can't open this beer expecting to drink a Genessee. The British malts add a distinctive caramel/butter presence that is typical of British styles. It is not my personal favorite beer, but I don't drink too many of the British styles of beer. It's worth a try just to see if it agrees with your palate."
"Goes down silky smooth but almost too flat and thin. A drinkable brew, but not the best out there."
"Reddish-amber hue. Pours as creamy and smooth as Jessica Simpons thighs. Lightly toasted malt aromas with delicate hop accents. Follows through on a medium-bodied palate with soft malty flavors to the fore and a hint of hop bitters on the finish. Highly drinkable."
"Impression: Flavors are fair for style. Mouthfeel is worth shelling out the bucks for a nitro beer. Not a bold beer, so enjoy it early in your session."
"Drinkability: $8.99 for a 4-pack of cans..you're kidding me, right? Not worth it for that price..glad I got to sample a can for free. Very similar to Boddington's, but a touch better, in my opinion."
"Edit: The more I drain my glass, the more I can taste a faint touch of honey. Its there in the smell as well, however faint."
"Overall a nice brew."
"This would probably be great if it were just in a normal can. As it stands it is merely pretty good."
"This is e beer i drink quite a bit of at my local bar. It pours a clear amber, after the nitro action calms down, with a nice creamy head. Low in carbonation, it needs to be cold, its incredibly drinkable, very smooth and creamy.It lacks much complexity, slight fruits in the nose for me, but nothing amazing. I enjoy this beer when im just sitting at the bar shooting the breeze, a quality standby"
"Nitro can, widget and all, a hard pour elicits the expected creamy head and descending bubbles. This one pours hazy light amber with tons of tiny bubbles along the sides of the glass. Head is creamy off white and leaves oodles of frothy lacing. Nose is nutty, and malty. This is a light bodied ale, watery in the center. Lightly malty, hints of maple sugar on the lips. Goes down smooth and easy, fine light sessioner."
"Slàinte!"
"Nitro can. A swirling light murky dirt brown, turns into a hazy opaque orange with a full one inch cap sized white head. Hops and caramelized sugar grace the nose. Up front, a thin, yet satisfied palate  the nitro takes full affect via the decent malt flavorings, fresh fruit and some nutty offerings in the body. Pretty well balanced. Creamy and slick hops make this one well rounded; all in all a decent cream ale."
"Feels smooth going down and defitnatly something I could drink many of in a row....In fact I have been."
"Mouthfeel: Creamy, nitro feel, a little powdery in texture. I admit I dislike the sensation."
"Pint nitro-widget can. Poured a butterscotch gold, with one of the nicest reverse cascades I've seen from one of these cans. Aroma was sugary. Flavors were all of a sweet variety, without the beer being overly sweet itself- caramel, brown or raw cane sugar, toasted oatmeal. Watery in the moutfeel, but this is always the case with a nitro can pour. Overall, the beer seemed too processed."
"Pours a ripe copper-gold with thin, sticky head from nitro. Aroma of oaky chardonnay which is carried over into the flavor to marry with sweet malts and an ale fruitiness. There is a slight sharpness and sourness to the hops which is typical of many European brews. The beer is pleasantly buttery, and relatively full-flavored for a nitrogen can, but doesn't do much to excite the palate, or other senses for that matter. Perhaps it can be best appreciated as an exercise in restraint. Prolonged exposure to this beer will add to its appeal (i.e. the more you drink, the better it tastes). It may serve well as an accompaniment to a meal of hearty but bland lamb stew, or possibly a very mild cheese, or perhaps it may be best suited to soothe the stomach after a round of Jameson. Another decent nitro offering that again raises the question of when and where can I find my beloved Mansfield Ale?"
"Nitro can poured into a snifter. It pours a medium copper color with just a little bit of head. There is a touch of lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty, a little light. Some caramel aromas. The tsate is malty as well, but has a bit of fruitiness to it. There's a little bit of hops, but nothing really exciting going on. The mouthfeel is decent for a nitro beer, and the drinkability is fairly good too. Just needs a little bit more in the taste department."
"I dont like widgets, but this brew (widget and all) was better than most. I probably served it warmer than I should have, since there was an explosive discharge on popping the can. The beer is a beautiful dark amber color with the usual nitrogen-corrupted thick foam. Its got a mild, subdued aroma, thats composed of a bit of malt and fleeting hop smells. The taste is creamy, buttery, sweet, and full of caramel flavors. Nicely balanced with a hop finish. Its surprisingly good, given the disappointing aroma. Its smooth and seems a little thicker than other nitro-brews. I enjoyed this one in spite of myself."
"This is a comfort beer. It is not challenging enough to incite conflict, but it is personable enough to welcome companionship. In the end, I enjoyed it tremendously and found it to be smooth, relaxing, and highly drinkable."

"Nitro pint, light copper body with a cream colored nitro head. Light caramel in the nose, a tiny bit bready, some butter, and a hint of tinny hops. Caramel is much more subdued on the palate than it is in the nose. Bread is more prominent here as are the hops which provide surprising flavor and bitterness. Hops are a little bit metallic, but bitterness is firm. Fruity malt (yeast?) aftertaste isn't really scrubbed away because the carbonation is so low (damn nitro). All in all, a nice change of pace kind of beer."
"This had a great cascading action, yielding a big, white head. Once the beer settled down, it was a light amber color with a sweet maltiness on the nose. It had a light mouthfeel, very creamy on the tongue, with a mild honey taste at the finish. It also left behind some great, clinging Belgian lace."
"For some reason, I expected good things from Wexford Irish Cream Ale, but it had other ideas. The simple, unvarnished truth is that it just isn't very good beer."
"Poured with a whipped cream-like head, with a pretty standard nitro cascade. Smells only lightly of malt and hops, but this beer is still pretty good. The flavors are very subtle, but the creamy body makes this beer what it is. Tastes a lot like a nitro hen's tooth, not very flavorful, but still good."
"Pale gold body with a very nice creamy head. Malty aroma with little hoppiness. Taste is very sweet and malty with a strong artificial licorice flavor which I did not really care for. Great smooth and creamy mouthfeel but the flavor really ruins this brew. I got sick of the taste pretty quickly. Probably wont drink this one again."
"Very nice light pale color with a nice thick creamy head and a fair amount of lacing (about 0.5 in thick). It has a nice hoppy sweet aroma with hints of fruitiness. The taste is lightly malty. has a nice light sweetness to it along with a nice subtle hop finish. Overall a nice beer for sipping while sitting in the sun."
"Not bad by any means, but being a little bit ""more"" of everything would have made it much better."
"Light copper with a creamy head. No lacing was evident. Smell was non-distinct. Flavor was lightly malty with no distinct qualities on the start or the finish. Mouthfeel was light and smooth, and as with the taste, non-distinct. Easy enough to drink, but nothing spectacular."
"Had it superwarm out of a can. Crappy creamy shaving foam head, i'm sick of these nitro beer appearances. smooth and creamy, cat-pissy mouthfeel. Really bland and sweet aswell. Typical nitro crap. Bland, but perhaps it didn't help that it was a little warm, still, its obviously crap."
"Clear honey-coppery hue with indefinite bronze influences too. Nitrogen induced creamy off-white head. Yes, the cascading affect is pleasant to look at but the widget is such an annoying gimmick. Anyway, the head settled at two fingers in height, very sturdy, the retention was fantastic. The subsequent lacing looked liked tattered wallpaper. The nose is uneventful, largely clean; maybe the massive head is filtering the aromas! Or not. There is some sweetness, some buttery hints, and a faint mineral/metal twang at the back. The potency is very poor and there fails to be a request to quaff. The palate is bearable, it is creamy and sweet with a little maltiness in the middle, and buttery after that, in the finish an indistinguishable trace of hops might have blipped the radar, maybe not. The aftertaste is mineraly and a tad muddled. I am not that well versed in Cream Ales, at this point I have had two: Genesee Cream Ale and Little Kings Cream Ale. Thats it, thats the list. Wexford is better but the competition is not much. As a whole, the palate is simplistic (that is polite for boring). The mouthfeel is medium in body, nicely creamy, but it does fall apart at the end, a touch watery too. Typical it would seem for a nitro-can. I cant see myself buying this one again; it is not awful or anything. It is just pointless. I picked up a nitro-can on a whim in Iowa City; it was a dollar at a grocery store. Not worth buying, if you ask me."
"The color was dark gold with a creamy white head. The aroma was on the mild side. The taste was mellow and a little citrusy. The Irish malt was not too prominent. Overall it was a smooth beer with not much carbonation and it was not very bitter or sweet. The finish was slightly dry. I didn't find much to recommend it except it probably wouldn't be too bad with a heavy meal."
"Drinkability: Goes down surprisingly easy. Not something I'd necessarily buy a sixer of, but a pretty nice offering, nonetheless."
"The beer pours a perfect gold color with an awesome head; the picture perfect beer. The aroma is good. It is creamy with a malty scent. The taste is decent. It is pale and creamy with a real Irish ale flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with perfect carbonation. This drinks great. It has great flavor and awesome mouthfeel; finally an English ale I like."
"BTW- these nitro cans tend to spew when opened"
"1 pint nitro can with widget. Pours a clear golden amber with a big frothy off-white head that lasts several minutes. Foamy lacing all over the pint glass. Floral hops jump out from the nose(a major surprise) before some caramel melds in. I don't really care for the mouthfeel. It's really smooth, but seems watered down, and all the carbonation must have gone to the head. Taste is medium malty, well hopped, and smooth and creamy. Not much else. It has a malty finish that is mostly smooth, with a touch of bitterness. Light enough to drink more than one, but not complex enough to want to."
"this is pure nectar to my tastebuds. epitome of a session beer. I could easily drink this until I fell asleep in a puddle of my own drool with a hand clasped around the pint that finally did me in. (if only I could get Kilkenny in the US I could hold my own personal taste-off.)"
"Zum wohl!"
"The taste, however? Not bad. Not great, but not bad. Kinda malty, not too hoppy, exceedingly creamy, however. A decent ale, I suppose. Better on the visuals than the actual taste. Might make a decent brew at a holiday party."
"An unappealing milky brown color quickly gives way to a brilliant copper hue that is topped off with a finger's worth of light beige foam that endures long but laces little. Smell is terribly weak with mere hints of crisp grains and creamy sweetness. This is a cream ale to be sure with a taste and texture that invokes dairy as much as it invokes beer. Grains and a bit of malty sweetness combine for a taste that is unsophisticated but, probably for the best, is largely overshadowed by the striking creaminess. Its smoothness is its greatest virtue, but I would happily trade it for some character."
"This beer pours a very light amber color with a thick white (creamy) head that sticks around for a little while. Looks slightly watered down, but has a good head. The aroma is very weak, but a little metallic aroma is present and it is a little bready. This was surprisingly smooth to drink, but it didn't have a lot of character. It is a little bready just like the aroma but a little sweetness comes through after a little while. Slight metallic taste. Nothing too wonderful here, but it is pretty smooth."
"Most didn't seem to be very impressed with this beer, but I really thought it was quite good. Just as the name says, it is indeed quite creamy. The smell seemed ""light"" but pleasant, and the taste, although indeed creamy, was mild and not at all strong. In fact, unlike most ""widget can"" beers from the UK, this one seemed almost thirst quenching. A really easy beer drink, Wexford is nice and smooth."
"Poured a hazy amber with a slim nitro head. Another brew that would be nothing without the nitro. Smooth mouthfeel is nice, but for a nitro brew this mouthfeel is subpar. Sweet malts and weak hops don't help the brew too much. I will not recomend this beer. There are many better brews out there. Although, anytime you pickup 64oz of beer for $3 in Boston, you feel good about it."
"Poured from a nitro can, the clover honey-colored beer cascades down the side of the glass, leaving a thick white head on top. The head sticks around to the end and leaves lace all the way down the glass. The smell is bready, with barely detectable hops. Not a lot is happening in the taste, either. A bit of biscuit is noticeable, and it has a sweetness that becomes more pronounced after a few drinks. All in all, the taste is pretty uninspired. The mouthfeel is fairly nice, and it does go down well. It's not a terrible choice for a warm day, but better choices abound."
"Crystal clear light auburn hue. Typical cascading effect yields a creamy, steely, utterly uniform, massed cream white head that leaves Belgian lace. Roughly floral hop nose akin to dried Chamomile is accompanied by mild bubblegum esters and subdued, but detractingly metallic tinged grainy sweetness. Odd and unenticing aromawise. Blurred light caramel upfront in flavor is lazily ensued by a faint, earthy and herbal hop presence with meager perceived bitterness. Vapid bready basemalt notes along with light bubblegum esters surface mid palate and provide a clement, yet obtrusive grain and flavored flouride treatment impression. The overall flavor profile is virtually static and doesn't change appreciably as the beer breathes. Lean, passably dextrinous in mouthfeel, but stagnant and lacking any vibrancy that would otherwise be present without the nitrogenation. Finishes with a brief metallic surge followed by fading cidery sweetness. This beer tastes flat and lifeless, yet manages to sit heavily on the palate. Even Boddingtons has more overall character. Buying a four pack was quite a mistake. Yawn inducing at best."
"Given the smoothness of this beer, the mouthfeel and drinkability is good. I liked it a lot more after the third swallow...a beer that really grew on me."
"This is a very creamy ale for sure,pours a medium copper color with a great creamy,sticky head,after that it loses some luster.Slight mineral like malty aroma but not much there.Taste has some slight malty fruitiness but again not to much,an easy drinker and nice looking but nothing in betwwen"
"This brew poured a large creamy head of very fine white bubbles, which later settled to a small head, and a transparent amber body. As I drank from my mug, it left behind a most excellent clinging vine lacing that never sagged! It has a mild hoppy aroma with a very smooth initial taste that smoothly finishes. It has a very warm somewhat chewy flavor of malts and bread."
"This beer poured a large invigorating long lasting white creamy head with fine sized bubbles. There was no carbonation observed with this beer. The nose was fruity. The hue of this beer is golden. The mouthfeel of this beer was thin. It has excellent lacing on the sides of my mug. It has a mild aftertaste to it and a slight bitterness."
"This was one creamy beer, hence the name. But that seemed to be all it had going for it. Light malt taste and no hops detected. After the gorgeous head the body was quite thin in appearance and taste. It finishes with a candy like sweetness. This might be a good after dinner beer if you want something sweet but not too aggressive."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a tall white head that is somewhat loose and watery but surprisingly has a nice retention. Aroma is quite faint but there are notes of sweet malts and a touch of buttermilk. Very smooth and creamy in texture (no doubt due to the nitro can) that turns a bit thin towards the end. As with the nose, the taste is also a bit bland with notes of caramelized malts and fruit with only a hint of hop bitterness towards the finish. A decent brew but fairly boring."
"It's the only Irish Cream Ale I was found, so there's nothing to compare this to. Copper colored with an off-white, cascading, creamy head and trails of lingering lace. The aroma is tea-like and wet mowed lawn. The Medium/full malt is slightly mealy, but not in a bad way. The tea-like hop bitterness is fairly well proportioned to the maltiness. Slightly metallic and a trace of citrus flavors. Really smooth and balanced."
"Drinkability: The nitro widget tries to raise the bar for this rather mediocre beer, with only limited success. The nitro device is better applied in Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout or Young's Oatmeal Stout."
"Overall, this is a fairly weak, uninteresting beer. It's drinkable, but really -- why?"
"A nice session ale, pass the darts, and what did you say about me sainted mother?!?!?!?"
"F."
"Bottom Line: Might not be worth a premium, unless your enamored with the “widget can,” but an easy-drinking, beautiful-looking beer."
"looks good and it's easy to drink, but that's about all this brew has going for it. i hadn't had a wexford in a while but remembered it having much more flavour in the past. the flavour is definitely lacking here. hints of caramel and maybe a bit of a buttery taste, but at times i felt like i was just drinking creamy water, if that makes any sense. pours a nice amber with a solid head that lasts (as expected w/a nitro). it's very creamy, but not overly thick. not a bad brew, but certainly nothing to write home about."
"Mouthfeel is soft and silken with a light body. Taste begins with a subtle bavarian wheat, phenolic character, quickly fades into a metallic note, and ends with a very wet, soft, mildly roasted malt finish with no noticeable hop aroma, flavor, or bitterness. Very drinkable...not at all complex...meant to be drank in mass quantities."
"This cream ale is super smooth and reeks of ""drink me all night"" quality."
" the best cream ale."
"The beer pours a crystal clear amber color, the head quite creamy in texture, the size modest, and the lace quite fine and adequate to cover the glass. Malt aromas dominate the slightly sweet nose; start is also sweet and the top skeletal. Finish is sparsely hopped little if any carbonation; this was not unexpected due to the style, dry aftertaste. Average, and leaves me wanting to sample that great big bad boy Barley Wine in the fridge. Hopefully tonight after all the family Christmas Cheer has subsided to a dull roar and Im back home pounding on the keys and reading all the wonderful BA Christmas reviews and forum post."
"Pours out of the can with a cream or beige color. Beer sits in the glass with a golden color with a dense brilliant white head. Typical appearance of nitro can product. I smell a little banana. Taste a slight banana and a sweetness. Not as creamy in mouthfeel as some other nitro cans. Some bitterness is detectable in the finish and aftertaste. Some malty flavors. Some sourness. You could have more than one."
"Moderate amber color, with a creamy rich beige head from the nitro can. Nice lacing down the glass. Faint sweet malty smells, not much else. Taste is a mild combination of carmel malt sweetness and a thin hop presence, if any. Slightly waterly feel, and thin finish. No earthy undertones to it, like soem other notable Irish-Red Ales. Easy to drink, and good with hearty fall meals. I paired this with a pork chop with carmel apples, mashed potatoes and vegetables. I don't think it stands alone very well."
"Color is a reddish tan/brown. Aromas are of trading-card bubble gum, honey, warm milk and ripe bananas. Flavors are a sweet blend of cream, tropical fruit, honey and just enough bitterness to give the hedonistic elements a little thrust and shape. Smooth smooth and extremely drinkable."
"Not super-impressed with this ale.I would like to try it on tap to give it a fair shot though.The nitro-cans down here can go through hell sometimes.It wasn't bad,but was lacking in taste,aroma and had a very watery mouthfeel for a Cream Ale.I think I will change glasses also to try and get the head to stay up a little longer and also trap a little nitrogen.I think that may have contributed to the watery feel."
"Once the nitro-head has settled, there's a clear amber body topped by a firmly creamy textured, and creamy-white colored head that holds extremely well but leaves no lace. Still, very nice to look at throughout the pint. The aroma is of a very light caramel maltiness and some rich, earthy hops. The bodys is light, and the carbonation level is well restricted (<1.9 volumes CO2), giving an amazingly smooth mouthfeel. The flavor is softly malty and fruity throughout the palate, finishing only lightly dry and barely noticeable with a long lingering maltiness and some earthy hops. Although some might argue that there's not enough character here, I feel it makes one nice, sweet & creamy pint; although it may become too sweet with a few in a row as a session beer - hence, a lower drinkablility."
"Nitro can adds to the appearance and mouthfeel but detracts from taste. A decent dose of bittering hops, but they can't hide a somewhat cloying dry finish. Not a beer to seek out."
"Very similar to Caffrey's in appearance and taste, but I thought this was slightly better. Very creamy with a long-lasting head. Butterscotch color during the pour was nice. Very mild flavor."
"Nitro-can cascade in the glass, head is very creamy and hangs at 1/2 inch.  Clearish amber after settling...smell is just a little of cream cheese.  Very smooth malty flavor, nitro-can pleasant body.  Maybe just a touch more hops than Boddington's but really little to none.  OK, not  a lot of taste, best feature is the creamy mouthfeel."
"Golden-amber color with an off white creamy head with sticky lace.  Both the head and lace lasted to the last drop. Sweet, fruity, caramel and malt aroma.  Very smooth, rich  and creamy. Malt flavor with caramel.  The presents of hops is almost nil.  Could have used better/more hops to better balance the malt sweetness.  Some fruitiness in the mix.  A bit thin and maybe to mellow.  Overall this is a tasty beer lacking in body as for most nito can brews."
"Notes: Give me a Caffrey’s in a can any day over this … oh yeah it is not available in the US anymore, I guess I have to go else where for an Irish Red. Not a horrible brew but I ask why even try this processed brew."
"Nitro Can.  Beautiful head(duh). Light copper color.  Sweet malt nose/flavors.  Butterscotch undertones.  Very slight bitter aftertaste.  Extremely thin.  Not bad for a nitro can, better than Caffrey's, but too sweet/thin for my taste."
