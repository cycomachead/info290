"Pours smooth with full carbonation.  Crisp taste with the finish of a cream ale.  Overall good beer."

"This beer is very smooth. Some cream ales are too sweet, this one is just right. It has a heavier taste than it's light golden color would suggest. It has no bitter qualities at all, and a fresh after taste. Good light beer, great dessert beer."

"Pleasing bright finish with a bit of bitterness and tart. Great summer months drinker for those who can get it."

"First tried this in Asheville, liked it enough to buy a case and bring it home. Will be sad when its gone, and will search for it again."

"My opinion is most US breweries haven't tried a hand at making cream ales and thus many Americans haven't come to enjoy the taste. Too bad, Catawba has done a good job of making a great cream ale. That and White Zombie really shows this brewery is going in the right direction."

"Overall (3.25): Well, it’s a cream ale. About run of the mill, except for some interesting, mild phenolic character on the apalte and a pretty solid mouthfeel. Fortunately, I like cream ales. It’s not my favorite (that’s probably Sixpoint Sweet Action), but it’s not horrible, and does have a thing or two to set apart from the others. I’ve often thought that you could do some interesting things with a beer that is a cream ale at heart, but using saison yeast and Brett; however, that’s not happening here. Still, in my completely unprofessional opinion, I would say this is just a not-bad Cream Ale, but not a lot more. It is what it is."

"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable - this would pair well with just about any foods. Not as creamy as some of the others in the style but it is still a good selection."

"What a lovely oddball of a beer, brewed with “wheat, corn, American hops and free range yeast.” While none of those ingredients are necessarily new to the Cream Ale style, the addition of wheat in this case overpowers what’s typically a much cleaner style of beer. However, while it’s missing some expected larger-esque nuances it makes up for this with its uniqueness."
"O: The beer is easy to drink but lacks the smoothness and creaminess exhibited by other beers in the style."
"I am glad that they justified the use of corn, which I have come to realize is El Diablo when it comes to adjuncts in beer. I have had so many silage-like AALs as part of The CANQuest (TM) that I CAN now readily identify it when it rears its ugly smell and taste. Again, stop with the editorializing. The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN, which is like getting a baker's dozen. Previous reviewers mentioned the discernible lack of head, so I employed the inverted Glug for maximum head production. It was still to little avail as I had a brief finger of fizzy, bone-white head with extremely low retention. Bye! Color was lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity and somewhere around Escondido, CA, Greg Koch was scoffing at me. Nose was an interesting melange of scents - light silage; I agree with Cresant on peaches; a peppery spiciness, perhaps from the yeast or the wheat or both. I still like Genny Cream, but it NEVER smelled as good as this! Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and I did experience the silage-like flavor of the corn more strongly on the tongue, but I was still getting a fruity spiciness also. Finish was semi-dry, totally refreshing and more appropriate for a hot summer's day. BTW, what happened to Spring this year? It is downright chilly! Okay, no more editorializing for this review."

"Nice to see Catawba Valley six packs over here in the Triad.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear lighter golden with a halfinger bone white head that was gone pretty quickly.Sweet notes in the nose,mainly corn and and cereal grains,not much hop presence.Somewhat sweet up front on the palate but it balances out somewhat with mild toastiness and faint grassy/herbal hops in the finish.Not bad for what it is,it's good for doing stuff around the house like today."
"This is a straightforward and simple beer, but has no flaws and is enjoyable for what it is. I wont go chasing it down, but would recommend on a hot day and am glad to have been able to try it thanks to the guys at Craftcans.com who sent me the package"
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is slightly sweet, maybe a hint of vanilla. Taste is crisp, sweet, creamy, some grains, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a decent beer."

"This is a refreshing, light offering that was perfect on this hot day. It's worth checking out."
"The mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Dense and zippy in the mouth but a little slippery and smooth in the finish."

"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, and skunk. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, slight skunk, and earthy. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew, but very weak. The earthy aspect I picked up on was kind of nice. But in a Cream Ale? That shouldn't be here... This one is worth trying for a fan of the style or a ticker, but once and done is good enough for me."
"The nose is fairly crisp and clean, but there's a fair amount of honeyish sweetness to this beer. Mild notes of peach and apple. Tastes decent enough, but lacking in the attenuation department. Definitely could stand to lose some of the residual sweetness, and to gain some carbonation. A little heavy and sweet on the palate for what should be a delicately constructed, refreshing style."
"Easy as hell to drink and enjoyable the whole time!"
"D-Solid macro-crossover brew. Enough flavour to hold my interest and light enough to be refreshing."
"The beer was billed as a Farmhouse Ale at Asheville Barley's. Seemed fair for the style with a few American twists. Opened with a Wit-like color, but with less haze and more carbonated. Aromas of light malt / grain blend and a healthy dose of estery spices. Tastes of light malt take precedence over the grains, but contributing residual sweetness that lingered a little too long. Hops balance the malts while contributing backgraound spices and earthiness. Finishes a bit on the sweet / tart side. Body is quite light and refreshing. Low alcohols for flavor make it a real thirst quencer."
"This beer would be a good crossover beer for a macro fan. The beer looked like a macro with a thin head. The taste was similar to a light beer. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth for the style. The drinkability was good. This beer could be sessioned with ease."
"Overall not really my style, but I would take this over a macro or your average lager anyday. My macro drinking buddy loved this beer. It was his favorite of all the beers he tried in Asheville and he tried a lot of beers."
"Pint at Barley's in Asheville, NC."
