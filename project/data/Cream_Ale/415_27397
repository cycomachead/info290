A passable macro at a decent price point; I like to stock up on cans of this when it goes on sale, as it's something mundane that I can leave in the fridge and offer to visitors that prefer 'the regular stuff'.","thehyperduck","Jan 02, 2014"

There is an edge to it, however, and perhaps that's because it's an ale - and if it is, it's one really clean ale for sure! There is more bitterness to it, I'll give it that, but it's still below pilsner levels. I guess it does have some drinkability to it though, if you look at it as being unoffensive and quaffable.

The flavor has some sweetness. There is the typical grains and a slight touch of skunk from the clear bottle. A tiny hint of metallic aftertaste.

My heart said that a Cream Ale (having never tasted one) would taste like a milkshake or as my friend suggested, a creme soda, but it tastes more like a typical mass-produced beer but minus the playing deck of cards looking label and a heart (as small as it is) that at least tries to sing.","thelagerheads","Jun 26, 2006"

Grainy malt on the nose with the slightest hint of hops. Flavour is malty crisp, with a small finish of hops, pretty straight forward, nothing unique or spectacular about it.
