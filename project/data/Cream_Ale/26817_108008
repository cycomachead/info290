Flavor is sweet, vanilla taffy, where's the coffee? Thick, slick, a little cloying. Cold the alcohol is hidden but it comes out as it warms. I expected a novelty beer, but I also expected coffee. I got the former and not the latter. Glad I got to try it but this is my least favorite Carton beer thus far. I prefer the pumpkin scobeyville cream ale - which seems to come from the same general recipe - by a wide margin.","Kurmaraja","Mar 16, 2015"

4.42,4.2,3.75,4.25,4.75,4.25,4.25,"Sometimes a beer tries to do a lot and sometimes a beer tries to focus on something and do it well.  This beer focuses on doing one thing well.  On paper it all lends toward a complex experience.  Big 12% imperial cream ale with two kinds of coffee thrown in to the mix.  The look is golden with a small off white head that fades and leaves small spots of lacing.  The nose nails what it sets out for, it's regular coffee and this would fool me for the real thing.  If like a bit more punch, aromas are muted but what's there is great.  Creamy sweetness up front gives way to bittering coffee notes and a blended coffee with milk and two sugar taste.  It's not overly complex but it absolutely nails what it sets out to do.  Mouthfeel is creamy with some slightly dry feel in the finish.  This beer is fantastic in its simplicity.  The color, flavors and aromas all work to achieve that experience of a beer that represents a regular coffee.","HopBomb515","Feb 14, 2015"

The taste was...really pretty bad. Sickeningly sweet caramel and sour cream, cake batter, fusel alcohol, sweet corn, some roast, but any coffee in this was really an afterthought. Mouthfeel was slick and syrupy, with a body like a half-flat soda. The high ABV was definitely there--maybe not all 12%, but it was definitely boozy. Overall, this was a revolting mess.

It's got a sweet and malty aroma, with a bit of citrus, a hint of coffee and perhaps even some light hops. The taste is very bready, and it's certainly identifiable as a cream ale, however, the genuine coffee flavor definitely comes through enough to make it very unique. What's crazy is that it's so soft on the palate, and the large ABV % is essentially undetectable. Very dangerous to have a few of these and not realize the magnitude of what one has just drank.

The beer has an orange tint to it that doesn't match up with the earthy roasted nose that is accompanied by a slight sweetness to it. The mouthful is fantastic and has more carbonation than one would think from looking at the beer initially. It envelopes your mouth with a wonderful sweetness that I have no beer to compare it to and a slight roasty bitterness that is enjoyable and doesn't linger. You would not believe this is 12% if you were not informed of it. This is simply a great beer that people of any style preference would be inclined to enjoy.","Mangelli","Jan 28, 2015"

Wasn't expecting it to be as sweet as it is though, though maybe I just enjoy my ""regular coffee"" a bit more on the roasted side.

Mild coffee flavor throughout, some malt sweetness with in the creamy full-ish body. Very warming alcohol, sweetness lingers and so does the coffee flavor.
