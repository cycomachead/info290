"Overall- Pretty much an above average beer. It's representative of the style but it's a style that's a little close to AAL for me. Worth a try if you're into this type of beer but I think many BA's would probably rather pass."

"a well made and downright slammable cream ale from ninkasi. clear blonde and relatively heady, about an inch of sudsy white foam with fine retention. some sweetness to the nose, and a bit of a bigger grain bill than so many of the lower budget creams on the market. i almost taste some rice in this, or some other rather bland starch, it has body out of seemingly nowhere, but still drinks easy, with bright carbonation and a cleaner cereal finish. my only real critique here is the way my palate stays coated after the swallow. some thin film seems to cover my tongue and teeth, not bad tasting or anything, just an odd feeling for such a light style of beer. not my favorite ninkasi brew so far, but a more than serviceable cream ale. i am a big proponent of the style, and reckon we need quite a few more available regularly on the denver scene."

"Pours a clear golden color with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some sugary aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight grassy flavor on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice overall balance with a good malt profile."

"The body was the expected full and smooth. Drinkability was very nice, you could easily drink several of these. Overall, a nice take on the style and certainly worth your time if you ever see it."

"O: Good brew. Light flavor but not watery. Refreshing but not really crisp."

"Review from 6/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a nice orange amber. Thin white persistent head, light lacing. Aroma is grain with some adjunct qualities; faint. Pleasant light sweet and caramel malt and grain, medium bodied. Very light hops. Pleasant sweet malt finish. An enjoyable light ale, but not something I would search out. Well made for an obvious attempt to make a superior adjunct style beer"

"Nuptiale is better than I expected. Flavorful yet drinkable, it’s a decent cream ale."
"Taste is nice, full-bodied creamy toasty grain, bread, apple with a grassy-peppery bitterness that is light but firm. It is great, a firm, full-bodied, “cream ale” character with a lot of flavour and well-rounded with a hint of complexity. It is lightly sweet in a typical cream ale way but has a light hoppy character and bitterness to back it up and round it out. It’s great with food and overall excellent."
"This beer is really hard to just sip...it really invites big gulps. I've never had a cream ale before and I must guess that this one is an excellent example of the style."
"Creamy mouthfeel as promised, but it's not heavy or cloying. Very drinkable."
"A solid, light crisp cream ale. Deftly balanced and very tasty."
"Overall, I like this beer."
"Nothing too complex or memorable, just a light, easy drinking beer."
"D- Very refreshing, enjoyable flavor. Worth drinking."
"Overall- Good beer for a warm day. There is a little more hop flavor in this one compared to other cream ales I have had. But also a little thinner. 3.5/5"
"O - An odd flavor is enough for me to pass on this one next time."
"Overall, a good beer. Fits the style pretty well, would be quite nice on nitro. Solid summer beer, quite thirst quenching."
"O: I love Ninkasi, and I love most of what they make. I wasn't a big fan of this beer, but I would probably drink it again."
"3.5/3.5/3/3/4"
"Poured somewhat aggressively into my standard pint glass and I get a pretty big two finger head. The head is completely white, with mostly small bubbles, some big ones, I can't tell if the bubbles look creamy or soapy, prolly more on the creamy side though. For sure has a pillowy look to it as well though. The head is giving great lacing all the way throughout the glass. Frankly I'm impressed with how long this head is sticking around, I doubt it will be here forever, but I don't really expect that from any beer, but a nitro beer. Overall it's hanging in here pretty well! The body is just slightly darker than a lager, slightly lighter than a pale ale, nice mix between the two. Somewhat transparent, but it's cold enough in the glass, and slightly dark enough that I can't see too much on the other side. The carbonation looks like it might be a little high, be it's pretty close to perfect. Overall this beer looks really really nice, I'm excited! The smell is a little weird for me, on one hand it smells creamy, smooth and tasty. But on the other hand it has a lemon smell that almost reminds me of the Blue Moon spring seasonal, which was not good at all, it also has a hint of those kind of adjuncts. The more I smell this beer the more I just want to give it a 3, this beer BARELY is making a 3.5 on smell. Not too impressed with the smell overall. Not a bad taste though on this beer. First you get that lemon taste that I was talking about, but after a few sips it just blends right in with the rest of the flavors. Then there is a nice NICE creamy taste to this beer, maybe a tiny hop bite, and a noticeable but not at all overpowering malt note. The balance on this beer is done very well, I'm really impressed with the malts, just the right amount, not too much, but not too little. Perhaps some hidden flavors in here as well, maybe vanilla, vanilla and cream do go together well, so I wouldn't be surprised. It's not the most amazing beer of all time, but it's really good, and it's somewhat unique, I haven't had too many cream ales, but from what I can remember, this is a little different from the rest. The taste is really growing on me, it just keeps getting tastier. I don't think it's going to get much higher than a 4, just because it does have a tiny tiny tiny cheap beer taste, but I wont count the possibility out! Overall a really nice taste. The mouthfeel is perfect for a cream ale, perfect carbonation, perfect girth on the body, excellent. Drinkability is phenomenal, it goes down super easy, it's light, creamy, refreshing, and best of all tasty! Overall I really good beer, I didn't think it would be this good when I smelled it, but it really came through!"
"- Overall this is a very grainy full flavored pale ale which is fantastic. But I have to judge this beer as it's name and style represents. This would be an 'A' grade pale if it were just so."
"D - Very sessionable, but for all the wrong reasons. Still, not a bad beer by any means. I prefer more flavorful brews, but this is worth a try."
