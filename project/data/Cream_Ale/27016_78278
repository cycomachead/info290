One of the worst craft beers I've had recently, but I tend not to like imperial pale lagers, and this beer is a close cousin to those styles.","heerboth","Dec 26, 2014"

3.84,1.6,3.75,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Cream Ales, an ale/lager hybrid of sorts, are greatly underrepresented and often misunderstood. Slumbrew reminds us how fun the style can be with their dangerously delicious Imperalized interpretation; a cold lager blended with a warm ale. Perhaps a bit too sweet, but the complexity and sheer drinkability quickly forgives and forgets.","BeerAdvocate","Jun 29, 2013"

3.68,-2.6,4,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,"The look and smell are pretty good - seethrough orangeish body with two-finger head that dies quick with lace patches on glass and a mix of some bitter, grainy hops and malts along with a sugary, caramel edge. The taste and mouthfeel of the beer just didn't come through as well for me though(who knows - bad tap line? old keg?) . There is a creaminess and smoothness to the beer, goes down easy but not watery, mind you, and there is some sweet caramel malt but it's either not enough or there are just too much hops because overall I found this beer to be grainy, sharp and a little bitter with a very dry finish. Maybe the ABV bled in a little or my beer had a touch of metallic taste but overall I'd say the sweetness was overpowered for a good but not great beer.","clayrock81","May 05, 2013"

Some lacing is left behind as the head recedes. The beer smells of grain, caramel, and grassy and woody hop notes. The flavor is pretty sweet. I get the caramel and honey flavors up front. The grain and grassy and woody hops are also there. The back end bitterness is there and lingers in the back of the mouth. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is slick in the mouth and goes down easily. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Mar 09, 2013"

3.54,-6.3,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Crystal clear copper color, bubbly head on top. Yeast, ripe pears, spicy hop, orange pith and animal feed grain in the nose. Very smooth, creamy with a medium body. Biscuity throughout, bread crust and crackers. Lots of hop flavor; herbal, leafy, spicy, mild tobacco & orange peel. Hint of caramel and ripe fruit in the middle, finishes near astringent. A battle more than balance here, hops and malt don't seem to fully mesh together for me and while it is not a chore to drink it certainly is not a bomber I'd get on my own. I've had batches that were sweeter and a bit more palatable.","Jason","Feb 18, 2013"
3.79,0.3,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"O: It's not bad, quite simple and definitely seems to defy the style. Being an ""imperial"" cream ale it makes sense, doesn't taste like any other cream ale I've ever had. It's definitely got much stronger malt and hops than any cream ale I've tried, which is good and bad I suppose. Stronger, sharper flavors but loses the lightness, smoothness and the plain drinkable simplicity of a cream ale. I had a hard time scoring this one and waffled quite a bit.","Dope","Feb 17, 2013"
