"This is just a very standard, flavorful lagery cream ale, and as that it is the best I've ever had.  As a beer overall it's somewhat boring and isn't going to compete with any great beers out there, but for what it is, I honestly don't think you can do better.  It's very sessionable, goes down incredibly easily, and would pair well with a wide range of foods while also tasting good enough to drink on its own.  This is something I'd want to have a case of at the beach.  Based on those observations, I would consider this beer to be very underrated."

"The beer is crystal clear with good carbonation, not much nose, and a slightly bready clean malt flavor."

"Good take on a Cream Ale. Very drinkable. 4.3"

"Overall, well balanced and easy to drink beer, fits the style."
"Straw colored, decent inch or so of head that diminishes but never really goes away. Smells bready. Tastes metallic. Just... metallic. Pretty one note. Not a pour-out, but wouldn't order again."

"Appearance is clear and light yellow-straw color with a small creamy white head that retains decently, leaving behind some lace. Smells of grains, grass and a hint of cream. Taste like an adjunct light lager with just a hint of sweetness, hops are barely traceable but slightly grassy. Mouthfeel is light with biting carbonation leading to a foamy mouthfeel. This would appeal to a BMC drinker, but there are better cream ales out there."

"Ridiculous four inch fluffy white foamy head that hung around forever. Super clear light straw color. Slight sweetness with slight hop bitterness. Almost like a homeopathic ale or something. Very light and refreshing, though. Mouthfeel is creamy and effervescent. Nice on a hot summer day."

"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a pale, bright, yellow-gold coloring with a halo of white head. Nose of toasted grains and a subtle cream highlight. Flavors are cream forward, with a bitter hops undertone. Fairly well balanced and clean. Cream and butter aftertaste on a smooth, light body. The finish is smooth and clean. Very drinkable, very light."

"O - easy to drink, but completely unimpressive."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. This is a pretty bad offering and not just by blonde or cream ale standards. I hope this is just a case of a bad batch because they cant possibly have intended the brew to turn out like this. If it wasnt 95+ degrees and the only cold thing available, it would have been a drain pour."

"Pale yellow pour, clear, with bubbly carbonation, and a small white head; minimal retention and lacing. Light aroma, toasted grains and not much else. Sweet pale malt flavor, toasted grains, light citrusy hops bringing a slight bitterness. Light body, drinks easy enough, but lacks character (aka flavor)."

"Stopped by the brewpub for a beer after work last week. Wanted something light with my pub fries, so I went with this. Came out a crystal clear pale gold, with a thin white head atop. Simple grain-like scents - husk, mild pale citrus tones. Easy drinking, crisp body. Mild flavors of corn, bread, very faint and fleeting hop presence, which was expected. All-in-all, this is a nice beer. An approachable beer for the masses, and a good one to pair with some barbecue fare for the upcoming warm months."

"Overall- I don't even need to factor out my preference for dark beers. This is darn good. If you are looking for a ""unique"" beer, keep looking. This is one of those that takes a known set of characteristics and just does them well. I'll definitely come back to this one in the warm weather!!!"
""
"This beer simply tastes very good."
""
""
"O= This is prolly the best cream ale I've ever had. Spotted Cow sort of holds the standard for me but this is better I think. The notes are subtle but they are there. It makes it both an easy drinking summer beer and a beer that is worth trying for the biggest beer geek."
""
""
""

"Overall: Unfortunately there are some problems with this beer. It was given to me from a friend so not sure the age or how it was stored. Other than the problems listed above, if fresh this could be an easy drinking refreshing beer. Would give another try with a fresher bottle again."
"My pour got me a finger of bone-white head with good retention. Color was a pale, light, lemon-yellow with a slight haze. Nose smelled strongly of grassy ""noble hops"". I love truth in advertising! Mouthfeel was soft, not really thin, nor medium, but more like softened water. I was really feeling the grassy hops on the tongue and wishing that more Cream Ales, especially those of my childhood, could have been/be like this. Finish was semi-dry and very refreshing. This would be a wonderful summer beer or a nice break on a day of heavy drinking. If only they would put this in CANs ..."

"Overall: a very easy to drink beer. This is a well done version of the style and anyone who wants to enjoy a cream ale this one will satisfy it."

"O: Easy drinking beer. Very crisp and clean but not overly impressive. Would definitely drink it again, yet would want something with more flavor if I'm sharing. Good grilling beer."
"Pours a pale golden color with a small white head that quickly dissipated. Aroma was very subtle, not much there at all, smell was mostly malty sweetness. Taste was balanced, nice hop flavor with a little malt flavor. highly carbonated, but pretty smooth, very light body. It could make a good thirst quenching session beer, but it's still just average."
""
""
"O: overall a nice beer, would go down great at the pool"
""
""
""
"Overall, it's an average beer. Nothing amazing, but it's certainly not a bad beer. If I wanted something to quench my thirst and was offered this, I would not turn it down. Cheers"
""
""
""
"Overall the most solidly average beer I have ever had. Better than a macro but doesn't really bring much of anything to the table."

"O - Carolina Blonde is certainly not a terrible beer, but the smell and aroma keep bringing me back to feeling like I'm drinking an unfermented, carbonated bottle of light wort. Maybe it's aimed to the masses, maybe it's their every day lawnmower beer. All I know is in the end, Foothills' Carolina Blonde is a refreshing beer to kick back with."
""
"O: I was really hoping for more here, but over all pretty flat. Not bad on a hot day, but nothing to write home about."
"Not good, almost an off flavor in the aroma. I expected a little more malt character for a cream ale. Could easily pass off as a light beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, a tasty if not slightly boring blonde ale. Although not a lot is going on I couldn't really detect any off flavors and it is quite refreshing. Worth a try."
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Nice looking beer with a golden straw, hazy look. Apple cider quality with a nice 2 finger pillow off white head. Nose was of orange peel, citrus, biscuits and honey. Not overpowering, but adequate. Taste was similar to the nose with a nice straw, citrus hit on the front and the noble hops add a punch to the end. Not over the top hops, but a good balance. A bit on the sweet side, but again not overpowering. Feel is a bit on the watery side on the front with a good bit of carbonation to add to the dry finish. Overall- A decent Blonde with nice character and very sessionable. A bit on the sweet side which was a distraction for me. Good blend of hops and citrus notes. Not a bad beer, but nothing that stands out as spectacular. Wouldn't turn one down and the low price helps-"
"Overall a pretty basic brew that was more like a light beer than a Cream Ale, although it did have a decent bitter undertone to it..."
""
"Served in what appeared to be a weizen glass at the Charlotte airport (long layover). Pours a straw gold with a translucent clarity. Head was half inch, rocky and bright white and eventually settled into a solid skim. Nose is clean and somewhat subdued - primarily biscuity malts and perhaps some citric acid. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is more of a cereal grain presence in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation and a clean finish. Overall, not a bad American Blonde. A decent, easy drinking session beer that pairs well with food, but there's nothing overly distinctive about this offering in my opinion."

"O: Not an offensively bad beer, but certainly unremarkable."
"O: Very sessionable but nothing outstanding - have had several other beers from Foothills that I have enjoyed more than this one. Seems like the ABV for this beer is either very low or very well hidden."
"A very sessionable beer, but a forgettable beer overall."
""
"Overall I thought this was rather nice for a nice sessionable blond ale. I had not ever had anything from Carolina before but it was nice to see that they obviously put some effort into what they do. This was definitely a quality ale and something I would like to enjoy again, especially on a warm day."

"Trying the Foothills Brewing Carolina Blonde at the Taste of Carolina at the B concourse in Charlotte, NC airport. The beer poured a clear golden color with thin white head that dissapates quickly....not much lacing. The smell includes hints of lemon and barley. The taste bursts with a tart lemon zing....the malt never realy kicks in to balance the beer. Teh mouthfeel is light to medium with big carbonation. Overall it is ok...would be great for the summer time."
