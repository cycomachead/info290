"Feel: thin with decent carbonation."
"O:  Very nice lighter beer. To quote Forest Gump, "" I could drink about a million and a half of these"". Nice alternative to an American Lager."
""
"Something for those who aren't fans of bitter brews. An option for the times you want to drink a lighter ale. This is a lawnmower beer."

""
"Although it doesn't quite match the specifications for a mainstream ""cream ale"" (mainly clarity, some aromatics), it's quite a nice beer in its own right (and I don't know any craft brew drinkers who are too into clarity). Quaffable might be a good word to use to describe it!"
"Hazy golden in color. Aroma hints of yeast, bread and a flour tortilla, wheaty bready. Not an awful beer but not my favorite"
""
"Doesn't pour like a traditional cream ale and has a little more carbonation than you would normally expect from a cream ale.  Great taste and smooth finish; absolutely no hop but leaves a subtle buttery aftertaste."

"Good beer. Tasty. Smooth, and absolutely no hoppy taste. Could use a higher ABV, but hey...it's pretty decent."

"O: I'm a bit mixed on this one, the flavor is enjoyable and its slight complexity keeps one coming back for more, however the weak scent and what i would call bizarre feel are turnoffs. Perhaps this can was an outlier perhaps these are the desired traits of the style I'm not sure. Overall though it's not too bad and for something that is just as drinkable as a Bud and not much more expensive it's not a bad deal either."

"O: Love the bottle, carried this one thousands of miles to China where I’m enjoying it near the end of summer. Light and refreshing, would pair with lots of foods, especially pizza, hot dogs and hamburgers, summer fare."
""
"Light body though heavier than a lager. Lightish effervescence. Not bad but nothing to recommend it either."

"O: A decent example of a pretty dismal style. I dont really understand the concept of craft beer and adjunct ingredients. A craft brewery brewing a cream ale is like a woman getting a breast reduction, it just doesn't make sense and quite frankly should be illegal. Overall, not terrible, but I would not ever purchase this."

"Overall: maybe I am harsh on these because I am not a fan of the style but to me a cream ale should be creamy and most usually are not."

"O: Not impressed, better than PBR that’s about it. C"
"Was in JAX fro a Monday evening Football game and stayed at the Hyatt that had the Killer Whale Cream Ale on tap. The beer is a light ale brewed and is very easy to drink, The beer poured a light clear golden with thin white head. The smell included grain and barley. The taste was similar to the smell a very bready taste with slight hints of sweetness. The mouthfeel was light in body but smooth with mild carbonation. Overall is was a decent cream ale and very drinkable."
""
"O- Drinkable as hell if at the right price."
"Poured on-tap at the Bold City Brewery, the beer was served up in a pint glass. The beer pours a pale yellow-gold coloring, slightly hazy, with not a trace of head. There is a slightly sour malty aroma, with some slight musty overtones. Round and smooth bodied, yet it remains light in mouth. The beer has roasty/toasty flavors, with a smokey and roasted aftertaste. Smooth finish. This is well-bodied, which is different for the lager taste that this cream ale carries with it. Interesting brew, and I think it might have been a little bit better out of the growler after it had some time to settle and warm. Either way, I would drink it!"
"If I have to have a light beer, let it be this. It's light and refreshing and actually has some fruity notes and no off flavors. This beer will pair with those lighter meals like salads that imperials won't. It's a golden color with a high carbonation which makes this a nice bubbly delight. The craft beer to train people on.."
"D-Drinkability of this beer is as high as it is light. I did not really care for its flavors that much but if you did this would be a very drinkable beer for you. I did try the Dukes brown ale after this and enjoyed it much better but didnt have the time to review it. In the future however I will pass on this one."
"Nothing really in the way of enjoying this. Dry and crisp in the finish leaves you wanting something else. Low ABV makes this extremely easy to drink. Soft creaminess does not disappoint."
"D: well tastes and drinks like bud to me, which I hate, some since I hate this beer, not much to say, other that so long."
"D - Quite drinkable, as expected of the style. This is not a complex or interesting beer, but it fills a niche and is relatively good for what it is. The malt character could be a bit richer and the acidity is kind of off-putting, but it is what it is."
"D- very drinkable, little aftertaste."
"D 4.0 - @ $10 for a 1 gallon growler it's good for a cream ale. I would much rather drink the Hefe, Duke's Brown, or IPA - which will be my growler refills in the future."
"D: it goes down ok, but has a twang after taste, I did not think it was that great its decent but I did not want another."
