"Pours to a crystal clear gold, with a thin, white head.  Head dissipates very quickly, leaving almost no lacing.  Tiny particles are suspended within the clear gold volume.  Odor is sour and lightly skunky.  The taste is almost identical to the smell.  Flavors other than sour and skunk are lacking.  Hearty carbonation gives this a heavy feel when swallowed.  This one's a belcher.  I would compare this to Genessee Cream Ale-which I feel exactly the same way about.  Priced too high for the quality.  Build your own 6-pack for $7.99"
"12 oz bottle poured into shaker pint. Yellow body with white head and no lace. Aroma is corn, grass, grainy malts. Taste is similar - macro brew flavors of wheat/grain, weak grassy hops, a bit of sweet corn. Medium body, mildly creamy texture, aggressive carbonation, metallic finish."
""
"Aroma is grains, mild/medium sweetness and a small hint of tea. The flavor is very similar to the aroma."

"It was OK. The sales associate told me that this was similar to Spotted Cow from New Glarus Brewery. He wasn't even close. I could only drink half and threw the rest away. I'm gonna pawn off the rest of my 6 pack to my brothers."

"Pours a slight hazy straw-yellow in color with a very thin white head. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped but not a lot. A good amount of sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle. The aroma is of some sweet citrus and grains for the most part. Pretty much the same for the taste with a very light hoppy finish that doesn't last more than a few seconds. Goes down easy. Overall, it was good."
""
"I didn't even finish the bottle.  Yeah, it's better than bud light....but that's about it.  The rest of it was used for grilling."

"Poured a clear gold and 1/2"" head that vanished almost immediately. Smells like Budweiser. Tastes starts off slightly sweet and a hint of orange/lemon, and then goes slightly bitter/astringent. Tastes alot like Budweiser actually. Maybe a little more intense. It's drinkable, wouldn't say pleasant but not deeply unpleasant either. No hint of creaminess."

"Not much to recommend here. It's drinkable, but not that good of an example of the style."

"Exposed pours a hazy golden color with a nice large lacing head. There is a slight garbage like aroma. The taste is mellow and creamy with hints of a nice spice. Easy to drink and nice full body for a cream ale. Overall a good flavorful cream ale, good full flavors, and enjoyable."

"O- just a disastrous cream ale. When done properly, it's a lovely style, but this is just...no"

"Horny Goat Exposed ---2.5/5"

"O: Vaguely a cream ale. Not bad, but for the style, a bit of a miss."
"Didn't even know Horny Goat was available down here, so I picked up what singles I could to give them a try, beginning with this one. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, mild corn, and sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, progressing flavor-wise from sweet, almost cream-like notes to decidedly wheaty and grainy notes to a sort of off-fruit-y territory that mars an awful lot of decent progress up to that point. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally fluid feel. Overall, an okay cream ale at best, one that hints at some form of tastiness before wrenching it away from me."
""
"Overall: I really like this beer. It's a great beer to enjoy and sit back for more than one. The taste does not get old or overwhelming. If you enjoy cream ales such as Spotted Cow you should give this beer a try. Also, if you have friends you are trying to convert to the craft side this would make a great transitional beer."

"O: Decent beer – nothing special – a step above a Budweiser."
""
""
""
"This was a complete surprise since the bottle gives no clue what's inside. As such, I didn't expect much and I got a little more than I expected. I won't go out of my way for another, but it is a well made brew."
"Overall, a pretty lackluster brew. The tangy note and astringency detract from what could be a decent beer."
""
""
""
"Decent cream ale, one of the better offerings in the horny goat line. Would be a suitable session ale."
"In a bar, bottle. Pours a hazy yellow. Inch thick head quickly shrinks. Aroma is apricot, belgian yeast, and bread. Taste is mild and watery for the style. It works because budweiser and miller lite at my other options, otherwise It wouldn’t. Pretty mediocre."
"O - a decent example of a cream ale."
""
"Overall a really good session beer. Very drinkable. Similar to a Spotted Cow but better"

"Overall. Not a true farmhouse or saison as the style suggests. A basic macro type beer here."
"O- It's a nice idea but it's just not a good beer. It looks and smells nice, but then when you drink it it's grassy and just an odd mouthfeel. I'll pass."
"O: Again another feeble attempt at a Belgian style it probably has no business to attempt when it can hardly handle the basic styles. You can probably blind taste these beers and struggle to define style. If you cant come close to style you should probably leave well enough alone. Fairly boring limited appeal no repeat quality. Exposed, yeah as another leinenkugel."
"Saison? I'm not sure. It would be refreshing after a hot day of work and is HIGHLY drinkable. It goes down even easier than a BMC. For that purpose it serves. However, don’t sit down looking to enjoy something complex when you pour this because in that regard it fails."
"Once all is said and extracted, I could definitely leave this one behind."
"Horney Goat...well I'm horney....so why not!....Right! So this beer has a good solid beer taste, nothing fancy....could compare it to Bud, Miller Genuine, etc. It is clear golden in color, thin white head, minimum lacing. very drinkable and has a decent mouthfeel...Session....I THINK SO!!!!"
"Poured a hazy straw color, not too much head on it. Smell is pretty faint with a bit of wheaty malt and some citrus. Taste is not bad, nothing to write home about, but it's decent. Some citrus notes. Pretty smooth beer, not much aftertaste. Easy drinking beer. Definitely could put down a few of these without a problem."
"Overall a very boring beer. Probably will never buy it or trade for it. Not terrible though."
"Hmm. It says farmhouse ale, but this alll macro lager with a splash of american wheat beer. Sorry guys, it's an easy drinking lawnmower beer, but not even close to the style."
"D: Not bad as a summer wheat brew / lawnmover beer. Not great mind you, but passable. As a Saison? Like they say in Wallonia, ""Fuggitaboutit!"" But even if they called it something else, the rating would not jump considerably."
"Pours a lemony yellow in color with a white head. Light aroma consists mostly of grassy hops. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a decent carbonation. Moderate malty front. When cold this beer has a snappy hoppiness to it. As is warms though the carbonation softens and flavor starts to turn rather bland. There isn't a lot going on here. Probably my least favorite from the Horny Goat stable."
"The appearance of the beer is a hazy white, with a frothy head. The aroma smells of pale sweet malts with a hint of fruit. The taste is bland. There is a faint sweetness that comes through but overall nothing is standing out. The mouthfeel is light, and I guess you could consider it drinkable."
"Drinkability is good because it's pretty much flavored water."
"Save yourself the frustration, this is a beer for frat boys that want to laugh like idiots at the labels. Bad."
"I can't even bring myself to rate this swill. Terrible attempt at a Saison. My God, it's plain horrible. Tasted like an aborted homebrew...This was a absolute drainpour. The smell is sour, which isn't bad, but, the taste is like a adjunct-corn laced lager, with some kind of funk..not a good funk, mind you, just a nasty, rotten, off flavor."
"Overall, this is a modestly enjoyable beer. It does not fit the style much but goes down and doesn't make me regret the swallow."
"Overall, it's the kind of craft beer I'd expect to find in a college town, purposefully inoffensive."
"D - This is not a bad Summer beer, but again, it certainly does not fit the category of a Saison...and that's the way I had to rate it. I could drink these on a hot Summer day while mowing the lawn, but if you're expecting a Saison, you'll be disappointed."
"(D)- A decent beer that is a terrible beer when it comes to what style it is trying to be. If it were simply an adjunct lager, this would actually receive a much better score, but I cannot give it since nothing besides the appearance reminds me of a Saison."
"Moderate body with a nice carbonation kick with each sip. Carbo. level is medium/high. Now the flavor is a conundrum. This tastes exactly what a crisp American lager would taste like, a good one at that. Plenty of buttery grains in the mouth, some light citrus, and a light pop of bitterness on the finish. If this was labeled as a lager, I would rate it a 'B' minimum, but as a Saison, this is way off. I can taste very light yeast and funk in the aftertaste, but it is so faint, it may be my imagination. This one needs some work, or at least a re-styling."
"D - Lacking of all-out bad in every regard, it's an awful ""saison"" (if they can even call it that) that may as well be an adjunct lager with a minimal splash of real flavor, this beer needs some serious work. Also, why is it called Exposed anyway? Just part of the whole gimmick I would imagine. I can drink it fine but every time the style ""saison"" pops into my head I want to pour it out."
"Pours a hazy, golden/yellow color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, hops, clove, and slight citrus. Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. There is a strong tartness associated with this brew. Tastes of tart malt, sweet malt, yeast, citrus, and hops. Overall, this brew is very sharp and tart, but lacks the good complex flavors and quality body. It is very easy drinking, though so that is a plus not normally associated with a Saison."
"Pours a bright, but faintly hazey sunshine and hay color. Quickly receding two finger head down to a nice film of foam. Pretty good bubbling too. The aroma i faint toasted malts and even more faint spice aroma. Pretty bland smelling overall, makes me think of an attempt at spicing up a blonde ale. The taste is a weak farm house spice with pilsner malts. This beer seems more like a keller bier than a saison. Liked a lightly spiced lager. Very easy to drink, but doesn't fit the style."
"Pours a light yellow very transparent color with little head and no lacing. The smell is very faint of citrus. The taste is once again very faint and of citrus. There is not a lot going on taste and smell wise. The mouthfeel is moderate to moderately high carbonation. The drinkability is below average, there is nothing there to bring you back. It is weak for a farmhouse ale."
"I guess I could drink a few of these. Only since it's not overly offensive but this is a very boring average beer. Too bad this beer gets so much hype in my area. I had high hopes."
"This, for some reason, kind of reminds me of a Sam Adam's Summer ale. It's not quite as floral or wheaty but there are similarities. This is no saison and that's where the low scores come in, what it is, is an easy summertime drinker."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes withing seconds into no lacing whatsoever. The aroma is like most generic pseudo craft beer lagers. The is a very faint hint of spice, but I have to work to hard to find it that it isn't enjoyable. The taste has some wheatiness to it, but no spice. It is quite bland too. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. Overall, this is a bad beer. The ""brewery's"" website calls this beer a saison, so I listed it as one even though it tastes nothing like one. In fact this is the worst saison I've ever had. Perhaps, it is more of an American Pale Wheat Ale, but it would be a bad one of those too. I will certainly never drink this again."
