"Overall, not nearly as much cinnamon as I expected, overly boozy and sweet. Not great."

"Not like any cream ale I've ever tasted.  There's not a lot of cinnamon here but at the same time I kind of imagine that if you mixed and ale with the milk leftover from a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch it might taste like this.  Not something I'd drink regularly but not bad at all."

"PDubs wrote a check and this bottle cashed it with cinnamon goodness for days. Would complain because it's not crunchy, but it is beer after all. Pick it up if you're lucky enough to find it."

"This pours a medium brown color with a slight head. The aroma is mildly sweet and malty but nothing like the description would lead you to believe. The taste is sweet and smooth thatâ€™s fairly malty. The ingredients kind of lead you to believe that this is going to be a RumChata style beer but comes off as more like a heavy Marzen brew. Nice, but not what I would have expected from the label."

"Another Pipeworks kitchen sink beer that doesn't work."

"Think more White Russian and less Cream Ale. Sweet and tasty nonetheless."

"Pours deep wood brown  with a fluffy finger and a half fluffy head. Smell has a big lactose presence and super sweet dinner roll like malt aroma. Very faint cinnamon presence, nearly undetectable. Taste has a huge big sweetness upfront with notes of caramel, bread, and cinnamon. Huge alcohol burn in the finish that leaves a rubbing alcohol flavor on the palate. Moderately carbonated thick and sticky. Not sure why this is being called a cream ale as there is nothing even reminiscent of one in here."
"Interesting beer. Smells like milk approaching its expiration with some cinnamon cereal soaking in it. Tastes like cream, vanilla, and a touch of cinnamon. Finishes like a cream soda spiked with vodka or everclear."
