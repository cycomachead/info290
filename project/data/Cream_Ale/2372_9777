As a session beer, Golden Ale is quite nice, but it's not something I'll reach for when I'm wanting to truly taste beer. There are just not enough flavors present.

This beer tastes good for what it's intended for; a nice light refreshing beer which a nice balanced taste. This is the kind of beer you can give a friend or family member who isn't quite as adventurous a beer drinker. The beer pours golden in color with an average head and aroma since it's not hopped to the tits. The mouthfeel is where it should be for a golden ale; effervescent but not too bubbly - on the lighter side of medium bodied. A nice well balanced golden ale which can be used as a first start for a night of sampling other Terrapin beers. Think of it as a Bobby Weir opener (Stranger possibly?) in the first set, just priming the pumps for a killer show. You'll know after 2 or 3 of these you'll be in for a long long crazy crazy night after you step it up to the hoppy monster, stout or rye squared.

Cream ales are not really my favorite style that's for sure, but this is a pretty decent attempt at one, slightly hop-centric cream ale, with an odd bitterness that combats the German malt finish.

Overall, this is a rather subpar offering from a very good brewery. I expected a little more flavor in this one, even if the style is not known for being overly flavorful.

The spent grain taste is still there, but there is also some malt underpinning the flavor and a smidgen of hops. Mouthfeel is refreshing if a not quite as crisp or creamy as it could be.

Its pretty one dimensional, but as far as I understand, this style is not very aggressive. Flavor is right there with the aroma. Lots of corn flavor, with a small grainy note and a light but noticable herbal hop that really adds a nice dimension to this brew. A very mild and clean bitterness clings to the finish. Mouthfeel is on the light side of moderate with a solid moderate carbonation. It is very unobtrusive and without anything to keep me from finishing this bottle. I'm enjoying this one quite a bit.

The beer tastes mostly malty, kind of similar to an all malt lager but less smooth. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but a little more watery than is to be desired. Overall, its a good crossover beer but not one that I would pick up again.","MSchae1017","Mar 20, 2006"
3.7,7.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"All in all good beer and quite drinkable but not likely to make anyone's 'top ten' list. It's a good beer to drink when you're sitting down to watch a game (if you're not quite in the mood for a light lager) Likely also a good crossover beer for the folk used to drinking fizzy yellow water.","RedwoodGeorge","Mar 11, 2006"
3.32,-3.8,3,3.5,3,4,3.5,"I must have had a bad bottle of this or perhaps one or more of my senses were ""off"" or not condusive to rating a beer the first time I rated this a few nights ago. I have since had this again. I didn't alter my ratings of A S T M D too much, but it was a little more pleasant experience the second go 'round. The colour didn't change at all, but there was a fluffy white head approximately a finger's thickness which surprisingly remained almost throughout consumption. It had a little different mouthfeel to it; and most notably, there was much more smell and taste present this time. More sweet malt both in smell and taste. This still isn't an amazing beer by any stretch, but I do have kinder words for it after trying it a second time.","SilentSabre","Mar 07, 2006"

3.42,-0.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours an almost brilliantly clear, bright gold color. It is topped by a quickly disappearing pale white head. The aroma has notes of sweet corn, a subtle herbal hop profile, and perhaps a touch of toasty malt in the finish. The taste has a definite sweet corn note to it as well. The beer is quite light on the palate and the finish has a nice level of astringent bitterness to it that serves as an offset to the sweet corn note. There is actually a fair amount of bitterness to this beer, and it really does help to keep the sweet grain character in check. This is a nice example of the style, and I could see myself drinking a couple of these on a hot, sweaty Summer day.","Gueuzedude","Feb 19, 2006"
2.95,-14.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,4.5,"The first sip I had of this I thought it was shit. Then I realized the potential it has, it gives me a good beer to drink after my first couple micros on friday nights. Rather than reverting to Bud Select or Coors Light and wanting to vomit afterwards.","KyleVick4","Feb 11, 2006"
2.83,-18,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Pours a crystal clear honey gold, with a single lone carbonation stream meandering to the surface. The head is bright white and crackling, consisting of loosely packed medium sized bubbles, that thins down to a dusting of fine bubbles. The smell is sweet and grainy, very clean with minimal hops. The taste is sweet and the corn is prominent, finishes with a gentle hop note, but not overly distinctive. Light body and a thin mouthfeel, not too much carbonation. Tastes a more like an American Macro lager. Perhaps if it had been a steamy hot summer day, it would have been easier to overlook the shortcomings.","hopsaplenty","Feb 06, 2006"
3.4,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"A smooth tasty beer that does what it aspires to be, just a good non-challenging beer. Very easy to drink and an excellent choice to nudge the macro drinker in your group towards better beer. Not a beer I would seek out but if I was in Atlanta and this was the best thing available next to Heineken I would pick this.","Zorro","Jan 25, 2006"
2.8,-18.8,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,"This is the only ""cream ale"" I have ever tried and I was largely unimpressed. Pour a Budweiser charge $4.75 for it and you have this beer. The smell was largely of macro lager grains. The appearance was a transparent straw yellow with a one inch head. The head reduced down quickly to a film on top of the beer that laced very little. The mouthfeel was good with good carbonation and very fizzy. The taste was typical macro lager grain and adjunct. I did think that drinking three or four at a sitting would be easy enough but why would you want to?","sammy44","Jan 13, 2006"

3.84,11.3,3,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a bright golden color with a flourish of a white fizzy head that disappears almost immediately. Appealing aroma of light sweet malt, a bit of adjunct malt, biscuit, honey, and a touch of floral hops. Palate is a bit subdued, with light malt accompanying some mellow hops. An underlying biscuity character provides a bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Highly drinkable, a great session beer.","ElGordo","Nov 30, 2005"

Somewhat refreshing as a summer ale on a hot day, but not something I would buy again. Try this brewery's Rye Pale Ale for a real treat!","merlin48","Jul 17, 2005"
3.87,12.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"A good intro beer for the macro drinker or a micro lover who just wants a lighter beer. The real advantage this beer has over a macro is that it has flavor w/o overdoing it with the corn or presenting any off flavors that most people nearly freeze their macros to get rid of.","blitz134","Jul 04, 2005"
3.98,15.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Tastes of sweet pale malt. Lightly fruity and grassy. Corny. Finish of bitter hops, bitter to balance the sweetness. Creamy up front with a crisp finish.

3.13,-9.3,3,2.5,3,3.5,4,"Ok, when you think of cream ales you don't really think of much. And the truth is, they aren't really much. Terrapin does, however, take a mediocre (or worse) style and do something interesting with it. Spike is obviously a fan of hops and this beer is no different. Still, while a light, smooth beer like this could quickly become unbalanced by hops, the beer only has just enough to tease you and still keep the beer balanced. More than I expected.","aracauna","May 09, 2003"
