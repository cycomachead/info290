4.01,28.1,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"This is just a very standard, flavorful lagery cream ale, and as that it is the best I've ever had.  As a beer overall it's somewhat boring and isn't going to compete with any great beers out there, but for what it is, I honestly don't think you can do better.  It's very sessionable, goes down incredibly easily, and would pair well with a wide range of foods while also tasting good enough to drink on its own.  This is something I'd want to have a case of at the beach.  Based on those observations, I would consider this beer to be very underrated.","Cylinsier","Jan 15, 2015"

Mild flavors of corn, bread, very faint and fleeting hop presence, which was expected. All-in-all, this is a nice beer.

3.33,6.4,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Nice looking beer with a golden straw, hazy look. Apple cider quality with a nice 2 finger pillow off white head. Nose was of orange peel, citrus, biscuits and honey. Not overpowering, but adequate. Taste was similar to the nose with a nice straw, citrus hit on the front and the noble hops add a punch to the end. Not over the top hops, but a good balance. A bit on the sweet side, but again not overpowering. Feel is a bit on the watery side on the front with a good bit of carbonation to add to the dry finish. Overall- A decent Blonde with nice character and very sessionable. A bit on the sweet side which was a distraction for me. Good blend of hops and citrus notes. Not a bad beer, but nothing that stands out as spectacular. Wouldn't turn one down and the low price helps-","TheDinger","Apr 18, 2012"

3.58,14.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Served in what appeared to be a weizen glass at the Charlotte airport (long layover). Pours a straw gold with a translucent clarity. Head was half inch, rocky and bright white and eventually settled into a solid skim. Nose is clean and somewhat subdued - primarily biscuity malts and perhaps some citric acid. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is more of a cereal grain presence in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation and a clean finish. Overall, not a bad American Blonde. A decent, easy drinking session beer that pairs well with food, but there's nothing overly distinctive about this offering in my opinion.","Jwale73","Mar 20, 2012"

I had not ever had anything from Carolina before but it was nice to see that they obviously put some effort into what they do. This was definitely a quality ale and something I would like to enjoy again, especially on a warm day.","mikesgroove","Beers"

3.06,-2.2,4,3,3,3,3,"Trying the Foothills Brewing Carolina Blonde at the Taste of Carolina at the B concourse in Charlotte, NC airport. The beer poured a clear golden color with thin white head that dissapates quickly....not much lacing. The smell includes hints of lemon and barley. The taste bursts with a tart lemon zing....the malt never realy kicks in to balance the beer. Teh mouthfeel is light to medium with big carbonation. Overall it is ok...would be great for the summer time.","WoodBrew","0"
