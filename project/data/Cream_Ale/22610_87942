3.75,-3.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.75,"I tried this because it seems to be a popular item where I work and I've heard good things about Mother Earth Brew Co. It pours a nice light orange color with a modest head. The smell is mild and pleasant. The initial aroma is faint vanilla that gives way to an earthy smell I can't really define. The taste is heavy on the malt with a subtle--yet noticeable--vanilla flavor. The taste finishes off with a distinct bready characteristic. The breadiness in the aftertaste is unique, but I can't really put my finger on what it is. Overall, this is a solid, refreshing beer that tastes a lot like cream soda. A perfect beer for a hot day, or if you need a break from some of more robust ales out there. (in fact, I bought this cause all I had was Mission's Dark Seas Imperial Stout, but didn't want anything heavy).","thomda11","Jun 21, 2014"

Smell is of malt, vanilla, the candy stick that comes in a Fun Dip, and slight grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with vanilla and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an interesting but fairly strong vanilla presence all around.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 18, 2013"

3.99,2.8,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Poured a beautiful deep orange/amber with a thin ring of whit head. It looks pretty good, not at all like any form of adjunct lager. Scent is very sweet, with heavy notes of cream, maize and sweet malt. It's a simple, yet pleasant scent, like a cream soda, or vanilla soda. Flavor follows the nose, very sweet. Heavy sweet cream flavors and vanilla, laid over a solid backbone of sweet malt and maybe some maize adjuncts, with a moderate level of floral and earthy hops that balance the sweetness. The end of the sip and the aftertaste are slightly bitter, especially for the beer's 21 IBUs. It's unique, has a nice combination of sweet and bitter and the vanilla notes are excellent. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It drinks smooth and creamy, as it should. Quite an excellent mouthfeel. I like this beer a lot. It has a nice flavor, that's sweet without being cloying and balances in some bitterness. It has a pleasant vanilla heavy scent and an excellent medium bodied creamy mouthfeel. I'd drink this one again.","Auraan","Jul 23, 2013"
