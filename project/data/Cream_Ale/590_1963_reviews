"Very light, minimal taste, good carbonation"
""
""
"Really nothing better on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a solid, go to, easy drinking summer beer."
""
""
"Really enjoyed this flagship from the Wisconsin brewery."
""
"Unlike any beer I've had before, very refreshing and delicious.  I can't wait to try this again in the middle of summer!"

"12oz bottle (also sampled on draft at the airport) poured into shaker pint. Yellow and slightly cloudy body with a rocky white head. Retention is good and there’s some lacing. Aroma is of crackers, grainy malt, corn, a little lager-y fruit, and a hint of grassy hops.Taste is sweet malt, corn, and fruit with a little grassy bitterness on the finish. Medium-light body, creamy texture, average-plus carbonation, abrupt sweet finish."
"O: very much a casual afternoon, graduation party kind of beer"
"Smooth. An above average tailgate beer. Wish it was sold outside Wisconsin."

"Easy drinking beer for the masses. Says cream ale but comes across like a Lager, Seems to me more malt forward. Has a little bit of sweetness that coats your mouth. Fairly bland other than that"
""
"Over all, not bad.  Light and smooth.  You do get a nice IPA taste.  No bitter after taste."
""

""

"Wish it was available outside of Wisconsin.  This beer is 100 times better on tap."
""
""
"A very drinkable beer.  I was surprised by the overall lightness.  But despite the lightness, there was still plenty of flavor - a bit of hops and a bit of malt."
""
""
""
""
"I thought I was drinking Miller Lite"
"Smooth beer with no bad flavors."
""
"Fantastic beer! Hard to find but well worth it if you are in Wisconsin."
""
"A great ""regular"" beer, I'm always in good spirits as I open one of these bottles. Good for mass consumption, even better at a bowling alley!"
"After throwing a few of these back it is easy to see why this brew is a staple in summer sessionables."
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing ale that tastes very similar to a lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most pleasant beers I've smelled, lacking in anticipated fruit flavor though. Overall B-"
""
""
""
"Can't say it does much for me - Genesee Cream Ale for me is the standard for cream ale - New Glarus' version is pretty much the same.  Other than maybe a little head retention and possibly a slightly fuller taste than the Geney - there's nothing wrong with this beer - nothing amazing either.  Just a good representation of a nice coiffing summer beer that I happen to be drinking on New Year's Day."
""
""
"This is my to go summer beer. Always a great choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer for a hog summer day after cutting the grass"
""
"If I lived in WI, this would be my daily. It's smooth, goes down easy, and doesn't fill you up right away. Solid beer."

"Bought in Milwaukee, brought home to CT. Cask conditioned ale, poured from a bottle. Had a slightly cloudy golden color, nice creamy head with good lacing. Sweet aroma.  Mild taste, subtle flavors with a bit of malt sweetness.  Overall, a nice cream ale with a low abv, perfect for a lunch when you need to keep working in the afternoon!"

"This beer tasted no different than a standard AAL in my opinion.  Did not smell or taste any fruitiness, creaminess,  or corn for that matter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite cream ale. Centered carbonation. Smooth from start to finish, light fizz. Absolutely enjoyable. A front porch/football tailgate beer"

"16 oz. draft at Pizzeria Piccola,"
""
""
""
""
"Very light and bland, not much stands out. It's really easy to drink and refreshing on a warm night. Can only draw small cream notes, honestly if I didn't know it was, I likely could not tell. I do pull orange notes. Taste more like a wheat. Very light and somewhat forgettable~"

"Overall: this is the perfect cream ale as far as I know. does a really well job of taking all the good flavors of everything and combining them into a nice light and flavorful beer. I can see why this beer is so popular among non-craft beer enthusiasts too."
"It is too much like a lager for my tastes, but I did enjoy the creaminess.  I picked up the malt with very little hop balance, though the malt was not overpowering by any means. Meh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours brilliant and yellow with a white head. Carbonation level is good. Flavor profile is very clean, almost like a lager more than a farmhouse. Hops are subdued as are the grains. Everything in harmony. Beer is very refreshing, this is more of what I would imagine a farmhouse to have been like back in the day. More refreshing than funky."
""
""
"A nice, easy going Wisconsin Farmhouse Ale. Very refreshing, nothing flashy."

"Overall:  Definitely my go-to beer when in Wisconsin.  It tastes great and is very easy to drink while being leaps and bounds above most American Lagers, including New Glarus' own Totally Naked.  The relatively low ABV also allows you to have more than one without too much effect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For a Wisconsite, Spotted Cow is the default craft beer. It is easy pleasing, and very accessible, with a very clean flavor. While this is rarely any beer enthusiast's favorite beer, as most beer enthusiasts lean towards a more robust style, this is my favorite beer to provide to a broad audience of beer enthusiasts, beer drinkers, and beer novices alike."

"I’ve always thought this was a nice gateway beer. I know many people in Wisconsin who would say this is there first full flavor beer. Overall, I think it is pretty good. Pours like a normal lager. Golden in color. Big white head. The aroma is kind of yeasty and citrus fruits. Fairly bitter tasting. Really has flavor all around the tongue. Would recommend anyone visiting the south west area of Wisconsin to not only visit the New Glarus Brewery, but also the town itself, as it is a charming Swiss like town."

"This beer is smooth and creamy, light and delicious. A good anytime beer and classic Wisconsin. It is easy on the palate and has wide appeal."
""
""
"This is light bodied and boasts moderate levels of carbonation. An easy drinking brew and just ok per style. No thrills, forgetable beer but serves a purpose for the flavor challenged drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my all-time favorite beers."
""
""
"Overall: This used to be a beer I mocked due to its folklore-ish type popularity.  But now approaching it with an open mind, it is easy to see why this is such a popular beer by the masses, and should be equally popular with geeks.  A perfectly executed cream ale should be highly drinkable with creamy decadent malts and a splash of hops, which is exactly what the cow brings.  No longer will I discredit this beer because everyone loves it, which was a ridiculous thing to do in the first place, but instead enjoy it often for its truly wonderful characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If this weren't in a New Glarus bottle, I'd assume it was a local brew like Grain Belt.  A little darker in color, with way better head retention.  The lightness and malt favor of the corn is readily apparent, and drinks as such.  I kinda hate to say it, given how awesome New Glarus is, but I got a lot of High Life/PBR similarities from this one.  Appearance is awesome, but falls short on flavor."
""
""
""

"Light fruity and vey and drinkable.  Pours a light orange with a little cloudiness and a thin head."

"Overall - I truly can understand why this beer is the staple go-to beer in the state of Wisconsin. Its nothing over the top but easily any BMC drinker could switch to this one as well as be appreciated by craft beer nerds as well. I wish every state had a similar, fresh, local go-to beer of this caliber. Makes me want to go on a road trip to Cheese-head country."

"Pours a hazy golden in color with a thin white head that settles down to just along the sides of the glass. A good amount of lacing was seen that stuck to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of sweet bread for the most part with a hint of hops. More going on with the taste of white bread, with some malt and a hint of floral and corn. Perfect carbonation and medium bodied. Easy to drink and goes down easy with no harsh or bitter aftertaste. A good brew!"

"O: BA calls this a ""cream ale", NG calls this a ""Naturally Cloudy Farmhouse Ale"" - I can see both points of view - the closest thing I could compare this to would be a zwickelbier, but without the lemony and grassy flavors and rounder, fuller body I often get with those... drink this like your ordinary, everyman lager - I like it for what it is, it stands out"
""

"O - easy to drink with a great feel in the mouth. would definitely buy again."

""
""
"O - Overall this was a solid representation of a cream ale. Only knock would be how lack luster the nose is."
""
""
"Overall: If I needed a go-to summer beer, lawnmower beer, or party beer and lived in Wisconsin, I would buy nothing else. This beer is perfect for drinking in quantity when you want something lighter for yourself (and guests) and still be craft with decent flavor. A perfect beer for summer. Marvelous."

"This is a great example of how a farmhouse ale should taste. I've had this beer probably a hundred times and enjoy it everytime. Has a color similar to shiner bock. As a nice foamy head that sticks to the sides of the glass and kelt recedes to the beer. When you smell it, it almost smells like a farm (corn stalks, hay, wheat)! When you have your first taste, I pick up hints of corn and a bit of hops to finish. Has a nice even texture when sliding off the back of your palate down your throat. Doesn't have any twist at the end, but a beer I like to drink on the back porch on an evening, while looking out at the lake. Would recommend this to anyone who likes farmhouse style beers. Cheers!"
""

"Overall an alright brew, would buy again but nothing to write home about."
"Fine session ale, here, yes."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a pint glass. Not going to say a lot on this, except a little disappointed. Normally I love this brewery's beers, but this was just a little too bland and over carbonated for me. If you're used to more complex brews, please don't judge these guys on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very average beer nothing too exciting here. If you like the macro stuff there isn't much deviation in this beer from those."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is apparently only available in Wisconsin and seems to be beloved in the Great Lakes states. I really enjoyed it. It had a smooth, simple taste of farmhouse grains--easy drinking, not too fancy. I didn't really pick up any of the fruitiness the label mentioned. It was full-bodied with a well-balanced flavor. Somehow exactly how I would want a beer from a brewery in a tiny town in Wisconsin to taste."
""
""
""
""
"Light hazy golden color with a decent amount of soft foam for a moment that fades to a ring and small patches. Aroma is a very light biscuit like smell, it feels soft and easily drinkable. Flavor is light and malty and ever so slightly fruity they way you'd expect a cask ale to be. Overall a nice easy to drink light malty beer."

"O - One of my least favorite beers. What's the hype about? I feel like it must be people who don't know beer that really just want to drink Milwaukee's best, but would like to feel classy at the same time. It's perfect for that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light straw color. Just a shade darker than a lager macrobrew. Creamy 2 finger head with good retention. Medium lacing. Smell is subdued - yeast ,some bready malts, very little hops. Smells similar to a good lager. Smooth, well balanced taste. A great session beer. No hints of alcohol. Light and effervescent dances off of the tongue. Not an overly exciting or extreme beer. A very solid tasty refreshing beer made with quality ingredients and a staple here in the dairy state."

"After drinking aggressively hopped beers for a few days, I first sampled this beer and was underwhelmed. As a buddy from Wisconsin urged me to retry it, I was pleasantly surprised. The light fruitiness and mouthfeel are very nice and this illustrates the variability of the palate in beer tastes and overload."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is like a cow among the herd. One of many, nothing makes this better or standout from any of the other cows. Surprised to see the high ratings, maybe more representative of the rest of the brewery's line? Really falls short in terms of taste and substance for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'll admit that I haven't had many cream ales, but this is the best that I can remember. This is an awesome, drinkable beer. If I lived in Wisconsin, I would get a pitcher of this every time I went to a bar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Didn't really blow me away. A nice lawn mowing beer. Smooth but kinda boring. Sort of like a cow standing out in a field."
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a creamy white two finger head with good retention and lacing. Mild aroma of biscuit malt, grains, hints of citrus. Flavor is very pleasant semi-sweet bready malt, slight grassy hops, lightly buttery wheat, faint citrus. Finishes with mellow sweet malt and wheat. Unexpectedly moderate creamy body with a great mouth feel. I see why locals are so happy about this ale. This is the beer that I think the mass producers *think* they are brewing, simple, mellow and pleasantly drinkable. When I'm this satisfied with a style that I'm not that excited about, the brewers have really excelled. Easily the best cream ale I've ever had. Nicely done. Thanks to Vikki for bringing this back from Wisconsin."
""
""
""
""

"Thick fluffy head sitting on a light gold body. Scent of sweet hay and grassy hops. Taste is sweet and fruity; apple, pear and grape with undertones of masa and corn husk. Close to no hop flavors detectable, and very appropriate for style. Thin bodied and fully carbonated, light yet completely satisfying. Definitely a session beer for all seasons, lucky to get my hands on some all the way here in Southern California. God bless bottle trading!"

"Definitely worth trying."

"This is perhaps the best, most enjoyable beer produced in the great state of Wisconsin. It's smooth, light flavor is an ideal beer to share among friends year round. It is arguably the most beloved beer in the state. As it is only available within state borders, I recommend you stock up next time you are driving through."
""
"The flavor is clean with a finish of champagne. Will pare well with food, but not a beer that stands alone. Worth a try...."
"This is a fantastic everyday beer. It pours light with a relatively thin head. It has a nice aroma which agrees with the fresh taste. Simply put this beer tastes like beer. It has a great finish and is the perfect beer to sit around with your friends any time of year. I always stock up with spotted cow when I am in Wisconsin."

""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours golden yellow with a small white head. Smells of sweet grain and corn, not like an adjunct but with a nice grain profile. Tastes of nice grain with just enough corn for sweetness. Beer is crisp and clear light bodied and perfectly carbonated. Overall a pretty good beer."

"I had this beer on tap at Tornado Steakhouse in Madison, Wisconsin. In my opinion this beer tastes like what you would get if you tried to make Bud light with all very high quality ingredients. It was good, but very bland. There isn't anything you can complain about in it. It's even very drinkable, and I could probably drink this all night if it was available. But I really like a bit more flavor in my beer."

""
"this style isn't my favorite but i was in a place traveling that didn't have hardly any craft beers to choose from. it was also one of the first craft cream ales i had so i'd have to say it was fairly good although it did have a corny taste. but overall i can't complain. it was a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: overall this was my first cream ale and it was pretty good."
"While I'd prefer a steam beer or a kolsch when it comes to lighter, lager-influenced ales, this is a good beer. It'd be a great beer for introducing a BMC drinker to craft. It's nothing special, but I can see why it has such a fervent local following, spanning all spectrums of beer drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""

"Golden colored ale with a pretty minimal head. Very good clarity on this beer. The aroma is pretty straight forward with the smell of light malt and corn. Very smooth mouthfeel. Just a quick splash of light malt and corn flavor. Aftertaste is non existent and watery. This is not my thing, but it isn't bad."

"This is the perfect hot summer day beer, i could drink a bath tub full of this. Its not quite a farmhouse not quite a cream ale, kind of a perfect mix of the two. This is a great beer that appeals to the masses i cant think of any one not likeing it."
"Overall: this is a delight to have and will make it a regular for its smooth, easy, satisfying taste. Finely crafted and not an over the top beer."

"O: Been to Cheese Land a couple of times and remember this one being on tap just about everywhere I went. Obviously NG's best-seller. I can see why."

"This is a Cream Ale? I don't know what style I would have guessed this to be, but it doesn't taste like any Cream Ales I've had... then again, I haven't had a craft Cream Ale, I don't think. Uh. That probably makes a difference. This has that ""beer"" color -- sunset orange. There's about two or three fingers worth of a creamy looking head. Lacing is above average. Nice start... gotta love a good looking beer. The smell is initially what made me wonder what the damn style was. Mild grassy/earthy hops and Play-Doh/dough just about hit the aroma on the head for me, although seeing others mention banana and clove isn't a surprise... I can see that. Taking a sip, I get the same thing. How does a beer that has a pretty big ""dough"" profile taste good? Leave it to New Glarus. While I'm not a huge fan of this, it's memorable. I'm pretty confident that I won't taste another beer quite like this. A respectable beer."

"Now this is what I love to drink every day of summer for the past two years. This golden goodness of this beer has a hint of citrus and is slightly sweet and with a touch of hops to bring your taste buds all together and cheer. Sad that I can't get this beer here in Chicago, but at least it gives me a reason to go to Milwaukee to pick up a few cases when visiting friends. So great to enjoy on the back porch when listening to some Blues records on a summer day. Made my birthday just golden today."
"Overall: Very sessionable beer, great for warm days."

"Bottle from a friend. Pours clear light golden with a head that recedes quickly and fizzy. Aroma of corn and Bud Light. Taste is a very light and drinkable effervescent sweet honey corn and hay flavor, much like a light lager but without any dirtiness on the finish. Clean and crisp with big carbonation and very light mouthfeel. Good for summertime out on the lake."
"D – Very drinkable. This is my go to beer when doing yard work or sitting by the pool on a hot day. Very sessionable beer."

"Spotted cow is a staple in my diet. a good full flavored beer with a sweet malt that just melts in your mouth. Poured into a pint glass this beer has a small amount of head with good looking lace, color is a nice light gold while being quite cloudy. I highly recommend this beer."

"A very well done beer. I can see why it is an institution in Wisconsin. The beer pours a bit hazy, with a good amount of carbonation. The flavors linger on the tongue after a sip for only a moment. Overall, quite refreshing. This beer will drink well on a hot summer's day."

"O- best cream ale I've tried so far. I've brewed one, and drank a lot of the rise to the top cream ale from the third street brew house in the bottle and on tap. This is clean, lager like, easy drinking, and everything I envision a cream ale should be. If I found a good price on a case I'd be all over it."

"A refreshing summer ale."
""
""
""
""
"I have been drinking spotted cow on and off for about 15 years and every time I have tried it I scratch my head. I just don't get why this beer is so popular... I find it overly sour and astringent. Sadly, it reminds me of beers gone bad. New glarus, has some amazing beers, and IMO ALL of them are better than Spotted Cow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the PERFECT brew to convert people from Miller/coors/bud/inbev into REAL craft bier."
"A gateway beer that is also really friggin' good?Brewed by a master brewer who cut his teeth in Germany and knows a thing or two about session beer?...only in Wisconsin"
""
""
""
"O: Nothing to write home about. Actually very similar to a macro, but with slightly more body and flavor. Would be a good substitute to serve non-craft drinking friends."
""
""
"nice cream ale, a style id like to have more of available. this one pours nice and clear, flatish looking, sort of matted blonde in color, orange hues, two inch head. the nose is sort of bland malt on the light side, some sweetness, and a grassy hop complex that seems unfamiliar. the flavor too features that unique hopping. its not hoppy per se, but the hops used impart a new flavor to me, and combined with the light malt and unidentified sugar, makes for a really unique and drinkable light beer. to me, like the moon man, this is an all day beer. everythings in balance, nothing is too bold or brutal, and its not a boring drink at all. civilized might be a good way to describe this one. bright carbonation and a smooth textured light body lend to superior sessionability. maybe not as adventurous as some other new glarus brews, but certainly as skillfully crafted. beer me another!"
""
""
""
"A great Wisconsin Classic from New Glarus . One of my personal favorites. Nothing too special just a nice simple beer. 90% of the time I enjoy it from the bottle. On the rare occasion I will drink it from a pint glass. Either way it is a good beer if you are looking for quantity. Great Job!"
"This pours a cloudy golden color with a light white foam atop it. No hop aroma to speak of, although I get a light orange peel & coriander whisper. The flavor is light, crisp, and has a pleasant sweet wheat note with a clean finish. The Spotted Cow has a crisp, fruity note on the flavor with a light corn malt sweetness. I imagine this could show the BMC macros a thing or two. In fact, I could drink this all day on a summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, New Glarus certainly makes more interesting and flavorful beer than Spotted Cow but it's easy to see why this is their flagship beer: anybody can drink it. Simple, clean, light, and refreshing. This is the kind of beer you want handed to you after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day. This is the kind of beer you want a whole cooler full of at a backyard BBQ. This is the kind of beer you want to drink outside with the sun shining behind it, illuminating its beauty. Understated, delicious, and utterly satisfying. One of life's simple pleasures."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a perfect brew for someone just starting out in the micro/craft beer world. its highly drinkable and is a step up from the mega domestics (al la Miller, Coors, Bud, etc)"

""
""
""
""
"O- Easy drinker, just enough flavour and balance that you can easily drink a bunch of it and not feel bad about it. Good staple to have in the household."
""
""
"Decent brew, for the style. Carbonation may be a bit high, but fairly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw yellow, with a frothy white head. Smell is weak, a little malt, a little grain. Taste is malty and light, with a hint of bitterness. A very light beer, nice carbonation. A good beer for what flavor is there, nothing spectacular, but a solid beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall it's fairly easy drinking, but this really doesn't appeal to me at all. Tastes like a slightly better ""adjunct"" but not by much, don't feel inclined to try another either."

"Review from notes"
""
""

""

"Overall: A pretty decent light beer. Light with a corny taste but its far better than a typical BMC lager. Would make a great gateway into craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours a hazy light yellow/gold with a thin white head. Smell is a little on the sweet side with hints of maybe apple or even a little grape. Flavor follows the nose, this is essentially a better version of an adjunct lager that brings a slight hint of apple and sweetness to go along with the usual corn of the adjuncts. It's far from spectacular tasting, but it's a good representation of what it is. Mouthfeel is thin-medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is essentially the high end version of your average light lager. It's pretty decent, and I can see why the Wisconsin-ites swear by it in the summer, but it's far from great, just above average."
""
""
""
""
"O- Very good beer but kind of plain. Loved by all my friends who don't drink craft beer but still enjoyed by those that do. Very easy to drink all night."

"O – This is a solid cream ale. I’m not really a big fan of the style since it’s essentially an adjunct “ale,” but this is a great example of the style. For a cream ale, this is very tasty and definitely refreshing and drinkable. Great lawnmower beer. Nicely done, NG."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours light straw with slight diaphany, a central dome of white foam. Smells of white grapes, hay, some corn and powdered milk. Flavor of beer, milk and some rice, the aftertaste is slightly sweet and the beer would go well with vanilla bean ice cream in the summertime. Thin with moderate carb and a semi dry, crisp finish. An okay beer."

"My favorite beer of all. Goes down smooth but still has some body to it. Problem is that they only sell it in Wisconsin which is a problem since I live in AZ now. I had to bring about 6 cases out with me before I moved. The color is fine and the mouthfeel is smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice summer beer, almost adjunct lager in style. This one is smooth and ejoyable but not overly complex. A nice warmer weather beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Thanks to a friend who brought back a 6pack for me, it was a solid brew. All my non-craft friends loved it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall nothing out of this world but I can definitely see why this is one of Wisconsin's most popular craft beers. It appeals to many crowds and is utterly non offensive. A winner for those who enjoy good beer and those who may have no idea what good beer is."
"Overall, a fun, tasty beer. If you're looking for something to drink regularly, go for Spotted Cow. It does feel and taste a little thin toward the end, but the flavors stay intact for the most part. Cheers!"
"Thanks"

"O - A fantastic offering from New Glarus. Each time I have a Spotted Cow, I understand more and more why this beer is their staple. It i a fantastic Wisconsin farmhouse ale with an unmistakable character. I do like it much more on tap than in the bottle, but it doesn't detract from this great brew. Great from start to finish."

"Taste is slightly grainy with a hint of lemon and pepper(not much of either). Slightly overcarbonated which left me rather dry in my mouth. You wouldn't go wrong sitting around drinking a bunch of this, but not distinctive."
""
""
""
""
"I got this on trade and have this sometimes when I visit WI. Pours a slightly cloudy light lemon drop yellow, not very fussy or foamy either. Nose is clean and subtle, like the beer I drank in college 25 years ago. Nose has some floral notes, and malt and grain and some breadiness. Taste is lemony, and citrus and grains in good balance but as expected, not really that hop forward (I'm missing more bitterness volume...next up must be an IPA), but satisfying nevertheless. Mouth-feel is refreshing, alcohol is light, carbonation is more muted, finer and not at all scrubbing. Overall a very good brew and respectful of the style, but I'd reach for their moon-man if I were in a buying mood."
""
""
""
"Overall - worth trying one time. I wouldn't buy it again! I may or may not drink it again. I can't get it where I am, so not a big deal. It's not a bad beer, just not real great either. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere if you are looking for a thrill. If you get tthis free, drink it!"

"O - Enjoyable beer tha it true to its style. Right up there with Sixpoint Sweet Action which is my other cream ale favorite."
"Pours pale straw in color, slightly hazy, with bountiful carbonation bubbles. The aroma is mild, mostly grainy, with a hint of fruitiness and some hops. The flavor pretty much matches the smell, with no specific element really carrying the load. I fail to see how this manages to be the flagship brew of a very respectable brewery with many superior offerings in the stable. Maybe because it most resembles light beer? Regardless of the reason, this just doesn't resonate with me."
""
""
"Spotted Cow pours a hazy, honey-gold color, and is capped with a thin white head that provides a moderate amount of lace. Light aromas of caramelized malt, grain, and a touch of corn blend together to make a wonderful bouquet. On the pallet the brew starts out with a light breadiness with the corn again peaking out ever so subtly, before a malty sweetness melts into a restrained hop bitterness. Moderate amounts of carbonation and a medium body round out this Wisconsin-only treat."
""
""
""
"This is a smooth, easy drinking, light, refreshing offering that is perfect for sipping on a hot day. If I could regularly get my hands on this, it would be a good go to session beer."
""
""
"O- I can see why this beer is so popular, very drinkable and a unique session ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Could drink this beer all day all year around but in the summer is the best. A must have for the fridge."
"O - I'll be honest; New Glarus' money-maker, what I consider two steps away from a light beer, is not for me. I appreciate the beer for how well-crafted it is, which reflects in the review, but I appreciate the business behind it much more so; if it allows them to do all the other terrific beers I'm in love with, then so be it! With that said, Spotted Cow appeals to the masses wonderfully with it's fuller-than-light-beer but not-intrusive flavor and creamy, easy drinking body. They call it a Wisconsin Farmhouse Ale which fits with their ""drink indigenous"" theme (which I'm all for!) but I certainly wouldn't liken Spotted Cow to what people typically understand as a Farmhouse Ale or, Belgian Saison. But hell, it sells outrageously and people come from out-of-state to buy it by the case-load, so what do I know?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Simple & straightforward but well-made, this would be a good transition beer for those accustomed to macro-lagers."
""
""
"O - I was excited to try a New Glarus beer; however, this is not one to be excited about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really tasty brew that is purposefully understated, but still with some intricacies. This would be a perfect beer to introduce somebody to the craft beer world. I can't say I'd ever go back to WI for a whole case, but I will definitely enjoy the other two I have. Cheers!"
"Pours a lightly hazed golden yellow, long lasting cap of bubbles, some sheets of lacing. Scent brings shortbread like sweetness with faint watery fruit and creamed corn. Taste follows suit, not overly complex but full flavored for the style. Lighter side of medium, slightly slick and bubbly. One of the top beers in style due to its solid flavor profile. Good BMC alternative."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Drinking the beer that New Glarus is known for turned out to be somewhat disappointing, but that shouldn’t discourage prospective drinkers from trying it, and those who have also been disappointed or felt indifferent should give the other great New Glarus brews a shot. Also worth noting is that the Cow really varies, sometimes from bottle to bottle, batch to batch, and certainly from tap to tap; some glasses are really delicious and deserving of a 4-4.5, but most are somewhere between 2-3.5, sadly. If drunk on the porch on a hot summer day, this otherwise mediocre beverage gains roughly .5-it is that refreshing. 13/20"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Reminds me very much of a AAL. Mild flavor with corn and a vague spiciness and citrus flavor and a terrible aftertaste. Not very good. I think I just really don't like Cream Ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too bad it's pretty much impossible to get this beer over here (Netherlands). Maybe it need to import and distribute it :)"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Delicious and highly drinkable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The bottle yielded a full glass of a hazy deep yellow body. The head of the beer looks more like an adjunct cap of wispy white foam. The nose is full of yeasty bread and a bit of corn. There isn't a lot of malt in the nose or the taste. Perhaps the best part of this beer is its mouthfeel. The body is really smooth and lightly carbonated. A really enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Purchased at Riley's Wines of the World in Madison, Wisconsin (dozens of times). This beer is a great session beer. It has great taste and great balance. Lighter than many New Glarus alternatives, but brewed with the same care and attention to detail. The beer very flavorful, without overpowering. The beer also has a subtle, yet warming creamy mouthfeel - especially noticeable if served slightly warmer the typical serving temperature."
"O: A really nice cream ale. Doesn't quite stand up to my Genny Cream Ale but it's mostly due to nostalgia :). Regardless, this is a good beer. Easy drinker."

"O- I wish I lived in WI just to drink spotted cow while doing lawn work. Excellent job NG"

"Pours like a lager -- although with a slighty cloudy appearance. Golden yellow with a bright white head. Nice clean smell with a nice hint of hops. Wonderful taste. Light, bright and clean -- not overly hopped -- with a nice citrus edge to it. Terrific creamy mouth feel. A wonderful product."
""
""
""
"D - Why make things complicated? This is close to an ideal session Saison-esque brew. It's really what I wish adjunct brews could be."
"O - Drinkable, crisp, but lacks complexity."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid beer that would be great for hot summer days but so is water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a really nice clear yellow color with a bone white head on top. The lacing on this beer was quite impressive. The smell of the beer had some very light hop aromas but were mostly covered by the sweet malt character this brew has. The taste of the beer screamed cream ale right off the first sip to me. It's slightly sweet with a grainy malt flavor with just the lightest amount of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was light bodied, easy going, drinkable and nicely carbonated. Overall this beer is one that you could drink a lot of if you choose too. It's a refreshing brew and can be enjoyed just about anytime of the year."

"O: A good interpretation of the style and very easy to drink. I could easily drink a few of these or more in a sitting. Not one that will have you thinking about it too much in terms of trying to pick out taste and aromas, but nothing wrong with it either. Just a nice easy drinking cream ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good for a cream ale, but I don't think it's my favorite style. Not many strong flavors to distinguish this from similar kinds, although the balance (as usual from NG) is excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is really hard for me to admit this, being a Bears fan but you cheese eating weirdos pulled it off with this one. New Glarus has a number of good beers and the spotted cow is as good as just about any of them. It is a very well balanced and medium bodied brew with a mildly lingering citrus taste and aroma. It pours a nice yellow and sits well in a pint glass. All-in-all, it is a well crafted 'back to the basics' beer, simply, it is what beer is supposed to taste, look, and feel like."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This fan favorite from Wisconsin pours a golden amber color with a pillowy white head. Has a very grassy, grainy scent. Taste is smooth and mellow as you take in the wheat flavors. Taste is clean and refreshing. Go anywhere in southern Wisconsin and I’m sure you’ll be able to find it."

"Probably my favorite creme ale that I've had, this is a true sessionable brew. Hoist one if you can get it!"
""
""
"New Glarus has done a great job creating a highly sessionable cream ale that is well-balanced and has a long, smooth finish riding on a sweet corn flavor yet dry in feel. Considering I don't normally chose this style, I enjoyed this one a lot."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a slightly hazy dark yellow color with a cotton-white cap of foam. The bread in the nose mixes with a little corn. Malt on the palate moves into a tinge of metallic adjunct through the center. Just a touch of bitterness at the end. The beer goes down smooth and creamy. A drinkable brew."
""
""
"Pours a hazy pale yellow with a white head. In the aroma, light banana and a sparkling like aroma. In the taste, sugary and a light dry banana. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a light dry banana like aftertaste. Quite carbonated, light flavor, but more of a wheat compared to a cream ale."
"O - it's been about a year and a half since i last tasted this beer and it's just as good, although it can't beat drinking it while on tour with good friends!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would kill to have this as an every day drinking beer. It's at home with a day of mowing the lawn and football games or just sitting around and enjoying. A nice level of flavor and just enough of it to keep things interesting."
""

"By this point, this beer is an iconic brew in Wisconsin and helped make New Glarus brewery a major player in the State's micro brewery scene. I have become more of a heavy beer fan so I don't look as fondly at Spotted Cow as I used to but it still has a very crisp, wheat, refreshing taste that makes it a great option for a session beer or a hot summer day. I have also always really enjoyed the cloudy look in the glass."

"O: I have nothing to compare it to, but I like it a lot. Very easy-drinking."
"O - Could use a little more head retention and slightly watery, but it's a great light lager and highly drinkable."
""
"O-A beer that has transformed many a beer drinker in WI from always grabbing a lager to having this extremely drinkable ale on hand."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: Nothing special, just a really well done low ABV ale. The flavors are simple but not boring, it’s crisp but not harsh and more importantly, it goes down so easily. Great to drink on a warm day or with a nice meal, and a great beer to convert a macro lager drinker."
""
"Cream ales are my style of choice that most BA's don't like. I've always had a soft spot for this one and it's a very easy drinking light ale that actually has taste and mouthfeel behind it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Happy new years!"
"Pours crystal clear, light golden/yellow with about a half finger of fizzy, pure white head. Some lacing and so-so retention. Smells malty with some sugary corn and bread. Malt and corn wash over the palate, tasting similar to the smell, finishing off dry. Medium body, slightly creamy, with medium carbonation. Would like to see some more crispness. Overall, solid warm weather beer, quite drinkable (by construction). Bonus points for being one of my first crafty beers."

"o - Overall an interesting beer. The nose is a bit bland, but than the taste is very bready and creamy, which is pretty nice. The mouthfeel is near perfect, and it would be very easy to have a few of these. Something I'd like to try again sometime."
"This one came at me from an unexpected angle. When I saw the bottle, the name ""Spotted Cow"" immediately made me think of milk stout. I suppose for a cream ale, it makes sense, too. Very bright and lively, with some lemony tartness that called to mind a super-mild Berliner weisse crossed with a German pilsner. Surpisingly drinkable, and the ABV would make this an ideal quencher. This may be the first cream ale that really caught my attention."
""

""

""

""
""
"I'd probably like a few of these here in Florida on a hot day. Easily the lightest body out of all the cream ales I've had. Not sure why the bottle says farmhouse but BA categorizes it a cream ale. Definitely a lawnmower beer, but more drinkable than standard yellow swill."
"O: Not my favorite of all the New Glarus Beers i've tasted. this one had kind of subdued and boring flavors. It didn't taste bad but it didn't make me want to keep drinking it."
""
""
"First taste is medium spiciness and vanilla but fades to a sweet grain taste as you drink it. Quite unremarkable, just a boring beer to me. It's a bit fizzy, burns the throat a touch on the way down. Overall, a passable beer but nothing to go out of your way for."
""
""
""
"by the end of this delight I had several notes and all I was thinking was , how can I reproduce this beer. I will be spending some great time trying down the ingredients in this beer"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great beer to get someone who hasn't had anything other than bud light or pabst blue ribbon. In fact I would call this a great stepping stone beer. But once you know better- I don't know that you would like this beer any more than your average run of the mill pale. It is what it is - and that is fine by me."
""
""
""
"O -- I'd forgotten how good this beer is. It's the beer you want to have a few of without worrying over missing some complex character, yet it's not so bland that you forget you're treating yourself to something good."

"When i poured this one into a pint glass, it has a nice golden body with a nice 2' white creamy head. The smell has a citrus aroma but also a sweet one too. The taste is of a little lemon with some bubble gum hints. The mouthfeel is very nice, smooth, well carbonated. This beer is very drinkable and if i lived closer to wisconsin, i would use this as my go to beer."

"O - when I find out what I'm paying for this, I'm sure my thoughts on it would change. But, hey, I'm in an airport. This is a beer that I could session pretty easily. I'm a little confused on this beer though. BA lists it as a cream ale and the bottle says Wisconsin farmhouse ale. I side with BA on this one."
""
""
"O- This is a very refreshing beer. Would be a great session beer or something to drink outside during the summer. Would also be a great beer to offer to macro-drinkers looking to try craft beer."

"Feels light in body and refreshing to the palate."

"Pours hazy yellow-gold with a half inch of off-white foam that recedes in an average way leaving some clinging lace. Smell is virtually absent. I think it has some macro lager notes maybe corn and just a hint of malt but that's a stretch. Taste is not far from a macro lager either saved from the category by some hint of fruit possibly lemon that is detectable amidst notes of corn and barley and a light yeast nuttiness. Mouthfeel is decent, a bit creamy and holds together and let's you know this is a craft beer. Overall this one isn't great but it's drinkable and refreshing enough."

"Eh, I'm not too impressed with this one. The nose is flat, a touch of lemon in there. It tastes like it's a cheap beer trying to look bigger than it really is. It has a pilsener taste but seems a bit chalky, with the overall flavor being, just muddled. The body is ok, and thankfully that flavor wears off eventually. Too bad I have more of these from the sample pack."
"Hazy and golden color with somewhat of a head going on. Nothing aroma wise-it is simply there, perhaps the most neutral beer I have ever smelled! Decent crisp and very clean malty flavor. Just enough hop bite to notice. Touch of residual sweetness. Grassy and somewhat corn like flavors. Ok enough mouthfeel-the nice crispness really sets the tone here. A nice beer-I would not really call it a cream ale but still enjoyable. Wish I had a six pack for summer."
"Spotted Cow is about what I expected: a step up from the macros, but similar enough to please macro drinkers."
"D/O- Nothing really sticks out about Spotted Cow and I think that's the point. An easy ""every day"" beer for the masses that most would agree is a half-step up on your common BMC-types. Gets an A/A+ for drinkability."
"All in all, an extremely easy drinking beer. This is not a beer that aims to be spectacular, and isn't spectacular, but it's a pretty good everyday brew."
"I highly recommend picking one of these up if you stop in Wisconsin."
"The citrus fruit qualities add a layer of complexity to this easy-drinking cream ale. A beer I'd be proud to call a local favorite."
"O- Good beer any time. Really just always a good experience. Loved it in college, love it now. A must have when in Wisconsin, wish I could have it more often."
"O: A very well tasting and mild beer. If you are looking for something strong this isn't it. Nice and light."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, below average carbonation and very drinkable. Goes down smoothly and easily. Overall, not bad, but not really impressed. Pretty average but it is definitely refreshing after a long day at work."
"Hazed, pale yellow with a creamy off-white head. Sweet and corny, much like many old school macro lagers. Sweet butterscotch and sweet corn with untoasted grain and a touch of hop bittering in the finish. Pretty average fair here, not bad at all but not great at all. Somehow I remembered this beer being better than it is."
"O-Very easy drinking beer, flavored enough to enjoy while on the couch but nothing special. I must admit, I was expecting more from New Glarus, especially after hearing from friends how popular New Glarus is in WI."
"O-not bad just a simple easy to drink beer maybe I was expecting more from this one though"
"O- Don't believe the hype, this is not good. Go for the other new glarus brews, this is intended to appeal to Budweiser and Miller light drinkers. Overrated!"
"O - A very nice refreshing type of cream ale. One I enjoyed very much and wouldn't mind getting more."
"Overall a nice beer that I would love to have again."
"Overall, this is not a complex beer but always comes through in a pinch if I'm in WI for whatever reason. Anywhere that carries beer up there usually has this and it's a very respectable alternative to macros."
"The beer is very smooth and easy drinking as well."
"While obviously executed excellently, Spotted Cow seems like a dumbed down craft beer. It reminds me very much of Simpler Times Pilsner from Minhas that can be had for $2.99/6 at Trader Joe's."
"This is New Glarus's most popular beer, most probably because it's more sessionable than their more distinctive tasting brews. I would use it for that purpose if I lived in Wisconsin."
"Light to medium bodied, average carbonation, and underwhelming in almost every way. This is a pretty disappointing beer, from an otherwise good brewery."
"Worthy brew, something I would definitely buy to enjoy a few of in a night if it were in my distribution area, cheers!"
"O: I thought this was a very refreshing brew and I don't understand all the hate. Definitely a huge step above an adjunct lager and I thought it was a nicely crafted brew."
"My father was really pushing this one on me so I finally tried it. Actually, this is really decent beer for the summer. Light and crisp. Low bitterness. It's borderline Macro Adjunct but it walks the line finely and does it well."
"It's a rather nice brew, tasty and easy to drink, something I would certainly like to have again."
"Overall - I loved it. There is not anotherlight ale that can match the balance of bitterness, malt background with the excellent carbonation. I feel the need to head to Wisconsin and smell their ""Dairy Air"" and have another Spotted Cow."
"O: This is a good, easy-drinking lawnmower beer. Millions of cheddar heads can't be wrong about this one, can they?"
"o-decent lawnmower beer. That's about it"
"Overall - I loved it. I drank it with several other guys and they all loved it. It's a great ""go to"" beer from New Glarus."
"M - Light body; light carbonation."
"I am not overly enamoured with the Spotted Cow like others. Pours a slightly hazy pale straw color with a white head that faded quickly. In the aroma included grains with scents of citrus. Taste is grain, malt, and citus undertones with slight yeast character. Mouthfeel is medium body with a medium high carbonation. It ok overall, decent drink for the summer."
"O- Good, solid beer, just nothing to jump up and down about."
"Label says this is a farmhouse ale - but this is no saison. Yeast profile is totally different. If anything, this reminds me more of a Kölsch."
"Brought back a few when I was in WI just recently. Pours a slightly hazy pale straw color with a white 1 finger head that faded quickly. In the aroma I'm picking up a graininess balanced with citrus. Taste is more of the same with a slight yeast character. Mouthfeel is medium body with a medium high carbonation. Overall a great summer drinker. Well done NG!"
"I can tell why this is NG's cash cow, it is easily accessible to just about anybody, beer snob or joe blow. It hits the balance point between being simple enough to be accessible to the BMC drinkers on the college campus and flavorful enough with sufficient complexity to intrigue craft beer drinkers. Does a lot of things really well enough to be mainstream popular, but neither does it do any one particular thing spectacularly well either. For that sort of specialization, one needs only look to NG's other offerings to be easily satisfied."
"Overall: Don't get me wrong, I just love New Glarus beers, but my memory of this beer far exceeds what I'm experiencing now. This beer would be great for a barbeque with a bunch of people around who aren't too into beers or hops. I'll take it over a BMC any day, probably even Yuengling, but beyond that, I'll branch out."
"Poured into my bruery tulip. Cloudy golden in appearance with a thin head that sticks around. Aroma of apple, pear light malts, no hops detected. Taste follows the nose, almost a wine quality but also with hops present. Smooth and creamy. Easy drinking all around good brew"
"As I just said, I enjoyed this beer and I was really glad to try it. NG is a brewery we can't get here in PA so I am really excited to try these beers I got in the trade. A nice start to the NG experience."
"O: I enjoyed this a lot. Very refreshing and light, but provides a lot of flavor. A good lawnmower beer for sure."
"O - a good example of the style."
"Thanks Chris! I owe you a couple for this one."
"Pours a hazy straw with a medium whitish head. The nose is slightly citrusy (lemon) and a touch of malt. Taste has a bit of lemon sweetness that tastes a touch artificial and maybe a little grassy. Pretty clean. The mouthfeel is nice medium-light body with good carbonation. Cream ale is an interesting designation. Exceedingly drinkable. This beer is available at the worst (and best) of WI bars and is kind of the macro of craft beer in the state. It's not nearly my favorite and I rarely order it, but I'll miss it when I don't live here anymore. Overall gets a nostalgia 5."
"Thanks to Garrett, my neighbor, for the sixer. "
"Drinkability: It is a nice, light (and not in the derogatory sense) beer that is easy drinking, but it does not offer much in regards to complexity. Then again, it is not supposed to."
"Thanks to schmittymack for sharing this one (over the course of what seemed like at least an hour) at his first tasting :) Poured a straw color with a nice white head. Aromas of straw, yeast and light malt. On the palate, this one was light bodied, with flavors of yeast, straw and light malt. At least the chair was comfortable."
"Meh. I can see why this beer sells so well - it drinks like an adjunct lager. It's inoffensive, refreshing enough, and just doesn't have much flavor. Not much malt, not much hops, not much of anything else. I found myself chasing the flavor, taking more sips cause I wanted more out of it, but still disappointed by each one. Works all right for cooling off on a hot summer day, but there are so many other beers that would do the same job with more pleasure."
"D: I could and would drink several of these"
"I, for the life of me, do not understand why this beer is as popular as it is. Other than the Snowshoe, New Glarus beers just do not stack up to others that are available around here."
"O: this is a pretty decent and easily sessionable brew, providing you can get your hands on some. Because it's refreshing and tasty, this would be good anytime."
"D: A little tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, decent beer to pound down several of over a long period of time."
"When I read that this was found everywhere in Wisconsin, I was impressed that the people there were seemingly drinking tons of craft beer but the fact is that this isn't really anything most craft beer nuts would seek out too actively if they had other options. Despite that, it's very enjoyable and a great quaffer. It's still much better than macros and fits the bill when you want something that isn't too complex or heavy."
"O) I really enjoy this brew, but how this is New Glarus's best seller is a mystery to me. They have many offerings that I routinely purchase in favor of it."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, proof that corn can be used in a positive way in a beer. I wish there were a little more going on but it's pretty good as is. I bet lots of cheese eaters drink this an awful lot in the summer. It'd doubtless be a nice change from wheat beers in the summer. Thanks to my old pal Agro for the assist."
"M,O: Well balance and pleasing to the tongue, a summer burger beer. Very session-able as well."
"Notes: I enjoyed the beer overall. Sweet but not too strong with a nice subtle fruitiness. Pretty tasty and I could see having this stocked for summer (if I lived in Wisconsin). I wasn't blown away, but it was solid and refreshing."
"640"
"O - c'mon guys, really. Its not horrible, i just feel this was not ""hand-crafted"" at all. worse things have happened, but this beer seems pointless and empty to me, no depth or complexity or maybe its just so complex and the significant representations of what they brewed lay in the depths of darkness that my simple palate cannot dare to retrieve...i just had an AH-HA moment, or not"
"Overall: Spotted Cow is definetly not the best beer I have tried, but it is definetly worth the drink and I always do remember to pick up a 12 pack whenever I am in WI. It has a lighter feel to it and tastes really good. The redrinkability is definetly there with this one. Perfect on those hot days when one isn't enough."
"D - Super drinkable. Flavors are a bit bland, but it is lively enough and not empty. Finish is really crisp and refreshing."
"Overall this beer is a joke. Its nothing but a BMC lite with a fancier bottle. Avoid it if you can"
"Overall, I highly recommend this beer."
"Mouthfeel: Thin body with very little carbonation."
"12oz bottle, courtesy of RuchKrull (thanks Rich!). I don't know why but I expected this to be a brown ale, maybe a milk stout. I guess it's the cow name. No, this is pale golden colored, hazy, with a wet looking layer of foam. It smells mainly of malts, grainy and not too far from a lager aroma. Biscuit and toast in the flavor, a little sweet, no bitterness, very approachable flavor. Approachable but maybe a tad dull. Gentle mouthfeel, creamy, goes down easily. This would be a great summer beer on the deck."
"The CPJ"
"D: I dont think ill go back to it, but if others are enjoying then by all means."
"D - I'm more impressed with the smell than the taste; I still like this brew and I'm always impressed with New Glarus beers; they always make a quality beer"
"A cream ale. A corn laden, fizzy yellow beer with character. A north American classic. Thank you Wisconsin! Not sure what others expect when they dig into this beer. Big hops? No. Massive body? No. Bourbonbarrelfarmhousehorseblanketcohumuloneibublahblahblah? No. How bout an easy drinkin, well made, clean, unpretentious beer? Yeah, there ya go. Great stuff. Certainly has some elements of the much maligned American adjunct lager, but of course why wouldn't it? Drink with brats and cold diced potatoes mixed with mayo, yellow mustard and onions. Hell, drink it with Sunday breakfast and then with lunch. Drink it in a movie theater, its fun. A great beer all around and one that I would never turn down. Skol!"
"Overall, a decent brew. I'm glad to have tried it. I'd drink it again. This is the perfect any-time beer. Oddly, I think I liked the Genesee Cream Ale better... maybe it was the can..."
"O: It was fine, nothing spectacular, but I could knock a few of these back on a hot day, no problem. A good alternative to BMC drinkers I would think."
"If you see it, TRY IT!"
"O - This is classified as a cream ale and I really don't see how this even comes close to resembling one. Confusing. If anything, this seems to be closer to a farmhouse or even some variation of lager."
"Frankly not much depth but the taste is clean and good and it is extremly drinkable."
"Overall: It is good. Worth a try, I feel like I say that about 90% of the beers I drink. Nothing out of this world but I am glad I had the chance to try a New Glarus offering. Much better than any macro, however it does remind me of an adjunct lager, which I guess is expected given the description of the style."
"Overall this isn't a bad beer but there is nothing about it that stands out."
"D - This seems to be made for an extremely hot summer day and a forced mowing of the lawn. This is a beer where you grab 3 or 4, find some shady place and relax for the afternoon. Very light and crisp. A bit ""over-fruity"" for my tastes, but I think if it hits the mid 90's I could finish a 6 pack in about 15 minutes. Even at only 5.1%, that might hurt eventually, but these would go down fast nonetheless."
"D) An alright brew. I could see downing a few of these on a hot summer day. A good transition beer for macro to micro converts."
"This is a fantastic beer. Its the beer I drank before I got into beer. Yes its a great cream ale. Yes its craft beer. But, you have to realize that in WI this has become as common as miller light, so I argue one should review it as a BMC beer. I give it straight 5's for taking a strong bite out of the BMC hold here in WI, and would give it nearly as high of a rating even if it wasn't."
"Creamy taste. Given the corn used in the recipie and the cream ale style it might not be for everyone but I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Pours a yellow color with a white head that goes away pretty quick. Smell has some sweetness, grainy? And a touch of fruitiness. Taste is sweet and smooth, pretty drinkable. But once it started to warm up....Changed for the worse. I guess it is a Cream Ale."
"D- Low alcohol, nice feel to it. A nice upgrade from an average adjunct... Price might hold it back though."
"Notes: fantastic light-bodied brew that actually has great flavor. just enough adjunct to make it fun, otherwise a pure expression of sweet, pale malts. perfect for a hot day and close enough to sessionable for any activity. wish we got this in Michigan. we need a beer like this"
" Enjoyable and really easy to drink. I believe this is New Glarus's signature brew."
"Drinkability: Really sort of negatively surprised on this one. It has a nice creamy mouthfeel, but the aroma and taste are just not up to snuff. I can drink this, but it's not that good. Until I drank it, I can honestly say I did not know anything about this style, but I won't be going after it again."
"Just had this smuggled in from Wisco and love it. Now, I get it . Their other beers are more unique and will get more accolades but this beer is fantastic. Sorry Oberon , can't touch this. This is so well balanced and yes, so funny to think that corn might add something unique but it might. Once banned from micros this adjunct imparts something unique. I wish one of the Michigan Micros would make something like this."
"This beer poured a golden slighty hazy color, with a small lacing head. They wasnt a strong smell, but it had sweet aromas. The was unquie. There was first a stong cream taste, similar to a cream soda, and it was followed by just a bit of a hoppy taste, but left a sweetness on the palatee. Nicely carbonated as well, and very easy to have a few. Overall not my cup of tea, but a very interesting flavor did make it enjoyable, and unquie, deffently worth a try."
"Overall - In all honesty...this was my second tasting. The first time was a little less memorable. The second time was the charm. Perhaps incorporating the yeast added enough to the flavor to make a difference. This seems a great version of this style. I once homebrewed an HB competition award winning cream ale that matches well with this beer. Glad I live at the WI border as I have a 30 minute drive to stock up on NG products. This will hit my regular rotation as a highly drinkable, light, crisp beer. A great crossover drink for BMC drinkers."
"D - This is a little step up from the Totally Naked I tried...not sure if I've ever had a cream ale but aspects of this beer reminded me of drinking a saison...good enough for one or two but that's enough"
"There's nothing wrong with this beer but nothing outstanding either. It pours with a thin head and a yellow color. Not much smell to speak of. It's a very mellow beer, pretty smooth. Nothing noticeable in the taste. No hops to speak of, some malts I suppose, but very muted. Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is high. You could have several. A good inoffensive session beer."
"Way, way better than I remembered and expected."
"It was OK, but I wouldn't call it a great beer by any stretch. It was refreshing, but I finished it unsatisfied. It drank more like a lager than an ale."
"Cheers!"
"Well done New Glarus, a fine brew to enjoy with friends."
"For what it's worth, one of the best cream ale I've had. That said I'm not a cream ale fan."
"I highly recommend this beer to everyone."
"Drinkability is also decent. Kind of a boring tasting beer, but it is easy to drink and pretty refreshing."
"d not nearly as good as i remembered it. the pizza atmosphere helped when on tap, but clearly this bottled specimen is inferior. in a head to head with schlitz gusto, spotted cow got badly milked."
"Beer is light in body and in flavor. There is a minimal sweetness at the lead off and it caves in to reveal....nothing. There is not a lot of anything going on in this beer. Interesting. The finish is bland and easy. Its like drinking sweetened water."
"This brew is a relly good session ale. It goes down smooth and is really tasty."
"D: Great summer beer and session beer. Not the best offering at New Glarus, but I have started many new beer drinkers with this solid brew."
"I've had Spotted Cow maybe 9 times in the course of 4 years. Every time I have one, for at least a week after that I am craving another one. I don't know what it is about the beer. It has a very cloudy orangish color, and it goes down very smooth, and it's flavor is excellent. Very crisp. I would recommend this beer to anyone. It's one of my favorites."
"There is a pale malt taste upfront with just a bit of grain. Nothing too bold upfront, but it picks up quickly with a pleasantly sweet corn characteristic that seems to compliment the style. Though it starts slow, its a pretty enjoyable experience overall. Spotted Cow also finishes cleanly which makes it a very drinkable ale. I would definitely pick this up from time to time if it was available."
"Not much head when poured out of bottle, color is nothing special. Very drinkable and smooth, especially for a non-light beer. For anyone wanting to get into craft/micro-brews this is the beer for you."
"Mouthfeel is light but flat. Not a great beer, not a bad beer."
"This is much more drinkable! The amount of flavor just changes the whole experience. This would go down very easily time after time, though I don't think I'd grab it instead of New Glarus' own Back 40 or Stone Soup if they were available."
"D- easy to finish this one, and at a strength that most consider sessionable. this is a nice alternative to the big three."
"Overall this beer rates as a beer worth trying but not worth buying."
"O: I really expected more from this offering considering the execution of Wisconsin Belgian Red, and Raspberry Tart. The market share this beer holds in Wisconsin is surprising."
"""The Cow"" is semi-cloudy with a gentle carbonation. The head is frothy white and seems to disappear quickly. It is pleasantly sweet with a fruity smell. Crisp and light on the palate. This beer goes down quickly and and will surely be a party favorite."
"This beer pours a honey golden and slightly cloudy. The aroma is of tart fruit and green apple. It tastes fruity, slightly sweet, round and soft on the mouth, with a hint of grain in the back. It tastes like a golden honey ale although this has no honey."
"Drinkability - I can put back a six pack of these like it was nothing. Totally a summer beer or beer to pair with BBQ foods during summer or pizza. Glad I was able to try this and can't wait to have some this summer when I'm back in the hot, humid, Midwest!"
"Pours yellow with a slight white head. The nose is pretty plain with some really light malt and some slight fruits. Very mild hops. The taste is just a tad bit of lightly-sweetened malt and really not much else. Body is light and somewhat creamy with good carbonation. Drinks quite well and I can see how it sells so much."
"D: I can't remember the last beer I was this indifferent to. Very plain with an appropriate mouthfeel but there's nothing exciting or out of the ordinary about this one. Just a peg above the macros. Nothing to complain about but there's no real reason to come back to this one."
"Thanks to Bill for sharing this bottle."
"Highly drinkable. This isn't by any means an amazing beer, but it does what it sets out to and matches up well against other cream ales. This is your quintessential lawnmower beer, a good choice for a hot day when you might otherwise consider resorting to BMC."
"Pours a hazed orange yellow with a thick white head and great lacing. Smells of oranges, vanilla, yeast bread, biscuit and grain. Tastes of orange, corn, yeast bread, and very dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is just right for this beer. Drinkability is quite good. Almost sessionable. Great beer."
"Not much of a head. But I definitely want more of this beer!"
"Went over to 'Sconnie for a beer run and came back with this. Pours a nice cloudy straw color. Not much of a smell - light malty character. This tastes too close to mass produced beers - mostly malty flavor with a bit of corn bite and light hops. If I want craft, I want something more intense. This would be a good craft to throw at a mass beer drinker to get them into craft. I'd much rather have this than a Bud or something - so don't get me wrong - it's not bad just nothing really exciting. Maybe it's just the nature of Cream Ales but this just is lacking much in terms of depth. It does have a nice creamy body that I though was the best part of the beer."
"M & D - Crisp and clean flavors. Overall very drinkable and good offering."
"Pours a hazy gold with a finger of white head.  Smells are slight yeast, maybe some fruit and some apple.  Tastes are yeasty goodness at the front, followed by some fruit.  Drinkability is very high, mouthfeel is kinda thin, but still either the best or one of the best cream ales I've had."
"Because Cream Ales are supposed to have a corn-like character, this beer fares reasonably well. But it's one of those mystery beers that have a cult following by swill drinkers who think they have the best beer in the world."
"Taste, unique as well, went from mild and easy to drink to having a recognizable presence of lemon and bitterness that migrated into minimal sweetness. At no time does it get challenging to drink but is appreciable for what it is. A suitable entry level beer."
"Drinkability: The beer feels pretty ""light"" and not too flavor intensive. Though I may not want to spend more money for one, they still go down easy."
"D- This beer is definitely designed to be consumed in large quantities, which is a good thing, its not too filling and the taste stays crisp."
"D- Very drinkable. Light body, low ABV and pretty good flavors makes this one an easy quaffer. It would seem to make a good summer beer. Thanks again for this one Jim!"
"Overall this beer is pretty good and I have to give it a noms up."
"D: Goes down easily, slightly taste, not much of a kick, ok representation of style. I'd opt for others of the style."
"D: low-part of the high end"
"4.0 D: I was expecting this to be a tedious 12 oz, but it's been nothing of the sort. Is it simple? Yes. Is it flavorful? Not really. Is it well crafted, easy going down, and flavorful enough? Definitely."
"When in northern Wisconsin, drink as the locals do. Enter: New Glarus. This offering pours a clear pale straw topped by about a half-finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises green apple, peach, mandarin orange, corn, and a slight yeasty character. The taste holds notes of red apple, orange zest, lemonade, hard water, and corn syrup. Honestly, I didn't see so much fruit being involved here. The body is light, with an active carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a nice li'l brew, nothing all too special, but definitely a highly drinkable bit o' Wisconsin-y goodness."
"This brew pours a nice light golden color with a little head, but not much at all. The smell is a bit corn syrupy, but after that is through there is a nice orange zest with the malts as well as what we best described as an apricot aroma to finish off the nose. The taste is much richer than the color would let you on to believe. There is no bitterness and the beer is epically smooth. A rather solid and highly drinkable beer to enjoy in Wisconsin."
"D: A drinkable, simple, and one dimensional beer--yet it's quite drinkable and would be a nice go to session ale if it were available here."
"M/D: Simple, soft, smooth...easy to drink. This would be a good beer to bring just about anywhere, and wouldn't offend the masses. I felt this description was short, but it is just an easy-going beer..."
"very drinkable."
"Spotted Cow pours a light gold with a nice head. The aroma is slightly grainy and malty with a night light fruitiness. The flavor is crisp with some light malt and just a hint of sweetness before a dry finish. The bitterness is very light, and there is really no hop flavor. The finish is fairly clean with just a bit of lingering fruitiness."
"Pours a super cloudy straw color with a mild head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells like peaches, apricot, oranges, ect. Very pleasing aroma. Taste adds a spicy yeast character and some bready malt. Solid carbonation gives it a crisp refreshing feel. While it may not be incredibly complex, it is a very drinkable, very tasty beer that I will definitely have again the next time i find myself in Wisconsin."
"Could definitely sit down to a 6er of this without hesitation."
"D: The sweet corn taste and super smooth finish make this pretty easy to drink, but I can't see myself having more than one or two. Would be a nice thirst quencher for lots of different meals, especially salty snacks."
"D: Like I mentioned before not a very complicated beer, but perfect for when an easy drinking beer is desired. A great session beer as well."
"I approached this beer with an open mind, knowing this is more or less their mass market breadwinner; Yuengling Lager seems like a decent reference point for my expectations (though obviously not the same style). Pours a clear, pale golden color, thick with smoky swirls of sediment and a generous fluffy bone white head. As the head fades it leaves very little lacing and settles as a thin ring with light webs of lacing. Aroma is very mild and non-descript. Mild sweetness and grain dominate what little presence the nose has; really this smells like any other non-offensive macro lager. Flavor is an interesting sweet and mildly fruity take on a typical lager. Sweet grains and malt dominate with a smooth, dry finish with non-existent hops or bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium full, creamy and thick in the finish with mild carbonation. Overall this beer is remarkably unremarkable, other than the intense creamy finish."
"D: Very drinkable. Pleasant all around, and very repeatable. While it may not be the most interesting beer, it is certainly well done."
"to start off the smell is pretty good.The taste is like of marshmallow with a creamy texture. Goes down real smooth. My first time having this was a cheese shop in Milwaukee. Very impress with this brewery. I wish they branch out to the East Coast So people Like me can buy it. Its a real good beer really nothing else I can say."
"The beer doesn't really reside in your mouth at all, goes down fairly easily and is quite refreshing."
"D: The subtle flavors and easy drinking aspects to this ale scores high in this category."
"Poured into a beer glass and it quite a light cloudy beer, but with too much floaty stuff. Aromas are dominated by sweetness and apple with a bit of corn. The body is dominated by the fruity esters. Exceedingly enjoyable. A great brew on a hot day..."
"I found that this beer drank very similar to a wheat beer. It was a rich gold color with no real head and some small prickle bubbles. The nose was grain and a touch fruity like a wheat beer. The attack was a little maltier and the malt was definitely ""out front."" There were some hints of banana and clove in the flavor. The finish was pretty dry. It was decent beer, but there is just so much beer out there to try."
"D: A good macro lager substitute, and that's it. I'd have it again but I wouldn't trade for it."
"D-A total session beer, no doubt. An unassuming leave combined with a fairly light body and a light hint of alcohol. This is basicalyl The Beer you want to serve at your next barbecue...or the beer you want to introduce your Miller Lite friends into craft brew with."
"One of my favorites, this is a real quencher on hot summer days. Like others, I get the corn thing and the bread thing, and I guess I detect a hint of grassiness. To me, the overall appeal of this brew is that it's smooth and refreshing. It's not complex and it doesn't need to be."
"Pours a hazy yellowish goldish color with a one finger head that is frothy and gives way to a little bit of lacing. The aroma is of grains, corn, and a little wheat. The taste is of a grainy malt backbone with slight hints of citrus and a small hop bite at the end. The mouthfeel is low to moderate carbonation and is slightly creamy. The drinkablitity is good, it is very smooth and a very easy drink. It is so easy to take down, there isn't a lot to keep you interested but for the style it is good."
"Pretty drinkable, but not something I would reach for again. Everything is just average..."
"Drinkability: Seems like an Adjunct Lager but more creamy than crisp. Easy to drink, but nothing overly special."
"Don't let the label fool you into thinking of this beer as a farmhouse ale, as in the Belgian sense. It is perhaps most closely related to a cream ale, as BA suggests, and I'll suggest that it could be the best one out there."
"Drinkability -- For good or worse, it's easy to see why they sell so much of this stuff! Ho-hum flavor, but its so easy to drink this all day long."
"D-This is a pretty decent beer, and miles better than Totally Naked, but it's ultimately one of New Glarus's weaker offerings. It's really easy drinking and I understand why they make it... it sells really well and allows them to make their better beers."
"I received this with 4-5 New Glarus beers and I have to say this was toward the bottom of the pack. Not a bad beer by any means, just don't judge NG by this one alone."
"Overall an easy drinker and good for the style."
"D - This is a good beer, but it cannot achieve a high rating due to its intended banality. There is plenty average-good about it, but nothing to consider excellent."
"Notes: This beer is light and crisp and the drinkability is high. It's nothing too special though, just a nice drinking beer, maybe best on a hot afternoon."
"It was lager thin and did go down easily enough after an evening of yardwork. I can see having 1 or 2 of these and then switching to something else. New Glarus has better offerings than this."
"Body is medium for the style, carbonation perhaps a bit low. It's clean, without any noticeable flaws, and if it was hot (and it is) I could (and did) finish the bottle with little effort. I'll have it again, but don't have any desire to do so right now."
"Drinkability is fantastic, deffinitely sessionable."
"Fairly crisp, soft, and smooth. This is a good summer beer, easy to drink and enjoy. Nothing extreme or over the top about it. Just a nice easy-drinking ale that feels and tastes a bit more like a lager."
"D: Ugh. I've tried this beer over and over again. For some reason people in Chicago love this beer and I don't know why. It's as if it is a craft version of an Adjunct Lager. It's sticky when it should be refreshing. It's sweet with nothing to support the sweetness. Maybe for macro beer people, this beer offers something a typical macro doesn't. What that is, I don't know. But for such a light bodied, light flavored beer, I can't believe how difficult this beer is to drink."
"overall i'd say its not the best NG beer however, its nice to have over a macro brew when at the bar. and since its a lighter micro brew its a good first beer for those looking at other alternatives to macros."
"The body was typical for the style, perhaps a touch on the thin side. Drinkability was pretty good, I could see having this as regular ""lawnmower"" beer. Overall, a decent brew that's worth a shot if you can get it."
"The flavor has a nice malty twang to it. Its carried by a smooth mouthfeel but is light in body. A good example of a cream ale. I would drink it again, just not too often as it is a beer style that lacks flavor."
"Cheers!"
"D - Pretty easy drinker, not unpleasant and could do a couple of these."
"D: overall a well made cream ale. It is free of defect, quite refreshing, and overall a pleasant experience. Spotted Cow is nothing to write home about, but certainly worth giving a chance."
"Aromas of toasted grain, hay, and a touch of grass. Sweet and grain-like on the palate, with light toasted malt and a hint of coconut. Nice and simple. Light to medium in body, yet malty and full-ish. Nothing amazing, but pretty good for what it is."
"Drinkability: Great tasting, not too powerful. Satisfying and refreshing. Mild but still delicious and complex enough. A very solid beer"
"D: Drinkability is very good in this one. Very refreshing and flavorful. This is a well balanced beer!"
"Drinkability is great--light and refreshing with good flavor."
"Nice beer."
"A very refreshing offering from New Glarus. Extremely drinkable."
"D: An approachable beer that would be a great gateway brew."
"D - A simple yet refreshing beer. An easy drinking beer that is what most of the American style lagers should be."
"Bottle from jprime. Nice floral aroma (lavender), yeast, banana and lemon peel. Nice sharp hoppy bitterness, citrus and slightly malty finish, a little shy. Full and creamy palate for the style. Very enjoyable starter. This is one hell of an extra, way above my expectations."
"Pour produces a creamy, white head. Thin lacing. Color is cloudy orange. Some sediment noticeable. Few carbonation bubbling throughout. Aroma contains notes of sweet honey, and very mild citris in the trailing nose. Flavor of the contains a sweet center. Wheat malts make up a biscuity first flavor, while the mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Citric orange peel and lemon zest come into play towards the finish and linger on the palate into the aftertaste. A hit of carbonation makes it's way into the finish as well. Overall, a very drinkable beer and flavorful with the citris dancing on the palate and the adding of the honey makeup. Would definitely buy this in multiple 6 packs if it was around Massachusetts."
" I can't however say it's a great representation if the style due to the fruitiness, but who cares. If someone wanted to really get a feel for the cream ale style I'd suggest they go elsewhere, but if someone wanted a light easy drinking refreshing beer I'd gladly recommend this one."
"D= 3.5 Ok session beer. I didn't particularly like this beer but then again I do not like the style. You could drink a lot of this beer and the abv is pretty low as well"
"d-very high with this one. I would enjoy this beer for my drinkable get drunk beer"
"During the week I usually only drink one beer per night. This was the beer I cracked... took two sips maybe three and realize it was not worthy of being the one. Cracked open a Sinebrechoff Porter which was excellent and all is right in the world."
"Growing up in Wisconsin I know first hand how popular this beer is among almost every resident of the state. This is the best designed gateway beer from BMC to craft that I have ever tasted. I have never met anyone who didn't like it and for this reason it can be found in pretty much every bar in WI, even the most grungiest of biker bars. This beer is practically a state symbol, and even though it isn't the most exciting of the NG offerings, I applaud it's ability to open up the palettes of Miller Lite swilling residents of Wisconsin one pint at a time."
"I've heard people rave about this beer, i'm not sure why it's pretty middle of the road."
"Spotted Cow is the first New Glarus beer I've had. My friend swears by New Glarus so I look forward to trying more of their beers in the future. The Spotted Cow pours like a fairly average beer. It is gold in color, and has a creamy head. This beer doesn't have a strong taste, which makes it very easy to drink. You could probably drink this beer all day. Spotted Cow is one of New Glarus' most popular beers (if not the most) so it is a good place to start."
"The palate is rather simple, opening with a little sweetness and little else. I'm really having a hard time picking out flavors here, there really isn't much. While not offensive (like I find BMC to be), there's nothing particularly interesting - no delicate nuance, no hop character (bitterness is low, as is flavor) and all-round, just a little boring. Drying and a little watery on the finish with a light, grainy bitterness, this is OK. Light in body with a crisp carbonation, this is rather refreshing, but not really something I'd seek out a lot of."
"Notes: At first, I considered Spotted Cow to be inferior to New Glarus's amazing line-up of light wheat beers (Dancing Man, Crack'd Wheat, and I'd also put Stone Soup in this category). However, this beer grows on me the more times I drink it. It's kind of an anomoly among beers in that it's taste is it's weakest characteristic. On the other hand, the mouthfeel and drinkability are suberb! You can't ask for much more from a brewery's flagship beer. I still see it as inferior to the likes of Dancing Man and Crack'd Wheat, but only slightly, which mainly attests to how excellent those seasonal beers are. Spotted Cow may be the weakest of the New Glarus line-up, but I still love it! I guess that means New Glarus is a great brewery!"
"D: Well this is a very unique flagship beer, it has an interesting flavor profile that isn't the most enjoyable but is somewhat refreshing, the mouthfeel of this beer redeems some of its lesser qualities"
"Na Zdravje!"
"D. The taste was ok but it reminderd me more of a heffe, than a cream ale. I would try this brew again on a warm sunny summer day as I think it would be a good quenching brew."
"D - Decent beer for the style, but not very exciting. I think it's clear why this beer is so popular. If you're used to drinking BMC, Spotted Cow must seem like the nectar of the gods. I can't really see a good reason to add it to my list of regulars, though."
"Mostly clean, clear, golden straw body. Tight, pinkie finger of cotton white head. Good lacing. Nose of sweet cereal malts, honey, bits of fruit (apple), and some spicy, peppery hops. Soft, clean, bread malt flavors up front. Doughy. Touches of grain and honey sweetness arise (and a bit of apple, again). Slightly metallic, mildly spicy hop bitterness picks up near the finish. Cooked veggies in an otherwise clean finish. Moderate body with perfect carbonation levels. Very easy drinking!"
"Notes: I really wanted to like this beer. I love the whole ""Spotted Cow"" image and it being from Wisconsin and all but this beer was boring."
"M/D - slightly carbonated, light, crisp feeling, nothing too outstanding, just a nice crisp beer"
"Very easy to drink and very good as well. New Glarus knows their stuff and I will be back for more."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It pours golden yellow with some carbonation and a bit of lacing. It has a very fresh fruit smell. It's sweet with just a hint of grain. Nice! Not much here in the way of taste. It has a bit of grain flavor up front. It's just sort of bland. I've always thought of Spotted Cow as the microbrew for people who only drink Miller Lite. It's a gateway micro I guess, which isn't a bad thing. This is a light beer. It has a little bit of tingle across the tongue when ingested. It has a high drinkability. It's totally a beer to kick back with when you don't want to get bloated."
"Light bodied with high carbonation. Very easy drinking beer."
"In my opinion, this beer is the only excusable reason to venture up to Wisconsin. Creamy, sweet, and malty, smooth and well-balanced, the spotted cow is the crown jewel of New Glarus' catalogue (though I do like Stone Soup too). I just with this were more readily available in the Chicagoland area."
"This beer is every place in Wisco. Everyone except me seems to like this beer. I don't get it. To me there just isn't anything I like about how this beer tastes. I'd rather have a Bud. Looks like a macro smells like one too. Taste to me is just off somehow, grainy. Feel is carbonated and to me is a little harsh. Not drinkable to me I do have one every now and then just to make sure I still don't care for this beer. Have had on tap also."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a small white head. Aroma is malty sweetness with a little citrus and floral mixed in. The beer has a malty flavor with a slight corn flavor. There is also some hop flavor. This is a very tasty beer with a creamy mouthfeel that is easy to drink. Recommended."
"Pours, from the bottle, a slightly hazy golden color into the pint glass. The head is white and foamy to abut an inch in height. I does not stick around long, even though carbonation bubbles continual rise from the bottom. The smell is faintly fruity, though not at all convincing that there is any thing there for the palate to await in anticipation. The taste is like the smell, average at best. Being a HUGE fan of some of the New Glarus offerings, I was more than a bit disappointed in this beverage. Not an awful beer by anymeans, but not a brew I would go in search of."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is quite high, I could have a few of these. Overall, it is what it is with this brew. This is a good example of a cream ale, the style just doesn't lend it's self to a complex flavor profile. I won't go out of my way to get this beer, but I won't pass it up either. Skal."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the high carbonation along with the high attenuation gives this one that ""thirst quenching"" quality. Certainly drinkable, if not the most enjoyable beer out there."
"M/D - A decent brew but not too overpowering except for the malty aftertaste, Pretty light on the tongue. I could indulge myself with more than 1 at a sitting. The brew didn't blow me away but enough to have me come back for more"
"Very easy to drink, low abv. Easily sessionable, however I am not a huge fan of the flavor profile."
"Drinkability: this beer is very easy to quaff and has a decent flavor profile. For the style, this one hits the spot."
"12oz. bottle courtesy of jrallen34. Served in my SA Sensory Pint. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half inch, loose, bright white head that eventually settles into broken skim with some swaths of lacing. Nose is virtually non-existent - pretty much adjuncts here. Very light taste - a little fruity, some cereal grains; pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with a pleasant and consistent background carbonation; finish is fairly clean. This is a really drinkable beer - simple flavor profile that is light and sessionable without being dominated by the taste of corn. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Definitely a good gateway beer for macro drinkers."
"Decent enough beer, & one to look for in dark places far in the north woods of Wisconsin when the banjos start playing."
"Can drink this all day, but it is uninteresting. Its lightness is its strength, but also its weakness."
"This is a great no frills kind of beer. An easy to drink session with lots of flavor. Something I always enjoy when I get a chance to have it, and something I would recommend."
"I'll give it this -- Spotted Cow is drinkable. I can imagine it as a great lawnmower beer. The watery profile and light body help it go down easy, and the mild carbonation makes it feel pretty smooth. If the brewery set out to make an easy going beer with broad appeal I believe it hit the mark with this beer."
"Poured a cloudy, golden color. A few shades darker than miller lite. Big, bubbly white head, a lot of carbonation. Not overly impressive. Smell is somewhat citrus with earthy, yeasty undertones. I've had a quite a few of theese from the bottle, this is the first one on tap. Not much differance. People go ape shit for this stuff around here. I'm not sure why. The taste up front is the same as the smell. Fruity citrus and pear with the yeasty finish. Mouthfeel is very watery and unsatisfying. I find myself waiting for a nice bitter finish to pull this beer together that never comes. Overall this ok drinkable beer. Why people love it so much I don't know. O-VER-RA-TED!"
"Spotted Cow poured a cloudy gold/pale amber with a nice 2 finger sized white head and good lacing. Smell was faint of yeast. Taste was slightly sweet with hints of citrus. Mouthfell was ok, a little thin. Drinkability was very good, easy drinking. Session beer for sure. Overall this is an easy drinking ale, not overly complex, but offers some good flavors. Would buy again."
"Mouthfeel has nice carbonation and perceptibly good water quality but the ""middle of the road""-ness of this beer's flavor sort of drops the drinkability of it. It could be PBR or it could be a unique farmhouse ale. I have no idea."
"Damn good drinkability actually, pleasantly surprised. Good for drinking a few rounds. Nothing spectacular, but I would try it again."
"D - this was a decent brew. It was easy to drink, however it never really held my attention. I liked some of their other offerings better than this so I don't know if I would go out of my way to get this..."
"Drinkability is exceptional - I put away 12 oz like it was 6, and could have easily drank this all night. Easily this beer's high point."
"D: Well, it would be a great compromise for a BMCer and a Crafter, that's about all I can say."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, could have another one but think I will go for something else"
"(D)- A very light and easy drinking beer. Simple and straightforward, but a good crisp session beer."
"D- Pretty easy to drink, would make a great session beer. Nothing really that flipped my switch but I'm glad I tried it."
"Out of all the NG Products this would have to be the most popular. Seem to sell it everywhere I go in Wi. Overall pretty solid but no incentive to really buy more of it. I would like to see more flavor."
"I tend to stay away from this beer. I'm just not a fan of the flavor. I haven't had one in years. So for the sake of good record keeping and the fact that we tailgated the and now I have a shit load of these in the fridge. Here we go. Poured into a pint glass the beer is pale cloudy yellow. A modest creamy white head billows out of my glass like whip cream. No laciing left after the head settles. The aroma is sweet grain. Hints of fruit. It has a dust like tone that I'm not sure about. The flavor is slightly fruity with malt and a sort of earthy finish. Medium to light body with plenty of carbonation. Overall this didn't sway my opinion. To this day this is the only NG product I simply don't enjoy. One out of thirty isn't too bad."
"Drink: Probably would make for a great session beer. Could be argued that this could be drank all night perhaps."
"Very drinkable and straight forward, the type of beer you could enjoy for a long time with friends. Great job New Glarus! Cheers!"
"Notes: Was able to get this bottle through a friend of a friend who got it from some other friends who live in Wisconsin. Pretty standard cream ale. I could see drinking a couple of these on a hot summer day to quench the thirst."
"Well carbonated in the mouthfeel. This too is a tasty brew - very drinkable."
"D- It is a good beer with a high drinkability because many part time beer drinkers express the greatness of this one. I've had this one in a bottle and on-tap at The Brat Stop and The Burlington in (Logan Squre) Chicago."
"D: very drinkable and the low ABV makes it a good session beer. this is a good go to beer when the only place to get beer is at a gas station. the beats BMC any day."
"Light but refreshing for the most part, this was a decent Cream Ale. I was glad that I was actually able to pick a bit of corn out in this (especially in the aroma) as I really enjoy the flavors it puts off when mixed with the maltier components of these."
"I have let all my friends try this beer and not one has said one bad thing about it! Cheers New Glarus Brewery for this wonderful beer!"
"Been interested in this one for a while now and finally got the chance to try some when someone brought some down for me. From the bottle into a pint glass it pours a pale hazy yellow color with no head at all (if any head does appear on the pour it quickly dissolves to nothing). Leaves really no lacing on the glass at all. Smell is decent. Smells sweet and a bit fruity, nothing stands out to me. Taste on this one is good. It might not be complex or bursting with flavors but it's still quite good. It's sweet like the smell and a hint of fruityness lingers. It's quite refreshing actually. If this one were available in my area I would drink it more often. A low ABV and refreshing this is one I wouldn't mind drinking all night. This is only the second cream ale I've ever had the other was a couple years ago before I was more knowledgeable so I would like to try some others to see how they compare, but as of right now I'd recommend this one to at least try."
"12oz bottle, poured hazy golden-yellow. A creamy white head topped the ale and dissipated relatively quickly leaving minimal lacing on the glass. A certain freshness fills the nose with bready yeast, hints of grass, slight sweet malts, fruit and lemon.  Tastes were refreshing and fruity - apple and pear notes, wheaty, lemon pith, corn, cereal, yeast, and a bit of white pepper on the finish. Mouth-feel is super creamy and smooth with a light-to-medium body, and pleasant carbonation. Overall, very refreshing and sessionable ale. One of the best cream ales you can buy - if in Wisconsin."
"Pours a lightly hazed golden yellow, thin white head forms and immediately fizzes away to nothing, no ring, no lace, nothing, doesn't look good in that respect. Smell is alright, lightly malty, some corn syrup and caramel, toast, a bit bready, touch of fruit and floral, not much going on. Taste is similar, bit of malt sweetness up front, corn syrup, caramel, very clean, some floral, nice biscuit, light fruits in the finish, but very plain. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Doesn't look very good, smells okay and tastes okay, but really lacks in almost very area. Drinkability is alright but still not too exciting."
"All-in-all, this is a very drinkable beer. Light and refreshing, this is one to go for on a hot summer day around the grill."
"Mouthfeel is pour but you can crush this all night all summer long"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with a good bite of carbonation."
"Somewhat clear, but just a little haze. Not much of a head after the pour, and no foam or film. Powdered creamer, pale malts, a little toast, and some really wet grass in the nose. More wet grass in the taste with some dank non-dairy creamer taste mixed with pilsner malt. Watery palate with some herbal hops, but overall sessionably sweet malt. Very drinkable, but ten times better on tap and fresh."
"A decent wheat beer or ""cream ale", and they go down easy. Tastes like a slightly watered down Hefe-Weizen. Not bad for the style."
"D: This is very easy to drink. Low alcohol content so you could enjoy more than one easily. Flavors aren't over the top. Nothing harsh about this one. It drinks easy and tastes good."
"pours a hazy straw yellow color with a cloud like head that dissipates to an ok ring the smell is grass and hay corn and malt..the taste is the same its creamy and grassy lemon malty a little spice and hop all faint though..this is their signature beer but i can think of others from NG that should replace this one again in earlier reviews ive stated NG is an outstanding brewery with many fine representations of styles.. this one is not recommended"
"This one's significantly better on tap than in a bottle, and if you're in just about any bar or restaurant in Wisconsin, they'll have it on tap. Very cloudy, close-to-opaque medium amber that looks a lot like a wheat beer. Grainy flavor with just a bit of hoppiness to it. It's quite heavy and not a beer I'd want to spend a whole evening with. That said, if the choice is between this and an MGD (which it often is in the Madison area), this is the one to get in a heartbeat. Not one of New Glarus's finest, but a decent standby."
"Ah, the true pride of Wisconsin. Poured this straw colored cloudy beer into my pint glass with a bit of fluffy head. There was not much to the nose, mostly Meyer lemon if anything. This beer is the king of subtlety. You can taste that belgiumy/ wiess bier bananna and yeast. There is some subtle spiciness. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. I could probably drink 40 or 50 of these things. This is not a beer that will slam you taste buds with a one two punch, but for a pleasing warm weather sipper that your mom will like, you can't go wrong."
"D: It's quite light and easy drinking, but I've always found that the taste has worn on me after a couple."
"Pours hazy straw yellow with fluffy white head and soapy lacing. Nose- sweet corn, slightly grassy. Taste- creamy malt, some corn, lemon and hay. Crisp carbonation and medium bodied, finishes with a touch of hops. Very drinkable. Not a complex beer but hits the spot on a hot day. Only complain is a little too sweet for my tastes."
"Not bad but when I visit wisconsin I'm looking for a diffrent NG brew."
"Pours a hazy, pale yellow color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, sweet malt, and banana. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of wheat/corn, sweet malt, toffee, slight yeast cleanliness, and some banana. Overall, a smooth, good blend, and easy drinkability. I did not get a great deal of cream flavor, but the addition of corn is not off-putting by any means."
"D-great session. really really tasty. I could drink this all night."
"D. Drinkable. Fairly bland. I could put down a couple on a hot day."
"D: Definitely an easy drinker. More flavor would help things along, but one could do much worse than Spotted Cow if choosing a hot-weather session ale."
"Nice medium yellow color when poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Nice thick head. It' very light beer. Not getting much aroma. Nicely carbonated and you can feel it bursting on the tongue. Has a nice smoothness to it as well, which may sound a little contradictory but you will understand once you try one. I am getting a bit of lemon from this. Nice for summer."
"M/D: carbonated light bodied feel with a smooth drinkable finish easily drinkable could like this one more with more flavor."
"Hazed light golden. Moderate amounts of carbonation surface throughout the body of the beer. Bubbly dirty white collar leaves sporadic amounts of lace. Aroma is sweet, grainy, and yes, I can even detect a little of that corn sweetness. Not much though. A little musty too. Decent aroma overall. Pretty even keeled flavor. Not too sweet, but it does have some grain sweetness. Body is pretty full. Medium-full I'd say. Some thirst-quenching qualities. Decent beer. But New Glarus has so much more to offer."
"Overall, this is not a very complex beer. Just doesn't seem to by my style. I won't be having any more of this. Not one of NG best offerings."
"D- Highly drinkable. Great summer or spring beer. Sessionable."
"A decent brew. Would work well with almost any food item as a generic beverage. A style that I think is overlooked a bit. Nice treat, but nothing to strive to acquire."
"Poured from bottle in to standard pint. Yellow in color champagne like carbonation dances up from base. Smells like sweet malty goodness not bad. Taste is a little on the light side of things but no complaints. Overly carbonated in the mouth almost like a sprite that has been in the hot truck allday (I know that's a bad comparison as the sprite would be flat as hell but it feels about the same on the tounge). Highly drinkable despite its poor mouthfeel. I must say far better than any BMC out there."
"While certainly not a bad beer, nothing really of note here. A good summer beer, one you'd want after working outside on a hot day and want to cool down with a beer that refreshes, but isn't too heavy."
"Overall: For the style the drinkability is okay. The flavors up front a great but fade to an unfavorable stale sour flavor. The mouthfeel is far too carbonated for me to enjoy this beer."
"Edit: I wrote this review after a very long day and an epic quest to find beer. After having a few more I don't love it as much as I did at first but still an enjoyable beer that would be very refreshing on a summer day."
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours straw colored golden with a finger of white soapy head. Smell is banana clove-like similar to a hefe but not overpowering like a lot of hefeweizens are. The taste is like a light beer should be. Like a good tasting macro beer. Medium bodied mouthfeel much thicker than I thought it would be. Extremely drinkable. If I lived in Wisconsin this would be my go to beer for all mass consuming events(golf, beer pong, etc). My first beer from New Glarus and I'm not disappointed."
"D - An excellent warm-weather brew, light and refreshing but with enough complexity and flavor to entice you in for another sip."
"Poured into a pub glass. Omg, this is an amazing beer. Ohio should invade Wisconsin just to get this beer. The smell and taste is vaguely fruity without being overpowering the way leinenkugels or Sam Adams tends to be. This might be the mostt drinkable beer I've ever had. I accidentally killed the bottle within about fifteen minutes and it was delicious. I have a friend in Wisconsin and I definitely just gave him some money to smuggle me back a case."
"A very easy mouthfell is at play with Spotted Cow as there is just the right amount of carbonation to help work the beer across the palate. Because of the mild taste of the beer, there is no aftertaste left with after drinking the offering and the beer truly does serve as a very nice session beer."
"Very drinkable and smooth."
"D--Very sessionable but I'm not sure why you would want to since this there really isn't much here."
"D - If I could get every keg of BMC replaced with this, I could die a happy man."
"D: I don't know the style that well but I like it. I could see myself knocking back a couple of these. Tastes like a fantastic brew to have on a hot summer day. A real nice, low ABV thirst quencher."
"This is a fantastic gateway beer and is quite drinkable. I don't think an experienced (or even intermediate) BA will find anything new from this beer."
"Even if you're not a fan of this style, this beer is easy to appreciate, is well done, and is ultimately an enjoyable session beer."
"Very drinkable, and on the right day, it could be very refreshing. I've just had much better beers from New Galrus. I'm a little surprised this is their flagship. I really wanted to like it. But just average to me."
"Drinkability: These are pretty light and I could easily drink a whole six-pack. Good beer for parties or tailgating because everyone likes it and it's easy to drink."
"Pours cloudy light yeloow with good white head. Smell - grainy, malty, not very strong. Taste - slight banana flavor, maltiness. It is not bad, but i find it a bit boring. Mouthfeel is much better though, it is rally smooth and creamy, very well balanced. Drinkability is good."
"Edit: After having a couple more, I've decided that I'm not as keen on this as I initially judged. It's that grainy over-sweetness. Narsty. I have thus dropped the smell and taste by half a point from my original review."
"Had this one before in a bottle and wasn't too impressed. At Applebees for a birthday party this looked like the best thing available. Pours a golden body with a small white head with okay retention and no lacing. Smells sweet with lots of cereal grain along with fruitiness. Taste is about the same as the smell, the hops add a small amount of bitterness but grain and fruitiness are still the dominant flavors. Strong carbonation that doesn't show in the appearance, almost too bubbly for me, got distracted from the taste. Pretty drinkable though, however not being a huge fan of the flavor I wouldn't drink a ton."
"There just isn't enough going on with this beer for me. Everything about it is so light and airy. It's not bad looking, but it's very light, mildly hazy. The head dissipated rather quickly. The aroma is a tad lemony and a lot of light malt. The flavor is even tamer. I don't hate it, and it's possible that this beer is quite good very fresh. It's certainly not a bad beer. I would have preferred it served a bit colder, and it's certainly not difficult to drink. There are no real off flavors. I don't know if corn is as an adjunct grain in this beer, but it has a similar bland favor to corn."
"D= Very high. Not a bad beer at all. Tastes a lot like an adjunct lager only a little sweeter and some strange creamyness. Recommended at least once or when drinking quantity."
"Maybe I was just really in the mood for a cream ale... maybe it hit the spot just right. but on the whole, I found this one really drinkable and enjoyable. Not the most complex beer in the world, and a few funky flavors, but all in all, I was pleasantly surprised. If someone wants to send me another bottle, I can see if I find another bottle as enjoyable."
"Almost no head after a few seconds. Even the ring around the glass is weak. Hazy golden body, nose is mild to boring, not much of anything coming through. First taste was mint. Weird. Heavily carbonated, full body, not a whole lot of flavors coming out, not much to really pin down here. Maybe some wheat malts?"
"Drinkability: Very high. This is a delicious, highly re-drinkable brew for almost any occasion."
"Beautiful pour, golden honey color with cloudy yeast, two fingers of foamy white head, retention and a little lacing. Smells of wonderful sweet wheat, honey, orange, and a little of the trademark banana in every wheat ale. Obviously North American yeast, hardly any Belgian nose that you typically find in wheat ales, but then again New Glarus has always been good at breaking traditions. First taste is smooth wheat and mild yeast, not quite as sweet as it smells but certainly not dry either. The citrus and honey come out after a moment, and linger just a little bit after the finish. Somewhere between light and medium body, wonderfully smooth, full and balanced flavor, and just all-round delicious. This has to be my favorite wheat ale so far."
"This is not my style of beer so maybe their are some better options out there, but I can live without this one ever again."
"D - In the summer time I would have no problem drinking a few of these. This is a very seasonable beer."
"Overall impression: Good session beer, not something I would seek out regularly. A cream ale can be a great beer (see Cape Kiwanda from Pelican). This one doesn't rise to that level, but it's not bad at all."
"This isn't the most complex of brews, for sure, but man is this good! Maybe it's the sentimental value to me, but I love this beer. Just a perfect smooth, yet crisp, mouthfeel. Sweet and malty flavor, with just the faintest of bites at the end. Slight bready aftertaste. Drinkable? I submit that it is. I seriously could drink this daily for the rest of my life and be happy. This is the quinticential 'summer-hanging out-lawnmower-bbq-chillin' beer out there. Recommend."
"This is the beer that got me into craft brews. It's an east drinking beer, great for the newer beer drinkers. I don't see the appeal anymore, but for old-time sakes I'll have one. It pours a straw yellow, smells fruityish, with a little off smell in there. Very light flavor, little wheaty tasting. Not alot here. But it's still a good drinker for newbie's."
"This light bodied beer has a creaminess that is hidden in the appearance and aroma, however it does feel pretty good in my mouth. If it weren't for the sweetness I would find this beer to be much more sessionable. All in all not a bad offering from New Glarus and in Wisconsin this is available at literally every bar/grocery store/gas station/liquor store around, this is certainly a better option than it's BMC counterparts."
"Drinkability: Low in alcohol and reasonably tasty/aromatic. This one's an interesting beast, and is sort of hard to fit into any sort of style (making it hard to therefore, you know, rate to style). I enjoyed, it however, and wouldn't mind living in an area where this was the idea of a session beer."
"I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes a mild cream ale, or if you are just looking for an all-around general drinking beer."
"D- I really dig it, a great session beer im liking it now when its cold out but I would love to drink this all day when camping or hanging out... also a great great gateway beer for people wanting to get into craft beer"
"Edit: I forgot one thing I really wanted to say. Drinking this beer from time to time is a good thing to do, because it pays the bills, making it easier for New Glarus to brew the award winning beers we all love so very much. Such a small price to pay..."
"D= The smoothness and lower alcohol make this beer drinkable and ideal to session. I personally was not too enamoured of the flavor though, so I will not likely have this one again."
"New Glarus really didn't impress me with this one. It's extremely reminiscent of a lager. I haven't had many cream ales, but I don't recall my prior experiences being similar to this. It's above averaage, but not by much. Suffice it to say it could use a lot of work in all areas. I wouldn't say it's worth seeking out."
"Drinkability- When I visited Milwaukee about six months ago I had a Bloody Mary at some random bar to start off my Sunday morning. They made it with a mixture of about half Mary mix, half Spotted Cow. It was one of the best Bloody Mary's I've ever had. I've been curious to what the beer actually tastes like on its own ever since. I probably enjoyed the Bloody Mary a bit more than the beer itself but either way it'd make a terrific session beer."
"I view this as a refreshing, session beer but nothing remarkable."
"D: This isn't the best New Glarus, nor the tops in terms of cream ales. Don't hate it, don't particularly like it. Bottom rung cream ale. Glad I had the chance, this is a terrific brewery- noone can bat a thousand."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a hazy lemon yellow with just a bit of a bright, white head that disappeared very quickly. After pondering the aroma for what seemed about 20 minutes, it finally hit me. Hot, fresh, ground corn tortilla chips. Man, it was like a sledgehammer upside the brain. I knew I recognized the smell; I just couldn't place it, then all of a sudden. Bam. This beer smells like corn, and tastes very much like sweet corn. There was almost no discernable hop presence. The mouthfeel is light and a bit dry. I would rather have this as a local easy drinker then the BMC stuff we get around here. This could very easily become a lawnmower beer if it was locally available."
"Bottom line: A good brew here. 'nuff said."
"D - This is a nice cream ale very sessionable and easy drinking."
"Poured a little on the yellowish side with not much head and not much carbonation. Very sweet smells which are the malts - kinda like homemade bread. Slightly smooth and easy to drink with the aftertaste of a little hint of hops in there. This is a beer I would call a summer brew that you have at a neighbor's barbecue party."
"Great for a lawnmower, but not my style. Not much from the flavor department."
"D-Very drinkable. A flavor profile that isn't astounding, but very pleasurable to drink. Have had many Spotted Cows in the past, and will surely have it again in the future (when I'm in WI)."
"Nice easy drinking beer. Well done."
"Overall this is a pretty decent beer , probably my favorite Cream Ale (which isn't saying much)."
"Overall, if this beer is available on tap at a local bar take this any day over the Millers and Buds of the world. Just because this is New Glarus' most recognized beer doesn't mean they threw a bunch of crap in it."
"not much carbonation. light to mid body. decent beer. i am new to cream ales. would like to try again."
"It is a really drinkable ale. It is very neutral yet not a watered down excuse for beer. I recommend this beer if you are buying for a large group and unsure of their tastes."
"D: Quite drinkable. A nice beer, but fairly bland. I swear this tasted better the last time I had this. Perhaps I'll come back to this review and amend in the future if future quaffs are different. Thanks to my wife for bringing this one back from Madison for me."
"I had this on draft in Wisconsin and was a little let down, because I'd heard good things about Spotted Cow. The bottle restores my faith. Cream ale still isn't one of my favorite styles, but this is a good one for sure."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the freebie. Pours a crisp clear straw yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a a noticeable amount of sweet malts. The taste is a smooth malt kick that comes through stronger in the finish, but still overall a little on the bland side. The beer is certainly crisp and refreshing as it should be for the style. This one is certainly drinkable, but I'd take a Lagunitas Sirius over this one any day."
"Edit, re-review: had a bottle at the Milwaukee airport 10/09, and I was struck by just how creamy and perfect the mouthfeel on this brew is. The fresh subtle flavor fits perfectly. I have upgraded my scoring accordingly."
"D: Honestly, I've never understood why this beer is so popular in Wisconsin. Never been a fan. After mulitple sessions, it's time to put this cow out to pasture."
"This is a welcome change of pace from my usual hop centered beer drinking. If you are looking for an unpretentious, easy to drink beer, this one fits the bill."
"Overall, almost like a lager with a excellent creamy hop edge. A shame we can't get it here in MI."
"Pours a straw yellow color with a one finger white head that dissipates quickly with no lacing. Light malt, grass and sweet fruit aromas. Toasted malt flavor mixes with lemon hops with a slight biscuit flavor. Medium body, medium carbonation, mouth cleansing with a nice hop finish, easy drinking."
"Yet another example of New Glarus greatness, I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied, very crisp and well carbonated. This would make a great session beer."
"A solid choice to spend an afternoon relaxing drinking some beer, but nothing that blows you away."
"Conclusion: This is my first experience with an American Cream Ale, and I wasn't sure what to expect. It's not bad by any means, but there's not that much to it. I think it would do nicely washing down simple fare like burgers and fries, but might be even better for introducing your BMC friends to craft brews, as it's something like a richer, fuller, and more robustly flavored American macro-lager."
"A little better than BMC. Certainly a lot worse than most NGs out there."
"For a Cream Ale this stuff is pretty damn good. I haven't had anything from New Glarus yet that I haven't enjoyed."
"The flavor is well-designed and tasty, without being overly complex. A light lemon meringue note floats effortlessly beside a backing of wheat, cream, and allspice. Very tasty for a Cream ale, and the mouthfeel is even better: light & crisp, with a creamy finish that lingers and brings hints of lemon peel and orange cream-sicle. Perfectly carbonated, too. New Glarus continues to surpass my expectations, delivering (yet again) a phenomal beer from a lack-luster beer style when compared to the vast sea of Double IPA's, Imperial Stouts, and Barleywines. Great Job!"
"D: Flows over the tongue very easily. Leaving a very nice taste behind making it easy to have more."
"D- This would make a wonderful session beer. The flavors are good, but not too in your face."
"Pours a hazed, glowing yellow color, bright white head fades fast into a thin ring around the beer, just a few spots of lacing left behind. Smell is sweet lemon, wheat, slight citrusy hop aroma. Taste is tart lemon rind, hearty wheat taste, and just a faint hint of banana in there too. Crisp and refreshing, the tartness and drying effect are somewhat intense, but I like it. Very tasty....if I lived in Wisconsin, I'd be drinking this all the time."
"D- Very easy drinking. The drink is light, the flavor is not dominant, and the alcohol is manageable. No wonder its in every pub in WI."
"It looks like a wheat beer - pale gold in color, hazy, with a disappointing white head. The aroma is mostly lemony with notes of the wheat malt too. The taste is similar - dominant wheat and lemon flavors, some spices I can't name, and banana, which I noticed more as time went on. Pretty good. The mouthfeel was nothing special - a little watery, perhaps. It went down easy though. Overall, it's a good summer brew."
"D= very drinkable, single or session."
"D - Extremely drinkable beer."
"Pours a superb hazy golden color. If I didn't know any better, I would guess that it was a heffeweizen, with a nice two finger head that dissipates quickly leaving behind a nice enough amount of lacing. Smell is of some grainy malts and some fruitiness. Taste is fruity, hints of apple and pear, slightly spicy, a nice hop undertone that doesn't take away from pale malts in the least, and lots of carbonation. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, medium bodied and quite delicious. I have not been disappointed from a New Glarus offering yet!"
"Not a lot going on, but it is a pleasant enough beer. I don't mind it as something light and a little different."
"M/D: A bit sweet, but enjoyable. Just a great session beer. Right ABV, refreshing, fantastic! Great job, Dan!!"
"Drinkability is great, especially on a hot day you can really knock them back. Great crowd pleaser to ease people into the craft scene."
"Pours a bright, hazy fluorescent yellow with a big puffy white head that lingers quite a while leaving some delicate lacing. Smell is dominated by the light sweet malts and yeast with a hint of hops, mainly lemony. This taste almost like a scaled-down hefe with very light malts and sweet grains. There is a hint of lemony hops in the taste as well. The mouthfeel is fairly light but a little creamy with a crisp finish. This is a fairly sessionable ale that would be a nice summer beer."
"Drinkability is high, this is one smooth and sessionable 'cream ale', nice balance of hops and fruit tones, good body and flavor, the MVP beer of my hotel's bar :P"
"D. Seems light enough to session but maybe a tad sweet for an ""all-dayer""."
"The body is light which is spot on (pun intended). Decent carbonation helps accents the corny and hop notes. Overall this is limited with some noticeable off flavors with a beer that is hard to high them."
"Inoffensive but kind of boring too. A mild ale for those who want a very mild ale, personally I need more flavor."
"D-Light and quaffable for sure. A definite well deserved substitute for BMC beers! I certainly would not mind putting a few of these back during warmer times...but not as a all year long brew."
"The drinkability is very good, this is by far a very good and easy drinking brew. Try it for lunch on a warm day. Prosit, MK"
"I know that a lot of folks from the midwest like this beer and swear by New Glarus as a brewery. Having said that, this just doesn't do it for me."
"D - Definitely light and quaffable. This is an interesting and unique beer that is nice during the summer months."
"this sample could be old so i will try again, but, did not live up to the hype."
"It has a hidden strength that catches up with you. The beer is so drinkable it's pretty easy to have that extra one or two! And that's a good thing!"
"Spotted Cow pours a cloudy pale yellow with 1/2"" of head that quickly dissipates. Smell is predominantly of yeast and corn. Taste is much of the same, the corn is noticeable as well as the unfiltered yeast, pretty well balanced. Full bodied, light on the tongue, perhaps a little under carbonated. Very drinkable, great session beer. This beer does no special tricks, it is what it is and what it is, is a great beer to spend an afternoon with."
"Tasted on 4/5/08."
"A great ""go-to"" beer, good ""gateway"" for macro-drinkers, and its one of my favorites for hot summer days. It strikes a balance of light body and well rounded flavor. Refreshing and pretty tasty."
"I cannot remember who sent this my way, but thanks, unknown BA"
"drinkability is good. this is not a strong or rich brew, and it does well at showing the cream character while still showcasing malts and yeast. an easy drinking summer brew. cheers!"
"D- Drinkability scores excellent here as it is very light, lower alcohol and easily drinkable. I can see this being a great crossover beer for BMC drinkers and a great session brew for beer geeks."
"Drinkability: A very easy drinking beer that's probably better suited to summertime temperatures in excess of ninety degrees. It's not often you see a cow-themed beer that doesn't turn out to be just another milk stout."
"D-An easy to drink brew. This is not my favorite offering from New Glarus, but it's worth sharing with friends that come visit, regardless of the level of discrimination in beer taste."
"It's not bad tasting, but it's got a big defect in it. You usually only see this in lagers, but cream ale is so light to begin with that every little thing will be accentuated. I can't really recommend it unless you like fruit beers. In that case, you might like this one."
"Spotted Cow is probably New Glarus' most popular beer, it's a good intro to craft beers. A little more flavorful than the macros but not too intense to scare people. Easy drinking and tasty."
"Over all a good really tasty beer. If you like this beer you should REALLY try a full on Hefe Weissen."
"A below average cream ale. Thanks to Deuane for the sample. I have been wanting to try this one for a while."
"A fantastic lawnmower beer or gateway beer. It's still tasty enough for the seasoned beer geek too."
"D: It's drinkable, I'll give it that. It's very tame, light, and not a whole lot different than drinking water. I guess it would be a decent option on a hot summer day. Besides that, skip it."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Poured a hazy light golden color with a thin white head that fades quickly. Smell is ligth with corn and sweet malt. Taste is light malt flavor with a sweetness. Mouth feel is light body with a mild carbonation. This is a session beer for sure but not very complex."
"Spotted cow reminds me of a big-boned PBR... Nothing to Mooo about, but if it was available in Boise, I would probably still pick up a few every summer just to have around when I wanted something quaffable when working in the yard."
"Light to medium bodied, and interesting. I could hit this one pretty hard any time of year. A good session beer and recommended to anyone trying to get out of the BMC rut."
"Taste is of sweet malts and fairly minimal in the hop dept. Very yeasty almost reminded me of some type of Belgian yeast strain."
"While not mind-blowing by any means, this is a solid chugger. Recommended."
"Perhaps my favorite brew. Been drinking it for years, and it's every bit as good now as it was then. Pours a lovely cloudy gold, and smells slightly sweet. Has a ""thick"" flavor (and feel), perhaps hops, perhaps corn or a fine mixture of the two. Slight fruity follow. Goes down extremely easily...very, very smooth. Have yet to find a better brew. Works any day of the year, and with any food/snack. Truly the elixir of the gods."
"Nice, full body, probably helped by the wheat. This beer is an excellent summer session beer that we try to keep around as much as possible (my wife loves this stuff)."
"D: I can't really speak for cream ales but this beer is not bad but not good either, it has nice parts to it but as a whole leaves me wanting more from it, pretty refreshing in a sense but I wouldn't go out of my way to get my hands on this beer."
"Served on-tap (and quite warm) at Dick's Bar and Grill, Hudson WI."
"Overall a decent session brew. Nothing outstanding, but all the flavors are pleasant. Label says that it is a 'farmhouse ale' but this isn't a saison. It's similar to a wheat beer but that doesn't fit either."
"Mouthfeel is average to slightly above average, for the style I say it is spot on, not too light but enough body to make this feel like a well crafted beer. Im not too fond of lagers, and this one obviously has lager qualities but blending it with an ale gives it a nice body that I feel combines two great aspects from both types of beers: refreshing taste, and a malt body to back it up. I wouldnt mind drinking this again."
"I haven't had a lot of cream ales but this is the most interesting one I have ever tasted. There's a nice subtle complexity to it that I find interesting, I wish more brewers would try this overlooked style. I'm drinking this after an evening jog and I'm definitely enjoying it. It would also make a great crossover beer due to its lack of any aggressive flavors."
"12 ounce brown bottle, without freshness dating. Pours cloudy, apricot amber, light tan head, with a musty nose. Mildly fruity creation, notes of some Belgian type yeast and some peppery spice. This is a crisp, dry offering with a hoppy finish. Worthy, everyday, easy drinking ale."
"Had the pleasure of getting a whole bunch of brews from New Glarus recently so I have been working my way down the line and this was the next one up. I am not normally a fan of cream ales, but I figured what the heck and decided to give this one a shot. It poured a very nice cloudy and very light yellow, almost a white color. A large three finger head of fizzy white lace formed on top and then it faded quickly leaving behind just minimal lace on the top, but adequate side glass lace. Lots of visible carbonation was apparent. The aroma was very light, and somewhat sweet. Not really too much to pick up, maybe some light malts and a touch of bread but that was it, the style is not really know to be very full. The taste was very light, and refreshing. A touch of yeast or light fruit graced the opening of a very carbonated and light bodied ale. This was more refreshing then anything and it served that purpose well. A somewhat muted taste, maybe a touch of sugar and almost a cola like flavor in the back. Overall this was not bad. As I mentioned I am not really a fan of the style, but this was the best I have had from it, with maybe the exception of the Terrapin Golden Ale. This was pretty good though, and I could see it used while mowing the lawn in July kind of thing. Not bad and give it a try if you get a chance."
"The beer pours a cloudy straw color with no visible head after an aggressive pour and left virtually no lacing on the glass. There really isn't much of a scent to this beer. I pick up on some slight citrus scent and almost a slight corn, but a very weak malt scent. The taste is very crisp and clean. No real hop flavoring to speak of, but I can pick up on the grain and lemony sweetness going down. The mouthfeel is actually quite nice and smooth and very easy drinking. It is refreshing and quite drinkable. The drinkability is good on this, and I think this would be a good cookout and ""just mowed the lawn"" type of beer."
"D-Very drinkable beer.Love the taste and smell,Belgian/France inspired?I might have to stock this one in the fridge."
"fruit mid-palate. A small hint of floral herbs that ends with a dry orange rhine finish. This beer went well with some soft cheese and a mix fruit plate of apricots, peaches, and apples."
"Pale straw-gold body, somewhat hazy. Medium white head tops it off. Sweet malt nose, hints of citrus. Sweet malt dominates the flavor, hints of hops, touch of citrus. Could use a bit more malt to bring out the flavor. Medium bodied, somewhat creamy. Not horrible but not my favorite."
"Pale yellow tone, small thin head of foam. This settles to a ring soon enough. Slightly hazy due to the yeast content. Slight corn in the aroma, mixed with pale malt. Taste is light with malt and mild citrus, vaguely bready. Mild overall, not unpleasant. Slightly fuller feel than your average lager, not really ""creamy"" though. Easy to put back a couple pints. Having these drafts, it felt like being in a speakeasy..."
"Pours a medium hazy-yellowish color. A nice light creamy head that starts nice, but thins rather quickly. Faint lacing that really sticks around the whole glass. Aroma of citrus with a buttered croissant smell. Very inviting and intriguing. Medium mouthfeel that is refreshing also. Possibly a little lemon zest as well. For a cream ale this is towards the top of the list."
"A re-review from having this on tap while out to eat a nicer establishment. Maybe my tounge is getting better or maybe the formula changed, but this is not as good as it used to be. The corn was over bearing, the taste did not blend well with my food. On it's own it is still a good beer, but with simple food that should blend with it, it is a no go"
"This concludes my New Glarus sampling. Although they were all solid beers, nothing really stood out except the bock."
"Pale golden color. Smells light and sweet. Tastes light, with a sweet finish, almost like bubblegum. Mouthfeel is smooth, but a bit light. This was pleasant enough, but a bit watery. Could have just been the batch on tap, I only had one glass. Not bad by any means, but I wasn't blown away."
"Not a bad brew. 12 oz. bottle brought to me by a friend from Wisconsin. I've never tried a cream ale before and was a bit taken back. As my friends and I joked, ""There are real bits of cow in Spotted Cow."" Smells of biscuit and cream, and tastes pretty milky. The mouthfeel is pretty velvety, but it was a bit sweet so drinkability was brought down. Overall, I enjoyed the flavor and thought it fit the category well, but I'm not a huge fan of cream, so I can't rate it too high."
"Straw colored with good head that holds up well. Nothing much to note about the smell, can tell that you are in for a little sweetness. A summer thirst quencher, sweet and sour with no after taste to distract you. Sweetness is reminiscent of sweet corn. Just enough body to feel like you are drinking something decent. Goes down fast by the pitcher. Packs more of a punch than I expect and I always forget. Makes riding bike home from the Memorial Union terrace fun after work on Friday."
"From the draught I bet this is amazingly good beer to drink when its on sale for $3 a pint."
"D - This isn't all bad, but it is a very awkward beer. It's sort of wit-like but it's too syrupy sweet and heavy. It needs to make up it's mind and be a vibrant summer quencher or a yeasty Belgian brew. It's not really either, but it did hit the spot on a hot summers day so it's not terrible."
"Cream ales are a complete unknown to me. Judging from this one I'd call them extremely drinkable, only mildly exciting but great for the summer, and generally porch-sittin' mellow. I only have more respect for New Glarus thanks to this beer and their Totally Naked offering, because what they're doing is neither pandering to extreme gonzo-beer fiends or trying to garner mainstream appeal. They just do it for the love of the craft, and that's why even their least remarkable beers come out winners."
"drinkability is excellent. a fairly straightforward beer, but well balanced and very enjoyable."
"D- a solid beer easily drank multiple times during the night"
"This is a great anytime of the year beer. Like all New Glaurus Brewery beers, it has a strong flavor, taste, and body...those cheeseheads know their beer! It has a smooth after taste that sits well in the mouth and is easy to down in summer or winter. I was also impressed that it tastes equally fresh in bottle as it does on tap...that is great aspect of this brewery."
"crisp, and quenching- all you really want out of a cream ale. Good stuff!"
"Taste was good but I kept wanting more from it. Good flavors but only three/quarters of what I wanted. Glad it was a gift because I wouldn't buy again."
"Drinkabilty is increased by the lack of creamy body."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy white head, some islands and sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, sweet, yeasty, cloves, and a light touch of spices. The taste is sweet, malty, and yeasty. Medium body. Drinkable, a good session brew for a hot day, recommended."
"Got in a trade with jeffkrenner - thanks! Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating system into my pint glass. It was a hazy paleish yellow with bits of yeast floating around in it. It had a very small head that was gone in a blink of an eye. No lacing. The aroma was malty with lemon overtones. At first, it had a wet grass smell like a lawnmower beer but it faded. Good aroma for a summer beer. The taste was pretty good. It won't knock you on your ass with flavor but it does go down smooth. Would make a great session beer or a trainer beer for you macro friends. Overall, a good solid session beer that is worth trying if you can easily get your hands on it. (4, RR-NAH, T, Y)"
"This beer reminds me of the Bavarian ""Kellerbier"" I drank so much of in Germany. It is a hazy golden color with a bit of carbonation and a decent head that diminished, but did not entirely disappear. It had an aroma of corn and barley with a slight yeastiness/mustiness to it. It is fairly light beer, with a slight sweet corn flavor and goes down fairly easy. It's also the best beer I've used for parboiling brats before grilling them."
"i was anxious to try this as i was at a crap bar on some lake in wisconsin and knew there was only bmc there. when i saw the spotted cow sign, i thought it was a tease, but they actually served this at this fucking shithole bar. this one did not live up to my excitement over finding a new glarus brew for the first time, however. this was a light gold in color and just a tad hazy. nose was very subtle, some sweet, doughy malts and a hint of buttery corn and straw. taste is a light malt sweetness and just a touch of hops. this one is balanced more by the creamy carbonation. light and lively mouthfeel. drinkable, especially when your only other options are bmc and jaegerbombs."
"Bottle courtesy of Monger: Poured a bright golden color ale with a big pure white head with good retention. Aroma of corn with light diacetyl is not extremely pleasant. Taste is dominated by too much corn with a light buttery note which is again unpleasant. Body is pretty full for the style with some great carbonation. This is probably the worst beer that I had from this otherwise fine brewery."
"Drinkability - This is an easy to drink perfect summer beer."
"D: Very drinkable."
"D: One I'd drink again. Seems pretty easy to drink and summer-worthy."
"Spotted Cow is a nice beer, but I can't really say I'm impressed. It's about the same as Genessee Cream Ale. The flavor is sweet and bland. It's hard to make out the grains or any concrete flavor. You know, on a hot Wisconsin summer day, this would probably hit the spot, but that's about it."
"Pours a a somewhat murky bright sunshine yellow with a one finger fluffy white head that quickly dies down to a very thin layer. No stickiness, no legs, not much in terms of holding on. Smell is very fresh. Clean lemon and floral odors, very inviting yeasty notes. Soft flavors on the tongue of biscuits, grass, and mild lemon. Aftertaste is almost not even there, but has a weak pale malt flavor. Very pleasing mouthfeel, soft medium body with just enough carbonation for a good balance in the mouth. I could put a lot of these down pretty easily. I gotta trade for some more of this one for sure."
"Mouthfeel was medium to thin in the body, medium to light in carbonation."
"This brew is almost exactly what it purports to be: an easy-drinking 'lawnmower' brew that conjures up a certain nostalgia for the rolling hills of Wisconsin farmland. It will never have the collector's-item/""let's trade"" cachet of other New Glarus brews, and it doesn't seek it. This is a brew meant to buy, drink, and enjoy in Wisconsin."
" ~ This is a good summer beer. Great on hot days when ya wanna sit outside on the porch and have a couple. Even better if you're out boating with friends. If the opportunity presents itself, Have a Cow!"
"D: This is a real sessioner, light on alcohol without skimping on taste. The beer is going right back on my 'wants' list."
"OK, not something I am terribly interested in drinking more of. Too sweet for my taste."
"I highly recommend this beer to those who are looking to branch from the mainstream flood of commercial beers. It is a good gateway beer for maturing connoisseurs and is a fan favorite of even the most particular pallets."
"D- Very drinkable, perfectly fit the nice mild/cool spring evening while I was enjoying this one!"
"Highly regarded among both my older and younger friends, Spotted Cow by New Glarus Brewing is Brewmaster Dan Carey's most popular beer. It is as close to an everyman's macrobrew as you can get, yet this fine brew has a tad more character. Pours a clear light amber with nice head and a lingering white lace. Smell is fresh and lightly hoppy and sweet. Taste is crisp, lightly refreshing and as Michael Jackson likes to say, moreish. Very light mouthfeel, but there is slightly more there than the watered down swill that is consumed by the clueless. Very drinkable and satisfying."
"Thanks nflmvp for another new NG beer to try."
"Drinkability - all things considered, despite the average taste, this beer has a lot going for it elsewhere. Thanks to jj21 for this sample, toasted in honor of the birth of Monkeyknife's 3rd child. And another toast in the hope that he gets four or more consecutive hours of sleep sometime between now and the end of May."
"Took from the fridge and poured right into my glass. Poured slightly cloudy yellow with small white head comprised of big bubbles. Head dissipated quickly. Aroma was barely detectable. More CO2 bite in the aroma than anything else. Taste like any average ale. Not bad. Not great, but very drinkable."
"This ones okay. Par at best."
"overall I really enjoyed this beer a deffinate session type beer would be very nice on a hot summer day"
"The high protein levels in the corn and flaked barley give this a nice creamy feel. While the carbonation may not seem active to the eye, it sure does pack a wallop on the palate. Sure, it may not be the most complex and interesting beer I've ever drank, but it's very easy to consume and doesn't offend. For what it is, it's a well crafted brew, and I appreciate the fact that they use all local ingredients. Kudos for that. Yet again, thanks to my fellow John's Grocery asshole: Joe."
"Try if you can, it will be worth it!"
"A refreshing and enjoyable brew if you're in the mood for this style."
"Drinkability - Nothing wrong with this beer, just not a very exciting style. Excellent replacement for macro-lager, but not much more. This beer has become quite popular in Wisconsin and I for one am glad to see a small brewer who does make some very high quality beers reach a large market."
"This is a really great beer. I tried it at an Outback Restaurant when I asked for whatever local Microbrew they had on tap. Much to my suprise, I found this to be one of the best beers I've ever had. Very versitile in taste, in that it can easily go with a good meal or just by itself, summer or winter. It is too bad that you can only buy it in Wisconsin... So if you happen to be traveling through the Cheesehead State, make a specific point to buy a case or two of this really good beer."
"Would beat the snot out of Corona in the cooler in the summer."
"This beer poured a hazy orange color with just a slight off white ring around the edge of the glass, no real sustainable head. There was a slight citrus aroma to the beer. The taste of the beer was mainly of citrus, a touch of hops on the tongue and wheat. Overall Spotted Cow is an easy drinking, smooth beer but is not overly complex."
"D - Nice easy drinking beer, sessionable."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle a cloudy, light yellow with about half an inch of white foam. Smells of hay, sweet corn, and the lightest touch of grassy hops. Taste's of mild bitter hops, hints of citrus and then comes a nice maltiness. I was expecting this beer to be rather light in the mouth, but it wasn't. It was smooth and creamy, very nice. I would really like to revisit this beer on a warm late spring day."
"Drinkability: Not one I thought I would like, based on the characteristics of the style, but this is, as usual, another quality beer from New Glarus."
"On tap at Diamond Dave's. Smelled like a lager actually, very faint aroma anyway. Hazy green-yellow color. Actually tasted like a lager also. I could not detect fruit-y-ness, vanilla, or 'fun'. There was some corn hints. It is a beer with a full character, not a character I care for, but it had a full character for what it was. no lacing."
"Poured out an orange-gold color and very cloudy with lots of tiny bubbles feeding a stark white head that rapidly diminishes. The nose is very sublte, a touch of sourness plays with lemon and hay. The taste has sweet corn, wheat and lemon twist, with a small amount of bitter hops. The mouthfeel was smooth, low carbonation, with a quick slightly bitter finish."
"Received as part of a mixed sixer trade with the mighty nflmvp -- big thanks, Steve! I really like the brewers' claim on the label that this is a ""Wisconsin farmhouse ale"". Seems as appropriate an appellation as any for a Cream Ale brewed with corn and flaked barley. Pours a hazy golden color with an active, short-lived, snow white head. Nothing too complex in the aroma: soured bready grains with a bit of grassy hop scent on top of a slightly sweet-smelling caramel malt quality. Sort of like an uninspired Pale Ale. Earthy bready flavors become apparent at first sip, rounding out into a sweetish malt taste punctuated with mildly spicy and grassy hops. Candy corn and vanilla sweetness arrives at the finish, highlighting the sort of sticky mouthfeel of this beer. Medium body seems a little thick for the flavor profile, thereby setting back the drinkability. Certainly not a bad beer, and I get the sense that it pays many of the bills so that we can enjoy such world class offerings as the Wisconsin Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart. Nothing I'd seek out again, but certainly happy for the opportunity to have tried it."
"Dits good, but different to my palette, I think this would be a good transition beer."
"This is an extremely popular beer here. When I first discovered it years ago, I was truly in love. It was different, it was local, it turned me on to other crafted brews. I introduced it to friends and family, and they were also blown away by it. Now I'm kind of sick of it. It's too sweet for my liking, and what was once new and exciting for this naive beer drinker, is too simple for me now. However, this will forever be the ambassador of crafted brew in my mind."
"Man Up!"
"This brew pours a clear straw color. The head is two-fingers in heigth and recedes rather quickly into sparce lacing. The aroma is of yeast, and corn. The taste is not unlike the aroma, very corny. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and is somewhat silky. Overall, this beer isn't bad, but I don't see why so many people think it is so great."
"Slainte!"
"The beer is good, drinkable, and oh so cool."
"A nice one to slurp down after mowing the lawn, tending the plants outside, etc."
"When in Madison, this is my standby beer. Not a great beer and probably my least favorite New Glarus brew, but a wonderful alternative to BMC."
"I know this beer gets ripped by some, but for what it is, I think it's very well made."
"Nothing about this beer screams out ""hey, look at me!", but that's part of what makes it so damn drinkable."
"A great example of a mediocre style."
"This is a decent cream ale, light on all front but not offensive. Its spicy for a cream ale, but not in a traditional spicy hop way."
"This beer is a fantastic choice for a session beer or as a pallete cleanser between high hop beers. Great for summer as well. Wish I could get it where I live."
"Appearance is a typical pale fizzy beer, not much foam. Aroma is citrusy, tart but mild. Initial taste has minimal hops and malt, some fruit, in the middle, but the finish is crisp and clean. No great shakes, but a decent beer for a hot afternoon. This was a gift shipped from Wisconsin to Colorado, and I am grateful for a chance to taste the products from another state."
"Drinkability: Not for me but on a hot day outside I could drink a few and probably feel refreshed (somewhat)."
"It is a slightly hazy yellow-golden color, with a head that foams up well, but dies quickly. The smell has a slight hoppy aroma, and is a bit spicy, but mainly a bit grainy. The flavor is initially a tangy, almost wheaty zest that is fairly sweet. They do use some corn in brewing this, but it's not so much an adjunct as it is a salute to Wisconson farmers, but it does affect the flavor and add to the general grain backdrop of the beer. The finish almost had an spicy apricot flavor to is, which is what impressed me the most about this beer, except the drinkabiliy. This is a very sessionable beer (fitting for my initial disclaimer, see above.)"
"Not bad if you wanna drink A LOT."
"The taste is lemony with a light body. The hops are very light and there is little malt."
"My wife and I stopped in New Glarus during their annual polkafest (which was extremely enjoyable) and the brewery had a couple of their beers on tap to try (and i course i hit up both). Spotted Cow poured (into a plastic cup) yellow to gold with an off-white head. Odor was kind of corny and vaguely malty, but overall not very strong at all. Taste was a thin mix of alcohol, corn juice, malt and extremely faint hops. Mostly it seems to just be a mildly refreshing, corn-based (which i verified with the guy manning the tap) hot weather beer. Nothing special IMO, but my wife thought it was darn good."
"D: It is what it is. And for what it is, its not bad. Not anything I would ever hunt down but ok."
"D- This is a nice summer session beer and I had no idea what style it was until I read BA. I thought it was some kind of cream weizen beer but the flavors are soft but very pleasant."
"Very nicely done and a good drinking beer. Too bad the small restauraunt I enjoyed it in served it with a small pilsner glass."
"I can definetly see why New Glarus is pumping this stuff out so much."
"Pours a orangish straw gold with a half finger of head that lasts about 7 seconds, and little bubbles sticking to the glass which lend to the nice carbonated yet creamy mouth, but a little odd for looks. Not much aroma, grassy and malty with some corn, just enough to barely detect. Taste is a little odd, sweet malts are evident, but there is this wierd tart fruit in there, though I couldn't quite pin it down. Honestly, not really impressed by this beer, nor can I understand its populartiy. Oh well, more for you 'Sconnies."
"This would probably be a great beer for a hot day, when you want something cold and thrist-quenching. However, it's not high on my list of beers to return to, as it lacks that complexity and fullness of flavor that leaves me wanting more."
"This beer is average in every sense. Pale cloudy gold color, thin almost non-existant white head. Smell is very mild malt, touch of spice. Taste is rather bland, grainy tasting. Cream ale style says highly carbonated, which this one isn't. It just sits on the palate, no moutfeel at all. Maybe it's the styles i've been drinking lately but this beer holds no draw for me. I'll pass on this one in the future."
"-UF"
"Mild grain and light alcohol in the aroma. Hazy yellow color. No head. Cool and refreshing with very little taste. Mild malty sweetness in the aftertaste. It is actually pretty dang thirst quenching though extremely un-flavorful. Not bad tasting just not much of anything tasting. It makes you take big gulping sips."
"Definitely unique and worth a try."
"D: I could see myself drinking quite a few of these on a hot summer day. It seems like its more of a light Belgian Wit or something rather than a Cream Ale though."
"I'm not gonna say this is a bad beer, but it is an awkward one. It exists in the nether region between BMC and complex craft brews. It appeals to the former with aspects of the latter and is priced accordingly. But, while sweet and very drinkable, if I wanted a beer like this, I'd grab a Miller. Oh, it's better than Miller to be sure, but not enough to really warrent the price."
"Refreshing and summery, a very drinkable beer, but would become world class with a bit of wheat or rye."
"Spotted Cow pours a cloudy pale yellow with 1/2"" of head that quickly dissipates. Smell is predominantly of yeast and corn. Taste is much of the same, the corn is noticeable as well as the unfiltered yeast, pretty well balanced. Full bodied, light on the tongue, perhaps a little undercarbonated. Very drinkable, great session beer. This beer does no special tricks, it is what it is and what it is, is a great beer to spend an afternoon with."
"Drinkability: This beer is really popular in Wisconsin, and it's good, but not as good as everyone hyped it up to be. I'm a little disappointed but I still think this is a fine beer, and I look forward to trying more from New Glarus."
"Generally a great session beer but nothing too special. This has become the quintessential Wisconsin micro but dont go expecting something spectacular from it. Its really more of a micro for the masses then anything else."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I could waste away an afternoon sipping these. This beer might not be worth the 100-mile round-trip to Wisconsin on a weekly basis, bit it is a great alternative to macrobrews when on Bucky's side of the Mississippi."
"Pours light amber with an orange tinge, not much head, slight lacing, and light carbonation. Smell is light with yeasts, hints of fruits. Taste is more pronounced than the nose, but still light and subdued. Mild yeasts, a lot of creaminess, light fruits. Very smooth mouthfeel. Creamy without being very heavy. A little overly light for my tastes. It's like cream soda without the fizziness or the sweetness. Or, a belgian without the oomph."
"Picked this one up on my way to the lake and enjoyed several of these fishin on the boat. It poured a very cloudy pale yellow color with little to no head. Smells milky and creamy and tastes very creamy and sweet with a nice mixture of hops. this one is a good session beer."
"It is a good hot weather summer beer."
"It speaks well of a brewery when they can do well even with a style of such ""subtle"" substance."
"Flavor is malty, sweet, with a nice hop balance. This a nice round, but not full, mouthfeel, and has very very high drinkability, very refreshing. This is not a sipper, this is for gulping down a bunch. Good stuff. Too bad it just isn't nicer to look at! The real problem, though is my girlfriend stealing this from me while I'm trying to review it!"
"On-Tap in Milwaukee. This one is light golden with a small head of white that dies quickly, leaving no real lacing. Aromas are pretty basic, cream ale aroms. A bit of malt, a tinge of adjunct sweetness, and some background hops. Taste is similar with no real standout flavors and mouthfeel is in the medium range. Nothing complex, just a simple good DD."
"Opinion: I am not the best reviewer of Cream Ales, as this isn't one of my favorite styles. I believe that this beer is one of the tastier examples of this style that I have tried. Most other examples get caught up in trying to supplement with the corn, so you end up with a beer that tastes like runoff from a bowl of grits...that isn't the case with this beer. It is a good one to give a shot."
"Pours a golden straw color with minimal to no head. In the bottle it's much more cloudy and interesting to look at. Smells surprisingly macro and adjuncty - mostly wheat and corn. Taste is disappointingly the same, lots of corn and with a hint of cooked vegetables. Really not impressed by this stuff anymore. Maybe I've just been ruined by all the delicious complex dark beers I've been enjoying of late, but the ol' Cow just doesn't do it for me anymore. It's not BAD, but not something I would pick up a sixer of on my way to a party anymore."
"Purchased for $3.50 a 12 ounce bottle at Grant's Old Stage Station in Egg Harbor, Wisconsin. Pours a hazy slightly cloudy gold. Some yeast aroma in the nose. Bottle conditioned ? Slightly fruity flavor but otherwise light and uneventful. Finish is somewhat chewy, aftertaste goes away very quickly."
"I've had this beer many times before, as it's by the the most popular micro, and one of the most popular beers period, in Madison. It was hard to objectively rate the appearance, since I know from experience that this beer is very inoffensive. However, if I had never had this before, and someone set a glass of it in front of me, I wouldn't exactly be chomping at the bit to drink it. It's a very cloudy light orange color that looks more like something from GNC than a beer. Doesn't really smell like much at all; tastes a little fruity and feels nice and creamy in my mouth, but that's it. In retrospect, I can see why this beer is so popular with my college friends in Madison--it's even better than a macro lager at tasting like nothing, and it has absolutely no bitterness. It tastes right off the bat like I've been drinking beer all night and can no longer taste anything."
"Initially sweet it finishes relatively clean. Easy session ale and especially good in Summer. I've had it on tap as well and remember it to be better on draught than bottled."
"This beer has a hazy yellow color with no head at all. The aroma is slightly malty, but not at all interesting. The flavor is sweet, with no bitterness. There is some fruityness, like lemon and pineapple. Not at all creamy. Low carbonation. If there were some bubbles, at least it would have been easier to drink. I did not like this beer very much. It's available at almost every bar in Madison. Who drinks this?"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat creamy with a nice smoothness after each sip. An easy drinking cream ale that would go nice on a hot day. Worth a shot."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the slightly cloudy, light golden brew. Head,fades to an uneven layer of bubbles, and lacing is minimal. Aroma is light pale malt with a tinge of citrus. Taste starts with smooth pale malts, and closes somewhat crisply with a bit of citrus character. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, but without easy access of this one, it falls into the ""why bother"" category for me."
"A very hazy, light gold color, with a sizable white foam head on top. Smell is corn and light floral hoppiness. Taste does have a little too much corn in it for my liking, but it almost fits in with the creamy and subtley hoppy flavors of this beer. I am having this beer at cellar or warmer temp. A lot better than I remember my first sample. A pretty good and interesting beer, try it for a very diffrent experience with corn in beer."
"Finger licking good!"
"Thanks again to Dogbrick and I look forward to other's from New Glarus"
"Pours a nice golden straw color with almost no head, even after a slight shake in an attempt to rouse carbonation. The aroma is malty, bready and creamy, then yeasty, fruit and spice. The flavor is sweet malt, wheatlike in nature, and the yeast has some really nice character. I dont think I would classify this as a cream ale. The beer is very bitter at all which may result from the additional sweetness provided by the undercarbonation. Overall this is a good easy drinking summer beer, that I would like to re-rate when I have one that is fully carbonated."
"Drinkability gets an average. I wouldn't knock people over to try it, but I wouldn't shun it either."
"Drinkable but almost seems like a wheat better suited for a hot summer day rather than a cold winter night."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this one. I like the name. This one poured a clean yellow color then took on a lot of cloudiness because my dumb ass didn't realize it was bottle conditioned. Oh well, I don't mind some yeasties. Small head that dies off quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma was very subtle, but had a slight grassy and grainy character. Not what I was hoping for. The flavor wasn't what I was hoping for either. There is very little, if any, of the cream character I'm used to from other brands of cream ales. It has a slightly tart citrus thing going on (lemon?) and that same grainy feel from the aroma. Not so much my thing here."
"I've had this before, but its been over a year. It pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a small ring of head. The nose is somewhat lemony, a little grainey. The flavor is pretty weak, with a slight zesty lemon and honey in there, but the flavors are really just weak. The feel is smooth and creamy, ith a slight carb. Not a bad beer by any means, but far inferior to anything else I have had from this brewery."
"This beer, as you can see by my username is my all time favorite. I live about 80 mi. south of the Wisconsin line, and go to Woodman's right across the line on 94 at least once a month to get a couple of sixers. Introduced to it originally on tap, and was hooked immediately. The taste and drinkability are one of a kind, even with the hint of corn, it seems to actually accentuate the taste, which is unlike all of the other corn-fed macrobrews out there. The cloudiness and small amount of yeast make it appealing to the eyes, as well. I guess if it is any consolation, its a good thing that I have to drive to get it, otherwise I would be broke and drunk all of the time with this brew around. Cheers!"
"This beer is a lightly hazy pale golden color with a very thin white head. No real lacing. Aroma of hops, fruit and grain. Light-bodied and crisp, with some corn taste. There are also hops and malt flavors. The finish is clean and lightly fruity. Not a bad Cream Ale."
"Spotted Cow is a rather unique brew. I imagine that New Glarus sells a lot of it, but as we all know, there's no correlation between popularity and quality (except, in many instances, an inverse correlation). I don't hate The Cow, but I don't really like it either. Thanks all the same to Skidz for the bottle."
"If Im going to have a Cream Ale from Southern Wisconsin, I would seek out the offering from City Brewery before this one. However, I will not pass this one up if offered."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this bottle."
"This is a very good beer out of Wisconson. It is a great beer for a Saturday or Sunday full of buddies and football. I actually had this when my dad had tried it at a restaraunt when he was teaching a seminar at the University of Wisconson and thought I would like it and brought it back for me. Unfortunately I only get it once a year, but it is definately something I look forward to."
"This beer pours a straw yellow. The nose on this beer is respectable in that it is original and somehow seems to tie it right in to Wisconsin with its corn-like and grainy aroma. Imagine a good ""drinking all night"" beer that was just a little creamier than usual. It is lightly carbonated but that doesn't seem to take anything away from its mouthfeel. Overall I think its a good beer but it's nothing to be disappointed about if they don't sell at your local grocier."
"This beer goes down like a report on the various grains possible to a Midwestern brewer. A tasty drinker and a good choice for a flagship brew."
"Really a nicely balanced brew- and I am not one to wax about basic pilsners. Clean finish and excellent drinkability."
"The scent is light - sweet wheat and veggies. The tasty is slightly more fruity, with corn notes and a creamy, fruity aftertaste. Not a bad beer - it went down easy, but still not something I want to drink often."
"I have however noticed this beer starting to slip in quality. Maybe my BA senses are just coming through, but this is no doubt a good session beer, but its individuallity cannot hold itself in the light of greatness."
"12oz. bottle: The pour was a bit of a suprise: it is a bit of a hazy, light golden color, with a large white head. The head dies down quickly, but it does look like a Belgian Wit. There is a bit of a wheat nose to the beer. Also, I get some spiciness and citrus, albeit faint. It has most of the taste characteristics of a Wit, but it is a thin and watery version of one. OK, but it should be more potent. Just average."
"I've had worse. Maybe this beer is just an attempt at ramping-up swill drinkers. I'll try others by the brewery. I could also understand having a place in your heart for this - if I grew up on it, it might be a good fall back."
"(M. Shusterman)"
"ng"
"Thanks to cokes for helping me try it out!"
"This is described on the label as a ""farmhouse ale," and indeed it seems more like a French than a cream ale. Nice looking head dissipates quickly, leaving a hazy, strawlike body. I get nice effervescence and a grapefruitty, almost sour taste. They get some props for not only admitting to using corn, but giving a reason: ""We even give a nod to our farmers with a little hint of corn."" Corn seems to be the source of the sweetness more than the malt. Hop finish is there, but not distracting. A very pleasant experience."
"My first impression was that this beer is a wheat - the nose hints of wheat, it has a light, cloudy amber color and it tastes like a wheat. Not as intense as a true wheat, carbonation is light, starts as a mix of malt and hops and finishes fairly smooth and sweet. Moderate head that leaves little lace. The brewer has barley and corn in it so I don't know where the wheat overtones come from."
"I had this one at a pub last weekend while I was in Milwaukee. It came to me with a hazy orangish-yellow color and had no head to speak of. That kind of scared me. As I drank it I noticed that this one seemed rather light in body. I gave a sip to one of my buddies who hardly ever drinks beer, and it's Michelob Light when he does, and he said it was light. My other buddy had a Sam Adams. I tried his and realized that the Sam Adams was much thicker and tastier than the Spotted Cow. The Spotted Cow had an estery aroma to it. Taste was predominately wheat malts but I did notice corn adjuncts in the flavor. No hops to speak of which might have been nice. The finish is quite good with a bready yeasty kick in it. For what it's worth this beer did go down really easy and I could easily drink another one and more after that. It wasn't bad, but not really my style."
"Slighly hazy but not really cloudy medium yellow illuminated appearance. A couple of small chunks. Nice sheet laces. Yeasty and estery aromas, just suggestive, fresh, and not overwhelming. Malting is straightforward, a creamy sweetness with an underlying stuffy fruitiness, tending toward apricot. Hops are minimal at best, the mouthfeel carries on and finishes the flavor profile with more of the same, into the aftertaste. I'd classify as light to medium bodied, overall. Pleasant, popular -- but pretty sweet and unremarkable. I'd give session status to this widely consumed product."
"Smell is light, clean, and soft malts of sweetness, with a dulling floralness of hops dotted through each wiff. Taste is clean and creamy sweetness of softly done malts, kinda frothy grainyness, like intensely whipped cream malts or something, quite a appetizing feel, but it doesn't last I'm afraid, but the creamyness stays til the end where it cleans up with a touch of floral hops and goes dry; nice and easy, clean and creamy little drinker."
"The beer pours a hazy orange-gold with decent head formation. The aroma is sweet and malty with a slight fruitness in the background, pleasant and unassuming. The taste is likewise sweet and malty, with a floral hop balance. Overall a very enjoyable ale that is also a very good session beer."
"This unfiltered beer looked much more cloudy in the 12 ounce brown twistoff bottle than it did once I poured it into my glass. The beer poured a slightly cloudy bright yellow. The head was fluffy white and not long lasting but it left a little lace on the side of the glass. The aroma of malt jumps out of the glass and fills your nose. What a joy. It makes the anticipation much greater. The taste lives up to the aroma. A sweet maltiness grabs your tongue and lingers in your mouth. The mouthfeel is medium light and has a slight creaminess. This is a great beer for pleasure and for a session. Too bad my friend only brought me one. DAMN!!!!"
"Pours out to a cloudy, golden color in the glass with a slight head, with some suspended particles floating in there. It does look appetizing in the glass, almost sunshine-like. Aroma is somewhat yeasty and musty. The taste is quite good. There is alot of malt here which lends itself to a slight sweetness. I detected some lemon in here as well. This is an easy to drink refreshing thirst quencher."
"A slightly hazy light lemon yellow color as it sets in the glass; head is modest in size, frothy in texture and as it evanesces, leaves behind a silky sheet of lace. Sweet malt dominates the nose, fresh and clean to the senses with the start sweet and loaded with malt. Top is medium in mouth feel, finish has a light carbonation and the hops apropos to the style, nicely dry and drinkable."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden hue with a quick fading white head. Leaves no lace, just a ""cling-ring"" and a small island of foam in the center of my glass. Noticeable corn aroma with an underlying fruitiness. Taste is somewhat malty; corn is noticeable too. No hop bitterness to speak of. Finishes somewhat dry and clean. Very refreshing and an easy drinker. It's too bad I won't be able to get this in Illinois or Indiana anymore. I will miss it."
"One of my favorite offerings from New Glarus. Spotted Cow is a bottle conditioned farmhouse ale. Pours an unfiltered bright golden color with a white head that disappeared in a matter of seconds. Carbontation seen in the body. Fruity aroma with hints of corn and malt. Thin, yet crisp mouthfeel. Flavors primarily coincide with the aroma-- that being of corn and malt. Finish is sweet with practically no hop bitterness present at all. This is a wonderful all-around, easy drinking beer to be enjoyed anytime."
"New Glarus Spotted Cow: A wonderful “farm” ale, bottle conditioned, with yeast in the bottle. Appears to be a weiss beer, with a slight yeast/banana aroma. Very light tasting, with understated malts and hops creating a light citrus taste. Very easy to drink, very light and refreshing. This would be a wonderful beer in the summer, and very good all the time. Pick it up if you see it."
"I was given this beer by a friend to try, so I am not certain as to its age.  Clear golden color with minimal carbonation and some white sediment in the glass.  The smell was fruity/sweet, with slight hops undertones.  The taste was a bit more fruity, with malt playing more of a role.  Without much carbonation, the beer flows quite smoothly.  It is a refreshing beer and highly drinkable, especially on a hot summer day."
"Although not my favorite, this is a solid offering from New Glarus. Its somewhat cloudy, pale color reminds me of a German hefe, but not quite. The smell isn't very appealing. Spotted Cow has a grainy aspect due to the addition of corn in the brewing process, which creates a somewhat prickly mouthfeel. This is a good choice for a hot day."
"This golden bottle conditioned ale is quite a nice surprise.  The golden cloudy color due to suspended yeast gives off a cask-conditioned hop aroma.  Initially ester flavor touches the palate followed by a small smokey lager-like musky flavor.  The finish is light and sweet.  A nice refreshing ale."
"This beer poured a very light yellow color and formed a very nice white head that left some nice lace as it subsided.  A good bit of carbonation.  The aroma was lightly of citrus and malt, with a hint of hops.  The flavor was of citrus and a slight bit of malt and hops.  The finish was light and a touch bitter with some elements of the carbonation coming into play.  While not the best representation of this style, it makes a good summer session brew."
"This would be THE perfect keg to have at a summer get-together.  It is extremely smooth and easy drinking.  It is cloudy bright yellow...it poured charged up but doesn't taste that way.  The aroma is average at best and smells a bit like a macro (corn adjunct?)..The taste is pretty creamy and smooth...good but not overbearing maltiness, and very little hop bite on the finish....slides down very nicely...would be a GREAT session beer...I like this...I don't think it's the most complex or greatest tasting beer ever made but it is nice in its own right.."
"Light fruity, yet largely malt aroma.  Also a grainy, bready quality to it.  Yellow-gold and mostly clear with a thin head that disappears quickly, but leaves traces after each drink.  Flavor is mild overall.  Nothing particularly distintive about it. Malt taste with some fruitiness in undertones, with mild hop presence in bitterness.  Pretty quick finish.  Seems refreshing and smooth for summer, but in an ale way.  Feels fully carbonated, yet medium to thin. The more I drink it the more I like it."
"As long as your are not expecting to be blown away, the beer will serve it's purpose it a fashionably."
"This beer is getting a lot more popular lately in the central Wisconsin area...and I am gaining a growing appreciation of the New Glarus Brewing Company. A very smooth beer with a decent golden color. Has a light mouthfeel with very good drinkability. If you make it to WI try this one, you will appreciate it."
