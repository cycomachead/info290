"Average cream ale with wheat notes dominating the aftertaste."

"Light cracker to very light biscuit with a hint of tartness on the nose. Pours hazy straw to gold under an inch of white foam. Very soft, light white bread with hints of sourdough on the palate joined by very light fruit such as pear. Light, refreshing and effervescent."

"This comes from Cold Spring, MN, so it didn't travel far. The color is a pale, clear gold. with very little carbonation. There is almost no smell. The very mild taste is slightly sweet, just tangy enough to make the mouth water but not withdraw, hint of lemon, slightly bitter edge. And it feels creamy. I added a thin slice of lemon partway through. With the lemon I would give it an extra half point, especially on a hot day. It could be crisper/more carbonated."

"Very inoffensive and easy to drink. Decent for the style and a solid companion for a shot summer day."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a pale golden amber with a thick white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of bready, biscuit malt, corn adjunct, sweet; standard light beer. Taste follows aroma, mild sweet malt, grains, fairly subdued, finishes with slightly more robust grainy malt and a hint of grassy hops. Light bodied. Cream ales seem to be craft beer's attempt at adjunct lager and this one fits the mold. Pleasant and a bit more flavorful than an adjunct beer, but nothing inspirational. Fine for lunch."

"Pale yellow beer with a thin white head that persists but leaves no lacing. Smells fairly grainy, some yeast and faint cooked corn. Taste is smooth, unassuming. Wheat, grain are the forefront of a mild ale. It's not offensive in any way and has a fairly clean finish. I'm looking for other things to say about it. It seems a step or two above a mass produced adjunct lager. Would be easy to swig down a six pack right now in November in MN or on a hot summer day. Cheers,"

"Great beer for an easy drink. A beer that you could start a new beer drinker on. Creamy and a nice color when poured out. A beer that is going to taste better on tap, 9 times out of 10. Satisfying and perfect with food. 3rd Street has a nice brew here if you are looking for a light ale and a Minnesota brew"

"Rise to the Top is good, no doubt about it. Read the other reviews, I agree with 99% of what they say. Hey, I live within a stones throw of the brewery and am proud that 3rd Street Brewhouse has been able to survive while others have taken the deep 6."

"I first became acquainted with the style of cream ales LONG BEFORE I was an experienced beer snob. SCENE: 1979 beach bum w/ bent antenna static box blaring pop AM and a cooler filled with iced ponies of BLATZ LIGHT CREAM ALE. Beach bum? ...me. Now THAT was a tasty beer...course I didn't care much for the domestic American swill passed off as ""beer"" back in those days...so this beer was like an enlightening premium craft at the time - it beat out Little Kings by a long shot. Unfortunately, it is long gone now. The Cream Ale Style is suppose to be a category that I would basically describe as...lagered ales. Top fermented ales that are cold conditioned/stored. I think it is a category any home/craft brewer could have a fun and creative craft with. That said, ""Rise to the Top"" by the Third Street Brewhouse should be a basis for a continuation of exploring this style; but not an end result. I only have Blatz Light Cream Ale and Little King's for comparison - and they are very distant memories - and Blatz is STILL winning the memory! Course, I'm not a wheat beer fan either - so I'd give this a try if you are looking for something different. And ANYONE having a copycat recipe for Blatz Light Cream Ale - pop it to me, will ya!"
""
"Final Thoughts: Pleased with this one. Took a chance with purchasing such a 'light' beer but it was worth it. A good example of the style. I will be checking out 3rd Street's other offerings. Would I drink it again? Sure, probably in the summer though as it is currently below freezing outside."
""
"It's light and pleasant, as a cream ale should be. Rating for the style, its good, but not much better than the cheaper genesee(sp?) cream ale. Probably tastes a bit better tho."

"Overall - Until New Glarus decides to bring Spotted Cow to Minnesota (unlikely), this is probably the best thing we're going to get. It's got a couple of minor kinks, but it's easy to recommend this beer due to it's drinkability and simple flavor. SInce this is my first beer from Third Street Brewhouse, I'm looking forward to trying out more of their brews which the have to offer."
"O: I'll buy this again, it's good and I love finding a good Minnesota beer."
"O-Nothing overly complex but for a cream ale this is well done. Much, much better than Spotted Cow if you want to draw comparisons. Thought this was a little better on draft but still a decent beer out of the bottle."

"O- It's a pretty good beer. I'm not usually a fan of cream ales, but this one was pretty good."
""
"O- super cream ale that a nice smooth taste highly session able good stuff"
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad, esp. for a summer ale"
""
"Yup, tastes like a well-made cream ale. Which is odd, because I wonder how many people go out in search of cream ales. Any ways, it's crisp and light, with a mellow bready, almost yeasty malt character that's somewhere in the neighborhood of dough and fresh-baked break. There's a macro-like touch, as is appropriate, with the sweet, dry finish. This is a fine example of the style, and a likely summer crowd-pleaser."
"Overall: A pretty decent brew for the style. Very subtle flavors but whats there is nice."
"Another light style to try in this hot summer. I get corn in both the smell and taste, but the label and website both don't mention any corn. It's a nice easy drinker and hits the spot on a hot day."

"Overall: Well, it is better than Spotted Cow, which is the most massively overhyped beer I can think of among the more mainstream beer drinkers. Easy drinking and I guess it is a strong example of the style, but not my thing."
""
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is one inch of bright white foam that recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is bread, and tangy wheat. It is on the lighter side, but fits that style nicely. The taste is similar to the aroma, but considerably stronger. The aftertaste is full of nice round malty flavors that really make the thought of taking another sip sound appealing. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a really nice cream ale that I can see myself drinking again."
""
"I'm pretty impressed. If one is looking for big and complex this isn't it, but for a mild beer this offers very satisfying flavors."
"Not the most exciting style but on a hot day, these go down so nicely. Maybe this will be Minnesota's Spotted Cow as it is on par with Wisconsin's favorite."
