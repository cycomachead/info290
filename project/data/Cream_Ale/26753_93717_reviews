"Flaxen colored with quite a bit of head.  Smells sweet and bready. Taste is a mild sweetness with a good amount of carbonation from start to finish.  Mouthful is light with a very slight hoppy finish.  A very smooth beer and easily drinkable."

"Made me have a gag reflex .. I am staying away from this one"
"Overall:  This beer serves a certain market segment and I imagine it is popular with those who don't want much flavor or bite"

"Overall: I really would recommend this beer if you like lighter beers that have a good amount of flavor without being overwhelming on bitterness or sweetness. This is a nice light beer that sacrifices neither hop nor grain flavor in its overall construction. I am very pleased that I bought this and I will be picking some more up!"

"Deep yellow in color with a hint of orange and a touch of haze. Poured with a thick, fizzy foam that reduced to a wispy cap. Bready malt and corn aromas. Aggressive, yet soft, carbonation uo front that quickly thinned to thin watery feel. Bready and caramel malt flavors up front followed by a tangy, herbal hop bite. Flavors turn bready and quickly fade to the end.  Finishes thin and watery with a bready and herbal hop aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and light.  Nothing special, but a good enough session beer."
"A big thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of toasty malts. Taste is malts, vanilla, some cream, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a smooth and highly sessionable beer."

"Smells like metal but tastes great on a hot summer day. Lots of flavor, low ABV. Session!"

"I followed the illustrated directions to the letter and the Crack! echoed back almost one hundred years, rewarding me with a brimful CAN. My enjoyment begins with an inverted Glug, which in turn created two fizzy fingers of bone-white head with limited retention following a brief pseudo-cascade. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 – 5). Nose was VERY evocative of its predecessors in that it had a metallic odor to accompany a sweet corn smell. Ha! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full. It tasted MUCH better than it smelled, with notes of biscuit malt, corn and unfermented sugars. I was immediately put in mind of corn bread! I was transported to Boas Creek, where we used to go fishing and take CANs of Genny Cream Ale to cool in the water. It was one of my favorite underage beers and this was very evocative of it. Finish was semi-sweet, easy drinking and a definite Summer cooler stuffer."

"O- very simple and easy drinking with a nice subtle creamy sweetness"

"Poured a medium golden color with short-lived fizzy white head. The gives up pretty quickly except around the circumference of the Perfect Pint glass. The aroma is mild, with initial notes of cut grass, grain, and a light hint of vanilla. The taste is equally mild, with mostly light bread and slight earthy quality. It lives up to its name and has a nice creamy feel to the body with a mild bite on the finish. All in all, a good, lighter flavored beer that you can have more than a couple of."
""
"O: Not really much to write home about -- first HP product and not too confidence inducing but will move ahead and try a couple more this week."

"I am not sure being that old for a cream ale is making a difference, but while enjoyable there is not a lot going on, compared to other creams I've had."

"Atmosphere is okay. Light, really nice head, and some fair lacing. Nose is very subtle with a bit of a soapy character. Bready with very light hops and citrus. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
"Overall very light and refreshing if your looking for a thirst quencher this is your beer. When I first saw this green can with t eh words ""Cream Ale", I had a throw back to years ago when everyone in Northern Pennsylvania was drinking Genny Cream Ale. Thank god this was a lot better."
""
"Pours a slight brownish gold. Sweet nose. Quite a sweet profile on the flavor. Heavy malts it seems like. Much heavier than I would hope for, but frankly for this style, it seems about what people are putting out. A nice and easy drinker. Nothing earth shattering, but nothing to complain about either really."

"O- For the style, this one is rather enjoyable. You know what to expect going in and this one delivers."

"O: Overall light and refreshing. The low amount of bitterness adds some interest, but not a lot of pizazz. Still overall a great beer for the beach, or after a long day in the hot sun."
""
""

"Wow, I don't know if I've ever seen my glass empty this quickly before. This is up there with Schlenkerla Helles as one of the most easily drinkable beers I've had. Again, this beer isn't going to blow your mind. But that's not its intention. I threw this back during a family barbecue and it was the perfect choice. Very nice cream ale."
""
"O: I'd reckon this is everything I could want in a good cream ale. I'm even regretting not picking up more than a single can."
""

"Overall: It's somewhat difficult to find a really good, flavorful craft beer that is light enough in ABV and body to be a session beer. Hardywood Cream Ale is it. Really enjoyable warmer weather drinker, this one packs some nice flavors and doesn't weight you down while working on quenching a thirst with a few ""cold ones"". I'll be getting more of these. As it says on the can ""Brewed in Richmond - Where Beer in a Can All Began""."
"O - Cream ale is probably not a style I'd see myself visiting often, but Hardywood's example is quite satisfying. It's easy drinking for sure and packs a good bit of flavor for the ABV. However, the coolest thing might be the can design, which gives a nod to the cream ale from Krueger Brewing Company, the first canned beer ever to be sold - with the dominating green theme, simplistic appearance, and even can opening instructions... so cool!"
""
""
"O: It's quite a refreshing drink and a marvelous cream ale for summertime. This definitely will be going into my arsenal of ""go-to"" beer for beach. I'm not crazy about cream ale but Hardywood did a great job with this one!"
