3.5,8.7,3.75,3,3.75,3.5,3.5,"135 calories per bottle at 4.5% ABV. Unique Cream Style Ale with a light lager taste. The immediate taste is reminiscent of has cream beer taste with a slight compliment of lemon. The aftertaste is a bit below average and the smell is undesirable. Worth a try but not something I would go out-of my way to find.","json83","Jun 29, 2013"

3.15,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Bottle says ""malt beverage with natural flavors added"". According to their website, there is no mention of fruit or spices or anything other than grains, hops, water and yeast involved. No freshness dating either. Pours to a thin but lasting white head with erratic lacing. Color is pale straw, almost like Bud Light. Aroma is grainy and biscuity with a slight butter tinge to it. Flavor is bland and weak but pleasant enough, just merely better than a light macro lager. Finishes super dry and slightly parching. Mouthfeel is so-so. Overall, I would classify this beer as a very weak but drinkable summer lawnmower brew. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just boring light ale and to be honest, I'd be very pleased to homebrew something this light and refreshing and technically pure. Honestly, I'd take a Schlafly Kolsch or Boulevard Wheat over this in half a heartbeat though.","EagleTalon","May 06, 2013"

3.32,3.1,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Tail or no, I could never get my kites to fly all that long. Man, I had a kinda sad childhood... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, sweet oats (not unlike a sweetened version of Cheerios or some other cereal), and a hint of grass. The taste basically brings in more of the same, along with a vague fruitiness that detracts from the sweet, grainy notes that have been forced into the background. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly drying finish. Overall, a generally solid beer, but one whose surprise and oddball fruitiness keeps it from achieving anything close to greatness.","TMoney2591","0"

The aroma consisted of cereal grains and sweet fruit. Light in body, this cream ale had a base of grains, some caramel, fresh fruit, and earthy hops. Smooth mouthfeel, nice summer beer- flavorful example of the style.","GossageBrewery","Sep 16, 2012"

It is an ok beer beer for a hot day, but it is missing some of the flavor and body that others in this style have. Not a bad beer, but there are several others in this style I would go to first.","tigg924","Aug 05, 2012"

Smells of strong pale malt, hint of hop, hint of cream, and a hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of cream, pale malt, hint of rice?, and a hint of hop. Overall, weak body and the aroma is lacking.","Tone","Aug 02, 2012"
