"Loved this beer. Light and refreshing, perfect for sipping on the beach. Trying to find this in Oregon."

"I did a tasting in Panama and everybody loved this one"

"Tastes like a dry cream soda with a bit of bitterness. Fuller bodied than a cream soda which would make this a nice choice when you want to fill that itch."

"The vanilla cream notes are prevalent. This Isn't very light tasting refreshing beer."

"This is a good beer give it a shot."
"Aroma is a little off-putting but the taste is a little better.  Still pretty average and unremarkable."

"Enjoyed pretty close to room temp. Probably not the best idea. This beer is undeniably very smooth and creamy.  Smell and taste wise, it was very light, and left more to be desired. Would recommend giving it a try, but as of my first impression, it's certainly not going to become one of my staples."
"VERY creamy. Tastes way better than it smells...."
"Steady, even flavor. Tastes exactly like it should and as I hoped it would.  Has nice soap sudsy head and mild hint of vanilla.  Goes down easy and I don't mind it as a session beer. I really like it and so do the ladies who have sampled it."

"Pretty smooth day time beer. Nice clear golden pour and a hint of vanilla to set a palate right."

"Vanilla is the main flavor and finished nicely, solid if your a cream ale enthusiast."

"Smooth and refreshing with just the right amount of vanilla on the back side."

"Dark gold pour, hint of vanilla at the end of the sip. I was afraid the vanilla would be overpowering, but it isn't. Definite recommend."

"This is quite tasty if you are into cream soda, which I am. Very well-balanced. Light to medium bodied. Delicious, and something a little different for warmer whether beyond the session IPAs, wheat beers, etc."

"Overall - Great beer. If you like a sweet beer then try this out."

"I tried this because it seems to be a popular item where I work and I've heard good things about Mother Earth Brew Co. It pours a nice light orange color with a modest head. The smell is mild and pleasant. The initial aroma is faint vanilla that gives way to an earthy smell I can't really define. The taste is heavy on the malt with a subtle--yet noticeable--vanilla flavor. The taste finishes off with a distinct bready characteristic. The breadiness in the aftertaste is unique, but I can't really put my finger on what it is. Overall, this is a solid, refreshing beer that tastes a lot like cream soda. A perfect beer for a hot day, or if you need a break from some of more robust ales out there. (in fact, I bought this cause all I had was Mission's Dark Seas Imperial Stout, but didn't want anything heavy)."

"Overall: I wish the vanilla and cream were more pronounced, especially on the nose. The smell is very earthy and grassy, and unexpected for a vanilla cream ale. This is an extremely malty brew, almost cloyingly sweet. While not a ""WOW"" brew, it was enjoyable and I would drink again, especially due to its easy availability."

"Pours a clear light orange with a foamy white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Thick swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, vanilla, the candy stick that comes in a Fun Dip, and slight grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with vanilla and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an interesting but fairly strong vanilla presence all around."

"Poured a beautiful deep orange/amber with a thin ring of whit head. It looks pretty good, not at all like any form of adjunct lager. Scent is very sweet, with heavy notes of cream, maize and sweet malt. It's a simple, yet pleasant scent, like a cream soda, or vanilla soda. Flavor follows the nose, very sweet. Heavy sweet cream flavors and vanilla, laid over a solid backbone of sweet malt and maybe some maize adjuncts, with a moderate level of floral and earthy hops that balance the sweetness. The end of the sip and the aftertaste are slightly bitter, especially for the beer's 21 IBUs. It's unique, has a nice combination of sweet and bitter and the vanilla notes are excellent. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It drinks smooth and creamy, as it should. Quite an excellent mouthfeel. I like this beer a lot. It has a nice flavor, that's sweet without being cloying and balances in some bitterness. It has a pleasant vanilla heavy scent and an excellent medium bodied creamy mouthfeel. I'd drink this one again."
"cheers!"

"Overall a tasty session ale. Not sure on the price, but if it comes in around $5 for a bomber, then well worth the price - otherwise not really worth it. Weird time of year to release this one in the bottle...definitely more of a Spring/Summertime all-day drinker, especially at 5.2% ABV."
"From the 22 oz bottle bought at Best Damn for $6.50. Label printed on."
