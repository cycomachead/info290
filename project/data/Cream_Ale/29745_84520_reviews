"Thanks to the incredible woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet, malty. Taste is of malts, clean, refreshing, a touch of rye. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, as advertised, is a fine lawnmower beer."

"The Crack! unleashed a fair amount of foam, so I backed off and allowed things to settle just a bit before proceeding. It was certainly a brimful CAN, but I was unsure that volume was the root cause and so I went with a gentle pour. This was the right idea as mounds of pillow, bone-white head immediately formed and threatened to overmount the edge of the glass. I was left with just over a finger of rocky, bone-white head as a result. Color was a murky lemonade-yellow (SRM = 3.7). Nose had a grassiness to it that made me look up the hops varieties being used. Bravo was the aroma hop, but I was curious to see what Apollo was going to do to the taste. The mouthfeel was quite effervescent, paving the way for the riot of flavors to come: citrus, tropical fruit, black pepper and freshly-mown grass all came to mind. This was NOT the cream ale of my misspent youth, lemme tell ya! Great lacing began to form and cling to the interior of my glass as I pondered this beer. The finish was semi-dry with the rye providing a lingering black pepper taste that stuck in the back of my throat. Color me impressed! If this truly fits the definition of a session beer, then I would highly recommend loading up with some for the upcoming summer. If not, then CANsume at will, but know that it is a very different iteration of the style."
"what makes this a ""cream ale""? i have no idea, but i can see why so many people are loving this brew. it's simple, easy-drinking and good."

"Body is light, high carbonation, super easy drinking. This is an excellent example of a creme ale and deserves a very high score. Done."

"Overall, this is a good everyday beer and it seems ideal for warm weather consumption. The refreshing character and more easy- going nature make it a good choice for a warm summer day. It isn't like other cream ales, but that might actually be a good thing as I cannot think of many cream ales that I like very much. Cheers!"

"Taste shows honeyed grains leading the charge with some fruity yeast undertones. Hops are light on flavor and aroma but definitely have a touch of bittering to clean things up on the back end. Mouthfeel is well done, it has a sweet side but is certainly not cloying and finishes dry enough. Carbonation level is good. I think this is a pretty dang good rendition of the style - problem is there is not much competition for it. Ive yet to have a Spotted Cow, Id put it above Genessee and Little Kings by a mile, buy a notch below AV Summer Solstice."

"The beer pours a slightly dirty, hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma has a some strong banana notes, as well as some cream and wheat notes. The flavor is very similar. I get some sweet malt and a lot of banana and wheat, a handful of flavors that donâ€™t really go well together. Overall, the beer tastes like a mess. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. Not good, hopefully the brewery will improve as they get more experience."
