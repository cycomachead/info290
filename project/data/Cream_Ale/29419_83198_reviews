"Overall this is one of my new favorite beers. I have gotten a few growlers of it already and plan on keeping it on hand at all times. Newburgh BC is doing some good things down on the waterfront!"
"A few gulps in, very impressive. The balance and dryness builds up the drinkability. Wheat and oat add the element of creaminess and a bit of depth on the way down. A smaller brew but being all malt it was great to see a very liberal hand for hopping here. Cheers to Newburgh for helping redefine this style. 16oz tall boys would be a treat if they get into canning."
