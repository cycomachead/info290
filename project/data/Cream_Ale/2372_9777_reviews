"This beer got me into the world of craft beers. Always have a soft spot for it."

"O: Great beer to transition a non craft drinker into the realm of great beer. It is all that an American lager should be but usually isn't. Great beer for what it is."
""
""
"About as good of a cream ale as you can get imo"
""
""
""
"Great beer! Too bad it's only sold in Georgia... Smooth through and through, and it has a really nice balance of hops. I'm not the biggest hops-lover out there, so I'm definitely biased towards this creamy ale."

"Overall:  it's a pretty standard cream ale, if a bit sweet and a little heavy-handed on the corn flavor.  Still, pretty drinkable."

"Smooth taste, only sold in GA"

"This offering pours up a pale hazy gold with a one finger white head, not much retention, and not much lacing. Smell is fruity. Taste is kind of apples up front follwed by a dry, yeasty finish. Mouthfeel is inoffensive but nothing special either. This would be a very easy beer for someone who is not used to craft beer. It is fairly weak with no prominent hop profile and a mild taste that neither delights not offends."

"Pours a hazy, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of wheat, hops, slight sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of cream, and hint of pine. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of metallic, hint of hops, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, better aroma than body or blend."

"Overall, a pretty middle of the road beer but good for the style. One I would pick up on occasion if it were available near me."
"O: creamy refreshing brew, light and easy drinking"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Very easy to drink and definitely sessionable - the best aspect of this beer is the mouthfeel."
"O: This beer tastes similar to an American Blonde Ale but has a creamier mouthfeel."

"It pours a pretty solid gold color, more golden than a typical ale,slightly above average looking. It has a thin head, which dissipates quickly. The smell was kind of weak, maybe my olfactory is off. The taste is that of a typical summer ale of decent quality, but has a kick of light citrus, creamy, highly drinkable on a summer day, or any time really. Mouthfeel is smooth, not a lot of texture but if you want a refreshing beer that isn't a crappy light beer, this is a decent pick."
""
""

"O- Being that most of the cream ales I've had have been trash, this one is pretty good, but still nothing to write home about. Certainly better than your average macro."

"Excellent Ale! It is very refreshing as the bottle says! It has smell of grain and hops something not really used to smelling with a normal Ale of its style if you know what I mean. Anyway it has an excellent taste beautiful balance of malts and hops making the mouthfeel smooth and creamy with a grand finish!"

"I tried this beer on a beach trip to panama city. Being from georgia I had to try it. The look of this bite was interesting so I gave it a shot. Just like the name the color was golden with good head. The taste was good and rich and the feel was thick like a beer should be."
""
""
""
""
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, not filling, mild kick, nice representation of style. On my most recent trip to GA, this became my go to after work beer as I was prepping for the next day. Easy drinking and this would definitely go in to my ""go to, poundable"" beer categories."

"Enjoyed while at the brewery in Athens, ga. Single finger frothy head on a clear and Golden body. Wheat and bread aroma mostly. High carbonation and medium body, refreshing. Touch of noble like hops greater than expected for a cream ale. Very drinkable but more on the pilsner side than cream ale side which is fine with me as cream ales are not my favorite genre."

"O- A nice beer to have on a hot summer day while grilling, but nothing really stands out with this beer. An average brew."
"O: This one is a step up from BMCs, but barely in my opinion. It would be easy to put a 6 pack down rather quickly, but it's overall flavor and characteristics are easy to forget. I probably would get again for tail gating or bbq on a hot summer day, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Overall - It's the kind of beer you take outside with you on a hot day. It's very refreshing and when serving that purpose, it's quite good. As a session beer, Golden Ale is quite nice, but it's not something I'll reach for when I'm wanting to truly taste beer. There are just not enough flavors present. But I'd toss a 6 pack into a bucket of ice and take to the lake without thinking twice."
"D - A decent beer for a hot summer day. Not what I prefer, but when you have to have a brew that the masses will enjoy, this is your beer."
"Though this isn’t my favorite style, it’s a good example. It is incredibly easy drinking, and I liked it more the more I drank it."
"Had this with two friends and we all agreed that this beer was a little odd. It was the first beer i ever had from Terrapin and I was nervous to try more for fear that it may end up being like this for all their beers. The label said Golden Ale so I was expecting something like a Belgian style and when I found out this was a Cream Ale it was clear as to why it was different than I expected. Even after knowing what it was supposed to be I wasn't overly impressed."
"D - A nice session beer, but just not for me."
"D- Very easy to drink. Nicely balanced. Good summertime beer. Light and refreshing."
"Has a brilliant golden color with a little haze to it. The head is pretty abundant for a bottled beer and has a clean white color. The smell is quite hoppy and refreshing. The taste is also extremely clean and refreshing with a subtle hoppy finish. Notes of fruit appear on every level of smell, taste and finish. Drinkability is exceptional."
"D- As far as drinkability goes, I could easily drink a whole 6'er in a sitting. It is pretty sessionable. Do I enjoy the flavors, not so much, but it is an easy drinking beer."
"D: This is a great session brew; tasty, unoffensive, and light on the stomach."
"light to mid body beer. good carbonation. refreshing beer. glad i picked it up."
"Very drinkable with a very approachable character, carbonation is perfect which leaves a very refreshing crispness behind. The beer geeks will certainly say that it is middle of the road or pedestrian, sure, but we need beers like this out there because not everyone is going to want to drink a beer with 120 IBUs, 13% ABV and aged in an oak barrel for six months. Odd, we know, but true."
"Light all around."
"D - This is a good refreshing beer thats helping beat this Georgia summer heat right now worth picking up to try"
"Very drinkable, could have a few of these on a long hot summer day, just like today."
"Pours a clean golden yellow color with a white head. A sweet malt and hints of fruit in the aroma. A sweet to clean maltiness, with a hint of fruit in the taste. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small fruitiness in the aftertaste. A nice ale with small hints of fruit, quite clean and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly tart, with zippy carbonation."
"Nice mild aromas of light grains and fresh hay. There's a bit of a creamed corn element I don't love, but pleasant enoughoverall. The flavors start out matching up with the nose, but a nice toasty element creeps in, and there's a quick nip of citrus at the finish. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Finishes pretty cleanly, leaving behind perhaps a tad too much sweetness for the style."
"Drinkability: Really no reason to not drink this all day - would be a great beer for the summer if you're working outside or at a BBQ and will be outside all day. ABV is very manageable and this would be a great session beer."
"A decent intro/cross-over beer for macro drinkers. Not enough here for a BA lawnmower beer."
"D – Too sweet for me, though it probably pairs well."
"Not a lot of head, not a lot of lacing. A very pleasant feel to the beer. The alcohol doesn't get angry if lounging in your mouth for a few seconds."
"Fairly easy to drink, not exactly the best example of the style, but not unpleasant."
"D - The bottle hit the nail on the head about being a drinkable beer for when you are active...this is a very easy to drink beer especially if it would be warm outside...the flavors struck me of a pilsner and never became overly complex"
"All in all, quite drinkable. It won't knock your socks off, but I enjoyed it."
"Though not my favorite offering by Terrapin this is definitely a good lawnmower beer."
"Overall, a solid beer, but nothing spectacular. I doubt I would buy this one if it was available to me, as I enjoyed Terrapin's other offerings much more. Thanks for the chance to try this one, Ben!"
"Overall: Honestly, this is my least favorite offering from the Terrapin brewer. It is their stock lawnmower beer, a beer that American's could like. But they hit the nail on the head when it comes to the chosen style, and the quality of ingredients is obvious."
"Thanks to Keith for sharing. I often say beers have bready flavor, but this tasted like straight-up fresh sourdough and white bread. It drank smooth with just a light malt tang. Some golden beers are blandly drinkable, but this beer provides both lighty toasted malt flavors in addition to being highly sessionable. Worth a try in you like golden ales and cream ales."
"Ya gotta throw a lighter session beer out there if your arsenal includes the big hoppy monster, rye squared and imperial stout. This beer tastes good for what it's intended for; a nice light refreshing beer which a nice balanced taste. This is the kind of beer you can give a friend or family member who isn't quite as adventurous a beer drinker. The beer pours golden in color with an average head and aroma since it's not hopped to the tits. The mouthfeel is where it should be for a golden ale; effervescent but not too bubbly - on the lighter side of medium bodied. A nice well balanced golden ale which can be used as a first start for a night of sampling other Terrapin beers. Think of it as a Bobby Weir opener (Stranger possibly?) in the first set, just priming the pumps for a killer show. You'll know after 2 or 3 of these you'll be in for a long long crazy crazy night after you step it up to the hoppy monster, stout or rye squared. Good stuff from Terrapin - the Golden ale comes across as advertised."
"Very sessionable and easy drinking I'd say. Doubt I'll go out of my way to have another, but I'd take it over a macro brew anytime. Knowing the quality of most of Terrapin's other offerings (and the comments on the bottle lol), I imagine this is exactly what they were shooting for when they created it."
"Pale yellow color, medium head. Head dissipates quickly. Slightly cloudy. Smells of sweet malt. Not much if any hop aroma. Maybe some corn. Clean tasting, sweet. Some citrus. Very light bitterness at the end. Crisp, clean, medium body. High carbonation. Goes down easy. A very refreshing beer."
"Pours a foggy yellow gold. Nice creme head. This beer seems a bit sweet to me. Not sweet like a fruit beer, but sweet and grainy slightly. Quite malty. Caramel tones are there too. Feel is a bit thicker on liquid. Might be a bit too sweet for some, but it is good enough for me."
"D: Not remarkably tasteful, but seems like a great session beer with a good amount of malt sweetness"
"Yellow straw, with a white head. A few sniffs of this prove rather unremarkable - sweet corn and wheat aroma with some light hops also apparent. Flavor matches smell - faint orange and lemon character. Mouthfeel is pretty good - smooth, full body for a lighter beer, with ample, but not excessive carbonation. This beer is not bad, but falls into (the upper end of) that standard Golden Ale category, intended to offer a conservative, play-it-safe alternative to BMC beer."
"Is a straw hazy yellow color. The smell is of grains and barely with a little sweetness at the back. The taste is sweet grains with a little malt. There is also a some citrus hop flavor at the end to make it slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. The drinkability is good, you could drink a good amount and drink it over and over."
"Overall, not bad... and quite drinkable. However, it's not particularly memorable. Probably my least favorite beer of Terrapin's otherwise spectacular line-up."
"3.5 D: Somewhat boring, but goes down well."
"It's not a particularly good beer but it's not really offensive so it would be easy to throw back several. It has something like a corn syrup taste that bothers me."
"Poured a nice bright gold color with a pale white head. Nose has notes of sweet corn, a subtle herbal hop profile and malts. Taste has a definite sweetness to it. It has a crispness, hoppiness to it. Unlike a cream ale if you can actually call it that. Very drinkable but for the style its a bomb but for a great tasting brew its a good one."
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer for a craft brewery to put out. It could function both as ""training wheel"" beer for people just getting into beter beer, or a sessional beer for someone who enjoys well made beer. Overall its worth a try or two."
"It's easy to put a few of these away."
"Overall, probably would not bother with this one again. If it came down to a BMC product or this, obviously this would be my choice. There is just enough in this beer to put it a step above."
"D- Enjoyable to drink, would buy more. I love terrapin and enjoy visiting their brewery"
"Mild peppery light grainy citrus. Light and refreshing Golden Ale is perfectly carbonated. Far from the perfect session beer but pleasant drinking nonetheless."
"So, bottom line, this really ain't as bad as all that."
"Overall it's a pretty damned drinkable beer. I've had beers like this before, and after one or two they start to become a little stickier in the mouth than I like, but I think there may be just enough balance here to keep it going. Nice."
"D= Great. The smell was quite the turn off but the taste is nothing bad at all and quite smooth and relaxing actually. Great beer!"
"i was hoping more out of this terrapin brew, i've had it a ton of these over the years as terrapin is one of the few constant craft brews always available here in georgia but this is probably my least favorite of their beers, but when it's 95 degrees outside this beer is a thirst quencher for sure."
"Unremarkable. Terrapin makes some excellent beers, but this one didn't excite me."
"Decent beer, nothing too amazing but its a very drinkable beer and that is probably what Terrapin was going for..."
"Drinkability: Probably Terrain's worst beer, though at 5.0% and given its price and availability at many bars in Atlanta/Athens, I can't knock the drinkability too much. It's light, inoffensive, relatively easygoing, and actually sort of flavorful - though the flavors really aren't my cup of tea (beer). Worth trying, and better than many alternatives at many shitty dives in Georgia, so keep an eye out for it if you're ever in those situations."
"M + D: Medium carbonation, but about right for the overall feel. A little prickly, but not too much of a sting. A light, residual feeling leaves a note of flavour behind. I find myself leaning towards Terrapin's more 'extreme' or experimental stuff, but this is fairly solid and drinkable."
"Clear, uncloudy, not a whole lot of head at all. A very light, refreshing beer. Has a bit of a Grolsch-like skunkiness going on. A decent lawn-mower, poolside beer. Did the job while I was in the sun by the pool. Not a whole lot of flavor here, or much to bring you back to it. Nothing more."
"Thanks to UGADawgGug for the opportunity!"
"Overall- Very good, sessionable."
"This is a good cream ale and the most approachable beer that Terrapin makes for non-craft beer folks. Still, it's my least favorite of their year-rounds."
"Pours out a pale yellow color with light orange tint to it, egg shell white head with good lacing. Smells slightly hoppy, cascade, with tinge of citrus. Mediocre nose not much going on. Taste is on the lighter side, slight hoppy bittnerness maybe citrus not much going on. Cream ales are not really my favorite style that's for sure, but this is a pretty decent attempt at one, slightly hop-centric cream ale, with an odd bitterness that combats the German malt finish. Maybe a little too carbonate to be super drinkable, but a good brew that for the style isn't too bad."
"Pours a very clear golden colored body with a small creamy white head. Very dusty pilsner malty aroma. Nuttiness too. Grainy wheaty taste. Musty dustiness. Some nuttiness. Okay, refreshing. Not my style."
"Pours a hazy straw gold color with a big bone white head. Smells of malt, banana, light fruit, some yeast, and some bread. Flavor is similar to the aroma with noticeable hops and yeast. Not bad, similar to a tripel in some aspects. Very sessionable beer."
"When I first saw this beer I thought it was from Maryland. Much to my surprise it's a Georgia brew...Bottle smell is kind of skunky, pours to a bright yellow with not much head at all. Taste is steady flat bitter hops with malty sweet middle and a sugary sweet finish. A little more hoppy than a typical cream ale but that's a good thing. Mouthfeel is alright and carbonation is on the mark. I would guess this is a kind of beer that would be much better on draught. Not a bad brew but I wouldn't pay a premium for this over Genny Screamers."
"Crystal clear light gold colour with a frothy, bright white cap. Lots of lacing and fair head retention. Aromas of sweet malts, cereal grains, and a hint of fruity esters. Pretty mild though. The flavour was kind of nice, more sweet malts and mild fruitiness (just a bit of strawberry) with a mild bitterness that was present throughout. For a cream ale, it's quite nice. The body was on the light side, carbonation average. Mild dryness. No complaints here. It's a very nice looking beer that's pretty refreshing."
"This is easy as hell to drink but I don't really get a reason to go back to this beer, even within the terrapin lineup."
"M/D - medium bodied, and overall not a bad brew, but Terrapin makes such good beers, i'd be hard pressed to pick this one up when their other stuff is sitting next to it on the shelf"
"Best by 3rd week of Jan 09, should be ok. Pours a slightly hazy light amber with zero head retention or lacing. Not great. Smell: mildly sweet malts, vague green apple and spicy hops. Taste: apple and lemon notes, background grassy, grainy hops, a bit of metallic creamed corniness. Hmm, it's well carbonated but the feel doesn't really scream cream ale. Refreshing, but that's about it."
"D - A simple brew to be sure, but better than other cream ales I've had. I doubt I'll get this again, but for certain people this could be a great session beer and for others an almost perfect gateway beer."
"overall this is a good beer and i enjoyed it alot"
"Hmm, it's never easy to review certain beers. I feel that this is more of a golden ale than a cream ale. Nevertheless, it's light, easy to drink and straightforward. That alone is good enough to earn it respect in my book. I can always use a beer like this and for that, I'm going to give it the due it deserves."
"This is a good for style."
"D. Pretty standard fare here. A decent ""light"" beer in my opinion. For a cream ale, this doesn't stick apart from a Gennessee."
"Appears a pale straw golden clear offering with a bright white head forming above the body, lacing is scarce and uneven as it dwindles. Aromatics tart creamed corned accent with a touch of green apple and sturdy malt bill flowing wth finesse. Flavor has a cereal mix of creamy corn and sweet two row pale malts, a barely noticeable herbal hop mix equates to a mediocre form of the brew known as Terrapin. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied where as the rest of their brews are rather heavy hitters, I'd much rather have this than a BMC brew but that doesn't say much, nice opening brew. Drinkability is nice a refreshing mix of malts hops and adjuncts as a cream ale this brew serves it's purpose, with some hop burps between sips."
"D - This is an amazing light beer. I can't wait to try more Terrapin."
"Drinkability: A nice overall beer, though somewhat bland."
"A nice cream ale. Don't drink enough of these. Aroma was so so. LIght malt, sugar and a hint of lemon. Pour was a nice light gold with a 2 finger white head that left quickly and lots of tiny rising bubbles. Taste was crisp and refreshing. Light malt with some biscuit and just a hint of hops in the aftetaste. Medium carbonation that bites the back of the tongue. Not bad."
"Very drinkable. Would make a good summer picnic beer."
"Drinkability: A decent, easily drinkable beer if ultimately unremarkable."
"A very good tasting Cream Ale thats refreshing and goes down easy."
"Not much of a strong taste... but feels great in the mouth. Light, refreshing, not a sipper, but would make a nice summer beer."
"The smell is nothing to speak of, the taste also leaves much to be desired. The mouthfeel is somewhat crisp. This is an average or so beer is every category, I expect more out of spike and mike as I love most of their other beers."
"The taste is very nice, it's crisp balacned, and a little citrisy at the end of the swallow."
"Overall this is probably in the bottom half of my favorite Terrapin brews, but it's still a solid offering. Worth a shot."
"Easily a good session beer."
"This is a medium-bodied beer with a creamy mouthfeel to it. The start is a little sweet and crisp, the middle is where you catch a little lemon and then a slight hoppy bitterness at the end. The bitterness lingers a little while on the tongue."
"Bottle labeled as Golden Ale. Golden colored, not much head or lacing. Aroma is of sweet fruits, a little grainy and wheaty. Smooth, sweet, citrus fruity flavor with some hops and very refreshing. Light-bodied and clean. Resembles a nice summer wheat beer. Nothing outstanding but I thought it was pretty good."
"Could be drinkable if you like this sort of flavor. But I'm gonna pass."
"A good beer for those summer days. Very malty grainy beer. If you like cream ales, you will probably like this one. Recommended."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a crisp pale and Vienna malt scent. It's a bit sweet with a light hop aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth mildly bitter taste that boasts of pale malts mostly. It goes down easy and finishes crisp and clean. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. I liked this beer despite other not so good reviews. It's balanced and flavorful; an easy drinker."
"M/D - Light bodied and very carbonated. Very drinkable beer."
"Light-medium bodied and refreshing. Superb drinkability."
"D: extremely drinkable...perhaps my new golf course beer. very nice cream ale."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, it's light which makes it a beer that you could pound down several of, but overall I found it to just an ordinary beer."
"I've been on a lighter beer kick lately due to the heat in GA. Not my favorite offering from Terrapin, but it is still a good beer. Great for the summertime cookout or after mowning the lawn."
"D: Cream Ale? Idk, whatever. Not very complex but I could see this quenching my thirst on a hot day."
"D: A shock to see it is a cream ale but it is not bad. Like this beer quite a bit, good session brew."
"Cheers..."
"Not a whole lot to the flavor: some light grassy hops and pale malts with a twang of yeast and medicinal powder. Mouthfeel delivers a crisp and clean body, but surprisingly this beer doesn't live up to its refreshing promise. Golden Ale finishes semi-dry, bubbly, and thin. All in all, this is clearly the most unimpressive brew of Terrapin's otherwise stellar line-up."
"The beer had a nice straw yellow slightly cloudy appearance to it. It had a white light head to it that dissipated at the right pace. The aroma of the beer was light malt with some citrus. The taste was lacking for me. I got the malt with some hints of citrus that provided some sweetness, but it really lacked a lot of flavor. It had some light noticeable carbonation. Overall, the beer was smooth and creamy and very easy to drink with a slight bitter finish at the end. I could probably drink a worse on a hot summer day, so I might reach for this one again, mainly to make sure that the first tasting was not just way off."
"D: Drinkability is good--it's got a decent taste and lighter body that lends itself to some easy quaffing. More flavor is needed for the drinkability score to increase, but this is still a solid beer. Definitely a solid local/regional beer that could be used as a gentle transition into craft beer for a macro-drinker."
"Taste is light malty with pilsner malt notes, light and grainy with some straw-like notes. A light bitterness and a light and balanced hop taste, subtle and harmonious. The yeast appears to be a bit Belgian, with spicy notes and with a hint of solvent."
"Clear light golden pour with a nice firm white head that laces down the glass as you drink. Medium carbonation. Pleasant mild aroma. Malty and slightly sweet with no off tastes. No BIG tastes to mention period. Just easy drinkin'."
"Almost a nice session beer, but a little too heavy. More spring than summer, but a solid brew. More crispness and refreshment would come from a lighter mouthfeel. One of the better Cream Ales out there."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is light to moderate, with a bit of a watery finish. Carbonation is relatively light. The combination is just, well, not exciting to me."
"D: Yes because there isn't any flavour"
"D: This beer is smooth and easy to drink, but is pretty soft overall."
"Pours golden with a bubbly carbonation stream rising up in the pilsner glass. Small white head. Doesn't look like the color in the picture shown at all... Creamy, malty nose. Taste is fairly bland but crisp malt mainly with surprisingly light carbonation and a light somewhat balancing bitterness. Decent for what it is."
"T: Surprisingly thick and creamy, almost too much so. Like the aroma, this is has a very strong grain taste. Slightly sour and fruity. This isn't bad, just not very interesting. The mouthfeel is too heavy in the end for this beer. Overall drinkability isn't bad, but I wouldn't seek this out."
"Drinks very easy, not the best cream ale, but I could see sucking a few down on a steamy summer evening in the South"
"D: Not a bad brew by any means. Also not one that I would actively seek out. As my first cream ale sampling, I am not entirely impressed with the style. Drinkable, yes, but not something that I want to try again."
"Pours a golden yellow, with a decent white head. Not a whole lot of aroma, but what there was smelled pleasantly of malt. Taste was very solid, malt, nuts, a bit of spice, all very mild flavors but nicely balanced. Plenty of carbonation. Intriguing. Made me want to take another sip, and before I knew it the glass was gone."
"As this is the first cream ale that I have tried, perhaps it is a style that I am simply not that fond. This beer is intended to be a light, refreshing, ""warm weather"" brew, so maybe I am doing it a disservice by having one in the middle of winter. All of that being said, there just seems to be something lacking in this one. The semi-sour taste is sort of off-putting and the carbonation is over the top for me. I probably would not have another."
"Overall, not a memorable beer. It seemed somewhat average (or below average )to me. There are certainly worse beers, but there are definitely better."
"Pours a clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, little fizzy white head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, some spices, and slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, good balance of malts/hops, spicy, and some caramel. The finish is slightly bitter. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad of a brew."
"Anyone that likes Rolling Rock should try this; I would like to think they'd never turn back."
"A very drinkable beer and a pretty good representation of a style which I definitely appreciate."
"Bottle courtesy of Unclemattie: Poured a golden color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and medium lacing. Aroma of sweet malt is dominant and somewhat enjoyable. Taste is a mix between sweet malt with some grassy notes. Overall, I thought this was well done but not very complex  a good session brew."
"Thanks again, Aaron!"
"12 oz bottle. Pours a pale gold with a very thin layer of white head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma is sweet with a hint of floral tones. Initial flavor is sweet with a little fruit flavor. Sour aftertaste with little hop character. Light to medium body feel. Drinkable... but why?"
"Final thoughts  Very refreshing brew. I could drink a lot of these."
"Drinkability - a great session beer. These would taste good all night."
"This is a very sessionable beer and great to have on a warm day."
"I drank this beer after mowing the lawn on a very hot Central Florida afternoon. I poured the beer from the bottle into a frosted mug and it made about a one inch head that held pretty well. Excellent aroma, light and crisp taste. Nice after taste. A very drinkable brew, and great for a hot afternoon."
"Had this on draught at the Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL and then later in bottle. Poured nice golden color with decent head that disipated fairly quickly. Aroma is a bit fruity though not real strong. Taste has some light citrus flavors and malt, but is not very strong. Decent warm weather beer, but not anywhere near the quality of their Rye Ale."
"Terrapin Golden Ale pours a golden yellow color with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is very mild, malt and maybe, just maybe a touch of hops. Light bodied, there is just a touch of hops in the flavor, but mostly malt and grain. A touch on the sweet side. Decent, just not exciting."
"D - Overall a pretty drinkable session beer. More or less right on for a cream ale (although I am not sure if that is a compliment). Terrapin can, and usually does, do better."
"A drinkable Golden ale was intended, and drinkable it is indeed."
"D: Amazingly drinkable. Yet again, this ale stands out amongst so many others. In a category that feels like well-worn territory, Terrapin shines. The complexity and balance combined make for a quality quaff. The subtleties of this beer are phenomenal, and the main reason for being rated well is the fact that it asserts itself in a rather mellow category."
"Pours a very light pale golden yellow color with a small white head that quickly disappears. The faint aroma produces a faint grain smell and just a hint of hops. The taste is more grainy malt with a quick faint bite from the spicy hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is light, highly carbonated and fizzy. Overall, this is a rather subpar offering from a very good brewery. I expected a little more flavor in this one, even if the style is not known for being overly flavorful. Considering the high price of this brew, I would stick with the macros rather than this offering if I am in the mood for a light beer."
"Pours a light golden with a decent initial head that fades to a ring.The beer shows a constant stream of bubbles throughout the sample. The smell is light and very grainy and slightly sour-like a boil of spent grain. Reminds me of Anchor's Small Beer. The taste is a little better, light but with some solid flavor. The spent grain taste is still there, but there is also some malt underpinning the flavor and a smidgen of hops. Mouthfeel is refreshing if a not quite as crisp or creamy as it could be. I remember this beer being better a few years ago, but then again I used to drink it on tap. I generally really like Terrapin beers- this is my least favorite."
"This is a great, easy to drink beer. This is my new favorite summer beer. It doesn't try to cram flavor down your throat like Sunset Wheat or others like that, and even though this isn't the same style, I'd much rather have this on a hot summer day. Great brew."
"The moderate body rolls up the tongue with quite a bit of carbonation. Lightly sweet and I suppose a hint on the creamy side - more than the crisp side. Sweetness lingers and turns to a light hoppy finish. This one is not too bad and easily drinkable after coming in after moving a few rocks. Glad I got to try it."
"This beer poured a clear straw color with a nice head (tight bubbles) and decent lacing. The aroma is sour and hoppy. The taste is mild and a bit grainy. The hop flavor is subdued. The mouthfeel is light. Id say this is a refreshing beer that could be quite drinkable."
"Notes: 12 Oz sample via No Name BIF, courtesy of mikesgroove. Cheers!"
"Pours a light straw colored yellow with a razor thin head that quickly diminished into a ring. The aroma is dominated by pale malts, some fresh fruits come through, but not much. The beer tastes of nothing more than pale malts, just very bland. The beer was very light on the palate, but as far as mouthfeel and drinkability, both are ruined by the bland taste."
"A cream ale?!?!? Well as the name implies this was an excellent golden ale. Poured a clear golden pale yellow without a head or significant lacing. There was some very nice visible carbonation though. Smell was light, crisp and clean. Graing and bread like with a small floral aroma mixed in, but very strong. The flavors was fantastic for outdoors on a hot day. Light, crisp, and refreshing. This one will really cool you off. Extremly drinkable, could put these down all night. Overall very nice light, summer brew, that I could enjoy anytime."
"The color is golden and clear. Taste is nice, with fruity undertones and hardly any bitterness. Texture is smooth and simple. This is a beer more for drinking with lunch or dinner, or while watching a sporting event or yapping at a party, than for serious enjoyment; still it is a decent brew. Terrapin has yet to disappoint me."
"A cream ale? Never would have thought this - struck me as a not-too-shabby golden, as the name implied. Flavor profile was very lively and bright, with a hint of some citrus going on in the background. No off or grainy notes, with a smooth finish. Perhaps a bit to the nondescript side, but this would be a pleasure on a hot day."
"the six I bought says golden ale...it's definately not consistant with a cream ale...fruity smell...pineapple....lemon....hue is a hazy light gold/yellow...like a cheap hefe(widmer/hummer). This is not too bad...but it's not too good either. First one goes down smooth but then the aftertaste really builds up...and its' an unpleasant sourness. The initial taste is good though...light....airy...sweet and sour with alot of lemon...very little if any detectable hops....overall this sits right where it should....between excellent craft....and cheap macro...as the price dictates....I paid 7.29 but the RHipa was better and the same price! I'm not sure if I can recommend this to true beer drinkers...I do ,however, recommend the classic city beer fest....which is more or less.... headed by this brewery in Athens."
"Overall, worth a try. A good session beer if the aftertaste doesn't bother you."
"EDIT: I just now read that this is a cream ale and that it typically is much like a light lager. I guess it matches style well, but I'm keeping my ratings."
"August 12, 2009: Thanks jyounger30!"
"Golden Ales, having low malt characteristics need a little more hop character to take the lead. This beer has neither. I could drink a lot of these, but I am not expecting anything too exciting. Terrapin Rye P.A. is where it's at."
"This one doesn't do it for me. Didn't remind me of a cream ale, more of an adjunct lager. Corn taste and nothing too special. Maybe good on a hot sunny day, not a cold October evening. Oh well, still glad Terrapin is here."
"12oz brown bottle with a drink before date of 6/5/07. Pours a deep gold/light amber with a less than 1 finger head and poor lace. Nice sweet malts up front mixed with some corn aromas. A little bit if citrus aroma as well mixed with somwhat spicy hop aroma. This hass got some really nice flavor for a Cream Ale. Nice sweet malts and corn flavors up front with a decent somewhat citric and spicy hop flavor. Full bodied for an cream ale. Smooth and creamy and easy drinking. As the label says its ""a perfect session beer"". and although I don't think it's perfect it is a very nice Cream Ale."
" By no means great, this is a good summer beer with a slightly offbeat taste. If you like cream beer, and I do, it's worth a shot."
"Poured crystal yellow, almost no carbonation, zero head or lace. Sweet corn malt nose, with dominant grassy and grapefruit hop notes. Rounded corn malts in the mouth, a touch of lingering grass, hard water, and hop bitterness in the finish. Almost no flavor in this beer apart from adjunct sweetness and the finish. Medium oily body with prickly slow carbonation. Eh. Why would I want to drink more of this?"
"I wouldn't turn this brew down, but I much prefer their Rye Pale Ale."
"overall it is underwhelming but a decent session beer."
"A well balanced, smooth drinking beer that is well suited to this time of year. A malty but very balanced taste just the right amount of hops to give the palate equilibrium. The finish is amazingly clean as the aftertaste just disappears. This was the first Terrapin product I've tried, but it certainly won't be the last. It was extremely enjoyable and I recommend it."
"Nice golden color with a clear white head that quickly disappeared, no lacing. Herbal aroma, flavor starts out with an off homebrew taste. After a few quaffs this clears out to be a malty full flavor with mild hops to balance. Fairly smooth aftertaste. Pleasant, straight forward ale that is good for summer quaffing but I probably won't have this again until late spring."
"Pours a clear golden color with a descent white head. The aroma is pretty uninteresting, with some grainy malt notes, slight cane sugar sweetness and some light floral hops. The flavor is similar with grainy malt presence, some cane sugar, and herbal hops. The mouthfeel is light and crisp and drinkability is good. A drinkable beer, but unfortunately not an interesting one."
"Poured to a golden yellow, with thin white head that dissipated quickly, and left little lacing. Aroma was hard to place, although I did get faint hints of creamy malt. Taste was likewise hard to distinguish, some malt, some hops, not much of anything. Sorry, but nothing special about this one. Best thing I can say is that I will drink again before many macros, but well after many other beers I have rated."
"Poured a golden straw color. Aroma was totally lager-ish. Smelled like a Dortmund. Nice head about one finger thick, then diminishes leaving a nice white film of foam. The taste was straight lager. A nice froth sweetens the brew but nothing very exciting. The bottle explains their ale/lager combo. I love that Terrapin is a successful brewery in the south and is offering up great brews. This beer is perfect to cool off after mowing but it is not that spectacular. Quaffable, but not my first choice. Cheers."
"Drinkability: I guess this is designed to be a crossover beer; I'm not a big fan of the style and there is nothing in this brew that I find compelling"
"D: Not bad. Not a lot going on."
"I knew that this beer wouldn't come close to ascending the heights that my previous Terrapin Beer Company beers have achieved (TBC's hop fetish dovetails perfectly with my own). It only makes sense that a brewery would need to include a more approachable beer in their lineup in order to appeal to all comers. I'd like Terrapin Cream Ale to come out of its shell a little more, but given the style, it's a pretty good effort. Thanks to timtheenchanta for the toss-in."
"Taste is somewhat strange to me, I must admit I have never had a cream ale before, and don't have much to judge on. It has a pretty good mouthfeel, not too light, or heavy, just about right. The carbonation is good as well. The maltiness is definitely apparent in this beer, with just a marginal amount of hops. If I was to describe this beer I would say, refreshing, which is strange with a name like cream ale. Overall it's not a terrible beer, it's just nothing great."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" white head over the clear light golden brew. Head holds on nicely, with plenty of slow fading lace. Aroma is pale malts, with lightly fruity hops crispness. Taste is similar, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is excellent, as expected for the style. Another nice one from Terrapin."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a nice solid dark straw color with a half finger of white head over top. A healthy cascade of bubbles is boiling up through the moslty clear liquid. Pretty well what I was expecting on all fronts. Aroma is dominated by corn character with a very mild and light grainyness. It's very clean, with just a kiss of herbal hop burried deep in there. Its pretty one dimensional, but as far as I understand, this style is not very aggressive. Flavor is right there with the aroma. Lots of corn flavor, with a small grainy note and a light but noticable herbal hop that really adds a nice dimension to this brew. A very mild and clean bitterness clings to the finish. Mouthfeel is on the light side of moderate with a solid moderate carbonation. It is very unobtrusive and without anything to keep me from finishing this bottle. I'm enjoying this one quite a bit. I think the hopping is really done well on the brew. Less would keep it from being an impact on the flavor and more would definately be too strong. I think this one is a winner."
"It's smooth and a tad creamy. Nothing thrilling. Better than anything you'll find in a gas station around here though."
"The beer ia a light amber color and there was a small head. The smell is similar to a light beer with a bit of sweetness thrown in. The taste is also in the lighter beer style. The taste is of cheap grain but without the general tastelessness of a mass produced beer. It is much smoother and mellowed out. The mouthfeel is overall pretty smooth. There is a lasting light beer type aftertaste. The drinkability is good. I could certainly session this beer. Terrapin has done a good job with this brew."
"This is by far the worst offering from an excellent brewer. I don't think Terrapin brewed this with the beer geek in mind. It's more of a cross-over beer for the BMC drinkers."
"Sampled on 3/23/06, purchased in a mixed six pack at Southern Market in Myrtle Beach. Contract brewed in Frederick, Maryland. Bright gold pour with small wisp of a head and slight on carbonation. Nose is soapy and grassy. Grassiness carries through the flavor and is masking the malty sweetness which is lurking. Crispness arrives in the body and through out the finish to save this beverage from mediocrity. Nice for style."
"This beer pours a golden yellow with a frothy white head that leaves a little film and a little lace. The beer smells like a macro with less rice and corn and more barley. The beer tastes mostly malty, kind of similar to an all malt lager but less smooth. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but a little more watery than is to be desired. Overall, its a good crossover beer but not one that I would pick up again."
"All in all good beer and quite drinkable but not likely to make anyone's 'top ten' list. It's a good beer to drink when you're sitting down to watch a game (if you're not quite in the mood for a light lager) Likely also a good crossover beer for the folk used to drinking fizzy yellow water."
"I must have had a bad bottle of this or perhaps one or more of my senses were ""off"" or not condusive to rating a beer the first time I rated this a few nights ago. I have since had this again. I didn't alter my ratings of A S T M D too much, but it was a little more pleasant experience the second go 'round. The colour didn't change at all, but there was a fluffy white head approximately a finger's thickness which surprisingly remained almost throughout consumption. It had a little different mouthfeel to it; and most notably, there was much more smell and taste present this time. More sweet malt both in smell and taste. This still isn't an amazing beer by any stretch, but I do have kinder words for it after trying it a second time."
"cheers..."
"Pours an almost brilliantly clear, bright gold color. It is topped by a quickly disappearing pale white head. The aroma has notes of sweet corn, a subtle herbal hop profile, and perhaps a touch of toasty malt in the finish. The taste has a definite sweet corn note to it as well. The beer is quite light on the palate and the finish has a nice level of astringent bitterness to it that serves as an offset to the sweet corn note. There is actually a fair amount of bitterness to this beer, and it really does help to keep the sweet grain character in check. This is a nice example of the style, and I could see myself drinking a couple of these on a hot, sweaty Summer day."
"The first sip I had of this I thought it was shit. Then I realized the potential it has, it gives me a good beer to drink after my first couple micros on friday nights. Rather than reverting to Bud Select or Coors Light and wanting to vomit afterwards."
"Pours a crystal clear honey gold, with a single lone carbonation stream meandering to the surface. The head is bright white and crackling, consisting of loosely packed medium sized bubbles, that thins down to a dusting of fine bubbles. The smell is sweet and grainy, very clean with minimal hops. The taste is sweet and the corn is prominent, finishes with a gentle hop note, but not overly distinctive. Light body and a thin mouthfeel, not too much carbonation. Tastes a more like an American Macro lager. Perhaps if it had been a steamy hot summer day, it would have been easier to overlook the shortcomings."
"A smooth tasty beer that does what it aspires to be, just a good non-challenging beer. Very easy to drink and an excellent choice to nudge the macro drinker in your group towards better beer. Not a beer I would seek out but if I was in Atlanta and this was the best thing available next to Heineken I would pick this."
"This is the only ""cream ale"" I have ever tried and I was largely unimpressed. Pour a Budweiser charge $4.75 for it and you have this beer. The smell was largely of macro lager grains. The appearance was a transparent straw yellow with a one inch head. The head reduced down quickly to a film on top of the beer that laced very little. The mouthfeel was good with good carbonation and very fizzy. The taste was typical macro lager grain and adjunct. I did think that drinking three or four at a sitting would be easy enough but why would you want to?"
"This is a very drinkable cream ale. This would be a nice session brew for a summer evening on the deck."
"Tasted: 12/28/05"
"Pass on this offering. Good drinkability but wouldnt drink too many of them. Poor quality."
"Pours a bright golden color with a flourish of a white fizzy head that disappears almost immediately. Appealing aroma of light sweet malt, a bit of adjunct malt, biscuit, honey, and a touch of floral hops. Palate is a bit subdued, with light malt accompanying some mellow hops. An underlying biscuity character provides a bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Highly drinkable, a great session beer."
"A very good cream ale, does what it ought to and does it well."
"Thanks to rajendra82 for the bottle."
"Overall, this is an innovative approach to a cream ale. Very well constructed for the style, but if you don't like cream ales you might want to pass on this one. Somewhat refreshing as a summer ale on a hot day, but not something I would buy again. Try this brewery's Rye Pale Ale for a real treat!"
"A good intro beer for the macro drinker or a micro lover who just wants a lighter beer. The real advantage this beer has over a macro is that it has flavor w/o overdoing it with the corn or presenting any off flavors that most people nearly freeze their macros to get rid of."
"Tastes of sweet pale malt. Lightly fruity and grassy. Corny. Finish of bitter hops, bitter to balance the sweetness. Creamy up front with a crisp finish. Oh boy, is it drinkable. Don't listen to the naysayers, this is a great summer beer (or any season for that matter.)"
"12 ounce bottle. Label says brewed by Frederick Brewing Co in MD. No freshness dating."
"Drinks smooth and leaves my mouth with a bit of a sticky feel to it. I could probably drink quite a few of these at once."
"As the label proclaims, like sunshine in a glass. Never will I have to revert to a macro again."
"Ok, when you think of cream ales you don't really think of much. And the truth is, they aren't really much. Terrapin does, however, take a mediocre (or worse) style and do something interesting with it. Spike is obviously a fan of hops and this beer is no different. Still, while a light, smooth beer like this could quickly become unbalanced by hops, the beer only has just enough to tease you and still keep the beer balanced. More than I expected."
