"Overall, my impression of Wild Night is summed up in the fact that I will continue to drink a lot of it. I have a gallon growler from swamphead and I will be filling it frequently with this."

"O: best cream ale I've ever had."

"On tap at Vello's. Pours yellow with creamy heqd, very light colored on both counts. Sweet honey citrus smell. Flavor is sweet but light malts with a rather dirty, lingering dusty finish. Light body and refreshing as a whole but the finish takes away from it."

"Poured light yellow, probably straw colored. White, scanty head that didn't last too long. A touch of corn and light grains with a hint of metallicness, pears, and grass, but all of this is extremely light. Flavor is very hard to distinguish. Rather bland and not much to the beer. Not offensive, but nothing really standing out either."
"I would say this is a good session beer but I don't even think it falls in those parameters. I would just stick to their Big Nose IPA, and Midnight Oil Stout. That is where the flavor is."
"Overall: These cream ales always taste more lager-like to me. I really have to focus to get the cream part but for what it is, it is done well."
"overall a nice and solid beer, nothing out of the norm though."
"On tap at Cigar City. A little floral honey. Rather plain cream ale, a little Hallertau hops flavour, a bit of honey.Golden colour, a little white head.A tad meady and drinkable on a hot day, like a light mead. I would rather put some New Zealand honey in hot water and skip the carbonation part."
"O-swamp head, i've heard much about them but i'm guessing this isn't their top beer. this is a lawn mower beer, but not a great one. there are no negative tastes but nothing to make it stand out either."
"On-tap at the tasting room. Amber with a finger of white foam. Smell is pale malt, cereal grains, fairly neutral. Taste is grainy, mild hopping, finishing with a sugary honey sweetness. Very slight rindy hopping. It does a pretty good job of featuring the honey, but unfortunately is otherwise boring. Inoffensive and probably useful as a gateway beer; wouldn't expect a cream ale to be particularly exciting anyway."
"D- Dumbed down version of the style... I'd try any other swamphead before this one as I do tend to enjoy their brews"
"drinkability: I tried this at the kickbacks Swamphead dinner among many others. This brewery in new and going in the right direction. Solid beer from a solid brewery. I would love to have this again."
"Catherine's Passion - Russian Imperial Stout infused with organic cocoa nibs and Midnight Oil coffee"
"D-A light easy drinking quality brew. All of the Swamphead beers I feel fit in to this catagory accept the 10-10-10 that guys more of a world beater. But Wild Night keeps its place as a great middle of the road drinking option."
"Overall this beer is extremely easy to drink and extremely refreshing. The sweetness and thin body make this a perfect summer beer."
"Pretty drinkable. Light and refreshing on a hot day, of which there are many in Florida."
"D - A good beach beer, perhaps."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is super high due to the light character of the brew. Overall, I really enjoyed my sample. This would be a great session brew sitting by the pool or at a baseball game. Can't wait to try more swamphead! Skal."
"Pours a rich golden yellow color with a large frothy white head with great retention and lacing all around the glass. The aroma is malt, citrus, honey and a touch of hops. The taste is malt with a faint honey-like sweetness, citrus and a nice touch of hops in the finish balancing out the sweetness very nicely. Glad I finally got to try a beer from this brewery, looking forward to trying more of their lineup."
