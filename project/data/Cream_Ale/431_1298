It's a bit light on the taste and is expectedly light in color and feel but the taste isn't bad at all and is actually quite smooth. When compared to most of the other non-craft offerings I've had, I'll take a Little Kings everyday.","leprechaunandfatman","Dec 21, 2014"
3.07,1,3.25,3,3,3.5,3,"you know, occasionally, and very occasionally, i like to deviate from the craft beer i love so much for a little refresher course about why i spend so much time and money and energy on this passion of mine, and its beer like this that serves that purpose so well. classic cheap cream ale in a cute little package. its got a mild skunk to the nose, but other than that is an extremely passable macro tasting brew, malty enough in a light pils sort of way, and not lacking in flavor at all. it has a little body, wonderfully refreshing carbonation, and a pretty snappy finish, a fine refresher overall. its honestly not very good, but its also not all that bad, especially when judged against its peers. what it doesnt have though is any real hop profile, anything unique or interesting, an appreciable yeast character, or any capacity to hold my attention or inspire me in any way whatsoever. craft beer has and does at least most of those things most of the time, and thats why i love it so much, it makes me think and it makes me move, and im not sure what i would be mentally or physically if this is the kind of beer i drank all the time. i dont hate it, i am actually thankful for it today for reminding me again why i am so into craft beer. this though, is well enough crafted that i just might buy it again someday!","StonedTrippin","Dec 16, 2014"

This brew has an ABV of 5.5 and it pours out a dark amber color. This brew is darker than your American style lager. Little Kings has a small white head that goes away fast. Now keep in mind this beer is in a 7 oz bottle. The smell is strong and bold with flavor. The taste is bold with flavor. I like how this brew is bold with flavor but it goes down crisp and refreshing. Mouth feel is good this brew smooth. Over all I giving this brew a 4 out 5. I'm really impressed with this brew.

After a few sips, I pretty much tasted nothing ... and there was no bitterness. I rate it as highly as I do because it's super sessionable, drinkable, inoffensive, and just really good for any occasion.

The mouthfeel was really the only thing that disappointed me about this beer. Very slight notes of butterscotch in the mouthfeel, Followed by a strong cooked corn Adjunct flavor and a strong almost unfathomable metallic taste on the tongue and in the throat.

Little 7oz bottle poured into pilsner glass pours a straw yellow with a fluffy half inch head. Funky smell of sourdough and corn with a bit of yeast. Taste isn't funky at all for a green glass bottle however it does have a distinctive funky smell which is more akin to an american adjunct lager then a cream ale, but the taste is smooth and clean with a good mix of the usual corn, biscuity sourdough and a mellow hop in there as well. Not as creamy as Genesee's Cream Ale, but smooth and very drinkable nonetheless.The other remarkable thing is that at 5.5% abv over the course of blowing through the 7oz bottles in a session the alcohol can definitely become apparent for this stinky lil lovely that is always great with pizza. I've had this in the new 12oz Red Bull like cans which actually is a little more cleaned up and less funky, but not nearly as enjoyable as the green glass which adds funk instead of skunk, but only in the smell department. Great price too for either bottles or cans. Hope this stays in production again for years to come","Blueribbon666","Oct 02, 2011"

Green bottle skunkiness rules the day but once you take that into account, you get a bready, malty aroma that isn't half bad. The body is watery-to-medium but fits the style.

Drying aftertaste with a suggestion of spicy Tettnanger or Saaz hop flavor. Despite some distracting skunk taste, this shows balanced bitterness with a genuine pre-prohibition Pils malt character. The mouthfeel aids this effect with a gentle but ample carbonation and a light body that retains some sweetness and creamy texture.
