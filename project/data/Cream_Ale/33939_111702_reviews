"Belgian Cream Ale? Is that like...a Belgian Pale Ale? Great beer. Smooth drinker. Bready, yeasty, doughy tones. I typically don't go for those characteristics in a beer, but in this one it works."

"Good beer.  Very yeasty in a good way.  Extremely light and refreshing."

"With the beer closing its taste, a final glimpse of mint cooling, herbal bitterness and citrus acidity plays into a playful taste and lively feel. Falling short of classic Belgian versions, Warped Wing's Belgian Style Cream Ale finds sure favor with those seeking more than the bland industrial brewer's offering that scour the market."

"Lacking much flavor.  Kind of blah."
"Overall / Drinkability: This one throws me for how to characterize it. It has some definite Belgian style flavor notes, but has some aspects of a Belgian Wit and I'm not sure if it has any real aspects of a Cream ale or not. Maybe in regard to the mouthfeel. So since it defies easy characterization, I'll just say that as a beer, it's easily drinkable (went well with Pork tacos and salad) and flavorful enough that I think it would pair with a wide range of food. Overall, it's a definitely above average beer but it's hard to rate per a style because it's a hybrid."
