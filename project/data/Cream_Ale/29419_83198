4.17,13,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"A few gulps in, very impressive. The balance and dryness builds up the drinkability. Wheat and oat add the element of creaminess and a bit of depth on the way down. A smaller brew but being all malt it was great to see a very liberal hand for hopping here. Cheers to Newburgh for helping redefine this style. 16oz tall boys would be a treat if they get into canning.","Jason","Jul 23, 2012"
