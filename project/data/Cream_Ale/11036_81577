But, if you hadn't told me it was a strawberry beer, I'm not sure I'd have realised it was- it's very subtle. I'm not saying that I'd like it to taste like strawberry syrup, but if something's gonna call itself ""Carolina Strawberry," I'd expect the berry taste to be somewhat more prominent than it is in this beer.","ZorroZ","0"

It really has roots to be great but simply lacks a bit of complexity and texture. Overall a good choice on a hot day sitting in the sand as I was, but not something ill be packing a bunch of back home.","BradtheGreat7","Jul 25, 2013"

3.5,7.7,4,4,3,3.5,3.75,"this is the 2nd time that i have had this beer. the first time i dont think i liked it too much. this time however, it strikes me as a little better. the color is nice a cloudy blonde. hands down the best thing about it is the smell... it smells like sweet strawberries...perfect for summer. the taste is a little sour for me. i mean it isnt terrible but there is a tartness there that i dont really like that much. i feel like the smell promises sweetness and the taste delivers a real tartness. i know other people dont dig on the really sweet beers- so this all comes down to personal taste- if you like a more sour fruit beer by all means go for it. on a side not i have had other beers by foothills and they have some great ones.... if you get a chance you should really check their stuff out.","mattkoon","Feb 13, 2013"
