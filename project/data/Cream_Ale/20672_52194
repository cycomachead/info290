Smell is of malt, grain, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 04, 2014"

I'm missing a little body here, and also some balancing hops for bitterness, but i really like the drinkability and the package (four pack of pint cans), a very good dose. this is nothing earth shattering, but it is a useful brew. good blonde beer for colder weather too, as it has a little meat to it despite the thinner body. of the handful of beers i have had from sun king, this is not the highest quality but one of the ones i appreciate the most. let cream ales live on!","StonedTrippin","Jan 27, 2014"

No huge aroma, smells fresh almost like sea spray! Very smooth on the palate, nothing jumps up and grabs you but the malt is probably predominant. Doesn't hit you over the head with anything, no hops to speak of. This reminds me of listening to the Indy 500 in the garage with my dad in the early 70s and being allowed to take one swig of his beer. Nice. Not the greatest I ever had or the most complex, but would definitely buy again. Good to have on hand to serve at a cookout to those who think Bud Light is good beer.","pmorey","Jun 22, 2013"

Artisinal brewing is just that: subjective, aesthetic, and about gathering an appreciative audience. If you (or anyone you know) doubts that micro brewers can handle the demands of brewing a light, tasty, satisfying beer, give them one of these. And then pop open an Osiris. After an Osiris, I had to try the "other" Sun King canned offering, and while it is a technical achievement and stand out for its precision, smoothness, and execution, it is, at the end of the day, a cream ale. It brings back memories of school in Binghamton, New York, eating hot wings at the Sportsman's Club and Rathskeller and washing down the Frank's Red-Hot with Genny (Gennesee Cream Ale).
