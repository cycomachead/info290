Perhaps this can was an outlier perhaps these are the desired traits of the style I'm not sure. Overall though it's not too bad and for something that is just as drinkable as a Bud and not much more expensive it's not a bad deal either.","laramis","Aug 01, 2014"

The beer is a light ale brewed and is very easy to drink, The beer poured a light clear golden with thin white head. The smell included grain and barley. The taste was similar to the smell a very bready taste with slight hints of sweetness. The mouthfeel was light in body but smooth with mild carbonation. Overall is was a decent cream ale and very drinkable.","WoodBrew","Jun 15, 2011"

3.25,2.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured on-tap at the Bold City Brewery, the beer was served up in a pint glass. The beer pours a pale yellow-gold coloring, slightly hazy, with not a trace of head. There is a slightly sour malty aroma, with some slight musty overtones. Round and smooth bodied, yet it remains light in mouth. The beer has roasty/toasty flavors, with a smokey and roasted aftertaste. Smooth finish. This is well-bodied, which is different for the lager taste that this cream ale carries with it. Interesting brew, and I think it might have been a little bit better out of the growler after it had some time to settle and warm. Either way, I would drink it!","GarthDanielson","Jan 29, 2011"

This beer will pair with those lighter meals like salads that imperials won't. It's a golden color with a high carbonation which makes this a nice bubbly delight.

2.5,-21.4,2.5,2.5,2,3.5,3,"D-Drinkability of this beer is as high as it is light. I did not really care for its flavors that much but if you did this would be a very drinkable beer for you. I did try the Dukes brown ale after this and enjoyed it much better but didnt have the time to review it. In the future however I will pass on this one.","Fieldzy27","Oct 14, 2010"

3.71,16.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D - Quite drinkable, as expected of the style. This is not a complex or interesting beer, but it fills a niche and is relatively good for what it is. The malt character could be a bit richer and the acidity is kind of off-putting, but it is what it is.","nickfl","0"
