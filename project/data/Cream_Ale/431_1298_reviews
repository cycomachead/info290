"A classic.  The seven ounce bottles are genius.  They go down so quick.  Cream ale taste is a good wrinkle on 60s/70s style big productions beers."
""
"An interesting local oddity, the flavor is somewhat interesting, but it isn't a great beer by any regard.  Some lingering creaminess if you imagine really hard."
"Pours to a thick white head that makes fish eye bubbles and pale gold color. Aroma is sweet, corny and slightly fruity. Flavor is the same. Mouthfeel is light and tingly. Pretty decent cream ale."
"Deviated from craft a little bit with this one and was so glad that I did.  Was blown away by how well this stood up to other beers in the industry today.  This retro brand still has it!  And believe it or not this won a GABF medal in the past."
"Bought this simply because my mom has always talked about having Little Kings when she was younger but it was turned out to be much more drinkable than I expected. It's a bit light on the taste and is expectedly light in color and feel but the taste isn't bad at all and is actually quite smooth. When compared to most of the other non-craft offerings I've had, I'll take a Little Kings everyday."
"you know, occasionally, and very occasionally, i like to deviate from the craft beer i love so much for a little refresher course about why i spend so much time and money and energy on this passion of mine, and its beer like this that serves that purpose so well. classic cheap cream ale in a cute little package. its got a mild skunk to the nose, but other than that is an extremely passable macro tasting brew, malty enough in a light pils sort of way, and not lacking in flavor at all. it has a little body, wonderfully refreshing carbonation, and a pretty snappy finish, a fine refresher overall. its honestly not very good, but its also not all that bad, especially when judged against its peers. what it doesnt have though is any real hop profile, anything unique or interesting, an appreciable yeast character, or any capacity to hold my attention or inspire me in any way whatsoever. craft beer has and does at least most of those things most of the time, and thats why i love it so much, it makes me think and it makes me move, and im not sure what i would be mentally or physically if this is the kind of beer i drank all the time. i dont hate it, i am actually thankful for it today for reminding me again why i am so into craft beer. this though, is well enough crafted that i just might buy it again someday!"

"O: Easy to drink and a decent mid-afternoon beer for the holiday. Surprised that it had no skunkiness to it since it comes in the clear green bottle."

"It seems like this beer would be about average for the style. The greats are significantly better and the terrible ones significantly worse."
"Little Kings Cream Ale brewed by Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. This brew is something the old timers talk about a lot- so I had to try it out. This brew has an ABV of 5.5 and it pours out a dark amber color. This brew is darker than your American style lager. Little Kings has a small white head that goes away fast. Now keep in mind this beer is in a 7 oz bottle. The smell is strong and bold with flavor. The taste is bold with flavor. I like how this brew is bold with flavor but it goes down crisp and refreshing. Mouth feel is good this brew smooth. Over all I giving this brew a 4 out 5. I'm really impressed with this brew. I will get this again."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and is a decent representation of the style. I was a little skeptical of this beer coming in a green 7 oz. bottle but was pleasantly surprised it wasn't really that bad."
"O - Nice fruitiness and very refreshing; nice to have in the fridge for my wife who likes 7oz beers..."

"O: A Cincinnati classic that I had to revisit in a more serious light. It's not bad for the style - finishes dry like it's light lager brethren, but with more sweetness up front, yet lacks the sugar-sweetness of a malt liquor (and thankfully the undercurrent of ethanol). This is an light beer that is simple but unoffensive."
"O: Well, it's a cream ale. Pretty simple, pretty sweet. Almost too sweet. No bitterness or hop flavors at all it appears. It pretty much tastes like an extra-sweet budweiser."

"O: Gee I guess my tastes have changed I remember this being so flavorful and good. I swear I could taste the cream that makes it a cream ale. This was only slightly better than a BMC. on the upside my wife loved it. She went crazy for it. Wants me to get more ASAP ! Haha"

"Little Kings weren't one of my ""go to"" beers back in the 70s and 80s (although Robin Hood Cream Ale was always a ""treat""!), and not because I didn't like 'em, but probably because the bottles were too small for my beer guzzling tastes. Well, if the current edition is similar to those old days, than I can say this is a decent enough ale. Nothing spectacular per se, flavorful and refreshing enough to go back and have some more."

"This is not a prime example of this beer. I am not aware of too many places they go through it fast around here though. I bought it to have a traditional Cincinnati beer for opening day."

"I can say straight away that this is a beer that I think anybody could drink and not spit out in disgust. It doesn't even taste like a beer, in my opinion, and that's the reason why. Early on, I got a lot of a vanilla/vodka flavor. After a few sips, I pretty much tasted nothing ... and there was no bitterness. I rate it as highly as I do because it's super sessionable, drinkable, inoffensive, and just really good for any occasion. Not just that, but the bottle's attractive ... especially, I'd think, for the female drinkers. The bottle's a measly 7oz."

"This is a light, very sessionable beer that can replace and American lager. There's just enough flavor to keep you interested and a light body that allows you to put away several of these little bottles."
"Overall, a fairly non-offensive, although below average, cream ale. The sweetness limits drinkability somewhat but I could see having a few every once in awhile."
""
""
"This is a sweet beer that seems like a macro with three teaspoons of sugar added. Not creamy but I would say it is full bodied with a low level of carbonation. The aftertaste is similar to the aftertaste of Coca-Cola."
""

"Overall - Autumn or Spring beer that is almost a daily drinker"

"Poured from a bottle into a lager glass. Pours a light copper color, With a very small head that disappears within seconds leaving very feint lacing. Smell is STRONGLY of butterscotch, Which is perfect for me seeing as it is one of my favorite flavorings. The taste somewhat follows the smell, Butterscotch with a small amount of Adjunct coming through, Though the butterscotch stay's dominant. The mouthfeel was really the only thing that disappointed me about this beer. Very slight notes of butterscotch in the mouthfeel, Followed by a strong cooked corn Adjunct flavor and a strong almost unfathomable metallic taste on the tongue and in the throat. Though the butterscotch somewhat save's the mouthfeel from getting a very low rating and it prevails in the end"

"Average mouthfeel for a cream ale: noticeably thicker than a pale lager, but pretty insubstantial for an ale. A touch too slick, but that's nitpicking. Overall, this is a fine cream ale. It has flavor, which always helps. It's like the flavor of lean you never knew you wanted, only without the codeine."

"D: It is simple small and pretty good tastings.. 5.5 and 7oz...A good session beer... Just wish it came in a bigger bottle."
"The Crack & Glug produced two thick, foamy fingers of bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a very pretty sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity which brightened my day on the post-snowy day leading up to Hallowistmas. Nose was very sweet, almost sugary in its intensity. I CAN agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned pineapple esters in his review. Mouthfeel was medium with a sweet CANned corn taste in the mouth. Finish was still very sweet and I began to fear for an onset of diabetes. It was not bad, but it just was not my cuppa tea."
"Overall / Drinkability: Ho-hum overall. Nothing terribly special but not bad either. Quite drinkable though - it's there and it's gone. Went well with pulled pork BBQ and I suspect it would be good with a lot of other meat and grilled dishes."
"O - This was okay. It was fun to try once, but I probably won't be going back for this one."
"Overall Drinkability - Decent. Smooth. Inoffensive. Uninteresting. Sort of bland."
"use to drink these all the time in highschool then they disappeared forever and was i ever happy to see them again. not necessarily for taste but because of memories. nothing special about this beer as far as anything goes. pours a pale clear yellow with half a finger of sudsy head that is gone within seconds. at first pour the beer had a skunky presence about it. luckily that went away after opening up in the glass. from here on out both nose and mouth experience the same thing. sweet corn and grain with a little bit of grass in there, probably the skunk i smelt during the pour. has a sweet creamy mouthfeel with a slightly dryfinish. overall worth it for the novelty of seven oz bottles that arent over priced. just a decent sweet grainy beer on a hot day."
"Reviewed form notes. Enjoyed many times over the years, reviewed here for the first time. Little 7oz bottle poured into pilsner glass pours a straw yellow with a fluffy half inch head. Funky smell of sourdough and corn with a bit of yeast. Taste isn't funky at all for a green glass bottle however it does have a distinctive funky smell which is more akin to an american adjunct lager then a cream ale, but the taste is smooth and clean with a good mix of the usual corn, biscuity sourdough and a mellow hop in there as well. Not as creamy as Genesee's Cream Ale, but smooth and very drinkable nonetheless.The other remarkable thing is that at 5.5% abv over the course of blowing through the 7oz bottles in a session the alcohol can definitely become apparent for this stinky lil lovely that is always great with pizza. I've had this in the new 12oz Red Bull like cans which actually is a little more cleaned up and less funky, but not nearly as enjoyable as the green glass which adds funk instead of skunk, but only in the smell department. Great price too for either bottles or cans. Hope this stays in production again for years to come"
"A lawnmower beer at best, not bad but nothing memorable either."
"Curious looking beer, and I’m talking about the bottle, pours a straw yellow very clear modest off-white head with low retention and lacing. Very subtle nose consisting of sweet malt and a bit of grassy hops. Sweet malty cereal flavor a bit floral, nothing really stands out. The palate is light crisp dry and refreshing, thin body with ample carbonation. Not a bad beer but nothing special."
"For the most part, this is like drinking carbonated water with some artificial flavors in it. Could use a bit more of everything in the nose, taste, and feel."
"The beer is golden yellow with a thin foamy white head. it smells of buttered biscuits and sour grain. The taste is similar with grain and honey butter with a hint of cream soda. This beer is light with prickly carbonation and a dry finish. This is a solid easy drinking beer, might get old after awhile but a few of em are good."
"O: Goes down easily, ok taste, not filling, low kick, ok representation of style. Although the beer wasn't unpleasant, the apple flavoring and aftertaste make this a one and done for me."
"From the 7 fl. oz. bottle no. 27410-18180K. Sampled on June 30, 2011. The label looks like something out of 1950. It has a pale yellow to nearly golden yellow pour with a burst of white fizzy head that settles down in seconds. Green bottle skunkiness rules the day but once you take that into account, you get a bready, malty aroma that isn't half bad. The body is watery-to-medium but fits the style. The taste is lightly malted but mainly bready and biscuity with a slight hop bite thrown in for good measure. I paid $1.95(!) for an eight pack of these little seven ouncers so I can't complain too much. Good enough for the beach. Easy to hide in your beach bag."
"Overall a tasty cream ale. Not an overly exciting style, but a good rendition nonetheless."
"O - this is a better than average cream ale and I'll be certain to drink more than a few this summer."
"O: Seems to be a decent little beer, taking it out of green bottles would probably help, but I would not continue to drink this at $1 a bottle ($8 per 8 pack of 7 ounce bottles). It was interesting to try."
"O: A decent little beer and a great alternative to the watered down mass produced, ubiquitous beers"
"RJT"
"Taste is creamed corn, mineral, light grassiness, lightly sweet apple cider, faint tart apple zestiness and alight corn-apple aftertaste. It tend slightly to the sweeter side with a character predominantly of lightly sweet, zesty apple and corn. That said, it has an enjoyable, firm character, if simple and light."
"Poured from 2 green 7 oz. bottles. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit skunky, could be those dreaded green bottles. Taste also has a bit of skunk to it, a touch of sweetness, and slightly bitter at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
"Overall- Overall due to its size I can't really take this ale seriously. To me it seemed more like a party favor rather then a refreshing alcoholic beverage. This being my first cream ale I can't say I was too impressed with it. Perhaps I bought a skunked batch, but what ever the case I don't think I'd purchase this again."
"This has a good non-intrusive taste and is meant to be a sessionable beer. I like it quite a bit, but is it worth the premium when you could buy a macro that isn't all that different flavor wise."
"Poured from a 7 OZ bottle golden yellow. Smells of Grain and Corn sort of sweet. Taste is sweet with a hint of bitterness. Very Refreshing in your mouth. This is a really a nice retro Beer and I have finished off a case of 7 oz bottles in three days. I find this beer to be a very nice session beer and very enjoyable. Give it a try it sure surprised me."
"A retro brand looking for another heyday. Bubbly white lace crackles a bit but stays a true, clear, pale yellow color. Clean nose of sweet cooked corn and subtle grassy grain. Light fluffy body with a snappy crispness. Kiss of sweet- ness to start, with cooked veggies and a bready undertone. Muted hops just provide a balancing bitterness. Hint of alcohol and twang of fermented grain. Clean dry finish. It is what it is. A no-frills brewski that is easy to put down if you're into lighter-styled beers. This beer also told us that it should be paired with chili cheese dogs."
" Long live Little Kings!! (A+ in my book! Though sadly, not in my official review)"
"Pours with a thin, sudsy head that dissolves quickly. Ginger-colored beer with significant carbonation. Smells sweet and musty, very heavy on the malts. The taste is sweet and of grain and corn. Its smooth, syrupy body makes this an enjoyable drink, despite the lacking flavor profile. A decent session brew...even though (or especially because?) you have to drink twice as many."
"Drinkability - This beer would be a nice thirst quencher during a hot Summers day. It's slightly better than most macros however I wouldn't go out of my way to pick this up."
"Gold in color with a one finger white head that quickly fades to a thin lace on top. Faint musty and grainy aroma. Flavor is pretty bland with some sweet malt and a bit buttery. Slightly bitter and metallic in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin. Nice to have for nostalgia reasons but it's far from good beer."
"bottle consumed was a 7oz mini. The beer poured a golden yellow hue with average amount of head and carbonation. Slightly frothy, but with an average aroma of barley hops as well. I love the small bottle, as it makes this more drinkable, as this beer would probably lose its appeal in a 12 oz bottle. Worth a try!"
"Man, this was interesting. Um, I am at a loss for words. I think this is one you drink from a bottle, anything to help contain the smell. Not for my, the bottle was about 6.70 ounces too much."
"Poured a clear yellow-amber with a super small white fizzy head that dissapated rapidly and had no lacing.The aroma was of grain malts, a grassy hop and a soapy yeast. It tasted sweet with an ever so light hoppiness from start to finish. Mouthfeel was light in body and creamy yet watery in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall a a very light brew which is typical of cream ale's, but have to say it is quite drinkable yet nothing special."
"D- Very sessionable ill give it that."
"Not sure I've had any other cream ales, but I brewed a Little Kings clone one time, that didn't turn out good, so I recommend to just buy it."
"Good for a quick beer after a hot day--reminds me of the Old Styles and Old Milwaukees my dad used to drink."
"drinkability - if it tastes awful how could the drinkability be any better - i did drink the Whole bottle 7oz but if you gave me the rest of my life i would not want to finish this whole 8 pack"
"What a cute wittwe bottwe! It pours a clear pale copper topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises flowers, wheat, lemongrass, and a pinch of powdered sugar. The taste holds notes of wheat, grass, flowers, light vanilla, and a touch of cream cheese. The body is rather light, with a light carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a nice little cream ale. Well worth the minuscule price tag, considering how easy it is to drink."
"D: A little tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a poundable beer worth drinking for a while when you want something very light."
"Served at refrigerator temperature. Color is a bronzy-golden hue; smells of malt and subtly wet cardboard; could be (very) slightly skunky which makes sense given the green glass bottle. The ""cream"" in this ale is obvious and pleasant. Most of the reviews of this beer describe this as an unpleasant brew, which I suspect is due mostly to the green glass bottles. Given proper storage, this is probably a fun, different beer. Light, however, is not a friend. The small bottles (7oz) are a good choice, as this beer should be consumed quickly after pouring."
"D - Not. I had a few. Threw the rest of the case away."
"Pours a clear yellow with active sudsy carbonation, but a seltzery diminished head leaves no real lace of which to speak. The nose is of creamed corn, some vanilla and light plastic notes. Flavors are superficial, not built on a real malt base, rather a vanilla flavoring and macro corn notes. The finish is a lingering sweet vanilla. Not bad, but certainly nothing memorable."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a tiny little white head (no more than a rim) and absolutely no lacing. Smells of creamed corn and very sweet. Very one note on taste sweet and a lot like corn with a little balanced bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and drinkability is high."
"D - Really not bad. You won't mistake it for the good stuff, but it's a pretty decent brew. I making it a go-to cheap beer to switch things up, and knocking back a few cans of this with some burgers."
"D - Traditional American swill. Better than BMC, but still very similar."
"D-Some palates may appreciate what was attempted here, just not mine. Glad I have only 7oz. of this before moving on the something better I hope."
"never had a cream beer before so i decided to grab some Little Kings and give it a shot. I'm drinking it straight out of the bottle so i dont know how much head and etc there is but based on drinking it, there's not much head, lacing, etc .. basically this beer doesnt need a review, it just needs to be known as a very slightly creamy sweet version of Heineken without that Heiny aftertaste. If its cheap and you just want to pound some beers that go down easily and stay that way for a while, go for it."
"This beer is presented in a little seven ounce green bottle. The dark golden beer has little head above. The aroma seems to exude a mixture sweet corn and malt. The sweetness intensifies on the palate with similar flavors. The texture is almost syrupy. It finishes with nary a hint of bitterness. Perhaps the size of the bottle portends what's inside."
" D- This beer was clean and light but had some interesting depth to the flavors that were there. It went down smooth and didn't really have one flavor that overpowered any other flavor. It's to bad it was a 7oz. bottle as I could have drank a whole 12 oz. in one session."
"D: What makes this a cream ale? No cream taste and not really creamy on the palate. A bit too sweet with very little to no character. It's not bad by any means, but there are a veritable ton of better creations out there."
"A very drinkable beer, and a decent representation of the style."
"With a very light almost sweet dry aftertaste it's hard not to like this beer more, but then again I like beers that have more tastes, whether that of roasted malts, or cascade hops, or being aged in whiskey casks, whatever, I would rather have just more of something from this beer."
"Had this beer just to try, not to impressed as there was nothing special, although it came in a 70z. bottle which was nice and very cheap. I could see this as a session beer at the beach. the cream was not over whelming which was nice. Even though i was not to overly impressed by this I would recommend it to people to try and would have in the future."
"Taste makes me thankful these are only in 7 oz bottles! Grainy adjuncts with a decent amount of ale yeast fruitiness. Creamy body is not bad, and is pretty well done for the style. It is drinkable in the way that an American Malt Liquor can be when the need strikes. A bit pricey for that to entice me to purchase an 8-pack anytime soon...a fotay of OE 800 can do the trick for about a fifth of the price. Meh, not impressed, but didn't have too much problem finishing my mini-bottle."
"I've never understood how cream ale didn't become America's choice beer instead of the adjunct lager. This beer has some flavor and is supremely drinkable - the carbonation level isn't so amped up that it hurts when you drink it too quickly. If nothing else, at least get your macro loving friends to switch to something like this."
"This is almost dangerously drinkable, but it's not one of my favorites. For the style it's pretty good, though."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and a good example of the style. I haven't minded drinking this 8-pack even a little bit. That said, I probably wouldn't drink this beer more than a few times a year, but I would certainly drink it again regularly. I would recommend it and hope that you get to try one that is as fresh as this one I am drinking now."
"Pours a very nice golden color, with good head, decent lacing, and a lot of bubbly carbonation. Very sweet lager scent, with a slighlty skunky nose. Decent taste, a very sweet creamy malt, but with an cloying aftertaste. Goes down quite extremely smooth."
"D: No thanks, one 7oz of this is enough for me. Its not a horrible beer, but I'm not enjoying this. I think I'd rather drink an adjunct lager over this. Not impressed."
"All in all, not too bad for the style. I've been curious about this one for awhile (admittedly due to the packaging), and that curiosity is now satisfied."
"Pours a clean/clear golden pale yellow color, some carbonation, little fizzy white head, very little sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hop note. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with a hop note in there. Light body. Barely Drinkable, not impressed at all. This brew showed up in the SLS here in Layton, what a bunch of wasted space for this one."
"Probably won't buy it again, but who knows? I might."
"D: It is OK, has a sort of standard taste and is somewhat easy to drink. I wouldn't go seek it out though."
"Nice to try this again."
"D - I'm sure if I was able to get a fresh hidden from the light bottle it would be better but probably not by much not worth it"
"I had some Little Kings over 30 years ago and was not impressed. My opinion had changed somewhat during the intervening years. While not a great beer it wasn't that bad and I wouldn't have minded guzzling half a dozen under the right circumstances."
"Skunky aroma at first, becoming grainy and musty after that. Inoffensive papery grain flavor, slightly bitter in the finish. Fairly light, sort of crisp, but still a bit watery. Vague suggestion of sweet apple in the aftertaste. Fairly simple and easy to drink in a non-intellectual way. An average lawnmower beer."
"Overall: Nothing special for a cream ale, but nothing bad or offensive either. Just because the size is interesting I would buy a few of these again."
"I would like to try another one of these and see if I get the same skunky smell, because without that I could see drinking a bunch of these. It's a good little beer."
":("
"Had not had this in about twenty-five or so years.Picked up an eight pack to see if it might bring back so old memories, it did most of them not to bad but I understood why it had been so long.To sum it up I'll call this one a mass quantity beer as compared to a quality brew.Not really all that bad but it's amazing the stuff I used to put away as compared to now."
"D: Cheap, crappy, nostalgia beer. Even Genny Cream is a bit more palatable. Good thing it was only 7 OZ."
"The foam was white in color, bubbly and dissapated quickly. The color was light golden yellow with hints of amber. The smell was of a typical American pils, nice ballance of hops and barley. The taste to me was like an average mainstream pils with some bitterness and small undertones of wheat and lemon. Mouthfeel - light to medium-bodied. Drinkability - better than the average watered down beer."
"Bottle at PPRBSG09 thanks to beastiefan2k. Pours a clear yellow with a white head. Aroma of sweet pale malt. Flavor of light corn malt, some bready notes and sweet fruits. Actually I found this chill and drinkable...(apparently Eugene and I are alone in thinking this)"
"D: overall good beer for nice day also a very good price"
"Unless these come complimentary, with a ""try me"" sticker, taped to the back of a bottle of Wild Turkey, I don't think I'm game enough for another."
"Pale golden with a slight white foamy head that quickly settles and leaves some blotchy lace behind. Toasted sweet corn flakes in the nose and not much else. The flavor is mostly sweet and malty up front with very little hop character present. Light bodied with smooth carbonation. An okay beer that is only slightly better that a typical macro lager."
"Got this in a trade with Infestaxion. This is one of those ""cult"" beers that people love. This is brewed at the Lion in Wilkes Barre, PA but only sold in the Midwest. Poured from a 7 ounce green bottle. Strangely this 7 oz is actually a different size than the Rolling rock 7 oz bottle. Do we need 2 types of 7 oz beer bottles? Beer poured into a small glass. Yellow color, with small head. The beer quickly goes flat. Grainy, fruity smell. You can smell the extra alcohol content too. The taste reminds me of beer from the 1980s. Not sure if the beer has changed or I am just not drinking the cheapest beer around these days. Drinkability is ok. Nice to have some variety out there. When I drink this I wonder what the special appeal is/was for cream ale. Other than the extra kick, dont see it."
"Small white head, clear golden yellow, and very active carbonation. Left some nice lacing. Sweet and malty smelling with some adjuncts present. The adjuncts aren't as offputting here as they are in macro-lagers. Adjuncts seem right at home in the creamy sweetness. Pretty tastey stuff, but it's not something I would want a lot of in one sitting."
"D- You could hit a few of these but there may be others that are better balanced and tastier."
"Little 7 oz. bottle of green. My whole hand wraps around it. It half-filled my pint glass, obviously. Transparent golden yellow color with a tall white head and no lacing. This beer kind of stinks. Kind of mediciney with hints of straw or hay and sour corn. Tastes like cereal grains and low quality ingredients. I like the texture, however. Kind of creamy. I don't like the bitter/sour aftertaste, though. Not very good beer. I'm glad there aren't 5 more ounces, to be honest."
"this brew pours up a clear golden color with a decent little white head. the nose is grainy with pale malts and subtle hop bittering. the taste is basically the same as the nose but a tid bit sweeter and much creamier. Medium bodied, low carbo, a clean finish. A pretty solid beer. Now I know why them yankees love this beer so much."
"This beer actually turned out to be fairly well brewed and is easy to drink. I'd prefer this to many American lagers."
"An amber color with carbonation bubbles. A small white head. Smell is corn, wheat, there seems to be a floral hint and a hint of skunky. It has a creamy mouth feel that has hints of skunk, with corn malt and hops. The finish is short lived. It is an okay beer, better than what I thought it was going to be. Drinkable"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a light body and is well carbonated. The drinkability is pretty high. I drank 4 of these while typing this review."
"A rare treat reminiscent of some hazy college days. Little Kings pack some power and are very drinkable. Faint skunky aroma, not offensive at all. Medium yellow with a solid white head. Creamy to the palate with an easy finish. Flavor is of solid creamy malt real simple but it's good."
"D: I used to drink a case of these when I was a wee lad and still want more. I think a sixer over a card game would suffice nowadays. This beer is pure nostalgia for me. Its like comfort food. That's why it gets a 4.5 for drinkability. Go out and try one of these little fellas on. You'll see they have a nice fit."
"Poured from the mini-bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, yellow-golden color with a sparkling white head and a stream of bubbles rising from the depths of the glass. The smell has a distinct sweetness about it, sort of a vanilla-banana mixed with a sweet liquor smell. The taste has a bit of corn adjunct to it, but other than that a slightly sweet maltyness that has a creamy mouthfeel and a crisp, slightly dry finish. Overall, I think this is a pretty decent beer; better than the average swill for sure."

"Pours a clear gloden straw hue, with a creamy two finger head. Good retention and light, spotty lacing. Light-struck aroma with background Pilsener malt, slight DMS aroma, and a hint of sulfer yeast. Sweet pale malt and mild dextrins upfront, with some sharp Pils and sweet corn notes. Drying aftertaste with a suggestion of spicy Tettnanger or Saaz hop flavor. Despite some distracting skunk taste, this shows balanced bitterness with a genuine pre-prohibition Pils malt character. The mouthfeel aids this effect with a gentle but ample carbonation and a light body that retains some sweetness and creamy texture. Goes down very smooth and highly quaffable, esecially given the smaller bottle. In the heat of summer, this would be my first choice for lunch out on the patio."
"revisited these and i get shit tons of green apple...have never noticed this much in any beer much less this dominant. don't recall it from my younger days drinking this either, not that i was paying attention. almost no aroma, maybe some corn and green apple. no head really. a little deeper color than most macros. first time out of hundreds i've poured it into a glass. best cream ale is from sun king in indiana."
"Got this little bottle from Chris and drank it within a couple of weeks of being shipped to Dublin. It was not too full of flavor, but poured smooth with little and drank easy-basically an average beer. I find it hard to believe that it is rated at 5.50% ABV and I dont necessarily taste where the ""cream ale"" name comes from, but I would drink more. I do have another bottle to compare this first one too-maybe I will drink it next week or something."
"Drinkability - sampled for posterity's sake. Not my kind of beer, though I would buy it now and then to accomodate the swill-mongers."
"I basically blasted this stuff into the glass, and I got NO HEAD at all. Its flat, and still with deep yellow body. Bruised apple aroma with stale hops and wet paper. Tastes like apple juice with a hop pellet in it. Very one dimensional and straight forward. FInishes with zero carbonation, and a little unpleasant. Almost as non-descript as a beer can be. Ohh my. Hey, its a new state for me! Thanks Chris!"
"Straight-up pour gives a one finger white head that fades to a ring leaving a trace of lace. Almost clear amber color. Light bodied and light carbonation. Nose is a faint lemon and corn. Starts with some sweetness, mild flavor in fact hardly any flavor not worth 89¢ for a wussy 7 oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"No creamy aftertaste like I would expect and nothing to promp me to buy another."
"For the style this beer is average on the palate. Lightbodied and medium-high carbonation are demonstrated by this beer, and that seems to fit the stylistic parameters. I probably won't buy this beer again because there is no point. There's nothing special to this beer, no reason to drink it again. Sure its easy to drink and goes down quite smooth and very easily, but it is just an almost average beer. Nothing calls me back to this beer."
"Overall, a beer that tastes better slugged down straight from the bottle."
"Because the taste and feel of this beer change from decent to almost bad so fast, I didn't find it very drinkable. I'll pass on this one next time."
"Every year since then, right as it's starting to get warm, I start thinking about taking another trip to Cedar Point, to Port Clinton. I'd pay (most) of my own way now, of course, but it'd be pretty much the same. Me, Dad, Sis, and whatever friends we want to bring along. I always talk about it to whoever is around when the idea comes into my head, they always agree that it's great, we should definitely do it, and it's never spoken of after that night. It wouldn't be the same. I always realize that when I sober up."
"Drinrkabilty is average , nothing that keeps me from having another."
"A unique beer, and as I remember it when I last had it 10 years ago. I remember I used to stop at Big Bear on my way home from work when I was in college and pick up a 40 or 2 for a couple of bucks. Time hurries on..."
"Taste, as I expected, is all-malt as well, slightly nutty, but with a weird and unpleasant sour and soapy taste. Is that supposed to be the bitters? Whatever it is, it's wholly unpleasant. Thin in the mouth and slightly dry going down. Yes, it is creamy, so I guess the description fits, but I'm telling ya, I'm going to have a really hard time choking this mini-bottle down. I'll just leave it to the ladies...."
"Beer is good. Happy surprise diferent little beerings."
"If poured it's a golden color with a flowing white head, with light body and moderate carbonation. The scent is very light with hints of grass.Flavor was pretty good but no real hops that stood out. The mouthfeel was rather disappointing by my standards but all in all I was happy to relive my youth.I drank these a lot growing up ....but they are now somewhat rare to find anymore ."
"But I've matured. Still, the brew's main appeal - for me - is that it is quite drinkable and the taste does nothing to keep one from having yet another one. The appearance, smell, and mouthfeel scores still seem correct. But if you're just old enough - or not quite old enough - to buy the stuff, it still has that appeal, that mystique."
"Very pale yellow in colour with lots of carbonation and an odd soap-bubbly head. Theres a strange fruity (apple perhaps?) aroma to this one, along with some corn notes. There are some bready malt flavors, along with more corn. Very thin bodied. I found it hard to finish even though the bottle was so small. Gernerally yucky."
"This is a green 8 ounce bottle brewed for Schoenling by Snyder Intl Brewing Group of Frederick MD. I think Sam Adams bought the Schoenling Cincinnatti brewery. The pour is a dull almost cloudy straw to gold color. A white whisp of head caps it off. The aroma is soapy, grassy sweet malty corny, not exciting. Flavor, is sweet and grassy, almost sweetener type sweet. The body leans toward the syrupy side. THe aftertaste returns to the grassiness as it dries up. Just a run of the mill adjunct brew with a bit more flavor, drink it cold."
"I dig this stuff... Cool bottle, cool flavor, overall a very cool brew. Had a pretty golden color with a cloud-like white head. Medium carbonation. Not much detected when smelled, only natural grassy like odors, and even those were quite light. Flavor was pretty good, tasted like sweet cream corn that was over cooked. Finish was kind of syrupy, and slightly overpowering, with notes of artificial sweetness. Not bad though, I like to have this brew every once in awhile. Worth a try, if you can find it."
"I have to admit, despite the nostalgia thing, I wasn't expecting much out of this little 7 ounce bottle. I didn't really get much either, but I do think more highly of it than I expected to. Even though I'm glad that Little Kings is still being brewed, I doubt that I'd buy it on a regular basis. Maybe once a year if I felt like reliving my youth. Okay, so I'm a sentimental liar."
"An eight pack of pony bottles, what we used to call ""splits' when it came to Rolling Rocks or Matt's Premium in the late 70s. Dull less-than-golden color, head struggles very low and then vanishes completely. Very little lace, just a few dots on one side of a Pilsner glass. Vegetal aromas, slightly toffee but with some definite traces of cooked greens. Light body, average carbonation. The flavor is subdued, vaguely sticky and bready and sweet with a severe lack of detectable hops. Seems slightly seltzery in the close but also seems easy going with its light sweetness and little else. In the long run, though, there's really not much of anything going on with this beer."
"The beer evacuates the stubby green bottle a limpid gold color with a bright white modest creamy head that erodes leaving a thin layer of lace to obfuscate the glass. Nose is crisp and clean, sweet malt dominates, start is sweet and pleasantly malted, top is thin in its feel upon the palate. Finish is benign in its acidity and the hops light in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a drinkable beer."
"7oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium gold color with half a finger of head that dies quickly. There's almost no lacing. The smell is sweet and malty, has a bit of a corn smell to it as well. No real trace of hops. The taste is malty and corny, with a slight burning sensation on the finish. The body is actually fairly thick. The drinkability is ok as well. Really needs some work."
"I started drinking this stuff at my friends bar in Cleveland ,OH - The Little King's Lounge - they were almost exclusive in their carrying of the beer as far as bars in the city went. Doesnt smell the best , but its small size (7oz) makes drinking them easy. The fairly potent AC (5.5%) tends to creep up on you after an 8 pack of them or so. They just started brewing them again from a hiatus of a couple years. There was a Little Kings Red that was around years ago , was dumped after the first brewery quit brewing them and the rights were resold to another company."
"""Not Recomended"" ??? Awww, c'mon, guys. This may not be the best beer in the world, but it's a good, clean, crisp beer that goes down easy. I used to buy these in the cute little 7-ounce bottles when I lived in Denver, and I could knock down ten of 'em on a hot Summer afternoon! A bit on the light side, but that's what made them so easy to knock off! And with those nifty little bottles, they never go flat or get warm. I wish I could buy them where I now live, in Arizona!"
"I found a sixer of this in Tulsa OK, and I had never heard of it so I picked it up, however these were 12oz bottles not the 7ozers like people have been describing. Anyway I was kind of weary of this beer when I took a wiff, it had the smell of a 40oz of OE, however after the first taste I knew that I had nothing to worry about. I rather enjoyed this beer. I usually opt for the darker beers, but I will drink anything however this was suprising. The appearance was light with a white head that left some lace and the taste was nice and light with a big mouthfeel on the back of the tongue. It does have a nice creamy feel to it and I highly recommend this to anyone who likes a nice creamy beer."
"This isn't awful, but I sense nothing to really recommend it, other than its historical relationship to the old Cincinnati breweries."
"A review down the line from Masterbruewer gives a great historic edge to understanding this little brew. For myself I picked up a 24 pk. for 10.99, a deal to stock up with. It poured a bright golden yellow with an average size, soft white head. Carbonation is medium but it still fades quickly to a film. Lace is not to be found. The aroma is mettalic and sulphury. The taste is semi-sweet corn, faint tart hop and faint on malt. An aquired taste perhaps, but not all that bad. Its not a big brewery beer but a little bargain attempt at best."
"A perfect novelty ""beer"" if you wanna get it on with drunk college coeds and don't mind a serious headache the morning after. They will drink this up like wildfire, plus it comes in a cute little bottle and tastes better than Ommegang! Aghhh, why does my right eye hurt?"
"Acquired via trade. I guess when I was afraid that I would never see a bottle of Little Kings on store shelves ever again I figured I owed it to the Ohio brewing community to at least try it. Needless to say getting through the seemingly insubstantial 7oz was no small task. The beer pours a rather bright yellow color with a thin and quickly dying head. No real lacing to speak of. The aroma is a little musty but there are some hops trying to make their presence felt. The body is weak, and so is the watery hops flavor with hints of sourness here and there. The finish is kind of the last gasp in this little guy. I guess on some level I am glad I tried it but it's just not a good beer."
"pours out a hazy dark golden colour...minimal head and no lace. an adjuncty, sulphury, aroma...smells cheap. mega corn taste...some well hidden fruit and yeast. mouthfeel is sort of rough and gritty, not really creamy at all. drinkability is low, and although i'll polish off the eight pak of seven ouncers, i won't be purchasing this ever again. this is a poor beer."
"This beer is an acquired taste, but highly drinkable when you know what to expect."
"Color is of yellow light gold, close to pale, but definately not clear, thin white head of loose froth fades some to a thin haze always present and no lace. Smell is all sweet corn and not much else, maybe a hint of floralness, hard to get past the sweetness. Taste is more sweetened corn and grains, creamy, and airy frothed malts, very fresh and farmy, like a farmers own home brew with the ingredients grown in his fields out on a Iowa flat. In that fashion, it has a quality like no other Cream ale. Feel is a light delight of creamy easyness and light carbonation which makes for a good ""little"" summer drink."
"I drank this beer right out of their little green bottles. I heard about this beer being an Ohio right of passage for up and coming beer drinkers, so I went for it. After killing about 5 from an 8 pack, I came to realized that they werent so bad. As long as they remained cold, which was easy because of the small bottles. Its a pungent and almost skunky beer with a definite grainy corn taste (or some other adjuncts). They went down pretty easy. Although, not a well crafted beer, I liked it anyways."
"Another Cincinnati classic, a real survivor from the golden era in the 50s. This little gem was, and is, a local favorite. It is not a great beer on any account, but its creamy sense, hop presence, and good looking gold color continue to make it a choice for many settings. Don't go out of your way, but if it's convenient why not try one?"
"Murky light golden color with a fast-dissipating head, no lace, faint carbonation. Slightly tangy aroma of sweet corn, with some alcohol notes. Taste begins with pronounced sweet alcohol flavors, and cream corn flavors, towards the finish, a little bitter hops appear. Overall, nothing special, although there is nothing that offends. For the fact that it is sold in a eight packs of seven ounce bottes at around $5 (Texas), I would say its a poor value for the money."
"This beer has been hanging around the back of beer refer for several months. It has been cold and dark but that has not helped it much. The beer pours a pale golden yellow with a head that disappates so fast that you better not blink or it is gone. The smell of corn is stong as is the taste. I would recommend this beer for someone who is wanting to know what DMS - corn - smells and tastes like The beer finishes quite sour and the mouthfeel is light. I would have no use for this beer except as an example of what a beer is not supposed to taste like."
"Colour was a med-dark gold with limited head, taste was bordering on a mild sweet...hops evident in the aroma as well as minor after taste......"
"Ah, the little bottle of Little Kings!  This beer has a light citrus taste to it and is extremely easy to drink. Overall, very light, flavor-wise, but a novelty due to the small bottles.  I drank these while standing at the BBQ, grilling steaks and somewhat enjoyed it."
"Little Kings Cream Ale has flavors that are assertive in nature. The flavor that is asserted the most is a strong corn like sweet that would take some time getting use to. For those who are into sweet Beer, Little Kings Cream Ale would be your mug of Beer."
"No head at all pale, strawish golden. Odd nose and palate, creamy-sweet & skunky-bitter. Awful on all accounts. Thank God it comes in 7oz. bottles because anymore would have been a chore. Not recommend at all."
"This has an awful smell to it like bad b.o.(body odor)..it has a creamy texture and a sweetish adjuncty type taste.  The taste is OK, but the smell is killing me everytime I take a drink of this.  I also smell some alcohol and faint hops but the first strong smell is of B.O.  The little bottles are cool, and at one time I thought this was a treat to find.  Not any more.  Genny Cream Ale is a clear step up from this."
"This beer was a very pale yellow color and formed absolutely no head. An aroma of grain and slightly of hops. A flavor of grain and not much else.I used to drink Little Kings, which was common where I was from. While I found it better then the more larger macro brews, it still is not high on my list."
"Clean, slightly astringent front with moderate hops showing up in the middle and holding through the finish.  Rice/corn adjunct flavors added a little crispness, for whatever that is worth."
