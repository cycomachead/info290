3.48,10.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/15/2013. A moderate gusher upon opening. Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, grass, light vanilla, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and light vanilla notes; with decent strength. Taste of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, vanilla, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, cracker, biscuit, light honey, vanilla, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and vanilla flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and some slightly cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is a solid cream ale. Good robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and vanilla flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 23, 2014"

So here goes nothing...it poured a very light and extremely clear golden yellow with a two finger frothy bright white head. It smells of a light lager with the slightest hint of vanilla. The lack of vanilla is actually surprising, despite being an extremely light style in the first place. As it warms it starts to open up a little bit. The vanilla is a little more apparent. The flavor too is disappointing. There is maybe one drop of vanilla per bottle. As it warms, the vanilla is actually apparent in the taste and aftertaste but it is very subtle.

There was no apparent lacing evident. The aroma was comprised of a slight hop hint and vanilla. The flavor of this beer actually came in three stages in the same succession: First you would get a very light hop flavor that was followed by a note of vanilla, that was then followed by a note of cream upon swallowing. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very interesting brew with multiple flavors coming in as the sip goes along.

3.13,-0.3,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"*Note* A visit to their website reveals that there are Kent Goldings and Fuggles in this. Okay, I'd believe that. It also says there's Cascade in here, as well. How much? One cone?","SilentSabre","Nov 28, 2007"
3.46,10.2,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Hadn't had this one in a while but remembered it's quite refreshing. Served a nice gold yellow with a thin head that lasts as a thin layer. Aroma was some sweet malt and just a hint of vanilla. The taste is a nice subtle blend of vanilla and malt. The beer is nice and light with a refreshing crisp bite. This is a decent beer if you're looking for summer refreshment.","atsprings","Nov 05, 2007"
4.07,29.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Hazy lemon yellow appearance. HUGE white fluffy head that hangs around a long while. A thin head stays on the beer the whole time with good sticky lacing decorating the glass gracefully. Sweet grain smell. There's not a lot of vanilla in the smell like I had suspected but still a great smelling beer. Sweet grain taste with vanilla coming through in the end and hints of lemon shining through at random times. Such a creamy feel to it with a sweet citrus palate. This is a great brew from a brewery on the way up.","clemsonbrewer","Apr 22, 2007"
3.78,20.4,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Finally, I am able to try this brew. While on vacation in Tennessee, I was able to find a store that carried this. As a fan of vanilla beers, I have been waiting a few years to try this and it finally happened. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a glass. The beer pours a light clear straw, forming a good 1 inch head that slowly faded. The aroma is an interesting mix of vanilla and what smells like grain. The taste further brings out a grainy character, but also plenty of vanilla flavoring, along with a balanced hop and malt presence. Not complex, but still tasty. The mouthfeel is smooth and light. Low abv. and decent flavor make for a very drinkable beer. While not as sweet as some other flavored beers, this is still not something that I would want to drink continuously all night, but a great beer to start the night with or in between the heavy-bodied brews. Overall, well worth the wait IMO. I just wish this was available in Texas. Definitely worth seeking out on future out-of-state trips.","beeragent","Mar 12, 2007"
3.63,15.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a cloudy darker yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little off-white head, some islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, hoppy, some hint of vanilla, some caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, some hint of vanilla, the finish is pretty dry. Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad of a brew, would be great for the hot days of summer.","Wasatch","Mar 01, 2007"

3.52,12.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Gotta' say, this was a fun beer to drink. Not that the quality was all that great, but I appreciate the creativity. I enjoyed the light ale flavors with the mild addition of vanilla. The beer takes on a confectionate-like sweetness (cotton candy-ish). The source of the sweetness is questionable until the vanilla aromas enter the ofactories. The a light buttery note accompanies the light fruity, estery maltiness. Tastes much the same as expected from the aromas. A soft sweetness up front, then increasing vanilla flavors toward the finish. The beer weakens into the finish with a light bitterness (not hop diriven). With the higher carbonation, the beer gets very cream-soda-like. A good thing, but it just doesn't mean it's a quality beer. I've got to give them cool points though.","BEERchitect","Aug 27, 2006"
3.6,14.6,4,4,3.5,4,3,"This was a solid beer but the flavors were a little too strong for me personally. The appearance and smell were both good with vanilla dominating the nose. The taste was strong vanilla bean that trumped everything else. Mouthfeel was fine, but drinkability was hampered by the over the top vanilla flavor. This beer when blended with their doppelbock was much smoother and balanced. I would recommend blending it as the brewer's wife suggested when I sampled it.","veech","Mar 21, 2006"

2.81,-10.5,4,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Maybe the brewery should swap in some spicy/funky Belgian yeast. That combo might actually work! As is, I cant rightfully enjoy this beer. Its too sweet, too one-dimensional too bad. I am surprised this beer is as good as it is, yet I think it could be so much better. Would a true Cream Ale jell with vanilla? Ill never know! Thanks timtheenchanta for the bottle.","bditty187","Beers"
3.87,23.2,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Thomas Creek Vanilla Cream Ale smells like a dream. Each time I raise the glass to my lips, I get a blast of sweet vanilla that only makes the flavor that follows pale in comparison. This is still a good little drinker, but it could be amazing if the mysteries of the nose could be unlocked and applied to the palate. Thanks to WOLFGANG for an interesting beer.","BuckeyeNation","0"

3.92,24.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,5,"Tasted this at the Border Beer Bust and was a bit surprised. It was one the beers in the experimental category and it was a bit like drinking a cream soda without most of the sweetness. I almost scored it in second place for the category, but the lightness of the beer let it fall behind. Excellent flavor, the vanilla is balanced with the light straw malt and the low hopping makes it extremely drinkable. I could see turning on non-beer drinkers pretty easily with this beer.","aracauna","0"
