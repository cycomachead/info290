Nothing really stands out, either good or bad, but the 22oz format makes it doubtful I'll grab many more of these.

Dead eventually recedes to a ring in my glass. Looks generally pleasing for a summer day. Smell is floral, with a slight sweetness. The taste starts with a light smooth sweetness. Then I get some citrus and floral before the beer finishes with dryness. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This is a great summer day beer, I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I could have considering it is the middle of winter.

3.18,-12.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pale gold with small white head, leaves a good amount of lace. Fruity yeast aroma, hints of apple and orange. Malts are mild and light, with a touch of sweetness. Hops are sparkly and lightly citric, a bit hoppier than some cream ales but that's because most are bland mass-produced pasteurized lager wannabes. Still, the hops are hardly noteworthy. Fruity ale yeast dominates the flavor with traces of butterscotch that linger. Some lactic sourness in the aftertaste. This is a solid cream ale, or, light golden ale, as I think of it, since it's not really creamy. But the style does almost nothing to excite me. The buttery flavors dominate whatever malt sweetness and hop bite there could be. I guess Pelican wanted to make a light, lager-esque beer for those who don't like big beers. A cream ale is a valid compromise if you don't have storage facilities or bottom-fermenting yeast. Still, I'd rather reach for a proper, crisper, cleaner-tasting lager any day of the week.","Thrasher","Sep 13, 2003"

3.59,-1.1,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Light gold color, slightly hazy. Head is medium. Aroma is malty with some floral hoppyness. A medium bodied Cream Ale. Lighter flavors, as expected for a Cream Ale. The mild malts are well balanced by the mild floral hops. Nicely balanced beer. Fruity and refreshing. It not the kind of beer you would expect from a Pacific North West brewery. Mild and kind of subtle. Nice beer. Etched/Painted Beer bottle. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and very dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","May 05, 2003"
2.8,-22.9,3,3,2.5,3,3,"This cream ale poured a medium pale gold with a lot of foam that sticks around for awhile, but the smell and taste was a disappointment. Not really bitter, but this beer is lacking in depth and flavor. The bottle said, ""Fruity, floral and hop aroma with malty flavor", NOT. Smooth dry finish with lack luster taste, it is!","BeerManDan","Apr 05, 2003"
3.42,-5.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer as it sets in my glass after a day of toil and drudgery is a slightly hazy golden yellow with highlights of orange. The head is adequate and bright white in color with a creamy texture, as it erodes, a fine coating of lace is left upon the glass. Nose is malt sweet, fresh and clean, with hints of what to me seems orange peel? Start is sweet and loaded with malt, the top skeletal in feel with the finish leniently acidic. The hops are present and a bit understated and the aftertaste quite dry, a drinkable beer but borders on being a bit weak for my liking, but thats not all bad.","Gusler","Mar 14, 2003"
4.33,19.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A most excellent brew and very very drinkable..its great on tap to at the Pelican Brew pub..this is great drinking outside on the patio in summer with views of the monsterous rock and the waves beyond!","Reidrover","Beers"
3.91,7.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,5,"Brilliantly clear golden hue. Topped by a fluffy porcelain white head that settles into a thin, but tight layer. Belgian lace remains. Doughy, wort like malt and herbal hops dominate the aroma, with subtle, but bright juicy undertones of guava. Clean and pleasantly fruity aromawise. Surprisingly assertive hop bitterness hits the palate at first, then fades into a melange of pseudosweet dextrins, bready base malt and light residual sweetness. Floral hop flavor extends from the lingering hop bitterness. Lightly bodied, with well calculated dextrins facilitating a smooth, but crisp mouthfeel. Finishes mostly dry, with briefly lingering suggestions of maltose like wort sweetness ceded by a mineral laced hop bitterness. Kiwanda Cream Ale is not a complex brew, but flavorful and light on the palate. The higher than norm hop bitterness and squeaky clean overall character lend it superb quaffability.","marc77","0"
