That aside, it's really a terrific everyday session beer. Basic enough to appeal to any palate, crafty enough to appeal to the more sophisticated beerman.

It's refreshing and works well on its own (cold) and maybe paired with bar food, but it's simplified with bizarre nuances (such as the bittered bite at the finish) to the point where it wouldn't be something I could have as casually as I wished. Perhaps it's TOO toned down even to style, for better for worse. It definitely lacks the charm that makes their Summer Ale highly drinkable.

Grassy hops make up the bulk of the flavor, but there is a slight buttery creaminess that smooths the edges out. Mild bready aftertaste.

The nose is of cereal-like grains and some bitter, earthy hops. Corn sweetness and some undercooked bread are also present. On the palate, corn sweetness and undercooked white bread lead the way before a decent hop bitterness helps to cut through the sweetness mid palate, however more corn/cereal grain sweetness comes back in the finish. Light bodied with mild carbonation. A smooth, crisp beer with a drying finish. A pretty good cream ale, but I wish it was a little less sweet in the finish.

It's got a nice creaminess and grainiess, but it's got the right amount of bitter hops to stop it from being cloying while letting the cream aspects shine through.

Aromas are roasted and creamy, with a subtle sweetness that compliments the biscuits backbone. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a dark, almost char highlight on the sweet and subtle creamy characteristics. Toasted grain flavors throughout, with a slight sour tang to it. The body is light and smooth until the end, when the carbonation gets the best of the beer, leaving a slight sharp finish in mouth. The aftertaste is a subtle roasted sweetness that remains light.

3.59,2.3,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Honestly, I wasn't too impressed with this beer until I had it a few times. The most interesting thing about this beer is the mouthfeel. I guess I like this about as much as Narragansett Lager. Sadly, it's not as good as some of the seasonal offerings.","angrybabboon","Mar 17, 2012"

A refreshing tasting ale with solid carbination, a mild hop, and smooth...this is an above average everyday lawnmower beer.","Ptelea","Mar 10, 2012"

3.45,-1.7,3,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Just got a sixer of tallboys for 8 dollars. Pours with a nice frothy head. No spectacular smell to speak of, but boy oh boy what a great mouthfeel. Nice and creamy. Flavor is pretty good, seems to be stuck in that nonlight beer "light" flavor category. Minimal hop bitterness but still a good flavor throughout. I like it now but I suspect in the summer I'll be pounding these regularly. Definitely better than its contemporaries (Wexfords, Genny Cream). Bit of trivia, the cans are made in new york but the draft beer is produced by Providence's Trinity Brewhouse. I'm eager to try that as well. Regardless, I'm happy for Cream's year round availability.","bullwinkle88","Mar 08, 2012"

A real nice creamed corn and hop bitterness flavor, This is old school cream Ale from back when I was young. Not a Hop machine but a really flavorful smooth Cream Ale you can sit down and drink a few. In your mouth it is smooth and so refreshing and finishes with a nice back and forth sweet and bitter taste. I highly recomend trying this one. Over all I give it a 4.5. Narragansett sure is bringing out some awesome beers. You can just picture sitting down and drinking a few of these on a hot Saturday afternoon!","Schmidts","Mar 07, 2012"
3.45,-1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"16oz tall boy. Pours a clear yellow color with a 1/4 inch of head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of sweet grains, malts, and a bit of floral hops. Tastes alot like the Narragansett Lager but with a bit more sweetness and hops. Has some of that cream ale lactose sweetness to it. Light mouthfeel and body. Its a decent beer with many similarities to the Lager. Not the best of 'Gansett's newest line of beers but still solid and worth keeping a bunch of in the fridge.","PicoPapa","Mar 06, 2012"

3.88,10.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"16oz. can served in a tulip nonic. Pours a lovely, translucent straw gold with a one inch, tight, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a consistent skim. Swaths of lacing are revealed during the session. Nose is very subdued - light grassy notes and cereal grains. Tate consistent with nose; however a noble hops presence is also expressed, as well as a light citrus character and a trace of something metallic. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation that leaves a residual prickle across the tongue. Overall a really solid session beer at a great price. I can see adding this beer to my budget line-up.","Jwale73","Mar 01, 2012"

Hoppier in both aroma and taste than I was expecting, not that it is an exceptionally big hop presence, but you can not mistake the fact that it is there. Nice smooth and solid hoppy cream ale flavor. Easy drinking. Really a great session Ale counter point to their standard Lager. Will definitely be purchasing again.","jrobidoux","Feb 27, 2012"

I could see this being a brew I would tote around especially when I may be sharing with a group of friends who aren’t huge craft advocates. Haven’t had many Cream Ales, but this is a pretty decent addition to their lineup.","VelvetExtract","Feb 20, 2012"
3.3,-6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Not much of a head, light colored ale, lots of bubbles. Nose is light hoppy, creamy, pilsneresque. Not to much nose though. Very nice flavor, creamy as expected, lots of effervescence, big bubbles too. Light on the tongue. Pilsner type hop, actually off you had told me this was a lager I would have believed you. Easy drinking, standard as far as cream ale is concerned, reminds me of when we used to drink Wexford cream ale back in the day (2003.) Solid.","redleaves","Feb 18, 2012"
