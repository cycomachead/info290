Tastes like cheap beer, stronger than a Coors light, but less than say a Rolling Rock. Simple and grainy with little satisfying merits. Thin and moderately carbed with a wet finish that lingers longer than I'd prefer. Seems like a decent pairing with the shitty jack in the box I have beside me.","harrymel","Mar 17, 2013"

Looks like it's brewed in Milwaukee now--hence the standard brown longnecks and even the cardboard on the 12 pack is now that really thin stuff-- clearly a different plant. They also added Milwaukee, WI on the bottle. This stuff was really nasty-- even the smell, immediately it just smelled like cheap beer. Sad.","twloco","0"

I loved it right off the bat and have been buying it ever since. I tried 2 half cases of the BROWN BOTTLE Blue Boar and will never drink it again! And neither will my daughter. I don't like the heavy taste and I get extremely bloated off the first bottle or two. Have you changed the recipe to try a 'new and improved' version of this? YUK! The green bottle Blue Boar had such a light crisp sparkling taste to it. My daughter even tried a switch and bait taste test and picked out the brown bottle after sipping them both. We DON'T like it.

2.67,-6,2.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"very clear and golden color upon pouring. a thin fizzy head doesn't stick around too long. light bread and nut aroma makes it at least appealing. light toasted malt flavors ride a medium and fairly smooth and creamy mouthfeel. a light crispness in the end. hops are present, but only around the edges of perception. not all that great tasting, but easily drinkable. nothing i will be drinking again, though.","budgood1","Feb 26, 2002"
3.25,14.4,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,4,"This golden-colored ale poured with a very thin head that evaporated within moments of landing in my glass. A bit of a skunky aroma to it but the taste is decent enough to enjoy more than one beer.","sinistersteve","Feb 12, 2002"
2.45,-13.7,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Gassy and very thin, somewhat metallic mouthfeel, leaves an unsettled feeling in my stomach...I never knew it was supposed to be a cream ""ale"" so now I know why my expectations were never met...the ""Red Lager"" and ""Private Reserve"" are not much better, they used to do a Porter which was at least mediocre...","ADR","Beers"
2.03,-28.5,2.5,2,2,2,2,"Straw-yellow and clear appearance.  Odd assortment of skunkiness, malts, and citrus and spice.  I don't mind skunky beers like St. Pauli and Grolsch, but this is almost alien.  Very thin body.  Crisp with boring tones of plain barley malt and honey.  Oh well...  It gave me a buzz...","Jordan","0"
