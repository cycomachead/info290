"Pretty good. Really malty with a slight lager taste. Not my thing but alright"
""
"Overall: Creamy texture makes it so easy to drink, but still has plenty of roasted malt flavors to keep it interesting."
"Meh. Not a fan. A bit off."

" Overall I still need more cream ales on my resume. This one is the best one I've had yet. The 4 pack o' pint format is awesome and I will definately be purchasing this again"

"A flavorful vienna cream ale, a definite step up to something local that will knock Boston Lager or a Karl Stauss amber off its perch. While a bit too heavy to session this hard, I'd be proud hand one of these to anyone."

"Overall this was my favorite beer tasted there. I really believe that Hess could make this signature beer as it is very unique for what San Diego has to offer."

"Pours a slightly murky orange-brown with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, grain, and some slight caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but nothing all that exciting."

"Lively carbonation on a medium body makes for crisp drinking. Smooth and subtly creamy mouthfeel overall despite the carbonation. Very well done take on a simple classic style. Session beer, Hess style."

"Fortunately, this is nothing like any Mexican beer I've had. More rich and malty than you're likely to encounter with a burrito. At first sip, a plain malty stew that needs a crisp touch. Grows in dimension as you sip. Lovely amber color. With a bigger head and maybe a dose of shy hops this could be the ideal American Amber beer. Still, it's quite drinkable and clean."
"Overall: An interesting mixture of characteristics that work well together. Unlike any other Cream Ale I've had, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Light brown with a creamy white head. Smells of grains and malts. Taste is similar to a stout without any intense roasted flavors, very creamy and refreshing. Silky smooth mouthfeel, to be expected on nitro. Overall pretty good sessionable beer with a lot of flavor, this was my first in this style so I wasn't sure what to expect but defiantly enjoyed it."
"Overall I have been happy with everything I have had at Hess. Grazias Vienna Cream Ale is no exception. Bring home a growler/prowler and pull it out of the fridge 5 mins before you pour. You will like it."
"O: I enjoyed it, it was good. Lager's, to me, are generally light, simple, refreshing, but with light flavor. In contrast to the simple part, this beer actually has a lot more going for it than is typical, but is still smooth, and refreshing, and creamy."
"O-Solid beer overall, although I wish the initial flavors were more distinct. Because they did not really stand out to me, I can't say it was anything more than an average beer. I enjoyed it though, would buy a growler to take home."
