3.61,-2.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Can. Golden body with a slight haze and a thin ring of white head. Aromas are pretty muted, as the beer is quite cold. Grain and lightly tart apples. Light sweetness finishing with a meld of bittering hops and fruity sweetness. Pretty good.","Huhzubendah","Dec 28, 2014"

Taste is crisp, grapefruit, light hops, refreshing and smooth. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is solid brew, one I probably would have enjoyed more in the summertime.","tone77","Oct 20, 2014"

3.5,-5.4,,,,,,"I love hearing the Crack! since that is one of the many things that make CANned beer so special. It was yet another brimful CAN and to celebrate, I CANducted an inverted pour. My efforts created two foamy fingers of soapy, bone-white head that fell fairly quickly, leaving great lacing in its wake. Color was a bright sunshine-like Yellow (SRM = 4) and by “bright”, I mean NE-quality clarity. Nose had notes of grapefruit and pineapple and my mouth was watering. Mouthfeel was medium. The nose really translated to taste in this case. It had a light grapefruit bitterness initially, followed by a pineapple sweetness in the mouth. Finish was semi-dry, not really sweet enough to be CANsidered otherwise. Tis was a great Summertime beer, easy drinking and one that I could have used this afternoon when doing yard work.","woodychandler","Aug 23, 2014"

2.16,-41.6,3,2,2,3,2,"I wanted to like this locally-brewed six pack of cans, cleverly marketed for the Independence Day weekend for which I bought it. I had delusions of sitting shirtless in the backyard with these in an icy cooler by my side. But it tastes like an inside joke of ""let's put Natty Boh in a craft can and see how it goes over."" Sour. Only grudgingly drinkable. I think a better craft salute to American mass market beer could be done.","Aerocraft67","Jul 03, 2014"

Tastes of barley with a little bit of hop bite, mainly piney. Beer is light bodied and extremely drinkable, nice carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.","cyclonece09","Apr 26, 2014"
