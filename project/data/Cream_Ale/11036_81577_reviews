"Overall, I found this to be a pleasant enough drink, and I'm more than glad to finish the 6 pack. But, if you hadn't told me it was a strawberry beer, I'm not sure I'd have realised it was- it's very subtle. I'm not saying that I'd like it to taste like strawberry syrup, but if something's gonna call itself ""Carolina Strawberry," I'd expect the berry taste to be somewhat more prominent than it is in this beer."

"I've thought of something that might salvage the experience, though. This would contrast very well with cheese cake. On its own, however, I can't recommend it."

"O - definitely not a Beatles song as they do strawberry fields better than anyone and as this was inspired by NC's fields of strawberry I think they could have given a bit more with this offering. It really has roots to be great but simply lacks a bit of complexity and texture. Overall a good choice on a hot day sitting in the sand as I was, but not something ill be packing a bunch of back home."

"this is the 2nd time that i have had this beer. the first time i dont think i liked it too much. this time however, it strikes me as a little better. the color is nice a cloudy blonde. hands down the best thing about it is the smell... it smells like sweet strawberries...perfect for summer. the taste is a little sour for me. i mean it isnt terrible but there is a tartness there that i dont really like that much. i feel like the smell promises sweetness and the taste delivers a real tartness. i know other people dont dig on the really sweet beers- so this all comes down to personal taste- if you like a more sour fruit beer by all means go for it. on a side not i have had other beers by foothills and they have some great ones.... if you get a chance you should really check their stuff out."

"A good beer. About what I expected. One I would get again, but maybe on tap. These bubbles are wearing on me."

"O: Pretty decent offering that combines nice natural fruit with a cream ale - I enjoyed it and think it would be a nice easy drinking summer beer (good for cooking out, maybe after the meal is served like a dessert)."

"Take that away, and youve got one hell of a beer."
"This has, in my opinion, never been a great beer. The change of ownership seems to have not made a difference. It seems it's quite the same recipe with the same artificial fruit aroma and flavor. I'll avoid in the future."

"O: Meh, forgettable. Itâ€™s a decent beer for a cream ale just not amazing and overall the style is somewhat unimpressive anyway."
