"It works as a summer refresher, but it's nothing that i would seek out."

"Taste-Pale malt, faint wheat, very light-bodied, almost watered -down mouthfeel. faint corn sweetness in the finish. Would be a notch above a macro brew in my book."

"135 calories per bottle at 4.5% ABV. Unique Cream Style Ale with a light lager taste. The immediate taste is reminiscent of has cream beer taste with a slight compliment of lemon. The aftertaste is a bit below average and the smell is undesirable. Worth a try but not something I would go out-of my way to find."

"Bottle says ""malt beverage with natural flavors added"". According to their website, there is no mention of fruit or spices or anything other than grains, hops, water and yeast involved. No freshness dating either. Pours to a thin but lasting white head with erratic lacing. Color is pale straw, almost like Bud Light. Aroma is grainy and biscuity with a slight butter tinge to it. Flavor is bland and weak but pleasant enough, just merely better than a light macro lager. Finishes super dry and slightly parching. Mouthfeel is so-so. Overall, I would classify this beer as a very weak but drinkable summer lawnmower brew. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just boring light ale and to be honest, I'd be very pleased to homebrew something this light and refreshing and technically pure. Honestly, I'd take a Schlafly Kolsch or Boulevard Wheat over this in half a heartbeat though."

"O- This beer has a great summer sessionable beer that has lots of nice soft flavors that support the lagered Noble hops flavor that is dominant."

"Easy drinking beer that maintains some flavor. Would go down nicely on a hot summer day after doing some yardwork."
"Very faint toastiness from the malt also get flavors of unmalted barley and some lactose. There's some adjuncty tasting bitterness on the finish. The palate is smooth but watery. This beer is easy to drink and uncomplicated."
"Tail or no, I could never get my kites to fly all that long. Man, I had a kinda sad childhood... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises cracked wheat, sweet oats (not unlike a sweetened version of Cheerios or some other cereal), and a hint of grass. The taste basically brings in more of the same, along with a vague fruitiness that detracts from the sweet, grainy notes that have been forced into the background. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly drying finish. Overall, a generally solid beer, but one whose surprise and oddball fruitiness keeps it from achieving anything close to greatness."

"Poured this cream Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear straw color,produced a average white head, average retention and left no lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of cereal grains and sweet fruit. Light in body, this cream ale had a base of grains, some caramel, fresh fruit, and earthy hops. Smooth mouthfeel, nice summer beer- flavorful example of the style."

"Overall: I have only had about ten cream ales, but this one is near the tail end of them that I would choose. It is an ok beer beer for a hot day, but it is missing some of the flavor and body that others in this style have. Not a bad beer, but there are several others in this style I would go to first."
""
"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of strong pale malt, hint of hop, hint of cream, and a hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of cream, pale malt, hint of rice?, and a hint of hop. Overall, weak body and the aroma is lacking."
""
"Overall Impression- Very refreshing, sweet, and has a ton of fruits that I canâ€™t put a finger on. A light one for this summer but seems to be a hot item in St. Louis!"

"O: I'm no cream ale expert, but this seems to be a very representative entry for the style. Just a little watery, but you get all the drinkability of a BMC without the awful flavor. A great summer 'lawnmower' beer."

"O - This is a nice cream ale. It is better than most cream ales that I've tried."
"O: Nice inoffensive summer ale that goes down easy. Goes best with BBQ."
"Overall a great addition to the O'Fallon lineup. I'm not as passionate about this as I am their Hemp Hop Rye or their Black Hemp beers. Still, an easy drinking summer beer that's cheap on the wallet is hard to pass up."

"OVERALL: A nice new addition to the O'fallon lineup, this summer ale would be perfect at any time, though especially during the warmer months. Would pair nicely with a garlic y shrimp scampi."
