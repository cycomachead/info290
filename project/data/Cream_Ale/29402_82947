The very mild taste is slightly sweet, just tangy enough to make the mouth water but not withdraw, hint of lemon, slightly bitter edge. And it feels creamy. I added a thin slice of lemon partway through. With the lemon I would give it an extra half point, especially on a hot day. It could be crisper/more carbonated.","Callipygea","May 30, 2014"

Aroma of bready, biscuit malt, corn adjunct, sweet; standard light beer. Taste follows aroma, mild sweet malt, grains, fairly subdued, finishes with slightly more robust grainy malt and a hint of grassy hops. Light bodied. Cream ales seem to be craft beer's attempt at adjunct lager and this one fits the mold. Pleasant and a bit more flavorful than an adjunct beer, but nothing inspirational. Fine for lunch.","LiquidAmber","Nov 22, 2013"

Wheat, grain are the forefront of a mild ale. It's not offensive in any way and has a fairly clean finish. I'm looking for other things to say about it. It seems a step or two above a mass produced adjunct lager. Would be easy to swig down a six pack right now in November in MN or on a hot summer day. Cheers,","JackieTH","Nov 02, 2013"

2.88,-14.5,3,2.5,3,3,3,"I first became acquainted with the style of cream ales LONG BEFORE I was an experienced beer snob. SCENE: 1979 beach bum w/ bent antenna static box blaring pop AM and a cooler filled with iced ponies of BLATZ LIGHT CREAM ALE. Beach bum? ...me. Now THAT was a tasty beer...course I didn't care much for the domestic American swill passed off as "beer" back in those days...so this beer was like an enlightening premium craft at the time - it beat out Little Kings by a long shot. Unfortunately, it is long gone now. The Cream Ale Style is suppose to be a category that I would basically describe as...lagered ales. Top fermented ales that are cold conditioned/stored. I think it is a category any home/craft brewer could have a fun and creative craft with. That said, "Rise to the Top" by the Third Street Brewhouse should be a basis for a continuation of exploring this style; but not an end result. I only have Blatz Light Cream Ale and Little King's for comparison - and they are very distant memories - and Blatz is STILL winning the memory! Course, I'm not a wheat beer fan either - so I'd give this a try if you are looking for something different. And ANYONE having a copycat recipe for Blatz Light Cream Ale - pop it to me, will ya!","GoldHorde","Dec 31, 2012"

Any ways, it's crisp and light, with a mellow bready, almost yeasty malt character that's somewhere in the neighborhood of dough and fresh-baked break. There's a macro-like touch, as is appropriate, with the sweet, dry finish. This is a fine example of the style, and a likely summer crowd-pleaser.","tempest","Aug 05, 2012"

It is on the lighter side, but fits that style nicely. The taste is similar to the aroma, but considerably stronger. The aftertaste is full of nice round malty flavors that really make the thought of taking another sip sound appealing.
