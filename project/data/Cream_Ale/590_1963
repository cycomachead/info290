Pours like a normal lager. Golden in color. Big white head. The aroma is kind of yeasty and citrus fruits. Fairly bitter tasting. Really has flavor all around the tongue. Would recommend anyone visiting the south west area of Wisconsin to not only visit the New Glarus Brewery, but also the town itself, as it is a charming Swiss like town.","kkleu357","Sep 04, 2014"

But now approaching it with an open mind, it is easy to see why this is such a popular beer by the masses, and should be equally popular with geeks.  A perfectly executed cream ale should be highly drinkable with creamy decadent malts and a splash of hops, which is exactly what the cow brings.  No longer will I discredit this beer because everyone loves it, which was a ridiculous thing to do in the first place, but instead enjoy it often for its truly wonderful characteristics.","KFBR392","Aug 24, 2014"

The lightness and malt favor of the corn is readily apparent, and drinks as such.  I kinda hate to say it, given how awesome New Glarus is, but I got a lot of High Life/PBR similarities from this one.  Appearance is awesome, but falls short on flavor.","UnionMade","Aug 21, 2014"

4.24,13.7,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,"This is a great example of how a farmhouse ale should taste. I've had this beer probably a hundred times and enjoy it everytime. Has a color similar to shiner bock. As a nice foamy head that sticks to the sides of the glass and kelt recedes to the beer. When you smell it, it almost smells like a farm (corn stalks, hay, wheat)! When you have your first taste, I pick up hints of corn and a bit of hops to finish. Has a nice even texture when sliding off the back of your palate down your throat. Doesn't have any twist at the end, but a beer I like to drink on the back porch on an evening, while looking out at the lake. Would recommend this to anyone who likes farmhouse style beers.

Mild aroma of biscuit malt, grains, hints of citrus. Flavor is very pleasant semi-sweet bready malt, slight grassy hops, lightly buttery wheat, faint citrus. Finishes with mellow sweet malt and wheat. Unexpectedly moderate creamy body with a great mouth feel. I see why locals are so happy about this ale. This is the beer that I think the mass producers *think* they are brewing, simple, mellow and pleasantly drinkable. When I'm this satisfied with a style that I'm not that excited about, the brewers have really excelled. Easily the best cream ale I've ever had. Nicely done.

Smells of sweet grain and corn, not like an adjunct but with a nice grain profile. Tastes of nice grain with just enough corn for sweetness. Beer is crisp and clear light bodied and perfectly carbonated. Overall a pretty good beer.","cyclonece09","Nov 10, 2013"

In my opinion this beer tastes like what you would get if you tried to make Bud light with all very high quality ingredients. It was good, but very bland. There isn't anything you can complain about in it. It's even very drinkable, and I could probably drink this all night if it was available. But I really like a bit more flavor in my beer.","ryho","Oct 15, 2013"

I don't know what style I would have guessed this to be, but it doesn't taste like any Cream Ales I've had... then again, I haven't had a craft Cream Ale, I don't think. Uh. That probably makes a difference. This has that ""beer"" color -- sunset orange. There's about two or three fingers worth of a creamy looking head. Lacing is above average. Nice start... gotta love a good looking beer. The smell is initially what made me wonder what the damn style was. Mild grassy/earthy hops and Play-Doh/dough just about hit the aroma on the head for me, although seeing others mention banana and clove isn't a surprise... I can see that. Taking a sip, I get the same thing. How does a beer that has a pretty big ""dough"" profile taste good? Leave it to New Glarus. While I'm not a huge fan of this, it's memorable. I'm pretty confident that I won't taste another beer quite like this. A respectable beer.","Alextricity","Jul 07, 2013"

This golden goodness of this beer has a hint of citrus and is slightly sweet and with a touch of hops to bring your taste buds all together and cheer. Sad that I can't get this beer here in Chicago, but at least it gives me a reason to go to Milwaukee to pick up a few cases when visiting friends. So great to enjoy on the back porch when listening to some Blues records on a summer day. Made my birthday just golden today.","bluesbrewsguys","Jun 16, 2013"

It's far from spectacular tasting, but it's a good representation of what it is. Mouthfeel is thin-medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is essentially the high end version of your average light lager.

Taste is lemony, and citrus and grains in good balance but as expected, not really that hop forward (I'm missing more bitterness volume...next up must be an IPA), but satisfying nevertheless. Mouth-feel is refreshing, alcohol is light, carbonation is more muted, finer and not at all scrubbing.

I appreciate the beer for how well-crafted it is, which reflects in the review, but I appreciate the business behind it much more so; if it allows them to do all the other terrific beers I'm in love with, then so be it! With that said, Spotted Cow appeals to the masses wonderfully with it's fuller-than-light-beer but not-intrusive flavor and creamy, easy drinking body. They call it a Wisconsin Farmhouse Ale which fits with their ""drink indigenous"" theme (which I'm all for!) but I certainly wouldn't liken Spotted Cow to what people typically understand as a Farmhouse Ale or, Belgian Saison. But hell, it sells outrageously and people come from out-of-state to buy it by the case-load, so what do I know?","BeerFMAndy","Jul 10, 2012"

Also worth noting is that the Cow really varies, sometimes from bottle to bottle, batch to batch, and certainly from tap to tap; some glasses are really delicious and deserving of a 4-4.5, but most are somewhere between 2-3.5, sadly. If drunk on the porch on a hot summer day, this otherwise mediocre beverage gains roughly .5-it is that refreshing. 13/20","THANAT0PSIS","Jun 14, 2012"

The nose is full of yeasty bread and a bit of corn. There isn't a lot of malt in the nose or the taste. Perhaps the best part of this beer is its mouthfeel. The body is really smooth and lightly carbonated. A really enjoyable brew.","TubaManJack","May 25, 2012"

Lighter than many New Glarus alternatives, but brewed with the same care and attention to detail. The beer very flavorful, without overpowering. The beer also has a subtle, yet warming creamy mouthfeel - especially noticeable if served slightly warmer the typical serving temperature.","ErinSpace","May 16, 2012"

The smell of the beer had some very light hop aromas but were mostly covered by the sweet malt character this brew has. The taste of the beer screamed cream ale right off the first sip to me. It's slightly sweet with a grainy malt flavor with just the lightest amount of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was light bodied, easy going, drinkable and nicely carbonated. Overall this beer is one that you could drink a lot of if you choose too. It's a refreshing brew and can be enjoyed just about anytime of the year.","Knapp85","Apr 25, 2012"

This would be a good craft to throw at a mass beer drinker to get them into craft. I'd much rather have this than a Bud or something - so don't get me wrong - it's not bad just nothing really exciting.

Pours a clear, pale golden color, thick with smoky swirls of sediment and a generous fluffy bone white head. As the head fades it leaves very little lacing and settles as a thin ring with light webs of lacing. Aroma is very mild and non-descript. Mild sweetness and grain dominate what little presence the nose has; really this smells like any other non-offensive macro lager. Flavor is an interesting sweet and mildly fruity take on a typical lager. Sweet grains and malt dominate with a smooth, dry finish with non-existent hops or bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium full, creamy and thick in the finish with mild carbonation. Overall this beer is remarkably unremarkable, other than the intense creamy finish.","yourefragile","Aug 17, 2010"

On the other hand, the mouthfeel and drinkability are suberb! You can't ask for much more from a brewery's flagship beer. I still see it as inferior to the likes of Dancing Man and Crack'd Wheat, but only slightly, which mainly attests to how excellent those seasonal beers are.

I've always thought of Spotted Cow as the microbrew for people who only drink Miller Lite. It's a gateway micro I guess, which isn't a bad thing. This is a light beer.

It might not be complex or bursting with flavors but it's still quite good. It's sweet like the smell and a hint of fruityness lingers. It's quite refreshing actually. If this one were available in my area I would drink it more often. A low ABV and refreshing this is one I wouldn't mind drinking all night.

Pours a golden body with a small white head with okay retention and no lacing. Smells sweet with lots of cereal grain along with fruitiness. Taste is about the same as the smell, the hops add a small amount of bitterness but grain and fruitiness are still the dominant flavors. Strong carbonation that doesn't show in the appearance, almost too bubbly for me, got distracted from the taste. Pretty drinkable though, however not being a huge fan of the flavor I wouldn't drink a ton.","AdmiralDiaz","Mar 24, 2009"

The head dissipated rather quickly. The aroma is a tad lemony and a lot of light malt. The flavor is even tamer. I don't hate it, and it's possible that this beer is quite good very fresh. It's certainly not a bad beer. I would have preferred it served a bit colder, and it's certainly not difficult to drink. There are no real off flavors. I don't know if corn is as an adjunct grain in this beer, but it has a similar bland favor to corn.","popery","Mar 16, 2009"

Smells of wonderful sweet wheat, honey, orange, and a little of the trademark banana in every wheat ale. Obviously North American yeast, hardly any Belgian nose that you typically find in wheat ales, but then again New Glarus has always been good at breaking traditions. First taste is smooth wheat and mild yeast, not quite as sweet as it smells but certainly not dry either. The citrus and honey come out after a moment, and linger just a little bit after the finish. Somewhere between light and medium body, wonderfully smooth, full and balanced flavor, and just all-round delicious. This has to be my favorite wheat ale so far.","Thanby","Feb 25, 2009"

I knew I recognized the smell; I just couldn't place it, then all of a sudden. Bam. This beer smells like corn, and tastes very much like sweet corn. There was almost no discernable hop presence. The mouthfeel is light and a bit dry. I would rather have this as a local easy drinker then the BMC stuff we get around here.

I am not normally a fan of cream ales, but I figured what the heck and decided to give this one a shot. It poured a very nice cloudy and very light yellow, almost a white color. A large three finger head of fizzy white lace formed on top and then it faded quickly leaving behind just minimal lace on the top, but adequate side glass lace. Lots of visible carbonation was apparent. The aroma was very light, and somewhat sweet. Not really too much to pick up, maybe some light malts and a touch of bread but that was it, the style is not really know to be very full. The taste was very light, and refreshing. A touch of yeast or light fruit graced the opening of a very carbonated and light bodied ale. This was more refreshing then anything and it served that purpose well. A somewhat muted taste, maybe a touch of sugar and almost a cola like flavor in the back. Overall this was not bad. As I mentioned I am not really a fan of the style, but this was the best I have had from it, with maybe the exception of the Terrapin Golden Ale. This was pretty good though, and I could see it used while mowing the lawn in July kind of thing. Not bad and give it a try if you get a chance.","mikesgroove","Nov 07, 2007"

No real hop flavoring to speak of, but I can pick up on the grain and lemony sweetness going down. The mouthfeel is actually quite nice and smooth and very easy drinking.

3.15,-15.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Received as part of a mixed sixer trade with the mighty nflmvp -- big thanks, Steve! I really like the brewers' claim on the label that this is a ""Wisconsin farmhouse ale"". Seems as appropriate an appellation as any for a Cream Ale brewed with corn and flaked barley. Pours a hazy golden color with an active, short-lived, snow white head. Nothing too complex in the aroma: soured bready grains with a bit of grassy hop scent on top of a slightly sweet-smelling caramel malt quality. Sort of like an uninspired Pale Ale. Earthy bready flavors become apparent at first sip, rounding out into a sweetish malt taste punctuated with mildly spicy and grassy hops. Candy corn and vanilla sweetness arrives at the finish, highlighting the sort of sticky mouthfeel of this beer. Medium body seems a little thick for the flavor profile, thereby setting back the drinkability. Certainly not a bad beer, and I get the sense that it pays many of the bills so that we can enjoy such world class offerings as the Wisconsin Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart. Nothing I'd seek out again, but certainly happy for the opportunity to have tried it.","orfeu","Nov 01, 2006"

3.65,-2.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"My first impression was that this beer is a wheat - the nose hints of wheat, it has a light, cloudy amber color and it tastes like a wheat. Not as intense as a true wheat, carbonation is light, starts as a mix of malt and hops and finishes fairly smooth and sweet. Moderate head that leaves little lace. The brewer has barley and corn in it so I don't know where the wheat overtones come from.","jdhilt","Sep 29, 2003"
3.02,-19,2.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"I had this one at a pub last weekend while I was in Milwaukee. It came to me with a hazy orangish-yellow color and had no head to speak of. That kind of scared me. As I drank it I noticed that this one seemed rather light in body. I gave a sip to one of my buddies who hardly ever drinks beer, and it's Michelob Light when he does, and he said it was light. My other buddy had a Sam Adams. I tried his and realized that the Sam Adams was much thicker and tastier than the Spotted Cow. The Spotted Cow had an estery aroma to it. Taste was predominately wheat malts but I did notice corn adjuncts in the flavor. No hops to speak of which might have been nice. The finish is quite good with a bready yeasty kick in it. For what it's worth this beer did go down really easy and I could easily drink another one and more after that. It wasn't bad, but not really my style.","granger10","Aug 04, 2003"
3.63,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Slighly hazy but not really cloudy medium yellow illuminated appearance. A couple of small chunks. Nice sheet laces. Yeasty and estery aromas, just suggestive, fresh, and not overwhelming. Malting is straightforward, a creamy sweetness with an underlying stuffy fruitiness, tending toward apricot. Hops are minimal at best, the mouthfeel carries on and finishes the flavor profile with more of the same, into the aftertaste. I'd classify as light to medium bodied, overall. Pleasant, popular -- but pretty sweet and unremarkable. I'd give session status to this widely consumed product.","ADR","Jul 15, 2003"
3.55,-4.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Smell is light, clean, and soft malts of sweetness, with a dulling floralness of hops dotted through each wiff. Taste is clean and creamy sweetness of softly done malts, kinda frothy grainyness, like intensely whipped cream malts or something, quite a appetizing feel, but it doesn't last I'm afraid, but the creamyness stays til the end where it cleans up with a touch of floral hops and goes dry; nice and easy, clean and creamy little drinker.","tavernjef","Jul 13, 2003"
4.1,9.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The beer pours a hazy orange-gold with decent head formation. The aroma is sweet and malty with a slight fruitness in the background, pleasant and unassuming. The taste is likewise sweet and malty, with a floral hop balance. Overall a very enjoyable ale that is also a very good session beer.","brakspear","Jun 08, 2003"
4.32,15.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This unfiltered beer looked much more cloudy in the 12 ounce brown twistoff bottle than it did once I poured it into my glass. The beer poured a slightly cloudy bright yellow. The head was fluffy white and not long lasting but it left a little lace on the side of the glass. The aroma of malt jumps out of the glass and fills your nose. What a joy. It makes the anticipation much greater. The taste lives up to the aroma. A sweet maltiness grabs your tongue and lingers in your mouth. The mouthfeel is medium light and has a slight creaminess. This is a great beer for pleasure and for a session. Too bad my friend only brought me one. DAMN!!!!","LarryKemp","Jun 06, 2003"
3.41,-8.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours out to a cloudy, golden color in the glass with a slight head, with some suspended particles floating in there. It does look appetizing in the glass, almost sunshine-like. Aroma is somewhat yeasty and musty. The taste is quite good. There is alot of malt here which lends itself to a slight sweetness. I detected some lemon in here as well. This is an easy to drink refreshing thirst quencher.","proc","May 23, 2003"
3,-19.6,3,3,3,3,3,"A slightly hazy light lemon yellow color as it sets in the glass; head is modest in size, frothy in texture and as it evanesces, leaves behind a silky sheet of lace. Sweet malt dominates the nose, fresh and clean to the senses with the start sweet and loaded with malt. Top is medium in mouth feel, finish has a light carbonation and the hops apropos to the style, nicely dry and drinkable.","Gusler","Mar 09, 2003"
3.95,5.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly cloudy golden hue with a quick fading white head. Leaves no lace, just a ""cling-ring"" and a small island of foam in the center of my glass. Noticeable corn aroma with an underlying fruitiness. Taste is somewhat malty; corn is noticeable too. No hop bitterness to speak of. Finishes somewhat dry and clean. Very refreshing and an easy drinker. It's too bad I won't be able to get this in Illinois or Indiana anymore. I will miss it.","cretemixer","Feb 05, 2003"
3.73,0,3.5,3,4,4,4,"One of my favorite offerings from New Glarus. Spotted Cow is a bottle conditioned farmhouse ale. Pours an unfiltered bright golden color with a white head that disappeared in a matter of seconds. Carbontation seen in the body. Fruity aroma with hints of corn and malt. Thin, yet crisp mouthfeel. Flavors primarily coincide with the aroma-- that being of corn and malt. Finish is sweet with practically no hop bitterness present at all. This is a wonderful all-around, easy drinking beer to be enjoyed anytime.","Winter","Jan 02, 2003"
4.18,12.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"New Glarus Spotted Cow: A wonderful “farm” ale, bottle conditioned, with yeast in the bottle. Appears to be a weiss beer, with a slight yeast/banana aroma. Very light tasting, with understated malts and hops creating a light citrus taste. Very easy to drink, very light and refreshing. This would be a wonderful beer in the summer, and very good all the time. Pick it up if you see it.","jackndan","Dec 06, 2002"
3.8,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I was given this beer by a friend to try, so I am not certain as to its age.  Clear golden color with minimal carbonation and some white sediment in the glass.  The smell was fruity/sweet, with slight hops undertones.  The taste was a bit more fruity, with malt playing more of a role.  Without much carbonation, the beer flows quite smoothly.  It is a refreshing beer and highly drinkable, especially on a hot summer day.","ryanocerus","Aug 16, 2002"
3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Although not my favorite, this is a solid offering from New Glarus. Its somewhat cloudy, pale color reminds me of a German hefe, but not quite. The smell isn't very appealing. Spotted Cow has a grainy aspect due to the addition of corn in the brewing process, which creates a somewhat prickly mouthfeel. This is a good choice for a hot day.","Jon","Aug 16, 2002"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"This golden bottle conditioned ale is quite a nice surprise.  The golden cloudy color due to suspended yeast gives off a cask-conditioned hop aroma.  Initially ester flavor touches the palate followed by a small smokey lager-like musky flavor.  The finish is light and sweet.  A nice refreshing ale.","beernut7","Aug 06, 2002"
3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a very light yellow color and formed a very nice white head that left some nice lace as it subsided.  A good bit of carbonation.  The aroma was lightly of citrus and malt, with a hint of hops.  The flavor was of citrus and a slight bit of malt and hops.  The finish was light and a touch bitter with some elements of the carbonation coming into play.  While not the best representation of this style, it makes a good summer session brew.","Wildman","Jul 30, 2002"
3.76,0.8,4,3,3.5,4,5,"This would be THE perfect keg to have at a summer get-together.  It is extremely smooth and easy drinking.  It is cloudy bright yellow...it poured charged up but doesn't taste that way.  The aroma is average at best and smells a bit like a macro (corn adjunct?)..The taste is pretty creamy and smooth...good but not overbearing maltiness, and very little hop bite on the finish....slides down very nicely...would be a GREAT session beer...I like this...I don't think it's the most complex or greatest tasting beer ever made but it is nice in its own right..","ZAP","Jul 01, 2002"
3.55,-4.8,2.5,2.5,4,4,4,"Light fruity, yet largely malt aroma.  Also a grainy, bready quality to it.  Yellow-gold and mostly clear with a thin head that disappears quickly, but leaves traces after each drink.  Flavor is mild overall.  Nothing particularly distintive about it. Malt taste with some fruitiness in undertones, with mild hop presence in bitterness.  Pretty quick finish.  Seems refreshing and smooth for summer, but in an ale way.  Feels fully carbonated, yet medium to thin. The more I drink it the more I like it.","garymuchow","May 31, 2002"

3.98,6.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer is getting a lot more popular lately in the central Wisconsin area...and I am gaining a growing appreciation of the New Glarus Brewing Company. A very smooth beer with a decent golden color. Has a light mouthfeel with very good drinkability. If you make it to WI try this one, you will appreciate it.","drizzam","Feb 02, 2002"
