The flavor was just off-putting for my taste, the apple/cider was overly sweet and completely unbalanced with the ale which left a strange aftertaste.

Didn't get too much from the aroma, possibly because I was mainly smelling the cleaning solution of the glass...unless that actually was the beer. But sticking my nose in a little further, I detected just a bit of apple sweetness, surely more juice-like than cider-like. Taste was moderately decent, with light apples, sugar, and pale malts. I didn't really get much of a ""cream ale"" feel from it, honestly. Pretty light in the mouth, and just a bit filmy. Decent overall and fairly drinkable, but a bit bland and watery for me.","Rifugium","Feb 26, 2011"

There was no need to lean in for a sniff – the nose was like having bitten into a Red Delicious. Color was a beautiful golden-amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with crisp apple tartness on the tongue. The label read “Cream Ale brewed with Apple Cider”, but the apple flavor was dominant. Finish was crisp and dry, but the effervescence lent it a quality that ordinary hard cider seems to lack. I am betting that the ABV is relatively low, making it perfect for a slow autumn afternoon.","woodychandler","Feb 25, 2011"

Do not remember many cream ales looking as good as this one. Aroma is a combination of green apples and cereal malt. The apple juice added something to this beer. It is well represented in the flavor as well. Adds an interesting, tart, green apple flavor that compliments the otherwise bland and uninteresting malt. Hop bitterness is non-existant. The beer may be just a bit undercarbonated for the style. Otherwise the body is good. A little bit more body than what is typically a lighter beer. Not something I could drink a lot of especially considering the high ABV. But a cream ale that is a little bit more interesting than most.","morimech","Nov 03, 2010"

The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall I think its a very drinkable beer, its a very easy drink and a nice change of pace. A great beer for sitting outside in slightly chilly weather.

Unlike other apple fruit beers (like Ephemere), where the apple tartness is balanced against the spiciness of a malt or yeast profile, here all we got to balance some surprisingly tart green apples is a tame cream ale malt profile.
