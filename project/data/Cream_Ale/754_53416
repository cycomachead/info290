Before I get started let me say that this is more like one of the sour ale styles or a fruit beer than a Cream Ale. In fact it puts me in mind of a Berliner Weissbier. It also reminds me slightly of Boulevard\'s Hibiscus Gose, though not of that quality. Is this brewed with Lactobacillus? Aroma is very thin & weak biscuit malt, with a sour note that suggests lemon & vinegar but nothing I would call cherry, some weak fruity hint is there, but my nose does not recognize it as cherry, black or otherwise. Taste is tart: Sweet tarts married to mineral water smothering hints of biscuit malt, honey & fruit that show up primarily in the finish. I can imagine a little cherry here. Afrertaste is rapidly fading mostly fruity tart & then nothing.  Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation producing a prickly bite, a little slick, dry & crisp.","mothmanscott","Feb 01, 2015"

2.76,-12.1,,,,,,"Another weak offering from Erie Brewing.  The initial rotting cherry odor assaulted my nose and nearly made me drop the bottle.  Fortunately it quickly dispersed leaving behind only a weak cherry odor.  After that, I was surprised that the beer actually didn’t taste completely horrible – what little cherry flavor was present rapidly gave way to a moderate maltiness.  The lack of lacing and the short-lived fizzy head were somewhat disappointing.   It seems a shame that, considering the proximity of Erie to the cherry and grape growing region of PA, no cherries were harmed making this beer.","Ozzylizard","Aug 07, 2014"

The black cherry is on the front and back and everywhere in between. It's in the smell, and it's all around. The aftertaste is somewhat tart and pretty sweet, with a malt body that reminds you that this is a beer and not some sort of a wine cooler. Make no qualms about it, this is a fruit beer. It's not a beer with fruit juice added, it tastes like fruit juice with beer added ... take that as you will. It's not an awful beer, but one was enough for me, and I doubt I could ever have more than two in a session. The dominance of the cherry makes this a super ""girly beer"". Some malt, lots of tart and sweet cherries. It's not bad by any means, but it's far from great.","Alextricity","Jul 11, 2013"

There's not too many other dimensions in here, it's a pretty simple brew. I wouldn't mind more cherry flavor, it's present on the beginning and leaves a slight lingering flavor, but for a ""black cherry ale", I expected more fruit.

2.98,-5.1,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Tasty, but nearly in the same was as are wine coolers or fruit flavored soda pops. The undefined base beer, slighted hop character, and syrup deriven cherry flavor causes the beer to side more closely with alcoholic soda pops than real ales.","BEERchitect","Oct 09, 2011"

2.73,-13.1,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"In general, I haven't been a fan of fruit beer. Unfortunately, this brew supports that predisposition. It's a pale copper color with a very slight, fizzy head. The aroma is strong with cherry (it reminds me of a chocolate covered cherry candy). It's go t a decent malt aroma, hidden beneath the cherry. It's not a beer-like aroma, however. The taste is moderately sweet, with a bit of twang. It's got some malt, and a lot of fruit. Still, it seem artificial and misplaced. It doesn't have a lot of balance, and just seem to miss the spot. Medium in body. All in all, it's not a really enjoyable beer...although it is interesting.","Suds","Aug 15, 2011"
3.14,0,3.5,3.25,3,3.5,3,"Morey's Bottom Line: Let me just say that the name ""Derailed"" should have been saved for a DIPA, Barleywine, or a RIS. Maybe even an Imperial version of Railbender?!","Morey","Jul 20, 2011"
2.49,-20.7,2.5,3.5,2,2,2.5,"Final Thoughts: I hate to say it like this, but it's almost like a four loko without the big alcohol. It just seems like candy cherry with malt. Not one of Erie's best I've had so far.","bpw28","Jun 22, 2011"
2.68,-14.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a bright light pinkish-orange color with a large fizzy, soda-like head that falls quickly into a very thin collar. Nose brings forward some fake cherry character and not much else. The flavor is strange with some artificial cherry and almost tastes like a cherry Tootsie Roll without the chocolate. Light body and plenty of carbonation. Interesting, but not something I'd drink very much of.","Thorpe429","Apr 20, 2011"
3.4,8.3,4,4,3,4,3,"I remember liking this better at the Beer on the Bay Beer fest in Erie PA last year (July 2010). It poured a Nice ruby and copper colored body with a super thick, frothy white head and bubbles floating from the bottom are visible. Aroma of cherries, malt, fruit, and maybe Wheat? Tastes just like it smells. Almost like a wine cooler, but I guess better. They go down quick, watch out for the 5%. I guess a good Summer beer. But a little too sweet.","beergod1","Jan 30, 2011"

In the taste, black cherry, not too sweet, more tart, and thin maltiness. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry hint of tart black cherry in the aftertaste. OK, but kind of thin with a decent cherry flavor.","OWSLEY069","Jul 31, 2010"

3.4,8.3,3,3,3.5,3,4,"On tap at The Tap Room on St. John, USVI. Poured a pale pinkish yellow color with a fizzy white head. Aromas of cherry, with a faint wet grain smell. Taste is quite pleasant and thirst quenching with cherry being the obvious dominating flavor. This basically tastes like soda with a mild malt flavor. Tasty if you are thirsty on a hot day but otherwise not much going on here.","lehows","0"
2.55,-18.8,3,3,2.5,2.5,2,"D: Overall drinkability was less then average by my regards, way to sweet and overbearing to consume more then 1 with even that being a struggle. Halfway through the drink I questioned if it was worth it to finish.","beerthulhu","Feb 06, 2010"
2.2,-29.9,4,1.5,2,3,2.5,"D: The mouthfeel makes me think that this could be a half-way decent ale if the overpowering sweetness of the cherry were toned down. Maybe I could use this in a chocolate cake.","speter","Jan 19, 2010"

3.8,21,4,4,4,3,3.5,"This is the ideal, refreshing fruit beer. Many fruit beers have a gross, nyquil taste, but Erie's black cherry smells, and tastes, like honest cherries. The rest of the beer has a mild, prickly carbonation and a simple, malty flavor. There's no head to speak of. It's like a tasty, malty, cherry soda that will get you drunk. That might not sound like much, but many breweries have tried, and failed, to craft it before. I will definitely have another, some day at the bar.","Dmorrison","Dec 20, 2009"

This beer is easy to drink, kind of like soda pop. In fact I think the label says it all: ""Malt Beverage with flavor added"". So does that mean it is not really beer ?? Do they add syrup to it after it is done ??","foamee","Dec 01, 2009"

The smell is more of real cherries and there is a hint of earthy hops. The taste is of a perfect amount of cherry and some earthy hops. The taste is very smooth and well balanced. The mouthfeel is slightly watery but not too bad with a moderate amount of carbonation.
