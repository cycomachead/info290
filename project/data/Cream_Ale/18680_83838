3.63,9.3,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,"i thought this a really serviceable cream ale, despite its low scores on here. the bottle popped open and the beer poured clear golden with some body into my glass, showing a solid half inch of lasting white head with decent ring lacing as i sip it down. the nose is sweet and fuller bodied, rich with grain character, fresh and bready, rustic even. the flavor is similar to the nose, with some longer lasting sweetness in small amount, and the slightest grassy hop presence in the finish. its rather basic beer, simple and not intended to be challenging, but it tastes real nice, and is supremely refreshing. carbonation is high, and it has enough body to satisfy a craft beer guy in addition to probably being quite appealing to the BMC drinker. good first beer from these guys, i have one other in my fridge i may dip into tonight.","StonedTrippin","Sep 12, 2014"

2.88,-13.3,3,2.5,3,3,3,"I needed more cream ales in my life (and down my gullet), so I grabbed some o' this stuff. Get some. It pours a clear sallow (damn, is this shit pale!) topped by nearly two fingers of almost glowingly white foam. The nose comprises mild corn, wild rice, vague sweetness, and a tiny touch of what may or may not have once been grass. The taste rebounds a bit, kicking that aforementioned sweetness up a notch and marrying it at various points with mild flowers and even milder corn. It may not sound all that appetizing, but it really ain't bad. Just...not all that great, either... The body is a hefty-feeling light, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly slick feel. Overall, this could have been a decent cream ale, but it seems as though MKE went in the cheaper direction, making something that doesn't even stand up nicely to Little Kings or Genny Cream. Yeah, it's not really bad, per se, just nothing I would readily call "good".","TMoney2591","0"
