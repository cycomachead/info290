3.32,-2.6,4,3.75,3,3.25,3.25,"Overall, this is hot weather bear and lawnmower beer. It has just enough tiny peaks of distinctive flavor where you are ok with it as you go thru the pint. Terrific structure, but I don't buy beer to just look at it. Had half the pint alone, then had the rest with a simple grilled burger, which completely dominated the beer to the point where I could have been drinking water. Lacks the richness of a true cream ale and intensity of flavor, but nothing you will hate either. Accept it if offered one, but don't seek this out.","OtherShoe2","Aug 23, 2013"

It has become just slightly sour and the herbal, spicy hops work nicely with everything else. I know that this isn't what a ""blonde"" ale is supposed to taste like, but it actually makes a pretty nice farmhouse ale.

It pours a bright gold with an intimation of haze (maybe more of a rumor) and topped by about a finger of white foam. The nose comprises bright corn syrup, wheat, and a very light dash of coriander. The taste ramps up the coriander, adding some lemon zest and cardamom, while maintaining the slight wheatiness and keeping the corn syrup to a necessary minimum.

3.82,12,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Cream ale? I'm not so sure of that descriptor for the style. This seems like a pretty standard, run of the mill, blonde ale to me with some slight deviations. It pours a nice reasonably clear blondish golden color with not much head and zero lacing. The nose is big time citrus with a malty under belly. The smell is nice, and has none of the metallic, or tinny qualities that are common with the style. The taste has a very slight lemony zing at the front end, but this segues quite nicely into a more malty and bready, almost doughy flavor. There is a grassiness to the beer, a slight lemony and spiced bite, but this is very subtle and it is mollified somewhat by the honeyed qualities that emerge as the beer settles. This is quite a smooth blonde ale that goes down easy. This isn't a complex beer, it is light bodied, refreshing, reasonably carbonated, nothing overly challenging on the palate, and a good summer type ale when the weather gets steamy.","albern","May 09, 2009"

It's very crisp, not a lot of lingering bitterness, but there is some. You could definitely put back a couple of these in the summer...in fact, right or wrong, I think I'd buy this more (""buy", as in, ""believe", not actually ""purchase"") as a summer release. Is that wrong? Either way, relatively tasty, very easy to drink, and could certainly be used as a ""gateway beer"".","corey0212","Aug 16, 2008"

It has a very dry, pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes clean. This is a very dry tasting beer. The mouthfeel is average. It's a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

I couldn't get over the metal, which was also present in the taste. It starts sweet, gets grainy, and the finish is metallic and dry. Actually, the dryness of the finish is probably the most remarkable thing about this beer -- it's a style that can be cloying, but Hooker's no nonsense where that goes. Even though I find it to be a bit crap for either a blonde or a cream ale, I could certainly put a couple of these back on a warm day due to the light body and the dry finish.","jbsteiny","Apr 23, 2007"

The beer is nearly as smooth as a lager but retains just enough malty character to make it taste like a true ale. Carbonation is high but right for the style.

You know that it's an ale - you can pick that up in the nose - but there is the chance that it could be a lager. Very nice. And it's balanced. So often blonde ales just miss the mark and end up too sweet and/or malty. Not this one. It pours a hazy golden body beneath a creamy bright white head that holds well and leaves some better than average lace about the glass. The nose displays a basic, grainy and straw-like malt with some grassy and lightly floral hops in the back. In the mouth it's medium bodied and crisp. The flavor offers a few more hops (still grassy and floral), but they're very well woven into the overall composition. Not too sweet, not too dry. And the maltiness doesn't stick around in the finish... it's very firm bitterness balances it and ushers in a quick, dry finish with just a swirl of short-lived, residual floral and spicy hops.","NeroFiddled","Nov 26, 2006"

3.52,3.2,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A flavorful version of the style and very pleasant on the palate. Nothing flashy. The style itself doesn't really do much for me, but this version is actually pleasant and a bit tasty.","NEhophead","Jan 01, 2005"
4.38,28.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear light gold, creamy white head stays for a bit and then settles, leaving a tight lace on the glass. Aroma makes me think of a vienna lager because of the strong honey-grain combo with some mustiness I get from some lagers. Flavor starts sweet with the honey accompanied by citrus and vanilla in just the right balance. Floral and spicy hops make a beautiful show. Bitterness appears and creeps in, but still leaves it on the sweet side. Medium body and creamy mouthfeel. Very pleasant drinking, this beer is damn good and will be a regular of mine once they get into Massachusetts.","waughbrew","Dec 15, 2004"
3.95,15.8,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Pale golden yellow color with a bright white head that rises to a half inch and slooowly settles down. Aroma is biscuity malt, some pear and butterscotch, and a faint grassy hop line. Flavor is chewy, with light sweet malts, some buttery corn, and a light cinammon backbone. A light hoppy tingle finishes it off, and a roasted corn thing lingers. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, and thin legs of lace run down the lenght of the glass.","far333","Dec 14, 2004"
3.98,16.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I could drink this all night to be honest. A perfect example of a session brew. But cream ale? More like a golden ale to me. Seek and drink.","necoadam","Dec 09, 2004"
3.43,0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"pours a gold straw color with a thin head. aromas were slight, but well balanced malt/hops. Tangy, crisp, refreshing taste. Well balanced, decent body and mouthfeel, mild hop finish. this is an unnasuming beer that was intended for the non-ba thanksgiving guests. All enjoyed it and I agree this would make a good session or quenching beer","counselor","Dec 01, 2004"

3.45,1.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer is a pale golden color. It has a bit of a head to it. Not too much in the aroma department. There is a bit of malt and a whill of some hops. Body is about medium. Taste is a bit malty, but a bit on the lighter side. No real bitterness to it, but maybe I'm getting numb from drinking too many Hop Devils. A really good session beer.","Boto","Jul 26, 2003"
