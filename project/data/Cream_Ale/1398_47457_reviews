"I can't drink this without saying that someone who doesn't like this beer doesn't like cream ales."
""
"have always been an average cream ale fan, however the Empire version with nitro on tap was surprising."
"Only diff - I gave it a higher rating!"

"perhaps the best cream ale I have encountered. on the nitro tap at blue tusk. it pours a cascading deep honey color with a lavish white head as thick as they come. perfect ring lacing behind in my schooner after every sip. the nose is rather subtle, a blend of malts on the lighter end of the spectrum, and a prominent English smelling ale yeast. I feel this before I taste it, smooth and refined, clean and bright, exceptional mouthfeel. the taste is just a peg less exciting. a straightforward light malt beer, very fresh, with just enough hops to keep it a beer. slight sweetness as it finishes, but a mute bready swallow is what is best describes this brew. maybe empires best offering. id like to see more of the cream ale style around. also, the nitro tap is the absolutely perfect format for a beer like this. great all year round, one of my new favorite Syracuse sessions."

"Overall: If only the taste was as good as the mouthfeel. Honestly, this one is still worth trying just for the smooth feeling it gives. But, alas, I can't get past that weird soapy flavor. For the record, no, the glass was not dirty with soap!"
"O: Easy to drink and sessionable, a great beer for a hot muggy summer day."

"o - Overall a pretty solid cream ale. Nice citrus and fruit in the nose and very malty taste, with an amazing mouthfeel. Would have it again."

"O: Very easy drinker, could pass for a good session beer. Nice for the style. A bit more flavor would have brought it home. Worth a try."
"O - This has decent drinkability. It is really creamy and it goes down quite easily. I think it being nitro-tapped really enhanced the creaminess. It isn't the most flavorful beer, but its pretty good for the style."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and is also very sessionable."
"The beer is pretty drinkable but not really what I like. If you like cream ales or nitro beers you should try it."
"Empire made a pretty good cream ale with this one, it certainly did not take long to get through."
"Notes: This is a perfect example of an American Cream Ale to me. Where something like Genesee Cream Ale falls short, this brew covers; ""mouthfeel THEN flavor", rather than ""slightly more interesting mouthfeel than mainstream beers, with the same flavor."" I really enjoyed this beer."
"The beer pours a beautiful pale gold color with a creamy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pilsner malt scent as well as some mild hop bitterness as well. It has a touch of malt sweetness. The taste is decent. Again, it has a light, easy drinking pilsner malt flavor as well as a good shot of hops. It seems as though it's a bit too hoppy for the style. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinker. I can't help thinking that this is their Skinny Atlas Light brewed with ale yeast."
"On-tap at the brewpub for $5 a pint. Appeared to be served on nitro with a tall white head that slowly faded into a clear blonde body. This is a simple and well-made cream ale, a real throw-back session ale. It just has a light bready character with a touch of earthy salt and pepper. The aroma is a little dusty, but this is a respectable brew."
"To me, this beer characterizes what brew pubs are all about - experimenting with beer styles that are not run of the mill, and brewing them well. I wouldn't have expected that I could feel this way about a cream ale, but this beer is awesome. It is fresh, clean, well-brewed, and displays an amazing delicate malt character, not to mention the great nitro feel. This beer was nailed!"
