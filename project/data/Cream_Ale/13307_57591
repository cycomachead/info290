That kind of change can buy you much better beer (and, by the same token, similar beers can be had at much more reasonable prices). Then again, who am I to tell you how to spend your money?","biegaman","Feb 13, 2015"

The mouth feel might be the main strength of this beer due to an interesting combination of malts.

Taste is also pretty tame with light cereal notes and smooth finish. Body is average for style with good carbonation. Not bad for style but really nothing that good to write home about.","Phyl21ca","Dec 12, 2014"

I suppose it's not surprising that Mikkeller has managed to produce one of the most impressive cream ales I've ever had in my 8+ years on this site - and it's a good thing, because at this price point I'd be kind of annoyed if they hadn't. I could easily drink this all night - theoretically, anyway, because six of these would cost like 25 dollars. I'd say that this is worth a try, but a repeat purchase is probably out of the question.","thehyperduck","Nov 17, 2014"

Nevertheless I feel Mikkeller did a jgood job in spite of that in create a flavourful and zesty cream ale, but the tart mustiness and tough balance of flavour make it a beer I wouldn't seek regularly, it is still one of the better cream ales I can remember having.","mick303","Oct 12, 2014"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Very tasty, and goes down all too easily. Not sure how true this is to style; I suspect the original cream ales were less hoppy. But I'm not complaining - this is nicely balanced and very drinkable. Well worth sampling if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","Aug 08, 2012"
3.45,-6.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Slightly hazy golden yellow pour with a one finger thin white head with nice lacing. Some subtle citrus hops initially on the nose, but that quickly gives way to hints of grass, lemon, and a bit of funk and bread. The taste is a bit harsh at first for a cream ale. A lot more bitterness than I had expected. But as it warms, the malt emerges and balances it out nicely. The flavors are very subtle with hints of lemon, corn, and grass. The mouthfeel is not creamy at all and is borderline fizzy. Big initial bitterness that yields to a crisp, dry, subtly sweet finish. It's been a while since I've had a cream ale, but this is not what I remembered. But then again, Mikkeller never follows the norm and that's why I love them.","beerdrifter","May 09, 2012"

4.1,10.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Hazy pale orange, a few fingers of white head with some webbed lacing and chunky retention. Juicy citrus hop notes on the nose with some big yeast wafting from the glass. A bit bready, lightly floral - unique to any 'cream ale' I've come across. Taste is more along the lines of what I had expected, grainer malt notes and solid, but restrained hopping still moderately juicy and citrusy. A bit drying in the finish with some yeast. Medium feel and excellent drinkability, wish I could have access to this year round. A well assembled cream ale.","liamt07","Apr 03, 2012"

3.85,4.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazed straw yellow, decent cap of white froth. Scent is pale and made up of grassy, earthy hops and fresh dried grains. Taste surprised and was bolder than scent dictated, good character extracted from the minimal ingredients. Solid notes of grassy and earthy hops, fresh yet lightly musty dried grains and light touch of sweetness and ale like fruityness. Lighter side of medium bodied, creamy and lightly grainy. A very easy drinker with some character.","rfgetz","Aug 21, 2011"

3.73,0.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Burger in Santa Cruz. Pours a light golden color with a firm white froth. Aroma is full of hay and grass with a faint fruit salad note. Flavor is pale malts and minerals with a big noble hop blast. Really nothing like a cream ale, reminds me more of a hop-forward american pilsner with an ambiguous ale-ishness. Slightly tart, maybe a touch of wheat. Great hop character, fresh and spicy. A little astringent and thin on the palate.","illidurit","Mar 12, 2011"
3.3,-10.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Cream ale, huh? While plowing this recipe with good ol' American bittering hops may make it taste good, if you're a hophead, this is more false advertising, than anything. What this really is, is a pretty hoppy west coast IPA. Minus significant points for not calling it so.","biboergosum","Beers"

3.76,1.6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy, pale golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight hops, slight citrus, and slight earthiness. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight citrus, slight pale hops, slight earthy malt, and hint of wheat.

4.01,8.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This is definately not a brew from Mikkeller that i have heard of before but looks most interesting it comes a creamy coloured label with two machine guns on the front label and it is a collabaration between Mikkeller and Revelation Craft Brewing,it pours a pale honey hue with nice carbonation that leaves a creamy two finger head and frothy lacing everywhere that sticks to the sides of the glass,the smell is quite subtle for a Mikkeller brew but still nice with hints of creaming soda(in a good way) and a tinge of fruity hops,it has a full creamy smooth mouthfeel with tastes of very smooth pale malts and some bitter hops that is smoothed out right at the finish to take away a little of the bitterness but its still there which i like,overall a nice brew that would buy again and would like to see some more examples of this style but i have had better brews from Mikkeller.","ADZA","0"
