"Prefer it very cold it helps the mouthfeel a bit. I enjoy the taste but the kick must end up coming from the bourbon barrels possibly.. it's a good all night beer if you like very sweet"
""
"Very ""meh"" and had a weird taste on teh finish. It was ok, but the smoke flavor didn't come through much and just kind of made this one taste a little strange."
""
""
"Good stuff.  I'd have another of these!"
""
"Smells an tastes like an old root beer that was left in a hot truck during the summer and then iced down. Wasn't impressed and took a lot to get the taste out of my mouth. My dog wouldn't even drink it"
""

"Not good. Don't waste your money."
"I love Root Beer and I thought I would try it out.  I thought, how bad could hard root beer be?   I bought a 4 pack and have dumped two down the sink before I was halfway through because it tastes exactly like cough medicine."
""
""
"Dangerously great tasting beer.  At 5% and testing just like root beer I could drink this all night"
"Slight root beer taste but has a wired sour taste"
""
""
"It truly tastes like root beer. These are very drinkable."
"I drank Sprecher regular root beer 10 years ago when it was available at Costco down here in Tennessee. Finding this alcoholic version is a real treat since I started getting back into root beers."
""
"I had seen this on the shelf numerous times but always passed on it.  I then recevied a Not Your Father's Rootbeer as an extra in a trade and really enjoyed it.  That experience prompted me to give this one a try and I am glad I did.  It's not quite as good as Not Your Father's, but pretty close.  Tastes just like Root Beer and the alcohol is very well hidden."
"Could have used some more head on it for sure.  I really liked it.  Had a real natural root\wood refreshing taste.  A little thin in feel and couldn't tell there was alcohol.  I think they did a good job with this beer."
"With all the rave for Not Your Father's Root Beer, I decided I'd give this one a go. Lo and behold, tastes just like root beer, although a little too sweet. I think it is an excellent beer."
""
""
"I was quite surprised by this beer....cannot rave about it enough!  I will be purchasing more for sure."
"Looks and smells nice. Tastes like someone combined crappy beer and A&W. Never again."

"Tastes like root beer at first, then odd after taste."
""

""
""
"Not a complex of traditional tasting beer by any stretch but it tastes like a damn good root beer, which I would think was the goal, so a very well done beer in that regard."
""
""
"Tastes like root beer, but it has an odd flavor component to it which brings it rating down."

"Thought this would be a two-fer. Hints of both flavors. Ultimately disappointing and a bit...strange. Not sure what to do with the last three bottles."

"The taste is tangy and sweet with light woody root combo of tastes with mild alcohol coming through as it finishes with a slight cinnamon-spice woodiness with a yeastiness that detracts but pretty good considering it sounds like it could come off as a weak root beer schnapps malternative. I consider this good for what it is but would not revisit it-not terrible"

"Just what the world needs  a 5% ABV soda.  I love it with a dollop of vanilla ice cream."
"I'm confused... is this beer? I'm not being sarcastic. Either way... this tastes like root beer. That's it. Got some alcohol noticeable but hardly. This tastes 100% like root beer. Easy to drink and not bad either... but I would never drink this if I wanted a ""beer."" This is soda."

"An aggressive pour produced half a mug of tan head. For the most part it looks and smells like root beer. The smell is a little off. The taste is similar to root beer. It starts out good, but has a little alcohol in the finish with a lingering aftertaste. It seems undercarbonated and thin. Overall, it's not a bad attempt at hard root beer. I would try it again and may try a float with it."

"It's pretty much a malty root beer soda with a bit of alcohol. If you're looking for something beyond that you might want to look elsewhere. It's not one of the best flavored ale's I've had yet the root beer/malt combo was enough for me to make it worth the cost of the six pack."

"Sore hers root beer is my favorite and so I thought would try the hard version. Boy was this a mistake. What good smell but an awful taste. Took my glass of it and poor it out next to patio. Was very disappointed as I love their beers and pop. I will say you should give it a try and if you dump it you're out $1.50 which we waste more on other things we try."

"(5 minutes later)-Update. Yeah. This is definitely making me feel really sick. I have to throw this down the drain. There is something wrong in this...something seriously wrong."

"Somebody get me a twelve pack; this is outstanding."
