"This beer is simply not my taste. Cream ales are best kept light and crisp. This beer doesn't have enough backbone to handle the booziness. One of the worst craft beers I've had recently, but I tend not to like imperial pale lagers, and this beer is a close cousin to those styles."
"The taste comes across as if there was actual cream added. Very smooth and rich. Decent carbonation even if the richness makes it seem otherwise."

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, this is a very good beer to drink for a long time."

"O- A cool idea but I'm not sure how much I enjoyed it. One full pint of those as enough for me."

"credit for going for it in a style rarely seen around these parts but the flavor is not my bag.. of chips"
"O) A decent brew. Points for creativity. Not your normal run-of-the-mill brew."

"Cream Ales, an ale/lager hybrid of sorts, are greatly underrepresented and often misunderstood. Slumbrew reminds us how fun the style can be with their dangerously delicious Imperalized interpretation; a cold lager blended with a warm ale. Perhaps a bit too sweet, but the complexity and sheer drinkability quickly forgives and forgets."

"The look and smell are pretty good - seethrough orangeish body with two-finger head that dies quick with lace patches on glass and a mix of some bitter, grainy hops and malts along with a sugary, caramel edge. The taste and mouthfeel of the beer just didn't come through as well for me though(who knows - bad tap line? old keg?) . There is a creaminess and smoothness to the beer, goes down easy but not watery, mind you, and there is some sweet caramel malt but it's either not enough or there are just too much hops because overall I found this beer to be grainy, sharp and a little bitter with a very dry finish. Maybe the ABV bled in a little or my beer had a touch of metallic taste but overall I'd say the sweetness was overpowered for a good but not great beer."

"Calling this beer a cream ale (or even an imperial cream ale) is a bit misleading, as it bares absolutely no resemblance to other versions of the style that I have sampled. Regardless, My Better Half really impressed me. If you appreciate unique beers that push boundaries, then definitely give this a shot."

"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours a clear medium shade of copper with a thick, white head. There are visible tiny bubbles rising in the beer. Some lacing is left behind as the head recedes. The beer smells of grain, caramel, and grassy and woody hop notes. The flavor is pretty sweet. I get the caramel and honey flavors up front. The grain and grassy and woody hops are also there. The back end bitterness is there and lingers in the back of the mouth. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is slick in the mouth and goes down easily. This is a very good beer."

"Crystal clear copper color, bubbly head on top. Yeast, ripe pears, spicy hop, orange pith and animal feed grain in the nose. Very smooth, creamy with a medium body. Biscuity throughout, bread crust and crackers. Lots of hop flavor; herbal, leafy, spicy, mild tobacco & orange peel. Hint of caramel and ripe fruit in the middle, finishes near astringent. A battle more than balance here, hops and malt don't seem to fully mesh together for me and while it is not a chore to drink it certainly is not a bomber I'd get on my own. I've had batches that were sweeter and a bit more palatable."
"O: It's not bad, quite simple and definitely seems to defy the style. Being an ""imperial"" cream ale it makes sense, doesn't taste like any other cream ale I've ever had. It's definitely got much stronger malt and hops than any cream ale I've tried, which is good and bad I suppose. Stronger, sharper flavors but loses the lightness, smoothness and the plain drinkable simplicity of a cream ale. I had a hard time scoring this one and waffled quite a bit."

"O- this beer has a nice full fresh clean malt profile with a big alcohol heat and hop bite punch in the finish."

"This is a syrupy, sweet, yet easy to drink cream ale that I would recommend to any malt head."

"o: Very different; not bad but not something I'd want often."

"o - Overall I thought this was a great cream ale. Just a ton of vanill and cream, and super smooth and cream and easy to drink. Would like to have it again."
"The beer is bright orange and mostly clear, sporting a small white head that leaves some good lacing on the tulip. The aroma brings floral notes, malt, cream. Wow, the cream character really comes through in the flavor. Vanilla and cream soda notes. Soft and smooth on the palate. I would definitely have this again."

"Great beer for people you know who aren't into bitter, super hoppy beers. This a nice gateway beer!"
"I want more! Sadly, it's a limited release and probably won't be around for a while, so get it while you can!"
"Overall not bad, but nothing special. Not creamy as I expected, tastes like it's boozier than it is, although nice malts, and fairly drinkable."
"Pours a darker golden color with a creamy white head that leaves a nice lacing down the side of the glass. A lot of vanilla and Some grain malts taste is sweet vanilla upfront that faded to a bit of grain and then back to vanilla. Nice creamy body goes down well. Pretty solid cream ale - full of vanill flavors that work really well."
"Taste starts sweet, citrus in the middle, with a strong bitterness through the close. Alcohol bite lingers after the swallow. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and drinkability is good. Just about what I would expect an imperial cream ale to be like."

"Very good! Don't see too many examples of this style around here, especially an imperialized cream ale."
"An easy drinking beer that reminds me of an orange creamcicle. Nicely balanced with no dominating flavor."
"Overall a cool concept and really enjoyable beer - I kept wanting more (shared the 22)."
