review_text
"Tall skinny 12 oz can into a pint glass. Not a huge fan of this one, not something I'd purchase again. I typically enjoy most Sixpoint stuff, I was disappointed in Sweet Action."
"Unique taste but not for me"
"The worse thing I've ever tasted. Worse than lambic!!!!"
""
"Overall: Very much a light American pale ale [or an over-hopped light amber].  Very good summertime beer.  Light, crisp.  I'd drink it again, but won't be seeking it out.  Seems similar to MadTree's Happy Amber and Goose Island Honker's Ale (though without the ""English"" feeling)."
""
"Overall:  Not exactly my preferred type of beer, but it's good.  If I came across it at a bar, I'd probably grab a can and have them pour it into a frosted mug."
""
"Simply my favorite beer in the world."
""
"It's just a really good beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Kinda hoppy for a cream ale."
""
""
""
"Reviewing because outlier...this cream ale is superb. The mouthfeel really stands out, smell is citrusy like an ipa. Very sessionable and a really refreshing brew."
""
""
"12 oz bullet can, best buy drink date of 4 Aug 15.  Crisp, I like it."
"Had it on draft at work. First Cream Ale, but I'm still not sure if it's a true representation of the style. Lightly hoppy, sweet and smooth. Very balanced and drinkable. Light but not in a light beer way. Need to drink more. Good beer."
""
""
"This is a good beer! Look- pours with a nice creamy head, foam dissipates but rings on the surface. Color is a tan, honey gold. Smells- muted hops, with an underlining sweetness. Taste- great character. You get the sweetness, blend of malt and hops awesome balance. Feel- creamy! Great stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Rare that a beer's mouthfeel stands out as its best element but it certainly does here. Flavor-wise this is tasty yet average... but overall it's so refreshing I'll definitely grab more to sip while outside during the summer months"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thought it was like an APA at first, but this light bodied ale is deceivingly complex and tasty!  Not sure what a cream ale is or what category to put this in, but it's pretty good.  Sessionable and tasty, good summer beer."
""
"Sweet Action looks good, smell is nothing to rave about but not bad, but the taste! A little hop forward with an amazing honey like finish w just a little sweetness not a lot. Smooth and coating mouth feel. Perfect carbonation. Amazing beer! It's actually going to become my new everyday staple. Sixpoint makes phenomenal nectars!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is going to end up in the regular rotation at my house."
"sooty brown bloodpiss. Run of the mill puke and ash. Hhcccckkkk PTEH!!!"
""
"O- Pleasantly surprised.  Not big on cream ales but I like this one."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a lively white head that trails the glass. The smell was very nice with sweet flavors coming through such as orange and banana. The taste was much more hoppy than I was expecting but it was still well balanced and I really enjoyed this as a refreshing and flavorful beer. Sixpoint continues to impress."
"It is claimed that this beer is a cream ale. I missed something then in the flavor. Came across more as a pale then a cream. Expected it to be a bit sweeter in its flavor."
""
""
""
"Very smooth.  Excellent for this style of beer."
""
""
""
""
"O:  Underwhelming at first, but the taste and mouthfeel are nearly perfect.  I'm downing my third since starting the review."
"Perhaps it's just me, but the hop-forward nature of this one isn't exactly what I'm looking for in a cream ale."
""
""
""
"This beer makes me think that I still don't know what a cream ale is. Best by far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy drinking, with notes of citrus dancing with a medium touch of hops. Slight bitterness in the finish. Solid."
""
""
""
"Another good beer from Sixpoint"
""
""
"O: While it may be difficult to place this beer squarely into any single style-category, one thing remains clear - regardless of what you consider this beer, consider it a supremely drinkable example.  Smooth, light, and very refreshing, all wrapped up in a low-abv package that makes this beer very sessionable.  Recommended."
""
""
""
"Brooklyn at Berg'n.  Made great first impression and my wife never wavered.  I decided that the carbonation was tricking me into thinking that it was distinctive."
"Nose is lemony and hoppy with a slight note of chocolate, pours slightly hazed dark yellow color with a very thin light airy head. Tastes of light citrusy hops with the hint of lemon and slight bready malts. I like this beer, very drinkable and sessionable at 5.2% ABV."
""
""
""
""
"Within a bawhair of the best beer I have ever had, no question!!! From a 330ml can this is other-worldly....the draft version must be intergalactic!!! Planetery!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oh man this is good. Bought from NY by a friend, this beer is delicious! It is not overly hoppy but has enough to balance the creamy side. Well put together and definitely worth drinking. Hop profile of the darker orange fruits kind of like Sculpin IPA but with less of the piney and more of the creamy. Great job Sixpoint"

"as bold of a cream ale as i can recall, i love this thing. its got a richer and bigger malt base than many, a touch of caramel color to the mostly clear brew. the head is white and long lasting, and the nose shows some serious sweetness. i get honey and cereal grain, with maybe some milk sugar and enough hops for it to be balanced on the back end. the flavor is the same, with the majority of the sweetness coming up front. i love the bigger malt bill, it does so much for the flavors here and really takes the style to a place i have not seen it go before. the bigger body i think also helps it stand out from the crowd. carbonation is epic, and im left wanting more and more of this beer. not like any other cream ale out there, and i think these guys have done an expert job making base styles unique to their brewery. this is exceptional on all counts."

"This is a winner. I love this and its nice to have a cream ale that is not genny."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my all time favorites and a staple in my fridge. A brew that's truly pleasant on the palate. A sweet malt aroma is followed by a blend of flavors that are perfectly balanced. Fruity sweet and bready followed by herbs and spices and a hops bite. The feel is quite awesome; smooth, crisp, light, refreshing and delightfully creamy."

"This reminds me of a light IPA or a pale ale, not really a cream ale. But who cares, it's still a fun beer to drink and it's very enjoyable. I've been diggin' Sixpoint lately."
"O: what a great beer. I will scoop these up again the next time i spot them."
""

""
""
""

"Overall, while I don't necessarily agree with the ""cream ale"" status, it's an irrelevant issue considering this is delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clearly, this beer is not to be trifled with, especially in a weakened state of mind. Perhaps a fresh taste would spark new views, but with this little sleep, it's just not the refreshing jolt I was hoping to find. I'd drink it again, for sure, since I still have several left, but I'm not sure that I would offer it to my mother-in-law. All in all, solid beer with a strange character."
""
""
""
""

"O:Not a bad brew at all, well balanced and tasty as well, Sixpoint does a good job with the brews, I enjoyed the simplicity of this one with the good taste."

"Overall: Excellent sessionable beer. Would drink again. It sort of tastes like a cream ale crossed with a fairly hoppy American pale ale or golden ale. Whatever it is, it's great, and will remind you of why you love beer."

"Pours a dark orange golden with an off white head. Aroma is sweet bread and dough, vanilla, and some grassy hops. Flavor is similar with the addition of some orange. A crisp, medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, only had a few cream ales now and this is by far the best of the bunch. First one that I have been thoroughly impressed with. Definitely will be returning to this one, a great option when seeking a sessionable beer."

"2012 - At Rattle n Hum, NYC. OK. A bit on the heavy side for my taste. Balanced flavor and bitterness, leaning a notch to the sweet side."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter at the brass tap midotwn tallahassee, Pours a copper orange with tangerine highlights when backlit. Head is comprised of big off white sticky bubbles and tattered sheets of spongey lace. Head deflates quickly in to a sheet of large bubbled foam. Aroma consists of bright grapefruit and citrus hops with some sweet mango mixed in. Aroma is strong though not complex but simple is good with this profile. Taste is hoppy with lemon zest and white grapefruit citrus dominates up front the beer trails off mostly after this as mid pallet is void of anything in particular and the finish comes up with a mineral and chalky dry finish. The hang is bitter and consists of a little pine and citrus. This beer smells tastes and drinks like a pale. Im not exactly sure what puts it into the cream ale category accept for maybe the lack of a malt backbone. That being said it feels intentional while drinking it not like just an under done pale ,but I do like my cream ales with a little lactose or dextrose which this seems to lack. The mouthfeel is light and crisp slightly fizzy but not to a fault. Not really what I was expecting at all from this style , this beer falls into the different but not bad category, A great poolside or beach option when looking for something crisp in a can. Overall not a bad beer by any means. Sixpoint delivers as usual."
""
"T/O: It does indeed taste like an orange creamsicle, but it has enough hop bitterness to balance the back end. Not too sweet, not too bitter, well put together. Too sweet to be an APA. More consistent with a light EPA with higher carbonation level that makes it taste crisper. Honey rolls, caramel flavors not pronounced but qualities of both found. Creaminess from the caramel; and, floral sweetness with a bready backbone from honey rolls. I could drink these forever."

"O: To me I'd have guessed this was a pale ale instead of a cream ale. It was a good beer but not sure if they pegged the name or the style quite right."
""
""
""
""
"Continue to be impressed with Sixpoint. This one is delicately crafted for sure. Hits the expectation of what I thought a cream ale would be and gives me a bit of a hop fix too. Thanks Sixpoint."

"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight caramel malt, slight earthy malt, hops, slight alcohol, and cream. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of caramel malt, hops, slight alcohol, slight cream, and a hint of yeast. Overall, good aroma, feel, body, and blend for a Cream Ale."

"Sixpoint Sweet Action ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On-tap at Bernie’s in Waukesha, WI. This pours a hazy, brown color with a slight beige head. The aroma is sweet with a hint of malt. The taste is slightly sweet and malty. Smooth and easy drinking. Very well made and delicious a nice little find at a bar, especially of draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet Action is a great quasi-sessionable beer, even when it's past its prime, as this can attests. Drinks like a hybrid between an American and English Pale ale. I will definitely have to try this fresh in the new 6x12oz. format and re-review."

"Overall: This has been described as a cross between a pale ale, a wheat beer and a cream ale. It's that hard to classify. But who cares anyway? It's freaking DELICIOUS. Highly Recommended. You wont be sorry."

"very enjoyable, achieving it's aims of a sweet and bitter balance."
""
"drinker I’d say it combined the best of both beers."
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear amber with a ring of white bubbles. On the nose I get sweet, bready malt with tropical citrus and apples, plus an herbal hop presence. The taste follows the nose but has a wider array of fruit: blood orange, apple, strawberry, apricot, along with that same sweet bread malt. It doesn't taste like any cream ale I've ever had, nor does it fit into any known category, but man is it tasty. Finishes slightly bitter with a medium body and good level of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Average but drinkable with the sweet and creamy feel being a highlight for me. The main problem was that both the taste & the smell seemed too light and basic for me. I'll stick with Bengali Tiger over this one every time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet Action is an old friend. A very good, session beer that defies genre. That's fine by me, as the result is a distinctly delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - this beer is a great ""session"" beer, definitely at the top of its style. One could drink several of these the only negative may be the price point at 9.99 for 4-16 oz cans. This one will be part of my regular rotation."

"O: like a mediocre extract homebrew.... aside from the can stating this was dry-hopped, there was no indication of the level of nasty-looking sediment contained within... hmmm... wasn't a fan of this the first time I had this in '08 - gonna have a hard time recommending this one"

"A solid beer. The cream ale doesn't really come through for me as the hopping is quite high for that style but it works nicely on the whole."
""
""
""
"Carbonation seems a bit full-on."
""
"Sweet Action has a reputation of balancing the bitterness of a pale ale and the sweetness of cream ale, and it does just that. A great beer brewed by a great brewery, enjoyable any time of the year."
""
""
""
""
"I've always loved this style but I've never really enjoyed a single example I've tried so far lets hope this sets the bar anyway it pours a hazed light amber hue with a rather fluffy fluffy three finger ever present head and lacing everywhere,the nose is quite feint but I Do get herbal grassy hops along with barley,slight vanilla and grains,the mouthfeel is smooth medium bodied and quite satisfying on a hot night like tonight but the tastes are not up to par it's just grassy herbal hops,grains,barley,caramel malts and the finish is smooth and a touch sweet but not overly sweet and overall yeah it's a better option than The macro on offer but the flagfall ain't worth the ride cheers."
""
"Citrusy grass aroma. Pours deep ruddy amber with thick beige head. Head lasts a goodly time with nice lacing of glass. Hits the mouth with a citrus bite along with a light caramel note. Nice slight hoppy aftertaste. The can notes this is dry-hopped with fresh hops. Very nice!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - first of style, nice surprise. Easy drinking but well flavoursome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Although in the hierarchy of beer cream ales do not rank highly, ""Sweet Action"" is a solid drinkable beer that goes well with unsophicated but beloved american fare (pizza, wings, brownies, bugers, and fries)"
""
""
""
""
""
"edit (01-2015): Bought one of the six packs and was so excited to drink it down after the first sip proved even better than I remember it. I ended my last review highlighting the 'balance' of this beer, but I'll add that it does not lack character and I think SixPoint's beers tend to improve over time consciously which is of course quite commendable. Kudos, y'all!"

"Poured to a sam adams glass, off white head developed, very frothy with mild retention and lacing. Appearance was hazy with an amber to gold color. Great aroma with nice hop / malt notes and som toffee. Tasted more malty with caramel notes and a hint of cola. Mouthfeel was medium with a malty, lingering aftertaste."

"The first time I tried this beer I didn't really like it- perhaps because it wasn't what I was expecting and was a bit too bitter for a cream ale and had a little bit of that copper penny tang that you can find in ESBs. After having this a few times now, though, I find myself liking it. The metallic note and the hop kick perk up the style and make me more interested in having more than one. A fairly pretty beer as well, with a nice copper color and fine head and creamy enough in the mouth to evince the style. An interesting twist on a somewhat boring style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure what this beer is supposed to be - an APA, wheat, or Cream Ale- but it is always delicious. There is a zesty orange aroma that goes along with pine (pale ale?). Malt up front in the mouth, creamy with a bit of honey (cream ale?). Either way you slice it, this is one interesting ride that is delicious when fresh."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the best cream ale I’ve ever had. Smooth and delicious, without that weird almost-cloying flavor. Well balanced, and perfect for any time of the year."

"Overall- Decent beer. Sixpoint is winning me over. I will come back to this beer at some point."

"Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this brew. I think it has lots of character in its appearance and excitement in its flavor profile. Sixpoint is slowly becoming one of my favorite names because it is always turning me onto styles I don't normally choose. I feel like cream ales are easy to find but good cream ales are not that easy to find. This one is really good."

"I upped this upon re-review: There's more going on in this beer, a battle between sweet barley and bitter, bitey hops. It gets better as you go, and as it warms. Deserves a try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The mellow but well balanced flavor is interesting and the dried orange hops are a nice character but it turns watery as it starts to open. There isn’t a lot of other depth to make is sessionable."
"O - A pretty good beer. Nothing outstanding but pleasant. Mouthfeel and drinkability are the highlights here for me. I would definitely have another."
"o: very good flavor behind a lightly aromatic beer that seems like a cross between a cream ale and a PA."
""
"o: Strange brew, this. Uniquely delicious, I'd have another for sure."
"Pours a hazy medium orange with rocky cream colored head, streaks of wet lace down the glass. Smell: apricot, bread, slight cattiness. Taste: nectarine, juice orange, peppery, caramel, snappy / grainy. Creamy, very active carbonation. A very flavorful version of the style, nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer wasn't short on hops at all and the hop character was intense but without oil or too much bitter. The simcoe never got catty and the bread, while sweet, never outclassed the fruit. Easy to see why Sixpoint was #1 at the NYS TAP festival. So far each offering is unique and expertly done. This was a graceful interpretation of a cream ale that drank easily and with a little panache."

"Poured from a 16 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a orange with a slight red tint with a froffy head. Smells of grassy notes that dominate the beer, but otherwise pretty bland. Tastes of watery light grain with very slight hop bite, not very many different flavors. Beer is very light bodied and refreshing, goes down smooth, and good carbonation. Overall, an above average beer."
"O: I see why this is ranked so high. I'll definitely have this one again."
"Cheers! Abort!"
"This doesn't taste like a cream ale as listed. Definitely a style combo. It's an interesting beer, but not my type of style."
""
""

""
"I liked this one because it I different for me."
"O: I was very impressed with this one. Sixpoint are masters at the dry hop. All of their beers that I've tried have this in common. The smell on this one was incredible, especially when I was expecting very little because of the style. On top of that, this beer had a lot more character than any other cream ale I've had."

"Strong smell of orange and tangerine. Fair amount of carbonation. Quite like an Orangina, but not that sweet. I like it well enough now in 20 degree weather with a blizzard bearing down, but it seems like a perfect match for spring and summer, baseball, hot dogs and freshly mowed grass."

"A Great Beer from Sixpoint!"
""
"I had a tough time deciding exactly how this beer should be classified or rated, but my feelings and my rating improved with each sip. It is a little lighter than other craft brews, but it is still a very tasty beer in its own way and a good introductory beer for newer fans of craft beer products."
""
"This beer tastes like a pale ale to me that is heavy on crystal malt. Somewhat tasty, but the victim of wrong categorization. The malt is way too big for a cream ale, as is the alcohol."
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer here... The extra pop of hops make this Cream Ale not so Cream Ale like... But the big sweet caramel malt is so nice. Worth looking for."
"I really enjoyed this one from Sixpoint. A nicely balanced mix of hops and malts."
""

"First cream ale in a while, so I wasn't sure how much I'd like it. But this turned out to be a decent brew, not hard to get down at all (i.e., not too sweet or overly creamy). This had a fair amount of hops, but it wasn't too hopped up either. A nice light drinker for late night or a summer afternoon. Pretty enjoyable."

"O. This brew definitely lived up to the balanced billing on the can. This is a need to try. Simply one of the most balanced brew you will have."

"O: Not what I would expect from a cream ale, Nice and full of flavor they hit all the marks with fruity yeast esters nice hop aroma and malt/corn adjunct properties. Not traditional in sense but a damn good drinking beer for all seasons."

"Perhaps I don't know what a good cream ale is, or just dont like cream ales, but this is the top rated cream ale on BA and its not doing much for me. She looks mighty nice - a bright orange body and healthy white foam head. It definitely goes down easy, but so do a lot of other more flavorful styles. Bready, light citrus hops, dry finish, sharp carbonation. Nothing wrong here, but it's a tough style to really run back to."

"O: This beer is an oxymoron in a glass: it's very complex in it's simplicity. Part wheat ale, part pale ale, and part cream ale with a big wallop of hops. On paper it sounds very odd and busy. In reality it works rather seamlessly, and weaves a simple progression of flavors into something much greater than the sum of their parts. There's a lot going on here, but in the end it all translates to one thing: a simple, enjoyable drinking experience. A perfect warm weather beer. I'm also amazed at how fresh this still tastes even toward the end of its lifespan. Is this what cans can do?"
""
"Overall: probably the smoothest cream ale I've ever had. Tasty and very drinkable. I'll definitely have this again if I run across it."
""
""
"Smooth, light, complex and flavorful. This is not your typical brew, it holds the balance between flavor and refreshment better than nearly any ale I have come across."

"Didn't see having a third cream ale today, but at least this one is a bit of an oddball take on the style (sort of, anyway). It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, grass, light flowers, light orange rind, and a streak of biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with the grass and wheat really strangling out everything else. What results is a mild bitterness that seems a touch out-of-place and detracts from the proceedings for me. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, despite the bitterness, which isn't all that powerful anyway, this is a solid cream ale. It may not be all that indicative of the style, but it's enjoyable enough."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm sure this is how a cream ale should taste. This definitely isn't a genny."
""
""
"Overall: This was a tasty one, and probably one of the best brews I’ve sampled this year. It might be a little sweet for some but I thought it fit perfectly. It has some strong flavors so I’d probably only enjoy one and move on to something else, but it’s a great way to start the evening."
"O- A great go-to beer that can be readily found year round!"
"Nice aroma of herbal and fruity hops. Very well balanced between malt and wheat sweetness and bitterness from its 34 IBUs. Citric aftertaste (gets to it fairly quick), mostly orange. Liked this beer, good drinkability with flavor."
""
""
"O: Wonderful flavor. Fruit, pepper, slight bitterness with well blended alcohol and a bit of bread / malt. This is a great drinking beer."
""
"Came in 4 can pack. 16 oz/can. They say in can its better preservation then in bottle. OK. Poured in Sam Adams 2011 style glass. Carbonation is good, foam is nice, not creamy though. Smells like fresh Cascade hops, lot's of them and I did appreciate this fact. Tastes naturally bitter, a bit amateurish like a typical home made brew. My overall is 3.79."
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip from a 16 ounce can. Off-white head head, low retention. Oily, clear lacing. Hazy, cloudy coppery body. Best by date is 11/12/12. Smell is mainly floral hops with mild caramel malts. Taste is citrus like, mainly lemons and nectarine with some malty sweetness, slightly bready. Nothing bad about this beer, maybe not the most memorable one every either."

"O-it's a great beer. I've had this a lot and its definitely something you can drink over and over again and might be even better out of the can. It's a pretty unique beer too. Doesn't taste like other cream ales I've had."
"Overall – A decent beer, but nothing too exceptional. Nothing really stands out in this one, but nothing really takes away either."
""
"O- Nice beer, complex and balanced, not sure what style I would have put this in if I had to classify it or what I would have though of this in a blind taste test. It has characteristics of an IPA but more malty and chewy with the body and heft of a cream ale, an easy drinker at 5.2% ABV to boot."
"O-Never would have thought this was a cream ale. The hops do not balance with the malt, which was the main drawback to me."

"(O)- Overall, I like it. It is definitely one of the more ""intense"" cream ales I have experienced. Lightly hoppy. Another winner to have in summertime when I have issues finding new Berliner Weiss's"
"The taste is more of the same. Nothing I would expect from a cream ale at all. This is more like how a hefeweisen tastes. I find it very peculiar that this would be identified as a cream ale. I feel like some other category would suit it far better. It's not a bad beer, it's just not what I was looking for. This is what I would want from a summer ale on the rare occasions that I'm in the mood for one."
"I got some sweet Sweet Action tonight. Disclaimer: I am a devoted Sixpoint fan. I like their philosophy, I like their artwork, packaging, and pint cans, I like the amazing color of their beers, and I like drinking them. Sweet Action was no exception. The can said somthing about ""love," and the balance of ""bitter and sweet."" That's exactly what this cream ale is: a perfect balance. Just a hint of sweetness on the tip of the tongue, and a crisp, dry, slightly yeasty finish. A perfect session beer."
""
""
""
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma has some toffee and biscuit notes, as well as some grass and pine from the hops. The flavor is fairly similar. The hop notes balance very well with the sweet notes from the malt. I get some nice toffee quality and a hint of pine. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
"I found this to be a tough drink, it was so cloying and completely out of balance it was a tough drink."

"Overall, a very good session beer."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the feel. There was nice froth and creamy coating, with a cooling, crisp finish. We were surprised at the hoppiness of the flavoring, and also at the relative lack of sweetness. For the style we were expecting a cloying punch off the bat, but we were given a more serious brew, with a very “grown up” flavor. The sweetest part about it was actually the nose, which was clean throughout, and nicely inclusive of all of the other elements."
"Either way this is a bit of a sweetness bomb. Not bad but suffers from a lack of complexity. Nice clean flavors though."
""
"O- Great beer from the guys at Six Point. Looking forward to the Resin next."
"O: This one is an enigma to me only because I either had a string of bad beers, my palette is completely off, or I'm just not digging this. I'll definitely give this one another shot as I seem to like all other Sixpoing beers. Until then, this one is kinda middle of the road for me."

"O - An amalgam of styles, Sweet Action suggests an American Amber / Red Ale with it's abundantly hopped profile reminiscent of a more mild IPA with earthy notes and toasted malt finish. Quite well-balanced, they pull the beer of nicely, showcasing a blend of hops and malt for a drinkable ale!"
"O- overall a great beer"
""
""

"O-lots going on here, a simple idea yet a complex brew. Drinkable, flavorful, and not overporing. Just right to me."
""
""
"O: What a fantastically hopped-out Cream Ale from Sixpoint. Very sessionable at 5.2% ABV, I'm pleased with the robust implementation of all 34 IBUs to bring a nice aromatic and bittersweet experience to the drinkability of this near-lager style. I'd snap it up again in a second for a pool or beach BBQ."
"O - Enjoyable, easy-drinking cream ale. Despite the overall lightness, still manages to have an interesting flavor profile with some depth."
"Toasted grain, soon gives way to fruity, bready, cookie malt. Slightly sweet. Spicy, peppery, slightly astringent hop bitterness intrudes and provides some nice balance. Moderate body, with a nice, naturally carbonated feel. Definitely lagerish (Vienna?). Not bad!"
"Pours a dark orange with a dense off white head. Smell has a nice hops aroma with sweet malt in there as well. The flavor starts with a flavorful hops and sweet citrus, and has a nice malt backbone. A medium mouthfeel, nice and smooth, with good flavor balance. Overall it is like sweeter IPA, but not as hoppy. An enjoyable beer."
""
"M - Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation."
""
"16 oz can poured into Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours deep gold and clear with dense creamy head. Great retention and tons of lacing. The nose features loads of caramel malts, hints of butterscotch, toffee, and herbal hops which provide a dash of bitterness. The taste is even heavier on the butterscotch and sweetness. Not sure if this is the intended sweetness or if it is some diacetyl. Either way, it provides a nice change of pace from the stouts, IPAs, and sours I've been predominately drinking. The finish has just enough bitterness to keep the taste from being too sweet. The mouth feel has some weight with a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice cream ale. Of the Sixpoint offerings I have had, this is the most intriguing."
""
"O- Typical cream ale, I've had much better cream ales and much better from Sixpoint."
""
"The hops really had so much to this somewhat boring style and maybe I am being too harsh on the cream ale style but a nice citrus punch really brings this beer around. Good chewy bits from the malts and a great hop bite make me want more of this."

"O: this is a pretty drinkable cream ale. I would say the mouthfeel is the best part about this beer. I would definitely have this again."
"Overall: Its a nice cream ale. I have been spoiled with a local brewery that makes a cream ale with vanilla and its just awesome. It really blows this cream ale out of the water. So that fact makes it hard for me to beleive that this is the best cream ale on the list, but its still a decent offering for sure. Its just a way more bitter than I expected."

"Supa-dupa cream ale. Prime Sixpoint brew. Much love."
"Poured from the can into a pint glass, this beer was a murky copper color with a moderate head of white. The initial aroma marked the presence of hops with perhaps a hint of barley. In ihe intial taste, one finds a mild level of hoppiness followed by an interesting creamy finish. The mouthfeel on this one is pleasantly creamy, giving a unique ripple to the hops. Amid the flavors is a hint of orange zest as well as some earthy grass notes. In the aftertaste, the orange zest continues to tickle the sides of the tongue with the hops rapidly fading. One obviously would not buy this beer for the hops. Classified as a cream ale, this is a unique interpretation of the style."
""
"16oz can, pours a murky copper topped with a tall white head, leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are fresh citric hop and biscuity malt. Tastes are fresh citric/herbal hop, bready malt, biscuity as well, some caramel, finishes with a nice amount of bitterness and is very refreshing. Mouth-feel is fuller bodied, creamy, and smooth. Overall, I really enjoyed this one, especially for uniqueness in the style category it's in. Don't think I'd get it again though."
""
"O: A pretty drinkable cream ale. Decent sweet malt and bitter hops make a balanced brew."
"This is what I always wanted cream ale to be. Will come back again and again."

"The style of ""cream ale"" can be an enigma in a way....there aren't that many of them and many people may avoid them because they're far from bold. This was pretty good though. Easy drinking, a great quaff out of a 16 ounce can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This definitely pushes the boundaries of what a cream ale can be--I thought adjunct grain was kind of a necessity for the style. Still, it's a damn good session, and yet another winner from Six Point."
""
"O: when i think cream ale i think of genny screamers and my appetite for beer goes away, this one is decent enough, sips nicely and isnt overly heavy, enjoyable, if its in the cooler ill grab it but thats about as far as i would go"
"Super drinkability, a new highwater mark for this style IMO. This is the kind of cream ale I would drink on semi-regular basis or more so"
"Maybe there is a place for this in the giant stadium of beers, but it misses all the bases for me. In the tall can from Food and Friends in Philadelphia."
"I would recommend this to someone who likes a subtle, sweet, very malty type of brew. Seems like a nice Summer beer as well."
"Overall:"
"3.0 D: Not a bad brew, but there's enough similar, yet tastier ones out there to forget about this."
""
""
""
""
"D: This was not anything special. Maybe I just don't like cream ales, but the scent and taste were basic and not very appealing. The body was too light, and the finish wasn't smooth (considering how bland it was otherwise). Not recommended."
""
""
""
"O) Nice beer... Sweet Action is a good name, and a fair description of the beer. I won't have a problem finishing off the rest of the four pack I purchased. Give this one a shot."
""
""
"Highly recommended."
"D: Goes down very easy, nice on a summer's day, but at the same time, I am not loving it. I think the hop bitterness is a little too sharp for the style, i.e. I was hoping my wife would like this and she thinks it is too hoppy, very weird for a cream ale. All in all, definitely worth trying."

"O-delicious cream ale, the best of this type that I have had, a pleasure to drink multiples"
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is really smooth + creamy and extremely easy to drink. I enjoy and have enjoyed this beer quite a bit over the last couple of years. Definitely a beer that you could drink throughout a session."
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I'm glad I only bought one - I was expecting more flavor and would be sorely disappointed if I had to finish off a 4 pack of these. Balance is good, but it's too much balance here. While I can say I easily finished the beer, I have no desire to reach for another. Oh well, not every beer can be great."
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer but it's no cream ale in terms of nose or taste profile; more along the lines of APA."
""
""
"Flavor also has an apple character, lightly sweet at first becoming bready like a buttered biscuit, then drying out with crisp and lightly bitter finish. The buttery diacetyl note is a little distracting but seems acceptable in small amounts. Might give another try down the road, but it's not my favorite from Sixpoint."
""
"Overall, this was about as clean and crisp as a session ale gets. Not the best sessionable ale I have ever had or the best pale/cream ale around by any means but quite good. I don't need to revisit it anytime soon but I am glad I did here and quite acceptable to find on draft at a random bar in NYC."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the first for me in a long time of this style. I would imagine it is a little hop forward with an initial bite that I don't recall on other cream ales. However, that being said, it's a well crafted, great tasting brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: I love cream ales so I was a bit put off by this beer as it was not what I would call a cream ale. Closer to an American Red/Amber in my opinion, however overall a pretty good beer. It has a great balance, albeit a bit hop forward, while not being overly bitter. Just don’t call it a cream ale cuz it isn’t. 34 IBU’s should disqualify it as being called such."
""
""
"O- Good for what it is. NOt a beer I would drink normally or often but wouldn't turn one down."

"This beer tastes god, but I do not think it is a cream ale. Toooo bitter. But I like it either way."
""
""
""
"Dino hooked this up. Not a style I'd typically purchase but that' cool. Poured from pint can to pint glass the beer pours a clear golden yellow with a decent 1 finger white head, some retention and lacing. Actually looks inviting. The nose is a gentle blend of light toasted malt, a distinct citrus fruit, with a hint of earthy resin. The flavor is very much the same. Hoppier than I expected, a welcome addition. Blends well with the gentle toasted malt and fruity sweetness. Not overly sweet or bitter, very nice, just right. Finishes creamy and clean. Light bodied and well carbonated. Overall, a welcome treat! Easily the best cream ale I've had. Recommended!"
"Not at all what I expected from a cream ale - I suppose every brewery has its own interpretation. The brewer's website states this ale is ""part pale ale, part wheat, part cream ale"". However you define it, it is highly drinkable and worth seeking out."
""
"Overall, an interesting beer and the type of beer I could drink any time of year. Good balance of malty sweetness with the hop bite and citrus flavor."
"Overall impression - India Cream Ale? Sweet Action suffers from being unfocused and one dimensional. Drinkable for sure; nothing wrong with a hoppy cream ale, I reckon."
""
""
"Overal: you see it buy it it is worth more than its looks. Marzen meets your Vienna lager. This beer had a little bit of everything and definitely worth everything it represents. Salud!"

"O- Would be a good cadidate to break someone in from the world of macros to the world of craft beers. Certainly tasty, and something different."
"Overall - Im shocked, this is the first cream ale ive had! Think mostly because its not a popular style and alot of the top craft brewerys even bottle this style. That being said, its hard for me to compaire this style, since this is the only one ive had. But all i can do is just tell you how i feel about it. Its light, smooth, low alcohol makes its easy to drink. Nice spice kick along with a mix of fruity hops and nutty malts. Its nice combo of a few styles with neither being over the top. I cant wait to try more cream ales, im just worried that sixpoint might make the best one."
"O: I could drink a bunch of these back to back, an amazing, simple yet very flavorful session beer. Terrific stuff."
""
"Bottle: Poured a medium bright amber color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of semi-sweet caramel malt with light citrus hoppy notes. Taste is also a good mix between some caramelized malt with a light hoppy finish with subtle notes of citrus. Body is about average with good carbonation. Nice session style beer with limited complexity."
"So back to the question- is Sixpoint's Cream Ale considered a craft beer because it's a microbrewery who created such? It is when it tastes more like a Pale Ale. One thing's for certain- this ain't your father's Cream Ale."
"Overall (4.0): Cream ales aren’t exactly my thing, but this beer is another very nice canned offering from Sixpoint. It really is perfect for hanging around a fire, or just being outdoors in general. It’s distinctive, and makes cream ales seem like a more attractive category than I ever would have granted on my own. Considering how much this improved as it warmed, I’d love to try this on cask—could be dynamite."
"The medium body edges toward lighter. It's creamy, as expected, and pretty smooth after just a nip of crispness. A little more heft would add some depth, but it certainly works regardless."

"Really nice sessionalble beer. I would drink this beer again. May be somewhat off of the style."

"Overall, not a beer I would buy if I wanted a cream ale. I don't so no problem there."

"The slight off-taste really brings this one down. I love a good session ale (whatever the ABV), but if they're not perfect, they can rapidly become suspect. This one is close, but the aftertaste really corrupts a good experience. Not bad, not good, decent enough."

""
"Overall: This one strikes me as a nice mix between a light IPA and a saison. Not a bad beer but my least favorite from the brewery so far. I would probably choose other beers ahead of this one"
"Pours an orangeish gold with a chill haze. Little head and some lacing. Smell of citrus hops, corn and harsh raw grain. In the flavor, earthy hops, restrained sweetness, corn, pale malts. Not overly sweet, the hops do a fair job with the bittering. Faint presence of alcohol. Medium bodied feel with low carbonation. Overall, this ""cream ale"" has alot going on in the bitterness department, makes for an interesting drink. Stands out as a cream ale, hoppy, which makes it good."
"O: Hops give such a fresh and crisp sensation that it tastes somewhat like a wet hopped beer. Then the malt and creaminess kick in, with a touch of honey and a light hop bitter finish. Everything comes out balanced and complimentary. Glad to have Sixpoint in Indiana! Will buy again and again."
""
"O: A slightly above average beer -- it's certainly odd -- but not one that I would recommend to others. I gave one can away, drank one at a party, and don't relish drinking the last one after this can is done. Still, an interesting experiment and a fun cream ale."
""
""
"D: This one is really easy to drink. It's a great balance of sweet and bitter. Other cream ales would do well to take some lessons from this one."
"$2.95 a single. Dated best by May 2012"
"This is one of the better cream ales I've had with more hops and a nice clean feel. Very, very drinkable."
""
"O: This is a beer that doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a weak pale ale or a muddy pilsener? Maybe I should chalk it up to me not 'getting' this style of beer. Probably won't revisit this in the future."
"This beer pours a light to medium bodied orangish dull copper in color with a creamy white, one finger head. It's much darker than I anticipated. The aromas are different than I expected. I get some slightly sweet amber malts, light citrus, light happiness, and it has a certain creaminess to it, indicative of a can.The flavors are light and smooth. I get a lot of smooth malts with citrus accents and a ever so slight hop bitterness. It is incredibly smooth and creamy, obviously made for a can. It's solid, and much different than other cream ales I've had. It has more body and isn't as session able yet has more flavor and more to offer."
"Had at Bobbique. Pours a cloudy amber hue, heads big but leaves quickly. Scent is of husk and grains, very little hops can be detected in the scent. Taste had a hint of sweet corn, and grains, malts can be tasted but not much hops. Mouthfeel is sort of creamy, delicate. This was a fine cream ale. Super drinkable."
"Cheers!"

"pours a hazy yellow with two fingers of white creamy head. good retention and lacing were noticed. smell and taste were very hoppy for a cream ale. lots of citrus and sweet malts, also noticed a sawdust smell and taste. full body with good carbonation and a bitter finish. overall this is a decent cream ale."

"Poured out as a golden yellow color with a foamy white head on top. The lacing is decent along with the retention. The smell of the beer has a nose full of Cascade hops. The flavors of the beer is citrusy with a good fresh flavor and bitterness in the back end. The mouthfeel of the beer is soft and creamy feeling, subtle carbonation and just smooth in general. Overall it's hoppy and clean, it's also refreshing in my opinion, I found it to be enjoyable."

" The flavor is somewhat nutty tinged with a hint of caramel upfront and mild toasted flavor with a lightly piney hop in the mid-taste. There is a slight lemony astringent aspect with the mild tannic flavor as the carbonation relaxes slightly. The flavor verges on tropical fruit and pineapple with the peppery hops holdy on into the last sips with a subtle tanginess of grapefruit and tangerine. The flavor has a woody note, not sure if it is hop or malt derived, but the flavor seems drying with a light yeasty tinge with a moderately astringent flavor as it ends. This is a unique beer, I can't say it is the best of the style but it is interesting and held my interest the whole time with a nice hoppy aspect and mostly dry texture that appeals to me."

"Many thanks to Beenitty for the chance to taste this- I have never even heard on Sixpoint brewery. Poured from can into 512 glass. Pours a cloudy bright orange color, nice thick white head fills the glass and recedes slowly. Lacing all over glass. Smell- a very unique citrus mixed with cream soda aroma. Hops present themselves in a lemon/lime citrus aroma. Taste- a medicinal flavor blasts my tongue. Hop bitterness comes in waves, but the sweetness I was expecting from the cream ale component is missing. Its watery. Something is wrong with this beer. Not good. It will be tough getting through this can."
"Smells pretty good...yeasty citrusy malts, and as always, a bit ""different"" somehow. Slight bitter flavor, but smooth. Not overly enjoyable on the tongue, but like other Sixpoints I have had, its some kind of signature funk/bitter. While unique, its just not for me...but I wouldn't bash this brew."

"Big thanks goes out to the BA who sent me this one as an extra in a past trade (can't remember his userhandle). Served from can into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, bubblegum, and subtle fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, fruity hops, bread, and a subtle earthiness. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. When I saw that this was a Cream Ale out of a can, I was intrigued. When I cracked open the can and poured into into a glass I was amazed. This was a really well made Cream Ale and a great example of the style. The bubblegum in the nose was the dominate note by far, which was quite nice. A well done brew that I would love to enjoy again anytime."
"Sixpoint Brewing feels that style guidelines are something to be created rather than learned. And usually the stuff they come up with is as wonderful as it is original. Sweet Action, however, though a worthy enough creation, did not quite do it for me, personally. But given this brewery's otherwise spotless lineup I'll likely give it another shot."

"O- I haven't had too many cream ales, but I can't imagine any being better than this. Really fantastic beer."
"Overall: While not my favorite cream ale I would drink this again for sure. I really enjoyed this and can see this being a favorite in the summer months."

"A hazy, dirty peach-colored beer with a thin creamy lace. Stone fruits in the nose with a deep floral hop aroma and mild cellar mustiness. Crisp carbonation, then creamy. Immediate white pepper, with fleshy stone fruits in the flavor and a bready malt character beneath. Citric hop snap rides in off the carbonation and melds into the malts, impart- ing soft floral and herbal notes, followed by ripe melon suggestions with some mild esters, thanks to the Simcoe hops. Dries up nicely with a lingering splash of melon and bready sweetness. Touted as balancing sweetness and bitterness, it lives up to this most awesomely. This is one deliciously sexy beer from a can."
"O - Not a fan. I don't know if I'm getting bad cans or if I'm just extremely aware of certain flavors in their beer, but no more Sixpoint for me."

"I get this beer in theory. A hopped up take on a Cream Ale. Unfortunately the hop profiles in these canned Sixpoint offerings are so inconsistent and this one displayed the same overly raw character to it that really turned me off from their Autumnation as well. I didn’t really care for this at all. This beer is much better on draft."
""
"O: I like this beer but wish Sixpoint would move away from the strong biscuit maltiness as it zaps the hoppiness and detracts from the drinkability. Still, Sweet Action delivers in the grand scheme of things."

"D/O- I really enjoyed this one. Definitely my favorite cream ale thus far and I wouldn't be surprised if it stays that way for a long time. I would akin this to a Samuel Adams Boston Lager or Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in that it'd be a go-to if one were looking for a flavorful low(ish) ABV session(able) brew. Thanks for the chance mcb4538!"

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style but hoppier than most which I consider a positive trait, this is a very nice flavorful lighter beer to pound down for a long time."
"Overall, solid cream ale, i like it more on the biscuit side (empire cream) but this is the hoppier more bitter side. Still well done."
"16 oz can courtesy of myspoonistoobig. Thanks Michael. Pours a cloudy copper amber with a small light tan head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing. The aroma is caramel, some breadiness as well as some light citrus. The initial taste is sweet caramel, followed by some breadiness and some light grapefruit. Light bodied. Creamy mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation."
"Haven't had too many cream ales, but I like the smooth flavors here, and it's rather flavorful for the low ABV. A beer that's both easy drinking and good tasting."
"O - Sweet Action started off on the right foot with the dry hopping and first sip...but something went terribly wrong...maybe a bad can? it was not past the best by date...maybe I should give this another shot?"
"D: love good craft beer out of a can. especially a hogsleg. i could definitely sling a few of these back with ease. nice range with the malty/corny sweetness and the active presence of fresh american hops."
"From the can stamped: Best Before 17Nov2011. Sampled on November 5, 2011. The pour is a handsome medium amber with a small head. The aroma is decently hopped with a dash of meaty fruit like peaches. Some yeast hints. The body is quite good for the style at a little north of medium. The taste has this hoppy, honey-like, creaminess with low bitterness. Fairly easy to drink on the whole."
"Quite a nice style representation!"
"SPOT ON, MUST HAVE!"
"O -- A very nice quaffer that has a fresh character and a very cask-poured feel to it."
"O - sa few glitches, but at the very least this one's a solid session brew that does its style proud"
"I can’t say that cream ale is really a favorite style of mine but I’ve been a big fan of Sixpoint in general so I gave this one a shot. Wasn’t all that up my alley however. It’s a hazy dark gold beer with a decent head and solid lace. Aroma is definitely sweet and malty, although the hops are noticed, and in the tasting the hops are definitely more forward than is typical of this style (by far) but it is a Sixpoint after all. The flavor is sweet and a little spicy, with lots of biscuity malt as well. Mouthfeel is nice enough, creamy as expected, with medium body and good carbonation; overall refreshing and a good session candidate. I would almost always reach for a Righteous or Bengali Tiger before this one though. If you like cream ales I would definitely give this one a shot; a big step up from Genny or what-have-you, although the hoppiness makes this beer a bit untypical of the style. Lack of corn or other adjuncts (I think) certainly raises the overall quality."
"Too malt forward for me. I like my cream ales a lot lighter than this."
"D: Amazingly drinkable, if this beer was easier for me to get, it would defiantly be my go-to beer that I'd always have some on-hand."
"Overall, a good beer, but confuses my palate. It tastes like an Abbey Singel. I enjoyed it, but it seems to miss the mark as a cream ale."
"O: About average of a beer kinda homebrew tasting almost like too much water. Cant really pinpoint any flavors becuase they dissapear fast."
"O: A tasty beer that can be quite sessionable, but lacks the complexity and depth of other Sixpoint offerings."
"Can at the dutch, pours an amber haze, small head with minimal retention. Nose is lighty crackyness. Taste has sharp citrus bitterness mulded by undertones of sweet cereal and malt. Mouth is light and slick. Minimal carbonation. Tasty little cream ale."
"This beer was a little too rough and medicinal for me. Definitely only one at a time."
"I enjoyed the hop profile but this one isn't for me."
"Off tap this beer was a cloudy amber color with one finger of off-white head that retained itself fairly well and left broken lacing. The aroma was light, mostly biscuit malt, some sweet malt and a hint of vanilla. The flavors seemed odd to me for a cream ale. I tasted an indiscernible blend of specialty grains, sweet malt, a medicinal/herbal element, hints of spices and a finish of citrusy hops. Very complex and it went from a sweet start to a dry finish as I tasted it. But the medicinal element gave it a Dayquil element (as my gf put it) and neither of us were impressed. The mouthfeel was ok, the body medium/light and the carbonation good."
"This is really a well done beer, it's hoppy, sweet, malty and has some interesting other qualities to give a nice definition in flavor. I'm not sure why the buttered popcorn came in the taste. Generally this is a sign of diacetyl, which could be the case. Either way, it sort of hindered the taste for me. A solid offering nonetheless."
"O: Overall a decent cream. Loaded with speciality grains, perhaps a bit more so then my taste per style. Big flavor and body per style loses some of its easy drinkability ease as well."
"Overall I'd say that its half decent."
"Overall: A pleasant surprise. I'm not particularly fond of cream ales, but this was a welcome change of pace. Another good beer, Sixpoint. 2 for 2 so far."
"Cheers!"
"This is unlike any other cream ale that I've encountered. Granted, I've only had three others, but Sweet Action stands out because of its interesting use of hops. It adds a nice balance."
"Overall. Not a bad beer, just nothing too exciting. Easy drinking and pretty refreshing."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a hazy orangey amber, with a 3 finger nice thick creamy white head. Head lasted a few minutes before leaving a thin layer, with some great clinging to the sides. Aroma was a bit strange. A tad of sweetness was offset by a bit of bitterness, but ended up to be a slightly strong sweet cream aroma with an undertone I couldn't place. Flavor was equally tough to place. Seemed to me to be strongly of a rice or corn flavor, not what I would expect for something called ""Sweet"" or cream. Felt decent, plenty of tickle from the carbonation, and was a decent coating. Overall this didn't do it for me. Not at all impressed, really seemed to be a low end macro almost, not a highly rated craft beer."
"Growler from Marcy Beverage. Pours a translucent golden orange color with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Smells sweet and hoppy. Whiff of citrus hops, namely orange peel. A bit herbal. Taste is sweet. Good amount of hop flavor with more of that spicy orange peel taste. Slightly bitter at the end with some herbal notes. Really crisp and easy to drink at a quick pace. Creamy mouthfeel. I wasn't in a rush to try this one since it was a Cream Ale, but it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. This seems to be a perfect beer for the warm months. Overall, certainly worth having again."
"O: A good beer, I'm certain this would be the bees knees on nitro - absolutely certain."
"All in all a very good canned beer. I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep reddish amber color with a smallish fluffy white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Smells of earthy herbal hops and biscuit bready malt. Hints of lemony dish soap turned me off a bit. Taste is malty but not a sweet as I had expected from a cream ale. Lots of bitter earthy hops keep this less balanced than the side of the can would lead you to believe. Medium body and carbonation level, slick almost sticky mouthfeel. This one grew on me as I drank it and as it warmed, but I really don't see the attraction here. Its not really a cream ale, but its a pretty good drinker."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, faint lingering feel with sticky malts. I don't really enjoy cream ales but this is still a drinkable offering from Sixpoint (who have so much better to give)."
"o: I really like this beer and even better that it comes in pint cans! It is a great, refreshing beer with a lot of flavor from what I thought was a simple style."
"This is okay. It's pretty drinkable but a little sweet (I realize it's called Sweet Action). If I was to rate to style I might bump this up a bit, but I don't do that. This is just a mediocre offering that could be good for certain occasions."
"The feel is light and the carbonation is medium. A solid offering here, really glad to see these guys a little more local."
"O: It's alright, not what I would expect from a cream ale. Still good, though. Cheers."
"Period."
"I think this might be my second cream ale ever, so here goes. 16oz. can served in a tumbler. Pours a beautiful honey-orange hue with a semi-hazy clarity, and a rocky, 1.5 inch cream-colored head. Head eventually recedes into an 1/8th inch skim with some residual spots of lacing present during the tasting. Not much to the nose - a little grassy with perhaps a kiss of hops. I also get a slightly herbal quality. Taste expresses cereal malts, a light earthy bitterness and a hint of citrus. Mouthfeel is light-medium; however closer to light. Carbonation is lively and evenly distributed from beginning to end. There is also a slight acidity that kisses the salivary glands. As I'm not overly familiar with the style, I'll start with the obvious. This is an easy drinking, simple beer that would be welcome at a barbecue. It has some pilsner-esque qualities with a little something else happening at the same time. That said, I would more likely gravitate towards an APA than a Cream Ale; however, a very respectable beer nonetheless."
"Great stuff."
"Overall - I've been impressed with all of the sixpoint beers I've tried so far. I find they all kind of have a similar taste. Looking forward to trying more of their products."
"overall, an interesting beer. definatly one of the better cream ales ive had, but its a style im not crazy about. not something i would buy again, but i like what sixpoint did with it, and its atleast worth a try."
"Overall: This is a great beer. Nice and refreshing and perfectly hopped. I'm a bit fan."
"Poured from a pounder can with a bright amber orange slightly hazed body with a large light khaki head forming thick and rising well above the rim of my glass. Lacing is well banded and even down the sides of my chalice. Aroma has more great smelling cereal grains with a bit of orange peel and marmalade sweetness in the background. It's like hanging out in the grain room it really gives the experience of mashing in freshly cracked malts. Flavor wise it's interesting I was expecting something one dimensionally sweet, because of the cream ale style and the name Sweet Action. However this beer is all about the balance between the malts and hops and even more so in this case it's got a nice solid lingering citrus hop bitterness with each sip. Each sip has a nice malty diverse flavor not just sweet, but a blend of diferent flavors hit the palate. It's actually quite dry even semi spicy with a dry yeast nuttiness going on, it's hard to pick out the hops used here not typical alpha acid hops used in most micros today something earthier. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an even nice flowing carbonation really nothing harsh about it and like I said the dry finish only helps the drinkability. Overall a quality beer out of Brooklyn NYC, I'm glad I got the chance to try it."
"Pours a hazy orange with a 2 inch puffy white head that fades to a foamy, craggy cap. A very nice latticework of lacing forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of nice citrus zest and herbal hops with a slight honey smell as the beer warms. Taste is a nice balance between sweet malt and citrus zest and herbal hops. Mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good cream ale with a nice balance between the malt and hops."
"Very nice, refreshing, well-balanced ale. Super light, would pair perfectly with pizza or bbq. Only the second Sixpoint beer I've tried but I've enjoyed both this and Righteous Ale very much. I don't mind the 16oz cans at all. In fact I like their different style."
"Overall it's hard to say I liked it since I had to really look around how aggressive the hops and pale malts clashing hit me in a bad way. Maybe it's the can that makes the malts so harsh?. Will have to try their other beers and find a favorite."
"Bright fruity aroma with a sweet malt backbone, and a flavor that follows. Crisp on the palate as well while remaining smooth. A great ale that retains it's approachability while still maintaining enough flavor and aroma to interest the serious craft drinker."
"T) A pleasant surprise of a beer. I don't know if I would say it is a ""cream ale"". I see the characteristics but according to Sixpoint's website this is a golden amber - not sure if I agree with that either. A good drinkable brew."
"One finger of beige head over translucent copper. Golden at the edges. Very hoppy on the nose, with resiny pine and grapefruit citrus. I even pick up some alcohol in the aroma. Flavors reveal the malt--a little sweet, but thankfully not too bready. The hops are really a swift kick to the palate. Medium sticky mouthfeel, which is something I love in a hoppy beer. Sixpoint is becoming a staple in my beer supply."
"O - More of a belgian wit than a cream ale. Not really sure where they got the idea to call this a cream ale. A decent beer, but not the strongest offering from Sixpoint."
"Overall this is a nice, well balanced, beer.  This is only the second cream ale I've tried, but it's the best."
"O - Overall, I enjoyed this beer. That being said I really didnt think this tasted like a cream ale. There was just too much going on."
"O - don't know the style too well, but this seems pretty good for it. Some funny things reminding me of different types of gum, but not a bad beer."
"Pours a nice clear orange ish yellow. Not much head but well carbonated. Smells hopper than i expected. Smells a bit sweet as well. Tastes... Interesting. Sweet, creamy, low flavour profile. Well carbonated. The mouthfeeel is interesting. Overall the beer is much better than any other cream ale I've had. Definitely worth trying"
"Tastes a lot like a great mai bock that has been spiked with more noble hops than usual, but presents the creamy silky texture of an excellent cream ale. I don't really care about the style confusion, because I like where it has led me! A very good session beer that comes across as a better than average sturdy workhorse of a cream ale. It's definitely piqued my curiosity to see what else Sixpoint can offer, as it is the second time I've been pleasantly surprised by their better-than-average canned offerings."
"Sampled from a can, best by September 20, 2011. Dirty copper orange in color with a deep, murky haze. Poured with a dense foamy white head with decent retention. Citrus grapefruit and orange aromas with spicy and malty undertones. Almost like a light belgian IPA. Creamy smooth with a tangy resinousness feel at the finish. A nice balance of sweet caramel malt and tangy citrus grapfruit hops with a belgian-like spicyness in the background. Very unique in every respect. Love the pint size serving. This was an excellent beer no matter what style is attached to it."
"The body is medium with a creamy feel. Pretty solid."
"Truly the epitome of a ""mehhhh"" beer. Nothing really wrong with it, but nothing to really recommend it either. The A- review score is a complete mystery to me. Based on some of the reviews I've read about this beer, I'm almost wondering if there was something off with the keg at Al's."
"Overall this beer is a winner. I'm amazed just how drinkable it is. This is my idea of a great session beer (albeit a bit strong), because I could drink alot of it. It certainly is appropriate for the hot weather also. Too bad I only have one."
"O: Another homerun from Sixpoint. 4-4. Each can I've had has been spectacular. Really, really impressed. Pair that with the beautiful decision to can the beer and my only problem is figuring out which four pack I want to bring home this week."
"Chalk up another win for canned beer. My perception of beer in a can continues to be reshaped. Thanks to bartrash for for sharing this with me. Can pours a beautiful orange-ish liquid with a meager head. This stuff is the epitome of drinkable. True to it's name, it does have a sweetness to it. Nice nose and mouthfeel....this is a GREAT summer session beer. How one could tire of drinking this is beyond me. If you haven't given canned beer a fair go lately, you're long over due. Start here."
"I liked this, but not as much as other versions of cream ale. They did a nice job and kinda turbocharged the style. Very easy to put down these tallboys."
"O - A really great ale and super drinkable"
"O: Nice beer. Quaffs real easily after mowing the lawn. I'm not terribly familiar with this style (though I drank a lot of Genny Cream Ale growing up), and I know the guys at Sixpoint pride themselves on not necessarily brewing ""to style"" anyway, but whatever you call this, it's good."
"O - Just enough flavor and body to offer a decent brew. Nothing is standing out here to me, but no gripes either. Smooth."
"16 ounce can, best before Sept. 20, 2011. Pours hazy orange amber color with a 2 finger off white head with good retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, pine and other light fruits. Nice hoppy aromas, a bit light as well. Taste of tons of light fruitiness; honey, orange, spices, breadiness, and a bit of apricot. Big sweetness in the front and on the finish, with a bit of bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and body. Extremely drinkable and smooth. No alcohol in the taste or finish as expected. This is my first cream ale, and it is outstanding, extremely drinkable and tasty as well."
"Overall, its really great. Fantastic out of the can and better out of the glass."
"HV"
"Thanks Mikey! Pours a bright gold with a fluffy white head. Nose is citrus, hops, quite sweet, maybe a candy like note. Mouth is bright and a decent balance between lightly bitter hops, candied oranges, and light grains. Light, crisp body, light bitterness throughout, interesting candy sweetness. Nice stuff, if it was a bit drier I would push the score up."
"Good example of the style."
"O: Certainly one of the better cream ales I've ever had and a very nice, easy to drink beer. Perfect for the summer."
"taste - nicely understated hop profile; a bit of bitterness, some fruitiness. malt feels initially a little sweet, but finishes pretty clean. good mouthfeel, this is an easy drinker for sure."
"O: Quite refreshing and easy drinking. Well balanced yet leans slightly toward the bitter side. This would make a great gateway beer."
"Additional Notes -- Upon checking the reviews I notice that this is listed as the #1 Cream Ale - I'm not surprised."
"D: I like this version. For those of you that do not remember this is probably the 5th version of Sweet Action. Is has been a Belgian pale ala Sweet Reaction. Cream Ale. Pale. and a few other weird things. I like this version. One of the best cream ales out there. Might want to check the other NY cream ale up the river in Athens, NY as well. Love the cannage."
"I thought I would be able to drink this quicker due to the low alcohol and that it's not dark beer. I could only do about two gulps each time I reached for the glass. I don't know what it is but that's the way it is for me. This was a great beer and it knocks Bengali Tiger's ass in terms of just goodness, and this is coming from an IPA guy. I'll be picking up a can or two more when a new batch comes out."
"Solid brew."
"I like Sweet Action. Definitely not your traditional Cream Ale, but Cream Ales also tend to be sweet messes. Instead Sweet Action uses a variety of malts and leans on more a grain profile, while balancing the whole thing out with an infusion of American hops."
"Sweet Action pours a mildly hazy orange, with some definite tangerine highlights shining through with proper lighting. The pour yields about three fingers of white foam that crown the beer. Head retention is solid, and lacing is left in a web-like pattern down the side of the glass. Not a bad looking beer at all, though probably a little dark for a cream ale. The nose isn't particularly loud, but there's a definite grainy sweetness present, with a very lightly spicy hop character making itself known as well. No surprises as the beer travels across my palate, that same grainy, almost lightly cereal sweetness greets me with each sip, followed by just enough bitterness and hop flavor to nicely balance the beer. The body is nice and light, playing into the whole ""easy drinking"" angle, but the carbonation just falls a little bit dull, making the mouthfeel come across as a bit too slick at times. Sweet Action is a pretty good beer for what it's trying to be style wise, but it's not a beer I'm going to come back to again and again on my own. Probably my new go-to choice if I'm hosting mixed company (as far as micro vs macro) for a party though."
"Overall: A pretty good brew, though I like Righteous Ale and The Crisp better so far."
"O: A great brew to enjoy on a warm day!"
"Nice slow pour yielded a golden liquid with some dark brown hues. Off white two finger head with some sediment floating on top. The scent was malty and bready- taste was a perfect mix of the bitterness from the hops (not sure what kind of hops but very biscuity- fresh baked loaf of bread) and sweetness- not sure what shines through more but I guess that's the objective here. Really nice and balanced mouthfeel- easy drinking and beautiful. This is a session beer that packs a punch of flavor. This is a beer done right. I love it and I will continue to support Sixpoint. Seek this out people...."
"Although this is one of Sixpoint's highest rated offerings. I prefer The Crisp and Righteous. Still, Sixpoint has done much to rightfully grab a share of the craft beer market in the Northeast and I love the 16 ounce cans."
"The beer is a dark amber color and pours a foamy two finger head. Like the name assumes this beer is slightly citrusy and sweet but has a decent thickness to the malt. There is a distinct hop profile that I can't put my finger on, it is very nicely blended and highlighted by the malt and other flavors of the beer. The mouth feel is really remarkable, it's much lighter than you would assume. I could have several of these beers in a sitting and not get bored of them."
"O: A really nice beer for this time of the year. Clean, simple, and refreshing."
"O: Definitely one of the best cream ales I've had. It's nice to see some low gravity, easy drinking beers that are also full of flavor."
"Overall quite enjoyable, nothing like the Cream Ale I had at Bray's but a still great enjoyable beer. Reminds me more of a simple good English Bitter."
" Overall, a wonderful brew that will be underrated i'm sure, because it's simple. The hops will not attack your face but they are a delight in any case!"
"Taste is a bit soapy from beginning to end. Pretty much follows the nose, sweet to start, moderate spicing in the middle, and closes with piney hoppiness, and a light alcoholic warming. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is good as well. Had hoped for a bit more depth of malt flavor, but a good beer in its style."
"O: Overall quite good, definitely one of the better cream ales I've had. I would definitely buy this again."
"O- Easily the best cream ale I've ever had. One of the smoothest, most quaffable beers I have ever encountered."
"o - Overall a pretty good, and very interesting beer. I had 2 cans of it and that was enough for me. Not something I would pick up every time, but something I'd be willing to revisit one day."
"The feel of this beer is a little crisp but dry as well. It goes down easy with a slight aftertaste that is nice."
"Pours a really bright and vibrant orange amber with a one finger white head. Aroma of sweet grapefruit, peach and mango. Flavor starts off with peach goodness. Not out of place at all for such a unique flavor to beer. Sweet grapefruit, crisp pine hops add a great balance of sweet and bitter. Hints of toasted grains as well. Creamy mouthfeel stays true to the style. Very light and crisp"
"I like the unusual flavours going on with this beer and I'm having no trouble drinking up; very good drnkability..very nice beer!"
"Not a bad beer at all. Refreshing and this could be considered a summer beer. I wouldn't really call this Sweet Action; it's not crazy sweet, I get more of a balanced bitterness by the malt. It's worth a shot."
"O: This is no cream ale. It's a decent beer but in no way shape or form a cream ale. I rated higher for taste but knocked it for style."
"Overall Sweet Action is very balanced, drinkable, tasty, and fresh. The beer is not too bitter or sweet. It definitely grows on you so if you are not impressed with the first can then give it another chance and try to look for the delicate flavors and aromas."
"D - A great beer that I would gladly drink multiple of in a session... I don't buy many cases, but this one is case worthy... A true testament to balance between malt and hops... Very nicely done by a brewery that continues to impress me..."
"I keep this on hand as much as possible now and hope to have it in my rotation for the rest of the summer."
"overall this was about as clean and crisp as a session ale gets, no doubt."
"overall a decent to good beer but after the first few rounds of really great beers from sixpoint this one was my least favorite not saying it was bad but in my opinon the other ones are simply better"
"This is my first six point beer but it will not be the last. This beer pours a hazy brown color. It has smells of citrus like lemons and grapefruit. The the taste of this cream is great. It is very to style and has a great malt background to balance out the hops. overall I am very impressed with this and makes me want to try all the beers six point has to offer."
"A good beer that has a general fruity flavor to it. Quite balanced, neutral flavors. Good beer to BBQ with or tailgate. Very solid."
"The flavor matches the smell profile. Although the can states ""more sweet", I find this beer to be more bitter, particulary during and after the swallow. Good body with an appropriate amount of carbonation."
"D- this is my brew. It's delicious and can be slammed dunked in this RAINY summer. Love sixpoint!"
"This is quite nice, flavorful but light, really refreshing."
"I love the new Sixpoint cans but Sweet Action is still not my favorite brew from this brewer."
"I don't know how this defines as ""cream ale"" exactly, however this is absolutely delicious and brewed to great standards!"
"Overall great session beer one of my favorite summer beers."
"Pours a hazy shadowed golden pale color, visibly carbonated, with a HUGE stiff off white head that resists fading and leaves an impressive amount of Belgian lacing behind. My first sense of the nose raised a crisp pilsner note of spice followed quickly by a fruity peach. The mouth is creamy smooth, nicely carbonated, with a substantial presence to the body. Full flavored, nicely balanced spicy peach and sweet malts. Clean crisp finish to the mouth while the taste lingers nicely. The 5.2% ABV really lends to the overall drink-ability. Found these 4pk cans at Premier Gourmet in Kenmore NY...$2.50 ea or $9.50 for the pack. Really nice offering from team Sixpoint."
"Overall: With a name like Sweet Action I was hoping for the malts to be a bit more obvious and have more character. I had one prior to this review and the prominence of the hops made me think it was skunked, though its short stay in the freezer to cool it down probably numbed some of the malt flavors. The one at proper temperature was much better, however, and was a lot more palatable. I can see this being an excellent after-dinner beer on a summer evening."
"I suggest buying this beer when it presents itself."
"Lighter body, with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden. This beer seems to grow on me after a while. Some interesting flavors here. Worth a shot."
"overall, its a great brew. combines tons of different flavors and qualities with nothing dominating but everything working in harmony. doesn't quite fit into a cream ale category, I'd put this as a cross between a cream ale and an IPA maybe."
"Interesting blend of malt and hop flavor profiles, both are fairly prominent. Brings a lot of different things to the table and certainly worth trying."
"O: I think Sixpoint once described this as a half-IPA, and I can see that. The hops are prominent for the style (whatever that is), but not like in an IPA. I can drink this all night."
"Bill"
"Sweet Acton is certainly worth a try...."
"Drink- My first sixpoint beer. Very tasty and balanced. Its creamy, but turned upside down. Id like more of this. Also, more from them."
"This is gonna be one of my go-to session beers this summer. It's tasty enough to put under the flavor microscope, while still being drinkable and light enough to pound during a ballgame. Brooklyn's finest!"
"Overall-A high quality beer. I received as an extra in a trade and now I am in search of more. I see this beer and probably all of Sixpoints beers being just as sought after as Surly!"
"Many thanks go out to woodychandler for providing this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is big on hops and citrus. Taste is citrus up front, a good bit of hops, some malts are present, bitter for this style. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"O: well-balanced, smooth, clearly crafted by people in-the-know. But I'm not in love with the style."
"Poured into a pint glass, a hazy golden orange, with a foamy head that receded to a patchy layer of bubbles. Smell of sweet malts and orange zest with grassy and floral notes. Biscuity malt taste in the background with flavors of fresh juicy hops up front, peach and orange blossom, sugary, grassy and slightly herbal. Comes off more as an APA than a cream ale. Very smooth and medium-bodied, incredibly drinkable. Fresh, crisp, sweet."
"Sweet Baby Jesus! The Crack & Glug revealed a Cream Ale unlike any Cream Ale I have ever seen. This dang sure wasn't no Genny Cream, which I still have an affinity for, BTW. Two fingers of dense tawny head with great retention and a deep-orangish amber colored beer with a slight haze says either APA or BUPGOO! Sweet! Not sweet was the nose, which was grassy, minty and floral. Cream Ale just got schooled, yo! Mouthfeel was medium and there was a soft (as opposed to sharp) bitterness in the mouth. Sweet! This is as excited about a CANned beer as I have been in a while! Finish was mildly bitter, enough to sustain a hops junkie like me, but still mild enough not to drive off the uninitiated. Will this be going into my cooler? Does my main man, Sweet Sweetback, mistrust ""The Man""? Yo, bring it on!"
"For me though, I'll choose another. Still, cheers to Sixpoint. This beer is right in the wheelhouse for almost all of Brooklyn!"
"Overall: An interesting take on the cream ale with a decidedly unique take. It's refreshing and the 16 oz. tallboy is a format to die for."
"A semi clear golden orange with about an inch of big bubbly head. A lot of toffee and caramel in the nose with an orange rind/earthy hop aroma. The flavor has a sweet and candied malt texture. A good balance of fruity hop with a sugary malt body. A earthy almost piney texture finishes it off but the creamy sweetness subdues any hop bitterness leaving only the fruity flavor."
"O/D-Overall, I tried this last out of the four Sixpoint cans available in my area (Bengali, Righteous, Crisp). This one is my second favorite behind the Bengali. I was very impressed with the flavor tucked away in this can. Very sessionable; great for the warm weather. Overall, Sixpoint refuses to disappoint with the cans."
"Tastes like the aroma. Orange marmalade, candied tangerine, fresh baked bread, burnt sugar, whole grains, yeasty on the finish. Mouth is creamy and medium bodied. End is quick and slightly dry . Nice back porch beer."
"Overall: Great beer for almost everyone. Balanced flavors mean that hop lovers would enjoy it enough despite its malty characteristics and vice versa. If you are looking for a good brew to please a crowd, especially during a party, this would be a great route to go."
"Sweet Action has a light caramel sweetness to it. It's crisp and refreshing, but certainly full-bodied. I poured this can at fridge temperature, but didn't find too many additional layers of flavor as it warmed. The mouthfeel is, appropriately, creamy. A very easy beer to drink, though I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as a summer beer. Come fall (assuming these are still available in Boston), I will certainly buy another four-pack."
"Overall: Rating goes up here because this is incredibly flavorful for a ""small"" beer. Very drinkable. Balanced. Damn nice. A ""cream ale""?? I don't know about that... very well done. Better than the Double and Triple Actions too!"
"O-> First time having this one and I enjoyed it. This is a Cream Ale that doesn't really attempt to be anything that it's not. Really loved the balance and the smoothness in this one. Pretty delicious and I haven't really had too many a cream ale in my day. I will likely be revisiting this one. Cheers!"
"Would I buy more of it? - definitely. Great beer. Loved all 16 oz. of it and will certainly be buying more cubes!"
"This is a beer that runs right up the middle. The balance is really something; the clash –can you even call it that?– of sweet barley and bitter hops is really perfectly matched, and reminds me a lot of this year's Aprihop. Very quaffable and tasty, though I personally prefer ""The Crisp""."
"o - overall this is a really great take on a cream ale...the mouth was a bit of a turnoff and makes me feel like this isn't something I could drink all night long without getting sick of it, but to have a pint of this, definitely."
"Overall: None of the flavors stand out but the brew is easy to drink and refreshing on a summer day."
"O - Just a great product from Sixpoint and their canning releases are a win for me. There are woefully few top shelf cream ales and this is about as good as it gets. Great summer beer."
"D - Duper drinkable. The flavors stay interesting and complex enough while never feeling heavy. On the flip side, it also avoids feeling empty and watered down."
"O - this is unlike most cream ales I have had before."
"Interesting for a newly available 16 oz can as a serving means. Wouldn't run to get another 4 pack but look forward to sharing with others."
"A great beer. Great refreshing flavor, mouthfeel and aroma. Just a really great beer all around."
"Pours a clear golden color with a really nice white head. Good retention and some swell lacing. Good so far. The nose was really quite faint. There was a touch of floral hops with a bit of breadiness. Pretty tame. Really tame, in fact. The taste countered with an explosion of flavor. Perfect balance between light bready/grainy sweetness and floral and herbal hops. Nice and delicate. Very refreshing. Best cream ale, by far. The feel backed that up. It was nice and crisp with a solidly bitter finish. Really well done. Enthusiastic thumbs up, Sixpoint."
"The beer appears transparent and orange colored, with a good sized head that leaves ample lacing on the glass. The aroma is rather weak, with a light dose of malt. The flavor is really tasty, with a very subtle fruitiness and enjoyable malt flavors. This is by far the best cream ale I have ever had. The beer finishes with a healthy amount of bitterness, more so than expected. Overall, a very enjoyable beer. I can definitely see why this is the top rated cream ale."
"O - quite a beer. on a hot day i could see myself going through a twelve pack of this and just wanting more."
"Totally diggin' this beer, I haven't had it in so long. Got a very hay body of the orange/amber color, with a nice finger depth off-white head in a nonic pint. Smells very hoppy, like a citrus variety, grapefruit-y, and the taste is there too. It's got an English quality to it in the malt dept, more bread-y with of course, a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Very tasteful and refreshing beer, I can't wait to see it in a can."
"Overall interesting, some interesting flavors blended well, nothing too heavy, little sticky on the finish."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down very easy, and I find it to be very refreshing. It has a nice sweetness, but the mild hop flavor balances it quite nicely. I like this one, and I would try it again for sure."
"D- Good drinkability. A nice brew to revisit in the summer."
"Feel is smooth a quenching due to the excellent hop blend. Medium weight and a mild carbonation. Excellent drinkability makes this a top drawer session ale."
"Great drinkability with this brew. Can't even taste any alcohol in it and at a pedestrian 5.2% ABV, this feels like it was made for sessioning. It isn't very complex taste-wise, but it's balanced, well-made and tasty. Sixpoint definitely has a winner here. Glad I was able to have it and share it!"
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink and is quite sessionable."
"Overall this was an interesting beer, an amalgamation of a few different things but at its heart is a moderately hoppy cream ale. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability: The first beer I've had of this style, and a pretty good beer overall. Definitely strays a bit from other beers I've had on-tap, and this is something I would enjoy having again."
"Beer is medium to light in body and semi-malty. The flavors are all really subdued. There is an odd bitterness to this beer that I can't tell if its from mild hopping or over extraction. I guess it all comes together into a decent beer but not my favorite blonde by a long shot."
"Pours a copper color with minimal head, retention and lacing. Scent is of sweet carmel malts, faint orangy sweetness and musty, grassy hops. Taste brings a somewhat candied, fruity sweet backing to the honey and carmel tastes, but lingering is a somewhat stale grain taste. Hops are present but seem to enhance the sweetness. Medium bodied yet oily and chewy, very lightly carbonated. A decent beer that really didnt appeal to my tastes and seems more agressive than its classification."
"Slightly dry, hoppy mediu body which is on the fuller end of the spectrum. Creamy with hints of crisp light fruit, dry piney hops, pale malt, biscuit, apple, pear, sweet lactic creaminess and a dry earthy bitter hop finish. Excellently balanced and dangerously drinkable. I wasn't expecteing much from this beer but other than the aroma I really enjoyed it. Recommended!"
"Drinkability- I had another. It was particularly important for this place as a beer-wing-sports bar. I'd have it at a barbecue. For me personally it caught on fairly quick, which means it could been enjoyed at any point in time really."
"A good beer. Would like try it in bottled form. Cant drink tons though because I find it a bit too sweet."
"seems like a blend of very strong flavours in disarray. not my cup of tea."
"D - A bit too sweet to be really drinkable, for me anyway. Hop flavors are intense and quite impressive. Loads of flavor without a ton of bitterness. I would think this has to be consumed fresh for maximum enjoyment. Glad I got a chance to try this rather unique offering."
"Over all a pretty decent blond ale. Not a huge amount of flavor but its easy to drink and is pretty refreshing. Not a bad beer."
"Pours a cloudy light orange/ dirty blonde with dissipating white head. A seductive aroma of sweet malt, candy, honey, and wheat characteristics. Light hop flavors of citrus, light hop bitterness in the center and finish, floral notes, a dab of honey, and butter. Medium bodied with a solid malt foundation. An exceptionally sessionable ale that hits the sweet (but not too sweet) malts and balances it with hop bitterness better than trapeze artist. Sweet Action! Dude, what does mine say? Sweet Action!"
"Pours a medium gold with light carbonation and a perfect dense foamy head. Aroma of grapefruit and west coast hops emanate from the glass; almost suggesting a sweet taste sensation to follow. But alas, the flavor of this brew is outstanding; moderate to generous bitterness, slightly off dry and ultra smooth in the mouth. This beer reads like a lighthearted IPA without having hopping that is too over-saturated; which would disable the insane drinkability factor of this brew. Fresh and satisfying this is a brew that must be sampled given the opportunity. Bravo!"
"Overall- Very delicious and too easy to drink down quickly. 1 of the best I've had from sixpoint!"
"D-Quite! Spicy and tasty and very nice summer brew. I have been impressed with Sixpoint beers!"
"Poured a clear amber orange body with great head. A mild smell of plain hops and a little sweet malt. A medium body that is light to drink and has a nice vanilla sweet malt taste as it goes down. Mild hoppiness and the brew finishes with a dry hop bitterness. Not a complex beer but one that is nice to relax with."
"Poured a golden-orange color, with a very thin head, and spotty lacing. Smell was decidedly sweet...orange & pineapple...with some maltiness and some grassiness. The sweetness was way too overpowering in the flavor, like over-ripe pineapple and orange, with a dry grassy/herbal finish. The flavor was mitigated somewhat by the soft, thin-bodied mouthfeel, but the sweetness was just over the top. Not much balance. Overall, it tasted like a thin-bodied double-ipa, with huge amounts of citrus and no bitter hop balance. Was very surprised to get this result, after reading all of the stellar reviews and awards. Out of respect, I'll give it a second shot."
"Drinkability: This beer is light crisp clean and very drinkable. Although it is not particularly complex it is well made and tasty. I'm certainly ready for a second by the time I finish and I won't hesitate to have this one again, particularly during an evening of dining and conversation with friends."
"Drinkability: this beer was extremely quaffable and a definite session ale. Simple profile but flavorful. Worth seeking this one out."
"While I remain confused that this (Sweet Action) is the beer I had, the beer I had was great.. (and listed as Sweet Action)"
"D - This would be an excellent macro replacement/ballpark brew. Just some solid easy drinking beer!"
"D: Pretty highly drinkable - as Alex said ""it's be good to have at Cubs games", which sums it up for me pretty well. It doesn't have a ton of great flavor, but when you want to drink a ton of beer you don't necessarily want your palate getting bombarded. I'm necessarily craving more and more though so that doesn't help the score."
"Mouthfeel on this offering from sixpoint is medium-bodied with a slightly dry finish. Drinkability is good, this beer tastes good and goes down easy. Sixpoint continues to impress with their beers."
"Even when I went back to the beer with a ""clean"" palate, I was unable to get a lot off this brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, smooth, and chewy. Very nice drink."
"D - Nice sessionable blonde ale with a fine balance of hop and malt flavors. Not as memorable as the other Sixpoint offerings I've had, but quite tasty nonetheless."
"excellent session beer...the hop bitterness invites you back after each sip to try more...very very refreshing"
"Overall, I find this to be an excellent session brew and one that I have visited, and will hopefully be able to continue visiting. Really enjoyable, and I think a great craft to offer up to newcomers wanting to try something good but accessible."
"Drinks nicely. Good hop quotient and could be close to sessionable. Good job."
"Listed as an APA, at the bar and sometimes this bar gets their facts confused so I hope this either a typo and I'm not drinking something else. Pours a light amber color, grainy hops come through on the nose. Taste is sweet maltiness with a sutle hop finish. A really well balanced and complex for a session beer. Another great beer from Sixpoint."
"i haven't had many beers from sixpoint so i leapt at the chance to try another one at the publick house and monk's cell in brookline. hazy and golden... spicy hop aroma... full, flavorful hop taste that matches well with fruity, peach malts. this really impressed me... a perfect session beer."
"Poured a deeper and hazy golden color with an aveeraged sized off white head. Aromas of citrus, caramel, a little bready and lightly earthy. Tastes of the same breadiness, caramel, and lighter citrus. Light lacing left on the glass. Not a bad session ale and quite tasty for a Cream Ale."
"Overall, this beer rocked. The balance of hops and sweetness was perfect. Sweet action is a perfect name for this beer."
"ordered one not really knowing it's style, but knowing that sixpoint brews some solid beers - and this is winds up being one of the best i've had from them - straw color with good head action - really fragrant and tasty sweet - good balance of fruit/citrus notes - i could drink a bunch of these easy"
"Drinks nicely. Good hop quotient and could be close to sessionable. Good job."
"Had this great session beer at PJ's in South Jersey. First, it is a great looking beer. Dark amber at the top and it fades towards yellow. Not too much smell, but may be the tap system or my poor sense of smell. Taste had a nice malty taste which finishes with a hop bitterness. Not incredible, but great for a session beer. Actually perfect for a session beer."
"3.6/5"
"Had on tap at TPH. Pourd into a shaker pint. Ordered this beer after a friend did, because teh aroma was soo sweet! Had no idea it was a blond. Would have guessed a fresh hop or hoppy pale ale of some sort. Wonderful citrus aroma. Taste is citusy, with a candy-like finish. Good hop presence. Crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Could be a perfect session beer."
"M&D--Sixpoint seems to have developed this beer specifically for sessioning. The bitterness of the hops keeps you wanting plenty more, and it's damn refreshing, if a little basic on the malt--but hey, only so much room in the parlor. The mouthfeel was pretty good although the flavor profile made it a little rocky toward the end of the tasting. Still, I wouldn't refuse another, or another after that another. This brewery makes me proud to live in Brooklyn, and seems to embody the spirit of what the place has become so well."
"Finishes crisp clean and dry."
"With that abv at 5, this beer screams drinkability. A great summertime session beer."
"Overall- This beer had some hype, I've been told to try it a lot lately, and it didn't dissapoint. Good taste and nice sweet profile that is held in check, also very smooth, worth a try."
"Recommended..."
"First Sixpoint Beer I've had. I've heard much of the brewery, but this the first offering from them. Pretty good beer, and I look forward to their other brews."
"Another great offering from Sixpoint, though perhaps not as transcendent as their Righteous Rye. Pours amber with a slight head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is strong and sweet, quite malty. It has a lovely sweet, malty flavor with a subtle hop bite on the end. The mouthfeel is huge and aggressive. This is a wickedly drinkable beer."
"D: I was not impressed with Six Points on this endeavour. Having said that, this is the most hops in andy Blonde I've downed in the past few years. Where was the wheat I ask?"
"It is an extremely crisp, refreshing beer. Good for the summer or those great beer drinking days in the fall. Can't wait to have it again!"
"Drinkability: Just a great drinking beer for a hot day (or a cold one for that matter); refreshingly crisp but with nice fruity complexity"
"The beer pours a hazy dark golden color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale and carapils malt scent along with a mildly hoppy aroma. The taste is great. It has a refreshingly smooth pale malt flavor with a very citrusy hop finish. It's light and quite bitter; very tastey indeed. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent drinking beer. It's light enough for summer drinking, but hoppy enough for the alpha heads to enjoy."
"Drinkability: could drink a million of these"
"D- So I thought this was a cream ale. I was very wrong. Not that I was that upset b/c it is an easy drinker and is quite tasty."
"Light to medium in body. Smooth, slightly creamy, crisp, and very refreshing. Tastes much bigger than it drinks. I could easily stick with this all night. Great flavor and complexity, low alcohol - a perfect session beer."
"D: Not too high an ABV and not too hoppy - I could drink this all night without a problem."
"Notes: This beer is classified as a blond ale but its hard for me to really put something like this in a box. This is a pretty unique tasting beer. Definately try it! It is a really good beer."
"On tap at Coles,poured from the tap into a standard pint glass a hazed light golden with a thinner but well retained white head.Mainly toasty in the nose with a bit of citrus and sweet-like vanilla wich was more pronounced on the palate.Flavors start out mildly sweet with some vanilla melding into a leafy hop finish.Not overly complex but it nicely blanced a good drinker."
"Tried this beer on a recent trip to New York city. I was pleasantly surprised at it's clairity and freshness, and depth of flavor. I was expecting something bland or watered down, but this was not the case at all. It was an orangey color with a small head, and the smell was of fresh grain and fruit. Taste was delicious, and a lot hoppier than I expected. I would definitely have this beer again.. too bad I have never seen it outside of New York."
"Off the tap 5-5-2007. Pours a whirlwind of bubbles. Nose is very sweet hops. Flavor is a slightly subdued hop experience. At least subdued from the hop bomb comparable aspect. It is mildly firm with pine attributes. Subtle citrus tones on the body as a whole. Feel is smooth and slightly thick on the liquid. Overall a good drinker. More subdued than some of Sixpoints hop head creations."
"On-tap at Cole's. A creamy IPA. Lots of C-hop aroma and vanilla maltiness. Creamy head on medium golden soapy head,lace fresh. Really good hoppy flavour, a juiciness like a good American Pale Ale. Then this extra level of maltiness that sweetens the finish. Bottom Line:The beer works."
"dba in NYC had this one on cask so I gave it a try. This is a great beer! Everything I look for in a session beer. Great mouthfeel, very drinkable, refreshing (even at cellar temp), and great flavor. I would describe this as a English bitter with modest hopping and a slightly sweet taste. Excellent!"
"It's just so easy."
"A really nice, easy drinking ale. The aroma reminded me of an orangesicle and the flavor reminded me of guava juice with a touch of herbal tea. It's almost a shame that this is a cream, simply because I think it limits the fine subtle flavors this beer would otherwise be capable of. That said, this cream ale rocks."
"D-Not knowing what style this was as I was drinking it I thought I was drinking a British pale ale with american hops. Whatever way you look at it it is a tasty beer and one I can have a few of."
"Served to me with almost no head, just a light white lace across the top. Color was amber, transparent. Smell was mostly piney hops, plus a touch of sweetness. Taste was crisp: dominated by piney, earth hops up front that gave the beer a dry, bitter taste. However, that was complimented by citrus flavors and caramel malts. A well-balanced taste. Good mouthfeel, light and well carbonated. I sipped on this beer over the course of an hour and enjoyed every bit."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange with a nice two finger fluffy white head that slowly dies down to a creamy layer. Smell is a nice buttery scent with a bit of wheat in the nose as well. Very bready notes are detected in the smell too. Taste is so smooth and creamy. Sweet caramel notes flow over the tongue. Tiny subtle hop bite towards the end, very balanced. Mouthfeel is a good full creamy body with minimal carbonation. Drinability is very good, could be a session beer for sure. A style that seems to be overlooked, but Sixpoint does a great job with this one."
"Overall a very tasty ale. As for being a cream ale - if this is not an APA, then I am Chinese."
"Taste is a slightly sweet creamy maltiness with nicely balanced hoppiness. A good session beer, quite respectable abd well made."
"I also must note that I really enjoy the fact that the ABV is low. Cream ales were always intended, in my mind, to be highly drinkable. A beer you drink when you commiserate with buddies. I wish I was drinking this six years ago instead of Genesee Cream Ale."
"Glad that someone finally created a separate listing for this beer, now that it is being advertised as 'Sweet Action Cream Ale' on many of the tap handles across NYC. I had this beer back in April of 2005 when it was still a +7% Belgian/German hybrid - something that I think the brewer described at a local bar as a 'German Heffewiezen and a Belgian strong ale getting together and having a bastard child"" - I liked that beer a lot, and I miss it now that it's gone. The beer that was Sweet Action then and the beers that have come and gone using the same name over the almost two years since I first tried it are almost all a far cry from the Cream Ale that is touted as Sweet Action today. The beer pours a light caramel color with a frothy head. Good head retention, nice lacing (both on my glass and my moustache) and strong sweetness in the aroma. The taste is balanced, but has very little hop character at all (I understand that this is a cream ale, but slightly more bitterness would be a nice touch). The sweetness that is present on the nose falls a little flat in the taste; in fact the taste itself is a bit flat, not so much with a lack of carbonation, but just in complexity. Overall this beer is drinkable, just not as flavorful as I would like in a Cream Ale, and just because it's not a Pale Ale doesn't mean hop bitterness or bite should be so subdued. I've shared my feelings on this beer and it's many, many incarnations with friends and we all agree that these last few months have shown a consistent product for the first time in a year. Assuming then that this is the final version of this beer (and maybe it's not) I find it to be an unsuitable replacement to the original beer that bore the name Sweet Action, and a pale comparison to other more notable Craft Brewed Cream Ales. Next time I'm given the choice of a Sixpoint beer, I'll stick with the Brownstone."
"The Cream Ale lived up to its name..creamy head, amber/red color, a little sweet, not too heavy. I can see this as a good companion to italian foods with tomatoes and sausage."
"Pours a creamy dark caramel body that is foggy leaving a thin lace that is sudsy. The aroma is citrus, hoppy, sweet hard candy, very nice. The taste is slightly watery, but makes up for it with a malty caramel mouthfeel, followed by a massaging of hops to bring the taste to life. This is very drinkable, but overall not much going on in terms of complexity but that is what is meant of this style IMO."
"Notes: Wow, I think I may have found my ideal session beer, and mere blocks from where I grew up. Makes me eager to try this brewery's other offerings."
"Overall: Very drinkable, the only thing holding this beer back is the lack of malt character upfront."
"Nothing struck me as particularly striking or offensive... well balanced all around... just nothing very special. I may need to try this again given the relatively high praise thus far but I was not wowed."
"Overall: A very drinkable ale for its ABV, and worth trying."
"D&N- Reminds me a little of De Ranke XX Bitter but better, easy to quaff and the alcohol is a tad hidden IMO ... which is not a bad thing. By far one of my favorite beers ... I'd love to see this more often."
"Drinkability is good enjoyable not true to style but who cares different and good is what matters."
"A hybrid style not easily definable. The dominant character is yeast. Appearance is fine, nice color, a little hard to check out in the dark bar, good head, nice retention. But again, this story is about yeast, supposedly from Westvleteren. Smells like yeast. Trying to pinpoint some specific yeast/bread product, but can not. Tastes like yeast, again, cant put my finger on it. A little dry and a little sweet at the same time. Good mouthfeel, pretty light. Drinkabitlity? Was ready to move on when the glass was empty. Did I mention the yeast? Want to know how important yeast is in a brew? Have this beer."
"Very interesting. Not sure this is exactly an American Blonde Ale. Thought it was more of an amber. I really liked the mouthfeel on this beer. It had some heft and was thick when rolling on the tongue. Nose was malts and juice. Flavor was some nice sticky malts. Very sweet with some apples and pears in there too. Hops were present but a second thought to the malts. Poured a light amber in color without any head."
"Quite an interesting beer. According the the menu at Half it is a cross between a pilsner, hefe, and pale ale and I think that is a dead on description. It started out being poured a nice golden yellow beer with a small white head. The smell was quite fruity and a bit juicey in character with just a faint whiff of hops. I was in no way prepared for the taste. It started off with the cleaness of a pilsner with just a slight hint of crisp hops lying underneath. Then therewas a twin assult of pale ale and hefe vying for my tastebud's attention. The hefe came at me with sweet honey like flavorswith just a slight bit of banana and much more sweet berry fruit flavors. The pale had a malty edge with some hops just adding a bit of bite at the end. Was very easy going down after getting over the initial shock of the flavor. Definitely worth the taste if just to see how different a seemingly simple beer can be."
"a light and clear peachy color with sporadic thin bubblings on the surface. smells oddly like a belgian white despite the classification here (and what are these classifications anyway? restrictions! bah!) aroma reeks of buttery wheat and mild strawberry, perhaps some lemony citrus.. pineapple and alcohol. even comes dangerously close to a belgian tripel. confused, i taste it anyway. wow.. yeasty and wheaty, lots of diacetyl and springy fruit notes. alcohol is no stranger to the mix and erupts with a pronounced presence. belgian influenced thru and thru with lots of flavor.. albeit somewhat muddled and unsure of itself. enjoyable beer and a great treat for summer. drinkability is limited by its potent flavor but one bottle (glass) is just as enjoyable as any of the previously sampled sixpoint offerings"
"I sampled a pint of this pale brew, from Brooklyn's newest brewery, after work at the Collins bar in the city. It pours a typical yellowish amber , slight haze and lifts a white puffy and loose head. This one leaves better then average, scattered and light lacing. Nice. Malty nose. Medium bodied, dry and crisp ale. I picked up a note of rye in this pleasant sessioner. More quality/quaffable brew from sixpoint."
"This was my first taste of the newest brewery in Brooklyn. Sweet Action is a hearty blonde ale with a golden maltiness that is full but not overwhelming, along with a sturdy body. The finish leans toward sweetness, but only for a moment, preceeded by shades of fruit and dabs of crispness. This murky gilded ale is as pleasant to look at in the glass as it is to drink."
