Holds its own with some of Ontario's other brewers in the style, but not anything I would rush out again. The main purpose behind trying the pack was to get a small taste of the rye Pale Ale and the Deviator Doppelbock anyway, but this will help quaff my thirst for the afternoon.","DenisKolkin","Dec 18, 2013"

3.13,-1.9,3.5,3,3,4,3,"Deep gold in colour, topped by a finger of somewhat lacy and retentive head. Toasted bread aroma, simple but pleasant. Malt-forward and doughy flavour with some light fruity esters giving it some apple character. A noticeable buttery flavour detracts from it's flavour. Minimal hopping is restrained to a very light bitterness in its short finish. I think this tastes pretty good for what it is. Light-bodied with an abundance of soft, finely textured carbonation. Not bad, but not something I care to return to.","mintjellie","Jan 06, 2012"

3.03,-5,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Ho hum , not much going on and I suppose that is the point . A slighter better version of the Sleeman's Cream Ale. A drinkable beer that is a true cream ale ( not the mild such is found in BC). Fairly boring beer in that it really never excites. The slight apple juice flavour is there on the finish. Not really worth buying","canucklehead","Beers"
2.88,-9.7,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Overall- Personally I didn’t really like this one, I mean it’s definitely not a drain pour and it reminds me of a higher rated American craft but it really tastes like an adjunct macro, not much aromas going on and the tastes really match the smell as well, just a lot of bready malts and not a whole lot else. Would not pick this one up again and probably wouldn’t have if not for the OCB discovery pack.","Roke87","0"

3.19,0,2.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a pale orange colour with almost no head/lacing. Smells of strong bready malt without any real hop aroma. Flavour is quite muted, some sweetness. Nothing is off about the flavour, but it is quite mild. Carbonation is a bit low, but it isn't flat. Pretty much on style for a cream ale, but a pretty uninteresting one.","kwjd","Aug 17, 2010"

3.37,5.6,3,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Final Thoughts: Cameron's seems to establish itself as a gateway to craft beer brewery. It's offerings seem to be geared towards macro drinkers who want something different. Both this offer and their Lager are superior to their macro counterparts, but not so off the beaten path as to scare away non-BAs. For the most part, it's good beer for the average person, although not your average BA.","TheHammer","Jun 28, 2010"

3.35,5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"As much as I like this brewery's cream ale - and I really really do - I don't know what sense it makes to produce both this and their lager, given the beers are so similar in style (not to mention they only release 4 offerings in total). They obviously do what they do well, but I'd like to see this brewer put his talents towards tackling a wider ranger of styles.","biegaman","Mar 20, 2010"
3.46,8.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Surprisingly decent. By no means is this something I'd go out and buy again (I only got it because I needed some of the bottles for a trade), but it has made me reassess my stance on cream ales a bit, and recognise that there's some potential there. Camerons Cream Ale went down very easily, and while its flavour is at the simpler end of the spectrum, it seems well-suited as a light summer quaff.","bobsy","Feb 04, 2010"
3.2,0.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"This is a pretty typical cream ale, not outstanding but true to the style, if you like cream ales, give it a try.","ThatWineGuy","Jan 30, 2010"
3.48,9.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Similar to the Blonde Ale and California Common, the Cream Ale falls somewhere in between a lager and an ale. The genre is not well regarded by craft drinkers, most likely because it lacks bold, in-your-face flavours. For the style, though, this beer is tasty and sessionable, and that's all it really needs to be.","cratez","Aug 16, 2008"
3.33,4.4,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"A moderately above-average cream ale, mostly unmemorable, and inoffensive.

2.98,-6.6,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Bland and boring, and really not much better than some of the better macro lagers out there. Pale yellow with a small, fizzy head. Very low hop presence in both the aroma and flavour. Flavour, in general, is mild bordering on weak, but with no detectable adjuncts or off flavours. Improves slightly at warmer temperatures.

3.7,16,3,3,4,4,4,"This poured a yellow-orange with a little lacing. Smell is unique, vegetable aromas in the nose. Taste is a bit sweet and slightly vegetable like.

3.1,-2.8,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Very clear gold with a thin white head that reduced quickly. Soft malt aroma with a bit of faint hops. Mild sweetness and the low bitterness comes out a bit more towards the end. There's also a bit of grassy hop flavour in the finish. Low carbonation, light body, off-dry finish. Easy to drink, nothing really wrong with the beer, yet nothing really interesting either.","DrJay","0"
2.88,-9.7,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,"I found this to be to close in flavours to the macros and cannot say I found it to be up to standard for a cream ale. I do prefer Sleeman's version of cream ale as it is much more characterful and quenching on a hot day.","Beersignal","May 12, 2005"

3,-6,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours golden yellow, little white head, not much retention. Mostly malt in the nose, with some floral hops. Taste was sweet, bready, and some fruity tones.

2.65,-16.9,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"I must have gotten a badly handled case from the LCBO. I should have guessed seeing how it was unchilled on the shelf.... looked a tad too hazey and the cap (although ample) didn't stay as long as the ones I had on tap. Aroma was citrus, musty, earthy with some malt sweetness. Sweet malt balanced well against a lemon-grass like hopping....but there was a very annoying ""soapy"" taste that played out as a sour yeasty taste in the finish...I think I got some spoiled beer....will rerate at a later date.","pootz","Feb 09, 2003"
3.15,-1.3,3,3,3.5,2.5,3,"Nothing outstanding about this beer, whose style has become popularized through Creemore flagship. OK pour and foam. Was a bit sweet, no outstanding flavour.OK on the tongue. Found it dried the mouth and felt was bits of yeast aftertaste. Fine for a summer day. A cut above national brands.","Sammy","Beers"
