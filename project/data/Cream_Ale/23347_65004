3.67,0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a slightly murky orange-brown with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, grain, and some slight caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but nothing all that exciting.","UCLABrewN84","0"

3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Lively carbonation on a medium body makes for crisp drinking. Smooth and subtly creamy mouthfeel overall despite the carbonation. Very well done take on a simple classic style. Session beer, Hess style.","tobelerone","Nov 10, 2011"

3.77,3.3,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Fortunately, this is nothing like any Mexican beer I've had. More rich and malty than you're likely to encounter with a burrito. At first sip, a plain malty stew that needs a crisp touch. Grows in dimension as you sip. Lovely amber color. With a bigger head and maybe a dose of shy hops this could be the ideal American Amber beer. Still, it's quite drinkable and clean.","mactrail","Jul 10, 2011"

3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Light brown with a creamy white head. Smells of grains and malts. Taste is similar to a stout without any intense roasted flavors, very creamy and refreshing. Silky smooth mouthfeel, to be expected on nitro. Overall pretty good sessionable beer with a lot of flavor, this was my first in this style so I wasn't sure what to expect but defiantly enjoyed it.","d4114","Apr 08, 2011"
3.98,9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall I have been happy with everything I have had at Hess. Grazias Vienna Cream Ale is no exception. Bring home a growler/prowler and pull it out of the fridge 5 mins before you pour. You will like it.","cocoapuph","Mar 17, 2011"
3.5,-4.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: I enjoyed it, it was good. Lager's, to me, are generally light, simple, refreshing, but with light flavor. In contrast to the simple part, this beer actually has a lot more going for it than is typical, but is still smooth, and refreshing, and creamy.","Retsinis","Beers"
3.37,-7.7,3,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,"O-Solid beer overall, although I wish the initial flavors were more distinct. Because they did not really stand out to me, I can't say it was anything more than an average beer. I enjoyed it though, would buy a growler to take home.","kbrady9","0"
