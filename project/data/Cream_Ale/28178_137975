There's not a lot of cinnamon here but at the same time I kind of imagine that if you mixed and ale with the milk leftover from a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch it might taste like this.  Not something I'd drink regularly but not bad at all.","PatrickG","Feb 11, 2015"

3.36,-10.6,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,"This pours a medium brown color with a slight head. The aroma is mildly sweet and malty but nothing like the description would lead you to believe. The taste is sweet and smooth thatâ€™s fairly malty. The ingredients kind of lead you to believe that this is going to be a RumChata style beer but comes off as more like a heavy Marzen brew. Nice, but not what I would have expected from the label.","Lemke10","Feb 01, 2015"

3.5,-6.9,3.5,4,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Pours deep wood brown  with a fluffy finger and a half fluffy head. Smell has a big lactose presence and super sweet dinner roll like malt aroma. Very faint cinnamon presence, nearly undetectable. Taste has a huge big sweetness upfront with notes of caramel, bread, and cinnamon. Huge alcohol burn in the finish that leaves a rubbing alcohol flavor on the palate. Moderately carbonated thick and sticky. Not sure why this is being called a cream ale as there is nothing even reminiscent of one in here.","Fcolle2","Sep 28, 2014"
3.75,-0.3,,,,,,"Interesting beer. Smells like milk approaching its expiration with some cinnamon cereal soaking in it. Tastes like cream, vanilla, and a touch of cinnamon. Finishes like a cream soda spiked with vodka or everclear.","durlta","Sep 28, 2014"
