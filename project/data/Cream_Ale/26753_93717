Aggressive, yet soft, carbonation uo front that quickly thinned to thin watery feel. Bready and caramel malt flavors up front followed by a tangy, herbal hop bite. Flavors turn bready and quickly fade to the end.  Finishes thin and watery with a bready and herbal hop aftertaste.","IronLover","Oct 10, 2014"

My enjoyment begins with an inverted Glug, which in turn created two fizzy fingers of bone-white head with limited retention following a brief pseudo-cascade. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 – 5). Nose was VERY evocative of its predecessors in that it had a metallic odor to accompany a sweet corn smell. Ha! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full. It tasted MUCH better than it smelled, with notes of biscuit malt, corn and unfermented sugars. I was immediately put in mind of corn bread! I was transported to Boas Creek, where we used to go fishing and take CANs of Genny Cream Ale to cool in the water. It was one of my favorite underage beers and this was very evocative of it. Finish was semi-sweet, easy drinking and a definite Summer cooler stuffer.","woodychandler","Aug 07, 2014"

The aroma is mild, with initial notes of cut grass, grain, and a light hint of vanilla. The taste is equally mild, with mostly light bread and slight earthy quality. It lives up to its name and has a nice creamy feel to the body with a mild bite on the finish. All in all, a good, lighter flavored beer that you can have more than a couple of.","delta490","Aug 04, 2014"

Really enjoyable warmer weather drinker, this one packs some nice flavors and doesn't weight you down while working on quenching a thirst with a few "cold ones". I'll be getting more of these. As it says on the can "Brewed in Richmond - Where Beer in a Can All Began".","ChefHopMeister","May 20, 2013"
3.85,8.1,3,3.5,4,4.25,4,"O - Cream ale is probably not a style I'd see myself visiting often, but Hardywood's example is quite satisfying. It's easy drinking for sure and packs a good bit of flavor for the ABV. However, the coolest thing might be the can design, which gives a nod to the cream ale from Krueger Brewing Company, the first canned beer ever to be sold - with the dominating green theme, simplistic appearance, and even can opening instructions... so cool!","TechTriumph","May 18, 2013"
