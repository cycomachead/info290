"Was not crazy about this beer, it's very malty. Not my thing."
""
""
""

"Pours a golden hue with little head. The smell was a bit basic but there were some notes of sweetness from the malt. The taste was good with a bright beginning and a semi-sweet finish. Not very complex, but makes for a nice simple drinking beer."

"Can from MrBarleywine, thanks for the opportunity! Slightly hazy light golden color, light amount of floaties, smallish bubbly white head slowly dissipates. Aroma is sweet sugary maltiness mostly with light sweet orange fruitiness and little to no hop. The flavor is sugary sweet maltiness with hints of fruit and little to no hop flavor or bitterness. The only thing cutting through the massive sweetness of this beer is the carbonic acid form the carbonation. This is a one and done beer."

"Something to drink when mowing the lawn."

"Am I the only one who gets a lot of honey notes from this? Was quite enjoyable quaffing this in my recliner after mowing the lawn. Wouldn't turn this down if offered to me again. Hell, I might try to seek out a 6'er or two if my local store can get it. A nice solid offering from Grey Sail, looking forward to checking out more from them!"

"O: After a few drinks, the mineral aftertaste was all I tasted. Not a fan."

"This is an interesting beer and it’s extremely quaffable. With its sweetness level and agreeable taste, a person could knock these back with abandon. That said, it isn’t necessarily an amazing beer and I would probably like it better if it was a little more balanced in taste. But there is still enough positive going on here to recommend it. Just be careful when you pour- my cans all overflowed the moment I popped the top and yours may do the same."

"Overall impression: A refreshing, light cream ale."
""
""
"The feel of this beer was pretty light and makes for a good session beer. There is a good drinkable feel that goes down easy."
""
""

"Tastes like a cross between an Amber and a macro-brew. It's a bit watery and seemingly thin in taste but there's a bit of cream in the swallow. The high carbonation makes it seem lighter than it really is. Short aftertaste. All in all, not a bad beer, but nor is it very exciting."
""

"O/D-I genuinely like Cream Ales. This one isn't anything spectacular but I would bring this to a get together, know my friends would enjoy it and so would I. Very sessionable and better than advertised on the site."
""
""
"Really not bad for a Cream Ale and fits the style pretty well. No off flavors or anything that turns me off. Just not a thing I would personally buy a lot of but I could see how some would enjoy this."
""
""
""
"Overall not bad but not great either, a little thin, malts are nice, hops are so-so, not very creamy, light carbonation somehow, refreshing but just a decent tasting beer."
""
"Overall decent but not noteworthy. I'd get a 'gansett cream ale before this - more bang and less buck for those anyway"
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is easy to drink and enjoyable. Nothing stands out as particularly excellent, but there is nothing glaringly wrong either. I think its neutral flavor and light body would make it a suitable beer to pair with any meal where you want the taste buds focused on dinner."

"Another beer courtesy of woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a touch of sweetness. Taste is crisp, malty, creamy, a touch of hops, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"I went with my soon-to-be-patented Crack & inverted Glug which produced two short-lived fingers of foamy, bone-white head. I will say that it did leave some beautiful lacing in its wake, however. Color was a golden-yellow with a very slight haze, but just enough to be noticeable. This had a pleasant malty sweetness to the nose, suggesting an all-malt cream ale, which is a nice change of pace. Mouthfeel was medium and there was a grassiness to the hops that worked well with the malt to create an eminently drinkable beer. Finish was semi-dry and very refreshing. Once more, thanks to it relatively low ABV, I CAN easily envision myself drinking this on a hot summer's day or better, with a fresh soft pretzel."

"Choosing a Cream Ale as a flagship beer for a new brewery seems a bit odd. But Grey Sail pulled it off. This is an all-around solid beer, more interesting than the ""average"" Cream Ale. If only these came in tallboys..."

"Enjoyed with dinner at Trio's restaurant in Narragansett, RI, this brew presents a pale gold color with a giant white pile of foam and plenty of lacing. The aroma brings a subtle floral lemon blend that is pleasant but a bit too polite perhaps. The flavor offers a biscuit wheat and somewhat watery cabbage sort of deal. Kind of musty skunky, a papery wheat. It’s light bodied but offers a nice, evenly carbonated feel that refreshes and finishes with a dry tongue. The flavor is somewhat unique, a bit perfumey, not really my thing but definitely not a bad brew. Worth trying."

"Cheers!"
"12oz. can served in an nonic. Pours a translucent straw gold with a one inch, bright white head. Nose expresses sweet cereal grains and perhaps a slight buttery quality. Taste consistent with nose - there's almost a buttermilk character that comes out towards the middle and gradually drops off leaving some residual grainy notes. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation that asserts itself just enough to tickle the tongue and palate. I don't have a lot of experience or depth with this style, but this is a very simple and drinkable brew without much complexity. An easy session beer for the summer that would go great with grilling."
"Overall this is a style often ignored by brewers, so its nice to see another one around. One of my favorite summer beer types and this one fits the bill just fine."

"O: Not a remarkable beer, but it is quaffable. The sub-5 abv is nice."

"12oz can. Pours a translucent straw color with an inch of frothy head. Good amount of lacing. Aroma is of sweet grains, grass and some bread. Taste is sweet breadiness, grains, and a bit floral at the end. Pretty crisp and easy to drink. Somewhat of a creamy mouthfeel. Seems like it'd be perfect for summer. Overall, its nothing special but worth having some of in the fridge."
"Thanks, Jonah, for sending this and allowing me to be the first non-Rhode Islander to review it!"
"O: This is a great session beer, comes in cans as well. The draft version had more hop character, but even so, this is solid cream ale. I’ll be drinking this on the beach in the summer and loving it."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice lighter beer to drink for a long time."
"O/D: The canned version is worth trying. Fairly hoppy for the style. Good beer to go along with bar food. Probably won't get any of your beer-nerd friends excited. Price is steep at almost $9 for a six pack of 12 oz, compared to all the other quality choices by other breweries. Looking forward to seeing what else these guys have to offer."
"overall, however, i'm pleased that this will be the flagship brew for a new Rhode Island brewery. if people start drinking this regularly, they may soon realize how nasty Narragansett is"
