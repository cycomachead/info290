"Overall, this is a decent cream ale, easy to drink but kind of boring. Probably my least favorite Crow Peak beer."

"Canyon Cream Ale pours a bright straw yellow color with almost no head. There is an aroma similar to garbage that has been sitting in the hot sun for a while. The taste however is crisp and has a mellow golden malty undertone. The taste is watery, but still some flavors can be picked out. Overall it tastes good, but its a bit weak and boring."
"Overall - pleasant surprise after a 12 hour drive from jackson wyoming. It was much needed and i wish I'd bought more."

"Canyon Cream Ale is a true summertime beer. This is not a big beer by any means. It is very light and crisp, with a hint of honey. The taste is magnificent, especially on those hot summer SoDak days. This is a Crow Peak regular; one of the few beers they can."
"Shared this gem with the rb crew recently. The beer is clear and pale yellow with a small white head. The aroma brings malt, yeast, corn. The flavor follows suit. Corn and malt. Light bodied with lingering adjunct flavors. Eh...not a fan of this one at all."

"Overall: Interesting. Tasty. Very drinkable."
"O: A decent beer, but nothing special."

"Overall: Pretty nice lawnmower beer. Iâ€™d probably prefer it to be a bit grainier and drier, but not bad nevertheless."

"Thanks to fLax for this one!"

"A buddy brought this back from his summer trip out to SD. The beer poured clear yellow with a thick head initially then it dissappeared and did not notice any lacing. The smell had some honey and mild citrus. Taste was ok, malt and a little citrus. Mouthfeel had a light body and mild carbonation. Worth a try...sure....would I get it again...no."
"Thanks for the Can Crow Peak. Any craft beer in a can I will try. I get tired of taking glass to recycle. Aluminum is curb side and I can store more in the beer fridge and take to the pool. This is a good beer for the wife who steers clean of any IPA."

"Disappointed. I've tried the 11th hour IPA and Pile-o-dirt porter as well. Those two on tap and in can. I'm about to head out to school in Rapids City so I plan to return. If I have a disappointing outing in person again I plan to address this with the bar tender. Hell I might even bring some beer with me to prove a point."
"O: really a nice representation for the style. I really only have some homebrewed versions and spotted cow for comparison. This is right up there with spotted cow. This was great on a 95 degree day."
"D: This is what craft beer's answer to light beers should be."
