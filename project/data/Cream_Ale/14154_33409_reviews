"Smells like cream soda, doesn't taste like one though. Also doesn't taste like a cider. Kind of bland and dry"
""
"Crisp and refreshing, it's a cream ale with apple juice. And, that's what it is."
""
""
"On tap, pours with a small head.  Great blend between cider and cream ale."
""

"Light body. Reminds me of Redds. Sweet caramel apple aroma. Pretty good tasting. Kind of tastes like Spotted Cow with apples. Slight banana flavors as well. Not up there with New Glarus Apple Ale, but would drink again."

"A tasty little ale that I had higher hopes for. With that said, I would drink this again if it was served at a party but I don't think I would purchase for myself."

"I had high hopes for this six-pack. Cream Ale sounded pleasant although I have scarcely had one before and being huge fan of a good cider I figured this would be a homerun. The flavor was just off-putting for my taste, the apple/cider was overly sweet and completely unbalanced with the ale which left a strange aftertaste. I ended up giving 4 of the 6 bottles to friends to try and they had similar feelings, however, we agreed this would be a great ingredient for beer-bread."
"Not bad at all. I like the apple upfront, and the malt back."

"O: I was looking for NG Apple Ale when I came across this one at a store in Madison. The sales person advised me this was the superior beer. I'm going to have to disagree. And while I'll readily admit I'm generally a critic of the Cream Ale style, I'll also say this beer isn't going to prove me wrong, either. Drinkable, but not that I'd want to."

"O) I can appreciate what the brewer is going for here, but as far as apple beers are concerned, I guess I prefer the all in approach, like New Glarus's Apple Ale. This one has some nice cream ale qualities, but the apple cider incorporated into the process just doesn't work for me. I found it pretty interesting, but not as enjoyable as I was hoping for. Even so, it was worth a try. Cheers..."

"It really does come across as more like a cider than a beer. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but be aware before you consume and you won't get something you weren't expecting!"
"O- A fun beer to drink to change things up. Sour apples taste great, and they go well with beer. Top to bottom, not the most impressive beer I've ever had, but still a pretty solid brew."
"Overall a Great Cream Ale. I can't help but think of Spotted Cow when I drink this. It is literally like an apple flavored Spotted Cow. Very good, Would definitely buy again."
""

"Moderate to low carbonation. Creamy. Overall a rather disappointing beer. A cool concept, but poorly executed. Pretty bad taste with a worse aftertaste. Maybe this would be better fresh?"
""
"This beer poured out as a dark golden color with a thin white head on top that doesn't really stick around very long. The smell of the beer had a pretty nice light apple cider like aroma to it. The taste of the beer was pretty good but it just doesn't have a whole lot of apple punch to it. The mouthfeel has a thin body, lightly carbonated and kind of watery. Overall I feel that this beer could be pretty awesome if Furthermore could just kick it up a notch in the flavors. I would drink it again though because I really like Apple Ales."
""
"Overall - The flavor will be off putting to some of those who are not familiar with dry ciders or with those who don't like their beers with fruity flavoring. Aside from that, this is a pretty good Cream Ale, it drinks like a Cream Ale should!"
"Beer is light in body and really unimpressive. Really unimpressive. Grainy at the finish, light and apple-y up front with a creaminess to the whole thing. This was an extra in a trade and this is also a style I don't really like, I've had much better cream ales though, this was a big disappointment."
"O: Would definitley drink this one again, very nice and easy to drink."
"Poured a ambery-orange color, actually kind of reminiscent of a lighter apple juice. Little to no head to speak of, but some little carbonation bubbles here and there. Didn't get too much from the aroma, possibly because I was mainly smelling the cleaning solution of the glass...unless that actually was the beer. But sticking my nose in a little further, I detected just a bit of apple sweetness, surely more juice-like than cider-like. Taste was moderately decent, with light apples, sugar, and pale malts. I didn't really get much of a ""cream ale"" feel from it, honestly. Pretty light in the mouth, and just a bit filmy. Decent overall and fairly drinkable, but a bit bland and watery for me."
"My aggressive pour netted me two-plus fingers of eggshell-white head with excellent retention. There was no need to lean in for a sniff – the nose was like having bitten into a Red Delicious. Color was a beautiful golden-amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with crisp apple tartness on the tongue. The label read “Cream Ale brewed with Apple Cider”, but the apple flavor was dominant. Finish was crisp and dry, but the effervescence lent it a quality that ordinary hard cider seems to lack. I am betting that the ABV is relatively low, making it perfect for a slow autumn afternoon."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, like a mellow apple cider. In the taste, mellow apple cider, but not as acidic as cider. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry cider like aftertaste. More a cider than a beer."
"Drinkability: Solid all around hybrid style that I hope to see more of, I like cider and a decent mass produced cream ale. Blend these two styles together and you have a nice mix of the two. Keep it going solid quality overall good experience."
"D: This and the New Glarus Apple Ale were/are pretty interesting. I liked it, but at some points I was thinking, I would rather just have a cider."
"Pours a golden apple juice color with a thick white head that sticks around and no real lacing. Smells like apples and some little cream beer. Tastes like apple cider with some mild cream ale mixed in. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Drinkability is decent."
"Non beer drinkers will like it"
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a clear golden color with a white collared head. It honestly looks like apple juice. Sweet apple cider aroma in the nose with little else, maybe some slight spice. Sweet apple flavor upfront wtih some tartness, some cherry flavors as well. This beer is pretty sweet but it's decent for a fruit beer. Having had New Glarus Unplugged Apple Ale today, I would say this is an ok substitute but not as good as teh NG. Medium/light mouthfeel."
"Clear golden color with a large white head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy sheets of lacing is left on the glass. Do not remember many cream ales looking as good as this one. Aroma is a combination of green apples and cereal malt. The apple juice added something to this beer. It is well represented in the flavor as well. Adds an interesting, tart, green apple flavor that compliments the otherwise bland and uninteresting malt. Hop bitterness is non-existant. The beer may be just a bit undercarbonated for the style. Otherwise the body is good. A little bit more body than what is typically a lighter beer. Not something I could drink a lot of especially considering the high ABV. But a cream ale that is a little bit more interesting than most."
"D: A drinkable beer as it is light and has a good flavor, but really how much apple beer can a person take. For me I am only going to have one."
"Pours a dark gold color with a slight head which gives way to little lacing. The aroma is of fall apple's and a hint of spices. Not a hop aroma or malt aroma around though, but the smell is pleasant. The taste is of apple cider with hints of nutmeg and fall spices, its a nice flavor, no beer flavor but a nice mellow drink. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall I think its a very drinkable beer, its a very easy drink and a nice change of pace. A great beer for sitting outside in slightly chilly weather. The taste is of apple cider, but I don't think that is a bad thing either."
"I would tell anyone not to purchase this. It really isn't that good. Maybe girls at a high school party would like it."
"couldnt see myself getting this again. apple flavors overwhelm."
"D - Well I have to take in the fact that it was a high price on the mix and match section (red dot) so a sixer will be around 13-14 dollars. Ouch! If I do see it for the price of Lancaster's beers (10-11 dollars) I would pick up a sixer. Overall a refreshing and (damn 6.2%? really) smooth for the ABV. Liked it."
"D - This beer falls short on all accounts. It needs more of everything. Just one-dimensional and boring for a beer that has the potential to be so much more."
"D: Drinkable enough but the preponderance of apple doesn't make me want to have another one."
"There isn't a lot of ""beer"" to be had in Fallen Apple, but it's really not bad. It is different enough to warrant a look, especially if you like apple-flavored drinks."
"Purchased from Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN. Pours a clear, light coppery orange body with a thin white head that falls to a cap. Aroma is of clean malt and faint apple. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Smooth malt flavors lead to just a hint of apple in the finish with no detectable bitterness. Very refreshing. I had expected this to be overly apple flavored and syrupy, but it had great drinkability and gives a new take on a light cream ale. Well done, Furthermore!"
"A decent, drinkable ale. As sessionable as any 6.2% ale could be. Im a fan of apples and it works here. Just needs some slight cleaning up, if it didnt have the musty aroma and lesser hints of it in the taste I would be scoring it higher. Worth a try, and I am looking forward to trying it again next year."
"D-Hmmm--I thought/was hoping this would be a lot better than what is. Doesn't really do much for me this is more of a boring cream ale with apple not an apple beer. I think I will use the rest of my bottles to cook pork loins in!"
"Overall not my thing but my girlfriend loves this stuff. I would say its drinkable only since it's not real strong on character."
"A drinkable beer. The apple doesn't seem to really fit in the best though. It's a nice attempt, but I wouldn't have this again."
"D - Not something I will pick up again and frankly, I am glad I just grabbed a single bottle of this. This beer is probably more popular with casual beer drinkers than most people on this site because of the apples and cream finish. Regardless, some improvements are needed before I would grab this beer over the other Furthermore offerings."
"Light bodied and moderate carbonation, I was hoping Furthermore would crank out a good apple ale, but truthfully it felt a bit muddled and while the apple flavors are there, they are unrefined and harsh. On that note, I find most apple ales to be pretty sub-standard so that is no surprise to me. You want a fruit beer you go to New Glarus Brewing Co. (and their Apple Ale was sublime)."
"Furthermore brews some pretty solid craft beer that has impressed me more often than not. Fatty Boombalatty is da bomb! Fallen Apple is one of their worst efforts and needs a pretty thorough overhaul before I'd consider buying it again. New Glarus Unplugged Apple Ale was apple beer done right."
"Good to try, but no reason to get this again."
"This beer pours a clear pale orange-amber color. The head is a fizzy inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of pale malt, and ripe apples. The taste is like a green jolly rancher....not something I ever wanted to taste in a beer. It get stronger in the finish, and I find myself fighting it. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, I cannot get past this beer's taste. I will not be drinking this again."
"Now, maybe that was an expected taste. Or, like I said it was a bad batch. I understand that some people like the bitter/vinegar taste but (and this is coming from a cider beer fan) it was not for me."
"Tastes like... I don't know, really. Is this supposed to be a beer or a cider? Checked the poster up across the bar and it said it was a cream ale with apple added to it, so I guess there's that. But if you had told me it was a cider I would have believed you. Unlike other apple fruit beers (like Ephemere), where the apple tartness is balanced against the spiciness of a malt or yeast profile, here all we got to balance some surprisingly tart green apples is a tame cream ale malt profile. The result is a beer that's not bad tasting, really, but it's a little too bland and a little too tart."
"Worth checking out. Albeit nowhere near as good as New Glarus Apple, as that is an apple beer. This is a beer with apple."
"D- I decided that if you come at this from the beer angle, you'll probably be disappointed but if you're looking for a hard cider, this is great. It has a very fresh cider feel with just enough creaminess from the beer to give it a great balance."
"D: You could drink alot of these, there's nothing offensive but nothing great either. Worth trying!"
"Fallen Apple pours a clear copper in color with a tight, light khaki colored head that remained throughout consumption. The aroma consists of sweet green apples; the malt reminded me of an apple kringle crust and a hint of caramel. The mouthfeel is medium and very effervescent. This is a very dry apple ale. Savory and almost lending itself as a sipper to enjoy and contemplate the flavors of the beer. It's light and crisp, almost brut-like. Apple sweetness is combined with a light maltiness, to find and enjoyable Autumn ale."
"Just not a good beer in my opinion. Nothing seemed to come together for this beer. I am disappointed."
"But if you can't get enough apple juice, here is your ""beer"" of choice."
"I really like that Furthermore is doing something different with their beers... a tip of the hat to that."
"Not a nail biter, but interesting."
"Special thanks to asmokingoat for this one as part of the Local Beer and Glass BIF."
"drinkablility is good. this is little more than apple jiuce with a bit of malt. this works well, but does not lend well to a beer."
"D - Too much corn, too little apple for my tastes."
"If you are going to go fruity go over the top like Belgian Red. This was drinkable, but nothing I would go for again. It was hard to realy get into this one. If you have friends that want beer, but normally drink wine coolers or the hard lemonades, steer them towards this."
"Taste has a bit of apple tartness, a flash of green jolly rancher sweetness, before the corn and pale malt take over the middle and aftertaste. Feel is slightly creamy, but it looks filtered without much yeast to give it added body. Finishes slightly dry, with a long corny/malty aftertaste. One bottle was manageable, but this won't be a repeat for me. $1.99 from Riley's, Madison."
"D- This beer has some bright fresh apple flavor with some nice cream ale qualities. Flavors are smooth and refreshing."
"Overall: sweet and simple. I didn't have a bad experience drinking this, but its not something I would recomend a friend to spend money on. The malt body was a bit too thin for me, but did like the spicey notes that came with the apple flavor."
"I'd weakly recommend it."
"Glad I was able to pick up a single of this. Only $1.49 down the drain."
"I wasn't really paying attention with this beer. It's just everywhere I turn, a late fall release, and when my wife made a comment about it, I decided to get a single. I THOUGHT I was going to get a localized Woodchuck version of Cider Ale. Turns out this is just a beer with apple tendancies. Cream Ale is a decent style category. I was initially disappointed when trying this because I was geared up for some apple cider. After readjusting my expectations, I was still disappointed because the apple flavor isn't very forthcoming."
"Very drinkable but not very exciting"
"drinkability: fine"
"Drinkability/Overall: another solid if not underwhelming beer from Furthermore. The apple is present but restrained as was the pepper in their Knot Stock. I like what they're trying to do, I just feel all of their beers are too...safe. It's hard to find shelf space around here if you're not going to do something to garner interest. Best of luck to them, however."
