3.28,-3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,3,"An old school style cream ale.  Reminded me of what my Grandad used to drink in the summer while watching the Phillies.  It poured a nice golden straw color with a white creamy head.  The smell was a classic clean hopped odor.  The taste was very good.  It has light refreshing malty and smooth taste.  I could drink these all summer.","JPowell712","Mar 16, 2015"

3.78,11.2,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Light gold color with a small white head. Great clarity. Light sweetness in the aroma, most likely from the additions of corn and sugar, with floral hops coming through at the end. Flavor is well balanced with a crisp, smooth finish. Light in body and a breeze to drink. A very clean ale with no off flavors. A pleasant easy sipper!","Jacobob10","Feb 21, 2015"

A little bitter but subtle hops. Decent malt. I wish it had more carbonation. I liked it but won't buy again for a bit even though it is a good beer.","Urk1127","Nov 13, 2014"

Smell is kind of mild, some grains and malts are present. Taste is grains, bready malts, a bit of lemon, a good thirst quencher. Feels medium bodied in the beer and probably would be better enjoyed on a hot, summer day.","tone77","Nov 05, 2014"

Bread , cereal and cornmeal aromas with light floral and metallic notes at the end. Smooth, delicate, creamy feel with a light crispness near the end. Bready malt and corn flavors up front followed by light tangy herbal hops through the middle. Herbal bitterness overtakes the sweet bready malt at the end as this finished with a semi-dry crispness and lingering yeasty and herbal hop bitterness.","IronLover","Oct 11, 2014"

3.86,13.5,3.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Enjoyed a pint on tap at PJ's in Medford. Slightly hazy light amber appearance topped with a thin head that quickly dissipated. Smells like a wheat soda cracker with a touch of toffee. Taste is mildly sweet with a bit of caramel on the finish. Even with such a low abv, it still has a great mouthfeel with enough chewiness to give it some character. Very nice job by Neshaminy.","wise456","Sep 11, 2013"

3.63,6.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,"The breweries take on a lawnmower beer. Poured slightly hazy yellow. Fluffy white two finger heading which left tremendous lacing. Very crisp cracker like malt, with a nice bitter hop balance in both nose and taste. Slight linger of hop in the finish. Very smooth, balanced and a trace of lactic like feeling in the mouth. I hate to make it sound like favoritism but this brewery is no joke very good stuff coming out of here.","TheFightfan1","0"
