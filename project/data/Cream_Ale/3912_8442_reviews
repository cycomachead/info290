"I could see a few tickers liking the mixed 4 pack from Cameron's but I doubt I'd buy a second, I would buy a fresh bomber of their RyePA again but that's about it."

"O: Ok. Smooth, light, lager like, not wowing me. Got it in a Cameron’s mixed pack."

"According to the company's web site, CCA was a gold medal winner at the Canadian Brewing Awards."

"I am hoping to try the beer again as I may of had an off batch. Cameron's has award winning beers."

"Overall - A bit better than I had remembered it, but definitely nothing outstanding. Holds its own with some of Ontario's other brewers in the style, but not anything I would rush out again. The main purpose behind trying the pack was to get a small taste of the rye Pale Ale and the Deviator Doppelbock anyway, but this will help quaff my thirst for the afternoon."

"Deep gold in colour, topped by a finger of somewhat lacy and retentive head. Toasted bread aroma, simple but pleasant. Malt-forward and doughy flavour with some light fruity esters giving it some apple character. A noticeable buttery flavour detracts from it's flavour. Minimal hopping is restrained to a very light bitterness in its short finish. I think this tastes pretty good for what it is. Light-bodied with an abundance of soft, finely textured carbonation. Not bad, but not something I care to return to."

"Final Grade: 3.35, a B-."
"M: There is a short little bitter ending, the start is nice but also minimal not as intense as expected."
"O/D - Not for me. Something just gives off too much of a honey note and takes over any other element that could power through. It could be better."
"Ho hum , not much going on and I suppose that is the point . A slighter better version of the Sleeman's Cream Ale. A drinkable beer that is a true cream ale ( not the mild such is found in BC). Fairly boring beer in that it really never excites. The slight apple juice flavour is there on the finish. Not really worth buying"
"Overall- Personally I didn’t really like this one, I mean it’s definitely not a drain pour and it reminds me of a higher rated American craft but it really tastes like an adjunct macro, not much aromas going on and the tastes really match the smell as well, just a lot of bready malts and not a whole lot else. Would not pick this one up again and probably wouldn’t have if not for the OCB discovery pack."
"Another very drinkable beer from Cameron's, though maybe a bit too syrupy. This one plays it safe and would go over well in many casual settings."
"Cameron's seems to excel at making beers that are equal parts really boring and very drinkable. I had the lager right before this and I found the experience to be eerily similar."
"Overall – I had no issues with this beer. Seems like a fairly good example of the style and although I wouldn’t buy it again I’m happy that I gave it a try. It was better than the Muskoka Cream Ale for sure."
"I'll still review them just in case I find one I like, but I'm not a fan of cream ales, and this one is a perfect example of why this is so. Bland, sweet, and with a strange adjunct flavor that really throws the whole off. Won't get again."
"d-well there is nothing controversial here...why couldn't you have a ton of these?"
"it does have a creamy mouthfeel but that tomato-ish aroma is present in the taste. finishes creamy and a bit bitter. but overall not a winner."
"Pours a pale orange colour with almost no head/lacing. Smells of strong bready malt without any real hop aroma. Flavour is quite muted, some sweetness. Nothing is off about the flavour, but it is quite mild. Carbonation is a bit low, but it isn't flat. Pretty much on style for a cream ale, but a pretty uninteresting one."
"Not a fan."
"Final Thoughts: Cameron's seems to establish itself as a gateway to craft beer brewery. It's offerings seem to be geared towards macro drinkers who want something different. Both this offer and their Lager are superior to their macro counterparts, but not so off the beaten path as to scare away non-BAs. For the most part, it's good beer for the average person, although not your average BA."
"D - An enjoyable beer but not a memorable one."
"As much as I like this brewery's cream ale - and I really really do - I don't know what sense it makes to produce both this and their lager, given the beers are so similar in style (not to mention they only release 4 offerings in total). They obviously do what they do well, but I'd like to see this brewer put his talents towards tackling a wider ranger of styles."
"Surprisingly decent. By no means is this something I'd go out and buy again (I only got it because I needed some of the bottles for a trade), but it has made me reassess my stance on cream ales a bit, and recognise that there's some potential there. Camerons Cream Ale went down very easily, and while its flavour is at the simpler end of the spectrum, it seems well-suited as a light summer quaff."
"This is a pretty typical cream ale, not outstanding but true to the style, if you like cream ales, give it a try."
"Similar to the Blonde Ale and California Common, the Cream Ale falls somewhere in between a lager and an ale. The genre is not well regarded by craft drinkers, most likely because it lacks bold, in-your-face flavours. For the style, though, this beer is tasty and sessionable, and that's all it really needs to be."
"A moderately above-average cream ale, mostly unmemorable, and inoffensive. Nothing I would go out of my way to procure, but adequate if there are no better options, read: swanky, expense-account hotel bar. And what the hell does being 'dimensional' mean? Existent? Here right now? Pfft."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"Overall a decent example of the style. Nothing too special but a nice patio beer."
"A very insipid beer, along the lines of a BMC product in the flavor department."
"Final Statement: Better than the Dark Ale."
"Bland and boring, and really not much better than some of the better macro lagers out there. Pale yellow with a small, fizzy head. Very low hop presence in both the aroma and flavour. Flavour, in general, is mild bordering on weak, but with no detectable adjuncts or off flavours. Improves slightly at warmer temperatures. Over-carbonated."
"Notes: Special thanks to biegaman for the sample."
"drinkability is ok. the smell is throwing me off, but the taste is ok. overall not too bad, but not too great either."
"3.5's across the board for a fairly impressive brew. If you're a fan of the Cream Ale and you haven't tried Cameron's, you should go out now and do so. If you're not a fan of the style, this is still worth a try, as its a great beer in its own right, regardless of style."
"This poured a yellow-orange with a little lacing. Smell is unique, vegetable aromas in the nose. Taste is a bit sweet and slightly vegetable like. Not overly carbonated, pretty smooth. Better than some other cream ales i've had in the past. This beer is ok, i'd have another if offered."
"Very clear gold with a thin white head that reduced quickly. Soft malt aroma with a bit of faint hops. Mild sweetness and the low bitterness comes out a bit more towards the end. There's also a bit of grassy hop flavour in the finish. Low carbonation, light body, off-dry finish. Easy to drink, nothing really wrong with the beer, yet nothing really interesting either."
"I found this to be to close in flavours to the macros and cannot say I found it to be up to standard for a cream ale. I do prefer Sleeman's version of cream ale as it is much more characterful and quenching on a hot day."
"Golden yellow with a short white head and abundant spotty lace. Evenhanded hops/malt aroma. Flowery hops, slightly fruity, nice carbonation."
"Pours golden yellow, little white head, not much retention. Mostly malt in the nose, with some floral hops. Taste was sweet, bready, and some fruity tones. Finishes dry, slight bitterness. A tad watery IMO. A bit too sweet for my liking. Some other off flavours present too."
"I must have gotten a badly handled case from the LCBO. I should have guessed seeing how it was unchilled on the shelf.... looked a tad too hazey and the cap (although ample) didn't stay as long as the ones I had on tap. Aroma was citrus, musty, earthy with some malt sweetness. Sweet malt balanced well against a lemon-grass like hopping....but there was a very annoying ""soapy"" taste that played out as a sour yeasty taste in the finish...I think I got some spoiled beer....will rerate at a later date."
"Nothing outstanding about this beer, whose style has become popularized through Creemore flagship. OK pour and foam. Was a bit sweet, no outstanding flavour.OK on the tongue. Found it dried the mouth and felt was bits of yeast aftertaste. Fine for a summer day. A cut above national brands."
"Taste is very nice, almost a bitter/sweet with a very slight lingering moment...I would definetely recomend this cream ale."
