"I don't really know what to say aside from that it's a nice rather plain beer. Various flavors that individually aren't special but as a group make it interesting over more standard/plain beers. No noticeable Maple taste to me, aside from a general wood taste."
"I was expecting something bolder and better.  I am done with GIB beer and how they play it safe.    However I do enjoy the Lions Gate winter ale and the odd brew master  (in house craft beer) specials.   Hey GIB time to step it up."

"This beer holds a soft spot in my heart. It has recently been rebranded as ""Maple Shack"" Cream Ale, but I prefer the reference to Kits Beach. I first enjoyed this beer on tap, at the Granville Tasting Room many years ago. It is a tasty brew - nuts, caramel and maple flavours pop up. There is little hop complexity or depth overall. It's definitely sessionable and one of the few beers my wife will drink."

"The maple character is the unique feature in this session ale, unfortunate the beer itself doesn't do the best job of acting as a showcase for it. Flavourful base, hops are mostly earthy uk varieties. Not a terrible beer, just not a great style, watery, and some cheap hallmarks in the feel. Not particularly interesting or balanced."

"Pours a red amber with a few fingers of light caramel colored foam. Aroma is sweetish, with bready pale malts and light toffee/brown sugar coming to the fore along with a touch of sour fruit. Not a lot of maple. Palate is mild, mellow, and smooth, less aggressive than the aroma. There is a pronounced apple flavor along with a whiff of citrus and some herbal notes from the hops I assume, an unassuming caramel sweetness, biscuit, and hints of cardboard and booze. There are flaws but overall drinkable if overrated in my immediate circle (you know who you are)."

"On tap at the brewery. Pours amber hue with off-white head. Aroma is of caramel, apples and hint of maple syrup. Body is medium, creamy and smooth. Taste is of caramel, maple syrup and hint of herbal hops. Finish is long and semi-dry. Interesting brew."

"Final Thoughts: All in all, it works well although I wouldn't say this is an epic implementation of maple syrup and beer. Maybe if somehow the malt was upped and the metal took off, it would be a better grade. Still think it's pretty good though and worth a shot."

"I'm discovering Granville Island Brewing makes decent session beers. This cream ale pours an amber colour with half a pinkie's worth of head. Smells of malt and hops, with a faint hint of maple and vanilla. Tastes a bit weaker than it smells. I was hoping for more maple flavour. Overall, a decent session ale that I could see pairing or cooking with bbq ribs."

"Overall though, for a cream ale I've had much better, and again.. if you put a flavor on the bottle and I can't even smell or taste it then I am just not impressed. It is drinkable though I'll give it that."
"Nice looking amber beer with a decent head that lasted a couple minutes. Inviting smell with a good smooth taste and a nice malty finish. I found the maple flavor to be very faint yet natural tasting. Would definitely buy again as its an very enjoyable easy drinking beer."

"Kitsilano Maple Cream Ale pours an amber color, with a nice tan head. There was a nice sweet creamy maple aroma. The taste was very creamy, full, had good notes of maple that mixed well, not overpowering. Good full taste, and easy to drink too. Overall a very good beer."

"It feels good in the mouth, good on the tongue...the smell of maple is present, and then the taste of vanilla and caramel are present for a very pleasant aftertaste. This is the first maple syrup flavoured beer I've had that actually had a maple TASTE that I could define in it, and I intend to find it again in the future!"
""
"Overall- A very nice offering from GIB. I would prefer a little more maple flavour in the beer but pleased that the maple wasn't over kill. I would buy this again."
""
"Overall. Not bad if it's cold and you're thirsty. Not offensive in any way, just a little watery for me."

"Good and very sweet cream ale, something you should try at least once on tap. Full flavored, but creamy and smooth. Only downfal is the sweetness could prevent you from drinking all night, but a good beer to sample."
"D- Yeah, I think I will pick up a sixer from time to time of this beer. It's good enough to warrant 2 or 3 before moving on, as I could see my palate tiring of the maple flavor but it is refreshing nonetheless as it finishes dry and without a real lingering aftertaste. Good job!"
"lost of hype behind Granville being back in Alberta, decent beers and something different"
"D - the maple is there but I could have used a little more, the flavour is malt weighted, feel generally matches the style although it sits a little heavy despite the good carbonation, but all in all a good attempt at mixing two Canadian stereotypes"
"D - This is a tasty maple ale, with flavours that are present but not overpowering. The subtle flavours make it easily sessionable, but also leave you faint reminders of the maple presence. Another go-to ale that would be appreciated by most cream ale fans."
"Very good brew. Happy I tried it & it rec'd high marks from others around the table too. I wouldn't hesitate to order this one again."
"I don't know what happened to the overtly sweet, but generally balanced maple-flavoured beer that I used to enjoy back in the mid-oughts (try saying that without sounding like Grandpa Simpson). It's strange to say, but this recently revived beer needs to actually be sweeter, and the eponymous flavour needs to at least put in more than a mere cameo. However, I'm hardly surprised at the current overall direction of this brewery's offerings."
"Creamy, smooth mouthfeel with some carbonation."
"D - Not great. Reminds me of an ur-marzen, my least favorite beer. Couldn't finish this one."
"I poured it, but before I could take note, the head had disappeared. Okay, let's call it ""no head"". The color was a slightly hazy medium amber. The nose was very sweet with a definite maple sugar presence. Mouthfeel was medium, at best, with very little carbonation in evidence. The taste on the tongue was sweet, but not cloyingly so, as one might expect from a ""maple"" beer. Finish was sweet, but tempered by a slight sourness on the extreme finish. Not my bag."
"The drinkability.... ah, well this is a toughie for me because I'm sure that this is the perfect beer for my girlfriends who aren't so crazy about things that resemble hops, barley, malt... or hmmm.. beer. For myself, I really enjoyed a pint for its individuality, but I could never finish a pitcher of this."
"Not a bad beer but 1 maybe 2 is enough....no more...definately worth a try."
"This beer had more of a hop profile  though not assertive by any means  than I was anticipating, and started nicely bitter. The malt kicked in and turned things sweet after that. The maple taste was a little more evident, but not overdone. The mouthfeel was a little watery, and not as creamy as it could have been. Nevertheless, one could easily knock a few of these back if it's to your liking."
"Taste isn't really unpleasant. A nutty malt character, a slight acidity, and a little bit of woody earthiness. Apples, caramel, pears are all evident. A pleasant roasted character comes through more in the aftertaste, along with the maple. There's really very little in the way of bitterness here, but it's not overly sweet either, to its credit. This could have gone a bad way, as I think many brewers would go out of their way to make this as ""maple-y"" as possible, instead, Granville Island takes the subtle route, to good results. Mouthfeel is very British, maybe a bit watery, but certainly not overcarbonated and very creamy. I remember having a lot of Pints of this when I lived in Vancouver, back before I was a BA and enjoying it. Coming back to it wasn't really a terrible disappointment. A very drinkable cream ale and does well in the style."
"Nicely done...I am warming up to the artful use of honey in well crafted beers...it works."
"drinkability: quaffable"
"This one gives the impression that it is meant to be a straightforward and easy to drink beer, and in the end it succeeds at it. Worth a try but not likely to rock anyone's world."
"Final Statement: This is a beautiful beer. This beer was a treat and I highly recommend it. Do not let the Maple label convince you it's a novelty beer, it has lasting power. I can easily drink these regularly."
"I had this bottle in the fridge for the last five months and lo and behold it improved the flavour. The beer dried out some so the sweetness was all but gone. What impressed me was the malt structure was pretty solid. IMHO this is the best of the regular GI offerings. Easy drinking, flavourful, food freiendly and well structured."
"This is a pretty looking beer, pours a small light tan head, nice lacing. As for smell, mostly malt with the maple creeping in there, nothing to write home about though. Taste is quite smooth...creamy, yes. Malts, maple is very evident, not much hops though. A little sweet, but in a good way. Carbonation is near perfect for this beer, it feels quite nice in your mouth. It's actually pretty good, something different from the average pub fare around Vancouver, and it's cheap around here. Nothing too challenging or rewarding here though. A nice winter beer, goes well with a nice steak. I'll drink it again."
"Taste is not overly sweet. A bit of hops balances out the malts, and the maple syrup is evident but not overpowering. However, it is a little cloying on the tongue and is a bit thick like maple syrup. Not bad: one I'd buy again, but only when the mood strikes me."
"D-very smooth maple hinted beer that is very thirst quenching. Tetnanger hops (stated on the bottle) gave it more depth than a typical cream ale."
"Not very exciting, but tasty enough. It recalls something like JW Dundee's Honey Brown, or some gateway beer of that nature. Not challenging on the palate, but easy enough to drink. A decent first beer from the province of British Columbia."
"Sampled on-tap at the GI Brewery, it's brownish-red with a smallish head. The maple makes its presence known in the smell but is not overwhelming. Hops are barely detectable in the smell. Unfortunately, the maple becomes a bit too sweet in the taste, especially as the beer warms a bit. It seems a bit thin for a cream ale. The sweetness detracts from the drinkability. It's worthy of a try but don't expect anything spectacular."
"The appearance of this ale is superb. Following the pour there is a small though healthy-looking head, which recedes to a creamy, thin layer, which, in my opinion, looks very good on a glass of British-style ale. Coppery reddish and chestnut colours add to the appearance, and, although this ale is clear, it is dense--it does not look insubstantial or weak. The aroma is malt with a definite sweetness that is the ""pure Canadian maple syrup," as the bottle's label states. Slight, slight hop presence exists in the smell. I have noticed that to truly enjoy the aroma, one must let the beer warm up a little after taking it from the fridge: when it was really cold hardly any odour was detectable(which is true of almost any good-quality beer, I suppose). The taste is grainy malt in the middle, with an aftertaste of slight sweetness, but definitely not as much sweetness as you might expect by reading the word ""maple"" on the bottle. It is smooth, and, oddly, I notice definite raspberry flavours in the finish; and yes, maple is also there in the taste. Very little hop in the flavour, as well, perhaps just enough to balance it. I admit the mouthfeel could use some more weight, as it feels mildly watery. Other than that, another above-average brew from Granville Island. Time for another pint."
"Aw hell, let's get down to business. This is a very attractive looking ale for the most part. The body is a beautiful rich and clear copper colour, and the big beige head upon initial pour is impressive, but dissolves quickly into a thin ring. There are roasted malt and woody tones in the nose, as well as caramel and another foriegn sweetness, which I take to be the maple presence, although it seems to be under cover. However the taste is a bit burnt up front, and finishes with a metallic taste. Not quite what I expect for a cream ale. It's actually rather watery and nondescript. Disappointing. Yet while it is not apparent in the initial sip, a faint hint of sweet maple can be discerned on the aftertaste, so all is not lost. Still, I was hoping for a bit more maple flavouring from this sample. The mouthfeel is watery for a cream ale as well, the body is not very rich and full. It is an average offering for what it could have been, but it sounded good at the time."
"Sweet aroma with a not so pleasant metallic twang. Clear copper in color with a thin ring of white head. Metal contiuned into the mouth and pretty much ruined the beer for me. There was a nice sweetness hiding out in there, but unfortunately it was getting overpowered quickly."
"Even for a cream ale, it's a bit light on the flavours and stuff. It's a fine thirst quencher, and I think I've been a bit too hard on it. I guess I was expecting a bold and hearty ale, along the lines of GI's ESB (my current favourite beer of all time...) Still, for what it is, it's a nice quaffable, somewhat forgettable beer."
