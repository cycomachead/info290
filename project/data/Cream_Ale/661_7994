It looks great - I'm not sure what a cream ale should look like, but this one is appealing in a tulip glass. The flavour is, well, creamy. It reminds me of Kilkenny - easy on the palate, with a bit of grainy malt and the faintest hop notes. This is a quaffable brew that would match up nicely with a Steak and Kidney pie!","Bunman3","Nov 29, 2014"

3.74,7.8,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from the bottle into an American pub glass. A dark gold brew, just grading into light bronze territory, with around two fingers of resilient beige head. Aroma was unexpected and compelling, mainly tangy English hops (!?) propped up by doughy sweet malts, accompanied by some fruity yeast esters that recall pears and light citrus rind. Taste is correspondingly fruity and reasonably sweet, with a blood-like metallic tang. This brewery yields some nice caramel malt flavors and these shine through here, along with nutty baker's yeast, unripe peach, grape candy, pear, citrus rind, and toffee brittle. The sweet malt flavors develop nicely as the beer warms up. Light bodied and creamy as the style designator would suggest, with a semi-wet finish that features more earthy/spicy hops and hints of toast. Robust flavors for a cream ale and starts to blur the boundary between this style and an amber ale. I like my session options less sweet than this but recommended nonetheless.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 31, 2014"

This ale probably was filtered and reseeded with lager yeasts to undergo the long, cold lager-ing process, hence the higher attenuation level vis-à-vis the malty and slightly estery flavours. Not my cup of tea, but all in all this ale has shown some decent quality and flavour integrity.","wl0307","Jul 11, 2013"

Quite similar to the other OCB offerings, fairly well-brewed but lacking in character. Nothing wrong with it, just pretty uninteresting.

The beer tastes of the malt with no major hop character, with a little sweetness and a slightly off-putting aftertaste that only seems to linger if you let it by not sipping constantly.

2.71,-21.9,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a clear dark amber, some orange highlights, pretty thick and lightly fizzy off white head forms, quickly settles itself down to a thin layer, some lace spots stick to the glass. Smell is very malty, some caramel/honey sweetness, grains, bread, bit of biscuit, light citrus, a light garbage/vomity aroma, some fruity sweetness, otherwise pretty bland. Taste is similar, malty and grainy at first, quite sweet, biscuit, honey, some grassiness, light fruit, again pretty bland, dry toasty finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, moderately drinkable but nothing anyone should get excited about.","Viggo","May 12, 2008"

3.71,6.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I tried this beer on April 30, 2008 after purchasing an assorted 6 pack of Ontario Craft Brews from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured out a beautiful translucent rusty red colour with a generous off-white rocky head. The aroma is heavily grainy malt with some hoppy tones. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, slightly creamy, with a sour feel on the sides of the tongue. The flavour is roasted malt, some grassy malt, and little hoppy bitterness","cyrenaica","Mar 20, 2008"
3.21,-7.5,4,3,3.5,2.5,3,"Decent mouthfeel, maybe a bit too carbonated. This is a very refreshing beer and drinkable, I would buy this again.","GodOfBeer","Jan 12, 2008"
3.23,-6.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Overall I am under the impression that this brew has changed a couple times over the years, but for the best. A decent cream ale for sure, but the hefty price tag might turn people away ( $49.95 for 24 bottles) Still a good summertime brew and worth checking out.","drinkininthewood","Dec 04, 2007"
2.14,-38.3,2,3,1.5,4,1.5,"Bottle from the LCBO. This beer did not live up to my hopes. Both the pour and the aroma reminded me of a lager - its a golden colour with a very minimal white head, while the aroma is a subdued mix of sweet malts and grass. The taste, too be frank, is extremely disappointing. All I can taste is malt and grain, with the creaminess only coming through in the aftertaste. A nice texture on the palate, but a beer needs a lot more than that. My wife tasted it and agreed, saying well at least its better than a blue or canadian. Unfortunately, thats all I can say about a beer I really wanted to like.","bobsy","Sep 29, 2007"

3.62,4.3,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Dark gold copper with a white, pristine head. However, the foam quickly disipates, leaving just a thin ring of film. Smells a bit of citrus, candy, bread and caramel. Even a bit of golden delicious apples. Interesting. Taste is quite simple. Lightly sweet at first, with a definite malt backbone. Their is a subdued apple and lemon tartness, with some caramel sweetness. Almost a candy apple flavour. Finishes slightly earthy and bitter. The finish is definitely the best part. Crisp, and lighty carbonated, making for a very drinkable beer. Another session beer, and quite nice. A cottage beer.","slitherySOB","Aug 15, 2006"

Overall, this is above your run of the mills Ontario easy drinking beer but it isnt a great beer either.","Phyl21ca","Jul 06, 2003"
2.85,-17.9,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"An average beer, but likely reformulated since these early reviews. Smell originally malty and fruity, then plain after warming up to room temperature. Short lived head. Creamy and malty, with a spot of fruit. OK with dinner at the end of a summer day.","Sammy","Jan 12, 2003"

The color was promising, a nice dark copper, but the promise wasn't kept. This ins't an awful drink, there's just nothing worth noting about it. Not much of a smell, no distinct taste, just another boring Canadian beer, eh?","RedBeerchetta","Beers"
