"O: At the end of the day, this is a cheap beer that can be bought in large quantities. It's definitely better than some of the other 'lawnmower' beers that people seem to love so much. Seemingly would be perfect for college frat parties. Or just when you want a cheap refreshing beer that does just enough to be decent."
"Picked up just because of the stubby bottles and cheap price. Clear straw super pale. Good carbonation. Taste is kind of boozy for some reason but was a good beer"
""
"Perhaps nostalgia made it taste for me. Slight maltiness followed by fruit. Then its over. The stubby bottle and the label would get a 5 from me if aesthetics in packaging were a category."
"Pours a pale yellow with a very small fizzy white head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is of a light grassy hops. The taste is the same with a slight sweet finish. Actually very smooth with a good taste."
""
""
"Lots of poor publicity in Rochester area. Blind tasting confirms its a great beer. Smooth and easy to drink."
""
"Smooth and creamy but still refreshing. Hood wheat smell. Very tasty and easy to drink. Can design is simple and cool."
"I think that, though not obviously the pinnacle of anything, this beer is somewhat iconic. It is underrated, cheap, and fills a niche that some people believe only this brand can...it is a classic and I love my forest green simplicity...hey it Genny..."
"A good everyday kind of beer that is more complex and tastes better than a lot of people give it credit for. Nothing mind blowing here just good simple beer you can enjoy at a excellent price."
""
""
"Overall- I ordered this off of the beer list under ""your Daddy's beers"" it also had Dixie, Lonestar and Iron City listed.  It was a nice throw back to my teen age years."
""
"Do not let the Almighty pluck you off the planet before getting yourself a cream ale.  It's a delightful pint.  Nice taste and enjoyable end."
"Had not had in along time good smoothe brew"
""
""
"Not bad, great for a buck..."
""
"This is an old beer that hasn't changed in a long time"
"flattish, was beer of last resort when kids, and is now."
""
"I was weaned on this beer. I can't help but love it!"
"Not a beer to guzzle, or to get a buzz on...too heavy...but great to enjoy one or two with a nice stogie, or by itself if you enjoy a that smooth yet bitter texture.  Basically, it's the poor man's Boddingtons...a creamy, bitey ale at a bargain price."
"Very good cream ale. The best cheep beer out there, if you can find it. 4.1"
""
"A stark white thick foam with great retention and lacing. Color is a clear, sickly yellow. Sweet corn and semblance of flavor is the result for the flavor dept. Very watery and uninteresting though. Who the hell could chug a whole monster can of this?"
""
""
""
""
""

"Yup...it's pretty okay...I've had worse and I've had better cream aleS. Don't judge :)"

"Where have you been Genny? New go to cheap beer when taste buds need a break. Easy drinking not sure wouldn't like it."

"Many years ago, on a hill far above a certain lake, this was my Saturday night special treat. I just drank a can for auld lang syne. Flat, smooth, ""creamy", but it was much better fifty years ago, when I had more hair, less fat, fewer wrinkles and less money. Might be a good foil for a boilermaker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad go for a regional macro adjunct, especially for the price point of about $0.50 per 12 oz can. As has been mentioned by other reviewers, this is a fantastic beer to bring to a party, music festival, or similar event. If you're looking for an amazing beer experience, then by all means, pass on by. For what it is, however, this is decent."

"Genesee Cream Ale had a good flavour of wheat with a light taste of hops.  Genesee Cream Ale lost its carbonation pretty fast.  People who enjoy a flat beer with a great taste may enjoy Genesee Cream Ale.  I am the person who posted the Genesee Cream Ale photo."

"Overall (3.5): When i rate an adjunt i tend to compare them as a class of their own as just about every one would get less than a 2 other wise, and thats just not fair as there are some respectable macros out there. And i would include Genesse Cream Ale in that echelon. Nothing stands out about it per se, but what is there is exceptional for the price ($13.99/30 pack). Very clean aromas and flavors between grainy malts, creamy corn, and a slight hop presence. Yes, i said it, hops! As if that weren't surprising enough, this beer is also exceptionally smooth considering the style. Overall one of the few beers i purchase in this price range, the others being Yuengling and PBR."

"It's malty, that's for sure.  And it offers something to chew on.  Easy to go through a few in a short amount of time.  No, this isn't a radical wild yeast / farmhouse / craft beer, but it's a fine buddy to bring to a party."

"Comes in a 30 pack | drinkable | good-looking can | outstanding backyard beer | great paired with Cornhole and grilled salmon | the overall experience is greater than the sum of its constituent parts"

"Overall: I'm surprised this is so poorly rated. It's not crafty or complex, but it's not trying to be and certainly doesn't need to be. It's a good no-frills cheap beer, and you can find the 24 oz. cans for something like $1.50, which is a pretty decent deal for a beer of this caliber."
"It's rare that don't finish a beer. Even beers I don't like I can finishe but this was not one of them. Maybe I had a bad can. It tasted metallic and very amateurish. This not a complex beer at all. I would rather drink a bud than take another sip of this. Not recommended at all."
"Genesee Cream Ale brewed by Genesee Brewing Co. This brew pours out a nice golden amber color. Genesee Cream Ale has a small white head. This brew smells like nothing that stands out too much. The taste is bold but not too bold. This brew goes down smooth not too heavy and not too light. This is better than regular Genesee, this brew has more to it. Overall I give this brew a 3 out of 5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice easy drinker for the price point."
""
"Anyway, bottom line is that nostalgia can only take you so far. My palate is completely different now. The best thing I can say about this is that it's not particularly offensive. But I have zero interest in revisiting this brew ever again. Life's too short to drink this, no matter how cheap it may be."

"pretty well meets the BA style guidelines but it still tastes bad to me."
"O: For the price, this beer is 5/5 and is perfect for any occasion. It's usually not as tinny as this one was, so I'd usually rate it 3.75. This really is an underdog and I think a lot of others think the same. Cheers everyone! :)"

"So..I had to try it again after a 30 year hiatus. Actually...not bad. Nothing special, but I get it...for someone seeking a smooth creamy beer with not a lot of flavor. Just hoping Genny Screamers don't follow!"
""
"O - For what it is, I still love it after 30+ years. The beer ""pairs"" very well with foods like hot wings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is crystal clear and pale golden with an inch of pure white head. Some sticky lacing left behind. The aroma is pretty mild, with some corn and grain notes. The tasters certainly a step up from the aroma. Smooth on the palate. Grain, cereal, md sweetness. For what it is, it's pretty easy to drink."

"DATE TASTED: November 24, 2013... GLASSWARE: Hobgoblin stick... OCCASION: sending off the Browns' playoff chances... APPEARANCE: crystal clear golden body with subtle, steady carbonation; two-finger white head is rocky and soapy; appropriate... AROMA: metallic/aluminum ping up front; thick bread dough follows; otherwise, nondescript... PALATE: easily drinkable; fizzy art the finish; not as creamy as one would wish--or I remembered--but pleasant enough to be consumed in mass quantities...TASTE: subtle beech wood backbone sets up a bready consistency--some floral notes on the exhale engages the tastebuds...OVERALL: revisiting an old favorite--one that fetched thirty-six (!) cans in college for $10, plus a five-dollar mail-in rebate! All things considered, not a bad beer to slam or pong with, play cards or case race with...as a stand-alone, not quite the character or quality necessary to catch attention...still, nostalgia is strong..."

"First cream ale I have had but I like the balance between the Pilsner and Ale that makes this style of beer unique.Bought at local convenience store for 1.99 for a 40oz. Initial reaction to smell was light beer smell that is pleasing to the nose but not over powering. Overall taste is enjoyable with a sweetness followed by a mild hopiness that balances out nicely. Very enjoyable on a budget and has a level of complexity that you can appreciate in a large production beer that is rarely scene these days for companies that have been sold to large beverage conglomerates. Its starts sweet and then the hops kick in and then finishes smooth, which is a nice play on the palate that made the overall drinking experience very enjoyable. It retains its character throughout the whole 40oz and unlike Budweiser seems that its integrity has been left in-tacked since the company buy out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who can appreciate a cream ale and who wants a quality product at a reasonable price without sacrificing taste and refreshment."

"Overall, this is a macro style cream ale, but its got a good bit of flavor from the sweeter malt and ale yeast."
""
"Purchased in Chattanooga, TN. $9.99 a 12 pack in cans. Appearance is a light yellow and clear and pours with a slight bit of head with a little lacing. Smell suggests a slight bit of alcohol note with some citrusy overtones. Taste is a malty bread like note with apple, and some clove notes to finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth with no bad aftertaste. This is overall, cheap, excellent and a great session American Cream Ale. Smooth, delicious, and easy to drink. Beats the BMC offerings and usually cheaper to boot. I would drink much more of this if I could get it easier without an hour's drive South."
""
""
""
"12oz can. Pours a translucent super pale yellow with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is sour with some grains. Hints of creamy sweetness. The taste is a blend of the sweet lactose, bread, and some cut grass. Slightly sour towards the finish. Surprising amount of booze flavor considering the low ABV. Light and creamy mouthfeel on a beer that is insanely drinkable. Overall, its not a bad beer by any stretch and considering the price it's a good one to have in the fridge regularly. I know I'll have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- One of my choices in super value price beer, but not one of my first choices overall. The appearance and mouthfeel are something special, and give this brew a step above some other AAL offerings."
""
""
"A beer with the high school memories. Back then you always saw this beer in 12 oz bottles. Now I just see it in 12 oz cans. This is a nice beer to sit back after a hard day and have a couple cold ones. I think it is better than Budweiser, which is also more expensive. An enjoyable American adjunct lager (I know it is actually officially a cream ale) for us folks that enjoy them."
""
"Overall - I don't hate this beer, but at the same time I'm not really crazy about it, either. I wouldn't put it on my no-fly list, but I won't buy it ever again, and I wouldn't suggest it to anyone."
""
""
"i bought a sixer of this last night for $4.99. good to know budget beer that isn't awful still exists. while far from a delicious craft cream ale, this is still a pretty palatable brew by my standards, and has a lot more flavor and texture than the standard bmc swill. it pours perfectly clear, light golden in color, with some rapidly moving bubbles and a frothy white head that starts pretty tall, but fades out rather quickly to just a thin film. the nose is a touch metallic, but it has some decent pale grains and a soft sweetness that meshes well. the first half of the flavor experience is right on, delicate cereal grains mix with a true to its name creaminess that really works, but the second half is riddled by metallic overtones and a non hop bitter finish that lasts way too long on my tongue. a decent enough session beer if you can stomach a bunch of these, its light with a nice expansive feel and good carbonation, without being like a yellow soda. three quarters of a step above the miller light coors light bud lights of the world."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I picked up a 24oz can of this at the gas station for $1.19. My expectations were extremely low, but I was pleasantly surprised by what turned out to be a decent and very drinkable brew. Just as you would expect, it's very frothy and creamy, with hints of banana, and is fairly nutty. An alright brew that beats the hell outta that 24oz can of Bud sitting right next to it, sporting a price tag that is a buck higher."

"Sweet and fruity nose here. Reminds me of apple and strawberry-banana juices, with some cheap beer aroma mixed in. The flavor is pretty much exactly like the nose suggests. It's a soft and creamy with banana and apple playing a big part. Despite the fruitiness, its not as sweet as some other cheap American lagers. Carbonation is low to moderate."
""
""
""
""
"For the price... well, it's far from the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth. It's actually pretty damn quaffable, all things considered. As expected, it's pretty light in flavor and aroma, but maybe that's the silver lining. The sweetness isn't so sickeningly cloying like many people are saying, but I didn't give it much time to warm up, so perhaps that's the key."

"O- I love this beer. One of my favorites. Way better beer than the price you pay."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- It's a cheaper beer, so that has to be kept in mind. It is very good for the price ($13/30rack), and is a nice little change form the typical cheap american beers."

"Overall a very non offensive macro style brew. Easy drinking but dont let it get too warm."
""
"O: 3.75 - a nice, refreshing, clean and easy to drink beer that would be a solid lawnmower beer but doesn't offer much else; however, it's a good budget beer that I would not turn down if put in front of me like many American adjunct lagers"
""
"O- The mouthfeel and taste are great for a bargain beer. I find this refreshing and provides enough taste for me to realize I'm getting a good deal. I always buy this over bud, miller, etc."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a pretty good beer and it was found at a great price, so you can't beat that. Definitely worth the money, but I can't see myself buying it at a higher price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good beer to get really drunk off of, or to sip slowly like a boss, pinky out, at the Brew House. Your choice."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"All things considered (the fact that it's an adjunct and that the beer is well over a year old, if I'm reading the dating correctly), Genesee Cream Ale is a very reasonably priced, decent tasting beer. The after taste irks me a little bit, but it's still something I'd much rather drink over a Budweiser, or even Coors... even if it's 500+ days old like this can is."
""
""
"Genesee can be a great bargain, and is especially advisable after the palate has taken a beating from more complex brews. Competitive with revived Schlitz as the finest of the cheap American adjunct beers. Genesee shoots for merely ""not bad," and runs headlong into ""OK."""

"To heck with nostalgia - the grim reality of why it's been a quarter of a century between purchases struck hard. It is a great 25cent beer for somebody on a very tight budget (PBR seems to fill that bill with those darn whippersnappers today), but this stuff just can't stand on its own."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the taste and the feel. The nose started things off on an overly adjuncty, cheap foot. There was not sweetness or creaminess to be noted, with little else of anything at all for that matter. The flavoring made up for this a bit, but it was overly simplified in its bittering, graininess. Regardless of what you say about this, or how you rate it, this is a Rochester staple, and anyone from the area should be proud to toast of glass of it from time to time."
""
""
"Have been disappointed lately with the new can exterior graphic design. Makes it look ""generic"" or something purchased at a Dollar Store. Although the great taste of the ale beer, I would be embarassed to ofer it to a friend, it looks soooo... cheap."
""
""
""
"The can is pretty cool looking too...i would drink this more often but the pricepoint where i live makes it not worth the price,"

"Light to medium bodied with average carbonation, Finishes dry, with no real aftertaste. This is not a beer I care to try again. Bland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And with that criteria, I give it a 85/100 in the pounder beer category."
""
""
"Overall not bad. Much less terrible than i expected. Just a touch of corn and dried malt extract flavor, a very light tinny skunk flavor as i think the can helps, and overall decent malt and hop flavors. Surprised as hell, and for $1 for a 24oz can you cant beat that."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale malt, cream, hint of hops, hint of sweet malt, and hint of rice. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hops, hint of cream, and a hint of rice/corn. Overall, the cream aroma and body are weak, and the corn/rice flavor is prevalent in both body and feel."
""
""
""
""
"I reckon this is slightly above average for the style."
""
"Poured from a 24oz. can into a lager glass. Poured like absolute shit due to it being so carbonated and from a huge can. Seriously had to stop and continue the pour multiple times because it kept wanting to run down the side of the can and onto my jeans. Anyway, Pours a very adjunct like medium yellow with a two finger bubbly white head, Leaving half decent lacing. The smell was of cooked vegetables, rice, and some corn adjunct. Nothing more, Nothing less. Tasted like a light lager and almost completely follows the nose. This beer MUST have been wrongly marketed as a cream ale, Because it has no characteristics of a a cream ale whatsoever. It seriously tastes like a light lager without the artificial metallic aftertaste. Also, The beer starts to taste very heavily of rubbing alcohol as you get further into the glass. The mouthfeel brings nothing additional to the table in terms of anything. Overall, The beer isn't offensive, Definitely NOT a cream ale. However, Due to it's easy drink-ability , I'll give it a slightly higher score in this category. Would I buy it again? No."
"Notes: Born and raised in Rochester area, this beer was a rite of passage in the early 60's. Had to try it again, didn't think it was as strong as it used to be After a night of this beer you were very aromatic and hung over! Not bad for what it is. Would still pound a couple on a hot day down at Hamlin Beach State Park. Not to be kept in your reefer."

"I bought this can from my local bodega, I choose this particular beer based on not knowing anything about it. Pours an idyllic macro appearance; pale yellow, soapy head and lots of visible carbonation. The smell isn't bad, corn, malt sweetness and a faint hop presence. The taste is sweet, but not cloyingly sweet, beyond that there isn't a lot. There is a lot of carbonation, otherwise this beer would be a little thin. Overall, if I had $1.50 for a beer budget, this would not be a bad choice at all. Not in any way offensive."
"Pours a clear golden with a medium white head. Aroma of corn. Taste is nice malt sweetness, followed by a neutral, light bitterness. Pretty straightforward. Average mouthfeel. The carbonation is a little high, but not too bad. Overall a decent beer, better than your average macro."
"O: My go to beer many years ago as a student living in upstate NY, this was cheap and more interesting, if not actually better than, the dominant products from AB and Miller.  Many years later, this is not particularly interesting or complex, but a decent lager for a hot day. Above average for the price point, even here in the south. 3.25"

"Overall: this is actually a decent cream ale. I call it refreshing and decently tasty. Using ""overall"" for my drinkability score, this rates pretty good."
""
"O: since this is actually my first cream ale, I don't want to necessarily go out on a limb and say this is the best for its style, but I will say that this is very good if evaluated mainly on its taste. I would have this again."

"price point - $.99 for a 24oz can"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out golden with minimal head that fades to white blotching with no lacing. Smells of faint corn cob, grain husk, and cooked vegetables. Taste consists of malt sweetness, grains and a little booze, tad bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp, light, and refreshing with moderate carbonation. Nice change from some of the bigger beers out there. Overall, it's cheap and refreshing, not much else going on here."

"Paid .99 with no tax or deposit for 24 oz can on military post in New England. It was a sweet deal for me since this can would set you back two bucks in the South. Poured from can down the side of pint glass. Purposely left no remarkable head but a thin lacing remained throughout drinking period. Darker than your average lager but lighter than your average ale. Smell is not repelling but not the best. Taste is bready, sweet at first then slightly sour, definite caramel with slight alcohol aftertaste. Tons of bubbles and they stick around. This is my favorite beer to pair with pizza and cheesy foods, and Genny definitely got the price right. Rock on Genny!"
"Overall, a decent brew. I had this out the bottle and into a Czech pilsner glass. Cost me $0.80 at my favorite bottle-shop, Guntown Beer."

"If you are in the market for a drinkable beer for a price that will virtually not affect the wallet at all...Genesee is your beer hands down."

""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is only the second cream ale I've ever tried. It's definitely not a bad beer, I could drink on it all night.. But it's definitely not as good as the Little Kings cream ale I tried. That stuff was great."
""
""
"O- Better than expected, but pretty much a common lager. For some reason today it was just what I wanted."

"genesee cream... wow! i remember my old man and his best friend drinking this in the late 70s early 80s @ the hunting cabin in ""PRATTSVILLE NY""... and probably the ""PRATTSVILLE TAVERN"" as well... i myself hadn't had this in quite some time and picked up a 12 pack today... in my opinion this is one of the smoothest most drinkable brews i have had... no nasty aromas or after tastes to be had.. and maintains a thin cream like head throughout.. its thin but its there... far exceeds any offerings from BMC... good jod Genesee... keep it up! P.S. our thoughts are with the people of ""PRATTSVILLE NY"" hope to see you all soon at the tavern..."
""
""
""
"Taste is blander than the smell. Typical old man beer. Taste's like your uncle's breath smells. It's sweet and grainy. As old man beers go, this is probably the best I've had, though. Good job, Genesee."
"Body is light, bordering on medium. It attempts a creamy finish that it just can't seem to pull off. With that said, it is certainly thirst quenching and not unpleasant in the mouth at all."
""
"Not bad. Not great, but not bad."
""
""
"O: For a more macro-beer, this is better than most but still not something that I would consider better than average overall. Certainly not the best cream ale that I have experienced and certainly not the worst. If the aromas of the beer were better, it would be a huge improvement in the enjoyability. I have not had this beer since college in the early to mid 1990s but it tasted exactly as I remembered it."
"O: The mouthfeel and drinkability are the strongest points of this beer. The taste isn’t anything special but then again isn’t overly bad. I could drink this beer all day long."
"picked up a thirty pack for $15 for my brothers birthday because he is a cream ale fan. poured into a pilsner glass very slow still resulted in a four finger head. luckily the head recedes very quickly to a bright white foam cap about a quarter inch thick. the cap stuck around for the remainder of th drink and left behind lacing from top to bottom of the glass. the body of the beer was a crystal clear light golden color with a million bubbles rising to the top, unfortunatly this is the best part of the beer. the smell and taste were like someone poured cream soda over corn flakes. very sweet with a lot of corn flavor. mouthfeel is a medium to thin body with good carbonation. creamy feel with a slight hops presence. overall this is a pretty average cream ale, worth trying."

"O- A pretty average cream ale across the board."
"It goes down smooth and would be good on a hot day but that's about it. Pretty unimpressive and really not that good of a beer."
""
""
""
"Not quite sure what this is supposed to be. Had in a bottle - perhaps it was too old. Nonetheless, it had an unbearable sour flavor with no real redeeming quality. Very light body - which was expected - but the flavor missed on all marks. It's too bad, as very few cream ale crafts are on the market."

"My favorite cheap beer ($12 for 30!). Not as ""clean"" tasting as your average lager, has some taste going on. Refreshing."
""
""
"Overall this is a great adjunct beer, as far as ""lawn mower"" brews go this should be at the top of anyone's list. And the best thing about it is the price is truly right."
"O- At $3.99 for 6 bottles, you could do a lot worse. Not something I'll buy regularly for myself, but it has its place in a party setting."
""
"O: This doesnt really compare with a good cream ale, but its a decent example for the 1.99 price for a 22 oz."
""
"Overall - For its price and style a good brew. Nothing working pining over, but a good session beer for those of us without disposable income."

"M - Light body. Medium carbonation."

"O: Overall a very drinkable brew. Probably not something I would knock back a lot of. But certainly something to change the pace.."

"O: I didn't hate it. At a dive bar with no other beer options, I'd order a pint of Genny Cream Ale in a heartbeat. Why not? It's a WNY tradition."

"The mouthfeel is light overall, but it definitely feels fuller then most comparable macros. Overall, it's a good beer when compared to others in it's class and price range. It's smooth, crisp, relatively flavorful and easy drinking. I'm from Western New York so this is a staple in many of my friends houses still. I'm always happy to choose this one out of their fridge before any other macro they may have in there. I think this beer compares very favorable to others in it's class, but overall I recognize that it's not really going to compare nearly as favorable to more expensive craft versions."

"O: A decent, inexpensive adjunct. No problem grabbing a few of these when on a budget."

"Purchased a few 24 oz. cans at the local stop-n-steal for .99 apiece (plus 10 cents deposit, cause I live in MI). I poured the beer into a glass to report its color and smell. It pours a clear gold color, with thick foamy head and decent retention and lacing. Honestly, it smells pretty awful. Do yourself a favor and just drink it out of the can. As with the Genesee ice, it tastes a LOT better out of the can. Conclusion? It's better than Bud, Miller, or Coors Lt. It's cheap, infinitely drinkable and...cheap. Just don't pour it out of the can."
""
""
""

""

"While this beer is nothing special per se, I do appreciate it more than most of the standard lagers and cream ales out there. It is very crisp, clean, I find more carbonated than average, but seems to please groups of people that try it. It's definitely worth revisiting if you want something in this vein; the price isn't bad either."
"Cheers!"
""
"O: A good cream ale, in fact, ""Genny Screamers"" have been a around in my family for a long long time."
"Drink- Its a pretty average beer but doesnt as I say offend me or make me want to pour it. Has a good smooth finish."
"Genesee Cream Ale is my first venture into the Cream Ale style so I have nothing to compare it to. However, the ale is what I was expecting from the style, nothing more – nothing less."
"Overall - It's a very drinkable beer, but there isn't a whole lot going for it in terms of flavor. I would classify this as a beer that you'd drink after working on the yard all afternoon; It's a beer that sacrifices taste in favor of being refreshing."
"A decent change up from macros without making them heavy or tough to drink. A good option to pound many of and get drunk without drinking a totally crappy beer."
"At first glance, this beer looks and smells iaverage. It pours a light creamy color with a bit of creamy head and an aroma of sweet malts and hops. The beer has the perfect amount of carbonation and goes down smoothly. A very worthy effort indeed. Definitely a must for any fan of cream ales."
"O- Not bad, but not particularly good. Would probably be a good intro beer for the BMC crowd, as it is not overpowering in any aspect."
"Overall (3.5): Hey, it’s Genny Cream. What were you looking for? All things considered, not so bad."
"Notes: Ok beer. Not quite as sweet, creamy, corny flavored as some cream ales. More like a sweet light lager. Fruitiness is interesting but I'm not sure exactly whether I like it or not. Not bad for a very cheap beer."
"Reviewed from notes. Enjoyed many times over the years, formally reviewed here for the first time. Pours a straw yellow color into Genesee Cream Ale pilsner glass with a good mix of carbonation that yields a decent head of about a half an inch to an inch. Smell of corn, a bit of yeast and general sweetness, taste is good and clean with a sweetness of corn and a very mild ale finish. Coats the mouth and tongue pretty well as it should for a cream style ale. Very good for the price and the style and lately has replaced PBR and even Lil Kings Cream Ale as my go to cheapy session beer to have on hand with the good stuff...better the the usual BMC suspects. I wish Genesee would revert back to the old school design from the late 70's/early 80's as this can/bottle design reminds me more of a soda pop can then a beer. Great price @ $13.99 for 30 cans."
"Bright yeller like my xterra and a running white head...Sweet corn and a little sour mash in the nose. Light malts and some hints of grains are all there is to it but truly better than other beers I've had with the same palate. I could pound like ten of these for smoothness of body, this could be a go to beer games beverage. Nothing huge here, just a smooth beer."
"Overall, this is definitely one of the best ""bang for your buck"" beers out there. Cheaper around here than a lot of AALs, and way better too."
"O-good but not great could be an easy everyday go to drink"
"O: This would be my go to beer if I wanted something on the cheap side that actually tasted like more than watered down BMC crap"
"Overall this doesn't even taste creamy, in fact it taste like regular ""Genny"" but weaker. Not much to say about this, but it could be worse I suppose."
"I’m from Upstate New York and went to college near Rochester, so Genny was always the running joke of what a cheap beer was. But this wasn’t as bad as I remember it. We’ll see with the other Genny beers."
"This is one of my perennial favorites going back to the early 70's. Nothing like a couple of ""Jennies"" on a hot summer day! Light in color,a very pleasant aroma, great taste. A more than one beer, and not bad even straight from the can! Well known in the New York Metro area."
"overall; this is a good beer for drinkin when you got time or work to do. i like the bottles and some the cans but the best is draft beer creamers. the Guv used a fill jugs of draft cream ale and bring'em to the fire station in caroga, they tasted good but next morning i was on the can for quiet a while."
"all in all, pretty much what I expected. but not worse. the weirdest thing for me was that it was nearly as enjoyable as it warmed, even at room temp. which kicks the rating up just a notch in my book. plus at a buck for a 24oz can, it's Barker!"
"Beer is medium in body and drinkable. Flavor is fine. Again leadiff sweetness a dry finish. I drank the whole thing but I doubt i would bother having any more than that. It reminded me too much of a cheap lager and not like a thoughtful beer."
"O - Not a bad upgrade from AAL and BMC, but nothing special"
" This tastes similar to what I remember having as a youth with cans floating in Penn's creek that fisherman anchored with rocks. The grain is there with an almost bready yeast and sweet adjunct flavor in the background, not too high like corn-pops, but noticeable and it seems light in the hops department which is standard considering this is the American immigrants version of a helles more or less. The taste finishes semi-dry and Overall I was satisfied with a pleasant amount of malt flavor and some adjunct backing it up vs. the other way around which most of the macro variety seem to be."
"Overall – This is definitely a better than average beer that is hard to beat for the price. There is nothing here that is going to blow your mind, but it has a little bit of a different taste that keeps it interesting."
"Reviewer's note: Just say no to twist-offs! :/"
"Pours a clear light yellow with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. Nice distinct rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains and unbaked bread dough. Taste is of sweet grains and corn flakes. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is very easy to drink. I am glad I got to try this one as I have never seen this anywhere else in California."
"O: It hits the spot. I'm sure I'll be more impressed by the 8-pack of fancy schmancy Brewery Ommegang ales I bought alongside this can, but it's good for what it is, and $1.20 for a 24 oz can is a steal."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. Thea roma is grain with a little bit of lemon mixed in. As the beer gets a little warmer I start to get some bubblegum notes, similar to what you get in some German wheat beers. The flavor doesn't have any of the bubblegum in it, but it goes have a lot of wheat, grain and a little bit of cream. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"RJT"
"Overall, if this beer had a bolder flavor and milder carbonation, it would be a decent beer. This however is a little weak, but being from Western PA originally, it's a beer I seem to pick up at least once a year."
"Notes: My 2nd Genesee Beer today. This is substantially better than Genesee Beer as the aroma, mouthfeel and taste are all better. Very refreshing, a real Summer Session beer. At the price this would be the beer to buy on a budget."
"Overall: Not bad for a cheap, light brew. Not a ton of flavor, but sometimes you want something like that."
"Overall this is a simple but pleasant beer. It made some very good beer-can chicken and I enjoyed drinking it while cooking. A good summertime lawnmower beer for sure!"
"O: glad I tryed it, its not nasty but not great either."
"O - nothing special here"
"24 oz ""tall boy"" can from Grocery Oulet,Salem. 99cents Poured into a shaker glass. Pale golden beer with a very nice sized white frothy head.Also leaves good lace down the glass. Aroma? paper,corn and veggie. Taste..semi sweet, doughy, a little hay..plain and simple. Not bad on the palate..lowish carbonation makes this palatable. Overall plain cheap beer. Not as good as i remembered from the 1990s..but still a respectable effort for a 99 cent tallboy."
"Overall I thought this was a good Cream Ale and the best one I have had to date. It was a pretty light and subtle flavored brew that had awesome drinkability, I could drink more then a couple of these during the day, especially during a couple rounds of disc golf, its goes down smooth and is quite refreshing which makes for a good session beer. Even though this is a cream ale and not an adjunct lager I still feel they are both in the same league and are very similar and when comparing this with the macro lagers the cream ale comes out on top, all the flavors that are there are nice and unoffensive just like it should be, I would take one of these over any of the major macros any day of the week. I would buy this again it makes for a good session beer and it was an excellent choice for beer can chicken. If you are looking for a light refreshing and sessionable cream ale then grab a genny cream. After buying this on a whim for beer can chicken I have become a fan of this beer and it is now my go to light session ale, everything is simple but done well."
"Pour revealed a one finger head of pure white foam with moderate clinging lace. Color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Lots of little bubbles in this brew. Smell is a bit sweet, with aromas of malt, corn, and very light scent of hops. Taste is also a little sweet malt, boiled corn, rice, with a slight tinge of grapefruit and pine. Mouthfeel is a little watery, but the carbonation has a good effect. While this beer is not a sample of something I would give to special beer drinking guests. I would keep some on hand in the hot Georgia summer days when I had to venture out and work in the yard. And for the price, this beer is not bad at all."
"Overall, its fine. Glad I got one can from the bar and don't have 5 more to get rid of."
"Priced somewhere between macro and craft, that is somewhat admirable, but really, no quality of the beer other than its price is, and given that fact, (or opinion) it isn't really priced well all things considered (what am I, Nina Totenberg?)"
"Golden beer with a wispy head that quickly dissolves. Smells of sweet, roasted vegetables. Flavors of sweet corn and fruit nectar. Decent, creamy body. Way cheaper than a macro lager and more enjoyable to drink. Not something I'll be having very often, but I'll certainly opt for it over an adjunct."
"This is my grandfather's favorite beer. He's been drinking this since I don't know when. anyway the beer pours out as a clear pale yellow color with some head that fades instantly. The smell is a little sweet mostly malts on the nose. The taste has a decent creaminess to it but nothing too over the top here. The mouthfeel has a good amount of carbonation to keep this one alive. The beer for me is respectable because of my grandfather. He drinks it so I drink it with him too it's a bonding moment with Genny."
"Overall not a bad macro, certainly better than any BMC product. pretty good quality for a cheap price."
"O: For a cheap mainstream beer this is pretty much what I always pick up. $14 a 30 rack is pretty cheap for a beer that absolutely trumps all Bud, Miller, and Coors. This beer holds a special place in my heart and is usually the one I go after when I am looking for cheap beer, although PBR gets me sometimes too. Good stuff for what it is."
"I'm gonna say it. It's an 'old timer ale,' but there's nothing wrong with that! Pours a pale golden color with a big quickly receding head, lacing slides down to meet the beer. Big corn smell, also smells very lager-y. The taste meets it there and if I weren't looking at that can I'd guess it's a lager. Now that I look at the can it claims at me: ""Flavor of a fine ale and the smoothness of a premium lager. I can't pinpoint the ale-ness, but I'd agree it drinks like a lager. Crisp carbonation, light body. What you would call 'an outdoor beer.' I gotta say, I'm not big on it knowing what else is out there in the category."
"Overall: Decent beer for a hot summer day. While I'm not familiar with the cream ale style, I feel like I've definitely had the style before in the form of adjunct lager. This isn't something I'd seek out, but it's a nice alternative to BMC when looking to drink several beers over the course of a hot summer day."
"I liked the creaminess...and it's definitely very drinkable. I wouldn't say that it's a top tier beer or anything but it's certainly better than other cheap beers at this price point. I mean 5.29 a 6 pack??"
"O/D-I am a bit torn. If I am to purchase a 30-pack, I am clearly buying some rather low quality beer. If I am going to do this, I want to spend as little money as possible. This beer is very inexpensive. But, I have trouble drinking several of these. The flavor seems to be an upgrade from the rest, but after a few it gets much harder to drink. I could conceivably opt to purchase a more watered-down macro because I will at least be able to drink more than four."
"Had to grab a second bottle o' this after the one I was gonna try was nicked by my girlfriend after she demeaned by homebrewed ESB. The nerve of some people, right? Anyway, it pours a clear straw topped by a finger of stark white foam. The nose comprises wheat, corn, and a touch of sweet flowers. The taste bases itself on this successful novel, but the director went too damn avant-garde with it, resulting in a campy, Hackers-like hard water flavor dousing the whole production and a sad excuse for an opening pull. Those poor investors...and to to think they'd just gotten over the calamity of Insidious... The body is a light with pretensions of heft, with a very light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty okay cream ale, but that hard water flavor ruins things a bit too much for my liking. Still, it somehow retains a good amount of its drinkability, so, though I don't think I'll be grabbing a case o' this any time soon, I won't spit on someone if they offer it to me later on."
"Genesee Cream Ale is a typical ""Cheap"" beer in every way. It has a typical head that pours thick and dissipates quickly. It smells like every cheap beer that I've ever smelled, smells like. I think it's corn and grain. The taste is a little better than other cheap beers because it does taste creamy. Oddly enough I don't get a creamy mouth feel, just a typical fizzy bubbly feel. Overall this beer is average. It's drinkable and for $1.00 it's worth a try."
"Genesee's Cream Ale from 24oz can into standard 16oz pint. Pours golden straw color, with a fizzy white head that doesnt stick around for long. smells like grains, corn, and a bit of musk. Tastes pretty good to be such a cheap offering. Light malts, a bit of steamed veggies, corn husks, and a strange lactose like presense. Mouthfeel is soft and mellow as the can indicates, almost silky. Overall I like this beer and will get a few more to have around, hopefully they will drop these in 30pk 12oz cans near my house, I would honestly drop my Milwaukee's Best Ice for this one. Cheers!"
"I picked up a 6 pack of this today on a whim. 16oz cans, six of em for 4.99 now that's value. I've bought 7oz bottles for more than that. Anyhow, this beer is one of the first that my dad shared with me many many years ago, and a few years before I was legal. Pours a bright crystal clear light golden color with a fluffy white head that slowly recedes to a cap. Smells like creamed corn, slightly sweet grainy aroma with a hint of floral hops. Taste is a sweet grainy with hints of apple and maybe some floral hops if I close my eyes and think about it a bit. Watery/creamy mouthfeel, medium to thin body with a medium to high level of carbonation. Certainly nothing earth shattering here, but nothing really offensive either."
"one of the best I have had from this brewery. Golden color with a medium head. Smell of corn and cream. Tastes very smooth. Mouthful is very smooth and creamy. Drinkabilty is wonderful. A 6.99 a six pack this beer is a really good steal. Would recommend this beer for you average joe"
"Can't go wrong with a 24 ounce can for 95 cents. Not a horrible beer and far from the worse. This is an excellent summer beer to have a lot of with friends."
"Pours a typical clear amber, but it least it has a fairly thick and somewhat persistent white head. Aroma is malty and slightly fruity, nothing special but at least it's OK. Flavor is crisp and malty with just a bit of fruity sweetness, nothing special but still enjoyable. Texture is fairly smooth and fizzy. This is better as a party beer, or as an accompaniment to a meal, than a stand-alone drink, but it's still all right."
"Cant argue with the drinkability on this one. I'd tear these up in the summer, and the creamy, light feel makes me feel less guilty about drinking something like this."
"From the 16 fl. oz. can no. 3350-07. Sampled on March 4, 2011. The pour is a straw yellow with a fizzy, foamy, long-lasting white head. The aroma is moderate in malts, adjuncts, and even a bit of yeast but low in hops. The taste has this slight yeastiness believe it or not with a hint of bitter hops during the finale. This is one of my favorite classic macros. Of course this would not be high on a craft beer enthusiast's want list but it refreshes just the same."
"D- Im good for a few of these, its a nice change once in a while esp for the price but hard to get through more than a few with out becoming bored very bored."
"This beer is a session beer in my book, I enjoyed it a lot. It's notably heavier in body than a light beer and about the same compared to a lager, only it has some depth that you just don't get out of the big three and in in other macro lagers. This beer is the only cream ale that I've had up to now, but judging by my impressions from it this is a style for me. I'll definitely be on the lookout for other cream ales to try in the future."
"Had this on tap at Anchor Bar in Buffalo. Comes to the table pale yellow without any head whatsoever. No lacing on the glass. Smells like watered down corn syrup I think. Surprisingly high carbonation given there is no head. Carbonation this high makes it a bit hard to get the beer down. I'd rather most macro lagers over this I think."
"For 99 cents a can, this is probably one of the best values going. Seriously, why are people making a big fuss over Big Flats when you can get the same amount of Genny Cream for the same price? For the style and the price, this is honestly an exceptional brew."
"Poured from a 24 oz aluminum can into a pint glass, Genesee Cream Ale is a deep golden-yellow color with a creamy white head. The nose is malty sweet, lightly fruity and fairly strong with adjuncts. The flavor is similar to the nose; lightly fruity with a malt/adjunct grain finish, hops only to balance and even that is on the light side. Carbonation is creamy but the beer itself is incredibly light and goes down smooth. Overall, a drinkable beer - very economical too, this 24 oz can cost me $.99!"
"slightly above average drinkability, and the key factor here is 15 dollar = 30 geney cream cans"
"Overall: One of the better Adjunct lagers. And you cant beat the price. For what it is it's not half bad."
"Cheap. Drinkable. And I guess you can consider it local. I would go for one of these again, doesn't taste as good as say a Coors Banquet but still decent. Has a bit more flavor, not in a good way, but there is a hint of cream which on the other hand is nice. I would rank it better than Bud and Coors Light for sure, better overall taste."
"I have a tradition. On Super Bowl Sunday I go to Frank and Teresa's Anchor Bar on Main Street in Buffalo to pick up some original Chicken Wings. While waiting for my order I enjoyed a nice Genny Cream because I thought it would make the experience most authentic. The Ale had a very pleasant bright yellow appearance. Its bouquet was subtle. It was very refreshing to drink served ice cold. It is certainly different from the more complex beers I've been samplind lately, yet I really enjoyed it for what it was."
"I like the flavor and mouthfeel. I taste some sweet corn, some hops, it's your basic mild tasting, medium strength beer. I enjoy beer of this general style just as long as they don't bite me back and after downing 24 ozs in short order I'm here to say that this is pretty good beer."
"You can do better, but it's nice filler I think."
"I would call this an below average beer."
"Pouring a pale golden with creamy lacing, this has an adjunct scent up front, with maybe a trace of honey sweetness. The taste is smooth and malty, and sweeter than a traditional lager, but lighter in body than most ales. A decent, if unremarkable middle grounder for the craft beer-curious."
"D: If I want to put back a few this is an excellent beer. This is one of my go to beers if I plan on having a long night. I also light to support locals."
"A pretty good budget beer, try it sometime!"
"Drinkability - where can I pour it out at?"
"Drinkable, dry finish."
"Thanks again Santa Adam for a brew I most likely would have never bought so not have had a chance to try. I poured this into a Sam Adams glass and was greeted with a great three finger white fluffy head on top of a clear golden yellow body. I got a lot of sweet malts coming from the nose with a light floral hop note there as well. It was sweet and crisp in my mouth with a light bitter finish. It had a light mouthfeel and great carbonation. It was really easy to drink I cold have had a few more. For the price I see on six packs I think its not bad but I like Narragansett as a local favorite better for a cheap drinking beer."
"Notes: What do you buy when all the good beer stores are closed on Xmas? Go to the gas station. This is better than your basic BMC beer, but is very reminiscent of it."
"Drinkability is so so, decent refreshing lager I think... But it's certainly not one I would revisit."
"Value: You'll be searching for a long time to find a beer that can beat this one for FOUR BUCKS a six pack. Great choice when you're waitin on pay day."
"Great mouthfeel, just the right amount of CO2. Not harsh at all. Very drinkable! One of the easiest 40's to down. I would like to try this again, especially if I can find it on tap. What a value!"
"Overall the first sip of this was easily the worst but as I became accustomed to the flavors I found it to be quite palatable. Obviously not worth seeking out but not a terrible beer for the style."
"D: Another anodyne thirst quencher. But then it is a cream ale. Both similar to and different from BMC. It does have a touch more flavor, both in amplitude and complexity."
"D - Sure. Listen its Genesee so it is what it is. It's a decent beer for drinking and a good price. I would grab one way before Bud/Coors. Its not a Duvel but its good for bbq's. It brought me back 25 years to my 18 year old time grabbing em out of my fathers frig."
"A bit more body and sweetness is just enough to push it past BMC standards. Not a great beer or a style exemplar, but drinkable when it's there."
"D- look I am a local guy... For an adjunct macro brew that is produced 100 miles west... I can run with genny cream. Not bad!"
"D: Pretty low ABV, so it is session able but not that much going on.... not bad but not great."
"T: This was just a one time try type of thing, I probably will never have this beer again. Not to much taste or refreshing."
"For the price of this beer it isn't a bad choice but certainly not my favorite, if you are looking for something differennt to your normal beer and are short on cash this couod be a alright one to try"
"I got through the rest of the can without any problem so the drinkability is there if you're into this sort of thing. If given limited options I might grab this again. The price is certainly right."
"The mouthfeel can be the most important part of a beer, and this beer was lacking. Which leads to what I think causes the best drink-ability. If you can enjoy the mouthfeel, its drink-ability will be consistent. I drank it quickly, wanting nothing more then to get it out of the glass so I could poor a Sweetwater IPA."
"I really enjoy finding a cheap beer with this much character, at least get it a try, I am glad I did!"
"Feel is full with a pleasant carbonation and a feel of sweetness that isn't really there. Thus the creaminess though the style is a bit aside. An enjoyable brew actually, a bit sweet when flat, a bit of intriging grain otherwise."
"Pours a pale yellowish color with a white head and some decent lacing. Smells creamy and malty and somewhat old. Tastes of cream of wheat, and mild malt. Too sweet. Mouthfeel is nice and drinkability is quite good."
"I bought this because 24 ounce cans from this brewery were 5 for $5 at my local beer store. For the price, you really can't do much better."
"Refreshing beer. I won't fo out of my way to get another, but a six pack is wonderful on a hot summer day."
"Pours a very clear yellow color with a fluffy 2 finger head and leaving nice lacing. Typical American adjunct and Munich helles lager appearance. The aroma is sweet malts with some fresh grassy notes. Not hop aromas, maybe a slight bitterness on the nose. The flavor has a bitterness that doesn't suggest creaminess to me. Overall is comparable to a regular American adjunct lager. I am not sure if this is a blend but it has that lager mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. What this beer lacks is a lightness that makes this easy to put a couple away. May e it's from the ingredients, I don't know, but I do like this better than the typical bmc products out there."
"12oz bottle picked up in a mixed sixer from Total Wine. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a super clear pale gold with a small white head on top. Wisps of lace stick behind. Scents of butter, apples, and honey. Pretty mellow. Mouth is a little on the thin side, but for the style and brewer, I guess that's not all that surprising. Mild carbonation. Pretty sweet cream ale. Starts out with a bit of honey, pale fruits, and grains. Low bitterness. Not a bad beer to be had at cookouts or campouts, or even some tailgating. Refreshing, simple beer."
"m+d- this is a refreshing beer. much like water, but it's beer."
"D - Very drinkable beer, as most adjunct lagers are. Genesee Cream Ale is very similar to Pabst Blue Ribbon in my opinion. Both beers are poked fun at, but if you compare them to the standard BMCs, they are clearly better, and even cheaper."
"T: While not the best beer in the world, good for what it is. Would drink this over BMC any day. Glad to see it made it's way up to Maine"
"D: Wouldn't reach for this one again because there isn't much to actually enjoy for me."
"Taste is light, creamy grain and apple with grass, sweetish with a slight ale-like yeasty zing that is a faint hint that this is something other than a pale lager. It has a rather ""creamy"" frothy feel to it. It has some creamy grain aftertaste, though light. Though simple, what character it has is reasonably firm and it's very pleasant."
"For a cream ale it is drinkable, especially on a hot and humid day. Will be retired for the winter."
"D: You can pick up a 30 rack of this for the same price as a four pack of DFH Burton Baton. When the money is tight, this beats a lot of cheap beer, and is very drinkable."
"Not a stunner by any means, but certainly not terrible. That's all she wrote."
"Overall for a quick adjunct, it's not the worst I had, and on a hot summer day, it would be drinkable!"
"All in all, this is a dressed-up version of your typical macro. If it was available in my area, I'd always buy it over the macro alternatives."
"SkÅL!"
"Nostalgia aside, this isn't a particularly good beer unless its cold. It really gets dextriny and cloying sweet when it even starts to settle. The beer has a really processed feel to it. The beer pours a light pale yellow color with a creamy head that doesn't retain at all. The beer is plenty carbonated with a nose that has a processed corn adjunct aroma, some malty sweetness and some herbal grassy qualities. Interestingly, the sharp edges in the nose actually level out and it becomes quite nice once it settles, which is just the opposite or what happens with its taste. Once the beer warms even a little, the beer takes on some very nasty qualities, lots of dextriny adjunct processed grainy qualities, and is indicative of the quality, or lack of it, underlying the beer. Drink it while its cold."
"Same goes for taste. What I like about this that the adjunct lagers don't have is a crisper flavor. That is, the malt isn't stale, the corn isn't strong. A light flavor all around with a touch of dryness in the end. Served colder this one would be ok in a pinch."
"Genesee Cream Ale pours a clear light gold with a frothy head that doesn't linger too long. The aroma is grainy with some sweet corn like maltiness. The flavor is light sweet malt with some faint fruity esters that linger in the aftertaste. No real bitterness or hop character to speak of. Overall considering the price of the beer, it's not terrible, one of the better values out there."
"This is a ""whaddyawant?"" kind of beer. Yes, it's weak, but it's got a little flavor & it is what it is. I've had better ""traditional American"" offerings. At the very least I can say it's a slight alternative to typical macro lagers, but only veeery slight. A decent barbecue beer, one to put away a few of if there's nothing else."
"Pours pale straw yellow with virtually no lasting head , medium carbonation. Aroma smells sweet more than anything else with hints of graininess and floral hops. Flavor sweet too, with something tasting like honey dominating, with hints of adjunct and malt flavor, as well slight amounts of floral hops and grain bitterness on the finish. Thin to medium in body , drinkable but , meh"
"Genny Cream---this brew goes back a long way with me. My grandfather used to drink the pony cans/bottles when I was a kid. Remeber the taste well. Just had one last night for first time in maybe 20 years?!? You know, not bad at all. Still has a bit of an distinct, creamy flavor and feel. Def more medium bodied that a typical inexpensive brew. For $4.50 a six-pack, its worth a try. Plus, it brought back some fond memories and that's priceless."
"Never had a Cream Ale before so it is difficult to rate to style. Does have a similar flavor profile of an adjunct lager, although this is certainly better than BMC. However, looking at a list of other Cream Ales makes me think there are going to be many others better than this in the category."
"Well, a hot day would suit this fine, or if you were just using this to wash down food. I will take this any day of the week over Bud or Bud Light. Flawed, a bit too weak, and some elements that don't really work, but still no where near a drainpour. Paid $0.95 for a tall boy can. One of the better cheap beers you can get."
"D - Not terrible for the price you pay (I've seen it go for as low as $14.99 for a 30-rack) Drinkability is certainly there that doesn't sacrifice a somewhat prevalent flavor and body."
"D: Ya' know, it's not as horrendous as I remember it - perhaps even a bit above average as far as run of the mill macro beers go. I won't be buying 30 racks of Genny Cream Ale anytime soon, but I may look for a can the next time I'm at a college party."
"This is a very drinkable beer even though it is not the best I have had. I could see drinking a few of these, and as we all know - the more you drink, the better they get. I like this beer, just not a favorite."
"its pretty drinkable but will probably not pick this up again"
"Feel/Drink: Cream mouthfeel, high carbonation. Great drinkability. For less than $13 a 30pk this may be my go-to cheap beer."
"D- Not the best cream ale out there, but it's not bad. I don't know if it would be sessionable or not though."
"D: One of the classic old school beers. Not very exciting, but not off putting either. Very much a neither here nor there beer in my book."
"I found a sixer of this at Whibey Beer works recently and had to buy it. I grew up on Genesee beers and have never seen them west of the Mississippi River. i have no idea how this beer git here or how it was handled. I'm mostly entering this just to add it to my list. I'm just giving an average score until I try a fresh one on my next trip home. Drinkability gets a 5 only because I used to drink so much of this stuff, I've got to give props to my homie."
"Notes: This is a regional beer from upstate NY. This was my first time trying this beer, and although it wasn't great, this is a lawnmower beer that is not made by InBev; and at $14.99 a 30 pack, it wont break any bank."
"The mouthfeel is good and it is very drinkable. I really like this beer. I bought it in a six pack of 16 ounce cans for $2.99. This is a great value. I will definitely by a few more of these sixers this summer."
"Ahh..the 1st beer I got drunk on...in the EARLY 80's, makes me wonder why I stopped drinking it, A good stand by when I can't get some Micro or import ( which happens a lot in Conneaut Ohio) smooth easy drinking, and cheap here in Ohio. better than the rest of the BMC corn piss that is out there. Good to see Genesee got it's name back."
"""Always ask for Jenny"""
"Notes: This is along the lines of a premium adjunct lager in my opinion. The flavors aren't great, but there is actually some hop presence. The mouthfeel also helps to improve it overall."
"Poured to a finger of fluffy white head. Color is clear golden yellow...dissimilar from most macros in that it is more golden than the typical straw yellow. Smell is very sweet. Oddly enough, the taste didn't represent the sweet smell. I can't believe I'm saying this, but you can actually tell hops lies within this beer. It's very faint but still there. Great feel in the mouth and going down. This is a good macro."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"I would say the reviews about this beer are fairly on point. My local beer distributor has it on sale for around $13.50 for a 30 pack, so you really cant beat that. Me being 21 years old, the man working there always says im too young for genesse cream ale and that gives me a laugh. I enjoy everything about it except for the metallic taste it leaves in your mouth. But for the price i would put up with a lot worse."
"Drinkability: This is a beer I remember my neighbor drinking while growing up....found it relatively cheap, I figured I'd give it a shot. This is certainly not worth the beer medals it claims to have won, but honestly I wouldn't turn this down."
"Affordability and availability make this beer drinkable but not very good."
"Drinkability: No."
"The taste and mouthfeel are better than normal adjuncts, though. Although still grainy and a bit acrid, it has a sweeter aspect in the finish and a smoother, creamier mouthfeel compared to typical widely distributed adjunct lagers. Because of this, the drinkability, at least for me, goes op a few notches. I'd take this over most other cheap beers any day."
"D - I don't like it. Not too sure I'll even drink this whole sixer."
"T- Has a sourish, malt taste. Smooth, yet has some carbonation. Too American marcro, but not horrible, either."
"D: I'm sure there are many who session the Genny on the regular, but they're also likely to be in their 60s and 70s at this point. Won;t do any harm for what it is; a cheap macro guzzler with a bit of street cred to it. Has an old school feel and a modern, largely inoffensive chugging lager flavor."
"I've had it in a bottle, Wegmans in Dewitt, NY once sold 12 pack bottles, and this was my favourite budget beer. It looks like your average macro product, with its white head and golden body, and may smell like a macro, but its got a sweet sugar cookie taste. The mouthfeel is better than usual; overall, its a drinkable beer."
"Poured from a 12 ounce can into glass. Even with a slow pour it yielded 4 fingers of foamy head. Lots of carbonated bubbles still coming to the top. Basic yellow/golden beer color. Smells of corn and cooked rice. Smooth flavor nothing really sticks out but basic malted brew flavor more corn/rice. Mouthfeel is nothing special, somewhat watery. Very drinkable in that it is very smooth and nothing offensively harsh."
"Not a beer I'd go far and wide to seek out but if it was this over any other macro (except for Rainier or Olympia) I'd still go with this one."
"D: Genny Cream Ale has quickly become one of my favorite budget-brews. It is far more interesting than any other beer I've had at its price point. Perfect for the poor college crowd."
"D- If I am going to put down a bunch of light beers, I have no problem grabbing some Genny over some BMC. There probably is a little nostalgia too, as I spent some time in WNY & Rachacha."
"It's deceptively light at first but ends up having more character that you'd expect from a macro. Despite being full of adjuncts flavor and almost devoid of hops this is a good standby for when you need a simple beer to gulp down."
"This is an absolute steal at about $7 per 12-pack. It's a staple party beer, but it's also satisfying when you want to just kick back. It's a sleeper."
"As in a previous review I agree that it appeals to many every day beer drinkers. It has a very nice head with an exceptional color of amber. Goes down very smooth. I picked up a 30 pack @ Consumers Beer Depot in Milwaukee. Wish I would have purchased 3 or 4 @11.99."
"I remember my Uncles drinking Genny Cream Ale when I was a kid. Now that I'm ""of age", I've sampled it myself. Good, thick head. Dark yellow color. Smell is a little sweet but not too strong. Taste is OK, not exceptional, not bad. It's a drinkable ale geared toward pleasing a lot of people, not necessarily the discerning beer palate."
"Frothy pure white head, loosely gathered foam that reaches two fingers on the pour and settles into a thin, steady layer across the surface, no lacing. Light yellow to orange color, while not deep has a lot of brightness. Rye and country brown bread, honey, sweet corn and malt make for a generously full nose, soft on the whole with a firming metallic streak. Medium-bodied, holds its weight throughout and possessed of a steady, masculine carbonation. Honey notes, yeast and malt give it that sweet creaminess, no lack of corn and grain too. The hoppiness is there, more to sculpt and lightly dry than lend true bite. Apricot, strawberry, pear fruit. The metallic element less of a presence here. Even as it warms some, doesn't piss you off. The kind of beer childhoods are made of."
"Overall, a great 30-pack selection, one of the best for the pricepoint and quality. 5.10% abv is a nice medium also."
"An underappreciated beer. I challenge anyone to find a better tasting beer for the price. It tastes good and goes well with the standard beer snacks or with a meal from the grill. Refreshing taste that is not overwhelming yet not watered down. My friend enjoyed it too."
"My first cream ale and I have to admit it exceeded my expectations. A bit more flavorful than an adjunct lager yet just as refreshing. A good option for the price."
"If you are into an easy drinking light tasting beer this is a good alternative to Budweiser, Coors, and Miller"
"A great beer to have on hand -- not boring, better (and less expensive) than Bud, easy to drink, a conversation starter. It won't blow your skirt up but it's good to know about."
"The taste is a bit better with a sweet malty flavor with perhaps a bit of corn adjuncts in there. A few notes of sulfur and a bit of floral hop flavor and bitterness. It does have a fairly 'creamy' feeling on the palate, which is nice, but then there is also a macro-like metallic taste that is not good. Not a bad beer, and at the decent price tag, I would choose this over a Bud anytime."
"appearnce is standard yello macro. lifeless. almost no head, no lacing at all. smell is also typicial of an american macro, plus an addition of something rotting on the tail end. taste starts off like an american adjuct macro, rice/corn.... but finished slightly skunky and stale tasting. is this a bad bottle? mouthfeel is hard to describe but terrible. watery and a strange low carbonation. drinkability.... not a drain pour but i was suffering threw all 12 ozs"
"Take it for what it is, I guess."
"D - it's drinkable, but not for long. the taste gets to me after beer #2...the metallic aftertaste is a bit over the top. the carbonation is in the way. it's not horrible, but not better than average either. right there with the macros. i will not be purchasing this again. one is enough..."
"I truly do not think this brew deserves all of the lack-luster reviews it gets. I defy anyone to find a better ale for $11.99/30 pack. Yep, that's right....this one is currently selling at Sam The Beer Man in Binghamton @ $12 for 30 cans. Unfortunately in these times, the budget often dictates my choice at Sam's. But having said that, sometimes I grab these even when I can afford more. Far superior to all of the other choices at this price, and the flavor and drinkability are well above average. With the 5.10 abv, these can surely get the job done, but are also perfect for that saturday afternoon bbq. All in all, a very nice everyday brew that never disappoints. Just ice 'em down and let 'em flow!!"
"I'd probably have this beer again, especially for the price. Quite a pleasant surprise."
"Good drinkability"
"First off, this beer was not as bad as I expected. I went into this brew with very low expectations and was surprised by how quickly it was able to rise to unimpressive status. Appearance is golden with almost no head. Little to no lacing is apparent as you force down this incredibley below average brew. The finish leaves you with a hollow feeling, almost guilty that you subjected your body to this experience. If money is no object, and this type of beer is your thing, you would do well to spend the extra $2.00 and grab some Labatts."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The sharp, cutting carbonation runs amok with miniscule bubbles, ripping the tongue before smoothing out and going down much better. Aside from the pleasant nose and initial flavor right at the outset, there wasn't much to enjoy going forward."
"For the money a good picnic/barbeque or lawnmower beer"
"From a 12 oz. can. Pours a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is very mild, slightly malty. Taste is of malts with some cream, a slight sweetness, not a bad flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall not a bad choice considering the low price tag."
"Notes - Pretty drinkable."
"Out of a forty ounce bottle this beer was a golden color with a billowing, three-finger, off-white head. The retention was pretty good and the lacing impressive in curtains and then bands. The aroma was of macro grains, stale malt, alcohol and a little sourness. Standard malt liquor smell. The flavors were actually pretty good for the style, corn, grain mash, pale malt, a touch of sweet malts (the 'cream') and a crisp finish with a very low hop profile. The alcohol was present, but better hidden than in most malt liquors. Dry, acidic and simple. The mouthfeel was not bad, the body medium and the carbonation medium/high. A total get-F-ed-up beer. But not a bad one."
"Okay I need a change of pace here. Been drinking pbr and high life for a while, but the act is tired. Lord chesterfield is a cheap pale ale, but the flavor gets more unsatisfying after a few. Stroh's is gross. Schaeffer, bud, coors extra gold et. al. are too similar and when I spied the genny section my gloomy outlook changed. Okay so in the end its similar to the rest, but the can is mostly green !GREEN! and it has won an assload of beer medals and its a cream ale for crying out loud! Appearance-wise it has the familiar macro-ish straw yellow pour with a fizzy white head, clear with some bubbles but not a whole lot going on. In the glass the creamy nature (mental or no) is lost so the rest of my review is canned. It smells like aluminum, with weaker scents of corn and grass. This tastes corny, but has malty sweetness as well. No DMS sweetness like high life, slightly bitter at the end and dare I say, balanced? Mouthfeel is medium, good carbonation level and creamy. I can drink six or nine of these without boredom so my issue is solved, if only temporarily."
"D- Why not?"
"D- Drink away. This stuff is an awesome beer for the budget."
"value in a sweet beer!"
"this beer i have had in a can, bottle and draft, all have been great, this beer is not loved by many, but its hard to find and when i do i buy alot, love the stuff, awsome lawnmower beer!!!!, it must be cold our it imparts a somewhat sour taste, but overall good taste,"
"D 4.5 - This was a big surprise to me that I have never had this, and that it was so enjoyable for $4 a six pack. It even has 5.1 ABV, surprised indeed. This is a great budget beer."
"Better than most BMC macros, but not terribly memorable."
"Tastes like the epitome of a decent macro. Sweet grain, hints of corn, balanced by light flower hops. The creaminess is creamy, not slimey, and it goes down smooth."
"Got this at a drug store, and to my surprise they had a price error, the whole 30 pack cost just $3.99+ thank you for your error it tasted better knowing I just got a Super deal ;)"
"I remember this being more drinkable than I find it to be now. This time, I found a lot of fruity qualities that turned me off, and while that added some complexity, it wasn't what I was looking for when."
"Genny Cream may be the benchmark, but I wouldn't call it the best. Still, it is a fairly pleasant and innocuous quencher with more flavor than your average industrial American lager. OK."
"D: Very easy to drink. Not the greatest flavor, not complex but fairly balanced."
"As this warmed up it got more and more difficult to have another swig. It went down ok cold, but I wouldn't want to actually taste all of it's characteristics as the don't gel. I didn't get a ""cream"" sense from this at all. Maybe it would be more chuggable than other such offerings, but why bother?"
"If you drink this out of the can and don't have to look at it or smell it, it is not bad. As good as any other macro. Pretty smooth, creamy mouthfeel, a bit of crispy dryness after the sips. Very little head on the pour, and clear looking with not much texture. But you can drink a bunch of these while gardening!"
"Light to medium body with a definite creaminess to it and no alcohol detected anywhere make this brew easy enough to drink, but overall a beer that's average at best."
"mnn moonies. a regional pale beer that has some gas with the hipster retro market. straw color with a 2cm fluffy white head that dissapated at a reasonable rate. not much flavor, this is a beer pong beer, a baseball beer, a mow the lawn beer. slightly more flavor then bmc, but just barely. lots of corn and pilsner malt with some hop bitterness and aroma. not great but its a fun memory of home."
"Notes: excellent beer to bridge the gap from lagers to ales. does just what the style is intended to do. really prepares you to experience the different flavors ale yeast offers."
"Hard to believe but I found some Jenny Cream here near Seattle and in a bottle so I had to buy one. From my home town of Rochester comes one of the few American origin styles, cream ale. In Rochester there's one of the few major river's that flows north and to this day, Jenny Cream pretty much still smells much like that ol'river too. The head is there, then gone. The first sip is sweet and a bit creamy in mouthfeel. Is there hops in here? The rancid sugary aftertaste coats the mouth and leaves one wanting a glass of clean water. Drink too much, you'll be on the toilet for most the next day cursing the brewers."
"Drinkability: Better than most of its ilk, in that, while it lacked anything to stand up and cheer about, it also lacked any inherent ickiness or ghastly off-flavors."
"Pours a golden yellow colored body, with a foamy white head. Has a lagery aroma, with some banana, and some dustiness. Has a somewhat nutty taste, with a nice malty aftertaste. Cleanish tasting. Has a pretty light taste."
"Bought a 30 of this for $10.99. Pours a light golden color, not much head to it but a decent amount of lacing and thousands of bubbles racing up to the top of the beer. Taste is very macro tasting.. but smoother. Finish is clean and crisp and has a pretty good body to it. Not the most glamorous style but it's worked for them for years and it's pretty damn drinkable. For about $0.33 a beer this is a great bargain and a great cheap beer. Wouldn't have all the time but for some beer pong or a big party.. this is my beer of choice."
"Ultimately, I'm not going out of the way for the beer, but if it is offered I'll not pass it up."
"D: A little bit tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, good representation of style, it might not be the greatest beer overall, but in being a poundable fizzy-yellow-beer it fits its role quite well."
"i thought i would try this one, as it is kind of a staple beer in my home town. it pours a very clear straw yellow color. a nice white head that fades to absolutely nothing. the only thing i get in the nose is a kind of yeasty smell, almost a belgian yeast smell. the taste is actually quite refreshing, this would be a great beer for after mowing the lawn in summer or something. its not too watery as i thought or as the appearence would suggest. a lot of that yeast comes through in the taste as well. fairly light body. this is definately a very drinkable beer though, its not great, but its better than all the other macros. and for $3.50 a six pack you really cant go wrong. i will definately purchase this again next time im broke."
"Its light and drinkable, and a solid alternative to some macros."
"Appearance is crystal clear straw gold with a tight white head. Aroma has some faint corn-flake like malt but little hop aroma. Taste has the same corn-flake like malt with faint lemon-drop fruity esters. Medium low hop flavor and bitterness. Very clean and well-attenuated beer, but decent enough flavor and mouthfeel to remind you that this is an ale and not a lager. Great alternative to the big 3 lagers."
"D: This is better than a lot of other macros in its price range, although having gone through most of a case, I still can't say why exactly. I consider this to be like 125% of your standard macro - both good and bad. It's stronger and more flavorful, for what it's worth. I'll probably pick this up in the future when I want something dirt cheap but somewhat substantial."
"transparent straw color with a fading head that smells of sweet grain and not much else. Taste is a tad more impressive as it give a kiss of hops in the back but the biscuit, crystal malt lingers on the mouth too long - and yet leds a creaminess that is memorable but not enough to recall the entire experience. lackluster and move on"
"Overall - A very drinkable beer. For $3.50/6 pack you can't go wrong. Taste is a bit light but the carbonation holds it together well. The best brew by Genesee."
"D - Not too bad of a brew but nothing to get excited over. An easy session beer but there are better choices out there."
"This brew fits the cream ale profile well. Flavor is unified, mild and sweet."
"A decent cream ale, nothing to get excited about but better than I would have guessed."
" I gotta tell ya, I can drink this stuff!"
"Its a great mixture between an ale and a stout feel. Its this great hybrid. Its light yet thick, Its bitter yet sweet. The mixture of flavors in this beer makes it a great combination, and a great beer"
"(rated May 30, 2007)"
"A decent creamy body for a light beer. Make sure you drink this cold. It would be decent if it were just a light lager, but not quite average."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer is light in body and finishes dry. Carbonation is not as high as the apperance would lead you to believe. The beer has a nice feel to it. It is easy to drink and is quite smooth. I feel that this beer feels just as it should. This is one I'll probably most likely drink again...just because its not a bad beer and its cheap. However, it wouldn't be my first choice of beer at any time, its just that its a pretty cheap beer and for the money its not bad. Not really a craft beer, and really not all that great, but it is one of the better things in that price range. Average drinkability, not something that screams ""Come back to me!"" but it is always an option when going cheap... Its just that the can is so ugly that it makes it kinda hard to drink...especially on a hot day, I don't think that this is quite what you're looking for."
"Mouthfeel is light, and the ABV and drinkability make this one a top-notch lawnmower beer."
"D: This is better than most macros. I wasn't expecting a lot but a clean, crisp beer that is quite cheap."
"I don't really mind Genny products and this is no different. Very easy to put down. They're also incredibly cheap but a lot better than the BMC alternatives."
"Pours a light golden yellow with lots of carbonation racing up to form a white fluffy head. The head disappears fast leaving a layer of thin lace. A sweet aroma full of fruit and grain. A light bodied beer that has a little crispness. A little bit of lemony hops and sugary malts. Then a husky finish thats a little sour."
"D: Locked in a room, forced to drink it, I definitely could -- although it would not be my first choice."
"For the price and the style, this is a worthy brew. For many, it just rehashes college memories. I busted out a sixer with a few guys that hadn't drank it since the 80's."
"Notes: This is not a high standard for the style.Despite not being a top notch,above average cream ale I feel it serves a purpose.It's good for barbecues and just fine to start off the day.A light beer and and not offensive at all.I have had much better,yet this was o.k."
"One thing that did not change was its head. I got a finger's worth of thick, foamy, bone-white head that resembled marshmallow Fluf until it began to settle down into a wispy white film. The color was also very familiar - a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose was much sweeter than I had remembered and it also had a sharp alcohol scent under the basic sweetness. The mouthfeel was medium with a sweet, grainy flavor on the tongue. The finish remained sweet and with a lingering vegetable flavor. I am not as in love with it as I used to be. How sad."
"Notes: If retro beer is your thing, Genesee Cream Ale could be the next Pabst Blue Ribbon. Also noteworthy is that Genesee Cream Ale has won ten major medals at the Great American Beer Festival and World Beer Cup."
"D: A decent lawnmower beer and the ABV is conducive to pounding a few. To tell you the truth I really like this better straight out of the can. If this were a macro lager, I would probably give it higher marks but I have had far better cream ales. I'd keep this in my hot summer day macro rotation."
"D: This is a good session brew. Nothing amazing but it goes down easy and has some flavor to it over typical macros. Not too bad."
"this one is one of the first beers that i liked, i have notaced that i like bottles better than cans but when you have some unexpected bills come up, this one is cheep and good in a pinch, around ths is me rochester ny area ware this is made you can get a 30 pack for 15-17 bucks. this is clean and crisp and verry drinkable, i think every one should try this once."
"For $2.99 a six pack, I had to give it a whirl..."
"A very unoffensive beer with a decent taste."
"I've had this many years ago out of the bottle, came across it the other day at the grocery store so I picked up a twelve pack of cans. Solid beer, much better than I remember. Pours a golden yellow, slightly darker than most of the BMC's. Creamy head that quickly leaves (too soon in myh opinion), adequate carbonation and no lacing. The aroma doesn't grab my attention, I can detect some decent maltiness along with a weak grain afterscent. The mouthfeel is rather pleasant, it is full and creamy. The nice mouthfeel leads me into an exceptionally pleasant taste. I am surprised, although not outstanding the flavor of this beer is mild and enjoyable. There is a nice maltiness that keeps my attention. Smooth finish and no unpleasant aftertaste. I don't want to call this swill, but it appears to be marketed as such. For the price this is one beer that I will consider keeping stocked in my fridge, another surprising find among the beers found along the bottom shelves."
"If I'm stranded in a convenience store in upstate New York, I won't fret as much as I once thought."
"Drinkability is top notch. A six pack of this goes really quickly, so ya gotta be careful or you'll run out quick!"
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Medium head on a very light yellow body. Smell and taste were unremarkable, but decent enough for it to be a good everyday beer. Reminded me of a ""big brewer"" lager, which is to say, not bad. Against other cream ale's, like Spotted Cow, it's not anywhere close."
"Not terrible (see Coors Light) but overall it is only a slight step up from any BMC and should be treated accordingly. To end on a positive note, at least it's not made entirely from corn or rice."
"A tad darker then most pale golden beers. Huge fluffy head though it fades right away. Beery sort of smell-somewhat of a metallic grain aroma. Actually has a slight hop aroma. Decent macro flavor-just a hint of sweet malt flavor with a slight hop bite. Decent body-feels like a lager though it must be an ale. Very crisp and dry in the finish. I have loved this since I was about 16. Not as ""special"" as it seemed way back then but a decent enough ""summer"" beer at a great price."
"MF&D - I would drink Genny over Bud, Coors or Miller any day. A good old school thirst quecher."
"A thinnish, yellowish discharge of a pour with a medicinal and aluminumish smell. Not exactly a tasty beer, but medium-bodied and goes down real smooth and creamy. Not much flavor packed in the hops, and no real maltiness either. But it is an easy beer to drink, which is more than I can say for other cheap fare."
"Okay so I got this at a bar for $1.50, maybe that's why I enjoyed it. Well it was creamy but still watery, bready, yeasty, very little hop presence (if any at all). Couldn't smell it or pour it from my bottle to look at it. But it was rather drinkable. Sweet, not too sweet, just well... creamy in taste but not in mouthfeel... but not too overwhelming in any respect. If you can get it for $1.50 at a decent bar then I would suggest that you do the same and try it."
"Poured a slightly hazy gold color with very little head. Smells of butterscotch and apple cider vinegar. Tastes of lemon, lightly toasted malt, butter, and apples with a sweet bitter acidic finish. Light in body with low carbonation, smooth and creamy with good fruit and butter flavors. Pretty refreshing and easy to drink, goes great with wings."
"Pours out a very light golden color with a large head(after a hard pour) that dissapates rather quickly to a fine lacing. Smell? not much of any smell detected. Mouth-feel is OK and taste is rather watery. I guess I was expecting more from this brew given all the awards it has won.(they are all listed on the packaging) To me it isn't much different than PBR,Budweiser,or MGD only a little higher priced here in IA."
"Tastes an awful lot like a typical MGD Macro style with a little bit more flavor. Eh...for the same price I can get a decent Micro..."
"Pours a pale yellow color and hold a weak light beige head. The nose and taste remind more of a cheap lager than a cream ale. There are old grassy grains anb mildly bitter hops. The taste has bit of sweet creamy malt, but not much. The medium body is quite smooth and definately helps the drinkability."
"This is the only cream ale I've had, but for the price it's pretty good. It kind of tastes like a cross between high life and cream soda to me. I'm definitely adding this to my list of go to cheap beers (along with high life and PBR)."
"Well from being upstate Genesee beers have been around me for years. From remembering it being drunk by grown ups at parties when younger to my grand father having it in is fridge in Rochester. Now we all have joked quite a bit about Genesee beer, but for what it is, more or less a macro brew, IMO it is not a bad beer. The Cream ale is not a bad brew for a warm day when you do not want everything to be about the hops. It has an easy drinking quality to it. The brew pours to a somewhat deep yellow color with a good sized white head that loses its structure pretty quickly but holds a sheet of white that leaves some good lacing. The aroma is very subtle all around, mostly grain like malt scent, slight roast and maybe the presence of hops. The flavor has a sweetness to it from the malt, has a creamy feel, slight corn like flavor seems to come out towards the back end. Overall this is not a great brew, but I will admit that I do pick this up from time to time to have as a throw in brew when drinking with friends. Also has some sentimental value for me."
"This is no Belgian Lambic or anything, but I like this beer for what it is. I think its at the top of the class of brews that you drink in large quantities at parties (like Miller High Life, PBR etc.) It has a solid, creamy taste, a decent mouthfeel and is extremely drinkable and refreshing (it's also very cheap!). Too bad I have to drive all the way to Buffalo to get it."
"This is a easy to drink beer, but not complicated at all. Hops are not very detectable, and again, it tastes pretty thin. I wouldn't keep a 6-pk of this in my house, but wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"After watching a guy buy eight cases of this stuff I figured either he is trying to nourish a bunch of starving orphans for cheap (and it is cheap for 12 bucks a case!) or he really likes the stuff. I bought a bottle and tried it out. Pours a pale yellow with little bubbles everywhere. Smells of on hop bud and one malt grain swimming around. Tastes mildly malty with a breath of hops. Too carbonated for a cream ale I think."
"Mouthfeel is relatively light and rather lively with the abundant carbonation. The bubbles aren't quite as bad as soda-pop but they are rather persistent. The swallow is relatively smooth and, combined with the quick finish, is very easy to drink. Sorry, Honey, but this one is pretty average to me."
"This is a solid brew, but not one I'd hunt for; but I wouldn't turn it down. A step above most adjunct macro brews as it does not become undrinkable if it warms a bit. Solid for barbecues and summer days."
"This is the kind of beer I could drink a lot of in an evening. It's meant to be served out of the bottle, and I had no problem getting through a few of them. I would guess this would be a hit with non-BAs, as it has about the intensity of a macro, but a better flavor, without being too foreign. The scores aren't going to make this look too great, but it hits the mark for what it is (and for the price). If the cost stays low I'll buy it again. I can't drink Chimay every night."
"It's basically an American Light Lager with a bit slicker feel. I suppose this is cheaper on the East Coast, but here on the West Coast it's the same cost as Sam Adams. This was my first Cream Ale and I'm rather disappointed; might as well have just grabbed a Michelob. Hopefully others in this style are better."
"A golden pour into a frosty pint glass, the taste is clean with a sweet finish. Good carbonation, good mouth feel, great drinkability. I'd recommend this beer to anyone on a cold winter evening or a hot summer afternoon."
"Typical macro lager color with a decent head that quickly fades.Taste is sweet florals and malt,aroma is what smells like corn or cooked veggies.This is one of those beers that you're not gonna describe all of the complex characteristics of,yet it is an enjoyable non-offensive beer.I will buy this again and enjoy it in the summer months!!"
"Poured from a 12oz screw cap bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Poured aggressively, resulting in a 2 finger head of foam. Clear, light amber in color with lots of bubbles rising to the surface. Smelled slightly grassy/hay like, a touchy skunky and had a fruity quality as it warmed. Slightly sweet and fruity in taste with little to no flavor hop and low bitterness that lingered for a short time. It was fizzy and prickles the tongue with carbonation. The mouth feel was thin, appropriate for style. An easy drinking beer but not impressive overall."
"At $3.49-3.99 per six or $5.99 per 12 cans, its a no risk session beer. Not great, but not deserving of it's ""worst beer ever"" stigma. I do recommend bottles over cans if you can find them."
"D - A good beer. Nothing to write home about. Quite drinkable."
"Yeasty, metallic smell with a touch of malt perhaps, after a light golden pour with short to medium lived white head. Taste is very smooth, yet suitably carbonated and has a sweetish grainish corn or wheaty hearty flavor to it. Just a touch of bitterness, and enough to balance out the mild flavors. Tastes similar to a couple Kolsches I've had, such as Shiner Kolsch and Lawnmower. Aftertaste was there and was pleasant. This isn't going to be a fancy beer needing an acquired taste, but I thought it was very drinkable and enjoyable, especially after the 2 other beers I rated tonight which were debacles, and undrinkable."
"Maybe a decent economical choice in the spring or summer, but not a repeat brew for me."
"D - A very boring, but quite refreshing brew. This is one notch up from standard macro lagers, and macro lovers would like this beer for sure. I however, think that lack of complexity defeats the whole purpose of drinking craft beer. Nothing offends me about this beer, but there is nothing that I particularly like about it either. It's meh."
"Drinkability: I'm barely able to finish one. I can't think of anything it would go with. I can't imagine enjoying it during a ballgame. And I certainly can't picture myself enjoying it over the course of an evening at the bar."
"pours a golden color with a off white large head with a easy pour and some moderate lace. aromas are herbal with some fruityness. taste a little salty on the tip of the tongue moving to a creamy malt ending with a slight tangy or tartness. light bodied and well carbonated. used to drink a lot of genny cream ale and had to try it again and give it a review and found i still enjoy the taste."
"Not a bad macro beer, quaffable, but the sweetness would have me searching elsewhere for a better beer."
"D - Is pretty good easy to drink for a cheap beer its worth giving it a shot"
"From the can this brew pours a straw amber with a thin headskie. Good for a cheap beer. Sweet with good balance and mouthfeel. There is nothing at all special going on with this one, but it is easy to drink and easy on the pocketbooks so I won't knock it."
"Drinks pretty easy, I could do about 2-3 of these before moving on. Brings aback a few memories"
"It's an Upstate New york classic. Most kids can recognize this beer in a more familar setting: in their dad's hands while doing some sort of manly work. And at $5 a twelve pack, it shows how thrifty he was too. Genesee Cream Ale is going througha revival right now in Rochester, and deservedly so. This beer has a strong smell, but still sweet in the nostrils. The taste can be rough at first, but your pallet will adjust accordingly. It's not the best beer to sit down and take notes on, but on a warm summer's day, grab a Genny Cream Ale and go out and mow you lawn...it's what your dad would have done."
" Drinkability : After having one and getting use the aleyness of it I desided that I could drink some more of these. For some reason the first ones just rough for me."
"Overall: This beer was $4 a 6 pack so dont expect all to much. Knowing that this beer is still not all that great. The malt flavor is corny and stale with no hops at all. This is something you buy when you are broke and have no homebrew around. If you need to by this then I would suggest buying some rum or something else. I use to by this beer to go fishing all the time and never thought anything of it so I guess it goes well with fish and worms."
"Pours a golden color with a nice frothy head that holds up well. Aroma reminds me of a lager even though it's a cream ale. Taste is smooth and malty upfront with a creamy texture. Very much the taste of a lager but the body of an ale. I'm not quite sure what to expect as I've never had this style. However, I am impressed with the taste of this and would rate it well."
"Genny pours a pale straw with a mighty white head that disappears to nothing mighty fast. Nose is crystal malts and adjunct and a little skunk for good measure. Mellow, light flavor with slight whiff of hops at the finish and a clean departure. The mouthfeel is where the cream part comes in as it's smooth as a baby's bottom. These slide down like water; I could have gone 4.5 on mouthfeel if initial carbonation was a little more relaxed. Very easy to drink multiples as I've implied more than once. When slumming it, Genny and PBR are my two domestic faves."
"12oz can from Joka's in Waterville. Pours pale yellow with virtually no lasting head. Smells sweet more than anything else with hints of graininess and floral hops. Tastes sweet too, with something tasting like lactose dominating, with hints of adjunct and malt flavor, as well slight amounts of floral hops and grain bitterness on the finish. Thin to medium in body. Very drinkable. One sip definitely invites another. By no means the best beer in the world, nor the most complex, but a simple tasty beer. One of the best macro beers around, and a great value - 6.25$ per 12-pack!"
"This beer is unique. I thought maybe the bottle would be better, but it was worse than the can. As for the appearance, it looks like the average American macro lager. The nose is sweeter and the taste is sweet, as well. The mouthfeel is bitey. The drinkabliity was low for me. I just couldn't get past the ""cream"". Mission accomplished."
"'The Screamer"" as it's affectionately known locally, is not a bad beer. It pours light gold, with light head and a bit of lacing. It'ssmell is a bit light, but it goes down smooth. You don't reall get a malty or hoppy taste about it. It's slightly better tahn most macros out there."
"The blandest of the bland ales. It's hard to see why this warrants an entire style of its own."
"I love this beer"
"D: I was quite surprised, I wasn't expecting much, and I got a pretty decent beer. Probably not worth the $7.99 I paid for the sixer, but a good selection. A pretty nice beer, definitely a step above your average macro. To add after having a few, I'm still enjoying them, and they don't taste like shit when warm, I'm liking this."
" Overall, blah. This was one of the more forgettable beers I have ever had, and I have had some that are just downright wrong. I would actually rather have a macro than this, there just was really nothing redeeming at all here for me. Maybe it is just this one ale, and not the style, but this was about as bland as bland can beer. I will easily pass on this if it ever crosses my path again."
"p.s. ""Beer is proof that God loves man."" Ben Franklin"
"Picked up a single to try this one out. This is a beer that would be a good choice for a multiple beer session/alternative to the macros. That's probably why I've seen it in 40oz bottles."
"Light and crisp. Extremely refreshing with a surprisingly inoffensive taste. Great sessionability."
"This is not to say, of course, that Genny Cream Ale is in any way comparable to the more robust brews reviewed here; it is, however, a clear cut above the macro lagers found at a similar price point."
"I'd say it's a balanced beer, with just enough ""hop"" bitterness at the end to satisfy some of you hop-lovers...but doesn't stay on your tongue for too long, which I like. Very smooth and drinkable. I'd recommend it, especially for the price and good for a hot summer day. Plus, the ABV is over 5%, which isn't a bad thing either! Cheers, my friends!"
"to something better."
"Final Comments: When I went to my shop to pick this up today I was met by my beer guy who saw the 6 pack in my cart and asked what I was doing with that as it was far different then what I usually buy. I told him I had some friends on the east coast who suggested it and asked him what he knew about it, I'm glad I asked. He said that it was the first beer he ever had which surprised me so he told me the story.. ""When I was a kid in the early 70's my dad would get home from work and head to the front porch with a Genesee Cream in one hand and a cheap cigar in the other. One day when I was 9 or 10 I asked him what it tasted like and he said ""you tell me"" and gave me a sip. It's a memory I will never forget."" That pretty much summed up this beer for me, thanks for the recommendation guys."
"A decent offering. This on works well with any picnic food. A great choice to carry with you on the golf course on a hot day. Better then most of it's American lager counterparts for canned beer, save a few exceptions."
"Mouthfeel is dry and watery. The palate feels clean immediately but the aftertaste remains for quite a bit, imparting a cheap whiskey type feel. I am not sure I would recommend this. I would probably pick a typical macro like Bud over this, all stereotypes aside. Stylewise I suppose it is close, but I dont really like it. It was worth a try but this will be the last sixer I buy."
"Drinkability- Good I like this one with a restaurant burger."
"Big bubbly white head that disappears quickly. Pale yellow liquid with medium carbonation. The aroma is not pretty to me, have to say it was a bit like something related to a bathroom. The flavor was fortunately a solid improvement over the aroma. The immediate sense was that of the creamy, malty goodness that I recall from college days in the 70's. Genny Cream was really the definition of what I like about cream ales although I have come to learn that the style may typically bring heartier concoctions then that. This newer version does not deliver quite the same level of creaminess I admired during those dorm life years. There is a bit more alcohol presence and even a lemony taste at the finish. Though not much up to my nostalgic expectations, it was a drinkable selection with a little bit of creamy goodness. Generally weak in flavor and hard to get past the aroma. Different but not impressive."
"D: Goes down like water on a hot summer day."
"Well, it's a cheap ""lawn-mower"" beer, and rated as such. Good enough to bring to a place that allows can only and to beat the heat with. And, better than most BMC's. Still, not something I would look forward to."
"Drinkability is surprising, I would take this over a macro any day. Kind of a confusing style, but a good blend of flavor and lightness."
"The mouthfeel is creamy, light-bodied, somehwat crisp. A little citric bittnerhess in the finish. Fizzy, obvious alcohol, slightly oily. Grain aftertaste, gets worse as it warms. Not recommended."
"Not sure where the ""cream ale"" reference came from, but it was just another lager to me."
"D - This was pretty good. It was smooth like a lager but tasted more like an ale."
"Poured from a 12oz can to a pint glass. Straw yellow in color . Since i'm not that seasoned in smell of beer, to my untrained nose it smells like any other macro brew. But unlike other macro beers i have in the past(Miller, Coors, Old milwaukee, Keystone , and busch). taste wise it smooth , with a slight sweet after taste."
"Mouthfeel was that of a heavily filtered feel. Real wet and light and dried the tongue after. Just a touch of carbonation to tingle the tongue. Taste was not what I expected from a label saying ""cream ale"". The beer was strong when it hit the tongue and fades slowly and tastes of apple juice, and slightly bitter onion. It tastes like a Corona with an apple instead of a lime. Weird little creation."
"Straw colored and very clear. A bit more color than most macros, with a decent bead of foam. Starts out tasting like typical overcarbonated macro-corn-brau but then actual malt flavor makes an appearence. A little bit of grassy hop flavor too. When it's gone, the glass smalls like real beer instead of macrocrap. Not world class but certainly a few cuts above BMC. An excellent cheap refresher, if you don't expect too much. I could definitely slam a few after cutting and splitting firewood on a hot day. Not the best beer out there but maybe the most bang for the buck (12 bucks for a 30 pack, not including the 4.00 rebate)."
"12 oz. can with no freshness date. It pours a clear gold with medium carbonation and an inch of white head that leaves decent lacing. The aroma is lightly citric with hints of grass or hay and the flavor adds to this some sweetness, adjuncts and some light creaminess, but is overall pretty mild. It has a light body with almost tingly carbonation, and leaves a short finish. A fairly drinkable beer - a step up from BMC, but nothing special."
"Pours out a brass color with a thinnish head that stays put. Leaves some lacing. Really grainy macro aromas but with a ""kiss of the hops"" that reminds me of Schlitz. Flavor is rather malty and doesn't have that much of a grain presence which surprises me since it was all in the nose. Some crackery like flavors and a little bit of hops in the finish. Ends kind of dry. Mouthfeel is kind of thin and prickly, but that's what to expect. Solid drinker."
"Pours a pale straw yellow color with a small white head that laces the side of the glass. The aroma is a faint grainy malt smell and a just a hint of hops. The taste is a very clean tasting malty brew that is very easy to drink. Mouthfeel is light and crisp from the carbonation. Overall, this is lacking in the flavor department but is highly drinkable especially considering that it goes for under $4 a sixer."
"HOWEVER, as a homebrewer I would not mind being able to make a homebrew version of this beer, it would be a bit of a challenge and would impress American macro drinkers. And most of all, I could correct some of the mistakes that the Genesee brewers made! I believe I once saw a homebrew shop on the internet sell an ingredient kit for this beer. I might check it out."
"For the price, this is just about the best you can get. This beats out any other macro at any price. Excellent brew for the category."
"This beer is somewhat refreshing, but I could pick other beers that can do that which taste better as well. Apparently this one has been around for a while, but I don't feel like keeping it around."
"This lager pours gold in color with a medium soapy head. The light aroma of hops and light malts is present. Creamy without the associated sweetness; very smooth, velvety mouthfeel is light and a bit watery for my personal taste. Very easy drinkability due to its light and non-complex mix. Overall, this brew is a nice one for a hot summer day, though not complex enough to hold my interest."
"This ale has a superior drinkability to the other Genesee offerings (beer, light, red). However, The affiliate High Falls Brewing Co. has many more superior brews to sample."
"Overall an ok beer with a dryer mouthfeel that I counted on meaning I didn't find the creamy part of this beers name other than its a crisp, smooth beer."
"Light lager gold in color, this cream ale pours with a generous and dense frothy head. Subdued but nevertheless present aroma of soft hops and under roasted light malts. Creamy without the associated sweetness; very smooth, velvety mouthfeel and a taste somewhat reminiscent of Schlitz. EZ drinking and rewarding, this is a refreshing and enjoyable brew designed for daily multi-partaking consumption."
" It is a mild tasting brew but has a detectable presence of malt often missing from cheap beer and the 12th plastic cup goes down even easier than the first. I believe the legend of excessive flatulence production owes more to the quantities of Genny appropriately consumed and not any special charactericcs of the beer. Drink a couple of gallons of pretty much anything...."
"If I were throwing a large party and needed to provide libations for a lot of people but couldn't (or didn't want to) buy a pricier brew, I'd almost definitely purchase this before bud."
"Genny cream ale. This is the first beer I remember trying as a 12 year old impressionable youth, although I didn't think much of it at the time. Still, though, it is a slightly different change of pace compared to other macros. Appearance is similar (read: golden, clear, fizzy white head) as is aroma (smell: grass, corn). The flavor is sweet with only a faint hop presence, and a curious grainy aftertaste. Mouthfeel isn't any creamier, but it too is grainy FWIW. Drinkability is above average compared to the zero other cream ales I have sampled."
"12 oz bottle poured into a hefe glass. Clear straw yellow color. Active fizzy carbonation. White fizzy head with little retention. Smell has a lager-ish yeastiness and a malty sweetness. Not a whole lot of taste herE. What there is is sweet with a tiny little bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Strong carbonation, finishes dry. This is by no means a ""good"" beer, but it is very easy to drink."
"Pours golden. Thin white head, not much retention, but decent lacing. Smell is sweet,with maybe a hint of hops. Body is light,and carbonated. Taste is light, but smooth. Sweet, and creamy up front,with some hops in the finish. A good session beer. Worth a try."
"Genesee Cream Ale pours yellow with a white head from a twelve ounce can. Smells okay, better than I would expect. It does in fact have a somewhat creamy mouthfeel, compared to a macro lager. Taste is decent, nothing to get too excited about, but better than I expected. A reasonable alternative to drinking a macro lager at a reasonable price. I'd stick with the cans, I've had some bad bottles before. Worth a try."
"D: The price is a much touted factor is this Cream Ale's success and, truth be told, if I were hanging out with some college buddies and wanted a cheap 6, I wouldn't be surprised to go for this. $3-4 for a 6? It's not an instant classic ""beer of the Gods"" type brew, but it's got enough character and pleasant taste to be worth my time and money. I could easily go through a six of these myself, given how light it and inoffensive it is. It goes without saying that there's better, but this isn't BAD, it's just NOT good."
"For the cheap price, this beer is a bargain. When its around I'll never have to settle for an overly popular macro, but I wouldnt go out of my way to find this one. Its just nice to have decent beer available at an affordable price."
"Except for the lack of anything very interesting or exciting, this is the definition of a drinkable beer. Super cheap in 30-racks, creamy but not heavy mouthfeel, and a somewhat bland but not-at-all-gross taste. A top beer for parties where cheap swill is needed. Great job, High Falls, the micro-est of the macros."
"Cheers2Beers"
"The beer pours golden with a fizzy head that really wants to linger around but can't quite make it. Smell is almost all malt, with faint citrusy tinges if you really want to notice them. The taste and smell are very similar, and are not particularly memorable on their own. However, The creamy character of the style, combined with more-than-adequate carbonation, provide slightly more depth than your traditional macro, and are primarily what I feel set this beer aside from its other convenience store counterparts. I once saw an old Genesee Cream Ale poster with the tag line ""Not the Same Old Brewskie."" I agree."
"The last time I had a Genny Cream was around 1979. So its been awhile. Clear gold appearance, fluffy white bright head of about a minute's duration. Thin strings for lacing. A bit of a sharp aroma, slightly cheesy with cardboard and cheap characteristics. Light and airy mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation but works in its way. Tight flavor, mostly a corn sugary maltiness with little detectable hops and a pronounced fade. Clean brown sugar-tinged finish, odd ""Lemon Pledge", without a grainy impression. Its hard to imagine a much more drinkable simple beer and that's the main category where this beer seems to stand out a bit."
"D - Drinkable. Not a bad beer, but would not buy again though. When I first poured it, I thought it was a pilsner."
"Drinkability: For the price there are much better beers, but if it was cheap, and I was broke, why not?"
"Notes: blah blah blah....these adjunct tasting brews get really old. Why do I continue to buy them? as the blues brothers would say...""I'm on a mission from god""...all beers will be tasted...Amen."
"It doesn't hurt that it is less than $3.00 per six pack either."
"A very nice cheap beer. Inoffensive with some pleasant aspects. Around here you can find it for $1.50/pint at Clark's or $5.50 a 12-pack at the grocery store."
"Drinkability:Quite High. I love to squash theese any time of day or season. even tho the ratings here on beeradvocate do not favor well for the Old Genny...I myself love to drink them for the price and think it was time I wrote a favorable review in ""her"" defence!"
"Smooth and easy to drink. A step up from typical mass market brews but only a small step."
"This is my favorite 'I'm poor and can't afford better' beer. Laps other cheap beers by miles. The cream ale style is key here."
"Actually, it's better than I expected. I would drink this in a pinch."
"Drinkability- I have to admit a weakness for this beer as I drank way too much of it as a young juvenile delinquent. It really isn't that bad, especially when compared to crap like Bud Lite, Miller Lite, etc. Still, the only reason to drink this is to get a buzz."
"Those who live in their local distribution area are rather fortunate to have such an above-average beer for such an inexpensive price."
"This beer hits the style guidelines pretty well. I think it's under appreciated. Plus it's usually a real bargin."
"My first beer from High Falls. Pours out to a clear golden color with a 1/2 inch head and higher carbonation. Some notes of lacing in the glass. Not much smell, although some malt and light hops. Flavor is decent; some corn, grain, malt and hops, with a touch of sweetness overall and a zesty finish. Mouthfeel was fair; good carbonation and medium light body. Better than average drinkability, this beer would go good with a hot dog or bratwurst during a football game. And for the price, it's a deal. A good, macro made, cream ale."
"I'll spare the blast from the past reminiscences, but Genny Cream in 7 ounce bottles was a staple from my younger days. I had forgotten what it tastes like. For all I know, though, the flavor has been monkeyed around with several times over the years. In any case, this is an inexpensive, 'get what you pay for' kind of beer that is drinkable in a pinch. No one buys this stuff expecting Rochefort 10."
"Smooth and easy to drink. Decent macro-style cream ale."
"poured a medium amber color with monstrous white puffy that fell to a thin coating that lasted throughout the glass. Taste is light and refeshing with a slight dryness. Aftertaste is also a bit dry and makes you want more. Easy to drink. Not at all bad for a cheap beer."
"This beer is over carbonated and overall not impressive. It is a weak attempt at a cream with a bland flavor and definite macro impression. The aroma is mediocre with a grainy presence that dominates the beer as a whole. This one is no better than a american macro from st.louis or milwaukee."
"This stuff actually isn't bad for a macro. I'm not gonna lie, it stayed in the can, but I'll make an educated guess at the appearance: Light golden, almost yellow color, way too many bubbles, and a pretty non-existent head, unless you're getting it from a keg, in which half your cup would be a foamy mess. The taste actually is a little bit creamy, which I like. It's not just beer flavored water. Almost, but not quite. Definately some adjuncts in there however. Mouthfeel is actually fairly medium bodied for a macro, decent. Pretty easy to drink a bunch of these and not be totally offended by the taste. Definately a below average beers, but when you place it next to something like Bud or Coors, this one would be my pick. And they make a hell of a projectile..."
"The beer pours a pale yellow color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light pale malt scent that is a bit musty and dry, yet slightly sweet. The taste is average as well. It has a grainy pale malt flavor that is smooth and musty with a bit of sweetness in the finish. It has a dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. It isn't real flashy, but it goes down easy and is quite enjoyable."
"Genesee Cream Ale is a pale straw color with lots of carbonation. The head is a little below average in size and fairly creamy. Aroma is pretty weak, just a whiff of clean sweetness. The taste is average, a nice sweet malt flavor with a touch of grain is enough to keep Genesee Cream from sucking. Still, this is an uninteresting beer. This beer fares well as a relatively cheap (around $4.50 a sixer) lawnmower beer that has enough flavor to please my taste buds. This wins against the Buds, Millers, and Coors of the world any day."
"The drinkablilty of this brew is good. It is pretty easy going down."
"Poured a mid-golden, sudsy head with little retention, smell was husky, and grainy, taste followed, with some creaminess, mouthfeel was fairly creamy, and high carbonated, drinkability is average to low, on a hot day, maybe, ...but for enjoyment, not a good choice."
"Pours a brilliantly clear gold color. It is topped by a frothy thick off white head that sticks around a bit longer than I would expect. The aroma is pretty non-existent, perhaps a hint of sweet grain character, smells a bit like honeysuckle perhaps. The taste is sweet up front with a hint of bitterness in the finish. Mainly this is a simple light brew that cleanses my palate with it's simplistic sweet grain flavors. Definitely not my bag, though it is a touch more fruity than a stander American lager, and it really does remind me of honey for some reason."
"Don't buy this beer unless you want some sturdy bottles for your homebrew. I haven't broke one yet!!"
"Update. ugg. Don't buy this in cans. It tastes like ass. Sure the bottles costs a little more but for 3 something for a sixer it is still a great deal."
"After one of these, I got a splitting headache. However, I decided it might be a good way to restore my silverware, and lo and behold, it took off all the crap that had collected on my antique spoons. Basically, this is Drain-O. I am halfway through my second and it is the most godawful experience of my life. It's just a sad, sad beer."
"It pours a light straw color with a reasonable amount of white creamy head that is mostly gone after the first sip. A little lacing early. Not much to speak of aroma-wise except for a slight hint of malt sweetness. The taste is a little more than what you'd expect from a cheapy. A little sweeter with a hint of citrus. Mouthfeel is nice, and the finish is short, maybe a little DMS, but still not bad. Taking style into account, I'm giving above average marks!"
"Overall I wouldn't recommend this beer at any price. Not the worst thing I have tried but it would hurt my pride less to beg a stranger for an extra three dollars to get something good than to buy this beer again."
"Drinkability: Well, it's better than any megabrew beer I've ever had but sadly, that ain't saying much. They could go a long way with this beer if they tried, let's hope they do try and soon. I won't be drinking this again."
"This is easily drinkable and would definately quench a thirst on a hot summer day."
"I picked up a six pack of this to try last week after joking with an old law school friend who said he loved it back in college. From the bottle, I poured the beer into a freezer-chilled pint glass. Surprisingly, the head held on for a few minutes. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, with a hint of citrus in the flavor. No malt or hops to speak of, and the aftertaste was a bit unpleasant. Overall, not fantastic, but not the total swill that others seem to think it is."
"Overall-solid, a slighly different beverage than what most are used to, it gets the job done, I tend to prefer my beers much less sweet but this beer was satisfiably adaquete. 3 bucks a sixpack like all other Genny products, this is the highest rated from me thus far."
"A tasty not too expensive everyday type of beer."
"For the BJCP style cream ale, I'd honestly expected some even lighter and more attenuated; however its a prime commercial example so it has to be a 4.75 or so (out of 5)"
"But it's better without the vodka."
"Ahh...an old classic revisited after many years pours an average white head over clear pale golden liquid. Sweet malty nose with a spicy yeast subtleness to it. Above average mouthfeel for a beer of this nature. Flavors of of soft maltiness, light yet effective hop bitterness, less of an adjuncty taste than you would be led to believe in a low-priced beer. The finish is clean with a sweet flourish, for the price you just cannot beat it...miles ahead of PBR in my opinion & a great hot weather quencher."
"This beer, if given proper attention, could be better. As it is, it is just a notch above, in my book, many mass-produced American beers simply because of the unique creaminess and refreshing taste. I suspect the draft version trumps the bottle, and the bottle trumps the can, which I can only remember as awful."
"Yeah, drinkablilty is average if you drink it ice cold and you wanna quick drunk, but why buy this stuff? If you can find Genny Red Lager, it's the same price and a far better tasting beer."
"Where the Hollande 1620 I had just prior to this was surprisingly malty and had a bit going for it, this is paler than the pale lager, the head more fleeting and the flavor weaker. There's no hop presence in the nose or flavor, skunked or not, and the malt only shows up early on as a dry paper-like flavor. Not exciting at all, but then again, there's nothing offensive about it either."
"By the way, make sure you don't have any important meetings the next day. Farting is a side effect of this beer."
"The head is small, white, very noisy and dies quickly. Beer is clear yellow/gold. The smell is sweet, corny, fairly malty. Front is tart, a little grainsy. Middle is thin, some corny maltiness. Finish is corny and slightly bitter, turning cloying with a slight chemical flare. It's not bad: a sweet, corny, common beer."
"The flavor is the strongpoint here, but I really do not want to overstate that as some kind of substantial asset. Average taste, in this case, is in no way enough to overcome the beer's other decidedly subpar characteristics. The sum of the parts makes it drinakable, sure, but I wonder to myself, why bother? Nostalgia? True, I had more than my share in the early 80's, but I'll claim youth as an excuse for such ill-advised indulgences. Some things are best left in the past, and this is one of them."
"Drinkability  A notch above the typical American macro swill in my book."
"A nice, refreshing beer. I bet it would be good on a hot summer day."
"I could not drink this all night, I could definitely have more than one but not many. As I said, the more I drank the worse it tasted."
"I bought this one on one of my all to often whims of cheap beers. I am always spending like $5 a bottle for some good stuff, so it's good to take a break and get some really cheap stuff. This was $8 for a 30 pack and that was cheap enough for me! The appearance was pretty basic, nothing fantastic. A little head, but died down fast. The color was of the basic yellow strawish variety. The smell was faint, but you could definately detect some cream to it. The taste was similar, but you cold taste some alcohol to it at 5.1%. The mouthfeel was the same as any other macrobeer, so nothing great. Drinkability? I think so!!! Gimmie some mo!"
"Pours a plae fizzy golden yellow with a healthy sized bright white head, leaving trickled lacing not bad just average in appearance. Aroma contains sweet aroma from the combonation of malt and adjuncts that aren't to off pretty unoffensive smell going on. Some lemon grass tones are also there maybe a touch of hops, but nothing stands out here. Taste contains a rolling sweet flavor not bad just light in flavor mild hop bitterness just a touch, better than most macros that's all I can say about it no off flavors finishes clean. Mouthfeel is thin light in body no impressive features within the mouthfeel. Drinkability is not bad just can't see myself ever craving for this beer, wouldn't pass one just not worth seeking out."
"Light gold color, small head. Aroma is slightly sweet. A light bodied ale. Smooth lighter malt taste, slightly spicy hops. Full flavor. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is malty and slightly sweet. A light and refreshing beer."
"Taste is nothing to write home about. Corny, almost starchy. Dry enough not to make me want more. Odd creamy finish, like an A&W cream soda gone wrong. Coats my mouth and won't let go. No more, please."
"Crystal clear golden body with the thinnest of white heads. No discernible lace effect from the thin layer of white. Plenty of malt in the nose with a sense of caramel when warmer. The taste is purely malt with the lightest of hops adding a small degree of balance. A bit of alcohol comes through on the palate. Smooth and creamy feel with little crispness."
"This beer is one that helped me survive college and of course a weekend visit up there got my old college buddy feeling nostalgic for it. It has got more flavor to it than most of the other beers we consumed in school. It poured a typical pale yellow color and formed little head, but what of it was a bubbly white with no lace left as it vanished. An aroma of hops and grain were present. The aroma was of hops and grain. The finish had a slight creaminess to it that was probably what helped it to be our beer of choice back in college."
"Drinkability/notes: Overall, this is a quite refreshing and very drinkable beer and would be quite pleasing in the summer season."
"Pours a medium golden color with a thin white head that quickly fades into a thin and bubbly lace. Nose is dominated by sweet malts with little else present. Light in body with a clean and crisp mouthfeel. Taste is also mostly sweet malts with only a trace amount of hop bitterness and a dry finish. A very one-dimensional brew."
"To me, Genny strikes me as a beer that can't make up its mind whether its an ale or lager. I find it to be a very drinkable beer with a decent flavor, but the sweetness can put off a lot of people. It seems to be a good accompaniment to burgers off the grill (preferably with cheese and bacon). Overall, I would put this towards the top of cheap beers."
"There are plenty of truly nasty beers, this isn't one of them. Truthfully, it's best suited for battering fish, but if this were in a cooler of free beer with other american macros, I'd take it."
"Taste is generic, mild mannered, adjunct/additives heavy, with a touch of grain and bread dough, slightly sweet. I guess you can describe the flavor as being ""creamy"" but, that might be a preconception, hard to say. Carbonation in this beer is rather low, I think it helps the beer a lot. Enough already with fizzy soda like carbonation. One of the best super cheap beers."
"Highly carbonated gold-amber pour settles down quickly, from an explove frothy head to a coating deflated lace. Smells lightly of spice and lime. Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, I wonder it's leaded. The melodramatic wet dog flavor stays consistant with a musky, crisp taste and a sandy, smarmy finish. Quite a bang for your buck."
"Another beer headed to the Dead Beer File, so one last review before its ultimate demise, at least for me. The pour a bright gold color, the head average and bright white, as it decays, leaves behind a thin sheet to cover the glass. Nose is malt, sweet, and fresh, sweet malt start, the top quite thin, the finish as weak as water, mild carbonation, the hops scarce, aftertaste dry. Personally a total loss, it does beat dying of thirst, but just barely."
"it's better out of the bottle. it is much smoother and creamier, and it has a lot more flavor. the can is lacking all the qualities that make it a pretty good beer to drink. it is still decent and you can throw em back, but it is not anything special."
"Bottom Line: Definitely a better alternative than the ""standards," especially on draught. A reliable, inexpensive session beer that satisfies the requirements of its category, but won't make you say ""wow."""
" Good for this style, watch out for the ""Genee scremers""."
"Thanks bditty187 for the trade so I could review this beer!"
"When I think of ""cream"" it is usually stout, so I had to try this. There is no cream to the taste. It has a hoppy taste, but overall I rank it in the ""Pabst"" class of beers. I will not be drinking this again any time soon."
"By no means, would I say this beer is wonderful, I purchased a 6-pack ($5.50) and that seems like enough for me."
"To be fair, this can has sat in the vegetable crisper for well over a year, but it tastes as it did when the six-pack was purchased. It smells grainy with a little bit of fruit, but nothing special and pours golden with a hint of orange. Not too carbonated, and is slightly sweet with nondescript yet present hops. It has a thin body, but is not watery from residual sugars. Overall, not a bad beer. Better than most macros."
"Rich golden in color beneath a fizzy white head. The head retention and lacing are no better than any standard American lager. The aroma offers malt and fruit (apple) with a light touch of hops in the background. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy. The flavor offers a bit of fruitiness and it's well balanced by a malt and hop base that's just slightly sweet. A bit one dimensional, but it offers far more character than the basic ""Genesee Beer"". It finishes slightly sticky on the back of the tongue without any real dryness, but it's not cloying either. The fruitiness lingers nicely as the malty sweetness fades gently away. Lightly refreshing. Not challenging. More interesting than a lot of basic American lagers because of the yeasty fruit component."
"Shotgun, anyone?"
"Golden color with dissipating head.  Fresh malty flavor with a few hops in the back. Creamy texture and very smooth.  A well made, straight forward, economical, lawn mower beer.  Better than the macros in my opinion."
"Poured with a dense, white, but thin head. This dissapated quickly.  This was highly carbonated and a rich gold color.  Hop nose was good, in fact darn good for a macro.  The taste was crisp and clean with good mouthfeel.  This is a well balanced beer that doesn't taste like it's full of adjuncts.  I was surprised as my father used to drink this."
"This beer is generally average in everyway, except for the cream ale style.  Body of an ale, with the flavor and appearance of a lager.  As the name implies, it does have somewhat a chewey, creamy texture.  Flavor falls short of expectations."
"I had a friend from New Jersey who was always raving about Genny Cream.  We finally found a bar that served it and sat down to enjoy some.  To say I was disappointed after all the hype would be an understatement.  This beer doesn't have anything going for it.  Hops are barely there.  It has an unpleasant sweet taste and an even more unpleasant aftertaste."
"Very clear light golden hue, w/ a thin head that manages to coat the glass.  Sweet corn adjunct and cooked cabbage DMS aroma. Husky 6 - row notes as well.  Definitely not appetizing aromawise.  Light in body and sharply carbonated. The very low hop bitterness leaves the beer quite sweet. The residual corn sweetness is offputting.  The finish is one dimensionally sweet and a bit astringent.  Has this beer always been this poor?  WAY too much flaked corn used as an adjunct."
"A pool hall in Florida I used to frequent sells this. Sweet, a bit hoppy, seems to have lots of artificials as it'll discolor anything. No odor to speak of. Oddly, it's better straight out of the can. I guess the extra metal helps. A bit thin and leaves residue behind."
"Although not a great beer, this brew has an undeserved reputation.  A somewhat perceptible hop flavor and a surprising sweetness separate this beer from many others in its class.  One of the few ""non-craft"" beers that I still stomach."
"Genny Cream isn't readily found in my neck of the woods, but I'll pick it up when I see it from time to time.  This is a decent drink, I don't care what anyone says. Its not complex, but it is refreshing.  Great to drink while BBQ-ing steaks."
"This a one of the classics of my dad who doesn't drink much..he had one while out east about 20 years ago and it has since been his favorite ever since mainly because we can't get it in Minnesota(kind of like the old Coors mystique)..I am not as high on it as him, but it is not a bad drinking cream ale.  It does not have a cheap taste to it at all.  It is slick on the back of the tounge....sweetish, but not like a bad malt-liqour sweetish..a slight hint of a corn adjunct taste...not bad at all, but not one of the all-time greats as my dad thinks..I'd say slightly above average when compared to all the macro lagers out there.  It does have a bit of an unexpected aftertaste."
"This beer is a bit nostalgic for me...yes it was my first. At about 15 or 16, I impressed my friends by polishing off a six in about 20 minutes. You can guess the result a short while later, I'll spare the details. Also I find it entertaining that this beer has been around for about 40yrs. and recently it's a trendy ""new"" style for the craft segment. Better in the bottle and ice cold."
"Notes: Ah ... the memories. I remember my step-dad drinking this stuff out of the can back in the late 70's / early 80's. Given this, I can't hate this beer. It's not all that bad, for what it is. But would I keep it in my fridge all of the time? Hell no."
