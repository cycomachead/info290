"Sorry but this is just not a good beer.  The taste doesn't match the style at all its a sweet mess."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a copper color with amber hues and a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of caramel. Taste is caramel, vanilla, malts, some sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a good beer on this hot day."

"On tap at Bar Louie in West Palm Beach.  Dark Amber/red color, with no head.  I assume it was poured poorly.  Smells of sweet caramel candy. It tastes like a dessert.   Unfortunately I had this after an IPA so I fear my palette may have been wrecked to taste this well.   I tasted a strong caramel taste with a malty bread note midway.  After taste is pleasant and sweet.  This is a great if you want a light sweet beer!"
"Pours tan with frothy head. Minimal lacing. Smells of caramel sugar. Too sweet. Gentle mouthfeel is you can tolerate real sweetness."
"Not terrible but not nearly as good as I was hoping. It almost tasted bitter, like it had a much higher ABV than it really did."
"I love cream soda and was really excited to try this but......"
"i like the idea, i was sold on the idea in fact, but the beer i think under delivers a little bit this time. it doesnt seem a whole lot like a cream ale as a base beer, almost amber in color, dark to say the least for the style, almost more like a cream soda than a cream ale there. the caramel is there, all form the grain i think, but its sweet and rich enough. the nose and taste mirror each other, rich but bubbly, and there is an obvious vanilla profile to it. i think it may even be brewed with vanilla. plenty of bubbles, but the sweetness lingers a little too long i think, and even half a can with my brother drinking the other half was enough for both of us. the idea rocks, but this needs to ferment down a little longer, if they let it climb up to around 6% abv i think it would be a radically better and more drinkable brew, as it stands, its a novelty and little else. that might be harsh, it probably accomplished its stated objective, but its a one and done for me just the same."

"I had this beer before and under the meal (20 oz Longhorn Porterhouse) and I must say I liked it! Creamy, soft and a little sweetness. Great taste for a beer with only 5% ABV."
"Tried this on vacation in Orlando. Looks good tastes ok."

"Poured from a can into a pint glass.  A very pretty beer that smells like a sweet brown ale.  It is not as sweet to taste as it smells (which is probably a good thing) but the caramel and vanilla are prominent.  Slight cloying aftertaste keeps it from being perfect.  Very enjoyable.  Drinkable in all seasons."

"Due South is a local place that brews a good selection. The caramel cream ale and their IPAs are their go-tos, and not being a huge fan of IPAs, I went with the caramel cream. It was excellent. Great balance of vanilla and caramel and just the right amount of hops(minimal) for this beer. Mixed with their Honey Wheat it was even better. My only criticism, if you can really call it that, is that it does not seem to stay carbonated well in a growler. Recently, Due South released one of their IPAs in cans, and I am hoping the Caramel Cream follows suit. Until then, if you are in the Boynton Beach area, this place is definetly worth the trip."

"Poured into a ""Due South Brewing Co."" pint glass produced small head for this dark amber beer. Smell was vanilla and caramel. Taste was vanilla, caramel and malt. Reminded me of a good amber or cream ale with hints of vanilla and caramel. Not much hop flavor. MF was medium with low carbonation. Very tasty on its own or with the ribs that I was enjoying. Had another as it's one of the better brews I've had lately. I may stop by the brewery as it's close to where I live. I'll definitely look for this again as it was smooth and tasty. Today 8/5, I purchased a six at Total Wine. They just got it in stock. Needless to say I can hardly wait for it to get cold!"

"Carbonation is soft-medium. Body is medium, emphasizing the sweetness."

"O: Another solid offering from Due South. When I asked Mike at the tasting bar which beer best represents their brewery, he filled my growler with this. Very easy drinking yet it's packing plenty of flavor for a low ABV session beer. A must try for Cream Ale addicts like myself."
""
"On draft at Due South for their Grand Opening. Had heard about this beer from prior events so I was jazzed to try this one. Slight caramel cream notes with a tad bit of funk. Heard this batch may have been sub par so I’ll give Due South a break here. Will definitely try again though."
