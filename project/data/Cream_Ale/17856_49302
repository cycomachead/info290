Tiny particles are suspended within the clear gold volume.  Odor is sour and lightly skunky.  The taste is almost identical to the smell.  Flavors other than sour and skunk are lacking.  Hearty carbonation gives this a heavy feel when swallowed.  This one's a belcher.  I would compare this to Genessee Cream Ale-which I feel exactly the same way about.  Priced too high for the quality.  Build your own 6-pack for $7.99","HawbakerBrewery","Feb 16, 2015"

It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, mild corn, and sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, progressing flavor-wise from sweet, almost cream-like notes to decidedly wheaty and grainy notes to a sort of off-fruit-y territory that mars an awful lot of decent progress up to that point. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally fluid feel. Overall, an okay cream ale at best, one that hints at some form of tastiness before wrenching it away from me.","TMoney2591","Oct 17, 2012"

The ""brewery's"" website calls this beer a saison, so I listed it as one even though it tastes nothing like one. In fact this is the worst saison I've ever had.
