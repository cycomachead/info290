"Smell and taste are awful. The concept of blending cumin, lime and tequila seems like a good idea, however the results are not good, resulting in a drain pour."

"O- The smell really kills this beer for me. Maybe it's better when it's fresh on tap. For the most part, an interesting concept that doesn't quite work out in reality."
""
"There's no PC way to describe it.  You know that very distinct curry/body odor stank some of your favorite 7-11 owners rock?  Liquefy that, throw more salt and cumin on top, and spike in bad tequila.  Bam!  El Murcielago!"

"Heavy cumin, boozy and sweet"
"This is a relatively quite sweet beer, but they still manage to give quite a pleasant burst in flavors."
""

"I liked this one enough to pick up a $20 growler. very strong tequila and lime notes as well as what felt like a slight saltiness. It reminds me of my freshman days, in a  good less puke filled way."

"I had this on tap at Cigar City in a snifter.  A very unique beer.  It has a nice full mf in my opinion.  The tequila come out big time.  This is a sipper and you really can only drink one or at least I can only drink one as the cumin and tequila are very strong and totally mess with your palette."

"On tap at the brewery. Going into this knowing I dislike tequila more than just about anything, but had to try it. Pours murky brown like a barleywine with a small khaki head. Aroma is a horrendous mix of tequila and vomit, and nothing else. Seriously, smells like I'm about to just drink a straight shot of Jose Quervo. Completely awful. After I build up the courage to take a sip--and let my gag reflex settle--the beer actually surprised me a bit. It drinks extremely smooth, with big vanilla notes from the barrel, light lime but barely noticeable, lots of tequila still, but not offputting as the nose, and some caramelly malts to back this up. Actually pretty thick bodied for a cream ale, and it's needed to hold up to the barrels. I couldn't ever drink more than an ounce of this, and don't ever want to drink it again. Though I can't say it tastes good, per se, I'm actually extremely impressed that CCB was able to meld these flavors in a way that works pretty well. If you're a tequila lover, sure you've gotta try this. If you hate tequila, you won't like it. But it's quite the experience."

"I must have a heightened sensitivity to the cumin or lime, or both. Literally couldn't take another sip past the first...it's a shame because I was looking forward to this beer...it's ok CCB I still love you"

"This beer is rather insane. Cumin is more intense than most Indian dishes I have had. Huge tequila as well, messy."

"Better when it warmed down, easier to drink, taste gets used to drink, very unique."
"Pours a light brownish dark red color with off-white head. Barrel on the nose, some whiskey notes, with vanilla, caramel, and oak; follows onto the palate. Finishes with some sweetness and more barrel character. Very smooth."

"O: After more than two years in the bottle, this turned out pretty nicely. A nice malty sweet beer, balanced by the mild spices and somewhat muted tequila (less than I remember when fresh). I didn't get any lime flavors out of the beer at this point. Overall, quite enjoyable."

"Tried on tap at DLD. A very unique beer. This was the first tequila aged beer I've had. The aroma is interesting, and the pour is a murky yellow with a bit of a white head. The cumin and the lime peels really provide an extra something that makes this beer stand out. Definitely worth a try if you can get your hands on one."

"Overall its different which is why I picked it up, wouldn't drink it everyday but defiantly worth a try just to check it out."

"O. Very unique beer that was pretty good considering all the wacky ingredients that going on."
"The pour is a cloudy orange color with a tall eggshell head. Smells mostly like lime, very mild spices, and very little, almost no tequila. A moderate malt aroma and sweetness. Tastes primarily like cumin. There’s a nice bit of lime and wood. A hint of tequila on the finish, maybe a touch of vanilla as well."
""
""
"Overall: I thought this was a very interesting beer. I was surprised how prevalent the barrel was without the tequila being too strong. I think I would have another one."
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of limes, lime zest, salt, wood, and some slight tequila aromas. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a pretty astringent bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer for what it is and an interesting concept for sure."
""
"Flavor is similar to aroma but tastes more like a beer than it smells. There's still a margarita feel with hints of lime, salt, spice and a heavy tequila presence but the malt and yeast notes are more prevalent. Also, there's a bit more of a barrel presence with dry oak and subtle vanilla. Slightly bready with caramel malt but the salt, citrus, cumin and tequila overpower the other flavors. I've only had one other tequila BA beer before(Zapata Bot) which I really enjoyed but this one is a bit heavy handed for my liking. An interesting experiment that I'm glad to have tried but I wouldn't order it again."

"Had during the 2nd Annual Redneck Racin’ & Tastin’ while tailgating at the dirt track race! Big thanks goes out to BRoss242 for this one! Served from bottle into a NoDa snifter. Poured yellow-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised sweet malt, pepper, lime, wood, sweet alcohol, and cumin. The flavor was of sweet malt, cumin, sweet alcohol, pepper, and lime. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Holy cumin Batman! I am a big fan of cumin when it comes to cooking and this brew carries this aspect over into liquid form! All of the other aromas and flavors going on here definitely make a statement and mix really well with the cumin aspect which was definitely the star of the show. This brew actually made me quite hungry. Too bad I didn’t give in like the others at the dirt track and eat a bologna sandwich. You guys make me sad… Oh yeah, the brew…. Try this thing!"

"Pours a hazy dark amber with a thin white head that settles to a slight ring. Rich aromas of buttery grain, tequila, caramel, and coconut. Really nice. Florida-inspired flavors carry through to the taste, lots of coconut, tequila, sweet malt, caramel, and lime peel. Smooth and creamy, with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Somehow this beer evokes Florida perfectly, I get sunscreen, sand, palm trees, and coconuts. Really unique and interesting."
"Damn. This is a unique beer & even better, it's damn good. Never had anything quite like it, & my half of the bottle is vanishing faster than the plot of a chick flick. Excellent beer from an excellent brewery, thanks again Mike."

"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma is full of cumin, with a little bit of bread and some cedar thrown in. This beer is completely unique and I have never smelled anything similar to it. The flavor is also unique. I get a lot of agave syrup and orange notes, as well as some cream, sugar and cinnamon. There is a ton going on in both the aroma and the flavor, and every sip brought me more and more flavors. I have no doubt that if I had another glass, I would come up with even more characteristics. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"O: This is definitely one of the more interesting beers that I have every tried, the aroma is a little off-putting but the flavor is much better than expectations from the aroma. I'm not sure I would get this one again."
"Overall, this is an incredibly complex and flavorful beer. Although I don't drink tequila anymore (too many bad memories), this is surprisingly nice. You gotta try this at least once."

"Pours a moderate golden-brown color with a very thin white head and not much in the way of lacing. The nose brings really strong tequila and wood with a bit of lime. The flavor is the same. The mouthfeel is the same. This is tequila plus lime through and through, and I was not a big fan."
"My friend came straight over to my house after a trip to Tamps this weekend. While he was there he visited the Cigar City Brewery and brought many variations for me to try out. The first one we cracked open was El Murcielago. This beer looks about like any other I have had. It was a darker amber color. The smell was fairly strong, you can easily detect a coconut scent. When you taste the beer however it tastes like a swallow of Malibu and tequila. Perhaps some people like their beers to taste like liquor, I however do not. I actually really like this brewery but this beer is not for me."

"O - I bought 6 cases after I tried this...okay, kidding. Seriously though, it smells and tastes like vagina. Is this good or bad? I guess it depends on how you roll, homies. Very...unique? I guess I could have given the taste/smell of vagina a 4.5, but not really sure I could drink pour after pour of it. Maybe I'm not all man?"

"Drink- A great use of a under appreciated barrel. I liked it with the style they chose."
