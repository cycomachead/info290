The only thing this beer (and other Weston beers) has going for it is the artwork on the packaging/labels. Unfortunately, it's not enough to save this wretched brew.","ratedz","Aug 22, 2010"
2.86,-5.6,3,2,3,4,3,"This is a rather bland ale as far as taste. It smells horrible like something turning bad and the only good thing is that it has a great mouthfeel-very full and thick. I feel this is the best beer that Weston has put out so far. That being said, it's overall an average ale.","duhbled","May 22, 2010"

3.35,10.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Feel is smooth enough without major flaws, there's a slight astringency present though. Easy enough to drink, seems better suited for warm weather.

2.97,-2,2,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Overcarbonated, too much. Easy to drink, a decent summer beer but not much more than if the temp is lower than 85 degrees. Not one to get again, but interesting.","robbyc1","Jan 24, 2008"
2.58,-14.9,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"D - Not sure about this one. I wasn't really impressed from pour to finish. Not that it's terrible, just not my style. Not sure it's a good example either.","TYE","Jan 10, 2008"
1.98,-34.7,2.5,2,2,1.5,2,"I don't like Weston Brewing Company's O'Malley's Irish Style Cream Ale. It's an insult to O'Malley, to the Irish and to cream ales in general. Good thing distribution is limited.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 18, 2007"
1.35,-55.4,2,2,1,1.5,1,"I very rarely get this down on a beer. I was even going to give it a second shot and purchase a new six pack of the beer thinking maybe something goofy had happened during the shipping proces or at the market where I picked up that tainted the beer. In conversation with my buddy a couple days after I had tried this beer he was telling me about a new beer he had picked up at the package store which he thought was awful. It turned out to be this very same beer.","alwbii","Nov 07, 2007"
2.07,-31.7,1.5,2,2,2,2.5,"Not repulsive, but a waste. Too bad, I would have loved to continue buying from a local brewery.","jar2574","Oct 06, 2007"
2.9,-4.3,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Pours a hazy yellow color with a tan head. Aromas of a sweet malt. In the taste, a sweet malt dominates a small presence of peet and a small bitter. A bitter, yet full bodied mouthfeel, with a dry malty aftertaste. Malty and sweet, easy to drink, and mellow. Flavors are light, but effective.","OWSLEY069","Jul 05, 2007"
3.13,3.3,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"This beers pours a pale, straw-colored yellow with a white, monstrous head. Aroma is very light but there is a tart sweetness to it that I can detect. The taste is light and crisp with a hint of apple, but not at all tart. I think this is what makes this beer appealing and drinkable. There is some creaminess to the body. Though I am not too familiar with the cream ale style I can't make any comparisons. This one is not a beer that I'd go out and seek, I did find this beer to be a pleasant surprise.","jhammerly","Feb 25, 2007"

3.11,2.6,3,2,3,3.5,4.5,"Had on tap at the Iliki Cafe, served in a pint glass. Clear yellow colot, not really that impressive. Massive and thick head with a consistancy of whipped cream. Points lost for color are earned back with the head. It glues itself to the glass leaving solid stripes with each sip. Smell is not very noticable, slightly lemony and biscuity. Taste is also very light but picks up a bit more grassy notes. Mouthfeel is of course very creamy. In fact for the fist half of it it's like eating whipped cream. this is very smooth and easy to drink, even if there sin't much substance behind it. Definately a session beer","bort11","Beers"
2.91,-4,3,2,3,3.5,3.5,"This is the only offering from the Weston Brewing Co. Served only in O'malley's irish pub in Weston, MO (as of today). The beer is overall unimpressive. Served on nitro the carbonation masks the taste for the most part and the aroma in total. The flavor is predominately sweet malts and some light grains. All of the taste is found in the frontend of the beer there is no finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth most of this can be attributed to the nitro. Not offensive at all and apparently they serve a bunch of it but most BA's will not be impressed.","hoffman","0"
