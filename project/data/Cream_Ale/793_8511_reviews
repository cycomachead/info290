"Thanks for the bottle, Barry!"
"O - The every man's beer for knocking around when some crisp refreshment is needed, Coon Rock doesn't aim to impress with crazy specialty malts or hop additions; it's just a simpleton. Simple, tasty, and refreshing."

"This poured out as a clear looking yellow color. A thin white fizzy head on top that settling into a scattered film on top of the beer. No lacing and minimal retention. The smell of the beer is a little grassy, smells similar to some German Lager's out there. Not typically what I was expecting from a Cream Ale. The taste of the beer was slightly sweet with a decent graininess to it. The finish has a subtle bitterness to it but nothing overwhelming. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, easy to drink and moderately refreshing. Overall it's a decent cream ale, I feel that it should be so grassy though, it should be more sweet on the nose and less Lager-like."
"Coon Rock Cream Ale ain't too shabby at all. It's easy to drink and tastes pretty good."
"Coon Rock is certainly more viscous and lightly carbed than one might expect from the style. The sugar cookie sweetness is quite modest, though, and the light vanilla presence sets it off nicely. A bit of juicy citrus midswallow, and then a touch tangy, a touch grainy in the finish. A better than average cream ale."

"Poured out a translucent pilsner straw yellow color but with only a fizzle of weak collar for a head...no lacing. Smells of mineral water, light amounts of sweet corn, perhaps a crystal malt??? (not sure about that one) and a nice accent of herbal / grassy hops. Flavor is like the nose, but also contains a medium strength bready element that pleases my palate. Lighter bodied (but not watery, thank goodness), well carbonated. Not as ""corny"" as Spotted Cow, but somewhat more bare-bones 'minimalist' as well. Very sessionable."

"Beer poured a pale straw color with bright white head. Aroma was corn. Taste was very similar to an adjunct lager. Not very assertive in flavor. Mouthfeel was thin and drinkability very high. Overall I was fairly dissappointed with this one. Taste was too much like a bud miller coors product but at a much higher price. These types of beers definitely have their place, but are available at much lower cost."

"overall i would buy this beer again usually in a 6-pack it is one of the decent cream ales i have had in a long time"
" ~ This is a nice cream ale. It's not boring as I have found others of this style to prove. This is something I would recommend and if I knew the abv it might even fit into the sessionable realm."
"Drinkabiliy -- Solid for the style, but I couldn't get into it. Definitely not on par with Spotted Cow."
"Served in a pint glass. Pours a very light golden color with a bit of haze. White head and a touch of lacing. The nose is really blank with a very mild amount of light bread plus some very faint hops. Taste is bread with a very mild amount of bitterness. Light body. Drinks well enough, but nothing special."
"I poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass...color was a somewhat lighter golden yellow; smell was good, mouthfeel was good. Unlike my last cream ale, this one had a more distinctive, creamier taste to it. I paired it with a white bean chicken chili, which no doubt enhanced the sweetness of this beer. Still not as enjoyable at the old Blatz Light Cream Ale from a decade or more ago, but I will definitely try this one again...light, creamy taste that is well-suited for warmer days."
"While not the most flavorful Cream Ale I've ever had, this wasn't horrible or anything either. Easy flavors and feel here, making for a mostly pleasant quaff."
"Poured with a nice, white head that pretty much settle down to a light cover and some lace. Color is a crystal clear yellow. Aroma is beery, malty, light hop, a bit of yeast, and some grain. Flavor's the same but more sweet. Body is good and so is carbonation. I'd like it better if it weren't quite as sweet. Slight bitterness in finish. I will say the sweetness is short lived and that helps. Could do worse for a session beer."
"D-One of the best cream ales I have encountered....very well done and enjoyable to drink"
"Pours a crystal clear color with a mild white head that leaves a little lacing. Aroma is of bread/dough as well as pine notes. Taste is of hop bitterness followed by smooth and sweet bread and honey notes. Excellent mouthfeel, finishes extremely smooth."
"Slightly hazed sun yellow body. It glows yellow. Thin bubbly cap of dirty white head. Aroma is sweet, malty, a little bready...almost like a german pilsner kicked down one notch in the aroma department. Flavor is top notch for the style. A cream ale that has some substance. I like it. Sweet malty tones with no signs of corn or other adjuncts. Slight hay like bitterness lingering after the taste adds another dimension and alludes to a slight dry impression with the aftertaste. Body is medium to medium-full. Very drinkable and enjoyable. This is a nice achievement here with this style. I'd drink it often if it were available around here."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, soft, but full. Very drinkable, best thing about it, could have several, must be around 4.5% abv I believe. Will be seeking a six pack next time in WI."
"Pours a clear, golden/maize color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of grass, cream, slight hops, yeast, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of a Cream Ale. Mouth feel is crisp and sharp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of cream, yeast, tart malt, sweet malt, slight citrus, and slight hops. Overall, an average cream ale with a mouthfeel hurt by the high carbonation level."
"D - Pretty easy drinking beer overall. The carbonation level provides for a good balance between the fruity side of this beer and the malt/grain side."
"This beer pours a clear light golden color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into almost no lacing. The aroma is of corn, and faint caramel malt. The taste is the corniest of any beer I've ever tried. It is a sharp, lingering flavor that simply doesn't work for me. The mouthfeel is light bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, I can't see myself ever drinking this again."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a lighter-than-light straw color with a thick white head. In fact, this beer had the thickest head I'd ever seen because it was extremely over-carbonated. I didn't even pour a third of it into the glass without the foam reaching the top. Aroma of fruity esters and lime. Light bodied, watery taste with faint malt sweetness, hints of corn and minature hop aftertaste. Once most of the carbonation was gone and I could actually taste this beer instead of the bubbles, it was still not very good."
"Decidedly average, and reminiscent of take-your-pick cheap macro lager. Nothing wrong with it, but fairly forgettable. Hopefully Lake Louie has more interesting options."
"D: It's not as crisp as some beers in the same style but it's a clean, thirst quencher that has a great mouthfeel that lives up to the name. It also has a great ability to deliver a good flavor consistently until the last drop. Some lower ABV ales of this style can start to taste weak and watery. A fine brew."
"M/D - Medium bodied, very crisp and clean. Well carbonated beer. An incredible easy drinker that would be a very good session ale."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, prickly along the tongue, with sweetness, some candy corn, and lemon lingering into a slick, dry finish."
"D- This is a smooth and easy drinking, thirst quenching beer. The flavor, while simple has some nice depth and a good balance of grain and hops."
"D-Could drink this cutting the lawn (as many have said). Definitely not a ""go to"" beer for me."
"It's an ok beer but not really what I like to drink. The taste is good once you get past the smell and appearance."
"Pours a hazy pale golden with a tiny filmy white head. Aroma is lightly sweet, peaty, light malt and astringent bitterness. The flavor is corn, light citrus, grassy, pepper and light honey. Abrupt light sweet finish. Light bodied, creamy texture. Kind of a mix of styles IMHO."
"drinkability is good. this is a very basic brew without much complexity, but good proportioning. could be a bit heavier in body, which would compliment the cream and malt."
"Poured a light straw color. Slight scent of lemon in the head but nothing that gets me excited. mild carbination and a very slight hint of cream. my least favorite part of this beer is that my mouth has a similar taste as if I had just drank a macro-brewed lager. My first beer from Lake Louie, perhaps not the best intro to their beers."
"This beer pours slightly hazy (not a big deal because I recommend decanting this beer into a glass due to yeast sediment on the bottom). Light-straw in color with not much of an aroma of hops or malt. Very little mouthfeel, a little thin in body. Defnitely a summer brew."
"Way more palatable than the Genessee Cream Ale I had earlier tonight. Probably sessionable, but not interesting enough to find out. Won't be trying it again, Spotted Cow is better in my opinion."
"The beer had a pleasant enough appearance...a pale straw color with a fairly Sprite-like head. Aroma was rather sweet, like candy sugar. And that was the primary component of the flavor as well...not a lot of hoppiness or maltiness and no ""add-on"" flavors like fruitiness, chocolate, toffee, coffee, etc. Mouthfeel was unremarkable. Not bad - I finished the bottle, but not something I'd be in a rush to have again."
"D: Easy drinking as it lacks body and is a bit thin. A nice summer brew to suck back. Possibly a great session brew while sweating in the sun."
"D - This one is not bad but does not stand out either. It might be all the Miller and Busch I drank in college but I just do not care for any beer nowadays that has a big corn presence."
"This just isn't my style of beer so I can't say much about getting behind this beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3 1/2"" white head over the clear golden brew. Gave it some time for things to settle down. Head calms to a meringey inch of froth, with sporadic artful lacing. Aroma is defined by a lightly tart and fruity essence. Flavor is tart and bitter, with little to no pale malts character at all. Mouthfeel is nowhere near as smooth as I look for cream ales to be, with drinkability just not that great in my book. Have to try this one again, maybe I was unlucky with a bottle this time."
"single bottle purchased at Riley's and consumed in Madison"
"12 oz bottle. This one pours a solid testaceous color with a finger of white, compact head. Clarity is almost perfect, and there is an enormous cascade of bubbles in the brew. Taking a sniff, I get very mild aroma in this one. There is a light corn sweetness, very faint lemony kiss, and a mild husky grain. I'm really having to work to get any arom on this one other than some corn sweetness. Flavor is right there with the aroma. Good corn and husky grain flavors, though not offensive and abbrasive huskyness, with a light lemon zest on the finish, with a very mild bitterness coming in the finish as well. This one is very straitforward, but there is nowhere to hide any flaws. Much of what I expect in a cream ale. Mouthfeel is moderate with a very solid moderate carbonation that makes this one very lively. I enjoy the way the bittering hop hits late in the finish, keeping it from being a focus, but letting me know it is there as I go for another sip. This is a fairly simple beer in my mind, but they do it well."
"A solid cream ale. A summer quencher for sure to be enjoyed when ever, where ever within the dog days of summer. Gone in to time and another is just as easy to down."
"Even though I've still only had a handful of their offerings, I don't believe that I've had so much as a mediocre Lake Louie beer. Coon Rock is a delicious treat and deserves much wider distribution. If you think that all cream ales are bland and uninteresting, there's a great little brewery in Wisconsin that would love to change your mind."
"drinkability: its a cream ale, it can be consumed in large quantities"
"-UF"
"Nothing special butthe masses will like this one. Perhaps this is Louies retirement fund. Who knows. My advise is to skip this one and stick with the Scotch Aleor the Porteror thewellany of Louies other beers. Theyre just about the best out there."
"Picked this up on the way out of Madison yesterday, a 64 ounce growler from Riley's. This is the oddest-looking beer I've ever seen, almost colorless. The closest thing I've seen to it is New Glarus's Totally Naked. Though it looks like very slightly gold-tinted water, it's not unattractive. It has excellent lacing and bubble action. Really doesn't smell like much at all. Taste isn't bold by any means, but subtlely sweet, with a really nice mouthfeel and aftertaste. This is very easy to drink, but is barely there at all. Coon Rapids Cream Ale, the phantom beer."
"64 ounce growler. This beer pours out a dull yellow color with a white head. Bready aroma. It could be my imagination, but I think I can smell the corn. Alcohol becomes noticable in the nose as the beer warms, though I doubt the abv is very high. Biscuity malt flavor. The flavor is a little too sweet for me. Although this is not a very hoppy style of beer, I think this beer could use some more hops. Mouthfeel is light. Although this beer is sweet, it is still quite drinkable. This beer is pretty good for the style, but just as a beer it's nothing special."
"Drinkability was high, even Dave could probably session this one all night. Another winner from Lake Louie."
"Awesome summer quaffer. Just about anyone will be able to enjoy this one."
