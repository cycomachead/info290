Unfortunately I had this after an IPA so I fear my palette may have been wrecked to taste this well.   I tasted a strong caramel taste with a malty bread note midway.  After taste is pleasant and sweet.  This is a great if you want a light sweet beer!","mtvolkens","Feb 23, 2015"

3.52,-2.8,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"i like the idea, i was sold on the idea in fact, but the beer i think under delivers a little bit this time. it doesnt seem a whole lot like a cream ale as a base beer, almost amber in color, dark to say the least for the style, almost more like a cream soda than a cream ale there. the caramel is there, all form the grain i think, but its sweet and rich enough. the nose and taste mirror each other, rich but bubbly, and there is an obvious vanilla profile to it. i think it may even be brewed with vanilla. plenty of bubbles, but the sweetness lingers a little too long i think, and even half a can with my brother drinking the other half was enough for both of us. the idea rocks, but this needs to ferment down a little longer, if they let it climb up to around 6% abv i think it would be a radically better and more drinkable brew, as it stands, its a novelty and little else. that might be harsh, it probably accomplished its stated objective, but its a one and done for me just the same.","StonedTrippin","Feb 21, 2015"

3.92,8.3,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Due South is a local place that brews a good selection. The caramel cream ale and their IPAs are their go-tos, and not being a huge fan of IPAs, I went with the caramel cream. It was excellent. Great balance of vanilla and caramel and just the right amount of hops(minimal) for this beer. Mixed with their Honey Wheat it was even better. My only criticism, if you can really call it that, is that it does not seem to stay carbonated well in a growler. Recently, Due South released one of their IPAs in cans, and I am hoping the Caramel Cream follows suit. Until then, if you are in the Boynton Beach area, this place is definetly worth the trip.","scanny24","Nov 02, 2013"

Reminded me of a good amber or cream ale with hints of vanilla and caramel. Not much hop flavor. MF was medium with low carbonation. Very tasty on its own or with the ribs that I was enjoying. Had another as it's one of the better brews I've had lately. I may stop by the brewery as it's close to where I live. I'll definitely look for this again as it was smooth and tasty. Today 8/5, I purchased a six at Total Wine. They just got it in stock. Needless to say I can hardly wait for it to get cold!","hopmashian","Oct 14, 2013"
