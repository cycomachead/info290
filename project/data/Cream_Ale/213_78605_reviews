"Great creamy feel that they were going for. Unfortunately they forgot the rest in the process."
"Pours a thin yellow with a little bit of fizz. The scent is sweet with malt and almost no hop scents coming through. The taste and mouthfeel were interesting with a thicker style cream ale that had a very mellow flavor. Easy drinking with a lot of substance to it made for an enjoyable evening with this beer."

"Overall: Some of the advertising copy for this beer mentions that it's good for duckpin bowling, so I was bound to like it, as a lifelong duckpinner. That aside, it's really a terrific everyday session beer. Basic enough to appeal to any palate, crafty enough to appeal to the more sophisticated beerman. One of my beers of choice for events where I know I'm going to be hosting large groups, because it's cheap and reliable, too."

"This beer is good. Great for someone just getting into craft beers and learning the styles."

"Overall: A nice and clean lager. Nothing mid blowing and complex, but solid. This is a beer I would not go out of my way for, but I would not turn down either."
"16oz. can. Pours a pale golden yellow, with a medium lasting creamy white head, some light lacing. Aroma and Taste of biscuit malt, citrusy, some grains and grassy notes, light bitterness. A light to med body, crisp mouthfeel with good carbonation on the palate. Finish is some biscuit malt, citrusy, grainy, and grassy notes, some mild yeast and bitterness. Overall a good light refreshing summer session ale."

"A solid go, this shows more character than most versions that are true to this style. Balance and drinkability seem to be the prime directives here, both of which they nailed."

"Based on having three great past beers from these guys, I'm sad that this one takes me aback a bit. It's refreshing and works well on its own (cold) and maybe paired with bar food, but it's simplified with bizarre nuances (such as the bittered bite at the finish) to the point where it wouldn't be something I could have as casually as I wished. Perhaps it's TOO toned down even to style, for better for worse. It definitely lacks the charm that makes their Summer Ale highly drinkable. Too bad, but glad I could try it!"

"I like to compare beers to metal bands. If the Naragansett Cream Ale was a metal band it would be Killer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B6mpM-d58Y"

"Overall, very nice take on the cream ale style, a little smoother creaminess in the mouthfeel is all i see missing."

"Pours a slightly hazy straw gold. A nice finger-width of white froth sits on top. Decent lace left behind after each sip. The aroma is grassy, slightly floral and sweet, hay, lemon. Good carbonation. Not too thin, but definitely an easy one to quaff. Grassy hops make up the bulk of the flavor, but there is a slight buttery creaminess that smooths the edges out. Mild bready aftertaste. This was what I expected it to be, a nice refreshing tasty ale. I really enjoy what these guys put out."

"O: A simple, great beer. Too bad I can't get it regularly in Chicago."
"D: Chuggable. Pretty good stuff, considering what it is/ what it's supposed to be/ where it comes from, etc. A really solid cheap beer."
"Fills the pint glass beautifully. A golden body with a two finger bone white cap. Good retention, with some clingy lace. The nose is of cereal-like grains and some bitter, earthy hops. Corn sweetness and some undercooked bread are also present. On the palate, corn sweetness and undercooked white bread lead the way before a decent hop bitterness helps to cut through the sweetness mid palate, however more corn/cereal grain sweetness comes back in the finish. Light bodied with mild carbonation. A smooth, crisp beer with a drying finish. A pretty good cream ale, but I wish it was a little less sweet in the finish. Not a bad beer with a pretty excellent price point."

"O - Not too much to say on this one, tastes like a normal 'Gansett lager but with more malts and hops. That said, it's a nice beer especially for a hot day. Not sure about $9 for 6 pints though, I'd rather save the $3 and just get the lager."
"O: this is a decent beer that I would have again."
""
""
"Found this on the Cape and couldn't resist, especially when I say it was now made by the Rochester Brewing Company. Price point didn't hurt, under $6.00 for a six of pounder cans. All that being said, I think this is pretty much Genny Cream Ale in a different package, I'll be eager to do a side by side taste test, however until then, check my review of Genny Cream Ale for this one's specifics..."
"Pours golden light, active bubbles, good head of remaining foam. Chalky malty nose. Smooth lagery beer taste, citrus close. Creamy mouthfeel. Mild mannered, if not a touch sour. Good clean fun, though hardly remarkable."
""
"O- A really well done cream ale. Way to take a simple style and kick it up a notch! Wish more brewers would experiament with this style. Perfect for a warm night."
""
""
""
""
"I don't know what else to say other than this is a smooth, easy drinking ""cookout"" beer that can be consumed one after another."

"Pours a lightly hazed, pale straw, fizzy. Faint scent brings notes of white bread, fresh grain. Taste a tad more strong than scent, lightly bready and grainy, faint grassy hop notes. Nice smooth and clean body with some heft. Good, refreshing beer to pair with the BBQ we were eating, would only seek out as a BMC alternative as its scent and flavor are not too strong."

"Pours out a bubbly golden with two fingers of fluffy head. The aroma is creamy and lightly malty. The taste is excellent and just about exactly what I'd want from a cream ale. It's got a nice creaminess and grainiess, but it's got the right amount of bitter hops to stop it from being cloying while letting the cream aspects shine through. The mouthfeel is light and briskly carbonated, and the drinkability is great. This is just a great cream ale, an outstanding example of a macro style done with a craft level of care."
"First impression is of the thinnish body, but the lower carbonation gives the impression of a richer beer than it is. Good hop presence. This is a good beer without the low hop typical for a Cream Ale. A definite move up from the lawn mower beer category."

"I didn't hate this, but there are far better versions of the style."
"O - Overall...man oh man. I've had my fair share of cream ales but this one takes the cake. This really, really is an outstanding example of the style."
""
"D: Very drinkable session beer with a good light feel to it. Great summer beer."
"It's better on the warmer side which will bring out slight fruit to the finish."
"Overall: Drink it from the can, drink it from the glass, it doesn't matter. It's a beer for drinking en masse on a warm day. I plan on doing this routinely."
"Poured from a tallboy into a true pint, the beer is a pale, crystal clear, goldenrod coloring with a half inch of light, fluffy, white foam that slowly settles into a filmy coating and laces the glass as you drink. Aromas are roasted and creamy, with a subtle sweetness that compliments the biscuits backbone. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a dark, almost char highlight on the sweet and subtle creamy characteristics. Toasted grain flavors throughout, with a slight sour tang to it. The body is light and smooth until the end, when the carbonation gets the best of the beer, leaving a slight sharp finish in mouth. The aftertaste is a subtle roasted sweetness that remains light. Tasty beer."
"O - A good tasting and sessionable brew with enough citrus and bittereness to keep it interesting. Wouldn't be the first beer I'd go to in this summer-day, easy-drinkin', low ABV range but it's worth checking out."

"From the 16 fl. oz can marked 0412-0431. Sampled on April 20, 2012. The pour is golden yellow with a huge, off-white head that lingers. The aroma is full of pale malts and grain. The body is light to medium with the emphasis on medium and it is also smooth. The taste has a definite grainy character but it is not offensive. There is a moderate hop bitterness at the end. this is a delightful cream ale supposedly based on a Pre-Prohibition recipe."
""
"Overall: Drinkable, not memorable."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to pound down for a long time."
""
""
"Notes: Well it's very light and decently drinkable it will do very well on a very warm spring or summer day. Cheers."
"This beer doesn't try to be anything it isn't. It's not incredibly awesome, but it's for sure a step up from the regular 'Gansett lager. I still much prefer their seasonals, but I could see myself drinking a bunch of these on a hot summer day."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and is a good representation of the style. I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting."
""
"This is an OK lawnmower brew but not one I will repeat. It is back to Wexford for me."
"O: Pretty easy to drink, sessionable, and enjoyable. For a beer company that I remember having a kind of bad reputation in my childhood (for cheap crappy beer), I was surprised and happy that I tried it."
"O- Would be o.k. on a scorching hot day...in place of water. Easy to drink, but bland and rather tasteless. Not horrible, but not memorable either."
""
"An american macro without the crap. No gross aftertaste, clean. It is boring."
"O: A New-England throwback style from a relative throwback brewery, Gansett Cream Ale is the 5% ABV light ale for the macro-lager lover in your life. I can see sitting on a boat deck sipping away on it in the summertime waiting for my reel to bob in the water. Might as well save a few bucks & run with the lager, though."
"A really good everyday beer when you just want something tasty and drinkable."
"The only competitive advantage that Genesee Cream Ale has is that it's still cheaper than Narragansett Cream Ale. I will take the latter though because it's easier to drink."
"The body is light and crisp with good carbonation. Overall a real easy one to enjoy. I'll probably keep these guys on hand for when I want something easy to enjoy."
"Honestly, I wasn't too impressed with this beer until I had it a few times. The most interesting thing about this beer is the mouthfeel. I guess I like this about as much as Narragansett Lager. Sadly, it's not as good as some of the seasonal offerings."
""
"Overall, it is worth drinking if you like the lager and want something just a bit more complex. Other than that, I would pass."
""
"O: A very simple cream ale that has nothing offensive going on, but for that matter not much going on at all. It's good, but like I said, very simple and plain"
"Taste starts sweet pale, citrus bite in the middle, with crisp bitterness to the close. Mouthfeel is clean, and drinkability is easy. Good stuff, convenient packaging, nice price. Classic fall back brew."
""
"Pours clear yet darker than a traditional lager/light ale..foam did persist and lacing was solid. The smell is mild... some hints of lemon. A refreshing tasting ale with solid carbination, a mild hop, and smooth...this is an above average everyday lawnmower beer."
"O: Only the second cream ale I've had other than Genesee Cream Ale and this beer is most definitely better than that. Solid lawnmower style for hotter days."
"Overall this is a fine, lighter beer. It's not trying to be something great: It doesn't need to."
"Just got a sixer of tallboys for 8 dollars. Pours with a nice frothy head. No spectacular smell to speak of, but boy oh boy what a great mouthfeel. Nice and creamy. Flavor is pretty good, seems to be stuck in that nonlight beer ""light"" flavor category. Minimal hop bitterness but still a good flavor throughout. I like it now but I suspect in the summer I'll be pounding these regularly. Definitely better than its contemporaries (Wexfords, Genny Cream). Bit of trivia, the cans are made in new york but the draft beer is produced by Providence's Trinity Brewhouse. I'm eager to try that as well. Regardless, I'm happy for Cream's year round availability."

"Very creamy in your mouth with a nice balance between the sweetness snd the hops. Just the right amount of carbonation. A real nice creamed corn and hop bitterness flavor, This is old school cream Ale from back when I was young. Not a Hop machine but a really flavorful smooth Cream Ale you can sit down and drink a few. In your mouth it is smooth and so refreshing and finishes with a nice back and forth sweet and bitter taste. I highly recomend trying this one. Over all I give it a 4.5. Narragansett sure is bringing out some awesome beers. You can just picture sitting down and drinking a few of these on a hot Saturday afternoon!"
"16oz tall boy. Pours a clear yellow color with a 1/4 inch of head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of sweet grains, malts, and a bit of floral hops. Tastes alot like the Narragansett Lager but with a bit more sweetness and hops. Has some of that cream ale lactose sweetness to it. Light mouthfeel and body. Its a decent beer with many similarities to the Lager. Not the best of 'Gansett's newest line of beers but still solid and worth keeping a bunch of in the fridge."

"As long as you drink it cold and out of the can so as not to smell the off aroma, I can see this being good summertime swill."
"O - easy to knock back a few of these in a sitting."
""
"16oz. can served in a tulip nonic. Pours a lovely, translucent straw gold with a one inch, tight, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a consistent skim. Swaths of lacing are revealed during the session. Nose is very subdued - light grassy notes and cereal grains. Tate consistent with nose; however a noble hops presence is also expressed, as well as a light citrus character and a trace of something metallic. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation that leaves a residual prickle across the tongue. Overall a really solid session beer at a great price. I can see adding this beer to my budget line-up."
"O: This is no Sweet Action, but it's a drinkable enough beer and will presumably go down pretty easily when the weather is warmer."

"Pours a brilliantly clear and crisp golden color with a solid foamy white head. Probably medium-high carbonation. Hoppier in both aroma and taste than I was expecting, not that it is an exceptionally big hop presence, but you can not mistake the fact that it is there. Nice smooth and solid hoppy cream ale flavor. Easy drinking. Really a great session Ale counter point to their standard Lager. Will definitely be purchasing again."

"O/D- I am a pretty big fan of Narragansett. They will never blow you away, but they make some solid stuff. This is not my favorite from them but it is not a slouch. I could see this being a brew I would tote around especially when I may be sharing with a group of friends who aren’t huge craft advocates. Haven’t had many Cream Ales, but this is a pretty decent addition to their lineup."
"Not much of a head, light colored ale, lots of bubbles. Nose is light hoppy, creamy, pilsneresque. Not to much nose though. Very nice flavor, creamy as expected, lots of effervescence, big bubbles too. Light on the tongue. Pilsner type hop, actually off you had told me this was a lager I would have believed you. Easy drinking, standard as far as cream ale is concerned, reminds me of when we used to drink Wexford cream ale back in the day (2003.) Solid."
