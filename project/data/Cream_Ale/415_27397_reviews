"Just another big box beer with 0 diverse taste"
""
"Overall - A (small) step up from domestic lagers, but only marginally better than the likes of Canadian and Blue which is pretty much what this beer is being targeted towards. Pass."

"Final Grade: 3.24, a C+. Sleeman Cream Ale is a boring, utilitarian macro ale. I will drink this again at some point, but it's never going to be something I consume regularly. I'm starting to appreciate this one more in my old age - I used to be a Honey Brown guy, but this one is far less cloyingly sweet, with a cleaner flavour than the Original Draught. A passable macro at a decent price point; I like to stock up on cans of this when it goes on sale, as it's something mundane that I can leave in the fridge and offer to visitors that prefer 'the regular stuff'."
""
"Bottled from a Sleeman mix pack. 5%. A passable patio-macro beer and the price is right. Pale, clear, w/ a white head. Aroma is kind of corny/ vegetable-like. Has a light sweetness, light body, creamy, average carbonation. Inoffensive, but nothing worthy of real praise."

"Overall - I would take the sleeman silvercreek over this. At least that was refreshing, this one just has too much skunkiness."
""
""
"AKA: ""She Man Cream Ale"""
""
"Aftertaste is, not surprisingly, a little more bitter but still very refreshing like all the Sleeman beers are. This ranks a little higher than the Original Sleeman, but It's a bit of a downgrade because this is a pretty poor cream ale - but a good pale lager. They should just market it as that."
"O - Pass go, collect and move on... Nothing worthy here from a flavour profile, but it's an easy drinking macro brew that's disguised as a craft ale. Don't be fooled."

"O-what I kind of expected. Not a great cream ale but hit the main aspects."

"It is what it is: pedestrian for the beer geek, perhaps, but comparable to the slew of retro Lagers that are available now. Within the American Cream Ale style, this one ranks high. We envision a heaping plate of chili cheese nachos with fried jalapeño rings--or just a few cold ones on a hot summer day."
"WOW! Cream Ale (64) I thought I was going to get something that would totally amaze me. Hahahahahaha, was I mistaken. Honest guys, this is no rare beer by any means. It excels in nothing except 5% alcohol. I just got back from Panama and drank every Panamanian beer I could and would rate any of them better than this Canadian brew. Sorry if the truth hurts, but that's the way it is!"
"Gold color with a wispy head and light prickle. The nose is like malted snow. My wife described it as a scent that reminded her of the VFW on bingo night. Creamy attack and a bold flavor of cream. It is a very macrobrew-esque offering except that perhaps it is a little bit more ""bold"" than many macrobrews."
"A pretty refreshing beer that would do much better on a hot day than any other time. Nothing spectacular, but a decent session beer that I certainly would not turn away."
"Drinkability: Better than the standard mass produced beer, but not something that needs to be drank whenever possible."
"This beer really didn't have much greatness about it. I liked it the least of all in the mix pack. Mostly bland dark malt tones. Nothing all that pretty or tasty."
"(rated Jan 4, 2008)"
"Simple is good with this one. Pours a medium light golden yellow with a thin white head and good carbonation. Aroma is subtle, creamy, and light with a slight malt nose. Mouthfeel is good and filling with a crisp finish. Flavor is very appealing. Easy simple and delicious, nice beer."
"light to mid body. good carbonation. seems to fit style description. not a lot of depth. i am new with cream ales. would not go out of my way to buy this. may buy another sampler 12er in the future though."
"D: Nice drinkability, sweet, and worth a try."
"Pours a clear light amber with fast fading white head. Smell: alcohol and grains. Taste: grains, alcohol, slight tannin-ness. Mouthfeel: watery thin and harshly crisp with a slimy finish. Basically it tastes like a poor attempt at a cream ale, watery and too much alcohol upfront for 5%. Not even on the Genny Cream level."
"D- I mean... it was very average. I suppose it's light enough that one could drink a couple. Not my favorite, not horrible. It wasn't what I was expecting. I would recommend it if offered by a friend or something, but not of high enough quality that I plan on purchasing again."
"Overall, tastes more like a bad farmhouse ale to me with the sour notes I get. Not terrible but not great either."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Grassy nose. Flavor is almost sweet, grass, hay some hops. Boring. $1.45 for a 340ml bottle from John's Marketplace Portland, OR."
"I find no redeeming qualities in this beer. It's a light beer, a light beer that costs $10 a six pack. I know I'm sounding like a broken record with this one, but I would rather have an MGD, which I consider having superior carbonation and at least tastes and smells like a weak pilsner, not a glass of white wine. I won't spill it out, oh no, since I could use it to wash dishes, water the plants, or at the very least its like 5% abv water, which almost sounds like fun...almost."
"The feel didn't seem to match the taste well, though I have no complaints."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a very light yellow, with a thick head. Smell was light, but had a distinct ""dustiness"" to it, rather unflattering. Taste was completely unremarkable. Nothing there, really. Left a slight coat in my mouth. I felt there really wasn't anything exciting about it at all. Not terrible, just boring."
"The mouthfeel finishes in sort of the same way as a cream soda, which is sort of expected. But it's thin, watery, and bubbly. I think this is the beer Stone had in mind for its ""Fizzy yellow beer is for wussies"" slogan. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
"D: this product is a deception 'cause it's the flag bearer of Sleeman Brewery"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. This is a really interesting beer. Not that WOW interesting but that where is everything, interesting. There is barley an aroma...just a bit of sweetness. Taste is almost nonexistent. Honestly the most memorable thing is the carbonation. Quite a bit of it. It kind of tasted like a toned down version of beer mixed with alka seltzer."
"Wasn't impressed with this beer. Not too good of smell to it. Nothing strong, just a regular beer. The taste wasn't stong to it and was slightly bitter. I think it was a couple months past it's prime. I wasn't impressed and the people I drank with weren't impressed either. Average to subaverage beer."
"Purchased from beergeek.biz"
"Overall, it's better than the BMC gray water. It's a good thirst-quencher."
"Sleeman Cream Ale (64*) pours a light orange color with a thick white head from a brown 11.5 ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy and has that green apple type smell which is quite prominent. The flavor also has that same green apple thing. It's quite grainy, with a little touch of bitterness toward the end."
"Drinkability: Worth a try...it's a lot like a light lager. Not bad"
"Overall, ..well... i guess ice cold it's not to bad,probably one of the better Sleeman's....it's worth a try."
"Now it's merely okay. But it's a big world out there."
"This beer was not good. Every time I cross the border I try and pick up a taster, just out of curiosity. I should quit, cause they've been nearly overwhelmingly bad. This is a light yellow beer with a finger of white head that dissolves really fast. Nose is weak, mostly grain and some sweet malt. Flavor is honey, malt, and candy. There's nearly no hop character. Body is thin. I guess this one's alright for a thin, quickly pound-able beer, but for something to taste, look elsewhere."
"I have to confess that my arm was twisted when I drank this ale. I was offered a choice between Heineken, Molson and Sleeman. Sleeman sounded like the best choice at the time but after drinking it I think I should have chosen Molson? It poured in a golden yellow colour with lots of creamy foam, and smelling sour mixed with crackers, peaches and some lemon. So far, so good. But the taste had a weird syrupy sweetness that did not mix well with the strong bread note. On top of that I found it to be watery. It's not an ale that I can recommend."
"D - This isn't bad. It seems to be fairly standard for the style."
"Feel is watery and yet a bit creamy and bubbly in the background. Overall, it's just dully. Really bland and watery. Nearly flavorless. Very little distinguishes it from the most mediocre of American macros."
"To be honest, I didn't expect much from Sleeman Cream Ale (64*). I can hardly be blamed, though, since these guys have burned me in the past. The brewery's website states that the intention was 'to combine the refreshing taste of a German lager with the distinctive taste of an English ale...'. Mission accomplished. This is a surprisingly worthy warm weather beer."
"The beer pours a light yellow colour (so the bottle isn't hiding anything) with a minimal head. The aroma is thick and hoppy, maybe too hoppy. This beer has way too much carbonation and is harsh on the cheeks. The taste is a mishmash of varying degrees..slightly malty, slightly grassy, slightly awful."
"overall the properties of this beer are rather muted and i think the flavor is too sweet, although i will say it was very refreshing after mowing the lawn"
"Final Statement: First time I had this in cans. The bottles are better because leaving them in the clear bottles makes you feel like you're drinking something refreshing when on a deck in the summer. This beer is my favourite Sleeman brew because it's easy drinking, slightly better than most macros, and a crowd pleaser. Not craft, but not too bad."
"Very lean, tolerant, & quenching. Watered down? Sure, but there is flavor here."
"D - Really boring but I guess it could be worse. I should get my mom to drink better beer."
" ~ I will relax and enjoy drinking this beer. However, I can't see myself pitching another $7.50 towards our northern neighbor just to get a beer that has a cool bottle and 5% alcohol. Sorry."
"Received a six pack of bottles through my beer club. Poured a pale amber without much of a lasting head. Aroma and flavor were average at best...feels like a light lager with little finish. This is not an impressive ale and not one Id purchase on my own (ended up giving two of them away)."
"Had this at the Between the Bluffs Beer Fest. Served with a little head and less lace. Beery bittersweet aroma with traces of hops and malt and definite corn. Yellow color. Bland, but thirst quenching, so some hop. A little body. Well carbonated. Clean. Easy drinking. Slightly bitter finish"
"D: Very easy to drink. Creamy but not too sweet. Good beer to travel with."
"Drinkable, but forgettable. Certainly not worth the import price. If I were in Canada, where it is, presumably, cheaper, it could pass as a mindless ""session"" brew."
"Color is pure gold. Aroma is sickly sweet but its not bad (if that makes any sense). Flavor is of sweet bread with hints of caramel. Fair amount of adjuncts lighten the body and round out the taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and round. Very refreshing and drinkable. However, if you are in the mood for a beer with any amount of hops, move on. This is nearing on a macro-brew, but still quality (for now...stay true Sleeman's!!)."
"Pours a nice golden color with a decent white head that leaves a small trail of lace behind. Not picking up much while smelling. Seems very light and maybe a little metallic. Taste is light to moderate and there is definitely that metallic hint there. Feels bubbly and tingly with some weight to it. Average beer, definitely not the best cream ale I've had. In my opinion it's just an average to above average beer."
"D - Pretty good. This isn't really anything special, but it's really refreshing and drinkable."
"I guess there must be something good about this beer and it's the mouthfeel; right balance of carbonation and body making it fairly drinkable if you don't want to have to think about your beer. I must stress, there is nothing about this beer that is bad/unpleasant per se, however I'm having difficulty coming up with anything good either. One and done."
"A bottle of this mysteriously showed up in my beer fridge. Pours a golden color with virtually no head or lacing. Smell is like apple cider, no skunkiness detected. The apple cider follows through with the flavor as well, except it has a sour note to it. Tastes more like a sour hard cider though there is a touch of sweetness that sails in on the tail. Not something I would buy in the future, in fact this is one of the worst beers I've had in some time. The last inch or so was a drain pour."
"Drinkabilty: not impressed with this. There are many better cream ales, most likely served at your local brewpub."
"I'm not sure what the difference between Sleeman Cream Ale and Sleeman Cream Ale 64 is except that one is in the standard Sleeman clear bottle, and the other is in brown glass. It pours the expected clear golden body and creamy white head. Retention and lacing are average. Aroma is average. The taste is average. In fact, nothing seems to stand out at all about this beer. It has a very generic malt and hop flavor that could just as well be almost any American-style lager. There is an edge to it, however, and perhaps that's because it's an ale - and if it is, it's one really clean ale for sure! There is more bitterness to it, I'll give it that, but it's still below pilsner levels. I guess it does have some drinkability to it though, if you look at it as being unoffensive and quaffable. Still, it's kind of boring and, overall, unremarkable."
"The pour was a clear golden with a bright white foamy head the settles to a respectable lace. Aroma was to be expected with light malt corn. Flavor was also expected with the same light malt and corn. However, I was also picking up some sweet almost fruity flavors that I didn't exactly know what to make of. Mouthfeel and drinkability were both average for this style. Overall, I would go far out of my way to get a bottle of this brew, but it is worth a try to further science. I would like help with ID'ing the sweet flavors."
"I've never seen this brewery at the store I work at, Total Wine in Fort Myers, FL, but I was certainly up for trying something different. I poured the beer into a Coca-Cola glass and noted it's golden color. The smell is mildly of strawberries. It has sort of a creamy, low carbonation, fruity taste that finishes ever so slightly bitter. I purchased a sample pack that included the IPA, porter, and pale ale which I all have yet to try and review. IF you ever come across this beer, it's worth a taste."
"All of the sleeman's beers that I have tried are just the same, watered down."
"This is a drinkable beer, and would be good any time, especially on a hot day. Im not much on the style, but this one seems like a good representation. I would probably have it again."
"D: Awful. I need a Bud or Corona or something to chase this one. Yuck."
"D - Sure, why not. Pleasantly surprised for a cream ale. Basically, I don't expect much from the style so compared to expectations, this was excellent. Certainly the best cream ale I've had."
"Taste was absolutely not creamy. I don't know where this name came from. It is just a 'normal' blond beer and not even a very good one. It is mild, hoppy and has some malt in there. If it would be catagorized as a blond, I would rate it higher. Too bad!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is light bodied. The beer is well carbonated. Frankly I dont like it. The beer is easy to drink. This probably wouldnt be bad lawnmower beer on a hot day. I think I will try a different beer next time."
"Originally reviewed April 9, 2005. On tap at the Gitchee Gumee Brewfest 2005. Wow, this is one of the most putrid beers Ive ever had. It stinks of bad fruit and must. Tastes bland and skunky, even on tap. Extremely watery and almost painful to drink."
"One of the four selections in the Sleeman Selections 12 pack. Distinctive clear Sleeman bottle, red neck label. Pours a clear orange/yellow color. Nice creamy white head, although it is a fairly short stack of foam, there is good stability and nice lace. The smell is grainy with a bit of earthy, floral grass in it. The flavor has some sweetness. There is the typical grains and a slight touch of skunk from the clear bottle. A tiny hint of metallic aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy, but still kind of thin and watery. Good, but not great. All Sleeman products are slightly better than Molson/Labatt offerings. Overall score is still 'not recommended', there are lots of better cream ales out there."
"Well, if nothing else, this sure as heck is a cream ale: the body is great. Too bad it's too darn sweet to kick back more than one at a time."
"It has been pointed out by my drinking buddy that I taste coffee and chocolate in every dark brew and high alcohol aftertaste and sour squid and balsamic vingear or some such foreign thing to beer in every thing we drink. I guess this might be true but I could have sworn that with this beer I tasted the grapey-grapey-grape of Grolsch in here and something akin to Michelob without the grimy feel of a lobotomy. My heart said that a Cream Ale (having never tasted one) would taste like a milkshake or as my friend suggested, a creme soda, but it tastes more like a typical mass-produced beer but minus the playing deck of cards looking label and a heart (as small as it is) that at least tries to sing."
"A very drinkable beer and an excellent example of the style. Essentially a much smoother Genny Cream Ale."
"This one is drinkable, but again, not worth picking up."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light pale malt and adjunct scent that is a bit sweet along with a dry aroma. The taste is average also. It has a very dry flavor that boasts of pale malts and adjuncts. It's a bit sweet on the way down, but finishes dry and musty. The mouthfeel is terrible. It is a low bodied beer with loads of carbonation. This is a beer for the scrap heap. It needs more malt content and a little less carbonation."
"Pours yellow to light gold. Sweet corn & rice smells mix with a sour? smell. Taste is starchy sweetness with a little skunkiness. A hint of bitterness and alcohol at the finish. As it warms the starchy sweetness is more pronounced. Very little body to speak of."
"Totally clear yellow with an awfull head. Smells of grains and minerals. Taste is mostly just crappy malts, with a hint of sourness and minerals. The mouthfeel is pretty much just foamy water. Overall I am dissapointed, mostly because I had high hopes. It is drinkable, but not enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel- Very light for any so called ale I've had. This was not a good intro into cream ales. But I'll continue to try."
"Still, it drinks fairly easily and could appeal to some."
"Pours a very pale yellow straw color with a minimum white soapy head. The smell is a bit funky, through that you get hints of rye and grain, small amount of lemon. The taste is light and smooth, it is light refreshing, I expected more. If to pair with food I found it nice with a good Chicken Caesar salad. Clean and drinkable in hot sticky summer heat."
" Not a beer I'll look for in twelve packs in the future, methinks. Still, the taste partially redeems this beer although it's still resides in ordinary city."
"Another in the series of beers brewed from a nearly forgotten little black book of pre-prohibition family recipies (do you sense my skepticism?) Without doing a side-by-side, I couldn't be sure, but I really don't know that this is much different, if any, from the regular production cream ale. A bit tinny and tired, with poorly melded flavors. The end result is both harsh and boring."
"BTW, I'm not sure what the difference is between this being the "" cream ale 64"" and the regular cream ale."
"11.5 oz thick brown bottle pours a clear dark golden color with a small creamy white head that leaves little lacing in my glass. Grainy, soapy aroma, light grainy, honey flavors, almost no flavor at all. Medium bodied with a slick and coating mouthfeel, finishes with a mild sweetness."
"EDIT: Tried one of these again recently (thanx to my friend Shawn for the brew) and I think it was definitely better. Still not great, but not as harsh as in the past."
"Mild and slightly musty aroma of malt, with light hops. Pours a clear bubbly light gold with a small diminishing off-white head. Flavor is decent. Creamy and smooth, it starts off mild and bland and ends with a faint hop or bitter ? note. Theres nothing bad about it but theres nothing particularly good about it either. Slightly above average at best."
"Pours amber clear with some precipitating carbonation. Large, foamy white head that lingers is unfortunately the best part of this beer. Unimpressive nose of light hops with some citrus, typical of a macro lager. Flavor is not bad but not good; mild malts and hops predominate. There is a slightly bitter aftertaste, but not much. Mouthfeel is watery and fairly bubbly, but anything but creamy. Above average drinkability; this is a typical lawn mowing beer. Marginally better than your typical macro lager."
"Smooth, rich, and creamy.Very nice, drinkable beer. Worth a try. Don't let it get warm. It definitely needs to stay cold."
"A solid beer to begin a session. Looks medium straw in color and pours a white cap of loose bubbles that hold for a little while. Smells modestly sweet and vegetable like. Faint yeastiness and earthyness. tastes lightly sweet and corn like. Follows up with a powdery sweetness like powdered sugar. Feels slightly slick and buttery to the palate. Light body that remains consistent through the finishes. Finishes also crisp and fresh."
"Clear, light golden amber, thin off-white lace of head. Sweet, grainy malt aroma, some floral hops as well. Sweet maltiness, almost like marshmallows, dominates the flavour. Mild bitterness and medium length, sweet finish. Slightly creamy texture. One of Sleeman's better offerings and a good beer to transition friends away from industrial lagers."
"This one is very similar to Little Kings Cream Ale which I always thought was a made up style. Apparently it's not. It is very grainy in aroma and flavor and has the same oily mouthfeel as the aforementioned cream ale along with the creamy aftertaste. There are no fireworks here and it is not incredibly drinkable either. I would certainly drink it again if my choices were extremely limited."
"Pours a clear golden with a white head that vanishes quickly, very little lace. Aroma was a bit floral and a bit of alcohol, the second Sleeman product I have noticed this. Taste was a sweet front, and a fair amount of hops in the finish, nothing terrible, in fact, rather good. Mouthfeel was a little creamy (duh!), and the ABV was well hidden in the taste. This is a good swilling beer, but nothing to write home about."
"The word ""Sleeman"" just sounds dirty for some reason. Pours a clear light gold color with a thin white head that was gone quickly. Very little lacing. The aroma is lightly skunky and sweet at the same time. Light-bodied and kind of fizzy with a nondescript flavor. Bland hops and vague sweetness here and there is about it. The finish is clean, bubbly and faintly sweet. Doesnt do much for me."
"Crystal clear golden yellow with a pure white head that left some lacing. Clean aroma with a slight sweet malt and floral hop, and mild bready yeast as it warmed. The flavor is also clean, no skunk even with the clear bottle. There is a nice malt flavor hear, not dominated by sweetness, and not dried out with adjuncts. The beer is smooth with a light, but noticable body, and a quick finish. This is a well done cream ale that is ideal for a summer barbecue."
"the clear bottle is a mistake imo"
"Pours a crystal clear glod with a nice 2 finger head and ok lace. A timid aroma of sweet malt that is mixed with some riciness. As a cream ale its OK. Not bad flavor for such a macro, but not super flavorful. A nice sweet malt flavor that has a bit of rice added, followed by a decent hop bitterness that balances OK. Finishes dry. A very drinkable beer but not one if you are looking for something better than average. As a macro cream ale its OK, but there are much better ones out there."
"Am I missing all the good beer in Canada???"
"A cheap beer to drink with little in terms of satisfaction. Why drink at all?"
"Sweet clean malt nose. Very carbonated light gold tranparent look in the pint glass. Airy pale white head on the pour.. this head dissapates quickly. Plainish flat malt taste on the tongue. There is some sweetness there but no other complexity. Slight cardboard (oxidized) finish. Medium mouth. Not a future purchase again for Frank..."
"The beer after is escape from the 330ml clear bottle resides in my glass a crystal clear gold with a smallish bright white semi-creamy head after is dissolution, the lace forms a thin veil to obscure the glass. Nose is sweet malt; fresh with the start sweet and the grain profile light, top is thin. Finish is modestly carbonated and the hops run of the mill, a drinkable and refreshing beer and to me that means a lot."
"Bottle: Poured a light yellow ale with a thin white bubbly head thats disappearing way too fast. I can already smell skunk has a poured the beer. The taste is quite weak with a mix of light malt and a weak creamy feeling. This is truly a bad beer (could be a bad bottle but what do people expect with clear bottle!!!)."
"At first taste, I thought I was drinking a bud for a second. Had to look twice at the top label to make sure I'm drinking the right stuff here. Anyway, pours out a pale gold color with some carbonation visible. Smell consisted of sweet caramel with some slight hops in the background. Or I hope those were hops. Taste wasn't all that great. Some cream can be tasted, but for the most part it was quite clean to my disappointment. Light body. Still have one more bottle left, so I guess I'll have to suck it up and drink it. But a cream ale? Please, go pick up some Rogue cream ale and see what a real cream ale is supposed to be."
"Very grainy and proud on the tongue. Perfect light golden color and strong ""beer"" taste. Smells like beer, tastes like beer. Nothing really stands out to make this a special drink, and unfortunately all styles are very similar. I include the cream ale, honey brown lager, silver creek lager and original dark into this review."
"This is an ok beer on drinkability. There's nothing really awful about it, but there's nothing great about it either."
"these sleeman's offerings are totally lame. don't even waste your time on these adjunct ridden, syrupy sweet ""beers""."
"Wow. That word describes this brew best. Smooth flavor and very refreshing. Strong notes of corn and a hint of hops. Short lived head and medium carbonation. Had some of this over in Canada and was pleased to find it's now available state side. Worth the price (about 7.50 a sixer) and a marked step up from what one would expect from Canadian beers. Highly recommended."
" Poured a crystal clear dark straw color with a virtually non-existent cap that refused to lace and only formed a small ring. Highly carbonated. Aromas of boiled hop and some things that dont belong in beer (like corn or rice...or cabbage? ). Started sharp because of the high carbonation, light malt taste, some astringic hops with a fizzy mouth feel then a dry watery finish. Not really much better than Labatts 50 just marketing and packaging differences. This is a good beer for frosh belching competitions."
"first time i had this ale thought it was quite good, the ale was served in a frosted glass, the cream ale held a head through out the glass, smell very light, mouthfeel thin for a cream ale,drinkability after a couple would have like too have a couple more but no the wife, you know."
"I tried this once and it taste horrible. I thought that maybe it was skunked. So I tried it again, still horrible. After reading other reviews I think it just might be the beer and not the clear bottle (WHY!?). Well, this beer simply smelled and tasted pungent. Pilsner like skunkiness times 10. Real grainy taste in the mouth and some residual sweetness. Strong alcohol flavor, which is weird since it's very moderate in abv. A slight creaminess in the middle was the only thing I liked about this beer. Not recommended."
"Drinkability: Not too bad, overall. A good session beer, but lacking in anything to really savor. This is a drinkin' beer that is the equivalent of elevator muzac."
"Ok because of creamy taste/mouthfeel but nowhere near a Creemore. Dry, crisp. Better than mediocre national brands, of which Sleeman is now #3. Oily taste with cream, like a latte. Ok pour. Dried out my mouth. Mates ranked it about the same or a tad higher."
"Cream Ales are an underrated style. I'd like to see more local brewers try their hand at brewing this style. Sleeman products have just recently started to show up in force in the Motown area. I look forward to trying their other offerings."
"Not a bad ale, this light amber brew came with a thin off-white head and minmal lace. The nose is light a gives mostly a malt sense with a small hint of hops. The flavor is pleasant if not overly impressive. The feel is creamy and medium with a strong, crisp finish and ending dryness. Drinkable and enjoyable, though better are certainly available."
"Pours out a golden colour with a head that disappears. Nose of malt, hops and something. Kinda creamy but not exactly. Still, It has a pleasant taste. It worked well with a light lunch (ham sandwich and chips). It is slightly above average. Worth having around when there is extra cash."
"One thing about Sleeman's is that they make their beer average and consistent. The Cream Ale, being one of their flagship beers, holds true to this. Pours out of the classic clear embossed bottle (why clear guys?) a clear bright golden hue, snap, pop, fizzle for a head which immediately disappears. Grainy malt on the nose with the slightest hint of hops. Flavour is malty crisp, with a small finish of hops, pretty straight forward, nothing unique or spectacular about it. Mouthfeel is somewhat oily, although I could handle this as a session beer, even if it wouldn't particularly be close to my top choice as one. But it's pretty good as an average beer posing as a cream ale ."
"Notes: Too harsh for me. A bit boring as well  there is no need to back to this one for me."
"Taste: Fizzy, yet creamy. Not exactly round, but it's not a light-bodied beer either. A creamy sweetness, with some graininess. Neither impressive nor offensive. Will not purchase again."
"Flavor is sweet, malty, and slightly sugary. Very little hop presence. Some sweet caramel and honey flavors. Body is light, with rather pleasant carbonation. Very nice mouthfeel. Tasty, despite it's initial sweetness. I don't think I'd buy this again, but I'd drink one if it's offered."
"Clear medium gold color with a 1/4 inch pale head of very slight duration. A pretty distinct caramel and brown sugar malty sweet aroma, hinting at either malt complexity or cloying properties. The flavor doesn't cash in on the aroma one way or the other -- cane sugar and a slight sense of flowery honey. Medium carbonation and very little hop sense to balance. Drinkable enough< I suppose, but the sugar water in the hummingbird feeder might be almost as satisfying. Still, as a Cream Ale, an OK beer here..."
"I was expecting a craft-brewed taste, but got something that just marginally tops Labatt or Molson. Underwhelming."
"Light, clean aroma, with hints of grains. The taste is unremarkable. Somewhat grainy, with slightly sweet malts present only deep into the quaff. Long lasting biscuity aftertaste. Some minimal hopping, actually significantly less than I had anticipated. The so called creaminess of this beer is very much absent, at least to me. Spectacular in its ordinariness."
"In the mouth, it's a cream ale. Smooth, creamy, light, and refreshing. This is very drinkable, though unremarkable. I didn't find it overly filling, but then I just had the one bottle."
"F."
"Had this in a can while on a fishing trip. Cans are much more convenient in the outdoors. Anyways, I brought my glass so I can pour it while at lunch. WOW!!! Sleeman from a can smells good. Very smooth and malty scents are marching up my nose before I even tilt the can. Ahh, now in the glass. Hmm, good head, amber colour. Similar to the bottle version. Taste. Huh? Where is the taste? I can smell malt, why can't I taste it. This was bland. Perhaps it was a bad can. I don't know. Mouthfeel. Their was a mouthfeel? It was too unoffensive to leave a mouthfeel. I give it a higher drinkability rating because it is drinkable like diet sprite. The bottled version was better. I honestly hope I just had a bad can."
"Nevertheless: one-and-a-half thumbs up. Sure beats Molson Canadian."
"I like Sleeman's unique bottles but I wish they weren't clear. This beer is a crystal clear golden with a small but thick head. Touches of grain and sweet malts in the aroma, pretty reserved though. There's nothing special and exciting about the flavor, but it's definitely a very crisp and refreshing experience. It's a great alternative to the macros and very easy to drink."
"Color is golden yellow, sort of hazy. Smells sweet and light of maltyness and a hint of hops and vanilla. Taste generally the same as the smell. Fairly light, good body though, with a nice sweet malt and notes of slight hop and vanilla. Very smooth, crisp, and clean, coats the tongue and mouth with creamy sweetness. Not bitter in the least. I couldn't stop drinking this stuff. Highly drinkable with a burger and fries or for picnics and outdoor backyard BBQ's. Very good Cream Ale."
"Go Sleeman's....ya got a winner here!!!"
"Good head and nice lace on an otherwise unimpressive beer.  Not bad, mind you, just nothing out of the ordinary.  Not very complex, but very smooth.  Typical Canadian yeasty aftertaste."
"better than average and the best of the sleeman line.  this still seems a bit mainstream.  not much hop taste, not much hop nose."
"This is very light beer. A notch above the macros."
