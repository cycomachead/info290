Aroma is sweet sugary maltiness mostly with light sweet orange fruitiness and little to no hop. The flavor is sugary sweet maltiness with hints of fruit and little to no hop flavor or bitterness. The only thing cutting through the massive sweetness of this beer is the carbonic acid form the carbonation. This is a one and done beer.","johnnnniee","Sep 27, 2014"

3.53,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Another beer courtesy of woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a touch of sweetness. Taste is crisp, malty, creamy, a touch of hops, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer.","tone77","Feb 07, 2013"
3.52,4.8,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.5,"I went with my soon-to-be-patented Crack & inverted Glug which produced two short-lived fingers of foamy, bone-white head. I will say that it did leave some beautiful lacing in its wake, however. Color was a golden-yellow with a very slight haze, but just enough to be noticeable. This had a pleasant malty sweetness to the nose, suggesting an all-malt cream ale, which is a nice change of pace. Mouthfeel was medium and there was a grassiness to the hops that worked well with the malt to create an eminently drinkable beer. Finish was semi-dry and very refreshing. Once more, thanks to it relatively low ABV, I CAN easily envision myself drinking this on a hot summer's day or better, with a fresh soft pretzel.","woodychandler","Jan 02, 2013"

3.53,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Enjoyed with dinner at Trio's restaurant in Narragansett, RI, this brew presents a pale gold color with a giant white pile of foam and plenty of lacing. The aroma brings a subtle floral lemon blend that is pleasant but a bit too polite perhaps. The flavor offers a biscuit wheat and somewhat watery cabbage sort of deal. Kind of musty skunky, a papery wheat. It’s light bodied but offers a nice, evenly carbonated feel that refreshes and finishes with a dry tongue. The flavor is somewhat unique, a bit perfumey, not really my thing but definitely not a bad brew. Worth trying.","Durge","Sep 05, 2012"

3.88,15.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12oz. can served in an nonic. Pours a translucent straw gold with a one inch, bright white head. Nose expresses sweet cereal grains and perhaps a slight buttery quality. Taste consistent with nose - there's almost a buttermilk character that comes out towards the middle and gradually drops off leaving some residual grainy notes. Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation that asserts itself just enough to tickle the tongue and palate. I don't have a lot of experience or depth with this style, but this is a very simple and drinkable brew without much complexity. An easy session beer for the summer that would go great with grilling.","Jwale73","Jun 22, 2012"
