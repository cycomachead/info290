"o: Enjoyable but not a beer to rejoice over. Having said that...I had several of them."

"Pours a straw yellow with a nice white head with decent retention. The smell is full of malt sweetness with light citrus, orange peel, on the nose. The taste was very pleasant with hints of sweet cream from the malt and then a nice bite from the citrus hops. Well balanced and easily enjoyable."
""
"NOTHING about this Ale jumps out at you....It doesn't taste BAD but it ends VERY watery.....almost flat. One and Done for me..."

"Overall, this is hot weather bear and lawnmower beer. It has just enough tiny peaks of distinctive flavor where you are ok with it as you go thru the pint. Terrific structure, but I don't buy beer to just look at it. Had half the pint alone, then had the rest with a simple grilled burger, which completely dominated the beer to the point where I could have been drinking water. Lacks the richness of a true cream ale and intensity of flavor, but nothing you will hate either. Accept it if offered one, but don't seek this out."

"Pours a hazy orange / yellow with a medium lasting white head. Aroma and Taste has some citrus, lemon fruity notes, biscuit malt, yeast with some citrus floral hops notes. Palate is nice medium body, crisp with lively carbonation. Finish is sweet biscuit malt, fruity with some citrus and lemon flavor, some light tartness and a bit of spicy citrus floral hops for balance. Overall a good crisp and refreshing summer style ale"

"O - not bad, a decent representation of the style. There are better out there, but it's worthy of a glass."

"I have another one of these that I will try later, and if it's different, I will edit my review"

"Overall - This is a pretty good beer. I don't know how it's considered a cream ale though. It has the texture but not the flavor.."
""
""
"O: Forgettable. Like um... can't think of his name. Brown hair? Glasses? Had a beard. He definitely had a beard. You know who I mean. Anyway, Hooker is capable of making better beer than this and I wouldn't recommend it over anything else in their lineup."
""
""
""
"O - The green grape, white vinous character is a bit one-sided, but drinks easy."
""
"Overall, this beer isn't good. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, but I really don't care for this."
""
"Pours with three finger head. Has slight skunky aroma and taste. Started the pour down the side and the color looked very promising until the head started to form. Takes a long time for it to settle leaving a slight orange /tan tint to the head. I liked the unfiltered appearance for this blonde ale. 100 beer club was eager to try and left disappointed."

"O: This beer is extremely easy to drink and very sessionable. It’s a good selection for a hot summer day."
"D - This one doesn't do much for me... It's a very ""average"" beer in all categories... I can see how this could be a gateway beer for the BMC crowd, but their isn't much more to offer... It's a shame because I would love to order a ""blonde hooker"" every now and again..."
"12oz bottle. Pours a semi-murky dark yellow color with a thin layer of head. Aroma is tangy with some breadiness. Slight bit of hops. Taste is more of that tangy bread flavor. Small amount of hop flavor. Hard to pick up on too much else since the tangy flavor dominates. Hints of citrus. Lightly carbonated with a watery mouthfeel. Overall, nothing special. No need to revisit this one."
"Pours a hazy yellow, mustard color. Small head, fairly good lacing. Has a sharp start taste but very smooth finish. A full bodied beer. Average drinkability. Would probably try again but not as my first choice."
"For what this is, it’s not bad.. but also not great character either."
"Pours a very, very clear light straw color with a thin white head. The head immediately recedes and doesn't leave much of anything behind. The nose carries a very light amount of grain and straw; nothing too much else. The flavor is light grain and straw. There's a touch of very light hopping, but really not all that much. Light body with moderate carbonation. Some bitterness in the finish. Okay."
"D - Well, this one is hard to judge; it has almost certainly gone bad, but in a way that seems to have made it better than it probably was when it was fresh. It has become just slightly sour and the herbal, spicy hops work nicely with everything else. I know that this isn't what a ""blonde"" ale is supposed to taste like, but it actually makes a pretty nice farmhouse ale. I guess my conclusion has to be: if you buy Thomas Hooker Blonde, age it for a while and it will turn into a pretty decent saison!"
"Overall an all right beer but nothing blowing me away. Better beers for the price, but a decent offering for the ""blonde cream"" nonetheless."
"Medium + effervescence, medium body leaning fuller. Some vanilla shows up in the aftertaste with a good malt/hop balance. A decent beer, hopefully better on tap. Nothing makes it stand out."
"It looks good enough at first glance. A nice golden yet thin looking pour with little head. It is an easy drinker that goes down easy. My biggest complaint is the lack of overall taste. I imagine I would have enjoyed quaffing this down after mowing the lawn on a hot summer's day. It is crisp and light."
"Cheers!"
"golden with a small white head. lagerish smells with the slightest hint of vinegar. tastes a little on the sweet side, again with a hint of vinegar. a little bit of citrus and acid. very thin on the mouth. this beer is very different. while it tastes like a lager it has a tingle on the mouth and some different flavors going on. It's a decent beer. nothing to get too excited about and I probably won't voluntarily purchase another."
"Hm, it's usually blonde hooker, not Hooker Blonde. (Honestly, that one made me laugh pretty decently when I thought of it...) It pours a bright gold with an intimation of haze (maybe more of a rumor) and topped by about a finger of white foam. The nose comprises bright corn syrup, wheat, and a very light dash of coriander. The taste ramps up the coriander, adding some lemon zest and cardamom, while maintaining the slight wheatiness and keeping the corn syrup to a necessary minimum. The body is decidedly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly refreshing feel. Overall, a nice bit o' summery goodness."
"Creamy mouthfeel with a decent spritz. I'd describe this as a floral (if a little grainy) malt flavor. There's light hop providing some balance, particularly in the swallow. The aftertaste, however, is brief."
"Pours a spritzy pale golden yellow color with nice cap of white head, good retention and lacing. Scent brings a suprising amount of grassy hops with notes of pale straw, white bread. Taste again suprises, with a definite grassy and earthy hop presence over the pale strawlike backbone, hints of white bread. Lighter side of medium bodied, good carbonation level. A nice suprise, great warm weather drinker."
"I like the Thomas Hooker brand and these guys do a nice job. This blonde ale is fairly generic, but enjoyable none the less."
"D - Semi-light, it does have a noticeable body and density."
"poured an orangish golden color, with 1"" white head that quickly disapates. It almost smells more like a wheat beer, but not exactly. the taste is a little bready, with slight undertone of hops. kinda bland. higher carbonation, thin mouthfeel. is a decent summer brew, light flavor and easy to drink"
"Feel/Drink: Thin mouthfeel, great sunmer drinkability."
"On tap at the Yard House in Dedham. Served in a standard pint glass. Cloudy yellow body. Thin white head. Slight smell of citrus, though faint to the point of nonexistence. Taste was decent for a blonde ale. Lightly hopped with a hint of citrus. Mouthfeel was thin and but not really watery - it had just enough body for a blonde. A nice beer for the summer or while eating an appetizer, like I was. Easily drinkable."
"D - A nice light summer beer. A lot of bars in my area that have crap on tap will have this one because it is very local so it's a safe goto."
"This is a great beer for a hot day. Not sweet, and no aftertaste; just refreshingly clean."
"D- Not bad, though I guess I don't get the differences between a cream ale and a blonde ale, though I do not detect any hops in the finish, so perhaps that's why this is a cream ale? A very approachable beer, best served cold on a hot day."
"D) Meh, not my favorite but on a hot summer day this might be even better."
"Poured a light, decently carbonated gold into an American pint glass, with very thin white head, and spotty lacing. The smell was decidedly sweet...honey and brown sugar. The taste confirmed the smell, with little hop balance and a finish that was hard to characterize. The mouthfeel was thin but carbonated. Could be a decent session beer if it had a little more complexity in the flavor, and a texture to match."
"D: Very high, especially since it was so light and creamy."
"Drinkability was good. There's nothing here to stop you from sessioning. Very easy to drink."
"D - This is a nice cream ale. Just enough sweet and bitter flavors."
"D: This beer was a bit disappointing. Definitely a step up from your typical macro lager, but lacks any depth of flavor."
"On tap at BDL. Pours clear gold with a small white head that disappears quickly. Smells of light, slightly sweet malt followed by faint floral hops without much else to speak of. The taste is again light grain; here the hops barely make an appearance. Characterless and almost flavorless save for the lingering sweet finish. Light body with medium carbonation. Even if it's not harsh and incredibly offensive, the pervasive blandness gives me no desire to drink it . This beer sucks."
"Definitely drinkable. This beer had good taste, good finish, and was a nice clean ale."
"Cream ale? I'm not so sure of that descriptor for the style. This seems like a pretty standard, run of the mill, blonde ale to me with some slight deviations. It pours a nice reasonably clear blondish golden color with not much head and zero lacing. The nose is big time citrus with a malty under belly. The smell is nice, and has none of the metallic, or tinny qualities that are common with the style. The taste has a very slight lemony zing at the front end, but this segues quite nicely into a more malty and bready, almost doughy flavor. There is a grassiness to the beer, a slight lemony and spiced bite, but this is very subtle and it is mollified somewhat by the honeyed qualities that emerge as the beer settles. This is quite a smooth blonde ale that goes down easy. This isn't a complex beer, it is light bodied, refreshing, reasonably carbonated, nothing overly challenging on the palate, and a good summer type ale when the weather gets steamy."
"Drinkability: I think this would be an excellent, sessionable, lawn mower beer...A refined Budweiser that is more tasty--I also think I am drinking a lager...I like more complex beers, but this is good for the style"
"Drinkability: Overall, on a almost 60 degree day in New England this beer felt like it was painted with the picture, a good brew to enjoy on a warmer day. Very sessionable and enjoyable."
"aroma is very fresh, of sweet hay and hops. flavor has mild bitterness, but is above all else, drinkable. recommended."
"The aroma has corn, plastic, yeast, dried hay, and fresh cut grass. The appearance is golden with a really thin head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall it has qualities that I don't like but somehow it manages to be drinkable."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a cloudy straw gold color with a white head. Weak retention a poor lacing .The aroma was dry, an even balance of pale malt and floral hops. The flavors were similar and interesting in their development. First I got a dry grain flavor, soon followed by the floral hops bitterness and a caramel malt sweetness almost right upon each other. The balance was superb. The body was medium/light and the carbonation lively without being prickly. This would be a great beer if only they could make it look better, but flavor wise it is an excellent example of the style and very sessionable."
"A bright gold pour with a frothy but short lived white foam. Nice malty nose with some fruity notes and some hops....a little bit of hay. Tastes of sweet malts, honey, some weak hops, sweet grains. Creamy, easy to drink a few of these. Thanks for the bottle John."
"I had this on tap with dinner in New Haven. The beer was clear golden yellow with almost no head, maybe a couple millimeters worth. In terms of smell and taste this beer had everything I expected and wanted out of it, but there isn't much to express in a cream ale. This was on the sweet side and maltier than it was hoppy, just an easy-drinking craft beer that's perfect with a BBQ or drinking in your backyard (or at a restaurant in New Haven)."
"Thomas Hooker Blonde Ale is listed as a cream ale? Interesting... anywho, it's a little bland and boring. It's very drinkable and all but just lacks on the taste, mostly due to the style here. I wouldn't mind having it again at all but just seems a bit too forgettable."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color, loosely-formed head rises quickly and fades within a minute, a few spots of lacing left behind. Slight herbal hop aroma, grainy/beery smell. Taste is decent, clean malty taste, slightly grassy-tasting hops, and a summer-beer-like lemony character. It's very crisp, not a lot of lingering bitterness, but there is some. You could definitely put back a couple of these in the summer...in fact, right or wrong, I think I'd buy this more (""buy", as in, ""believe", not actually ""purchase"") as a summer release. Is that wrong? Either way, relatively tasty, very easy to drink, and could certainly be used as a ""gateway beer""."
"D, notes: I like this beer. Very sessionable thought it is kind of filling. Quite well balanced. Despite the fact that it is an ale has a clean lager character."
"D- Good beer, very bright and refreshing, definitely a good summer pick!"
"Light, refreshing and flavorful, this is a perfect summertime session brew."
"d- probably have many of these, not bad in and of itself, but ide prolly go for soemthign different"
"Pours a crystal clear straw color with a small white head that dissipated into almost nothingness. The aroma is extraordinarily faint, I don't really pick up anything. At least I don't pick up any negative traits. The taste is of a doughy malt and some grassy hops. Somewhat similar to a Munich lager. No real offputing flavors, though there may be a touch of cooked veggie flavor but it is very light. Th feel is light almost moderate with nice and fizzy carbonation, finishes very neutral. This is a very easy drinking brew"
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer was a hazy yellow color with a small white head that nevertheless left a little bit of lacing. Very fresh, outdoorsy aroma, floral and grain. It tasted sweet, a little bit of hops influence. I always think of summer beers as nice session beers, meant to be enjoyed on hot summer days, and this one fills the bill."
"D- This beer has really nice fresh flavors and a good balance and depth to them. It went down really smooth and fast and is one of the best cream ales I have had."
"Pours a very clear light brown/dark yellow/golden color, with little head. Aroma matches the taste: nice and malty with good hopping. Good sweetness helps make this beer go down very easily. I only had one, but this could be a good session beer on a warm sunny day."
"Overall, this was not bad, nothing really extraordinary, but still not bad at all. I would take one in a pinch, but would not really go out of my way to find it. Still, a solid choice and one that you really cannot go wrong with."
"Overall an easy drinking blonde ale."
"Drinkability is good, a good match for the delicious pizza. As a lighter beer, it is a good beer to start off the night with and then work your way towards stronger beers later in the evening."
"I probably wouldn't get this again unless there weren't any other micro taps. I've had a couple of other Hooker brews, but I think this, the Red and Pale Ales are ones to pass up."
"Pours a slightly fogged gold. Nose is a very faint fruit tone with a faint odd metallic edge. Flavor is kind of sweet with a metallic tone that hits on the back of the mouth. Feels good on the mouth and it's a nice drinker too. I could just do without the whole metallic side of it."
"Very easy to have more then one. This is great to wash down picnic fare. A decent offering in the style. Decent as a beer to bring to a party in the summer."
"Pours a hazy straw color like a hefeweizen. Big highly carbonated white head..on a hard pour it hangs in there for a while. Some lacing. Smell: not much. Tastes like a slightly more crisp and hoppy lager. Not a bad thirst quencher/lawnmower beer, but there is not much more to recommend either. Mouthfeel and drinkability are about average. Not a beer I would seek out. Pleasant tasting enough but pretty ordinary."
"I do not generally grab a blond ale but I enjoyed this one as it was very refreshing on a hot summer night."
"Bottle courtesy of eclectic, thanks again."
"poured into a pilsner glass while at poolside last evening during a cookout which was perfect for this selection. Not one of my first choices but this style has entices me every so often. color was cloudy yellow like that first morning piss. Head was thin and broke into a little ring that maintained throughout, spotty lacing not coating. Mouthfeel was not what i imagined for this style , alittle more carbonation and less smooth than I expected. taste was also a bit of a disappointment , not bad , but was expecting more. This to me is like the good looking girl with the so-so personality. Would pair well with a light fair. Not bad , not great. Forgettable but not regretable."
"Not bad, but leaning towards lackluster. An average-ish cream ale with a nice touch of soft citrus. Not bad for quenching a thirst in the heat of summer, but that's about it..."
"I have had this and the IPA from Hooker, and living in CT, I'm glad to have found something local that I can really get behind. I'm going to go get one of each of the others that these guys make, because I expect them to be very high quality."
"Reasonable drinker. Glad that i had the opportunity to try it. Would feel comfortable serving it to those who have a preference for macros, but want to let their hair down."
"This beer poured nicely with a fair head and little carbonation. Eventhough there was a fine golden color, the body was bit heavier, more like a canadian micro cream ale. The taste was full, dry with just a bite of zest. although some get an aftertaste, I did not. This is an easy drinking brew that is suprising in the taste category, perfect of a spring day."
"The beer pours a gold color with a 1/2"" fizzy white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice pale malt scent along with a semi sweet finish. It's dry with a ""cream ale"" aroma. The taste is decent as well. It has a very dry, pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes clean. This is a very dry tasting beer. The mouthfeel is average. It's a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average blonde ale. It has little character and is very much middle of the road. I hope the other Hooker brews are better than this one."
"A bit cloudy and yellow with a fair white head. You can smell a citrus quality pretty quickly, a slight peppery hint too that seems to carry over into the first mouthful. Pretty crisp feel with a doughy-orange taste. Blondes are not my favorite variety (when it comes to beer) and this one had that tart finish that seems common to most of them. But I enjoyed this one. Fairly light and refreshing while maintaining some character."
"Drinkability - Could definitely quaff a few of these while sitting on the beach in the heat of the summer. Refreshing."
"D: A little tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, this is a perfect beer if you’re looking for something light. It definitely fits into the “lawnmower beer” category."
"This was a bit of a surprise. I definitely enjoyed it, and think this would make an excellent summer working outside beer. Cold, crisp, clean, refreshing, but won't fry your tongue or have you laying facefirst in the kid's sandbox. Could also pair well with light fare such as salad, whitefish, chicken, etc. A nice find, and a beer I recommend trying and enjoying in the summer heat."
"Slightly hazy gold in the pint glass with consistent fine carbonation. Smelled metallic, which was a real turnoff. Also, dough, honey, and toast. I couldn't get over the metal, which was also present in the taste. It starts sweet, gets grainy, and the finish is metallic and dry. Actually, the dryness of the finish is probably the most remarkable thing about this beer -- it's a style that can be cloying, but Hooker's no nonsense where that goes. Even though I find it to be a bit crap for either a blonde or a cream ale, I could certainly put a couple of these back on a warm day due to the light body and the dry finish."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white fizzy head which leaves quickly, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of slight hops, slight grassy wheat, some grapefruit, and slight malts. The taste pretty much follows the nose, slight hoppy/malty, nice little grapefruit flavor. Light body. Drinkable, not a bad little brew, good for a hot summer day."
"This beer pours a pale gold to straw color with a pure white head which laces a bit. The smell is light malts with a hint of wheat and light floral hoppiness from the saaz hops. The taste is light hops with a touch light malty base. The beer is nearly as smooth as a lager but retains just enough malty character to make it taste like a true ale. Carbonation is high but right for the style. Drinkability is good this beer is nothing special but provides a good alternative to macro lagers."
"Good beer. Not great, but good."
"I think the most impressive thing about the Thomas Hooker Blonde is its cleanliness. You know that it's an ale - you can pick that up in the nose - but there is the chance that it could be a lager. Very nice. And it's balanced. So often blonde ales just miss the mark and end up too sweet and/or malty. Not this one. It pours a hazy golden body beneath a creamy bright white head that holds well and leaves some better than average lace about the glass. The nose displays a basic, grainy and straw-like malt with some grassy and lightly floral hops in the back. In the mouth it's medium bodied and crisp. The flavor offers a few more hops (still grassy and floral), but they're very well woven into the overall composition. Not too sweet, not too dry. And the maltiness doesn't stick around in the finish... it's very firm bitterness balances it and ushers in a quick, dry finish with just a swirl of short-lived, residual floral and spicy hops."
"Cheers!"
"Clear golden, corny color with some head and no lacing. Smells malty and lightly hoppy, nothing deep. Some honey in there too. Taste is similar, with a bit more of a hops bite. Mouthfeel is creamy and sudsy, verging on soapy. This is a refreshing brew- ice cold, it's easy to down a few of them. However, there's not a whole lot going on here. It reminds me too much of macro eww."
"Not much to chew on here for someone looking for a craft brew. I'm thinking you're better off saving your money by buying some Molson instead."
"Beer pours a clear golden with minimal head. Smells of hops with mild malt, some creamy notes. Tastes very clean, after taste of hops with a spicey character, odd for a cream ale I thought, but tastey. Not my favorite style, but a good beer overall. I was pleasantly suprised, and I could drink a few of these in a night."
"D: Easy drinking and a good example of cream ale. Worth a try from Thomas Hooker."
"I cant really nail this one down, dont know why. I do know it is enjoyable and is a smooth brew on a hot muggy day."
"-Cheers!"
"Thomas Hooker cream ale is a pleasant brew. It pours from the bottle an ever so slightly hazy golden color. The head does not last long, but this is no major loss. The smell is malty and perhaps also a bit yeasty. The taste is malty sweetness. While there are images of hops on the bottle lable, noticable hops bittering is absent (and thankfully so). Mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant. A nice beer to enjoy, with a very high drinkability. Goes very well with a spicy pepperoni pizza!"
"Taste is a light toasty malt, very lightly hopped. Nutty sweet, some light fruit. Mouthfeel is medium, lighter than other ale styles but heavier than a lager. Drinkability is very high, very sessionable."
"Somewhat hoppy, but not too much. It went down smooth. Overall, a good beer. Nothing overly unique, but tasty and pleasant."
"All in all, this is a highly drinkable, inoffensive cream ale that's a pretty good fit for a warm day and a group of beer lovers who might be new to craft beer. Nothing remarkable here, just a solid example of the style."
"Pours a pale amber with minimal head. The nose is fresh malts and a slightly burnt sugar smell. The beer tastes very smooth, with a creamy, nutty sweetness that's really the only taste going on here aside from a brief wash of hops at the end of the mouthful. There's not much going on here, kind of boring. Mouthfeel is very full and round. This beer would be drinkable if it were more interesting, but without a hook, what's the point? Meh."
"D - smoothly drinkable, a good party beer"
"14K honeyed gold topped with a medium sized white head of small bubbles. Settles fairly quickly to smattering of dust, no lacing, but plenty of carbonation streams. The smell is fairly clean with some grassy hops, relatively light, little in the way of malt. The taste is a touch grainy and sweet, with some spicy hops interspersed. Nicely balanced. Medium bodied and nice mouthfeel, this is a solidly drinkable beer that works. Nothing spectacular, but a great beer for the crossover crowd."
"A rich golden color with very little head. A light hoppy aroma with hints of malt coming through at the end. A nice creamy taste, very mellow flavor, folowed by nice clean, dry, hoppy finish. Light in the mouth, maybe a little watery, but not to thin. This is incredibly drinkable, the light creamy taste helps one mellow out quickly. You can sit back and drink several in one sitting."
"Drinkability: Sessiony, uncomplicated. A decent example of a lighter style of beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a very small head.The smell is a very strong biscuit scent.This is like walking into a bakery.The taste is a creamy crisp hoppy beer.There are some floral and malt flavors that make a light and very well balanced m/f.This is a good summer brew.I could go for another."
"D - Tasty and mild. Great for the style."
"Pours a one-finger white head that goes quickly leaving no lace. Clear pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. No nose. Starts smooth and sweet, finish is mellow, there are traces of hops. This would be a good summer time beer. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"A good entry-level/crossover beer. A good everyday/ hot day beer. A good intro beer to an impressive brewery. Hey, it's not all about Liberator or Old Marley. It's ok to like the little beers."
"Had this one after I tried the Pale Ale, and wish I had reversed my sampling order. This awesome brew has a beautiful color and appearance, with a classic medium-to-full body and great dried-fruit flavors throughout. Fresh buds on the nose round out all of the excellent characteristics of this great ""local"" brew."
"the flavor is the standout of this beer, sweet, good carbonation, smooth and light to medium bodied. I could drink a six of this and not think twice. It would make a great summertime beer."
"this is the second hooker that i've had (i've also had their APA), and it's not nearly as good as the first. it's still good though, don't get me wrong. not 100% sure if i'd want to get this again though. if you haven't had it it's really worth a try. it's interesting."
"Overall I like this quite a bit. A good session / lawnmower beer for sure. Too bad it's starting to get cold here in MA. I could have used this one in August."
"An interestingly simple beer that I surprisingly like a lot. Its a quality summer brew and ultra drinkable."
"Okay, but I cant get past the veggie notes and blanket of blandness that seems to coat my palate. Perhaps this bottle is not as fresh as I thought? Tough to tell with no freshness indicators on the bottle."
"Pours clear golden honey color with a light foamy head that doesn't stick around too long. Lacing is also light and practically vanishes all together before all is done. Smell is light - of creamy, sweet malts, toasty/biscuity aromas. Taste is lightly sweet and creamy, almost bready, with a light hop finish. Crisp and smooth with light carbonation - goes well with the warm weather, although its probably a decent choice any time of year."
" A good little Hooker, this Blonde. And a good trade was had to get one."
"Another hoppy cream ale. Not sure how close to style lines this one might be. But not bad. Pours a not-quite-clear gold with a slight head. Flavor is sweet from malts, but has a nice hop kick to it as well. Also picking up tones of honey and vanilla. Mouthfeel is not as heavy and creamy as the few other cream ales I have tried, but comes across as more-or-less crisp."
"Thanks to MuddyFeet for the opportunity to try this."
"Excells in the mouthfeel. Silky smooth. Makes it very drinkable."
"On-tap at Grant's in West Hartford, CT. It had evaded me on-tap for quite some time so I was happy to find it. I felt it might has been served a bit too cold though. Yellow-golden crystalline body with a thick dense bleached white head that laced well. A bit of sourdough bread on the nose but not much, pleasant but not impressive. The taste was a bit weak and bland for my liking, with very light malting and a bit of sharp tang. However the mouthfeel was very good and creamy, crisp and acid enough too. Very drinkable on the warm summer eve too."
"Pale malt aroma and flavor; biscuity ... almost doughy with a herbal and lemon hop twang. Mild palate with a light crispness, very easy to drink. Not a bad blonde at all ... fitting for this hot weather we are having in Boston."
"A slightly haze on the dark yellow beer. Has a small (now you see it now you don't) white head. The is a light sweet grassy aroma with a nice hint of lemon. There is a light sting of bitterness and some citrus at the start of the flavor. That moves to a smooth malty character. Then to a gentle hop on the finish."
"A hint of pears and some lime-like citrusy tastes adds a bit of balance to this malt-leaning brew. Smooth and freshing!"
"The mouthfeel has a good creamy medium body that flows over the palate oh-so smoothly. An easily drinkable brew that would be great in the summer months. Nothing earth shattering here but definetly worth your time. Thanks to goodbyeohio for bestowing this one upon me."
"Thanks to pete for this beer. It pours a slightly golden yellow color with a finger of head that falls to ring the top. The nose is slightly grassey/grainey witha honey sweetness. Very mellow, no harshness as in other grainey aromas I have experienced. The flavor is spot on to the nose. The grainey hits first, followed by the sweetness that moves back to a slgiht grainey finish. The feel is moderate to thick. Overall, this is a solid blonde. Refreshing and enjoyable all around."
"Hooker Blonde Ale is a solid, drinkable beer that doesn't impress with bells and whistles, but with sheer quality. Cream ales will never be among my favorite styles, but this is one of the best (along with Rogue Honey Cream Ale) that I've had and just might be in my regular rotation if I lived in The Constitution State. Thanks to far333 for the bottle."
"I was surpised to see this listed as a cream ale, but I checked the company website and, sure enough, thats what it is. A well-crafted ale. So often it seems that blonde or golden ales are just pale ale wannabes. Aroma was very fresh, and a little grassy. Poured a bright gold. Flavor profile was nice and lively, bigger malt than I expected with a full but not heavy mouthfeel. Hops were well balanced - a little sharp and lemony. Would be a great session ale. Thanks to far333 for the sample."
"Pours a pale golden color with a light white head leaving no lace. Aromas are a mix of corn and toasted malts which follows with light hops. Flavors are sweet and creamy with a decent dosage of sweet corn with a super light body. The finish is crisp and somewhat bitter with a clean hop bite. Though this brew is fairly light it keeps a decent body with its creamy flavors. Overall a great session beer that to me would make a great opener to introducing people to better beer. A nice offering."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" white head above the polished gold brew. Head is gone in a flash, with lacing minimal to average. Aroma is lightly of pale malts, with a dash of hops. Taste is follows along, with sweet pale malt character, coupled with a crisp hops bite. Have to appreciate lack of off flavors in such a clean brew. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great. A good introduction for people to better, local brews."
"A flavorful version of the style and very pleasant on the palate. Nothing flashy. The style itself doesn't really do much for me, but this version is actually pleasant and a bit tasty."
"Clear light gold, creamy white head stays for a bit and then settles, leaving a tight lace on the glass. Aroma makes me think of a vienna lager because of the strong honey-grain combo with some mustiness I get from some lagers. Flavor starts sweet with the honey accompanied by citrus and vanilla in just the right balance. Floral and spicy hops make a beautiful show. Bitterness appears and creeps in, but still leaves it on the sweet side. Medium body and creamy mouthfeel. Very pleasant drinking, this beer is damn good and will be a regular of mine once they get into Massachusetts."
"Pale golden yellow color with a bright white head that rises to a half inch and slooowly settles down. Aroma is biscuity malt, some pear and butterscotch, and a faint grassy hop line. Flavor is chewy, with light sweet malts, some buttery corn, and a light cinammon backbone. A light hoppy tingle finishes it off, and a roasted corn thing lingers. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, and thin legs of lace run down the lenght of the glass."
"I could drink this all night to be honest. A perfect example of a session brew. But cream ale? More like a golden ale to me. Seek and drink."
"pours a gold straw color with a thin head. aromas were slight, but well balanced malt/hops. Tangy, crisp, refreshing taste. Well balanced, decent body and mouthfeel, mild hop finish. this is an unnasuming beer that was intended for the non-ba thanksgiving guests. All enjoyed it and I agree this would make a good session or quenching beer"
"I'd probably get this again the next time I go to the restaurant, unless they have a new beer on tap."
"The beer is a pale golden color. It has a bit of a head to it. Not too much in the aroma department. There is a bit of malt and a whill of some hops. Body is about medium. Taste is a bit malty, but a bit on the lighter side. No real bitterness to it, but maybe I'm getting numb from drinking too many Hop Devils. A really good session beer."
