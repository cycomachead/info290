"As claimed, the flavor is ""malty, and lightly sweet, with a delicate hint of spice"". Plenty of caramel malts and very faint spicing that becomes a bit more obvious in the aftertaste."

"On tap at Beechwood BBQ. Like grown-up cream soda. Malty with a sneaky hop finish. Really outstanding!"

"Overall: this is the first American Cream Ale I have had, and it is pretty darn tasty. A good mix of flavours with a great feel. I'm not sure it would do well specifically as a summer beer here as it is just far too hot, but I'll definitely take one every now and then any time of year."

"Burnt amber, laced off white foam. Caramel and toasted orange, hint of candied ginger. Deliciously smooth and creamy."

"Great to drink waiting New Year's party."
"O: Nothing super special, but not a bad brew,"
"Very good summer ale. I see now that it's categorized as a cream ale, and that's probably what made it so good--that creamy hint that makes it stand out."

"Poured out of a can. Nice frothy head, Deep amber color, with a mild aroma of ice tea and some spice. Tastes of vanilla ice cream, or maybe even a root beer float. Very creamy and delicious! A fabulous summer beer! This would pair well with just about any desert."

"Interesting beer. pours nice and a decent head. Aroma and taste are both light to me, but certain flavors dominate. The malt sweetnes come across strong and there is maybe a touch of light citrus. The mouthfeel is nice, smooth and creamy and would be a great fall beer......"

"There’s a malt-forward aroma, to the disappointment of someone expecting a “lighter” beer for the summer seasonal. Same with the flavor—it comes across with a taste of light caramel, obscuring a hop kick which would lighten the beer for my enjoyment. Is this an amber ale? Nevermind, I read it’s labeled a cream ale. Still too heavy in my opinion. It felt more like a fall drinker, even in foggy San Francisco."

"Deliciously smooth and creamy.. ""Cream soda"" flavor.  Feels full but not heavy, thus a nice warm or cold weather beer for my taste.  I wish I could have this more."
"Light, amber color. Citrus, but more complex than some summer brews, with notes of apricot. A tad sweet and crisp on the tongue."

"In finish, the caramel loosens and its sweetness begins to evaporate. All this leaves a honeycomb structure of malted milk behind, with a creamy and semi-dry closure. Slight mint and tea leaf peak through and help to keep the beer highly drinkable and remarkably refreshed."

"I love this beer. Very well-balanced taste. What beer should taste like, to my way of thinking. Not too bitter, not too malty, nothing exotic or gimmicky, but certainly not bland and not watery. Nice body. Just right. Some people say it's a bit sweet or vanilla-y, but I'd emphasize that these are subtle qualities. Too many beers go to extremes these days. Like it's a contest to see which brewer can be the most novel, the most interesting. This beer shows how good it can be to be in the mainstream, IF it is done right. And this beer does everything right. I look forward to another of these and more from this brewer."

"Despite having a richer, darker malt backbone that the vast majority of summer seasonals, the flavor profile is not ""heavy."" Actually, it's a nice change of pace from the glut of pilsners and watered down pale ales that litter the shelves during the summer."

"Body is a medium amber color, with a nice creamy head that recedes into a thin layer with a decent ring at the edge. Some watery lacing. Smells very malty with a nice cream ale character in the aroma, but nothing complex or unique. Tastes malty sweet, sort of cloying at the finish. Medium body, with decent carbonation. Slightly oily feel, not dry at all. Overall, a nice example of a cream ale, but nothing that is cementing this to my brain as a must have if I see it on a tap. Seems very sessionable, and it comes in cans...perfect for summer."

"Not a bad little beer, drank it on a nice evening on a roof top bar. Didn't feel like the beer had much character or distinctive flavor. Never had a cream ale before to my knowledge. Good sensation in the mouth but the overall taste and smell isn't anything special."

"Overall— For a summer thirst quencher/session beer it is very good. In cold weather it would probably not be nearly as good. My biggest concern with Summer Solstice is that it is too sweet-- I only had one can to sample, but the sweetness so dominates the flavor that I am afraid more than 1 or 2 of these might overwhelm the palate."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An A+ summer beer I have not had one bad beer from Anderson Valley and this beer as well as their Winter Solstice I look forward to ever summer and winter...But if you have not had this beer you should grab a six pack of it for sure...CHEERS"

"O: Outstanding summer brew! So much flavor packed into this one but stills stays super refreshing and unique! I picked it up randomly and am super impressed! Bolder and has more complexity then most summer beers and really pushes to the limits of this category! Great beer!"

"This was on a wicked Labor Day pricing of 3.99 at TW. For that price you can't go wrong so let's give it a whirl. Popping the aluminum vessel I get a huge waft of sweet malt and a very fine bubble creamy head forms. Pouring into my trusty SAPP this brew is a cloudy bright reddish orange with a very creamy orange tan head. On the taste the brew is very light and smooth. No evident bitterness just enough background to tone down the sweet maltiness. Slightly metallic bready and very refreshing. Not anything I would have paid the previous 9.99 a sixer asking price for but for 3.99 a sixer this hits the spot in the SoFla heat."

"Overall: A very cool take on a summer style.  Like you really need another wheat beer? (4.19)"

"Overall: The first few sips throw me off, but after that I get used to it. Not excited enough to buy it again, but it was nice. Can't complain too much!"
"The feel is slightly summer but seems to be full and creamy and could even translate to a fall edition. I love most Anderson Valley beers but this is truly special."
""
""
""
""
"O - My favourite summer beer so far! This is really well balanced and not overboard on the fruit/citrus notes, while still having an obvious summery, refreshing character."
""
""
""
"A very well done beer for the style. Pleasant sweet malts, with just enough hops to balance it."
""
"Overall: I'm very perplexed by this beer. It is both intriguing and ordinary. I would assume this beer wouldn't hit the spot on a warm summer day, but at this same time it has a faint resemblance to a summery beer or at least has that feel to it. In a way it reminds me of Bell's Christmas ale. It's a scottish ale, when normally breweries go with something like a spiced ale for their Christmas brew. I enjoy the change up/ thinking out of the box, but at the same time, if it ain't broke don't fix it. I have been impressed Anderson Valley's beer, and will continue to try their products, even though this wasn't what I expected."

"I wish Beer Advocate had a way for me to remind myself how much I dislike this beer without me skewing the overall grade. Problem is I am a dummy and I keep ordering this beer not realizing it is a Cream Ale, and I hate cream ales. For what it's worth, this beer seems to deliver everything this type of beer should. It's like a melted down carbonated Popsicle, although without the glamor. This review is to remind me to stop ordering this beer!!"
""
""

""
""
"This is a pretty solid cream ale. It has a bit more body than others I have tried but it is still easily drinkable. The flavor has a bit more depth than I'm used to in this style. I'm used to the simple cereal grains but the caramel malts and fruitiness (from the yeast I suppose) is very welcomed here. This is definitely a beer worth trying. It's also a nice change of pace from the lighter wheat beer offerings that flood the shelves in the summer."
""
"O= A summer favorite, unlike any other beer cream ale or not. This beer has a profile of its own. While I can understand where some people will dis-like this beer I love its complex flavor profile and superior drinkability."

"O: Refreshing beer, a cream ale which is one I’ve had few of. Light and refreshing, great for a hot summer evening. Would pair well with lots of foods as it has very general flavour. I imagine it would go well with apple pie, or light summer sandwiches and salads."

"The aroma exudes a nice multi-grain and honey scent with the flavors following suit. Definitely a darker color to the body from what I'm familiar with from other cream ales, but still a very malty, very smooth beer. Wonderfully balanced with superb flavoring throughout."

"My first taste after drinking a porter was so creamy I was amazed. Such a rich taste, with hints of fruit, particularly orange, among the cream. It could be that I was inferring the taste, as I am quite fond of strawberries and oranges with cream, but I swear that this is the most creamy beer I have had. It is so luxurious, but so sip-able at the same time. It has a slightly nutty taste which reminds me of some of my favorite coffees. Just a really great beer. I am always fond of Anderson Valley. I am not very experienced in creamy beers, but this one stood out among the others I have had. I would say that this is among some of the greatest beers I have had, as I am a stout and porter man, and am quite often disappointed with beers that aren't very dark. This beer stood out. Just a very good beer."

"Had this poured into a pint glass. Dark, hazy copper appearance. Off-white head with a darker brownish-tint. Lazy bit of lacing down the side of the glass. Somewhat malty nose with just a bit of spice. Flavor has a decent crispness, but the beer is still a bit heavy, which I guess is to be expected from a cream, but maybe not from a summer seasonal. The crispness and clean finish say summer, but the weight really doesn't."
""
""
""
"Overall-I'd buy this brew again. It is a solid summer brew that I could easily drink on a hot summer day, it is interesting for its style."
""
""
""
"Overall: An easy drinking summer beer. A good one to give to your non-craft friends. Not as much traditional character as one would hope but overall isn't a bad brew to sip on."

"Considering the fact that summers in NorCal in the far north (where AV is located) are usually pretty chilly, rainy, and misty, I could see this as a perfectly enjoyable beer to have during the days where the weather becomes mild during the season in the region. While I enjoyed a lot of the sweetened, creamy flavors this has to offer, the bittered, flaky finish, as well as the enormous syrupy, sludgy body, makes this one something that I patiently sipped on. I'd pair it with food in a heartbeat (think fruit-glazed butter fried lamb with sweet potatoes), but on its own, not so much. More of an ambivalent dessert than a quaffable summer beer."
""
""
""
"Overall- I have heard people say this is like Cream Soda for adults and I get that. It definitely has a Cream Soda like quality and it comes out strongest in the mouth & taste. The nose is definitely a more ""beer-like"" aroma, it's not unappealing though if you were to introduce this to someone. All in all, an easy quality drink. If you are looking for something sweeter, something that's a bit more than your typical summer-y Ales, this would be a great starting point."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This was such a great beer and probably the best Cream Ale I've ever had. Through and through the scents matched up with the taste and the idea behind the scents matched up with the texture. Summer Solstice is a great beer for the warmer months when you want to get away from IPA's/DIPA's for a few days and give your wrecked palate some time off."

"Aroma has wheaty and yeasty notes plus a firm tone of honey. It pours a dark, coppery amber with a fairly thick wheat head. Looks more like a regular ale than a wheat, but so what. Crisp, wheaty, malty flavor has yeasty and honey undertones and just a hint of sweet fruit. Smooth flavor has good body and plenty of fizz. Good for summer - hell, good any time of year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich copper amber hue with medium off white slowly fading creamy head. Aroma and Taste of caramel malt, some wheat and light spicy notes with some bitterness. Palate is a medium body with mild carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, some wheat and light spiciness and some bitter notes on the for balance. Overall a good, solid summer brew."

"Poured from a 355ml bottle. Pours a deep copper colour with a modest head. Not a lot going on as far as aromas. On the palate there's a little more as there are plenty of caramel, nutty flavours with a hint of vanilla. Very dry finish, but nothing much in the way of hops that we can detect. Not sure why this is called Summer Solstice when it tastes more like a fall beer, sort of along the lines of a marzen."
"Um, its basically a watered down juice drink. No carbonation. nasty off flavors. ugh. nothing is going good for this beer. this is the last straw for me and anderson valley. their beers all suck top to bottom. i'm done with them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My friends have all praised this beer very highly, so now it's my turn to give it a critical shot. It pours a lightly hazy copper-brass topped by a finger of lightly cream-white foam. The nose comprises vanilla, cream, light wheat, light orange glaze, and a touch of caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, with the sweeter notes unionizing for better flavors for all, and the orange being joined by some pineapple and red apple to vainly balance out the sweetness (it's a valiant effort, though). The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a creamy feel Overall, a deceptively complex, highly enjoyable beer, one of the highlights of coming Summers, indeed."
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a honey colored body with a very small head that doesn't hang around long. The smell is sweet, some vanilla notes come through. The taste has a nice sweet taste up front, i get a vanilla flavor to it, its like cream soda. Then comes a nice suttle hop taste on the back of the tongue. the mouth feel is good, nicely carobonated and smooth. Overall this is defently a nice summer beer, would taste good after a long hot day at work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A tasty APWA by Anderson Valley. I enjoyed the honey and dark fruit flavours as it neutralizes the wheat flavours. The aroma is a tad cloying but the taste makes up for this aspect."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice and refreshing beer that tastes of berries and figs. Very commendable for being so unique, I'd most likely have this one again."
""
""
""
"12 ounce can into pint glass, no canning date. Pours hazy orange copper color with a small white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of orange, biscuit, toast, caramel, nuttiness, vanilla, grass, floral, light chocolate, and herbal. Very nice aromas with good balance and strength. Taste of orange, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, caramel, vanilla, floral, grass, and herbal. Lingering notes of citrus, toast, biscuit, caramel, nuttiness, vanilla, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a bit. Fairly robust flavors with nice balance; no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming present on the finish. Overall this is a damn nice cream ale. Nice amount of flavor and balance; very smooth and easy to drink. Really enjoyable, I would have it again."

"*from notes 8.23.12"

"Pours an amber to brown color. The head is good at pour but disappates quickly and a small amount remains on the top of the beer and the rim of the glass for a while. No lacing is present. Smell is nondescript with a hint of spices and sour. Mouthfeel is creamy and taste is light with a hint of sour from citrus - orange and grapefruit."

"Pours a clear deep orange color with a white head that thins out but never totally disappears. There is a touch of fruit on the nose and a hint of vanilla. Nothing strong, but sets you up appropriately. Sips are certainly creamy, but the texture might get dull after one beer's worth. I like it - it's a stand out in the summer beer crowd - but at the same time it's not as refreshing as I like my summer beers to be. I still get at least one 6 pack a season, though."

"O: I had pretty high expectations coming into this beer and overall I was disappointed. It's not a bad beer by any means, just not as good as I was expecting. I'd try it again, but there are a lot of beers out there I'd go for first before having one of these again."

"Overall I liked this beer and was a little impressed with it, I also thought it was pretty good example of a Cream Ale, the Cream Ale aspects of this beer showed up nicely and made this beer pretty true to style. This beer had great drinkability, it went down really smooth and it had enough flavor to hold my attention, this would make a good warm weather beer, I could see drinking three or four of these on a nice summer afternoon. What I liked most about this beer was how true to style this beer was and how well put together it was. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, I can't think of anything that I would want to change about this beer. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a nicer Cream Ale and I recommend this beer to just about anyone. Anderson Valley makes some pretty solid beers, while this isn't my favorite from them, it sure is close. My gt to Cream Ale is Genny Cream, it's cheap and tastes good, but I feel that this beer has much better flavors and overall is better a Cream Ale, but till Anderson Valley can match the price and put this in 30 packs, I will still be keeping the Genny Cream on hand, but when I want to switch it up with a better tasting Cream Ale, I will go with this beer. Good job guys, I will be on the look out for more of your beers."

"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Light bodied. The nutty and vanilla flavors are something not seen much in a seasonal summer brew. The creamy tastes of orangesicle and root beer quench the thirst but can be a bit sweet."
"Wow not what I would expect from a summer beer poured this expecting light hazy citrus instead I got a beer poured copper amber a nice white head and a slightly sweet nose with a banana walnut quality. Upon tasting it wow different then anything I've had before definite caramel notes and backing great sweet fun different I love it."
""

"I respect them quite a bit for using a beer like this for their summer beer. So many breweries seem to do slightly different takes on the same style for their summer beers. This is pretty different and it's actually pretty tasty at that. I'll even imagine that some people who don't typically drink beer could put this one down."
""
"Pours toasted amber with solid cream top and spotty lace. Smells, well, creamy with malts and soft yeast tones and a lactose tone. A hint of light florals. Flavor is again, creamy. Weird how milky this actually tastes, cool. Some malts and a slight oxidation, kinda sweet. Full bodied with light carb and a satiating finish. Nice beer."
""
""
"I love the summer time."
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a long glass, unknown freshness date. This pours a cloudy amber color with a decent tan head. The smells are of malts, cream and sugar. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good similar to a cream soda but with alcohol!"
""
""
""

"O: Good drinkable summer beer - nothing exceptional, but quite easy to throw a few of these down."
"Drinks more like a common ale than a cream ale. Too fruity as well. Cream ales should not be so."

"I Love malty and summer brews, this is excellent. A must purchase every year. Makes me want to move to Cali. This stuff is awesome, it is so good.. crazy... my go-to summer brew for sure."

"Now this, this is a cream ale, I say - a nicely rounded, soft, yet full malt base, some quirky, but still workable side flavours, and an almost silky-smooth mouthfeel. Bahl hornin', indeed."
""
""
""
"Growler to pint glass. Good looking medium brown pour with lots of activity and a subtle off white 1 finger head that left quickly. Smell is heavy carmel on the front with a touch of vanilla. Not overpowering, but adequate. Taste followed the nose with the big carmel note on the front which gave way to vanilla sweetness and a bit of tart. Refreshing, but a bit too much like carmel cola with the heavy carbonation. Maybe some citrus with the hops on the end, but faint. Feel was pretty thin and dry. Overall- A pretty sessionable ale that is big with carmel and carbonation. Not too complex and pretty straight forward with taste. An interesting style for me and I would hit another on a hot day. Flavors increase as beer warms which was a nice touch-"

"Overall - One of the more impressive summer releases I've had. It's almost as though it's cheated by exploiting a loophole; an unusually full-flavored summer ale that still retains a nice, light feel. Will buy again, and soon. May be one of my go-to summer brews from now on."

"Light bodied and moderately carbonated. This is not a beer I'd get again- ""Hipster Cream Ale"" from Ohio is better."

"O - A really tasty beer. A great gateway beer that most anyone can enjoy."
""
"This is one summer seasonal I seek out every year. Drinking this like there is no tomorrow. An awesome summer session ale and a really unique seasonal. Aside from its limited release time, this is one of my favorites."
"O: For the style, this was really nice and much, much better than many other Cream Ales with ""Natural Flavors"" that I've tried."

"overall, i'd recommend this to anyone - beer advocate and noobies alike."

"A hell of a cream ale. Perfect for slugging back. Recommended. 4.0"

"Ale flavors, lager smoothness. This is what I recommend to anyone wanting a Cream Ale."
"This is a DRY beer, it drys my mouth even before swallowing it. It's moderately carbonated with a body that is a bit light, but that's expected. I'll give it points for being refreshing and moderately drinkable, but it's not session able."
""
"O: I'll tell you a secret: I've got a guilty pleasure, and it's called Cream Ale. I really love 'em - all Spring and Summer long they are my go-to fridge suds. Having had a lot of them, I can tell you that this is one of the best. No off flavors or adjunct-like whispers flowin' here. Just a great Summer seasonal. Big thumbs up. I'll be grabbing more of this before the leaves start falling."
"D - Quaffable and sessionable... Anderson Valley really hits the mark with this summer seasonal, espcially when I find that much of the competition is either too fruity or lacks any really substance... There's nothing spectacular about this brew, but it is exactly what the doctor ordered on a warm lazy summer's day..."

"Overall, I was really disappointed. Like I said above, I don't know if I had an older can, or a bad batch? I would really like to try this again, because the reviews of this beer are decent, and I think I'll give this a second chance. The taste was nothing like the aroma, which was promising."

"O - This beer surprised me. It is not at all what I expected. It is a long way from a Genny cream ale. This is very easy drinking with a lot of flavor."
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a clear, vibrant, ruby-hued copper coloring with a thin coat of filmy, white head. The head clings to the glass as you drink, leaving a decent coating behind. Aromas are blended well, with a mild malt sweetness and slight citrus highlight. A bit roasty on the nose, too. Flavors are a little more sweet, with a butterscotch and toffee backbone that has a good roasting to it, and gets highlighted with tart citrus notes and a subtle hops spicing. The aftertaste is light and creamy, with a peppery hop presence at the very end to clean the palate. The finish is quick and crisp, with a slight effervescence to it. Very tasty."

" Taste/Mouthfeel, tastes of clean fresh muffins with the aforementioned fruits having a great influence in the mix without being syrupy sweet and finishing clean. Velvety smooth and creamy, good mouthfeel and drinkability. One of the better summer beers I've had that add different fruits and flavors to the mix. Didn't even realize that it's a cream ale until inputing the review to BA. #2 in my Anderson Valley mixer and another solid entry from the brewery."

"Right away the chocolate and cream overwhelm the palate. The hops come through nicely, but not enough for me to truly enjoy it. A nice session beer though. Perhaps I just don't quite enjoy the style: Cream ale."
""
"Notes - Could have had a little more carbonation"
""
""
"Great for a hot summer day when you don't have anything to do as you will get happily hammered quickly."
"O/D: i would never have guessed this for a cream ale. 'summer' would suggest dry, crisp, refreshing to me, and this is none of these. i suppose this is what it would be like if i tried to make toffee or caramel at home, overdid it/fucked up, and licked up what was left in the bottom of the pan. if i would like that sort of thing."
"Dark orange in color, very clear and no head. Mild aromas ... orange marmalade maybe? Lightly sweet and somewhat creamy, subtle spices with mild carbonation and very light body. Cant say it is at the top of my list ... but it isn’t bad ... and definitely different."
""
""
"O-Avoid like the plague i mean if your not really into beer its great and would be a great girly beer for your missus but its not for me the sweetness really goes to the next level with no hoppy bitterness noticeable to counteract which really kills it for me."
""
"Good cream ale, but as far as 'Summer' beers go I've had far more refreshing and enjoyable."
""
""
""

"Avoid! Was looking forward to this, but it is a super sweet soft drink like beer."
""
""
""
"Its` nose has bread, dried fruit and some caramel. The taste has light spices, quite a bit of sweetness, along with some bitterness. MF is medium bodied with a rather dry finish. An alright beer, but certainly nothing special IMHO."

"O- a very good cream ale. mouthfeel is great!"
"Overall, this is good beer, keeping in mind that it's brewed for hot summer months, and therefore the flavors are purposefully kept light. Despite this light quality, the flavors are quite distinguished and delicious, and the beer is thankfully not over-spiced. It is slightly too reminiscent of a soft drink for me, reminding me in this sense of a weak cross between a Dr. Pepper and a Coke, but is most certainly better fare than the average summer seasonal."
"O: I was expecting not a cream ale. I guess I should have checked before hand. A bit off, not something I would want to drink on a hot day."
"Overall: as good as a cream ale can be for my taste. Not really something I will get again though."
"Overall Drinkability - Possibly the most refreshing beer I've ever had. Very thirst quenching without being watery or boring. This may be my first cream ale, so perhaps I should really dive into that style because I'll love it if this foray is any indication."
"Poured from a 12oz can into my Stone IRS tulip. Deep amber color. Lightly hazy. 1/2 finger of head that dies down quickly, leaving a decent film and a little bit of lacing. Smells bready malty up front. Some sort of lingering fruit smell in the background. Subdued spicy hops. First flavor is a big bready blast of mellow sweet malt. Flavors are very light. Fishes with a light dry bitterness. Lots of creamy little bubbles on the tongue. Kind of a one trick malt pony, but tasty nonetheless."
"This brew poured out with a slight orange color, pretty interesting actually. The smell of the beer has a light amount of citrus notes and some smooth malt aromas. The taste of the beer was a little sweet, hardly any hops noticeable in this brew at all. The mouthfeel of this beer was very creamy... Really impressed by the feel of this brew. It's still light and refreshing also. Overall the beer isn't bad, I'd probably drink it again one day."
"This is the smoothest and all around best cream ale I have ever had. Lichi baby!!!"
"More akin to cream soda than cream ale. Bright copper, vanilla stands out from the shockingly low level of IBUs. Sweetness, caramel, and vanilla become cloying at the end. The last thing I want in the summer is something this sweet, but fortunately I didn't drink it when it was 100 degrees outside. Unique, but the single can I purchased will be my last."
"O- Glad I tried this beer. Nothing over the top, just nice balance. Very good summer ale."
"O: This is probably one of the best ways to break into the Cream Ale category, and I was quite impressed. Sitting on the shelf in a can, it caught my eye, but I wasn't sure what to expect. I found it to be a light and drinkable ale with a hint of brown ale and a bit of lager thrown in there. It won't blow you away with complexity, but it's a quality brew that will definitely find its place in your fridge regularly during the summer and fall. Cheers!"
"O: Smooth enough summer beer. Very easy drinking sessionable beer for sure. This will be a nice change up from the usual APA/IPA summer rotation next year."
"On tap at taproom 307nyc. Pours a cloudy super light brown with an orange hue. Smells malty with some apple like scents coming through. Tastes like a caramel apple lots of sugar with fruit flavors on the backside nice malty backbone no real hop presence. Mouthfeel and carbonation are nice for a session beer with a low abv. Overall a very good session beer."
"Cloudy orangish-copper in color with a small white head. Surprisingly good summer beer. Very creamy with some pineapple-ish flavors, almost creamsicle-like. Some spices on the finish. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Refreshing but not boring like a lot of the watery summer beers out there."
"Half finger of eggshell cream white color, densely solid with an very even surface, settles down to a thin surface coating, the lacing comes as a thin sheet down the glass sides, slips downward with ease. Glowing filminess to the amber to zinc orange liquid, easily opaque, very consistent from top to bottom. The nose does have a strong herbaceousness to it but quickly settles down into more vanilla cream, fudge, orange citrus and toffee to chocolate notes, pepperiness and rye bread notes bloom as it warms, the peach and apricot fruit scents more dense than expressive. Medium to full-bodied, the creamy mouth texture adds volume if not weight per se. Easy to identify the vanilla, butterscotch, honey elements but it’s the pepper, garden herbs, tea leaf and country style bread which gives it complexity. The orange creamsicle pairs well with pine notes. The carbonation is active but in a more fluffy than tightly woven manner. What deserves credit most here is how it remains true to its category but doesn’t settle for “simple” and leaves it open for the imbiber to just groove on the creamy sweetness or follow the more unique elements."
"O: This is a beer I would drink for dessert. It’s very sweet with a good creamy orange flavor. This beer is much different than the only other cream ale I’ve had that was full of adjuncts. Good to know there are a wide variety of beers within the style."
"Pours a translucent amber-honey color with pillowy white head that stacks a couple inches. Webby lacing. The nose is alright. Some light hops and wheat is noticed. The taste is sweet and malty up front and sweet and malty in the end. Very drinkable for such a summer day. Some toffee is noticed throughout. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich, yet not too thick. Very drinkable and quite tasty."
"Def good for a warm day on the porch"
"Overall though I enjoy this taste so much I have to call good regardless of everything else."
"Not my favorite. Too sweet for me. I would have liked it much more if it finished dry. Would have been the refreshing summer beer that I was looking for."
"Overall I was impressed with this beer and would order it on tap or pick up a can or two. It's tasty summer sipping. I love that more brewers are embracing this style! This is one of about a dozen cream ales I tasted in July/August."
"Overall: This is a great summer ale or session beer. The low ABV makes drinking a sixer of this very possible!"
"Beer is medium to light in body with no bitterness on the end but an overall smooth mouthfeel and some creaminess to the whole beer. There is most maltiness to the beginning and the middle and the end sort of disappears. I don't think I""d have this again, I'll continue to look for a cream ale that I like."
"Overall: totally acceptable for a cream ale, but this heavy corn flavor is off-putting for me."
"3.5 D: Definitely boring, but the mouthfeel is nice enough to make this a good lawnmower beer."
"One of the best beers of the year I have tried. I am in love. I plan on buy several more to store and drink...."
"D: This is a very good summer drink. I'd imagine it would be great to pour over some ice cream and make a float. Oh yeah!"
"The beer is copper hued with a thick, lasting head that leaves ample lacing on the glass. Steady effervescence from the bottom of the pint. The aroma is sweet smelling, with malt and vanilla. The flavor is akin to cream soda. I happen to savor a cream soda on occasion, so I'm rather enjoying this brew. The beer is thin to medium in body, and smooth on the palate. One pint is sufficient. I wouldn't want more than a serving, though I definitely enjoyed this. I would have it again."
"O- Not my favorite style, but this is the best of the style I've had. It's really nice, and definitely recommended if you're interested in this style of beer."
"I drank an entire can (responsibly) while writing this review. That's drinkability."
"It was not particularly complex but the straightforward caramel sweet malt is excellent. It finishes clean to make it good for summer. While sweeter and fuller-bodied than a traditional summer beer, this was not heavy, finished clean, and was refreshing. It may not be an after I just mowed the yard brew but absolutely a sitting on the patio having some BBQ brew."
"O: Real nice for this style. A beer I could have again. I would prefer a touch lighter for a 'summer' brew but this is a good, clean, flavorful malty offering."
"O - I thought this brew was alright. I'm not crazy about it, but I wouldn't mind drinking it again. I liked the mild and balancing flavors of the beer, especially the hint of vanilla that I picked up. For me I wouldn't mind tossing back a few with friends but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again. Worth a try for sure though. Cheers!"
"o: A mediocre cream ale with a watery body and cream flavor that reminds me of artificial flavoring (although not). I won't buy this again."
"I don't really know what to think of this one. I don't dislike it, but I would definitely be more inclined to drink it when the weather is a bit colder, rather than in scorching summer heat. However, disregarding seasonal attributes and concentrating more on style, this beer is pretty right on."
"I can't ask for more drinkability. Easily sessionable; not complicated enough to be distracting. Price is the only thing keeping me from having several."
"The balance is surprisingly high though for the $1.50(12oz) that I paid for it. Would definitely buy again, and am curious even as to how it would go with barbecue, or even hamburgers."
"Final Notes: Excellent session beer, easy on the budget, and it's in a can so you can go anywhere with it. What more could you want out of a good summer seasonal?"
"O-A little more interesting than the average summer fare. Doesn't do it for me, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"It pours out a nice deep amber color crested with two fingers of off-white head. Retention is alright, as is lacing. The aroma is sweet and creamy, with some nice caramel malts. There's also what smells a bit like peaches or apricots. The taste is quite good, it's quite unique for a summer beer since it isn't light-bodied, but still very refreshing. The creaminess of the beer really does wonders for the drinkability. Caramel malts and the creamy sweetness are the front-runners, it does have quite a bit of a cream soda taste to it. The fruitiness also sticks around, along with a bit of spicing. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and very creamy, and the drinkability is quite good. Overall, a unique and tasty summer brew, it makes for something unique to enjoy during the dog days."
"- I really dig this beer. I really dig that it is in cans too. For the lack of use of hops, I would like to see a smaller price point so I could grab about 48 of these bad boys for camping. A very good full bodied and full flavored session ale."
"(12oz can). Pours a clear amber color with decent offwhite head. Some lacing an somewhat active carbonation. Aroma of caramel, bread, and some fruits. Taste is sweet with some light bitterness. A bit of spice and fruit as well. Medium bodied with a slick texture. Finish is smooth. This is a pretty flavorful beer with some substance. I’m not sure its a thirst quencher though as I feel like I’d get filled up easily."
"Drinks easy & with a bit more flavor than you average cream ale. Had better, but this will work on a HOT July afternoon"
"True to its name, this medium-bodied ale is velvety and creamy—almost surprisingly so. Delicately spiced, Summer Solstice also possesses a refreshing tanginess with subtle citrus notes (tangerine maybe) in the background. A short, quenching and gently hoppy finish completes the experience, leaving the imbiber with a soft sweetness that lingers on the tongue. Very drinkable and well-suited to warmer weather."
"Great aroma, totally different than anything I've ever smelled out of beer. This is a very homey feeling beer. Highly recommended."
"I really enjoyed this brew. Having it on tap may be a plus. The flavors are fresh and lively. The beer is very drinkable. I may have another..."
"Again we are reminded of what our mothers taught us: never judge a book by its cover. Just because a beer looks flavourful and malt-rich doesn't mean it is; likewise, just because it says ""Summer"" on the label doesn't automatically make it a gratifyingly refreshing hot weather quencher. Pretty much everything this beer leads you to believe ends in disappointment."
"Lighter body, but has a slight creamy feel. It is hard to believe that this is refreshing, but I think it is. Certainly different than most summer beers. I like it."
"Poured a light brown with a nice yellow hue with a very large off white creamy head that had very nice retention and produced some excellent lacing. The aroma was very malty of a cookie like malt and had a nice dose of a sweet doughy yeast with notes of caramel and dried fruit. It tasted extremely malty, a bit sweet and nice and refreshing with a hint of dried fruit from start to finish with a nice caramel note at the end that left the flavor lingering on the taste buds for a good while. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and very creamy in texture with a nice lively carbonation. Overall I have to say the name is perfect, it is most likely the smoothest, most refreshing summer beer I have ever had."
"COSTCO NEAR ME SELLS A 24 pack for $23. THAT, is a steal."
"D- Tasty and easy drinking, had it on tap at the brewery and decided to pick up a six pack (in cans) and it was just as good. A very satisfying drink."
"D-The mouthfeel feels a little thin with the flavor profile, but is to style. I wouldn't really a heavier feel in a summer beer anyways."
"This is a decent summer brew that offers something a little more than the usual lackluster, uninteresting summer ales."
"O: Very drinkable and summer like in its taste and feel. Definitely drink some more of this."
"Pours a clear honey amber color with a 1 inch bone colored head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random thin streaks of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smells of sweet malt and some funky spice. The smell is almost like gym socks. Taste is of sweet malt and a slight spiciness. This beer has a lower carbonation level with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that I can see being a good choice in the warm summer months."
"The body is fairly light, but the feel is creamy enough with ample bite to keep it away from watery. Not too much to say here, it's easy to drink and the flavor is OK."
"O- flavor is not what i expected but the fruitiness and mouthfeel is unique and the beer is very drinkable. i'm glad they sell 6 pack cans, perfect for camping or the beach!"
"This pours cloudy dark copper and has a very small amount of head with no retention or lacing. This is a very sweet beverage that barely tastes like a beer. It’s big boy’s cream soda. Although I don’t reach for one of these every time I’m craving a beer, I thoroughly enjoy this as something different and refreshing. The quality is top notch…medium smooth body and very drinkable. Again, not my first choice, but for the style this has to be an “A-”."
"O – This is a crazy easy drinker and would make a solid session beer. I drank it on a 96 degree day and it was damn refreshing. Very nice."
"The heavy body makes it a beer I wouldn't categorize as a ""summer beer"" but that also differentiates it from the rest in its category. Not a light beer by any means but quite tasty."
"This was my choice of beer when it came to camping. High quality, light and refreshing and comes in a can. How can you lose? This beer pours an amber color with a frothy ecru foam, surprisingly dark for a cream ale. The aromas aren't much of anything with this beer, but the mild caramel and vanilla are a rather welcome presence in the nostrils. The flavor is quite similar to that of a mix between an amber ale and a cream soda. There is a decent amount of sugary cream flavor as well as a decent amount of vanilla on the palate with a background of a touch of butterscotch and caramel. The mouthfeel is, well, creamy, it's hard to call it really anything else. Overall this is a great summer beer, one which I will surely buy as often as the chance arises."
"O: a different brew that's for sure..pretty enjoyable."
"Thanks to the legendary woodychandler for providing this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light brown color with amber hues and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is somewhat sweet, malty. Taste is good, malts, sweet, just a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"overall, this is a great beer. it is complex enough but mellow enough to keep you coming back for more."
"Moderately carbonated and wetting to the palate. Overall not bad and I look forward to trying more examples of this style."
"Overall – At first I thought it was just an average beer, but after it warmed up a little bit I really enjoyed the sweet aspect of it. It’s got a nice taste that is fairly different from most of the other summer beers out there. I’d buy it again and would say it’s worth seeking out."
"This is a nice cream ale, summer or otherwise, though I find it a good style to make for summer."
"This beer does not say Crema Cerveza on it and it came from a can. Pours out a dark copper color with a cream colored head. Smells quite malty for a summer beer. Tastes is malty too, nice toasty malts with a clean hop aftertaste. Also has a bit of diacetyl almost buttery biscuit flavor to it, which I don't count as a flaw. Or is that vanilla notes? Beer says natural flavor added?! This is an odd beer for summer, might be more of a autumn beer if I had to place it in a season. However, it is hot out and I am enjoying it, at least it isn't too heavy or anything like that. Very smooth, almost creamy tasting with not too much carbonation could make this a hit at a BBQ with some burgers or brats, possibly some smokey pork too."
"O: Not a bad beer at all, definitely better than Genesee cream haha. Liked it better than their Imperial IPA too."
"This beer is interesting, but doesn't really blow me away. It seems like a decent summer offering."
"Bottle. Pours a clear copper color with a mostly white with light tan head. The aroma is....cheese, yes cheese, slightly like swiss. Oh good lord, I am not looking forward to tasting this. It taste like watered down cream soda. Medium mouthfeel. The flavor is not that great to say the least. I’m not sure what they were shooting for on this one. Slightly sweet start. Ends with a linger cream soda flavor. No lace, but some head retention."
"Overall, I have no idea what to think about this beer. It smells bad and doesn't taste like beer at all. What were these guys trying to brew."
"Light and lacking in flavor. Easy-drinking, but there are plenty of other summer beers I'd choose over this."
"Overall, this was surprisingly enjoyable and very easy to drink. I could certainly have a few of these at a sitting."
"O/D-This is clearly a different take on what a summer ale should be. This beer is pretty awesome. Incredibly easy to drink. No alcohol burn. Tastes like cream soda. Its pretty damn good. I thought Narragansett Summer and Hop Sun by Southern Tier were the two summer brews battling it out for my 'Summer Go-to'. This brew just added its name into the race. Just completely different than most summer brews. Good time."
"O - a good cream ale that I'd have every once in a while."
"Overall - this would be a fantastic session beer, has a lot to offer the avg joe with some good tasting and easy drinking attributes."
"I picked up a can of this one last week as part of a mixed six pack, and I am enjoying it as I type. Poured a nice copper color, with a little off-white head. Aromas of citrus, vanilla beans and light malt. On the palate, this one is light bodied and good, with flavors of vanilla, spice and orange."
"Taste-Faint fruitiness, slightly sweet malt note, very creamy and refreshing. This was a nice surprise from the usual orange/lemon summer offerings that are everywhere this time of year."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and its low alcohol content makes it quite sessionable, particularly on a hot summer day."
"Poured into a pint glass a nice clear mahogany, very carbonation, with a good two fingers of foamy white head that dissipated fairly quickly. I didn't really get too much aroma, but what I could detect was sweet malts, honey, and light fruit. Smooth with caramel malts, butterscotch, orange, maraschino cherries; sweet, but not sickeningly sweet. Balanced out with some organic grassy notes and a tad of earth. Little to no hop bitterness detectable. Smooth and medium-bodied, and very drinkable."
"Had on tap at Lidia's in the Pittsburgh strip district. Golden color, half inch head and lacing was present. Smell was pretty spicy. Taste was mostly sweet malt with a weird spice presence. Smooth and easy drinking w low carbonation. Kind of interesting and glad I tried it."
"Clear amber with white bubbly head that sticks. Aggressive aroma of spices, earth, malt, cinnamon, gingerbread. Tastes of gingerbread, slight spice, toffee, vague cocoa in the aftertaste with some residual vanilla sweetness. Zapping carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. A peculiar tasty beer that is not that refreshing but not that cloying either. Flavorful and beautifully different."
"Forgot how good and easy drinking this beer is. It pours a really nice copper color, not alot of head however. The smell is definitely sweet and the cream does come through in the nose alittle bit of roastiness as well. And...the taste is pretty much exactly as it smells. Up front sweetness but not cloying with a taste of slightly toasted marshmallow on the backend. Great mouthfeel with good carbonation, not too thick considering it says it's a cream beer. Having this one in cans is definitely gonna make it a summer time thirst quencher. Solid brew."
"Overall - I love this beer. It's adventurous and pretty delicious too. Go out and find this...now."
"Overall I'm very impressed with this summer session beer. Very tasty. Gunna be buying a ton of this for the summer especially since it comes in cans now."
"I find this beer, although quite sweet, to be very drinkable. Great summer brew."
"D-i bought this can out of curiosity. i need to go back and buy more! this is so good and it goes down so easily! this needs to come out year round."
"-Cheers"
"Yum, cans. Pours a golden orange with frothy cream colored foam. Aromas are stale and sweet, not enticing. Flavor is refreshing and has a nice creamy feel. Malt is bready and sweet, graham cracker crust and soft serve ice cream. Great summer seasonal, so glad its in cans now."
"D/O- light flavor and body with an incredible softness, all things considered. fresh grainy bran flake flavor wins over the taste for me plus the overall lightness and teddy bear snuggliness makes me thank dave from heidelberg for the sample. i'll take it."
"O - a very good cream ale. great early/late summer quaffer. body is a bit much for massive consumption, but a very pleasant experience."
"Tastes much better than is smells. Creaminess most likely coming from some adjunct like corn I believe. Pretty sweet flavor. Surprisingly viscus mouthfeel. Interesting beer. I can safely say I have tasted nothing like this. Almost cream soda like. Interesting doesn't mean great. Its just a highly drinkable not so expensive summer beer. I could really see this pairing with some spicy mexican food or for a BBQ."
"This is my favorite beer of all time. This beer has an amazing mouth feel, and is extremely drinkable (beware ;) ). Anderson Valley did an excellent job getting the vanilla flavor and aroma to really come across. Even your non-craft beer friends are going to like this one. I wait for this beer every summer and do my best to find as many cases as possible (which usually isn't much unfortunately). For my other friends who love this beer, if you do buy cases, I have found that the taste was not affected even 10 months after purchase. I don't know why there aren't more cream ales as tasty as this one, then again, is that possible?!"
"Overall these cans might have been at least 6 months old to be on discount but that's no excuse for a beer having no flavor. It wasn't skunked since the boon amber drank great but was really disappointed since this summer Solstice is the exact opposite of winter. Watery, light, and no real beer notes this is one I would avoid. Might pawn off a six pack to my brother since he says he drinks anything (Keystone)"
"Overall, the other beers I've had from this brewery are superior and I won't buy this one again at the same price."
"This is not a beer I would have very often, nor is it a beer where I would drink more than one...but it is different which is good. An amber in color ale that is heavy on sweet malts and is flavored with vanilla....giving it a cream soda like after taste which is kind of fun. Its just tasty and there is something to say for that."
"Value: At this price, you gotta be kidding."
"D) A decent brew. I'd drink another."
"It does! It does taste like flat vanilla cream soda beer. I liked it more when it was the first time trying it, but then again, I've finished the sixer."
"Had this at Fifty Brews in Orlando on bottle. Wow this was a great surprise. Pours an orange amber color and has an absolutely amazing citrus cream smell in the nose. Taste is sweet at first but balanced by back end flavors. This beer is very unique not quite a fruit beer or a cream ale. I would recommend this is a must try and I will go out of my way to find it when the seasonal comes back in stock."
"I like a good Cream Ale like the next guy but when the ""cream"" aspect consists of some overly fake tasting vanilla flavors, it just isn't my thing. I could see this being pretty accessible for new-to-craft beer drinkers but I look for something a little more substantial in my summer beers, as there was just too much sweetness here."
"Drinkability - Pretty interesting brew. Complex or variable enough to keep one's curiosity peaked, and good-tasting."
"Cream Ales are my favorite style because of THIS beer alone! Why is it so hard for other brewers to make a decent Cream Ale???"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was copper colored and cloudy kinda orange looking. The beer really had no head at all. The beer was a delicious caramelly tasting blend that was very good but odd for a summer beer. I liked it very much and will buy this again."
"A welcome change from most summer styles, I always look forward to it. It says cerveza crema so you know what to expect. Carmel and cream in the nose and on the tongue, so I think of it as desert. I do not know how one could give it a bad rating, its not as if your drinking a light beer, you should know what to expect after reading the bottle. True its not my favorite style, being a socal hop guy, but it is still a great beer on a hot day"
"D: very drinkable but also rather boring an malt heavy...love the can, though."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a slightly amber/ copper with about 2 fingers of head. Strong scents of sweet candied malts, some caramel, some minor fruity notes. The overwhelming flavor was of sugary roasted malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Very drinkable in late summer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a light carbonation. The smooth body works really well with the smooth flavor."
"Overall an ok beer if you like vanilla and cake like flavor to your beer: I don't. This is way too heavy to be considered a summer beer though."
"Drinkability> Pretty average. The mouthfeel has it's drawbacks but I wouldn't throw this in your face if you offered it to me on a hot day."
"Sadly enough, this turned into one of my first drain-pours I have had in a while."
"This is quite a change for a summer offerings. Malty sweetness prevails, yet the ale never becomes cloying even as the ale warms. This is similar to drinking sweet tea on a hot afternoon in the deep south."
"Damn this beer is tasty, so creamy and rich. Smooth and silky sweet. Malt lovers dream, biscuity and caramel malt with no toastiness. Just a mild touch of bittering hops give it a short, clean finish. If I could get this in Tx, I would buy this by the case...are you listening AV?"
"12 oz. can poured into a New Holand pint glass. Dark ruby orange color with a quarter inch of thick creamy head that disperses rapidly. Not much in the aroma department, light malt almost cardboard esque and no hop presence. Cream and amber malt flavors make this beer taste identical to a cream soda. There are also trace notes of nuts and vanilla in the background."
"Taste was surprisingly complex. It really does have a creamy texture while remaining light. It is a little bit silky, but you just can't put your finger on what is going on here beyond saying someone dropped a creamsicle in the vat. Missing the trademark hopping and bitterness of most of their beers. This is just a smooth summer ale, a little bit of honey I guess."
"D: As I said, it's tasty and light with a low ABV, so this could be a session beer if you fancy the taste."
"Drinkability is moderately high. The flavor profile is interesting enough yet simple which makes for easy consumption. The ABV is on the low end still which also makes it more sessionable. Overall a decent little beer."
"D - Only one at a time. Fun beer on occasion, though!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, not too thick, with an average amount of carbonation. This is very drinkable and very refreshing on a hot summer day. Something I bought on a whim, but I'm glad I picked it up."
"This is an oddball of a beer that almost seems out of season, but I can definitely see knocking a few of these back in the hot sun. There is a lot going on here, this beer is almost like a low gravity dubbel with some spice and a lager-ish character."
"Like a cream soda with booze, reccomended."
"drinkable - yes, probably, though i won't return to it."
"Would I buy more of it? - sure! It's available out here on the East Coast and a great canned summer brew."
"Toffee and cream soda come to mind in the first sips, later backed by a lightly nutty, husky grain. Light toasted malt sweetness and a mild apple astringency. Sort of watery with a sweet slickness, bigger on flavor than body. Still, a couple of these poolside wouldn't be a bad option. A good crossover craft beer."
"I had this on draft at the Sunset Grill on a recent visit to Boston. The bartender was not able to tell me the style and called it a light ale with some interesting character. I think that it probably wasn't a bad description for this beer. Kind of a copper/gold color and very clear, especailly for a summer ale. Good flavor, interesting character. Overall I'd say it was pretty good."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination makes the beer pretty nice and easy to drink. A nice beer to have during the summer months as it does a good job of cooling you down."
"Mouthfeel is light and has a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Overall, this is a pretty decent beer, and a good cream ale. Some flaws, but we have to open our minds and shake our hop addictions sometime (I find no hops here). This is a real easy drinker, but I wonder about refreshment -- so smooth and un-abrupt, I'm not sure this could quench me in succession on a hot day. 1 or 2, and I'd be done. No knocks here. Once again, another good brew from these guys."
"Yes a cream soda in beer form but nicely done if a little underwhelming. Could use more carbonation if this is trying to be a summer session beer. As is, neither interesting enough nor light enough to drink more than one and a half at a sitting."
"D: The taste has you calling back for more. But the cream side of things this is not a beer to drink a session of. Good for summer tastings, but not my type of summer slammer."
"Cream Ale is a strange and unorthadox style for the summertime. Even more strange is that I enjoy the flavor quite a bit when I didn't think I would."
"My only gripe - A bit pricey for a Summer Ale if you ask me. Their IPA is cheaper and with a much higher ABV (???). Should be in the $8.00 range not $10.00."
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Nice clear, copper-ruby pour with a quickly fading head and minimal lacing. Kind of a metalic smell, almost like pennies with a hint of maple syrup and roses. The taste lives up to the name. Very reminiscent of shasta cream soda. Lots of creamy caramel with a hint of peach and tea. Very light, smooth, creamy mothfeel. Good drinkable summer beer that truly surprised me."
"[EDIT]: I had another one of these tonight, I had to take a few points off. It was an exciting drink, but the second time around, after the novelty wears of, it tastes a bit more ""tin-ey"""
"This has got to be the most unique Summer Seasonal I've tried and I was expecting a sweeter beer. I was pleasantly surprised that the sweetness is on the light side and nicely balanced by hops. An easy drinking beer!"
"Drinkability - Not very. Glad I only got a single. Interesting to try but would not try it again."
"F: Still somewhat sweet, a little syrupy and sticky, more toasty malts lingering with creamy malts, lots of creamy flavors lingering, perhaps more oats. I think I get a touch of biscuit as well on the finish. Some lingering sticky sweet slight syrupy malts that gives me that reminiscence of lager again. A little strange fruit comes through as well."
"Flavorful & light, good for summer, but the flinty taste is not so pleasant after a while. Still, I'd have it again, give it another shot."
"Drinkability: Personally, I wouldn't be all too excited to down this one more than on the odd occasion. However, considering what these beers are suppose to be like, I'd say this cream ale fills the A1 formula out pretty nicely."
"D: This is my first Cream Ale - very smooth. Goes down so nicely."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this one has some more substance than most Cream Ales and is a decent beer to pound down for a while."
"D: Very drinkable and refreshing. Not nearly as good as Winter Solstice, but not a bad lawnmower beer either."
"I guess it is intriguing to mix a British cream beer with a German wheat, but it doesn't really work for me. I know this beer has lots of fans, but to me, any light lager would do better at a BBQ."
"This beer is surprisingly light and crisp and when I first took a sip I immediately thought of cream soda. It's a very mellow summer beer that would go great after mowing the grass or while BBQing some steaks. Alcohol taste is almost nonexistent but the taste of cream and vanilla are light but pleasing. I'll have to give good points to taste and drinkability on this one but will say it's lacking in the nose significantly... Could be the can though. :P"
"As for the drinkability, it goes down VERY smoothly. It is probably the easiest drinking beer I have ever had, and I enjoy every minute of it and stock up before summer ends. There is nothing like a bbq in the summer with a bottle of this."
"D: I can't say I've had too many cream ales, but I found this one to be very enjoyable. A nice low alcohol beer with good flavors and a light-medium body."
"This beer pours a cloudy reddish pink color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes very quickly into almost no lacing. The aroma is of cherries and strawberries with no real beer characteristics. The taste is much the same, but with a hint of malt. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but probably not something I would drink again."
"Compared to other Cream Ales I've had, this was pretty good. I was disappointed with the head on the beer, which was nonexistant. Anybody that reads my reviews, knows that I like a beer with a big frothing head. Anyway, I did like the nice creamy taste with the light malt finish. Definitely would classify this as a warm weather brew."
"It warms up nicely, the malt and sweetness round out to something much richer and more pleasant -- perhaps my palate was slow in recovering from the preceding IPA. The creaminess is much more noticeable about halfway through."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0909-DanM"
"D - This is a really nice cream ale. I'm not a huge fan of the style but this one was one I'd grab again."
"This beer has a lot going for it but it doesn't quite get there for me. The sweet, clean, and fresh malty character is interesting but is executed better on other AVBC beers. This actually reminded me of a 'Boont Light' at moments. Probably won't be in my fridge again anytime soon but it's an okay beer."
"So easy to drink, delicious and full of character, this is another smash-hit from Anderson Valley and one of my favorite summer beers."
"Decent drinkability, though I imagine I would want something a little more substantive for a long session."
"Review notes taken on: 7/29/09"
"A little to sweet for me. I'm more of a David Lee Roth guy, not Sammy."
"creamy mouthfeel but not overly drinkable."
"D: Maybe my judgment was clouded by the uniqueness of the super-floral aroma, but I definitely was able to throw a few of these down."
"Notes-not an offensive beer at all, but just boring, don't know what they were going for here, if it was a dull creamy light bodied amber ale, they did it"
"drinkability was good for me and makes me wish i would have bought a sixer and not a single"
"D - slightly lacking in the drinkability department. I really didn't feel inclined to finish this brew."
"You've heard of dessert wines? (of course you have) This is a dessert beer. Definitely *not* a stand-alone beer."
"D: Because of the light body, this beer goes down easy. It won't win any points for complexity, but if you're a malt fan this is sweet and satisfying.. one of the few malt beers you could actually stand to drink in the heat of summer."
"As a side note after having half the 12 oz bottle for rating I asked my dad if he wanted to finish it. He took a sip and by the look on his face that was a ""no"". Needless to say it was a drain-pour. [Also, there was no date. I wonder based on all the positive ratings if mine was way too old...]"
"Full and even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, bubbly finish. Very drinkable, good sessionable beer."
"A dirty copper color pour with a thin white head,light carbonation , a little spotty lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel ,with light floral and honey notes. Flavor is malty,caramel,toffee,light citrus ,some floral hps and a hint of some sort of spice , medium body , with a smooth mouthfeel ,with a sweet sticky finish, an easy drinker but not what I was looking for on a hot Summer day"
"nice drinkability on this one. it nails it's style. one i'll return to on two counts: it's a fantastic beer, and it's not your run of the mill summer seasonal type beer. a very nice change of pace."
"Overall impression: A bit too sweet for the style, but an enjoyable summertime brew."
"Drinkability: I like the creamy caramal malt taste that I associate more with a RIS. This one hits the style guidelines to a T. I could have several of this mini-malt bomb"
"The head produced a nice finger's worth of ecru head with decent retention. Color was a deep copper color with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a slight sweetness of caramel. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with a very caramel-like taste on the tongue. Finish had a slight sweetness, giving way to a dryness. This was head and shoulders above the crappy malt liquors that I drank today. I almost have to restrain my numbers on this one. This would be an outstanding beer at the beach."
"d- very drinkable, i'll have another."
"notes and comments- wouldn't order this beer again, just took one for the drinking card, typical bread flavors"
"Served in a pint glass, the color is a nice deep amber that is crystal clear with a thing foamy head. Smell is caramel, malts, cream, vanilla and lemon juice. Taste is a wonderful creamy, smooth malty vanilla and sugar. Mouthfeel is good, really thick and smooth. Drinkability is fantastic."
"Summer Solstice Cerveza Crema pours a hazy orange with a thick tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is on the malty end of the scale and is also a bit fruity. Malt dominates the flavor and there is a touch of fruit here too. The mouthfeel is on the light side as is appropriate. Easy drinking, worth a try."
"Overall, a nicely done brew. Drinks very easily, and possibly the best cream ale Ive had, though its more of a lager than a cream ale in my opinion. Certainly worth trying, and very sessionable."
"Drinkability: Very..tastes great, goes down great...recommended"
"Poured into my trusty Dogfish Head pint a medium amber with a nice frothy head that dissipated to almost nothing while drinking. A mild smell of candy, faint hops and some strong malt. This is the creamiest beer I've ever had, super smooth lots of lactose and almost too sweet. The taste is the best part, it does definitely taste good in hot weather and would go well with some chirizo tacos. Nice and velvety smooth in the mouth but a touch sticky. Low alcohol, nice weight, and pleasant taste makes this a good choice for summer parties."
"A: Medium copper color, healthy head on a hard pour that dropped quickly, quite transparent - 3.50, S: Unquestionably a cream ale on the nose, lots of smooth and subtle sweetness, what must by crystal malt and possibly a touch of wheat?? - 3.50, T: The slightest sign of hops on the tail of this beer, a crisp lager, some bubblegum sweetness - 3.50, M: 4.00, D: A nice beer for hot day, quite refreshing, not generally my style but a good representation of a cream ale, a little on the side of being too sweet - 3.50"
"The mouthfeel is slightly creamy with a light carbonation to carry it along, very easy drinking, the alcohol is a bit too high for the drinkability."
"D- Very! Goes down easy (ha...ha...). Almost drank this one too fast. Great ""sit by the river/beach/roof/lawn"" kind of beer. Thirst quenching and very refreshing."
"Red-amber in color it was poured with no head, medium carbonation, with a tinge of cloudiness. A definite caramel nose was confirmed by the first sip which was a bit on the cloying side. No hopping to speak of. The more I drank the more I was reminded of cheap caramel candy. The finish was pedestrian. I was glad to finish this one. I won't be having another."
"Not the typical zesty, highly carbonated summer beer that I usually expect when I pick one of these up, but nonetheless pretty tasty and something I could see myself enjoying after a good bike ride or hike."
"Poured a cloudy orange with a two-finger head and some lacing. A mix of sweet malts and some tart fruity hops. Light-bodied and smooth, this is an easy beer to go down. Has a lot of sweetnees thanks to the malts (mostly caramel), and has some tart fruit flavors tucked in the background (pear rinds, apples). Finishes clean. Definite lawnmower beer that is enjoyable over a macro anyday."
"The taste is very sweet, almost like taffy or candied fruits. There is a ton of very sweet caramel malts, the distinct vanilla flavors of an old fashioned cream soda, some apple and pear flavors. The beer is not overly carbonated, and not as syrupy thick as it may seem by appearances. The beer is very nice, very interesting and refreshing, and a real change up type of beer. If you're in the mood for a candied fruit type experience, or have a yen for an old fashioned cream soda from an embossed bottle, or want some caramel taffy, than this is your beer. The mouthfeel is quite light, the aftertaste has some of sweetness lingering. L'Chaim."
"T/M/D: Honey and spices offer contrasting but complementary malts and hops. A little watery at moments in the sip (light body). Drinks like a lager with medium carbonation and great drinkability. I've had this one twice now and there is definitely metallic note upon each sip. Caramel sweetness comes out with warmth. This beer is great for a summer day, but also worked surprisingly well as a dessert drink. I look forward to the rest of this 6er. Well done, AVBC!"
"D: I like the variation of a summer brew, something different. I was expecting a wheat type of beer and was wonderfully surprised by a tasty cream ale"
"D - A single pint or maybe a couple 12 oz. bottles, but no more than that. The label says that it is ""oh-so drinkable"" and as a ""warm weather beer"". I disagree, feeling this beer is more reserved for tasting and not out by the pool in warm weather."
"As this is noted a seasonal beer I can only imagine that it has been sitting on the beer store shelves for quite some time - as a reviewer below mentioned, this beer may have mellowed quite a bit from when it was first bottled - unfortunately I did not notice a date. I'll definitely have to try this again in the summer."
"Pours dark amber in color with no head forming on the pour. Smell is slightly spicy and very fainlty hopped. Not much going on in the taste. Some fruity flavors, very weak hops. This is a pretty weak flavored beer. Very muted and watered down. Not a whole lot going on here. I'll wait for the Winter Solstice to come out."
"A truly wonderful, malty, refreshing summer beer. Though I may not pony up the dough for this beer with any great regularity, I certainly wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers."
"Drinkability- I could drink this one all summer, and if I had one summer beer that I could pick, this would be the one. Excellent job from Anderson Valley and I am eager to search out the winter solstice as well."
"Solid refreshing summer brew."
"Notes from 9/15/05"
"Pretty drinkable. Rather interesting."
"The taste is again mostly unpasteurized, unfiltered apple juice, especially up front. However, it has a light toasty bread element and a hint of burnt buttery caramel. It's faintly sweet, with otherwise only a faint apple tartness up front and the light toasty element to balance. it really is very subdued in flavour and rather bland, but pleasant, somewhat interesting in the character that it has, and drinkable. it goes pretty well with food."
"I only had one bottle and can imagine giving a higher rating after having a few more. Maybe next summer..."
"Think Scotch Ale Light. It's too sweet for me to enjoy alone. I believe that a pungent cheese or a spiced appetizer (I'm thinking something with dill) might make this beer more palatable."
"Not sure I'd pay the price on too many occasions though, twice as much as other beers of equal or better taste."
"A great beer for the warm weather and very clean, considering what it's comprised of. This beer is made for sitting up in Mendocino county by the river on a hot day and watching the birds play in the water."
"Slightly sweet, dominated by light and toasty caramel malts. Easy to drink quickly but a little cloying in the long run due to the uncomplicated flavor profile and lack of bitterness or discernable hop character. Best way to have this would probably be cold on a hot day."
"Was quite surprised at the color, texture and taste of this SUMMER beer. It drinks very nice. I detected a great amount of carmel in this beer as it sat and ""aged"" a bit in the glass. A rich, creamy head is certainly a nice component of this beer. It is the first I have drank from Anderson Valley. I found it intriguing enough to want to try a few more from this brewery."
"Never had a cream ale this dark, and it's pretty enjoyable! Smooth (and creamy) with some decent flavors. Recommended."
"Summer Solstice pours a deep, clear, rustic orange with a nice lid of modestly creamy caramel-toned cream color. It's malty, but not heavy. Some caramel and vanilla with a touch of strawberry cream. Medium body with a good amount of soft, light and creamy carbonation. While it's not quite my thing, it is a good cream ale and a different take on a summer seasonal. Pretty nice beer."
"Medium-dark amber with a small, slightly off-white, creamy head that quickly diminishes to a film. The smell is floral, fruity and lightly sweet. The taste is sweet, fruity and lightly spicy. Apple, doughy malts, caramel, melon, vanilla. It has a medium body, smooth, creamy texture and moderate-low carbonation. This was a very enjoyable summer beer. Not at all cloying but a good bit of character. Worth a try for sure."
"Pours a surprisingly dark chestnut with a creamy head and some scattered lacing. The aromas are very light, but there is a light nuttiness and creaminess as well as some sweet malt. Taste is likewise nutty, creamy, a touch roasty, and with maybe a touch of vanilla and cinnamon. Very smooth and creamy, so quite drinkable and refreshing while having a bit of body. A different take on a summer seasonal."
"Bought single bottle - no dating. Was surprised to see a summer beer that was dark reddish/brown/ glimpses of ruby. Verry pretty. Slight head that holds fairly well - beer looks good. Smell hard to tell - some malt hint of fruit. Taste - kind of average with again hints of fruit - I may be way off base here but I got kind of a hint of cough medicine/cherry? Mouthfeel - a little less than average carbed. Wasn't loving the feel or the flavor - I may try again earlier in the season because something just didn't seem right."
"Not a bad tasting brew and heaven knows I don't have a lot of experience with Cream Ales but...this is not one that I'd seek out. Just too average to my palate."
"Clear copper. Thin dirty white head. Lace comes in sporadic rings. Smells pretty sweet. Cream ale sweet. Which is good. Sweet caramely flavor too. This summer solstice is actually reminiscent to their Winter Solstice in the candy like sweet maltiness. Only it's held in check here a little more. Really a nice level creamy sweetness here. Hops are negligible as they should be. The mouthfeel?? You guessed it. Creamy. Lightly carbonated with just the slightest prick of CO2. Can't find any fault with this as it is. Nice beer."
"Light-bodied, with medium-carbonation. Easy drinking - though not what I quite would look for in a summer brew. Caramel was a bit too strong in aroma and flavor."
"On tap at the Moan and Dove. The beer settled with a dark amber appearance and a thin but creamy head. Aromas had a great malty spice kick to it that was incredibly appetizing. Overall taste was creamy and malty, making a wicked sweet summer drink. Mouthfeel helped make the drink creamy but I felt it was a little flat texture-wise. Overall, a tasty treat."
"D: Drank like a sweet amber and had a very creamy and smooth drinkability factor."
"D: As a beer it has its good points but in the end I just found it mediocre. Honestly, they should probably drop a lot of the hops out of this and concentrate on the malt profile of this beer, it was by far my favourite part. After that it could be a good summer refresher, but right now for me the malt and hop flavours conflict instead of complementing each other."
"D- Too sweet for me. This one was a big dissapointment in my book, didn't enjoy it at all."
"D - Nice. Worth a try and worth having again. For a cream (or brown) ale, this is enjoyable."
"This beer was a malty mess in my humble opinoin. Pours a slightly hazy amber with 1 finger off-white head with no retention or lacing. Smell is of malt, some biscuit, and an overall ""off"" scent. Taste is the same, malty, malty, malty. Really dont notice much else I have to say. Maybe I just dont get this one, I dont know. Lower carbonation leaves a medium mouthfeel, that was the one thing I didnt mind about the beer, it did go down smooth. Overall just not impressed and will most likely not revisit."
"I had this beer on tap at the Grey Lodge in Philly. I thought that this beer was definitely worth getting my growler filled with. It poured a nice chestnut brown with a thin white head. The smell was consisted of candy sugar, spices, hops, and malts. The taste was a very well balanced mix of the candied sugars, spices, malts, and hops. The mouthfeel was sweet and delicious and the drinkability was very easy. A great summer beer to enjoy anywhere!"
"-Oelergud"
"Full mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Maybe a little too thick and chewy for the low ABV and lack of complexity. Pretty drinkable."
"Pours a dark brown red with minimal white head. Light malty aroma with minimal sweetness. Solid malt taste with hops and a slightly floral aftertaste. Very smooth with light carbonation and medium bodied. A nice session beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The velvety texture is punctuated by a crisp, slightly aggressive introduction that livens the tip of the tongue. Slick as it is in the mouth, the swallow isn't magical as it might seem. It's an easy, drinkable beer that could absolutely be enjoyed one after another at the poker table."
"Assumed by the name ""Summer Solstice"" it was a wheat beer, and that was entirely incorrect. Nonetheless. Appearance is solid, amber color with a two finger head that leaves alright lacing. Nose is quiet toffee malt, a kind of smooth butteriness to it. Very mild. Taste is similar. Very mild caramel malt. Kind of reminds me of a Killians, both in terms of taste and intensity of flavor (AKA mild as hell). Light spiciness on the front of the tongue (and I had to search for it). There's just not a lot going on here. Very mild citrus. Body is medium, a little thin, but it's not carrying any flavor, so I don't really care. Overall, there's just no point to drinking this one."
"Decent stuff but all in all nothing to write home about..."
"Poured a deep rich amber. Nice head,with decent retention,and good lacing. Aroma is of sweet bread,and malt. Body is medium, with a bit of carbonation. Taste is bready, and malted. Sweet and smooth from start to finish. Good beer, but could'nt have more than one or two at a time."
"Not my cup of tea at all... and really the vanilla should be in a cup of tea. I don't ever see the brew being refreshing in summer on any other time of year... first drain pour in recent memory."
"MF/D: Interesting texture - it's silky, and very drinkable, certainly living up to it's name Cerveza Crema. I wouldn't recommend it for summer months personally, thinking that the texture and slight weight doesn't really lend itself to session drinking, but I'd kick off an evening BBQ with a round of these, for sure."
"Overall on of the strangest of summer beers I have ever had ofr sure. Not really something I would seek out again thats for sure. Maybe next time I will try it next year and see if it changes any."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of medium brown, with a thick full head - nose of sweet malt, pink popcorn, and hint of spice  taste of kettle corn, malt, and slight orange- body is semi sweet , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of malts, kettle corn, and some acidity"
"D: This could be a good summer beer, except I'm not much of a fan of the taste. This one is drinkable, but not one that I would be willing to drink again."
"Some may say its a bit intense for a cream, but its right up my alley. It didnt fit the cookie cutter standard for a cream, and Im giving it extra points for that. Don't see this one all to often here, but if it shows up, I'll jump on a 6-pack!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into piza port glass. Nice foam retention with a white head set off by a red copperish color based with amber. The smell hints at light sugar and spice. The taste reflects creamy vanilla honey malt with a very low bitter off set. Mouth feel is light with a pop that makes it an easy drinking beer ."
"Drank four of these in one night, very drinkable"
"Mostly malty aroma, with a hint of something extra. The flavor is mostly malty, but there is a good balance of hop spiciness which makes it just a little bit bolder than the usual light summer fare, but just light enough to refresh on a hot day."
"Drinkability: Great taste that keeps me interested, with a nice aftertaste, but the whole experience is lacking a little. For the complexity of the mouthfeel and the taste, I would like to see a little more depth in body, and some more aromatic qualities."
"A cream ale with some attitude, a definite fruitiness,peaches and cream, though the finish is a bit odd. Overall on the very sweet side, though quite tasty. I am of the school that this is not a summer beer, which I would imagine something Kolsch, rather a cream soda substitute.Full mouthfeel."
"D - A sweet ale w/ pleasant malt and decent drinkability w/ mild spice and malty goodness. A good choice for a late summer seasonal. The butterscotch flavor and medium-light body keep it going down smooth like a iced caramel machiato."
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Color was a nice dark red amber color, with a bubbly head. The last didn't last longer then a minute except for a very small ring around the top of the beer. Aroma smelled slightly sweet, almost like a candied orange. Flavor reminded of a winter seasonal, spicy, but still smooth. Felt great in the mouth. Nice and creamy, just enough to coat and linger inside the mouth, but not so much to be syrupy. Left a touch of spicy bitterness in the back of the mouth. Very easy to drink, went down well."
"A very nice, very unusual beer that I love. But don't expect your typical summer ale - this is heavier and sweeter than others you might group with it."
"Overall a good summer ale. When I think summer ale I think of a beer that is refreshing like lemonade and this one meets that criteria. I don't think the six pack will last much longer than a hour or two."
"This beer was rather light and sessionable, as is typically the case with summer ales. The lack of flavor however would make me want to stop drinking this after only a few."
"Worth a try."
"Clear rusty orange with a sticky, yellowish head. The aroma is faint sweet and toasted malts, sort of like sugary toffee and butterscotch with a hint of vanilla and orange. Nice, but timid. A slick sweetness stays upfront in the taste and works well with some spices and toasted grains. Its a pleasant, refreshing blend of flavors...actually, its reminding me a little of candy corn, which isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. As it warms up, the flavor becomes more interesting and pronounced. Solid, smooth mouthfeel goes down nicely. This is a quality and, perhaps more importantly, different (no lemon and wheat) summer seasonal."
"Drinkability -very approachable for both casual drinkers and craft fans. Pricy at $10 per sixer but I'd get it again."
"Drinkability is good, nothing really present to make this hard to swallow."
"Overall, a summer beer that carries a fresh orange taste. On the darker side, which makes it even more intriguing. Very cool label with the bears with antlers and sunglasses. Cryptic writing under the cap:""Chipmunk the heelch of the Boont steinbier"". Huh? Hilarious. I'm happy with this one, except the price ($11.99/6pk)."
"In hindsight, this was actually fairly similar to their winter solstice, no coincidence I'm sure. This was a amber/copper color, darker than any other cream ale I've encountered, with an incredibly smooth malt profile to back it up. There was strong spice note that was almost fruity and earthy. It was a touch heavy, but it was still nice to drink and tasty."
"A very interesting twist for a summer beer. A dark amber hue with a white head. It had the aroma of sweet malt, but it was a bit faint. In the taste, it was a sweet malt that ended with a gingerbread cookie aftertaste. Interesting, but a bit sweet for me on a regular basis."
"Very drinkable and a typical creme ale. Good representation of the style."
"This beer pours a copper red color (as promised), with a decent amount of heads which fades to a consistent coating across the top of the beer. Aroma is rather balanced; malt, hops and ""spice"" all sort of meld together. More and more I'm noticing mouthfeel before flavor...it is a bit watery but rather effervescent and pleasant simultaneously. Flavor is malty and sweet and not really all that great. I don't think this beer is all that drinkable, and I don't believe I'll be having this again."
"D: Goes down smooth, a very interesting beer. Very well suited for the summer months."
"Not too quaffable for a hot day but definately good to try one."
"Gorgeous ruby red/amber color. Two finger head dissipates leaving a ring with some clouds. Smell is faintly creamy and malty. The flavor is like Boont Light... Caramel, vanilla, and toffee, no real hop presence until the end. Mouthfeel is satisfying, and a little less sticky than it's big brother. Anderson Valley has a summer beer, and it's called Poleeko Gold. I love AV, and I expected more from this than watered down Boont."
"Good session brew, unexpected and not very much something I might go for on hot day. But then again, a good alternative to the usual summer offerings."
"D - Excellent drinkability. Definite session. Best cream ale I have ever had."
"Fairly drinkable, I may get tired of this brew after a few but very much worth trying and appreciating."
"Overall Impression: Drinks like iced tea. Easy going, refreshing, fun beer. Its a shame that it arrived so late in Texas (were closer to the Winter Solstice than the Summer at this point) but Im glad to see it anyway."
"A nice summer ale."
"Beer pours an amber color with a decent lasting white head. Nose is of citrusy malts and a hint of vanilla. Taste is sweet maltiness with no pronounced hop presence. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth as the name implies. Overall drinkability is pretty good. This is not a bad effort by one of my favorite breweries but is a bit too sweet for me."
"Medium heft of a body, mild in alcoholic content yet quite tasty and very easy to drink. A good rendition of the style."
"Overall impression: Nice beer - not sure about it as a summer seasonal though. I guess it is nice to have a bit of variety out there - but this is a bit thicker than I would have expected."
"I really like the flavor of this beer. It's nutty, with caramel overtones and a nice, lingering finish. Would definitely drink again!"
"Another good beer from Anderson valley. Keep up the good work!!!"
"I only had a couple, I dont know if I could have drank another one if available  just a bit on the sweet side"
"Appears an amber color cream hued head quite surprising for a cream ale head forms thick and leaves even lacing down the pint glass. Aroma has some eviden corn and cooked veggies with mild grassy hop character and caramel malt presence as well. Taste is quality nice caramel amber malts mix of corn sweetness light grassy hop finish very tasty and not overbearing in any way. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied evenly carbonated very smooth with somewhat notable texture. Drinkability is great compared to my past experiences with the style but Anderson Valley decided to add some specialty malts, thank the beer gods."
"This pours a a dark orange with a large tan head. The smell is weak,but I could make out an earthy floral aroma along with a malt sweetness. The taste has a sweet malt creaminess to it that's nice. Other flavors include bread yeast, sweet malt, and some hop bitterness. The m/f is light and well balanced making this a different,but good beer. Cheers."
"D - Good here. I wouldn't have a problem hammering a few of these back."
"12 oz bottle pours a cloudy tea brown color with a nice creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Sweet bread aromas, fruity strawberry, vanilla, apple and caremel flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel. Very refreshing on a hot day."
"The flavor presents a rather curious sour malt nuance, and while not necessarily unpleasant, neither is it anticipated. What ultimately makes it drinkable is the dry, crisp turn at the end, letting the palate breathe a bit after the acidic foray. Like other AV beers, this one too will disappear from my fridge, but unlike the others, this one will take some time longer."
"Pours a solid amber color with a decent sized white head that displays good lacing in my glass. Smells sweet and malty, with some caramel and pretty much no bitterness. Taste is thick and mouthfilling, with the malts covering the mouth and going down really smooth. This is a nice beer to drink, a little heavy for summer i'd say, but nonetheless easily sessionable."
"D: Well, its a summer beer so know what you are getting. Bit sweet and cloying for a hot day, not refreshing enough. I prefer its winter counterpart much more."
"This beer pours amber in color with a small white head that dissipates quickly. A good amount of lacing on the glass. It smell is sweet with hints of caramel. Its taste is also sweet, with aftertaste of caramel, candy, and orange rind. It's strong in carbonation. Would have one or two of these, but not really a session beer in my opinion. Overall, a very solid brew."
"This beer poured with a small head. The color is similar to a rich pale ale. The smell is fruity and hoppy. The taste is goood. There is a hoppiness to it and also hints of vanilla. The mouthfeel is smooth. This is an easy drinking beer. Probably the best summer type beer I have had. I will drink this beer again."
"Overall a surprisingly good summer quencher (just like the back label describes). I adore the nose on this one quite a lot. The tartness and spice flavor reminds me of Petrus Christmas Ale which pleasantly surprised me. I could see myself polishing off a few of these on a hot summer day. This ale demonstrates the versatility, craftsmanship and quality of this fine brewery. A good ale for sure."
"Though this is a unique brew, I dont think I will be picking this one up again. The flavor just doesnt say beer to me."
"Pours a light brown with orange highlights, topped by a half-inch of creamy white head that disippates in about a minute. Aroma of light sweet malt with notes of allspice, clove, and vanilla. Palate is a medium malt profile with a slight metallic tinge and a hint of hops, accompanied by some mellow spices - mainly vanilla and clove. Body is actually a little thicker than I like in a cream ale, but not too much to handle. A tasty brew, much more interesting than I was expecting. However, it is just a bit too heavy to be the summer thirst quencher it purports to be."
"D - Tough to get down cuz of all the flavors randomly bombarding your tongue."
"drinkability: high"
"Cheers!"
"Overall a pretty good beer and probably one of the best creme ales I've had."
"A fave brewery delivers again."
"Wow...what a full-body for a ""summer"" beer. The moutfeel is incredibly creamy and full, and I could not imagine having more than 2 or 3 of these. The taste is mild: English malty backbone, with a hint of fruity hopiness. Overall, there is not much here."
"Very easy to drink beer, will be something to serve on warm summer days and drink happily. Beats most other 'Cerveza' style brews out there."
"Certainly a drinkable light cream ale. Could have used a bit more flavor though."
"D - Very refreshing on a warm summer day while maintaining more flavor than typical summers brews."
"This is like drinking the beer version of a cream soda, but in a good way. This is the kind of beer that is great after a hot day to have one or two, but not sure about its session beer potential."
"On-tap at Cole's. Hazy copper with a moderate but dense yellowed-newsprint head. Much darker than expected! Aromas are very subtle, but what I pick up are caramel, vanilla, and sickly-sweet soured malts -- not exactly appetizing, but interesting nonetheless. The taste is sweet, but not in a cloying or overpowering way. Absolutely no hops to speak of, yet I would not call this a malt-bomb. There is a certain nuttiness and that same bowl-of-water-and-barley-that-got-left-out-in-the-sun-too-long characteristic that I picked up in the nose. At the finish there is a distinctly vanilla cream-soda flavor that brings it home and the toasty malt aftertaste ties it all together. Mouthfeel is heavier than expected, but still on the lighter side of medium-bodied with enough carbonation to make you pay attention. Creamy as well, of course. Super drinkable. Nice summer brew! Can't wait to pick up a sixer when they arrive out here."
"This beer pours like a 20 year old scotch! It's color seems to give it more gravity then is possible. The appearance is like a cousin's BBQ, clear with a hint of fog on the way. The smell of this brew is ... well let me just say that it reminds me of the honeymoon that I have yet to have. The taste, mouth feel and drinkability kind of speak for themselves, leaving my taste buds screaming for more. Buy this beer, Drink this beer as often as you can. It is worth it !!!."
"D: Have had up to 3 bottles at one sitting. A local pub had it on tap recently and my wife and split (equally) a 60 oz. pitcher between us. Quite drinkable, though after a while the all-malt/no-hop character tends to get slightly old (after you've had 30+ oz... :) ). A great summer beer."
"Totally refreshing and bursting with flavor, how could you go wrong? Moderate carbonation, medium-light bodied. Good alternative to the always refreshing Pilsener or Hefeweizen."
"I felt this was a great blend for the summer. Im excited to have it again"
"This was just wonderful. It was delicious, smelled great, and was really easy to drink. I will look for this again on-tap."
"Pours a rich amber. Thin head,with decent retention,and good lacing. Aroma is of sweet bread,and malt. Body is medium, with a bit of carbonation. Taste is bready, and malted. Sweet and smooth from start to finish. Good beer, but could'nt have more than one or two at a time."
"Notes: Its OK but not one I'll pursue. It has some cake likeness to it that just doesn't fit my palate."
"Overall- nothing special here, a surprise from Anderson Valley. A beer to try but I won't be drinking again."
"I could drink a few of these."
"D: You could quaff a 6-er no problem and cruise thru a stiflingly warm Sacramento summer in style."
"I hope for this beer's sake that it was just a bad bottle."
"This is a nice summer brew, and a nice change of pace from the crisp and dry summer offerings. Not quite a lawnmower beer, it's more of a beer you would drink in the warm evning after the mowing is done."
"Pours an amber color with a medium head that has nice retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma reminds me of wheat, pears, and seems to have some toastiness in there. Smells nice. The flavor is a little spicy at the front, followed by some sweetness and caramel flavors from the malt. Toffee comes to mind. Quite tasty. The body is moderate and the drinkability is quite good."
"Thanks, BeerBeing"
"Drinkability and Notes  Definitely has a thicker body tan a lot of summer beers, but still super drinkable. For my second homebrew we made a cream ale with vanilla that was nowhere near as good as this, so I appreciate this beer a lot."
"Notes: unusual brew, very sweet and velvetty smooth"
"A very solid and tasty beer. I got one bottle as part of a sampler pack and have not been able to find this wonderful beer since. It pours a nice reddish-orange color with a thick head. Smell is sweet, a little caramel or sugar and vanilla. My first impression of the taste was marshmallows. The sweetness is not overpowering though and balanced well with malty undertones. Mouthfeel is medium. Overall a great cream ale, one I wish was available on the East coast."
"Drinkability: Over the past few months this beer has become a staple in our household. I figured by now I should write a review on one of my favorite daily drinkers. This beer pairs well with grilled foods, fish, and pasta. All around this is a highly drinkable and well balanced beer. It is refreshing and crisp but also full bodied enough to pair with stronger flavors. Well done."
"Well, this beer is an example of that. It is such an easy-drinking, smooth, non-aggressive beer, that you could down a six pack (especially in the hot summer months for which it is intended) in no time. It is a slightly hazy golden coppery color, with a little caramel sweetness in the nose. The taste is more of the same -- a light honeyed or caramel sweetness that indicates the light roastiness of the malts, and enough hoppiness (not much) to keep the beer balanced and the finish dry enough to want another sip. This is your dad's beer, only better. I, for one, like it. NOTE: This would be a GREAT brew to start converting a macro swill drinker."
"Kudos to Anderson Valley for the vision and the skill to pull off a true original. A summertime cream ale that is, at once, flavorful, interesting and sessionable. If I was lucky enough to be in AV's distribution area, Summer Solstice Cerveza Crema would have a permanent place in my refrigerator. Very well done."
"This is a pretty tasty summer seasonal. Next summer I hope to grab a few more of these. This is a pretty decent session beer, and is a good choice as a beer that is interesting tasting yet still a safe bet for those Bud swillin' friends that are scared of those ""dark"" beers."
"Drinkability is ok. a little too much though for a Summer brew. Seems like this is the Winter Solstice that's been watered down considerably."
"Pours a dark copper color with nice carbonation and a small head. Leaves a nice bit of lacing. Nice malty, spicy scents. There's a nice sweet taste, malty, with some orange notes. Medium Body. This is an awesome session beer, very easy to drink. When I first took a sip I knew this is a totally different kind of beer, I highly recommend this beer to everyone, to at least try it once, but I'm sure you will try it again and again."
"Summer solstice is a nice name for this smooth clear copper colored ale. Poured a slight head, which had decent retention and lacing. The scent was sweet and spicy. Light fruits, such as apples and pears. Drink it cold. The slight hops flavor is spicy. Overall this is a nice beer to enjoy. Very unique blend of sweet malts and spice."
"Pours a nice dark copper color with a 1 finger head and pretty good lace. Wonderful aroma - tart apple with some toffee and sweet caramel malt. Taste is again tart apple with some toffee and even a bit of orange. Little hop presence. Its mouth feel is creamy and dry - very malty but not in an icky way. I don't consider this a refreshing beer but it is a very good brew. Pick some up."
"The taste was a sour/tart apple flavor, with spices and hops, only when really cold did I get this taste. When warming, in the glass, the flavor turned to an uninteresting spicey sour taste with not much flavor. You have to drink this beer COLD!"
"Rusty amber, dark--especially for a ""summer"" beer! I say good. Persistent, creamy, light sandy head. Smells of rich, sweetish cookie dough with yeasty, bready underpinnings. Light hop spice backing. Malty flavors up front: doughy sweetness and some spice (?). A little vanilla-y flavor. Turns pleasantly and moderately bitter with baking spice and yeast. Interesting and good. Medium bodied with a creamy feel. Not as full-bodied as the winter solstice, but nice, and not as vanilla-y."
"Pours a deep amber with thick tan head, a darker cream ale than most. Aroma is sweet cream, orange and caramel. Taste is somewhat similar to their amber ale, but more malty with sweet cream and orange flavors with a lighter citrus hops attack. Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation, very drinkable and refreshing...excellent summer beer."
"Overall: Lovely. I may venture to go the whole hog and pick up a Sixer of this one, quite the tasty brew, superb Mouthfeel and a lovely spicy finish. Worth seeking out whilst it lasts!"
"Pours a dark copper/amber color. Small off white head with small to medium bubbles. Smell has a hint of sweetness, very light. The taste is malty, kind of like a light bock type of flavor. Slight chocolate. Chocolate/vanilla flavor grows as the beer warms. Lemon aftertaste? Dark with no head Not at all what I was expecting from a summer brew. A bit too thick and creamy malty to be a summer session beer. I could really see enjoying this more on a cool fall afternoon. Or in the spring after drinking imperial stouts and barleywines all winter. This is not as boring as most summer beers, just doesnt fit with me in the heat."
"This beer was amazing. One of my favorites. For a summer beer and how AVB makes there seasonals usually a little darker and with a lot of spices. This beer when poured into a glass was an darker amber color with little head. Had the taste of vanilla and roasted malts. Keep making this beer."
"Drinkability is ok not bad. Hell never having a cream ale before it might be the best for the style, but it is a style I don't see myself trying to find again."
"Drinkable? I suppose... I can really see this being a good picnic beer, something to take to the beach with the hot dogs and chips. I had two non-beer drinkers in the room who normally find my IPAs or Strong Ales much too aggressive and both pronounced this a 'very drinkable brew' so it may be a good crossover beer for people unfamiliar with craft brews."
"As a summer type thirst quencher, this would be a good one. You wouldn't think so after pouring it, but it's so damn smooth and silky."
"Drinkability is off the scale. This is one damn tasty beer! Assertive in all respects without being tiring, Best beer I has tasted all year. This one cost me $10 for the six pack and it is worth every penny!"
"Pours a deep copper with a one finger fizzy-like head that is gone pretty quickly leaving no lace behind,lighter aromas on the malty side a touch of roastiness and some nuts in there as well.Malt dominated flavors lightly sweet even more so in the finish pretty grainy and lighter in the mouthfeel department.There is a spice in this brew that I cant put my finger on,Iam thinking vanilla the more I drink but not quite sure.A pretty good offering and highly drinkable good for the summer months for sure."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, yet malty scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It is sweet with a light hop aroma. The taste is great. It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes sweet and creamy. It boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with some light hops. The mouthfeel is great also. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an excellent beer. What's not to like? It goes well with hot or cold climates; a good drinker."
"Overall not a great beer, but a good summer quaffer..I took no time at all polishing off the single I bought. Enjoyable."
"This unique, creamy, and lightly sweet copper colored ale has a beautiful, long-lasting head that leaves wide splashes and streaks of lace about the glass. Its charming, enticing, wonderful aroma is reminiscent of strawberry shortcake; and it's perfectly suited for a summer beer. In the mouth it's medium-full bodied, and creamy smooth across the palate with a moderate carbonation the just lightly tingles the tongue. The flavor delivers a sweet bed of vanilla-cookie-like malt that has just a hint of caramel to it, and a delicate yeasty fruitiness that's reminiscent of strawberries. It's low-level bitterness barely appears, and it's just sweet enough to satisfy without becoming candyish It finishes drying, with some residual fruitiness and a lingering note of vanilla. Simply put... wonderful!"
"This beer has a subtle resemblance to it's cousin, winter solstice. The copper coloring and tint give a smell of wheaty caramel and toasted honey. The taste is that of creamy, sweet, spicy velvet. It's bit heavier than the usual summer brew but oh so drinkable. I can't think of anything better on a hot, lazy summer day."
"A tasty switch from the usual pale summer brews."
"Possibly my new favorite Anderson Valley brew as it boasts all of the good things of an ESB without and of the shortcomings..."
"Way over the top on the cream soda vanilla taste -- and way against expectations. A summer seasonal beer shouldn't be this dark -- reading the title I think a light cream ale, like a creamy mexican-stlye lager. And definitely not something this overpowering in taste and this heavy. Could barely get this down."
"The taste is lightly sweet up front, and my first overall impression is that this is like drinking the beer version of cream soda. The beer is fairly light on the palate, with a finish that has a carbonic bite to it. I really do like the soda analogy for this beer, I am reminded of both a light rootbeer, and a cream soda, caramel popcorn would also be an apt flavor analogy. I am really curious as to what the spices were in this beer. Overall this is definitely and interesting beer to try, though I am not sure that I would want more of it."
"I love cream soda...and this is cream soda in beer form...Appearance is nice...dark copper, but with little head. Smell is malty and vanilla..inviting! Taste is malt nad vanilla...very smooth with slight hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth with a hint of dryness in the finish. Smooth on the palate...good drinkability."
"The beer evacuates the 12-ounce brown bottle a crystal clear mahogany color with a modest semi-creamy light tan head that evaporates rather quickly leaving a fine covering of lace upon the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, hints of caramel, with a touch of vanilla; start is sweet with a fair to middling grain presence and the top light to medium in feel. Finish as a pleasant acidity with the hops pleasing in their spiciness, aftertaste dry and a nice beer on this hot 2nd day of June 2005."
"Please keep sending fresh Anderson Valley beer to Boston!!!"
"drinkablitly: great for warm weather. very good ice cold but good lighly chilled as well. uh...two thumbs up..."
"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a sturdy beer mug, the head couldn't be more perfect: rises at a mid-level pace, light tan (white, with light brown highlights), fair retention. A thin collar of lace clings to the glass. The body is dark, translucent amber. Smell: Subtle drop of vanilla extract, slight grassy hop presence and caramel maltiness on the finish. Taste: Ah, nice kick of creamy vanilla upfront, encompassing my entire palate, the middle brings out the vanilla even more by being balanced out against a black peppery hop profile, and some soft malt sweetness. The finish is a powder sugar sweetness, as the vanilla is all played out, and very thin hop bitterness. Slick mouthfeel, plenty carbonated. Great summer beer, better than the usual summer (read: boring) offerings from otherwise awesome breweries."
"I never used to be much of a seasonal summer beer fan, but it seems more breweries these days have been able to strike the balance between flavor, drinkability, and refreshment than ever before. The Boonville addition is certainly one of them."
"Drinkability- I would have taken this brew over just about all of them if it was available when I was in Cancun last October. Different, tasty and refreshing."
