"Feel - Not much left to be desired. Not much really lingers on the tongue."

"Almost black with mild red highlights, big redish creamy head with solid retention. Coffee and roasted malt, sweet taste , medium carbonation, bitter honey and sweet cherry. Watery light body with low to medium carbonation. Chocolate and licorice, favorite winter porter. Very good overall."

"A bottle from the lcbo, good lacing and a pleasant roasty spicy aroma, a bit vegetal. Taste is smooth, with a gentle bitterness with a really nice English hop profile, long drying finish. Pleasant drinkability, good balanced porter."
"This one pours as a very attractive beer. Plenty of brown foam with satisfying light roast malts flavours. Feels great swirling around the mouth. Beautiful Wychwood additional. Will look for this one again."

"Overall - a pretty damn good stout, with great feel and certainly a mysterious quality as advertised. It's a bit of a strange brew with black licorice, orchard fruits and a toffee base somehow mixed together but yet worthy. This is one of the best I've had from Wychwood."

"Final Grade: 3.75, a B+. Wychwood's Black Wych is a proper English-style dark ale - a bold malt bill that takes centre stage, but is kept in check by a combination of roasted notes and the leafy English hop bitterness. Combine that with an enjoyable mouthfeel and relatively low abv, and you've got the recipe for one highly serviceable session porter. This is not an especially remarkable beer, but I have no major objections and it's definitely one of the better products I've tried from this brewery over the years."

"Overall a great beer from an outstanding brewery, definitely worth a try at least once. Fantastic color is enough to make it notable."

"Current bottle and official website describe this one as a (robust?) porter. Not bad, though the roasty, nearly acrid quality dominates without much else to round out the flavor."

"The best by date on this bottle is August 2009, one and a half years ago but seems like it held up well besides a slight earthy funk on the nose. The key characteristics of this stout that attracted me are the pleasantly concocted roasted malt flavors along with the light lactic notes as well as the creamy smooth texture. Not bad, not great but definitely refreshing and sessionable."
"Overall this is a solid stout, but not exactly a memorable one - it's well made, but doesn't really stand out in any dimension unfortunately."
"All in all, a very nice stout. Nice complexity"
"D- This is an easy stout to drink. Of course this would be great with a beef stew or bbq'd steak with a rich sauce. I like this beer and think it's a great session beer for the pub with friends. This stout is different from the norm somewhat and I recommend for those who want something unique in this style."
"Overall: Well, nice to try once, not my favorite beer of this style at all"
"Final Thoughts: I dunno, I think the marketing might have swayed my review a bit, but I was expecting a bit more diversity, maybe some sweetness or odd hopping or welcome bizarreness. What I found was a mild stout, which certainly beat the curve but I wouldn't call remarkable. I think Nitro would have really helped this out out."
"I wouldn't consider the beer to be spell binding (bear in mind that this style of stout rarely is). Those stout lovers with insatiable appetites and the indulgent sweet-tooth might find themselves left with much to be desired, but this should be a well considered option for those who enjoy a mild mannered, easily quaffed pint of stout. It didn't put any spells on me, but I'd still say it's worth a look if you're one to dabble in the black arts."
"A solid stout, one I'll certainly pick up again. Go for this one if you like your stouts dryyyy...."
"I had to try this one for the label alone, looked much better then it was, oh well still worth trying"
"I'm a stout fan and this one did not disappoint. I stocked up on these while there here and shall be enjoying them though the colder months. An excellent session beer for sure."
"A decently tasty, if not spell-binding, old-world stout."
"When it comes to beer Wychwood seem to excel at mediocrity. None of their beers that I have tried are exactly horrible, but none are particularly great. They seem to get on shelves and in fridges based on the bottles, names and artwork...not based on the beer."
"Not bad, I'll buy again for sure. But prefer something like the Propeller Porter in this class of beer."
"EDIT: I may have spoken too soon. A bit of warmth has a major impact on this beer. Bitterness settles down quite a bit and helps the flavour come through. Points added to taste."
"Found it quite smooth and easy to drink. Balance was very good. Not complex, but a stright up good session stout."
"An extremely drinkable mild English stout, smooth and inoffensive, with just enough character to keep you interested. I do like a nice drinkable English stout, and this is a good example."
"Weakly sour, with a really annoyingly thin feel, really doesn't grip me with flavour or body. Look it's not a BAD beer, just disappoints me with its lack of flavour. It's reasonably drinkable but just falls flat."
"D: This is a nice stout, but not the best. I'll probably buy this one again."
"The body was a bit disappointing, too weak bodied for a stout. Drinkable and may be a great alternative for Guinness fans in the hot summer months when it would be slightly more refreshing."
"Drinkability: I really like stouts. This is definitely not the most interesting or complex stout out there, but with 5% ABV this would be an excellent session beer. It goes down really easy, so drinkability is high."
"Note: Apparently we used to be able to get this in Ontario. We can still get Hobgoblin I think, but I hear the LCBO has discontinued this brew. What a shame. I'll keep my fingers crossed and have a look around when I'm back home."
"A very good english stout"
"Black Wych, described on the label as a ""Spell Binding Stout"". I am a big fan of stouts, having been brought up by my eldest brother to think of Guinness as the height of manly drinking - thus it was no surprise that my first ever legal beer was a Guinness. These days I steer clear of the Liffey Water, say it quietly but I prefer Beamish of the mass produced Irish stouts - although I am yet to try the O'Hara Stout, but it is high on my list for stuff to try for my birthday weekend in Ireland. But I digress, back to the idyllic English countryside. Black Wych pours dark, very dark, so dark it is practically opaque - I even put it right up next to a light and couldn't see through it. The head was the same colour as comes on an espresso in an Italian caf√©, and boy is this stuff thick. The coffee theme continues in the nose, lots and lots of roasted coffee beans, with a subtle burnt chocolate undertone, which almost smothers a burnt caramel twist. I was excited about this one, and the first mouthful didn't let me down, with the espresso theme of roasted bitterness bursting on to my tongue. However, it wasn't the ""velvety smooth stout"" that the label promised, it is very dry, perhaps some oats would have smoothed it out. Not that it was bad, just not what I was expecting. This was a very fine pint, one that would go well with bowls of stew and open fires in the middle of winter."
"A thick mouthfeel and a nice drinkable beer, I wouldn't mind having a few more. Better than Hobgoblin, Wychwoods best beer I've had so far."
"I liked it however, the weak mouthfeel didn't detract from the overal taste or enjoyment. If the head had stayed and there was more 'meat' in the body, then this would have been a very, very good beer."
"This beer poured an almost black reddish amber color and formed a medium tan foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonization is present. An aroma of malt and some anise is present. The flavor was of malt and burnt coffee with some toffee present. The body is medium light and has a slightly burnt finish. This would make a good session beeer."
"Drinkability : good traditional strong coffee beer in the style English stout"
"A solid, nicely balanced, tasty English stout that is drinkable, even ""sessionable""."
"Drinkability: Wychwood seem to have aimed for a stout you can enjoy for a good session without wrecking your palate, and I reckon they hit that target, but it's a bit, you know, milquetoast. I didn't finish the bottle with the sense of discovery and desire stock the press with it that I got from, say, Fuller's London Porter, and I'm not sure I'll buy some more."
"Note: the bottle was a brown glass bottle (much preferred to the clear glass one)."
"This is a nearly black beer, thick and almost solid in color. The head begins very dense and tan, but falls quickly into a thin and wispy sheet. The aroma is quite nice. Smells of slightly burnt and heavily roasted barley are straightforward and wonderful. There's a bit of fruit and a little coffee and chocolate. Some pepper and a little spice hang in the distance of the aroma. Not bad at all. It's a fairly dry beer, with a little acidic quality. The heavily roasted barley flavor contributes heavily to the beer's character. A little bitterness starts in the mid-taste, and continues through the finish, but is never dominant. There's also a little oily slickness that stays throughout the entire sip. The body is very full and thick, with an incredibly smooth mouthfeel. Good stout."
"Pours a dark red/brown, huge thick tan head forms, nice lacing, good retention, certainly looks like a stout. Smell is sweet, some caramel, coffee/chocolate roast, fruits, interesting. Taste is light and sweet, some toffee, licorice, bit of roast, other wise nothing, very weak in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Not very pleasant, watery, avoid."
"M&D: very smooth, due to the oats in the mix, I suppose, while the carbonation is attenuated, ideal for this style. Overall, this stout benefits from a good length of hop bitterness on top of the usual presence of roastiness, making it a quaffable stout with an enticing kick to hook the palate."
"Too sweet aftertaste. Light roasted."
"Overall - An excellent and well balanced example of a stout.... Recommended !!"
"Mouthfeel: full body, pert carbonation, smooth texture, slight astringency on the teeth"
"Pours a clear but very dark reddish brown under a one finger tan head that settles very slowly, leaving some very nice sheets of lace at first, then settling to strings. The nose has a clear floral pine scent, slightly subdued but unmistakeable. The mouth is light and very well-carbonated. Very interesting taste: it opens like an IPA, slightly sour malt followed by coniferous hoppy bitter. Only much later does a bit of roasted smokiness emerge. The hops never go away, leaving a very floral finish and aftertaste. This is a very taste brew, albeit a rather odd stout."
"I was a bit skepticle at first, what with the clear bottle, but it poured a nice deep brown/mahogany with a decent off-white head. Smell is of roasted barley and chocolate malt. Taste is rich and smooth with a bit of a dry coffee aftertaste. Really a nice all-around stout. It doesn't knock you over the head with chocolate, coffee, smokey-roasted barley or alcohol. It's just a nice, easily drinkable stout. Grab a bottle or two!"
"The novel label threw me off for a long time. I hesitated to purchase this because I was afraid that it wasn't a serious brew. A great surprise. Now if they switch to a brown bottle, as I've heard that they are doing, it will be perfect."
"Nice and dark with lots of lacing. Smell is rich with hints of caramel and roasted malts. Tastes great, roasted malts make their way to a subtle bitterness which leaves for a slight but not overpowering aftertaste. Pretty drinkable, but pretty thick, not something you could drink a bunch of, but certainly is a nice example of an English Stout."
"Well, I like stout and this is a pretty decent one. Really dark and dry. An IPA-like fresh hoparoma. Rather thin to be a stout, but it is like a dry irish stout, with hoppy afterglow. Roasted black malt and oats with a nice finish of progress hops. This is a velvety smooth stout with a full dry and biscuity flavor and a clean cut aromatic bitterness. Light flavor from coffee and/or dark chocolate. Good stuff."
"Smooth English stout, good representation of style. Lower alcohol than the US versions, understated, medium mouthfeel. Smooth easy drink. Great bottle and nice black appearance. Roasty smell. Uncomplicated taste. Not too malted, and malts a taste taken away at end of dryish finish."
"D - Medium. Stouts aren't something I knock back a lot of, and there's nothing special about this one that would make me want to."
"Pours a very dark brown with ruby in places. The head formed was a medium tan and thick, with fairly good retention. Smells malty with a chocolate overtone, quite nice. The taste is sort of woodsy, with a lot of coffee in the finish and some very subtle bitterness. Feels a bit thin, but still very drinkable. A solid beer in my opinion."
"This isn't a bad beer at all, but it is different. Not your mother's English stout. The licorice flavor is quirky, and it's weird how the mouthfeel thins out in the middle of your swig. But it is interesting, and I would drink another if I had the chance."
"Mouthfeel was thick and enjoyable without being so thick that it had caused a syrup-type of thickness. Making it very easy to drink, but only a couple due to the weight of this stout."
"Black in color with some hints of red. There¬ís hardly any aroma to this beer, and hardly any flavor either. There¬ís some suggestion of black patent and some caramel malts, but those flavors are faint at best. The body is also thin and watery. The only real stout like quality that it has is its color."
"All in all a decent stout. One I would like to try fresh one day."
"The taste is somewhat sweet with roasted, velvety malts. There are some fruity hops and a full-bodied taste. The long aftertaste is creamy with some delicate bitterness, coffee and toffee."
"Pouring from Wychwood's uniquely shaped clear bottle, the beer is opaque, thick black, though a little dark brown near the edges. The head starts large and fine, and seems to shrink very quickly, staying for most of my drink at about 1or 2 cm. Swirling the glass a little improved the creaminess of it. The foam is light brown, almost red in some spots, leaving fast moving screens of lace. A moderate appearance for a stout; nothing extraordinary. I get more brown ale aromas than stout ones, but that is certainly nothing which detracts. The aroma is slightly sweeter than some stouts, more caramel-like, with fresh bread, and a good deal of flowery hops. Creamy mocha, raisins, and mostly a typical stout aroma except the greater sweetness. The aroma is the best aspect of this beer. I get lactose up front on the tongue, good malt in the middle, and sweetish, almost sour bread on the finish. Treacle, more raisins, chocolate cherry, nuts, caramel. I enjoyed the subdued dryness of this stout on the finish; indeed, I am left more with sweet malt than any hop dryness. Mouthfeel: this beer needs much more substance in the mouth; it is far too light feeling for a stout, though it does render the brew easily drinkable. Creamy carbonation; silky, though a little watery. While this is not my favourite stout, I would buy it again: the flavour is there, it just needs to reach its potential through increased body and mouthfeel."
"Pours a deepest crimson/black color with a thin, light tan head. Aromas of black patent malts, a hint of currant-like fruitiness, a hint of clover honey and a lot of earthy undertones. Tastes almost more like a fruity porter than a stout, but it is all about the flavor. The malt is the predominant taste in the beer, and it has a faint astringency throughout the beer. Slightly winey and earthy. A little thin, but definitely not lacking in flavor. Easily drinkable like many beers from the U.K."
"First product from Wychwood I have seen and tasted. Clear 500 ml bottle embossed with Wychwood around bottom and broom riding witch on shoulder. Black liquid that poured to a full tan head with large bubbles, almost had a bit of cascade action happening. It has an aroma of burnt caramel and coffee, strong but not overpowering. Taste is OK, but not really what I was expecting. Very bitter and hoppy, almost harsh when you expect a smoother body. Had a lingering sourish after taste."
"Not bad, bit bland, not particularly strong flavours"
"(500 ml bottle, bought in Denmark). Very dark reddish brown colour, moderate thick tan head. Moderate but pleasant roasted aroma, hints of tar and old woodwork. Flavour is all roasted malts, a bit thin mouthfeel compared to some other stouts, but refreshing. No masterpiece, but nice enough."
"500 mL clear glass bottle, best before date on back label."
"In the mouth, it feels smooth and easy-drinking, with a light carbonation and a richness that doesn't add weight. I really like it."
"Poured from a 500 ml clear bottle, a dark coffee coloured body, with a small creamy beige head that settles to a thin cap and leaves some slight lacing. Dark mahogany highlights when held up to direct sunlight. Smells of light roasted malt, some licorice and coffee, a touch of chocolate, but all very faint and watered down. I tried a new bottle from the one I originally reviewed, and found it far more flavourful and robust than from my first sample. Starts out with dry roasted malts, and quickly picks up a chocolate sweetness in the middle, finishing with a sticky hybrid of sweet malt, chocolate and licorice. Dry espresso and almost a burnt character come out on the aftertaste, a little bit of charcoal. Creamy smooth mouthfeel with decent body, but light enough to make it enjoyably quaffable. I'm rather glad I went back and tried another one of these over a year later, I had picked up a sub-par bottle initially, and had all but written this stuff off. A decent stout, all things considered, even though I still have to get over the stigma of the clear bottle."
"If it were presented as an ale, would've received a few more points. Overall, disappointing as a stout, but nice to drink nonetheless. Would probably have again, just not when I'm in the mood for a nice creamy stout."
"This beer was the odd man out in this tasting. I like stouts...figured this would be a traditional one as it¬ís from the UK...bzzzt wrong! I didn¬ít expect much with arty label and the trendoid embossed clear bottle but it wasn¬ít skunked. Poured a lucid dark brown instead of the expected dead black color of traditional stouts....this looks more like weak porter. The pour (and I hated to defile such trendy packaging actually opening it and drinking the artfully wrapped contents) was anticlimactic...what you saw in the bottle was what you got in the glass...low carbonation, weak nose..some coffee some malt...very weak. Stated watery for a stout...medium-light malt body outbalanced by hops..finish comes too fast with nothing left on the tongue to impress but a bit of astringency. This would be a passable mega porter if it had more malt character. Not bad but not good and the package is overstated for the contents."
"Poured to an almost ashpalt coloured body with a thinning brown head that tried its best to linger. The hop combination seemed to take the life out of the aroma but certainly hues of burnt chocolate and nutmeg are apparent at different stages of consumption. Lack of sweetness and the less then filling feeling (too watery) left me somewhat perturbed as to why this is classified as a stout. The 4.5 ABV should have given me a clue. Not one of Wychwood Brewing's best."
"This stout looks kind of like a porter, its dark dark brown/almost black rather than extremely black. The head is long lasting and leaves concentric sheets of lace behind. The aroma is strong, I opened the bottle, walked across the room, and from there I could smell the black malts and hops. The taste is is hoppier than most UK stouts, with a citrusy character. The malts are complex with quite a subdued burnt taste and a lot of chocolate characteristics. The mouthfeel is not as full as other stouts, rather on the thin side. That being said the excellent balance of this brew and the modest ABV make it very drinkable. Its not that filling."
"Dry."
"I would buy this again when I need a stout that doesn't make me change to another style after one glass."
"The best I've had from Wychwood thus far. Fresh bottle, so their was no light struck aroma. Poured a vicious, tar black colour with a two finger head. The head disippated to film about halfway down the glass. Dark malt and oatmeal is smelled, with a decent hop kick. Tasted a little weaker than it smells. Little bitter hops, little sweet malt, some chocolate, and oatmeal cookies. Good, slick mouthfeel. Kind of a light oil. A decent beer."
"Not a very memorable stout. I've still to taste a Wychwood beer that I really like."
"Bottle - Dark black brew with a nice foamy head with medium retention. Floral aroma coming out of my glass is incredible. Taste is very sweet unlike the irish stout. This is very different and the body is very light. I'm not even sure this is a stout but overall it is not a bad beer."
"I'd like to see the folks the folks in Witney ramp this one up a bit, since it's one of the few English stouts that doesn't emulate the Irish style with addition of roast barley."
"A decent stout. A bit dry perhaps, could be sweeter, but a decent stout, nevertheless."
"500ml bottle. Poured a dark black, with a massive chocolate head that slowly receded to a fine ring, lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is a muted roated coffee. Taste is creamy smooth, and mild for a stout, but a very enjoyable drink. I was concerned about the clear glass bottle, but thankfully it has suffered no ill effects. A thoroughly enjoyable beer."
"Cool label, of course."
"It's black with some ruby highlights, a small brown head tops it off. A good english hoppiness is present in the aroma, along with burnt coffee and some black fruits. Taste is quite odd. Starts off with a very buttery, yet hoppy taste, then roasted malt dominates the aftertaste. If you like english bitters, you'll love this brew. A very unique stout, with a smooth mouthfeel and good stout drinkability."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized dark tan bubbles that left a nice lacing and a dark brown body with some carbonation rising up the side of the glass. It has very nice malty aroma and an initially mild coffee flavor but finishes with a slight bite, but still very nice all around.It was jJust a bit mild for a great stout."
"This was not as strong of a stout that I have experienced in the past. This one was noticeably milder which I know is not the norm for a stout, but personally I prefer a milder tasting stout so I really enjoyed this particular one. It poured a thin head which did not last too long. It had excellent lacing to it. This particular stout is definitely one that I would enjoy drinking again sometime."
"I really liked this one. I generally like stronger stouts but these guys seem to do a great job with a moderate ale. The head is thin but present throughout and leaves a nice lacing. The nose is sweet with caramel notes. But the first taste makes you well aware of the hops. The beer warms you in spite of its low alcohol content and makes it well worth the drink. Maybe a good session beer for those that are interested in that aspect. The malts become present as you move through the pint and are quite a good combination. Definitely a beer I will seek out again."
"Black body with clear mahogany highlights at the base of the glass. Topped by a short, frothy, light tan head that holds fairly well and leaves some nice lace. The nose expresses a roasty malt, mild diacetyl butteriness, and some grassy and earthy hops. The body is light/medium with a very fine and mild carbonation that leaves it smooth in the mouth. The flavor starts with a charming semi-sweet chocolate note and underlying butterscotch that are soon overtaken by roastiness and then drying bitterness. It finishes dry, bitter, and fairly short with only a mild lingering roastiness. A bit one-sided but well-balanced and enjoyable; and at is moderate strength it makes a good session ale! As is the case with many English beers, this is best enjoyed at cellar temperature."
"Like the other Wychwood beers I have tried so far, this is below average. Pours a nice dark color with a slight coffee aroma but the flavor was seriously lacking. Thin and metallic and too fizzy. Maybe this is what a lightstruck Stout tastes like? Damn these clear bottles!"
"Standard dull black pour. Aptly named a ""Black Wych"" Creamy full rich bubbly beige head. Stayed together and fell down the glass nicely. Smell was dominated by burnt malt, bitterness, coffee smells. Taste was a bit more sweet. Some roasted chocolate malt, but again super bitter strong finish. The label says ""Imported English Stout"" I didn't guess it to be an Oatmeal Stout. Too much bitterness for me to think of it as an Oatmeal Stout. Nice dry finish. Medium carbonation. Just gets a bit on the thin watery side, as it nears the bottom of the glass. Still very good, tasty stout, but not as sweet and full bodied as other Oatmeal Stouts I have had."
"The Black Wych pours, not surprisingly, a black color with a somewhat sturdy tan head. Aroma is quite funky at first (damn clear bottles), but after letting it air out, notes of oats and roasted malts are present. Taste is pretty good with hints of more roasted, burnt malt, coffee and oats. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but overall a quaffable oatmeal stout."
"Nice opaque dark brown body with a thick light brown head.  No CO2 apparent in the body - but perhaps it's just too dark to tell.  Head retention is a bit weak, but a thin lace still covers the beer to the end.  Lots of lace left on the glass.  Weak aroma of coffee dominates the smell.  Oats are noticeable as well.  Excellent taste!  Rich coffee taste with roasted oats and a lingering bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but certainly not bad.  Overall a very tasty and enjoyable brew."
"Applesauce, a shot of wheatgrass and coffee. Breakfast for uppity junkies? Or a description of Black Wych? You decide. Ruby edged black nether a thin, tacky head. Nose of newly dug holes and seasonal transitions. Mouthfeel is a bit runny but overall a decent, drinkable brew."
"a non nitro stout, this still pours the ""perfect pint", filling my glass exactly to the top with about 2 fingers of head.  The colour is fairly black, and the head is tan.  The smell is mostly of burnt coffee, the taste is also mostly coffee, the chocolate is less evident.  A little thin and watery, but still nice.  Smooth on the tongue with a little carbonation for effect.  A solid stout, nothing special, but worth trying."
