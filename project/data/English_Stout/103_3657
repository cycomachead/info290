4.28,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I have to admit, perhaps the best ales Middle Ages brews are stouts. Highly recommended and a must try for anyone who enjoys a good, robust stout.","CaptDavyJones","Jul 16, 2011"
4.18,2.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"O - Nice beer and easy to get down. Very creamy and smooth, and lots of taste for the ABV. Good stuff, and great for the style.","AgentZero","Jun 18, 2011"
4.13,1.5,4.5,4,4,5,4,"D - It's a really easy drinking stout of which you could put back a few pints. Pretty much on point for style, with a wonderful texture that makes it go down even easier. Would love to try on cask or nitro.","MasterSki","Jun 06, 2011"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, a tasty brew and easy to drink. I would have this again.","Huhzubendah","Jun 04, 2011"
4.22,3.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Beer is medium to light in body and smooth in the mouth, sweet up front with a mild bitterness at the back with no aftertaste. The whole thing start to finish is pretty sweet but it is an English stout. I like it, I would have it again for sure if I saw it on draft.","drabmuh","Jan 18, 2011"
4.25,4.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours near black with a moderately-thick tan head. Good retention and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward a good amount of dark chocolate along with some roasted malt and coffee. Good combination. Slight smokiness to it as well. The flavor really combines all of these elements quite well. As with all of the beers I had from them, there was a touch of diacetyl, but it fit in well with the style. Way to use that English yeast. The smoke really makes this beer. Medium body with a slightly-smokey and dry finish. Still some body to pick it back up. Really solid.","Thorpe429","Jan 17, 2011"

4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours reddish brown. Very dark but not opaque. Lots of white head. Thinner then i was expecting. Smells roasty and wdonerful. Tastes very roasted with lots of crisp hints of barley coming through the roast. A little thin on the pallette but that is consistent with the style. well carbonated and definitely. Tasty beer","Urbancaver","Apr 17, 2010"

3.81,-6.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Blackheart is a good stout, and it was just what I wanted for a good malt fix when I got it. If dark, charred malts are not your thing, steer clear of this one.","Hojaminbag","Apr 15, 2009"

4.27,4.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from a growler shared by number1bum at a recent gathering/tasting. Appears a deep brown color with about a finger of creamy tan head. Minimal lacing coats the glass. Notes of rich roasted grains, bitter cocoa, and a hint of coffee make up the nose. Tastes of toasted, roasted and caramelized grains, touch of milk chocolate, mocha, bitter cocoa, and the slightest hint of smoke. Tasty stuff. I'd love a growler of this all to myself. A notch below full bodied with medium carbonation - this growler has traveled well.","ClockworkOrange","May 30, 2008"

4.33,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"d: My buddy and I had no trouble getting through this growler, in fact we both wanted more. Big thanks to BeerTruth for the chance to try this via trade. Thanks Adam! I wonder if Middle Ages will ever bottle this?","DIM","Jan 10, 2008"

3.96,-2.7,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Feels thick as hell but also smooth and oily. Leaves a thick coating. Somehow thickens as it warms. It's very balanced even though it's really thick and strong. Sweet enough for ONE repeat. Feels/tastes like it has a lot of alcohol.","williamherbert","Aug 07, 2007"

4.05,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"area. Was it worth it?...YES. The servers were very generous with samples...this was my third choice and it was best by far. Black, almost oily....light tan head...aromas of dark chocolate and burnt coffee....hints of same in flavor...very smooth tasting. I got a growler at the brewery, but couldn't find it in bottles at the couple of stores I stopped in Buffalo. I would recommend this beer highly.It's very similar to Anchor Porter in both taste and mouthfeel. An excellant session beer for a chilly night...filling, tasty, but not too much of an alcohol load.","bobstockwell","Jan 18, 2007"
4.08,0.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"I got this on cask at Mahar's in albany, ny. It poured jet black with a thick long lasting dark mocha head. It has strong chocolate and roasted aromas. The flavors are the same with a strong roasted flavor and chocolate background. The body is medium to full and it has good drinkability.","drseamus","Jan 13, 2007"
4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Had an imperial pint of this on cask at Mahar's in Albany. Pint was pulled with expertise, as they are definately guru's at this bar. This beer sat jet black in the glass with a generous fluffy, dense, light brown head. Aromas of coffee, dark chocolate and sweet malt rose from the pint. Flavors were very reminiscent of the smells. Roasty and bitter up front and soon rounded out with chocolate and sweet malt. This was a substantial beer with a nice medium to medium-full body. Higher than average alcohol, but many flavors mingled together to form an amazing concoction. A nice drinking beer for the cold weather season, and excellent on cask!","kkosmoski","Dec 05, 2006"
4.43,8.8,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured a jet black, with a huge cream colored head, that took a long while to settle down. Lace made the glass opaque, this was definatly fresh! Smell was of rosted malts with a hint of coffee. The taste was great. Roasted coffee and malts, very nice, slight hop is the back, and the taste lingered, deep dark chocolate with, a bit of caramel, very nicely done. The mouthfeel was almost perfect for a stout. Thick, nicely carbonated, smooth delivery and just great. I could really drink this all the time, too bad its 2000 miles away! Great great brew!","mikesgroove","Oct 28, 2006"
4.07,0,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I've been disappointed in the past with Stouts on Cask but this is a winner.","yinzer","Jun 24, 2006"
3.98,-2.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pitch black with a short tan head. Aroma left a little be desired on cask. Generally on tap there are a great, rich dark roasted coffee smell. I'll have to review again next time I have a growler. Anyways, taste was dry and a bit bitter with heavy black grains and a hint of mocha. While I've had trouble finishing a growler of this before. My imperial pint of the cask disappeared on no time. Give it a try.","tempest","May 01, 2006"
4.23,3.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at the Pizza Plant on Main,poured from the tap an opaque black no light showing thru at all with a creamy mocha colored one finger head.Aromas of milk chocolate mixed with dark roast coffee and a lingering earthiness,a great combination of flavors going on starts out with some bitter chocolate notes intertwined with a big dark roast coffee presence melding into a really dry earthy finish.A very nice stout has alot of flavors from beginning to end,highly recommended.","oberon","Mar 23, 2006"
3.05,-25.1,4,1.5,3.5,4.5,3,"Maybe it was an oxidized/old cask. Maybe it's just not meant to be. I'm not sure, I'd like to re-review this on draft or in a bottle.","greggdogg","Mar 02, 2006"
4.47,9.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This one marks another winner from Middle Ages. Well conceived and balanced, easy to drink and highly enjoyable.","Sycodrummer","Sep 24, 2005"
4.8,17.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"1/2 gallon growler from Pizza Plant Walker Center. Pours cold-brewed-toddy black with a thick, dense, and fluffy cloud of espresso-crema-khaki-mocha foam. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, soft black earth, caramel, and a trace of spicy English hops. Hops are much more up front in the taste: spicy, indeed, but earthy, too. Caramel and chocoloate carry through the middle. Dark roasted coffee buzz at the finish. Earthy composted pine needle aftertaste -- somewhat metallic, as well. There is a bit of a sourish black patent malt flavor as well, much like if Anchor Porter was more "English" in flavor and really went whole-hog into stout territory. Velvety mouthfeel, medium-to-full-bodied, dry and just a tad sharp at the finish. This is what a session stout looks, smells, tastes, and drinks like. I don't think this one is bottled, but it ought to be, just so more folks can recognize how great it really is. Splendid offering from MA -- definitely one of their best.","orfeu","May 26, 2005"
4.08,0.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Very pretty pour. Midnight black with a thick chocolate brown head. I was saddened to watch the bartender spoon it off, but cheered when he filled the recently emptied space with more beer. Nose was mildly of coffee and some sort of wine aroma that I have had before (I want to say it was a deep burgundy red wine) but my wine knowledge is slim so I dare not hazard a guess. Flavor was very bold and jumped out on the tongue. Some coffe and dark chocolates. The burnt malts really came out well and were heavy on the tongue. The malts provided a bit of a biter bite which was compounded nicely by the hops. The hops came out more from the back of the tongue and made me think of Christmas Eve. Medium body with a slight dry finish. Very drinkable, especially with my BBQ.","MuddyFeet","Nov 17, 2004"
3.95,-2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A previous Middle Ages dark offering had been found a bit wanting, so I was a touch leery, but there was no need to be. The aroma gave fleeting evidence of what was to come, and it didn't disappoint. It has a dark, earthy stout flavor without laying waste to the palate with too-acrid bitterness or titanic ABV, just as the style should. The rather sparse mouth-presence was the sole misdeed, keeping the beer's assets from being appreciated longer. That said, what I did experience was enjoyable, and I'd have no reservations about coming back this way again, because it is smooth and quite drinkable.","Foxman","Nov 13, 2004"

4.76,17,5,4,5,5,5,"Cask conditioned stout aged with Jack Daniels oak barrels. Dark opaque black colored beer. Fine bubbled, dark khaki colored head that left a sheet of lace as the beer dissapeared. Aroma of chocolate malt, dark roasted malt, and a barely noticeable whiskey undertone. The mouthfeel was awesome, so soft and smooth, just coated your tongue with flavor. A bit of chocolate malt in the flavor along with a bit of the oak aged vanilla undertone and just a pinch of dry bitterness. I think this beer would have been awesome from a cask without the barrel aging, but it does add a bit to the beers complexity. This beer was just incredible, i should have given it a 10 for drinkability. So much going on in the aroma and flavor, none of which jumped out, but all where solidly intermixing. This beer was just incredible, i should have given it a 10 for drinkability.","HappyHourHero","Jun 28, 2004"
4.73,16.2,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The taste was something else all together. Rich dark chocolate seems to melt at the touch of my tongue. So elegant. I almost feel like I'm below this fantastic beer, but what the truck. I love it, so I'm going to keep drinking it.","CBFanWish","May 03, 2004"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Really smooth. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Sweet malts up front with coffee/chocolate leading to a bitter finish. Excellent stout.","cbl2","Mar 22, 2004"
4.03,-1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Bender factor: Finished this growler last out of 4 others. Save the best for last, right? I figured that it would be a perfect way for me to end the evening. After drinking a Pale, an IPA, and an Imperial IPA, BHS was refreshing.","wailingwench","Mar 11, 2004"
3.93,-3.4,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"The beer pours a deep black color with thick dark brown head that lasts. The aroma is good. It has a rich "black" malt scent with roasted barley helping round out the aroma. It has that trademark Ringwood yeast fruitiness, but it barely shows up. The taste is good. This is a real dark brew with lots of emphasis on the black malts. It goes down smooth, but finishes dry and with a roasted barley flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine stout, but it may be a bit too dark for some.","WesWes","Aug 05, 2003"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This stout smelled like a porter. That is a compliment. In many ways it tasted more like a porter too. Very flavorful, the end taste is dry, as is the beginning. But in the middle, you get sweetness. Finishes great, nice and dry.","TheJudge","May 11, 2002"
