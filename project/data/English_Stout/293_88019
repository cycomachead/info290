This was marketed as a black and tan case, and as a black and tan ingredient, this stout fairs well - with a mild, smokey taste, and a smooth feel. It's not quite as good as a Sam Smith's stout, but very good indeed.","Mike13","Jul 27, 2013"

3.46,10.5,4,3.5,3.5,2.75,3.5,"Overall, I like it. It is definitely watery and not very complex but the style really isn't supposed to be overly complex. I think this would be a great alternative to someone who wants to drink a stout that doesn't taste like Guinness (coming from an area where Guinness is one of the only craft beers offered at the bars). I'm going to have to say it's about a 3.5 out of 5. Would I seek this out, well it matters what the alternatives were at the time really. I wouldn't shun it in the least.","WissBrauSean","Mar 17, 2013"
3.26,4.2,3,3.25,3.25,3,3.5,"Taste is mainly roasted grain. Not very malty, nor does it have any real burnt taste. The body is totally watery in a refreshing sort of way. This is more in the ABV range of an actual English-style beer, so the lack of maltiness is appropriate. Still, it's not totally dry. Still, it's a different sort of Stout. Faint hoppiness and not as bitter as the black Stouts. Think of it as a dark lager and it goes down easier. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Ralph's Supermarket in San Clemente.","mactrail","Mar 17, 2013"

3.35,7,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and slight char. Taste is much the same with cookie dough and slight metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is a bit watery flavor-wise but not too shabby.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 14, 2013"

3.08,-1.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Figured I'd try out the stout by itself before I attempted a ""proper"" black and tan. This stuff pours a bleak black-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts and a bit of light coffee. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a dab of that Guinness-like sourness in the background. Unfortunately, here it comes across kinda like burnt sourdough. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a decent stout, but one that seems to necessitate the black and tan in order to really be enjoyed, as it's verging on blandness.","TMoney2591","0"
