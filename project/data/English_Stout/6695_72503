3.45,2.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O- The flavor scrubbing fizz and the off flavors are the only dimensions to the malt flavor and they are a bit odd. I don’t think the off flavors are related to the oysters but they just don’t compliment any of the malt flavors.","rhoadsrage","May 17, 2013"

Having said that, this is very drinkable, and could make an easy drinking session beer. Just not that tasty, even a little watery.","John_Henry","Jan 14, 2013"

2.69,-20.2,3.5,2,3,3,2.5,"O: This is a very mediocre oyster stout. Both nose and the palate are very unrefined; everything just seems out of whack. This one is quite crude and really needs some work to be drinkable.","mrfrancis","Sep 30, 2011"
3.1,-8,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"From the 500 ml. bottle. Sampled on January 16, 2012. It pours close to black with ruby red hues and a long-lasting tan head. The aroma does little to make me think it is a stout. There are dark grainy malts, some vague fruit, and maybe a slight hop crispness but it is all very subtle. The body is thin. As for the taste, I get little that makes me think of a stout. It is more like a Heineken Dark with an off-dry finish. This goes down quickly though.","puboflyons","Aug 27, 2011"
