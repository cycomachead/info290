"I was initially excited by the raspberry smell opening the bottle, but it ended up being much drier than I anticipated. I expect this is due to the lower original gravity and all the sugar in the constituent ingredients was metabolized by the yeast. Making this a milk stout would probably help."
"Overall: Too bitter. Not a huge fan, wouldn't have another."

"O: Tough to choke down a few ounces of this."
"Blue & Gray continues to impress me. Their Chocolate Raspberry Stout is something different, and quite tasty."
"D: This is not one I'd have every day, but since my wife dug it, that definitely counts for something..."
"d - An ok stout, but nothing special. I thought the taste was a bit watered down. Worth trying but wouldn't seek out again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is slightly below average. Drinkability is pretty decent, it's not a big roasty stout for sure but it's a pretty decent raspberry flavored beer. It's a nice seasonal for valentines day though and fits the season well."
"Very dark brown color, milk chocolate like in appearance with a thin tan head with a surprising amount of lacing. Berries and chocolate malt on the nose. Taste is sadly lacking any of the berry from the nose, instead a strong roasted malt body and cocoa powder-like sweetness resulting in a milk chocolate like syrupy body. Not awful, but not great. Reminds me of the Legend Chocolate Porter I just had, not quite as bad as that, but still a let down."
"The pour reveals a dark, nearly opaque brown with a whispy tan foam for a head. For a stout, it looks a little thin, especially when viewed from above. There's some lacing, but it's thin and transitory. The raspberries come out in the smell, along with a train of dark, chocolatey malts. The taste, though, takes the raspberries mostly out of the equation, leading instead with the malts, which give a choco-dust flavor, a twinge of bitterness, and, near the back, there comes a hint of those very berries from the smell. Though it definitely defies its own appearance by sitting just a tad heavy on the tongue, it's not too heavy to keep the drinkability down. Overall, a decent beer, but nothin' too special."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, with artificial fruit, and bit like a raspberry sherbert."
"Pours a clear dark brown with thin mocha tan head. Very little retention and just a touch of lacing. Smells of raspberries, brownie batter, brown sugar, butter, and lightly roasted malts. Tastes of raspberries and other dark fruits like prunes up front then some brownies, butter, caramel, and a touch of coffee. Medium light in body with low carbonation. Smooth but thin with lots of fruit sweetness that covers up a good amount of the stout characteristics. Nice for something like Valentines Day or to enjoy while eating some chocolate, but a little too sweet and artificial tasting to really want to enjoy frequently. It was a struggle to even finishing off 1 pint."
"Poured a dark black color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of raspberries, chocolate, and I was getting some soapiness and perfume. Tastes of raspberries and chocolate. I wasn't crazy about that aroma as that perfume/soapiness was kinda nasty."
"This isn't bad, but it's pretty one dimensional. If there were more malt flavor, especially chocolate but roasted as well, it would really be pretty special. Not too shabby nonetheless."
"I'm a fan of raspberry mixed with chocolate. This one does a pretty good job, and almost tastes like something you would find in the snack aisle of a grocery store. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Another fresh and solid offering from Blue & Gray. Glad I picked one up, and I'll continue to probably get all the bombers I can find and review them as they're purchased, as I've been impressed so far. Again, you can't beat the local breweries, especially those who consistently are making quality brews."
"drinkability - Not a bad brew, aquired in a trade, would try it again, but I was thinking it was going to offer more then what it did."
"Served a nice opaque black with a diminishing head. The aroma was of some raspberries, but a little weak. The beer was a great balance of everything promised; chocolate and raspberries played very well with the taste of roasted barley. There was a nice dryness to it, the beer was light and smooth. This would make a good session stout on a cold winter night."
"Purchased far too long ago, for less than $6 for a 750ml bottle, directly from the brewery, which is the only way I know how to obtain this stuff."
