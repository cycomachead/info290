review_text
"I don't get any bourbon (unless it's hidden in all the rest of the sweetness); I don't get much oak (perhaps a touch).  This is actually a very tasty beer; an imperial English mild ale, perhaps.  But a bourbon aged stout? I don't get it.  Still, I would definitely reach for it again; it's very tasty!"

"O: So-so. A decent enough beer on it's own terms, but doesn't really fulfill expectations for a bourbon stout. Looks OK, while the aroma and flavour are quite sweet and boozy with hints of brown sugar, dried fruit, stewed leaves and woodiness. Lacklustre body - too thin. The malt character isn't beefy enough to match the aging and doesn't provide sufficient balance. The result is slightly cloying; a sort of 'light' bourbon stout. Drinkable but not memorable - no need to hunt this one down."
"Very solid and accessible.  I will definitely grab more in the future."
"Innis & Gunn Bourbon Aged Stout’s flavor immediately leans sweet, channeling dates, caramel, toffee, and touches of chocolate.  There are boozy touches of cooked fruit and alcohol soaked oak barrels.  The mouthfeel ends up being thick between the sugary nature and the high booze.  The elements of bourbon tend to take over toward the end, giving off burnt chocolate, caramelized sugars, and the flavor of preserved fruit.  The finish goes on for some time moving closer to bourbon as it goes."

"A different stout that's semi transparent and easier to drink than others."

"Serving type: bottle"

"Nicely Package and that's about where it ends. Draws no comparisons to other BA stouts offered. Really disappointed"

"I found this to be a really well done bourbon oak-aged stout.  Glad I had the chance to try this one."

"The beer that introduced me to Innes & Gunn.  Black appearance but actually deep mahoghany with red hues when backlit with a lasting but frothy tan head, leaves some lacing on glass. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, and charred oak.  Tastes of malt and chocolate with lingering bourbon flavor.  Mouth feel has slight carbonation bite but not heavily carbonated., not as smooth as many stouts."

"O - overall an interesting beer. It is certainly a reprieve from most stouts, on the sweeter side but not offensively cloying. The smokey character makes it stands out and is really enjoyable. I'd drink it again but not more then one in a sitting."
""
""
"The aftertaste end as beer began.. Smooth with a presence of bourbon, just enough to let you know it was there."
"Had an overly sweet caramel taste, and got a faint metallic smell when i poured it, like the smell of an oily coin. The beer itself tasted ok. However, the weird smell, and sweetness makes this a not so good beer."

"This is my favorite of the Innis & Gunn beers I've had, and would happily drink again."
""
""
"O-decent beer a bit too sweet as the molasses seems to dominate the finish .  almost on the verge of drinking flat soda( or a watered down Jack and coke that sat out for a while and went flat.  Certainly couldn't drink many of these due to the overly sweet flavors (3.25)"

"Bottom Line: Would I buy it again...nah."

"In the end I enjoyed it. A 7.4 ABV is respectable as was the moderate price. Now let's see how long it's available."
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought this was a nice example of Bourbon Red Stout, I don't think I've ever had a red stout before, so I can't be too sure about this, but as far as I can tell it lived up to it's description and it felt like it was somewhere between a amber ale and stout.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, slightly cloying, a little sticky, not too filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, one full bottle might be just a little too much for because of the sweetness.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, it was a good looking beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the drinkability, I just think the sweetness would really start to wear on me after awhile.  I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was nice to try, but I don't really have the urge to revisit it anytime soon.  I would recommend it if you like malty English ales and bourbon aspects in your beer, but I wouldn't recommend it as a good beer.  This isn't my  favorite beer from this brewery it falls about right in the middle and the same goes for the style.  All in all I didn't mind this beer and it had some good aspect to it, but it also had some aspects that I hurt and I feel like I could go either way with this beer.  I appreciate the effort it took take make this beer and I hope to see more unique beers from this brewery in the future, keep up the solid work."

"Hardly a stout, this is like a way too sweet and syrupy take on Innis and Gunn Rum Cask. Avoid."

"This Beer Is Way Undervalued!!!"
"1 pint, 4.3 ounce bottle.  Bottom of the box the beer came in says best before June 2015.  Not sure if this is any different than their regular bourbon stout, but the box says this is a ""Limited Edition"" beer that comes from a select batch of only 220 barrels.  Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear dark ruby red/brown color with about an inch and a half tan head.  Head retention is good, and there's also a decent amount of lacing.  The aroma is mostly sweet, it smells like roasted malt, nuts, caramel, and some dried/candied fruit.  It tastes like roasted malt, nuts, dark fruit, cola, and also has an herbal/mineral flavor to it.  I don't really pick up much of if any bourbon at all.  I know it's weird to say, but it tastes like an Innis & Gunn beer.  There's just something about the beers I've tried from them that have a similar taste, but whatever it is, I like it.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with a good amount of carbonation.  It's also smooth and easy to drink.  I liked this brew, but maybe they should have aged this over the bourbon oak chips longer.  $7.99 a bottle."
""

"O: A nice and different take on a bourbon aged stout. The oak chips are a little different from barrel aging, but still impart a nice bourbon, oak, and vanilla kick. I've enjoyed the very few ""red"" stouts that I've had, and this is no exception"
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium-full, as most of its kind tend to be, with plenty of depth and a good, smooth flow to it balanced by just a light crisp bite.  It's got a little bit of dryness easing in to keep it from being cloying, and it finishes with the full complexity of the flavor."

"taste is very sweet and not in a pleasaNt waY. taste (like mentioned abOve) bad caramel or a disgusting sweet candy. subtle hints Of Oak (but not BrbN). light To Low-medium feel. lingering smokiness that doesn't play well with the carbonation."
""
""
"Overall: This has the making of being Outstanding, IMO. Yet the water and the malt body leaves me wanting more out of it. Also could ask for more Oak but now I'm just being picky. There is qualities I like about this brew, then there isn't. This brew has more of a Noble feel. Where every thing is classy and refined. Not ""Extreme"" like the American takes on styling. Yet I dig this brew, gave it's fair shake, I will finish my bottle. This brew is worthy."
""
"O: very interesting ale - a ""red stout"" whose malts are lighter and toastier; bourbon aging effects a honeyed vanilla character of sweetness. Not like any stouts I can recall - one of a kind and absolutely worth the 8 or 9 bucks it might go for. Recommended."
"Overall: A tasty beer I think will play very well with I&Gs customer base.  I don't think this beer scores well as a stout, and the bourbon character is pretty muddled.  Bourbon chip irish red? Sure I'll take that. Call this a bourbon stout seems to me more trying to ride the wave of BA stouts. (3.65)"
"Appearance is a dark reddish black with a tan head that sticks to the glass. The smell was full of bourbon, wood, but also sweet with a vanilla hint.  The taste I thought was very good. Starts off slightly bitter with almost a coffee flavor, and then you get dark chocolate and bourbon in the middle and a slightly boozy finish. Mouthfeel was a little thin but still good."
"2.75/5: Enjoy a shitload of diacetyl? Here's your beer!"
""

"Overall, good but not great. I would rather have their standard brew than this."
"overall, if this beer was the only beer on tap while I was out with friends, I simply wouldn't drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Don't expect a typical bourbon aged stout.. this tastes like the rest of the innis lineup basically. It's a decent brew, and another beer that is good to introduce others to craft."
""
""
"Very unimpressive. As were the other two beers in the gift box."
""
"o: I&G seem to have a slightly differenct view of stouts and porters than other makers, perhaps being Scottish theirs tend to be more Scottish alelike. This is no exception. There is no roasty malt/coffee/chocolate/smoke flavor to speak of, but lots of bourbon, rather reminiscent of Alltech's Kentucky Ale. I like it, and the color is dark enough to be a porter or stout, but those looking for more heft and complexity might be disappointed."
"Horrid brew. This one went strait down the drain. This has to be near the bottom for style. I'm going to go scrub my mouth out. What a joke of a bad brew."
"Body feels watery."
""

""

"Fairly average and run-of-the-mill beer to me if I'm honest, it seemed rather plain and unadventurous other than the bourbon coming through and that wasn't an aspect of the beer I particularly enjoyed either."

"330 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/22/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark bread, roasted malt, caramel, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, oak, clove, light vanilla, herbal, and toast/oak earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and oak barrel notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, dark bread, roasted malt, caramel, toast, brown sugar, toffee, light coffee, raisin, plum, vanilla, clove, oak, herbal, and toast/oak earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark bread, chocolate, cocoa, roast, caramel, toast, brown sugar, toffee, raisin, plum, vanilla, oak, clove, herbal, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and moderate yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good English stout style. Good robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O: if you can find the gift pack it is worth the purchase to try a few different things. pretty enjoyable overall as long as you like the lighter side of wood aging. will be drinking again"

"I really like this beer very nice drinkable stout . Crisp and clean tons of flavor l'm not a real fancy sophisticated reviewer , I highly recommend trying this beer. Has nice fruit very smooth words words words ! Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla 250 characters"
"O: A very nice bourbon stout that is a bit sweet but very tasty."
""

"This beer pours a deep ruby and has a one finger head that surprsingly sticks around for quite a while before breaking to a thin film leaving no lacing in its wake. The smell is Bourbon malts and vanilla. Taste has Bourbon, treacle, malts, and vanilla. The mouth feel is smooth with a lower than expected carbonation. Overall better than expected. I quite liked this and would revisit it and recommend it to others."

"Same evolving flavors of dark malts, chocolate, earth, and bourbon play toss and catch with each other. It ended with a slightly lingering chocolate note. I found it to be delightful."
""
"M&O: smooth on the palate, the body comes rather moderate or on the verge of being light at times, but given the moderate flavour profile that doesn’t go heavy on malts plus alc. well hidden, the overall balance is pretty respectful. Being a “Red Stout” oak-aged in Bourbon casks, I find this beer very enjoyable and would certainly recommend it amongst most other Innis&Gunn’s products I’ve tasted."
""
""
"O- A very enjoyable beer."
""
""
"With a lovely fullish, viscous yet vanishing texture, the beer overall caught me off-guard with just how moreish and enjoyable it was. In hindsight, I can say I am relieved that this wasn't a bourbon-bomb - not even close. This is yet another satisfying, uniquely distinctive ale from Innis & Gunn and, after sampling this entire set, I am sold on trying more of their products. Their beers have a refined, characteristic British taste to them - which is right up my alley."

"O- Everything about this beer is mediocre, except the taste, which is what truly matters. You need to put aside your american stout expectations when tackling this one, as it's much more of a stout/scotch ale hybrid. When it comes down to it, it's downright delicious."
""
""

" I'm amazed at how long the mouth feel stays solid with a malt-heavy and aged stout, making this easy to drink for the duration of the session."
"Another new one for me and pours a very dark cherry cola hue with a creamy two finger head and some nice lacing,the smell is sweet bourbon,oak and glazed fruit,the mouthfeel is just medium bodied and moderately carbonated with tastes of predominantly bourbon and coke,the slightest edge of oak,biscuity malts and is finished with a very light hop bitterness and overall it's and drinkable where the bourbon oak is dominant but easily mingles with the base beer and yeah I'd drink it again cheers."

"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly and leaves no lace. Deep opaque amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Bourbon nose and flavor is bourbon and vanilla, hints of caramel. 330ml clear bottle part of 4-pak (glass is included that just holds 330ml) $5.99 from Market Basket Concord, NH."
"Pours a dark brown with garnet highlights at the edges and a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of caramel and brown sugar with some dark dried fruit and a bit of oak tannin, light vanilla, and a hint of alcohol. This says its a stout, where is the roast, coffee, and or chocolate? The flavor is quite sweet with dark sugary malt, toffee, dark fruit, light oak and vanilla sweetness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Stout huh? not by a long shot! Still an overly sweet Scottish ale that maybe they but a hint more color into. Again there is nothing flawed about the beer other than its boring and not to style."

"Like the rest of I & G's offerings, this has 'gateway' beer written all over it. While there is a lot of flavour, everything comes back to that malt sweetness, which I am long past being an apologist for. I thought that the use of American oak (in whatever respect) would lend this the air of an American stout. Nope, still English, the hops surprisingly taking care of that. A bit more complex than I was expecting, but that's about it."
