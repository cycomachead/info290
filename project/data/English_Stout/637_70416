""Belgian stout"" should perhaps be a separate style designation, at least for splitters such as myself. Maybe this could use a few rougher edges to add complexity and character? In any event, might be worth a second look if you hated it on the first pass.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 10, 2015"

Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense and fluffy tan head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, pear, apple, clove, pepper, herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, pear, apple, clove, pepper, herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness. Slight amount of earthy roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, pear, apple, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Belgian stout. Good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A unique and pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 30, 2014"

Once the beer sat for a little while, it began to give off some chocolately flavors too. Very light bodied and light in the mouth feel, this is something different. It did not quite taste like a Belgian or a Stout. Not sure if I would order this again other than to try and better understand or appreciate it.","Neorebel","Aug 17, 2013"

I could drink most of my favourite stouts all night, and there are few Belgian-style ales I would ever turn down a second helping of - but this fusion of the two leaves me feeling underwhelmed, and one glass will be more than enough for me.

The brew tastes like roasted and burnt/charred malt, coffee, bitter herbs, and a bit of tart dark fruit. I liked the taste of this the longer I drank it.

Really bad, even more disappointing considering it comes from a brewery that we all know can do so much better than this.

Quite smooth and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, note of coffee in the aftertaste. Nice coffee notes and sweetness of caramel and toffee, pleasant and nice to drink.","OWSLEY069","Jul 10, 2012"

It has far more of that roast character than you ever see in a Belgian ale, but in most other respects it really falls into that style.

3.21,-3,2.5,4,3,3,3,"Pours nearly black without any real head formation or lace. A good swirl brings a few mocha bubbles, but that's about it. The nose brings some nice roasted chocolate character with some slight Belgian-yeast aromatics. The flavor falls back with heavy roast; the chocolate and yeast are merely background noise. Medium body with a semi-dry finish that is a bit acrid. Decent.","Thorpe429","Feb 09, 2012"
3.73,12.7,3.5,3,4,4,4,"25oz bottle, corked and caged. Opens with a vigorous pop. Pours a clear, dark brown with a light head consisting of lots of really tiny bubbles. Aroma is strange, mineral, tart, sour, metallic. In the taste, much different than the nose, with a good dose of lush chocolate, malted milk, roast and coffee grounds. Well balanced, though there is little hop flavor, just mild leafy notes. More cocoa, coffee and toast. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, smooth and creamy, finishing slightly dry. Overall, I was quite surprised with this one, a really nice find. A Belgian stout with some character.","Stinkypuss","Feb 05, 2012"

My respect for the brewery keeps me from giving this unfortunate accident an absolutely stinging review, but it really is pretty awful. It's like someone who had never tasted a stout, but had perhaps seen a few Guinness advertisements, decided to brew a stout. With the exception of color, this beer has nothing in common with real stouts. What was the brewing team at Dupont thinking?","mrfrancis","Nov 30, 2011"
3.18,-3.9,4,3.5,3,3,3,"With DuPont's reputation as a saison brewer, it's interesting to see something this dark come out from their way. It pours a deep black-brown, translucent at the edges evincing a mild bit o' dark garnet, topped by about two fingers of dusty khaki foam. The nose comprises roasted malts (very husk-y, I might add), light chocolate powder, and toasted wheat. The taste goes further down the roasty road, with heavy roasted malts, darkly-toasted wheat, and what seems like lightly acridly bitter coffee. Things are a bit harsh here. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and one of the driest finishes I've ever seen in a stout. The dryness doesn't help the bitterness any... Overall, I can't say I'm a fan of this beer. It's too burnt, too roasty, for its own good.","TMoney2591","Nov 28, 2011"

A dense like cream colored inch of foam up top with good retention, yet no stick. Smell is english yeast up to the max. Interesting to see a Belgian brewery take on this style. More smells- peat, smoke, chocolate, vanilla and cream. Taste is pretty much stated above in the taste portion. The english ingredients take hold alot. Cocco, vanilla, cream and peat influence. Feel is light bodied with tight carb that's not bitey, yet there is a sourness towards the end which kills it. I like this low alcohol and light bodied stout, but it tastes a bit disjointed and the aftertaste is horrid.","BARFLYB","Nov 15, 2011"

The festival billed as the debut of the beer; perhaps it had more than one. And what was presented might have been more of a preview, as I gathered from later speaking with someone at Dupont, possibly it was not the final recipe for the commercial run. When I find it again in good tasting environment, I'll re-review. For what it's worth, here goes:) Poured from the keg perfectly black with just a ring of ivory foam. Aroma of coffee, pepper, some herbal spice like coriander, a toasty or caramelized bread note. Surprisingly little malt sweetness, rather burnt-tasting, rather un-Belgian but very welcome. Some coriander or grain of paradise in there, too, and hops sneaks in at the end. Slight astringency, definitely less chewy than the standard Belgian take on stout -- again, not necessarily a bad thing, and all the more quaffable for it.","ManforallSaisons","Aug 27, 2011"
