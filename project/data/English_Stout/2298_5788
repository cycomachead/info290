Pours a rich black with a lacing one finger head into my Tusker pilsner glass. Head diss spayed quickly leaving me a nice coke float with hints of chocolate and coffee subjected by the malty dark cookoff. Body of this stout is medium not too filling.

Smell was incredibly smooth, with silky milk chocolate, some roasted husk, and a bit of mild fruit in the background. Taste was also quite nice, with much of the same chocolate smoothness, and a bit of coffee surfacing as well. Mouthfeel was like I said, really smooth, making it all the more drinkable. I will have to pick up more English Stouts in the future, as this is a fantastic beer. Went perfect with lunch today. Cheers","jamie2dope","Dec 05, 2006"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"It pours a clear, almost black body with deep mahogany highlights beneath a short head of creamy tan foam. Some yeast sediment settles to the bottom of the glass, and occassional, very-fine bubbles can be seen rising steadily towards the surface. The combination of it's fine, bottle-conditioned moderate carbonation and medium-light body leave it silky-smooth across the palate. The nose expresses a dark, slightly acrid bittersweet chocolate maltiness, and some yeasty fruitiness that encompasses both dark and light skinned fruits (plum, red berries). The flavor follows pretty much exactly, with its dark maltiness expressing a bit of roastiness, and some caramel, and reigning over the gentle fruitiness. A subtle touch of grassy and leafy hops lend it some depth. The bitterness is restrained, but solid, allowing the malt some room to play, but anchoring it completely in the dry, roasty, and slightly acrid finish. It's quite drinkable in that it's lighter in body and maltiness, and doesn't overwhelm the palate. And, it still has enough flavor and depth to keep it interesting for more than or two. It's not a pint that I'd go for if I was having only one, but for a night out with the lads I'd more than care for a few of these!","NeroFiddled","Nov 01, 2006"

3.28,-12.1,4,3.5,3,4,3,"Poured a very dark brown with brilliant ruby highlights and a fluffy, light brown head. Chunky lacing stuck to the glass as the head fell. Lots of roast in the aroma, not really coffee though -- sweet malt, chocolate, and caramel rounded it out a bit. Malty and roasted flavour, low bitterness, with a metallic aftertaste. There's also a bit of sourness too. Full bodied, moderate carbonation, it really coated the palate. If it wasn't for the metallic character (which really became distracting), I would have enjoyed this a lot more. As it is, it's still passable.","DrJay","Sep 12, 2006"

Nothing too exceptional but not bad by any means.","Jdiddy","Jul 02, 2006"
3.3,-11.5,4,4,3,3,3,"Pours very dark brown with a substantial tan head. Smell is of deep roast and mild fruity esters. Initial entry onto the palate is sweet, with substantial toffee and chocolate notes coupled with some light fruit(cherry) esters. Slight chocolate feel to it. Earthy hops emerge amidst this and dry through the finish along with the bitterness of the roasted malt. Unfortunately I found this a bit too acrid and biting (roasted barley), burnt bitter char through the finish and while otherwise decent, a major annoyance. Makes the beer come across as disjointed, a large gap in the malt profile. Body was medium light with medium, yet assertive carbonation, creating a slightly aggressvie mouthfeel, which when coupled with acridity is not so good. Drinkability is hurt due to what i perceive as being too much black roast.","numenor1","Beers"

4.03,8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Almost pitch black. Hold it right over a light and some dark reddish colors peek through. Good tan head, plenty of tracings. There is a strong roasted aroma on the nose, which sticks around on the palate, along with definite chocolate flavors as well as a crisp but mostly mild hop bitterness. There is a somewhat unsettling metallic taste that migrates around the palate from the fore- to the aftertaste, then seems to fade away. At this point the aftertaste becomes predominently roast malt-centric. For a stout this is a pretty easy drinker, not palate-coating, and quite enjoyable.","VoodooBrew","Jan 16, 2006"

Smell is malty and stout-like. Taste is very good, malty with subtle hops on the aftertaste. What really surprised me about this beer, however, is it's drinkability. It really reminds me of an English Brown in that it goes down so smooth! It could easily be a session beer, and I think that is somewhat unusual for a stout.

It has a smooth dark malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and slightly bitter. It is not too thick and has a fine malt palate. The hops add a nice zing and balance to an already good taste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine English stout.

Amazing scents of darkly rich hops, espresso, and chocolate. Maybe a it of oaky whiskeyness, and even a bit of terriyaki came out towards the end. Very good mouthfeel, just flows over your tongue. The carbination is just barely there, so that is nice for me. Taste is nice, not too intense. Expected it to be very powerful, but is so nicely drinkable.

Too heavy to be a session beer, if you are having 2 or 3, this will work well.

The smell is dominated by pleasant, roasted grains with complementary notes of chocolate and especially coffee--neither of which is overwhelming. Those scents dissipate rather quickly, leaving a lighter (and somewhat sour) scent. The first observation upon tasting this stout is that it has a watery mouthfeel and a correspondingly diluted taste. Crisp at the start, then some roasted notes show up before giving way to a vaguely metallic flavor. The finish is the most pleasant aspect of the taste, ending with a creamy and then bitter taste. Goes down smoothly, but neither interesting nor tasty enough to merit another bottle.","BitteBier","Feb 16, 2004"

3.92,5.1,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Nice bottle-conditioned mouthfeel, and low carbonation make it very easy to drink. Would make a great session stout.","Realale","Dec 19, 2003"
3.73,0,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Though the Hopback line hasn't been available for a while, I rather liked their previous offerings and held high hopes for this one. Pours a very dark red/amber in color -nearly black- with a dark tan head of good duration and thick, clingy lacing. Aromas are of rich, roasted and caramelized malts, and a hint of bittering hops. Smooth and silky mouthfeel, and the aromas were a good indication of the bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee flavors herein. I served this at room temperature in a tall half-liter glass and it left me with the impression that it was a more full-bodied brew than it actually is. Very tasty and inviting, something to warm you on a cold winterÂs night. And while the legend on the bottle notes that it qualifies as a VEGAN product, IÂm an omnivore, and IÂm sitting here with an empty fridge with this stout making me hunger for steak and kidney pie . . .","Chaz","Dec 14, 2003"
3.81,2.1,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"An above average stout, especially in drinkability, solid and sure, and just the thing for all you vegan stout-o-philes out there.","feloniousmonk","Nov 18, 2003"
3.58,-4,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Dark brown, almost opaque, a little light comes through at the bottom. Nice yellowish head, laces in complicated thin sheets. Aroma is mild, light coffee with cream. Java really dominates the flavor, oily and bitter roastiness attack the tastebuds up front. More than medium carbonation adds some interest but the mouthfeel could be a little creamier. Finish has maybe a bit of smoke. Not a bad beer, bottle conditioned, lacks isinglass for organic folk, but a little light, spritzy, and maybe monotone for a Stout overall, though its resembles an Irish style most closely.","ADR","Nov 18, 2003"
3.71,-0.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Generally the beer was quite drinkable, but it left me dissatisfied.","gueuzeonhigh","Nov 09, 2003"
3.8,1.9,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a black color with a touch of crimson around the edges. Soapy brown head. Not very energetic in the carbonation department. Luscious aromas of scorched butterscotch and chocolate and black patent malts. Caramelly malty flavor finishing thin and enjoyable to the tongue. Lingering malt sweetness. Very drinkable. Some sediment left in the bottle.","crookedhalo","Oct 26, 2003"
2.92,-21.7,3,3.5,2.5,4,2.5,"Bottle conditioned stout that pours with tan head that lasts. Black translucent color with reddish hues when held to light. The aroma is of roasted grains and slight chocolate. Metallic flavor in the first sips. Then roasted in the middle with a dry finish that is slightly sour. The metallic flavor is harsh and really detracts from the taste. The body is good, but the drinkability due to the off flavor is not so high.","GCBrewingCo","Sep 07, 2003"
3.76,0.8,4,3,4,4,4,"A very fine stout that is quite smooth and easy to drink. The black body is held down by a half inch of tan foam; light lacing from the residual layer. The nose is very light but gives a sense of smokiness. The flavor is lightly chocolate with small hints of coffee. A smooth feel that may be a bit too thin for my taste. Quite drinkable due to the smoothness and light ABV.","AtLagerHeads","Jul 11, 2003"
3.73,0,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pretty nice little stout. Smoky nose and flavour, with a little roast and then some chocolate, quite subtle, with a crisp, slight fizzy mouthfeel, with perhaps a touch of acidity. The palate is a touch short, but theres some nice flavours in this, quite bitter-roasty aswell. Dry, lightly chalky finish.","rastaman","Beers"
