review_text
"Love Stout doesn't really live up to its luscious description, but that doesn't mean it's a bad beer [I noticed on the website that draft versions of this beer are on nitro, and I can see this beer taking on a richer quality there]. As it is, this is a pretty flavorful, very drinkable stout, and I personally don't care for hoppy stouts, I'll keep this one on my radar."

"Overall: This was worse than i imagined. It reminds me of Guinness Extra, which is far from a compliment. Everything about it screams weak, musty, and watery. A six pack runs $10 around me. A bomber is the same price. Thats a freakin joke! Im surprised by some of the high ratings. Glad i only got a single. Everything iv had from this brewery is average at best. Pass this one up in all seriousness."
"Wow not a stout guy but like."

"I've had other chocolate and coffee stouts and they always taste horrible - this one is the best. Smells like nothing but coffee slight chocolate."
""
""
""
""
"It was slightly bitter with a hint of coffee flavor. My only complaint is the bar I was in served it slightly warm (which isn't the beers fault)."
""
""
""
"The love stout had a very nice pour black to the color and and a tan head to it.  The aroma was of coffee and sweet chocolate.  I liked the flavor too, it was a bit smoky and roasted coffee and a sweet chocolate creamy finish.  I find this to be a very decent stout and I would definitely recommend trying it."
""
""
"Overall I should have picked up a sixer of this over hop juju it's a very sessionable smooth semi sweet stout."
""
"Had this at the Fireside Tavern in Strasburg. It was one of two Porters on tap. Very good beer!"
""
""
"Rocked this from bottle to pint glass. Darker 'un sin. Limited lacing. Light tingle on first sip. Flavor rounds out with solid toasty finish. Stout ""notes"" (you beer hippies) of coffee, tobacco, and chocolate in the finish and aftertaste. Not high-test or heavy so right up my alley. Sessionable in winter when baseball season seems an eternity away and you figure just settle in with a dark beer and hibernate."
""
""
""
"Don't know if it was a bad batch but it had a very skunky taste to it"
""
""
""
"Overall this is an interesting stout in that it does not bowl you over with roasted malts and burnt coffee but it does deliver complex malt flavor. If you want a sweet, creamy stout then try this one."

"I’ve enjoyed this stout and would be happy to have another.  In the world of big beers and Imperial stouts its easy to forget the simple pleasures of a lower above, lower intensity stout with gentle but comfortably full flavors.  If what you are looking for to drink are the big flavors and intensities of imperial stouts this beer is not for you.  But if you want to relax and enjoy a low abv but fairly full-flavored stout this is a good place to start."
"On tap, Morris Tap and Grill - Yards love stout. Pitch black. High foam. Off white. Roasted chocolate coffee nose. Smooth creamy milky taste. No carb to speak of. Lighter sweet stout flavor. 4 375 385 35 375"

"Fantastic stout. Very consistent brew."

"Yards fails to live up to expectations again."
"3.63/5: 'Love' is a bit strong; still a moderately impressive stout"

"This was a solid stout but nothing special"
"A solid stout from a solid brewery."
"This beer reminds me of the snow laden streets of philadelphia.  Had some good times around it. Pretty standard stout, mid to heavy body, mid thickness in mouth feel, chocolaty notes with roasted malts. Middle of the road, but still pretty tasty"

"I strongly recommend this beer to any avid coffee drinkers."

"Great job with this beer. Perfect taste for me for a stout.  Went down very smoothly. This could easily be my goto stout.  Chocolate taste was nice maybe just a tad too much but beats the normal coffee flavor which isn't my thing.  Will be buying this to keep on hand."

"Pours a dark brownish black with a creamy tab head and lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee and vanilla. A bit of caramel. In the taste, coffee, roasted malt and an earthy hop presence. Though well balanced, this is a fairly bitter beer. Drinks smooth and easily. Overall, a quality stout that works well in a nitro format."

"This stout has really evolved with yards. Tonight it's a great dry Irish stout with a bit more. Touch sour finish and fluffy dry like guiness. Lingering dark head great on nitro I bet. I just hat e how beer advocate makes y XML out the records to a minimum of 250 words sometimes I just don't hac e mush to say drinking and all shiiite man"

"A rich black bodied beer with a small brown head that dissipates almost immediately; lacing is spotty. Aroma is fairly standard; roast, a little chocolate, plus a faint mineral note I’d attribute to the oyster/shell inclusion. Taste is the same; simple, straightforward, uncomplicated. Nice dark malt, gentle roast and bit of hoppy bitterness; bittersweet chocolate, again the mineral note. Smooth mouthfeel, medium-light body, moderately carbonated. One of the better tap offerings from Yards, in my opinion. Easy to drink and sessionable."

"O - As competition for Guinness and local breweries' renditions of that classic this beer does well to be smoother and stronger. However a little roast and maybe some Special B would really knock this beer up to a whole new level!"

"black, with a huge cream colored head, that took a long while to settle down. Lace made the glass opaque, this was definatly fresh! Smell was of rosted malts with a hint of coffee. The taste was great. Roasted coffee and malts, very nice, slight hop is the back, and the taste lingered, deep dark chocolate with, a bit of caramel, very nicely done. The mouthfeel was almost perfect for a stout. Thick, nicely carbonated, smooth delivery"
"This was okay, it wasn't anything special but went down extremely easy and I enjoyed it. I'm not too sure if it's anything I'd really ever order again though. Not bad, not great, pretty standard. Thanks for the pint, Yards."
"It's an okay tasting stout -- reminds me of a better tasting Guinness. Highlight is the feel, that's about it, with the taste being okay. I have had oyster stouts before, this certainly didn't come off as one."
"This poured out as a decent looking dark brownish black brew. Not very thick looking at all, kind of watery to say the least. The smell of the beer had some nice roasted and chocolaty aromas to it. The taste of the beer was a sweet, and a little bitter in the finish. The mouthfeel was mostly flat from the cask, a little watered down also. Overall I'd rather have this on regular draft or from a bottle I think."
"There was no written indication that this was on nitro-tap, but judging by the appearance, I believe it was. Poured an opaque black, with the milkiest, creamiest head I've ever seen on a beer: foamy white with tan shadowing, and it retained to the last drop, and laced nicely. Nice roasty aroma, with notes of coffee. Roasted malts and coffee in the taste, milk chocolate, with light briny notes in the background, giving an interesting blend of flavors. Not too thick in the body, but still very creamy, which I attributed mostly to the ubiquitous head. Very nice, and very drinkable. This was my first oyster stout, and although I was a bit squeamish about the style at first, I know it won't be my last."
"The aroma's a little weak, but this stout has a nice roasted malt character that even has hints of chocolate, and some earthy hops in the finish. After reading the description of this beer, I was thinking it would be almost an ""oyster bomb"" of a beer, but I can only detect them slightly in the finish. Medium to full body, nice low carbonation level, velvety smooth across the palate, finishes dry. I'd get this again."
"D- The oysters get a tad bit overwhelming... however very palatable and would pair well with greasy apps. Sessionable ABV,"
"D- real easy going on this one. Nothing to write home about thou. A nice and simple stout. I will toss some oysters at it some time soon and see how it pairs."
"This beer is opaque. Waiting for the copious head to subside you are treated to malty chocolate aromas. At first taste is very clean and smooth like unsweetened whipped cream. A slight stouty bitterness devolopes as you get into it. Drinkability is excellent. An occaisional briny hint with good smooth mouthfeel and little astringency. Highly recommended."
"The 2010-2011 edition of this Winter seasonal may be the best Yards has ever brewed and having it on nitro is a really nice cold weather treat."
"D - One of the best stouts I have had in a while. The taste and flavors were comparable of a Guinness but this was much better. Hoping to buy some bottles of this one next time I am at Yards."
"Went to Yards to get my beloved Love Stout. When I arrived at the chalk broad I noticed Love Stout said ""Not Available"". Getting ready to leave I noticed that they had just tapped a Cask of Love Stout! My friend mentioned that I had wanted some and Kevin was so kind to pour my friends and I five free samples. Large samples at that. It was exceptionally fresh and smooth. Dark with small tan head. Aroma is chocolate and roasted malt. Sweet, Smooth and flavorful. The oysters really add a nice compliment to the roasted malt flavor. I came back the next day and had another pint, it was again exceptional but had lost just a touch of its freshness. Kevin again hooked each of us up with a pint for nothing. What a great guy and group of guys there at Yards."
"I have been waiting a while to try this one and I must say one of the very best stouts from PA I've had. Very sessionable brew."
"Overall this was a solid beer - I'd like to try it on-tap as opposed to nitro as I bet the smell would be sufficiently enhanced to make this beer better overall. Still, it's worth a shot in whatever serving method you find."
"Pours a deep, dark near black with only faint highlights of brown around the edges... firm cap of brown head from the hand pump and good retention and lacing. Scent is earthy with notes of dark roasted grains, bitter chocolate char, smoke and a touch of coffee. Taste is a nice combination of the above notes from scent along with some creamy sweetness, nothing too bold or overpowering but solid. Fuller side of medium bodied, wonderfull on cask with the appropriate carbonation. The newly revisted cask/nitro version with the oysters blows the prior bottle and tap version from 2-3 years ago out of the water. Highly drinkable."
"Love stout is black, black and dismal with a nice dark tan head thats bubbly and milkshakey. A nice smear of bubbles on the glass remain. Smell is English in that the ingredients are not bold. There is some chocolate, cocco, roast, smoke and salt from da Oysters. I don't like Oysters in general, to slimy for me feel wise, but they do impart a distinct salty vibe with some other taste I cant quite describe. Besides that this taste is a light mix of everything I just said above in the smell category. The chocolates are not very rich and/or potent. A bit of char/smoke as well. Body is thin and 'kinda' watery but it holds it's own, a nice light feel that makes for a smooth ride. Carb is low. I still kinda like this stout, it's not mindblowing and I don't have the urge to have a whole pint. But on occasion, the oysters included love stout is good for a small gander."
"Yards' Love Stout was charcoal black with a very fine, firm, mocha head. Served on nitrogen, it looked very much like Guinness Drraught with the cascading waterfall of tiny bubbles. The smell was faintly chalky with dusty roasted grain. The taste was chocolately and had acidic roast at first that progressed to a pronounced milk caramel candy and flowery finish. The beer was silky smooth, with tiny soft bubbles."
"D: Tasty version of a good style, one that can be a little bit of a turn-off for the bivalve-averse...or a turn-ON for the amorous wishing to experience the oysters supposed aphrodisiac traits (I just got the 'Love' Stout double entendre as I typed this review). Glad to have had a chance at this one, certainly it's worth a try."
"I love Yards' beers and I'll surely try this again in hopes that I'm missing something here or that whatever I believe is off IS really off and it gets worked out. Hopefully, I can get to try it from a bottle while it's around this season."
"D: Putting all the elements together this brew from Yards goes down great and asks that you have another. Definitely something to give a try."
"D: An ok mouthfeel and taste combination overall, but nothing overly impressive. Pretty good beer overall, but did not really blow me out of the water."
"Not too shabby. Even if you don't like the beer, you can't argue that this isn't true to style. As for me, I'll be enjoying the one I have and perhaps seeking out a few more to enjoy down the line. The bottom line is that Yards makes good, exciting beer."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased to-go from the Craft Ale House for around $2. Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a dark brown color akin to cola with a fizzy, quickly dissipating head to match. The nose is greeted with notes of sweet molasses, chocolate, and medium roasted grains. Aroma is the best thing this stout has going for it. Tastes of watered down mildly roasted grains, bitter cocoa, maybe some very watery weak coffee. Has a seltzer water aftertaste. A bit thin bodied with medium to moderate carbonation."
"D: A strong point of this beer. Good drinkability, low alcohol, good for cooking with. I went through a case with ease, despite my disappointment about the lack of oysters. Yards! Bring the oyster stout back! I would think that trying this beer on cask would be excellent, and I am going to seek that out."
"D - Best Yards offering I've had to date. This is an excellent example of how a stout can really come to life with cask conditioning. Very nicely done and one of my stand-outs from Philly Beer Week."
"Pours black. Aromas of smooth roasted malts, slight chocolate. Very even and mellow. Flavor begins with malts. Mellow. Simple. Some hints of chocolate. Slightly sweet. Molasas in the background. No alcohol presence. End is slightly dry with little to no bitterness. Smooth in the mouth. Medium body brew. Drinkability? I had 4 over 4 hours. Its a wonderful easy drinking stout with a mellow array of flavors that say ""Yes, I'll have another"" Great cask beer."
"Very different for a stout, although I thought the sour taste was a little overpowering and overshadowed a lot of the other flavors in this beer."
"Wasn't bad, but relative to other stouts, this one ranked low on the drinkability meter for me. I had this one on draught the other week, and it seemed much different - richer, more stout-like... was not in a position to review though."
"All-in-all, I'd say that this is the Carmen Electra of beers...nice look, questionable taste."
"D - Rich and roasty though I truly loved the version w/ oyters in the boil - it had a better feel I would say. This is a good session strength stout that went well w/ my Ancho honey bourbon glazed chicken."
"For a stout it looks good. A nice rich brown with a thick tan head is the key, however it wasn't filling or thick. Roasted malts, strong coffee, an a slight chocolate aroma are present at first smell. When you take your first sip you can taste all three coming through strong. It wasn't a heavy stout. Like said before that could have made it fuller in feel. It was a thin feel when sipped and very easy to go down w/o any creamy residue left behind in your mouth. I feel that it was lacking something this time around. Well I brought a growler full home to enjoy and it was the same. Will I get a pint again, yes, but a growler, I don't know?"
"D-Sessionable for sure. Not a bad effort just not something that I would crave to drink multiples of."
"D: Not really comparable to other bigger stouts, but a very enjoyable, sessionable darker, stout like beer. I've had some issues with consistency in these recently, but still recommended for something easier drinking."
"Pours a dark black with a one to two finger tan head. Smells of roasted malts with a hint of smoke and coffee. The taste is a little less amazing compared to the expectations coming from the smell and appearance. Theres definitely a roasted malt taste as well as smoke and coffee with a hint of lactose. The taste fell off fast and for lack of a better word became almost tasteless. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety which makes the drinkability better. I could definitely drink a few of these at the bar but nothing to write home about."
"I don't know what the ""love"" in here is, but I'm not a fan. It's looks nice enough with a pitch black body. And it smells fine with big roasted grains. Then in the flavor something goes wrong. Again, there's the big, black grains along with a distinctly English yeast milk or cream-like flavor. But there's an awful astringency that throws it all off and makes me frown and put my glass down. I didn't finish this one."
"Almost Black with tan two finged head off a gernorus pour in to an imperial pint. Through the roasted darkness you can see tons of bubbles tring to support a near guinness like head. Theres tones of carbonation and a supprising hop presance with a bit of a light body. Love also leaves a nice lace along with a coffie bitterness. Id try this one again esspically if i could find it on draft."
"The mouthfeel is again English in character, full-bodied but not super thick or syrupy. A distinct creaminess gives way to a lighter finish and moderate carbonation. Semidry with just a faint hint of warmth (booze is detectable). Well done. Tasty and very palatable. A lower abv for a stout and easy drinking nature makes for an excellent session brew."
"I thought the Love Stout was a decent brew, but there are many other stouts that I would choose before getting to this one."
"Pours very dark with a small amount of light coming through. Very minimal tan head. Nose is very mild roasted beans. Flavor is not very interesting. A bitter hit comes at you first and there is a decent thick malty tone that gives very minor hints of molasses and roasted beans. Feels kind of thickly syrup like on the tongue. Seems odd to me. This is an easy to drink stout. Fairly smooth, but doesnt bring any wild or interesting character to the table."
"D - One of the most easy-drinking stouts I've ever had. One of the most flavorful non-imperial stouts I've ever had. Would have several more of these. Great stuff."
"Tried this at the Steel City Pour last night. It's a very nice stout, with an excellent dark body and scent that leaves a nice head and lacing after the pour. It's not as strong or flavorful as it could be, but was still a nice smooth and dark stout. Good hints in the smell and taste of chocolate, even if I wish they were a bit stronger."
"A true oyster stout one of the few available on the market. This is a bottle aged almost two years in my beer cellar and the flavors have combined beutifully for a soft easily drinkable stout. The oysters are barely noticable except as something different about this stout, a slightly different scent and flavor then the usual malt, chocolate, roasty flovors your expecting from a stout. But even knowing it's oysters (clearly labeled on the bottle) it's not what I'd expect. The biggest drawback in my mind is the overabundance of carbonation, which gives it an acidic finish. Certainly a beer you must drink from a glass."
"Black color though there was almost no head present when served to me in a pint glass. Good aroma with some roasted malt and a nice chocolate malt backbone. NIce flavor to it, sweetness was spot on. I found it to be a little light-bodied for a stout, but it made it an easy drinking beer. I would order/buy this again, but there are several stouts I would pick ahead of it."
"On-tap poured into a pint glass. Appearance is dark, DARK brown, nearly black, with every-so-subtle lighter hints. A nice light brownish head - looks pretty good. Nice is fairly mild, mostly coffee, nothing too much else of not. Taste is pretty standard stout flavor. Lots of roasted malt, overall. Some mild chocolately hints that show up on the tip of your tongue. A little bit of lemon that catches you as the beer fades out, in the very mild hops. Fairly bitter overall. Overall, a solid, if not particularly noteworthy taste. Feel is surprisingly thin for a stout. Good carbonation. I liked, but didn't love this beer. It was a fairly good stout, but nothing to write home about. I'm not the biggest stout fan, and this one isn't one I'd necessarily go running back to, but it's got a standard flavor that won't underwhelm."
"Drinkability: This is a highly sessionable stout. Lately, as far as stouts are concerned, ive been drinking stronger imperials. this is a great change of pace"
"Beer poured hard gave a thick light tan head. Aroma of roasted and burnt malt with slight coffee essence start off and stay a good bit into the finish. Not much hop bouquet coming through but the roasted grains smell gets the saliva flowing. Appearance is opaque black but not too thick seeming. Burnt malt flavor is quickly turned into a bitter coffee taste that is pleasing and desirable for this style. A hint of bakers chocolate rounds out the flavor. This beer is medium to full bodied and has moderate to low carbonation. Enjoyable beer with my salted cashews and dark chocolate. Could see how this combination could get the love flowing. Excited to try this on tap next!"
"Nothing exciting a good, tasty, stout could drink a few of these."
"Enjoyable treat for sipping after dinner or with a cigar."
"no love for this one. I love this about as much as I love root canal."
"A very nice refreshing beer. Very middle of the road."
"Cheers!"
"Pours an opaque black with a modest head that lingers nicely. Sweet nose with choclatey notes. Taste shows the aforementioned chocolate with good body, not too full. Has a clean finish that adds to the drinkability. A good stout, and one of the better offerings from Yards."
" Tastes dry and roasty. Grainy. Hops are light and grassy. Mouthfeel is great for the style, not too thick. This is a stout I could drink all day, wish I had some raw oysters to pair with this."
"BeerBeing is spoiling me with these PA winner brews."
"My parents visited us last month and brought a sampler case of Yards with them. The Love Stout was the first one i tried because it was still cold outside here and i wante a heavy beer. pours dark with small head and smells normal for a stout (roasted malts, sweet chocolate). Mostly what is memorable about it is the vague saltiness that makes it a little most crisp than most stouts. I assume the saltiness is from the oysters that they supposedly put in the brew pot, but others have said that they no longer do this. If not, they must still add something to give it that salt flavor. anyway, i like it enough to want to finish the ones that are left, and it was my second favorite in the case behind their fantastic IPA."
"Drinkability: A very pleasant drinking stout which would benefit from a bit bigger mouthfeel"
"Not for everyone, but I like it."
"Overall: A decent brew, but not a killer one. The saltiness was its undoing for me, but I couldn't tell if it was intentional or not."
"Very nice and drinkable. Good fireplace beer. Light and cool enough for all seasons except maybe late summer."
"this goes down so easily I think if there were a ""light"" stout, this would be it. I'd drink it again."
"Appears a dark almost opaque cocoa cola brown forms a big tan head leaves behind even streaks of lacing. Aroma has a somewhat mineral character to it I'm guessing this is due to the oyster shell addition to the boil behind that is an herbal hop tone with dark roasted malts bringing about cocoa powder and bready chocolate notes. Taste has a smooth even flavor faint cocoa touch of bitter chocolate the roastiness is great touch of mineral bittering hops English tradition mellow flavorful and smooth. Mouthfeel is medium bodied evenly carbonated silky smooth I'm sure this would be crack on cask. Drinkability definitely a wonderful offering from Yard's which has been at times hit and miss with me so smooth nice and refreshing with more than ample enough flavor to challenge the senses."
"This beer came a dark black with a brown glow to it with no head at all. Smelled of dry roasted malts with an underlying sweet and sour caramel. The taste starts out like your average stout with a mild roasted coffee and chocolate, but then fades into what I can only call hamburger on the grill. Im getting salted and seasoned barbecued beef and smoke here with a thin underlying nutty sweetness. Holly crap! I wish I was eating a big old cheese burger with this beer. This is a really neat and well done flavor. The mouth feel was light bodied with a light carbonation that helped distribute some of the delicate salty flavors of the beer. Very weird, but surprisingly delicious!"
"This poured with an explosive, huge dark tan/light brown head. Wow! The color was a dark brown, like a caramel color/cola shade. The nose was roasty and malty. It had a medium mouthfeel with a good roasted/malt flavor in the mouth. I got a slight charcoal taste on the finish, but not enough to be off-putting. As it warmed, I also picked up a nice anise taste in the mouth. Overall, not bad, but not really a summer beer."
"alright beer once it's poured, but perhaps not worth the effort"
"Drinkability  It goes down pretty quick for a stout because of the light mouthfeel, but nothing makes Love Stout stand out for me to get more."
"Good for an everyday stout, but it could also benefit from some tweaking."
"Body is a little thin, and flavor leaves me wanting for something more."
"Overall, a good stout, but nothing really to go wild over."
"On-Tap @ Yards. This is surely a nice stout. A VERY dark ruby red brew that nears black in shade. The lacing is nice and the head is thick and consists of pure white froth. The aromas are all roasted malts, heavy chocolate notes, a bit of caramel and coffee, and some other less distinct flavor notes are in the mix as well. The taste is very roasty and malty up front with a nice chocolate-like flavor dominating the middle palate of this brew. The finish is roasty yet again, and coffee hints take hold in the finish as well. The mouthfeel is slick, smooth, and not too heavy and the drinkability is very good as well. Another solid yards brew."
"The beer is nearly black. Some deep scarlet red streaks can be seen against light. The head is light brown and creamy. Decent size and retention as well. Dusty grain, cocoa powder and a little vanilla mix in on the nose. Lacing is more than adequate. The taste leaves something to be desired. Sour, light vinegar notes are a bit off putting. Behind that, there's some decent roasted barley and chocolate, but it's hard to get at. The mouthfeel is a little too carbonated for a stout, but not overly so. Pretty average stuff here."
"Medium light body. Definitely looking forward to more of these."
"Drinkability and Overall: The best I've had from Yards yet, but nothing special. This is the only one of theirs I could make into a session brew well. A well-balanced but average stout."
"Hmm, so this is an oyster stout. Pours dark, (but I can see light through it), nice thich brown head, appears light in body. Has all the normal stout aromas with the addition of a slightly salty, sea-air smell. Tastes of chocolate, dark toasted malts, has a slight sweetness to it. Has a distinct sea-salt flavor from the whole oysters, but not fishy or over-powering. Very light mouthfeel, finishes malty and nutty. This is good, don't let the oyster thing turn you off, it works!"
"A very dark brown stout. Actually pretty much black , because the only time brown is visable is when held up to the light. Has a big brown head. The aroma is coffee and chocolate with a slight hint of vanilla back in there somewhere. The flavor starts out with a nice bittersweet chocolate character but is washed away by the watery mouthfeel. Then as some sort of delayed reaction there is a strange bitterness that appears at the back of your throat."
"I open the beer and the head rushes to the top, I have to sip some to hold it back. It pours a deep brown/light black color but the tan head is huge, so I have to wait a bit. Smell is weak but I get some sweet chocolate and maybe some roasted coffee flavors. The taste begins with a nice semi-sweet chocolate flavor but in the middle I pick up on a saltiness. There's a salty/sour mix that is really throwing me off. I can't even finish this beer b/c of this flavor. It seriously almost reminds me of seaweed or the ocean, but not in a good way. Really weird and really not my thing."
"This is a pretty good stout. Pours carbonated and with a tan head that has a little staying power. Smells of burnt malt and a little fruityness. Has a decent body a little thin and over carbonated for a stout methinks. Tastes like it smells and has a lasting after taste that blooms of chocolate maltiness and some fruitness. Not a must have but it will be add to my usual rotation."
"Went well with a hefty steak and with veggies and roasted pork. I did seem a little thinner than expected. However, this is the quality that made it seem well rounded and more useful. Even though it coats well, it also finishes clean."
"Taste, too, is distinctly salty, blending with the sharp carbonation for an almost vinegar-like feel in the mouth. Slightly sour black cherry juice. Aftertaste holds roasted flavors on the bitter carbon side. Flavor is brief and body is very smooth and a bit shallow--which brought down the taste somewhat."
"12 ounce bottle. According to the label, an oyster beer. The best beer with oysters I have tasted to date."
"A great stout. ""Smooth"" would be the best way to describe this beer. Black as night appearance, but little head. Great stout taste with little astringency. The velvety smoothness of this beer gives it a great drinkability. There is an underlying but subtle complexity in the taste, which I am sorry to say is hard to describe."
"Overall, I really liked this local brew and would love to have another!"
"ng"
"Completely lacks character. If I were to drink this blindfolded I'd be hard pressed to lable this a stout. Unremarkable and disappointing."
"Black, but light comes in easily at the edges. The light tan head is slightly sandy and fades to a thin, lacey film. The aroma is charcoal and walnuts. The acidic roastiness comes across a little harsh. The flavor explodes with the acidic burnt malt almost covering up a bit of dark chocolate. A not-quite nuttiness follows up with a light, lingering bitterness finishing it off. The body is a bit too thin. Beef up the body of this stout and youd have an excellent stout."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed big ol' 2"" of latte-shaded head, which laced and laced everywhere over the opaque dark, dark brown/black brew. Head lasts and lasts, with a little mountain of foam stacked int he middle of the glass. Aroma is lightly of deep dark malts, with some hops in the mix. Taste is dark malts, coffee primarily, and the bitterness associated with those malts. Sweetness does offset the bitterness somewhat. Mouthfeel a bit thin for the taste and appearance, kind of odd in that way. Nothing detrimental though, and the drinkability is quashed somewhat by the lack of a smooth character. But you gotta ""love"" the lacing, wow."
"Nice basic and simple. I liked it."
" Drinkability is good. I think the strange taste might get to one after a few of these, but I'd put this with oysters before any other stout. Maybe not delicious, but unique for sure."
"Thanks to beerluvr for providing the Yards sampler."
"I hate to beat a dead horse, but Yards Love Stout is not a beer that I found to be enjoyable. Maybe it was the oysters, but something did not agree with my taste buds at all."
"It is black with ruby highlights. It is not too dark for a stout. The aroma has a lot of roasted malts in the nose. The taste is of burnt malts and espresso comes to mind. There is a grape like tannin feel to the beer as well. It is overcarbonated. It is good and finishes dry, but I would have exopected to be fuller in body and a little creamier as the carbonation was a little harsh."
"The mouthfeel is somewhat thin for a stout and is dry on the tongue. The roasted tones and dryness last on the tongue after swallowing. Drinkable, but there are some more flavorful and thicker stouts out there."
"Pours dark with a small head that hangs around to lace the glass. Smells of toasted grains. Has a kind of bite, but I like it, along with the yeast and dryness. Some hop flavor, but more smokey with the smallest hint of saltiness, maybe from the oysters. Overall a pleasant brew. I drink it regularly, and will continue to do so."
"A good stout offering from Yards, a brewery which may be the most underrated in PA. A treat for those who like the dry stout character, and certainly one that I would have again!"
"poured a deep dark black with few brownish ruby highlights observable when held to the light. creamy tan head the lasted the whole glass...superb retention. full aroma of dry dark roasted barley. over-carbonation yields a slightly thinnish mouthfeel, too spritzy for stout. dry roasted flavor, slightly acidic and yeasty. hops are there for balance and not a whole lot more. i found this brew more appetizing to look at and smell than to actually drink. still, not a bad stab at the dry stout style and definitely worth a shot."
"Overall this is a very nice stout. Not very complex but drinkable and a good mix of the nice flavors that are present."
"This one pours a very dark brown, with a reddish tint to it. Thick tan head that went down pretty quickly. Fairly decent chocolate and coffe aroma, with some malt sweetness also. Medium bodied, and fairly smooth taste. Chocolate and coffe flavors, with some roastiness. A hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Maybe the oysters add calcium, but I'm sure glad I didn't taste any in there. Just what we don't need: fishy beer. Good, but nothing special."
"This pours a dark brown, almost black, with a tan head. Decent lacing. Almost opaque. It was rather difficult getting any light through it to see the actual shade. Smells wonderful. Nice roasted aroma. Some seem to peek out. Definately some chocolate. I think I'm gonna love this. Oh man, I'm not even sure how to describe this. Odd flavors going on here. Not bad, just a wierd mix. A light hops bite right at the front, mixing with what I assume are the oysters. Not quite what I was expecting, but they make a bold statement. Fading from that into a bitter chocolate and espresso roasted malt. Interesting aftertaste. Not as good as it smells, but not bad either. Full bodied but dry. Cloying even. Viscous. Clings to everything, leaving you wanting another drink. I don't think I'll be seeking this out with fervor, like I'm going to be doing with one particular BIF brew I got, but if this is ever available in my area, I would probably pick up a sixer every now and then. Not a bad brew, just not an every day brew. It smells so good, I could just sit here and smell the rest of it."
"Love Stout pours jet black, but not entirely opaque. It has a thin whitish head that remains over the beer over time. Smell is a bit like chestnut or other roasted smell, and rather faint. Start is smooth, clean, heavy. The brew is full-bodied with slight caramel, and heavy chocolate and coffee flavors. Finish is also very smooth and rich, almost like a creme.Overall this stout feels very dry, smooth, and heavy on the tongue, throat, and stomach. Love Stout leaves the mouth parched and seeking more liquid (not a bad way to sell more beer, I must admit). A good stout, to be sure, and definately one I'll be looking for in the future."
"I know some peaople have issues with conscistency of this brew, but to me it is always a delight"
"It feels great in the mouth. Very thick, very strong, almost a meal. The overall experience is less than I had wished because I was really pumped to try it after reading about it. It is a good beer but not a great one."
"A very pleasant stout, with excellent maltiness. The flavor seems a little weak at first, but gains speed quickly, finishing rich and complex."
"Thick syrupy pour wiht an extremely creamy beige head. The aroma is heavily smoky with hints of chocolate malt. The flavors build on the aroma with a predominant smoked malty flavor paired with a bit of chocolate and toffee notes. A heavier bitterness flows throughout the brew. A harsh carbonation takes away from the whole of the experience, but overall a boldly flavorful ale."
"Taste was black malt bitter, a dark earthy bitter, held up by some deeply dark malt behind it all. Had moderate but present roast flavors, strong fruity notes as well, with a surprising brightness and assertiveness to it; but they were only quick notes. Long finish was lightly dry but with quiet espresso-like bitter fruits, but of course less powerful than actual espresso. Good complexity to it for a regular not imperial stout. A bit watery mouthfeel this beer was good but uneven, and though complex it was not inviting. Regardless, if its on tap this fall I'll order it."
"It looks exactly what I whought it would look like, black in color with a tan head. Everything else was a complete surprise to me. The aroma is roasted chocolate with a hint of cardimom seed. I sensed some alcohol in the aroma as well which seems a bit odd since this wasn't really a big beer. The taste is roasty and chocolately with some coffee taste. Not very sweet at all. I was expecting a beer called love stout as being sweet and it's listed under milk stout on this site. Not a bad thing, just not what I expected. This seems to have the characteristics of an imperial stout, but with a lower alchohol content."
"Real nice pour,a ink black color with nice big,sticky,rocky head.The aroma is slightly medicinal and chocolaty.Taste is like milk chocolate and creamy,with some slight burnt notes.A real nice brew Iam glad I got it.I wanna try this on tap sometime,will look for it next winter."
"This beer poured a very dark brown, almost black color. The large head was a creamy tan. There is faint hints of roasted malt, chocolate/cocoa and fermented fruits. The flavor is similar with an added pumpernickel breadiness to it. Flavors enhance as the beer warms up. Finishes very dry and peppery. There's a detectable alcohol presence. Also - there is something unique to this stout  maybe its the fact that oysters are added directly to the boil. I don't know what it is, but this beer has a distinct and unique flavor."
"A nice body on this one....not a real petite little thing by any means (which is usually my type)...This one is a full figured dynamo I'm not sure I can handle....As I taste her I am slightly let down....but only for an instance....I realize this isn't that airbrushed beauty on the Guiness poster...instead this is a real, live stout....no airbrushing to hide the imperfections....Yes it has a nice burnt malt flavor and is very creamy but wasn't this supposed to be a Sweet Stout....Doesn't seem to match up to that Mackesons I saw in the centerfold...But maybe I am holding this one up to too high of standards...maybe I should except her for who she is ....a very nice looking and tasting stout that would be a nice stout to take out again(drinkability) and even bring home to mom....Still, she is not one of the hottest Stout's I've seen.....Not a bad first date though....we almost made a ""Love"" connection...."
"This is an interesting brew. The first impression from the nose leads you to believe that you have stumbled upon a sweet stout. However, the taste is very complex. There are sweet notes, but also very rich and dry tastes that impart a dry or imperial stout. The hops are hard to pinpoint. There is so much dark malt that the hops do not really shine through. This beer is brewed with oysters in the brewkettle to add a mineral component. That seems to be what balances out the sweet, milk stout characteristics. This stout is by far, the most unique stout I have ever had the opportunity to taste. As you move towards the middle of the beer you are almost certain that you are drinking an imperial stout with a very balanced and deep, rich flavor. At 5% alcohol, this is an impressive stout in today's culture of high octane imperials. By the end of the beer the sweetness is all but gone. I will definately check this out again."
"Pours a dark black color with a toffee colored edging. There is virtually no head. The aroma is caramalized sugar that is just a bit burnt, a bit of bourbonesque alcohol notes, and some roasted malt sweetness. A hint of chocolate slides in as well. The taste is sweet roasted malt, dark chocolate, and a bit of espresso on the finish. Just enough bitterness is present to clean up the sweetness between drinks. The mouthfeel is smooth, but a bit lacking in the carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, as this beer goes down way too easy. I'll definitely pick up some more of these in the future."
"Prost!"
"Taste was sharp coffee bitterness at the start with smooth milky sweetness following. Slightly slick bittersweet chocolate flavor backs everything up. The mouthfeel is oily, but rather light. Not very much weight from the mouthfeel perspective, rather thin. Finishes bittersweet and quick. Overall a descent stout. The body could be better. Complexity could be a bit better as well. The aroma of this beer is what really shines, everything else is just above average."
"Well, I did not love this one. It was a decent stout, but it was thin and didn't have enough flavor for me. I have heard that this will make a person cry on cask, so I will have to pay a few buddies a visit in Philly."
"Black in color with a thick, dark tan head. Aroma is lightly roasty, somewhat salty with a bitter chocolate undertone. First impression I got was of the beers being a bit thin. Malt-dominated, with a fairly nice roasty character and a decently bitter finish, and some prune-like fruit notes developing mid-palate. Aftertaste is quite nice, but still the flavor profile is a bit one-dimensional. Drinkable, but not very memorable."
"My girlfriend has become a big fan of this stout since i brought a case back to school. Has a bittersweet chocolate taste. Light carbonation and thinner than expected body. Aroma is that of coffee and chocolates. I liked this brew but for the same style I think sam adams cream stout is a little better."
"Pours out black with brownish edges and a very thin dark tan head. Nose is coffee, a little chocolate. The flavours here are dominated by the coffee characteristics and a quite strong bitterness. What I found curious (and a little offputting) was a slight sour note towards the end of the mouthful. Finishes again with the bitterness. Smooth over the tongue, carbonation is quite low (this is bottle conditioned), and kind of a thin or light feel also shows itself. Good, but that sour note (must be the oysters...?) makes me think that it's not for constant quaffing."
"Cool label on the Love Stout from this local Philly brewer. Nose of coffee and dark chocolate from this black brew, thin lace atop. Quite malty for a stout, with the sweetness I expected of a milk stout. However, there is a nice crisp bitter hop finish that balances quite nicely with the sweetness. Mouthfeel is nothing but smooth, although it's a tad thin. Some more body would be appreciated, but this is a quality stout. I look forward to more from this brewery."
"Thank you frank4sail!"
"Very nice Stout. Pours a dark brown, almost black with sparkling highlights. Big, creamy head that lasts. Creamy sweet mouthfeel, and taste, toffee and lightly toasty taste. Big creamy finish, lightly hopped and crisp. Real good Stout, very drinkable."
"This beer pours into the glass a dark, dark brown color that when held up to the glass showed some light of ruby red. The head was thick and beige/tan in color. The lace, like a good stout, lasted to the bottom of the glass. The aroma was of coffee, milky/cream, roasted malt, some fruit and hops. The taste first showed up hops, a little bitter, then the milky coffee took over the dominance of the taste with hints of the fruit coming in and out very easy. Sweet and roast malt. It ends nice and slightly dry. Good beer, enjoyed it, and went back for seconds."
"Acquired via trade. I tried it after Victory Storm King, and while not on the same level it was still a decent brew. Pours a deep dark brown with a medium dark beige head. Earthy coffee/chocolate aroma. Not sure what oysters brought to the table but I am always for something different. Had a bottle-conditioned texture, with coffee, chocolate and prunes (?) in the flavor. Rather sharp finish. Not too bad."
"Fresh hop/cocoa/roast nose.  Rich tan head with a lasting lace.  Deep dark plum color which is opeque.  The initial taste hits you with hop bitterness in the boil along with some fruityness... this then mellows into a roast malt smooth base.  Notes of bitter chocolate and expresso also touch the tongue.  The roast is earthy and leaves a slightly dry tongued finish.  The mouth is smooth a solid the entire way.  This beer shows impressive complexity and balance.  I ""love"" this stout. It is a stand out selection for Yards."
"55 degree gravity pour."
"Bottle conditioned. Classic stout appearance: black body. a few ruby highlights, and a frothy tan head clingly to the sides as it subsides. Heavy roasted coffee and chocolate nose.  A tingle of hops accompanies the coffee and chocolate flavors on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Brewed with oysters, but I don't detect any seafood in the glass. Would go well with a plateful though. A solid but not spectacular stout."
"Roasted coffee and chocolate assault the nose.  The beer is dark brown and opaque with a nice brown head that slides down the glass.  Coffee and cholcate flavors are the most prominent with only a hint of sweetness... think bitter chocolate.  Overall a very nice stout."
"Pours into the glass with the usual (for a stout/porter) tan/mocha head with a good Belgian lace going on. This beer is opaque, even when held directly in front of a bare lightbulb...""None more black", as Derek from Spinal Tap might say. The nose is nice and chocolatey, a nicely balanced bittersweet aroma, with slight hints of smoke. Taste is somewhat light on the palate...not alot of sweetness from the malts here, more of that great bittersweet chocolate & a brief flash of hop bitterness. Smooth-drinking is the key word here! Finishes with a light mouthfeel, a very tasty ""session"" beer...dumb name though! And I am glad to report not a trace of the purported 150 lbs. of whole oysters that is added to the boil is present. :o)"
"This is an oyster stout. Oysters are added to the kettle during the boil but don't worry, it doesn't give it any fish flavor! It may be raising the pH, however, due to an addition of calcium. But the aphrodisiac qualities of the oysters did inspire the name. Nice ""black"" with brown highlights. The aroma is limited, offering roastiness, a little malt, and maybe some alcohol. I guess that's expected for the style. The head is tan but dissipates quickly. Very nice flavor with some sweet malt, a little light chocolate, and a balanced roastiness. Body is a little thinner than anticipated. Finish is long lasting, almost mouth-coating. The roastiness just doesn't want to go away! A nice pint to relax with after work."
"A decent stoudt, little on the sweet side.  I won't pretend that I can distinguish the oysters, but I'll trust they are in it.  Nothing really sets this stoudt above the others."
"Pours a nice dark brown almost black color...Very light malt aromas on the nose...On the palate there are nice notes of English dark malts, tiny chocolate tones and not sure what flavor elements the oysters add, but this is nicely sweet, strong and full flavored and has exceptionally smooth mouth feel. Overall a very enjoyable Stout..."
