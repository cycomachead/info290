"Deceptive indeed, as well as very tasty. Certainly played up the chipotle spice but the chocolate is revving at full force as well. I find this a tasty beer, but couldn't have it very often. As an interesting beer it really captures that mayan spiced hot chocolate feel, with a really satisfying spiciness to it, smoky, earthy, and bittersweet. Quite nice and enjoyable."
"Overall: Have enjoyed many chocolate stouts before and would say this one is average if not slightly above. Very good strong chocolate aroma but chipotle spice take over on the palate masking other potential flavors."

"Jet black with a ring of eggshell-tan head with good lace. Smell is a big chocolate and cocoa powder upfront, touch of peppery spice that gives a bit of a nostril tingle, not a ton going on but certainly delivers on being a chocolate-chipotle stout. Taste is all chocolate initially, milk chocolate and hershey syrup, chipotle is subtle initially but is a little more noticeable as it warms and shows up in the finish, roast and a touch of sweetness from all that chocolate. Medium-light carbonation, light-medium body. Not bad to have once in a while but not something I could drink on a regular basis, still quite drinkable."

"O: I like it. The smell beats its other qualitIes by far though. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours black under minimal creaminess coating the surface and leaving behind strings of lace here and there.  Smell is immediately chocolaty followed by vanilla and a little pepper.   Flavor follows suit with an increased chili pepper note, though it never gets spicy.  Roasted malt, cocoa, nuts, and some fruity yeast.  Less intensely chocolaty than the smell, closer to more of a standard stout with a pepper twist.  Medium bodied with some tingly carbonation and lingering bitterness. Not bad."

"Really digging this beer.  It's not exceptional, but an example of a well done, solid, as promised beer."

"The nose is heavy milk chocolate, a little earthy green pepper, lots of lactose and roasted malt.   This smells amazing.  The flavor is similar, lots of chocolate, earthy dryness, bitter hops and just a bit of heat.  The heat from the pepper plays well with the chocolate.  This is pretty balanced and the flavors pair well.  Really enjoyable finish too."

"This pitch black brew with a small tan head has a complex and interesting aroma.  You can smell the chocolate and chipotle.  The flavor is powerful and refreshing but this is not a style of beer that I am an aficionado of.  If chocolate flavored beer is a must then this is a must.  if you are feeling adventurous I would try it also.  It isn't bad, in fact I enjoyed the more I drank of it (go figure)"

"Average looking pour, but really nice fine lace. Lots of chocolate on the nose and to taste. Charcoal and a bit of smoke. Nice roastiness, bittersweet. The chipolte is not big and in your face, but it gives the beer a wonderfully odd note that is quite enjoyable. Creamy, lingering finish and a tingle from the pepper as you go along. Fun and interesting, a tasty brew, but basically a one off I think."

"The Mayan combines a Young's reminiscent brand of biscuity, vanilla-laden    Cadbury-like chocolate with a restrained and pleasant level of spice. While I imagine a little cinnamon or coffee could enhance the depth, it's perfectly serviceable just the way it is. Be sure to circle your calendar for the next release."
"500ml bottle had at the distillery in Savannah."

"Great beer, solid taste and consistency"
"Overall: pretty much what you'd expect a milk chocolate bar tinged with chipotle to taste like - great flavour, a bit too sweet, and balance leans to the pepper, don't expect subtly"

"I dig the chocolate in the beginning, and the balanced chili flavours, but it became insipid and dusty too fast."

"Enjoy"

"Overall - Not much else to say other than a very solid milk stout with the added chipotle kick. Worth a shot."

"O: highly reccommended, especially for chocolate lovers."
"O: Really a very good authentic take on Mayan/Mexican Chocolate in a beer - easy to drink and enjoyable with a really nice but subtle presence of chipotle peppers. Definitely one I would grab again."
"O:The taste of this beer is rather interesting as it transitions to rich flavors of dark chocolate to spicy flavors of chipotle."

"Pours nearly pitch black except for a deep reddish brown tinge when held up to the light,a half finger beige colored head atop.Milk chocolate notes jump out in the nose with light nuttiness,although I don't get any smoky chipotle the aromas really stand out for me.Lightly carbonated wich is good just a tad thin but it doesn't take away from the flavor profile in any way.Mildly sweet chocolate at the onset of the palate with that hint of nuttiness,the chipotle comes in the finish and lingers in the back of the throat nicely.What a cool beer from a ""new to my area"" Yorkshire brewer,I will be trying other stuff from Ilkley in the future."
"Rather nice - Ilkley have taken a challenging style and made a good fist of it. Looks the part, while the aroma is deceptively sweet and chocolate-laden. The flavour is a superb blend of roasted malt, chocolate and chipotles that delivers a dark, spicy twang. Body is OK but could stand to be thicker and creamier. Overall this is a treat for the senses. If you like chillies and chocolate then this is the brew for you."
