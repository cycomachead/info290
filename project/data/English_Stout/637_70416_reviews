"Right up my alley."
""
"Maybe I am under the influence of some odd spell cast when I opened the bottle, but I feel that this is an underrated brew. ""Belgian stout"" should perhaps be a separate style designation, at least for splitters such as myself. Maybe this could use a few rougher edges to add complexity and character? In any event, might be worth a second look if you hated it on the first pass."

"I found this a pleasant example of a stout. It has a nice mouth feel with a pleasant roasted character. Its straight ahead simple to enjoy stout. Not the best but a solid entry none the less."

"O - Too thin for a stout, needs to be more robust in both body and flavor -= not much going."
"Quite unique stout with a good balance between roasted- ashy, tart, fruity and spicy notes. In my opinion this is underestimated once flavors are not the usual easy ones for Stout. Interesting that it sure has Dupont genes there."

"Overall:  Rather disappointing for a Belgian stout and the green bottle doesn't help matters"

"Massively carbonated with a tightly knit khaki colored head. Dark brown in color and only a bit of light gets through. Brussels lacing. This beer is virtually odorless,but with a lot of effort I got a bit of dark malt. The flavor is a bit on the sweet dark malty side. Perhaps a bit of powdered cocoa in the mix. The mouth is creamy and dry."
""
"Overall. A nice stout. Middle of the road bold and mellowed significantly as it sat in the glass."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/27/2013. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2-3 finger fairly dense and fluffy tan head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, pear, apple, clove, pepper, herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, pear, apple, clove, pepper, herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness. Slight amount of earthy roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, dark bread, raisin, pear, apple, clove, pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Belgian stout. Good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A unique and pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Highly drinkable, but I wouldn't drink more than one bottle. it's a typical stout. It could be more bitter and less carbonated. Good, but not great."

"An English stout, by way of the Wallonian countryside, this is. Perhaps there's a reason for that there English channel - the English have their stout, and the Belgians have their fruit and yeast, ne'er the two shall meet. But here they have, and the result is middling at best, and not something I'll be jumping to revisit."
"O/D - Not overly flavourful or complex. OK but nothing I'd reach for again."
"Overall, a disappointing stout. I try not to set expectations for beers before trying them, but when they come from a reputable brewery such as Dupont, it's hard not too. The highlight for me was the nose. It was complex and flavourful. If only that were to have continued into the rest of the categories. The mouthfeel is what really threw me off with this beer. It's too thin and lacked balance. Their saison is on another level in comparison to this, and the former is what I'll stick to."

"Monk's Stout has the appearance of a porter or dry stout, being pitch black with a quarter inch tan head. For the aroma, I picked up a lot of various dark fruit esters, and Belgian yeast. I found that the tast was very smoky, a bit 'roasted,' and tart. Once the beer sat for a little while, it began to give off some chocolately flavors too. Very light bodied and light in the mouth feel, this is something different. It did not quite taste like a Belgian or a Stout. Not sure if I would order this again other than to try and better understand or appreciate it."
""
""
"Sourish and bitterish aftertaste is not the best reature. This is certainly a beer that doesn't fit easily into the catalogue, but it's very drinkable and refreshing. From the 750 ml bottle bought at Bine & Vine in San Diego."
""
""
"O - It's OK, but not my favorite stout. Kind of drinkable but not terribly tasty."
"Final Grade: 3.24, a serviceable C+. Brasserie Dupont's Monk's Stout is an odd beast. I could drink most of my favourite stouts all night, and there are few Belgian-style ales I would ever turn down a second helping of - but this fusion of the two leaves me feeling underwhelmed, and one glass will be more than enough for me. The taste is fine, but the burnt, ashy mouthfeel really hurts its drinkability. I don't regret getting this one, but I doubt I'll pick it up again, or recommend it to anyone looking for a traditional stout."
""
"Belgium isn't exactly known for its stouts. While enjoyable, Monk's Stout fails to make much headway in that department. Nevertheless, Brasserie Dupont could have done nothing for the rest of its existence but make Saisons and the world would still love them, so I respect the experimental efforts and will support any other ambitions this excellent producer comes up with."

"Overall: first sip wasn't bad, but it rapidly fell apart with a surprisingly weak body and sour, vinegary flavour - I'm all for trying something different, but this just isn't right"
""
""
"O - Decent enough but fairly average overall."
""
""
"O: Tartness is really throwing this off. The aroma is very nice and well blended. I could smell this for hours. For the price tag this is not something I would ever purchase again but I enjoyed the experience."
"Overall, not what I would expect from Dupont. An OK stout, nothing exciting but quite drinkable."
"Bottle from the Dupont LCBO feature, and the weakest though most unique offering.. Body looks like a nitro black. Faint roastiness, more molasses taste. A weaker stout for sure. So-so drinkability, and dare I say a little thin.A little bitter but not interesting.Watered down coffee substitute."
"Overall - Not really a stout.. Maybe more like a Schwarzbier. Anyways, I expected more from this brewer. Still decent, just needs more flavour and less of a watery feel."

"O: I just love the flavours of this beer. Some belgian notes are well present."
""
"It was intended to be a British-Belgian stout hybrid (I think), but the end result was certainly far less than the sum of its parts. Not a fan of this brew at all, which is a shame, as I was really looking forward to this. Don't think I'll be drinking this again."
""
"Brownish ruby body, ring of tan head, not much lace to speak of. A bit of roast, smokey with some darker fruits, fairly odd smelling, yeasty and a lingering note of plastic that seems to persist. Taste has a bit of smoke and charred/ashy flavours as well, dark fruits with a bit of an odd bitterness as well here. High carbonation, light bodied, below average feel for a stout. Really quite unimpressive, not quite a stout and not quite a dark belgian, too many odd smells and flavours to make this enjoyable."
"(3.5) D: Was pretty pumped to try this as part of the Dupont LCBO release but I donâ€™t think I will be revisiting this one. Appearance and aroma were nice but the taste was too sour for my stouts and mouthfeel left a bit to be desired."
""
"This wasn't terrible, but it wasn't fantastic. This had flavors and aromas that I never imagined or thought would ever go in a bottle. I guess I have some learning still to do."

"D - Great balanced Belgian/English style stout."

"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Cork says 2011 on it, so I assume it was bottled sometime last year. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a huge 3 inch head. This one foamed up pretty much as soon as I started the pour, and it took a while for the head to recede so I could get a somewhat full glass. There's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice but light, it smells like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and some dark fruit. The brew tastes like roasted and burnt/charred malt, coffee, bitter herbs, and a bit of tart dark fruit. I liked the taste of this the longer I drank it. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and has high carbonation. I thought this was a decent enough brew, I liked it."

""

"O: Easy drinking beer but, at the same time, not very attractive. A British style beer made in Belgian. That's perhaps the most interesting point about this beer"
"Overall it's OK but not memorable, nor a beer I'll hunt for-- lots of others out there..."
""
""
""
""
"A mediocre itteration of this style, pass ..."
"Overall an interesting, unique beer - sort of a cross between a Belgian dark and a porter. While I enjoyed it for what it was, it's not a beer I'd seek out again."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark fruits, plum wine, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with some pomegranate and dark roasted malt flavors on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is quite disappointing coming from Dupont."

"O: This beer is nice and light, making it very easy to drink. It seems to taste like a hybrid between a dry stout and a saison."
"O: Surprisingly refreshing, a style that I do not often have but almost reminds me of what the hybrid of a saison and an export stout would be like. Enjoyable but not one that I would run out to get again soon."
"First brewed in the 1950s, Dupont reincarnated this from their recipe archives. This one could and should have been tweaked a bit more. Itâ€™s trying to be more of a Stout and forgetting itâ€™s Belgian, but don't blame the monksâ€”they had nothing to do with it. Worth a try if you can handle an acrid burnt character."
"Pour is opaque black with a thin tan colored head. The nose is nice, dry and roasted malt, notes of coffee and light chocolate, with a light hop balance. The taste is equally as nice. Very roasty with notes of coffee. Some sweet hop profile in the finish balances. Creamy and soft body with strong carbonation and a dry finish. Deep roasted malt profile and nice balance."
""
"D - Ok, I can't get over the fact that this beer smells, and to a lesser degree tastes, like ham. Not good ham either, more like old lunch meat... or burnt, rotten ham. Really bad, even more disappointing considering it comes from a brewery that we all know can do so much better than this. I didn't think I would ever have a Dupont drain pour, but here it is... and there it goes."
"Overall: This one is just not very good. It may actually deserve a lower ranking. Its not very drinkable and if not for being a share, this would have been a drain pour."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a light roast, a small caramel and coffee presence. In the taste, roasty, coffee to caramel like, with a toffee like sweetness. Quite smooth and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, note of coffee in the aftertaste. Nice coffee notes and sweetness of caramel and toffee, pleasant and nice to drink."

"To be honest, I understand why this isn't that highly regarded. But it's a really interesting brew nonetheless. It has far more of that roast character than you ever see in a Belgian ale, but in most other respects it really falls into that style. As a result, it's a weird amalgam that doesn't really fit anywhere. That makes it challenging, but it also makes it quite fascinating."
"O: Nothing spectacular, but this is an easy-drinking stout â€” don't mind putting down all 750 MLs on my own."
""
""
""
"3.5 D: I would never, ever buy this again, but I can't say I didn't enjoy it. It's not impressive in the least, but for some reason it's just what I wanted right now."

"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian dark ale (not a Stout)."
""
""
"O - Good beer, with some eclectic combinations could have a few in one sitting."
"overall - reminded me of a dry Irish stout."
"A nice expression of a stout, light in character, and quite drinkable, although lacking a bit of depth in taste."
"Beer is super thin and a little bitter, not much going on here, it is drinkable but unremarkable, not a repeat."
"- This is a light stout for sure, and may throw a few people off thinking that this would be some big heavy stout. It's not, but a nice simple stout with a subtle Belgian twist. I like it, I feel it is solid, and one I would drink again. I just think I would be more likely to buy it if it were on tap at a lesser price."
"Pours nearly black without any real head formation or lace. A good swirl brings a few mocha bubbles, but that's about it. The nose brings some nice roasted chocolate character with some slight Belgian-yeast aromatics. The flavor falls back with heavy roast; the chocolate and yeast are merely background noise. Medium body with a semi-dry finish that is a bit acrid. Decent."
"25oz bottle, corked and caged. Opens with a vigorous pop. Pours a clear, dark brown with a light head consisting of lots of really tiny bubbles. Aroma is strange, mineral, tart, sour, metallic. In the taste, much different than the nose, with a good dose of lush chocolate, malted milk, roast and coffee grounds. Well balanced, though there is little hop flavor, just mild leafy notes. More cocoa, coffee and toast. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, smooth and creamy, finishing slightly dry. Overall, I was quite surprised with this one, a really nice find. A Belgian stout with some character."
""
"Hehe, maybe."
""
""
""
" I'm a bit disappointed in this one. I love the other beers from DuPont, so I guess my expectations were a little high. Oh well, they can't all be winners."
""
"OVERALL: Another Belgian style stout that is neither good nor awful. Not off-putting by any sense of the imagination, but also not memorable or worth re-visiting on purpose. Might as well pass on this and try something else."
""
""
"O - Overall this beer really is fairly mediocre at best. Glad I didnt buy a bottle of this and only had to stomach the small pour of this stuff. Ugh."
""
""
""
"Nose-filling aroma has firm tones of charred wood and yeast with a hint of licorice. It pours a deep opaque sable with a fairly thick tan head. Smoky, malty flavor has tones of molasses, caramel and roast coffee with a licorice hint. Texture is a teensy on the thin side but strongly tingly. Overall, if not the best porter available, a worthy beer."
""
""
"Thin bodied and watery with lots of tight carbonation(slight oxidization) that lingers throughout making it tough to drink. Â  Â Some roasted chocolate malt but its very dry and flavorless with subtle metallic and cardboard. Â Really unpleasant to drink. Â I was told by two different bartenders and another BA that this is the way the beer tasted. Â Not infected, just not very good. Â  I'm not so sure but either way it tastes pretty awful."
"O- Coffeeish."
"O: Before trying this beer I could safely say that Brasserie Dupont does not produce a single bad beer, but now I can't say that. My respect for the brewery keeps me from giving this unfortunate accident an absolutely stinging review, but it really is pretty awful. It's like someone who had never tasted a stout, but had perhaps seen a few Guinness advertisements, decided to brew a stout. With the exception of color, this beer has nothing in common with real stouts. What was the brewing team at Dupont thinking?"
"With DuPont's reputation as a saison brewer, it's interesting to see something this dark come out from their way. It pours a deep black-brown, translucent at the edges evincing a mild bit o' dark garnet, topped by about two fingers of dusty khaki foam. The nose comprises roasted malts (very husk-y, I might add), light chocolate powder, and toasted wheat. The taste goes further down the roasty road, with heavy roasted malts, darkly-toasted wheat, and what seems like lightly acridly bitter coffee. Things are a bit harsh here. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and one of the driest finishes I've ever seen in a stout. The dryness doesn't help the bitterness any... Overall, I can't say I'm a fan of this beer. It's too burnt, too roasty, for its own good."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a black color stout with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt with notes of the typical Belgian malt used by Dupont. Taste is a mix between some dry roasted malt with a solid malt backbone and light dry esters of black chocolate. Body is somewhat thin with great carbonation. OK though I have a huge preference for Dupont regular saison over this."
"O - This was disappointing. I wouldn't get this again. Really boring, and what I did find interesting about this beer was not that pleasant. No aftertaste lingers."
""
""
"Dupont's Stout pours in the tulip black creating a dark black look in the vessel. That takes care of that. A dense like cream colored inch of foam up top with good retention, yet no stick. Smell is english yeast up to the max. Interesting to see a Belgian brewery take on this style. More smells- peat, smoke, chocolate, vanilla and cream. Taste is pretty much stated above in the taste portion. The english ingredients take hold alot. Cocco, vanilla, cream and peat influence. Feel is light bodied with tight carb that's not bitey, yet there is a sourness towards the end which kills it. I like this low alcohol and light bodied stout, but it tastes a bit disjointed and the aftertaste is horrid."
""
""
"O: I love Dupont, Saison Dupont is a modern classic, and they make a lot of good beer. I loved the new witbier I recently had from them. This just isn't that good. Bland and uninspiring unfortunately."
"jd"
"Wanted and expected a lot more from this Stout, not impressed at all. Looks good, but fails to deliver."
"O - Not a bad stout but for me there is not much to go on. I rather have an Imperial."
"An interesting beer. And an interesting mix of styles. Not sure if people are crying out for an English stout crossed with a Belgian pale. But at least Dupont can say they have done it."
"(Am finally getting around to posting my notes taken on the spot at a winter-beer festival in Brussels last December. The festival billed as the debut of the beer; perhaps it had more than one. And what was presented might have been more of a preview, as I gathered from later speaking with someone at Dupont, possibly it was not the final recipe for the commercial run. When I find it again in good tasting environment, I'll re-review. For what it's worth, here goes:) Poured from the keg perfectly black with just a ring of ivory foam. Aroma of coffee, pepper, some herbal spice like coriander, a toasty or caramelized bread note. Surprisingly little malt sweetness, rather burnt-tasting, rather un-Belgian but very welcome. Some coriander or grain of paradise in there, too, and hops sneaks in at the end. Slight astringency, definitely less chewy than the standard Belgian take on stout -- again, not necessarily a bad thing, and all the more quaffable for it."
"Pretty harsh roasty notes..."
"O - I applaud the belgians for attempting a stout, this is OK in places but lacks something in others."
"Dr: A great, well priced Belgian made stout, this beer will appease any fan of the style. I love it. Give her a spin."
