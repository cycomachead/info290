4.01,8.1,4.75,3.75,4,4.25,4,"The beer pours a molasses color and sits in the glass as mahogany brown with a massive head of light khaki-colored bubbles of all shapes and sizes, which takes its time in dissipating. The head leaves a ringed lacing of fat soapy bubbles on the glass. In body, the beer appears too dark for light to penetrate it, though it did seem clean as the beer was being poured. That being said, the folks at Mystic are the wizards of yeast, and they don’t filter their beers, so I’m willing to bet there are a few floaties hanging out in this beer. On the nose, the beer smells initially like a metallic pear, but not in a bad way. As you shove your nose in this beer it opens up into soft cocoa scents with touches of earthy espresso and dark fruity notes. The smell is soft and subtle on the nose, much like an Irish dry stout is, but this smell is also deeply complex and interesting with yeast esters. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and then tart, and then slightly bitter with roast. In flavor it begins like a classic stout with dry roasty chocolate and coffee flavors and even a touch of coffee, but this is then blanketed as the taste moves forward and yeast esters plunge onto the tongue to suggest funky dark fruit flavors with a slightly metallic twinge. Pear and even slight peach flavors can also be tasted in the esters. The beer finishes closer to a dry stout with bitter roast, but with a nice tart dark fruit kick that adds complexity to the finish. The aftertaste is fairly soft and sweet with light fruit flavors and a faint reminder of dried roast malt with a touch of smoke. In the mouth the beer feels fluffy with medium carbonation and a slight pucker from the acid. In body the beer feels just about medium, and after the beer leaves the mouth is left slightly dry but puckering. Overall, this is a fantastically bizarre beer. It’s not an Irish dry stout at all, though it does show some qualities of a dry stout. It has amazing funky esters, and could quite well be the start of a new style. A New England Dark Ale! Or a Suffolk Dark Ale if we must call it that… Whatever it is, it is super drinkable and tasty, with amazing and flavorful yeast character. Try this beer! It is bizarre and tasty!","Maxwell","May 22, 2013"

3.65,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, there are excellent flavors in this brew, and the combination of ash and lovely fruit esters was delightful. However, the flavors ultimately come across as quite light and airy in presence, fading quickly and never quite reaching a decent strength even at their zenith, giving the brew a watery feel. And the high levels of carbonation add a strange mouthfeel, and quickly fill the stomach with air. Tone down the bubbly and boost the amount of ingredients by a few notches—say, make it 10% ABV—and this will be great beer.","jondeelee","May 03, 2012"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Very dark brown with a black appearance, two-finger thick light khaki head. Big smoky booziness with a complex arrangement of molasses, heavy cream, ground coffee, bittersweet chocolates, and dark fruits such as figs, cherries and dates come off the aroma. First sip is heavy on the dark fruits, moving into the creamy richness of coffee, bittersweet chocolates and molasses. Hints of smoke and bourbon make their way through into it's medium-sized body. Mildly bitter, rich and complex mouthfeel. Smooth and dry, boozy finish.","YouSkeete","Apr 11, 2012"

Taste is dark malts, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, raisins, prunes, plums. This is very complex lots of stuff going on here. Medium to thick body, quite a bit of carbonation, maybe too much, sweet saison-esque mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this beer. The carbonation might be a touch on the high side, but the flavors and aromas are fantastic.

Really nice looking. Smell is kind of off putting. I can pick up on some dark malts, and light Belgian yeast. Almost has a wine character to the smell. Roasted barley really pulls through on the sip. Much thicker than I expected (which is relieving). Tastes like a stout, just Belgiany. Nice malty aftertaste. Molasses is mild competing against the malt bill. Pretty interesting beer. Oak in hitting the end of the sip. Bitterness in pleasant and suiting. I like it more as I sip on, but this has some odd conflicting flavors in my humble opinion. Interesting concept.

The color is quite dark, but just a shade or two away from being black. A nice pillow like white heading perks up right away. Some roast comes through in the beginning of the smell, along with some yeasty tones, chocolate, cola and brown bread. Lots of stone fruit comes through in the flavor initially, with the molasses ending things on a sweet, yet somewhat spiced note. There are some robust notes to it that are found in some dubbels that I am not crazy about, but the yeast they are using here is really alive and in your face. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, with a good level of carbonation, and certainly plenty going on complexity wise. I must say that I was not as taken as some others were with their Saison, but this one really delivered for me. It is very reminiscent of Brooklyn Local 2 if you ask me. Either way, this one gets two big thumbs up from me. Cheers","jamie2dope","Oct 23, 2011"
