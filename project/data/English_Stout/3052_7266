3.91,0,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The taste is very good and this is a fine stout. I appreciate the 4.8% ABV with big flavors and a fairly full palate. Some of the American brewers should take note that you don't need to have ridiculous ABV to make a fine beer, and often the ABV can detract as much as impart. That being said, the beer has nice drying dark roasted malts, some sweeter notes do form underneath, but the beer has a nice semi-bitter chocolate flavor throughout. This beer dries up considerably in the finish and the semi-bitter becomes full out dry in the end. There is a touch of metallic in this beer which gets in the way and detracts. Overall, this is a really nice, light to medium bodied stout that has lots of fine qualities.","albern","Mar 12, 2011"

The flavor is mostly of roasted malt with a mild acidity on the end with just a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel is rather thin, but not too harsh either. This beer is sippable, but that's more due to it's lower ABV rather than to an outstanding flavor.","RedSpecial1","Nov 25, 2010"

I really enjoyed the taste of this beer more than anything but I really couldn't get a good grasp on the smell due to the fizzies jumping up and tickling my nose and the mouthfeel was that of drinking over carbonated drink.

Poured a mammoth volume of very foamy, frothy, sudsy, light tan head that lasts a long time and lots of lace. Color is a clear, almost opaque, very dark brown. Aroma is malt, roast, toffee, cocoa, coffee, vanilla. Flavor is like aroma and very tasty. No sharpness at all; well balanced. Body is good once it settles down.

4.33,10.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bought on a whim while in the mood for a heavy winter UK beer. Opaque to the edges of the glass where, if you shine a light behind the glass, you can see teeny teeny teeny little bubbles quickly flowing in evenly-spaced columns toward the top of the brew. How'd they do that? Pours with a heavy, dense and gi-normous head which takes forever to settle down into a puffy mound, not unlike that found on top of a Duvel. You can even style it a bit with your fingers. Loads of toffee, chocolate and roasted grain in the aroma. The body was lighter than I expected, which isn't necessarily a terrible thing. The taste, however, was excellent: plenty of roast and toast, with apricots, chocolate, raisins and a slap of orange at the end. Lightly hopped but there's enough to give an edge. An absolute malty delight-- a beer which has earned a spot in my refrigerator door. According to the Web site it's only available for two months out of the year. I'll be stocking up later this week.","gfreed","Jan 04, 2010"
3.85,-1.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"A thin, dark brown head with low retention. Color was a deep brown with ruby highlights. Mouthfeel was medium with chocolate and coffee flavors competing for attention.

Quelle domage.","woodychandler","Dec 02, 2009"
4.06,3.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Hook Norton Double Stout poured a very dark brown, appearing black, with a massive foamy tan head. It looked like a root beer float. Good lacing on the glass as well. Smell was brown sugar and roasted coffee. Taste was full of dark chocolate, and hints of roasted malt. Mouthfeel was ok, a bit sticky but not bad. Drinkability was good. Overall this was a nice stout. Hard to come by the English Stout style, this one was nice.","nickynick","Sep 30, 2009"
4.1,4.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"What a super crazy craggy, tan head of three fingers and a dark cola with antique copper highlights. Nice column of bubbling.The aroma is of dry chocolate chips dark roasted malts, light brown sugar and Starbucks French roast coffee grounds. The taste is very roast with maybe a touch of smokey oak as they roast some coffee beans. As you sit with some hot, dark cocoa. Dry, bubbley, and smooth all in one. Quite the session stout in my opinion. Full of flavor and not heavy on the palate.","scruffwhor","Sep 21, 2009"
3.69,-5.6,2.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Dark chocolate with a touch of heavily creamed coffee is the flavor. Again, the alcohol is more present than the ABV suggests.

4.15,6.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"A very pleasant stout with a distinctly English character. The beer pours a very dark reddish-brown color that is just barely translucent when held up to a light source. Without backlighting, the beer appears opaque and black. The head is a relatively thick, beige mass of creamy bubbles that dissipates at a medium pace. The aroma is mostly chocolate malt with a hint of hops. It smells like creamy chocolate milk with a hint of beer, really. The roasted malt comes through smooth and creamy in the flavor. There are notes of coffee, chocolate, toasted bread and light hops. It's a very pleasant, easy drinking beer. There's a ton of flavor for the relatively low abv (at least as compared to the current spectrum of stouts). I really enjoy good English beer styles and I sincerely hope that American breweries start paying more attention to the lower alcohol, big, balanced flavors of this brewing tradition. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy, particularly for a bottled beer.","popery","Sep 09, 2009"

Body is lacking some creamy texture with great carbonation. Not bad overall but lacking in character.","Phyl21ca","Feb 14, 2009"
4.39,12.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"16.9 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a small off-white head. Not much head retention or lacing. The aroma is very nice, it smells like roasted malt, dark fruit, caramel, dark chocolate, coffee, and a bit of smoke. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, caramel, burnt/charred malt and a bit of hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's velvety and coating, and has a dry finish. Drinkability is pretty good, it wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these especially with the 4.8% ABV. It's smooth and easy to drink, it's quite sessionable. I think this is a good example of an English Stout, I'd definitely buy this again in the future. Recommended.","bluejacket74","Feb 07, 2009"

Their Double Stout was a beer I had looked for in various off-licenses and shops in the Oxford area, all in vain. Opening the bottle was to get a burst of roasted coffee aroma, once poured the roasted nature of the nose was dominant, suggesting a full flavour to come. The beer itself was pitch black with a loose off-white head. Coffee was also the major flavour in the beer, although smoothed out by a velvety chocolate.

Really light aromas. It's a stretch to get much out of the nose at all, but it does have some coffee and roast. Flavor is missing a lot of depth and complexity. A touch of roast, but overall, it has very muted flavors and aromas.","Crosling","Aug 22, 2008"
2.97,-24,3.5,4,2.5,3,2.5,"The mix between two different types of malts is an interesting experiment, and you can definitely taste the point where it changes from one type to another. Still, it doesn't completely work as a beer, and no matter how interesting it is, you still have to be able to drink it.","beabear","Jul 30, 2008"

3.67,-6.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"drinkability is good. this is a smooth and mellow stout with decent proportioning and a smooth profile. the brew plays off subtleties to create a deceptively complex profile under a curiously simple backbone. not one of the best, but a nice example of the style.","botham","Jul 04, 2008"
4.52,15.6,4,4.5,5,4,4,"500ml brown bottle from Ron's Market in Farmington. Pours a black body with ruby-red highlights and a quarter to half inch of very light tan head. Smells roasty, with caramel, nut and butter notes all very present. Tastes like chocolate, butter, nut, caramel. Flavors are each subtle, but together make a pleasant and tasty brew. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. This one is an easy drinker for sure, despite the rich flavor and moderate mouth-feel. Not sure what makes this a 'double' stout, but it's a phenomenal English stout, possibly the best I have had.","MrHurmateeowish","Jul 02, 2008"
4.2,7.4,4,4,4,4,5,"It has a nice medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is lightish. It finishes with a dark chocolate bitterness that doesn't go overboard. Nice. And so damn drinkable..hell....it's under 5%abv! Now, this is a sessionable Stout indeed! Too bad, yet again, that I only picked up one bottle but I hope to pick up more on my next visit. If they still have some. /me with my fingers crossed.","Bitterbill","Jul 01, 2008"
4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"16.9oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. The aroma is dark and slightly roasted malts with a good amount of chocolate and a touch of coffee. The taste is very smooth and creamy with a dark roastiness to start off and some slightly bitter coffee flavors coming along in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, Hook Norton Double Stout is a solid English style stout that is subtle but well crafted.","cjgator3","Jun 17, 2008"
4.3,10,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has dry, earthy, patent and roasted malt aroma. The taste is great. It has a tremendous black, chocolate, and roasted malt flavor that goes down with some sweetness, but finishes dry with an aggressive earthiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. These guys have the English beer styles down to a science. This is so flavorful, yet low in alcohol and highly drinkable. Hooray to the session beer!","WesWes","Jun 13, 2008"

4.8,22.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I loved this beer. Clean, crisp, satisfying. It just stunned me that it was only 4.8% ABV. A lesson for me really--I'm an intrepid lighter to darker, weaker to stronger session drinker, and this beer was so good with the meal I didn't need or want to continue with anything else. Stouts typically are dessert. This is an essential part of the meal. (steak and cheese, bread and chips and lettuce, if you must know.) I snuck a peek at their web site and gave them my rave directly. Goodness knows what they made of it--I e-mailed to Heritage at... No response yet.","justinhower","Apr 26, 2008"

Great overall malty flavor-ever slight smokiness. Very nice grain taste. Just a hint of hop bitterness. Great body. Really holds up well at only 4.8%. Just a great, great package.

Thin for a stout...closer to a porter and color wise would be a porter in America or Denmark. Very soft feel...low carbonation. Estery, but not off-putting it just likes any sort of bitterness. Its toasty, but falls well short of roasted flavor wise. Its like they toasted the most sugary sweet malts they could find. Just a hint of bitterness in the finish could save this one, but it is not there.","Jredner","Nov 24, 2006"
