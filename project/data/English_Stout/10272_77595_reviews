"Delicious beer!  One of the best whiskey aged beers I've drank."
""
""
""
"Much better than I thought. Subtle Oak and Jamesons flavor , not boozy at all for fairly high ABV. Very enjoyable. Couldn't see more than one,maybe 2  at a sitting. Great Offering from I&G"
""
""
"This is not a bad beer. I like sweet stouts, and the Irish whiskey aging added a slight complexity. I would definitely drink this again."
"Enjoy"
"Appearance is great.  Smell is off-putting.  Mouthfeel didn't help the beer at all.  Might be better on nitro or cask - who knows."
"Robust flavors, but very sweet"
""
""
""
""
"A real nice and light flavorful stout, perhaps a hair sweet, but nice and well made.  Coffee angle not very obvious to me as suggested by the makers, but still presents a solid experience."
""
""
""
"Pours very dark.  No noticeable highlights at the edges, just black.  Mocha colored head thins out to a wispy cap.  Smells of raisins, roasted malt, caramel, and a bit of alcohol heat.  Taste begins slightly sweet with a distinct caramel flavor.  Then moves to chocolate and roast with a mild oak and alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel and body is a little thin for the style and heat it brings.  Finishes somewhat sweet."

""
""
""

"D - Not bad. Best of the Innis and Gunn cask aged beer. Too sweet for me."
""
""
"On sight, Innis & Gunn Irish Whiskey Cask is a deep, dark brown that rests just short of black.  It ends up being complete opaque with no light getting through the body.  The nose has a hint of whiskey, pulling in hints of nuts, vanilla, sticky toffee, dates, cooked plums, espresso, and chocolate.  There’s a fruitiness to the elements of espresso, cigar, and chocolate.  On the palate it has a burned malt flavor, like caramel too long on the stove, but channels delicious notes of caramel, espresso, dates, and dark chocolate.  The mouthfeel is heavy thanks to the alcohol, but feels somewhat smooth, and doesn’t get hot.  The aftertaste is rather short, but channels that charred wood, smoke, espresso flavor combination with a hint of cacao powder."
"Not much here, its ok - but not much"
""
""
""
""
""
"It's fine. Tastes nice, looks nice, it's all good. Really reminded me of whiskey and cola and I don't like that, so I scored it a bit lower. There's nothing wrong with it, just not my thing."
""
""
""
""
"Very nice finish for a stout and the good news is that it is coming out of retirement. Should be available the second week of January."

"Overall – This is probably my favourite Stout. Shame it is only brewed in small batches which makes it hard to get in Northern Ireland, although that does make the pleasure of drinking it even greater as I always know it is a limited pleasure. My advice is purchase as much as you can when it is about and hide it away in the cellar for special occasions. On second thoughts it is probably a good job this is only brewed in small batches or I would move to Scotland and drink the lot before it left the yard. (But maybe that is just the Ulster Scots heritage talking.)"

"330ml bottle. Deep brown colour; tall, frothy, beige head which lasted well and left some nice lacing. Gentle aroma of whiskey, dark fruits, caramel and sweet malt. Gentle sweetness and a little bit of spice develops into a hint of bitterness. Light to medium palate and a suggestion of alcoholic warmth. Not aggressively assertive but pleasant and drinkable, nonetheless. Very similar to their rum offerings."
""

"Pretty good - a solid take on the style. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are rich with alcoholic whiskey and dark malt character. Body is a shade too thin. A decent brew; the only problem is that it comes across as over-polished (like many I&G beers). Could be enhanced by bottle conditioning, but I won't hold my breath. That said, it's worth sampling if you come across it."

"Pours very dark with a decent head. Smells pretty good. Smell a little hint of whiskey. Not overpowering. Tastes pretty good. Less stout than what I thought it would from the appearance. Just like the smell a little whiskey aftertaste. I like this beer. I would drink it again."

"O: Solid beer. Not my favorite of the style but still good."
""

"Overall: I bet this is outstanding on draft, would be a great St. Patty's Day brew. I just don't under stand the clear bottle on this one. Not a bad beer at all, just think it could be more."

"A very nice well balanced stout with a hint of whiskey in the background."
"o: An excellent variety of I&G cask aged brews. Their Rum Cask Aged is one of my top go-to's for flavor when I want beer that tastes like liquor. This one would not be very far behind, in fact might be ahead due to its silky mouthfeel."

"11.2 ounce bottle, stamp on it says BBE Dec 14. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. The head sticks around a while, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, Irish whiskey, and some dark fruit and coffee. It tastes like roasted malt, Irish whiskey, bittersweet chocolate, oak/wood, coffee, dark fruit (cherries), peat, and vanilla. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, it's not heavy on the Irish whiskey and I think it meshes well with the stout. I'd buy this again. $11.99 a 4-pack."
""
""

"Overall, I'm a bit underwhelmed by this beer and I can tell you it's certainly better experienced on tap. That said, you could do worse with an English brown ale (ahem, Newcastle)."
"Final Grade: 3.97, a B+. Innis & Gunn's Irish Whiskey Cask is definitely one of their tastier brews, and at $3.25 a bottle it's absolutely a better deal than many of their other rotating offerings (I'm looking at you, bottles-in-a-carton). I'm not sure I like this more than their flagship oaked ale, but I'd be happy with either one in my glass. Worth a look, at least - not the most complex wood-aged ale by any means, but a good, affordable tutorial to the style."
""
""
""
"Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""

"dark brown ruby red hue, dark head. smell has some faint whiskey but the flavor has a lot more. and it's smooth with a spicy note to balance the sweetness of whiskey. I enjoy it but A.) not sessionable for me and B.) needs innis glassware; regular pint glass threw off balance"

"Well done Innes & Gunn.."
""
""
""
"O - Not overly fussed. Its a refreshing style porter and I could drink more. However I was expecting a bit more concentration of flavours in the taste and a more viscous mouthfeel. Nice but not amazing."
"I love Innis and Gunn. It was the first beer I really liked and got me into good beer in the first place so I might be a little biased. The color is a very dark hazel with a coffee colored head that has some legs. The smell is toasty but you can smell a little of the wood too. The taste is great, everything I've come to love from Innis and Gunn. Smooth, rich, and just a fantastically crisp finish. Coats your mouth but doesn't leave a lingering aftertaste. Absolutely loved it and would definitely recommend."

"This one is easy to drink and terribly pleasant. Has long finish just like irish whiskey and hints at honey. The clear bottle did not do it any harm as far as I can tell but it is a seasonal so I bought it pretty early after it hit the shelf."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm an IPA guy, but this is an incredible stout. I might prefer it to be a little drier, but it is much easier to have a sub-5% beer be dry than a 7.4% beer. I would definitely choose this over Guiness though as it it everything a stout should be and has some great oak notes as well."
""
""
""
"taste is much MUCH better than I remember the others I tried tasting like. this is good! very stout-like. a little bit of chalkiness, some bitter chocolate, some bourbon/whiskey in the back, a little vanilla, and NOT thick and syrup-y like so many other stouts. barrel-aged or not.... a little too sweet for my preference, but I can see this being their flagship brew. wonder why it took so long for Total Wine to get this one??? maybe it's a testament to WHICH brews you allow to age in a barrel? the RUM barreled ones really sucked, I thought (which worries me about The Bruery's rum barrel Black Tuesdays coming out next month.... RUM??? does rum really go with beer????), but this one does good! but overall, this is the best one from this brewery yet."
"Overall Irish Whiskeys usually make me gag but this one aged in barrels is OK. Still I prefer cherry wood aged because I love sweetness."

"An interesting, unique, well-balanced, tasty brew. It grew on me quickly and I liked it more the more it progressed."

"Pitch black with small, tan head on top. There’s no retention at all and little to no lacing on the glass. Dark roasted malts, milk chocolate, coffee, substantial sweetness on the nose. I can’t seem to detect any whiskey barrel in the aroma, however. Taste is sweet maltiness up front with bittersweet chocolate. Now you can taste the whiskey, although it’s not as forward as I thought it might be. There are bitter malts at the end with a fairly sweet finish. The mouthfeel is smooth but not as creamy as I like in a stout. This is a decent barrel-aged stout, but I think it could’ve benefited with more time in the whiskey barrels."
""
""
"Overall -  One of the best products I've had from Innis & Gunn and I'm a pretty big fan. Great winter beer."
""
""
""
""

"I think Ill enjoy my next 3 bottles, and see if my tastes change for each one, but after that I doubt Ill buy it again or order it at the bar."

"Really well put together. The oak is very subtle in the beer and really only lends very faint background notes. It does integrate things nicely however. Wonderful balance and structure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: first whiskey cask-aged beer I have had, and it hasn't disappointed. A very nice stout thanks to Innis & Gunn, but I'm not sure there was enough difference or added flavour from the cask to warrant the high price tag, since it is over AU$130-140 a case (2013)."
""
""
"The taste has plenty of sweet malts going on with a slightly roasted feel too. Overall it is fairly easy to drink and predictable. But it does not jump out as anything out of the ordinary."
""
""
""
""
"Hard to believe that this was 7.40% ABV as I didn't feel woozy until I had nearly polished this off. I give these guys credit for pushing the envelope on what beer can be and for making me realize that for all that I've enjoyed over the years, that there's so much out there that I haven't tried and haven't had access to (such as this style). It almost reminded me of an Irish Dry Stout crossed with a Milk Stout but this was ""wetter"" and ""less sweet"" and most of all, completely unoffensive. I love what these guys are capable of!"

"O- Overall, this beer gets better and better as it warms in the glass so do not serve too cold."
""
""
""
""
""
"The ruby tints are very nice -- in a stout they make for quite a nice looking beer. Mouthfeel is a high note. Creamy feel despite having less body than the American stouts I'm used to. Taste is a bit high on alcohol, considering it's only 7.4, and the whiskey characteristics don't come through enough for me. The cherry, bitter chocolate, and toffee in the profile are enjoyable. Decent overall, but I wish the barrel added more to the flavor -- I feel the burn of whiskey but don't really taste it."
""
"O/D - A very good and interesting beer. A little bit filling and the alcohol is fairly high, but manageable. Not overly barrel flavored, just a nice compliment."
""
"This is an interesting stout. I don't believe I've every had a Scottish stout before, but I've certainly had my share of Irish whiskeys. And though the whiskey notes are light, I do like this beer. It is my second Innis & Gunn beer, and I've enjoyed both of them. If you are looking for a interesting European barrel-aged beer, I'd go looking for this one."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a medium dirty brown color head with medium retention and light lacing notes. Aroma is dominated by sweet caramelized notes with light whiskey notes. Taste is also dominated by sweet caramelized notes with a light whiskey touch which kind of round of the edges of the beer. Body is light with medium creamy texture and good carbonation. A bit of a lighter profile then I had expected with not as much whiskey notes as expected."
"Overall: This beer is good. Found this beer out last weekend and happy yo have scored a bottle. Will be enjoying more of thus in the future."
"O: a good beer that really opens up as it gets warmer and the flavors from the casks become much more prominent."
"O: A solid dry Irish stout base makes for a solid choice to go in Irish whiskey barrels. Definitely has more flavor than most dry Irish stouts, and the barrel adds another nice dimension. A solid choice for an intro to BA beers, as it doesn't impart too much booziness but the flavors are still there. Solid beer"
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, and some woody aromas. There is also a slight metallic aroma that comes out more as the beer warms. Taste is much the same with cocoa, vanilla, and woody flavors on the finish. A smoke flavor comes out as the beer warms up. There is a vanilla sweetness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I am not really getting any distinct whiskey aromas or flavors from this one."
"A clear extra dark cola with a healthy dollop of lace on top and clinging to the sides. No real activity. Smell is sweet with mild molasses and malt. A faint whiskey presence. Coffee, coaco and bread. Taste is much the same with a smooth character that harkens back to the porter roots of an English stout. Lots of molasses and malt. Finish is mildly bitter with a hint of whiskey that gives a mild oak and vanilla flourish. Feel is on the lighter side with a crisp, mild carbonation. A good easy drinking brew. Not earth shaking but solid and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a really nice stout. I've been underwhelmed by their Original scotch ale and did not like their rum cask wee heavy, but I liked this one a lot. Lots of chocolate and vanilla to it and easy to drink. No real whiskey to it, but it's still good. Would like to have it again."
""
"Overall, one of the better beers I have had from this brewery although it is still fairly lackluster. It is a decent stout but definitely not worth the steep price tag."
""
""
""
""
"O - Another hit from Innis & Gunn, solid flavour profile with a huge smoke and peaty notes. Definitely a worthy brew and glad to have had a chance to try it."
""
""
"I fail to see the connection between this beer and Irish whiskey and, aside from the former spending 60 days in casks that formerly held the latter, there is indeed no connection. Innis & Gunn doesn't reveal the source of their casks. There's a tremendous difference in flavour and quality between an Irish whiskey like Bushmills and, say, Redbreast (let alone the age of those casks and their former contents). Whatever was actually used, I recommend switching it up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Essentially just an average stout buffed up a bit with a nice touch of whiskey. Drinkable."
"An overall good Irish whiskey cask. It's a dark beer that lacks the full bodied taste and texture. If you are looking for a sweet after taste, this one is good for you. A pleasant beer, but not a ""knock your socks off"" beer. I'd order it again for a light bodied and flavored dark beer. Probably a good option for a summer day."

"From a clear bottle, this beer is nicely attractive. Dark, with a velvet tan head and a lot of lace. The smell is intreguing. Roasted grain, wood and charcoal, a bit of smoke. Sweet malt. The taste is sweeter than expected, and the mouthfeel is soft. It is certainly an English stout. Rounded, welcoming, and tasty. All n all, this is quite good."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a flavorful stout worth drinking for while."
"O: This beer is a deft balancing act. Malt, hop, and barrel all complement each other nicely and yield a product that is perhaps more drinkable than expected. It's the kind of beer that speaks softly, but has a lot to say."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
"O: This is a great stout and dangerous because the 7.4% alcohol is not noticeable through the flavours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It was good, I feel like it would have benefitted from a bit of a heavier mouthfeel though."
""
""
""
"Medium body, wish it was a bit fuller. Soft carbonation helps things out. Alcohol is well hidden. Simple beer, with a hint of complexity. I enjoy these beers from I&G very much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Innis and Gunn Irish Whiskey Cask pours a dark brown with a small head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is full of sweet malt from the whiskey cask, along with a bit of roast and chocolate from the stout. The aroma is a little poorly integrated, but the taste makes up for it with smooth oak and whiskey tones over a generic, yet solid English stout dry roast. The mouthfeel is light for the style and gently carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, this is another solid beer from Innis and Gunn. They seem to have a thing going on where they make complex yet delicate sipping beers. I'm all for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good brew, well balanced, I think a little more whiskey flavor would have made this a little more tastier."
""
""
"Overall: a great stout, and the cask ageing seems to have a legitimate and enjoyable impact on flavour"
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, a really refreshing flavorful beer.. not much like a stout, but the carbonation makes it perfect for a hot day."
""
""
"O- This beer is mellow and light with some faint notes of barrel, but it doesn't have much character. Drinkable but light."
""
""
""
"Could use more carbonation. Body feels watery for this type of beer."
""
""
"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a good example of a barrel aged English Stout, it had some nice Irish Whiskey aspects and some nice English Stout aspects, neither of them were overpowering which made for some nice balance in this beer. This beer had good drinkability, it went down smoother then I expected, I could see drinking one or two of these, the flavors does a good job of holding my interest, I wouldn't turn down another one right now. What I liked most about this beer was the balance and how good it looked in my snifter, those aspects were for sure above average. What I liked least about this beer was the clear bottle and that it had a little too much sweetness, but those aspects didn't hurt this beer that much. I would buy this beer again, it was priced nicely and you don't normally see Irish Whiskey aged beers, I highly recommend giving this beer a try, it's damn good. I'm starting to get into this brewery, I thought their rum beer was solid, but this one was better and nicely balanced, it showcases the best of both worlds. You can bet I will be on the look out for their original and other beers, all in all this was a pretty good beer that managed to impress me, I approve."
""
""
""
""
"I'm glad I picked this up to try, I really enjoy the Rum cask and original Oak aged varieties and while this one wasn't bad, it was certainly my least favorite so far."
""
"D - Not bad, this is the best of the Innis and Gunn cask aged beer that I've had (I have been unimpressed with the others so far). The base beer is a nicely brewed English stout and the whiskey notes are very subtle but do seem to add something to the experience."
"Overall: incredibly smooth, nice flavor and very drinkable for the style."
""
""
"Served in an English Pint Glass, poured a very dark reddish coffee colour with a thin head, stained a toffee colour. Head dissipates quickly, except for where it lingers around the edges. The whiskey is most prominent on the nose and finish, giving it just a hint of sweetness. Very malty flavour that develops a little bit as it warms up, heavy caramels. A good showing."
"D - Yet another swing and a miss by I&G. All of their beers taste the same, with the exact same god damn cloying butterscotch sweetness. I though their take on a stout might be a bit different, maybe even better, but this is still unmistakably Innis & Gunn, and to me that's not a good thing."
"Black body with a dense mocha head. Thin retention but thick lacing. Nose has chocolate, roasted coffee, a heavy dose of sweet oak, irish cream liqueur, caramel and vanilla. Taste is sweet and oaky, a touch of whiskey and butterscotch (in a typical Innis and Gunn fashion). Light roastiness, and a Bailey's liqueur-like flavour. Body is disappointingly thin and watery, low carbonation. Some good ideas here, but everything doesn't seem to come together the way I'd like it to."
""
""
"O - big up for getting really 'Mc' on this one, some of the big irish stout properties combined with big irish whiskey, although in some ways it seems like they just poured the two into the bottle, well worth a try but not my favourite I&G offering"
""
"LCBO seasonal. A different Innis & Gunn, on the creamy side, a decent stout at that, with Baker's chocolate and a better thana verage Irish whiskey and leaning on the sweet side for drinkability. Roasty aroma, an mild roasted coffee bordering on straight out roasted barley/coffee substitute. One of their better ones. Very dark bodied."
"Overall I am not impressed. Don't think I'll be purchasing this one again."
"This one really works, one of the best I've had from I&G. It seems that the oak aging process compliments the dark roasted flavors quite well."
""
""
"To my palate the whiskey barrel aging doesn't seem to add too much to the stout overall, however it certainly does add an extra layer to what's going on. Not a bad beer by any means, however it seems more like an experiment than something that was intentional when it comes to a final result."
"I've never seen a beer so opaque before. The head is also very dark and leaves very nice lacing. The smell isn't very complex, but its still good - molasses, bread, and that ever-so-faint whiskey quality. The taste, however, is a step above because the whiskey really shines through. It almost overpowers the other flavours of molasses and malts. It's a little on the sweet side - not very well balanced I'd say. Very creamy, very drinkable. It it wasn't so expensive I'd buy this again."
""
""
""
"Overall - An enjoyable English stout by Innis & Gunn. Excellent roasted qualities in both aroma and flavour. Wished there was a bit more oak and whiskey flavour from the barrel, but that is personal preference."
""
"Pours a dark, cola brown with some garnet highlights and a bit of creamy tan head. Aroma of sweet dark malt and a sweet, slightly oaky tinge of Irish whisky. Palate is huge on malt, a blend of biscuit and sweet bread. There's no real hop character to speak of, but the oak and whisky from the barrel shine through pretty well. The alcohol is well-integrated, I'd never guess that this is 7.4% ABV. I suppose there could be a little more whisky here, but it's a solid beer, for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown colour, one finger of tan head with a good amount of lace. Smell is of roasted malt, both dark and milk chocolate, vanilla, whiskey notes though I wouldn't say specifically Irish whiskey, oak barrel scents, light coffee followed by more milk chocolate. Taste is quite roasted up front, bittersweet notes of chocolate and coffee, oak is subtle at first and eventually becomes more pronounced towards the finish, some whisky flavours but not as overpowering as some other offers from this brewer, vanilla and chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is quite thin and a touch watery, light-med carb, light feel. This was fairly nice and would have been far better if it had a little more body, one of the few I&G beers I haven't found to be over oaked."
"O - Another interesting brew from Innis and Gunn which was a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting a stout (did not read the bottle)."
""
"T - While this was decent enough, considering the style and the price point ($5 for 12 oz.) it was extremely disappointing. This might be my last purchase of an Innis & Gunn beer."
""
"I do quite like this, even though my prized Irish whiskey guest star gets lost in the mire - or does it? The subtly of this particular spirit may just help round out an already decent, unassuming stout. Reduction is not your friend with this one, I'm sad to say - just maybe rein in the sweetness a wee bit, and we're good to go."
"O - Good beer, but the whiskey and other elements don't really seem to come together very well."
"If you were hoping for an Irish Car Bomb, forget it. And although this sounds like a marriage made in heaven, it's not. In fact, there should be a divorce."
"worth a try for sure at less then 5$, I like that they use a darker beer for this barrel I think that was a wise move"
""
"One of the better I&G, was not ruined by the oak."

"Overall and interesting brew. Not good for every day but a nice change of pace."

"the feel is pretty smooth, but does include some whiskey character; there is that little kick at the end. The tingle is almost gone, which is kind of nice."
""
"O- Two thumbs up. It is an all around enjoyable experience, and it exceeded my expectations. My only regret was buying 4 of them. I will definitely be going back to pick up more."
"Overall: A very enjoyable and well-balanced stout."
"Overall-- this is better than its rated. I hope they do it again. I'd buy some."
"O- Very easy to drink for a barrel aged offering without skimping on flavor. Thumbs up."
"-Overall 4.0: While I complained about the carbonation in this stout, it is still an excellent stout that all fans of the style should seek out. The taste is excellent and I would heartily recommend this beer."

"12oz bottle, why clear? I was very worried about light stricken beer; glad this one was ok. Poured into my Innis & Gunn tulip glass, the ale is near black with some ruby at the edges of the glass when held to a light. Huge beige head leaves some great lacing on the glass and holds good retention. This was nice to look at. Aromas are Irish whiskey up front with some roasted malt and oak. Tastes are roasted and smoked malt with a nice dose of Irish whiskey and oak with some vanilla notes, followed by an astringent balsamic vinegar finish. Mouth-feel is smooth with appropriate carbonation and is medium bodied. Overall, the best offering from Innis & Gunn that I've had to this point. Nice one to have leading up to St. Patrick's Day. I might have to get another for the actual day."
"Overall a stout that I'm pleased I tried. The taste of the Irish whiskey is so very keen, concise and perfectly placed. I have to admit, I tended to believe this was some sort of novelty 'oak aged' beer hype. But now that I've had the opportunity to taste how original and honest this stout is, I will be purchasing a 4-pack (or more for next week) St. Patty's day. Bell's Expedition Stout still sits atop this holiday's choice list though."
"O: Overall, this is a good scotch ale under the stout name. I could definitely enjoy this again and I have passed this up many times when I have seen it in the past. The barrel aging is present, but not prominent and while they do add character, this is more of an English cask version of a scotch ale than an Americanized version."
""
"O: I don't know why I keep buying these beers - acing a beer in a whisky/whiskey is NOT a good idea - the oak gives it an artificial detergent like backbone . I wish they kept the time in the barrels were kept shorter, sonce the only bad thibg about this beer is the whiskey."
""
""
"O- Quite impressed with this one. Far from the usual Innis and Gunn formula. Good job!"
""
"Pretty good, not as rich or roasty as many stouts but that is a good thing here. Some fruit and malt complexities shine through with oak."
""
"Thanks to NewBrewBB for the opportunity to try this one. Served in a tulip nonic. Pours a shade darker than cola with a half-inch, frothy, tan-colored head that settles into a bubbly band and a thin film. Some thin spots and swaths of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose expresses lactose and/or artificial sweetener, malt and ethanol with just the slightest suggestion of a whiskey character. Taste is more consistent with a Dark Mild/Porter hybrid with a suggestion of booze in the background than an English Stout. A residual wheaty/grainy quality lingers at the finish. I'm also not sure where the barrel comes into play. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a light, even carbonation the leaves a residual tickle at the back of the tongue. Overall, not a bad beer but nothing to write home about. Alcohol is well-hidden, but the overall character is a bit lackluster."

"Overall could have been more as a new addition to the brewery. I think we are spoiled in America with all of our oak aged imperial stouts so this seems weak. Drinkable but a little expensive and I would prefer other beers from Innis & Gunn."
"M/O - Medium to heavy body with good carbonation, despite the bubble size. Easy to drink and the style and aging compliment each other well (it does have 2 of the 3 ingredients in a irish car bomb, haha). Perfect night cap beer IMO or just an every day beer if you're in the mood for something different."

"Overall interesting, pretty tasty, a bit hot and boozy for only 7.4%, nice barrel and various whisky flavors, decent malts but not anywhere near what I would call stout, even the appearance tells you that."
"Edit: LOL! Gave the same ratings EXACTLY as the person below me!"

"M: a bit watery in taste, dry and chalky"
"This was a smooth, easy-to-drink beer. Very enjoyable."

"12 oz. bottle: This one pours an opaque, very dark brown color. There was a bit of a frothy tan head on it that leaves some lacing. Malts and oak are the predominate aromas. Slight whiff of whiskey also. Maybe some roastiness also. The taste is good. Caramel and toffee malts, slight roast, A very subdued peaty whiskey flavor. Just a bit sweet: lots of hops in here to balance this one. Very nice!"

"I would say this is more tolerable than the last example I had from this brewery. They have an interesting niche but they really should switch to darker bottles in order to preserve the integrity of their beers."

"One of my favorite whiskey cask aged beers. It's between a sipper and an easy drinker, which for a cask aged beer is impressive. Not hardly sweet at all, which is great."

"Overall this is a fairly complex and moderately sweet stout, with a solid marriage of complimentary smells and flavors."
"A very good solid stout. Highly recommend."
"O: Not a bad beer. I was excited at the irish whiskey barrel aging, but I'm guessing it was very brief since I don't really detect any whiskey notes. There's just a bit of vanilla and oak but that's it. Flavor is good up front but there's a bit of an odd ash in the aftertaste that detracts and prevents it from getting higher scores."
""
"Not the most enjoyable of this brewery. Above average, unique, and interesting. Missing body. Out of style."
"An interesting beer. I don't know that I'm inclined to buy it again, but it's worth trying."
"Overall: It's decent and it's drinkable, but that's all I have to say about it."

"Decent Irish whiskey aroma. Color is black with a very nice tan head. The taste has light roasted malts, chocolate, light oak, very light vanilla bean and very subtle whiskey flavor. Has hints of vanilla with a faint sweetness taste. Finish is smooth and clean. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
""
"O- By far, one the better whiskey stouts I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Definitely a beer that can be enjoyed many times over. I can't wait for my next round!"
"Overall- I like this, and I would definitely buy this again if I saw it. It's nothing earth shattering, but it is easy to drink and very dangerous at 7%."
"Sweet and buttery, a slight roast in the aftertaste, but wouldn't have guessed it was a stout straightaway. Some astringency, possibly from the barrel. Slightly drying aftertaste, mild roastiness, hard to pinpoint the oak here though. There is some diacetyl, and traces of the base stout, but its a bit muddled and sweet, like the rest of their output i've tried. Not bad, but not unique enough to seek out over local stuff."
"The carbonation is light with lots of small smooth bubbles. The liquid is smooth."
"well. its a decent beer. I don't quite see this being a go-to though."
"Mostly none existent nose, touch of irish sweetness, but looks great, black, creamy head. Taste is smooth, no barrel though, Irish whiskey sweetness, malolactic? Vanilla extract. Touch of roast. Every thing is very light and smooth, given Irish whiskey is light and smooth, but I hoped for a bit more, if it was a six pack for the same price I could drink it easily, but a four pack is a touch too much for the easy drinker this is."
"overall: A very easy drinker. Smooth and ""quaffable""."
""
"O- I've thoroughly enjoyed my first sampling of Innis & Gunn's offerings, and am excited to try the next. The Irish Whiskey Cask stout is a spectacularly crafted contribution to the family of whiskey barrel-aged stouts, being uniquely modest in price and form."
""
"O- rwally nice, and extremely unique. Now, if I only they would put this in brown bottles."
"Overall: well crafted and incredibly well put together. This isn't the best thing to happen to beer but best thing to happen to some stouts. Finally something out there to make you think twice when ordering a ""dark"" beer, Salud!"
"Noticeable Irish whiskey aroma. Black with a light half inch tan head. Has that whiskey warming mouth feel to it. Finishes clean. Mild vanilla taste with a faint fruit taste also. I'm really liking this one. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I wish I had got more than one bottle."

"A stout from I&G, aged for two months in Irish whiskey casks? Yes, please! It pours a dark ruby-black-brown topped by a relatively small wisp of light tan foam. The nose comprises blunt roasted malts, light char, very light whiskey, light dark-roasted coffee, and a touch of dark chocolate powder. The taste holds notes of light roasted malts, cocoa powder, light oak, very light vanilla bean, very light whiskey (melds deeply with the oak), and a hint of coffee. Everything comes through lightly, layered, and with I&G's signature subtlety of flavor combination. That said, it seems like it should have a more powerful taste, somehow... The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice beer, one that comes across as somehow both complex and simple, but enjoyable nonetheless."
