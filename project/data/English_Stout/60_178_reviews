"Is this a real thing? Did I miss the memo? It's malted chocolate soda. It's interesting though."
"There are some good aromas and flavors here. Unfortunately, there are some notable issues with the mouthfeel. Dry and roasty, yet fizzy and seltzer-like. Not bad, but far from great."

"O-A nice beer, as it warms it doesn't seem to improve which I found odd for a stout."

"Nothing special and I will probably never try this beer again."

"This stout is easy drinking and enjoyable with a burger. I would imagine it would be just as good with a steak. With such low alcohol, one could easily drink several in an afternoon."

"Overall: This one just doesn't do it for me"
"Mouthfeel was medium which was the biggest bummer of all from this brew. When drinking a stout I don't want to sense any watery-ness to it. Unfortunately, this was. It wasn't bad, just basic, and I wouldn't have had more than a sample."
"The flavor is closer to dry. The body is quite thin for the style and the very high carbonation exasperates this feature. Short aftertaste of weak coffee."
"O: Had some of the right flavor components, and while I applaud CBC for making a nice simple stout, but I would have liked a bit more."
"The CPJ"
"An ok stout, but not quite as good as the porter. Poured heavy, dark brown to black, with some head. Aroma was of malts and slightly stale coffee, and the taste was similar. Not too potent in the taste department. Medium mouthfeel...not necessarily watery, but not quite what I look for in a stout."
"Drinkability is good. Decent tasting beer that is quite easy to drink."
"D-Solid and well constructed yet, simple, unassuming and easy to drink. This is the type of beer you could have around and use as your ""go to"" stout."
"Overall, an interesting stout with a bevy of interesting flavors. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: Would not buy again."
"Drinkability: At 4.6%, this is highly flavorful and pretty damn sessionable, especially as fall is upon us. One of Cooperstown's best, if not the best. I'll be picking up a case of this as soon as I can."
"The mouthfeel and odd taste issues give this brew a less than desirable drinkability, I'm afraid. It wasn't a drain pour for me, but polishing it off got a bit difficult at the end. Strike Out Stout starts off promising like a 3-0 count, but whiffs on some high cheese and off-speed stuff before finally getting punched out looking."
"Presented in a standard pint glass, this beer required a couple minutes to settle due to an extremely foamy head. After settling to a more manageable head it quickly dissipated with no lacing. Pitch black, even in the light. The nose is very subtle. Some barely malt comes through with a healthy dose of alcohol esters. Taste is malty to start, but very thin. The body leaves one wanting more. Dry finish with an almost soda-like feel. Despite the lack of body, this beer is rather drinkable. I could see myself drinking these in the backyard on a summer day simply because it's so light."
"D- english stouts arnt the style im most familiar with, so take the above review with a grain of salt. that being said, this was a sessionable beer with more flavor than many other beers of this strength. if i had this constantly available to me, i could see myself drinking this pretty often."
"On a side note...awesome cap!"
"Tea sour and sweet tobacco up front followed by a sensationally pleasing roast milk chocolate and herbal lemon hop in back. Like the back not so good from the front."
"Notes: This is just a good solid stout."
"With all the heavy, hoppy stouts being brewed by American craft brewers, it is refreshing to find a brewery who if emphasizing drinkability. Not that I mind other craft beers (at all!), but this stout is dark, dry, and roasty with light/medium body and nicely balance hop bitterness. This is not the stout I'd expect to win a competition, but it is a stout I'd like to drink several of."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no obvious lot code or expiration date. Sampled on October 6, 2009. The pour is dark brown with an explosve foamy, frothy tan head that seems to take forever to simmer down. The aroma comes off with a mix of roasted chocoalte malts and some mild hops in the background. The mouthfeel is sharp but medium with a lot of carbonation on the tongue. The taste has a roasted, chocolate malts and mild hops combo with a little bit of sugar to sweeten the punch. But with all the sweetness at the start there is a kind of sour finish. This is a well done, easy to drink stout."
"The feel is somewhat ashy on the palate, but then smooth. Thin-bodied for a stout, but milky. The beer overall is lots of chocolate, and a little sweet berry. A pretty decent sweet stout."
"Drinkability: The mouthfeel mars what would otherwise be a decent, though not complex, stout"
"D - Very much so, a couple in a sitting is nice."
"I had this beer a month ago (didnt review it) and it was a very decent stout. Maybe I happened to get a bad one."
"Not close to the top stouts I've encountered."
"D Suffers from heavy mouthfeel and fullness in terms of drinkability. This is a great stout."
"Overall, this is a decent example of the style but nothing too extraordinary. Fun stuff, though and I would recommend."
"Extremely drinkable and tasty."
"MF&D - Not a bad beer, but a little too thin. I also like my stouts a little less carbonated. Definitely worth checking out."
"pours a dark brown bordering on black the tan head fades quickly but leaves a spring of effervesence making me think it might be alive. the aroma is slightly sweet not only due to the malt, which provides a nice chocolatey earthy aroma, but there's a bit of fruit ester as well. the taste is nice and earthy the malts come through well with a dry finish and plenty of carbonation."
"This poured pitch black with lots of bubbly tan head. It smelled like alcohol, raisins, and heavily roasted mocha. It tasted quite dry, like very dark and bitter chocolate with roasted coffee malt. It was fairly thin and very carbonated, with a mild coffee aftertaste. Overall this was not a good stout. There was no distinguishing character to it, and it was too thin. And like all of the Cooperstown beers, it had way too much head and carbonation. Their beers struggle to conceil the alcohol scent/flavor, and this stout was the only one without the lemon hops scent (thank goodness)."
"This beer is fairly light feeling for a stout but it is definitely not lacking in flavor."
"Poured black as night with a minimal 1/4 inch tan/brown head. This one let absolutely no light through. The smell was a nice nutty coffee mix with hints of dark chocolate. The taste was on par with the smell, starting off nutty and bitter with definite hints of coffee, cocoa, and toffee. Definite roasty malt character as well. The mouthfeel was not what I hoped for. Not much substance for a stout. A little too watery. Decent carb and nice aftertaste. Solid stout and definitely worth a try."
"D - Not the best I've had. Very in your face with a tannic? astringency and dryness that is very puckery. Kinda harsh."
"Drinkability: Not a very good stout. The combination of the carbonation and the odd sourness takes away any of the good things this beer may have had to offer."
"Strike Three: Gas, not Nolan Ryan's fastball, but good old carbon dioxide. This made it undrinkable. It was just plain gassy."
"I don't know what happened with this guy. I'm not sure if I got a bad bottle or if the funky nature of this Stout just doesn't agree with me but it was one of the few times that I've drain-poured a beer. This guy will definitely be up for a re-review at some point down the line."
"Pours a nice black color with LOTS of brown and tan head, much like a rootbeer float, but there's too much head and it takes several pours and waits to empty the bottle, good retention, spotty lacing. Smells are very roasted and smokey, with hints of chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Taste matches the smell, there is some chocolate and coffee flavors, but it's overly roasty with a smoky finish. Light in body for a stout, very high in carbonation. Too much roasted malt and carbonation for my liking, not very balanced."
"The beer poured a dark inky opaque black with a huge dark tan head. The beer smells of roasted malts with maybe just a subtle hint of coffee. The taste has a very large roasted malts characteristic to it starting off with a tiny bit of bittersweet chocolate, with almost a smoky finish. The mouthfeel is crisp with more carbonation than I expected. I would consider this to be extremely drinkable for a stout, and I could probably put back two or three without any problems. Not a bad little beer, I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up picking up some more in the future."
"Poured coffee black into a nonic. Complete with a half inch of brown foam that quickly disappeared. The aroma was what you'd expect of a stout; roasted malts. The taste was bitter and smoked, almost ashen. Some malty sweetness shined through at the end. This was a thick brew. A decent stout. Nothing too different, nothing too special but definitely drinkable."
"Pours an almost onyx black with a huge three finger thin tan head that slowly dies down to a frothy layer. Stickiness decent, nothing to go crazy over. Smell, well it has the typical Cooperstown ringwood yeast aroma up front with a roasted nutty like scent. Some caramel malt and chocolate in the nose as well. Taste begins with a smokey oak flavor on the tongue followed by fresh espresso. Lots of nutty flavors and toasted barley all the way through to the finish. Aftertaste is a smokey chocolate malt, not bad. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a solid carbonation. Not a bad beer at all. I was surprised the ringwood flavors weren't as present as the smell would lead you to believe. Solid stout offered by Cooperstown."
"Really not a bad beer, not ""flavor overload"" like some really complex stouts, but still a solid offering."
"Poured dark from the bottle with a light brown head, two fingers. Good spotty lacing. Smells of chocolate biscotti. Taste of rich dark chocolate, roast malt with a dry mouthfeel that makes me think of brazil nuts. Bitter finish. I found this very drinkable, not overly complex, but certainly has flavour ... a real delight with a certain lightness for the style."
"While many American brewers load up the malts, jack up the alcohol, and have kicked the stout up a few notches, Cooperstown keep their Strike Out Stout to more traditional means. For that reason it's largely unexciting in comparison, but that can't be held against it. All aspects considered this is a fine, rather sessionable stout."
"Pours black with a tannish carmel colored head. Aromas of caramel and a roasty malt presence. Tastes of the same, small amount of caramel, roasty malt and a chocolate presence. Light in the body with a clean end. It has a very nice flavor, for a lighter body."
"M&D - smooth, and light bodied, a pretty good stout, definitely of the english variety, you can fell it in the body, not too thick and a mellow rounded flavor, but still a quality brew that upholds the Cooperstown reputation"
"A truly great beer. I wish I lived closer so that this beer was easier to get."
"Pours the darkest of browns. One finger plus tan head, that did not disappear. Good lacing. Smell is weak, roasted coffee,and chocolate mostly. Body is thin with some carbionation.Taste is dry, and roasted, with almost a burnt chocolate aftertaste. I wouldn't go out of my way."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is light. The beer has a prickly carbonation. I let the beer warm to room temperature and it really didnt improve much. This beer met the sink after a half pint."
"Very good stout. Pours a dark black with slight red touches around the edges. The smell is delicious -- malts and a sweet chocolate coming through. The taste echos the smell. A little bitter, but very easy to drink. Fair amount of lacing on the glass. Just a really enjoyable beer."
"D: This is a nice, dry stout, and it's nice to see you can get a big, roasty stout at 4.6% abv; reaching for the Imperials all the time is a bit draining on the wallet. Along with the Benchwarmer Porter, I now have two favorites from this brewery."
"Poured a near jet black but there was a touch of redish hue when in the light a thinner off white head on top that left no lace as it settled quickly.Highly roasted aromas of espresso roast coffee and unsweetened chocolate,this is one dry ass stout roasted to the hilt and quite earthy almost to much so dark roast coffee and cola flavors with dry woody-like finish.If you like ultra dry stouts this is for you I would have liked a touch of sweetness but this has some nice qualities to it."
"Another enjoyable beer from the Cooperstown collection."
"Drinkability: Not my first choice for a stout, this beer is still a decent representative."
"Aroma is mildly roasty, heavier on chocolate and has a very off warm plastic tinge to it. Body is black with a quickly diminishing two finger thick mocha head. This is one of the faster vanishing heads (of this size) I have ever seen. Nice roastey fore that is mildly bitter and a touch thin for a stout. Has some very faint coffee and chocllate notes, but is mostly dominated by the roasted malt flavors. It tastes pretty good actually just doesnt go anywhere really-like an akward kid dancing in one spot afraid to move his legs. The finish is very watery even for a sweet stout and that really kills the feel of the beer style wise, but flavor wise its okish."
"D: A drinkable beer, but there are others out there that are a bit more full bodied. Very low abv allows this to somewhat be a session beer if you've got a bunch of them. Would like to see it on tap if possible."
"This fine brew pours a dark color from the growler. There was a descent sized head which lasted for a short period. The smell is good, being a mixture of roasted malt with chocolate under tones. The taste is pleasant, with nice roasted malts and a nice bitter bite. The mouthfeel is a bit watery. This is a good stout. While I wouldn't run out to buy this when there are so many alternatives out there, I certainly would not pass this up as an offering on tap, or if the choices are limited."
"a note on the brewery.. if you are going to make baseball centric brews... why not have some history on the bottles promoting the game etc... it strikes me (pun) as odd that there is no such effort on the bottles..."
"Drinkability: the mouthfeel brings this category down a notch, and this is an overall average english stout."
"Beers!"
"Beer is good. Happy traded beering."
"Thanks Kevin!"
"Not a beer for a long session or sunny day at the beach but definitely a highly drinkable stout."
"This is an easy going beer that goes down smooth. Its much better than I remember it being."
"Very drinkable. Im not a big stout fan, but this one went down real easy."
"Subtle coffee, & dry roast grain. Hints of fruit come & go. Pretty one dimensional in the flavour department. Medium bodied, easy carbonation. Not all that interesting."
"Pretty standard off the rack stout look to this beer, with almost as much head as there would be beer if you could fit the whole thing into a glass in one pour. The smell is also fairly standard, with a nice light and sharp malt backbone with chocolates and coffees over the top of that. It's much lighter, and far sharper than some stouts I've had, and I'd say the smell is a bit weak overall. The taste as well, pretty straight forward, malts, hops with a good deal of burnt chocolate and roast coffee beans in it. The mouthfeel is very light and almost fluffy in some way, because of the large amount of carbonation. This beer is nice and simple, nothing astounding, but definately something good to drink."
"Pours an almost jet black with very little head but decent lace. Smells of an average stout, a nice roasted malt with some coffee and chocolate notes. Taste again of an average stout although more roasted maltiness than hop bitterness. High carbonation. A slightly better than average stout. Had qualities more of a porter than a stout, but a good brew."
"This is a jet black beer with only brown highlights at best when held up to the light. It has a good brown head. The aroma is a bold roasted maltyness with a hint of something sweet in the background. The same roasted malt is in full charge of the taste with a little molasses sweetness just before the clean dry finish."
"Aroma is rich and chocolatey sweetness mixed with some roasted malt qualities. No real hop presence. First sip reveals a thick viscous bodywith mild rolling carbonation. Flavor is as advertised by thenose. Chocolate, some coffee and roastiness abound. There is a rather coating quality of the beer on my tongue, which I find pleasant. Very smooth and easy to drink. QUite a tasty brew I think."
"Cheers to McCall for this excellent NY Stout."
"Wyll-"
"Mouthfeel is godawful. Huge carbonation and thin body with dirty bitter finish. STRIKE THREE, YOU""RE OUT!"
"Overall, a solid stout. Big thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the bottle!"
"Courtesy of Kahn's in Indy. This beer is nearly opaque and almost black with a medium thick dark brown head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is roasted coffee and some malt. Medium to rich body, with a sweet character here and there. Roasted coffee, malt and some hops in the flavor. The finish thins out a bit and is only mildly sweet, but this is still a fairly good Stout."
"Burnt malt, coco, vinuous alcoholic raisins in the aroma. Giant, active, dark hazelnut colored head left some decent lace. Dark opaque brown colored beer with the slightest ruby hue around the bottom edge of the glass. A light bodied beer with lots of carbonation keeps the flavor from touching the tongue. I swear this is an oatmeal stout, it's got that oat flavor and there's something about the aftertaste it leaves. The flavor is light, some bitter coffee, a pinch of coco, and a little dark wine. Reminds me a lot of the oatmeal stout I homebrewed, which I didn't think turned out all that well."
"Pours dark brown, almost black with a thick, very thick and frothy tan head. Very reminicent of a root beer. The aroma is dominated by caramel and a bit of a musty aroma. I also sence fruit. The taste isof caramel and in my opinion, not a very good example of a stout."
"This 12oz. amber bottle offering from Cooperstown poured a spectacular inky blackness with a noisy, rocky and frothy tan-colored head that eventually settled down to a finger-thin level. Very nice patchy lacing of the glass. Aromas are hard to pick up. Soft aromas of brewed coffe and sweet chocolate. Flavor falls short for the style. It just tasted like all of the ""oomph!"" had been taken out of this beer. Firm toasty base with cooking fire smokiness layered on top. Dark chocolate is also noted, but again, it's not doing much to make its case. Finishes with a sweet dryness that borders on puckering. Mouthfeel is definitely on the thin side, with a low-medium carbonation. Drinkability is tolerable, but nothing to write home about."
"Poured with a very large, lingering, easy-to-revive tan head and deep, impenetrable dark body. Clean Three Muskateers-like chocolate aroma and Starbucks lattes. Pretty milky and far more soft than I'd have expected after I got into the flavors. Dominated by a roasted, coffee bean-like flavor. The roasted grains really drive the flavor of this beer. No tremendous hop presence here, but that works in the beer's favor. Smooth and delicate despite the foundation of the flavors lying in that potent roasted flavor. A bit milky. Definitely lively. Very, very good."
"The taste. A lot of fizz but very little bang. Weak on flavor , strong on bubbles. Mild coffee and dark malt. Perhaps I got a bad batch but this is just horrid."
"Pours a deep black syrup with a very creamy mocha head. The aroma is heavily smoky with a distinct chocolate presence. The body is a bit sharp with smoke overtones and hints of black malt. The bitterness is moderate with a bit of hop spice in the finish. Like the porter, could us a bit more stoutness of body."
"Pours a deep black with some ruby tinges, small tan head that quickly diminishes, leaving minimal lacing. Aroma is strong chocolate, roasted malts, and toffee. Flavor is smooth creamy dark chocolate, some roasted maltiness, and a hint of toffee in the back. Medium-full body. My pick for Cooperstown's best brew."
"Not very complex, and I found it to be almost identical to their porter, but i liked that better. Kind of dull and unassuming, not Cooperstown's best effort. My bottle may have been a bit old. I didn't entirely trust the store that I got it from."
"The beer pours a dark black with a thick tan head that doesn't last. The aroma is musty with a dark malt appeal. The taste is good. There seems to be lots of chocolate malt used in this one along with patent malt. It's smooth going down and leaves you with that dark malt aftertaste. It is a low bodied beer for being as dark as it is. It's an average stout at best. It tastes mysteriously like a homebrew that I conjured up. Not at all what I would consider a good commercial replica."
"Roasty with a touch of coffee, and an ongoing chocolate flavor that is oh so nice. The body is medium full, but that is a tad thin for my liking. I would also ask for a bit more roastiness as there is a lot of sweet malts that need to take second in command to that deep dark character I love in a stout. Overall, this is a pretty good brew. I would sure love to check out a few more from this brewery, but it looks like someone stole my Benchwarmer."
"Ah the hedonistic pleasure of a pulchritudinous dark and brooding stout, lazing away in my chalice, the head stupendous in size, creamy in its consistency and the fine chocolate brown latticework of lace that longingly caresses the glass. The sweet hint of toasted grain, bittersweet chocolate and coffee, quite a pleasure for the schnozzle, sweet at the front, thick and rich at the top. Finish is perfectly hopped, modest in its carbonation with a dry lingering aftertaste and a good representative to the sweet stout style, and a good beer for the novitiates to the dark side."
"Thanks to Davo for the sample (and burps). No fault of yours though."
"Lightly roasted and chocolately with a good fruity base.  Medium bodied and spritzy on the tongue.  Finishes dry and easy.  Perfectly fine in all aspects but nothing that smacks you in the face, which, incidentally, makes it very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Opaque black color with a creamy tan head that holds quite well, but leaves no lace. The aroma is lightly roasty - coffee like - over a sweet chocolatey malt. The body is light-medium with a fine carbonation that's very smooth in the mouth. The flavor is of a gently fruity, sweet and roasty chocolatey malt. Well balanced with a bitterness that's quite subtle. It finishes dryish, with a short lingering roasty malt note. Not complex, nor rich, but well balanced and highly enjoyable."
"Pours a pure black color with a thick brown head that never fully disappears.  Sweet chocolatey malt aroma dominates the brew with a touch of bitter coffee thrown in as well.  Sweet and rich chocolate flavors control the brew with a subtle roasted coffee flavor lingering in the background.  As the brew finishes the chocolate flavors fade away a bit and allow the coffee bitterness to come forward.  The brew is actually a bit thin for the style but is very drinkable and rather tasty.  Thanks to Pbrian for this one."
"Notes: A beautiful stout to say the least ... medium to heavy in body and very flavourful all the way through."
"Fairly well carbonated, with a fizz on the tongue. Starts out with a dryish malty flavor, blossoming at the end into roasted malt and unsweetened chocolate flavors - a hint of black dark roast coffee?  Not much in the way of hops, save for a nice underlying bitterness.  Worth trying for the way the flavors explode at the end alone. A very enjoyable, well made stout - good in the bottle, and exceptional on tap."
"Good stout, black, thick and chewy, brewed with six malts.  Smooth, easy to drink.  The abv is 4.6%."
"Great stuff. Smooth, chocolately and slightly bitter coffee."
