"Taste is smooth, naturally balanced, honest and true. Chocolate, mild floral, specific to Williams beers. Soft carbonation, high drinkability. Am quite satisfied."

"Excellent - superb flavour and character. An avalanche of roasted malt with significant chocolate and coffee notes. Nice mouthfeel; the only minor let down is the body, which could be fuller. Can't say I really distinguish the coriander or orange under all that malt, but it doesn't detract from the experience. For a stout that is just under 5% ABV, this may well be peerless. A must-try beer if you have the chance."
"Very suitable for hunkering down in the latest Atlantic storm."
"Overall, this is one of the most delicious beers I've had. It's brewed like a stout, with chocolate malt and roasted barley, but also has wheat, coriander and orange zest. It's an interesting combination between two styles."
"My enjoyment of this beer was hightened by my football team winning 6-0 as I reviewed it!"
"Tasty and really easy drinking for a stout and all this from a humble bottle of beer, I would just love to try the cask."
"Reminds me yet again (I need to be reold and retold this) that stouts are more than just all consuming booze and weight."
"o: This was a strange one. I've never tried a Scottish ale with such a strong, roasty charcoal presence. I liked though and I'm very glad I got to try sometrhine so unique."
"O: Certainly one of the better cask beers I've come across. Wonderfully drinkable; creamy and downable. Definitely recommended."
