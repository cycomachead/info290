"Pitch black but not too thick. Smooth finish as well."
"The aromas keep growing as i write, but this is not exciting at all. Might have it again, if not better dark ales available."

"Overall: enjoyable stout which is easy to gulp down - Could easily sink a pint of this without feeling too bloated and the taste is smooth."

"O- The flavor scrubbing fizz and the off flavors are the only dimensions to the malt flavor and they are a bit odd. I don’t think the off flavors are related to the oysters but they just don’t compliment any of the malt flavors."
"O: Enjoyable stout that goes down easy."

"O: Really rather disappointing. Considering this is a highly regarded beer, not least of all being a 'Brewing Industry International Gold Medal Winner'. Having said that, this is very drinkable, and could make an easy drinking session beer. Just not that tasty, even a little watery."

"O: This is a very mediocre oyster stout. Both nose and the palate are very unrefined; everything just seems out of whack. This one is quite crude and really needs some work to be drinkable."
"From the 500 ml. bottle. Sampled on January 16, 2012. It pours close to black with ruby red hues and a long-lasting tan head. The aroma does little to make me think it is a stout. There are dark grainy malts, some vague fruit, and maybe a slight hop crispness but it is all very subtle. The body is thin. As for the taste, I get little that makes me think of a stout. It is more like a Heineken Dark with an off-dry finish. This goes down quickly though."
"No offensive taste - well maybe because it doesn't have a lot of taste..."
"Not very recomended although it's quite cheap"
