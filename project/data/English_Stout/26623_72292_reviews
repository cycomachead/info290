"On cask at North Bar in Leeds. Served in a half pint with half a finger of tan head topping off a black yet translucent appearance. Aroma is fairly heavily cooked barley malt with notes of bitter chocolate. While drinking the tan foam sticks to the glass. The flavor is dominantly malt with a heavily roasted malt flavor that lingers with a moderate bitter finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin.   Overall a decent stout. Serviceable but nothing special."

"On-tap. 1/2 pt glass. Enjoyed on marÂ´13. Pitch black appearance headed by a so close & creamy crown. Foam lasts until the end. Floral aromas rounded by subtle roasted notes & citric underneath. Crisp bitter upfront. Roasted malt flavors & gentle licorice touch. Full body. Moderate carbonation. Dried nut astringency reamins into a long dried & bitter finish. Citric on the aftertaste & coffee-like infusion. A big one!!"

"Deeply dark and tasty. Goes overboard with the roasted malt, but I rather like it. Dry, with plenty of bitter notes from the malt and hops. Aromatic hops add an interesting dimension to the flavour, though individual characteristics can't be picked out. Good body with light carbonation. The only thing that might benefit this beer would be conditioning with live yeast. Quality - well worth trying if you come across it."

"O: Excellent, one of the finest examples of this style. Tastes very similar to Elland - 1872 Porter but maybe less sweet. Not a session beer but a beer to be savoured till the last drop."

"Silky, complex and unconventional stout. Drinkable, too. I get the fuss over Magic Rock."
"Overall: An okay beer. A little over the top on the roast."
"Overall a very good beer, shame it's so strong or it would make an excellent session ale."
"Cheers!"
"Overall - A very enjoyable stout if maybe a little rough round the edges... Another fine brew from Magic Rock though and definitely recommended..."
"Good body on this, and good carbonation. Carbonated but thick, but not overly carbonated. Not quite sessionable but a good way to end the night."
"Dr: Very drinkable and of good quality at a standard price for London. Give her a spin, lads."
