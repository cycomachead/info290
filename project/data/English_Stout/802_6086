4.17,11.5,4,4.5,4.5,2.5,4,"Overall a pretty good beer. The taste of this beer is what really sets it apart. It isn't really anything new or unique but the execution is just superb. The super light mouthfeel was quite offputting but otherwise a rather nice beer.","Jamesthebrit","Jan 25, 2012"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from tap by the brewer himself into a snifter. Poured a massively dark brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, big leather, and dark fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and leather. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really surprised by the leather aspect that came across in this one as it was the first time I had experienced it in an American Stout where it wasn't intentional. This added a nice level of complexity to the brew on-top of the other flavors and aromas already present. Mouthfeel was a little better than most I have had in the style as most feel watered down. Worth trying if you go to the brewpub as it was quite enjoyable.","thagr81us","Dec 16, 2009"
4.18,11.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pitch black, creamy tan head that retains well. The nose is oat-riddled, caramel, sweet, and not too complex. Flavor is the same way...not necessarily complex- but delicious. Amazing for the price. Smooth and creamy feel to it-oaty finish. Highly enjoyable as well ad their IPA","scottyshades","May 26, 2009"
3.21,-14.2,4.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Overall impression: A serviceable stout that goes down just fine on a cool winter evening. My overall rating here is somewhat inflated by the appearance, but there's no denying it's a great-looking brew.","PDXHops","May 25, 2009"
3.45,-7.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Mouthfeel is a much more watery than expected, the rough edges really need some work. However it is drinkable and would offset a very sweet creamy dessert quite nicely.","czfreeman","Jan 01, 2009"
3.31,-11.5,4,3,3,3.5,4,"On draft at the brewery. Opaque pour, almost no aroma with this. Light roasted malt. Some coffee, roasted/burnt malts, very little if any chocolate. Needed just a little more of pretty much everything you expect from a stout. It was very drinkable however. Of the 3 I sampled, this was probably the best at BRBC.","Bung","Dec 13, 2007"
3.7,-1.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Enjoyed this one decently - it wasn't anything groundbreaking or amazing, but it's a solid, drinkable, reasonably-abv%ed stout with a good array of flavors and aromas and nothing particularly wrong with it.","CrellMoset","Jun 06, 2007"
3.35,-10.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability: Solid for one of those less-than-sweet stouts.","ChainGangGuy","Nov 16, 2006"
3.98,6.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D  This beer works well with the flavors and the mouthfeel makes is easy to drink.","barefootbrewer","Aug 04, 2006"
2.72,-27.3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Pours dark dark brown, pretty mulch black, no light getting though. No head at all, nothing. Smell is coffee, toasted, very subtle chocolate even, nice. Taste is very watery, oiley taste. coffee is there again, but its hard to get paste the almost slippery feel as this goes down. Does have a very nice hoppy finish though, was not expecting that. Have to try it again next time I go down there to see if that oiley taste is still there.","mikesgroove","Jul 18, 2006"

3.97,6.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"My previous growler from Blue Ridge produced little to no head however this one produced a nice head that laces well and leaves a little film down the glass. It is above average on appearance but could be better. The smell is full of chocolate and some other that is smooth and creamy, possibly oatmeal. The smell could be stronger though to be considered great. The taste is also nice. It is up front with its dark roasted and chocolate flavors but follows closely with some bitterness. The mouthfeel is nicely thick. There is a good body for a stout. Overall this is a nice Americal Stout. One you should give a try if at the Blue Ridge Brewery.","MSchae1017","0"
3.3,-11.8,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"The growler I brought home was the first samples of beer from the batch so lots of little yeasties are on the bottom of the grolwer. I dont think it effected the taste but I thought I would throw that in if anyone took offense to my review. Cheers!!!","SaCkErZ9","Sep 16, 2002"
2.42,-35.3,2,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Dark brown with thin looking body that allows some significant light to penetrate. Hmmthis is a stout? Light aroma, minimal roasted malt and coffee. Hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Light flavor, low bitterness...but not sweet either. Strange. Light, thin, watery body. What a waste of a cool name.","John","Beers"
3.06,-18.2,4,3,3,3,3,"Hoppy bitter for a stout. That probably comes from the low malt profile for a stout. Claims to be a tropical style stout, but not having had a tropical style stout before, I'm not sure what that means. It had a good head.","aracauna","0"
