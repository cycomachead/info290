"O: enjoyed and would get it again."
"I generally don't like Magic Hat, but this is my favorite chocolate stout. It's widely available in the winter and incredibly smooth. Every time I see a six-pack I buy one."

""

"It's good."

"Pours black. Aroma is roasty, bitter chocolate, coffee. Taste is biscut, dry and bitter with a light mouthfeel. No booze. Aftertaste is coffee. My guess of 6% abv is close to the actual 5.7, so no surprises there but it is still balanced. Overall, this is very good and an easy drinker."

"A great beer for a nice price and availability. Pours a nice black with a coffee colored head that lasts for a while. The smell was full of malt and sweet scents. The taste was great, hints of dark chocolate and almost fruity notes on the end. The mouthfeel was nice as well. Overall I would recommend for stout lovers as a nice beer to have in between the harder to find and more expensive stouts."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, char, and slight cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with char, cocoa, and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a slightly better set of flavors in my opinion."

"Ferrous quality dies and subdues a bit as it warms. Quite an interesting stout though."
"O) An excellent example of this category"

"O- Underwhelming, disappointment of a beer that I had high hopes for. I don't normally trust Magic Hat to put out a high quality brew, but I was hoping this one might be different based on reviews and scores I've read. However, there wasn't enough boldness or richness of flavors I expect in a high quality stout. That coupled with too many off aromas and flavors force me to give this brew regrettably low marks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black as can be, right out of the bottle. Smells strongly of cocoa with hints of vanilla, and better than that it tastes exactly the way you'd expect off your nose. Flavors are overall mild, and a perfect balance between bitter and sweet. Great stout, will pick up again."

"This ale pours a handsome but unremarkable near black with a slight off white head that quickly dissipates to a thin film and some lacing. The aroma is that of dark chocolate, vanilla beans, and light coffee notes. The flavor is mild but enjoyable with all the flavors promised in the nose plus some dried prune and raisin notes. It has a lighter body than I have come to expect from a stout. This is a very enjoyable beer that drinks quite light and easy. It is in no way a great stout but it is solid."

"Overall - excellent English stout, no-brainer for a session brew."
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Definitely a quality brew, although not in the same league as say the stouts by Founders, Lagunitas, or Samuel Smith's, but pretty close."

"Brought this on my skiing excursion to share with friends. Figured they like it and it was a huge hit. It's an inky-black brew with a small, off-white, lasting head. This beer is very roasted-smelling and it seemed to perfectly match the snowy, woodsy outdoors at the ski resort. The taste is lightly bitter up front, then the toasted malts take over bringing some sweetness in. It's big enough for what we wanted without being too heavy. Probably the perfect beer for that moment, and just a really good easy-drinking stout. This one is a winner I highly recommend."

"Overall a nice beer. Became more flavorful and balanced as it warmed."

""
""
"Overall, one of top 3 favorite dry stouts."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. I decided to buy a six pack while brewing my own Irish Stout for inspiration, so to speak. it did not dry my mouth out and was very flavorful. it wasn't as smooth as a Guinness draft, but it was smooth. I cannot say anything about its appearance because I drank it straight from the bottle, but the taste made it disappear."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the better darker stouts I have had in a long time, the coco tones are perfect and the taste has a slight sweetness which opens up on your tongue and lingers leaving your mouth feeling warm. If you enjoy the darker side of beer I highly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
"I was hopeful. The beer did not really have much of a smell to me maybe coffee hits. The beer was smooth but I got to say for a Stout, it was pretty tasteless and I thought a bit thin. Good lacing was present but I prefer taste. I will not buy again."
"Found myself trying this for the first time a few weeks ago being a winter seasonal, and man is this a great winter beer. Then a week later all I wanted was this specific taste. Dark, toffee, thick feeling quality, nice sharp finish , one might think this was an imported English stout. Would love to drink this and hobgoblin at same time and compare. Not weak either surprisingly buzz worthy but better to drink before any other beer as this taste Truly needs to be appreciated to its fullest. Great contrast to Magic hats other orange lemony zest beers/IPAs which I find typical amongst others. Definitely a stand out brew."
""
""
""
"Im pretty much a stout junkie and this is a very good one. Would definitely get again."
"I love the label artwork, I have a heart of darkness and that eye can see it through my chest."
"O: I like this stout. It's interesting, if not great. I'd be happy to drink more than one in a row, and would be happy to serve it friends. I know some people swear by this beer, and I won't go that far, but I'd certainly say that it is quite solid."
"Home tasting, 12oz bottle into Tulip glass. 1/29/14."
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black in color with almost a 1-finger beige head that settles down to just a thin ring around the top. Some spotty lacing is seen but not a lot actually. The aroma is of sweet roasted malts, chocolate with a hint of black coffee. The taste is even better and very so smooth! Perfect blend of tasty flavors. Perfect carbonation. No bitter or bitter aftertaste for this one! A FANTASTIC stout all the way!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A respectable stout with bold flavors decent, all-around character."
""
"Overall: I was not expecting this from Magic Hat, one of their better beers. Great taste, smooth, and easy to drink."
"I'm liking this A LOT. A worthy brew!"
""

"Am not enjoying this out of balance, overly rooty, stout. Sorry I took a friend's recommend on this one, and bought the whole six. Root beer (stout) float anyone?"

"As for the alcohol, it's here but this was about an easygoing a Stout that I'll ever have. Even though I only had one bottle of this, I could easily have another in a sitting and hardly feel buzzed from it. If you're looking for a good breakfast Stout or a replacement for your morning cup of joe, look no further. This won't win any awards but it just might win me back to Magic Hat, even after all of these years."

"My third beer reviewed from Magic Hat, and one of my favorites. Had this straight out of the bottle. The color was what you'd expect, as dark as dark can be, puffy tan-ish head. Smooth smokey flavor that you'd expect from a stout. Average body for an American stout. If you're looking for a nice after dinner beer or something of that nature."

"Initially thought this was a bit watery and not very complex after thinking it was a Russian Imperial. Definitely fits into the English stout category and a damn good one. Nice black pour and you can see it's a bit thinner almost leaning to the porter side. Smells of roasted coffee but not overpowering and a slight burnt chocolate. Taste similar with a nice balance of smooth coffee, not too bitter, nice finish"
""
""
""
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. As I have said, my only knock against this stout is the slightly high carbonation. If let sit until slightly above room temp, Heart of Darkness takes on a different character--it becomes a little more rich and the hidden flavors become more evident. I didn't detect the bourbon (?) flavor right away."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is interesting dry and lots of bitter roast quality. Not terrible but also not something I can see myself returning to have again."

"Magic Hat Heart of Darkness Diabolical Stout (2013) - 5.7% ABV. Behold, Magic Hat's possible best brew. Pitch black thick body. Little to no head with excellent lacing and retention. No sign of carbonation-- I'm sure it's there but good luck seeing it. Thick chocolate and cocoa aromas. A hint of coffee. Clean wet mouthfeel. Coffee nose. Lots of Kona, Arabica, and a hint of Ethiopian beans. Chocolate milk and coffee mid-palate. Luxurious. Bitter back palate. Stout bitter hops and porter malts. Toasted barley and oaked wood aftertaste. Strong tannins and leather persist. Dry finish. So much stout. So much good bitters. So full and well rounded. Incredibly drinkable. Smooth. 4.5 out of 5. Very good. Bordering on excellent. Recommended for any porter or stout lover."

"The dark malts and coffee are the welcoming ingredients in the flavor but it does not take long for a notable dry hop bitterness to emerge at the end and speak for the stout on its own. It really tastes the way I like my English stouts to taste."

"When i poured this, it has a black as night body with a small tan head that lays down quickly to a thin tan lace. The aroma has a malt, chocolate smell to it. The taste has a deep, roasted malt flavor to start then the chocolate and some coffee notes come in on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is really smooth, imo perfect for a stout. Overall this is a really good stout."
"Overall: A great stout, easy drinking."
""
""

"Overall I like it. It is a good stout and I would buy it again."
""

"By far Magic Hat's best brew. Most of them are boring to downright offensive, this is downright tasty, drinkable, and even a bit complex."
"Overall this is a very drinkable stout. I would recommend this to anyone when the temperature begins to drop."

"Light to medium body, medium effervescence. Dry throughout with just a faint hint of warming. Pretty bitter and a lot less body than a stout should have. Otherwise, a really nice brew."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pub glass. This is a very mild light stout. It's mildly sweet and malty without much complexity aside from a bit of subdued chocolate. It would be tolerable for a newbie, but probably a bit of a let down for someone who actually enjoys stouts that have kick. Not a whole lot going on here. There's a bit of head, some sudsy lacing, but it pours sort of flat."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, winter 2012 bottling. Pours lightly hazy very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger moderately dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some nice soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, roasted malt, toast, toffee, caramel, light coffee, and light floral earthiness. Excellent aromas with great balance, strength, and complexity of roasted malt notes with light hops. Taste of milk chocolate, roasted malt, toast, toffee, caramel, coffee, and floral earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, roasted malt, toast, toffee, coffee, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors; with a good amount of robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent stout! Great balance of roasted flavors with good robustness; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"O- I loved the smell of this one but I am more partial to the smoother stouts that are out there. I was a little put off by the bitters left in the finish. I would prefer a sweeter finish to my stout. Still had a good nose and taste up front."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I can recommend this, and I would reach for another. I would look for this if I were in the mood to sip a rich brew on a cool evening."
"Overall a very nice stout. Not to aggressive. A very good stout for someone who normally drinks lighter beers and wants to try something new."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is black with lots of frothy tan head leaving a thick lace. Nose is heavy chocolate and roast, a touch of tree bark, and a hint chalky. Taste is also chocolate and heavy roast, faint ash, light hop sweetness in the finish. Body is lighter, soft carbonation and creamy feel. Fairly balanced and full of flavor with just a touch of lingering bitterness."
""
"Magic Hat Heart of Darkness is a solid, black ale with a generous, soft, light brown head that has outstanding lacing and retention. The aroma is kind of tangy with a fair amount of dark roast. There's a note of caramel and some sort of spice. It's smooth and medium bodied with a dry finish that's pretty clean. It tastes pretty dry and roasty with just enough bitterness to balance it out. It is pretty tangy, but not fruity. There are notes of caramel and vanilla. A light, resiny bitterness lingers for a bit after the swallow. This is a really solid offering from Magic Hat. I can down a 6-pack of this with no hesitation."

"O- A very delicious stout and well balanced. It's not overly complicated, but contains a great amount of character. The ingredients compliment each other without trying to overpower each other."
""
"Flavors of chocolate milk, carob, slight amount of roast barley and ash in the taste as well. Mellow and fairly smooth, light carbonation, slight astringency. It's good, nothing groundbreaking, though i'll probably reach for local options before this, i'd drink it again and seek out a fresher sample next time."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a quarter inch tan head. Both the head retention and lacing are decent enough. The brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee and a bit of dark fruit. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, although the dark fruit flavor is a bit stronger. It's also more sweet than bitter tasting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy, smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a solid brew. Picked up a single at Liquor Barn for $1.79."
"Drinks smooth and a bit bitter but also with that being said that also is an underlying chalkiness too. I like this beer it's quite good but also standard fair from Magic hat. What can they do to take themselvies to the next level."

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are several other stouts I would pick first."
"Heard good things and I'm definitely not disappointed. Full, complex flavor in a low ABV stout, and the English-ness makes it rather unique. Very good."
""
"D - It's an average stout. Nothing great, but not terrible. I'd pass on it in the future."

"Pours black with brown highlights, with a mocha head. A very nice pour for a stout, a powerful smell, chocolate, roasted malt, and sweet notes. The taste follows suit, powerful taste, the roasted malt stays throughout, starts sweet ends malty. The roasted malt stays in the aftertaste, great flavors with good balance. A good mouthfeel for an English stout, medium-light, good carbonation, nice and smooth. Overall a great flavor, and easy to drink, a great beer, definitely worth checking out."

"Overall: Good beer that I picked up in a variety pack not too long ago and definitely would be on the lookout. Doesn't hit you in the pockets and you definitely get a lot. Grab a glass and enjoy....Salud!"

"The beer pours a black with a thin tan head that fades quickly. The nose presents some dry Irish yeast notes, a slight bitterness and sweetness. The yeast predominates the flavor profile along with some semi-sweet cocoa, and a slight bitterness. It's definitely drinkable with a semi-dry, stouty finish. It's a drinkable stout with a modest abv...one of the first magic hat beers I don't regret buying..."

"This stout has an excellent near-black opaque appearance. There seems to be some carbonation here. The initial pour produces a huge, khaki colored fluff, and the bubbles themselves are dense like sea foam. This later goes down, but not completely - there's always a little cover over the dark beer. Bonus points for that! The aroma is a breeze of pure bliss through my nostrils! It's main characteristics are vanilla cream, milk chocolate, and sweetened coffee. However good, it is fairly straight forward. The taste is very similar to the aroma, with a good balance between the bitter and the sweet aspects. That slight fruit flavor so telling of a Magic Hat brew is here, of course too. It feels light in the mouth and the finish has a roasted flavor and a dry effect to it. Overall, it's a nice stout that goes down easy when you're not in the mood for a 'big' beer."

"Taste is a little more straightforward, roasted malt upfront, the cocoa presence is much lighter in flavor than it is in aroma, burnt malt bitterness and a slight metallic flavor in the aftertaste, body is surprisingly thin with a carbonation that just seems too aggressive."

"Overall: A style you don't find too often but happy to have enjoyed this regional brew."

"12oz. bottle served in a willibecker. One of the original brews that got me into craft back in the day so let's see how it has held up. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a quarter inch, fizzy, tan-colored head. Nose reveals roast, lactose sweetness and a metallic aroma towards the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also an acidity that cuts through the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation that falls just short of lively. Acidity is light, but lingers along the taste buds at the back of the tongue between quaffs. Overall, this beer has held up pretty well considering the last time I had it was in the mid 90's. That said, it's definitely not as robust as I recall, but a respectable beer nonetheless."
""
"Overall: I actually am glad the local recommended this beer. Pretty darn delicious. I would definitely try this beer again. Everything seemed to somewhat surprise me about this one, Highly recommended to anyone who wants a good stout to enjoy"

"This is terribly easy to drink. While 5.7% ABV isn't exactly session material, it goes down so easy with a smooth character that you'll want, and be able, to have quite a few of these. Really a nice rendition of an English classic."
""

"Anyone know why this is categorized as an english stout?"

"The beer poured out promising, looking dark brown to black, with a small head. The aromas were dominated by the carbonation at first, but opened up into chocolate and coffee upon prolonged inspection. The taste was somewhat disappointing to me, as the coffee, toffee, and chocolate flavors were nice and clean, but they felt diluted due to the thin and tinny mouthfeel. I m glad I only bought a single. A case of what could have been."
"Verdict: I would have another!"
"O-Quite liked this despite not being the biggest fan of the stouts....it's up there with some of the greats."
""
""
""
""
"o: great stuff, especially for the price. Could be better if it was a little less bubbly."
"O - used to be one of my favorites stouts (was it discontinued for a while?). A highly drinkable stout, especially for those who like a smokey aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"Certainly one of the better MH offerings I have had in a while. I used to always buy the mixed seasonal 12 packs but haven't lately. Worth trying for sure."
""
"Overall: A very well put together stout. The chocolate and coffee notes, along with the smokeyness give it a very interesting and warm feel. It's a winter seasonal through and through, meant to be had on a cold night."
"Overall: At first, I wasn’t too impressed with this beer…it sorta does taste like a home brew, which is fine, but I expect a bit more from a fairly large brewery like magic hat…although, I kinda feel like all magic hats taste the same…anyway, the warmer this gets, the better it tastes…the chocolate and coffee come out of hiding and make this a much more pleasurable experience than when it was cold out of the fridge…a very pleasant chocolate, coffee and malt aroma is there too…so much better! I’m still gonna give this a 2, but if it’s served closer to room temp, it could be a 2+…(2.25/5)"

"Overall not bad, not bad at all. Surprised from Magic Hat these days. Most of their beers seem to really have gone downhill, and this is the brewery that got me into craft beer so it was hard for me to see them fade out. This is nice, good malts mostly, dark malts without much char, although there was a slight metallic flavor, nice touch of smoke and just a faint hint of cocoa that I would have liked to come out more, and hops are very light which I also would have liked ot see more. Otherwise a decent beer."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into british pint glass. Black/brown, shows clear deep red in the light on the edges. small tan head that dissipates quickly with a little lacing. Smell said ""toasted"" more than ""roasted"" to me for some reason, but the taste disagrees. Coffee and roasted malt all the way, with a rough but creamy mouthfeel. Excellent stout, bittersweet chocolate upfront is balanced by the bitter finish. Loved it!"
"O: A fruity and soft stout with light bit of sweetness but a bit more bitterness. The dark fruit from the malt blends well with the citrus and grapefruit from the hops making for a sort of juicy stout. I'd call this a Foreign Extra Stout for BJCP style. Nice, when did we get to start using quarters of a percent?"
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good and different example of the style, it had some decent roasted and oat flavors to it with some great complexity and a fitting mouthfeel that made it fairly memorable. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I could see drinking a couple of these but after that the thickness might become too much, it's a good late fall beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel they were both pretty well done and very pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was nice, but it was just a little thin and it lacked the tons of rich and roasted malts that I normally find in the style. I would buy this beer again, in fact I already went back to the store and bought another six pack, it's reasonably priced and a decent tasting Oatmeal Stout, I recommend it to anyone who likes the style. All in all I was happy with this beer, even though I was told it was good, I always have my doubts with Magic Hat, but this one turned out to be a nice surprise and it showed me that Magic Hat can actually make a decent beer. Good job guys, if you start making more beers of this quality I may actually end up becoming a fan one day, Cheers!"

""
""
"Cheers!!!"
"O- An absolutely excellent stout that I recommend everyone give a try. It's not insanely strong, there's no alcohol taste, just beautiful creamy, coca goodness. I don't always like Magic Hat, especially their ales, but this one was spot on to my taste."
""
""
""
""
"O - Just a really nice, well rounded stout that makes a great replacement for Howl. Hopefully it will stick around for a while, I think that beer nerds will be happy that it is back. It was certainly nostalgic for me to finally buy some Magic Hat again."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is not particularly dark. But it's better than the (current) average Magic Hat beer. It's nicely roasty with some nice chocolate. I had this on tap about a month ago, and I remember it being better than this bottle. Thus, I'm being slightly generous with my scores."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great job!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"DELICIOUS; GET SOME!"
""
""
""
"Could it be?! The first beer from Magic Hat that actually impressed me! Most things have been average, so I actually put back the sixer in favour of a single...might have to revisit lol"
""
""
""
"pours almost pitch black, but it is a very very dark reddish brown. Nice frothy tan/mocha head that diminishes to leave a nice thin layer of foam with very nice lacing. It smells of roasted and burnt malts with a hint of chocolate and hops. There is a lot of that burnt malt taste up front that fades to coffee and cocoa, and finally bitter hops. It is moderately heavy on the palate with low carbonation. mouth feel is creamy, then dry as the hops dominate the palate. Overall, very good. It was a pleasant surprise in the magic hat winter sampler pack."
""
""
"i bought this heart of darkness for a pie recipe that i got off magic hats website. the pie was great, but the beer isnt as bold as i would expect from something called ""the heart of darkness."" the color is an almost opaque with a nice slight crimson tint. the smell is nutty, maybe some hazel nut and chocolate malt. the taste nutty and smokey, but it quickly wanes to a watery nothing. i wish this was bolder, and packed a little more of a punch. over all its not worthless but when im in the mood for a stout, however, i usually want something bolder and more flavorful."
"Heart of Darkness has a beautiful deep brown pour that borders on black. The aroma is also very nice, there's a solid amount of roastiness with chocolate, coffee and oatmeal tones behind it. The taste has a well integrated roast and oatmeal thing going on at first, with some herbal hops in the background. More coffee tones come through on the finish, with a bit of chocolate backing up everything. The mouthfeel could be a little smoother, but is spot-on with the thickness. Overall, this is a very solid stout. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A damn fine beer. I'll have to see if they have sixers of this one at my local store."
"O: A very solid English stout. The roasty notes help to keep sweetness to a minimum and make the drinkability even better. The chocolate and coffee notes are very pleasant as well. One of my favorites from MH"
""
""
"This was one that I was pretty glad that they re-released. The beer poured out as a nice deep brown color with a thin cream colored head on top. The retention is very thin with a bit of lacing on the glass. The smell of te beer has a nice aroma of toasted oats and other roasted malts. The taste has a nice rich roasted flavor to it, the oats shine really well in this beer. There is a subtle chocolate note in there also. The mouthfeel is creamy, not overly thick but nicely carbonated and drinkable. Overall it was a good beer. One of the best I've had from Magic Hat in a long time."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but I was hoping for just a little more smoothness in the body and a little more complexity to the flavor."
""
""
"Heart of Darkness pours solid black. A finger and a half or so of mocha foam crowns the beer, even managing to spill out of the glass a little bit. The nose is very nice, based around a roasty coffee aroma. There's also a noticeable smell of star anise that joins the picture. The flavor profile starts out similarly well, with the taste of coffee that's had a bit of cream added to it. The anise is a bit more muted here, drowned out somewhat by a slightly jarring hop presence. The bitterness clashes with the roasty malt character, and the earthy, herbal finish is a little bit overbearing. The mouthfeel is just a little bit short of great. The body is a hair too dry, and the carbonation is noticeably zippy. Both are just off though. I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by Heart of Darkness, Given my lack of fondness for many of the other Magic Hat brews I've had. This one is pretty solid."
""
""
""
"Decent brew, but the acrid character hurts the experience, along with that stale hop character."
""
"Pours jet black, ring of brown foam. Layer remains on top. Big rich roasted nose. Espresso loaded. Dark chocolate too. Creamy roasted flavor. Dry finish. Very flavorful. Ever so slight bitter in the close. Quite tasty. Magic Hat really pulled this one off."
""
""
""
"This is pretty good overall. Not sure if I'd go back to it a lot, but definitely quality."
"O - As a beer, its one i wouldn't turn down but wouldn't seek out. As a stout, a little disappointing for me. Reminds me more of a dark English ale."
""
""
""
"O- this was the first Engkish stout that I have tried, it's a very interesting style. I was quite surprised how tart it was and the charred notes were certainly noticeable. Pretty interesting and definitely worth a try."
""
""
"O - a good example of the style."
"O: Really not bad at all. I tend to avoid Magic Hat, but this one's good/cheap enough for me to possibly consider getting a 6 pack of."
""
"This one pours dark with a nice head that lasts. The smell is roasted, coffee, chocolate. The taste follows the smell with a roasted flavor and chocolate. A bit of sweetness is a nice addition. Body has a creamy feel. Magic hat did a great job with this one. A drinkable and flavorful Stout."
"This is a wonderful beer. I got it on sale for $31. I expected it to be more drinkable for a stout, but it is definitely on the savory side. It is a great winter beer for the fireside and a pipe."
"O-Magic Hat mad a great beer, something of theirs I fully enjoyed. Keep this up Magic Hat."
""
""
""
"O. Very lovely stout. It isn't overbearing in anyway. If a high alcohol taste and over the top burnt flavor is more your style, this isn't it. But it's a great, balanced beer."
"overall: nice easy stout, not overpowering roast or bitterrness, nice dark color, balanced mouthfeel"
""
""
""
"I decided to buy the magic hat winterland 12 pack which comes with four different magic hat brands. I went for the stout first since I really like stouts and the flavors induced inside them. For a stout I was expecting a lot more flavors and this did disappoint me a little bit. It does have that nice coffee roasted stout flavor but I was expecting a better aftertaste. The aftertaste was a little bland but I do like the first initial flavor of coffee notes. This stout is a good fast sipper though because most stouts are high in alcohol and this one isn't. Overall this is a good stout but not one I would buy on a regular basis. I would prefer Sierra Nevadas Narwhal Imperial Stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this average beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was very gark and poured a really dark head. I was hopeful. The beer did not really have much of a smell to me maybe coffee hits. The beer was smooth but I got to say for a Stout, it was pretty tasteless I thought. Good lacing was present but I prefer taste. I will not buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent stout, not over the top or very interesting, but solid."
""
""
"D: the acidity of the roast is a bit too much for me. both in the nose and on the palate. unfortunately unenjoyable."
""
""
"Not a stout I would revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'd recommend it as a casual beer but nothing that I'll savor every sip of."
""
"This was a well flavored beer with a huge coffee presence. It's also easy to drink. This would make a really good stout for a session. It's also reasonably priced making it a first choice for me when I want a sixer vs. a bomber."
""
"O- Being a stout guy, I can't take this as my favorite, but being a stout guy, I could take this a few rounds instead of sacrificing myself to Guinness or a cheap shitty light beer. It's smooth, has a moderate ABV, and is light enough to knock a few back. It wasn't satisfying enough to have just this one, but I'll remember it the next time I plan on getting fired up!"
""
""
"Overall, watery and lots of roasted patent malts."
"Poured deep black with a thin tan head that dissapated quickly. Smells roasted and sweet. Taste is a creamy sweetness that follows into some hop bitterness and lots of roasted malts. Roasted, burnt flavors that lingers long after. Mouthfeel is medium with carbonation that tingles the tongue, but not too much. Overall a solid stout that leaves you wanting another sip soon after the last. Very good and recommended."
""
"Magic hat really outdid themselves with this brew. A decent stout that's tasty and balanced. I'd pick up a 6"
""
""
""
"A beer I hope to definitely buy again!"
"Overall: The beer lies somewhere between stout and porter and that will delight lovers of both. I found this a nice sippable beer, but without any hint of alcohol, very quaffable. I think the complexity will satisfy the lover of Porters, and a stout drinker will clearly enjoy the richness. This is not Winter Aleor a spiced ale by any means, but a really solid hopped stout."
""
""
"O-tons of roasted malt but isn't overwhelming at all. Still well balanced and layered. Really delicious stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely not bad, but very standard. I would have liked a bigger mouthfeel and some coffee notes in addition to the chocolate. Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very well constructed stout. A very pleasant winter treat."
"Overall: I drained my pint without realizing it especially since I brewed a java stout and remarked on how similar mine was to it without the ""java"" flavoring. Knowing that stouts are dark (derrrr) this one was exceptionally inky black. I loved it. Enjoyed while sitting by the fire pit on a clear cool night. I recommend it!"
"Really nice to see this beer back. Great name too. The beer is dark, dark black. Perfect for a cold day. Aroma is rich with malt and black. Really appealing nose. Mouthfeel is perfect for a stout. Just enough thickness, just enough drinkability. Flavors are rich, roasty, inviting, challenging. this beer is really nice."
""
""
"O - This is a really good stout. Probably the best I've had from Magic Hat."
""
""
"O - It's a little above average. I can't think of better stouts in this category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I must confess that I'm really not a fan of Magic Hat in general. In my opinion they spend far too much time and effort on the marketing of what is usually very mediocre beer. This beer is a bit of a departure for them, and I'm glad. It took guts for a brewery that normally sticks with very safe, crowd-pleasing beers to release an oatmeal stout as their main winter seasonal. They didn't hold back either; it's very flavorful and robust, so much so that it isn't hard to imagine the casual beer drinker being a bit overwhelmed by it. It seems to be selling very well though, and even the twelve packs are moving. A laudable effort from Magic Hat. I hope this will be around for years to come."
""
""
"This stout's got the heft, and the appropriate body, but it's way too spritzy. The finish also goes astringent. I can take a little crispness in a stout, but it never abates here."
""
""
""
"I would absolutely buy this again. Heart Of Darkness is a lovely surprise from the boys up in Burlington. Wish there were more of these in my fridge."

"O: good solid oatmeal stout"
""
""
"Overall, solid, nice dry stout with good taste. But ... why is this a seaonal? Nothing at all suggests holiday in this brew. But it's good, unfortunate they limit it's availability ...."
""
"O - Delicious and satisfying stout. Somewhat warming. Very enjoyable, and one of the best stouts I've had. A go-to brew for me in the winter months."
"I'm not sure this is so sensational, but it's certainly a deeply flavorful brew. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Grapevine Liquors in Denver."
""
""
"Overall - a great stout, I am quite surprised at how much I like it!"
"O - Pretty tasty, nothing to write home about but you could certainly do worse. The strengths of this brew are its bitterness and aroma. The weaknesses are its bitterness and its over-carbonation/mouthfeel. The head made me think it would be a bit thicker and creamier/lesser carbonated but that was not that case."
"O - This beer came out swinging, but lost a punch or two later in the game. I enjoyed the experience, but would like to try it on tap. Very impressive endeavor by the guys in Vermont."
""
""
""
"Overall I was very happy with my purchase of this and would definitely drink it again, I am always iffy about some of the magic hats I try but I definitely did not go wrong with this one"
""
"This is an extremely well crafted stout. Has more going on in the nose than on the palate, but still tastes great! It's hard to live up to that wonderful aroma."
""
""
""
"Probably the best showing by Magic Hat in the last 5 years (excluding the 1st rerelease of Blind Faith.) Nice flavor profile and a solid showing overall. Not the best in the style, but probably the best thing Magic Hat has on the market currently."
""
""
"Tasty, bitter, and another interesting beer from Magic Hat. However, I was disappointed. I'm a stout fan but this lacked some of the sweeter/coffee like after tastes that you find in more traditional stouts. Always worth a try from this brewery, but I think I'll stick with Shakespeare."
"Overall it's not going to be my ""go to"" oatmeal stout but it's the best thing this company made that I tried. Plus the cover art is pretty schweet."
""
""
"O: Never been a big fan of MH, they make so-so stuff imo. This was actually pretty tasty and a play it safe oatmeal stout that stay true to the style. Awesome looking label and artwork by the way."
"Overall this is a solid enough beer, but it doesn't terribly stand out to me. Above average but not exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a fine stout and one of Magic Hat's best beers. Is it world-class? No, but it's worth looking for."
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours velvety out of the bottle, jet black, huge rocky tan head holds great retention & leaves tons of lacing on the glass. A full nose, rich, roasty, chocolate, faint fruitiness. Tastes are robust with dark chocolate, roasted barley, french roast coffee, oatmeal, a little smoky, a little fruity, kind of ashy on the finish. Mouth-feel is velvety smooth, creamy, medium bodied, well balanced, finishes clean with some lingering roast. Overall, wow...nice surprise! Might be the best oatmeal stout I've had, and is definitely the best Magic Hat offering I've had."
""
""
"OVERALL: Not a bad stout. Interesting hop character, and a good malt base. I recommend letting this warm up alittle before partaking."

"O: Not very impressed. Pretty harsh for an oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
"Heart of darkness pours like it sounds, nice and black, with just a sneeze of dissipating head. The nose lacks a robustness but lends roasted grains and dark syrupy notes. It hits the tongue at first slightly sweet, but in the end a brackish bitter cocoa nib nips your tongue. A solid medium body with a gentle creamy texture give this beer an easy swallow. Overall this beer is quite the average stout for me. It does have a really good score on BA though so perhaps its on tap where it shines."
"Well, I still like it! Is it as good as it used to be? I have no idea. I may have rated it higher a while back and I was surprised to see that I didn't rate it when I had the chance, but it's still a nice rendition of an oatmeal stout and certainly one of the better beers Magic Hat is currently putting out. It's good to see the hypnotic eye in my fridge again. Meeemoriiees..."
""
""
"As the name would suggest, it pours black, with a nice bit of head that lingers well. The smell is very coffee-like with some smoke, in other words, delicious. Like the smell, the taste is rich and coffee, or maybe even espresso-like. Heavy in flavor and that flavor is wonderful. Leaves a nice smokey after taste. Overall, a wonderful stout! Highly recommended."
"12 oz bottle pours an opaque black with nice fluffy head. Aroma is light smoke, coffee, cocoa, and playdough. Taste is smokey malt, french roast coffee, and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth with bitter bite to finish. Overall I'm not a big Magic Hat fan but this fairly standard stout is very well done."
""
""
"Overall - Magic Hat just started distributing to my area, and I've been eager to give their beers a try. My first one hasn't disappointed, and they are very competitively priced. I'll be picking up more of their beers for sure. I'm just slightly disappointed this is only a seasonal, as I would pick it up throughout the year. Not the best stout, and not the best priced, but if I couldn't find my go-to's I'd be more than content with this! 4/5"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the appearance. The coloring was deep, while the head showed great retention, with many bubbles remaining until the very last drop. The nose was full of notes, but we found them to be a bit subdued collectively. The taste followed in very much the same vein, with the flavoring being inclusive, but not as entirely robust as hoped for. The feel, however, was silky and smooth to fit the style, but not enough to make you forget in full the duller aroma and flavoring."
"Nose is sweet, light coffee, milk chocolate, sugar and a hint of vanilla. The taste is pretty mild. Dark malts, coffee (almost like coffee grounds), milk chocolate, a hint of dark chocolate and just a bit of vanilla bean. It has a medium body with a light but somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Definitely a lot better than the last Magic Hat brew I had (#9 pale ale)."
""
"Light roasted coffee bitterness up front. Smooth blend of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and peaty malt fill up the palate. Dark chocolate and cocoa nib bitterness into the finish. Hints of vanilla and dark fruit linger. Medium-full body with a nice, smooth, creamy feel. Very nicely done! Might be the best Magic Hat beer I've had."
"Mouthfeel is exceptional- as they advertise, silky smooth and luscious. Medium to full body, mild soft carbonation, long bittersweet finish. This is maybe the best beer that I've ever had by Magic Hat. I'll be getting more of it (and it'll be the first time I've bought magic hat for myself in quite some time)."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic, jet black pour with a 2 inch white head. Nice lacing. The aroma is full of roasted malts. The flavor is very roasty, pleasantly bitter. It finishes with a lingering bitterness. Medium in body and well carbonated. A very solid offering from Magic Hat, very enjoyable."
""
"-Overall 3.5: Good milk stout. No way this is an oatmeal stout. Perhaps some type of melding of the two styles, i.e. by adding lactose to a light oatmeal stout. Regardless, this is a smooth and easy-drinking stout that does not have certain stout flavor profiles that may intimidate some people."
""
"Very easy-drinking. Had no trouble putting away three of these bad boys. I wouldn`t be surprised if it became a permanent offering."

"Overall a pretty impressive brew from Magic Hat. Has an authentic stout taste. Wouldnt mind having this one again."
""
""
"I'm gonna have to try this with a scoop of French Vanilla Ice Cream and maybe some raspberries, yup I think I just found desert. This was the perfect beer for today, I wish I could find a perfect beer everyday."
""
"O: This is a rich tasting oatmeal stout that is deceptively easy to drink. The only drawback is it seems that it could have used more flavors of roasted malts."
""
"Overall this is a very pleasant drinking stout, but a bit too roasty and hoppy for my preference for an oatmeal stout. Needs more oats to create than silky body which is necessary for a true winner in this category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a solid, tasty, un-gimmicky beer, and if this brewery would make more like it I would buy their products more than just rarely."
"Everything a stout should be. Grab some this winter."
"I recommend giving this a go. It's a very different and creative take on the style. Now time for some swordfish, looking forward to my fiance's arrival!"
""
"World-class stout right here."
""
""
""
"Happy Halloween.. Drink good beer!"
"Overall, the best Magic Hat beer I have tried by far. Tons of flavor and a great mouthfeel make for one amazing stout. Definitely pick this one up if you have the opportunity."
"Good punch of bitter coffee up front, followed by roasted malt with some slightly sweet molasses notes which all but hidden in the lively dance of carbonation. Finishes with a smooth coating of chocolate - bitter and a little dry. This is a delicious beer."
"O: good but not quite as good as the Highland Black Mocha Stout I had last night. The Magic Hat stout has a more obvious hop presence, a trace of sour, and a touch more carbonation, but is slightly less rich and complex."
"Taste-Rich roasted coffee, dark chocolate, faint smokiness and tangy hop prescence. Dry, roasty finish. Not as creamy as some oatmeal stouts but every bit as flavorfull, with a drier finish. Match up with some burgers or BBQ. Yum!"
""
"Overall, this is a solid beer that I would recommend to any timid drinker who wants to try their first stout."
""
""
""
""
"Some beers are just cool, and this is one of them. As oatmeal stouts go, you won't find a heartier pour. My bartender commented when she started the tap, ""Wow, that's dark!"". It is smooth to drink, just a little bitter on the edges, and an all around quality beer!"
"O- I prefer drinking this from the bottle as opposed to from a glass, but at any rate, it's still the best Magic Hat beer I've ever had. Got the case on clearance for 15.99, and it's definitely an amazing value at that price"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall –A quite tasty and balanced stout at only 5.7 % abv. The blend of flavors and their transitions are all very nice."
""
"I wonder if ol' Joe Conrad is getting royalty checks...? Regardless, this stuff pours a bleak mahogany topped by a finger of tan foam. Darkness, eh? Not quite, buddy. The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted oats, and a touch of coffee. There we go, back on track. The taste brings in more of the same, though everything is now overly roasted and/or toasted. Dammit. At least it's not all bad this time. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very dry finish. Overall, a schizoid little stout, one that's too thin and too roasty for its own good."
""
""
""
"This is an okay brew, but I believe there are much better oatmeal stouts to be made. It's not creamy, or delicious, merely an average representation of style. I could not drink two back to back. Recommended, but tame your expectations."
""
""
"O/D-Really solid Oatmeal Stout. I will have no problem blowing back all 6 of these. One of Magic Hat's best offerings. Not too sweet, which I am happy about. Oh, so solid!"
"One of the better Magic Hats. Certainly better than Joseph Conrad's book."
""
"Haven't seen this offering yet from MH so picked up a sixer of it. Pours a jet black with tannish head. Nice roasty aroma. Taste is medium bodied, a bit bland. Nice mouthfeel.. but I feel it's a bit lacking taste, not overly hoppy but doesn't have the usual nuttiness of an oatmeal stout. I was surprised to see this one rated so high... seems like an average, drinkable stout to me, nothing too special about it."
""
"Pours pitch black with a large very fine, creamy, tan head. Excellent retention and wonderful lacing. Smell is rather subtle, roasted coffee notes and caramel maltiness, slightly alcoholic. Taste is good, roasted bitterness and a lot of caramel malty sweetness. Slight chocolate and alcohol notes at the finish. Medium carbonation and a medium to full body. Mouthfeel is wonderful, creamy and smooth, finishes with a good bite that leaves you wanting more. This is a great stout, different from the usual suspects most people think of for the style, but definitely well within the style guidelines. Definitely recommend and I will be having this again."

"magic hat in colorado, nice! this must be newish from them, havent seen it before. it pours a shockingly black color, dense as hell, no light getting through this baby. theres a bubble mocha head on it about an inch to an inch and a half tall, and some nice sticky lacing. it smells really basic, no chocolate, no espresso, none of the frills. just really dark bitter malt and some decent bittering hops. the flavor is also much without the extras, although i do taste some dark cocoa in there. there is a great bitterness from the malt, and a ton of body (but not sugar) from the oats. good carbonation and melty smooth texture. havnt had a lot of good dark beers from magic hat before this one, but this i can really get into. a perfect winter seasonal."

"Good marks for drinkability. Went down nicely. If I were close enough to Magic Hat, I'd get a growler for sure."
"Grabbed a growler of this after they tapped the last keg for the season. Out of the glass and into another this brew was an opaque, dark brown with a wood stain meniscus. Thin, one finger head of tan foam. Aromas of coffee, milk chocolate and hints of vanilla. Flavors were similar, chocolate, roasted malt, sweetened coffee and grainy oats in the finish. Very smooth drinking but the body seems a bit light for the style. Still, a good Oat Stout and glad I picked it up."
"Bottle opened with a big hiss, and when poured seems a bit over carbonated. Pours a nice black with slight brown highlights on the edges. Creamy tanish head that stuck around for a while. This beer smells amazing. Dried plums and raisins, chocolates, coffee. Taste is creamy smooth chocolate, some coffee, some fruits, a little bit of oxidation, but not horrible, and a strong roasted grain that lingers at the end. Body is medium and mouthfeel is creamy. I was surprised at how well this one held up given that its at least 2 years old and low on the alcohol side. I would have loved to tried this fresh! Yet another great brew that Magic hat wrongly decided wasn't worthy."
"I could drive back today for more of the Heart."
"This beer was a classic back in the day. Either my palate has changed since its retirement or the recipe has. Disappointing to say the least, considering how happy I was to hear of its return."
"Verdict: I didn't even realize that this was supposed to be an oatmeal stout. It's not bad but not the best I've had. Still quite solid."
"I've had this 12 ounce bottle sitting in my house for quite some time now, and figured there was never going to be a time where the occasion seemed appropriat enough for me to open it, so I said, the hell with it, open it whenever you feel like it, and thats what i felt like tonight. Pours a nearly pitch black color, slightly brown towards the top, with a nice white lace for a head. Aromas that surfaced were nice cocoa, milk, coffee, toffee...very truffle oriented. Taste was about as nice as it comes with a stout, caramel, milk chocolate, espresso, burnt coffee bean, cherries, tobacco...it never seemed to end on new tastes to come up with. Mouthfeel was somewhat light bodied for an oatmeal stout...but that was not a bad thing...made it more drinkable in the end. I never thought that this beer would age well, but after all of this time sitting above my fridge, I have found that it has grown to be a beer to be revered in every respect of the word. I have to admit, as I was pouring it into the H.O.D tulip glass, I felt like I was saying goodbye to an old dear friend. I have a feeling that one of these days I'll stumble upon this beer in a dusty corner somewhere, but if not, It was great getting to know it. This was probably the first stout that really got me engorged in the style. Shame on MH for discontinuing it....as close to sacriledge as you can get with beer as far as Im concerned. Cheers"
"Mouthfeel is chewy, slightly sweet & robust. A tad bit thin. Slight bit of bitter hops and slick butter resound."
"When the last bottle of this is gone I shall be quite sad. It is a shame this was discontinued."
"decent stout"
"This beer pours a deep black with a rapidly disappearing light tan head. The nose has earthy, chocolate tones with a hint of hops at the end. This is not a powerful stout, but it is not a weak one by any means. It has the classic coffee, chocolate, caramelized flavors that you would expect from a stout. Although it is a bit thin feeling. It has a slight carbonization, which I appreciate. This beer goes down very smooth."
"Purchased in April, date notched March, so it may be past its time. Pours very dark, coppery highlights. Bubbly stoutish head that fades with thick lacing. Nice molasses smell on top of a bit of roastyness. Creamy taste counters more coffee notes. Despite that, its a very smooth overall package."
"Drinkability: A very pleasant drinking stout, with a lighter body that certainly fits the ""less filling"" side of the old Miller Light argument; but I say it ""tastes great," too"
"Thanks to sulldaddy for this one. Pours a dark brown with a small head that has nice retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of chocolate character with a little sweetness and a slight buttery thing. The flavor has a lot of the chocolate flavor with some roasted malts. The mouthfeel was just too thin on this one. Could use a lot more body. Tastes very nice, but I just want more thickness. Drinkability is good."
"The tart character that over-emotes in the flavor takes away from what might have been a nicely complex beer. I seem to be going against the grain here, but there are other oatmeal stouts out there, Samuel Smith's springing to mind, that I think way outdo this one. It's a bit out of balance, and that doesn't settle well with me. That's not to say I'd turn one down if offered it by someone, but you can rest assured that I will not be the one doing the offering."
"This brew comes to me through sulldaddy and clvand0. It pours a deep dark brown color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is really nice, withsome nice chocolateyness and a somewhat lacto creamyness. the flavor is a little more thin than the nose would say. The chocolate is there, with a bit of roasty goodness, but I wouldl like to see more in there. The feel is moderate, maybe a little watery for me. Overall, this is a nice brew. The flavor could be more robust and the feel could be a bit thicker. Other than that, good brew."
"Good fricking lord. This was a fantastic beer. Thanks to Sulldaddy for the opportunity. Poured a single finger brown head over a pitch black liquid. Smelled sweet. Of licorice and molasses, roast grains, some Fuggles hops, and a hint of alcohol. Tasted chocolatey delicious. Very caramel and toffee flavored with mild roast. A hint of vanilla and a hint of chocolate-covered-cherry (like the fine candies that have a cherry liquor. Gentle and nice with a somewhat dry, but highly refined chocolate flavor. Medium body and mildly carbonated. Could use a bit more evervesence, but I'm really reaching to find *something* to complain about. Gimme a 6er and I'll give you 6 emtpy bottles. Really a fantastic beer."
"I have to say that while this was a very enjoyable beer it really doesnt taste like most of the stouts Ive had. Its more like rich, earthy porter. The questionable style-classification not withstanding, this was a very good beer: smooth, roasty and very tasty. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This is an extremely drinkable beer. I think it might be the lighter-than-expected body coupled with the well balanced malt/hops that make this a very drinkable beer. Too bad I only have one more bottle of it."
"Heart Of Darkness is a flavorful, hugely drinkable (dare I say session?) stout and is one of the best offerings that I've run across from this particular brewery. Thanks to far333 for providing."
"Though I prefer the more elusive Ravell porter from Magic Hat I appreciate Heart of Darkness' pleasant drinkability, smoothness and medium complexity. I'd get it again, but not when the stronger Ravell is about."
"Maybe I just don't want to like magic hat because of the funky naming of their beers, but this was quite nice. Smooth, caramelly (sp?), fully black--just how you like it, and just enough body to make this a nice stout worthy of the $3.99 a six-pack I paid for it on sale. I would buy it again even at full retail. Enjoy--I did."
"This stout poured a dark, black color with creamy, tan foam that settled but left some lace on the glass. The smell was rather minimal but some dark malty aromas, including a touch of coffee, could be detected. The taste was full of dark malt with a bit of coffee and chocolate. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium body and moderate carbonation. Malty but on the clean side. This was a nice stout which seemed to be leaning towards a dry, Irish stout, more than an oatmeal stout."
" Finish is clean and roasty with a lingering bitter from both dark grain and hop. A very nice, easy drinkin Oat Stout."
"Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy and smooth, it had a light to medium mouth feel. Appeared to lack a bit of oomph. The currant flavor was different, but the brew appeared to lack qualities in several other areas. Ill finish the sixer eventually, but this might not be one Ill be coming back to."
"Without doubt the most impressive Magic Hat beer I've had. I realize that Magic Hat takes some heat from the craft beer community for offerings like #9, but Heart of Darkness is an excellent oatmeal stout. This beer, along with Ravel, are definitely worth purchasing. Highly recommended."
"Pours very dark with a light head. The aroma is full of roasted malts, along with some toffee and coffee. Tastes of coffee, smoke, malt, very nice together! Detected almost no hops in the aroma or taste, just enough for some balance in the taste. Medium bodied with some nice carbonation. Great beer to enjoy over the evening."
"Not a bad brew though, very tasty in fact. I enjoyed it and would definitely have it again."
"Pours deep black with ruby highlights on the edges. Nice brown head but doesnt persist. Nose is roasty with a distinct nuttiness from the oatmeal. The taste starts off sweet and malty with a nice smooth and creamy flavor of oatmeal followed by a sharp roasted malt flavor in the finish bitterness is average and most hop flavor/aroma if any is there is covered with the roasted malt.The body is a little thinner than I like for a stout, medium bodied but smooth. Overall a good drinkable stout with lots of flavor."
"Pours a dark as night black, with a tan head. Smells of chocolate, coffee. Tastes of coffee, malt, and hints of chocolate. Smooth mouthfeel, a great session beer. Highly recommended!"
"I have had this before (bottled) and should have reviewed it then...I would have been much more kind. I have a 5 pack now and will enjoy them as much as I can."
"What a treat to have this on tap. One of the more hoppy stouts I've had, but a good representation of an oatmeal stout."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a rich malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and some black malts along with a very good hop aroma that actually gives it a refreshing quality. The taste is awesome as well. It has a very smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes a bit bitter and hoppy in the aftertaste. The oatmeal adds a slightly dry texture on the tongue. It is rich and creamy; very nice. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great stout. It has everything; a great drinker."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Finish contains coffee and chocolate tones that linger briefly on the tongue. Drinkability is OK, but there was something about this brew that did not excite me at all to have another."
"oily aroma with walnuts?, had a nutty wiff there for a bit then faded away. smooth first sip, creamy mouthfeel followed by a prickly bit of carbonation around the inside of your mouth and smoothes out at the end. bit of roasted grain in the finish. very very drinkable, very excellent oatmeal stout. IMO."
"Drinkability: Great after dinner sipper."
"Drinkability and Overall: So far I've been unimpressed with the beers my friend brought me from Magic Hat. This one is the best I've had, and definitly doesn't follow the trend of the other beers from this brewery. A solid, strong, and very drinkable oatmeal stout that is one to try."
"This is a beer that Malto brought down to Dallas and is a damn fine stout. I particularly like its sweetness and wish I had a couple more. Hey Malto, I will trade you a couple Texas Tornados for a few more of these!!!"
"A very dark brown/black beer with ruby highlights. Has a small dark beige head that leaves quickly. There is a tasty sweet malt aroma with a good coffee background. The flavor starts with a strong bittersweet chocolate character and that slips nicely into a sweet licorice finish. The mouthfeel seemed a little thin for what I expected."
"This is a great stout and one beer that I am glad to see on the shelves. I didn't realize until recently that this was a Magic Hat Winter seasonal."
"This brew pours a pretty opaque black color with just a hint of ruby hues and a firm offwhite head that leaves a nice lace. Aromas show off bits of bittersweet chocolate, hints of roasty dark malts and oats, and an array of coffees. For flavor this brew starts off quite creamy with oats and roast like flavors competing on the main stage. Following a slight coffee / chocolate tone makes itself present with just a tiny hint of sweetness and a slight charcoal almost smoke like flavor (which doesn't work well for me). The oats make their way back into the picture after this, with also a slight toffeesque like flavor finding its way into the picture. The finish to this brew is nicely bitter with a semi astringent roast flavor that lingers on the tongue. This beer has a nice mouthfeel to it, being fairly light bodied and creamy, with a nice slightly biting carbonation. Overall a decent session stout but nothing worth going out of your way to pick up."
"Heart of Darkness was served from a 12 oz. bottle adorned with very n(eye)ce label. In a pint glass, the beer was black with tawny edge accents, and was topped by a thin brown head. The nose was excellent, offering roasty, lighly smokey chocolate maltiness and strong enticing accents of vanilla and sasparilla. The stout tasted good as well, with a lightly roasty choco-coffee malt base that opened up with cola and sasparilla notes and finished with yummy, vaguely smokey, bittered choco-cola-coffee flavors. The body was full and smooth, and the carbonation was appropriate. Heart of Darkness is a very good, balanced and tasty session stout."
"Poured a pitch black inky darkness with a solid caramel-colored head that laces all over the glass. Aromas are roasted coffee, caramel, toffee, and bittersweet chocolate. Flavor falls short. Starts with a flavorful and smooth dose of thick stouty flavors of roasted coffee beans and grain, but quickly dies off to a unpleasant, almost sour aftertaste. Roasted nut aftertaste. Slightly thin mouthfeel. A drinkable stout, but one that I'd had much bigger hopes for when I started."
"The first time I tried this beer I turned to my buddy... ""Oh... my... god... This may be the best beer I've ever tasted."" Still holds true... this is one of the greatest stouts in my opinion and I would drink this constantly if I could... would take this over Guinness any day of the week. Superb."
"Tastes of dark roasted malts, bitter coffee, and chocolate. Great amount of flavor. Found this one pleasantly surprising for Magic Hat, as there was sucha hub-bub about them that when some bottles showed up being held for a buddy at a local pub I was kinda excited, then tasted, then felt like I had waited all year for a carnival that showed up with one ride. This was yummers. Very smooth and creamy, full of flavor. Not too heavy or complex, not too intense. Good stuff."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Black in color with a very thin, dark tan head. Aroma is slightly roasty with hints of bittersweet chocolate. The mouthfeel is hearty but not overly so. Decently roasty up front with a chocolatey sweetness in the middle and a fairly sharp hop bitterness at the finish."
"Great looking heart of darkness color, dark tan head. Smell of roasted oats and coffee. Taste is nice, with licorice, coffee, and roasted bitterness. Mouthfeel is very weak and watery, however, leaving me quite disappointed. Not bad, but there are much better oatmeal stouts out there."
"Great stout, thanks PBrian and Beerluvr for these beauties."
"Poured into a pint glass, the black brew formed a finger of brown foam. It had a roasty coffee aroma and a flavor that was only slightly more complex. There were chocolate notes on top of the the roasted malt base. I wouldn't call the malts burnt, but the roasting was a bit stronger than I tend to prefer, influencing the drink ability score. The beer was lighter bodied than I would have expected."
"Nicely executed stout with a solid burnt malt foundation that lends the beer much of its character. Will look forward to rediscovering this stout"
"Notes: This brew had great rings. the haed does not stick around too long, but the lacing around the glass leaves some nice thin rings."
"Beef Notes: A truly great beer from one of the best breweries in the US. I will be returning to it again and again and again and..."
"One of my favorite oatmeal stouts, and probably my favorite 12oz offering from Magic Hat. My only complaint is that this isn't offered year round, even though some package stores try to pretend."
"Beer pours out an asphalt black, with a slight frothy brown head. Aroma is very roasty with just a bit of coffee and a hint of bitter hops. Taste is full of roasted malt along with pronounced flavors of coffee and chocolate, and thin wisps of smoke. Very smooth and creamy throughout, with a nice hop bitterness firming it up toward the end. Body is quite medium, not heavy at all. The HOD is a very drinkable stout indeed, good offering from the Hat."
"Brew pours very dark, I would say black in color. Nice size head that dissipates pretty quickly but has excellent lacing. It has a very nice semi sweet smell with coffee and smoked aromas. The taste is excellent, a real nice tasting stout. It is a little bitter but goes very well with this brew. Can taste the smoke like roasted flavors with a hint of butterscotch? Also seems to have a smoky fruit taste that goes along with it very well. Has nice carbonation and over all a very nice beer. I think it is one of the best that I have had from Magic Hat. Labeled as a oatmeal stout, but I have a hard time associating oatmeal with it, but regardless it is a phenomenal brew in my book."
"Excellent lacing. Good roasty nose, chocolate and coffee and liquorice (oh my!). Roasted malts escort the chocolate and expresso across the tongue, and into a mild earty hop finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I like, and I don't sense the rounding of the oatmeal. Mouthfeel aside, this a good stout. Don't be afraid of the dark."
"The taste is most excellent. Lots of big dark malt, coffee, deeply roasted and burnt nut. Carbonation is a little too noticeable but tolerabe, and mouthfeel is on the medium oily side. Low ABV makes this a easy drinker for the long term. Nice job MH."
"Would be a session beer if the flavors didn't overwhelm my palate after the second one."
"Pours a mighty fine black obsidian color, just perfect. Head could be more thick though. Smell is of oats, malt and honey. Taste is, in a word, BAM. Oats and malts and roasted coffee combine in a complex roll in your mouth, potent from the instant I touch the liquid with my mouth until seconds after swallowing. One of the strongest flavored stouts Ive ever had, kickass good. This would go great with a heavy, full bodied meal. Man I love this stuff. Is it the fact that I have matching Magic Hat pint glasses to drink out of that make it this good? Donno, but drink this stuff!"
"Good black beer with a sandy light tan head that lingers. Good roastiness in the aroma. I'm getting charcoal and espresso in both the aroma and the flavor. The roasty notes come in heavy up tops but fades into a light chocolate and bitterness in the short finish. Seems like it needs something else in there to support the roast up top. Still a good stout, though."
"A fine winter offering from Magic Hat. This one is definitely a hit."
"weird note: as i reach the bottom of the glass, and the beer warms, the hops have started to smell a little like weed. hmmm."
"This is a wonderful stout from the folks at MH. It pours out a super dark, opaque black colour with a very fluffy, tan/cocoa coloured head of foam. The aromas are of chocolate, caramel, dark roasted malts, slight bittering hops, and some more cocoa! The taste is very chocolatey and the roasted malt flavor is bready and excellent. The mouthfeel is thick, but just right for this type of stout and the drinkability is excellent as well. Wow, this is one of the best beers that Magic Hat makes. Hands Down."
"overall, a decent stout that I could enjoy slowly. #9 is still the supreme beer from Magic Hat."
"Drinkability: A nice, lighter stout. Could easily enjoy a group of these."
"From the eyeball label to the black as night pour, this brew was visually appealing. There was a stubby but long last head. This stout was smooth drinking, with no powerful carbonation present. Words for this are: deep sweet malt. One of my favorite brew from Magic Hat"
"Dark chocolate, bitter espresso, raisins, roast grain, & a decent hop bite. Tasty hop burps. On the thin side of full bodied, smooth, with moderate carbonation."
"appearance. Taste was light but with an excellent body and toasted malt presence. Well rounded in mouthfeel and very easy to drink. Surprising brew...didn't feel like 5.3 abv....more like a session beer. Definitely worth trying."
"""Don't mock a Soul hundreds of years Old."" I'm sure that cap quote will keep me up at night, pondering the meaning (as will the creepy staring eye on the label), but, all MH funkyness aside, this is a really interesting brew. Great chocolate malt flavors with a bit of coffee mocha, flavors you would expect from a sludge-brew, yet this beer is quite light and almost airy and somehow avoids being watery. A lighweight stout with lots of flavor - a description one would normally find mutually exclusive."
"Not a bad stout, but one I feel is a bit on the timid side. Allowing it to warm slightly definitely helped the cause. A drinkable brew indeed, but there are much better stouts to be had."
"I could sip and savor all year. Exceptional taste and one to find."
"Poured a very dark mahogany brown color, which the light just barely shone through. Nice rich and creamy head. Roasted chocolates and coffee in the aroma. Not much body. A watery stout here. The roasted grains leave a bitterness in the back of the throat. Some perfumey and toasted flavors come out as you drink. This is a nice light stout. Not very rich, but enjoyable."
"Probably my favorite Magic Hat brew of the ones I've had so far. A solid stout that stands up well to some of the British ones, and one I definitely hope to have again!"
"Pours a deep black with a medium off white sticky head,the aroma is chocolaty and kinda smoky smell was not that great to me.The taste is chocolaty and nutty with some definent hoppy bitterness in the finish.Not a bad beer but average compared to alot of standards."
"Appears completely dark opaque until held up directly toward the light in order to unveil deep ruby edges around this brew with scattered lacing formed by a thin tan moccha colored head. Aroma contains deep notches of chocolate, coffee, tones along with a slightly burnt fruit tones caramelized down to a reduction. The flavors a reminscient of a dry Irish but with so much more character and flavor the deep dry roasts are present, but in addition a cocoa infused cappucino with a sour acidic tone finishes out the robust flavor of this stout similar to an Imperial but lacking body and alcohol to label it so. Flavors are there including the fruit tones mouthfeel is full but by no means chewy which adds to the drinkability of this outstanding session stout no cloying carbonation or flavor profiles here just a well made true to the style stout."
"I bashed Guinness so I guess I can't sing the praises of a basic stout like this. But I guess Heart of Darkness just seems a little more refined. I'm wasn't born a stout man, and unless there's more than just the basic elements in them, I can't say they're something I thoroughly enjoy. I'm not going to get this again, but I can't say I'm disappointed. It's good for a stout, but a plain ol' stout ain't nothing special."
"Thanks to jeffboo for the bottle who got it from a traveling buddy."
"A great beer. Another gem from Magic Hat. I'll be sad if I ever move out of New England."
"Light brown/khaki head. The beer itself is jet-black. Great lacing. Smells incredibly smoky. I heard the bartender tell someone this was a ""smoked porter", and it's easy to believe. It tastes pretty light, and heavily of toasted oats. Great, tingly mouthfeel. Feels light, and is highly drinkable."
"This is actually a good drinking stout, reminiscent of some of the lighter dry irish stouts. Taken in that context, with the dryness of this beer, both the mouthfeel and drinkability are right on. I just expected a bit more body in the mouth. This beer may be the 'Heart of Darkness', but it really lights up my heart. A very enjoyable brew that I look forward to enjoying again. A dual thanks goes out on this one. One to Deb for Beering this Forward to me, and a second to Loren for providing a few more to enjoy later. Can't beat great BA's. They make every beer more enjoyable."
"After having written the review just below for the bottled version, I went to my favorite beer bar and found the draught version, and immediately asked for a pint. I have to say (and the rest of the draught reviews seem to agree) that the draught version is similar in all respects except the flavor and aroma. The flavor is milder and smoother, and the hop flavor takes over. The hints of chocolate and coffee seem to be lost in both flavor and aroma. The head also seemed to run away too quickly. Still a very drinkable and enjoyable stout, but the bottled version really stands out in the crowd, where the draught version is just another oatmeal stout."
"Pours a dark, almost black with just a hint of red color with a small creamy tan head. A bit of vigor is required to get much of any head. The head settles to a bit of lace that remains nicely. The smell is dominantly of roasted chocolate malts, with just a hint of caramel. The taste is a nice complexity of the roasted malt flavors giving an almost smokey character to the brew, yet there is just a touch of hops for balance. The mouthfeel is pleasant and each taste finishes with a nice roasted flavor. I would almost call this a medium body stout; it really isn't heavy at all. Very pleasant, interesting, and drinkable."
"My favorite Magic Hat to date, though I hear good thinks about Blind Faith."
"Not my favorite stout, but a good one. We all need to get in touch with the dark side sometimes. Drink enough of these, and the eye on the label starts to follow you around the room..."
"I was eagerly anticipating this and while it was very easy drinking, it seemed to lack the weight of some of the better stouts I've had...Pours a charcoal black with a little tan head...nose is soft and small...some java tones and some cocoa....body is thin for a stout...maybe medium at best..let's call it on the thin side of medium...taste has some coffee notes and dark cocoa notes but overall it isn't a powerhouse of flavor...finishes on a dry note which is a nice close...overall this certainly isn't bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase this one..My first Magic Hat experience rates slightly above average...."
"It was two dollar pint night, and I spied this on tap. Poured a nice dark color, a pretty good head. Smooth, a taint sweet, and just a hint of coffee. It went down quickly, leading me to question, is it a stout? Maybe a sub-stout, bordering on a porter. Regardless, this was an excellent beer."
"Overall, a very respectable stout, one of the best that I regularly have the pleasure of drinking."
"Color is fully black, with a big, tan head. Aroma is full of all of the things I enjoy and expect from any stout worth it's salt: rich, roasty espresso notes. Mouthfeel is full, sweet, rich, with loads of beautiful, sweet notes, and bitter ones, too. Tasty, toasty, roasty, with a long, luscious finish. A fine and tasty stout, with a slightly sweet aftertaste, and just a touch syrupy. An excellent, but ordinary, stout, and I give up props to UncleJimbo and purplehops, my twin EastCoast providers. Though, I may suggest, that Joseph Conrad might have something more sinister in mind."
"pours a deep black with a thin head that quickly dissolves yet never completely disappears. predominantly smells of coffee with hints of chocolate. there is a definite roasted flavour here as well as smoked malts and coffee as mentioned above. though certainly not light, much easier going down than would appear. not nearly as heavy as other stouts. overall, one hell of a stout and one hell of a beer in general. my favourite in the magic hat family."
"Wow, a lot of people have reviewed this beer in the past few days. Opaque black with ruby edges. Head was small but did not vanish. Appealing aroma of roasted barley, chocolate, coffee, grasses. Sharp tasting, like many of MH's brews, with a bold assertive flavor that informs the drinker, hey we are not dicking around here. Roastiness takes a while to settle in, very warming and invigorating. Some light smokiness in the background, a little bit of greasiness too but not repugnant. Hops are grassy, drying, and refresingly bitter. A perfect balance between bitter and sweet. Other reviews have talked about creaminess but I'm not getting it. I would say this is a bit slick for a stout, maybe even a little thin. Stickiness is appropriate and delightful. Each sip requires another, a very drinkable beer. An exquisite beer for a snowy winter's day."
"This is just like the Conrad novel. Dark! Really dark with a thin tan head. The smell was the best part of the beer because it reminded me of one of my favorite things to do. Take a big whif from a bag of freshly ground coffee. There were also some smells that made it smell a little like damp earth too. Excellent smell! The taste had little hints but wasn't quite as good, but the thickness made up for that. Magic Hat has a winner here."
"true to the darkness claim, but had a small, short-lived head: after a few seconds the top of the beer looked strangely like an oil slick. Decent aroma mostly made up of roasted and burnt malts and a wee bit of oatmeal. The flavor is too one-dimensional for me (and too much black patent bitterness). It seems to start very similar to how it finishes, with little change in between. I prefer more complexity in my oatmeal stouts, but being Magic Hat the brewers were probably going for a session-style oatmeal stout. And for that, it is fine. An average beer in my book."
"Heart of Darkness, thanks to Kunzbrew for sample. A black beer with some red glow while backlit. The aroma is huge, lots of chocolate,roasted grain, and raisins in this tan foam. The flavors are of espresso,and bitter chocolate that lingers on when the glass is set down. Unfortunately the body is too thin and flavor too dry to get the maximum flavor out of the ingredients.A little more sweetness and the body filled out and this one could stand out. But until then.........."
"A 'thank you' goes out to Mike (kunzbrew) for sending me this one in a beer trade!"
"Not a bad brew from Magic Hat. I might put this into my beer purchasing rotation under the less frequent."
"This beer poured with a tight tan head over a dark brown with reddish highlighted liquid. Very nice aromas of coffee and chocolate over a background of roasty grains. The taste is a bit thin in the mouthfeel department, with flavors of highly roasted malts...not much in the way of sweetness, or oatmealy smoothness. A nice level of hoppiness mixes with the roasted grains to lend a very sufficient and enjoyable bitterness to the mix. Things finish up on a dry and roasty note. For the price ($5.99) it's a very nice, tasty stout...easy to drink in quantity."
"Pours an almost jet black with garnet highlights and comes with a nice tan two-finger head. The aromas of roasted malts and chocolate are dominant and make your mouth water. Holy Kamoly or however you spell it! This stuff is smooth and mirrors the aromas along with perfectly blended hops to make one great tasting brew! The mouthfeel is medium bodied yet finishes just slightly thinner and with a burnt chocolate flavor. Very good brew! Thanks to BIGDEB for sending me this brew! Cheers!"
"Overall a nice blend of flavors but nothing really special. IMHO it could use a richer and thicker body and a little more aroma. I wouldn't turn one down but at the same time I wouldn't go out of my way for one."
"Mint! I got a free Magic Hat pint glass with the six pack of this favorite brew of mine. Pours our black as black can be. Tastes oh so good! Not quite as nice as on tap, but I won't complain because this is just such a great beer! Thank you Magic Hat!"
"Heart of Darkness poured out a solid black with great carbonation and appearance.The aroma for me was coffee and chocolate,and maybe a bit of smoke.The first sip was all smoke and coffee in flavor.Starting to leave trails of lace with each sip.Kind of an oil like mouthfeel.Not much carbonation in the actual mouthfeel.An earthy,peat,smoke,and coffee taste.The texture seemed a bit watery for a stout.Overall very good but not great IMO."
"An easy drinking stout, very typical of the style. I was a little dissapointed, I was hoping the Magic Hat people would do something special with this one."
"Special thanks to pbrian for sending this on my way!"
"Thumbs Up to BigDeb for this Sample - Nice One Deb."
"This truely captures the essence of a stout.This brew was black as the night with a small creamy tannish head.Belgian lace left its mark all the way to the bottom of the pint glass.Roasted barley and a sweet carmel chocolate smell. Extremely smooth and easy to drink. Full bodied the way a stout should be."
"Almost black. Very, very, very dark red. Pretty head of big bubbles and some bulges made up of leaner bubbles, both tan in color, decorated the top of this beer. Funky lace stuck to the sides of the glass. Coffee and some fruitiness from hops, maybe raspberry-like, make up the nose of this elegant stout. Tasted of nicely toasted grains and either wood or nuts, I havent made up my mind. Some charcoal flavor exists as one would expect, but it doesnt add much bitterness as is often the case. A tiny sourness pops up every now and then just adding to the complexity of the brew. Extremely creamy in the mouth. Overall, very good stout. A nice change from overly assertive stouts."
"Mike"
"Ahhh the heart of darkness. One of my favorite beers of all time. An excellent dark beer without the dark beer lingering aftertaste. A beer that even non darkbeer drinkers will still drink. I always manage to pick up a couple of cases and some growlers whenever I am back home in Vermont."
"Thank you to BIGDEB499 for sending this my way."
"Drinkability & Notes: Oh what a wonderful stout ... roasted flavours are very rich, a hefty brew to be had. A stout lovers snowy day dream it’s a seasonal brew and thankfully it has come back around."
"On tap at Cambridge Common. Black with a tinge of dark ruby around the edges. Three quarter inch fine bubbled tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate and coffee, with a hint of earthy hops. Light carbonation, medium-heavy body. Creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of coffee are up front, with some chocolate milky sweetness and a nice subtle hop presence to balance. This is a top-drawer New England stout."
"Very tiny 1/4 inch head that did not last more than 10 seconds. Dark as night. The smell is coffee and chocolate malt, very nice. The taste is very unique. Dry, complex yet well balanced. The finish is dry with a bit of malt. I would love to try this on tap."
"Black with some faint light coming around the edges a creamy light brown head with a strong lace.  Great coffee and dark chocolate aromas with only a slight roasted/burnt bitterness.  Roasted coffe starts out on the tongue but makes a transition into some strong bittersweet chocolate flavors.  Silky smooth on the tongue and exceptionally creamy.  This brew is definitely one of the most drinkable full flavored stouts out there.  Definitely one of my favorites from Magic Hat, this is one first class brew.  Thanks to Bierman9 for the sample."
"a fine stout by a fine brewery. magic hat seems to be a pretty good brewer of beers. i am a fan of a few of their beers, and this one is the best. it is dark, coffee flavored and simply delicious, just like a fine woman"
"Let me first say that I love stouts, they are my favorite style of beer, so I might be somewhat biased. Anyway, I think very highly of Magic Hat's creamy stout. It is nearly black with a nice short brown head. Very strong coffee and chocolate tastes. Not the best stout out there (ie Sammy Smith Oatmeal Stout) but definitely a great beer."
"This stout has a thick black full body and a slow forming creamy tan head.  Strong roasted and some chocolate aroma introduce a smooth roasted dark malty flavor that is not too sweet, but not at all bitter.  This is a very drinkable and very enjoyable brew."
"This ""almost black"" beer throws a small brown head with little retention.  Not a lot on the nose.  Maybe some slight roasted tones.  Nice creamy, velvety mouthfeel.  The tastes in this stout are pretty subdued.  Nothing overwhelming.  The body is light to medium (thin for a stout).  Some of the slight tastes I pick up are sweet chocolate and java.  There is a bitterness on the finish, but not much before that.  A pretty average stout in my opinion."
"Nice looking brew -- deep ruby/black, with a nice, thick tan head. The smell is throwing me off (allergies, maybe?); it smells like a glass of milk. Odd. Taste is better, though, with roasted coffee, a touch of chocolate, and a creaminess that makes the beer feel warm and rich. Finish is also creamy, and slightly bitter. If not for the funky smell, this would be a top-notch stout (and, to be honest, I'll put up with the funky smell and will drink this again)."
"Dry, complex and damn tasty ... a real nice stout."
"This is simply the finest stout made in New England.  Beutiful roasted coffee aroma.  Starts off a little sweet but finishes crisp and dry.  Very drinkable."
"inky black with a great dark roasted coffee flavour. I love this beer. The only bad thing i can say about it is that it's not a year round."
