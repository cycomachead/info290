"I have to admit, I set my expectations quite low for this one, just by looking at the clear bottle. Couldn't be more wrong! The beer looks pitch black with small head after the pour, though  with great retention. Nice. Smells quite interesting: the usual roasted malt and chocolate tones are supported by some kind of acidic aroma, which is reminding me of dark fruits, which I find quite pleasant. In the mouth feels very creamy with small amount of bubbles. The taste is pretty unusual for a stout. Usual coffee and a hint of chocolate are there but the backbone is still sweet, acidic, dark fruity. Lasts vey long revealing some small amount of bitterness.  Would buy this again!"

"Poured from a bottle into a chilled glass. Malt aroma with cocoa influence.  Very pleasant. Colour is black with tan head, and I mean ""no light gets through the glass"" black. Taste has very little bitterness. Sweet malt flavour with a definite chocolate presence. Mouthfeel is medium-light and very smooth. A stout this sweet is a pleasant surprise."

"Overall, I have been pleased by the two Belhaven products that I have tried, I enjoy Stouts, and I wouldn't hesitate to pull this one again."
"Good try Scotland at making a stout...taste like bud but dark"

"Sweeter for a stout. Clear glass bottle is the downside."
"Pours black as a starless night.  World Class head volume, outstanding lacing and retention.  Light nose of roast and chocolate over a slight mineral note.  Heavy light body with just a hint of smooth texture.  Above average carbonation level with a bit of effervescence in the middle and finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is reasonably intense, a bit complex and very well balanced.  It begins with chocolate sweetness which is a blend of bittersweet dark and milk characteristics.  The middle has a very subtle bitterness from roast and hops over a distinct classic mineral note (think chocolate soda).  The finish is a slow fade of rich sweet chocolate with hints of vanilla.  This is an excellent choice to introduce someone to stouts."
"04/05/13 At Rattle N Hum on tap (nitro). Usual smoothness from most nitro pours. Extremely light body but not watery. Aroma is subtle & indicative of the shy flavor profile. Nice balance of sweet & bitter. No hint of the contemporary adds of vanilla/coffee/chocolate, etc. Listings show conflicting ABV but this tastes shy so I'll assume it's @ 4.5%. If that's the case I could see this as a pleasant session companion."
"Mouthfeel isn't as rich as I like in a stout."

"AMAZING Stout!!!! very underrated....LOVE IT."

"Bachelor Party-Palooza 2014 (Part 1) concludes, still believing that when in a Scottish-style pub, do as the Scots do and drink up some Belhaven, especially the Stout.  This stuff pours a slightly murky midnight sienna topped by a finger of sandstone foam.  The nose comprises roasted malts, dark cocoa powder, light treacle, and a hint of vanilla.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a bit of mild charcoal smoke and a healthy amount of straight-up toffee.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy feel.  Overall, a nice, enjoyable stout, a fitting punctuation mark on this delightful meal and visit."

"despite the sweetness a nicely balanced brew - well worth a try"
"Very good brew for a midwinter drink. A good sipping beer. Reminds me of a Russian Imperial Stout."

"This, along with Magic Hat Heart of Darkness, is probably the best English stout I've ever had. Just wish it didn't come in a clear glass bottle- it doesn't seem to have affected the taste, though."

"500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/20/2011. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, toffee, herbal, raisin, plum, and roast/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, herbal, raisin, plum, and roast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, herbal, raisin, plum, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with an awesome roasted malt bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome English stout! All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"330ml bottle. Thistle glass. Black color headed by tan, creamy & wide crown. Oat, chocolate, toasted & caramel malt aromas rounded by earthy, woody & smoked notes. Roasted, creamy & flavorful maltiness is pierced by thin stream of chocolate. Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. Silky & velvety palate. Gentle bitterness & very subtle licorice hues in the middle balance creamy & sweet flavors. Long sweet finish & dark cocoa on the aftertaste. Smooth & sunctuous beer for a paused & long drink. Well integrated ABV."

"Overall - Solid flavor that's right up my alley, but let down by a fairly lifeless and thin mouthfeel. In all, a good beer, but for the price I'd likely look elsewhere for my stout kick."

"Color is black with a little amber light coming through the top of the glass. Slight tan head that that keeps a light cover over the top of the beer. Smell - light chocolate with a good amount of nuttiness and very light roasted malt. Taste - Semi sweet chocolate with good amount of nuttiness just like the aroma. Some earthiness or wood from the hops. A different take on a stout that is well done."

"I'm a huge Guinness lover and this was like a Guinness but with more flavor. I would highly recommend this beer. Sweet, not bitter, not hoppy. Very smooth, fairly heavy drink. I'm going to start hunting around for these bad boys to have at the house."

"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours dark, dark brown with a thin tan head with light lacing. Aroma of sweet and toasted malt. Flavor is dark roasted malts and a hint of chocolate. Dry malty middle and abrupt finish with slight hops and malt. Moderately creamy. A pleasant, low key English stout."

"O- Solid offering. Not amazing, but it is quite a long way north of ""ok""."
"O- A very good stout, Everything but the smell of the stout was actually really awesome. The flavor coupled with the price will mean that I probably end up purchasing this stout again sometime."

"Picked up a $5 half liter at Best Yet. Cool beer, poured black with brown highlights. I might call this a foreign export stout for the lighter body. There are sweet caramel cocoa notes up front, then a dry smoky and roasted finish cleans out the beer. There are hints of toffee and cola mixed in for an unusual (and delicious) stout. Give this a stout."
""
""
"Overall, this is a nicely balanced stout. Complex yet not overpowering in any sense. Deceptively easy drinking but definitely a strong ABV. Another excellent brew from Belhaven!"
""
""
"I have been a big fan of Belhaven Scottish Ale for a long time, when I found this on the shelf I was quite excited. I wasn't disappointed. It poured very dark garnet/black. Good off-white head and nice malty aroma. From the first sip I was impressed. Nice mouthfeel, not too chewy but nice body. The flavor was chocolate, vanilla and slight roastiness. Truly, even though the bottle says Belhaven Scottish Stout, it is a Porter, a strong porter, but still a porter. They even say so on their website. It does not have the coffee overtones associated with stouts. This one of my favorites. Slainte!"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good, although the flavors don't quite come together."
""
""
""
"Yep. This is a sweet beer. Deal with it. Unlike many other reviewers, I don't expect every beer I drink to be hoppy or bitter. It's nice to have a Sweet malt beer sometimes and this doesn't disappoint there. For me it goes down easy and tastes better as it warms up. Great for in the winter sitting at a pub on a cold evening. Malty sweet dark tasty scotch import. I was lucky to get it on tap during beer week. I'll have one more please! 7.0 abv hits you aftershock."
"O: Not my favorite of the different styles of stout but this is avery nice example of the style and a very enjoyable beer. Hides the alcohol very well and I could easily sip of these all afternoon while watching some soccer."
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a below average English Stout. It seems like most of the English beers I have tried lately all have this super sweet malt profile that seems to take over any features of the particular style and dominate the aroma and taste, that is pretty much what happened here. This beer didn't have good drinkability the sweetness is far too high for me to finish the whole bottle, glad I got my brother to help me out. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked like a proper English Stout. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, it was just way too sweet for the style and the sweetness seemed to drown out most of the other flavors and aromas. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's pretty cheap but even at the bargain price of $1.39 a bottle it doesn't really warrant a repeat purchase, not recommended. This beer turned out to be a let down, I just don't get how sweet all these English styled beers I have tried are and almost all of them seem to have that, maybe I just don't like the style but I have had some that aren't so I know it can be done. Not a good first impression for this brewery, I don't think I will be revisiting them again anytime soon."
"Overall I am not too impressed with this beer. The mouthfeel is off and it is a little too sweet."
""
"This is a very dark beer. I couldn't even see threw the drops the dripped on the counter. Had to really get my noise in to it to get the smell of coffee and malt. The taste was a bit better got some chocolate, and roast flavors, good beer but not much to have it really stand out from other Stouts, really didn't get that ""Scottish"" style from this one. But as I said not bad."
""
""
"The only downside was the bitterness present at the end of each drink. What starts with a very good look and smell; ends with a pretty strong dose of bitter. I know that this is typical to the style, but it hurts what is otherwise a very good beer."
"Pours a dark ale with two fingers of latte foam, this falls slowly to a quilt of the same leaving lots of cobwebs. Very roasty nose; plenty of dark, coffee, charcoal malts and even nearly a savory, almost salty smell. Really a rich nose. Very roasty flavor as well with stone fruit, umami, coffee, oatmeal, some catty hops and even a little thyme flavor. I like this beer so far, really crushable as a stout. A little short of full bodied with moderate, but short lived carb and a semi dry finish. This is a really nice beer with hi potential for being paired with fire broiled red meats, taters, and some veggies. Good stuff."
""
"O: Delicious. It is more Americanized than I expected."
"O: This isn't a bad beer at all. At $5 a 22oz, it's a good value as well."
""
""
"Lighter in the mouthfeel than most of this brew's American cousins, but it does not detract. Unusual to have a good beer out of a clear bottle, but I didn't detect any skunkiness. A solid stout that I would gladly have again."
""
""
""
""
"An easy drinking sipper for a Dogfish Head snifter, Belhaven Scottish Stout would also stand up to a meal."
""
""
""
"A nice *porter*, not the stoutish dryness."
"Tastes much more robust--dry hops, acidic yeast, and a sweet chocolately malt. It begins with a surprisingly nice node of pasteurization which moves into chocolate, then a blend of sour and dry. Very nicely balanced."
"O: Good stout, the balanced smokiness sets it apart. Well worth a try."

"-Overall 4.0: Unexpectedly excellent stout. Smooth and drinkable, without the heaviness one usually expects from a stout. However, all the excellent stout characteristics are present and are very rewarding. Recommended."
""

"O: My first English Stout, and a good one at that. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Light but complex flavors, great mouthfeel."

"Has this beer at the Pub in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. It was served in the traditional stout pint glass with a one inch tan head. The head is thick and foamy guaranteed to leave a stout mustache. The color of this stout reminds me of pitch and has the thickness and consistency of molasses. All of this leads to my first quaff of beer that is very smooth with flavors of chocolate, vanilla, and a hint of licorice. This beer is much more intense and creamy tha Guinness. Really love this beer."
""
"This is a pretty good example of a simpler, rounded european-style stout, although it's hop presence could step forward more than it does. Solid effort from Belhaven."
"Aroma is smoky, like a good stout, with a floral hint and tones of coffee and wood. It pours a deep warm sable that is a little translucent at the very edges and has a thick, fine-bubbled, fairly persistent light tan head that ""pillows"" in the middle after a bit. Smoky flavor has woody, unsweet chocolate and fruity tones. Firm-bodied texture has a fair amount of fizz and leaves a burnt wood finish. Overall, not too shabby."
"This poured out as a nice deep blackish brown color with a decent tan head on top. The smell of the beer has some light chocolate aromas along with some earthy roasted aromas too. The taste of the beer is on the sweeter side, not much bitterness in here at all. The mouthfeel isn't overly heavy at all, it's probably medium bodied and has a light amount of carbonation. Overall this beer is decent. I would drink it again if I came across it."
"not real experinced on stouts...but this beer was really smooth...good hopiness...good bit of smoke/nutty smell...chocolate flavor prevelant...not much head though...alcohol taste not a factor, (which is good in my book)...overall one of the top stouts i have had..."
"A little lighter bodied than I'd like, but nice flavors nevertheless in this stout. I'm also not a fan of the clear glass bottle. I'd prefer my beers not to be light struck, thank you very much. Pours very dark brown, approaching black with a somewhat thin head and no real lacing to speak of. Nicely balanced aromas of roasted grain, cocoa, some vinous notes, and perhaps a touch of smoke. The taste adds a creamy note and a touch of malt to the whole gentle package. Quite quaffable, and fairly surprising that this is as strong as it is. Very pleasant."
"O- I received this beer from my father-in-law after he picked it up on a trip. I don't know how much he paid for the bottle, but I could definitely drink more of this if the price is not outrageous. It had a great balance of smoky peat and chocolate flavors."
"Drink- I have been trying to track down some styles and this was another one I had missed. This was quite good with a lot of chocolate coming through. The hops add a nice note and depth. Overall a really nice beer."
"Soft and chocolatey. Understated for 7%. Great body, but too sweet with milk stout characteristics; it could really use some roast or hops for balance."
"I'm giving this beer a B+ its good. but not the best stout I've had."
"This is a very good stout, and definitely worth trying. I would go as far as saying that it is a 'must-try' for every stout lover."
"Overall: Easy drinking. Full flavors don't go overboard, has that Scottish peat in a sweet malt base. Nice stuff."
"Wow! This is why I love stouts. Such rich and complex flavors that satisfy like no other beer will. Bellhaven delivers and then some with this exceptional offering."
"O - A solid middle of the road stout that gave me what I expected to get. There wasn't anything overly complex or different about it, but I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"Beer style 101/104. This one pours a light to medium in body Coca Cola brown that turns to black when it fills my glass. It has a beautiful and sudsy beige, two finger head that sits atop the beer for sometime. The head looks really nice. The aromas featured are smooth dark roasted malts, soft chocolate, and a sharp hop like bitterness. After awhile the subtle chocolaty aromas prevail, and in almost a milky manner. It is initially sweet and bitter, milky, chocolaty with a nice light, light roast finish. The flavors blend well together and make for a nice, light drinking stout. The body is pretty light for a stout but it drinks very smoothly. I'm a fan. Overall this is a fine beer and worth the $4.50 or so per bottle."
"Overall this is a good stout, well worth trying again."
"T: Smoke, ash, roasted coffee and skunk. I'd be interested in trying this one again if I knew it wasn't going to be skunked."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark ruby brown with a 2 inch khaki head that fades to an oily film. Nice latticework of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of coffee grounds, cocoa powder, dark malt, and slight soy sauce. Taste is of dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, and slight coffee. A slight roast bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that I have always seen on the shelf but never picked up until now. My first English stout and a very good one to start with. I will be drinking more of these for sure."
"Overall: A fairly sweet Scottish stout with a great mouthfeel. A nice surprise, as I wasn't really expecting too much out of this one. I'm Belhaving a hoot over here!"
"D: Good brew but not memorable."
"This brew pours a nice black color with two fingers of head that fairly quickly recede. Aroma is of rich roasted coffee, chocolate, peat, and toasty malts. A seriously exceptional smelling stout. The taste is also very good. It has a nice, smooth flavor of cocoa, peated malts, espresso coffee, toffee, and roasted nuts. Everything good you want out of a stout, without anything unnecessary. Just a great stout. The mouthfeel is great, it's very creamy, full-bodied, and goes down easily. The drinkability is just great. All things taken, this is a great, drinkable stout that I'm glad I picked up."
"Overall: Pretty good balance with some kick, but not sour. A pretty solid sweet stout."
"Nitrogen is great for certain types of beers because it adds a smooth, almost creamy texture with a very light amount of carbonation. Something like Belhaven Scottish Stout almost suffers because of it. There are some very potent aromas and flavors here that don’t mesh with the nitro texture. It’s pretty good, but I wish I would have gone with the bottle now."
" Have it for desert or an after meal, by the fire, luxurious quaff."
"Overall, I love this stout, give me more"
"Belhaven Scottish Stout has won multiple awards for excellence around the globe. My relative lack of enthusiasm probably has more to do with my preference for American-style stouts than with any shortcomings of this ale per se. Since it's too expensive for regular consumption, the choice is even easier."
"Overall: Wow, is this good. Doesn't seem like a typical English stout; there's a lot more interesting things going on here than your typical Guinness -- the sweetness, maltiness and dryness are all there, but they hit different notes. Sort of like a song you've heard a thousand times, but reworked to bring out something new and interesting. Very drinkable. I've never seen this in a store, so until I do, I guess I'll be visiting The Half Door more often ..."
"In all, a very enjoyable stout, though perhaps too heavy to have more than 1 or 2."
"This one is so interesting and complex with many flavors and tongue senses. The lighter-than-usual-for-a-stout body really assists in knocking this one back quickly."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty good brew. Not the best Stout, but well made and it made for an enjoyable drink. Easily drinkable. No real presence of alcohol in the flavor or mouthfeel to distract. This could almost be a session beer. Wouldn't be a bad choice if you happen to see it."
"The beer is a very dark brown, almost black, with reddish highlights on the edge of the glass. The head was very light brown, towering and foamy. It smells of roasted coffee, creamy milk chocolate and licorice. The taste is nice and earthy, I tasted molasses, lots of toasted malt, there is a slight smokiness to it and some herbal hops in the background. The beer is thick and sticky with a slightly dry finish. This smooth stout hides the alcohol very well and it has a rich flavor, making it highly drinkable for the ABV."
"D -- the 7% ABV is well hidden in this smooth Stout. It goes down quite well and lives up to the label's promise of a Stout inside. I'd call this a Sweet Stout, but it's a bit strong to style -- more along the lines of a Foreign, but that makes no nevermind -- try this one!"
"Drink - The beer is very drinkable and it was gone before I knew it. Definitely a solid beer that is worth checking out."
"I appreciate getting the chance to try it from Steve as I've heard good things about the brewery, but I've never purchased any of their beers."
"This beer is good. It is neither exceptional or average, just good. The color of the body is light dark to brown (a little unexpected) and when poured in a pint the crown is not one to last. However, this beer makes up for it in taste. The smooth chocolate flavored malts really elevate it above some of its competitors. The robust flavors and velvety smoothness allow it to be very drinkable putting it in the category of an ""everyday"" beer. I could have this beer anytime and would recommend highly as an introductory stout."
"Taste-Roasty, black coffee, subtle dark chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel, leadint to a rather dry, astringent finish. Overall a nice English stout, though it is listed as a Scottish stout on the bottle."
"D- A decent beer, and an easy drinker for 7%, but it was merely solid for me. Good enough, but not great."
"For a 7% stout this is extremely drinkable. The flavour is big while being kept light by the feel. I would totally pick this up again; impressive. One of the top stouts currently available here in Ontario."
"Drinkability: This is most likely the most drinkable English Stout I have ever had. Very smooth, amazing looking, and with a very pleasant taste. This is a great 7% sipper."
"Scotch flavors definately play on every aspect of this beer. That smokey peaty flavor and aroma is all over this session. But so are English-like Stout flavor although the roast is moderate and the molasass flavor is robust. This is just how you'd expect a Scottish Stout to go."
"I'm not really impressed with this. A dark bottle would have been more appropriate. Light-skunked beer is always a shame."
"FourthBeer potential: VERY HIGH, as a quality stout that doesn't overwhelm you with an alcohol taste like your run-of-the-mill seven-percenter."
"Pitch black in color with a neat creamy tan head. Smell is delicious buttery diaycytal with a hint of milk chocolate. Taste is sweet caramel up front, some coffee in the middle, an an earthy sweet finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, low nitro. Drinkability is good, though the nitro kind of dumbs things down a bit."
"D - This is pretty good stuff. It's simpler than American stout and I enjoy the simplicity of good beer."
"What a tasty English Stout. This has to be the best interpretation of the style I've had to date. Flavourful and rich with a nice body to back it up."
"d-not bad...I could drink a few of these."
" D- This beer was interesting and sounded very promising on the label. However it was a bit thin and water but the flavor that was there was nice. The melanoidin character was a bit to strong and the hops bosed about on the label didn't show up in the beer."
"A very tasty after dinner beer, but I'm not sure I'd want to session this, in light of its sweeter qualities. Still, it's pretty good, worth having again."
"great lacing around glass. gets better as it warms up in temperature from the fridge."
"chocolate also present in the taste. kind of reminded me of root beer in some instances, which i found to be cool. well balanced and very drinkable."
"D - I could have a number of these. The clear bottle scared me a bit but this was a nice suprise. Nothing wrong with this at all and definately sessionable especially in winter."
"D: Very easy to drink. Overall, a solid beer."
"Drinkability-Hard to believe this is a 7% beer. I can barely taste alcohol at all."
"Pours a jet black colour with a creamy head, in a brandy snifter glass. Tastes of roasted chocolates with a hint of coffee in the finish. Drinks down very smooth and there is no hint of the 7% alcohol at all. Incredibly drinkable. Decent stout overall."
"I found his very easy to drink. Nice flavors and mouthfeel make this a good one to session. You don't notice the 7% at all."
"I'm surprised by this one. I really didn't expect to find much, but this beer excels on a number of levels."
"Medium bodied with velvety carbonation, it feels smooth yet also relatively light for something so richly flavoured. A little bit more heft wouldn't hurt it, but it's pretty hard to nitpick when something tastes so damned good. This is fine just the way it is. I like it a lot just the way it is. Full flavoured yet mellow. Great beer!"
"I don't have actual proof that drinking stout is good for you, but really, how can it not be? If not for your health then for your happiness! The brewery has encouraged me to 'drink, savor and enjoy' which is precisely what I did. This is a fantastic stout that encompasses all the rich, flavourful nature of higher gravity offerings without compromising the illimitable quaffability of traditional versions. Highly recommended."
"it's quite nice. Good. great but for the slightly cloying sweetness. If you like sweet things however you are in luck."
"500ml bottle from Capital Market,Salem typical stout in appareance, though this one does show hints of mahogany around the edges..and a lovelly bubbly tan head. Subdues sort of aroma but pleasing bready,nutty,slightly toasted oat aromas waft upwards Gorgeous rich Scottish malty taste, some peat/smoke even..to go with the dark smooth chocolate,semi sweet stout.some Italian coffees Gorgeous rich luxuriant palate on this..i am used to Scottish beers being a tad thin..this defies them all. Overall and excellent beer..maybe im being picky but this seems more like a strong porter rather than a stout."
"Pours a dark brown colour with thick tan head. Nice head retention with some mild lacing down the glass. Smells of chocolate and deep roasted malt. Flavour has a lot of sweet chocolate, but the bitter roast comes through as well. I didn't realize this was 7% abv until I went to review it, so it hides the alcohol incredibly well. I just assumed it was 4-5% range."
"Powerful. Pungent. Formidable. And insanely drinkable. One of the best stouts I've had in a while. Complex and delicious... and frighteningly drinkable."
"Drinkability - This is a great one to break a newbie into the style. It's not big and harsh like some others can be and is almost like a milk stout in its body and feel."
"D: Excellent, a delicious stout."
"Worth a pickup. Good addition by the LCBO."
"To be honest, I was a bit let down by this one. All of the flavours were there, but everything just seemed a bit thin, and the bit of sourness was distracting."
"Bottle, surprisingly, from LCBO. Pours blackish with lots of fast disapearing brown foam. Some thick lacing. Inviting roast and malt aroma. The taste is a good roasting, well balanced between a dry stout, just short of a slight sourness in the finish, and nicely malted. Flavourful and good drinkability."

"This is an excellent representation of the style, not a big roasty American stout but more of a creamy sweet English one. Light coffee, roasted malts, large fruity presence, dates, molasses, light bitterness in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel, a little thinner than its American brothers but to style, feels immensely quaffable as the ABV is hidden well, but it's still 7%! Sweet and creamy without feeling heavy, this is a really fantastic classic take on the style."
"This beer pours a nice super dark brown topped by a beige foam that has really beautiful lacing. The smell is a bit off, perhaps the hops are a bit skunked. Beneath that aroma there is a beautiful bouquet of caramel roasted malts. The problem is that the stink is too potent to get it. There is a nice mild roast flavor to the beer, a bit of a sour taste that you would find in a Guinness. Fairly smooth on the palate and it is an easy drinking beer. But still there's something off making it not as good as it could be."
"Odd brew, this one. Didn't particularly enjoy it."
"D - Very well balanced and enjoyable stout. Would definitely recommend it."
"D-Insanely drinkable for 7%, and just a ridiculously delicious, solid beer for a pretty low price tag."
"D - Superb, I could drink this all night."
"D: Easy drinker, goes down smooth. The flavor is light and the body is light. In my opinion, this deserves a pint glass, not a snifter."
"D: overall very nice English stout. Easy drinker for sure."
"Drinkability - a great fireside Scottish stout."
"D - This stout goes down sweet and smooth. Considering the ABV, I could have a few of these with ease."
"D: High. For the lovers of ""black beers", this is a must!"
"This is now a definite go-to stout for me. This is a great beer for the price. Highly recommend it."
"Well worth hunting this one down; buy three and store two for later. An excellent stout, nearly at the level of a Sam Smith porter."
"Taste is sweet upfront, almost a milk stout sweetness, pleasantly chewy in the middle, with a lightly bitter close. Mouthfeel is wow smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Session stout, anyone?"
"D: A pretty nice English stout with a very well-masked 7% ABV. A good sipper for a cooler, late-summer evening out on the patio such as it was. The ABV is deceptive, as the stout drinker s a bit like a slightly heavier, sweeter dry Irish stout. Gives a little extra kick in the flavor and adds to your glow as well."
"Drinkabilitiy is good. Pretty easy drinker, with the alcohol being well hidden throughout the session. If the ABV where lower, it would be a great regular beer. A few of these can easily sneak up on an unsuspecting aficionado."
"Pours a deep, almost totally opaque brown that shimmers blood red in the right light...Cool...'Bout a finger of deep, creamy brown head settles into a wisp and leaves good lacing. Lots of carbonation for a stout. Tangy, sour like aroma - some coffee notes and oatmeal. Maybe black cherry deep in there also. Flavor is a mixed bag. A lot similar to Guinness, but creamier and roastier, without the noticeable thin tanginess of the Irish counterpart. A little thin in its own right, but still drinkable. Average price at $3.99/bottle, so it's worth trying if you see it but neither unique nor elite."
"D - With its moderately high ABV (7%) it's not quite sessionable, however the alcohol does not show up much in the taste. A nice beer for an evening at home."
"MF&D - Well balanced and highly drinkable. I would seek this one out again."
"Easy to drink, but very thick."
"Nice hop snap on the finish too with a bitter punch. A flavorful and hearty stout. Better than expected."
"Poured into a sampling glass this brew was a dark chocolate color with a nice 2 finger milk chocolate head that settled into a foamy cap. The aroma was of molasses some burnt malts, slight chocolate and caramel. The taste was subtle up front with a little burnt caramel and some slight sweetness. The finish was well balanced with a decent hop presence. I was expecting some smoke as in a scottish ale but there was none present so that threw me off. The body was full and creamy with minimal carbonation making it nice and smooth. Good brew worth a try."
"Overall - This was a lot less of a roasty, bitter stout like I was expecting, and much more of a dark malt bomb overall. It almost comes off to me as a cross between a scotch wee heavy and a stout. A different, and very good take on this style. Worth seeking out!"
"After drinking it, I wouldn't label it a stout. It presents the qualities of the Scottish ales in a more concentrated form than they are usually found and still sits well afterwards. There wasn't much stickiness and it faded away gently without any change in the flavor through the aftertaste."
"Overall good beer, can't drink more than a pint at a time but very tasty."
"This stout is by far one of a classic. The super dark chocolate notes and espresso coffee taste really shines with this winner. A+ for sure!!"
"Pretty solid brew. Probably not drinking this at the right time of year, but overall, not a bad brew from a brewery I've never tried anything from...not bad for $5 and a whim."
"what would appear as a smokier export stout. this had all the qualities but a pretty loosely set head. a stout color with some bigger bubbles. a nose of coffee and tobacco earthiness. palate was coffe, mildly vanilla like the bean of a red wine... and a smoked mild astringent earthy malt. well versed but not much different that an export. maybe a tad less bitter."
"d-an excellent stout. can't touch the best imperials but damn it's good. one of the best stouts, i've ever had. good pick nick."
"Really impressed by this! Belhaven exporting one of their good-tasting beers?! Clear bottle = meh, but it seems to have held up fine. Might be the new go-to stout for me, when I don't want a six-pack or an imperial."
"MF/D: a slight initial sizzle that fades to a silky smooth cascade down the throat. an amazing stout that leaves a cacophony of sensations in the mouth."
"D: I could have it for dessert. Perfect end to a perfect 3-beer tasting. I could pour this over icecream. It's such a treat!"
"D - The 7% ABV is surprising for an overall mild and balanced stout. I could easily drink these all night."
"Poured slowly from a bottle into a brandy glass, a nice tan head developed. The aroma was nothing different than most stouts I've tried. Mouthfeel was good, but not overwhleming. The taste was very good, less bitter than I anticipated, and this is one of the smoother stouts I've had. I will keep this one on the list of ones to have again, for sure."
"If you get a chance, also try the Belhaven Scottish Ale, a really fine and also very creamy and rich beer from that great brewery."
" This one was much like a beefy Guiness from the nitro can."
"Drinakbility is just average. I love their Scottish Ale, but this does not live up to the family lineage. Maybe would be better on co2??"
"This is the first Scottish Stout that I've had. I'm a huge fan of Scotch Ales so when my wife found this one for me, I was intrigued. Needless to say I was most impressed with what I had. This is a great evening beer to sit back and enjoy while letting the day unwind. The 7% Alcohol by Volume gives it just enough kick that you don't want to drink it too fast."
"d - A pretty good stout. Nothing really jumped out at me about this stout, but it had a very nice chocolate and roasted smell and flavor. Would try again."
"What a great stout."
"D: This beer goes down quite easy and is very much sessionable."
"Drinkability: two more!"
"D - I would pass on this one . I am somewhat not happy that I accidentally bought two."
"a delightful stout that i've been looking at for a while but never picking up. im glad i did, though."
"This stout was very flavorful and very well balanced with a bitterness that kept the malt profile in check, but didn't overtake it. Alcohol heat is not even noticeable and this brew is dangerously drinkable. A great dessert pairing due to the supporting hops role. Highly recommended. I had to restrain myself from gulping this beer!"
"D - Good. I will have again. This is a fantastic brew."
"A good, nay great nitro or normal stout if you're in the mood."
"Overall: The mouth feel is rich, complex, creamy and smooth. The body of the beer is thick and chewy with a medium full finish. This beer is wonderful. deep rich aromas, flavor and consistency. All around a damn good beer."
"On nitro at the Horseshoe Pub, Hudson. Served in a standard pint glass. Ordered it because I don't normally see any other Belhaven beer on tap other than the Scottish Ale. Tons of surging carbonation due to the nitro. Dark brown color, with an off-white head. Smell was of roasted coffee. Taste was good, but seems a bit muted. Toned down coffee flavors mostly. Pretty one dimensional. Mouthfeel was aided due to the nitro, and since it's only 4% abv, it's pretty easy to drink. A nice stout, nothing to rave about, but a quality brew."
"Overall highly drinkable and enjoyable. I never tried anything from Belhaven til recently, and now that I have I'm starting to like them."
"Nice drinkability, easily one of the best bottled beers I've had out of Britain in the last 12-18 months & a top flight example of this style on the upper edge of ABV, yum"
"The bottle says it is 7% alcohol but you don't feel it. Very drinkable."
"D - This is an easy drinker. It has low alcohol. It is very smooth, pleasantly creamy, and very dry in the finish."
"Taste is nice and characterful. It is lightly on the sweet side up front and sweetness just dominates a light spicey-leafy-raisiny bitterness. It has rich prunes, earthy roots and leaves, hints of licorice and toast, hint of bittersweet chocolate. It has a leafy dryish finish with earth and hint of bittersweet chocolate, with the other elements lingering afterwards. The feel is nice, silky, a hint of oily fullness but not really oily and not viscous."
"And this beer is very smooth for being so big. I highly suggest trying this if you haven't."
"i usually like belhaven but this is a miss for me."
"M-"
"M/D: Not all that thick, fairly drinkable. 7% and not claiming imperial status. works for me."
"Drinkability: I was quite pleasantly surprised when I had the Belhaven Wee Heavy recently, and I am once again so with the Scottish Stout. I don't know why I should underestimate Belhaven; they consistently blow me away with high-quality, tasty and very drinkable brews."
"This is a far cry from the bottled version. Why must perfectly good/great stouts be ruined by nitro? Sure, its fine for a Guinness, but a stout like this deserves better."
"D- I was really unimpressed by this brew. Overall a huge letdown."
"Deep black in color-slight ruby reddish highlights around the edges. Nice tan head. Low, somewhat sharp and metallic aroma. Some mild roasted notes. Nice smooth roasted flavor. Somewhat of a dried fruit taste. Slight ""sooty"" or smokey tinge. Decent enough body-could use a bit more umph for me. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Once of the better UK stouts I have had."
"The body was smooth and well rounded. Drinkability was very good, this beer just glides down your throat. Overall, a very good beer, worth your time to try when you see it."
"D - Thin body without the presence of anything too overpowering allows this to be a very drikable english style stout. Big fan of this one."
"F: Still a little on the sweet side, but not too bad. Its creamy rich goodness seems to linger the longest, with a little bit of that stouty earthy bitter flavor really shining through on the finish now that the rich creamy chocolate milk is gone. The roasty flavor comes through a bit on the finish but also fades pretty quickly as it gives way to the earthy bitter flavor. I think there's a bit of lactose sugar in it that gives it the creamy flavor, and a lingering almost milky flavor on the tongue."
"The beer is quite creamy, a bit oily on the tongue, not much carbonation, and a fairly thick and full bodied affair. The caramels, toffee flavors, chocolates, dark malts, some roasted malts, and crystal malts are pretty laid on. There is a touch of leafy hop in the finish that adds a bit of bittering zest and dries things up just a tad. There is plenty of nice roasted malts that play off nicely with the hop, making this a nice thick, malty, fairly balanced stout. There is a touch of smoked peatiness in the malts that gives it some Scottish character, but the smoked flavors are pretty subtle and get balanced out with the leafy hop. There is a touch of ABV in the finish, but for a 7% beer, it is pretty well hidden. This is a nice beer that I'm glad I found. L'Chaim."
"This brew is very drinkable."
"Pours a solid dark brown with faint garnet highlights and a creamy almost fluffy khaki head that leaves mad lace on the sides. Smells of chocolate and caramel up front, brown sugar, vanilla, toffee and a bit of mineral water in there as well. Taste is chocolate and coffee, followed by a some sweetness of brown sugar, toffee, and dark fruits. Finish is rather dry with a lingering roast and sweetness on the palette. Creamy almost bubbly mouthfeel, medium to high level of carbonation for the style, medium to thick body. I enjoyed this one. Its a bit sweet but I find myself really enjoying sweet stouts as of late."
"Pours a medium black to super thick brownie mix brown hue. Nice mild nrown head o one finger that eventually dissipated away to the angels of froth. The aroma was a dry yet sweet brownie mix of chocolate, powdered milk, and coffee thats been on the hot plate just a little too long. Still very enticing to any black coffee and stout lover. The taste is a rich roasted and sweet malted barley that make you think of baked chocolate in any various incantation. Smooth, just the right amount of dryness, and the well incorporated abv. makes this a great offering from this well known Scottish brewery. Highly recommended to any stout lover out there!!!"
"From the 500 ml. bottle. Sampled on January 16, 2010. The pour is a thick dark brown with about an inch of silky, frothy tan head that remains resilient for most of the sampling. There is a nice dose of roasted chocolate malts in the aroma but the aroma overall is rather subtle and unopposing. Not much in the way of hops but to me that is the way it should be for a stout. Tastewise there is a wonderful bitterness along with a background of chocolate malts. This is incredibly smooth and relaxing to drink. This is a topnotch stout."
"Overall a very good stout."
"A bit on the sweet side for me. Somewhat enjoyable in the end, but a smaller serving size would be better for me."
"Poured more of a deep brown than black,when held up to the light light it did show thru the whole glass,a thinner light mocha colored head atop.Aromas were very light wich suprised me a little,a bit of iron and chocolate mainly.The moufeel was execellent though,full and creamy almost like a marshmellow in my mind.Full on chocolate on the palate with a tinge of earth,the alcohol is well hidden,the creamy feel and well hidden alcohol makes for a very easy drinker.A very nice ""bigger"" stout,it lacks a little but is nice to drink."
"OVERALL Delicious, smooth, rich, and bold. I'd never noticed this until recently and look forward to more of it. Should be savored, but drinks pretty easy for the size."
"D: A very nice beer. A bit less ""heavy"" than other american doubles I've tried, but not in a bad way. I could buy a whole case of this beer."
"D - This is one delicious beer. Aside from the subdued nose (which actually makes the taste an even more welcome surprise), this one's got pretty much everything going for it."
"the moughfeel is refreshingly manageable, and i don't mean that in the literal sense. i wouldn't necessarily drink this during a heat wave: ""refreshingly"" = ""novelly"". not viscous and wonderfully so"
"Opinion: I am really liking this beer. It has a nice balance, and nothing stands out...no flaws at all. I wouldn't put it in the ""Imperial Stout"" category as it is not intended to be that bold. It is more like a big dry-stout as much as any other style. You may be able to ""pigeon hole"" it into a Foreign Extra style, but it really doesn't fit there either. Either way, it is a good beer, and I am glad that I am drinking it. I would drink this beer again...in fact a lot, if the opportunity presented itself. Actually it is a style that I would like to try and copy for homebrew and have on tap once a year or so."
"It's very enjoyable, just incorrectly classified, in my opinion."
"Will pour a five+ finger light tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Black color no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Light chocolate nose. Flavor is roasted chocolate, somewhat sweet. Dry finish. $4.99 for a 500ml bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"Pours a very deep brown color with a tight light brown head that settles into a nice puffy cap. The aroma is a touch fruity; I am picking up some dark fruit notes as well as a woody oak aroma. A bit of a chocolatey roasted malt as well. The taste is big on the chocolatey malt, some coffee, an underlying tart fruit perhaps lemon, copper, not much hops. Has a fairly dry like tea flavor. The feel is a bit chewy with very soft carbonation; malty sweet but finishes dry and lightly bitter. A very solid and flavorful stout, though nothing extreme. Everything is kept in check which makes this quite drinkable."
"pours black with dark beige one finger head, held to the light shows blood red, pretty brutal. smell is weak, or maybe I'm congested, smokey and a light chocolate powder.. can't detect much more. taste is huge with caramel and chocolate, slightly smoked and a fair amount of hops to balance a delightful brew.. I dig this one a lot, it's right up my alley. Viscous, chocolaty, thick delicious stout and I love it, moderate carbonation, just the right amount. Creamy nectar of the scottish gods. cheers."
"Conclusion: Took a shot in the dark with this one and was pleasantly surprised. The wife and I both loved this; complex, deep, roasty, warming stout that doesn't try to overawe or rely on barrel-aging, etc. for complexity. $4-5 bucks for a pint is a bit pricey, but this would make a nice ""special occasion"" treat and an awesome paring with a flourless chocolate cake with fresh raspberries."
"D - The 500ml bottle was fine, but it's not something I'd rush out and get again. Maybe I'd do it on-tap at an authentic UK-themed pub."
"D - Even for the ABV, easy to drink and an average tasting stout."
"D - This is a very nice stout. The label says it's Scottish. This website says it's American. I don't really care, because it is very good."
"Tried this beer since it was one of the only singles I had not tried at the local beer store. Poured from a 500ml bottle into an imperial pint glass. Poured dark brown/black with full tan head. The head left good lacing all the way down and stuck around to the finish. Smells of malt and a touch of yeast and chocolate. Smooth drinking stout with no bite at all. Tastes of malt and chocolate with a touch of coffee and little no no roast. Subtle but perceptible alcohol tone at the finish after the light carbonation fades from your tongue. Overall this was a good stout that I will try again soon. Would be a great pairing beer for a meal rather than just a night cap."
"got this bottle a couple of months ago at Surdyk's in Minneapolis. Poured with a big, foamy, fine frothy, tan head that lasted a while and a little lace. Color is an opaque brownish black. Aroma is chocolate, malty, and sweet, but not much roastiness. Flavor is very similar. Not a lot of depth. Mouth is very soft with good carbonatioin. A little alcohol in the finish. Easy drinking beer. Little too sweet for me though"
"D: I thoroughly enjoyed this. A little less carbonation is the only change I would make. A very nice pickup."
"I was glad to find this today."
"I had not had Stouts in a while and this immediately made me want to go back to Ireland. This one is somewhat strong though, but perfect for a relaxing evening after the work."
"D: Drinks well, but will fill you up fast. Don't drink it if you're not hungry!"
"I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I just wish beer this good did not only sell in singles."
" Palate is mildly sweet roasted malt up front, with notes of chocolate, toffee, and maybe some lactose. A somewhat fruity character comes through on the finish, with prune or maybe Turkish apricot peeking through. Body is thick, creamy, and luxurious, highly enjoyable. Goes down very well for a big, thick stout, and pairs quite well with dark chocolate. Well done."
"On nitrogen (the 4.5%, pasteurized version). Pours clear red-brown with a typical off-white nitro head. Kind of underwhelming. Smells heavily sweet, with strong honey and caramel and only the slightest bit of roastiness. Tastes similarly sweet, but with heavy, heavy tobacco. Honey here as well, with hints of dark roasted malt. Medium body. This is one sweet stout; so much so that it's hard to drink."
"D - Goes down very nicely. Could easily drink a couple more."
"At only 7% ABV, I wouln't exactly call this a double or imperial stout, but ok... This beer is almost black in color, as no light shines through. After settling, the head retained is about four millimeters thick and is cream-colored. Carbonation is subtle. The smell consists of roasted malt, chocolate, and a bit of coffee. There are almost no hops present on the nose. Flavors are similar, but much more profound. Espresso, chocolate, and toast dominate the palate, and the finish is slightly dry. A well-balanced brew. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a viscosity that would make other stouts seem thin. This beer is very easy to drink, and is very easy to put down more than one of in a session."
"Definitely a malt lovers beer!"
"MF&D - the feel sis completey smooth and silky; carbonation wraps around the tongue and the beer coats the mouth entirely. goes down easy and is a real easy drinker, but I would have liked the carbonation to be less of the body's build up and instead have the brew be thicker."
"A good sweet stout. I guess this beer is supposed to be a cross between a scotch ale and a stout. It's a tad sweet but still very good. The beer pours dark brown with nice, off-white lacing. The malt flavor is a bit nutty with a good caramelized flavor. The aroma is a bit weak and generally less interesting than the flavor. The roasted malt character is light but very good. I wouldn't necessarily want one every night, but it's an interesting take on a stout."
"D- The flavor conflicts are somewhat off-putting. A good brew, but I preferred Twisted Thistle."
"Pours a dark dark reddish brownish color body. Big foamy tan colored head. Very lasting. Roasted coffee aroma. Some sweet chocolate notes too. Some dark fruitiness. Roasted flavor, light coffee too. Some chocolate notes. Slightly watery body. Pretty tasty, but a little alcoholy. Warming up, more subdued flavors, smoother, less alcohol."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like roasted malt, chocolate, smoke and coffee. This brew is definitely full of flavor, it tastes pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some caramel and licorice. Also, the taste is stronger than the aroma would indicate. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it's smooth and enjoyable to drink. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, it's a fine stout. I'll certainly buy this again when I get the chance."
"Poured a fantastic pitch black stout with some very nice head and good lacing. Good scent, nice and malty with good burnt grains and a little bit of cocoa; a little weaker than I like, though. Excellent taste, a deep dark stout with excellent roasted barley, with a really nice bit of peated malt thrown in to give it a Scottish flair. Goes down very smooth and rich, I had no idea it was 7% by drinking it."
"I dont know why this beer is called a stout/wee heavy on this website as it purely is a good old fashioned scottish stout absoulutely beautiful it pours a dark jet black which does not let any light in at all and it leaves a real frothy two finger cappicino laced head which leaves lacing all down the glass,on smelling this beer you can smell the aromas of roasted chocolate,coffee and malt and the taste doesnt dissapoint you can taste beautiful chocolate,coffee and malt notes not much hops or bitterness just a wonderful full mouth feel and definately a wonderful good old fashioned stout that exceeded my expectations,this is the beer you drink on cold windy rainy nights well done Belhaven on a beautiful stout."
"Great atmosphere on this one. Really solid appearance. Full, pleasing nose. Balanced, and a little complexity in the palette. Heavy filling feel. Overall, great quaff."
"Served in a pint at FFF brewpub from a guest tap. Deep brown, almost black, with a creamy, not-quite-white rolling nitro-tap serve. Aroma of roasted malts and dark fruity ale yeast. Hops not really discernible yet. Flavor is a great combination of the fuller-bodied, yeasty complexity of a good scottish ale with the clean bitterness of roasted barley. Teamed with a subtle hop bitterness, the roasty flavors cleaned up nicely after the fuller body, lightening the presence of this brew considerably. An inspired combination that has put this beer on my wife's ""you gotta brew one like this"" list."
"Nosed nice burned chocolate, coffee, bit of sweetness, sauteed caramel or something that I would think that would smell like. These was the tiniest metallic odor present which prevented me from the 5. Just as well on the tongue without the metal. VERY smooth and develops through the glass. You wouldn't be able to tell the ABV if you weren't told. At the end/back it was very slightly more burned and bitter and the pleasant tastes lingered through a great meal. It is just creamy enough and very drinkable. I'm going to have to keep a full page and try it over and over. Using the back of business cards for notes can't do this good of a beer right."
"D: interesting beer and a must try for any stout sipper, I was gulping more than anything. Across the board this one has good marks in my book. Very drinkable"
"[1x/resample]"
"Mineraly, creamy stout that delivers a more-than-decent amount of roast and chocolate flavors. Nice amount of light berry fruits - strawberries and maybe even some cranberry tartness. This is a very good lighter style stout that can even classify as sessionable. Good, good beer, I enjoyed it tremendously."
"Reviewed on 4/16/09. Bottle. Pours black with a small light tan head. Aroma is quite odd--slight roasted malt and also some vegetal notes I think Flavor is rather salty with a vague malt backbone. This is one of the oddest stouts I've had and I don't like it."
"Very solid and quite impressively yummy! And @ $4.50 for the 500ml bottle its well worth grabbing a few. I know I'm gonna stock up on more next time I see it..."
"A great Wee Heavy/Stout. It is really a cross between the two, and I love it. Another hit from Belhaven. Highly recommended."
"D= Not the best stout I have ever had but it was a super damn delicious one! Very smooth and easily sessionable despite the abv."
"Pretty tasty stout, but not really all that amazing. Worth a try though if you see it. For being 7% it's pretty damn light."
"taste is creamy, roasted nuts, bakers chocolate, weak coffee, malt, and some vanilla, ends a little dry and a touch of bitter."
"Pours pitch black with a thick tan head. Good lacing down the glass. Burnt malt and chocolate/caramel aromas. A slight woody hop aroma is also in there. A very nice sweet chocolate, roasted malt, carmel flavor. A bit of hop in the finish, but there isn't really any bitterness in the finish, maybe a little. It is very delicious. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and I could definitely have quite a few of these."
"A vivacious and delicious stout. Seek it. Find it. Drink it."
"Very very dark mahogany color with a large tan head. Great retention and lacing. Nutty cocoa aroma with accents of light peat and some sweetened coffee. Nice black malt flavor, notes of coffee beans and dark chocolate. A bit of caramel sweetness along with a slight acidity. Body is nice and full yet airy. Carbonation is a little too high. Very drinkable and tasty."
"D: pretty good, i love scotland and i like this beer"
"Good offering from Belhaven. It's been a few years since they introduced anything new in this market."
"I'm always proud to drink Belhaven as a descendant of Micum McIntire from Dunbar."
"Very nice flavor profile here. Starts off with notes of slightly roasted espresso and peat, backed by a semi-sweet chocolate backbone. Quick burst of earthen hops hits mid-palate before a boozy finish of Scotch and bitter roast. Medium mouthfeel with a nicely carbonated body and a semi-dry finish. Was not expecting this degree of complexity from Belhaven...VERY pleasantly surprised by this beer! Goes down smooth for the 7% ABV and is refreshing to boot. Highly recommended."
"Maybe ...but not the first thoroughly satisfying Belhaven brew. Mmmm, mmm, I'm just likin'this...Great stuff."
"D: A real nice beer from Belhaven, they consistently produce excellent ales. Great drinkablity, drinks like a 4% brew."
"Drinkability-Good. Nothing spectacular. Not sure how the rating will equate but this is a quality offering, a B+ in my book."
"This is super drinkable and if it didn't cost $5+ a bottle I would buy a case of this stuff."
"An enjoyable stout, a nice twist on the style. Lots of caramel in this one."
"Pretty drinkable stuff."
"This is listed as a wee heavy, but I would call it a sweet stout or a milk stout. Sturdy tan head. Black body. Sitting, untouched by the world around it. Malty aroma. Also some dry stout aroma, I guess the malt. Sweet milky flavor. Some quiet hop bitterness in the back. Super smooth and silky. A lush stout, deserving of the name ""stout"". Definitely not a porter. Very good, maybe a bit sweet to be too drinkable. But the body is perfect. A one to stick with."
"D: I liked this one. It's drinkable with an unusual nose. Goes down smooth without harshness. I would recommend this one."
"Black body, it was dim in the bar, the candlelight did nothing for it. Very creamy foam, similar to a Guinness on nitro. It left a solid sheet of lacing down the opposite side I was drinking from. Compact head of foam with a creamy feel. Nose was mellow, possibly it was too cold, but didn't get much besides faint roast. The feel was light and creamy, almost a milk stout minus the sweetness. Dry unsweetened chocolate and tobacco. Thin bodied with a light creaminess. Miles ahead of Guinness, still fairly simple and sessionable."
"D- I would drink this all night and love it. I'm sure the nitro tap is helping immensley so I wonder how this fares in a bottle. The flavor profile does not scream stout IMO so i'm guessing that this is just a trumped up version of their regular wee-heavy. Either way it's brilliant and everybody should try this. Top notch stuff."
"Belhaven Scottish Stout is a terrific double stout. The light sweetness and roasty flavors are very well balanced, and the medium body and smooth texture make for a beer that is very easy to drink. There is nothing in the nose, taste, or mouthfeel that suggests that this is a 7% brew. Quite nicely done."
"Overall quite tasty with a smooth and fluffy feel to it. The alcohol is just right for this style and is more than drinkable. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this brew is and will definetly buy it again."
"I had started the night on other drinks and tried this on a whim actually but I wish I'd started the night on this one. A few would have made me really happy. ;-)"
"My apologies on the beer style. It's listed as a scottish stout, a style I confess I'm not familiar with. Also, the bartender knew nothing about availabilty, so I speculated on that as well."
"Pours dark dark brown with light tan head and moderate lacing. Smells of sweet roasted malts and chocolate, nothing too big here. Taste is a light roasted coffee bitterness and a chocolaty smooth finish. Very light bodied with medium carbonation. Real sweet finish makes this pretty unpleasant. A meh at best, wouldn't go for it again."
"Overall impression: A firmly hopped, highly sessionable milk stout. By far the hoppiest milke stout I've ever had but the earthy hop notes, roasted grains, and slight creaminess lent for a well-knit beer."
"bottle."
"Drinkability: This beer is okay, but I certainly won't be seeking it out again. I'm only a few sips in and I wish I was drinking something else."
"Pours a very deep brownish-red which you can actually see through and has a fairly small off-white head that mostly dissipates quickly, though it leaves a very substantial ring and reasonably good lacing. Quite good for a brown ale, but not quite on style for a stout. Smell is mild coffee and caramel, with a minor chocolate note and a hoppy hint. Rather sweet, which diminishes the complexity and makes it seem a touch muddled. Taste is a bit on the thin side, coffee taking the lead. Less sweet than the aroma, but retains a touch of caramel. Finish is short and slightly earthy. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and lacks body, but isn't too bad, and drinkability is reasonably good. Not too bad, but not all that good either."
"Pours a clear dark burgundy under a reddish brown one finger head that settles a bit too quickly, leaving no trace at all. The nose is strong of sweet caramel. The mouth is light and quite prickly. The taste is thin, almost watery. Sweet caramel dominates, with just a hint of something roasted on an open fire. There is no hops backing, so the overall impression is quite sweet. Caramel dominates the aftertaste, although a touch of dryness emerges very late. A disappointment."
"Just a bit sweet in the aftertaste too. Mou, vanilla. And in the end, some ash again."
