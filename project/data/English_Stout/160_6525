Wychwood's Black Wych is a proper English-style dark ale - a bold malt bill that takes centre stage, but is kept in check by a combination of roasted notes and the leafy English hop bitterness. Combine that with an enjoyable mouthfeel and relatively low abv, and you've got the recipe for one highly serviceable session porter. This is not an especially remarkable beer, but I have no major objections and it's definitely one of the better products I've tried from this brewery over the years.","thehyperduck","0"

4.2,13.2,5,5,4,3,4,"Black Wych, described on the label as a ""Spell Binding Stout"". I am a big fan of stouts, having been brought up by my eldest brother to think of Guinness as the height of manly drinking - thus it was no surprise that my first ever legal beer was a Guinness. These days I steer clear of the Liffey Water, say it quietly but I prefer Beamish of the mass produced Irish stouts - although I am yet to try the O'Hara Stout, but it is high on my list for stuff to try for my birthday weekend in Ireland. But I digress, back to the idyllic English countryside. Black Wych pours dark, very dark, so dark it is practically opaque - I even put it right up next to a light and couldn't see through it. The head was the same colour as comes on an espresso in an Italian café, and boy is this stuff thick. The coffee theme continues in the nose, lots and lots of roasted coffee beans, with a subtle burnt chocolate undertone, which almost smothers a burnt caramel twist. I was excited about this one, and the first mouthful didn't let me down, with the espresso theme of roasted bitterness bursting on to my tongue. However, it wasn't the ""velvety smooth stout"" that the label promised, it is very dry, perhaps some oats would have smoothed it out. Not that it was bad, just not what I was expecting. This was a very fine pint, one that would go well with bowls of stew and open fires in the middle of winter.","velkyal","Aug 07, 2008"

3.63,-2.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured an almost black reddish amber color and formed a medium tan foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonization is present.

Smells of slightly burnt and heavily roasted barley are straightforward and wonderful. There's a bit of fruit and a little coffee and chocolate. Some pepper and a little spice hang in the distance of the aroma. Not bad at all. It's a fairly dry beer, with a little acidic quality. The heavily roasted barley flavor contributes heavily to the beer's character. A little bitterness starts in the mid-taste, and continues through the finish, but is never dominant. There's also a little oily slickness that stays throughout the entire sip. The body is very full and thick, with an incredibly smooth mouthfeel. Good stout.","Suds","Jan 03, 2007"

The nose has a clear floral pine scent, slightly subdued but unmistakeable. The mouth is light and very well-carbonated. Very interesting taste: it opens like an IPA, slightly sour malt followed by coniferous hoppy bitter. Only much later does a bit of roasted smokiness emerge. The hops never go away, leaving a very floral finish and aftertaste. This is a very taste brew, albeit a rather odd stout.","Globetrotter","Mar 05, 2006"

3.87,4.3,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Pouring from Wychwood's uniquely shaped clear bottle, the beer is opaque, thick black, though a little dark brown near the edges. The head starts large and fine, and seems to shrink very quickly, staying for most of my drink at about 1or 2 cm. Swirling the glass a little improved the creaminess of it. The foam is light brown, almost red in some spots, leaving fast moving screens of lace. A moderate appearance for a stout; nothing extraordinary. I get more brown ale aromas than stout ones, but that is certainly nothing which detracts. The aroma is slightly sweeter than some stouts, more caramel-like, with fresh bread, and a good deal of flowery hops. Creamy mocha, raisins, and mostly a typical stout aroma except the greater sweetness. The aroma is the best aspect of this beer. I get lactose up front on the tongue, good malt in the middle, and sweetish, almost sour bread on the finish. Treacle, more raisins, chocolate cherry, nuts, caramel. I enjoyed the subdued dryness of this stout on the finish; indeed, I am left more with sweet malt than any hop dryness. Mouthfeel: this beer needs much more substance in the mouth; it is far too light feeling for a stout, though it does render the brew easily drinkable. Creamy carbonation; silky, though a little watery. While this is not my favourite stout, I would buy it again: the flavour is there, it just needs to reach its potential through increased body and mouthfeel.","Cwrw","Nov 11, 2004"

Aromas of black patent malts, a hint of currant-like fruitiness, a hint of clover honey and a lot of earthy undertones. Tastes almost more like a fruity porter than a stout, but it is all about the flavor. The malt is the predominant taste in the beer, and it has a faint astringency throughout the beer. Slightly winey and earthy. A little thin, but definitely not lacking in flavor. Easily drinkable like many beers from the U.K.","crookedhalo","Oct 09, 2004"

4.01,8.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"In the mouth, it feels smooth and easy-drinking, with a light carbonation and a richness that doesn't add weight. I really like it.","Garin","Jul 10, 2004"
3.56,-4,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a 500 ml clear bottle, a dark coffee coloured body, with a small creamy beige head that settles to a thin cap and leaves some slight lacing. Dark mahogany highlights when held up to direct sunlight. Smells of light roasted malt, some licorice and coffee, a touch of chocolate, but all very faint and watered down. I tried a new bottle from the one I originally reviewed, and found it far more flavourful and robust than from my first sample. Starts out with dry roasted malts, and quickly picks up a chocolate sweetness in the middle, finishing with a sticky hybrid of sweet malt, chocolate and licorice. Dry espresso and almost a burnt character come out on the aftertaste, a little bit of charcoal. Creamy smooth mouthfeel with decent body, but light enough to make it enjoyably quaffable. I'm rather glad I went back and tried another one of these over a year later, I had picked up a sub-par bottle initially, and had all but written this stuff off. A decent stout, all things considered, even though I still have to get over the stigma of the clear bottle.","IronDjinn","Jul 07, 2004"
3.58,-3.5,4,3.5,4,3,3,"If it were presented as an ale, would've received a few more points. Overall, disappointing as a stout, but nice to drink nonetheless. Would probably have again, just not when I'm in the mood for a nice creamy stout.","baiser","May 14, 2004"
2.92,-21.3,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"This beer was the odd man out in this tasting. I like stouts...figured this would be a traditional one as its from the UK...bzzzt wrong! I didnt expect much with arty label and the trendoid embossed clear bottle but it wasnt skunked. Poured a lucid dark brown instead of the expected dead black color of traditional stouts....this looks more like weak porter. The pour (and I hated to defile such trendy packaging actually opening it and drinking the artfully wrapped contents) was anticlimactic...what you saw in the bottle was what you got in the glass...low carbonation, weak nose..some coffee some malt...very weak. Stated watery for a stout...medium-light malt body outbalanced by hops..finish comes too fast with nothing left on the tongue to impress but a bit of astringency. This would be a passable mega porter if it had more malt character. Not bad but not good and the package is overstated for the contents.","pootz","May 05, 2004"
3.25,-12.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Poured to an almost ashpalt coloured body with a thinning brown head that tried its best to linger. The hop combination seemed to take the life out of the aroma but certainly hues of burnt chocolate and nutmeg are apparent at different stages of consumption. Lack of sweetness and the less then filling feeling (too watery) left me somewhat perturbed as to why this is classified as a stout. The 4.5 ABV should have given me a clue. Not one of Wychwood Brewing's best.","beckerboots","Feb 11, 2004"
4.28,15.4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This stout looks kind of like a porter, its dark dark brown/almost black rather than extremely black. The head is long lasting and leaves concentric sheets of lace behind. The aroma is strong, I opened the bottle, walked across the room, and from there I could smell the black malts and hops. The taste is is hoppier than most UK stouts, with a citrusy character. The malts are complex with quite a subdued burnt taste and a lot of chocolate characteristics. The mouthfeel is not as full as other stouts, rather on the thin side. That being said the excellent balance of this brew and the modest ABV make it very drinkable. Its not that filling.","CAMRAhardliner","Feb 09, 2004"

3.08,-17,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"The best I've had from Wychwood thus far. Fresh bottle, so their was no light struck aroma. Poured a vicious, tar black colour with a two finger head. The head disippated to film about halfway down the glass. Dark malt and oatmeal is smelled, with a decent hop kick. Tasted a little weaker than it smells. Little bitter hops, little sweet malt, some chocolate, and oatmeal cookies. Good, slick mouthfeel. Kind of a light oil. A decent beer.","slitherySOB","Jan 04, 2004"

3.5,-5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle - Dark black brew with a nice foamy head with medium retention. Floral aroma coming out of my glass is incredible. Taste is very sweet unlike the irish stout. This is very different and the body is very light. I'm not even sure this is a stout but overall it is not a bad beer.","Phyl21ca","Beers"
3.92,5.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I'd like to see the folks the folks in Witney ramp this one up a bit, since it's one of the few English stouts that doesn't emulate the Irish style with addition of roast barley.","Seumas","0"

4.18,12.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"500ml bottle. Poured a dark black, with a massive chocolate head that slowly receded to a fine ring, lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is a muted roated coffee. Taste is creamy smooth, and mild for a stout, but a very enjoyable drink. I was concerned about the clear glass bottle, but thankfully it has suffered no ill effects. A thoroughly enjoyable beer.","Indybeer","Jul 24, 2003"

4.33,16.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"It's black with some ruby highlights, a small brown head tops it off. A good english hoppiness is present in the aroma, along with burnt coffee and some black fruits. Taste is quite odd. Starts off with a very buttery, yet hoppy taste, then roasted malt dominates the aftertaste. If you like english bitters, you'll love this brew. A very unique stout, with a smooth mouthfeel and good stout drinkability.","avylover","Apr 23, 2003"
4.06,9.4,5,4,4,4,4,"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized dark tan bubbles that left a nice lacing and a dark brown body with some carbonation rising up the side of the glass. It has very nice malty aroma and an initially mild coffee flavor but finishes with a slight bite, but still very nice all around.It was jJust a bit mild for a great stout.","TheDM","Jan 06, 2003"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This was not as strong of a stout that I have experienced in the past. This one was noticeably milder which I know is not the norm for a stout, but personally I prefer a milder tasting stout so I really enjoyed this particular one. It poured a thin head which did not last too long. It had excellent lacing to it. This particular stout is definitely one that I would enjoy drinking again sometime.","hotstuff","Dec 16, 2002"
4.13,11.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,5,"I really liked this one. I generally like stronger stouts but these guys seem to do a great job with a moderate ale. The head is thin but present throughout and leaves a nice lacing. The nose is sweet with caramel notes. But the first taste makes you well aware of the hops. The beer warms you in spite of its low alcohol content and makes it well worth the drink. Maybe a good session beer for those that are interested in that aspect. The malts become present as you move through the pint and are quite a good combination. Definitely a beer I will seek out again.","Maestro","Dec 05, 2002"
3.98,7.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Black body with clear mahogany highlights at the base of the glass. Topped by a short, frothy, light tan head that holds fairly well and leaves some nice lace. The nose expresses a roasty malt, mild diacetyl butteriness, and some grassy and earthy hops. The body is light/medium with a very fine and mild carbonation that leaves it smooth in the mouth. The flavor starts with a charming semi-sweet chocolate note and underlying butterscotch that are soon overtaken by roastiness and then drying bitterness. It finishes dry, bitter, and fairly short with only a mild lingering roastiness. A bit one-sided but well-balanced and enjoyable; and at is moderate strength it makes a good session ale! As is the case with many English beers, this is best enjoyed at cellar temperature.","NeroFiddled","Nov 29, 2002"
2.64,-28.8,4,2.5,3,2,2,"Like the other Wychwood beers I have tried so far, this is below average. Pours a nice dark color with a slight coffee aroma but the flavor was seriously lacking. Thin and metallic and too fizzy. Maybe this is what a lightstruck Stout tastes like? Damn these clear bottles!","Dogbrick","Nov 15, 2002"
3.68,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Standard dull black pour. Aptly named a ""Black Wych"" Creamy full rich bubbly beige head. Stayed together and fell down the glass nicely. Smell was dominated by burnt malt, bitterness, coffee smells. Taste was a bit more sweet. Some roasted chocolate malt, but again super bitter strong finish. The label says ""Imported English Stout"" I didn't guess it to be an Oatmeal Stout. Too much bitterness for me to think of it as an Oatmeal Stout. Nice dry finish. Medium carbonation. Just gets a bit on the thin watery side, as it nears the bottom of the glass. Still very good, tasty stout, but not as sweet and full bodied as other Oatmeal Stouts I have had.","StevieW","Nov 01, 2002"
3.71,0,4,3,4,3.5,4,"The Black Wych pours, not surprisingly, a black color with a somewhat sturdy tan head. Aroma is quite funky at first (damn clear bottles), but after letting it air out, notes of oats and roasted malts are present. Taste is pretty good with hints of more roasted, burnt malt, coffee and oats. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but overall a quaffable oatmeal stout.","Jon","Oct 18, 2002"
3.86,4,4,3,4.5,3,4,"Nice opaque dark brown body with a thick light brown head.  No CO2 apparent in the body - but perhaps it's just too dark to tell.  Head retention is a bit weak, but a thin lace still covers the beer to the end.  Lots of lace left on the glass.  Weak aroma of coffee dominates the smell.  Oats are noticeable as well.  Excellent taste!  Rich coffee taste with roasted oats and a lingering bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but certainly not bad.  Overall a very tasty and enjoyable brew.","Viking","Oct 09, 2002"
3.85,3.8,4,4,4,2.5,4,"Applesauce, a shot of wheatgrass and coffee. Breakfast for uppity junkies? Or a description of Black Wych? You decide. Ruby edged black nether a thin, tacky head. Nose of newly dug holes and seasonal transitions. Mouthfeel is a bit runny but overall a decent, drinkable brew.","inebrius","Beers"
3.97,7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"a non nitro stout, this still pours the ""perfect pint", filling my glass exactly to the top with about 2 fingers of head.  The colour is fairly black, and the head is tan.  The smell is mostly of burnt coffee, the taste is also mostly coffee, the chocolate is less evident.  A little thin and watery, but still nice.  Smooth on the tongue with a little carbonation for effect.  A solid stout, nothing special, but worth trying.","the42ndtourist","0"
