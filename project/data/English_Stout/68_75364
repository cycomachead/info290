4.09,11.1,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"My new favorite thing from Flying Dog.  This light for a stout.  It strikes me as more of a porter in color, clarity, and body.  But it definitely has the bigger stout flavor.  I never thought of a stout as being refreshing, but this one really is.  The aroma is roasty, chocolatey, and bready but with a hint of salty sea breeze (if that's possible).  The flavor is very much like the aroma.  It is at once dark and comforting, but at the same time crisp and refreshing.  It's brewed with oysters and if you close your eyes and use your imagination you can picture a nice bowl of oyster stew to go along with this brew.  A bonus is that purchase of this beer benefits planting new oysters in the Chesapeake Bay as part of the Oyster Recovery Program.  I can't wait to have another.  After finishing the beer the aroma left behind in the empty glass finally sparked what I perhaps like so much about it.  It reminds me of a chocolate bar with cracked sea salt.  Yeah, it's good.","thehooksman","Jan 21, 2015"

The abundant roastiness makes this more American than English to me, but that doesn't really matter. This is damn good beer, that's what matters.

Wow, what a bitter taste. Dark chocolate flavors, coffee, toffee. Little mineral flavor. Again, glad it doesn't have a fishy taste. Its a little too bitter for my stout liking, but much better than I thought it would be. ADDITIONAL INFO: Well, by the end of the glass, it got kind of oystery. A little to powerful for me.

4.09,11.1,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Love this beer. Not a style that is very approachable for the casual craft enthusiast. The appearance is a cloudy dark brown with a thick cream head. The smell was a mixture of sweetness from the malt and a little bit of hops. The taste however is very different. Starting out with the caramel and coffee and then at the end it was cut by the salty, fatty flavor of the oysters. I found it incredibly satisfying and refreshing. Not for the faint, but a wonderful find.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 14, 2014"

I brought it home and when I pored it it was had a nice off white head. Smelled like a typical stout, but had a light roasted malt smell that I am used to. The oysters are pretty noticeable and the beer had a slimy finish... I was pretty dissatisfied in the overall quality of the beer... with the sliminess and the lack of a backbone, I would not buy it again.","PettyThief","Jul 05, 2014"

Nice nose of chocolate, anise and roast over a slight salty sea note. Light medium bodied with a smooth texture that approaches slick. Below average carbonation with almost no effervescence on the finish. Extremely well balanced flavor profile that has some complexity, but is not as intense as Bell's Kalamazoo or FBS. It begins with a chocolate note that flows into a slight roast bitterness. Underneath is a very subtle saltiness. The finish is smooth and the finish leaves you with a lingering chocolate bitterness and a touch of salt.","tillmac62","Jul 02, 2014"

3.3,-10.3,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours jet black from the bottle with a light foam, light beige/off-white two-finger head which dissipates down to a solid covering of froth on the top of the beer with solid lacing on the glass. Nose is actually fairly light, but contains all the usual stout notes - dark malt, dark chocolate, toffee, a touch of wan espresso, and, though I may be mistaking it, there does seem to be a hint of bitter citrus hops. Also, perhaps itâ€™s the name, but it does seem that there is a hint of oyster sauce in there, not briny oysters and seaside air mind you, but a hint of the slightly briny but mostly sweet Hoisin-like Asian condiment. Sip is toffee and lightly bitter chocolate up front, and is actually somewhat sweet. The middle of the tongue sees more of the bitterness with dark coffee notes taking over along with what seems a touch of vanilla and a hint of sweet citrus fruit...yeah...I know...that one seems weird, but it really does seem to be there. Back of the tongue sees more coffee notes along with a hint of toffee and the finish, which is pretty short and simple, is lightly sweetened coffee. Mouthfeel is actually quite light and the carbonation, like most everything from Flying Dog, is a bit heavy. So, the big question is, where is the oyster in all of this? The classic hint I can find is a note approaching oyster sauce in the midpalate when it warms slightly, but as a whole, I canâ€™t find any and canâ€™t help but wondering if there might have been a better use for those local oysters. As it stands this is a perfectly decent stout, nothing especially grand, but also quite sessionable due to its heavy carbonation, light-for-the-style mouthfeel, nice hints of sweetness amidst the roastier bitter notes, and low ABV.","8stringfan","Jun 11, 2014"

The beer is medium to heavy bodied, slightly chewey. enjoyable sipper but a mostly dry stout with roasted malts ( and again I get this coffee thing) dominating and just minor bitter chocolate notes mixed in. The finish seems a little grainy so I suppose this is where the oyster kick is which isn't bad as it isn't burdensome and lends itself to the beer.

The smell is solid, but I expected a little more. It's full of roasted, malty scents. A little earth and charcoal, some subtle coffee smells. The taste is very good....semi-dry and very full. Lot's of grain flavors. Some smoke and a lot of smoothness. The mouthfeel has some interesting salty and calcium-reminiscent characteristics...perhaps from the oysters? Lingering bitterness.

The head dissipated quickly and left very little lacing. Smells like roasted coffee, some herbal hops, briny sea salt near the end. The flavor was absolutely phenomenal, faithfully following the nose with coffee, roasted grain, dry chocolate, sea salt, and woody, herbal hops at the end. Thankfully does not taste like oysters. Went down easy with a slight carbonic bite and a medium thin mouthfeel. A great stout, even with the gimmick of seafood in it.","Aaron_Ramson","Nov 18, 2013"

I don't smell fish at all, and this doesn't taste salty. instead I get bittersweet roasted barley, chocolate malt, and faint espresso notes. the texture is what makes this beer for me, creamy and rich, while retaining its drinkability. nice as an after dinner session beer, or as an interesting conversation piece. im not usually a huge fan of flying dog, but this beer really steps it up in both creativity and execution. worth seeking out. any other good oyster beers out there? how did this start?

The oysters lend a bit of depth to the aroma that really rounds out the aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, earthy black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry. There is a bit of chocolate malt in there as well that provides some added sweetness and complexity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific seasonal beer. It's quite drinkable and is full of flavor.","WesWes","May 22, 2013"

Taste is roasted coffee, a lot of open, watery taste to it with a bitter chocolate/hop finish. I haven't had oysters before, but I don't taste anything out of the ordinary or shellfish-y in this beer. Perhaps it's in that sort of open slipperiness.

Aroma has hints of sea salt and mineral water with an earthy dark roast character, flavor wise we dive into the mix of dark roasted malt bitterness with a soft chocolate blanket and salty earth notes. A bit one dimensional but a drinkable version of a dry stout. Mouthfeel is medium thin at times compared to other bigger stouts on the market this isn't trying to be that, it's a middle of the road oyster infused dark beer. That's really my overall impression.","WVbeergeek","Apr 25, 2013"

Thankfully, the taste does offer a bit of salty brininess that too many oyster stouts miss out on, providing a great amount of depth to the chocolate flavors akin to a sea-salted chocolate bar.

Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, caramel, toffee, light oyster, floral, and earthy spiciness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, caramel, toffee, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of roasted flavors, with good complexity; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice stout!

More of the same in the taste, dark malts, bitter cocoa, toasted bread, some mild leafy and earthy hops, and a bit of mineral from the oysters, that was really more implied in the mouthfeel than in the taste, as with most oyster stouts (in my opinion). Body was mid-range, about right for an English-style, so no real complaints there, though the roastiness added a little oomph. Pretty good overall.","Rifugium","Feb 02, 2013"

Poured a massively dark reddish brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, toasted malt, subtle salt, and slight cocoa powder. The flavor was of sweet malt, toasted malt, milk choclate, powdered chocolate, and very subtle salt. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. An oyster stout you say? If this is indeed an oyster stout, where are the oyster-ish aspects? There was hardly any. Maybe there was a kiss of brine, but that was about it. I'm sure they added a little to the mouthfeel, but I would have loved to see a little more of their presence. After having had a few good examples I have set the bar pretty high with these. Glad I got to try it but there are other better examples out there.","thagr81us","Jan 15, 2013"

The nose comprises roasted malts, watered-down coffee, dark earthy greens, and mineral water.

3.91,6.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and a good example of an English Stout brewed with Oysters, I don't have much experience with English Stouts and I have never had a beer with oysters in it before, but it seemed to fit the style nicely and the oysters added a nice layer of complexity that didn't stick out too much. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it went down smooth and the flavors held my attention nicely, I could probably drink two of these before the charred flavor would be too much. What I like the most about this beer was the taste and appearance, it tasted pretty good with some nice roasted flavors and a slight briny flavor and the appearance was really good. What I liked the least about this beer was that aroma had a little too much char to it, I wouldn't mind the char being toned down a little with a little briny aromas. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good and drinkable English Stout and I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, don't let the oysters scare you this is a good stout. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I have to admit that I was little intimated by the fact that they threw some oysters in this brew but it turned out that they didn't impart any fishy aspects to this beer, it just made it richer and added a slight briny flavor to it which I liked and I thought it worked well with this beer. Good job Flying Dog at first glance this is one crazy sounding beer, but once you get down to it and drink it it's really not all that crazy, it's just a good English Stout, nice work guys, I'll be interested to see what other crazy ideas you guys got.","StoutHunter","Oct 29, 2012"

Doesn't smell much, but I didn't ask for a tasting in the bottom of the glass. We'll see what she smells like after a few gulps. Roast, toasty malts remind me of rich breads we used to make flavored with oyster liquor when I was young. Lots of chocolate and coffee - a true stout. Dark sugars, a touch of char, cloyingly dry-these are all my favorite things about stouts. What a tremendous offering from FD. The oyster flavor is only at the beginning with some brine lingering to the end, adding to the beautiful balance of this beer. Still doesn't smell like much, served too cold.

I was elated I had broken down a barrier; it was only being compared to about 20 other beers, and my tongue was still turned off by anything that wasn't light and at least semi-sweet. That night will always be a great memory, and the bottle from that moment will always stand in my hall-of-fame, but I really doubt I'll ever drink this for any other reason than for memory's sake.

Taste is absent of anything that resembles oysters for me, however, it is incredibly chock full of roasted barley and chocolate and has a nice caramel malt backbone. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for style with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, this is quite a tasty stout and is actually quite refreshing (as I drink this on a 90 degree summer day).

3.5,-4.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had this on tap at the brewery in the tasting room. It pours a lighted black (if thier is such a thing) not as dark as a lot of stouts I've had. The aroma is light hints of roasted coffee and very subtle hints of chocolate. I didn't get any real oyster flavor in the beer but is was a really nice smooth stout that was very drinkable. It's not over the top on ABV's like a lot of stouts out there which was really nice for a change. Got a six pack on my out so we'll see how it is from the bottle.","cps98","May 03, 2012"
3.6,-2.2,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty and sweet lactose like. In the taste, sweet roast, dry lactose sugar, and a small saltiness. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry lactose sweetness in the aftertaste. A nice roast and flavor, but kind of standard for the style.","OWSLEY069","Feb 07, 2012"

3.58,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a dark brown with a soapy khaki-colored head. Aromas of dark, ""roasty"" malt with just a touch of brine. Taste is of more dark roasted malt, a touch of chocolate, and bit more salty sea water. Mouthfeel is smooth and quite drinkable, with a medium mouthfeel and good carbonation. Overall a very easy-drinking Stout that could use a touch more oyster character, but nice overall.","jsanford","Dec 14, 2011"

3.63,-1.4,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"This beer poured out as a deep brown color, the head is thin and tan in color. There is no retention or lacing. The smell of the beer is lightly toasted, with some light roasted malt aromas in there too. The taste of the beer has a subtle bite to it, nice light chocolate tones with a creamy aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is on the lighter side but holds a decent carbonation. Overall the beer is drinkable and pretty good from start to finish.","Knapp85","Dec 10, 2011"
3.9,6,4,4,4,3,4,"This is a medium bodied brew that leaves an almost silky oily feel coating the inside of the mouth with every sip. However, it almost lacks a bit in body and gets watery towards the end instead of carrying the expected viscosity of an oyster stout. There was seemingly no alcohol inclusion and overall this was a pretty good brew. Certainly worth a try.","stakem","Dec 10, 2011"

3.65,-0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Shrug. This is almost more like a dry brown ale, though there are some intriguing additional flavors as well. You can definitely tell the alcohol is fairly low in this beer, and frankly, given the abv., the beer delivers an impressive amount of flavor. Nevertheless, there just isn't enough going on in this beer to make me want to order it again.","John_M","Nov 19, 2011"
4.58,24.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"O - I found the Pearl Necklace to be a great and unique beer. It is well balanced and easily drinkable. The oysters provide some interesting earth and brine notes that accentuate the beer without overwhelming it. Well done, and I only wish that it'll be widely available in the coming months. Great beer for a great charity.","WMEugene","Nov 16, 2011"
