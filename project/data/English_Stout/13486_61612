3.55,7.9,,,,,,"O: A decent stout, and certainly more characterful than some of their other brews. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour are replete with roasted malt and coffee notes. A solid bitterness rounds it off nicely. Body is OK but could stand to be a shade creamier. Goes down easily enough - worth sampling if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","Mar 29, 2014"

3.68,11.9,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Smoky aroma has notes of licorice, molasses and coffee - plus a strange, yeasty, almost plastic-like overtone, but this may be from something odd that happened to this particular batch. It pours a nice opaque sable with a fairly thick, if not too persistent, light tan head that leaves some generous lacing. Flavor has a strong smoky note plus tones of licorice, molasses and coffee and a hint of unsweet chocolate. The mysterious plastic-ish note seems to diminish as I consume the beer. Smooth texture has firm body and a good amount of fizz. Not the best stout I’ve had, but still pleasing.","Cyberkedi","Mar 23, 2012"

3.39,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"From the 25 fl. oz bottle. Sampled on November 22, 2011. It pours dark mahogany-brown with some nice clarity, an adequate head, a little lacing. I think I expected something more opaque. The aroma is definitely pungent but not in the aromas typical to a stout. It is more like sweet malts, molasses, and black licorice. The body was thin to medium. Sweet on the front end but somewhat bitter on the end. I think I would liken it more to an Irish Black Lager than a Stout.","puboflyons","0"

3.73,13.4,3.5,3,4.5,3,3.5,"O: I feel that this beer is a bit underrated, but I also wish it were more consistent across the board. A nice appearance and an outstanding flavor profile coupled with a ho-hum nose and mouthfeel reduce what could have been an outstanding English stout to merely an above-average English stout.","mrfrancis","May 04, 2011"
3.75,14,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This seems to be a fine example of the style overall with generous roasted barley characteristics all around.","CHADMC3","Jan 18, 2011"
3.22,-2.1,3.5,4,3,2.5,3,"An ok English stout, but lacks depth. Drinkability and appearance are great, but slightly less carb could tone down the astringency for an improvement.","Thads324","Jan 07, 2011"
3.09,-6.1,4.5,3,3,3,3,"D - A decent brew but not something I'd want to have a whole lot of. This would be much better from a cask.","BeerFMAndy","Nov 08, 2010"
3.25,-1.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This is a true English Stout. Some good characteristics, but for the price tag, I won't be picking up Lancaster Black again.","TheDTrain","Nov 02, 2010"
3.41,3.6,4,3,3,3.5,4.5,"Very low ABV, and nothing bad about this make this incredibly drinkable. However, nothing about this is exceptionally out of the ordinary, so I'm not sure how often I'd revisit this.","EgadBananas","Sep 04, 2010"
3.6,9.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Ebony with cherry highlights when backlit and a slight sand colored head that shrinks to a skim of foam and leaves sheets of fine lace on the glass. Dark chocolate and roasty and smokey malt notes in the aroma. Cocoa, anise and smoked malt with faint herbal hop bittering. The flavors are well balanced and harmonious if slightly underwhelming. Lighter bodied and smooth. Easy drinking and tasty, a good English session ale.","biggred1","Beers"
3.25,-1.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Pretty nice appearance. Deep and rich with a full head. Nose is really decent, as well. Nice combination of grain and sweet components. Flavor is full with a subtle sweet character. Feel is a bit washed out and not the best finish. Overall, this is a pretty decent quaff.","bmwats","0"
