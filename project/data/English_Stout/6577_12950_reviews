"Overall it is a good stout. Seems like a nice entry level for people moving on from commercial stouts to the higher quality real ale and craft ale brands."

"500ml bottle, bottle-conditioned. ap: almost black, long-lasting thick head. sm: roasted barley. ta: blackcurrant. mo: fairly light due to high carbonation. Ov: worthy stout, with a tang that is not sweet. Full of flavour. One of the longest-available bottle-conditioned ales in the UK."
"Old school. Dark but not cloying, well-attenuated, no coffee or chocolate notes - just lean black malts. A winner."

"Fantastic - an excellent stout with a big flavour. Decidedly malt-driven, with plenty of roasty notes and bitterness. Looks the part, and the body is well-judged. This is exactly what I imagine when I think of the perfect English stout. A sterling effort from the Titanic brewery, and well worth sampling if you come across it."

"Like the bottled version, it is creamy and fullbodied, the flavours stay in the mouth. Really enjoyed it."
"Benchmark I guess a good standard stout, solid decent and enjoyable if not world class."
"D. Not a bad stout at all but there are better versions to be had out there."
"not pretend real!"
"Notes: Best before 09/05/11. Solid example of a nice sessionable stout. Plenty of flavor especially given the ABV and flavor. This helps put away the myth that beers need a high ABV for high flavor. Well balanced and good integration of all the typical stout flavors. Really enjoyable stout, it's unfortunate that it doesn't get exported. Definitely worth grabbing although I'm not sure if it's quite good enough to go to a lot of trouble for."
"Fan-freaking-tastic stuff."
"This beer pours a jet black colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger creamy head,it has aromas of dark roasted coffee,chocolate and blackcurrants,it has an above average mouthfeel that feels full at the start and finishes a little light with notes of roasted expresso coming thru with a watery hop finish not bad but definately no world beater by any means."
"OVERALL: A nice beer, could drink a few, but there are others out there that are more impressive. I won't be looking for this again, but if I came across one by chance I wouldn't hesitate."
"M&D: superbly balanced on the body and smooth on the mouthfeel, yet retaining a light, even refreshing palate throughout. The sourness and bitterness are tuned to such an extent that every single element is in a harmonious state A remarkable old-fashioned stout on draught!"
"Served from a nice looking 500 ml bottle , CAMRA approved. Jet black beer with a nice rocky off white head. Limited carbonation. Aroma is roasty malt, maybe a little bit of earthy English hop deep in the background. This is a beer that needs to be served at the correct temperature, at fridge temp it had a very subdued roasty flavour, with thick mouthful. After it warmed up a little, wow, a wonderful smooth chocolate maltyness came through, lovely. The full mouthful and smooth chocolate flavour developed into a wonderful mocha flavour that was something to savour. I couldnt detect much hop character, all chocolate and roast malt. Finishes with smooth roasty bitterness. Great beer, one of the smoothest easy drinking stouts that I have tasted, they pull that chocolate thing off so nicely, it never descends into astringent bitterness."
"Overall - An excellent stout.... Highly recommended !!"
"A solid stout, a little too much of a dry lingering chalkiness but pretty good"
"Other comments: Definitely a solid, well-crafted stout. And this bottled version definitely deserves the ""CAMRA Champion Bottled Beer of Britain 2004"" title mentioned on the label; fresh and full-flavored."
"Really enjoyed it, light and approachable. Roasty, chocolatey, with a slight smoky character, with a touch of acid and citrus from the hops. Mild, yet tasty, nice soft mouthfeel, some chalkyness, medium long roasted finish, loved the texture and the flavour too."
