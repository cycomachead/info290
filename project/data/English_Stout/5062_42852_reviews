"Where many want Meantime's London Stout to be a current Stout, I don't mind is simpler elegance and its regal refinement as it would take a more advanced palate to appreciate all the nuances that this beer provides. Its a time capsule into two-hundred years ago. However I do acknowledge that the advancements in brewing have allowed to a superior brand of Stout in today's market."

"Dark brown, nearly black pour with just a tint of ruby. Two finger caramel-colored head with good retention and decent lacing. The nose has some solid roast with hints of cocoa, coffee, leather, and a touch of smoke. The taste follows suit with hints of coffee, dark chocolate, tobacco, cocoa, and smoke. Medium bodied with light carbonation but a bit thin for a stout. Overall, a solid English Stout, but nothing too special."

"This is so much fun than Guinness. Liked the more intense flavor, low sweetness and a hop twist you do not see on the mainstream stouts. I have the impression they intensify this brew comparing to older releases."

"A fairly typical, unexciting stout - drinkable, but not one I'd particularly want to have again."

"Nothing outstanding or particularly great about this one I'm afraid, it's not one of the better Meantime beers by any stretch of the imagination but it is drinkable and not too offensive.."
"Overall not very good. This is a big step down from their porters IMO, it's more like a watered down version of their porter and yet they call it a stout. I would call it a mild ale almost, which is may be a decent beer in that case, but even then it's very thin and watery, and the flavor profile is muted."

"O: Very drinkable. Indicated to coffee lovers..."

"Overall a lovely drinkable classic English stout. Love it."

"Dark black with a creamy white head. Carbonation is moderate and the texture is creamy, but medium bodied. Flavours include chocolate, coffe, dark fruits and roasted grain with a curious bitter mineral finish."
"Certainly better than I remember the bottled version and scored accordingly."
"Just lacking a little body, I reckon I could down a pint in one and that just isn't a London stout now is it?"
"OVERALL: While the look was unappealing, especially the lousy head, and the feel nothing to write home about, the nose and flavor were quite enjoyable. This one shows that you can have lots of nice aroma and flavor while holding to a lower abv. An enjoyable brew Iâ€™d definitely pick up again. Recommended."
"Overall a nice stout that has more to it than the ABV of 4.5% would have you believe. Prefer the tap version to the bottled version which was tasted about a year ago."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, although the beer seemed thin and boring in the beginning, it slowly grew and developed its unique flavour, but sadly there was only one bottle. Excellent session beer."
"Overall, a rather nice stout with a big flavour. Not sure how true it is to an original London stout, but worth seeking out to try."
"Meantime has better beers (their coffee stout), this is a rather ordinary porter, a bit on the sweet side."
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark brown color. Light and watery beer. Flavor and aroma: Smoky and Porto (wine). The formation of foam is low with a short duration. Smooth. It has good drinkability compared to its competitors in this style. I expected more."
"D - A very good exampole of the style."
"Quite drinkable since it's watery and not overly flavorful. Not a great brew to be honest, but could settle for worse. The smokiness makes it sort of interesting."
"Bummer."
"The aroma doesn't exist, can't smell anything.The taste is the same with hardly any flavor and its way to watery. All you can taste is a little hops."
"D - The drinkability is very good w/ easy sessioning stout qualities, a bit slick feel which has lighter bodied effect but to be expected for a session strength English stout- recommended"
"Drinkability: Another good beer from Meantime, heavy and full flavoured even given the low ABV."
"Nice head and delicate subtle aroma. Alas, the taste whilst pleasant is nothing special - lacking something in depth and character. I liked it more the first time I tried it, but I have been going off this of late."
"Drinkability is average as well, but I do think I want to try it again just to get a better feel for it."
"This beer pours a deep brown, with a one finger chocolate brown head to it. Very nice head retention, leaving spotty sticky lacing on the glass. Nose is of coffee, chocolate, caramel malts, some toffee and toasted malts. Taste is heavy on the roasted/toasted malts up front, then coffee and bitter dark chocolate hit you, the finish lends to caramel and toffee flavoring, with the tiniest touch of hops for bite. This is lighter bodied, with higher carbonation. I was utterly shocked with just how light this beer was. Crisp on the tongue with a creamier finish. This is a highly sessionable beer."
"This beer is a beautiful blackish-brown color (ruby hues if held to the light). The head is a dense tan with tightly packed bubbles. Great roasted grain aroma. Coffee and cocoa and a little burnt wood-like character. The smell, though, besides the roast, is quite clean. the taste is dry and full of roasted malt and barley flavors. The malt comes first, with a hightly roasted sensation...not quite burnt. Not much hop flavor, and very little bitterness (just for balance). I think that more bitterness comes from the roast than the hops. The mouthfeel is disappointingly light...a bit too watery. If the light body is for drinkability, I think it was overdone. A little more heft would have added a lot to the experience. Still, this is a very flavorful stout."
"M&D: the texture proves slightly too fizzy for my palate, while the light body and an evolving black-malt flavour profile have nevertheless rendered a decent drinkability. All's well-balanced, all's delicious for an English Stout. With or without wheat, ""only-malt"" or 80% malt, this dark ale evinces Meantime's craftsmanship yet one more time. In my opinion, this bottle-conditioned ale (or ""pasteurised but non-filtered"" - like a hefeweizen?) could well be really irresistible if the carbonation was much milder like a true real ale."
"Overall - A pretty decent stout although maybe a little rough round the edges... recommended though..."
"D - Apart from the apple note in the smell this is a top drop. Quite a sessionable stout. Some fresh, plump oysters went down nicely while sipping this."
"Drinkability: average, not subtle at all which hurts drinkability when the flavors happen to be so intense"
