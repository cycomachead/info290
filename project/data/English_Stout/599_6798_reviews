"This is available in grocery stores and dépanneurs in Quebec - i.e., pretty easy to get, even when coming over the river from Ottawa. I know this is a stout, but it really reminded me of a porter, i.e., a little bit thinner body. Totally drinkable, good taste, could become a winter standby."

"Overall: Very average. Could be used as a gateway for the Guinness drinker."

"Always one of my favorite beers from Boréale... i only wish I could buy it here at home :("
""
"Overall not bad, seems more like a porter, could easily have again."

"A pleasant surprise, bought randomly in a Quebecois grocery store, and definitely a beer I would seek out again."

"The appearance is jet black and the little head you get has no retention or lace. The smell is of chocolate and spoiled milk. It has a sweet taste for a stout-very little bitter notes. Like others in the style it pairs well with chocolate and spiced nuts. I could have two but no more than that, not a session stout."
"D: A good drinker."
"The beer is very opaque with a finger white head and good lacing. The smell and taste is surprisingly on the absinthe side, but slight malts and little hops could also be detected. The mouthfeel is smooth, yet true to the style, also very dry. This is a very sessionable beer and a good example of a stout. Try it if you are ever in Quebec"
"Overall a tasty and easy to drink stout."
"Interesting brew, some amazing stregnths, starting with the highly persistant head, creamy mouthfeel, and drinkability, but the flavor is a little unusual. This brew has a malty anise, or licorice taste, with some sweetness, and very little hops. Didn't get much in the aroma department. I suspect this is one beer you either love or hate. Put me in the ""love"" category."
"Notes from 09/22/06."
"D: Very high, I wouldn't have any problem to drink a six pack of those and asking for more."
"The flavor makes up for the lack of aroma. Some coffee flavors with a touch of cocoa. The body is way too thin for the style. This is a flavorful stout but is not world class."
"Overall, better than what I remembered. Actually, this is pretty darn good. I suspect that I never had it warm enough to really unleash the flavors. Beats Guinness and cheaper. Also, pretty good with food."
"Bottle courtesy of papat444. Crimson hued stout with a huge head. Nose- little bit of sweetness. Taste- medium roast, touch of smokiness and dark chocolate. slightly burnt taste and touch of sourness. low cabonation which makes for an easy drinking stout."
"Pours a clear brown/red, thick tan head, huge lace sheets on the glass, nitro style, great retention. Smell is sweet and malty, chocolate, bit of vanilla, roast, bready, pretty light but pleasant. Taste is nice, light chocolate milk, roast, sweet caramel, vanilla, dry finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Not too bad."
"D- Quite easy to drink. A good basic stout. This one went down very quickly without me noticing. A good local alternative to Guinness (not really that many widely distributed stouts in Quebec) but not up to a comparison with St-Ambroise."
"A very nice commercial stout...one of the best in Canada in a bottle."
"Santé"
"Black in color with thin dark tan head. The aroma is rich and dominated by a deep, roasty malt. The body is surprisingly full, with a slight hint of dark fruit turning gently roasty in the aftertaste. A bit fizzy at points, however, and overall not quite what I expected from the style. But not horrible."
"Licorice is the dominant aroma with some roasted nut notes. The flavor begins with a light malt, but the aftertaste explodes with chocolate and coffee notes. A bit thin bodied, and could use more flavor from start to finish, but this is still one worth trying if you've never had it before."
"Serviceable stout, though too carbonated and a bit thin. Black with thin head, and certain stout taste. Malts right there making it Drinkable. Not too dry after all the malt. Some chocalte malt, coffee, and burnt attempt at roastiness. Fine with food."
"Roast bread and chocolate flavours are felt after the opening of the bottle. After having spent a short moment in the mouth, we can appreciate a nice cocoa taste. Beautiful black color. Carbonation pretty high. A good stout, sweet and accessible. Easily the best beer made by « Brasseurs du Nord »."
"Drinkability: Some others reviewers didn't like too much, but I enjoyed to drink it. I emptied my glass much faster than lots of others stouts. Conclusion: This is my favorite Boreale product I reviewed."
"Ordered simply as ""la noire"" somewhere on St Laurent, this brew poured a dull black with a crisp narrow head, in an inviting pint glass. First sip has the strong body you'd expect from an English stout, but the positive impressions begin to dissolve when the taste coalesces into a bland, mild muddiness that lasts throughout the pint. Unrewardingly thick, with occasional crops of dusky cooking chocolate. Unless you look for a beer on the basis of mouthfeel and consistency alone, there is little to be found in this Blandsville brew. Caveat."
"Brown 341 mL bottle with best before date on rear label."
"Black, big tan head with decent lacing. Sweet coffee smell, feels almost like a sweet stout. Very sweet and round in mouth, commercial description has it about right with ""hints of liquorice"". It's just a little too sweet for my taste, but the looks (especially on tap) are beyond criticism. Hints of vanilla, decent roasty character. Above average stout."
"Comments  A tremendous thanks to Rastacouere for sending me this one. I agree wholeheartedly with Phyl21ca; this is very underrated."
"Real black brew with sweet coffee taste. Pourred a very large black head (very nice look). Not too mucy body and not too com-plex but still very enjoyable.The bitterness level is appropriate. I think this beer is very underrated. The draught version is more enjoyable then the bottle version but still very good"
"This is good. It's much better than I remembered. The toffee and chocolate dominate, but without being over-sweet or cloying. Very well done."
"It pours out suitably black, with only a little tan head. The smell is mostly chocolate malts with some coffee bitterness as well. Taste leans more towards a coffee flavour, with subtle caramel sweetness and again, touches of chocolate before the slightly bitter finish. Carbonation is fairly energetic, giving Boreale a lighter feel than most stouts, but also adding some peppery feel on the tongue. It's certainly a good beer, not outstanding but nice to drink. The extra alcohol and carbonation cause it to trend towards a dark ale, but the taste is dead-on stout."
