Artificial tasting, too mild and somewhat watery, this one ended up being a disappointment. Keep the nose and try to re-work the rest, as there is some real potential here.

4.27,10.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"O: Quite drinkable, but on the sweeter side. I honestly think that others have rated it lower than what it deserves simply because the brewery is not well known. After tasting CBS a few days ago, I would say this is a decent maple stout.","DaftCaskBC","Jan 05, 2012"
4.04,4.9,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"I'd drink it again so that says something, I like finding unexpected gems from obscure breweries and this one fits the bill","wordemupg","Dec 31, 2011"
3.45,-10.4,4,4,3.5,2.5,3,"O - If you like maple like I do, then your best bet is to just smell this beer all night long. The mouthfeel just ruins it. Still a good beer that is very drinkable, but could be so much more.","RuckusDu","Dec 21, 2011"
3.77,-2.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"It's tough to put out a good maple beer, given all the subpar offerings out there, but this manages to get all the flavours right.","CanuckRover","Nov 20, 2011"
3.94,2.3,3,4,4,4,4,"Just about no head on this, the color is... BLACK can see no light at all on the other side of the glass. Smells very sweet, malt and maple tones. Taste just about the same. Sweet with a light taste of maple. Goes down well with a crisp after taste. Very good beer, very recommended.","exodus1369","Nov 06, 2011"

3.57,-7.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Believe this to be a well made beer, but uncaramelized maple flavour isn't one I'd personally choose, so will probably not purchase again.","hopsolutely","Oct 12, 2011"
3.58,-7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a maple-heavy beer. For a maple lover, probably very good. Not being one, I don't think it is a great beer. Certainly delivers what it promises.","jrenihan","Oct 09, 2011"
3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Anyone else feel like pancakes? Now this is what I'd consider a 'breakfast stout'! Cannery Brewing's Maple Stout could easily be the darling of sweet toothed beer drinkers everywhere. A stout flavoured like maple fudge, pumpkin-pie spice and melted chocolate - it may be a cheap gimmick, but is there a better a cool-weather treat?","biegaman","Oct 08, 2011"
3.62,-6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: Quite a good stout with a well executed maple flavour. It's quite tasty and something I'd probably pick up again.","Digimaika2","Oct 06, 2011"
3.57,-7.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"In my years of drinking ales, this is certainly the first maple beer that I've actually enjoyed, which I find strange. I mean, it sounds amazing on paper - I love beer, I love maple syrup - but somehow every edition of the style seems to fall flat. Now, this brew still could use some work - the body isn't quite right and lacks the depth of a good American stout or RIS - but nevertheless, it's an enjoyable brew that fits the season well (and provides a welcome change from all those pumpkin ales!)","JohnnyBarman","Oct 03, 2011"
3.57,-7.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall – The beer has a great maple scent, but it needed more in the taste department. It actually reminded me a little bit of a vanilla coke. I'm happy I gave it a shot, but I'd buy something else next time.","spinrsx","Oct 03, 2011"
3.75,-2.6,4,4,4,2.5,3.5,"POurs almost black with some dark cola around the edges, tan head is thick and produced immediately. Loads of carbonation requires several attempts at the pours, but settles to a nice cap. NOse has alot of maple, dark and milk chocolate with more of a darker leaning. Hint of coffee. Taste is milk chocolate dipped in maple syrup, some caramel and vanilla notes; finish is a bit roasty. Mouthfeel is relatively light, and highly effervescent - offputting initially, but swirled it down to a more manageable level. Sweet, but expected for the advertised flavour profile. A decent stout that I could revisit, but the carbonation needs to be toned down quite a few notches.","liamt07","Oct 03, 2011"
3.92,1.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Quality stout that has enough maple flavour to be noticed, but isn't overpowering or too sweet. Could use a bit more body, but is quite drinkable and smooth as it is.","bryehn","Sep 29, 2011"
3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Deep brown, near black, one finger of tan head, some lace. Smell is of sweet maple, roast malt, coffee and chocolate, bread like qualities, smells a lot like a maple donut. Taste has lots of maple but not as much as the nose would lead you to believe, roasty and bittersweet, lightly sweet, maple in the finish and aftertaste. Med-high carb, med body, lightly watery and thin at points. This was really good and the bomber went quickly on my own, would love to see an imperial version of this.","peensteen","Jun 16, 2011"
3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O - a very nice maple stout and I had no difficulty sucking back this bomber (i.e. not too sweet) back.","Stocean1","May 05, 2011"
3.74,-2.9,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"O: This is the Canadian of flavoured beers; everything about it has a strong maple presence. It is one of the better maple stouts I have tried because, although it tastes strongly of maple, I don’t find it overly sweet. Definitely recommended for maple-lovers.","Tford","May 02, 2011"
3.52,-8.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"O/D - Not a bad stout at all but a bit misleading. Smells better than it tastes for sure. But it stills tastes pretty good and I had no problem getting this down, but I don't think I'll be revisiting it.","tbeckett","Apr 21, 2011"
3.67,-4.7,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"I believe this is a good solid stout. I'm a sucker for maple beers, so I had to give it a try.","TCgoalie","Apr 04, 2011"

4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D: This is my second beer from Cannery (Blackberry Porter) but when they say a flavor for a beer, they don't hold back. This stout has tons of maple from the aroma to the taste. So if you like maple you need to try this beer. If not I wouldn't recommend it because you'll have tons of maple.","marty21","Sep 03, 2010"
3.97,3.1,4.5,5,3.5,3,4,"Overall: Awesome maple aroma and a taste that while good, doesn't quite live up. It is still tasty and worth your while to check out.","papat444","Jun 17, 2010"
3.72,-3.4,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a medium black color stout with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light dry roasted malt notes with some notes clear notes of maple which are surprisingly quite enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by loads of maple notes with well balanced sweetness and some dry roasted notes. Body is a bit thin for style with some very good carbonation. Very interesting experiment with maple notes being clearly identifiable and some well balanced sweetness. Not sure I would have this often but well brewed nonetheless.","Phyl21ca","Jun 11, 2010"
4.24,10.1,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"D - the maple sweetness makes it very pleasant on the palate, left me craving the next taste like a desert does. Fairly easy drinking.","joemcgrath27","Jun 03, 2010"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"D - Delicious, but more of a dessert beer than anything. A little too sweet to be sessionable, but a very nice beer at that. Would highly recommend this to anyone as it is surprisingly delicious!","andrenaline","Dec 28, 2009"
4.44,15.3,3,4,5,4,4.5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and have been planning a maple stout for myself for a while. Now I have something to style it after.","kjyost","Dec 06, 2009"
4.22,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"650mL bomber. Pours a black color with a big creamy tan head that doesn't last. Really nice aroma of maple syrup, roasted malt, and coffee.. kinda smells like a pancake breakfast! The taste is more maple syrup, malt, and a little bit of bitterness. Medium bodied and very smooth. Leaves a nice maple aftertaste. The sweetness of the maple hurts the drinkability a bit and this is definitely not a session beer, but it makes a nice dessert beer. I really liked this!","chickenm","Dec 04, 2009"
4.37,13.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Overall"" I'm so glad we have brewers like Cannery in BC. Great Canadian beer, in the most stereotypical sense of the word. But they do it in a very complimentary way...","Hornet2003","Nov 08, 2009"
3.67,-4.7,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Once I adjusted to the mapleness ( shouldn't be necesaary...I'm Canadian afterall) nice Hoser take on traditional stout.","Shadman","Oct 29, 2009"
3.95,2.6,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Winter time only, I’d say. Not what I’d call a refreshing drink. After 650mL of this stuff I’ve had my fill for a while. I think of this one as more of a novelty to be had once in a while.","Methodd","Jul 23, 2009"
3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Like I said, its a stout with maple, and it does exactly what it says on the label. Thanks Bryan!","bobsy","May 31, 2009"

3.38,-12.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"A decent dry stout in its own right, although a bit rough around the edges all the same, while the maple character nearly disappears as it warms, remaining present as an underlying yet enjoyable sweetness more than a distinctive character. I didn't necessarily rate this high, yet I still have a soft spot for maple, and still commend Cannery for the effort.","IronDjinn","May 22, 2009"
3.95,2.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, a pleasantly tasty stout, with a variable maple goodness, and not too sweet. As much as I like the head-on maple assault of Amber's Sap Vampire, this one is much more judicious in its application of our national tree's effluent, and a very respectable addition to the growing Canadian maple-themed beer canon.","biboergosum","Feb 05, 2009"
3.77,-2.1,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"If you like maple, check this one out. I seriously am craving pancakes now. Not so much stout character gets through, but maple is a pretty strong flavour to compete with.","elricorico","Dec 01, 2008"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"I actually found the maple added a sweetness to the finish which increasesd the drinkability. The stout is pretty well made with enough mouthfeel to satisfy ( not as good as Back Hand Of God but still a good BC stout) I like the way the maple cut the bitterness and added to the balance of the beer","canucklehead","Beers"
3.26,-15.3,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Nice beer, but the sour character from the maple forces me to sip this one when it could easily almost be a session stout.","BDTyre","0"
