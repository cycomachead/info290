"clever beer this one, an oyster stout also brewed with clams. i expected a way more seafoody beer, i almost expected this to be gross, but i was so curious i had to grab it. pours like a nice rich stout, dark mocha head on a big black beer. nothing out of the ordinary there, save the high viscosity and low alcohol. the nose shows some light briny saltiness, but its less about the sea as it is about the protein added from these little critters. they add a ton of body without a ton of fishiness, not at all what i was anticipating in this one. there ids a coffee smelling side here, and its a little weird with the oceanic properties, but it comes together in the flavor, where its less of a raw bar and more of a chargrilled shellfish profile. the dark malt helps to balance, and all that protein gives the beer a slick yet large body, interesting to say the least. the finish is remarkably dry for what it is, and the beer on the whole is very good. never though clams would make a good addition, especially to this type of beer. i dont love love it, but i really admire it. more cleverness for the italians. It would be neat to see this done in a series or beers all with one accent flavor for shellfish, curry, herbs, wine, could be even more interesting in terms of food..."
"Pours a dark brown/black with a quickly dissipating half a finger thick head.  Smells of dark roast malt, coffee and chocolate.    Tastes of roast malt, salt/brine, a little pine and dark chocolate.  A briny and roast malt aftertaste with a hint of oyster.  Medium body medium carbonation"

"Can't taste oyster at all, tastes just like any other stout, which is not a style I'm into."
"Medium, close to full bodied, rather light carbonation."

"Overall, this is a really solid, very easy-to-drink stout. The handpump really brought it out in its best light I think. It's a really cracking brew."

"It's got an almost crisp body on the light side of medium. It fits for the style as an English variant, though I understand the American urge to beef up the body. It has a tangy, sharp(ish) semi-dry finish."

"I'm fairly new to beers other than your run of the mill pilsner types so my review will be very simple. This beer was salty! It was slightly fishy (oyster-y) which I believe was the point, but the overwhelming characteristic for me was salt. I won't have it again."

"O/D - An interesting beer but fairly difficult to get through the entire bottle. Not bad, but the minerality of it made it hard to drink. Neat to see the effects of the oysters, but not worth much beyond the experiment."
"This is actually an oyster stout but felt this was closest given i didnt have the option of the first and pours the darkest kola hue which leaves a two finger khaki laced head and heaps of nice clingy lacing,the smell is salty sea water,dark rich chocolate,herbal hops and dark roasty coffee,the mouthfeel is just under medium bodied and a touch slippery not what i expect in my stouts but due to the oysters i can understand and has tastes of dark rich chocolate,dark milky coffee,cocoa nibs,dark plums,a touch of chocolate coated cherries and finished with a touch of saltiness that leaves your mouth dry and wanting another sip and overall its alright and the oysters definately let themselves known thats for sure and even for someone like me whos not the biggest fan of oysters i must admit i dont get the oyster taste just the sea saltiness and even though i would not rush out and buy it again i can appreciate it for what it is cheers."
