It's not that it tastes bad; I like my beers malty and this one isn't too bad albeit a little one-dimensional. I think it's trying to be two things at once and doesn't really hit the spot on either count. Compared to something like Sam Smiths Oatmeal Stout, Bad King John is looking pretty woeful. Not a drain pour because I enjoyed the taste, but I can't see me seeking this out again.","interzen","Nov 26, 2014"

The taste is less pleasing - a touch too much roasted malt and burnt grain crowd out the other flavours, resulting in an excessively dry bitterness. Body could be a tad more meaty.

Light flavor of dark caramel malt, slight hops. Flavors nice but very subdued. Like most of the beer from this brewery, the flavors are OK, but too bland and low key. Light to medium bodied.

This brew pours a very dark brown topped by a sad excuse for a bubbly head (it's not its fault, though...the cask affects performance). The nose comprises figs, black grapes, light maple syrup, and some light strawberries. The taste holds notes of chocolate powder, light maple syrup, figs, dates, red grapes, and a hint of oak. Wow, didn't see all o' that comin'. The body is a solid medium, with no real carbonation and a very smooth feel.

A nice, smooth chocolate-brown pour to black, blocking out any light, with a full 2-finger reddish tan head and nice lace retention. The aroma was mild, some chocolate & malt-cookie. The flavor was a bit more smoky, with roasted malt & bitter hop edges. Dark chocolate presence without being overwhelming. Medium body & very drinkable as a porter-ale.

The malt is front and center in this beer. There's also a notable yeast flavor and aroma in the brew. Occasional fruity qualities appear and fade, particularly raisin and plum-like.

This gradually transforms into a drier, toastier character with gradually increasing bitterness including pepper and spice (licorice, perhaps), and light hints of bitter chocolate and unsweetened coffee. The change is smooth and gradual, to a lightly bitter, dry finish containing the pepper, etc. The bitterness lingers, slowly getting a little stronger to fill the mouth before fading. Hwoever, nothing is sharp or burn tasting, the bitterness is not clinging or unpleasant (it stops just short of getting unpleasant), and it has a nice spicey-coffee character.
