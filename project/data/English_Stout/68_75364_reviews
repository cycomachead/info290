"Nice balance flavor chocolate notes with a medium body very smooth coffee flavor."
""

""

"I liked it very much."
"I couldn't ask for much more from an oyster stoudt. Great look. You can really taste the flavors. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I am."
""
""
""

"O: This one isn't what I was hoping for to say the least. The body is a bit too thin to showcase what the oyster shell  adds to it."
"Overall: didn't really get any of the oyster flavor I was expecting, just a slight briny saltiness. Still a decent stout though."
"Opaque motor oil color. Roasty and caramelized malt aroma and flavor with a hint of brineyness."

"Quality beer. Great example of an oyster stout."
"My new favorite thing from Flying Dog.  This light for a stout.  It strikes me as more of a porter in color, clarity, and body.  But it definitely has the bigger stout flavor.  I never thought of a stout as being refreshing, but this one really is.  The aroma is roasty, chocolatey, and bready but with a hint of salty sea breeze (if that's possible).  The flavor is very much like the aroma.  It is at once dark and comforting, but at the same time crisp and refreshing.  It's brewed with oysters and if you close your eyes and use your imagination you can picture a nice bowl of oyster stew to go along with this brew.  A bonus is that purchase of this beer benefits planting new oysters in the Chesapeake Bay as part of the Oyster Recovery Program.  I can't wait to have another.  After finishing the beer the aroma left behind in the empty glass finally sparked what I perhaps like so much about it.  It reminds me of a chocolate bar with cracked sea salt.  Yeah, it's good."

"This beer had a  roasty taste.  The slight saltiness enhanced this nice fairly low bodied stout."
""
""

"Pretty good, & very interesting being brewed with oysters!"
""
""

"O: [3.25] This is not to noteworthy.  It is a decent stout.  I would not reject another - but I would not seek it out.  The charred wood flavor is nice - but the body is a bit lacking."

"Mostly black with a tinge of red at the bottom of the glass and a brown head that dies to a ring.. A/T is roasted malt, chocolate, raisins and a slighty salted tatse stays on the tounge.. Good but not great."

"I love this stout, the Oysters give it a slight briny flavor that mixes so well, a nice Big Beer that has a quirkiness that makes it stand out from the rest"
""
""
"Overall – Not really much oyster going on in this one.  Besides the nose, which gives a decent level of saltiness, overall the brew is really just a drier and roastier stout.  OK, but nothing exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer reminds me somewhat of Gonzo Imperial Porter; huige, bold malt-forward tastes, powerful flavors. Flying Dog's big beers just seem so...BOLD. I liked this beer."
""
""

"Far and away my favorite Flying Dog beer. Strong roast aroma that goes down surprisingly smooth. Delicious."

"Massive roast on the nose, deep, dark, and charred. Maybe a little brine and sulfur. Taste is more of the same. Huge roasty malts that leave a lingering ashy chocolate note in their wake. Just a trace of sulfur and brine is found at the finish. The abundant roastiness makes this more American than English to me, but that doesn't really matter. This is damn good beer, that's what matters. Proceeds from the sale of this beer help seed the Chesapeake Bay. Kudos to Flying Dog."
"Here's a go at my first oyster stout. Nice dark body. Thick tan foam. So far good. Very chocolaty smell. Some smoked aromas. Glad it doesn't smell like the sea. Wow, what a bitter taste. Dark chocolate flavors, coffee, toffee. Little mineral flavor. Again, glad it doesn't have a fishy taste. Its a little too bitter for my stout liking, but much better than I thought it would be. ADDITIONAL INFO: Well, by the end of the glass, it got kind of oystery. A little to powerful for me. I enjoyed the first half, not the second."

"Love this beer. Not a style that is very approachable for the casual craft enthusiast. The appearance is a cloudy dark brown with a thick cream head. The smell was a mixture of sweetness from the malt and a little bit of hops. The taste however is very different. Starting out with the caramel and coffee and then at the end it was cut by the salty, fatty flavor of the oysters. I found it incredibly satisfying and refreshing. Not for the faint, but a wonderful find."
""
"O - this is a fine stout, very mild bodied and smooth for a stout, drinkable, nice smokey and salt characters both for smell and taste. The hint of oysters is ever so subtle but extremely nice to pair with the smokey and salt flavors."

"First beer I bought in Maryland from my relocation from Oregon. Was interested in trying something new the the ""Oyster"" aspect triggered my interest. I brought it home and when I pored it it was had a nice off white head. Smelled like a typical stout, but had a light roasted malt smell that I am used to. The oysters are pretty noticeable and the beer had a slimy finish... I was pretty dissatisfied in the overall quality of the beer... with the sliminess and the lack of a backbone, I would not buy it again."
""
""
"Taste like a liquid ashtray or cigarette butt.  Not my thing!  I prefer Exit 1 for an oyster stout."
""
""
""
""
"BBD 226/14. Pours used motor oil black with a nice head. Outstanding lacing and average retention. Nice nose of chocolate, anise and roast over a slight salty sea note. Light medium bodied with a smooth texture that approaches slick. Below average carbonation with almost no effervescence on the finish. Extremely well balanced flavor profile that has some complexity, but is not as intense as Bell's Kalamazoo or FBS. It begins with a chocolate note that flows into a slight roast bitterness. Underneath is a very subtle saltiness. The finish is smooth and the finish leaves you with a lingering chocolate bitterness and a touch of salt."

"Very easy to drink and tastes good. The oyster is very subtle."

"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with small, creamy, beige head and nice lacing. Aroma is of toasted malt, bread crust, herbal hops and see bay. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of toasted, bready malt, coffee, salt, oysters, brown sugar, burnt grain and herbal hops. Finish is long, bitter, and salty. Very nice brew, would be classic with shellfish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours jet black from the bottle with a light foam, light beige/off-white two-finger head which dissipates down to a solid covering of froth on the top of the beer with solid lacing on the glass. Nose is actually fairly light, but contains all the usual stout notes - dark malt, dark chocolate, toffee, a touch of wan espresso, and, though I may be mistaking it, there does seem to be a hint of bitter citrus hops. Also, perhaps it’s the name, but it does seem that there is a hint of oyster sauce in there, not briny oysters and seaside air mind you, but a hint of the slightly briny but mostly sweet Hoisin-like Asian condiment. Sip is toffee and lightly bitter chocolate up front, and is actually somewhat sweet. The middle of the tongue sees more of the bitterness with dark coffee notes taking over along with what seems a touch of vanilla and a hint of sweet citrus fruit...yeah...I know...that one seems weird, but it really does seem to be there. Back of the tongue sees more coffee notes along with a hint of toffee and the finish, which is pretty short and simple, is lightly sweetened coffee. Mouthfeel is actually quite light and the carbonation, like most everything from Flying Dog, is a bit heavy. So, the big question is, where is the oyster in all of this? The classic hint I can find is a note approaching oyster sauce in the midpalate when it warms slightly, but as a whole, I can’t find any and can’t help but wondering if there might have been a better use for those local oysters. As it stands this is a perfectly decent stout, nothing especially grand, but also quite sessionable due to its heavy carbonation, light-for-the-style mouthfeel, nice hints of sweetness amidst the roastier bitter notes, and low ABV."

"Had one of these left at the house during the last fire pit. I have seen this beer at beer nerd locations in Carolina, PA, Virginia, and New Jersey but have never tried it being from Frederick. I always want something from somewhere else. Anyway, here we go. Nothing to shout about in appearance and offers very little to the nose. Taste was good, but far from great. Plus, the low ABV for a stout causes me to ding it again. This is a miss for me."

"O: This is not a bad little stout. Oyster stouts generally don't do it for me, but this one really isn't bad. As a matter of fact, it's nice to see such an obscure style get some love from an American brewery."
""
""
""

"The taste is very nice - some roasted malts, slight bitterness. Very drinkable, definitely nothing bad about it."

""
""

""

"This pours a very dark brown/black color with a slight off-white head. The aroma is slightly malty and robust. The taste is light and roust with a fairly thin texture. Overall this is a pretty light in taste and texture stout that drinks very easily."
""
"Poured a blackish body with minimal tan head that dies slow with minor lace. I get a little sweetness in the aroma but even that is more bitter chocolate than anything. Some large chunks of roasted malt and a splash of coffee also hit me in the nose. The beer is medium to heavy bodied, slightly chewey. enjoyable sipper but a mostly dry stout with roasted malts ( and again I get this coffee thing) dominating and just minor bitter chocolate notes mixed in. The finish seems a little grainy so I suppose this is where the oyster kick is which isn't bad as it isn't burdensome and lends itself to the beer. Also seems to have a touch of wood since it goes down smooth. Not a bad stout at all but one that is a little simple for my liking."
""
""

"O - Not as odd as I thought. This is my first oyster stout and I like it. Extremely dry at the finish aster a good progression of flavors."

"Overall, a really nicely done oyster stout. I love the mineral character and some nice chocolate and roasted notes. Decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste comes across as highly balanced with a moderate upfront sweetness and toasted malt flavor and then there is a low and dry bitterness which hangs briefly at the finish. This one was well done."
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s an ok beer to drink for something a bit different."

"Great name. The beer pours with a deep, utterly black color. It's head is thick, tan and very creamy. Large tufts of lace are left on along the glass. The smell is solid, but I expected a little more. It's full of roasted, malty scents. A little earth and charcoal, some subtle coffee smells. The taste is very good....semi-dry and very full. Lot's of grain flavors. Some smoke and a lot of smoothness. The mouthfeel has some interesting salty and calcium-reminiscent characteristics...perhaps from the oysters? Lingering bitterness. This is a good beer, well worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First thing that strikes me is the beautiful color; black around the edges with a deep blood red hue shining through the middle. The head dissipated quickly and left very little lacing. Smells like roasted coffee, some herbal hops, briny sea salt near the end. The flavor was absolutely phenomenal, faithfully following the nose with coffee, roasted grain, dry chocolate, sea salt, and woody, herbal hops at the end. Thankfully does not taste like oysters. Went down easy with a slight carbonic bite and a medium thin mouthfeel. A great stout, even with the gimmick of seafood in it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very interesting stout and one I'd probably come back to when pairing with a meal."
""
""
""
"Overall - I feel like I missed the whole ""brewed with oysters"" flavor maybe a hint of it on the aroma but that might have been my imagination. Overall a very fine beer just missing the gimmick from the label."
""
"An enjoyable stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very light oyster stout. With a great approach. Of of the dogs' best."
""
""
""
"Overall interesting but nothing i'd rush out to get again"
""
""
"The body is quite thin and the beer is a bit lacking in flavor."
""
"O: This is a nice stout from Flying Dog. The oysters do add a nice, albeit subtle, complexity to what would otherwise be a straightforward beer. The slightly salty, mineral flavors towards the finish are welcome, in my opinion."
""
""
"Overall I'm happy to have tried it. Love oysters, and appreciate the inclusion. Probably other comparable abv stouts I'd prefer to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good stout. Best if you enjoy a stout that is dominated by malts. I enjoy the taste, but would like a more powerful aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this isnt a bad stout I prefer others over it but I would drink this again."
""
""
" The flavor has a nice creamy caaramel flavor with light roasted barley flavor with some mild mineral and slight bitter flavors in the background. The taste is kind of a mix of sweet stout and dry irish with the smoothness of yeast and some slight spice from the hops. Overall this is a pleasant and drinkable stout, pretty good considering the relatively low abv. It conveys a mix of sweet stout with an american oyster addition which I actually like enough to have multiples of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Smooth, briny, earthiness, soft charcoal, kiss of hops, and a roasty finish. What a great unique flavor! It would probably be delightful with twelve fresh half-shells."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Time may have done this one well, or it may have been pretty good to begin with. A very good stout with a unique oyster twist. Try it."
"I like oysters and I like stouts. I even like the two in the same glass! Flying Dog did well with the Pearl Necklace. A respectable alternative as a ""lighter"" stout."
""
""
"Overall: Moderately roasty with a slightly sweet finish and a little understated brine/oyster saltiness that gives the beer a unique character that differentiates it from a typical dry or sweet stout."
"Nice stout but I wish I could taste some oyster."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a beer I would buy again, but not bad. I think it was really brewed for the shock value, but it is a pretty good beer, and worth the try. I think it would be better though without the mineral and salt water taste."
""
"Overall - I can't really taste oysters.. but it a pretty tasty beer for sure. It has a nice well balanced taste is extremely drinkable. Seems like a great session beer despite the slightly higher ABV,"
"O- this is orobably the most mineral/salt forward oyster stout that I've tried to date, but its not overpowering. Overall an enjoyable take on the style"
""
""
""
""
"o: an interesting style and a good beer no doubt, but the oyster influence is very subtle, a good cause (bay preservation) and a tasty stout in it’s own right"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I don't think this is a beer that I'd drink again, even though the taste was far better than the smell suggested it was going to be. I can't help but wonder if the whole ""brewed with oysters"" thing was messing with my head, because oysters and beer just seem like an odd couple combination. I like oysters and I like stouts, but the two combined just didn't quite do it for me."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"An interesting stout brewed with actual oysters. Rich and smooth with a nicely balanced and complex feel throughout. A very nice variation on a classic dark ale style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"definitely my favorite flying dog brew to date. brewed with Chesapeake bay oysters? who would have thought? velvety looking black color, cocoa powder aromatics oozing out, bubbly and dense tan head, black licorice and tobacco on the nose as well. I don't smell fish at all, and this doesn't taste salty. instead I get bittersweet roasted barley, chocolate malt, and faint espresso notes. the texture is what makes this beer for me, creamy and rich, while retaining its drinkability. nice as an after dinner session beer, or as an interesting conversation piece. im not usually a huge fan of flying dog, but this beer really steps it up in both creativity and execution. worth seeking out. any other good oyster beers out there? how did this start? I want to know more..."

"3.5 D: I'm not sure if I've ever had a stellar oyster stout, but they always seem to be pretty good. They intrigue me."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty disappointing to be honest and not a beer I would recommend, not because it was a bad stout but because it was so basic throughout. Whilst drinkable this one was just a little too bland to really enjoy."

"OVERALL: A good little stout here. Lends itself well to be a nitro beer. A fine craft offering without a doubt. Older style done well by the mega craft brewery. There is a place in the world for a beer like this, it's called your local bar."

"O: I like this beer (though I hate the name); not over complicated but balanced and tasty"

""

"O - My first ever Oyster Stout, and I enjoyed this brew. A powerful, uniqe flavor that I will enjoy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all I'd say it's got a bit too much bite for a stout. There's a good creaminess to it. The crispness tames with time, but there's still quite a hard nip, even going into a slightly drier finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is a tasty beer, and worth getting again."
""
""
"O: Overall smooth flavor wise, some oyster, but wish there was more kick."
""
"A good stout to drink anytime. It brings enough roast flavors to be interesting but doesn't have a super high ABV or extremely thick body; drinkable. The oysters lend just a tiny bit of mineral flavor that almost reminds me of collecting seashells/being by the sea, random but it's what comes to mind."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, earthy black malt scent along with a hint of chocolate malt sweetness. There is a creamy character that really enhance the dark malt feel. The oysters lend a bit of depth to the aroma that really rounds out the aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, earthy black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry. There is a bit of chocolate malt in there as well that provides some added sweetness and complexity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific seasonal beer. It's quite drinkable and is full of flavor."
"Poured into nonic pint glass. Jet black with a thick brown head that dissipates after a bit, leaving nice lacing. Smells of chocolate and bitter coffee. Taste is roasted coffee, a lot of open, watery taste to it with a bitter chocolate/hop finish. I haven't had oysters before, but I don't taste anything out of the ordinary or shellfish-y in this beer. Perhaps it's in that sort of open slipperiness. Either way, it's still a great stout."
""
""
""
""
"Pours very dark brown with purple tints, some red. Ring of tan foam. Malty dark nose. Some dark chocolate too. Taste is a gritty burnt coffee. There is something a touch different, probably influenced by the title. Somewhat earthy. Very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty well crafted stout."
""
"3.64/5.00"
""
"O - never been too impressed w/ flying dog beers. This was different. definitely buy again"
""
""
"Overall - good overall brew. refreshing with some interesting flavors."
"Pours a dark rich black depths of hell tone with a light tan head, even lights up the room with the hop of pearls trapped in your oyster however, I have find myself an approachable roasted malt accented stout. Aroma has hints of sea salt and mineral water with an earthy dark roast character, flavor wise we dive into the mix of dark roasted malt bitterness with a soft chocolate blanket and salty earth notes. A bit one dimensional but a drinkable version of a dry stout. Mouthfeel is medium thin at times compared to other bigger stouts on the market this isn't trying to be that, it's a middle of the road oyster infused dark beer. That's really my overall impression."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is absent of salty shellfish, oyster or otherwise. What I found was nice malty, chocolatey taste that tended towards molasses. Slightly sweet and a touch dry the taste is easy and enjoyable. The feel is watery and light which does tend to the ease of drink but does not lend to a true craft beer feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Pearl Necklace Oyster stout is a decent light abv stout. The beer poured a opaque black with egg shell white head that is leaving some lace. The scent has nice coffee base with hints of semi sweet chocolate and caramel. The taste start with a subtle push of hops then the coffee flavors kick in which then yields to a sweet caramel finish. The mouthfeel is light to medium body with very smooth carbonation. Overall it is a very good session able stout."
""
""
""
""
"Pearl Necklace Oyster Stout pours out a deep brown color with a finger of head that quickly drops to a cap. The aroma is pretty stout-typical, with roasted malt and sweet chocolate. Thankfully, the taste does offer a bit of salty brininess that too many oyster stouts miss out on, providing a great amount of depth to the chocolate flavors akin to a sea-salted chocolate bar. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and gently carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, Pearl Necklace is a good oyster stout."
"(O)- This is just a nice, easy drinking stout when you want those classic stout flavors without having to tear into a thick and meaty Russian Imperial or American Double. Simple but satisfying."
""
""
"this is the frist oyster stout i have had and it just taste life a stout thought a oyster stout tasted diffrent but this beer pours dark with a big head nothing more i can stay a dark beer worth drinking yes but thats it drinks dark looks darks what do oyster taste like because its not in this beer drink this beer if you like dark beer but it you have drank oyster stout before then you know what they should taste like and i think there better ones out there because this just taste like a regular stout"

"Pours a very dark brown, almost black in color. Thin but creamy tan head. Aromas of roasted meats and a bit of salt. Taste begins with an almost briny character, followed by a savory coffee middle, and an earthy, coffee finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall quite a good beer. This may be the first Oyster Stout I've had."
""
"Overall: A nice stout with plenty of rich, dark roasted malt flavor."
""
"Lot of great art on the cover - for a cover of a semi-good beer. Don't get me wrong; were this the 1st stout I ever had I may love it. However, I am a stout / porter fan, so I naturally feel I know them best... This is marginal for a stout and a slightly tasty porter at best..."
""
""
""
""
"The stout's high level of carbonation, dryness, and hop character suggest an American-style Stout as opposed to more supple, sweet, and calmer English versions. Those need the salty must of shellfish for balance and palatability. But in this design, the salts exacerbate much of it's already overbearing quality."

"Overall- yes- two of my favorites, dark beer , and oysters very tasty. Obviously it would compliment seafood and I think any dish where lemon was a feature ( oddly enough). Not having much to compare it to in the oyster stout category I would say that this is a winner!"

"O: Overall a nice beer to have with some fish and fries went nicely."
""
"Nice to see an oyster stout out there and this is a nice one, I have to say. Nice little sweet thing going on, in a stout kind of way. Consistent flavor. Carbonation seems a bit high. Probably detracts from the flavor delivery. But this is a very nice beer. I like it."
"Overall this was very good and quite enjoyable. This was much better than I expected it to be and a beer that I’d seek out again. The low ABV made this go down very quickly, and it is a definite session beer to me."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/27/2013. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, light oyster, and light floral hops. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance of roasted malt notes. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, caramel, toffee, light oyster, floral, and earthy spiciness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, caramel, toffee, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of roasted flavors, with good complexity; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice stout! Nice balance and robustness of roasted flavors; and really easy and smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
"Overall: A particularly light oyster stout with only the faintest hints of the salty, briny, mineral-laden overtones that most have. Go on, slip one to your vegan friends."
""
""

"Good color, a bit more head on the pour would be nice. Not much smell of the oysters and not much in the taste. A little disappointing since it is prominently displayed on the bottle. Balance is good between hops, malt and alcohol. Good roasted notes from the grain without being overly done or burnt."

"The beer is black with a half inch of creamy, beige head that coats the glass with filmy lacing. The aroma offers roasted malt, biscuits. It certainly smells like an English stout. I can't detect any oyster presence in the aroma or the flavor, but perhaps it's better if the oyster character is subtle. Still, I'd like it to be more present. The beer tastes fine otherwise. Light to medium in body with appropriate carbonation. Low alcohol and well balanced. What it lacks in character it atones for, at least to a certain degree, with drinkability."

"OK brew. Blind I'd think this was porter. Nice aromas; decent flavors, but nothing spectacular."

"Dark brown-black color with a small foamy tan head. Aroma of dark malts, toasted grains, unsweetened cocoa. More of the same in the taste, dark malts, bitter cocoa, toasted bread, some mild leafy and earthy hops, and a bit of mineral from the oysters, that was really more implied in the mouthfeel than in the taste, as with most oyster stouts (in my opinion). Body was mid-range, about right for an English-style, so no real complaints there, though the roastiness added a little oomph. Pretty good overall."
""
"Fuller medium body, milder carbonation, creamy and full on the tongue. The chalky mineral tones in this threw me off a bit, but the body was really the highlight of the beer."

"Drank straight out of the bottle from a Flying Dog variety pack. Another great offering from Flying Dog and an attempt at a unique Maryland style brew. This is a very drinkable beer that is also a great example of this style. While I did not pair this with seafood I would imagine that this is a great beer to slug down along with some crabs and oysters."

"Overall - A pretty typical stout. I can't believe I'm writing this, but where's the oyster? Ahh, there it is, very subtle at the end, after the beer warms. This is my first stout brewed with oyster, so I wasn't sure what to expect coming in. Outside the aroma, it's nearly non-existent. Is this a good thing? Guess I'll have to give other oyster stouts a go to find out."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, and some coffee. The taste is similar to the aroma, but the oyster mineral/brine flavor is noticeable. It's a sweet smelling brew, but overall the flavors are more bitter. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has good carbonation, and it's also easy to drink. I think this is a good beer overall, and I'd try it again in the future."
""
""
"This beer pours up a beautiful deep black with a one finger tan colored head dissipating to a thin retention ring and bits of lacing. The smell is coffee, and chocolate. Taste basically follows the nose. It is malt forward with toffee, cola, coffee, chocolate, and caramel notes. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying with just a hint of oyster aftertaste. This one surprised me. It was much better than I expected."
""
"Had this one on a past ticking trip to Asheville! Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a massively dark reddish brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, toasted malt, subtle salt, and slight cocoa powder. The flavor was of sweet malt, toasted malt, milk choclate, powdered chocolate, and very subtle salt. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. An oyster stout you say? If this is indeed an oyster stout, where are the oyster-ish aspects? There was hardly any. Maybe there was a kiss of brine, but that was about it. I'm sure they added a little to the mouthfeel, but I would have loved to see a little more of their presence. After having had a few good examples I have set the bar pretty high with these. Glad I got to try it but there are other better examples out there."

"T: I'm actually a pretty big fan of this beer. I don't get a ton of the oysters, but it tastes like a rich, Irish Dry Stout. Nice roasted malt and a touch of char. Some faint dark chocolate and burnt wood on the finish with just a hint of salt water somewhere in the burnt wood. Has a really rich mouthfeel for the abv. Worth a try."

"Minerally notes are present, but chocolate and roast malt are definitely dominant. Not a bad brew, but nothing exceptional."

""
"I think this is a tough style to knock out of the park, for sure. A lot goes into the construction of an ale like this, and I really like the intention. The oysters (and, probably added oatmeal malt grain) supported the flavor and mouthfeel. Nothing really steals the show, which still makes this a very round and excellently sessionable stout beer. I'm happy with the few I still have in the fridge."

"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of garnet highlights when held to light and a huge tan head that persists. The aroma is quite earthy and roasty with hints of coffee and caramel. The flavor follows the aroma. Nice roasty chocolate and coffee with a caramel and brown sugary sweetness that is cut down by an earthy almost briny flavor. Hints of dark tart fruits round out the flavor nicely. Light earthy hop bitterness linger long into the finish of every sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet tart and chewy mouthfeel. Not a bad stout but like other oyster stouts I've tried I have to ask, Why?"

"Pours a rich dark brown opaque beer. Great thick creamy head. Smells faintly of roasted malts and a little booze. Tastes of roasted malts and has a good body and great carbonation. If you likes stouts and have never had it I would recommend but there are better ones out there."
""

"This is a very tasty stout."

"The beer poured a minimal head that reduced to a thin layer. It is a pitch black color with no clarity. Nice lacing on the glass as the beer was drank. I pick up roasted notes, bittersweet chocolate, smoke, and some bready notes in the taste and smell. The beer is smooth, gull bodied, silky, creamy, and low to medium carbonation. Oyster stoits are delicious and happy to have found this down here in PA since I never see it in six packs."

"A bottle from Gator Beverage. Pours black with small and quickly receding head. Aroma of roadty smokey chocolate coffee malt. Light flavor with hint of oyster finish. Was not expecting to get that flavor or--if I did--to like it. But it is awesome. Very interesting dry-ish finish. A bit effervescent for a stout but really fits with the flavor and closer to a porter mouthfeeland bite. Balanced flavor on the roast and oyster. Nice."
""
"Drank this straight out of the bottle, but poured a portion in a glass to see that it was black in color with moderate carbonation. Flying Dog forces carbonation in their brew so it will always taste fresh if bottled recently. Malty notes, slight coffee taste on the palate. Switching around from IPAs to this Stout makes it hard to suck down. Even though it's only a little over 5% abv it's not a session beer. Slightly above average for a stout."
"What a wonderful beer. I don't get any oyster flavor, which is good in my book. This is just a really solid very drinkable medium-light bodied stout. Love it. Will have to pick up more."
""
""
"I knew I would be OK when the aroma that came off was a predominate roastiness (no fishiness!). The flavor was predominately dark roast with moderately high bitterness. They did a nice job with this beer as the strong roastiness in not tannic or burnt. There a unique flavor to this beer that I just cannot describe that I am relating to the oysters."

"Cheers!"
"I'm not gonna make the obvious joke here, but I do know a girl who's told me she always thought she'd look good with a pearl necklace, and it's hard to keep from laughing. Call me immature. Anyway, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of glowing wan-khaki foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, watered-down coffee, dark earthy greens, and mineral water. The taste brings in more of the same, but with more minerality (the oysters at work) and a stiffer coffee component. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a nice stout, though one that could stand to have a bit more meat on its bones."
"O= This is a solid beer. I've never had an oyster stout but for only 5.5% this baby packs a lot of flavor in. Check this out. I've never had oysters but this is good."

"Worth a try if you enjoy something different in your stouts."

"Overall: A fairly decent stout. I'm not sure what the oysters really add here except a bit of saltiness. Still, it's a well put-together stout and something I wouldn't mind having again."
""
"O: Quite enjoyable. A very good stout that stands out in my mind. Where's the oyster though. Maybe it adds a certain Je ne sais quoi maybe?"
"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and a good example of an English Stout brewed with Oysters, I don't have much experience with English Stouts and I have never had a beer with oysters in it before, but it seemed to fit the style nicely and the oysters added a nice layer of complexity that didn't stick out too much. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it went down smooth and the flavors held my attention nicely, I could probably drink two of these before the charred flavor would be too much. What I like the most about this beer was the taste and appearance, it tasted pretty good with some nice roasted flavors and a slight briny flavor and the appearance was really good. What I liked the least about this beer was that aroma had a little too much char to it, I wouldn't mind the char being toned down a little with a little briny aromas. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good and drinkable English Stout and I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, don't let the oysters scare you this is a good stout. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I have to admit that I was little intimated by the fact that they threw some oysters in this brew but it turned out that they didn't impart any fishy aspects to this beer, it just made it richer and added a slight briny flavor to it which I liked and I thought it worked well with this beer. Good job Flying Dog at first glance this is one crazy sounding beer, but once you get down to it and drink it it's really not all that crazy, it's just a good English Stout, nice work guys, I'll be interested to see what other crazy ideas you guys got."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and thin, but well bodied for an english stout I guess. I'm still looking for a real oyster taste, and other than the slight gritty, rock taste midway through, there isn't much. Fizzes a bit when swished, but more foamy than harsh. Drinkability is good balance of flavor and thin body, so it's a winner there at least. Overall a disappointment."
""
"Great balance from start to finish, very subtle oyster shell flavor which works quite well. This beer lingers on the palate, wish I had a dozen Island Creek oysters right now ... on its own still a lot of fun."

""
"My first oyster stout - a solid effort."
"Thin dark tan head with little retention on a jet black body. Almost no aroma with only hints of chocolate and vanilla. Flavor is a little tart and sour for the style mostly from the roasted malts that have the sourness and bitterness of stale coffee without much coffee flavor. Some mild sweetness from chocolate and hints of vanilla. Medium body, not too thick with moderate to high carbonation. This one is just not very good. The drinkablitly is really hurt by the sourness."
"O: okay beer"
""
""
"Pours well into a pint glass with ample tan head that clings to the glass like oysters to their beds (lazy oysters!). Deep brown color like the mud of the Rappahannock. Doesn't smell much, but I didn't ask for a tasting in the bottom of the glass. We'll see what she smells like after a few gulps. Roast, toasty malts remind me of rich breads we used to make flavored with oyster liquor when I was young. Lots of chocolate and coffee - a true stout. Dark sugars, a touch of char, cloyingly dry-these are all my favorite things about stouts. What a tremendous offering from FD. The oyster flavor is only at the beginning with some brine lingering to the end, adding to the beautiful balance of this beer. Still doesn't smell like much, served too cold. Need to grab some bottles and take them home to do it right. Find a shop that ships, worth the cost. Enjoy!"

"This was my first oyster stout and it was quite good. The oysters were subtle but really added to a solid English stout. This would pair well with food or by itself."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, well carbonated, hazelnut-highlighted, dark brown coloring with a thin, bubbly ring of film on the surface. Pretty steady flow of small carbonation bubbling throughout the body. Aromas of dark roasted coffee remain light and restrained, with an overall toasty feel and a touch of brine hidden deep. Flavors are light and bitter, with a dark, sweet ribbon throughout the palate. Coffee flavors are present throughout, with a touch of the brine and molasses comprising the highlighting characteristics. Dark, bitter chocolate profiles are deep in the backbone as you continue to drink and allow your palate to open up. Light, dry body that is kept with both a touch of hops bitterness and the carbonation. Bittersweet aftertaste, both coffee and chocolate, leading into a dry, clean finish. Tasty, and very easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall- Not bad, but I would prefer more on the flavor. More sweet and hop balance to go with the toasty black coffee notes."
"One of the best Flying Dog beers I've had. Very easy to drink. Could use a bit more alcohol, but overall, a really good stout."
""
"O: Aside from the mouthfeel, this is a nice easy-going beer that has plenty of flavor and is easy to drink. Certainly enjoyable"
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and cookie dough. Taste is of dark roasted malt, burnt cocoa, and a slight fruity flavor. There is a medium roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors."
"O-For an oyster stout, where are the oysters? Maybe I can't pick out oysters but I can't get any of them."
""
"Velvety smooth and pleasing in the mouth. Flavorfully flowing over the taste receptors. More roasted malts with a slight sensation of the briny depths. Lite chocolate comes through again. Tasty stout with a slight edge on complexity compared to the run of the mill stout. Well worth a try."
"M&D - smooth, with a nice flavor, not simple but not particularly complex, I would've like to taste the oyster a bit more. But it was delicious nonetheless."
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is a great representation of the style, the oyster stout leaves little to be desired except for a higher abv to compliment the style."
""
""
"O: This is a beer that grows on you. At first it seems like your typical stout but the oysters become a little more noticeable as the beer warms up. It is definitely very easy to drink."
""
"Am easy drinking stout, not great, but a good representation of the style & I did at least see some of the oyster aspects of this one."
""
""
""
"Notes: So this is making it as part of their regular line-up? OK… It is not that exciting but I guess this could work well."
""
""
"This beer was definitely interesting. I'd consider buying it again. For a stout it's priced nicely and it offers a pretty good kick for the low ABV."
"O: There is a slight salinity that makes itself known as an undercurrent throughout. Quite a good beer, as I said before, very English in its flavour. Seriously blind, I would never think this beer was made in the US, it's that Old World. Incredibly English, even if the shellfish don't jump out and say Hello."
""
""
"Moderate carbonation and a medium body. I think that this isn't a bad beer, but it's different, and I would have to get more used to it and try more from the style to determine if this is a good one or not."
"Overall: Not so long ago, this was my gateway beer into porters and stouts. I remember being blown away that I liked it so much. I hated Oysters. I had been completely underwhelmed by stouts. This was a mix of the two, and I was scared. Turns out, it would be the first 5 I ever handed out on BA... But today, I know that score was off. I was elated I had broken down a barrier; it was only being compared to about 20 other beers, and my tongue was still turned off by anything that wasn't light and at least semi-sweet. That night will always be a great memory, and the bottle from that moment will always stand in my hall-of-fame, but I really doubt I'll ever drink this for any other reason than for memory's sake. Its a good beer, just not a great one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good for Flying Dog."
"O - I liked the look and fragrance of this beer. The taste didn't live up to other sensory perception. The burnt flavor was somewhat offputting."
"Very nice stout with a difficult to place extra through in to distinguish it from the crowd."
""
"Not bad. My second oyster stout and I'm starting to respect the style. Wish it had a little more body, but given the strength it's not unexpected. Overall, good balance and enjoyable finish. Might have this again."
"This was a nice take on the Oyster Stout style, with a no shortage of flavor from the oysters while still keeping the overall focus of the profiles on those more aggressive notes from the hops and roast. A nice lively body on this really makes those flavors pop as well. I’m glad they are going year round with this one. I think I’ll picking up a sixer of this once and a while."
"O:  This crazy beers is really like having liquid smoked oysters. At first I was unsure and a tad put off but after a few sips I enjoyed it more and more.  A great idea and a well executed stout that I will look for from now on. Get yourself a pearl necklace gents...and enjoy! Cheers!"
"Dark brown to black pour, an almost ruby color comes through when held up to light. Very little head and disappates quickly. Smells of coffee and chocolate. Taste has the same with a hint of vanilla and slight saltiness on the backend. Beer + Oysters = solid good."
"O: This beer is both not as oystery and much better than I thought. Surprisingly nice balance between acidity and malts, sweetness and bitterness."
""
""
"O-smells great, tastes just okay. It's definitely a very drinkable stout, one that I wouldn't even mind getting a 6-pack of. Not getting a taste of oysters here, not sure if I'm supposed to, I wasn't really expecting to."
"O - The flavors really came together for me, but everything else left me wanting more...I enjoyed my bottle, but I don't think I'd be in search of this one again"
""
""
""
""
"Poured out a very dark brown with a fluffy 1.5 finger head that sticks around for a minute. Smells and tastes just like any other stout to me, with dark roasted / char blend of malts. Perhaps the flavor has just a touch of sweetness to it that wasn't in the nose, but I didn't detect any of the 'brininess' that I had heard about in other reviews, and it left me disappointed. It certainly has a light and smooth texture, at least. But I'm not getting any 'oyster' excitement in this oyster stout...or any real excitement, at all."
""
"Soft dark fruits, dark chocolate, and a light char - all backed by an interesting, but not unpleasant briney saltwater quality. Earthy flavors and a bit of bitterness keep it multidimensional as the glass empties. Dark brown, but not quite black, thin tan head. Not the gimmick I was expecting."
""
""
""
"I love oysters OK. So add a nuance of briney sea water, and salt to an English Stout. Dominant are the roastt, toasty, bread crusty, coffee, and chocolate flavors. So sessionable too. Smooth roasty palate, with a little ocean graininess."
""
""
"O: This is one I can really see coming to its own on tap. A decent no-frills stout with great intentions, I'd pair this one with (what else?) oysters."
""
""
"O: A pretty good English stout, but nothing like I was expecting. I’m not a huge fan of oysters, but I found myself wanting more in that department – at the very least, just to get that unique flavor. Unfortunately, it wasn’t there, making this not a very unique beer, on the whole. Still, I enjoyed it; a positive throwback to tradition with just a splash of innovation."
"O- I would say this is an above average lower abv stout. Not sure what the oysters do, but they are not really noticeable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer does showcase the oyster shells more than most other oyster stouts but the stout itself is very soft in malt flavor and the nougat note is a bit off."
"Overall a nice drinkable stout. Good earthy flavors and a reasonable ABV. Worth a purchase for sure."
"This is a rather simple, one dimensional offering. It's not a bad flavor profile, but it doesn't hold my interest long. It's worth a try, but there's nothing special here."
"This was a tasty treat, and it's great to see an oyster stout available as an American craft beer. I'll have another."
""
"O - Not a style I often drink, but this one wasn't bad. Good coffee aroma and flavor with plenty of roasty notes. I was expecting something unique out of an oyster stout, but this one drank like any other. Pretty good."
""
""
"Taste-Roasty, coffee and dark chocolate, subtle brinyness and a bit of a dry finish. Very tasty, creamy and smooth. Sessionable. Worth seeking out."
"A very nice stout. Apparently, drinking these will help clean the Chesapeake by putting more oysters in it. A very nice cause! I need to buy more of this to support it!"
"The well developed blend of tastes is what should entice you. Our canine friends have brought together a nice blend of malts, roastiness, and hops. This is a well made stout that I would not hesitate to buy again."
""
"Leave it to Flying Dog to make an incredibly risque themed beer.... this will be my first oyster stout. Pour is deep dark brown with fizzy brown head with out much staying power. The nose features earthy notes along with heavy dry roast. Notes of chocolate and hints of smoke come through as well. A *touch* of oyster character is present at the beginning in the form of earthiness. Otherwise, this is a malt bomb. Taste is absent of anything that resembles oysters for me, however, it is incredibly chock full of roasted barley and chocolate and has a nice caramel malt backbone. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for style with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, this is quite a tasty stout and is actually quite refreshing (as I drink this on a 90 degree summer day). I really don't get much in the way of oysters. I'm really not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, because the product that is here in front of me is damn tasty."
"D - Nicely done, the malt character is robust, but not cloyingly so and there are smoky, earthy flavors that define this as a special kind of stout, and one that would go well with oysters."
"This is a very dark stout with a tan head that settles quickly. I smell prunes and a hint of malt. There's just a touch of sweetness like fruit but it finishes dry and a little bit salty. I really can taste the oysters in the finish and it pleases me. This beer feels a little thin for a stout but not bad. I will look for this again come football season."
""
""
""
"O- It's an ok beer. It's fairly mild, but I enjoy the finish of it. Passable, but not exciting."
"It seems a little lighter and thinner than ideal. Drinks pretty easily though. Really not bad for the style, just a little tick down from the better ones I've had."
"On tap at Old Town in Greensboro yesterday.Poured a deep color with some deep ruby hue to it,a thinner khaki colored head atop.Chocolate malts and dark roast in the nse mainly,I didn't get much briney flavors compared to many of the style wich didn't bother me much.Chocolate flavors with a little saline flavor to go along with hefty roast.Lighter but pretty creamy in the feel,probably something that would go well thru the nitro tap.Not bad it isn't over the top in it's oyster/brine flavors."
"Not the best stout, but worth trying."
""
"I like it!!"
""
""
""
"O: A pleasant oyster stout, Pearl Necklace gives a nice performance, even if not all the instruments are in tune. The mouthfeel is too light and the finish too bitter. Despite these off-key notes, the song still plays well."
""
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall this one is enjoyable. A solid enough brew, but after having a handfull of oyster stouts from several breweries I'm still not sure oysters really enhance anything for me."
""
""
"There is a sweetness to the taste again, in a form that is reminiscent of a mocha latte. The malts give a subtle chocolatey side to this beer, with some pleasant roasted coffee-like tones mixed in. In the back is a touch of hops and maybe even a little saltiness that give the beer a bit of prickle on the way out. This saltiness is subtle but definitely there, a touch from the oysters I'm sure. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat slick, and this is a very pleasant and drinkable stout. Nothing over the top or out of this world exciting, but this is a solid stout for sure. Definitely worth the pick up."
"Overall - Surprising light for a Flying Dog brew. Most of their beers are quite harsh, but this one is light and easy to drink."
"In the grand scheme of oyster stouts, of which I am big fan, this one sits in nicely in the middle. While nothing wows me in this beer, I will gladly reach for an other."

"Had this on tap at the brewery in the tasting room. It pours a lighted black (if thier is such a thing) not as dark as a lot of stouts I've had. The aroma is light hints of roasted coffee and very subtle hints of chocolate. I didn't get any real oyster flavor in the beer but is was a really nice smooth stout that was very drinkable. It's not over the top on ABV's like a lot of stouts out there which was really nice for a change. Got a six pack on my out so we'll see how it is from the bottle."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty and sweet lactose like. In the taste, sweet roast, dry lactose sugar, and a small saltiness. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry lactose sweetness in the aftertaste. A nice roast and flavor, but kind of standard for the style."

"Beer is thin and creamy, sweet, light on the palate, simple but there's nothing wrong with it. I enjoyed it."
"Pours a dark brown with a soapy khaki-colored head. Aromas of dark, ""roasty"" malt with just a touch of brine. Taste is of more dark roasted malt, a touch of chocolate, and bit more salty sea water. Mouthfeel is smooth and quite drinkable, with a medium mouthfeel and good carbonation. Overall a very easy-drinking Stout that could use a touch more oyster character, but nice overall."
""
""
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color, the head is thin and tan in color. There is no retention or lacing. The smell of the beer is lightly toasted, with some light roasted malt aromas in there too. The taste of the beer has a subtle bite to it, nice light chocolate tones with a creamy aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is on the lighter side but holds a decent carbonation. Overall the beer is drinkable and pretty good from start to finish."
"This is a medium bodied brew that leaves an almost silky oily feel coating the inside of the mouth with every sip. However, it almost lacks a bit in body and gets watery towards the end instead of carrying the expected viscosity of an oyster stout. There was seemingly no alcohol inclusion and overall this was a pretty good brew. Certainly worth a try."
"o - Overall a decent beer, though I thought the nose was a bit bland. A 12 oz. glass was a little too much for me as well, but a sample of this is worth checking out."
""
""
"Overall: I thought this was a very solid stout. Nice roast profile and easy to drink."
"O= went well with my various food items-- crab chowder, salad, crab cake sandwich. Darn, I hope I can get back to Maloo's before they run out of this!"
"Shrug. This is almost more like a dry brown ale, though there are some intriguing additional flavors as well. You can definitely tell the alcohol is fairly low in this beer, and frankly, given the abv., the beer delivers an impressive amount of flavor. Nevertheless, there just isn't enough going on in this beer to make me want to order it again."
"O - I found the Pearl Necklace to be a great and unique beer. It is well balanced and easily drinkable. The oysters provide some interesting earth and brine notes that accentuate the beer without overwhelming it. Well done, and I only wish that it'll be widely available in the coming months. Great beer for a great charity."
