2.93,-15.8,3.5,3,3,2,3,"Presented in a standard pint glass, this beer required a couple minutes to settle due to an extremely foamy head. After settling to a more manageable head it quickly dissipated with no lacing. Pitch black, even in the light. The nose is very subtle. Some barely malt comes through with a healthy dose of alcohol esters. Taste is malty to start, but very thin. The body leaves one wanting more. Dry finish with an almost soda-like feel. Despite the lack of body, this beer is rather drinkable. I could see myself drinking these in the backyard on a summer day simply because it's so light.","ryantaussig","Sep 26, 2010"

4.03,15.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no obvious lot code or expiration date. Sampled on October 6, 2009. The pour is dark brown with an explosve foamy, frothy tan head that seems to take forever to simmer down. The aroma comes off with a mix of roasted chocoalte malts and some mild hops in the background. The mouthfeel is sharp but medium with a lot of carbonation on the tongue. The taste has a roasted, chocolate malts and mild hops combo with a little bit of sugar to sweeten the punch. But with all the sweetness at the start there is a kind of sour finish. This is a well done, easy to drink stout.","puboflyons","Oct 06, 2009"

3.77,8.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"pours a dark brown bordering on black the tan head fades quickly but leaves a spring of effervesence making me think it might be alive. the aroma is slightly sweet not only due to the malt, which provides a nice chocolatey earthy aroma, but there's a bit of fruit ester as well. the taste is nice and earthy the malts come through well with a dry finish and plenty of carbonation.","almychristopher","Jun 24, 2008"
2.8,-19.5,3,3,3,2,2.5,"This poured pitch black with lots of bubbly tan head. It smelled like alcohol, raisins, and heavily roasted mocha. It tasted quite dry, like very dark and bitter chocolate with roasted coffee malt. It was fairly thin and very carbonated, with a mild coffee aftertaste. Overall this was not a good stout. There was no distinguishing character to it, and it was too thin. And like all of the Cooperstown beers, it had way too much head and carbonation. Their beers struggle to conceil the alcohol scent/flavor, and this stout was the only one without the lemon hops scent (thank goodness).","Pencible","Jun 24, 2008"

The taste was on par with the smell, starting off nutty and bitter with definite hints of coffee, cocoa, and toffee. Definite roasty malt character as well. The mouthfeel was not what I hoped for. Not much substance for a stout. A little too watery. Decent carb and nice aftertaste. Solid stout and definitely worth a try.","hyland24","May 12, 2008"

3.32,-4.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a nice black color with LOTS of brown and tan head, much like a rootbeer float, but there's too much head and it takes several pours and waits to empty the bottle, good retention, spotty lacing. Smells are very roasted and smokey, with hints of chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Taste matches the smell, there is some chocolate and coffee flavors, but it's overly roasty with a smoky finish. Light in body for a stout, very high in carbonation. Too much roasted malt and carbonation for my liking, not very balanced.","HopDerek","Jan 22, 2008"
3.56,2.3,4,3,3.5,4,4,"The beer poured a dark inky opaque black with a huge dark tan head. The beer smells of roasted malts with maybe just a subtle hint of coffee. The taste has a very large roasted malts characteristic to it starting off with a tiny bit of bittersweet chocolate, with almost a smoky finish. The mouthfeel is crisp with more carbonation than I expected. I would consider this to be extremely drinkable for a stout, and I could probably put back two or three without any problems. Not a bad little beer, I wouldn't be surprised if I ended up picking up some more in the future.","TheTrevor","Dec 16, 2007"
3.25,-6.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Poured coffee black into a nonic. Complete with a half inch of brown foam that quickly disappeared. The aroma was what you'd expect of a stout; roasted malts. The taste was bitter and smoked, almost ashen. Some malty sweetness shined through at the end. This was a thick brew. A decent stout. Nothing too different, nothing too special but definitely drinkable.","Jp7010","Dec 06, 2007"
3.5,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours an almost onyx black with a huge three finger thin tan head that slowly dies down to a frothy layer. Stickiness decent, nothing to go crazy over. Smell, well it has the typical Cooperstown ringwood yeast aroma up front with a roasted nutty like scent. Some caramel malt and chocolate in the nose as well. Taste begins with a smokey oak flavor on the tongue followed by fresh espresso. Lots of nutty flavors and toasted barley all the way through to the finish. Aftertaste is a smokey chocolate malt, not bad. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a solid carbonation. Not a bad beer at all. I was surprised the ringwood flavors weren't as present as the smell would lead you to believe. Solid stout offered by Cooperstown.","BeerTruth","Nov 03, 2007"

3.83,10.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured dark from the bottle with a light brown head, two fingers. Good spotty lacing. Smells of chocolate biscotti.

I found this very drinkable, not overly complex, but certainly has flavour ... a real delight with a certain lightness for the style.","ThatWineGuy","Sep 19, 2007"
3.63,4.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"While many American brewers load up the malts, jack up the alcohol, and have kicked the stout up a few notches, Cooperstown keep their Strike Out Stout to more traditional means.

3.26,-6.3,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Pours black with a tannish carmel colored head. Aromas of caramel and a roasty malt presence. Tastes of the same, small amount of caramel, roasty malt and a chocolate presence.

Has some very faint coffee and chocllate notes, but is mostly dominated by the roasted malt flavors. It tastes pretty good actually just doesnt go anywhere really-like an akward kid dancing in one spot afraid to move his legs. The finish is very watery even for a sweet stout and that really kills the feel of the beer style wise, but flavor wise its okish.","Jredner","Jun 29, 2006"
3.62,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: A drinkable beer, but there are others out there that are a bit more full bodied. Very low abv allows this to somewhat be a session beer if you've got a bunch of them. Would like to see it on tap if possible.","bjohnson","May 30, 2006"

The smell is also fairly standard, with a nice light and sharp malt backbone with chocolates and coffees over the top of that. It's much lighter, and far sharper than some stouts I've had, and I'd say the smell is a bit weak overall. The taste as well, pretty straight forward, malts, hops with a good deal of burnt chocolate and roast coffee beans in it. The mouthfeel is very light and almost fluffy in some way, because of the large amount of carbonation.

3.68,5.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Courtesy of Kahn's in Indy. This beer is nearly opaque and almost black with a medium thick dark brown head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is roasted coffee and some malt. Medium to rich body, with a sweet character here and there. Roasted coffee, malt and some hops in the flavor. The finish thins out a bit and is only mildly sweet, but this is still a fairly good Stout.","Dogbrick","Mar 22, 2004"
3.68,5.7,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Burnt malt, coco, vinuous alcoholic raisins in the aroma. Giant, active, dark hazelnut colored head left some decent lace. Dark opaque brown colored beer with the slightest ruby hue around the bottom edge of the glass. A light bodied beer with lots of carbonation keeps the flavor from touching the tongue. I swear this is an oatmeal stout, it's got that oat flavor and there's something about the aftertaste it leaves. The flavor is light, some bitter coffee, a pinch of coco, and a little dark wine. Reminds me a lot of the oatmeal stout I homebrewed, which I didn't think turned out all that well.","HappyHourHero","Mar 20, 2004"
2.85,-18.1,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Pours dark brown, almost black with a thick, very thick and frothy tan head. Very reminicent of a root beer. The aroma is dominated by caramel and a bit of a musty aroma. I also sence fruit. The taste isof caramel and in my opinion, not a very good example of a stout.","CBFanWish","Mar 18, 2004"
3.31,-4.9,4.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This 12oz. amber bottle offering from Cooperstown poured a spectacular inky blackness with a noisy, rocky and frothy tan-colored head that eventually settled down to a finger-thin level. Very nice patchy lacing of the glass. Aromas are hard to pick up. Soft aromas of brewed coffe and sweet chocolate. Flavor falls short for the style. It just tasted like all of the "oomph!" had been taken out of this beer. Firm toasty base with cooking fire smokiness layered on top. Dark chocolate is also noted, but again, it's not doing much to make its case. Finishes with a sweet dryness that borders on puckering. Mouthfeel is definitely on the thin side, with a low-medium carbonation. Drinkability is tolerable, but nothing to write home about.","OldFrothingSlosh","Mar 15, 2004"
4.13,18.7,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Poured with a very large, lingering, easy-to-revive tan head and deep, impenetrable dark body. Clean Three Muskateers-like chocolate aroma and Starbucks lattes. Pretty milky and far more soft than I'd have expected after I got into the flavors. Dominated by a roasted, coffee bean-like flavor. The roasted grains really drive the flavor of this beer. No tremendous hop presence here, but that works in the beer's favor. Smooth and delicate despite the foundation of the flavors lying in that potent roasted flavor. A bit milky. Definitely lively. Very, very good.","marburg","Feb 08, 2004"
1.9,-45.4,2,2,2,2,1.5,"The taste. A lot of fizz but very little bang. Weak on flavor , strong on bubbles. Mild coffee and dark malt. Perhaps I got a bad batch but this is just horrid.","yankeeheel","Jan 13, 2004"
3.4,-2.3,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Pours a deep black syrup with a very creamy mocha head. The aroma is heavily smoky with a distinct chocolate presence. The body is a bit sharp with smoke overtones and hints of black malt. The bitterness is moderate with a bit of hop spice in the finish. Like the porter, could us a bit more stoutness of body.","beernut7","Jan 01, 2004"
4.1,17.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a deep black with some ruby tinges, small tan head that quickly diminishes, leaving minimal lacing. Aroma is strong chocolate, roasted malts, and toffee. Flavor is smooth creamy dark chocolate, some roasted maltiness, and a hint of toffee in the back. Medium-full body. My pick for Cooperstown's best brew.","goz","Dec 07, 2003"
2.91,-16.4,4,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Not very complex, and I found it to be almost identical to their porter, but i liked that better. Kind of dull and unassuming, not Cooperstown's best effort. My bottle may have been a bit old. I didn't entirely trust the store that I got it from.","UnionMade","Sep 21, 2003"
3.76,8,4,3,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark black with a thick tan head that doesn't last. The aroma is musty with a dark malt appeal. The taste is good. There seems to be lots of chocolate malt used in this one along with patent malt. It's smooth going down and leaves you with that dark malt aftertaste. It is a low bodied beer for being as dark as it is. It's an average stout at best. It tastes mysteriously like a homebrew that I conjured up. Not at all what I would consider a good commercial replica.","WesWes","Jun 03, 2003"
3.68,5.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Roasty with a touch of coffee, and an ongoing chocolate flavor that is oh so nice. The body is medium full, but that is a tad thin for my liking. I would also ask for a bit more roastiness as there is a lot of sweet malts that need to take second in command to that deep dark character I love in a stout. Overall, this is a pretty good brew. I would sure love to check out a few more from this brewery, but it looks like someone stole my Benchwarmer.","ElGuapo","Mar 23, 2003"
4.03,15.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Ah the hedonistic pleasure of a pulchritudinous dark and brooding stout, lazing away in my chalice, the head stupendous in size, creamy in its consistency and the fine chocolate brown latticework of lace that longingly caresses the glass. The sweet hint of toasted grain, bittersweet chocolate and coffee, quite a pleasure for the schnozzle, sweet at the front, thick and rich at the top. Finish is perfectly hopped, modest in its carbonation with a dry lingering aftertaste and a good representative to the sweet stout style, and a good beer for the novitiates to the dark side.","Gusler","Dec 31, 2002"

3.6,3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Lightly roasted and chocolately with a good fruity base.  Medium bodied and spritzy on the tongue.  Finishes dry and easy.  Perfectly fine in all aspects but nothing that smacks you in the face, which, incidentally, makes it very enjoyable and drinkable.","pbrian","Oct 02, 2002"
3.93,12.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Opaque black color with a creamy tan head that holds quite well, but leaves no lace. The aroma is lightly roasty - coffee like - over a sweet chocolatey malt. The body is light-medium with a fine carbonation that's very smooth in the mouth. The flavor is of a gently fruity, sweet and roasty chocolatey malt. Well balanced with a bitterness that's quite subtle. It finishes dryish, with a short lingering roasty malt note. Not complex, nor rich, but well balanced and highly enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Sep 28, 2002"
3.98,14.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a pure black color with a thick brown head that never fully disappears.  Sweet chocolatey malt aroma dominates the brew with a touch of bitter coffee thrown in as well.  Sweet and rich chocolate flavors control the brew with a subtle roasted coffee flavor lingering in the background.  As the brew finishes the chocolate flavors fade away a bit and allow the coffee bitterness to come forward.  The brew is actually a bit thin for the style but is very drinkable and rather tasty.  Thanks to Pbrian for this one.","Murph","Sep 23, 2002"
4.18,20.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: A beautiful stout to say the least ... medium to heavy in body and very flavourful all the way through.","Jason","Apr 05, 2002"
4.08,17.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Fairly well carbonated, with a fizz on the tongue. Starts out with a dryish malty flavor, blossoming at the end into roasted malt and unsweetened chocolate flavors - a hint of black dark roast coffee?  Not much in the way of hops, save for a nice underlying bitterness.  Worth trying for the way the flavors explode at the end alone. A very enjoyable, well made stout - good in the bottle, and exceptional on tap.","sponberg","Mar 30, 2002"
3.7,6.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Good stout, black, thick and chewy, brewed with six malts.  Smooth, easy to drink.  The abv is 4.6%.","jdhilt","Feb 21, 2002"
