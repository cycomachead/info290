"O: Even as it is, this wasn't a bad beer. I assume the acetic character was an off-flavor, but it wasn't enough to render it undrinkable at all. I just don't think is what was intended, and certainly isn't to style. Still finished it without a problem."

"Opening medium light in body with a prominent roasty note, a grainy acidity that has flavors of coffee and cocoa, burnt caramel and a mildly briny and moderate chalky calcium flavor. The blend of chalk and brine is excellent here. Drying on the finish with a creamy dark chocolate character to go with the lingering acidity, this beer is delicious."

"No date on this, but the Upright website shows this as one of their current beers. Eleven dollar drainpour for me. From the 750 ml bottle bought yesterday at Olive Tree Market in Ocean Beach."

"Overall a surprising, enjoyable twist on a stout. I didn't know quite what to expect here and I'm still not sure how the oysters factor in. I didn't distinctly taste oyster in this beer (or at least how I expected I might), but there is a certain briny, minerally quality that suggests their influence. Well done, Upright."
"Overall: Oysters give this stout a lighter feel but it's a solid ale nonetheless."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest to higher level of carbonation. It starts off really fishy and transitions to more of a classic mineral feel. Plenty of roast and seemingly no alcohol inclusion. I thought this brew was mighty interesting. Sometimes I think oyster stouts are just a novelty and hardly include enough to impart that thicker/slick feel to the body. This brew nearly takes the oyster inclusion over the edge. I liked it and wouldnt mind having it again sometime."

"Poured into a pint glass, this was one of few beers that night I had seconds of. Black with brownish hints, the beer pours placidly with a thin layer of tan foam on top, which itself has a creamy surface texture. As it settles there's a little bit of spindly lacing around the edges. Roasty aroma that was dry with a hint of sweetness, and a savory brininess that is definitely oyster. Flavor is also roasty with dry bakers chocolate, hints of woody smoke and a savory hint of salinity. The body is creamy and silky smooth, light to medium in feel. One of the rare occasions where the oyster presence is actually noticeable... very well integrated and flavorful. Really enjoyed this, thanks again Eric!"

"I don't care if nobody but me knows this yet but this is one of the new classic ales of the Pacific Northwest. The flavor of the oysters is subtle and may very well escape some people. As a chef for 30+ years, I'm attuned to the relative limitations of using oysters as a flavoring (as in stuffings, soups, and sauces) and I smelled and tasted them immediately. The idea is a natural, as Stout is certainly the proper pairing with raw oysters but the expression here, with the creamy ale and the salty, briny ocean tang, is sublime. In the glass, there's only a thready lace at the rim and it's not more than mildly effervescent but the mouthfeel is satiny and refined, a lovey counterpoint to the earthy oysters. Without the oysters, this would still be a fine Brit-styled Stout but with them, it's utterly engrossing and delicious. I tasted it on tap at the brewery and managed to snag the last bottle left at Upright. Notes on that after I open it...in about five years."
"Review from 4/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark brown, appearing black. One finger brown head and lacing. Aroma of chocolate, dark and roasty malt. Flavor is somewhat unusual although it has the coffee, roasted malt one would expect. A mild finish. A little underwhelming, but somewhat richer than most English stouts. A somewhat understated, but pleasant English stout."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some slight coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of roasty bitterness with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I get absolutely no hints of any sort of oyster products being used in the brewing process."

"Got this in a trade when I visited beautiful Portland, Oregon. The sample I got fizzed from hell to breakfast, so it was several minutes before I dared open the cap fully without getting beer all over me and my room. It pours an opaque oily sable with a very thick, though not too persistent, fluffy tan head that leaves a little lacing. Smoky aroma has an overtone of oyster and hints of coffee and molasses. Flavor definitely has an oyster tone - and I love oysters! Smoky, coffee, nutty, molasses and licorice tones are present as well. Texture is thick, smooth, oily and fizzy. This is worth seeking!"
"Overall. Can't get any oyster out of this but there are some unique qualities in the smell and taste that didn't work for me."
"My first oyster stout, and it was a very interesting experience. Not something I would want all the time, but still quite enjoyable."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Complex stout that drinks bigger than its ABV. The oyster part is not that noticeable though there is a slight iodine tang to the finish. Some chocolate notes but the beer is more on the austere side with a dyish finish. I really like the complexity combined with great drinability. The coffee stout from Upright tastes like this beer with a strong coffee flavour. After being known for Saison and Farmhouse beers I now see these guys as top notch stout brewers"
"The drinkability for this is amazingly good. It is very smooth the flavors blend very well with each other. I could drink this all day."
"D: This is umami in a glass folks. It might be my fore runner for ""beer of the year"" at this point. My first parlay into the world of truffle infused beer and its been a good one. As unique and dare I say odd as this beer is, I can't help but find myself drawn to its originality and funkiness. Well done Ganum... You continue to impress. Keep up your work as the most innovative brewer in Portland and I will continue to seek out and buy your product. 5/5"
"Tasty beer but the Oysters are muted. Probably better when extremely fresh, but the beer drinks nice enough."
"Drinkability is good, this is a tasty export stout, very full favored, but more of a sipper then a session ale."
"overall a very nicely built stout, nice flavors."
"D: LOVE the intense smokiness, the surliness. I didn't think I'd like this as much as I did at first sip. Had it on several occasions as a draft pour at the time of its release; now, some 3 months later, is my first try from the bottle. Quite tasty and, as mentioned earlier, paired wonderfully with the cheese [distant thanks to Steve Jones of Cheese Bar, pairings courtesy of MIX magazine]. Recommended!"
"Very smooth in the mouth, especially as it warms. Big, bottle but at around 6.25% easy to drink."
"The body was very nice, full and rich, a pleasure on the tongue. Drinkability was good, smooth, easy and comfortable. Overall, a very decent stout, worth a try if you see it. Despite the quality of this beer, I thought it was a bit overpriced ($11 at my local food coop), $8-9 would be a more fair price."
"D= Very drinkable and enjoyable. Though the oyster quality is elusive, I believe it adds something worthwhile to the beer. I would certainly drink this again if given the chance."
"D: This is a pretty good beer, never had an oyster stout until now...not much oyster flavor in this one. Would buy this beer again for sure."
"Aside from the brine-like suggestion of something unbeerish, this ale mostly tastes like normal export-style stout with a slight mintiness. It falls precisely midway between exceptional and disastrous."
"Poured a black with silverish, brown notes as it pours into a nice brown head. Pour did seem a little thin. Nose is oysters, chcolate, roasted. Taste is chcolate, roasted malt, oysters, but very tame on the oyster taste. Mouthfeel seemed a bit thin, booze. light oyster feel and taste. A good stout, unique."
"Other comments: This is a fantastic stout, oysters or not. And if you're not a fan of oysters, don't worry. You'd never know."
