"A nice strong and very dark (virtually black) English ale"
""
""
"O) A nicely done ale; not even close to being a stout, and it doesn't claim to be one on the bottle, so the BA type is wrong.  This is a beer to drink slowly and appreciate."
"Overall: Is it a stout? Is it a porter? This is a beer with an identity crisis in more ways than one. It's not that it tastes bad; I like my beers malty and this one isn't too bad albeit a little one-dimensional. I think it's trying to be two things at once and doesn't really hit the spot on either count. Compared to something like Sam Smiths Oatmeal Stout, Bad King John is looking pretty woeful. Not a drain pour because I enjoyed the taste, but I can't see me seeking this out again."

"O: Hmm, could I have bought an infected bottle? Not sure I want to pay Â£2 for another bottle to find out. If this is Bad King John in its normal state then it's one of the worst stouts I've had."

"Very very decent brew. A bitter-focused English stout, with still a bit of smoothness. Worth a try."

"Presentation: packaged in a custom 19.9 ounce (500 ml) brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium brewing chalice."

"An OK brew - more of a strong dark ale than a stout (not roasty enough in my opinion). The smell is nice, with balanced complexity. The taste is less pleasing - a touch too much roasted malt and burnt grain crowd out the other flavours, resulting in an excessively dry bitterness. Body could be a tad more meaty. Drinkable but nothing too special. Worth trying, but no need to seek it out."

"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Caracole small snifter. Pours a dark brown amber, light tan head and light lacing. Mild roasted and sweet malt aroma. Light flavor of dark caramel malt, slight hops. Flavors nice but very subdued. Like most of the beer from this brewery, the flavors are OK, but too bland and low key. Light to medium bodied. This tastes more like a dark ale than a stout."

"Not rich in body but flavoursome and interesting: a fine brew."
"A dark clear brown with a small short lived brown head on the pour. Aroma and Taste of roasted caramel malt, some coffee and dark fruit, with some liquorice notes and light bitterness. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is a sweet roasted caramel malt, cacao, espresso with some light liquorice flavor and some bitterness on the end for balance. Both the aroma and flavor become more pronounced as it warms up. Overall a good tasty brew."

"O: Not necessarily a bad beer, but not particularly memorable either."

"I'd been ready to write off Ridgeway based on rep and some very average beers, this earns them a stay of execution."

" surprisingly sup'able probably due to the great carbonation making it an easy drinking experience."

"O-A lot of potential but not quite there maybe a stout light"
"Pours a brownish red with minimal head turning to film and decent lacing. Smells of rich sweet roasted malt some dark fruits and maybe some plum. Tastes like a sweet or a milk stout not enough hop presence or any complexity really. Not bad but nothing special. Feel is a bit too carbonated at first, again nothing special here. Not a bad beer but nothing I would buy again."
"Overall quite a good stout, better than guinness anyway."
"would i have another one? absolutely, if you're buying."
"T: sweet malts, well balanced, toast, bitterness at the end, long final, medium body, moderate carbonation, residual sweetness"
"Overall, I found the flavors in this brew good, but was disappointed in not only what I thought was a missed opportunity at larger flavors, but also thicker mouthfeel. Still, this might be a good introduction to black ales for newcomers, as it does provide all of the requisite flavors, albeit in a lighter format."
"This beer was a thin looking deep brown color with just a bit of fan head across the top. The lacing was nonexistent. The smell of the beer had some nice roasted malt aromas but they weren't overly strong. The taste was pleasantly light and had some flavors in it that I was having trouble pinpointing. The mouthfeel was thin but I didn't mind for some reason. Overall I thought it was a pretty good stout but still just about average in my opinion."
"It's a decent stout, arguably a porter. It was black, showing rusty red with a half sip left. I'd give it another shot at some point, but I'd consider it a semi-bland table beer."
"On tap at Tap and Table. Appeared just barely black with red highlights. This stout was drinkable and true to style, but uninspiring. The character is flat and lacks depth. There's just a roasted barley taste with a touch of dark chocolate. Yes, it nice. Yes, I'm a little tough on this beer. But there's a lot of potential for this style."
"D: Roasty yet incredibly smooth for flavor making for a solid good drinkability factor. The alcohol is very well hidden making you feel like you are drinking a session style pub at 5% rather then a tick above at 6%. Yeah I could easily enjoy a few of these in a nice typical English pub setting."
"It's not bad. Easy drinking. Would drink again"
"Opinion: This is an OK beer and probably one of the best that I have had from this brewery yet. I don't know what that is saying, but there you have it. The beer itself is a bit harsh on the finish, but it has a decent amount of flavor. Would I drink it again?...probably. Would I seek it out? No, the Bastard is much better."
"D: In no way do I find this one sessionable but who says that's a bad thing... A very nice brew to end my day with."
"Not bad, not great. I wouldn't mind having this periodically, but I'm not disappointed that this isn't readily available where I live."
"This beer is worth bringing home, but be wary of the marketeers."
"Medium/full body with a dry, lightly burnt malt bitterness on the finish."
"D: I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting."
"a unigue experience that separates the english stout from the export. mild but no diluted. good retention. supriseingly fruit but backbone of malt molasses. the palate is clean and not creamy... but broad. vanilla, cocoa, molasses, and a lot of blackberry. fantastic. mild but not basic."
"overall - not really that great of a beer. wouldn't recommend this one."
"Yeah, let's live pessimistically in the past, Ridgeway...let's keep dredging up John and dragging his name in the mud. Real mature. This brew pours a very dark brown topped by a sad excuse for a bubbly head (it's not its fault, though...the cask affects performance). The nose comprises figs, black grapes, light maple syrup, and some light strawberries. The taste holds notes of chocolate powder, light maple syrup, figs, dates, red grapes, and a hint of oak. Wow, didn't see all o' that comin'. The body is a solid medium, with no real carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a better time is had with this beer than was had under the watchful eye of the eponymous ruler. Word."
"Despite all the faults it's a fairly decent and quite drinkable session stout if you're not looking to wreck your palate with a roasted malt bomb or get hammered with a 10% RIS."
"Drinkability - no problems finishing this one... could have cracked a few a more."
" Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and not as creamy as I would have liked it to be. Overall, though, it is rather smooth. This beer is drinkable by all means. I wouldn't really call it a stout, however. More of an English Strong Dark Ale."
"I have to say the label has caught my eye in the past but I never pulled the trigger until today,BBC magazine called him the worst Briton of the 13th century,now thats sayin something.Poured more of a cola color than black,alot of reddish tint,a thinner but well retained slight off white head atop.Fruity malt,iron,and light bitter chocolate in the nose,its full on English malt.A little thin in the mouth,but it goes down real easy.Flavors are not intense,at least not for the American craft palate,but its got decent complexity.Some bitter chocolate and fruity flavors meld into a pretty good earthy finish,intense finish maybe for the Brits.I actually think its decent,not intense,not great."
"If you like English dry stout, this is worth checking out. Can be a little pricey for a bottle, though."
"Pours black with a khaki head. The aroma is pretty subtle with roasted malts and a little smoke. The flavor is more of the same with roasted malt being the most predominant flavor component. The hops may add a tad bit of bitterness but if they do, it is not much. Not very complex but it is enjoyable. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation."
"I would have considered this something else other than a stout, maybe a dark mild but it is not real mild or just and English strong ale. Still a very good English ale."
"I feel that this beer tastes and looks more like a porter than a stout. Even though it is a good beer, it is a bit flat. I was a bit disappointed actually, at least when considering the high price it cost at my local pub."
"From Premiere Gourmet. Good example of English sublety, nothing too bold just the balance of a little roast, a little Shwartzbier black, a bit above mouthfeel, a bit of licorice as in a porter. Pours black, nothing harsh, delightful with a meal. Really a shwartbier."
"This does not do it for me. Just kind of bland. Nothing bad, but there are much better stouts out there."
"Deep brown in color bordering on black. Minor tan colored head on top. Low aroma-some minor nutty notes as well as a tinge of cocoa. Killer malty and mildly roasted flavor. Slight graininess that brings out the roasted quality even more. Slight chocolate and espresso flavors. Mild hop presence. Very well balanced flavor wise. Good mouthfeel. Nice lingering dry taste. Very very drinkable. I love the whole package."
"A very nice purchase from a great little shop in Cambridge, Liquor World. I always can go for a nice dark ale & chose such to follow up some other fruity-session ales, which posed some potential risk of shocking the system. However, such was not the case! A nice, smooth chocolate-brown pour to black, blocking out any light, with a full 2-finger reddish tan head and nice lace retention. The aroma was mild, some chocolate & malt-cookie. The flavor was a bit more smoky, with roasted malt & bitter hop edges. Dark chocolate presence without being overwhelming. Medium body & very drinkable as a porter-ale. Definitely a repeat purchase!"
"From a 500 ml bottle, this beer pours as a nearly solid black color (with brown highlights in the shallows if held to the light). It presents a tightly packed brownish-tan head, and makes for an impressive beer. The brew has a nice roasted malt aroma...chocolate, biscuit, and grain in front of a backdrop of English hops. The malt is front and center in this beer. There's also a notable yeast flavor and aroma in the brew. Occasional fruity qualities appear and fade, particularly raisin and plum-like. Fairly clean, moderately light in body, with a bitterness that comes in in the mid-taste. Fairly sweet as well, more than expected. This is a satisfying and very enjoyable brew."
"A beer fit for a bad king, that's for sure. I'd have more if it weren't so damned expensive."
"The aroma is like burnt malt with cream and coffee. The appearance is black with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is too thin for a stout. I am not very fond of this one. I can't really say that there is any one fault with this one. Overall it's just not that good."
"On tap at Deep Ellum this past weekend. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark brown color to the body. Decent sized head. Not a lot of aroma noticed. Roasted barley flavor was there, but not a lot else. Pretty smooth beer so I found quite easy to drink. But honestly, this beer did nothing for me and seemed run of the mill. Didn't stand out in any which way."
"Ridgeway Bad King John isn't bad (in a good way) and it isn't bad (in a bad way). It's a slightly better than average black beer that is more bitter than most. That's probably the only reason why this hophead is giving it above average scores. No how, no way is it worth $6.09."
"Drinkability- Very nice english stout. Do away with that metallic beginning and lower the carbonation a touch lower and you have almost world class. Very drinkable as is though."
"overall, this beer is quite delicious. Described as a ""black ale"" on the bottle, it is as fine an example of a british stout as I've tasted. worth a try."
"The taste is quite interesting, flavourful, and complex. Up front it starts smoothly with sweet fruit, especially prunes, toasted brown bread, a hint of fruitcake. This gradually transforms into a drier, toastier character with gradually increasing bitterness including pepper and spice (licorice, perhaps), and light hints of bitter chocolate and unsweetened coffee. The change is smooth and gradual, to a lightly bitter, dry finish containing the pepper, etc. The bitterness lingers, slowly getting a little stronger to fill the mouth before fading. Hwoever, nothing is sharp or burn tasting, the bitterness is not clinging or unpleasant (it stops just short of getting unpleasant), and it has a nice spicey-coffee character. The whole experience is enjoyable, engaging, interesting, very flavourful from start to finish, and the beer is quite drinkable."
