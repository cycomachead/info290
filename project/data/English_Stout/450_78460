4.55,19.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Bought from the brewery right before Xmas, opened on St. Patty's Day 2015. Needed my stout fix do what the heck. Already had my corned beef and cabbage. Pours dark with nice soapy, large off white head. Smells of chocolate, some coffee espresso, and a touch of vanilla. A bit of burnt roast malt character. Tastes like a chocolate milkshake. Nice & lushy, foamy full mouthfeel. A tad sweet but okay given the chocolate character. No hops in nose or aroma, and that's fine. I don't want any hops in this kind of beer. Just enough bitterness though so it's not cloying. Overall, a fantastic beer that was fresh from the brewery and kept cold in the fridge since then. A very well made beer.","jwhancher","Mar 13, 2015"

4.15,8.6,,,,,,"The chocolate really ends a nice element to this beer.  Also, I aged this for just over a year, and I think that smoothed thing out a bit.  Certainly wouldn't call this a blockbuster, but the chocolate works well with the vanilla and light espresso.   Mouthfeel is soft, smooth and long, and drinkability is terrific. The beer is just a bit thin on the palate, but I thought that was OK, for style and for a non BA stout.  Really a very enjoyable, easy drinking stout.","John_M","Nov 30, 2014"

There was something there, but it was too faint for me to smell. The taste was good. Strong chocolate. Maybe too strong for some palates, but great for mine. Some cherry notes, a little roasted malt. No alcohol warmth, which for a 6.9% beer is good. I would have preferred a little more malt and roastiness to go with the strong chocolate taste, but since I like chocolate I happily drank the beer.

Poured opaque black with a thick creamy light tan head exhibiting excellent lacing and retention. Aroma was roasty with dark malts and coffee, with notes of cocoa. More of those characteristics in the taste; the regular version of this beer already has a nice chocolate profile, and the added aging augmented that a bit, but it wasn't overdone. The base is an oyster stout, so some hints of brine can be picked up, but the other flavors at work kind of push that into the background. Smooth and creamy, medium bodied, and quite a nice drink overall.","Rifugium","0"
