The taste was great, hints of dark chocolate and almost fruity notes on the end. The mouthfeel was nice as well. Overall I would recommend for stout lovers as a nice beer to have in between the harder to find and more expensive stouts.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 16, 2014"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, char, and slight cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with char, cocoa, and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a slightly better set of flavors in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","May 04, 2014"

I don't normally trust Magic Hat to put out a high quality brew, but I was hoping this one might be different based on reviews and scores I've read. However, there wasn't enough boldness or richness of flavors I expect in a high quality stout. That coupled with too many off aromas and flavors force me to give this brew regrettably low marks.","ElijahRivera","Apr 10, 2014"

The aroma is that of dark chocolate, vanilla beans, and light coffee notes. The flavor is mild but enjoyable with all the flavors promised in the nose plus some dried prune and raisin notes. It has a lighter body than I have come to expect from a stout. This is a very enjoyable beer that drinks quite light and easy. It is in no way a great stout but it is solid.","lochef81","Mar 17, 2014"

This beer is very roasted-smelling and it seemed to perfectly match the snowy, woodsy outdoors at the ski resort. The taste is lightly bitter up front, then the toasted malts take over bringing some sweetness in. It's big enough for what we wanted without being too heavy. Probably the perfect beer for that moment, and just a really good easy-drinking stout. This one is a winner I highly recommend.","ski271","Feb 24, 2014"

Would love to drink this and hobgoblin at same time and compare. Not weak either surprisingly buzz worthy but better to drink before any other beer as this taste Truly needs to be appreciated to its fullest. Great contrast to Magic hats other orange lemony zest beers/IPAs which I find typical amongst others. Definitely a stand out brew.","Bretts1357","Jan 31, 2014"

Definitely fits into the English stout category and a damn good one. Nice black pour and you can see it's a bit thinner almost leaning to the porter side. Smells of roasted coffee but not overpowering and a slight burnt chocolate. Taste similar with a nice balance of smooth coffee, not too bitter, nice finish","alaimoa","Dec 13, 2013"

If let sit until slightly above room temp, Heart of Darkness takes on a different character--it becomes a little more rich and the hidden flavors become more evident.

Little to no head with excellent lacing and retention. No sign of carbonation-- I'm sure it's there but good luck seeing it. Thick chocolate and cocoa aromas. A hint of coffee. Clean wet mouthfeel. Coffee nose. Lots of Kona, Arabica, and a hint of Ethiopian beans. Chocolate milk and coffee mid-palate. Luxurious. Bitter back palate. Stout bitter hops and porter malts. Toasted barley and oaked wood aftertaste. Strong tannins and leather persist. Dry finish. So much stout. So much good bitters. So full and well rounded. Incredibly drinkable. Smooth. 4.5 out of 5.

Aromas of milk chocolate, roasted malt, toast, toffee, caramel, light coffee, and light floral earthiness. Excellent aromas with great balance, strength, and complexity of roasted malt notes with light hops. Taste of milk chocolate, roasted malt, toast, toffee, caramel, coffee, and floral earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, roasted malt, toast, toffee, coffee, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors; with a good amount of robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent stout! Great balance of roasted flavors with good robustness; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2013"

4.06,4.6,5,4,4,4,4,"Magic Hat Heart of Darkness is a solid, black ale with a generous, soft, light brown head that has outstanding lacing and retention. The aroma is kind of tangy with a fair amount of dark roast. There's a note of caramel and some sort of spice. It's smooth and medium bodied with a dry finish that's pretty clean. It tastes pretty dry and roasty with just enough bitterness to balance it out. It is pretty tangy, but not fruity. There are notes of caramel and vanilla. A light, resiny bitterness lingers for a bit after the swallow. This is a really solid offering from Magic Hat. I can down a 6-pack of this with no hesitation.","yesyouam","May 05, 2013"

It's also more sweet than bitter tasting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy, smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a solid brew.

The initial pour produces a huge, khaki colored fluff, and the bubbles themselves are dense like sea foam. This later goes down, but not completely - there's always a little cover over the dark beer. Bonus points for that! The aroma is a breeze of pure bliss through my nostrils! It's main characteristics are vanilla cream, milk chocolate, and sweetened coffee. However good, it is fairly straight forward. The taste is very similar to the aroma, with a good balance between the bitter and the sweet aspects. That slight fruit flavor so telling of a Magic Hat brew is here, of course too. It feels light in the mouth and the finish has a roasted flavor and a dry effect to it. Overall, it's a nice stout that goes down easy when you're not in the mood for a 'big' beer.","Neorebel","Feb 19, 2013"

Pours the color and clarity of cola with a quarter inch, fizzy, tan-colored head. Nose reveals roast, lactose sweetness and a metallic aroma towards the back. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also an acidity that cuts through the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation that falls just short of lively. Acidity is light, but lingers along the taste buds at the back of the tongue between quaffs. Overall, this beer has held up pretty well considering the last time I had it was in the mid 90's. That said, it's definitely not as robust as I recall, but a respectable beer nonetheless.","Jwale73","Feb 04, 2013"

Black/brown, shows clear deep red in the light on the edges. small tan head that dissipates quickly with a little lacing. Smell said "toasted" more than "roasted" to me for some reason, but the taste disagrees. Coffee and roasted malt all the way, with a rough but creamy mouthfeel. Excellent stout, bittersweet chocolate upfront is balanced by the bitter finish. Loved it!","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jan 10, 2013"
4.34,11.9,4.5,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"O: A fruity and soft stout with light bit of sweetness but a bit more bitterness. The dark fruit from the malt blends well with the citrus and grapefruit from the hops making for a sort of juicy stout. I'd call this a Foreign Extra Stout for BJCP style.

3.98,2.6,4.25,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good and different example of the style, it had some decent roasted and oat flavors to it with some great complexity and a fitting mouthfeel that made it fairly memorable. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I could see drinking a couple of these but after that the thickness might become too much, it's a good late fall beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel they were both pretty well done and very pretty true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was nice, but it was just a little thin and it lacked the tons of rich and roasted malts that I normally find in the style. I would buy this beer again, in fact I already went back to the store and bought another six pack, it's reasonably priced and a decent tasting Oatmeal Stout, I recommend it to anyone who likes the style. All in all I was happy with this beer, even though I was told it was good, I always have my doubts with Magic Hat, but this one turned out to be a nice surprise and it showed me that Magic Hat can actually make a decent beer. Good job guys, if you start making more beers of this quality I may actually end up becoming a fan one day, Cheers!","StoutHunter","Jan 08, 2013"

The taste has a well integrated roast and oatmeal thing going on at first, with some herbal hops in the background. More coffee tones come through on the finish, with a bit of chocolate backing up everything. The mouthfeel could be a little smoother, but is spot-on with the thickness.

The nose is very nice, based around a roasty coffee aroma. There's also a noticeable smell of star anise that joins the picture. The flavor profile starts out similarly well, with the taste of coffee that's had a bit of cream added to it. The anise is a bit more muted here, drowned out somewhat by a slightly jarring hop presence. The bitterness clashes with the roasty malt character, and the earthy, herbal finish is a little bit overbearing. The mouthfeel is just a little bit short of great. The body is a hair too dry, and the carbonation is noticeably zippy. Both are just off though. I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by Heart of Darkness, Given my lack of fondness for many of the other Magic Hat brews I've had. This one is pretty solid.","axeman9182","Dec 23, 2012"

It does have that nice coffee roasted stout flavor but I was expecting a better aftertaste. The aftertaste was a little bland but I do like the first initial flavor of coffee notes. This stout is a good fast sipper though because most stouts are high in alcohol and this one isn't. Overall this is a good stout but not one I would buy on a regular basis.

This beer is a bit of a departure for them, and I'm glad. It took guts for a brewery that normally sticks with very safe, crowd-pleasing beers to release an oatmeal stout as their main winter seasonal. They didn't hold back either; it's very flavorful and robust, so much so that it isn't hard to imagine the casual beer drinker being a bit overwhelmed by it. It seems to be selling very well though, and even the twelve packs are moving. A laudable effort from Magic Hat. I hope this will be around for years to come.","ryan1788a5","Nov 28, 2012"

The coloring was deep, while the head showed great retention, with many bubbles remaining until the very last drop. The nose was full of notes, but we found them to be a bit subdued collectively. The taste followed in very much the same vein, with the flavoring being inclusive, but not as entirely robust as hoped for. The feel, however, was silky and smooth to fit the style, but not enough to make you forget in full the duller aroma and flavoring.","TheBrewo","Nov 10, 2012"

The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted oats, and a touch of coffee. There we go, back on track. The taste brings in more of the same, though everything is now overly roasted and/or toasted. Dammit. At least it's not all bad this time. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very dry finish. Overall, a schizoid little stout, one that's too thin and too roasty for its own good.","TMoney2591","Oct 24, 2012"

Thin, one finger head of tan foam. Aromas of coffee, milk chocolate and hints of vanilla. Flavors were similar, chocolate, roasted malt, sweetened coffee and grainy oats in the finish.

Taste is creamy smooth chocolate, some coffee, some fruits, a little bit of oxidation, but not horrible, and a strong roasted grain that lingers at the end. Body is medium and mouthfeel is creamy. I was surprised at how well this one held up given that its at least 2 years old and low on the alcohol side. I would have loved to tried this fresh!

Pours a nearly pitch black color, slightly brown towards the top, with a nice white lace for a head. Aromas that surfaced were nice cocoa, milk, coffee, toffee...very truffle oriented. Taste was about as nice as it comes with a stout, caramel, milk chocolate, espresso, burnt coffee bean, cherries, tobacco...it never seemed to end on new tastes to come up with. Mouthfeel was somewhat light bodied for an oatmeal stout...but that was not a bad thing...made it more drinkable in the end. I never thought that this beer would age well, but after all of this time sitting above my fridge, I have found that it has grown to be a beer to be revered in every respect of the word. I have to admit, as I was pouring it into the H.O.D tulip glass, I felt like I was saying goodbye to an old dear friend. I have a feeling that one of these days I'll stumble upon this beer in a dusty corner somewhere, but if not, It was great getting to know it.

Following a slight coffee / chocolate tone makes itself present with just a tiny hint of sweetness and a slight charcoal almost smoke like flavor (which doesn't work well for me). The oats make their way back into the picture after this, with also a slight toffeesque like flavor finding its way into the picture.

Can taste the smoke like roasted flavors with a hint of butterscotch? Also seems to have a smoky fruit taste that goes along with it very well. Has nice carbonation and over all a very nice beer.

One of the strongest flavored stouts Ive ever had, kickass good. This would go great with a heavy, full bodied meal. Man I love this stuff.

The flavors a reminscient of a dry Irish but with so much more character and flavor the deep dry roasts are present, but in addition a cocoa infused cappucino with a sour acidic tone finishes out the robust flavor of this stout similar to an Imperial but lacking body and alcohol to label it so.

I have to say (and the rest of the draught reviews seem to agree) that the draught version is similar in all respects except the flavor and aroma. The flavor is milder and smoother, and the hop flavor takes over. The hints of chocolate and coffee seem to be lost in both flavor and aroma. The head also seemed to run away too quickly. Still a very drinkable and enjoyable stout, but the bottled version really stands out in the crowd, where the draught version is just another oatmeal stout.","far333","Apr 24, 2003"

The taste is a nice complexity of the roasted malt flavors giving an almost smokey character to the brew, yet there is just a touch of hops for balance. The mouthfeel is pleasant and each taste finishes with a nice roasted flavor. I would almost call this a medium body stout; it really isn't heavy at all.

A fine and tasty stout, with a slightly sweet aftertaste, and just a touch syrupy. An excellent, but ordinary, stout, and I give up props to UncleJimbo and purplehops, my twin EastCoast providers.

Appealing aroma of roasted barley, chocolate, coffee, grasses. Sharp tasting, like many of MH's brews, with a bold assertive flavor that informs the drinker, hey we are not dicking around here. Roastiness takes a while to settle in, very warming and invigorating. Some light smokiness in the background, a little bit of greasiness too but not repugnant. Hops are grassy, drying, and refresingly bitter. A perfect balance between bitter and sweet. Other reviews have talked about creaminess but I'm not getting it. I would say this is a bit slick for a stout, maybe even a little thin. Stickiness is appropriate and delightful. Each sip requires another, a very drinkable beer.

Decent aroma mostly made up of roasted and burnt malts and a wee bit of oatmeal. The flavor is too one-dimensional for me (and too much black patent bitterness). It seems to start very similar to how it finishes, with little change in between. I prefer more complexity in my oatmeal stouts, but being Magic Hat the brewers were probably going for a session-style oatmeal stout. And for that, it is fine.

A nice level of hoppiness mixes with the roasted grains to lend a very sufficient and enjoyable bitterness to the mix. Things finish up on a dry and roasty note.

Tasted of nicely toasted grains and either wood or nuts, I havent made up my mind. Some charcoal flavor exists as one would expect, but it doesnt add much bitterness as is often the case.
