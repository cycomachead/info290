"Very original, this is one of the best Stouts I had. Unexpectedly smokey with a new set of flavors for the style. That is a beer that is hard to interpret and that is why you see a higher range of rating deviation."

"O: Nice, but no real port character. Good change of pace, worth a try"
"Had this from a hand pumped cask at tap and table in Emmaus a while ago. The beer came out as a deep brownish black color with a thin tan head on top. The head narrowed itself down to just a thin line over the beer. The smell of earth, and roasted barley were prominent. The taste was a little less intense that most stouts. It was dry and roasted... A little watery too. The mouthfeel was light and smooth. The cask killed most if not all the carbonation here. Overall the brew was decent. It's nothing I'd go a distance for to have again."
"Not the best English stout I've had; indeed far from the greats, but with just enough interest going for it to make it worthwhile."
"Carbonation is waaay too high!"
"Well, an average stout, this one. I had expected some more sweet port notes."
"Thick midnight black with an abundant crop of camel-colored foam, weak in the nose with only basic stout aromas of coffee, chickory, coffee, and roasted nuts. Not bad but not special; as for the flavor, it is also somewhat disappointing - I've had stouts not brewed with port that have more of a port flavor (not to mention barleywines). There is a trace of sweet port, but mostly this is an ordinary (but good) stout with a textbook taste of cocoa, coffee, burnt toast, and a bit of brown sugar. Properly full and soft feel, well matched to the flavor, and dry in the finish with a lingering burnt nut aftertaste. Not the wonderful digestif I'd hoped for, but still a perfectly good stout even if it is rather gimmicky."
"A very good start to my evening, I hope the next two or three (depending on my mood and soberness) are as drinkable as this."
"This beer pours a nice dark,ruby,cola colour with decent carbonation that leaves a frothy,long staying two finger head with heaps of lacing very nice looking,the aroma is just above average with hints of blueberries,dark malty port and some weak coffee,it has an average mouthfeel with tastes of dark roasted malty coated hops which finishes very smooth with no taste of port at all in fact i think the port perfectly balances out this beer to give it a very smooth finish,quite a nice beer that would buy again."
"Worth a try (and a second try)."
"Gets too acidic after a while and is too flat for more than a small glass"
"Pours jet black with a large tan head, which holds retention well. Smells of roast and port, more notes of the latter, but no esters. Has a good roast taste with high bittering, which is a nice complement to the sweet, winey port. This has a medium full body but finishes dry due to the high hopping rates, which is a tad unexpected. Overall, an enjoyable and unique beer, but not astounding."
"I wish more of these would cross The Pond. A subtle stout, rich but also smooth at the same time. The malts give a good roasty flavor. Recommended."
"Bottle: Poured a clear black color stout with a good size foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of dry roasted malt notes with some subtle notes of port. Taste is also an average mix between some dry roasted malt notes and some sweet port notes. Body is a bit too thin for the style in my opinion with some good carbonation. I guess this is OK but not something I would necessarily seek again."
"Bottle at home ...a deep black colour ... with a small tan head ... slightly sweet rum malt nose ... sweet fruity roast malts with a little alcohol ...sweet berry fruits ... low carbonation ... medium body ... its just not got the depth i look for in a stout"
"Bottle at Chaucer's Pub in London, Ontario- A deep brown pour that lets in some light, is topped with a frothy mocha cap with nice retention and lacing. The aromas here are dark chocolate, black coffee, some dark fruits, cherry, a smidge of hops, but no port to speak of. Tastes strongly of black coffee mixed with dark chocolate, a bit lactic, some slightly fruity components which may be from the port. Bitter towards the end, but a bit thin in terms of a stout. Pretty good."
"I am not sure what to make of this beer. As it is, it is a nice English stout. I don't detect much port character here, and so I don't really understand what the brewer is trying to accomplish by making this ""enriched with ruby port."" Something I would try again if I saw it though."
"Have an O'Hanlon's Goodwill Bitter instead."
"I would not bother with this one again."
"A unusual and smooth stout and probably a very good hangover cure, but tbh an unremarkable example of the beer style in terms of taste."
"Overall - An OK stout - nothing special but reasonably drinkable.. worth a try..."
"Other comments: This is a very dry stout so it's definitely best with some pretzels or something to take the edge of the roast. Not my favorite."
"D - A nice beer! The port never dominates but rather adds an extra fruity complexity. The only thing that stops it rating higher in drinkability is the price (AUS $8.99)."
"The soft carbonation suited the style, but the body was just a tiny bit on the watery side."
"A good flavorful sipper that I'd definitely have again."
"I think my hopes were a little too high for this one. It isn't bad, but I had hoped for better."
"(ps - yes, I can actually spell domestic and connoisseur properly!!)"
"Ahhh..memories.."
"M&D: refreshingly light on the mouthfeel yet almost full-bodied for a stout, this is a successful dark ale in-b/w an Irish dry stout and an English stout. The label says it's THE Original Port Stout, enriched with rich Ruby Port; but on the palate the port's influence is kept to the minimum?! Maybe the amount of port added is not so considerable? I remember tasting it once on draught at the White Horse, Parson's Green, and it had a much more profound vinous flavour imparted by the port added to it. And I've also tried a brilliantly ""imitated"" version by the Marble Brewery (Manchester) which is also richer in its port-ish characters. So, at best I'd guess the recipe of this beer might have been changed, or I must've expected too much from the name~~ That said, this is a very good quality stout all the same. Recommended!"
"I donÂ’t get much aroma here. Some very mild roasted barley malt is all. Deep black with a VERY lively tan head. Mildly roasty, but the intensity is very low. Almost no flavor here just a sweetish malt mash and even that isn't very stout like. Very dissapointed with this. I bought this and a stout called Kinmount Willie at the same time. I figured this would shine and the Willie would be mediocre, but it was the exact opposite."
"D: I left the second half in the fridge for a day, but still couldn't finish it!"
"Taste is somewhat like a typical stout: roasted, chocolate malts. Hints of coffee and chocolate, but with a bitter twist on it. I can certainly taste an additional something in this, likely the port. (Never having had port, I can only assume.) Certainly an interesting flavour, and it makes for a very complex stout that is worth repeating. However, I find this quite rich and generally drink this as a ""finishing beer;"" therefore, I find its drinkability somewhat limited due to its dessert-like qualities."
"thanks bieristgut for sharing. from the bottle poured a dark ruby with a big light brown head. aroma wine, barley, liquorice, smokey, chocolate, caramel, hops and hints of plum. flavor, bitter smoke, wine like some sourness, and a dry finish. I have had better."
"The beer poured black with ruby highlights and a persistent 3 finger head. Aroma was chocolate, roasted and coffee. Flavor that is slightly sour with good hops then coffee and a slight nutty ruby port flavor as it warmed. The finish is dry expresso. The body is pretty thin."
"Quite smooth and good balance of flavours: leaves a chocolate aftertaste for me. Certainly one of the best examples of this style"
"This stout poured an almost opaque, dark coffee brown color with thin brown foam. The smell was roasted, slightly sweet malt with a hint of fruit and licorice. The taste was roasted malt with a mild fruitiness and some bitter hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and low carbonation, and it wad dry throughout. The roasted malt and hoppy flavor lingered. This was a good stout."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown with a ruby hue and a thick light tan head. Both the head and the lacing are foamy and lasting. Slightly vinous aroma with roasted malt and coffee as well. The body is not as rich as a lot of Stouts, and the taste leans toward a bitter coffee, along with cocoa/chocolate and malt. The port wine that is added does not really enhance the flavor much but it is more present in the aftertaste. I like what this Stout is hinting at, especially considering Port wines are among my favorite. The finish is somewhat dry and bitter and lingers with the coffee and Port flavors. Overall this is pretty good."
"Deep brown to black in colour, roasty malt nose, with a faint hint of port. Very charry ash tray like roasted malt flavour, almost a bit too charry. But in general pretty tasty and and quite a decent bitter finish, thickish and complex, not too bad in the end."
