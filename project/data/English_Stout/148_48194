4.13,5.1,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.25,"I have to admit, I set my expectations quite low for this one, just by looking at the clear bottle. Couldn't be more wrong! The beer looks pitch black with small head after the pour, though  with great retention. Nice. Smells quite interesting: the usual roasted malt and chocolate tones are supported by some kind of acidic aroma, which is reminding me of dark fruits, which I find quite pleasant. In the mouth feels very creamy with small amount of bubbles. The taste is pretty unusual for a stout. Usual coffee and a hint of chocolate are there but the backbone is still sweet, acidic, dark fruity. Lasts vey long revealing some small amount of bitterness.  Would buy this again!","RickyS","Feb 28, 2015"

4.08,3.8,4,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Poured from a bottle into a chilled glass. Malt aroma with cocoa influence.  Very pleasant. Colour is black with tan head, and I mean "no light gets through the glass" black. Taste has very little bitterness. Sweet malt flavour with a definite chocolate presence. Mouthfeel is medium-light and very smooth. A stout this sweet is a pleasant surprise.","vikinggary28","Feb 16, 2015"

3.93,0,4.5,3.25,4.5,3.25,3.75,"Pours black as a starless night.  World Class head volume, outstanding lacing and retention.  Light nose of roast and chocolate over a slight mineral note.  Heavy light body with just a hint of smooth texture.  Above average carbonation level with a bit of effervescence in the middle and finish.  The outstanding flavor profile is reasonably intense, a bit complex and very well balanced.  It begins with chocolate sweetness which is a blend of bittersweet dark and milk characteristics.  The middle has a very subtle bitterness from roast and hops over a distinct classic mineral note (think chocolate soda).  The finish is a slow fade of rich sweet chocolate with hints of vanilla.  This is an excellent choice to introduce someone to stouts.","tillmac62","Dec 13, 2014"
4,1.8,,,,,,"04/05/13 At Rattle N Hum on tap (nitro). Usual smoothness from most nitro pours. Extremely light body but not watery. Aroma is subtle & indicative of the shy flavor profile. Nice balance of sweet & bitter. No hint of the contemporary adds of vanilla/coffee/chocolate, etc. Listings show conflicting ABV but this tastes shy so I'll assume it's @ 4.5%. If that's the case I could see this as a pleasant session companion.","seedyone","Dec 07, 2014"

This stuff pours a slightly murky midnight sienna topped by a finger of sandstone foam.  The nose comprises roasted malts, dark cocoa powder, light treacle, and a hint of vanilla.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a bit of mild charcoal smoke and a healthy amount of straight-up toffee.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy feel.  Overall, a nice, enjoyable stout, a fitting punctuation mark on this delightful meal and visit.","TMoney2591","Aug 08, 2014"

4.2,6.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/20/2011. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, toast, dark bread, toffee, herbal, raisin, plum, and roast/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, herbal, raisin, plum, and roast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, herbal, raisin, plum, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with an awesome roasted malt bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome English stout! All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 16, 2014"

Good off-white head and nice malty aroma. From the first sip I was impressed. Nice mouthfeel, not too chewy but nice body. The flavor was chocolate, vanilla and slight roastiness. Truly, even though the bottle says Belhaven Scottish Stout, it is a Porter, a strong porter, but still a porter. They even say so on their website. It does not have the coffee overtones associated with stouts. This one of my favorites. Slainte!","WildHighlander","Mar 27, 2012"

2.52,-35.9,4,2,2.5,3,2.5,"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a below average English Stout. It seems like most of the English beers I have tried lately all have this super sweet malt profile that seems to take over any features of the particular style and dominate the aroma and taste, that is pretty much what happened here. This beer didn't have good drinkability the sweetness is far too high for me to finish the whole bottle, glad I got my brother to help me out. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked like a proper English Stout. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, it was just way too sweet for the style and the sweetness seemed to drown out most of the other flavors and aromas. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's pretty cheap but even at the bargain price of $1.39 a bottle it doesn't really warrant a repeat purchase, not recommended. This beer turned out to be a let down, I just don't get how sweet all these English styled beers I have tried are and almost all of them seem to have that, maybe I just don't like the style but I have had some that aren't so I know it can be done. Not a good first impression for this brewery, I don't think I will be revisiting them again anytime soon.","StoutHunter","Feb 21, 2012"

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark ale with two fingers of latte foam, this falls slowly to a quilt of the same leaving lots of cobwebs. Very roasty nose; plenty of dark, coffee, charcoal malts and even nearly a savory, almost salty smell. Really a rich nose. Very roasty flavor as well with stone fruit, umami, coffee, oatmeal, some catty hops and even a little thyme flavor. I like this beer so far, really crushable as a stout. A little short of full bodied with moderate, but short lived carb and a semi dry finish. This is a really nice beer with hi potential for being paired with fire broiled red meats, taters, and some veggies. Good stuff.","harrymel","Feb 08, 2012"

Nicely balanced aromas of roasted grain, cocoa, some vinous notes, and perhaps a touch of smoke. The taste adds a creamy note and a touch of malt to the whole gentle package.

It has a beautiful and sudsy beige, two finger head that sits atop the beer for sometime. The head looks really nice. The aromas featured are smooth dark roasted malts, soft chocolate, and a sharp hop like bitterness. After awhile the subtle chocolaty aromas prevail, and in almost a milky manner. It is initially sweet and bitter, milky, chocolaty with a nice light, light roast finish. The flavors blend well together and make for a nice, light drinking stout. The body is pretty light for a stout but it drinks very smoothly. I'm a fan. Overall this is a fine beer and worth the $4.50 or so per bottle.","aasher","Jul 29, 2011"

A slight roast bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel.

There is plenty of nice roasted malts that play off nicely with the hop, making this a nice thick, malty, fairly balanced stout. There is a touch of smoked peatiness in the malts that gives it some Scottish character, but the smoked flavors are pretty subtle and get balanced out with the leafy hop.

The taste is a rich roasted and sweet malted barley that make you think of baked chocolate in any various incantation.

There is a nice dose of roasted chocolate malts in the aroma but the aroma overall is rather subtle and unopposing. Not much in the way of hops but to me that is the way it should be for a stout.

The taste is big on the chocolatey malt, some coffee, an underlying tart fruit perhaps lemon, copper, not much hops. Has a fairly dry like tea flavor.

4.1,4.3,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Mineraly, creamy stout that delivers a more-than-decent amount of roast and chocolate flavors. Nice amount of light berry fruits - strawberries and maybe even some cranberry tartness. This is a very good lighter style stout that can even classify as sessionable. Good, good beer, I enjoyed it tremendously.","twiggamortis420","Jun 08, 2009"
2.22,-43.5,4,2,2,3,2,"Reviewed on 4/16/09. Bottle. Pours black with a small light tan head. Aroma is quite odd--slight roasted malt and also some vegetal notes I think Flavor is rather salty with a vague malt backbone. This is one of the oddest stouts I've had and I don't like it.","LilBeerDoctor","Jun 08, 2009"

4.25,8.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours pitch black with a thick tan head. Good lacing down the glass. Burnt malt and chocolate/caramel aromas. A slight woody hop aroma is also in there. A very nice sweet chocolate, roasted malt, carmel flavor. A bit of hop in the finish, but there isn't really any bitterness in the finish, maybe a little. It is very delicious. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and I could definitely have quite a few of these.","Kromes","May 21, 2009"

Nice black malt flavor, notes of coffee beans and dark chocolate. A bit of caramel sweetness along with a slight acidity. Body is nice and full yet airy. Carbonation is a little too high. Very drinkable and tasty.","illidurit","May 21, 2009"

4.42,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Very nice flavor profile here. Starts off with notes of slightly roasted espresso and peat, backed by a semi-sweet chocolate backbone. Quick burst of earthen hops hits mid-palate before a boozy finish of Scotch and bitter roast. Medium mouthfeel with a nicely carbonated body and a semi-dry finish. Was not expecting this degree of complexity from Belhaven...VERY pleasantly surprised by this beer! Goes down smooth for the 7% ABV and is refreshing to boot. Highly recommended.","wagenvolks","Beers"

3.92,-0.3,5,3,4,5,4,"This is listed as a wee heavy, but I would call it a sweet stout or a milk stout. Sturdy tan head. Black body. Sitting, untouched by the world around it. Malty aroma. Also some dry stout aroma, I guess the malt. Sweet milky flavor. Some quiet hop bitterness in the back. Super smooth and silky. A lush stout, deserving of the name "stout". Definitely not a porter. Very good, maybe a bit sweet to be too drinkable. But the body is perfect. A one to stick with.","AChamberlain","Mar 31, 2009"

3.71,-5.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Black body, it was dim in the bar, the candlelight did nothing for it. Very creamy foam, similar to a Guinness on nitro. It left a solid sheet of lacing down the opposite side I was drinking from. Compact head of foam with a creamy feel. Nose was mellow, possibly it was too cold, but didn't get much besides faint roast. The feel was light and creamy, almost a milk stout minus the sweetness. Dry unsweetened chocolate and tobacco. Thin bodied with a light creaminess. Miles ahead of Guinness, still fairly simple and sessionable.","emerge077","Mar 17, 2009"
4.29,9.2,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D- I would drink this all night and love it. I'm sure the nitro tap is helping immensley so I wonder how this fares in a bottle. The flavor profile does not scream stout IMO so i'm guessing that this is just a trumped up version of their regular wee-heavy. Either way it's brilliant and everybody should try this. Top notch stuff.","BARFLYB","Mar 08, 2009"
4.13,5.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Belhaven Scottish Stout is a terrific double stout. The light sweetness and roasty flavors are very well balanced, and the medium body and smooth texture make for a beer that is very easy to drink. There is nothing in the nose, taste, or mouthfeel that suggests that this is a 7% brew. Quite nicely done.","vurt","Mar 06, 2009"

2.44,-37.9,3.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours dark dark brown with light tan head and moderate lacing. Smells of sweet roasted malts and chocolate, nothing too big here.

4.15,5.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Overall impression: A firmly hopped, highly sessionable milk stout. By far the hoppiest milke stout I've ever had but the earthy hop notes, roasted grains, and slight creaminess lent for a well-knit beer.","mattcrill","Jan 14, 2007"

3.6,-8.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a very deep brownish-red which you can actually see through and has a fairly small off-white head that mostly dissipates quickly, though it leaves a very substantial ring and reasonably good lacing. Quite good for a brown ale, but not quite on style for a stout. Smell is mild coffee and caramel, with a minor chocolate note and a hoppy hint. Rather sweet, which diminishes the complexity and makes it seem a touch muddled. Taste is a bit on the thin side, coffee taking the lead. Less sweet than the aroma, but retains a touch of caramel. Finish is short and slightly earthy. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and lacks body, but isn't too bad, and drinkability is reasonably good. Not too bad, but not all that good either.","Mandrake","Nov 01, 2005"
2.53,-35.6,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a clear dark burgundy under a reddish brown one finger head that settles a bit too quickly, leaving no trace at all. The nose is strong of sweet caramel. The mouth is light and quite prickly. The taste is thin, almost watery. Sweet caramel dominates, with just a hint of something roasted on an open fire. There is no hops backing, so the overall impression is quite sweet. Caramel dominates the aftertaste, although a touch of dryness emerges very late. A disappointment.","Globetrotter","Beers"
