"Not all that interesting, but it tastes pretty nice to me. I'd try it again."

"Final Thoughts: A good American Stout but nothing special. It's robustness is almost a bad thing because I was anticipating something more drinkable. Would I drink it again? Probably not."

"This tastes like someone tossed some Hershey bars and a can of coffee into the bonfire and then made smoke juice. This really tastes like bottled smoke. On a side note they could put a little more effort into their packaging. The labeling kind of sucks. The only reason I bought the six pack is because it had six different beers in it and I couldn't make up my mid at the store as to what I wanted."

"Perhaps their best beer, obtained bottle at Champane's Cellars. Dry, chocolate coffee roast stout. Black, with enormous amount of mocha coloured head. Cocoa aroma, as well as roast and chocolate. Smooth mouthfeel. Similar to Oveltine, if Overltine was a beer. Good drinkability,though dry with sips revealing more sugar sweet and roast bitter."

"Poured like oil from the bottle to the glass, however, remarkably not a cloying stout. Nice and roasty, smokey flavor with a clean dry finish. Not super complex flavors, but that makes it clean and drinkable. Light cocoa, dried fruit, with a tinge of floral hops make this a very drinkable and appreciated stout. Would not hesitate to buy a 6 pack."
"Taste-Big roasty flavor,Subtle coffee and dark chocolate. Semi-dry finish, with faint herbal hop note. Decent flavor and drinkability. A nice match for a pulled pork sandwich."

"As a beer in general I didn't mind drinking this, but for a stout it's poor."
"Moutfeel and overall is meh. Nothing special, nothing awful. I hope this brewery does well and makes great beer, this just is not one of them."
"I see that a lot of reviewers liked this beer, and will admit that while this beer was made good for what it is, I just find it to not be a good tasting stout, but luckily there are stouts out there that I like."
"D: Overall, not a beer I would seek out again. It's just a little too watery and one-dimensional for a stout. It is an okay beer, but not one that really showed me a lot."
"Drinkability: Everything started out so well, but fell apart at the first sip. Ridiculously thin and watery. Oh well, one and done for this beer."
"Overall, quite enjoyable. It's not a huge aggressive beer as advertised, but it's tasty and rich and doesn't appear infected like the other beers in this 6'er. I would purchase this one again. It reminds me of Bert Grants Imperial Stout if anyone remembers it...another misleadingly labeled beer."
"D- A very nice take on the style that is smooth and not overly rich. I would get this again."
"Speaking of which, I wish this small Grand Rapids brewery all the success in the world, but they'll have to earn it. Bonecrusher Stout is not getting them off to a rousing start. Maybe Hopknocker Imperial IPA will be better. It could hardly be worse."
"Good English or Foreign type stout, just don't expect and American Stout and you'll enjoy this fine."
"Dark brown in color,with a thin tan head. Aroma of dark roasted malt,chocolate,and sour bitter coffee. Flavor was chocolate,and a very storng almost bitter coffee roast,with a dry finish,medium body, oily mouthfeel.Drinkable but not my favorite."
"D - Pretty good. I had a few of these at Thanksgivng, and it was about perfect for this. Cheers."
"Sample at the Super Terrific Stout Tasting on 02/16/08. Two Stouts whose labels feature an axe being wielded. Cool. This beer is blackish-brown with a medium and foamy light brown head that diminishes slowly. Rings of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists mainly of coffee along with hints of roasted malt and dark chocolate. Medium, smooth body with a tasty chocolate and coffee character, along with light hops and malt. The finish is mild and roasty with a mocha aftertaste. Better than expected, I would try this again."
"Above average twist on an Americanized English Stout. Schmohz does a good job keeping this one consistant between batches. This is one of their mainstays, so you don't have to worry about falling for it and then having it go away. The icing on the cake would be to offer it on Nitro with a creamer faucet. Very drinkale!"
