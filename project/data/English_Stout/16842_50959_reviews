"Overall OK, nice malts but briny flavors are strange and don't meld well with the nice malts."

"Overall an interesting example and quite enjoyable. Never in my wildest imagination would I ever have thought of beers brewed with oysters. Never the less, a real easy drinking sessionable stout."

"Poured on nitro-tap at Three Tides, and served in a pint glass. The beer pours jet black, with a thin, milk chocolate colored, filmy head. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, salt-water, and seafood. Flavors are initially heavy, dark roasted coffee, with a smooth chocolate undertone, and flavors end with briney and salt-water oyster flavors. Not overpowering, but unmistakably oyster, so if you aren't a fan, consider yourself forewarned. The aftertaste is roasted and smokey, again with seafood characteristics at the end. The brew is creamy and smooth, and very tasty overall. I am a big fan of this beer."
"I haven't had very many Oyster Stouts, but this is amazing. Mineral Water meets Ice Coffee. Very refreshing, and I wish I had a dozen Pemaquids on the half shell to pair this delicious beer with."
"Out of a growler that was given to me by the MW Brewery crew (you all rock!) this beer was an opaque black color. When I first poured this beer out for me and my company it settled like a Guinness! The head was tan, two-fingers thick and retained nicely as a cap hat left very good lacing. The aroma was of roasted malt, coffee, unsweetened chocolate and hints of brine. The flavors were delicious and totally on-point for a stout. Chocolate malt, toffee, coffee, touches of rich soil, hints of caramel and a little smoke. As the beer warmed elements of brine began to appear, reflecting the ONE DOZEN OYSTERS that were used to brew this beer. I know how weird that sounds but you really can't tell aside from the touch of brine and perhaps a certain meaty 'depth' that the beer has. The finish was bitter and apropos to a stout. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body was full and the carbonation excellent for the style. The MW crew makes a number of good beers but this one really was my personal favorite and a joy to drink."
