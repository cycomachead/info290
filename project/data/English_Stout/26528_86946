This beer is similar to a breakfast stout, but without a super high ABV. Overall a nice drinkable stout!!! It's not mind blowing, but definitely meets the expectations.","monts","Feb 22, 2014"

3.71,-3.9,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"A fairly thick stout with powder-y cocoa tones showing more than anything else. Not as cohesive or as thick as I was expecting. It's consistent, sure. Feel is pretty smooth. Minimal nip of carbonation. Pretty decent. Somewhat thick flavor on things, but not overly interesting. A nice production, but I prefer and like Helltown's other productions much better.","RblWthACoz","Mar 11, 2013"

3.98,3.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"pour is black with dark tan head, very tight creamy head. Nose is light, roasted coffee, hint of malt sweetness, and faint citrus hop. Taste is more roasted and well made coffee, a touch nutty, almost no bitterness with a hint of cream and faint citrusy hop. Body isn't overly thick or heavy, very creamy and smooth, extremely drinkable and well made.","cpetrone84","Beers"
3.74,-3.1,2.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Overall this beer has a great malt bill all around. the malt bill definitely has a full range of roasts of malt, light medium and dark roasted malts up front and a balanced bit of noble hops. good stuff, I'd buy it again.","GreenJetta912","0"
