"Solid chocolate stout, very drinkable."

"O- Overall this is a decent beer.  Its very chocolaty with a nice roasted malt backbone.  Yes, the chocolate tastes like one of those cheap samplers you get at the drug store-but hey that's the fruity chocolate I grew up with.  As Forrest Gump says-life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you are going to get.  This is the cheap roman raspberry chocolate piece.  But thats still pretty good.  FWIW I thought this beer was decent and my husband really likes it."

"Thin, odd off-taste, not good. Barely choked it down. (Only because I don't like to waste money) $3 price tag for bomber should have been tip-off. never again. Apparently I need to put together a longer review. Don't know why; this beer is just bad."
"The taste is overwhelmed by the cherry or tart zestiness of a bottle of champagne for lack of a better description. Hardly what I expected from a chocolate stout. Chocolate seems more like an after thought."

"O: Not a bad beer but probably one that I wouldn't buy again. I prefer my stouts thicker with less sweetness coming through"

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is jet black with a thin, foamy, filmy, light tan head. Nose of toasted oats, chocolate syrup, and some hints of bitter coffee. Flavors are sweet, with the chocolate syrup heavy on the forward tongue, and some roasty notes in the back. Way too sweet and sugary for me. Thin, slick body that tries to be creamy but misses the mark. Chocolate sugar once again in the aftertaste, with a bittersweet linger in the slick finish. Not for me, but a true chocoholic might dig it."

"Taste starts where the nose left off, but quickly makes way for a tartness that becomes all encompassing through the rest of the experience. Mouthfeel is smooth, but drinkability is junk with the sour character defining the brew. Pass."

"Good fruit and cocoa aspects to this laid back and drinkable stout."

"O: not the best chocolate stout that I have had but a convincingly good English stout. It is dry and relatively drinkable with chocolate and coffee flavors."
"Overall swing and a miss. The beer underneath seems light and thin, and all that was there was destroyed by possible infection, sour icky fruit, yeasty flavors, just bad."

"O: This stout tastes very English in nature, so they definitely hit the mark in that regard. It isn't a bad beer in its own right. But why is this billed as a chocolate stout? I can barely even taste the chocolate. The beer still has plenty of that acrid, acidic bitterness to balance a little more sweetness. Adding more chocolate would go a long way here. Give the people what they want."

"Pours a one finger khaki head that fades to thin layer, leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Very light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Smell: hints of coffee and chocolate and flavor is roasted-burnt coffee and essence of chocolate. Not my idea of a chocolate stout, needs more chocolate and carbonation. $3.99 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, Vt."
"This beer has some problems. I do not know if this was a funky bottle, or if this beer is actually supposed to taste somewhat sour. Regardless, aside from the sourness, there are not a lot of nice things going on here."
"Overall: I don't think they can call this chocolate. It's raw cocoa powder thrown in a decent English stout. Aggressively bitter and dry. Definitely one of the more unique takes on using chocolate I've encountered."
"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of garnet highlights when held to light. Creamy tan head shows great retention and lacing. Smells of roasted coffee and chocolate with a hint of wet dog. Taste is chocolate and light coffee with a bit of caramel and butterscotch and a bit of lactose sweetness. Medium to thin body with a light level of carbonation and a slick oily mouthfeel. Nothing objectionable here, but nothing horribly exciting either. I'd have loved some more body and maybe some more chocolate."
"The aroma seemed promising, but there may have been problems with the fermentation that lead to the off-flavors."
"Overall: All I can think of when drinking this beer is OK, where is the chocolate? I was certainly expecting more, but it is the coffee that dominates. Not a bad beer, but nothing that really stands out. I will pass in the future."
"Overall a decent beer, but lacking in carbonation."
"A solid chocolate stout. It's not Young's Chocolate Stout but it'll do for a local example."
"Solid, but I'd like a little more carbonation."
