As it is, this is a pretty flavorful, very drinkable stout, and I personally don't care for hoppy stouts, I'll keep this one on my radar.","Sneers","Apr 02, 2015"

A six pack runs $10 around me. A bomber is the same price. Thats a freakin joke! Im surprised by some of the high ratings. Glad i only got a single.

The smell of the beer had some nice roasted and chocolaty aromas to it. The taste of the beer was a sweet, and a little bitter in the finish. The mouthfeel was mostly flat from the cask, a little watered down also. Overall I'd rather have this on regular draft or from a bottle I think.","Knapp85","Jun 10, 2011"
4.08,7.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"There was no written indication that this was on nitro-tap, but judging by the appearance, I believe it was. Poured an opaque black, with the milkiest, creamiest head I've ever seen on a beer: foamy white with tan shadowing, and it retained to the last drop, and laced nicely. Nice roasty aroma, with notes of coffee. Roasted malts and coffee in the taste, milk chocolate, with light briny notes in the background, giving an interesting blend of flavors. Not too thick in the body, but still very creamy, which I attributed mostly to the ubiquitous head. Very nice, and very drinkable. This was my first oyster stout, and although I was a bit squeamish about the style at first, I know it won't be my last.","Rifugium","Mar 10, 2011"

Large samples at that. It was exceptionally fresh and smooth. Dark with small tan head. Aroma is chocolate and roasted malt. Sweet, Smooth and flavorful. The oysters really add a nice compliment to the roasted malt flavor. I came back the next day and had another pint, it was again exceptional but had lost just a touch of its freshness.

4.15,9.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep, dark near black with only faint highlights of brown around the edges... firm cap of brown head from the hand pump and good retention and lacing. Scent is earthy with notes of dark roasted grains, bitter chocolate char, smoke and a touch of coffee. Taste is a nice combination of the above notes from scent along with some creamy sweetness, nothing too bold or overpowering but solid. Fuller side of medium bodied, wonderfull on cask with the appropriate carbonation. The newly revisted cask/nitro version with the oysters blows the prior bottle and tap version from 2-3 years ago out of the water. Highly drinkable.","rfgetz","Sep 23, 2010"
3.73,-1.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Love stout is black, black and dismal with a nice dark tan head thats bubbly and milkshakey. A nice smear of bubbles on the glass remain. Smell is English in that the ingredients are not bold. There is some chocolate, cocco, roast, smoke and salt from da Oysters. I don't like Oysters in general, to slimy for me feel wise, but they do impart a distinct salty vibe with some other taste I cant quite describe. Besides that this taste is a light mix of everything I just said above in the smell category. The chocolates are not very rich and/or potent. A bit of char/smoke as well. Body is thin and 'kinda' watery but it holds it's own, a nice light feel that makes for a smooth ride. Carb is low. I still kinda like this stout, it's not mindblowing and I don't have the urge to have a whole pint. But on occasion, the oysters included love stout is good for a small gander.","BARFLYB","Sep 15, 2010"

The taste was chocolately and had acidic roast at first that progressed to a pronounced milk caramel candy and flowery finish. The beer was silky smooth, with tiny soft bubbles.","Soonami","Sep 11, 2010"
4.07,7.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Tasty version of a good style, one that can be a little bit of a turn-off for the bivalve-averse...or a turn-ON for the amorous wishing to experience the oysters supposed aphrodisiac traits (I just got the 'Love' Stout double entendre as I typed this review).

Aroma is the best thing this stout has going for it. Tastes of watered down mildly roasted grains, bitter cocoa, maybe some very watery weak coffee. Has a seltzer water aftertaste. A bit thin bodied with medium to moderate carbonation.","ClockworkOrange","Mar 09, 2009"

Like said before that could have made it fuller in feel. It was a thin feel when sipped and very easy to go down w/o any creamy residue left behind in your mouth. I feel that it was lacking something this time around. Well I brought a growler full home to enjoy and it was the same.

Then in the flavor something goes wrong. Again, there's the big, black grains along with a distinctly English yeast milk or cream-like flavor.

This is a bottle aged almost two years in my beer cellar and the flavors have combined beutifully for a soft easily drinkable stout. The oysters are barely noticable except as something different about this stout, a slightly different scent and flavor then the usual malt, chocolate, roasty flovors your expecting from a stout. But even knowing it's oysters (clearly labeled on the bottle) it's not what I'd expect. The biggest drawback in my mind is the overabundance of carbonation, which gives it an acidic finish. Certainly a beer you must drink from a glass.","templar316","Mar 20, 2007"

Nice is fairly mild, mostly coffee, nothing too much else of not. Taste is pretty standard stout flavor. Lots of roasted malt, overall. Some mild chocolately hints that show up on the tip of your tongue. A little bit of lemon that catches you as the beer fades out, in the very mild hops. Fairly bitter overall. Overall, a solid, if not particularly noteworthy taste. Feel is surprisingly thin for a stout. Good carbonation. I liked, but didn't love this beer. It was a fairly good stout, but nothing to write home about.

The Love Stout was the first one i tried because it was still cold outside here and i wante a heavy beer. pours dark with small head and smells normal for a stout (roasted malts, sweet chocolate). Mostly what is memorable about it is the vague saltiness that makes it a little most crisp than most stouts. I assume the saltiness is from the oysters that they supposedly put in the brew pot, but others have said that they no longer do this. If not, they must still add something to give it that salt flavor. anyway, i like it enough to want to finish the ones that are left, and it was my second favorite in the case behind their fantastic IPA.","aforbes10","Mar 16, 2006"

The taste is very roasty and malty up front with a nice chocolate-like flavor dominating the middle palate of this brew.

3.93,3.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This is an interesting brew. The first impression from the nose leads you to believe that you have stumbled upon a sweet stout. However, the taste is very complex. There are sweet notes, but also very rich and dry tastes that impart a dry or imperial stout. The hops are hard to pinpoint. There is so much dark malt that the hops do not really shine through. This beer is brewed with oysters in the brewkettle to add a mineral component. That seems to be what balances out the sweet, milk stout characteristics. This stout is by far, the most unique stout I have ever had the opportunity to taste. As you move towards the middle of the beer you are almost certain that you are drinking an imperial stout with a very balanced and deep, rich flavor. At 5% alcohol, this is an impressive stout in today's culture of high octane imperials. By the end of the beer the sweetness is all but gone. I will definately check this out again.","Maestro","Mar 30, 2003"
3.97,4.5,3.5,4,4,3,4.5,"Pours a dark black color with a toffee colored edging. There is virtually no head. The aroma is caramalized sugar that is just a bit burnt, a bit of bourbonesque alcohol notes, and some roasted malt sweetness. A hint of chocolate slides in as well. The taste is sweet roasted malt, dark chocolate, and a bit of espresso on the finish. Just enough bitterness is present to clean up the sweetness between drinks. The mouthfeel is smooth, but a bit lacking in the carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, as this beer goes down way too easy. I'll definitely pick up some more of these in the future.","aaronh","Feb 24, 2003"

3.29,-13.4,3.5,4.5,3,2,3,"Taste was sharp coffee bitterness at the start with smooth milky sweetness following. Slightly slick bittersweet chocolate flavor backs everything up. The mouthfeel is oily, but rather light. Not very much weight from the mouthfeel perspective, rather thin. Finishes bittersweet and quick. Overall a descent stout. The body could be better. Complexity could be a bit better as well. The aroma of this beer is what really shines, everything else is just above average.","bmills1608","Feb 12, 2003"
3.63,-4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Well, I did not love this one. It was a decent stout, but it was thin and didn't have enough flavor for me. I have heard that this will make a person cry on cask, so I will have to pay a few buddies a visit in Philly.","ElGuapo","Jan 14, 2003"
3.48,-8.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Black in color with a thick, dark tan head. Aroma is lightly roasty, somewhat salty with a bitter chocolate undertone. First impression I got was of the beerÂ’s being a bit thin. Malt-dominated, with a fairly nice roasty character and a decently bitter finish, and some prune-like fruit notes developing mid-palate. Aftertaste is quite nice, but still the flavor profile is a bit one-dimensional. Drinkable, but not very memorable.","mzwolinski","Jan 12, 2003"
3.9,2.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"My girlfriend has become a big fan of this stout since i brought a case back to school. Has a bittersweet chocolate taste. Light carbonation and thinner than expected body. Aroma is that of coffee and chocolates. I liked this brew but for the same style I think sam adams cream stout is a little better.","allboutbierge","Jan 09, 2003"
3.7,-2.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours out black with brownish edges and a very thin dark tan head. Nose is coffee, a little chocolate. The flavours here are dominated by the coffee characteristics and a quite strong bitterness. What I found curious (and a little offputting) was a slight sour note towards the end of the mouthful. Finishes again with the bitterness. Smooth over the tongue, carbonation is quite low (this is bottle conditioned), and kind of a thin or light feel also shows itself. Good, but that sour note (must be the oysters...?) makes me think that it's not for constant quaffing.","the42ndtourist","Dec 30, 2002"
3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Cool label on the Love Stout from this local Philly brewer. Nose of coffee and dark chocolate from this black brew, thin lace atop. Quite malty for a stout, with the sweetness I expected of a milk stout. However, there is a nice crisp bitter hop finish that balances quite nicely with the sweetness. Mouthfeel is nothing but smooth, although it's a tad thin. Some more body would be appreciated, but this is a quality stout. I look forward to more from this brewery.","IrishRedRock","Dec 21, 2002"

3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Very nice Stout. Pours a dark brown, almost black with sparkling highlights. Big, creamy head that lasts. Creamy sweet mouthfeel, and taste, toffee and lightly toasty taste. Big creamy finish, lightly hopped and crisp. Real good Stout, very drinkable.","HopheadEd","Dec 04, 2002"
4.1,7.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours into the glass a dark, dark brown color that when held up to the glass showed some light of ruby red. The head was thick and beige/tan in color. The lace, like a good stout, lasted to the bottom of the glass. The aroma was of coffee, milky/cream, roasted malt, some fruit and hops. The taste first showed up hops, a little bitter, then the milky coffee took over the dominance of the taste with hints of the fruit coming in and out very easy. Sweet and roast malt. It ends nice and slightly dry. Good beer, enjoyed it, and went back for seconds.","Jarod","Nov 15, 2002"
3.71,-2.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Acquired via trade. I tried it after Victory Storm King, and while not on the same level it was still a decent brew. Pours a deep dark brown with a medium dark beige head. Earthy coffee/chocolate aroma. Not sure what oysters brought to the table but I am always for something different. Had a bottle-conditioned texture, with coffee, chocolate and prunes (?) in the flavor. Rather sharp finish. Not too bad.","Dogbrick","Oct 09, 2002"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Fresh hop/cocoa/roast nose.  Rich tan head with a lasting lace.  Deep dark plum color which is opeque.  The initial taste hits you with hop bitterness in the boil along with some fruityness... this then mellows into a roast malt smooth base.  Notes of bitter chocolate and expresso also touch the tongue.  The roast is earthy and leaves a slightly dry tongued finish.  The mouth is smooth a solid the entire way.  This beer shows impressive complexity and balance.  I ""love"" this stout. It is a stand out selection for Yards.","frank4sail","Oct 06, 2002"

4.17,9.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Bottle conditioned. Classic stout appearance: black body. a few ruby highlights, and a frothy tan head clingly to the sides as it subsides. Heavy roasted coffee and chocolate nose.  A tingle of hops accompanies the coffee and chocolate flavors on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Brewed with oysters, but I don't detect any seafood in the glass. Would go well with a plateful though. A solid but not spectacular stout.","RonfromJersey","Aug 30, 2002"
4.2,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Roasted coffee and chocolate assault the nose.  The beer is dark brown and opaque with a nice brown head that slides down the glass.  Coffee and cholcate flavors are the most prominent with only a hint of sweetness... think bitter chocolate.  Overall a very nice stout.","jreitman","Jul 23, 2002"
4.1,7.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours into the glass with the usual (for a stout/porter) tan/mocha head with a good Belgian lace going on. This beer is opaque, even when held directly in front of a bare lightbulb...""None more black", as Derek from Spinal Tap might say. The nose is nice and chocolatey, a nicely balanced bittersweet aroma, with slight hints of smoke. Taste is somewhat light on the palate...not alot of sweetness from the malts here, more of that great bittersweet chocolate & a brief flash of hop bitterness. Smooth-drinking is the key word here! Finishes with a light mouthfeel, a very tasty ""session"" beer...dumb name though! And I am glad to report not a trace of the purported 150 lbs. of whole oysters that is added to the boil is present. :o)","beerluvr","Beers"
4.3,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is an oyster stout. Oysters are added to the kettle during the boil but don't worry, it doesn't give it any fish flavor! It may be raising the pH, however, due to an addition of calcium. But the aphrodisiac qualities of the oysters did inspire the name. Nice ""black"" with brown highlights. The aroma is limited, offering roastiness, a little malt, and maybe some alcohol. I guess that's expected for the style. The head is tan but dissipates quickly. Very nice flavor with some sweet malt, a little light chocolate, and a balanced roastiness. Body is a little thinner than anticipated. Finish is long lasting, almost mouth-coating. The roastiness just doesn't want to go away! A nice pint to relax with after work.","NeroFiddled","0"
3.68,-3.2,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A decent stoudt, little on the sweet side.  I won't pretend that I can distinguish the oysters, but I'll trust they are in it.  Nothing really sets this stoudt above the others.","marble","Beers"
4.57,20.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a nice dark brown almost black color...Very light malt aromas on the nose...On the palate there are nice notes of English dark malts, tiny chocolate tones and not sure what flavor elements the oysters add, but this is nicely sweet, strong and full flavored and has exceptionally smooth mouth feel. Overall a very enjoyable Stout...","WilliamPhilaPa","0"
