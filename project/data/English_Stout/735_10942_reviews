"Enjoyable stuff overall."
"A good, lightish stout with a good roast and chocolate character."
"There's a reason no one really regards 'oyster stout' as a category unto its self: despite such a peculiar and distinct brewing process, more often than not there is markedly little to distinguish it from ordinary stouts. That being said, this beer is no doubt unique and, should you find yourself in San Francisco, one you should definitely make a point to try."
"D: This really missed the point for me. Could have been a bit more full-bodied. I found no distiction from adding oyster."
"D- I would love to give this the real test and enjoy WITH oysters. Otherwise, meh."
"Despite the name, I tasted no oysters, oyster shells, calcium, or saltiness in this beer. Tasted like a conventional stout to me, albeit with a bit of a noteworthy alcohol finish on the back end. Head was non existent, didn't really have any lacing. Not much aroma, really. Taste was pretty good, and fresh, as it should be from the tap."
"I'm glad they're brewing this - true oyster stouts are few and far between - and I would certainly have another glass some time, but I won't miss it when this year's vanishes from the tap."
