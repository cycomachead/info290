"Darker brown pour, with a small cap of tan head that mostly dissipated, spotty lacing. Basic roasty malt aroma, and not much else. In the taste, dark malts, coffee roastiness, yeasty esters, grains, earthy hops. Not too bad, but nothing really interesting going on. Body was medium, mouthfeel a bit thin, but English stouts can swing that way. Not undrinkable."

"Pours a near black with a small foamy off-white head. The most noteworthy aspect of the smell of this beer is roasted barley, chocolate, and caramel. It's slightly bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. Otherwise, a pretty smooth stout to drink along with a burger or steak sandwich (which, both by the way are great at this brewpub.) Leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The only complaint is perhaps a slight watery taste to it -- just didn't leave me with that sense of ""Wow, what a great fresh beer!"" that you get at the best of breweries."

"Pours nearly black, maybe some deep ruby highlights when held up to the light. Doesn't really have much of a head, so then it gets little lacing. Smell and taste are pretty good though. On the sweet side with toffee, but has a nice roast component. Medium body, low carbonation, smooth finish. Slightly bitter coffee/roast finish. Paired well with the pulled pork sandwich I got at the brewpub."

"I like this creamy full mouthfeel that is highly quaffable, look forward to returning to n. virginia to procure more of this."

"O: Come on haters.... give it up for Blue & Gray here! I've always dug this one: it's cheap, readily available, and done by a brewery that I have the utmost rest for."
"o - Overall a pretty nice English style stout. Lots of roasted and coffee notes, with some hops coming through in the taste. Worth checking out."
"O: Would like this if it had more body."
"O - not bad, but bitter flavor would push me to pick something else."
"Fairly easy drinker on a cold night. Light body helps with that and the tastes combine for a pretty nice overall effect."
"D - I think this bottle has turned. If I had a chance to get another one of these I'd like to try it just so I would know whether or not what I have now is infected. Not what I want in a stout."
"not something to jump up and down about in celebration, but a very drinkable stout nonetheless."
"Thanks to Jeff and his wife for all the great beers, Hope to get back there soon and taste all the good vittles at the new resteraunt."
"Pours an opaque jet black with about a finger of bubbly tan head that leaves a decent amount of lacing behind. The smell is of burnt and roasted dark malts, wheat, oatmeal, and biscuit. The taste favors the roasted malts, burns the biscuit, and adds in a small bite of hoppy bitterness. The body is on the heavy side of medium, has just the right amount of carbonation, and does not malignantly cover the tongue, instead smoothly (though somewhat chalkily) rolling through. Overall, a pretty average stout, but pretty drinkable nonetheless."
"Poured a black body with a one-finger tan head that died quickly and left no lacing. A good roasted/coffee malt smell that is mixed evenly with hints of sweetness like chocolate and caramel. A light-bodied, smooth and somewhat creamy stout that is mellow. Caramel, bitter/dark chocolate and some toffee (maybe even butterscotch b/c this beer is slightly buttery) that is complemented (but not balanced) with roasted and coffee malts. This gives the beer an easy to drink quality that passes sweetly and then finishes dry, although the dry malts/beer have this funky, sour fruit quality. It is almost like they used cherry flavored coffee beans or something...like a french coffee. It is really odd and I am wondering if I got a really old/bad bottle. This little quirck makes the beer s little less enjoyable and the bomber I had is enough."
"D - Drinkability is just about average. Every aspect of this brew comes together to make a mediocre to above average experience. The aroma could be bumped up a little. Flavor seems a tad off. Glad I got to try it but not something I would seek out again."
"Stonewall Stout is my first experience with Blue & Gray Brewing Co. I'm not overly impressed, but this is far from a bad beer. If the sour/acidic aspect could be knocked out, it'd be better. How much is hard to say. But, it's a minor annoyance for me. All in all, it's above average. Definitely not a bad option, especially if you're looking for an English Stout to check off your list."
"D: Very drinkable, all the flavors blend well and it just feels good going down."
"Overall, a fine Stout that is well balanced, delicious, and satisfying from every angle."
"Notes from 11/4/05"
"Plenty of bitter roated malts, great for the cold winter months. Recommended."
"Taste is smooth in the mouth. Chocolate laced with smoke if that makes any sense. Wow, a bitter twinge tickles the back of both sides aof the tongue in the end."
"bomber from Rick's in Alexandria"
"A nice dark stout. The finish was a little dry and had some bitterness, but was enjoyable. This is a nice warmer and worth a try."
"D - highly drinkable. Flavors are very balanced. Pretty good stout. Not as big as what I am used to but I can't think of too many English Stouts I have had."
"If the nose were a bit less of sour grape, allowing more smokiness and maltiness to come through, I think it would hit the style even better, but it still is a nice stout."
"D- Overall a very drinkable stout. Not as heavy as some, so it it more quaffable."
"This is a very good stout from a good little brewery, Blue and Gray. Deep brown pour almost black some light shines through. Head goes away quickly. Smell is roasted slighty burnt coffee, some faint chocolate. Mouthfeel is a little light for a stout but it is an English stout, this actually stands to make the pretty drinkable for a stout of any kind."
"drinkability - Made fresh to be drinkin fresh and you can tell. Has a clean taste to it. Hard to describe but its like spring water was used here. No preservatives here. hope to try some more from this place when i get my hands on it."
"D: I am very glad that we opened the bottle now. It held enough flavor to make it worthwhile, but not enough to make it a must-have."
"This was one of my favorites from Blue & Gray and it poured dark with a small tan head. Aromas of chocolate, coffee, etc., what youd expect of most stouts. But this one has a very clean finish and high drinkability while retaining good flavor. I hung out on the porch and put back a couple 22s of these easily. The funny old guy at the brewery was in love with this stout as well. Definitely pick some up if youre around Fredericksburg."
"D - I prefer the taste of this to many other stouts because it has a lighter body than others. It finishes strong and is very drinkable. The slight hops in the aftertaste mixed with the dark chocolate flavor is a wonderful combination. Pick up this gem if in southern Virginia."
"Drinkability/Notes: Stonewall Stout is very drinkable. A very nice stout that is full of roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate flavors. Very easy to drink and one that would make a nice session beer. I could see downing a bunch of these, thankfully I purchased a few bottles. Like Blue and GrayÂ’s Pale Ale, Stonewall Stout was actually better on tap. If you have the opportunity, pick up a few bottles and you will not be disappointed. I very good stout that I will buy again. Definitely recommended. Seek and enjoy, you will not be disappointed."
"Obsidian black pour, dark tan 1 inch head and lots of stickiness. Head falls to a table and solid ring. Smell is toasted malt, not strong and lightly bitter hops. The taste is malt driven, ashy, toasted bitterness. Nice long finish, but the body was too light. A little more creaminess and this is a great stout. As it is, the beer is reminiscent of a mass produced Irish stout. Very drinkable, with an ABV of 5%, this is a nice alternative. Had this on Easter with lamb and vegetable kabobs. Decent pairing."
"In all fairness, I probably sat on this one too long and should revisit it at some point."
