"o - will not buy again."

"o: A mild, easy-drinking, highly sessionable brew. Given its low ABV, it might better be called a porter."
"Again, a dark sweet malty taste character at first with a mildly dry and clean finish. It was easy to drink but very much like Guinness Stout overall."

"The stout lacks depth and breadth. Too crisp a texture. Not satisfying in the least."

"A very good taste and smoothness overall. This was marketed as a black and tan case, and as a black and tan ingredient, this stout fairs well - with a mild, smokey taste, and a smooth feel. It's not quite as good as a Sam Smith's stout, but very good indeed."

"O - could use a little more ass to the actual stout flavor, but by no means an awful beer"

"A simple, basic stout. Could be roastier, and is rather thin. It came in a 6-pack with three of this and three pale ale, with directions on how to make a ""black and tan"". On it's own, it's decent enough, though nothing special."

"Overall: a mild and simple but acceptable stout that is a bit weak on flavor,"
"Overall, I like it. It is definitely watery and not very complex but the style really isn't supposed to be overly complex. I think this would be a great alternative to someone who wants to drink a stout that doesn't taste like Guinness (coming from an area where Guinness is one of the only craft beers offered at the bars). I'm going to have to say it's about a 3.5 out of 5. Would I seek this out, well it matters what the alternatives were at the time really. I wouldn't shun it in the least."
"Taste is mainly roasted grain. Not very malty, nor does it have any real burnt taste. The body is totally watery in a refreshing sort of way. This is more in the ABV range of an actual English-style beer, so the lack of maltiness is appropriate. Still, it's not totally dry. Still, it's a different sort of Stout. Faint hoppiness and not as bitter as the black Stouts. Think of it as a dark lager and it goes down easier. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Ralph's Supermarket in San Clemente."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and slight char. Taste is much the same with cookie dough and slight metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is a bit watery flavor-wise but not too shabby."

"O - This is okay. It worked well as a black & tan mix."

"nothing to write home about if you want to to enjoy it they sell this beer with the pale ale and it called black and tan pub kit they want you to mixed both beers together and if you do its just right half of each it taste mighty other wise skip this beer"
"nitro tap beers are horrible. this feels bad in the mouth and has little flavor to speak of. This is bad beer."

"Figured I'd try out the stout by itself before I attempted a ""proper"" black and tan. This stuff pours a bleak black-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts and a bit of light coffee. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a dab of that Guinness-like sourness in the background. Unfortunately, here it comes across kinda like burnt sourdough. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a decent stout, but one that seems to necessitate the black and tan in order to really be enjoyed, as it's verging on blandness."
