3.6,-3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"My slow, gentle pour resulted in only some tan wisps, but c'est la guerre. Color was a deep dark brown, black to the eye, but with brown highlights at the edges. Nose had notes of dark chocolate, fudge, licorice and dried dark fruit. It is a promising date with the lass. Mouthfeel was thin and she has aged well, but she has definitely aged. The taste was very charcoal smoky up front with dark chocolate underneath on the tongue. I have a feeling that the charcoal would have been more muted in her youth. Finish was smoky and charcoal, not bad, but perhaps not exactly as intended. It might be worth revisiting this beer, although it was billed as bottle conditioned.","woodychandler","Jun 25, 2011"

The beer is definitely charred a bit around the edges, it has a molasses and caramel flavor, and is predominately semi-dark chocolate with some slight bittering notes. There is a bit of creamy smoothness hidden underneath all the prickly stuff. The beer isn't particularly watery, has very modest ABV, and had little aftertaste.

The aroma is dark fruit, roasted malt, and some chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, with the addition of charred malt and some citrusy hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit slick but the carbonation level is very high. There's definitely more carbonation than I'd like in a stout. Drinkability is decent, but would be much better if the carbonation was lower. It's not a bad English Stout, I'll have to try this again in the future.","bluejacket74","Feb 14, 2009"
3.65,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, not usually the type of beer that I go for but this is a nice darker beer that is worth drinking for a long time if you're in the mood for the style.","TheManiacalOne","Jan 14, 2009"

The aroma is light chocolate, a bit of soy sauce, and a bit of watered down coffee. The flavor is light coffee, a bit astringent, baker's chocolate, and an odd saltiness, that kind of follows suit to the soy sauce. The mouthfeel is light for a stout, slightly watery. This is really just an average beer across the boards.","hwwty4","Nov 17, 2008"

4.48,20.8,4.5,4,5,4.5,4,"Short, fat 500 mL bottle, conditioned, with no freshness date - served in a chalice. Pours quite black with slight ruby highlights and an inch of light brown head that stays for awhile, and even after 45 minutes, is still 1/4"" thick. The bouquet consists of roasted, smoky, earthy/peat, and charcoal characteristics with some sweetness, dark fruits (plum, currant, raisin), and, at the end, notes of strawberry-kiwi juice, I swear. There is a big coffee, burnt, smoky, earthy malt quality on the palate, with a substantial coffee and hop bitterness. Also, there is a lactic acidity, leather, cocoa, unsweet chocolate, currant and blackberry, charcoal, and oily green hops along with a soft English hop character. It has a light to medium body that feels powdery and unfiltered and leaves a long roasty coffee finish. Overall a very nice, robust stout that is quite complex and a treat to quaff. I need some more of these around for cellaring purposes.","mmmbeer","Jul 25, 2006"

Aroma is moderately of dark malts and coffee, in particular. Taste follows the nose, sedate dark maltiness, and a slight coffee bitterness close. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin, but still nice, but drinkability is very high for this, goes down easy.","ppoitras","Oct 16, 2005"
3.65,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry and earthy, black malt scent with some hints of chocolate and coffee. It's semi-sweet with a light hop aroma. The taste is decent. It has a dry, yet slightly sweet black malt flavor that hints of chococlate. It goes down easy with an earthy, bitter finish. It's too dry for me. I like hops in a stout, but I don't care for such a dry finish. The mouthfeel is decent also. It's a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. I would love to try this on a nitro tap.

2.86,-22.9,4.5,3.5,2.5,1.5,3,"Taste: The flavor upfront was extremely dry. There just wasn't anything there. Then in the middle rose the strong flavor of dark roasted malts and burnt wood.

3.99,7.5,4.5,3,4.5,4,4,"The color is almost black with a dark cola glow towards the bottom of the pint glass. The head is enormous, light brown, and very thick and sticky. Pour carefully or the head becomes a pain in the ass because the retention is almost too great. The aroma is surprisingly weak and consists of a vague smell of roasted coffee. Taste is initially dry and bitter, with a roasted coffee flavor. This flavor is joined by a dark chocolate malt taste towards the middle of a sip, which brings a nice balance and rich sweetness. Finish has a dry, bitter roastiness. Overall flavor reminds me more of an Irish dry stout than the few English stouts I've sampled. That said, Dorothy Goodbody's Stout is a choice beer find and only lacks in the aroma category. Highly recommended.","Gagnonsux","May 19, 2005"

I guess you could say it was a very, very dark brown. The nose was prominently toasted malt but did have some coffee notes as well. The mouthfeel could be described as robust and a little bit rigid. This is mostly very bitter and very roasted in flavor leaving a wholesome barley underpining. The finish leaves a dry film and remains bitter with just a touch of coffee flavoring. I will say its not the easiest brew to put down and overall pretty average. However, it is an interesting interpretation of the style.","Hhawk06","Apr 16, 2005"

3.85,3.8,4.5,4.5,4,3,3,"Great looking label. Consequently, great beer, too! Poured up black as coffee with no head, even with a slightly aggressive pour in an attempt to precipitate some foam. Smells like black dirt, wet canvas, a little bit of coffee, and a touch of dark unsweetened chocolate. The taste yields a bit more hops than I had expected, and builds upon the unsweetened chocolate tone first noted in the smell. Quite tasty. The mouthfeel, however, is exceptionally thin for this style. It seems hardly thicker than tap water. That's bad, and at the very least, dissappointing to me. I love a good stout, and as such, I like them to be thick and damn near leave an oily residue in my mouth. North Coast's ""Old Rasputin"" is good example of this. This stuff boasts a wonderful smell and lovely taste, but merely an average mouthfeel at best. Decent","SilentSabre","Nov 21, 2004"
3.45,-7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Culling down my list at the Winking Lizard (Columbus) I came across this after being hesitant to try. Not a bad looking bottle. This selection poured deep brown with a very large beige head on top leaving small bitsof lace. The smell was of coffee and roasted nuts, subtle and sweet. Tastes average like most english beers I've had. Dry coffee, thin malt and a decent dose of chocolate. I drank it slightly faster than most but there's nothing complex or confusing about this beer. It ended up leaving a thin veil of residue on the toungue but not unpleasent. Overall a decent selection and worth a try.","Ahhdball","Oct 30, 2004"
3.43,-7.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Sampled while in Vegas. I like the label, but then again I'm a sucker for the wholesome pin-up type of esthetic. Pours out with an opaque black body, spongy off-white head, with eventual lacing. Dark roasted malt on the nose, kind of peaty. Dry earthy flavour, somewhat herbal. Somewhat thin mouthfeel. Not something I'd pick up on a regular basis. I do like the lable though.","IronDjinn","Sep 26, 2004"
3.41,-8.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This stout is jet black with hints of mahogony if the light hits it just right. You get a big thick foamy light brown head. I could only get a slight hint of coffee aroma thru that thick foamy head. There was a good strong roasted malt flavor with a very dry finish. I did'nt pick up any chocolate or coffee in the flavor.","ybnorml","Aug 25, 2004"
3.98,7.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This delightful stout poured jet black, and formed a milk-chocolate head. It was pleasant an elegant, offering a mild roast aroma coffee aroma with hints of chocolate. The flavors blended coffee, grain and chocolate notes, in a smooth and refreshing brew. This was a light and drinkable brew.","AllThingsNinja","Aug 08, 2004"
2.82,-24,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"pours out of the bottle an oil black clour, with no head to speak of...thus absolutely no lace. aroma can best be described as one of pure baking cocoa. hints of caramel and toffee...and a ghost like sourishness. burntish malt taste...nice flavours in the malt profile...some unsweetened chocolate and burnt and bitter malt. the body seems rather thin which leads to a light mouthfeel. rather watery, lifeless and soulless. i'm guessing that this bottle is off or old or had rough travel from britain to my refrigerator. not a stout i will revisit. if only the stout were as good as the the blondie on the label.","budgood1","Jul 28, 2004"

3.59,-3.2,4,2.5,4,3.5,4,"I have to admit the label is probably the main thing that attracted my eye to this one on the shelf. Poured a dark black with the slightest brown edges. Sticky white head that had medium retention and left some lace. Aroma is very faint, but I am picking up mostly a sharp, chalky chocolate aroma. The taste was really quite good, I thought, mostly a bitter chocolate malt, roasted grains, smoke, and a touch of dry hops on the finish. It reminded me of a guiness without the nitro charge. Mouthfeel was smooth but a little thin and bubbly on the finish. Not bad at all except it was a little pricey.","nixhecks","Jan 13, 2004"
3.38,-8.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I had to buy this bottle because I couldn't turn that girl down (Good Marketing). Anyways this stout was lighter than most stouts and not real creamy or well carbonated. It had a sharp taste to it. The flavors were abundant. Very roasty turns into burnt molasses, lots of burnt bitterness. I noticed some vanilla in there along with some coal flavor. Tobacco was present. Hops were weak but they were there in the finish. The flavors were too inconsistent and the malt wasn't productive enough. But the bottle was excellent!","granger10","Dec 24, 2003"

3.17,-14.6,4.5,2.5,3,4,3.5,"The bottle's fat body and narrow, straight neck, made it impossible to keep this beer from glug-glugging, but that was only part of the reason the beer had such a huge head. Long after pouring you could see sheets of super-tiny bubbles weaving upward to a head that never quite faded. The body was darkly black, and took tilting to see any color. The aroma was light except for a sour dish-rage smell that was a little off-putting. The flavor was not sour, but after an initial bit of roast, tapered off to be more on the bland side. Very dry though.","aracauna","Nov 06, 2003"
3.6,-3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Medium finish, vanishes a bit too soon, leaves the tongue too quickly. A nice stout, with late fruit emerging, and tasting well, while it lasts. Pretty average, nothing I'd turn to again...unless she'd show a little more LEG...A-hem","feloniousmonk","Oct 26, 2003"
3.95,6.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: 4.6% ABV? I could drink this all night long. Light on the palate, big on the flavor. For me, this would be fantastic when pulled from a nitro tap. Dorothy Delivers!","OldFrothingSlosh","Oct 22, 2003"
4.27,15.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Dark black pour, just a little light passes through down at the bottom. Creamy 1/4 inch head, good bubbly lace threads. Nice aroma, rich chocolate and a mellow blueberry tone. Very good flavor in the Brit style (non-huge), medium coffee roast, definite mocha cocoa, and a dryish but not deadly ashy finish. Pleasant creamy mouthfeel as well and it takes on better characteristics as it slightly warms. It won't blow your socks off, but this is a comfortable beer to have sitting beside the chair in an imperial pint glass.","ADR","Oct 02, 2003"
3.26,-12.1,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Rich chocolate nose, with some roast, mollasses/vegemite. Really dry mouthfeel, bitter and roasty. Cadbury Chocolate flavour, some cola, vanilla, vegemite and some citric hops, quite a lot of different flavours. Light to medium bodied, with a fizzy mouthfeel. Its not bad, i just don't think the flavours blended together that well.","rastaman","Sep 25, 2003"
4.36,17.5,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Flavor is definitely wholesome. Rich roasted bittersweetness, with wonderful coffee, chocolate, and dark berry flavors. Mild hopping providing a light dryness to the finish. Smooth mild carbonation, long finish, with a coffee aftertaste. No graininess or bready flavors. Wonderful. I could drink this as my stout of choice.","UnionMade","Jul 29, 2003"
4.36,17.5,5,4,4,5,5,"This Stout has a nice mild coffee taste to it. The nose is that of coffee. This is a Stout that I truly enjoyed every taste that I drank and that is saying something about this particular Stout as I do not enjoy the extremely strong coffee tasting Stouts. Give me a mild tasting Stout and I am happy!","hotstuff","Jul 15, 2003"
3.83,3.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This Goodbody is a good body indeed. The dark black mahogany body is topped by a nice off-white to light tan head that lingers for awhile. This dissipates to a thin layer that leaves some decent ring lacing. The nose is light, but gives a sense of roasted malt and hints of caramel. The flavor is very much a roasted malt that gives some nice caramel taste and a slightly oily and earthy sense. Very well balanced against the hops. This is not overly strong stout, allowing the drinker to have more than one to a session. A tad bit watery on the feel. Whenever I see the Dorothy Goodbody beers I wonder if I enjoy the beer or the labeling the most. Who cares; both are equally well done.","AtLagerHeads","Jul 12, 2003"

4.29,15.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured a dark mahogany black with just a dab of a tan head forming at the top. The smell is pleasantly malty - roasted and chocolate notes are very prevalent. The taste is smooth with a strong hop bite. As the beer finishes on the palate, it fades to roasted grain bitterness, finished smoothly by a recurrence of hops. A very tasty brew.","jlervine","Jul 03, 2003"
3.94,6.2,4.5,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Wonderful appearance! It's very deep mahogany/black body is topped by a great big dollop of rocky tan foam that holds well. It eventually drops to a creamy collar and thin surface covering while just a small rocky outcrop remains of the former mountain of foam. It leaves solid sheets of lace throughout the first few sips, and some pretty solid rings after that. The nose is limited, but displays some roastiness and some dark caramelized sugar. The flavor delivers very much the same thing with a dryish and gently acidic roasted malt that expresses some nice caramel as well. The yeast and hops have added a thin note of citrusy fruit that livens things up. It's light and smooth across the palate, gently caressing the tongue with a soft, fine natural carbonation before simply sliding away. The flavor remains, however, in a long and dry lingering finish that first displays a light metallic note; then some licorice; and finally a delicate roastiness and rising bitterness that eventually cleanses the palate and leaves you ready for another swallow. Very well balanced and quite nice! It's certainly not overdone, allowing you to have far more than one in a session if so desired; yet it also has just enough flavor and character that you might want to.","NeroFiddled","Jun 20, 2003"
3.75,1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A dark black stout with a good sized head. The aroma of sweet malt, chocolate and coffee. I was surprised by the carbonated feel of the beer which I found a little detracting. No overwelming flavor comes through, noticeable coffee, roasted malt and chocolate. Not very complex. It is smooth at the end and overall could be very drinkable.","BigHead","May 30, 2003"
3.71,0,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Virtually black, thick liquid with a thin, pretty head. Smells a lot like bitter coffee. Coffee and roasted grains. Its really a pleasing aroma, and suits the beer very well. A rough, jagged graininess dissolves into a unbelievably creamy finish. Mildly bitter at the end. This is a nice, drinkable dry stout. It could be a little more intense, but its still a very good drink.","Suds","Apr 18, 2003"
3.73,0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Yet another very good stout. This brew pours out a pitch black color, with a head that waives to you at the start, and quickly dissipates. The aroma is acceptable, but is really not as prominent as the flavor of this stout. That flavor, by the way, is slightly sweet and pronounced. This one is worth a try. Prost!","goindownsouth","Apr 04, 2003"

4.2,13.2,4,4,4,5,4.5,"Name says James Bond. Label is a ""wholesome"" Marilyn Monroe. Black with ruby highlights body. BIG foamy tan head. My lips left a dent. Lace: hell, there is a half-inch thick mass of rocky foam hanging down the inside of the glass. Lots of burnt and/or toasted notes in aroma and the taste. Taste adds a little hop zing, but not a lot. Smoooooooth. But not the artifical smooth of nitro cans. At $4 for 1 pint 9 fl oz, I wouldn't buy this often, but I will pick it up again. Very nice.","RonfromJersey","Oct 19, 2002"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Black in color with a very bubbly off-white head.  Medium bodied beer with a bit of sweetness underlying some pretty intense burnt/roasted flavors.

3.91,5.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Fluffy bubbly tan head stays pancaked on top of the striking black liquid. Medium bodied but not sweet. Soft and rounded burnt grain and charcoal flavours are lush within the maltiness and throw hints of smoke also. Earthiness comes from both this and the hops donning a growing bitter finish.","Jason","Jun 11, 2002"
