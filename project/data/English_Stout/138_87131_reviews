"Overall: As stouts go, it's not a bad one - if you're looking for something with an insanely complex flavour profile then you're in the wrong place. However, if you're after a good, drinkable stout which is a cut above the typical Irish offerings then this is a good bet. Widely available and well worth checking out."
"Quite soft, gentle. Fine. dark and rich."
"O) This is a great supermarket stout, focuses on doing the basics right.  Recommended."

"O: The flavors of this stout seem to strengthen as it warms up. It is rather flavorful considering its body."
"My mark out of one hundred would be 87."

"M&O: in general the carbonation level is executed pretty well, although the body feels at times thinner than perhaps desirably so; all in all this Double Stout has retained a moderate body and flavour profile, crafted in a way that the balance in flavour, good level of dry-ish bitterness and approachable drinkability make it a session-type stout. One pint is definitely not enough at any sitting, to me at least."

"A pretty standard stout , the flavours were much as I had expected going in with a nice balance between the darker malts and the roasted flavours but the palate was a little harsh and the carbonation also seemed off meaning the beer wasn't as smooth or as easy to drink as I would have liked."

"Lots of great components, a great stout."

"Really enjoyed this."

"the flavour is barely okay & considering this was marked higher than the prices on the other supermarket beers next to it this makes it a fail"

"Probably Shepherd Neame's best beer."
