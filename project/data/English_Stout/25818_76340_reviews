"This is a very bad example of a barrel aged beer.  Flavors are muted under lageresque type corniness in the beer.  Not sure what it is, but another poor example of beer making by lost rhino.  I should have known not to even give this a try due to the dust covered bottles on the shelf when I bought this."
"Overall:  This is a good stout, boarding on very good.  Great flavors of malt and some coffee and sweetness.  The only hang up I have, and it’s not really a hang up, but a comment, is that the beer is labeled as a barrel-aged stout, bourbon barrel-aged actually, but I don’t get much bourbon flavors or any wood.  Still, it’s a very good stout, and had it not been labeled as a bourbon barrel-aged stout, which makes the drinker anticipate certain flavors that this beer lacks, I would have rated it much higher than I have."

"I did have one batch were it was very hoppy, the second was far less. Maybe it was really fresh. Either way defiantly worth a try (:"
"Served in a snifter from a 22 oz bottle, very nice balance of the woody bourbon barrel aged flavor. Had on tap before at the brewery and just as good."
"That is all."
"O - I enjoy the bourbon barrel aging, but it can easily be overdone and overwhelm the beer flavors.  Some I've had taste like someone just poured a shot into a stout  This beer seemed to have about the right amount of aging flavor.  The barrel aging dominated, but wasn't too much."

"Draft pour at Mekong.  Dark black mahogany color.  Very little head so wondering how old the keg is.  Smell roasted coffee and oak with a hint of Tennessee whiskey.  Tastes of chocolate with coffee and I want to say rye. Lightly oily in the mouth.  Goes down smooth but has an odd after taste.  You get a wash back of coffee and roasted malts buried under slight whiskey.  I don't taste a strong ABV here.  Mild for stout, but it is an English stout.  Russians make it almost burn.  I'm not a fan of the after taste.  I think they used whiskey barrels instead of bourbon barrels.  I prefer bourbon."

"D: This was not very strong on the bourbon, but it had lots of oak character. A tasty stout with very nice body and well hidden alcohol. Smooth finish so very easy to drink and enjoy. Maybe best fresh, but it could probably age too. Recommended."

"Pours near black with a dark tan, thick head that produces ample lacing. Flavor and nose are both a little too one note relying too heavily on bourbon but given the ABV this is never overly boozy. Some roast malt, molasses and brown sugar from the base stout hide behind the bourbon, but this is mostly vanilla and barrel heavy. Body is medium thin with light carbonation and a silky finish. Needs some work, but recommended if you see this on draft."
"Lighter body, with soft cask carbonation. Only a slight bit of heat. Not a huge stout, but the oak and bourbon lend a nice touch."
"Overall, pretty good and solid for a first barrel-aged attempt. The bourbon just came through too much; perhaps blending some of the base beer back in would have balanced things out a bit."
"Has all the makings of a GREAT bourbon barrel stout - just a little more watered down than I would like. Sweet, malty, everpresent vanilla - delicious! This sort of beer could form a fantastic foundation for variants ... coffee nibs perhaps? Congrats to Lost Rhino for creating a wonderful product!!"
"O: I have no idea why there aren't more positive reviews of this beer. It's a delicious bourbon-barrel aged stout with all the character of an BB-aged imperial stout but with the ABV of a regular stout. Win-win."

"Overall a worth example of the style."
