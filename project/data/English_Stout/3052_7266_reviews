"O: This has all the right components but tastes a bit watered down. Definitely sessionable and by no means bad, though"
""
"Overall... a very nice stout, good as seasonal and with food too. To revisit."
""

"Overall Impression: Not impressed, weak flavors, almost not residual taste. Not a great product"

"O - a very well balanced and respectable stout. There are better stouts of this style out there but on the other hand there are a lot worse. Would go back for another."
""
""
""
"A queer brew indeed but enjoyable."
""
"Overall, a little too ashy and thin for my taste of stouts."
"Yes, this is a great, all-around stout. Rich and robust without clobbering you with excessive alcohol in the ABV. Very good..."
"Overall, this is a decent beer. For an English stout, this one is pretty darn good. It is balanced, dry, and drinkable."
""
""
"Still, I don't know if this tastes like a 100-year-old recipe (like the label says) and there are better stouts in England and better beers from Hook Norton."

"Notes: another SENSATIONAL beer from Hook Norton. This is velvety smooth, delicious and aromatic. Delicious, chocolately without being sweet. At 4.8% abv this makes for one hell of a session beer. I have loved every Hook Norton beer I have had, this and Sam Smith's are my favorite two British brewers."
"o - Very drinkable and pleasant stout. I'm not sure what makes it a ""double"" stout as its not particularly heavy or robust. Definitely worth a try and might be a good starting point for those who are trying to get into darker beers."
"This is a good stout. Nice representation of the style, methinks."
"Overall: Good English stout. The carbonation was just too much for me and I couldn't get past it. I'll try this one again to give it a fair shake."
"O- This beer has dark roasted grain characters that or dry and crisp but mellow with no bitterness but all the flavors and aromas are a bit thin. Some nice depth to the beer."
"This stout poured out as a nice black color with a good looking thick head on top of it. The lacing was minimal if there was any at all. The smell of the beer has coffee, roasted malts and hints of chocolate on the nose. The taste of the beer follows right along with the smell. The aftertaste is dry and has a burnt toast bitterness. The mouthfeel of this brew is quite smooth and not overly heavy. Overall it's an enjoyable stout from England, I would like to have it again one day."
"O - Very nice stout to sit and enjoy, either on its own or as a session."
"Mf:"
"Pours a very dark brown with some amber hues. Fluffy tan head that slowly disappeared and created a nice laceing. Aroma is of creamy malts and chocolate coffee. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is of dark bitter sweet chocolate.Slightly bittered coffee like finish. I liked it!"
"Overall it's interesting, but either this beer isn't super outstanding within the style, or this is a particular style I'm not that fond of. I'm not sure as I believe this is my first English stout review. Still, this is a nice brew that I've enjoyed."
"The taste is very good and this is a fine stout. I appreciate the 4.8% ABV with big flavors and a fairly full palate. Some of the American brewers should take note that you don't need to have ridiculous ABV to make a fine beer, and often the ABV can detract as much as impart. That being said, the beer has nice drying dark roasted malts, some sweeter notes do form underneath, but the beer has a nice semi-bitter chocolate flavor throughout. This beer dries up considerably in the finish and the semi-bitter becomes full out dry in the end. There is a touch of metallic in this beer which gets in the way and detracts. Overall, this is a really nice, light to medium bodied stout that has lots of fine qualities."
"I'm glad I tried this beer, but I don't think it will be bought again soon."
"Very easy to drink. Good solid stout, but a bit boring. I'd never refuse this. It is good, but easy to move on to something else."
"Notes: Some Ecuadoran dark chocolate adds rich, bittersweet notes that drastically improve my appreciation of the beer."
"Pours out very dark, with a thick off white head. Smells of roasted malt, with hints of piney wood. The flavor is mostly of roasted malt with a mild acidity on the end with just a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel is rather thin, but not too harsh either. This beer is sippable, but that's more due to it's lower ABV rather than to an outstanding flavor."
"This beer is worth sampling if you get a chance. But there are so many wonderful brews out there, I doubt I'll dwell on this one."
"Was very excited to pick this up at Jungle Jims and when I brought it home and went to open it the cap nearly flew off the bottle due to carbonation... not sure if that's usual, but damn! I really enjoyed the taste of this beer more than anything but I really couldn't get a good grasp on the smell due to the fizzies jumping up and tickling my nose and the mouthfeel was that of drinking over carbonated drink. I wouldn't say not to try this beer but it definitely wasn't my favorite."
"D: Overall, this is a good standard stout. I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be. Maybe because it's a ""double"" and I was expecting more complexity. Still, I'd have another."
"D: Goes down easily, tasty, not much of a kick, sweetness is a bit much but this would be a nice after dinner desert beer, and not a sit with it all night."
"D - eventually the chocolate would get old, but not until a few were gone, lol."
"A well made stout, best served on a cold winter night with the wolfs..."
"Overcarbonated. Opened the bottle at my desk and a couple of papers fluttered in the blast of CO2. Poured a mammoth volume of very foamy, frothy, sudsy, light tan head that lasts a long time and lots of lace. Color is a clear, almost opaque, very dark brown. Aroma is malt, roast, toffee, cocoa, coffee, vanilla. Flavor is like aroma and very tasty. No sharpness at all; well balanced. Body is good once it settles down. Finish is like flavor and of medium length. Session beer."
"A solid brew with a lot of flavor (meets the bold criteria, at least in part), but why this is a ""Double Stout"" remains a mystery."
"For what this is, I think it is great. A true English session ale."
"Overall - A pretty good stout although there are better examples... definitely worth a try though..."
"Notes: A fairly earthy and fruity/tart stout that is a little light but also sessionable. Not as much roasted flavors as some other stouts. Pretty good session stout that is nice but not really worth searching out for or spending a lot of money on it, but if you can get it for a reasonable price, go for it."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down easy and has a well rounded character."
"This is a great, unpretentious, simple stout. Love it."
"Bought on a whim while in the mood for a heavy winter UK beer. Opaque to the edges of the glass where, if you shine a light behind the glass, you can see teeny teeny teeny little bubbles quickly flowing in evenly-spaced columns toward the top of the brew. How'd they do that? Pours with a heavy, dense and gi-normous head which takes forever to settle down into a puffy mound, not unlike that found on top of a Duvel. You can even style it a bit with your fingers. Loads of toffee, chocolate and roasted grain in the aroma. The body was lighter than I expected, which isn't necessarily a terrible thing. The taste, however, was excellent: plenty of roast and toast, with apricots, chocolate, raisins and a slap of orange at the end. Lightly hopped but there's enough to give an edge. An absolute malty delight-- a beer which has earned a spot in my refrigerator door. According to the Web site it's only available for two months out of the year. I'll be stocking up later this week."
"A thin, dark brown head with low retention. Color was a deep brown with ruby highlights. Mouthfeel was medium with chocolate and coffee flavors competing for attention. Nose was very cocoa-like. Finish was extremely chocolaty, like birthday cake. Hey, my birthday is coming up on 25 February! Anybody want to buy me a BT? No takers?!? Quelle domage."
"Hook Norton Double Stout poured a very dark brown, appearing black, with a massive foamy tan head. It looked like a root beer float. Good lacing on the glass as well. Smell was brown sugar and roasted coffee. Taste was full of dark chocolate, and hints of roasted malt. Mouthfeel was ok, a bit sticky but not bad. Drinkability was good. Overall this was a nice stout. Hard to come by the English Stout style, this one was nice."
"What a super crazy craggy, tan head of three fingers and a dark cola with antique copper highlights. Nice column of bubbling.The aroma is of dry chocolate chips dark roasted malts, light brown sugar and Starbucks French roast coffee grounds. The taste is very roast with maybe a touch of smokey oak as they roast some coffee beans. As you sit with some hot, dark cocoa. Dry, bubbley, and smooth all in one. Quite the session stout in my opinion. Full of flavor and not heavy on the palate."
"Dark chocolate with a touch of heavily creamed coffee is the flavor. Again, the alcohol is more present than the ABV suggests. Very strong carbonation cuts through any body that might be here. The swallow and aftertaste is thin but it lasts--the finish is almost chewy which is very curious."
"A very pleasant stout with a distinctly English character. The beer pours a very dark reddish-brown color that is just barely translucent when held up to a light source. Without backlighting, the beer appears opaque and black. The head is a relatively thick, beige mass of creamy bubbles that dissipates at a medium pace. The aroma is mostly chocolate malt with a hint of hops. It smells like creamy chocolate milk with a hint of beer, really. The roasted malt comes through smooth and creamy in the flavor. There are notes of coffee, chocolate, toasted bread and light hops. It's a very pleasant, easy drinking beer. There's a ton of flavor for the relatively low abv (at least as compared to the current spectrum of stouts). I really enjoy good English beer styles and I sincerely hope that American breweries start paying more attention to the lower alcohol, big, balanced flavors of this brewing tradition. The mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy, particularly for a bottled beer."
"a boost to the drinkability scores because the scores for both smell and taste weren't 4.5's but certainly better than 4.0"
"The sample I got foamed like nobody's business, and left a very thick and rather persistent light tan head. Beer itself is a warm dark opaque brown. Aroma is strongly of molasses and roast malt. Flavor is not strong but pleasant, malty and molasses-ish, slightly sweet with hints of coffee and smoke. Texture is fizzy and smooth."
"Pours a very nice black color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger plus creamy tan head, with tons of nice thick creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with caramel/toffee/coffee notes. The taste is very nice creamy, malty, with some caramel/toffee/coffee. Medium body. Very drinkable, this one is a joy to drink, thanks Bill."
"Drinkability: A lot of flavor packed into this low ABV beer; very nice"
"When I saw ""double stout"" on the label, I expected over 8% so I was surprised that it was less than 5%. However, the biggest surprise is how excellent this beer really is. Easily one of the best English beers I've ever had. I must check out their other offerings!"
"D: I snagged a gem in this...I bought it on a whim. This guy is a recommended brew and fancied my tastebuds"
"Hook Norton Double Stout is too expensive to be a regular purchase, but I'm having a fine time with this bottle. And what a great looking bottle (and label) it is. Since there aren't too many classic, well-brewed English stouts available in America, I won't be a bit surprised if it sells pretty well."
"A very pleasant basic stout. Pours black with dissipitating white head. A mild aroma. Creamy mouthfeel though certainly not thick, satisfying. Sessionable alcohol appreciated, and adds to drinkability based on pleasant chocolate malts. Not too sweet, balanced. Good effort for not trying to be a coffee or imperial stout."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep back color stout with large light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light dry black bitter chocolate with some light coffee. Taste is an easy going mix between some light black bitter chocolate, some roasted malt and some very subtle coffee. Body is lacking some creamy texture with great carbonation. Not bad overall but lacking in character."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a small off-white head. Not much head retention or lacing. The aroma is very nice, it smells like roasted malt, dark fruit, caramel, dark chocolate, coffee, and a bit of smoke. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, caramel, burnt/charred malt and a bit of hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's velvety and coating, and has a dry finish. Drinkability is pretty good, it wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these especially with the 4.8% ABV. It's smooth and easy to drink, it's quite sessionable. I think this is a good example of an English Stout, I'd definitely buy this again in the future. Recommended."
"So far, touch wood, I am yet to have a bum beer from Hook Norton. Their Double Stout was a beer I had looked for in various off-licenses and shops in the Oxford area, all in vain. Opening the bottle was to get a burst of roasted coffee aroma, once poured the roasted nature of the nose was dominant, suggesting a full flavour to come. The beer itself was pitch black with a loose off-white head. Coffee was also the major flavour in the beer, although smoothed out by a velvety chocolate. Not overly bitter, full-bodied and beautifully smooth, this was lovely stuff."
"If you're a fan of the style, I don't think this beer will dissapoint. Other Stout styles appeal more to me but in a bar, especially on tap, I'd happily choose this."
"The aroma is very toasty with malt, coffee, chocolate, and cream. The appearance is dark brown with a very small head. The flavor is like the aroma but very dry. The palate is way too thin for a stout. Overall its a good tasting and smelling stout that is too thin."
"OVERALL: A very drinkable stout that is definitely a session beer. It was very enjoyable and definitely worth re-visiting. Would be interesting to find this on tap somewhere. One of the better English stouts I've had."
"A good offering - not sure why its called ""double stout"" though?"
"Black pour, a pretty thick head with a fair amount of lacing. Rich roasted flavors with slight chocolate and coffee. A little sticky in the mouth, but not in a bad way. Solid medium body. Very smooth and finishes pretty clean. Obviously with the abv, this is quite sessionable. A good English stout."
"Overall: Not overly impressed with this beer, but one I would enjoy again. Not a bad buy for 3 or 4 bucks. Cheers!"
"This was quite an enjoyable offering to reflect with quietly after a long week. Sessionable but brings some heft. Well done and extra-drinkable for style."
"D- Overall, this is a stout that could be a session beer. Not too strong, not too overpowering, and very easy to drink. It's definitely a beer that I will be buying again."
"D - This is a good stout. The low ABV makes it very easy to have a few and it is quite delicious, too."
"Hook Norton really let you down, this stout is no different, a good example of an English Stout."
"Wow, one of the best and biggest sub 5% stouts I have ever had. Full of dark chocolate notes and lots of big roasted malt flavours. Tastes like an Imperial Stout with all the complexity but very drinkable. Smooth and creamy but not a mindless quaff like some UK Stouts."
"The taste is chocolate, prunes, toast, with hint of licorice. It's fairly sweet and oily at first, before a lighter, more zesty, drier finish with a light bitterness added."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Nearly black color hints of mahogany highlights. Roasted coffee/chocolate nose. Good carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is baked chocolate with a hop bite at finish. $6.50 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"D: An enjoyable stout, the type I could enjoy a couple more of. ABV is low, flavor is high. Easy to drink, reasonably priced (I recall this being a good deal at PIB - though the name 'Double Stout' confused some into thinking this was a much 'bigger' beer than it really is.) As is, Double Stout is a winner and a brew I'll buy again."
"Smooth but still present carbonation. Very thick and delicious, a great session stout."
"Full flavored, easy drinking English stout. Anyone thinking it will be like an American double stout because of the beer's name will be sorely disappointed. However, if it's a standard English stout you crave - this will more than satisfy."
"A light brown colored beer that appears dark brown in the glass. The light tan colored head lasts around for quite a while and eventually fades into a ring. Really light aromas. It's a stretch to get much out of the nose at all, but it does have some coffee and roast. Flavor is missing a lot of depth and complexity. A touch of roast, but overall, it has very muted flavors and aromas."
"The mix between two different types of malts is an interesting experiment, and you can definitely taste the point where it changes from one type to another. Still, it doesn't completely work as a beer, and no matter how interesting it is, you still have to be able to drink it."
"Hook Norton is brewerery that I am really looking forward to getting alot of their wares the Hooky Bitter was good but this was a little flat in my opinion.Poured into a imperial nonic a dark cola color with a large blooming tan colored head,toasty aromas with a light bitter chocolate tone.Thin and almost fizzy mouthfeel the sharpness really never totally went away,flavors are mainly dark toast with a slight burnt flavor along with some passing bitter chocolate.A very average stout with a below average mouthfeel."
"drinkability is good. this is a smooth and mellow stout with decent proportioning and a smooth profile. the brew plays off subtleties to create a deceptively complex profile under a curiously simple backbone. not one of the best, but a nice example of the style."
"500ml brown bottle from Ron's Market in Farmington. Pours a black body with ruby-red highlights and a quarter to half inch of very light tan head. Smells roasty, with caramel, nut and butter notes all very present. Tastes like chocolate, butter, nut, caramel. Flavors are each subtle, but together make a pleasant and tasty brew. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. This one is an easy drinker for sure, despite the rich flavor and moderate mouth-feel. Not sure what makes this a 'double' stout, but it's a phenomenal English stout, possibly the best I have had."
"It has a nice medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is lightish. It finishes with a dark chocolate bitterness that doesn't go overboard. Nice. And so damn drinkable..hell....it's under 5%abv! Now, this is a sessionable Stout indeed! Too bad, yet again, that I only picked up one bottle but I hope to pick up more on my next visit. If they still have some. /me with my fingers crossed."
"16.9oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. The aroma is dark and slightly roasted malts with a good amount of chocolate and a touch of coffee. The taste is very smooth and creamy with a dark roastiness to start off and some slightly bitter coffee flavors coming along in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, Hook Norton Double Stout is a solid English style stout that is subtle but well crafted."
"The beer pours a black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has dry, earthy, patent and roasted malt aroma. The taste is great. It has a tremendous black, chocolate, and roasted malt flavor that goes down with some sweetness, but finishes dry with an aggressive earthiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. These guys have the English beer styles down to a science. This is so flavorful, yet low in alcohol and highly drinkable. Hooray to the session beer!"
"Drinkability: Basically, a light, though flavorful English stout made for easy drinking."
"This was a sleeper! This beer has excellent taste and aroma qualities, combined with its smooth finish, make this easy to drink."
"Finish is thin and somewhat watery."
"I loved this beer. Clean, crisp, satisfying. It just stunned me that it was only 4.8% ABV. A lesson for me really--I'm an intrepid lighter to darker, weaker to stronger session drinker, and this beer was so good with the meal I didn't need or want to continue with anything else. Stouts typically are dessert. This is an essential part of the meal. (steak and cheese, bread and chips and lettuce, if you must know.) I snuck a peek at their web site and gave them my rave directly. Goodness knows what they made of it--I e-mailed to Heritage at... No response yet."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Tasted on 1/28/08"
" Over all a great beer. I'm impressed with it's balance and subtleties; just what a good English stout should be."
"Nothing spectacular about this offering. Average."
"Wow, this was a pleasant surprise from Hook Norton with a good amount of flavor and body packed into a hugely sessionable low ABV package. This pint was literally gone in no time."
"D: A nice drink, but not really a session beer. Very disticnt taste, I'd couple it with pork or a stew."
"Dark. Brown. Of course. Vanilla and soggy roasted coffee flavored grains. Aromas. Scented. Olfactory. Chunky textured tannins. Zicky fizz, not exactly inegrated. Sweet fermented tangy coffee berries. Water flavors. Crudely shaped. But nicely contained in terms of power and thrust. Herbs and bloack berries on the finish."
"Drinkability: High! Recommended. Only problem is it's from Oxfordshire instead of Cambridgeshire :)"
"Deep, deep ruby color with a huge, somewhat cocoa looking head. Great looking beer. Somewhat licorice and burnt aroma. Nutty and roasted grain. Deep, roasted flavor. Great overall malty flavor-ever slight smokiness. Very nice grain taste. Just a hint of hop bitterness. Great body. Really holds up well at only 4.8%. Just a great, great package. The British can really do it best sometimes and they sure do it here."
"M&D: refreshingly carbonated, med-bodied, with everything in place w/o being too predominant to spoil the balance. Overall, I personally like this stout to bits, as it is such a beautifully balanced and delicious stout..."
"Smokey! Very smoky, almost burned malt flavor with coffee and burnt wood flavors. Very dark with a grayish tan head that doesn't last as long as it should. Not as dense as one would expect, but very stong. Hangover guaranteed. Bottle tasted only, smuggled to the US, still very nice carbonation."
"Drinkability - Its fairly low ABV and powerful dry roasted taste make this more drinkable than I initially thought after the first sip. However, there are better choices to drink all evening."
"Toasty fore with a grape-tinged fruitiness that reminds me of Samuel Smiths brews-ALL of Samuel Smiths brews. Thin for a stout...closer to a porter and color wise would be a porter in America or Denmark. Very soft feel...low carbonation. Estery, but not off-putting it just likes any sort of bitterness. Its toasty, but falls well short of roasted flavor wise. Its like they toasted the most sugary sweet malts they could find. Just a hint of bitterness in the finish could save this one, but it is not there."
"D- very moreish and lots of flavour for the abv. Lots of good roasted notes as expected with a delicate yet thick chocolate creaminess. a lovely stout. Would always pick this over a drier stout"
"Pours a black colour with a small tan head. Has a roasted fruity aroma, with some hints of chocolate. Malty roasted fruity flavor with hints of chocolate and coffee. Ends with a long roasted aftertaste. A good beer."
"The taste is burned - roasted, bitter and a bit sour. I found notes of black coffee and some cream; the body was surprisingly weak for a stout. The aftertaste is rather short with dry burned notes."
"Just a really good stout although its not top-notch."
"Hopefully one day you will be able to try them on Cask also."
"Fruity nose, rasins, figs, with some mollasses, light chocolate, licorice and roasty scents. The palate is first fruity (raisins,figs) and then leads into a chocolately, softly roasty, bitter finish, some tangy hops in the finish aswell, also found the beer to be a bit jammy. Nice long roasted finish, nice, light and very drinkable."
