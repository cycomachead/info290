No offence intended to the Guinness boys but this one has real flavour. The MF lets it down slightly  and the burnt nature of the malt profile overpowers some of the other flavours but having said that I do like it.","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Jan 15, 2015"

I thought it would have a slight astringency due to the brewery's home nation take on most beers, but this was smooth the whole way through. As a huge fan of viking/folk metal, this certainly caught my eyes at the local bottle shop. I am quite impressed with this offering by Orkney Brewery and plan on purchasing and reviewing more of their products in the near future.","Caveworm","Oct 20, 2014"

The nose is not much to write home about, a little chalky with a hint of white wine and some roasted malt notes, maybe even a hint of smoky bacon crisp flavouring. This has more bite than most English stouts, tasting quite acidic to start, turning slightly plummy with a pleasant smoky, woody and slightly spicy aftertaste. The more I drink the spicier and more tobacco infused it seems. It isn't bland which seems to be the pitfall of many lower abv stouts. It is on the somewhat carbonated rather than silky smooth side. Overall, this is good stuff which is just as well because I have a few more bottles of it.","charlatan","Apr 18, 2014"

Also, there's a little bit of citrusy hops noticable in the taste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium. It's a little bit slick, but it's also a little on the watery side.

Smell was muted coffee grounds, unsweetened bakers chocolate, and toasted malt. How many times have I used those words to describe a stout? Taste was a bit sweeter than I was expecting, which I liked, and the finish was pleasantly dry while at the same time flavourful, which I really enjoyed as well.

Underlying it is a nice bit of maltiness, no real sign of any hops, but they're not needed here. The feel is excellent for a Stout. I usually find Stouts a little watery, but his is just smooth with a nice dry finish that leaves a very pleasant smokey aftertaste. Almost like a good bowl of pipe tobaco, which would probably go well with this beer as well. I would have to say this is best Stout I have ever had.

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and creamy malt scent that boasts of crystal, chocolate, and roasted malts. It is quite sweet and chocolatey. The taste is good. It has an intensley rich black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes earthy and dry. It is full of malt complexity. It starts sweet and chocoalety, but finishes dry and rich in patent flavor. There are also some hops in the aftertaste as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking English stout. It is low in alcohol, but high in flavor.","WesWes","Mar 28, 2005"
4.17,8.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"On the waifish side through the mouth, with a mild but perky carbonation. Fattened a tad, this might congeal into something truly special. Even as is, this is drinkable in nothing less than gulps, and represents the Dry Stout style very well.","cokes","Mar 03, 2005"
3.61,-6.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Opaque brown, little light comes through, mousse-like dark tan head of good retention. Laces in thick smears. Aroma is sweet, light caramel with just a hint of a sparse roast. Mouthfeel is lightish, more carbonation than some. Starts slowly and agreeable, chocolatey with some oily bitterness, then the profile thins pretty dramatically, leaving a slightly unsatisfying impression. Finishes with the coffee and carbonation intact but without a lot of meat left to the mouthfeel or malt impact. Fairly drinkable, light in alcohol, too thin for my expectations.","ADR","Feb 24, 2005"
3.9,1.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This one's a keeper. Best for when you want something drier and dustier than stouts like Sam Smith but still with a cocoa kick.","horndecker","Feb 06, 2005"

4.17,8.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"No dating. Deep and dark, almost black.... can only see a twinge of ruby if you hold it to the light. Nice amount of head settled down to a thin khaki layer of creaminess that you can catch glimpes of dark through. Dark roasted malt scents, chocolate and sasafrass.... tobacco as it warms. I was surprised with the bitey carbination, but it still feels pretty good, just a bit shocking. Medium bodies. Nice roasty flavors with chocolate and coffee blended in. Goes down very smooth and easy, nicely drinkable.","shapudding","Jan 15, 2005"

3.6,-6.5,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"The fix is obvious. More malt would do wonders for Dragonhead Stout and would most likely elevate it to the ranks of the very good. As is, it's drinkable, but I can't stop myself from thinking 'what if... ' every time I upend the glass.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 02, 2004"
3.58,-7,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"This came in a 500ml bottle. Pours out a pitch-black body with a tall tan head. As it was consumed the head stuck around and left decent lacing. Aroma is of light chocolate with slight roasted malt undertones. Flavor is similar with a chocolate maltiness being dominate with notes of roasted malt and a bitter earthiness in the back. Mouthfeel is light for a stout but otherwise smooth. Good drinkability here, with the low ABV and its smoothness going down. Solid beer but nothing I would get excepting about.","meathookjones","Nov 30, 2004"
3.54,-8.1,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours out a deep, dark, completely opaque black color with a small almond colored head that quickly disappeared. Leaves a little lacing on the glass, but not much. The aroma has strong coffee notes as well as some expressions of chocolate and caramel. Overall a very pleasant smell. Taste is also strongly suggestive of coffee and sweet, dark malts. Slightly over carbonated and thusly a little thin for a stout. Mouthfeel suffers slightly, but not enough to make this one a loser. Overall, a very tasty brew that brings a slightly different interpretation of the stout style. Not the best on the shelf, but definitely worth a try.","niknar","Beers"

3.53,-8.3,4.5,4,3.5,3,3,"A deep black color with visible carbonation during the pour. The head is a light brown and rocky. Lacing is good n sticky. Aroma is like a chocolate mousse; chocolaty, and lightly alcoholic with some roasted notes. Flavor is surprisingly bitter in the middle (the start is quite undetectable) and lacking in a sweetening balance. Palate is light bodied and watery with a lingering bite. The flavor seems to improve over time, although it is still quite one-dimensional.","SeanChouffe","Oct 18, 2004"

2.22,-42.3,4,2,2,3,2,"I was very let down by this beer. Poured a beautiful rich black with a delayed mocha head. Aroma was smokey malt, and the smokeyness followed in the flavor as a monotone smoked malt. Not dry enough to be enjoyed as a dry Irish, and not rich enough for an English stout - simply lackluster and boring. I tried to find a freshness date to give this the benefit of the doubt, but found none. Orkney continues to underwhelm me, notwithstanding some nice looking bottles.","Brent","Mar 05, 2004"

It's appearance was really nice too. It was thick black with a frothy, pillowy head that lasted a little while. The smell was like a typical stout, deep, rich, roasted, and chocolatey. The big thing that seperated it from most stouts was the super chocolatey smell and taste. The taste was similar to the smell, but on a grander scale. It was very warming to drink and left me quenching for more. As far as drinkability, I could drink this great stuff all day at work and night at home. Then again, that could be a bad thing!","JISurfer","Oct 05, 2003"
3.82,-0.8,4,4.5,4,3,3,"Pours black, but reddish brown around the edges. The head is probably the darkest I've ever seen for such a weak stout. The brown foam on top of this is what you expect for a 6% or an imperial stout. Instead it's on top of a 4% stout. Quite impressive. I was expecting to be let down, but then I stuck my nose into the glass and the aroma is HUGE. Much fresh coffee aroma. It's kind of like sticking your nose into a bag of coffee. A little chocolate backing it up. The flavor is equally big. A bit sweet, a little smokey, but oh so good. It's a little rich to be a quick drink, but you enjoy every sip. I'm impressed that they packed so much flavor into such a relatively small beer. Kudos to Orkney.","aracauna","Oct 05, 2003"

3.3,-14.3,4,4,3,3,3,"Poured black as night, with a lovely one inch chocolate soda head, interesting initial nose, sort of mochaish, the first taste however followed up on none of that. thre was a lingering roasted taste that lingered till the end, but all in all it could be classified a light stout.","grynder33","May 03, 2003"
4.07,5.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Jet black beer with a frothy, tantilizing head. Aromas of chocolate, maple syrup, and dark (and sweetened) fruits. Taste starts light and creamy and moves to a quick roasted flavor -- almost smoky though not *actually* smoky. It's roasted in the way a marshmellow is roasted. Light coffee tones drop off to a strangely absent finish -- hard to describe, really -- where the flavor really disappears with little significant aftertaste. An easy drinking stout that loses its creaminess quickly -- so it's a bit thin in finish and in body. Nothing spectacular but definitely nice.","marburg","Apr 24, 2003"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"From NERAX 2003, this beer had a large following as was evidenced by the long lines formed in front of the tap. Roofing tar in color with a tint of brown when held to light. The rather large bubbles pop and fade quickly leaving a thin trace of lace. A faint aroma of molasses, malt and hops. Semi-dry. The lightly sweet malt balances well with tea-like and mild citrusy hops. Weak coffee and a trace of camphor are detected. A nice stout to swish around and gulp.","BeerResearcher","Apr 04, 2003"
4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Interesting. I get heavily toasted bread, dark fruit, maybe some toffee, and a molasses-like flavor that I can't quite put my finger on - I even had my wife (a non-beer-drinker) sniff it to see if she could place the aroma/taste, but she could'nt place it either. The brew has a seriously well-rounded maltiness. There is some roast coffee/chocolate flavor as well, but it hides behind the rounder, sweeter malt aspects until the brew warms a bit. Almost tastes like a cross between a milk stout and a dark mild. Decent chewiness for a 4% brew. One of the more interesting stouts I've tried recently - worth getting a few more bottles to figure it out some more.","sponberg","Feb 22, 2003"
4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a very dark amber, almost black color and formed a huge dark tan foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it very slowly subsided. Almost a float like appearance to it. An aroma of malt and burnt chocolate and coffee. A flavor of malt and coffee. A slightly burnt aspect to the finish, but not in a bad way, and a little lighter than I thought it would be.","Wildman","Jan 02, 2003"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"(No bottled on date) -- Appearance: Pours a opaque black in color, and the head is creamy, sticky, rocky and cardboard in color; good retention. Decent carbonation. On the nose there is a pleasant aroma of dark chocolate, roastiness, and toasted bread. The body is light and mouthfeel is creamy smooth. The flavors consist of rich dark chocolate, dry charcoal, roasted malts, hints of some fruit, slight bitterness, hints of toffee, and a lingering dry roastiness. I enjoyed this brew...a very tasty stout","WilliamPhilaPa","Sep 01, 2002"
3.71,-3.6,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Although this is brewed by the wonderful, small Orkney brewery, it pales in comparison to their other brews... although that is partly due to the style itself. The body is typically opaque black, and it's topped by a full and frothy dark tan head that soon drops to a thin surface covering. It does, however, leave some nice lace throughout the glass. The nose expresses some dull fruitiness and minor roastiness which is nice, although there seems to be some minor acetone/solvent-like character as well. The body is typically light with a very nicely creamy mouthfeel from a very fine and moderate carbonation that's intended to replicate their cask-conditioned version. The flavor, again, expresses the typical characteristics of a dry Irish stout with a gently fruity (apple), lightly tangy (low pH) and smoothly roasty malt that's well backed by firm bitterness. It finishes quite dry with a light touch of tart fruitiness and a lingering roastiness. A very straight-forward rendition that's much better direct from the cask than in the bottle.","NeroFiddled","Beers"
4.43,15.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Chocolate, burnt coffee, nuts and dry fruits. Full and round body. iIf you consider the low alcoholic level (4 ABV), this beer has a perfect body, a complet mouthfeel with a freshing flavour. Herbal notes.
