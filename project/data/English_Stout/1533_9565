The mouthfeel on this one hits you before the taste--too much carbonation. It takes a while to settle down, but when it does, what emerges is an especially dry stout flavor with winy, port-like topnotes.

2.34,-35.2,4.5,3,2,1.5,2,"D: I bought this beer on the assumption that it would create an interesting marriage between beer and port wine, but it turned out just to be a mediocre stout. I would say to the creators that they should use more port, try a different blend, I assumed this beer would be around 8-9% before I looked at the bottle, but at 4.5% the port would have to be very understated, as port is like 17-19% alcohol, fortified with brandy. I'll finish the bottle, for sure, but I won't buy again.","Halcyondays","Dec 25, 2007"
3.81,5.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Very easy to drink and not bad as a stout, but more port character would have been welcomed, as would a touch more smokiness to give it more of an English Stout character.

Taste is a very smooth, restrained, espresso-like bitterness, with very little else. Not sure where the port went, but this is a nice, calm, enjoyable stout. Not one I'd wrestle an alligator for, but certainly more flavorful than many other low-alcohol stouts. Probably wonderful with oysters and lighter desserts.","trill","Dec 11, 2007"

The idea of adding port to stout is appealing because, if done right, the resulting beer could be both interesting and good. If done wrong, as here, the result is a chore to finish.

4.53,25.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Pours black, with a tenacious, soft light brown head and the faintest of deep ruby highlights when held up to direct light. The nose is subdued -- some roasted malts, baker's chocolate, burnt caramel, and just a tinge of fruits. The ruby port added to this beer is not forward in the nose. On the palate, the key word for this beer is smooth. Mildly bitter malts first off, then the port character comes through, as cherry flavors show up for the mid-palate. The end comes with mild bitter chocolate and an increasingly dry, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated (although this beer has a beautiful head) and highly smooth. Overall, this is a fantastic stout. Seamless and deep, with the perfect amount of fruit notes blended in, this is a great example of what wonderful flavors can be achieved at a relatively low ABV.","geexploitation","0"

3.75,3.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"When I came across this beer at the store it caught my attention and peaked my interest. Combining port wine with stout? Like a cross between a barley wine and a stout? They are two of my favorites. When I poured the beer it was a very dark brown with a high frothy head. It settled to the creamy head seen on many stouts. Upon taking a whif I immediately noticed the fruity wine in it with some deep malty aromas in the background. The taste was different, good, but not robust and stouty enough. There was the hint of a barley wine taste at the beginning with a clean dark roasted malt finish. Carbonation was a bit high at first taste but flatten out towards the bottom. Overall I liked this beer, something different, smooth drinking, and would have it again, but it was a little weak for a stout and could use a little more kick.","mcmidc","May 09, 2007"

A bit of roasted malt peeks through, but that's it. Really fruity and sweet.

It is bottle conditioned. I got a whiff of ruby port when I opened the bottle, but the beer itself doesn't have much aroma. I can taste the ruby port immediately in the flavor, it is fairly mild though. That being said, I don't really taste much else, maybe some roasted malts lingering in the background. Really disappointing. I really wanted to like this one. Your money is better spent elsewhere.","Drew966","Apr 03, 2006"

Aroma of sweet eating apples and a touch of sherry-like depth. Mouthfeel is lightish medium, carbonation is bright, apparent, and speckly all the way through to the close. Flavor is a unique combination of very noticeable fruit (again, the apple) and a counterpoint of bitter roasted malt with a coffee quality. Aftertaste is diminished in the main structural qualities but the port seems pretty evident late, similar to sweet fermented strawberries.

4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Definitely, a nice change of pace for a stout. The addition of port wine imparts a smoothness that aids drinkability and rounds off any hint of sharp, burnt dark maltiness.

It pours to a brown color with a burgundy tint to it and has a very foamy head that breaks down slowly leaving a fair amount of lacing. The aroma seems to be somewhat week but what I am able to pick up seems pleasant, roasted malt tones with a obvious hint of port that leaves thoughts of fruit. The taste was not overly that inspiring. Seems somewhat week but you are able to notice the roasted flavors, wine type flavor and dark type fruit. This brew finishes dry with a cocoa essence. This brew is ok, not what I was hoping for but it was worth the try. Not sure I would get this one again though.","Stimack","Dec 07, 2004"

Roasted malts and light essence of woody, port wine with a touch of fruitiness round out the nose. Port wine infusion is sharp in the taste, with a nice malty backbone beneath. Light chocolate and caramel notes in the malt. Hopping level is low, but acceptable because the port provides a nice twang that the hops would otherwise give. A rather unique beer that's low in alcohol and huge in flavor. Very enjoyable.","crookedhalo","Dec 04, 2004"

Picked up a bit as it warmed, but not a lot in this department. Flavor makes up for any shortcomings. Heavily roasted, but no scorched grain flavors. Malt was nice and bright, particulary since my bottle was a bit past the best-by date. Some light chocolate notes and a touch of coffee ground bitterness. Very low level of hopping - the roasted malts supply all the bittering you could ask for. A little bit of oak tannic astringency.

3.91,8.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Purchased at a Lee's Discount Liquors in Vegas. Best before on the bottle says Jan. 17th 2004, a good 9 months ago. Pours out a deep black with a mahogany nimbus along the bottom of the glass. Massive spongy beige head that leaves thick rings of lacing in its wake. Upon settling there is still an impressive cap on the body, nice retention. The aroma contains buried roasted malts amongst more elevated characteristics of sweet cherry fruit and port. The core of the flavour is a dry Irish stout, permeated by a welcome cherry/grape sweetness in the middle, along with a vinuous port finish. The mouthfeel is creamy, with a drying aftertaste of roasted malt that follows the light acidic port finish. A successful experiment on the part of O'Hanlon's, definitely an interesting combination. Not my idea of a session stout, but I'd definitely buy more of it.","IronDjinn","Jul 14, 2004"

4.08,13,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This bottle-conditioned stout pours the expected opaque-black body with glints of mahogany at the base of the glass and ruby highlights along the edges when held to the light. Even carefully poured, the head rises up causing you to pause a moment. But that's OK as it needs to sit and warm a little anyway. And in that time the frothy, light tan head will settle into a creamy, merangue-like cap that adds even more to its appearance. The retention is astounding, and it initially leaves wide sheets of creamy froth about the glass. The addition of a small amount of port is obvious in the nose with a combination of fruit and wine that's balanced by a dull roastiness similar to that of spent espresso grounds. The body is light/medium; and its fine, natural carbonation delicately caresses the tongue before leaving it smooth and creamy across the palate. The flavor is rich with wine and ripe dark fruit (plum, black cherry, black grape) up front, followed by dark bread, molasses and a whisp of cocoa across the middle. It finishes dry and roasty with a passing note of nutty, caramelish malt and a lingering winey note that fades as its bold bitterness rises. It's quite interesting and enjoyable when enjoyed slowly at cellar temperatures. But, as the label suggests in its reference to its being based on a "corpse-reviver" (hair of the dog), it makes a better first beer (of the morning or night) than it does a session beer.","NeroFiddled","Mar 05, 2004"

3.74,3.6,5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Drinkability - well, it's low octane enough and certainly tasty, but I would rather have a little heavier beverage in the stout class. Odd, I would drink more of a heavier drink? Actually yes, I'm a glutton that way. I won't ding it excessively though, this is an all-around tasty and somewhat unique beer, I may have it again.","brewdlyhooked13","Feb 10, 2004"
3.95,9.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick tan head. I don't see any ruby color here, but the appearance is still good. The aroma is good. It has good malt character. There are crystal, roasted, and black malts here. The taste is good. It is rich with roasted malts. It has a dry finish, but satisfies. It says it's enriched with ruby port wine, but I can't make out the distinction. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a fine stout. It drinks well and has good dark roasted flavor.","WesWes","Feb 02, 2004"
3.65,1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Dark brown body isn't quite black. Sandy head lingers for a while, but eventually fade completely. Sweet chocolate covered cherry aroma, but faint. The flavor is dry up front, a little roast, a little wood. In the end there's this little bubble of grapes. It's fleeting and not strong, but there and it adds a little interest to what would otherwise be a boring stout. There can't be a lot of port in here. The mouthfeel is soft and airy.","aracauna","Jan 16, 2004"
3.68,1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a ruby color with a moderate sized head. The smell is very roasty and maybe some alcohol sweetness. The first flavor is a chocolate/coffee mixture then that leaves and raisins become present. Slight underlying bitterness and and base roasted barley taste. Alcohol is present and actually does bring a port-like flavor to the end of the beer. The flavor are smooth but nothing really stands out to make this a great beer. Just a solid beer with a slightly unique flavor to it.","granger10","Jan 10, 2004"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a reddish brown with a long lasting tan head,a semi sweet stout with a little bit of roasted malt bite, overall a good beer. Nothing that blew me away, but there is nothing bad that I can say about it. Good price, good beer. I'd recommend to anybody who likes stouts.","jtw5877","Jan 09, 2004"
3.56,-1.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,""Ruby Stout", presumably because it is brewed with port wine. It's a very pretty beer...creamy, thick, and very long-lived tan head. Dark, almost completely black liquid. The aroma is pretty much one dimensional roasted grains....but it's an enticing, solid smell, none-the-less. Soft, with medium body. Slightly winey underneath. I expected sweetness when reading about the port...I wouldn't call it dry, but is certainly isn't that sweet. Hoppy finish. Tasty and enjoyable, but not outstanding...it didn't do anything special for me.","Suds","Nov 29, 2003"
3.63,0.6,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"NB: I sampled this beer about 2 days after it’s “best-buy” date, but the carbonation was extremely lively, and I don’t feel that it suffered much from age. If anything, some more might have been helpful.","Dantes","Jun 19, 2003"
3.7,2.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Medium gold color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and piney. Dark black color. Large creamy head. Aroma is port wine, roasted malts and cherries and chocolate. A light to medium bodied stout. Malts are chocolate at first, and then give way to a port wine sweetness. Nicely balanced. Nice interplay between sweet and bitter. Very smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.medium to lighter bodied American Pale Ale. Malts are fruity and only slightly sweet. Hops are grapefruity and piney. Its over balanced towards the hops and they tend to drown out the malt sweetness, but not overpowering enough to be annoying. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean but a bit thin at the finish. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Jun 18, 2003"
4.1,13.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I loved this beer beer it had a nice roasted nutty flavour that was also very chocolaty. A nice smooth finish with a slight hint of port. This I feel is a real winner and very drinkable. I had it with cheese and fruit and it went down very easily.","importguy","Jun 13, 2003"
3.05,-15.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Dark Coca-Cola look to it because of large bubble nucleating on the bottom. Fine head that stayed and stuck of some time, but after about a minute or so it deflated like a soufflé when the oven door is opened. Soft toasty nose mingled with rich milk chocolate. Tasted like a pretty standard stout of porter with plenty of roastiness and mellow charcoal. No port flavors are real obvious, but some wine-like tartness comes out when it warms. Maybe it was my imagination, but every now and then I thought I picked up on something that could have been port. In any case, it was good, but nothing Id get again. I guess I was drawn in because of my love of port and was left disappointed.","yen157","May 21, 2003"
2.9,-19.7,3,3,3,2,3,"In keeping with the name, far more ruby in the black/ruby color scheme than more traditional stouts. Aroma and taste both feature coffee and chocolate, with the nose adding wine and smoke. Far thinner than I expected, a slight watery quality. Easy to drink. Outside of a hint in the aroma I did not detect a strong port wine influence. Too thin, too blah. Not bad, but I'll not be returning to it at $4.00/bottle.","RonfromJersey","Beers"
3.68,1.9,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a very dark ruby red color and formed a nice medium tan foamy head that laticed the glass with lace as it subsided. Some carbonation was present. The aroma was of malt and wine with some chocolate elements. The flavor was of malt and some wine was present, with a fairly light body for this style and some bitterness in the finish. Not a bad stout, but then again, nothing special about it either.","Wildman","0"
