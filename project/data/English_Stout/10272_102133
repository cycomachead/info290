3.33,-10.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,"O: So-so. A decent enough beer on it's own terms, but doesn't really fulfill expectations for a bourbon stout. Looks OK, while the aroma and flavour are quite sweet and boozy with hints of brown sugar, dried fruit, stewed leaves and woodiness. Lacklustre body - too thin. The malt character isn't beefy enough to match the aging and doesn't provide sufficient balance. The result is slightly cloying; a sort of 'light' bourbon stout. Drinkable but not memorable - no need to hunt this one down.","jazzyjeff13","Feb 10, 2015"

4.25,14.2,4,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Innis & Gunn Bourbon Aged Stout’s flavor immediately leans sweet, channeling dates, caramel, toffee, and touches of chocolate.  There are boozy touches of cooked fruit and alcohol soaked oak barrels.  The mouthfeel ends up being thick between the sugary nature and the high booze.  The elements of bourbon tend to take over toward the end, giving off burnt chocolate, caramelized sugars, and the flavor of preserved fruit.  The finish goes on for some time moving closer to bourbon as it goes.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Feb 03, 2015"

3.48,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought this was a nice example of Bourbon Red Stout, I don't think I've ever had a red stout before, so I can't be too sure about this, but as far as I can tell it lived up to it's description and it felt like it was somewhere between a amber ale and stout.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, slightly cloying, a little sticky, not too filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, one full bottle might be just a little too much for because of the sweetness.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, it was a good looking beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the drinkability, I just think the sweetness would really start to wear on me after awhile.  I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was nice to try, but I don't really have the urge to revisit it anytime soon.  I would recommend it if you like malty English ales and bourbon aspects in your beer, but I wouldn't recommend it as a good beer.  This isn't my  favorite beer from this brewery it falls about right in the middle and the same goes for the style.  All in all I didn't mind this beer and it had some good aspect to it, but it also had some aspects that I hurt and I feel like I could go either way with this beer.  I appreciate the effort it took take make this beer and I hope to see more unique beers from this brewery in the future, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Oct 05, 2014"

3.79,1.9,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"1 pint, 4.3 ounce bottle.  Bottom of the box the beer came in says best before June 2015.  Not sure if this is any different than their regular bourbon stout, but the box says this is a ""Limited Edition"" beer that comes from a select batch of only 220 barrels.  Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear dark ruby red/brown color with about an inch and a half tan head.  Head retention is good, and there's also a decent amount of lacing.  The aroma is mostly sweet, it smells like roasted malt, nuts, caramel, and some dried/candied fruit.  It tastes like roasted malt, nuts, dark fruit, cola, and also has an herbal/mineral flavor to it.  I don't really pick up much of if any bourbon at all.  I know it's weird to say, but it tastes like an Innis & Gunn beer.  There's just something about the beers I've tried from them that have a similar taste, but whatever it is, I like it.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with a good amount of carbonation.  It's also smooth and easy to drink.  I liked this brew, but maybe they should have aged this over the bourbon oak chips longer.  $7.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Sep 25, 2014"

Aromas of dark bread, roasted malt, caramel, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, oak, clove, light vanilla, herbal, and toast/oak earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and oak barrel notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, dark bread, roasted malt, caramel, toast, brown sugar, toffee, light coffee, raisin, plum, vanilla, clove, oak, herbal, and toast/oak earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark bread, chocolate, cocoa, roast, caramel, toast, brown sugar, toffee, raisin, plum, vanilla, oak, clove, herbal, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and moderate yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good English stout style. Good robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, oak barrel, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on.

4.25,14.2,3.75,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"With a lovely fullish, viscous yet vanishing texture, the beer overall caught me off-guard with just how moreish and enjoyable it was. In hindsight, I can say I am relieved that this wasn't a bourbon-bomb - not even close. This is yet another satisfying, uniquely distinctive ale from Innis & Gunn and, after sampling this entire set, I am sold on trying more of their products. Their beers have a refined, characteristic British taste to them - which is right up my alley.","Bouleboubier","Jan 03, 2014"

4,7.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"O- Everything about this beer is mediocre, except the taste, which is what truly matters. You need to put aside your american stout expectations when tackling this one, as it's much more of a stout/scotch ale hybrid. When it comes down to it, it's downright delicious.","JWU","Dec 13, 2013"

4.05,8.9,4,4.5,3.75,4.25,4," I'm amazed at how long the mouth feel stays solid with a malt-heavy and aged stout, making this easy to drink for the duration of the session.","GratefulBeerGuy","Dec 08, 2013"
3.63,-2.4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Another new one for me and pours a very dark cherry cola hue with a creamy two finger head and some nice lacing,the smell is sweet bourbon,oak and glazed fruit,the mouthfeel is just medium bodied and moderately carbonated with tastes of predominantly bourbon and coke,the slightest edge of oak,biscuity malts and is finished with a very light hop bitterness and overall it's and drinkable where the bourbon oak is dominant but easily mingles with the base beer and yeah I'd drink it again cheers.","ADZA","Dec 05, 2013"

3.97,6.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly and leaves no lace. Deep opaque amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Bourbon nose and flavor is bourbon and vanilla, hints of caramel. 330ml clear bottle part of 4-pak (glass is included that just holds 330ml) $5.99 from Market Basket Concord, NH.","jdhilt","Nov 16, 2013"
3.02,-18.8,3.25,3,3,3,3,"Pours a dark brown with garnet highlights at the edges and a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of caramel and brown sugar with some dark dried fruit and a bit of oak tannin, light vanilla, and a hint of alcohol. This says its a stout, where is the roast, coffee, and or chocolate? The flavor is quite sweet with dark sugary malt, toffee, dark fruit, light oak and vanilla sweetness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Stout huh? not by a long shot! Still an overly sweet Scottish ale that maybe they but a hint more color into. Again there is nothing flawed about the beer other than its boring and not to style.","johnnnniee","Nov 09, 2013"

3.53,-5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Like the rest of I & G's offerings, this has 'gateway' beer written all over it. While there is a lot of flavour, everything comes back to that malt sweetness, which I am long past being an apologist for. I thought that the use of American oak (in whatever respect) would lend this the air of an American stout. Nope, still English, the hops surprisingly taking care of that. A bit more complex than I was expecting, but that's about it.","biboergosum","0"
