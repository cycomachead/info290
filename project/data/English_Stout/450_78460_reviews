"Bought from the brewery right before Xmas, opened on St. Patty's Day 2015. Needed my stout fix do what the heck. Already had my corned beef and cabbage. Pours dark with nice soapy, large off white head. Smells of chocolate, some coffee espresso, and a touch of vanilla. A bit of burnt roast malt character. Tastes like a chocolate milkshake. Nice & lushy, foamy full mouthfeel. A tad sweet but okay given the chocolate character. No hops in nose or aroma, and that's fine. I don't want any hops in this kind of beer. Just enough bitterness though so it's not cloying. Overall, a fantastic beer that was fresh from the brewery and kept cold in the fridge since then. A very well made beer."

"Very good not overly chocolate flavored."

"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass a dark almost black color. Nice lacing and a head that lasted a little then fades to a thin film.  Nice malt and chocolate flavors. Having on a cold snowy day and it hit the spot."
""
"Very good beer all around!"
"Lots of notes of dark bitter chocolate.  A very nice stout and a lot of flavor for 6.9% stout."
""
"This is certainly love stout to the next level. A bit sweeter but smoother and pretty robust."

"The chocolate really ends a nice element to this beer.  Also, I aged this for just over a year, and I think that smoothed thing out a bit.  Certainly wouldn't call this a blockbuster, but the chocolate works well with the vanilla and light espresso.   Mouthfeel is soft, smooth and long, and drinkability is terrific. The beer is just a bit thin on the palate, but I thought that was OK, for style and for a non BA stout.  Really a very enjoyable, easy drinking stout."

"Pours a dark brown color with a slight off white head. Plenty of lace is left on the glass. Aroma of dark malts, coffee, dark bread, char. In the taste, cocoa and malt, agreeable flavor, but certainly not overly chocolatey. Mild earthy hops that bitter the beer nicely and add a slight acidity that pairs well with the chocolate. Light to medium bodied brew with a solid carbonation and cocoa in the finish. Overall, a nice, well rounded chocolate stout that is not overdone. Not extreme, but extremely drinkable."

"Overall, not worth 8.99 a bottle, enjoyable drinking stout but nothing more nothing less."

"Overall: This is an outstanding beer. It is not a big ABV at 6.9% but the overall outstanding qualities make up for it."

"Excellent three finger head. Opaque dark color. Chocolate malts and vanilla bean on the palate. Creamy and smooth. The body is a bit thin, but consistent. Nutty, malty, finish. Caramel and slight hoppieness. Great lacing down the beer. Easy to drink and satifying with a bit of late cherry tartness. Great for cool weather sipping. Yard's is a good brewery and they stack up well with the many, great Pennsylvania brewing companies."

"O- It's OK, I was expecting more."

"Overall â€“ A tasty vanilla laden chocolate brew. A rather nice drinker and certainly worth a try if you get a chance."
"Tasty and nearly fulfilling. I give props."
""
""
"Overall, good sweet chocolate stout, enough chocolate to be noticed but not take center stage. Roasted grains balance out the chocolate"
"Overall, a very nice dryer sweet stout - starts sweet then dries out with the attenuation and bittering hops."

"This offering ends with an odd sour note. This is really not that good of an effort."

"O- great stout....well done."
"O- an above average chocolate stout but lacking in any of the depth you'd expect from a stout"

"The beer poured dark into a pint glass. Almost completely opaque. A good bit of foam, which was a lighter color than I expected. I couldn't smell anything. There was something there, but it was too faint for me to smell. The taste was good. Strong chocolate. Maybe too strong for some palates, but great for mine. Some cherry notes, a little roasted malt. No alcohol warmth, which for a 6.9% beer is good. I would have preferred a little more malt and roastiness to go with the strong chocolate taste, but since I like chocolate I happily drank the beer. It also had a creamy consistency which was pleasant."

"D - An exceptionally drinkable English Stout... I'm a big fan of Yards and this offing only furthers my adoration... Solidly above average in all facets and teetering on exceptional in terms of aroma and flavor... The 6.9% ABV makes this one an easier drinker by stout standards and is something I would indulge in regularly if it came in 12oz bottles instead of bombers... Regardless, do yourself a favor and pick a bottle up next time you see it, you won't regret it..."

"D: This was a decent chocolate stout. The scent and taste were basic but good. The body was weak, but the finish was smooth, so it was really easy to drink. Not for aging, more likely for chugging. Meh."
""
""
""

"Overall: I am very happy I finally decided to buy this one! A great beer that is hurt a little bit by a weak mouthfeel and perhaps a bit too much bitterness, but overall one that I would easily enjoy again in the future."

"OV: A decent Stout, but not as good as I was expecting. It needs a fuller richer body and a note of coffee/espresso in the flavour to add some complexity and depth and round it out more. I know it's a chocolate Stout and there's loads of chocolate flavour in this, but for me it just needed another dimension to earn a high rating."
"o - delicious, easy drinking stout with some complexity and depth. I expected more body from this beer, however. Additionally, the flavors weren't very rounded. Sweet on the front, roastiness in the back. Nonetheless, a very enjoyable beer."
"O: It's not the most complex stout by any stretch. However, the way it delicately balances drinkability with a rich chocolate flavor just impresses the hell out of me. I could easily crush a 750 of this and not grow tired of it."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this stout because it had tons of chocolate flavors but was easy to drink because it wasn't that heavily-bodied."
""
" The taste is great, lots of roasted stout flavor with yeast taste that has a light mineral and dried fruit element with a cocoa taste that is slightly bittersweet with some toasted malt flavor balancing with light spice and astringency of dark grain. The overall flavor is excellent and this is a nice take on the style. I would probably drink this anytime it is avaiable as it is pretty darn drinkable."

"Utterly black stout...light tan head. The smell is of roasted coffee and ain't licorice. Rotated grains. The taste is moderately sweet...dark fruit, almost wine like at times. Medium-light in body. Dark and rich in flavor. Some spicy hop flavor in the hind-taste. Lightly warming. This is a welcomed, straightforward beer."

"O - Chocolate flavors nicely integrated into the standard Love Stout without being dominant."
""
"This is a simple chocolate stout. A nice integration of flavors. Well made all around."

"wow big dissappiont here hardley can taste the vanilla yes the beer goes down smooth but i cant even taste chocolate in it maybe its a bad bottle but this is a waste of time , yes a very dark in the glass but thats it nothing more more on and keep looking because this one is just flat"

"O- Another solid beer from Yards and I can't wait to pick up more. Great balance and mouthfeel. Very easy to drink."

"good staying power that left sticky lacings on the glass. Powdery dark chocolate aroma is dominant with sweet roasted malt and vanilla notes in the background. Medium bodied with a thin start that quickly comes alive with dense, rich carbonation. Similar to the aroma, dry dark cocolate flavor up front with roasted malt beneath. Light hop bitterness through the middle that rides a smooth vanilla wave. Finishes semi-dry with a semi-sweet chocolately finish."

"Pours a deep, dark brown, moderate cap of tannish tinted froth. Scent brings notes of dark roasted grain and ash, light notes of cocoa and brine. Taste follow suit, dry and ashy on the palate, heavy roast and powdery, dark dry cocoa. Medium to full bodied, dry. Overall, decent flavor profile, but not to heavily chocolate flavored enough to overcome the roast."
""

"Basically this is Yards' Love Stout aged on cocoa nibs. So all the goodness, plus a little extra chocolate. Poured opaque black with a thick creamy light tan head exhibiting excellent lacing and retention. Aroma was roasty with dark malts and coffee, with notes of cocoa. More of those characteristics in the taste; the regular version of this beer already has a nice chocolate profile, and the added aging augmented that a bit, but it wasn't overdone. The base is an oyster stout, so some hints of brine can be picked up, but the other flavors at work kind of push that into the background. Smooth and creamy, medium bodied, and quite a nice drink overall."
