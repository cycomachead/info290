4.25,17.1,,,,,,"Pours a solid pitch black in color with a good 1/2 finger creamy off-white head that actually lasts the whole drink. Pours like a Guinness, in layers from the nitro cap that is in the bottom of the can (does not move around though). A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted malts and black coffee. Bit more going on with the taste with a hint of dark chocolate in the mix as well. Finished with the roasted malts BUT isn't strong nor harsh at all. Very smooth finish actually as I wasn't sure of how this brew would end up. Lighter+ bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, I really liked this brew.","BeerWithMike","Oct 16, 2014"

It has a nicely balanced flavour, and anyone who has had a nitro beer before will already know if they'll like the smooth mouthfeel of this one (or not). This sells for slightly less than a 4-pack of Guinness (in this market), and I'd certainly recommend it to any fans of that brew seeking out something similar.","thehyperduck","Aug 14, 2014"

Nice balance of sweet & bitter. No hint of the contemporary adds of vanilla/coffee/chocolate, etc. Listings show conflicting ABV but this tastes shy so I'll assume it's @ 4.5%.

Regarding taste it is much the same as similar products from Guinness and Murphy's, typical good quality Irish style dry stout that just taste wonderful from start to finish. Everytime I open one I say to myself on the last drink, "Damn I'm gonna miss this brew." It may be my imagination but I think Belhaven Black pours with more action and the head and lacing holds up till the last drop.","lechap","Feb 24, 2014"
