4.09,2.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Excellent - superb flavour and character. An avalanche of roasted malt with significant chocolate and coffee notes. Nice mouthfeel; the only minor let down is the body, which could be fuller. Can't say I really distinguish the coriander or orange under all that malt, but it doesn't detract from the experience. For a stout that is just under 5% ABV, this may well be peerless. A must-try beer if you have the chance.","jazzyjeff13","Dec 02, 2011"

4.5,13.1,4,4,5,4,4.5,"Overall, this is one of the most delicious beers I've had. It's brewed like a stout, with chocolate malt and roasted barley, but also has wheat, coriander and orange zest. It's an interesting combination between two styles.","maxk","Nov 16, 2011"

3.92,-1.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"o: This was a strange one. I've never tried a Scottish ale with such a strong, roasty charcoal presence. I liked though and I'm very glad I got to try sometrhine so unique.","DIM","Beers"
4.17,4.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"O: Certainly one of the better cask beers I've come across. Wonderfully drinkable; creamy and downable. Definitely recommended.","AgentMunky","0"
