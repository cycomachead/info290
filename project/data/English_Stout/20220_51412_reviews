"OVERALL: Nothing special. The aroma was especially weak, unfortunately. The flavor picked up the slack a little, though even there it was unmemorable. Nothing wrong with this one per se, just nothing all that right about it either. Pass and try something else."

"Would drink again."

"Won't blow you away, but competently made, worth a try."

"O - A tasty stout, though nothing mind blowing. Easily sessioned and a welcome addition to the local LCBO selection. I'll definitely drink a few of these over the holidays."
"Taste is dark sweetness to start, some oatmeal in the middle, and a slight tartness to the close. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, and smooth in a flat beer way, and drinkability is okay, in the it goes down easy, but again, not in an impressive manner. This is not all it was cracked up to be."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
""
"M- Lighter end of medium bodied. Lingering finish."
""
"This is definitely worth a try, but given the price and relative heft-of-body, probably isn't a great session choice for most people. As far as OCB stouts go, this is a very respectable choice that I will probably imbibe again some time."

"D - Fairly easy drinking if you like a dark beer. Dark and toasty but clean."
""
"O/D - Not bad. Smells better than it tastes but it's drinkable and better than expected. Not worth the $3.50 it cost. Just kinda plain."
""
"O - A very pleasant surprise."

"Definitely the best offering I have sampled from this brewer."
"Bottle: Poured a black color stout with a large brown foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Notes of light roasted malt with light black chocolate are nice. Taste is a balanced mix between some roasted malt with light black chocolate notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well brewed with good drinkability factor though doesn’t provide anything I haven’t seen before."

"Sufficiently complex yet easy to drink. A beer I will enjoy again this winter!"
"Pours deep brown with one finger of tan head and a little lace. Smell is roasted malt, fairly hoppy, coffee and chocolate, light ashy scents as well. Taste is of roasted and almost burnt malt, bittersweet with light sour notes, coffee in the finish, quite dry. Medium carbonation, silky feel, creamy, medium body. This wasn't bad, fairly good drinker and a solid effort."
"Overall – Perhaps just a tad too much on the sweet side. I enjoyed it but I really couldn't drink more that 1 in a sitting. For my money, there are better options out there."
"Very nice effort, though a bit heavy to consider having more than one or two of. Will pick up again if it continues to be bottled and I'd like to see more from this brewery."
"Overall, never tasted a stout like this before. Seems unbalanced, almond is overbearing, too nutty and unsmooth."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black with some clarity around the edges of a deep amber/mahogany hue. Light brown head with some retention and a little lace. Nose of dark chocolate, roasty coffee grain notes, and some bready/cracker qualities, almost resembling that of a chocolate wafer. Taste has more of these bready and chocolate wafer-like notes, toasty malts, milk chocolate with some roasty coffee notes again. Dry and toasty finish. Not sure if I'm actively picking up any wheat notes, so if they are there, they are quite subtle. Some characteristic Black Creek hop flavour as well, in true English style. Medium carbonation with a touch of grittiness in the mouthfeel, medium body with moderate drinkability. A nice dry stout, and one of the better examples I've had in the province. And certainly the best thing Black Creek has done."
"As it often goes for things like song melodies or baking recipes, sometimes the simplest beer is the best. There's no bells or whistles to Black Creek Stout but it can be every bit as enjoyable - albeit in a much different way - as anything aged in bourbon barrels. For some this might be a bit lacking, but for the average drinker it should suit them just fine."
"Cask enjoyed at the brewpub. The porter stopped up , this newly labelled. A significant woodiness, I believe purposfully done, that adds to interest.A wee roast in aroma. Virtually no head, mildly natural carbonation. Dark colour. Chocolate malt, a bit on the sweet side, drier in the finish."
