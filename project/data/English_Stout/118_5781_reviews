"Overll - this is a good stout with decent flavour and a great look and smell. Drink this beside a Guinness man and feel like a man next to the goon beside you. No offence intended to the Guinness boys but this one has real flavour. The MF lets it down slightly  and the burnt nature of the malt profile overpowers some of the other flavours but having said that I do like it."

"Overall this is good but not great. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Serving type: bottle."

"  Overall, I'll give Dragonhead Stout - Orkney Brewery a  4.75. I thought it would have a slight astringency due to the brewery's home nation take on most beers, but this was smooth the whole way through. As a huge fan of viking/folk metal, this certainly caught my eyes at the local bottle shop. I am quite impressed with this offering by Orkney Brewery and plan on purchasing and reviewing more of their products in the near future."

"From bottle with freshness date in 2015. Pours a very dark peaty colour, almost black, with a head so offwhite I might call it beige. The nose is not much to write home about, a little chalky with a hint of white wine and some roasted malt notes, maybe even a hint of smoky bacon crisp flavouring. This has more bite than most English stouts, tasting quite acidic to start, turning slightly plummy with a pleasant smoky, woody and slightly spicy aftertaste. The more I drink the spicier and more tobacco infused it seems. It isn't bland which seems to be the pitfall of many lower abv stouts. It is on the somewhat carbonated rather than silky smooth side. Overall, this is good stuff which is just as well because I have a few more bottles of it."

"This would be an easy drinking stout at 4% if the bitter chocolate taste were less prominent and the price point lower ($5.99/500 mL). However, this meets the criteria for a stout well and must be judged accordingly."

"O: A briny mineral tastes starts to creep up as you drink through the pint, but it plays well off of the acrid malt flavors. A solid pint from beginning to end."
""
""
"Taste wise it followed the smells: this is a rich, smooth Stout with a fair amount of sweetness running through it. The dry finish compliments the nutty hints within the coffee and chocolate flavours to give you a reminder that the brewer hasn't forgotten to add some hops into his kettle."
"The taste has a good ""hang around the bonfire"" burnt malt flavor going on with light bitterness coming up on the backside. Quite easy to drink and a very nice beer that I would have again."

"overall . . . . I rate anything that gets me buzzed and doesn't taste like NIGHTTRAIN over a 4. I like beer. most beer. this is beer. but it's on the low end of beer. I appreciate the effort, but it doesn't suit me much. i'll still drink it... I liked the other one, the dark island, much more...."
""
"A very nice mild stout, has a bit of nice hops which works well as the balance is very solid. Drinks very nicely actually. Would recommend this as a flavorful session stout, good brew. 4"
"Sampled from a 500ml bottle. A deep, dark beer with a small beige head. Nice malty aromas with a flavor that follows. Malts dominate the experience with a rich flavor up front and a dry finish. The flavor is big and rewarding despite the 4% alcohol. Creamy, satisfying and refreshing."
""
""
"O: Enjoyable stout. worth checking out"
""
""
"Velvety smooth and creamy on the mouth with a light feel to it. Overall, a pleasant change of pace from the norm of bigger and bolder American stouts. Packs quite a bit of flavor in a small 4% abv package."
""
"The taste seems lacking in sweetness, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but other stouts I've tried seem more well-rounded. There is a very interesting rich roasted maltiness and just enough hoppy sharpness to make this stout a plus on my list, in spite of the dry finish."
""
""
"Overall: A brilliant stout that is to be tried by anybody even vaguely interested in darker beer. However, the intensity of its flavours means that such people should perhaps warm themselves up with contemporary stouts such as Guinness or Murphy's before abandoning the sweetness and nitro-carbonation for the rich smokiness and experience of Dragonhead. Another fine brew by the lads at Orkney!"
"Overall I would have scored much lower but really this is AMA amazing beer for 4 percent."
"Very, very nice nose - definitely pour this one into a snifter. Low alcohol and sits kind of heavy, but is nice for those afternoons up north at the cabin when you're just kicking back and relaxing. Kind of has a smoky taste to it - very unique. A bit on the expensive side."
""
"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Pours a typically black colour with a healthy brown/beige head. The nose is very Scottish and suggests the sea/ocean and smoke. On the palate it is notably dry with smokey/earthy/dirt notes. Definitely a unique dry stout in many regards. It has many characteristics of much bigger (imperial) stouts, but is very modest alcohol-wise."
""
""
"Good body, smooth aftertaste. Great flavors that are different from most American stouts I have tried. This one definitely bears its Scottish label of origin proudly."
""
"This looks quite good at first glance, but the eventual strange fruitiness, in all its underwhelming sideshowiness, kind of mars an otherwise decent stout, what with its inherent chocolate tendencies. Oh well - I guess that this is just one of those 'easier to drink than analyze' offerings. Hey, it happens."

"I poured the beer from a bottle into a glass. The beer was dark, almost black. The head had a tan color. I couldn't smell anything. My sense of smell is weak (hence the average rating). I could taste roasted malt and coffee. The beer felt light in my mouth and went down easy. I note the alcohol level was low. I didn't pick up any alcohol warmth which I would expect for that level of alcohol. An easy drinking, good tasting stout."
""

"500ml bottle. Enjoyed on agt´11. Pure black into a Pint glass. Dark beige , small bubbled, foam creates a dense, creamy & thick layer crown. Lasting head & spotty lacing. Toasted malts sweept up by winds of coffee to the nose, subtle fruity aroma too. Dry bitter coffee at first sip, slightly sweet flavor in the middle is increased by chocolate hues. Medium body & low carbonation. Sweet finish then coffee returns, Nice drinkability, unfortunately this pretty gentle stout results quite cloying finally."
""
"D: This was a good traditional English stout. The scent and taste and body were all pretty simple, but nice. The finish was fairly smooth, so it was easy to drink. Not an impressive beer, but nothing wrong with it either."

"Easy going down. Very enjoyable with the porter cheese. Lots of flavor and a nice easy-drinking ABV. No idea what the bottle cost but if it's reasonable I'd buy this again."
"There is the smallest detection of bitterness in the finish."
""
"O: A good, roasted stout. Could use a richer body, but nicely sessionable given the low ABV."
""
"D: i do enjoy light-bodied dark beers. rather counter-intuitive to most. nice having a stout that it is so easy drinking."
""
""
"O.	Overall this was an enjoyable beer and I was glad I had a chance to drink a style I 	don’t get often. The biggest thing I will take from this is the great peat smoke 	finish that reminds me of a nice glass of laphroaig."
""
"Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, very tasty, definitely on the lighter side as was evident by the ABV. I'd buy this again for sure."
"Poured a rich dark chocolate in colour with minimal head that left a lot of lacing. Smelled very much of sarsparilla, caramel and chocolate. Taste of malt, coffee and chocolate with a spicy bitter finish. A little lighter on the mouthfeel than most stouts. Carbonation not too heavy. Quite drinkable."
"Cheers"
"Overall / Drinkability: A stout at 4%....a sessionable stout indeed! I think the only thing I'm no too crazy about with this beer is the carbonation and mouthfeel, but besides that, it's a nice beer that I think would be fantastic on cask or on tap. I could see myself enjoying another one of these over a course of an evening, and even more so with the right meal."
"Orkney Brewery Dragonhead Stout pours with a black colour and a decent enough head that fades to sparse lacing. The smell is very weak but I smell some roasted malt - maybe some bitter coffee... maybe. The flavour is sour and sharp up front. With some some charcoal in the middle. The finish is sour and smokey. The texture is nice and frothy. Overall, I didn't like this stout that much. Too sour and smokey."
"O: The beer is very flavorful considering its low alcohol; I could drink this all night long because it is very sessionable."
"Prepare yourself for a showcase of carbonized malt with this one. A man's drink."
"D - I can't get past the Scotch comparison. If you enjoy the type of flavors in Scotch, you may dig this brew. If you think Scotch is nasty, you probably won't enjoy this."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy overall and wood be good with some traditional irish fare and desserts"
"Body is very watery."
"Poured a deep ruby opaque black. Sweet roasted malts dominated this beer, with a long lasting head and lace. This is a malty stout with subdued coffe taste that is dominated by firm malt base. Bittering was a bit low for the style, but still this is a outstanding beer. Nice firm body, smooth, and quite balanced."
"An easier drinker for sure. Nothing heavy or cloying about this one. You could knock back pints of this all night. There are other stouts that I like more, but would not refuse this one. I'll have this again."
"Drinkability- About what you would expect from an English stout."
"Perhaps it's coincidental that the two best UK breweries in my opinion are in Scotland: Harviestoun and Orkney. And with the truly exceptional Dragonhead stout, Orkney may have pulled ever so slightly ahead of Harviestoun. If it weren't so expensive here in the USA I'd drink this with every meal-- well, that's a bit of hyperbole, but you get the point. From the opaque, clarinet-black color to the aromas of coffee, chocolate, rope (?) and lemons; from the roasty front end to the citrus tail end, this is a UK stout without peer. I'm now on a quest to drink the entire Orkney line."
"D = Very drinkable for as strong tasting as it is."
"D: It goes well with barbeque sunflower seeds so that's something. I won't be buying it again."
"Beer is medium to light in body. Its sweet an mildly bitter but its mostly roasty at the back. Its a little thin for my tastes, but overall its a repeatable, good session stout. I would drink it again."
"Definitely drinkable.Very good stout taste. A nice treat on a cool summers eve."
"D- An interesting take on the style that makes it nice to revisit from time to time."
"D- a different take on stout. Very tasty but fairly expensive."
"Still a darn fine beer."
"Clean finish and very drinkable. Good, almost creamy body. I thought this was an excellent example of an English, would have this regularly if it wasn't so damn expensive for a session beer."
"Taste is definitely smoky, with a little peat and fruit to go along. Uniquely odd, but enjoyable nonetheless. Somewhat thin mouthfeel and the finish is so light, it disappears super-fast. Mild roast and a fair amount of chocolate with a substantial dusty chalk flavor as it warms. Sweetness is low, but ample. Has a myriad of flavors, that is for sure, but the steep pricetag of $5.75 would prevent me from purchasing this very often."
"Overall: Pretty good stout, not intense or heavy, but nice and fruity with some good smoke."
"Looks and smells great, but it isn't such a great stout from this usually lovely Orcadian brewery. Still, it does have a bit of uniqueness to it that makes it certainly worth trying if you get the chance."
""
"Nice dark black colour, what you hope for from a good English stout. Pretty good head retention. Lots of coffee bean smell and smells like a stout should. Taste was a bit of a let down. Maybe a little astringency and not as complex as I was hoping for. Maybe could use with a higher ABV? Leaves a nice smokey taste in the mouth though. Overall pretty solid, the Dark Island from these guys is better though."
"D - Good for style, but the mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired."
"D- not the most complex stout, but a mild and highly drinkable one. absolutely thirst quenching, and at 4% i can have my stout nutrition without a ton of booze. flavor improves as it warms up, but i'd rather chug it out of a giant viking helmet!"
"I would love to visit the Brewery, however. I could see myself slamming low alcohol Dragonhheads with Viking descendents in remote little corner of the world that Orkney must be and offering a more charitable review after the experience."
"Very drinkable for a stout. Subtle burnt character and nice dark flavours, but smooth, English and polite. I enjoy this, even though I'm not blown away by the flavour."
"A really excellent and very enjoyable little brew. Smooth, deep and delectable, with plenty of character. To boot, it's very drinkable, and goes down incredibly smoothly. Very, very enjoyable."
"D: Damn good taste and the ABV would allow you to session all night long. Really is a solid low ABV stout."
"Love the way this brewery displays their beers in nice looking bottles with good labels front and back that tell you something about the beer and their reason for producing it if i could award a score for presentation for the bottle of this brewereies beer they would prob score a 5 everytime,it pours a jet black colour with nice carbonation that leaves a frothy one finger cappicino laced head with decent carbonation that leaves noticable creamy lacing very nice looking,it smells exactly like a strong cappicino with a subtle dark choc background very nice,it has an average mouthfeel with massive hints of nice roasted dark coffee and chestnuts flooding the palette which culminates in the end with some spicy hops to make this beer a very good example of the style."
"D - Could drink this all night, but would take me awhile on each."
"D- Very easy drinking stout. Definitely will be keeping a spot in the fridge for it."
"Not bad at all, especially for a stout coming in at 4.0%. I would call for more chunkiness overall - this is a nice base for a beer that could be great. This bottled version isn't."
"The typical Viking ship name & logo made me second-guess whether to pick this one up from the shop, but the fact that it was from Orkney alleviated any immediate misgivings. A good, dark brown pour with red edges hinting at some light coming through soon sat dark with a medium brown one finger head & light brown lace. The aroma exuded roasted malts with dark chocolate and coffee smells with hints of a browning banana. Smooth, medium-bodied, the flavor held the above but with a nice warming smoked peat flavor and hint of salt-water and seaweed, which definitely gave it some character & did not detract from the experience. There was definitely the undertone of a nice smoky single malt scotch that my wife noted was ""unique and wonderful", that says it all...fine for a damp day"
"D - This is a drinkable beer."
"Light bodied, nicely carbonated - if it didn't display such an impressive head, I'm fairly convinced the CO2 would've been too much. Very quaffable - if it were more available, this would have a chance at becoming my stand-by session stout."
"great mouthfeel. just the right amount of body to make it a light abv sipper. maybe drops the drinkability a bit, but certainly something i would not mind drinking again."
"D: A decent session brew, but not much else. Make mine stronger, please."
"Notes: 500 ml bottle poured into an Imperial Pint Glass. BBE JUN 09."
"Solid drinkable brew and very good for style."
"Drinkable, sure. I could drink only this for a session. A good stout that stands up to most."
"D: Of course, being a softer alcohol content makes it very easy to take back, but it does have a nice quality of having a few different flavours and moments in which each of those shine, so it's nice to sip away and think about. A decent brew... Orkney did not disappoint with this one."
"D: Very drinkable. I would drink another but limit it to one per session."
"D: Smelled and looked good, but it's completely undrinkable. It's undercarbonated and tastes bad."
"D: A creamy, smooth, and rich dark roasted flavor in a modest 4.0% packaging."
"D - This is an excellent version of a dry stout produced by a small brewery. While the cost, $5.00ottle, might limit drinking several, it's certainly worth saving up for!"
"At 4%, this is a highly drinkable English Stout. It has all the classic hallmarks of the style. I wonder if it would taste even better on tap or even from a draught-style can? If you love stouts, this is a good choice."
"I love the artwork on their bottle for this brew. Vikings rule(d)."
"This is a nice stout to enjoy. Not my favorite stout, but still pretty damn good. I could see myself quaffing a few of these at a nice pub."
"Poured an almost pitch black body with a tan head that was two-finger head but receeded quickly. A thick, heavy roasted malt smell is prevelant with coffee, toffee and roasted malts along with some citric (and maybe sour apples) notes in the background. A creamy, thin to medium bodied brew that has a sweet malt taste with a dry backbite that seems to contain coffee malts and some sweet and smoky malt aftertaste (something like tobacco or weeds). This is a quality beer that I could session."
"Judging from other reviews, I either have a bad bottle or it caught me on a bad day for tasting stouts."
"Nicely balanced, an enjoyable, mild, easy drinking stout."
"Altogether, this was a winner. One I will definitely revisit offering easy drinkability and a nice variety of flavors to seek."
"Jet black with a pale, coffee colored head. Nice, low roasted aroma. Somewhat burnt and resiny. Good dose of roasted malt flavor without being harsh. Toasted malt and oats. Just a hint of bitterness with a mild lingering sweetness. Great body-not too thin and leaves a slick finish on the tongue. Hard to believe the low abv. A great all around beer. I love a dark beer with this much flavor and a low abv. I could do this all night. Really exceptional. Might replace Dark Island as my favorite Orkney brew."
"D - Nice flavor. Obviously a nice session stout with good flavor at 4% ABV. Just needs a tiny bit more body as noted above, which makes the drinkablility suffer a little."
"Overall- An easy sipping Stout. Smooth and enjoyable."
"D- A nice british stout with a bit more flavor kick. Will likely pick up more in the future"
"D: This is a pretty drinkable beer. Like all stouts, it's heavy, not something I can drink a lot of."
"D-A good slow drinking beer. Easy to enjoy"
"D - A very nice beer indeed. A stout that I would drink on a fairly regular basis if it were a bit cheaper."
"D - Massive flavour for only 4% ABV. Could quite easily drink this all night. What an excellent stout!"
"It came to the table with a wonderfully opaque, black look with a tan head (bubbly) and had great lacing. It had an outstanding burnt grain scent, very deep and strong, a great aromatic sensation. There was an excellent burnt grain flavor with great coffee overtones and even an excellent bitterness for a stout. One of the smoothest stouts I've had as well. Outstanding!"
"Pours pitch black. Tan head. A big head at that. Nose is really nice chocolate tones. Smooth and consistent. Really good fragrance. Flavor is more bitter, but consistent. The chocolate may be on the nose, but it certainly isn't on the flavor profile. The bitter smoothes out over time. Feel is nice and thick on the liquid. Good carbonation too. Drinkable, yes. Well made, just doesn't have any crazy flavor characteristics, but who needs it."
"D= very drinkable bottle, maybe a few, would love to see how many I could take, on-tap."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler a 50 degrees. The beer was black and poured a poor head with no lacing. The taste was nice and was like bacon or smoked meat with a coffee aftertaste that was just about right. I will buy again and I thinkyou should try this product. They are a good brewery."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours pitch black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both average. It smells like roasted malt, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate, a good malty aroma. It tastes pretty much the same way it smells, however the aroma is stronger than the taste. Also, there's a little bit of citrusy hops noticable in the taste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium. It's a little bit slick, but it's also a little on the watery side. Carbonation is low which makes this easy to drink, but I prefer my stouts to have more body to them. Overall it's not a bad beer, but there are a lot better stouts out there that I'd rather drink."
"I loved this !! But alas,at 5 bucks a bottle it is too expensive to drink on a regular basis.It poured black as coal,with not much head or carbonation and smelled divine.The taste was exceptional,and went down nicely.I will treat myself to this again...soon."
"Drinkability - Easy drinker, just not my cup of tea."
"D: A low abv and that quintessential roasted, chocolatey malt profile make for a pretty drinkable stout. Not the most amazing, by any means, but a good offering from Orkney."
"Bottle poured jet black and the head quickly subsides to a thin lace .Aromas of milk choclate, rosted malts and some coffee. It was creamy but the body was not as full as I like for a stout .My tastebuds picked up on the chocolate malts ,some what of a burned after taste there is also a lite hoppyness to it as well . I give the bottle high marks for the art work tho definatly one for the colection"
"Perfect drinkability. An excellent beer that I could drink all night and still be able to walk home from the bar ... and it taste excellent too."
"Overall, a tasty stout that's easy to drink. The body could stand a slight boost to stand up to the rather robust flavor. Otherwise, it's one that any stout lover should enjoy."
"Overall a slightly above average stout. There are better options out there, however and I doubt I will seek this out again."
"It looked tempting, and had a pleasing coffe aroma, but I found the taste underwhelming. This could have been due to poor storage on the part of the retail establishment from which it was purchased. Bad luck perhaps, but would still seek it out for another shot."
"Rich, smouth stout body...low ABV makes this a sipper. Tone down the sourness a bit and this would be a winner."
"Overall: Looks good, smells good, but too thin and without much flavor character. A kind of lite stout. Many better offerings out there; Ill skip this one next time. Ive enjoyed some of Orkneys other beers; this is not one of my favorites."
"The beer is quite dry with an accompanying dusty chocolate note. The middle and finish actually have a note of burnt malt sweetness. This has quite a light body to it; it is very quaffable. The beer finishes with a hint of roast grain astringency, a touch of chalkiness, and a nicely lingering roast coffee character. This actually has a touch of roast derived acidity here, which adds a nice tart backdrop to the other flavors. This is an interesting beer, quite tasty and I like that it is so light. This is something that Guinness draught should aspire to be."
"Quite average, overall. Poured a very dark brown, black in the middle, with brown highlights. Single finger head was reduced to a khaki coloured web scattered over the surface in a matter of seconds. This looked like a million other English Stouts. Nice, but quite average, really. Smell was muted coffee grounds, unsweetened bakers chocolate, and toasted malt. How many times have I used those words to describe a stout? Taste was a bit sweeter than I was expecting, which I liked, and the finish was pleasantly dry while at the same time flavourful, which I really enjoyed as well. Mouthfeel, however, was quite a bit thinner than I was anticipating. This, of course, I was displeased with. Certainly not a bad stout, just very ""typical""."
"Drinkability: Smooth and delicious, would definetly have it again distinct among so many stouts"
"Fairly straightforward stout, but tasty nonetheless."
"This beer poured a black color with a thick tan head that was persistent. The smell was at first strong of alcohol and then faded to some fruity notes. There is also a hint of coffee odor. The taste has some bitter and a bit chocolaty. The mouthfeel is full but not as heavy as I would have thought from the sight. This is actually a very drinkable stout that goes down pretty smooth."
"Pours dark brown/black with garnet highlights and a creamy light tan head. Smell is coffee, chocolate and lots of sweetness. Taste is dominated by roasted malts. Medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. This is a great one, wish it was more widely availabe as this would make a great session beer with plenty of flavor, body and a low alcohol content."
"I'll have to give this one another chance on a stout night."
"Yep...that's a big beer. Hugely malty, sweet, and robust. Espresso-like in its roastiness and Oreo-like in its chocolatey, creamy flavor and texture. Full and rich from sip to finish. Almost too rich and sweet. Balanced only by the roasted grain bittering and a hardly-detectable hop character. Quite smooth and velvety on it's way down. Nearly sweet stout-ish. Could use a bit more balance, and alcoholic power. I'll have to chase this one with a glass of milk."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth. Just want to roll it around the tongue. Drinkability is good, but I wish there was something a bit more distinctive about this one. It's a good representative of the style, but without anything outstanding. If it was kicked up to 6% ABV, maybe they'd have more to work with."
"A black as night beer. Has a bubbly brown head. The aroma is an inticeing one two punch of rich dark chocolate and espresso. There is a hint of chocolate sweetness on the start of the taste, but it is quickly dominated the espresso bean character. The mouthfeel throws off the satisfation of this beer. As in it felt much to light (read weak or watery) for the style and the combination of the other characteristics (Apperance, smell)."
"This brew pours a dark, intensely black color and has a respectable, rocky tan head. Smells of roast barley and burnt malt. It has a dark-roast coffee aroma and barely detectable hop aroma. The taste is dry and bitter, with a pronounced deeply roasted chocolate and coffee flavor. More coffee than chocolate. Its body is very light, at times almost watery. A bit more heft (and not a lot) would have given this beer a more character. The finish is bitter and somewhat lingering. This brew suffers from a lack of intensity and a thin body. Theres nothing particularly off about it, its just a too polite (yawn)."
"Poured a rich, dark, chocolatey color with a medium-thin head which dissipated rather quickly. Good carbonation. Bitter aroma at the front, but some nice roasted chocolate notes, especially as the beer warms. Taste was very well balanced: bitterness, roasted and chocolate flavors all danced together very well. Some slight sweetness thrown into the mix. Medium-bodied and easy to drink. A well-rounded stout in my opinion."
"Drinks heavier than it is. With the the expresso notes, I think this would be an interesting desert beer. Sturdy bottle would be perfect for homebrewing or home defense!"
"This beer poured a dark brown, almost black with a small tan head. It smells of malt, and the taste is definitely roasted malt, with chocolate and coffee notes, like a good stout should be. The mouthfeel was definitely a bit thin for this type of beer, but I found it to be a very drinkable stout. Definitely recommended."
"500 ml bottle. Dragonhead stout pours out a not quite black color with a medium sized head. The aroma is chocolatey and roasty. The flavor is smooth and roasty. More roasty than your average stout, yet not overly bitter. A light hoppiness complements the malty flavor very well. The body is a tad thin, but this does not prevent the flavors from coming through. The low alcohol helps to make this a very drinkable beer. I'd love to try it on cask."
"A heavy mouthfeel, and that is a good thing. This stout would not be what it is without the deep feel and slow drinkability that it posesses. A true sipper even with the low AVB. I recommend giving this stout a try."
"A different kind of stout, and definitely worth trying."
"More of a dry stout in the mouth. The taste needs to catch up with the aroma though."
"D: for a 4.0%abv. stout, this beer is truly flavoursome... I can imagine how good it's gonna be if served on cask. Definitely a session/quaffable stout for me, in all seasons!"
"D - A decent effort here. I could have ths again, but although unless I get it on tap, I doubt I will. It would be a chore to session with the mouthfeel. The flavor is poor, it is a little burnt and not pleasant. It really does nothing for me."
"In defense of the Orkney Brewery, their other beers that I've had (Red MacGregor and Dark Island) both acquitted themselves very well."
"The beer poured a rich black with 2 fingers of light brown head that slowly receeded leaving a good lace on the glass. The aroma was of good dark malt and just a bit smokey. The taste is simply a wonderful smokieness. This isn't the harsh overpowering smoke you get with some beers, just a good pleasant taste like you'd have with good BBQ. Underlying it is a nice bit of maltiness, no real sign of any hops, but they're not needed here. The feel is excellent for a Stout. I usually find Stouts a little watery, but his is just smooth with a nice dry finish that leaves a very pleasant smokey aftertaste. Almost like a good bowl of pipe tobaco, which would probably go well with this beer as well. I would have to say this is best Stout I have ever had. This will be a beer I will look for and want to keep on hand alongside the Schneiders and the Old Nick"
"I find this to be a very interesting beer because the smell is so sweet and similar to bittersweet chocolate with caramel. The taste betrays this smell with such dryness and bitter black patent malt flavors. A wonderfully complex stout."
"Drinkability: The lower ABV and roasted profile makes this one easy going down. Not great but not bad either. Worth a shot if you can get it."
"Overall I'm a bid dissappointed with the ""cost to taste"" ratio of this brew and would have made it a ""regular"" in my stable if the presentation of ""stout"" were more towards my perception of what a stout should be."
"Dragonhead Stout is worth a try at least once, but as it is an import, it's a little pricey, and there are plenty of other stouts equal or better to this one that you could also get for a much better price."
"This is one beautiful beer. It pours an opaque black color. The head is tan with lighter tan speckles. The best part is this gorgeous head lingers forever. The aroma is fantastic too. It jumps out of the bottle the second it is opened. Chocolate everwhere. Roasted malt and coffee are also present. Now on to the taste. Coffee is the dominent flavor with roasted malt undertones. The taste isn't nearly as impressive as the aroma, but it isn't bad either. The mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew, and is worth a try."
"To me this was a very thin stout, had it had more body and backbone I would have found it more appealing. Still it was quite drinkable and I would have one again."
"Cask conditioned at the 32nd Cambridge Beer Festival, gravity dispense. Black colour, low head. Roasty aroma, hints of dark chocolate. Flavour is decidedly roasty with coffee notes, quite dry. This is not a very complex beer, but still a very drinkable stout that beats Guinness any day!"
"This is a tasty beer, but there are many other's that I would place before it. The flavor is nice, but nothing too special. Worth a try."
"Drinkability is just MOR (middle of the road). Decent complexity and balance but nothing for the nose. Aftertaste is light especially for the style."
"The beer is lite and very drinkable. At 4.0% abv it would be an incredible session beer I think."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and creamy malt scent that boasts of crystal, chocolate, and roasted malts. It is quite sweet and chocolatey. The taste is good. It has an intensley rich black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes earthy and dry. It is full of malt complexity. It starts sweet and chocoalety, but finishes dry and rich in patent flavor. There are also some hops in the aftertaste as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking English stout. It is low in alcohol, but high in flavor."
"On the waifish side through the mouth, with a mild but perky carbonation. Fattened a tad, this might congeal into something truly special. Even as is, this is drinkable in nothing less than gulps, and represents the Dry Stout style very well."
"Opaque brown, little light comes through, mousse-like dark tan head of good retention. Laces in thick smears. Aroma is sweet, light caramel with just a hint of a sparse roast. Mouthfeel is lightish, more carbonation than some. Starts slowly and agreeable, chocolatey with some oily bitterness, then the profile thins pretty dramatically, leaving a slightly unsatisfying impression. Finishes with the coffee and carbonation intact but without a lot of meat left to the mouthfeel or malt impact. Fairly drinkable, light in alcohol, too thin for my expectations."
"This one's a keeper. Best for when you want something drier and dustier than stouts like Sam Smith but still with a cocoa kick."
"Drinkability: Nothing to get too excited about but also not something that is objectionable, either"
"No dating. Deep and dark, almost black.... can only see a twinge of ruby if you hold it to the light. Nice amount of head settled down to a thin khaki layer of creaminess that you can catch glimpes of dark through. Dark roasted malt scents, chocolate and sasafrass.... tobacco as it warms. I was surprised with the bitey carbination, but it still feels pretty good, just a bit shocking. Medium bodies. Nice roasty flavors with chocolate and coffee blended in. Goes down very smooth and easy, nicely drinkable."
"I found this being a rather mild stout, making it easy to drink."
"The fix is obvious. More malt would do wonders for Dragonhead Stout and would most likely elevate it to the ranks of the very good. As is, it's drinkable, but I can't stop myself from thinking 'what if... ' every time I upend the glass."
"This came in a 500ml bottle. Pours out a pitch-black body with a tall tan head. As it was consumed the head stuck around and left decent lacing. Aroma is of light chocolate with slight roasted malt undertones. Flavor is similar with a chocolate maltiness being dominate with notes of roasted malt and a bitter earthiness in the back. Mouthfeel is light for a stout but otherwise smooth. Good drinkability here, with the low ABV and its smoothness going down. Solid beer but nothing I would get excepting about."
"Pours out a deep, dark, completely opaque black color with a small almond colored head that quickly disappeared. Leaves a little lacing on the glass, but not much. The aroma has strong coffee notes as well as some expressions of chocolate and caramel. Overall a very pleasant smell. Taste is also strongly suggestive of coffee and sweet, dark malts. Slightly over carbonated and thusly a little thin for a stout. Mouthfeel suffers slightly, but not enough to make this one a loser. Overall, a very tasty brew that brings a slightly different interpretation of the stout style. Not the best on the shelf, but definitely worth a try."
"Reflection:This was a pretty good stout, the smoky flavor was a nice change and I will be buying this one again."
"A deep black color with visible carbonation during the pour. The head is a light brown and rocky. Lacing is good n sticky. Aroma is like a chocolate mousse; chocolaty, and lightly alcoholic with some roasted notes. Flavor is surprisingly bitter in the middle (the start is quite undetectable) and lacking in a sweetening balance. Palate is light bodied and watery with a lingering bite. The flavor seems to improve over time, although it is still quite one-dimensional."
"Pours with a five-finger plus (pour very slowly) light brown head that is thick and frothy leaving a ton of lace. Totally black color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Nose is roasted coffee. Starts with a strong roasted coffee flavor and finishes slightly bitter. $3.49 for a 500ml bottle, Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."
"This beer is a good thing, but almost too much for my senses to handle, but, I'll drink as many as the hubby will bring me."
"Very light up front and really malty. Thinner than expected. The payoff comes in the end. The finish is an interesting amalgamation of peat and a bit of coffee that hangs around for a while."
"Pours a nice deep amber with a slightly off white creamy head that leaves a good amount of lace,aroma is light for a stout but appetizing I pick up some roasted malt and a touch of nuttiness.taste as well is on the mellow side but is very appetizing some unsweetened chocolate and roasted malt with alingering earthy finish.A big time quaffing stout mellow and easy to drink with some flavor,a tad thin but well done from Orkney."
"A decent stout. Poured almost balck with a nice craemy head. Smeel was predominantly malt and sweet....nothing special. Taste was lightly malty with a light bitter finish. Very smooth in the drinkability category....light feel. Mouthfeel is light with the malt presence introducing itself nicely. Not bad for such a low abv."
"I can't help but like this beer, and I'd advise you to try it, at least. Doesn't rock any worlds, but damned if it doesn't taste good, and that's all I'm caring about right about now."
"I was very let down by this beer. Poured a beautiful rich black with a delayed mocha head. Aroma was smokey malt, and the smokeyness followed in the flavor as a monotone smoked malt. Not dry enough to be enjoyed as a dry Irish, and not rich enough for an English stout - simply lackluster and boring. I tried to find a freshness date to give this the benefit of the doubt, but found none. Orkney continues to underwhelm me, notwithstanding some nice looking bottles."
"Incredibly sexy when pulled through the Beer Engine, but a rather above average feel from the bottle. Not bad value for $3 in California though, for this is still an expensive beer in the UK, when you can find it that is."
"Overall a good drinkable stout..nice for the low alcohol."
"Beer came in a 16.9 ounce bottle."
"All 4's for me. This is another great brew from Orkney. I would rate this one up with, maybe even slightly better than, D. Carnegie's Stout. It's appearance was really nice too. It was thick black with a frothy, pillowy head that lasted a little while. The smell was like a typical stout, deep, rich, roasted, and chocolatey. The big thing that seperated it from most stouts was the super chocolatey smell and taste. The taste was similar to the smell, but on a grander scale. It was very warming to drink and left me quenching for more. As far as drinkability, I could drink this great stuff all day at work and night at home. Then again, that could be a bad thing!"
"Pours black, but reddish brown around the edges. The head is probably the darkest I've ever seen for such a weak stout. The brown foam on top of this is what you expect for a 6% or an imperial stout. Instead it's on top of a 4% stout. Quite impressive. I was expecting to be let down, but then I stuck my nose into the glass and the aroma is HUGE. Much fresh coffee aroma. It's kind of like sticking your nose into a bag of coffee. A little chocolate backing it up. The flavor is equally big. A bit sweet, a little smokey, but oh so good. It's a little rich to be a quick drink, but you enjoy every sip. I'm impressed that they packed so much flavor into such a relatively small beer. Kudos to Orkney."
"Overall, A good stout. Give it a try if you haven't had it."
"Pretty good color that is extremely dark and thick. It has about an inch of frothy brown head. There is a sweet chocolate oaky aroma to this beer. the flavor was robust. Not to sweet and not to dry with a good balance of malts and bitterness. there are a lot of flavors going on in this beer ranging from a bittersweet chocolate to a roasted flavor. All and all a pretty good stout with a lot going on."
"Oh, and despite not being allowed in as a scoring factor, the bottle is one of the coolest looking I've ever seen. Drink this one if you can find it."
"Poured black as night, with a lovely one inch chocolate soda head, interesting initial nose, sort of mochaish, the first taste however followed up on none of that. thre was a lingering roasted taste that lingered till the end, but all in all it could be classified a light stout."
"Jet black beer with a frothy, tantilizing head. Aromas of chocolate, maple syrup, and dark (and sweetened) fruits. Taste starts light and creamy and moves to a quick roasted flavor -- almost smoky though not *actually* smoky. It's roasted in the way a marshmellow is roasted. Light coffee tones drop off to a strangely absent finish -- hard to describe, really -- where the flavor really disappears with little significant aftertaste. An easy drinking stout that loses its creaminess quickly -- so it's a bit thin in finish and in body. Nothing spectacular but definitely nice."
"From NERAX 2003, this beer had a large following as was evidenced by the long lines formed in front of the tap. Roofing tar in color with a tint of brown when held to light. The rather large bubbles pop and fade quickly leaving a thin trace of lace. A faint aroma of molasses, malt and hops. Semi-dry. The lightly sweet malt balances well with tea-like and mild citrusy hops. Weak coffee and a trace of camphor are detected. A nice stout to swish around and gulp."
"Interesting. I get heavily toasted bread, dark fruit, maybe some toffee, and a molasses-like flavor that I can't quite put my finger on - I even had my wife (a non-beer-drinker) sniff it to see if she could place the aroma/taste, but she could'nt place it either. The brew has a seriously well-rounded maltiness. There is some roast coffee/chocolate flavor as well, but it hides behind the rounder, sweeter malt aspects until the brew warms a bit. Almost tastes like a cross between a milk stout and a dark mild. Decent chewiness for a 4% brew. One of the more interesting stouts I've tried recently - worth getting a few more bottles to figure it out some more."
"This beer poured a very dark amber, almost black color and formed a huge dark tan foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it very slowly subsided. Almost a float like appearance to it. An aroma of malt and burnt chocolate and coffee. A flavor of malt and coffee. A slightly burnt aspect to the finish, but not in a bad way, and a little lighter than I thought it would be."
"(No bottled on date) -- Appearance: Pours a opaque black in color, and the head is creamy, sticky, rocky and cardboard in color; good retention. Decent carbonation. On the nose there is a pleasant aroma of dark chocolate, roastiness, and toasted bread. The body is light and mouthfeel is creamy smooth. The flavors consist of rich dark chocolate, dry charcoal, roasted malts, hints of some fruit, slight bitterness, hints of toffee, and a lingering dry roastiness. I enjoyed this brew...a very tasty stout"
"Although this is brewed by the wonderful, small Orkney brewery, it pales in comparison to their other brews... although that is partly due to the style itself. The body is typically opaque black, and it's topped by a full and frothy dark tan head that soon drops to a thin surface covering. It does, however, leave some nice lace throughout the glass. The nose expresses some dull fruitiness and minor roastiness which is nice, although there seems to be some minor acetone/solvent-like character as well. The body is typically light with a very nicely creamy mouthfeel from a very fine and moderate carbonation that's intended to replicate their cask-conditioned version. The flavor, again, expresses the typical characteristics of a dry Irish stout with a gently fruity (apple), lightly tangy (low pH) and smoothly roasty malt that's well backed by firm bitterness. It finishes quite dry with a light touch of tart fruitiness and a lingering roastiness. A very straight-forward rendition that's much better direct from the cask than in the bottle."
"Chocolate, burnt coffee, nuts and dry fruits. Full and round body. iIf you consider the low alcoholic level (4 ABV), this beer has a perfect body, a complet mouthfeel with a freshing flavour. Herbal notes. If you drink one of this beer, you are tempted to drink another one (and you'll do it, if you just have it...), and you'll be an happy man!. Very satisfating."
