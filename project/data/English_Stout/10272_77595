It ends up being complete opaque with no light getting through the body.  The nose has a hint of whiskey, pulling in hints of nuts, vanilla, sticky toffee, dates, cooked plums, espresso, and chocolate.  There’s a fruitiness to the elements of espresso, cigar, and chocolate.  On the palate it has a burned malt flavor, like caramel too long on the stove, but channels delicious notes of caramel, espresso, dates, and dark chocolate.  The mouthfeel is heavy thanks to the alcohol, but feels somewhat smooth, and doesn’t get hot.  The aftertaste is rather short, but channels that charred wood, smoke, espresso flavor combination with a hint of cacao powder.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Feb 17, 2015"

Shame it is only brewed in small batches which makes it hard to get in Northern Ireland, although that does make the pleasure of drinking it even greater as I always know it is a limited pleasure. My advice is purchase as much as you can when it is about and hide it away in the cellar for special occasions. On second thoughts it is probably a good job this is only brewed in small batches or I would move to Scotland and drink the lot before it left the yard. (But maybe that is just the Ulster Scots heritage talking.)","BeerDrinkersWorldTour","Sep 09, 2014"

Gentle sweetness and a little bit of spice develops into a hint of bitterness. Light to medium palate and a suggestion of alcoholic warmth. Not aggressively assertive but pleasant and drinkable, nonetheless. Very similar to their rum offerings.","magpieken","Aug 11, 2014"

A decent brew; the only problem is that it comes across as over-polished (like many I&G beers). Could be enhanced by bottle conditioning, but I won't hold my breath.

The head sticks around a while, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, Irish whiskey, and some dark fruit and coffee. It tastes like roasted malt, Irish whiskey, bittersweet chocolate, oak/wood, coffee, dark fruit (cherries), peat, and vanilla. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, it's not heavy on the Irish whiskey and I think it meshes well with the stout.

Dark roasted malts, milk chocolate, coffee, substantial sweetness on the nose. I can’t seem to detect any whiskey barrel in the aroma, however. Taste is sweet maltiness up front with bittersweet chocolate. Now you can taste the whiskey, although it’s not as forward as I thought it might be. There are bitter malts at the end with a fairly sweet finish. The mouthfeel is smooth but not as creamy as I like in a stout. This is a decent barrel-aged stout, but I think it could’ve benefited with more time in the whiskey barrels.","greenmtn1111","Aug 09, 2013"

Taste is much the same with cocoa, vanilla, and woody flavors on the finish. A smoke flavor comes out as the beer warms up. There is a vanilla sweetness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The aroma is full of sweet malt from the whiskey cask, along with a bit of roast and chocolate from the stout. The aroma is a little poorly integrated, but the taste makes up for it with smooth oak and whiskey tones over a generic, yet solid English stout dry roast. The mouthfeel is light for the style and gently carbonated, and the drinkability is great. Overall, this is another solid beer from Innis and Gunn. They seem to have a thing going on where they make complex yet delicate sipping beers. I'm all for it.","shand","Feb 21, 2013"

4.03,6.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a good example of a barrel aged English Stout, it had some nice Irish Whiskey aspects and some nice English Stout aspects, neither of them were overpowering which made for some nice balance in this beer. This beer had good drinkability, it went down smoother then I expected, I could see drinking one or two of these, the flavors does a good job of holding my interest, I wouldn't turn down another one right now. What I liked most about this beer was the balance and how good it looked in my snifter, those aspects were for sure above average. What I liked least about this beer was the clear bottle and that it had a little too much sweetness, but those aspects didn't hurt this beer that much. I would buy this beer again, it was priced nicely and you don't normally see Irish Whiskey aged beers, I highly recommend giving this beer a try, it's damn good. I'm starting to get into this brewery, I thought their rum beer was solid, but this one was better and nicely balanced, it showcases the best of both worlds. You can bet I will be on the look out for their original and other beers, all in all this was a pretty good beer that managed to impress me, I approve.","StoutHunter","Jul 07, 2012"

Poured into my Innis & Gunn tulip glass, the ale is near black with some ruby at the edges of the glass when held to a light. Huge beige head leaves some great lacing on the glass and holds good retention. This was nice to look at. Aromas are Irish whiskey up front with some roasted malt and oak. Tastes are roasted and smoked malt with a nice dose of Irish whiskey and oak with some vanilla notes, followed by an astringent balsamic vinegar finish. Mouth-feel is smooth with appropriate carbonation and is medium bodied. Overall, the best offering from Innis & Gunn that I've had to this point. Nice one to have leading up to St. Patrick's Day.

Pours a shade darker than cola with a half-inch, frothy, tan-colored head that settles into a bubbly band and a thin film. Some thin spots and swaths of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose expresses lactose and/or artificial sweetener, malt and ethanol with just the slightest suggestion of a whiskey character. Taste is more consistent with a Dark Mild/Porter hybrid with a suggestion of booze in the background than an English Stout. A residual wheaty/grainy quality lingers at the finish. I'm also not sure where the barrel comes into play. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a light, even carbonation the leaves a residual tickle at the back of the tongue.

There's just a bit of vanilla and oak but that's it. Flavor is good up front but there's a bit of an odd ash in the aftertaste that detracts and prevents it from getting higher scores.","Dope","Feb 10, 2012"

3.76,-1.1,4,3,4,4,4,"Decent Irish whiskey aroma. Color is black with a very nice tan head. The taste has light roasted malts, chocolate, light oak, very light vanilla bean and very subtle whiskey flavor. Has hints of vanilla with a faint sweetness taste. Finish is smooth and clean. Very drinkable and enjoyable.","toca","Feb 03, 2012"

4.07,7.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall- I like this, and I would definitely buy this again if I saw it. It's nothing earth shattering, but it is easy to drink and very dangerous at 7%.","Morningside","Jan 30, 2012"
3.6,-5.3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Sweet and buttery, a slight roast in the aftertaste, but wouldn't have guessed it was a stout straightaway. Some astringency, possibly from the barrel. Slightly drying aftertaste, mild roastiness, hard to pinpoint the oak here though. There is some diacetyl, and traces of the base stout, but its a bit muddled and sweet, like the rest of their output i've tried. Not bad, but not unique enough to seek out over local stuff.","emerge077","Jan 28, 2012"

3.27,-13.9,4.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Mostly none existent nose, touch of irish sweetness, but looks great, black, creamy head. Taste is smooth, no barrel though, Irish whiskey sweetness, malolactic? Vanilla extract. Touch of roast. Every thing is very light and smooth, given Irish whiskey is light and smooth, but I hoped for a bit more, if it was a six pack for the same price I could drink it easily, but a four pack is a touch too much for the easy drinker this is.","redleaves","Jan 27, 2012"

4.22,11.1,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Noticeable Irish whiskey aroma. Black with a light half inch tan head. Has that whiskey warming mouth feel to it. Finishes clean.

3.82,0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"A stout from I&G, aged for two months in Irish whiskey casks? Yes, please! It pours a dark ruby-black-brown topped by a relatively small wisp of light tan foam. The nose comprises blunt roasted malts, light char, very light whiskey, light dark-roasted coffee, and a touch of dark chocolate powder. The taste holds notes of light roasted malts, cocoa powder, light oak, very light vanilla bean, very light whiskey (melds deeply with the oak), and a hint of coffee. Everything comes through lightly, layered, and with I&G's signature subtlety of flavor combination. That said, it seems like it should have a more powerful taste, somehow... The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice beer, one that comes across as somehow both complex and simple, but enjoyable nonetheless.","TMoney2591","0"
