"Think light porter roastiness and belgian yeast.  Easy drinking.  Maybe a hint of tartness."
"Comes across more like a dubbel or BSDA than a stout, from the yeast character.  Unremarkable example of any of the styles at any rate."

"I think this beer is certainly a good beer. Every time I go to the Mystic Brewery this beer is always brewed the best. It has a nice dark look to it with a bit of a chocolate taste to it. A stout that is just right as far as alcohol percentage. Must try if you like Stout beer. CHEERS!!!"

"Overall: Tastes like a dubbel mixed with an Irish stout. Very interesting and complex combination of flavors. A nice and complex brew that I will pick up again."

"The taste also brought out the dark coffee notes and dark malts withe dark fruit more in the background. There is a mild hop bitterness that leads to a dry finish. I found it to be quite good."
"The beer pours a molasses color and sits in the glass as mahogany brown with a massive head of light khaki-colored bubbles of all shapes and sizes, which takes its time in dissipating. The head leaves a ringed lacing of fat soapy bubbles on the glass. In body, the beer appears too dark for light to penetrate it, though it did seem clean as the beer was being poured. That being said, the folks at Mystic are the wizards of yeast, and they don’t filter their beers, so I’m willing to bet there are a few floaties hanging out in this beer. On the nose, the beer smells initially like a metallic pear, but not in a bad way. As you shove your nose in this beer it opens up into soft cocoa scents with touches of earthy espresso and dark fruity notes. The smell is soft and subtle on the nose, much like an Irish dry stout is, but this smell is also deeply complex and interesting with yeast esters. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and then tart, and then slightly bitter with roast. In flavor it begins like a classic stout with dry roasty chocolate and coffee flavors and even a touch of coffee, but this is then blanketed as the taste moves forward and yeast esters plunge onto the tongue to suggest funky dark fruit flavors with a slightly metallic twinge. Pear and even slight peach flavors can also be tasted in the esters. The beer finishes closer to a dry stout with bitter roast, but with a nice tart dark fruit kick that adds complexity to the finish. The aftertaste is fairly soft and sweet with light fruit flavors and a faint reminder of dried roast malt with a touch of smoke. In the mouth the beer feels fluffy with medium carbonation and a slight pucker from the acid. In body the beer feels just about medium, and after the beer leaves the mouth is left slightly dry but puckering. Overall, this is a fantastically bizarre beer. It’s not an Irish dry stout at all, though it does show some qualities of a dry stout. It has amazing funky esters, and could quite well be the start of a new style. A New England Dark Ale! Or a Suffolk Dark Ale if we must call it that… Whatever it is, it is super drinkable and tasty, with amazing and flavorful yeast character. Try this beer! It is bizarre and tasty!"

"Overall. Interesting beer that seems to border on a belgian strong ale. Glad to have tried it, thanks again Franklinn!"
"Overall- An acceptable beer. It’s not bad, probably wouldn’t get it again, but I’m not disappointed at all. Still a tasty beer, different from a lot of beers out there. There’s a lot going on and the flavors continue to get stronger as it warms"

"o - Overall an interesting beer and hybrid of styles, though I wasn't a huge fan of it. The nose was nice, but I didn't like the taste. Considering I like some of their other saisons, I'd rather grab those off the shelf than revisit this one."

"Taste is chocolate sweetness to start, light fruitiness in the center, and closes with a soft bitterness that leaves with a tart aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is pretty good. Interesting brew."
""
"O: a very interesting and complex brew... A lot going on here between the malts and yeast notes.... And deffinatly a more carbonated mouthfeel then I am used to... Overall I enjoyed this brew and would deffinatly drink it again. It just seems to grow on me more and more as I drink it."

"O) A very good brew. I'd definitely have another. A diverse flavor profile with a lot of good things going on."

"Overall, there are excellent flavors in this brew, and the combination of ash and lovely fruit esters was delightful. However, the flavors ultimately come across as quite light and airy in presence, fading quickly and never quite reaching a decent strength even at their zenith, giving the brew a watery feel. And the high levels of carbonation add a strange mouthfeel, and quickly fill the stomach with air. Tone down the bubbly and boost the amount of ingredients by a few notches—say, make it 10% ABV—and this will be great beer."
"Very dark brown with a black appearance, two-finger thick light khaki head. Big smoky booziness with a complex arrangement of molasses, heavy cream, ground coffee, bittersweet chocolates, and dark fruits such as figs, cherries and dates come off the aroma. First sip is heavy on the dark fruits, moving into the creamy richness of coffee, bittersweet chocolates and molasses. Hints of smoke and bourbon make their way through into it's medium-sized body. Mildly bitter, rich and complex mouthfeel. Smooth and dry, boozy finish."
"Will pour a five+ finger cream head that fades very slowly to a thin layer leaving a thick lace. Black color, no highlights. Strong carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted malt nose and flavor is malty, bready, fairly smooth. The 7% ABV is totally hidden. $9.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"Mouthfeel is perfect. Full flavor but very soft, gentle feel. Not too carbonated, but it gets a mulligan since its cask. Unbelievably smooth the whole way through with a. Perfect butter bute at the end. Overall a real quality beer. I'm very happy to have tried it on cask."
"Tasty brew, somewhere between a stout, dubble, and quad."
""

"Overall: B+, fun if you can find the right time to drink it."
""
"Overall a very interesting, complex beer. I really enjoyed it and will definitely try it again."
"Overall I really dig this as a unique style and look forward to more throughout the New England seasons. I'm not sure it's listed correctly, so therefore I need to experience this in all three seasons. Me thinks it will work well in spring and fall."

"O- this is a very interesting beer. I am a big fan of the darker beers so this appealed to me. The Belgian dark ale, stout and porter mix is done very well. You can taste and smell each one. Very drinkable beer as well. A bit too carbonated but once it settles it is a winner. I will definitely look out for other Mystic brews."
"Interesting beer, it's sort of middle ground between english stout and belgian dubbel. A nice and different beer from a MA brewery."
""

"Mostly malty (of the darker variety), some near-burnt toast flavors. Thin bodied with higher level of carbonation. The swallow has an element of alcohol warmth along with mild hop."
"This is an interesting, complex beer. There's a lot of different flavors in each sip that work in harmony together. No one flavor dominates."
""
""
"O- First taste of this style. Nothing to compare it to. Not bad. But, nothing I can say that I would rush out for again."
""
"The roasty notes carry over to the taste, with a clear dry finish. Light in body for a stout. Starts off sweet, in the manner of a darker English mild-style beer (aged in cabernet Sauvignon barrels, perhaps? Seems like it strikes a similar flavor profile and mouthfeel to some of the things I’ve tried from Austin’s Jester King) but in a stout-porter hybrid form. Simply wonderful, a great find!"

"Pours the darkest of browns with very faint brown highlights when held to light, a spirited level of carbonation produces a head that fills half the glass no matter how it is poured. Smells of caramel, brown sugar, roasted grains, burnt sugar, dark fruits, yeasty phenols, there's a lot going on here and so far its all good. Taste is dark malts, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, raisins, prunes, plums. This is very complex lots of stuff going on here. Medium to thick body, quite a bit of carbonation, maybe too much, sweet saison-esque mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this beer. The carbonation might be a touch on the high side, but the flavors and aromas are fantastic. I would say this is more of a Belgian strong dark than a stout, but when a beer is done this well who needs labels really?"
"This beer is starting to grow on my, love the tri-hybrid style going on here. Stout & porter with a Belgian flare. A lot of flavor to take in here, a clear sipper as it ends up being super complex. I definitely will be revisiting this beer / future batches."
"Completely opaque black as black can be. No light can be seen though any part of the body. Creamy tan head that holds up nicely. Impeccable head retention and lacing. Really nice looking. Smell is kind of off putting. I can pick up on some dark malts, and light Belgian yeast. Almost has a wine character to the smell. Roasted barley really pulls through on the sip. Much thicker than I expected (which is relieving). Tastes like a stout, just Belgiany. Nice malty aftertaste. Molasses is mild competing against the malt bill. Pretty interesting beer. Oak in hitting the end of the sip. Bitterness in pleasant and suiting. I like it more as I sip on, but this has some odd conflicting flavors in my humble opinion. Interesting concept. Excellent presentation. Look forward to more future beer from Mystic."

"O Nice beer here. A combination of nice flavors but nothing really stood out to me. Slightly over carbonated I felt but not a bad beer."
"It's good. not as good as their saison, but one I enjoyed. I wouldn't be opposed to trying subsequent batches of this beer as it has underlying potential that it seems to fail to cash in on."
"O - Very malty, complex, satisfying beer that is somewhere between a Belgian dubbel and roasty porter."
"overall really interesting, nice dark malts and molasses, light saison flavors, drinkable despite the booze, very interesting and tasty."
"O: A very interesting idea but the execution fell flat unfortunately. It tastes like a really thin porter basically. Some mild belgian influence but nothing really stands out. The watery aspect really lowered the scores too. Unfortunately the taste and mouthfeel just do not match up with the looks and aroma."
"O- I enjoyed the take on this beer. I think the recipe needs to be dialed down and tweaked a bit. Either go bigger with more body or tone down the abv and make this session-able. Lots of potential and worth picking up and trying. My scores slightly reflect the style classification but this beer doesnt and cant fit into any category."
"O. I liked it, not as nice as the Saison but, the yeasty tartness & roasty flavor coupled with the mouthfeel ""carbonation"" make it nicely enjoyable!"
"O - I remember liking this alot more at the tasting I was at. Its still a nice beer, just, not up to par with their saison."
"This is a unique brew. It's a bit like a Belgian strong dark ale without the strong...and less of the Belgian. It's certainly got easy drinking porter qualities. I get what they were going for and I respect the endeavor."
"I picked up a bottle of this today at Bermans in Lexington. Not really sure that this beer fits in to any specific style category, but lets give it a go, and see what happens. The color is quite dark, but just a shade or two away from being black. A nice pillow like white heading perks up right away. Some roast comes through in the beginning of the smell, along with some yeasty tones, chocolate, cola and brown bread. Lots of stone fruit comes through in the flavor initially, with the molasses ending things on a sweet, yet somewhat spiced note. There are some robust notes to it that are found in some dubbels that I am not crazy about, but the yeast they are using here is really alive and in your face. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, with a good level of carbonation, and certainly plenty going on complexity wise. I must say that I was not as taken as some others were with their Saison, but this one really delivered for me. It is very reminiscent of Brooklyn Local 2 if you ask me. Either way, this one gets two big thumbs up from me. Cheers"
"O/D-I love their Saison. I think it may be my favorite Saison. But this one does not impress me at all. The nose is off putting. The flavor is strange. The feel doesn’t match the style well. Just not very good. At $8.50 a bottle, I will finish it. However, I wish I had waited for someone to tell me about this before I tossed out nearly $10 for this one."
"O - Conceptually this is very interesting. A hybrid English Porter/Irish Dry Stout fermented with a saison yeast with molasses too?!? Great idea, excellent execution."
