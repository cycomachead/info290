"Martello Stout is a no-fuss, super approachable stout that still manages to check-off all boxes for the style. English-minded and ringing in at a reasonable 4.8%, it's right in the sweet-spot for a go-to social settings pint and, I believe, is best enjoyed exactly as that."

"Very smooth and easy to drink. Pours a lighter shade of black with minor bubble and just thing lacing. A nose of delicious roasted malts and espresso. Taste follows the nose but adds notes of vanilla offset by bitter cocoa. Exceptional finish with malt coffee linger."
""
"All in all, not a bad beer. The look and smell lead you to believe you are headed for a fantastic experience, and the taste and feel just let you down a little."

"Overall this beer has been worth the wait for me. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the best stout around, but it matches Picaroon's gold medal winning Timber Hog and Gahan's Sydney Street Stout. I'm glad it's in stock here now, it's a great, flavourful English stout."

"O: This is a great stout. It has a balanced bitterness to malt, carbonation is well present yet does not distract from flavours. Flavours are well balanced, non competing, all complementing."

"Overall – A good representation of an English Stout by Garrison. As soon as I got a whiff of this brew’s aromas, I knew I was in for a flavourful stout. Appearance could use a little work (I would have preferred better head retention). One of the better Garrison offerings that I have tried."
"Fantastic...Love Garrison..."
"Would highly recommend this beer and will purchase again whenever I find it..."

"Overall – Definitely an above average stout that reminded me a little of the St Ambroise Oatmeal stout. (which is also good) It's worth trying if you happen to see it. I look forward to trying more beers from this brewer."
"Overall. Good stout. Not too sweet and a little nice smokeyness."
"O - tasty up front but the lingering finish is not ideal, decent but not what I'm looking for in a stout"
"D - I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of stouts, but this one certainly exceeded expectations."
"O - Overall a pretty tasty offering, but by no means one of the best stouts I've tried. Could be a tad sweeter, and the bitterness was a little too much for my liking."
"A dry stout all the way around, and certainly one of the better selections I've tried from Garrison so far, worth checking out."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. There's lots of flavors that keep you entertained. Also with the lower Abv this would be a great session stout."
"Stout is my preferred type of alcoholic beverage, and this one is my personal favorite. This will speak for itself when you try it. I feel that it sets a standard for stout in general. It looks, smells, and tastes exceptional. If you enjoy stout, this is a must to try."
"A pleasant enough old-school stout - lots of approachable flavours, and the lower strength makes for a potential run on the keg, if one had such an opportunity.  For now, though, I'm content with the single serving that has come such a distance within its own country to stand before me."
"Just got this from a private order into Ontario. Pours opaque brown with bubbly tan head. Head retention is pretty average, some mild lacing on the glass though. Smells of huge roasted malt flavour with some mild hop bitterness. Quite sweet, with some roasty bitterness in the flavour. The roast lingers in the aftertaste. Medium body carbonation level. A very nice stout, I'd drink this frequently if this was readily available tome."
"Thanks and cheers Long813"
"Very drinkable. This one was very good... I thought I'd like it, but was surprised at how much I did!"
"Bottle: Poured a opaque black colored stout with a nice foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma is dominated by roasted coffee notes with dry undertones. Taste is also a nice enough mix between some roasted coffee and light black chocolate. Not the most complex beer but well enough brewed and easily drinkable. Body has light creamy texture with good carbonation."
"Pours an inky black with a mocha head atop it that lingers and laces. Fantastic looking beer. A nice stout nose with aromas of roasted barley, licorice and predominantly molasses. The beer has a bitter roasted flavour about it, which is decently balanced by some sweetness in the body. Flavours of molasses and a light breadiness are apparent. The beer doesn't linger long in the mouth, and feels a little thin for a stout, IMO. Enjoyable and nice."
"D: Not a bad stout... slightly lacking in mouthfeel and appearance, but still quite drinkable as it warms. One of the better Garrison beers."
"Overall, a solid seasonal offering from Garrison and one that I would pick up again. In comparison to the American stouts I've had recently, everything from the nose to the taste seems more subdued but at the same time, it seems easier to drink. That's of course due to the different style of stout. Nonetheless, an excellent beer and worth picking up."
"for 4.8% I was pretty impressed by this beer, thanks Long813 for this one, another underrated beer from the east coast"
"D: Very good beer and first of this style for me. Has the characteristics of a dry stout, but the flavour of a American. It's one to try out if you can get your hands on it."
"I bid you peace!"
"D: A great drinker."
"Poured into a mug a jet black, with a thick chocolate colored head. Head evaporate down to about a finger and stuck around, leaving lacing down the glass. Strong scent of malts and toffee. Rich flavor of chocolate, toffee, and roasted coffee. Feels slightly thick, but not really heavy in the mouth. Very smooth overall and quite drinkable."
"Overall, the big, dark roasted flavours feel let down by the overly thin body."
"Very dark brown appearance, thats more or less bordering on black, with a small fizzy tan head. Smoke and toast in the aroma. Smoked and roasted malts in the flavour, with a touch of coffee, lightly cooked bacon and toasted wholewheat bread. After reading this I think I just described my breakfast and not the beer. Carbonation is moderate, but I think the body is a tad light for my liking. This is a highly drinkable stout and appears to be one of the better Garrison offerings... I'd get it again."
"drinkability is good. the bitterness is just a touch high, but feels more like coffee/chocolate than hops, making it seem a little less out of balance. the alcohol actually comes through more than i'd expect for 5% too. overall a pretty solid brew."
"Tastes of roasted malts, sweetness, hop bitterness and molasses. Just a bit thin but still a great brew."
"Pours a clear dark brown, almost black, some red in the edges, very healthy looking thick tan head forms, quickly settles down to a thin layer, no lacing. Smell is nice, sweet malt, caramel, roast, chocolate, some dark fruits, coffee, very nice for a light stout. Taste is a little watery, caramel, chocolate, some decent roast, licorice, bit of butter in the finish, quite light. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Aroma is solid, but I've noticed with a lot of Garrison the flavour is a bit weak. Still very serviceable stout and one I would be happy to have access to all the time. Thanks Greg!"
"Thanks to NASH for the bottle!"
"Looks like a great stout, pitch black color with a brown head. Foam lasts forever and leaves nice thick lace trails. Smell is filled with coffee, chocolate and cocoa. ther earthy tones. Rich flavors, including chocolate and coffee. Roasted grain and some smokiness, a nice touch of bitterness at the end. As mentioned by other, the mouthfeel might be a bit thin, but hardly something to complain about. Still smooth and a bit creamy. One of Garrison's better beers I have had the priveledge of trying. Thanks for the trade and the chance to drink this one."
"Pours brown with tiny head. Some coffee grounds watered down with some beer. Somewhat dark brown, little flavour. I could not finish. Marginally drinkable stout. Bitter more than sweet. Somewat astringent instant coffee aftertaste and breath. Thanks TomThompson98 for my request. Four months later, NEAL's bottle, a malty sweet coffee dry stout, and review is a blend between the two."
"Final Statement: The best of Garrison's brews for sure. Could be thicker and more flavorful, but definately not bad."
"D: A very good brew. Yes, I do believe I will have another. Yum."
"Appearance is similar to the bottled version: very dark with slight hints of a lighter, red tinged brown at the edges. The head, however is much more substantial than the bottled version, and a few shades lighter. As a result the beer looks rather better than the other serving type. The smell is very similar, but slanted more toward the coffee side and with a hint of woodiness. The taste is again more coffee influenced than I remember the bottle, and with the same woody tones as the smell, which were also absent in the bottle. Mouthfeel is good, creamy and rich, and the drinkability is very good. I think it's a bit better on tap."
"This is a nice stout, though its anything but dry. I recommend it and the next time Im in Halifax Ill get it again."
