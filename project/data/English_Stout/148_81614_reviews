"Not great. Tastes a little off, and it doesn't have the roast I expected."
""

"Mouthfeel is very thin and watery, with a light body and almost no carbonation. This is a light, easy drinking session stout with limited flavor but high drinkability. It was alright overall, with its looks being the most impressive part of this brew."

"A disappointingly weak stout, too sessionable."
""
"Pours a solid pitch black in color with a good 1/2 finger creamy off-white head that actually lasts the whole drink. Pours like a Guinness, in layers from the nitro cap that is in the bottom of the can (does not move around though). A good amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted malts and black coffee. Bit more going on with the taste with a hint of dark chocolate in the mix as well. Finished with the roasted malts BUT isn't strong nor harsh at all. Very smooth finish actually as I wasn't sure of how this brew would end up. Lighter+ bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, I really liked this brew."

"Think this is much better on draft than canned. Rich roasty malt, dark chocolate notes, becoming fairly bitter and lightly charred at the finish. Nutty malt forms the backbone, and that nitro mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Only detracting quality is a lightly metallic finish."

"3.53/5: Semi-impressive session stout, easy to drink and easy to like"

"Final Grade: 3.36, a B-. Belhaven Black Scottish Stout is not an especially memorable beer, but as far as nitro stouts go it's nothing to shy away from. It has a nicely balanced flavour, and anyone who has had a nitro beer before will already know if they'll like the smooth mouthfeel of this one (or not). This sells for slightly less than a 4-pack of Guinness (in this market), and I'd certainly recommend it to any fans of that brew seeking out something similar."

"Overall, while the aroma and appearance were both appealing, the roasted malt and associated flavors that I expected were anticlimactic. Not bad though; wouldn't mind having it again."
"Overall quite a decent brew, easy drinking and refreshing. I remember having this on tap in Scotland and it being a little heavier and richer."

"04/05/13 On tap (nitro). Usual smoothness from most nitro pours. Extremely light body but not watery. Aroma is subtle & indicative of the shy flavor profile. Nice balance of sweet & bitter. No hint of the contemporary adds of vanilla/coffee/chocolate, etc. Listings show conflicting ABV but this tastes shy so I'll assume it's @ 4.5%. If that's the case I could see this as a pleasant session companion."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a while if youâ€™re in the mood for the style."

"The aftertaste is lovely and pleasant. I think could drink a few of these (especially since it isn't very strong), and although I waited 57 years to have one a Belhave, the next ones will come soon and frequent."
"Canning this beer was a smart move, as who knows how long it took to get here by ship. I generally tend to buy local first, but sometimes I like to try stuff from abroad as well. This one was a very good choice. The sessionability of the low ABV is a big plus for such a flavorful, enjoyable beer."

"Obviously I like this stuff. From hearing the widget releasing its contents to watching the head build in the 18 oz glass it is a wonderful and beautiful experience. Regarding taste it is much the same as similar products from Guinness and Murphy's, typical good quality Irish style dry stout that just taste wonderful from start to finish. Everytime I open one I say to myself on the last drink, ""Damn I'm gonna miss this brew."" It may be my imagination but I think Belhaven Black pours with more action and the head and lacing holds up till the last drop."

"When it comes to the stouts of the British Isles, Ireland still wins my vote. That being said, I would certainly take Belhaven Black 'Scottish Stout' over that most famous (but awfully overrated) export, Guinness. This offering is far more flavourful and a much better option for a night of continuous pints - the Scottish can drink as well as the Irish after all."

"Overall a pretty nice dry, English Stout. Perhaps lacking the more charred malt aspect of some of its counterparts but very nice."
"The mouthfeel is the main focus here: it is light, sweet and creamy; in fact, it is rather addictive should you get the chance and find one. I am a big fan of Belhaven; be it there Wee Heavy or Wee Whatever, this is a great brewery and anything from there aresenal that can be found will not be a beer to regret."

"Overall: A solid stout in a nitro can. Not bad, but not particularly exciting. I personally would have enjoyed a slightly heavier, more viscous body."
""

"Overall... a very nice stout, bitterness is present in a light style, refreshing beer too because is not full bodied as other stouts and taste is rich but moderate, perfect for summertime"

"OVERALL: A well made nitro stout, which has enough genuine flavor to stand up to its competitors."
""
""
"Poured into a Guiness pint glass jet black with a creamy nitro cascading light beige head atop.Aromas are light with chocolate mocha notes and a bit of tin.Although the nitro pour gave off a creaminess in the head it was really thin,even for the the style.Flavors of dark roast coffee,bitter chocolate and earth,mild flavors with a thin feel is not the best thing in the world.I was expecting better from a pretty good brewery but this just okay."
""
"For me it was something of a novelty as there are not that many nitro-CANned beers out there, bit CANversely, I am a hophead, so something like this is really not my cup of tea. Not bad, but for me, a once and done."
"Poured from a 14.9 oz. nitro can. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is dominated by coffee. Taste is of coffee and roasted malts, smooth and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is not overly flavorful for a stout, but a pretty good beer nonetheless."
"But this is good and I can definitely see buying a case. Well done."
""
""
"Pours a pitch black with creamy nitro head. Smell is of roasted malts, cream, and chocolate. Taste is heavy on roasted barley and chocolate malt with mellow caramel sweetness around the edges. Mouthfeel is smooth, dense, and velvety. Overall, easy drinking with decent presence of flavor."
""
""
"Dark brown in color with an attractive cascading waterfall effect leading to a permanent slab of a head, just as it should. Mild nutty and toasted malt aromas with hints of sweet bread and fudge. A little prune and tobacco as it warms. Coffee bean, cocoa, and black malt flavors...all very, very mellow...a little watery even, though there is an expected creaminess at the same time. All in all, it does come across as thin, but it's still certainly enjoyable. Drinkable to the max too."
"A so-so English Stout. What the nitro promotes in the feel makes flavor sacrificial."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy khaki head that settles to a dense cap on top of the beer. A curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and coffee ground aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder and coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice aromas but more subtle flavors in my opinion."
"O: I would drink it, but I prefer my stouts to be a little more rich, even if under 5%. Not a bad start for someone who is new to the style."

"Dark enough that I couldn't see through it with minimal head for a stout. The roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate flavours came as little surprise after a strong coffee nose. I thought this was quite well balanced with a decent hoppy edge, but unfortunately too much coffee for my taste."
"The taste followed the smells, with liquorice added for good measure. Mellowed as it warmed; a bit harsher when first poured, but it turned into a fine beer in the end."
""
"On Cask at Whey Pat, St andrews. Dark Brown/Black, with a little lace and whispy film. Aroma of mocha, and a slight roastiness. Taste has a good roast malt presence with a dry bitterness, this carries on to the finish, mostly dry bitterness and malt. Not much complexity, and the mouthfeel is bitter and slightly watery, its on the light end in terms of stout body, easy-drinking though and good and dry. Fairly average stout, gets the job done, but I would get it again soon."

"A pretty basic stout in most departments really, it was drinkable but nothing stood out or was particularly enjoyable. Not a beer I'll be having again."

"Would it be a heresy to say it had more of a dunkel feel to it than a stout :S"
