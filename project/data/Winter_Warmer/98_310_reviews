"I like this beer for the winter time"
""
""
""
"This beer is like drinking a glass of french toast, and not in a good way. Too Sweet"
"Pretty bad spiced beer with too much going on."
""
""
"Overall:  I really enjoyed this beer, as it has great flavors of gingerbread, spices and malt.  Extremely tasty.  Recommended."
""
""
"Looks good but thats about it, reeks of spices that overpowers, med. to lght feel offer not much to be enjoyed"
""
"A Very good beer tasty"
""
""
"I love this beer with dessert. Cinnamon and nutmeg warms my belly!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of mild nutmeg, cinnamon, & toasted malt, cereal. Taste sweet malt, slight nutmeg, brown sugar. Not bad!"
""
""
""
""
"Mild coffee notes in the nose followed by a nice smooth full bodied brew with a good coffee and cinnamon flavor.  Definitely a cold weather ale but very good."
"Not good. Review is redundant. Words for nothing."
"Spice bomb, very thin, very unimpressive."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice copper with a white head. The smell is full of cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste has those spices in the beginning but then mellows into the toasted malt which I thought gave a nice finish to the beer. SImple but effective."

"Easy on palate. Clove. Nutmeg. Sweet but light."
""
""
""
"Amazing winter beer worth a try for sure on draft"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark ruddy brown. Cinnamon and cloves heavy on the nose. Lighter bodied than I expected. Flavor is strong, straight forward winter spicing, a little cinnamon-sugary. Not terrible, but not my favorite. Became more and more cloying as I went."

"Overall:  Personally this beer was not at all to my tastes; way too sweet and too many spices.  Tasted more like a heavily spiced cider than a beer to me.  I thought it was one of the worst beers that I ever tasted.  But my brother - who bought it - loves it.  So it has it fans; I am definitely not one.  I guess I have learned this Fall that I don't really care for most apple, pumpkin or cinnamon/nutneg spiced beers in general."

"O: While I'm generally a malt fan, I am a fan of well-executed malt. This beer seems either simple but poorly integrated, or an attempt at being complex that did not quite gel. It's not terrible, but it is right around average."

"Taste is, again, heavy on the spices. This one's not too sweet, but definitely a mellow sipper. With all the warm spices, Harpoon's Winter Warmer effectively and accurately captures the spirit of wintertime and holiday vibes. Solid and well-done."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours light brown/red with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of winter spices, a tad of cinnamon. Tastes of cinnamon in my mouth with carbonation. Beer is not overly drinkable for its light body but overpowering spices. Overall a below average beer."

"I really don't understand the ratings on here, very good winter beer. Had this poured out of the bottle into a pint glass. The beer is very sweet, but I don't think excessively so given the genre. Someone syrupy, but again, not overly so for a warmer. There was a thickness to it as well that was good. A good deal of spices going into it as well. I think Harpoon just kind of went for it with this one, and I think it paid off."

"O - Not my style, too sweet, but I could see someone liking this. It's not what I'd expect from a Winter Warmer however. Not thick enough and too sweet."
""
""
"overall; i think I've said enough, i'll just add that i excpected a lot more from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this 2013 vintage, I think the Bros need to revisit. Starts out with a great nose of cinnamon and slight vanilla notes. Mouthfeel is a little lacking but not bad. I may be partial to winter style but this is very tasty. Strong maltiness with a great balance of spice and warmth. Enjoyable!!"

" The taste has a nice presence of spice with a slight caramel and fruity yeast flavor. The taste is very festive with a warming (go figure) amount of alcohol yet pretty smooth in the middle with the spice lasting after the swallow with some woody aspects of cinnamon with a nice spice-cake like malty dark sugar element. Overall this is pretty great it seems appropriate as the weather cools off I could see myself enjoying this with a hearty stew since the spice is not too much that it overwhelms the malt foundation."

"Harpoon Winter Warmer (2013) - 5.9% ABV. Amber brown body. Slight carbonation. Good head with strong retention. Nice lacing. Citrus, cinnamon, and nutmeg aromas. A bit of cranberry bread. Malty gingerbread cookie nose. Light wet mouth. Apple crisp mid-palate. No alcohol notes. No ale notes either. Fades cleanly into back palate. A bit of bubblegum hops and a tang of cider. More cinnamon and a bit of peppermint. Very not beer like. Almost like drinking a cookie baked with rum. Very odd. Good though. Would go well with dessert or after dinner. Could be off putting with a meal and definitely not a session beer. Definitely has a holiday feel to it as promised. 3.2 out of 5. Average."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not an awful beer. The taste itself is good, but they need to take it down a bit on the cinnamon, and kick the body up a bit. Not a bad Winter Warmer, but there are better versions. Overall not bad, but not something I'd ever buy."
""
""

"Ok, this is actually pretty good in its bones with some real winter spices but it is so weak and watery that I simply can't rate this highly."

"O: Fairly underrated in my book. It's not great per se (nose notwithstanding), but I wouldn't be averse to having this again. In a way, I'm glad Harpoon went for the 'unsubtle, hop-devoid spice bomb route' with this instead of the 'wassail meets Arrogant Bastard' route. This is NOT for everyone, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: The taste definitely doesn't live up to the promise of the smell. A kind of weak and watery spiced flavor that brings a touch of sourness. Some bread and a touch of pecan pie. An interesting warmer, but probably not one to revisit."
"All in all, not bad, especially in the winter in CT (it's 15°F for a high today, before the 20 MPH wind chill)."
""
""
"Looked and smelled great, tasted and felt so-so. If the taste (especially) fell more in line with the promise of the aroma, this would have been a decent enough beer overall. Unfortunately, the relatively high quality appearance and scents can't make up for a rather dismal and disappointing taste (and, to me, that's the key component of any beer's appeal). Fair at best, and rather forgettable overall."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/15/2013. Pours slightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, prune, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, toast, biscuit, clove, and light herbal hops. Nice aromas with good strength and solid balance; very fruity and malty, with a fair amount of spices. Taste of caramel, raisin, prune, brown sugar, cinnamon, toast, nutmeg, ginger, bread, light banana, light clove, and light herbal. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, dark fruits, brown sugar, cinnamon, toast, nutmeg, ginger, bread, light banana, light clove, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Solid flavor balance and complexity; a big malt backbone and light complimenting spices; with minimal cloying flavors present on the finish. A little bland on flavor as well. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a decent winter warmer. Moderate spicing and big maltiness with minimal cloying; and quite smooth to drink. A fairly enjoyable offering."
""
"Overall: While the scores don't look particularly good individually, this beer isn't all that bad...it's drinkable and it does have a good flavor, it just lacks in many areas...the smell and taste are pretty one dimensional and the body is too watery, leaving what taste there is gone before i can really get into it...it has potential for more if harpoon wanted that, but as it is, one is nice, but there certainly won't be another...(2/5)"
""
""
""
""
"Very nice scent. It smells like a busy holiday party kitchen full of gingerbread cookies and spice cake. Everything else about it is mediocre, though. A thin, watery mouth feel and a fleeting, vaguely spicy-sweet taste. I would like this beer if the taste were stronger, but it simply isn't. Oh well."
"I liked it, but it is not beer I would want to have more than one at a time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer did not deliver on the basics."
""
""
""
"It pours a clear copper/crimson color. The head is gone in a flash leaving no lacing and no residual bubbles. It smells of holidy spices(cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove.), and some fruity esters, Banana? Smells like banana bread with extra spice. The taste is more or less the same, with a slight acidic tinge that fades away to a sweet malty finish. There is a Very mild/dry bitterness also present. It features a medium bodied mouth-feel with way too much carbonation. Not my favorite."
""
""
"Overall: The spice cake character of this beer is very well done but that is just about all there is to this beer; I enjoyed the first few sips but after a while I became tired of the sweetness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Off-white head, moderate to low retention, on a deep copper body. Mainly clear lacing. Aroma includes cinnamon, caramel malts, nougat and nutmeg. Taste is pumkiny, caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Actually pretty tasty combination of flavors and very easy to drink."
""
""
"O: I, again, have had this beer a time or two. (Sorry, if my review makes it seem like the first time, but I wanted that insinuation) So having bought it on numerous occasions, I think my tohughts speak for themselves. This is the beer you don't have to hoard or gloat about. This is not your beer to sit and ponder and worship. This is your beer to enjoy slowly and socially. An average beer with just enough going on for it to raise it above the competition."
""
"O: Pretty well balanced between the malts and the hops but there is just a little too much cinnamon/nutmeg spiciness to this brew to be easy to drink. Enjoyable but this is not a beer that I want to drink a couple of...this is a one and done beer for me."
"Overall meh, syrupy and sticky, icky bitterness, dominating spices, all wouldn't be great on their own but together even worse."
""
""
""
""
"Harpoon's Winter Warmer pours a fairly clear amber, with some orange highlights showing through. Maybe two fingers of cream colored foam crown the beer, with just a bit each of head retention and lacing. The nose has a potent burst of cinnamon and nutmeg, very pumpkin pie like. There's also a biscuity malt aroma present as well. The flavor profile isn't as robust, especially when it comes to the spicing, There's a bit of toasty bread and caramel up front, followed by a light, balancing bitterness. The spices come in for the finish, and they're just not nearly as lively as I would have anticipated given the nose. The body is just a touch on the thin side, but the carbonation has a good bit of pep to it. Despite a nice aroma, Harpoon's Winter Warmer is just a passable offering."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It’s not a bad brew, but not really a “warmer”. It lacks the body and feel as well as abv to be considered a winter warmer in my book. I would consider it more a spiced ale. Not the best, but easy drinking and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, this beer is one I will not revisit."
"O. I bought this as a one off and I will prob never try it again."
"O - Interesting and fun, but this is over the top on the spices. For people that really love cinnamon flavors this is going to be a very good beer. I think they could have toned this down."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty enjoyable beer. Not sure this is for everyone, but if you like cinnamon or gingersnaps, chances are you will dig this."
""
""
""
"O: If you like spiced beers, then this one will fit your niche nicely. Otherwise, I'd stay clear of this one. I enjoy the spices this time of the year, so I am enjoying this one. Wouldn't really care for it any other time of the year though. Again though, use discretion with purchasing if you don't like spiced brews"
""
""
"surprised to see this rated so low. the pour is clear dark copper in color, with a really disappointing white head. the nose is more fall spice than winter, with cinnamon and clove, similar to a pumpkin beer, but the flavor reveals a nice sweet caramely malt profile, which holds up the spice well. its wintery with the spices loaded on the back end, and the sweetness of the malt all the way through. finish is really clean for the style. mouthfeel is okay, a little thin in body, i would like this even more with a bigger dose of malts. the carbonation is fine though, and this one is pretty easy drinking. my problem with it is the abv, i like to see a bit stiffer of a winter warmer, something to really warm me, and this takes too many to do that job. thats my most severe critique of an otherwise quite palatable brew."
""
""
"A most appropriate beer to kick off this holiday season. Would enjoy this more if the temperature outside was about fifteen degrees colder. One of my girlfriend's favorite winter seasonals, and one of my favorite Harpoon ales."
""
""
"Is a ""winter warmer"" under 6% ABV actually gonna warm you in any appreciable sense? In any case, this stuff pours a clear sunset copper topped by a finger of sandy cream foam. The nose comprises ginger, clove, brown sugar, light toffee, banana, and candied orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with the focus heavily now on the spices, particularly the clove and brown sugar, which end up o'erwhelming all else. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slick feel, and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, not a bad winter warmer, but a decidedly one-dimensional one."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light bodied. Goes down just fine."
""
"Poured a ruby-tinged medium brown with a miniscule head that dissipated almost instantaneously. Needless to say no lacing. Strong smell of cinnamon. Taste was like a watered down diet cherry soda. Mouthfeel was also thin and soda-like. Give this one a pass."
""
""
"O: This is a solid winter beer, however it would not be my first choice when choosing a beer of this style"

"O: Tasty winter warmer – very smooth and enjoyable."
"O- not a bad take on the hearty spicy winter warmer style. The only major problem for me was the pudding like feel. Overall all it tasted fine and was par forth style"
""
""
""
"Overall-this beer is a miss, plenty of better options on this style. Harpoon overloaded it with candied sugar and the mix doesn’t taste well. Stay away."
""
""
"(12 oz. into pint) Poured a deep, dark copper with a one finger head and great retention on the glass. Aroma was strong of the winter spices, especially cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as a slight citrus underneath. Definitely warming, but not as much as others in the style, having a lower ABV than I am used to with these. The flavor was strong of the cinnamon up front, with a slight hop and nice malty sweetness at the finish. Definitely one I will find again next season."
""
"O: I wouldn't drink it again. It feels very empty and unsatisfying."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass. The smell and flavor is exactly like others I have had of this style, it just seems a little weaker. Lots of cinnamon-ish spices in the flavor, along with some bitter and malty flavors as well. Overall, this is a decent beer, but I have definitely had better ones in this style."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing special here. Fine to try during the season but probably better on tap"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle with a pry-off cap, served in a standard pint tap glass."
""
"LOVE the FLAVOR! but very unusual"
""
""
""
"Overall: this beer is appropriately flavored for the winter season. For what it is trying to be it is actually very good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brownish red with an off white head that fades fast. Smell is mostly nutmeg with the cinnamon and malt present as well. Taste follows with the nutmeg being the star. The flavor is not complex but is nice. The flavors are not too overpowering, this one won't get annoying after a few. Mouthfeel is medium, but could have had more depth. Overall a good winter warmer, decent flavors, a better mix a flavor could put this over the top."

"In the derby for bad beer from the most over-hyped East-cast brewer, until now I held that any brew from Sam Adams would by default take the trophy. Now I stand corrected: Boston Brewing must now share said trophy with Harpoon. This winter warmer ranks among the flattest, flavorless, most aromaless beer on today's market, and it's a fine addition to all of the other flavorless, aromaless beer that Harpoon brews. The only thing separating this beer from a glass of water is the price."

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
"O: The beer is easy to drink compared to others in the style but could use more complexity and fuller-bodied nature to make it more of a beer that can be enjoyed while sipped."
""
""
""
"This was my first winter warmer years ago when I was living in Boston. I remember it being fantastic. Maybe I've become more snobbish, but I find it to be rather simple and a little unrefined now. It's still a decent, drinkable beer, but it's somehow now one dimensional and a little forgettable for me."
"This beer poured out as a dark amber color with a white head on top. the lacing was minimal along with the retention. the smell of the beer had some spicy notes on the nose along with some sweet malts. The taste of the beer reminded me too much a pumpkin ale, I felt that their spice choice might have been a little off here. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad but still pretty average. Overall this isn't something I'd go oout of my way to have again. There are some better choices out there in my opinion."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, pale, clear, copper coloring with a thin, off-white head that is very low profile. Slight cling to the glass as the beer moves around. A muddled aroma of spices, with nutmeg, cinnamon, and all-spice on the nose, and a slight caramel malt in the background. The flavors are a burnt malt sweetness, with only a little bit of the spicing coming through, and an awkward hopping. The flavors end up a bit jumbled, and overly sweet to the point of tangy. The beer is a little light bodied for the style, and it leaves a slick, oily finish. There is a tangy caramel aftertaste that hangs on the palate, almost to the point of becoming sour. Not my favorite for the style, nor from Harpoon."
"Not the boldest of winter warmers but still satisfying. This beer is a staple in my fridge each winter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Kind of a shallow winter warmer. It has some nice spice notes but not much of a malt body. I don't really dig the amber base."
"O: When I think of a beer that is perfect for Christmas all around, I think of Harpoon Winter Warmer. It is impressive that you can make a beer that tastes and smells so much like the holidays, and since it is not very heavy it is fine for family members who are not accustomed to drinking heavy/tasteful beers."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer isn't great for the style. I would like it to warm me a bit when I drink some. I used to love to have this every time the holidays roll around, but we've grown apart a little bit."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at The Office. Pours dark amber hue with a thick off-white head and some lacing. Aroma is of cinnamon, cloves, some caramel and peppery hops. Medium, smooth body. Taste is of cinnamon, cloves, some caramel, cherry fruit and peppery hops. Nice holyday brew."
""
"Overall its not bad. I'd probably pick it up again when i want something winter-style that isn't super heavy or overbearing with its flavor."
""
""
"O: Overall a nice offering from Harpoon smooth and silky, great taste."
""
""
""
""
"could definitely be better though"
""
"O: Not my favorite winter warmer. I prefer the more robust warmers than the spiced ones."
""
""
""
""
"O-I thought, ""Harpoon really doesn't make anything bad, I'll give it a go on a single for cheap"" poor choice. Almost like they left an overly spiced pumpkin ale sit and go bad. Not that good of a beer. Would not go near again."
""
"Overall - too much spicing, especially the nutmeg."
"D- This is a lot like the overspiced pumpkin beers that are made by most breweries, but with even less complexity and really just one note of cinnamon. There's nothing to hate but unless you're a big cinnamon person stay away. Made me crave Stegmeier Winter Warmer for all the things that this one was not."
"Overall: I have been drinking this beer for years. Not to bad, but can only have a few due to getting full over the course of a night. Still a nice beer that warms you up like the name applies."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber color, off white head and little retention. Spice rack aroma of cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg and clove. In the taste, lots of spice, ranging from dry nutmeg, pepper, cinnamon and clove. Astringent bitterness and lingering spice embedding itself in the palatte. Malt body is slightly sweet and almost tangy. Mouthfeel is dominated by a wave of spices on a chewy, medium bodied brew. Overall, if you really love highly spiced beer, this fits the bill."
"Overall, this is one of my favorites from all 30 or so winter beers that I've tried so far."
""
""
""
"Pours a leather/tan color with a good amount of foam. They promise cinnamon on the bottle and boy, does this brew have it! Cinnamon aromas, balanced by some nutmeg, allspice and a nice sweetness, come through when smelled. The cinnamon takes center stage, flavorwise, but it’s braced by a pleasing, thick malt backbone. Some harshness around the edges. Warms well, true to its name. Just not very exciting, or interesting."
""
"Overall - I guess the beer is exactly as you would expect it to be reading from the label.. but this just isn't my style of my beer."
"Fairly average winter warmer. Grab one if you like lots of spice."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer but lacks the full body and warming quality that I enjoy in a Winter Warmer. Glad I scored this in a case swap and didn't purchase an entire case."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 1.5"" light custard head. Clear body but deep amber in color. Smell is light but has malt as well as the promised cinnamin and nutmeg. Taste mirrors the smell. Body is creamy though medium-light weight. Finish is very subtle but has a good lifespan. Although not beyond average I don't understand they anyone would hate this beer to score it below average."
""
""
""
""
"D: This beer is not a standout for Harpoon and certainly one to avoid if you do not already like this style much. The spices should be tweaked and in my opinion, this beer tasted a bit better as it warmed."
""
"O: a decent winter warmer, nothing spectacular but would have it again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing about this sticks out as bad, it's just not good. Too mild and watery. No warmth."

"Overall this a decent winter warmer. Nothing spectacular but certainly not terrible. I won't turn one down of its offered to me that's for sure."
"The mouthfeel is well-carbonated and very drying. The drinkability is a bit below average, the high spicing wears a bit against this. Overall, this is an average brew. It's interesting enough to keep drinking, but not good enough to really want to see again. Funnily enough, I let my roommate have a sip of this after he pulled a Harpoon Oktoberfest out of the fridge, and he said that it's ""good. Actually, really fucking good."" That's beer for you! Guess the second one out of this winter sampler can be his."

"Overall I assume something is a-miss with this beer since reviews don't like its really not that palatable. Pass..."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best by date of 2-15-12. This pours a nice brown ale with a foamy off white head. The smells are very good, cinnamon, nutmeg and maybe banana. The feel is medium with decent carbonation. The taste is a major disappointment, a little of the spices, but mostly an odd bitterness (not a hop bitterness which would be good), and its mostly light, I didn't expect this."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer, but I hope that my wife likes it as I am not a real big fan of spiced beers, and this one is obviously spiced. It is still drinkable, and if you like spiced beers it really isn't too bad. Once I get through this six-pack, I doubt that I will ever need to come back to this one."
"Overall - I actually liked this one. It's right on that edge of using too much spice and going way out of balance, but I thought it stayed within the margins. Perhaps not as traditional as the typical winter warmer, but not too bad."
"Overall-I enjoyed this beer. I'm looking forward to grabbing a sixer when the 2011 comes out."
"Unfortunately, such an aftertaste doesn't prove as wanted as might be expected, instead leaving a slightly stale, earthy flavor on the tongue--as if I'd eaten a quarter teaspoon of mixed and dried nutmeg and cloves, but didn't have a glass of water to wash it down. Which is a pity, since the ale had been rather nice up to that point."
"But damn, its like eating/drinking the decorative placement at Thanksgiving/Christmas. So dang overwhelming, its like take Anchor Christmas and increase it tenfold. No subtlety. Totally dominates what appears to be a thin base, they just dumped the adjuncts (not necessarily cheap adjuncts) by the truck into this one. If only the malt bill were higher, the spice/cinnamon might not be so dreadful, but with nothing to counterbalance it, your mouth feels like someone put cinnamon and holley in your mouth."
"I like a good spicy winter warmer, but this is just a little too thin compared to other beers of the style that are more pronounced. I like a winter warmer to be bursting with flavor, and while this does have alot of flavor, it's thinned out a bit in the body. But still drinkable overall."
"Overall: Overall the beer was a bit of a disappointment. The smell and appearance were good and then the flavor had too many spicy cinnaomny notes for me. The strange aftertaste and combination of spices turned me off to this beer."
"I could not finish the bottle. I would imagine a few of these would leave one feeling a bit iffy due to the over the top sweetness and flavor profile."
"D - Pretty drinkable. However, the spices really dominate. I like the idea of cinnamon in the beer, but in this case it just takes over the other flavors completely."
"D-overly spiced and definitely some left over sugars hanging around. complexity and subtly completely lost here."
"Overall I was not a fan of this brew. The spices were just way to overpowering and they didn't let any other flavors or aromas come through. There was just no balance to this beer and that is exactly what it needed. This was my first Harpoon brew and I was pretty disappointed, but I am still down to try other beers from them just not their winter warmer. I won't be buying this again and I don't recommend it to anyone who respects their taste buds."
"In the end, there was really no saving grace for this beer. It didn't have any kind of convincing flavor to it; at the same time, the mishmash of flavors it did have totally covered up everything that is enjoyable about beer in the first place."
"D: It tastes like a delicious fall or early winter dessert."
"My expectations first drinking this beer were non existent, I knew nothing about it and a friend offered it. I poured a pint of it and thought it was fantastic, I have and will once again purchase this beer."
"Harpoon stayed true to the winter warmer style with much spices added to this beer. It poured a very clear honey color. Aromas of mostly cinnamon, some nutmeg, and baked apples came about upon first smell. The taste was overpoweringly cinnamon, which produced a slight heat on my taste buds. This did not leave too much room for any other flavor besides a little hop bitterness to even things out a little. This brew is definitely for cinnamon lovers and spice addicts with a little cold weather drinkability."
"Not my favorite winter warmer but not bad either. A bit strong with the cinnamon if you ask me."
"I'm a little surprised at the overall average of reviews. My wife and I had this for the first time on tap in NYC a few years back it we were blown away. It's litterally Christmas in a glass. We look forward to every Winter to get this. It's surprisingly dark, great spice, good mouth-feel. I have a sweet tooth and am partial to sweeter beers, so maybe that why I enjoy this more than some. I can usually handle up to 3 before needing something less sweet. Either way, a delicious beer I will enjoy each winter."
"D: Incredibly drinkable; even my girlfriend who doesn't like beer could stand this. However, that being said, it has nothing much to save it from being bland either."
"Drinkability - The taste is not horrible and will certainly leave you feeling warm and comfortable inside. Overall, a bit sweet for my liking. Best to enjoy one or two when relaxing on a cold night. Makes me feel festive."
"very easy to kick back a few of these. i wouldnt go out of my way to get it again, but if offered, i owuldnt refuse. overall kind of a mellow winter warmer, but i bet this was top notch back in 1988."
"Verdict - I do not recommand this beer at all. I honestly don't understand what the brewer had in mind. Although, I found a potential use to it: it could be good for marinating meat in order to make a meatpie for christmas next year."
"I can't wait to get more of this next Christmas!"
"D: Not your usual hefty & heavy spiced seasonal. It has some of the expected notes - spices and toasty, caramelly malts, but it is done in a refreshing manner. Probably better with food than as a stand alone. As a session beer, the spice load start to hurt it despite the relatively modest abv. Nice enough for what it is though."
"Verdict - I didn't hate it; but I also didn't love it. It seemed like a bunch of spices were just poured into a vat and mixed together with eggnog. A decent holiday drink, but don't expect a 'beer' out of this one."
"I am not sure that I've had a beer this bad before. This is actually just offensive for me to drink. Maybe I had a bad sample, but the aftertaste and finishing this one of one of the more difficult things to do."
"Drinkability - This is a very easy beer to drink. It's not filling and would be a nice introductory ""Christmas"" beer. It's ok and I wouldn't turn it down. I do like the fact that it's not over run with over the top spices and flavors as so many Winter Seasonals can be. Just an easy going beer."
"Overall, this palate has medium carbonation, and a thin watery palate that doesn't fit the style very well."
"Very well carbonated and leaves a spicy after taste. Goes down pretty easy and overall is a very good winter beer."
"Note: I just wanted to note that I remember having this beer a couple years ago (~2007) and thinking it was terrible. Either my tastes have changed or the recipe did, either way I am happy with it."
"My overly aggressive pour not only caused a wee bit of spill-over, but also netted me two fingers' worth of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a solid copper (no amber at all) with NE-quality clarity. Beautiful! Nose had notes of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. Suddenly, I was hungry for some fresh-baked gingerbread cookies. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a nice spiciness on the tongue. It reminded me of making cookies and baking bread with my maternal grandmother when I was just a lad. Lovely sticky lacing began to appear as the liquid level decreased in my glass. Finish allowed the cinnamon to really shine and it lingered well after the initial swallow. This was great on this cold day with intermittent flurries."
"In fact, the spices are so overbearing that you won't even notice that there's any alcohol in this. Like your Aunt's fruitcake that sits in the fridge waiting to be given away, this may take space in your stash of beer until it's just time to get rid of it. It's not a drain pour but unless you're a die-hard fan of this style, you'll say ""you shouldn't have...no, really"" when someone gives this to you. There's nothing like this on the market and it's worth a try once but only because words cannot fully do this justice. To talk about a beer like this requires knowledge, patience, and bravado. Thankfully, I only bought one bottle so there won't be any need for me to repackage it and pass it off to anyone else who has yet to experience the surprise lurking once the cap is off."
"D - Drinkability would be higher if it wasn't for all the spice. This beer finished off a sixer over about two months. So clearly not a fast drinker. Haha."
"A surprising overall favorite of my beer evaluation sessions focusing on winter/christmas brews. Poured from 12 oz bottle into a dimpled mug. Pours an amber body with an inch of off-white head that quickly recedes to a rim of froth. Strong nasal essence of cinnamon and other zesty spices. Some of the spices remain in the flavor, but the body, which is surprisingly watery, threw me for a loop. This could be a better brew if the body was beefed up a bit. Flavors include orange peel, nutmeg, more cinnamon, allspice, gingerbread, and subtle firewood. Thin body and soft/medium carbonation. Again, for a winter warmer, this brew definitely needs some more body."
"D - This turned out to be a surprise most pleasant. I usually try not to, but I had read the reviews before I bought it. I enjoyed this one however and might have to pick up a few more before they disappear."
"Overall: This beer could be fantastic if it could control some of its spicy characteristics. It has a nice nose, and some great initial flavor, but the heavy spice disrupts the balance of the beer."
"The Rest: Body is thin, a lot of carbonation, and drinkability is so-so. The gingerbread taste/aroma really dominates, but then the finishes pretty weak. Not the best winter warmer I've ever had."
"light bodied mouthfeel... a bit thin... average carbonation. goes down easy enough but the spices wear on you, making this one not tremendously drinkable."
"This beer looks good. A nice clean clear caramel colored beer with a nice head, good retention and a nice head. An overly spiced aroma. The beer is even more overly spiced, in a gross way. To much xmas spices, slightly chewy. Just not good. Bad mouth-feel. I cant drink this."
"This is moderately drinkable though I wouldn't want more than one due to its below par taste."
"You mileage might vary, but if you like cinnamon and don't mind it being the star of the show - this beer is for you."
"Not the most complex beer, but more than worth a try. Delicious."
"D - Not that bad, but I don't find myself wanting more. Not a bad beer but not a great one"
"D - The spices are just to much to drink many of these. The two from the winter pack will be enough for me. I'm a big Harpoon fan, I just think they could have done a bit better."
"-RA"
"Pours the color of a new copper penny, almost no head. Scent is a big whiff of seasonal spices lead by cinamin then less amunts of nutmeg, ginger and clove, very lightly sweet carmely malt profile. Taste again is big on the seasonal spices, decently belnded all be it a tad strong compared to the very light background notes of carmel malts. The beer feels quite light on the tongue, some linger spice notes. The overall reviews of this beer shocked me as i've had a few of these lately and have enjoyed it... it is high on the spice and light on a lot of things beer, but i enjoyed it."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured red-orange with a one and a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, clove, and cinnamon. The flavor was of sweet malt, clove, coriander, cinnamon, and a hint of candy cane. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. It had a nice touch with the candy cane flavor and spices. Well balanced and nicely done on the flavor. Saw that a lot of people are completely bashing this one, but I didn't think it was THAT bad. Not great, but not bad..."
"D) I'm not impressed. I don't think I will finish this...yup, going down the drain."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of caramel and toffee malt along with some assorted spices. I get some cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor is spicy along with some toffee and caramel. The spices taste a bit muddled and are tough to pick out individual ones. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent winter warmer, but there are better spiced Christmas beers out there."
"This is the worst winter offering I've had. Definitely not something I'd seek out again."
"I have had much better winter ales. I would avoid unless you were offered by a guest"
"Not the greatest I've had this season. The spicing seemed overly contrived and as I mentioned, not very well balanced. Just a mouthful of spice giving way to a weak malty backbone."
"D- Nicely balanced winter warmer, very easy to drink. Nothing overly sweet."
"there are way better christmas ales out there."
"Cheers!!"
"Pours a mirkly dark amber with a quick dissipating head into a pint glass. Smells like bananas and pine. Strong taste of banana, almost overwhelming in fact. This is probably my least favorite beer from Harpoon thus far. As far as drinkability is concerned, it does goes down quite smooth I will give it that."
"D - the funny dryness to it doesn't make it terribly drinkable, but it's pretty smooth."
"Drinkability: I honestly don't know why there is no much hatred for this beer, it's not that bad at all. I went into this review concerned, but I really don't mind it at all and would definitely pick it up again. I do however, note that it's best when cold right out of the fridge, and it loses some of its charm as it warms up. I think though, I like this beer because I really like cinnamon, which is the dominant flavor in this beer. It's a little bit like having a beery red-hot (those little red candies). So if you don't like this spice, then you're going to hate this beer. Despite this love of cinnamon, it is a beer that I can only have one of. While I wouldn't mind having it again another night, I can't have more than one in an evening. While I really love cinnamon, it's a spice to flavor other things, not to have solely by itself."
"Overall this is a decent winter offering. I enjoyed this more during my novice beer days; now it is kinda heavy on the spices. Enjoyable once or twice during the winter months, but not a whole 6-pack beer."
"If the Characteristics of this beer were reversed, with more hopy/malty qualities up front and the spices more towards the back, then this beer would have done a lot better."
"Pours a very dark amber with an off-white head. Solid retention and lacing. Very spicy aroma. All-spice and cinnamon mostly. Flavor is a little more subdued, but same as the aroma. Little malt or hops, mostly just light cinnamon, nutmeg and all-spice flavor."
"D: Medium to low. Not sure how much I'd like the strong spices."
"D: Wow...looks like people really don't like this beer. I don't think its that bad, I wouldn't want more than 1 but its something different/intresting and the 1 I drank went down pretty decent."
"D: A nice brew, but not a heavy hitting winter warmer. An average at best brew that has good flavors, but does not have me coming back for more. I have enjoyed this beer and do look forward to any release from Harpoon."
"This was served from a bottle in to a Sam Adams glass. The appearance is copper orange with a decent head that fades to some lacing. Smells and tastes like cinnamon. Overall this is a decent beer. I wouldn't buy it, but I would take one if it was offered."
"Drinkability? Not a chance. Getting through one of these took me a couple of hours. I'm not quite sure what to do with the rest of them -- perhaps use them in a holiday stew or something. A pity, as Harpoon produces some decent stuff; I'm not sure what they were thinking with this one."
"I'm not sure I wouldn't know this wasn't a strong pumpkin beer if I didn't know better. It is pretty one dimensional and not all that good. The spices seem to be overdone, and there isn't really any malt character. It is basically a macro base with a ton of nutmeg and cinnamon thrown in."
"2.5 D: Not terrible, but pretty boring. This could benefit from a higher mash temp, more specialty malts, and more enthusiasm."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a translucent copper with a one inch, loose, tan-colored head. Head eventually settles into a sudsy, thin skim. Nose is somewhat subdued - malty, with a trace of nutmeg and allspice. Taste follows nose with the addition of a light cinnamon character that also expresses itself in the flavor profile. However, it's all a bit watered down. Mouthfeel is light in body and somewhat watery in consistency. Carbonation is somewhat lively and even. Not a bad winter warmer - fortunately, it lacks the cloying spiciness you tend to find in the style, but there's also nothing too special about it either. It improves somewhat when mixed with cider."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste also is full of spice, strong nutmeg and cinnamon, some malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"This beer has a light feel to it and goes down well. It has some nice spices in it that would compliment the type of foods that would be common during the holidays and the colder months. It also is pretty refreshing and pretty drinkable as well."
"D - As soon as I cracked this open and took a sip, I was totally disappointed and thought what a waste of money. This is fine for BMC drinkers trying to break out of the box, but most BA fans will HATE this."
"I think they overdid it with the flavors, big-time."
"D - I will probably never buy this beer again. I can not imagine drinking more than 1 of these per session. I have some in the fridge and they do not leave me craving more after I have 1."
"Not that bad, but the spices feel a little overwhelming and the malt sweetness seems a little cloying. I probably wouldn't pick this one up again, but I'm glad I had the chance to try it."
"D. I wouldn't mind picking up another 12 pack of this stuff."
"D: If they would have eased up on the nutmeg. I think this one would be a yummy one. Keep brewing gentlemen!"
"Easy enough to drink if the spicy sweetness is not too much for you."
"Drinkability- the taste is too much for me."
"Not a bad beer, though it wouldn't be my first choice of winter brew. I prefer the stouts, but as far as winter warmers go, it's not a bad run."
"In all honesty, the beer feels like it could be *really* good, but there are too many drawbacks at the moment."
"D- goes down good. A little spicy but still drinkable. For seasonal, it is ok to embrace for the season"
"D- More than one might just cause a stomach ache due to candy-like cinnamon other spices."
"I've had better holiday brews, and due to the lack of balance, overwhelming sweetness and cinnamon candy taste I can't recommend it."
"A very good beer for the upcoming Christmas season."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a moderate rusty-red color with a slight head and some pretty good lacing. The nose is overloaded with spices--cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and a hint of ginger. The taste is the same way with some very mild malt in the background. The feel and the drinkability both suffer from the fact that this is just a spice bomb and I can't handle too much of it."
"Better if you drink it ice cold"
"It does leave you with a slight bittering and dry mouthfeel but it's one of those beers that I couldn't sit down and drink more than one just because of the overwhelming spice characteristics."
"Deep red to brown in color with excellent clarity. Pours with a nice thick head that reduces to a decent white cap. Ripe apple, cinnamon and coriander aromas. Surprisingly thin bodied given the deep color and thick head. A bit on the watery side. Light apple and pear flavors in the beginning that lead to a dominant coriander spice middle with a hint of orange rind. Lingering spice aftertaste. This was generally disappointing. After the pour and first nose full it all just kind of went down hill."
"Deep copper with a head reminiscent of egg nog in color and look, except the bubbles. It smells of nutmeg, but not nearly as strong in spices as last year's offering. For the record, this is the 2010 edition. This does taste better than 2009's release, but that doesn't say much. This one is substandard as well. The phenols in the mouthfeel overwhelm any good tastes and make this not all that pleasant to drink. If you can ignore the phenols (the astringency that attacks the roof and back and sides of your mouth), you can sense the caramel malts in the back and the spices (nutmeg and clove). It's a shame that the control over the way the spices interacted in the final product was not firmly in place...this had the potential to be a really nice beer."
"Clear, coppery chestnut brown with a thin cap of fine bubbles. A few tiny spots of lace. Intense spice aroma, nutmeg and cinnamon, with faint malt. The flavour was alright -- it improved as it warmed. At first, the spices were dominant and didn't leave much room for the malt sweetness and caramel that were present in the background. Once closer to room temp, the malt presence improved and provided some needed balance. Spices still lingered on my palate a little longer than I would have liked. Decent texture, medium bodied. If the spicing were pulled back a bit I'd enjoy it a lot more."
"First Winter Warmer of the season. Pours a very copper brown color into the glass with a slightly tan head that dissipated rapidly. Minimal lacing on the glass. Smells like a spice bomb with aromas of cinnamon and nutmeg. Not really getting anything else in the smell. Taste follows in line with smell. Really not picking up on anything else but a weak cinnamon taste. There are other ""spices"" in the background but it just seems a jumbled secondary mess. Can't really discern any other flavor, slight caramel malt but that's it. Mouthfeel is where this beer really falls apart for me. It's just too thin and watery for a ""winter warmer"". In fact I get a better more solid feel out of summer beers I like. I was really surprised at the lack of body in this seasonal beer. I'm disappointed I picked up a 6'er of this. Nov-Feb. I'm just looking for beers with more oomph."
"Overall, I would describe this beer as unremarkable but comforting, in a good way. This is what I want to be drinking at a family holiday dinner, or sitting on my couch in November watching football."
"D_The look and smell of this beer led to the extreme let down of drinking it. I wish I had not bought a sixer."
"D- I really like this beer. I could drink a sixer of it. Compared to a lot of other winter warmers I have had it doesn't compare in this style. I woud give it more of a pumpkin style than anything else. It is a beer I look forward to every wintertime."
"One is fine, however two seems as if it could be one too many, definitely not a session beer, which i doubt it was made to be. Either way it is a solid reminder of the holidays to come and pumpkin pie and sweet potatoes to be eaten."
"If you want a beer to drink by a wood stove when you are wearing flannel and down this is the beer."
"Pours a reddish-brown colour with a nice white head. Great retention and minimal lacing. Smell has lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste is quite spicy, with a little bit of hop bitterness. I'm not sure if I'm just overrating because a lack of winter/xmas beers lately, but I'm digging this. Nice carbonation level. Glad I have another bottle in the fridge because I'd like another."
"It's not bad, but it's not great either."
"I think they must have improved this beer a good bit since the Bros' reviewed it... it's certainly better than a D+ beer in my opinion, but hey, it's not perfect either."
"There is an overly watery mouthfeel to the beer with not a whole lot of essence of beer. It is almost as if the soul were stolen from this beer. It tastes ok, but only if you do not think of it as beer. Winter warmer like flavors and spices, just not very beer like. There is a slightly medicinal taste due to overspicing and not enough malt flavors."
"I've enjoyed other beers from Harpoon, but this one is a one trick pony that is not impressive. The spice blend is awful and thats all there is to this beer. I won't drink this again."
"Attractive looking beer with a clear, dark amber color. A large off-white head forms and has good retention before settling to a thick cap. A fairly large amount of lacing is left on the glass. Smells sorta like my mother's gingerbread cookies she made me when I was a kid. Not much for beer elements however. Just a lot of cinammon and nutmeg. The flavor is too far over-the-top with spice. Not very enjoyable. The first sip was okay but it just built up to unlikable levels. If some beer could actually be tasted, this could be a decent beer. Too light in body and over-carbonated. Does not help the flavor at all. Might pass as some odd-ball beer to pass off as a surprise to some unsuspecting guest, but I would not drink it again."
"My take on this beer is that it is like drinking a spiced Newcastle Brown Ale. The light brown ale part was OK, not great but was OK. The spicing part was OK. But when you put these two things together that don't really go together, you get something not really desirable."
"Pours a clear copper color. Nicely complex smell of warm spices - cinnamon, nutmeg - plus sweet caramel. Taste is similar. Was very surprised to see all the bad reviews as I like this taste quite a bit. Crisp clean feel. Could drink a couple but not more than that with the spicy taste."
"Drink-Wont be getting this again."
"D: Well, after just having the respected Dark Munich from Harpoon this was a let down. I would not recommend this beer to anyone now would I seek it out. 1 is enough. Please try again next year."
"drinkability: not really what im looking for in a winter warmer, but this is very good and i will definately try it more next year."
"I can get through ONE of anything. This is absolutely the worst offering from Harpoon I've ever had. I just think this one missed the mark big time."
"Drinkability - Smooth and drinkable, surprisingly drinkable. I was expecting overpowering spice that would limit the amount you could enjoy over a night, but that's not the case with this brew."
"Mouthfeel is watery and thin bodied. I would really like to see Harpoon beef this one up and give it more body, use natural spices as an undertone to enhance the beer flavor rather than dominate it. They must sell alot of it to keep brewing this year after year. If they go by the BA rating, it would probably be booted from the line up or at least get a recipe overhaul. I don't hate it, but I don't love it either."
"Poured a rich coffee like color with okay head, but little lacing and leaves quickly. The smell comes off a bit assaulting to me. Almost reminiscent of malt extract. Too sweet for my tastes. I was expecting something a little more along the lines of Brooklyn's Winter Ale and these sweet, spicy, caramel brews aren't my forte. I'd like less cloying sweetness and more hops. I usually like Harpoon brews, but this was a let down for sure."
"This beer has a very strong smell of cinnamon and nutmeg which makes it smell like a candy with artificial banana flavoring. The beer has a sweet taste that isnt very beer like. This came in a winter variety pack and although I though it was alright, it is certainly not a beer you are going to want to drink often."
"Medium mouthfeel that's too heavy for sessioning, but light enough to down 2-3 in 1 sitting."
"I am a big harpoon fan, but this one is a miss for me. I don't like the spices, takes away from the beer, there is no real taste to the beer that resembles beer, hops, barley. If I am drinking a beer, I want it to taste like a beer, and then they can mix in whatever, but this is just too overdone for me. Maybe having one at a party for a novelty, but I'd rather have an egg-nog."
"Better on tap than in bottle"
"Overall, this is beer is terrible, way to much spice, and not drinkable at all."
"Poured from the tap into a tall glass during Valentine's dinner. Thin head once the glass got to my table. The reddish hue was nice and applicable to the moment. Smell was good with a hint of spice. The taste was kind of average. I didn't expect the spice which ended up being quite nice in some sips, weird in others. Mouthfeel was average/medium and drinkability was easy. I'm glad I tried it."
"I actually liked this beer, but could not stand to have another due to the drying qualities of the spices...kind of a shame."
"Not the most refined or balanced winter warmer, but if you like spicy beers (which I love for this style) than try this out."
"Looking pretty good; a dark molasses color with an airy head that thins out quickly. Smell was overpowering with cloves and some other unidentifiable spices (maybe coriander?) Taste was a bit dry, malty with those still indistinguishable spices taking over. Aftertaste had the characteristics of burnt, holiday-flavored coffee...and some brown sugar."
"all in all....decent, but not what i'll be up to for the rest of this winter."
"D - A good winter beer. If you like nutmeg, you will like this beer. Couldn't have too many of these, but then again, that's generally not the point of winter beers in my opinion."
"D - I really didn't want to finish this one but I'm usually against drain pours. I could see why some people would like it but it just falls short all over the place IMO."
"This is winter spice lovers dream. Not something i could session, a good dessert or nightcap brew."
"Comments: I would definitely class this as a beer that goes well with dessert. It would perfectly compliment a large, hot cinnamon roll or a slice of homemade apple pie or maybe even some gingersnaps."
"Poured from the tap into a Pint glass. Deep amber color with some solid lace that however doesnt stick around long. Smells strongly of Cinnamon, and Bubblegum? Taste is powerful and spicey but smooth, Cinnamon and nutmeg mainly. A good medium body and carbonation that felt right for the beer. This is definitely on the verge of being way to spiced, but i still found it smooth and drinkable compared to some others. I enjoyed having a glass but wouldnt have more than 1 maybe 2 in a night. I would really have liked to try the older recipe for comparison."
"Easy to drink a few of these on a cold winter's night."
"now to what counts most....the taste. and it's really nice. i admit, for a festive winter spice style brew, the mouthfeel is a bit thin. i'd like to see it more chewey. some dry-hopping might help the overall sense. but what we have here is really tasty and not overblown in the least. thankfully, nothing cloying at all here. this reminds me of a holdiay spice tea my mom used to have. there's an orange pekoe note with actual orange-citrus going on with the spices. every sip and gulps reveals dimension, too, but i admit i oddly don't any sense of malts or hops (if there are any). i can still tell it is an brew, but this is designed to be something quite different. of course, check out harpoon's own description of it and we are right on target. judge it for what it is. not against your expectations. prejudices."
"Not something I would recommend. Way to much cinnamon and spice. I usually like beers like this, though this is just to much."
"D - Pretty strong drinkability and definitely a winter beer. It's light and has a moderate ABV and would make a decent session beer. But overall, not one of Harpoon's best work."
"d: a little weird and super smoky; i prob wouldn't get it again"
"Did not enjoy this beer at all. Too much in the spice department makes it nearly undrinkable. This beer is very tough to even take down and finish. I bought a 6 pack. Drank two and gave away the rest to my roomates. Never will I again even look at this beer."
"Drinkability: luckily I bought a single bottle of this, I wouldn't have this again unless this was the only craft on tap or around. I recommend this to anyone seeking a winter beer that taste like BMC with holiday spices and a subtle malt profile. A one and done for me."
"This is average as far as drinkability. The spices are a little much."
"Libation: I've liked other Harpoon offerings, but this just isn't a good flavor profile in my opinion. The spice and malt are too sharp and too rough. Not something I'll come back to."
"Overall this is a decent winter warmer. The spices are a little overdone, though."
"D - I poured three out of the six bottles (on separate days of course) before writing this review. However, I have yet to finish one. It's a struggle each time. I you like these spices, you may enjoy this beer more than I do."
"Pours a very clear amber color with a finger of tanned head. Faint spotty lacing on the glass and not much head retension. Very strong aroma of spices that is borderline offensive like a holiday candle shoved in your face. Bold amounts of nutmeg and cinnamon with a bit of citrus filling it out and initially had some clove and banana but the other spices dominate the aroma. Taste is exactly what you would expect; slight bitterness in the front but it immediately turns to spices like cinnamon and nutmeg with some citrus in the finish. Not really picking up on the malt character you get with other examples of this style."
"A pretty deep copper with reddish hues. Light cap of very nice proportions. Good retention and decent lacing. Smell is nicely spiced with sweet caramel malts and yeasty breads. Taste brings a lovely fruitiness with a surprising note of light banana, nutmeg, cinnamon,and light clove. Nice leafy hops in the finish. Decent feel with moderately crisp carbonation. Pretty easy drinker for the cold months. A nice one out of the Harpoon winter box."
"Drinkability: for a winter warmer, you could do worse....it's by no means the best in style, but it is quite lovely on a winter night."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. It's a brown colored beer with plenty of carbonation bubbles visible rising inside. There was a small tan head that dissipated quickly. No lacing. The aroma is heavily spiced; maybe some cinnamon and nutmeg? It doesn't smell natural though. The spices are present in the flavor. There is also some sweet maltiness. The is a flavor in the finish that lingers after you swallow that can be best described as unpleasant. The beer has a light body and a lot of carbonation. I don't like all of the bubbles collecting on my tongue. This beer doesn't have much going for it; I wouldn't drink another. I do like some other overly (and artificially) spiced beers, like Shipyard's Pumpkinhead, but this one just doen't do it for me. There are much better winter beers and I know this brewery is capable of making a better beer."
"Medium body and light to medium carbonation. At first, this smelled okay and tasted alright but the more I drank, the less I liked it. The last few sips were somewhat of a struggle, I just wanted it to be over. Won't be looking for this again."
"Drinks ok, but there are much better examples of the style around. Not the best offering from a pretty decent brewery."
"Notes - That wonderful smell gave me high hopes for this one. I just can't get past that cola taste, though. Otherwise it would have been a nice, easy-going rendition of a winter warmer."
"D - Great beer? No. Horrible beer? No. Slightly above average, maybe Winter Warmer light, very spicy, if this is your calling card, then try this beer"
"D: Definitely sessionable."
"Drinkability is ok. I had this with a sandwich, probably would be better with hors d'oeuvres and a party setting. In any case you wouldn't want to swill a whole bunch of these because of the spices. A novelty beer...not bad..not great."
"Good beer, but not necessarily one I could have too many of. Surprisingly low ABV."
"I knew what I was getting into with this one and don't mind the spicyness of it. If you're in the mood for something spicy and different, it's not bad."
"It had a very spicy, minty taste to it with a slight bitterness in the back of the mouth. Definitely a thick, full-bodied beer. There's also a hint of caramel I think in there that gives it some sweetness."
"This beer has a pleasant color, but its nose is too sweet, when it should be closer to the drier spices. The smell is a bit like Juicy Fruit, honestly. The taste doesn't really correspond to the aroma, as the first thing to dominate is clove. That's not bad in itself, but then a lot of other flavors begin to dispute with that note, and the result is somewhat chemical tasting. Bottom line: Winter Warmer suffers from an unbalanced charge of spices. It seems to have one too many, and the spices clash with themselves and with what the beer is trying to do. The boor at the spice party may be nutmeg. Sam Adams does this sort of thing much better in their several holiday ales, not all of which are spiced, even."
"Drinkability: I made a mixed sixpack at Total Wine of different winter ales. This was somehow the only one that was spiced. I had lowish expectations, and was somewhat pleasantly surprised. This is very spice forward and there's not too much else going on, but does taste good for what it is. I dont really want another."
"Hop tasted diminished."
"Not a bad beer at all, not what I expected after reading all the bad reviews."
"D= fair, not a session beer simply because it only comes in a seasonal variety-pack."
"This, I hate to say, really isn't very good. The spice is entirely too powerful, it's cloyingly sweet... everything is out of whack and the concept of balance seems to have been lost on Harpoon's brewmaster on this one. Very glad I had the sense to grab a single instead of springing for a sixer. A real shame, as I quite like several other beers brewed by Harpoon."
"It's kinda like carbonated water with a lot of christmas spices...or maybe burnt christmas cookies but its still fairly enjoyable"
"D: Mediocre. Easy enough to drink, but can get sick of the spices quickly."
"This beer is nice...a moderately alcohol, sessionable, and very spicy brew. I had this at Stocks and Blondes in Chicago, and on a cold December day near Christmas, this beer really hit the spot. IMO, there are a lot of things that can be done to screw up a winter warmer, and I thought this beer pulled the style off nicely - it looked good (brilliant clear body of dark brown, nice head presence and retention) smelled seasonally spicy (nutmeg, cinammon, maybe allspice and cardamom - but that's reaching for my olfactive skills), and tasted like Christmas. Mouthfeel was a touch thin. This was a solid base-beer (maybe a caramel-y and weakly hopped amber ale) that was well-spiced. I liked it, and think it appropriate for the season."
"I can see by most reviews here they were not happy with the strong spice of this brew. I however loved the prescence of nutmeg, clove and cinnamon that dominates this brew. Nice dark clear amber color with a nice head and descent lacing. Even a nice spicy smell. In are latest drinking session this was the surprised hit. I enjoyed this beer but I do think my limit would be two in a sitting; as much as I liked the spicy flavor I think it is overpowering and that my taste buds would revolt before too long."
"the smell and taste are dominated by a ridiculous amount of sweet and synthetic spicing. I can't pick up any other aromas or flavors. Mouth is cloying which makes drinking quite a chore. No thank you."
"decently good beer, surprised at the low scores."
"Borders on a drain-pour. I'll stick with Harpoon IPA."
"Harpoon Winter Warmer is way better then last years I actually got it down, but also seems like a chore to keep drinking. It has nothing to keep me interested very long."
"D- Moderate. I liked the spices, but not the aftertaste of the base beer. I'll have to try this in the bottle and see if it tastes any different. A nice winter warmer, but a bit of a head-scratcher. Not overly spiced, in my opinion, though."
"D - I'm having trouble finishing this one. bleh."
"Decent taste, but not one for multiples. Sip one and move on."
"A pretty dark clear amber, tiny fizzy head. It smelled strongly of cinnamon and nutmeg, along with some malts and mild...banana? It tastes sweet, like pumpkin pie. Noticeable malts. Despite the strong flavors, it still comes across as thin. Perhaps...Like watered-down banana bread, if that were possible. But overall, pleasant, if not awesome."
"A pretty poor beer, not much flavor besides the spices. I don't know if the dryness is from being overattenuated or the hops, but not really expected for a ""rich"" winter warmer. Stay away from this beer."
"D- A little tough to handle all the spice. Not bad to have one or two, but thats the cut-off"
"I won't break it down into detail, other than to say try it if your curious but that would be the only reason."
"Drinkability--Certainly drinkable...you have to really enjoy spice, though. Not exactly a session beer (for me, anyway)--I could stand 1, maybe 2 at a time. I can see women loving this."
"Had this as part of Harpoon's winter sampler 12 pack. I've had this before and have never been impressed. It is simply ale with a lot of spices dumped in. Plenty of flavors but no balance at all, or subtlety. Might be okay at a party where no one cares about the quality of wassail, otherwise, just leave this alone."
"Not very drinkable in my opinion. It was finishable, but I wouldn't go for this again. Way too overspiced, if you ask me."
"Light tan head which barely covers the surface, forms islands of larger bubbles, fades swiftly but leaves more lacing than you'd expect. Steady flow of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg in the nose, not overbearing, adds in orange citrus, brown sugar, not that sweet and possesses a clear hoppy spine, the apricot and peach scents subdued too and in lockstep with the rest. Medium-bodied, carbonation gives it a charge and perhaps a bit too much churn. The coriander, nutmeg, cinnamon spice is there, lighter on the clove. Presents smooth maltiness yet stays dry and doesn't soak into the palate much. Grains and hoppy grasses keep it on a generally equal distribution. None of the respective elements deep or resonant, hence in the end it does not make a lasting impression. Swift denouement."
"Drinkability: Not much of a beer I'd go looking for again. Given Harpoon's name, I see this as a big dissapointent. Way too spicy! If the flavors were slightly subdued, this might be decent. Otherwise, stick to your winter guns and avoid this mess of a beer."
"I remembered this beer from last year, I actually quite liked it then. It was full bodied and malty and full of flavor last year. This years version is watery, bitter and had no malt body what so ever. Really disappointed. I do taste a bit of sweetness - caramel/candy kind of flavor. It seems like they are trying to compete with fall beers with the flavor profile. Not robust enough for a winter warmer."
"Nonetheless, I give props to Harpoon for having the cajones to compete with Boston beer company in MA. Its a microcosm of the craft beer movement, esp. considering Boston Beer Co. is about to *officially* leave the craft beer arena."
"I picked up a six pack and tried to like it, but just couldn't dig the flavor. I would not recommend this beer."
"Harpoon Winter Warmer needs work. Fortunately, a little work could go a very long way. Just tone down the spices. That alone would open the door for quite a bit of the other flavor to shine through. I know it's there, it's just buried. Meh. Too many great Winter Warmer's out there to spend much time on this one. Skip it and pick up one of the good ones."
"Poured a dark copper with one finger offwhite head. A nice faint smell of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger spice and some pepper. Smooth, easy-drinking, thin-to-medium body with hints of caramel and vanilla notes underneath a strong balance of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, possible clove, and there are citric hop notes as well. Finishes clean and sweet. This isn't really a beer to ""warm"" up with, but it is nice to polish one off after a meal."
"Copper to orange in color. Strong banana scented nose with minimal head. Some prickle is apparent from the carbonation. The presentation is definitely crisp and the carbonation causes it to bubble in the mouth. The finish has some grip similar to an oaky red wine and some sour notes. Note to be negative, but perhaps they should adjust their winter warmer recipe each year like some other high profile breweries do."
"This isn't a bad one, at least at the temp I had it and whatever other contributing factors are involved. I'm sure there are winter warmers that aren't so strong on the spices and that balance out better."
"The beer had a nutmeg medicine type taste, very undrinkable in my book. Sorry - there are many winter warmers that are better then this I am sure, but I am turned off to that type because of this experience."
"Final Thoughts - This beer works as an after dinner beer. I get a hankering for it every holiday season, but that is a enough for me. I would give this season a try, but would consider trying a mix pack or a six before diving in with a twelve. Tastes will definitely vary."
"If you bought a six-pack you might consider leaving a couple out for Santa on Christmas Eve, otherwise you might be hard-pressed to get through the rest"
"D: Does give you a sense of warming up. Probably good in the fall when its just starting to get cold. Could probably use this to dispatch other tastes during reviews, like coffee does for the nose for smelling things."
"D- Opening the bottle, the spice aroma is faint and appealing, but after the pour, the smell and taste is overpowering, with a watery backbone. Certainly something different and looks the part, but i dont want another!"
"Yeah, okay, it's a decent beer. There is definitely a solid spice feel to it, not much different from other titular winter beers, probably best in October as a relatively cheap deviation from the norm out there. I don't have many major complaints about it, but it didn't strike me as particularly unique or great. Spice, nutmeg, some cinnamon, decently balanced, but not a top priority in the future."
"Spicy, yeast, fruity, banana, clove, maybe anise? Sweet malty, interesting, pleasant. TASTE is not as interesting as the nose. Mildly fruity, spicy, malty sweet. Mild hop bitterness in finish add to complexity. FEELING is thin, body light/med, carbonation low. Benign with a touch of biterness in the finish. Goes down easily enough, but not substantial enough to draw me in for another."
"This beer smells better than it is. Is' not a bad beer and I'd certainly drink it again, just not more than one in a night...too spicy."
"Taste is sweet, syrupy with all those spices thrown in. Its too much for me and after about half a pint I need some water and another beer."
"Pours a nice dark copper color with some good initial head, fading to decent thin head, with a tiny bit of lacing as it goes down. Excellent aroma, a nice thick and hearty malt with loads of cinnamon and orange peel, all of it strong with none of them overpowering the others. Good taste, nice spiciness, good cinnamon and orange, a tiny bit of hop to bitter it up. Goes down fine, if not fantastic. A very nice winter warmer."
"Notes: I've liked everything Harpoon has made to this point, I guess even real quality breweries have there version of SA cranberry lambic."
"Overall, I find this one quite drinkable for a winter spice beer. It is extrememly spicy, and probably will not satisfy the trained palate looking for a more complex, bigger winter warmer. Freshness is key to this beer.. drink it up quick!"
"Out of a bottle this one looked good; it was a copper color with some amber highlights, the head was khaki-colored and it quickly formed a sticky cap that left lacing in legs like a wine. The aroma was like a pumpkin ale, nutmeg and allspice with a rich maltiness. The flavors were similar, rich caramel malt, lots of spices dominated by nutmeg, touches of toasted malt and an understated hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation soft and the body full. I've heard that others really don't like this one (maybe because it's not really a Winter Warmer) but I don't give a damn what they say, I thought it pretty good."
"Overall, this is not a bad beer to have once or twice during the winter season, but you will be disappointed if you expect anything more."
"Poured to a deep amber color with a slight light tan head that did not have much size nor retention. Aroma is spicy, smells a lot like pumpkin pie and cinnamon. Having a hard time to clearly pick up malts. To me the aromas are ok but I guess I was hoping for something a little different or a winter warmer. The spices come out clearly in the flavor but are actually a little muted based on what I was expecting from the aroma. Malts come out more, spice flavor seems to be more cinnamon but am picking up some nutmeg. It is not bad going down, pretty tasty but not sure I would want more than one per session. Overall it is a fair brew, clearly not a favorite of mine and IMO a weaker offering than the norm from Harpoon,"
"This was an interesting beer. I'm sold on the spiciness, but I thing this one should offer a little more than that. I wouldn't have any problem drinking these during the holidays. It just seems like that kind of beer."
"One word: disappointed. A few years back, at a party we threw for the holidays, Russ, Ryan and Jer brought a case of this, and a good time was had by all. The cinnamon sang and the beer balanced quite well. Fast forward to this year.... an ale's body for sure with a hard, reddish-orange hue and a creamy, off-white head that would frame better if if it traced out... as brother Jer warned, cinnamon liberalism to the point of DOA, cough syrupy sweet... the beer presents smoothly on the palate, with little fanfare or character.--not a bad thing, just not distinguishing... a harsh reality here: at first, all I can taste is Sucrets as my ears redden--this beer's malt is fighting for its life, to little avail... spices and herbs simmer into a hodgepodge backdrop, with a bandaid taste fluttering in late.. a fan of Harpoon's Octoberfest, and at a pleasant friendliness with the UFO, I find this beer requires too much work from the drinker to be accepting of its quirky flavoring... too much is going on to produce an enjoyable uniform taste..."
"I didn't exactly struggle to finish the glass, but I wasn't very enthusiastic about it. It's just not that great."
"Poured from a bottle into my Harpoon Winter Warmer stemmed glass. Copper red color. White head disappeared quickly. Decent amount of lacing. Smell was quite potent, with cloves being right up front. As for the taste, it needs to be toned down a bit, or tweeked a bit. Tastes a bit too fake to me, kinda like swallowing cinnamon potpourri. Decent beer to have one now and then, but I cannot drink more than a one of these in a sitting. This used to be my favorite winter warmer years ago, then I found out there were much better ones that were just as easy to obtain and enjoy."
"It's a great winter brew in my opinion."
"12 ouncer, comes w/o freshness info. Pours clear, light mahogany amber, minimal to no head, no lace and seems to be on the low side carbonation wise. Holiday spice on the nose.Thin toasted malts, more thanksgiving pie spice notes and but continued thinness and lack of any sizzle. Metallic and off putting finish. Pretty dull stuff."
"Big disappointment from a good brewery; though my family who drink Moosehead downed on Christmas Eve with no complaints."
"I tried this brew on the advice of a friend. While the color was appealing (I enjoy darker, amber colored beers), the smell and taste was very average. It was probably a little too cold to get a good and proper taste, bu in general the mouthfeel was thin and watery. I would much rather have RedHook Winterhook."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. Easy on the palate and nose, and not too heavy."
"Drinkability: Way too spicy in my opinion. I enjoy spiced winter ales, butt his is taken to a level that obliterates and malt or hop flavors; it simply tastes like peppermint and clove water. Pass."
"Overall not horrible, but not great."
"D- Overall, Harpoon Winter Welcome is a pretty solid brew that is worth a shot during the holiday season."
"Nice amber color, with a 1 finger head, no retention. The aroma is nutmeg and cinammon, this is not subtle in the least. The nutmeg has a more dominate flavor in the taste of the beer, a little overbearing in my opinion, again, not very subtle. I drank two of these at a party over the weekend, wanting to have a second shot at the flavor. Maybe nutmeg is just not my thing, but I wish it had a little more balance. The beer had a light/medium body and is a very but the fact that it had little balance and seemed overspiced, I dont find this very drinkable."
"Nikki"
"Bottle. Pours a middle-amber with little in the way of head, and nothing in the way of head retention or lacing. Aroma is of pumpkin pie, cinnamon, clove, and faint nutmeg or gingerbread. Flavor is that of a pumpkin pie with too much water added to the filling, cinnamon, and a clove tang at the end. Good carbonation and light body makes this beer less filling (and worlds less overwhelming) than most winter/spiced ales. This beer almost -- ALMOST -- makes me want to stop calling Harpoon a pseudo-micro. Then again, I'm from Boston."
"Beer is medium bodied with a little crispness in the finish, but there's also a lingering sweet spiciness. A gingerbread cookie blended with an amber ale, this is just hard to get down, and one is enough. It's too bad, because at the first whiff, you are wishing that it would be great -- it's not. I like spiced/flavored beer, but this one is just a bit overdone."
"D- An ok beer but i dont think i would purchase more than one just to try. Might be good with licorice or anise cookies."
"A good addition to the Harpoon Winter variety pack, but not something I would buy regularly by itself."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle dated 03/15/09-329. I don't think it is as bad as the Bro's and previous raters. I actually kind of like this one. The aroma has a sensation of cloves. The mouthfeel is about medium and the flavor has a clove-like hoppy sensation. It's not all that bad."
"I had high hopes for this one; I had a sample of it at a tasting and it was quite good then. I think the bitter tasting hops in this one just kinda ruin the rest of what is a good beer. Overall, it's not as bad as other people make it out to be."
"As far as winter warmers go, this one is lacking character, some medium to full bodied roundedness, and interesting spiciness. The recipe of this beer has changed significantly over the years. It used to wallop you with nutmeg and cinnamon. These days it is pretty toned down. There is a definite nutmeg spice to the beer, but this is overall quite bland. Staying within the winter warmer genre, I had Harpoon's WW before tasting an Old Fezziwig from Sam Adams, and the difference is substantial. The Harpoon WW is amber, clear, some off white head. The aroma is entirely adequate with some nutmeg coming through. The beer is just nothing special. Rather than modifying a rather robust but flawed recipe, it seems as though Harpoon opted for boring, simple, and by the numbers. It's okay, but nothing special. Perhaps they should come up with Winter Warmer 3.0"
"I taste the standard malt sweetness, a moderate amount of malt taste here. But there a bitterness or sourness I can't put my finger on, it's not hop bitterness, or a good sourness, almost a bitterness from the spices used. Whatever it is, it just doesn't mesh well. I was expecting more cinammony like some of the pumpkin ales out there. The overall experience is nothing to write home about, everything just feels kind of flat... not just the carbonation, but also the beer's appearance, taste, spicing (don't get me wrong, I hate overspiced seasonal beers, but I would like to see the spice profile here add more to the package than an underlying bitterness.) Mouthfeel is the same way, no stickiness, or coating, just meh. Mediocrity all around. It's certainly drinkable if you like it, with a light body, but I would rather find something I like the taste of a little more."
"3.0/5"
"Good body, well carbonated, but as for drinkability the spicing keeps you down to one. Too bad, would be much better if they had more malt and maybe a higher abv."
"If I see this again, I would not hesitate to try it once more."
"Drinkability: I can finish the one I just had, but I don't see myself buying this one again. Maybe they'll change it up next winter. Too much of a spice profile and too little of any hop/malt...or any beer characteristic."
"o-years ago would enjoy this, but guess my palate changed very much and now all the covering things like spices, and other characteristics were easily looks past to expose whats really there, an unimpressive brew."
"D - I wanted to like this beer but it just isn't balanced at all. The spices jump out but there is nothing to compliment the flavors. Untamed bitterness coupled with a sub-par mouthfeel makes one of these a bit of a chore to get through. Overall this reminds me of a weak and unbalanced pumpkin ale without the pumpkin."
"D - If you are into spiced ales, this is a decent brew. As others have said, it's not really a true winter warmer, but it works well for a lighter alternative. I happen to like the spicy taste, and these are mild enough (and cheap enough) to share with others that don't usually drink craft beers. I enjoy a few six packs of these at Christmastime, but it's not something I'd drink all winter."
"D: It's easy to drink because it's nothing too big. Flavor is sufficient, but could be a lot better. Still, a decent winter warmer that will definitely please those looking for a lighter, more drinkable alternative."
"The first thing that will hit you are the spices. VERY spicy, but in a good way. Not cloying nor too sweet. This is what I expect in a Christmas/Winter ale. Hearty taste with a robustness and good body, and this is what Harpoon Winter Warmer delivers. Good color and appearance with an aroma that hints at the spiciness, but the taste is what makes me give it such high marks. Tried it at the brewery first and liked it enough to buy some for the fridge at home."
"Not terrible to drink but the spices will get to you quick."
"Had one from a sample pack I bought. Dark, clear red amber with a slight dullness and little lacing. Aromas had a seasonal spice of cinnamon mixed with a nutty flavor. The taste was a little too sharp and very dry with a malty sweetness that trails off to a bitter aftertaste. A good mouthfeel though that includes a dry crispness and good carbonation. The flavors do not help it from being refreshing, however. I wouldn't mind drinking this in a winter party, but nothing too special here."
"Pretty good overall"
"That said, I love Harpoon Winter Warmer. It's a great, guilt-free cheap thrill...like Bon Jovi karaoke."
"Got this one in a mixed sixer. Haven't been particularly blown away by Harpoon beers, and this one falls in that generally mediocre area. Look is good - deep maroon-amber color, crystal clear, with a nice off-white head and a good amount of lacing. Nose is a ton of nutmeg, with a touch of caramel. Not a lot going on there. Flavor is basically eggnog - nutmeg and spiciness, and cookies. Again, a pretty straightforward spicy malt flavor. Body is appropriate with busy carbonation. Overall, it's not terrible, but not particularly interesting either."
"Not necessarily a bad beer, but a poor attempt at its stated style. Harpoon really needs to bump this one up to a Fall seasonal or simply rename it."
"D..I think this is an average session beer for the winter. Overall, I always enjoy a couple of six packs before the end of the year, but nothing I would drink regularly anymore."
"A confusing beer which does not come close to other winter warmers out there."
"Bottle poured into a glass. Has a caramel color, light head. You can smell the spices, cinnamon and nutmeg, doesn't smell sweet though, it smells somewhat bitter. The taste is sharply bitter, but not hoppy, it is the spice - it has all the spice of nutmeg and cinnamon with none of the sweetness. Really wouldn't drink multiple or drink it again (if I hadn't bought a 6-pack)"
"Lacks the depth of a good winter warmer, needs some more malt depth. Dissapointing beer from a brewery I usually really enjoy."
"Overall it was decent, nothing spectacular but I guess I really was not expecting that too much. Overall not bad, probably would not order it again, but would not hate it if it was offered."
"M & D: Has a decent amount of carbonation, but it flows down smoothly. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for an above average winter beer that doesn't cost too much. Was like $8 for the 6er."
"Drinkability: This is an interesting beer. Not something I would want to drink a lot of every day, but it certainly has its place. I agree that it's a bit heavy on the spices, but I still found this to be enjoyable and it really has a warming effect. Perfect for cold days or the holidays."
"D: I could put down two if I had to, but why would I want to. With all the great winter beers to choose from, this one is best left on the shelf."
"maybe if it was summer this would be more favorable IMO ( cant get passed the banana, like a hefe-)"
"D: It's interesting, but it comes across as more of a beer-flavored spiced cider. Something about it just seems too over-the-top spiced for my tastes."
"Decently drinkable, a pretty average brew."
"The spices may be a BIT over bearing, but not really. It's called a winter warmer, but this is only 5.5% ABV so it's a bit of a misnomer. Most breweries go for high alcohol/heavy body for this style but Harpoon went with more of a holiday spice twist.. everyone has their own interpretations of a winter seasonal. Just because it is different doesn't make it bad.. a solid beer."
"(From a limited, dated journal): Pours a pale orange-red with nice, visible carbonation. Aroma is dominated by nutmeg and malt, with a sweet kick to it that continues in the taste. Spiciness is powerful, with a quick bitterness in the aftertaste. This bottle was in the back of my dad's fridge at the end of summer 2008. Not sure when it was bought, but probably last winter."
"Not a bad drink, this Harpoon brew, but not what I think of when I'm thinking 'Winter Warmer'. Frankly, it could stand more body, more malt, and more booze, but even as it is, I like the spiciness as a nice change of pace. Easy drinker; no problem knocking back a few of these in sequence when tailgating and eating wood-roasted whole-hog barbecue, as the cinnamon and nutmeg go great with pork!"
"Notes: I expected something with balance and something with a higher ABV. That teaches the lesson that one should learn not to expect anything. Not worth the time or money."
"Eric"
"M&D: the mouthfeel is almost soda-like, albeit not as fizzy, while the spiciness seems to help lift up the palate overall but not quite ""adds to"" the overall flavour. This is not my cup of tea, in need of a balance as well as more complexity in the flavour profile."
"12/6/2004. I've been freezing all day so I wanted to try something warming. While not terrible, this wasn't really all that great. Pours a copper-amber color with a medium head which settles down to almost nothing. Ginger and a spiced aroma followed by a flavor that consists of ginger, nutmet, cinnamon and pumpkin. Happy Halloween I guess. Mouthfeel was a little thin. It was okay, but that's about it."
"mouthfeel is spicy, good weight, nice carbonation, an interesting take on warmers"
"Tried it unsuccessfully with a meal, enjoyed it very much on its own and found it somewhat enjoyable with salsa. May or may not buy it again."
"Now to welcome in the warmer weather and leave the winter warmers behind. I will of course be looking for this one next winter."
"I'll admit, this is more of a family drink than anything else. Your wife would love it, your grandmother would love it. But that's what makes it a really, really good beer in my opinion. I wouldn't give it the time of day on a table with Guinness or Allagash, but nonetheless, a fine creation by Harpoon."
"I don't regret buying the six pack (it's hard to regret buying a six pack of anything for $4.99), but unless I hear about a recipe change through the grapevine, I won't be picking this up again next winter, or even next post-winter."
"2006 brew. This was drunk from a bottle. It had a unique flavor built off their standard IPA. It had a good amount of clean hops, but with easily noticeable cinnamon and nutmeg added. One of the cleanest tasting spicy ales I've had, with each flavor being very distinct. Fairly watery but not too thin, and a bit carbonated. Overall pretty good for a special occasion, but nothing I'd want to drink regularly."
"Although it poured a dark amber and pleasant in appearance, this holiday brew's quality comes from its taste and smell. The nutmeg and cinnamon are very apparent and aid this in being a quite delicious spiced beer. Although heavy, it's quite drinkable."
"Overall - Trying too hard this one.... i like spiced beers but i kinda like them a bit more toned down than this !!"
"The body is light and a bit watery. Really falls flat and could use some malt backing to balance the over-spiced characteristics. So, have a nice day."
"D - This one is not at all for me; but if you like fruit cake you might dig this."
"D,notes: I view this beer the same way I look back to when I netflixed Battle of the Planets - a show I loved when I was a kid. As an adult it sucked. Winter Warmer kind of piqued my interest in craft brews about 8 years or so ago and I remembered it fondly. Trying it again made me realize that it kind of blows."
"12oz bottle from Clarendon Wines in Boston. Pours a clear light ruby with quite a bit of carbonation. Strong smell of spices - cinnamon, I think, and a bit of orange. The taste is spice upfrront which quickly gives way to, well, nothing. This beer is felt only on the tongue with the spices, and there is little else to it. Quite thin. Disappointing."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is watery, it finishes with tons of spice, cinnamon chiefly, lingering in the mouth. This is not a drinkable beer, I recommend that all who value beer and your soul for that matter stay away from this beer. At this point I am glad that I received this beer for free(I'm not all that happy that I received it now that I've tasted it...I am dumber and my taste buds have regressed for having drunk this beer), I'd be wrought with pain if I actually paid for this crap."
"D--Let's just say one was enough. I expected this beer to be darker and heavier and not spoiled with spices. I will not hold this against Harpoon!"
"D-no way, was a dump after two sips."
"Mouthfeel is thin and bubbly, finishing tingly. Not too drinkable for me due to the sweetness and heavy-handed nutmeg. Hopefully next year's will be different, but from the reviews I've read through, it seems that the recipe may have been altered from what I remember."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, which leaves some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, nutmeg, cinnimon, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, big on nutmeg, slight cinnimon, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew."
"Afterthought: With so many really good, really accessible Winter Warmers out there, there is absolutely no reason for anyone to buy this particular product except out of sheer curiosity. You've been cautioned."
"Dark amber color with moderate head. Aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg with mellow hop character. Well-carbonted; lighter-than-average amber ale taste blended with a long spice finish and aftertaste. Thin on the mouth; pretty well drinkable but probably not for everyone."
"Light mouthfeel with slight cloyingness. Was just too spicy for me to have any drinkability. A spice lovers beer,wish it had more beery taste and less spicyness,very unbalanced overall."
"Well, it is certainly spiced. What lies underneath it, well - not much more than a mediocre amber ale. Not as malty and hefty as I would like in a winter warmer and the spicing, while making it a Christmas seasonal, is just too much, IMO."
"I don't know what to say about this beer. I am normally so happy with Harpoon's offerings. I got this this evening when I was out and I had to send it back. Normally I can suck it up and drink it but this was very spicy. Almost a sweet quality to it with nutmeg and pumpkin pie type spices. The mouthfeel is okay and the appearance but nothing else is worthwhile. Sorry Harpoon this is a let down. I will continue to drink your beers but never Winter Warmer again."
"D - Definitely a bit heavy on the spices. Too sweet for quaffing, but still pretty tasty and certainly good for the winter months."
"If you like pumpkin spices this beer can be quite enjoyable for what it is. The spices definitely dominate the scent and taste. Clove, nutmeg, cinnamon and a bit of allspice. Very slick mouthfeel with a little spicy warmth on the tongue. It needs a little more malt and alcohol. A little medicinal tasting at times, and this is what really hurts it."
"Pours a golden caramel color with decent head. The smell is a little over the top but I generally liked it. It is supposed to be a winter ale and maybe I was craving pumpkin pie a bit. Lots of cinnamon, clove, allspice, and nutmeg. The taste was not as good as the smell. Too much pumpkin spice cake flavor, not enough beer flavor. Mouthfeel was good but drinkability only average due to the too strong taste."
"A solid bright color color with a big light-tan head that fizzles to a scanty cover with decent blotchy lacing. The aroma definitely conjures up Christmasy ideas with bright, unmistakable spruce with light nutmeg malt. Very bright and lively, festive, nice. The flavor delivers more minty spruce with bubblegum malt. There’s not a lot more to say, solid winter ale flavors, pronounced spice without overdoing it. Medium bodied with a solid, but delicate carbonation for a slightly resinous but silky feel. A highly drinkable yet distinctive, true holiday brew. Very nice and sessionable."
"Really? This a beer that never needed to happen. My girl bought this and I tried one, what a mistake. The color and the head are nothing special. The nose is of cinimon and nutmeg, not what I really want in my beer. The only way I can describe the flavor is by saying it is like shoving a peice of pumkin pie in a Harpoon IPA. Please, by all means, avoid this beer!"
"I can easily understand though if you don't like a lot spice, you won't like this beer."
"Poured into a pint glass with barely any head and a light copper appearance. Smell was very overwhelming with cinnamon and cloves. Has the cinnamon right there with the taste which I felt was a little overpowering. somewhat of a pumpkinish taste? Lighter mouthfeel was a little surprise as I anticipated a little heavier. Overall not too bad, not for me though."
"D - I think this is my favorite winter warmer that I've had I highly recommend this one"
"Pours a hazy orange/brown, thin big bubbled off white head forms, very fizzy, disappears very fast to a decent layer, some lace spots. Smell is malty, tons of spice, vegetables, some floral, caramel, kind of buttery, not too bad, but the spices are a bit wacky. Taste is insanely spiced, cinnamon and nutmeg, cloves, caramel, veggies, butter, then all flavour dies, kind of medicinal finish. Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, high carbonation, very sharp. Pretty unsatisfying on every level."
"Pours a nice amber color from the bottle with a white head that sticks to the glass a bit, but not alot. The aroma is of winter spices, alot of winter spices. It smells like a gingerbread cookie is the best way to put it. The taste does not lie. It tastes like a gingerbread cookie. Strong flavors of nutmeg and ginger combine for an overpowering taste. It has a nice mouthfeel. I would say that it is drinkable, but it is very sweet and the spices are overwhelming."
"drinkability - Was ok, like average. Nothing exciting. Little too much on the spices for me."
"Perhaps for dessert with some good homemade apple pie and a hunk of aged cheddar this might serve you well."
"D- This is really blowing my expectations of a winter warmer. The spices, instead of tasting simply of pie, are delicious. And the strength of the smell and taste in this beer is increadible. Great job Harpoon."
"thin mouth feel and over whelming smell and taste of nutmeg and cinnamon. Did I mention the nutmeg and cinnamon? Because that is all you will notice, way too over the top with spices. Hopefully I can pass off the rest of the case on Christmas Eve because after one of these, I want something else to finish the night with."
"Beer should not taste like this...hints of spice are nice, but this overwhelming ""in your face"" dumping of spices in beer is way over the top."
"Very nice work. A different type of holiday beer. To be enjoyed in moderation. I can't imagine having more than 1 or 2 of these in a single sitting."
"Strong, strong taste. Tons of cinnamon, also tastes like some mint. The smell is strong, but actually smells very good, but the taste is on another level. Definitely enjoyable, but I would guess in small quantities. Probably terrific after just coming in from the cold, but I've been on the couch for a few hours. Definitely worth a taste, and an impressive amount of flavor from Harpoon."
"This beer poured a golden copper color with a generous three-finger head that lingers for a while. The smell is definitely festive, with lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste is pretty close to the smell, with a big hit of spicy cinnamon up front leading to some middling nutmeg and just the tiniest bit of hops at the end. The mouthfeel is a very carbonated, which I think matches the spiciness rather well. This is an enjoyable beer, but I wouldn't consider having more than one at a time."
"From a standard-sized bottle, pours a copper-brown color that is relatively lighter-colored compared to most other winter warmers I've sampled... The smell is a powerful cinnamon-fireball essence which bursts through... Taste strongly complements the aroma, with the cinnamon aspect being dominant to the point of almost being overwhelming... Definitely a unique tasting brew and very different than most others out there, but the strong cinnamon flavor seems so apparent that it completely overshadows the main character of the brew... Mouthfeel is okay, but not superb, and being such a flavorful brew, wouldn't want to down more than one at most in a session... all said, an interesting sample, and worth a try..."
"Too spicy, in my opinion. If that was toned down a bit, this would be a very enjoyable beer."
"The drinkability is ok because the thin beer is easy to drink. However, with the amount of spices and sharpness, one couldn't (or would want to) drink too many of these."
"Nice amber color with just a bit of lace and a thick crown. Holy hot cinnamon oil! Cinnamon and nutmeg extract is so overwhelming that you can feel it singeing your nasal cavity...and maybe some ginger and honey. The is Christmas potpourri, with flavors of nutmeg, dry cinnamon bark, ginger, and clove that absolutely dominate. Some sweetness and tartness late in the finish, but almost astringent. The spices particularly cinnamon and nutmeg linger on far too long. Descent mouthfeel and carbonation. Cinnamon and nutmeg is way over the top here as it really just covers up what might be a good beer or maybe its a terrible beer...who knows? This does speak of Christmas...the bad part of Christmas...its like Black Friday stuffed in my mouth, all business and no soul."
"12 oz bottle into tulip glass. A: Amber/red, thick cream-colored head that reduces down to a caked on film. Decent lacing. S: Very strong cinnamon and nutmeg, sort of hard to get much beyond that. Roasted malts, some very distant grassy hops. T: Completely dominated by cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg. A bit of a bitter finish, but again, hard to get much beyond the spice. M: A bit thin, moderate carbonation. D: I'm a bit on the fence. On one hand, the cinnamon spice is kind of nice, especially on a cold winter night. But the beer snob in me has to admit that the thin body and shallow malt profile quickly buckle under the heavy weight of way, way too much spice. If you want christmas in a bottle, this may be for you. If you're feeling scrooge-ish want something a bit more complex, I would steer clear."
"I think this would be a better beer with a different base. Maybe and English style brown?"
"I very much enjoyed this beer and it was very easy to drink with my meal. Head retention was alright, about halfway down it lost it. I was surprised to find it on tap, and it did not disappoint. A great winter beer."
"I do enjoy Harpoon, but I wasn't a fan of their winter warmer. I had it on tap last year, and thought it was pretty good; nice mellow spice flavor, some more sediment, still no head, but good balance and noticeable hop bite. This was like the Hyde to that Jekyl."
"All-in-all, I was disappointed by the WW. I don't like talking trash, but I think Harpoon knows better than this. Winter beers are all about one million subtle, comfortable flavors keeping your taste buds guessing, but this one tells all it's secrets. More weight, more depth, and a little demure would take this beer a long way."
"D = This score follows my observations for smell and taste. If you hate them, this would be a nonstarter for drinkability. On the other hand, it goes down pretty easily, I could see drinking this on a cold afternoon watching it snow outside. Given the plsit personality, I put this one down as firmly in the middle."
"Leave this one on the shelf this Christmas and go find out what Uncle Al spiked the eggnog with."
"Gold colored beer with aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg.Taste was extreme cinnamon and very little else.This is the first beer in my 35 years that I couldn't finish and had to pour down the drain.I don't know what makes this brewery think that people want to drink something that tastes like cinnamon scope.Yuuuuck."
"Drinkability: This beer had like 3x more spice than the typcial pumpkin ale which killed the flavor of the beer. Tried several gulps but ended up pouring the remainder of the glass down the drain."
"M/D: Carbonation is a little high but doesn't throw things off too much. Body is lighter then it should be and comes off watery. Drinkability isn't too bad but it ain't that great either, same goes with the beer overall. This might be passable as a pumpkin ale."
"Pours a pale yellow, and cloudy color with minimal white head that sits on top at first. Smell is cinnamon, spices, nutmeg, pumpkin and it all hits at once. Someone remarked like he smelled like cinnamon toast crunch. Taste is not that great when all the spices hit you at once. Very watery mouthfeelin on this warmer."
"It doesn't taste bad. But just doesn't leave you thinking that you are tasting beer."
"Surprised to see a Harpoon offering in my neck of the woods, and in the mood for a winter warmer I eagerly bought a sixer. The brew pours a clear rusty amber with a standard head. Decent lacing. Smell is a clove punch. Some sweet malt elements are noted. The taste is over whelmed by the clove and other spices. There is no balance and is very unpleasant and artificial. Mouthfeel is slightly sour and not enjoyable. I'm not sure what I am going to do with the remaining 4 beers in my six pack."
"Served a crisp dark orange with an instantly diminishing head. The aroma was quite fragrant with sweet malts, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, The taste was cinnamon and vanilla against sweet malts. Decent, but not great, still better than I remember it from last year. The body was crisp and smooth with medium carbonation. This is an enjoyable beer, but I'd likely pass it over for something else."
"As a long-time fan of Great Lakes Brewing Co.'s Christmas ale, I had high expectations for Harpoon. The initial flavor screams ""CHRISTMAS", yet the lingering nature of the initial flavor, coupled with a mellow after-taste make for a poor ending. The flavor tends to overpower anything eaten with it, yet the beer certainly is far from undrinkable."
"Pours a clean copper color with a small white head. Aromas of a faint cinnamon and nutmeg spice. In the taste, cinnamon, nutmeg and a hint of clove. A smooth mouthfeel and a dry small spicy aftertaste. Big spice flavor, but light for a warmer, nothing more than OK."
"Harpoon is a very good label and overall make excellent beer, but I just don't love this one."
"Pours with a five finger light brown head leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. The nose is something else - the brewer says ""full-bodied rich ale that uses a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg"" I'm glad there is ""just a touch"" of spices, anything more would be pure spice. Drink this now and don't wait for warm weather. Strong spicy flavor, malt and hops seem to be hidden. $1.50 for 12oz from Capitol Convenience, Concord, NH."
"Drinkability: Well, I don't think it's very ""BA"" of me to try and pawn this off on my unsuspecting friends who come visit for the holidays.... I don't just want to pour it down the drain... It seems as though there are some people that LIKE this stuff.... maybe they'll be up for a TRADE.... BEER MAIL ME.... I don't recommend this to anyone...."
"P.S. I did not see the very fine print on the label that reads ""natural flavoring"" until after purchasing it. Buyer beware."
"Drinkability: Great winter beer as is predictable. Lasting aftertaste of nutmeg and again banana."
"They way overdid the spices. It's almost undrinkable. From the malts that I could actually taste, I think this one would be decent if it didn't taste like Big Red gum. Not recommended. If you want a ""wintery"" beer from Harpoon, grab one of their stouts."
"Pours a ruby red color. Aroma is nice and spicy with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove in the nose. Nice! Taste starts out with a nice hint of nutmeg and fades into a bready aftertaste, somewhat like gingerbread. A second sip confirms the same. The nutmeg shows through more than the cinnamon though. Very nice and drinkable. The spice confirms that it's a winter-type beer, which is just in time for the chilly weather we are having. Very nice and perfect for a cold day."
"With that being said the aroma and flavor of the Winter Warmer immediately put me in the mood of the holidays, and I dont know of many things (besides my moms homemade Christmas cookies) that can accomplish that. So, I can bet sometime around November 2008 I will be looking forward again to the first Winter Warmer to arrive. This is a great beer for the holiday season."
"Scott"
"Drinkability: Ug. This has been one of the worst beers I've had in awhile. I understand what is being attempted and I just think it might as well have been a cider. Too one dimensional and hard to enjoy. This beer lacks complexity, body, and overall enjoyability."
"I have had this beer one two different occasions, about 3 years apart. The first time I received it in a beer of the month club and loved the beer. The beer poured a beautiful brown with about finger width head. The smell was great, filled with cinnamon and gingerbread. It had good mouth feel and great drink ability. The flavor was like drinking a liquid gingerbread man. This was one of my favorite US beers. The second time I tried it I was a little disappointed. I dont know if it was the bottle or not. The color, head and mouth feel are the same as above. The taste on the second time around was not as strong and gingerbread man like as the first. The drink ability was not as high as the first time because, the flavor just was not the same. Dont get me wrong, it is still a good beer and well worth trying."
"Even the macro drinkers will have this over a subtle, tasty Oktoberfest, go figure."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a creamy looking off white head. Aroma of nutmeg, cinnamon, and more nutmeg. Taste follows suit, but much more subdued than the aroma would lead you to believe. This is a good thing, but the spice still overpowers any malt or hops that allegedly were used to make this beer. Rather light bodied for a winter warmer as well. Aftertaste is you guessed it dry cinnamon. Overall a one dimensional beer. It is a bad sign when half way through a beer you are thinking about what you want to drink next. Does not hold your interest."
"pours a orange copper color with a large three finger tan head that holds to about a half inch to the finish with a minimal lacing. smell and taste of cinnamon and nutmeg is there but not over powering. light to medium mouthfeel and good carbonation good holiday or winter beer but not something i would drink year round."
"D- good winter beer that goes well with the cold weather. The spices are a little too intense to give this a higher drinkability"
"I don't know about this beer. It's sort of like drinking Christmas, if that were possible. I prefer the winter warmers with a more subtle spice tone; there's nothing subtle about this guy."
"Thanks JB."
"Tasty stuff, but they need to work on the spice balance. And I think this resembles a pumpkin ale more than a winter warmer."
"Overall: To quote Colonel Kurtz, ""The horror... THE HORROR!!!"""
" Harpoon IPA is a good choice, but I would stay away from the winter warmer if I were you."
"Had this one on draft at the South Norwalk Brew House yesterday. This one is a bit confounding. Very little head and no lacing. Nice darkish copper color. No aroma that I could pick up. Taste was unbalanced, with nutmeg and cinnamon predominating, with little malt or hop character. Mouthfeel was very thin. The ABV lends itself to pretty good drinkability. All in all, I was quite disappointed with this one. Really nothing memorable and actually the taste was somewhat disturbing. I usually like the Harpoon stuff, but I won't have this one again, at least this season."
"flavors are very subtle, with definite notes of clove and nutmeg. finish is oddly clean and marginally unpleasant, with lingering spices and a slight bitterness. feel is light with a slightly prickly carbonation, which tends to weaken the flavor. spices push away the beer characteristics just a bit too much."
"D: If you're looking for honey-beer, than this is right up your alley. But since I wasn't, well, it isn't."
"Leftover christmas beer, do people actually like this? Pours a nice dark tan color but that's about the only good of this. Smells? Like cloves, weird plastic scent. Tastes not much better, as described in the smell with a odd banana aftertaste. Overall....don't buy don't drink, and for me this is the first of a six pack. I spent good money on this so I'm gonna set aside or chill very cold then chug it. Not worth your time or money, shame on you Harpoon!!"
"this beer is straight up brown. no frills. it's got a fluffy head that has nice body. it kind of smells like a dog, though. and the taste is not much better. cinnamon, just like the rest of the reviews. it's intriguing at first, but then not really."
"D - only had one. More that the night was getting late than the beer. That said, with this strong a spice flavor two would be my max in a session."
"I don't think this would make a very good session beer but is a nice change once in a while when you're in the mood."
"D: A bottle is enough unless you really, really, REALLY love winter warmers. I don't, so the remaining four bottles will most likely be poured down the drain."
"My daughter loves this beer. I think that's because she lives in Florida and rarely gets to drink it. It's a clear orange color with a small head. A sweet, spicy aroma. All I could taste was cinnamon, not exactly what I was looking for. I think this is an OK winter warmer, but too aggressive with the spice."
"Some of my friends are always raving about this beer and it seemed I was the only one who hadn't tried it yet. I guess I had high expectations because Harpoon certainly does makes some awesome brews. This however, isnt one of them. Poured a semi-hazy light amber color with a small white head. Aromas of spice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. Not much else, maybe some faint hops somewhere in the tail. Tastes just like it smells, a lot of spice and...not much else. This isnt your usual winter warmer. If you're looking for an easy drinking brew around the holidays, I would go for this. Otherwise I would pass for something more substantial if you want a real winter warmer."
"Overall, I found this beer to be very enjoyable and perfect around the holiday season. The spices may be too much for some to handle, but I would much rather have this over a typical winter warmer."
"I havnt had this beer in years. It was one of the first ""winter"" beers I ever got into. I remember it as liquid pumpkin pie actually. Ok color-somewhat of an amber,golden hue to it. Way overspiced aroma. Plenty of nutmeg and cloves here. Flavor is the same way. Someone in the brew house has quite the heavy hand with the spices. No other real flavors the spices are way over done. Ok body. Not what I remember at all. I might have appreciated it 15 or more years ago as it was a great ""niche"" beer then. No longer my cup of tea. Boost the malt and lower the spices you might have something."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark copper color with about an inch off-white head. It smells very spicy, like cinnamon and nutmeg. I can't smell anything else in this beer as the spices are so strong. The taste is pretty much the same way it smells, spicy. The mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it does go down easy. The beer looks and smells nice, but in my opinion there's too much spice in it. With that being said, I'd drink it again sometime."
"This amount of spicing is not for me. I have never come across a beer that was even close to being as spiced as this. Those of you that like it can have it; I want nothing to do with it. I'll leave on a positive note. The beer smells nice."
"D - Again, wonderful holiday spice. Almost there, if a heavier mouthfeel."
"Appears dark orangish red in color with a fizzy little white head, slight lacing. Smells of nothing but cinnamon. Taste of nothing but cinnamon with a little touch of nutmeg. Nothing else. A zesty tingle on the tongue at first, nice medium body, but the cinnamon is too much. Getting a case of this would be a bad idea unless you really like the taste of cinnamon and don't really care for typical winter beer tastes."
"Drinkability--I wouldn't turn a free one down, but I'm not planning on picking this one up at the store."
"I like mildly spiced holiday beers, no overwhelming ones. I realize that there are some out there who like this, I just don't. There is only one other beer that I disliked more than this one."
"God bless Harpoon for being one of the first micros to come out big and hard but they just aren't doing much of anything impressive these days. I would pass on this one."
"I passed this one over quite a few years now and having finally tried it, Im sorry I did. The truly appetizing aroma features fruit and spice (particularly sweet ginger). The flavor is more of the same, but even better: sweet fruit (mainly berry) blends deliciously with fairly intense spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little ginger too) and all of it is rounded out nicely by a firm, malty backbone. Tangy, lengthy finish. This brew does a nice job of pulling of those holiday flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but really, its not so bad and it makes for a more drinkable beer anyway. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is watery and thin, and not especially pleasant. You could drink a few of these, if you had to, but why? I wouldn't even reccomend it with dessert, just because there are so many better brews in this style. Skip it."
"This beer disappoints. However, I'm willing to concede that it would likely be a nice complement to a seasonal desert, pumpkin pie, etc. Anything that incorporates the same types of spice."
"I like this kind of beer on occassion but really couldn't see more than one, wishing for something cleaner tasting and less doctored for session drinking."
"I enjoy a spiced winter warmer as much as anyone, but I want to be able to taste the beer, not just the spice. I actually tried this because a friend noted how ""cinnamony"" it tasted. This observation proved to be all too true. It has such an overpowering flavor of cinnamon and nutmeg that I seriously considered giving up on it and ordering something else. It just seemed that these spices were poured into this beer with reckless disregard for the malt and hops (far beyond the spiciness of a pumkin ale). The best winter warmers are characterized by a subtly of spicing, but this concept was lost on the brewers at Harpoon (for whom I do have an overall very high regard). It was a very interesting beer to try once, but once was definitely enough."
"I would put this one in the love it or hate it category. It is very spicy, major hints of cinnamon. Not much of a head, but that could have been a combination of my bad pour, and the odd shaped glass they gave me. Personally I found it easy to drink. It had a rich, spicy taste, with a slight aftertaste. If you don't like spicy beer steer clear of this one, but if are into them, I would definitely give it a try."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- At the very beginning, the beer has a nice, medium consistency that feels good. As the tasting goes on, it flattens and becomes more of an average texture. Unfortunately, there is no redeeming quality that would warrant another sampling of this offering from Harpoon."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spiced, with a thin finish. Ok for a beginner trying to figure out what a spiced ale/winter warmer brew is about."
"the flavor is spicy, malty, bit of hopsack, body is a little watery."
"Pours a nice golden amber. Nice white head with decent retention, and good lacing.Body is thin to medium with some carbionation. Smell is of spice. Taste is of cinnamon, and sweet fruit. More like a pumpkin ale than a winter warmer. Not great,but worth a try."
"The only beer I've had that possibly has more cinnamon flavor than this is Shipyard's Pumpkin ale. Needless to say, heavy cinnamon flavoring does not lend itself well to beer. It ends up being overly sweet and difficult to finish. That's pretty much the base of this beer - cinnamon, cinnamon, cinnamon. I didnt particularly enjoy this and I'm glad I only bought a single, as I dont want to have it again."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite American Winter Warmers with the great added spices."
"I would have liked to have a fresh Winter Warmer to compare this to, but that wasnt going to happen. Im sure that one will taste quite different"
"Drinkability - ok, now the ""subjective"" portion: In my opinion, the attempt to place the ""spice"" component into this beer has led to a horrid overbalance. There is nothing beyond the cinnamon and nutmeg, no chance of it being more than something of a ""novel"" beer. If traditionally an English winter warmer didn't have spices added, why is harpoon attempting to make this such an overpowering spice-based beer? That being said, I happen to like cinnamon and nutmeg so I wasn't feeling like slamming this beer as hard as others have (that's my bias). Perhaps I'll try more in this style to determine what ""standard"" to better judge this beer. For now tho, I'll let one warm up and see how it does at room temp with a fire going. Either that, or I'll just pour a glass of 12 year old Cragganmore single-malt scotch and get a better ""winter warmer"" feel."
"A decent winter warmer, although it doesn't warm that much. Spice character is nice, but I'd like it to be a little stronger to back it up. I'd consider this a ""session"" winter warmer, if that makes any sense."
"While it's not very difficult to drink, it's just too spiced for my taste."
"Poured a thin copper color with a light head. No lace to speak of. Aroma was a hodgepodge of spices. I couldn't really pinpoint one but you could tell it had nutmeg, some cinammon, and some other stuff hard to figure out. Taste was a bit overpowering for me in the spice department too, hitting hard up front, at the roof of the mouth, and again in the aftertaste. Some noticeable malt, but even that was overtaken by the spices. The mouthfeel was actually a pleasant surprise: I figured the thin pour might be reflected in the mouthfeel, but it was solid and respectable. I probably won't try this beer again, but if you like spice-filled beers, you should give it a shot."
"Well this was a let down. This beer was all spice, no substance. Smelled of nutmeg and tasted of nutmeg with cinnamon with a little bitterness. So it basically tasted like alcoholic spice-water. I can't believe I have a whole 6-pack of this, what the heck was Harpoon thinking?"
"D: If it was Christmas Eve, this is the beer I'm drinking. Unfortunately, otherwise its really not the one for me."
"Clear amber/red body with little head to speak of... Smells like cinnamon and nutmeg... Tastes very cinnamon-y, but not to the point of being overwealming I think... Fairly enjoyable, despite the light body and fairly one-dimensional flavor. Fairly drinkable anyway..."
"M&D - very smooth and crisp, a great aroma without being to bitter, even the girlfirned like it, and she thinks most craft beer tastes the same, she enjoyed the mellow, sweet spiciness of this beer, as did i, Harpoon does it again"
"i'm not too familiar with this style. so i guess i really didn't know what to expect. the spices are slightly overwhelming but for some reason it doesn't take away from the beer that much for me. i kept finding myself wanting another drink. not something i could see drinking in july, but for the cold new england months that lie ahead and with the harpoon brewery being about 10 min. away, this beer might pop up frequently this winter."
"Pours a dark, slightly dull amber with little to no head. Big time spice aroma, but I'm not good enough at identifying individual spices to run them through. It's quite a bit, though -- complex but somehow too overt, a bit unappealing. On the palate, there's an initial carbonation bite, followed by slightly sweet malts, with those spices always in the back of the palate. The finish is thick and cloying with the spice. Overall, this is mediocre. Way too much spice, and what's in here is not handled with enough subtlety. Instead of creating a cunningly spiced beer, Harpoon has made a pure spice-delivery system masquerading as a beer."
"DA: Tried it, now it's time to move on."
"I'm normally a big proponent of Harpoon beers but I'd be very hesitant to try another winter warmer!"
"D: Tasty, mild kick, good representation of style, I once sat down and killed a sixer of this beer very quickly, so I’ll say that it goes down quite easy; however it is a bit filling."
"There was a wet head on the top for a little bit and the first few sips gave some nice lacing. The color is a dull amber with a hint of orange. The nose is pure banana bread with some clove and nutmeg coming through. It just reminds me of my mom baking bread during the holidays. Taste is about the same with those particular spices. Carbonation level fits the beer very well. Pleasent mouthfeel and a wonderful lingering taste of spices. Based on the style this beer does it extremely well."
"I found this Harpoon style to be very interesting. The smell is outstanding, a little light in body with a nice, crispy, carbonated, cinnamon backlash on the tongue on the follow through. Many other spices as well, perhaps vanilla and definitely, nutmeg. I recommend giving this brew a shot, as I feel it is Harpoon's best."
"Overall, a very dirnkable beer considering its spicy makeup. Just ask anyone who saw me on Christmas Eve."
"Head was lacking; nice lightly amber color, like honey. The aroma was wonderful - estery, spicy, a lot of cinnamon, very unique. The flavor was good too, with a crisp start that fades into a slightly sweet without being cloying finish. Spices, esters (a tad bubblegum?) blend together nicely. The beer doesn't seem overly strong but I think it could use more body - seems a bit thin. Oddly I rarely pick on that but this beer could use it and it hurts the drinkability some. Otherwise its delicious."
"Taste is biscuity malt. Sweet spice, clove and cinnamon. A bit haphazard. Lightly sweet and sticky. Not bad, better than expected."
"Winter Warmer grew on me from first sip to last. Once I got out of the mindset of 'hearty, sippable and warming' and accepted the possibility of a lighter, easy drinking, spice-added winter ale, I enjoyed it more and stopped thinking of ways in which it falls short."
"Overall: If you like 'em spicy you'll definately like this. The spice seemed to be a bit much at times for me, but a solid effort nonetheless. A decent brew, but probably something I won't drink again."
"Poured a medium-amber color with slightly off-white creamy head. Smell is significant for cinnamon, and while not really over-powering, it does relegate any thing else to the background. Taste also presents a nice cinnamon taste, and some nice maltiness in the background is akso to be found. Finish is a nice spicy maltiness, but a slight bitterness at the very end. The cinnamon flavors are strong enough to be enjoyed, without being so strong as to block any other flavor elements. That being said, one of these at a sitting is enough. Anymore would decrease the enojoyment."
"Drinkability: OK, towards the end of the pint as the carb died and it warmed up slightly, the syrup really came out. This is a yummy beer for a pint, but I can't imagine having 2."
"This was one of the first beers I ever had. I poured it into a glass. The head was not as big as I would have liked. The color was lighter than I was expecting, but a dark amber nevertheless. The smell was strong with cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg, and so was the taste. It was almost a dessert beer, in my eyes. I absolutely loved it when I first had it and it's still my favorite winter warmer."
"Looks nice with a good brown color, thick head, and ultimately a nice lacing. Typical winter spices on the nose. Taste isn't really that exceptional. Spices and then some alcohol bite. Mouthfeel was pretty smooth. As I alluded to when I first reviewed this on-tap, the closer you can have this to the Christmas season the more you will like this beer."
"A good try by Harpoon, but it just didn't have the oomph or the melding of a good winter warmer. Looks amber in color with a sparkle of spice floating in there. Good head retention and viscocity. Smells moderately malty with caramel and toffee notes. Spices of nutmeg and cinemon go along with a solid hop addition. Tastes much like an amber ale, with spices added. Moderately malty, with a light grain flavor. Easy on the palate with creamy carbonation. Finishes a little sweet and sticky and a little less than clean. A nutmeg aftertaste. Worth a try."
"Pours a clear brownish-copper with a medium-sized, light tan, pillowy, slowly diminishing head. Smells of cinnamon, yeast, some mild malts, and a little nutmeg. More of the same in the taste except with a honey-like sweetness up front and more of a nutmeg presence. Then I got sidetracked and left the beer sit for a good half-hour. What I tasted then was a beer MUCH heavier on the nutmeg, totally overpowering everything. It has a medium body, slightly chalky dry texture, and moderate carbonation. I never was much of a fan of the spiced beers, but Ive learned to appreciate ones that are done tastefully. This beer was ok as long as it was mostly cold. Not bad but nothing Ill be having again any time soon."
"Body is between light and medium, with forced carbonation and a sticky mouthfeel with a crisp, almost coarse texture. I'll take a Cold Mountain or OSA over this any day!"
"This beer did not do it for me and was not very drinkable. The spice was overly dominant. I prefer the warmth from my winter warmers to come from hearty malt and alcohol, not chock full of cinnamon and nutmeg. I'll pass on this one again."
"Well, that's basically about it... ""Beer with spices"" that's what the label says. It does not seem like they put too much thought into this brew. Maybe the theory was to just add spice and that was about it. Definitely can smell and ""feel"" the cinnamon, which hides all the rest. Poured a very little head towards the end which dissapated quickly. I expected to enjoy this, but there was very liitle taste and no hops. However, it is warming which is what one would expect from a Winter Brew. Very drinkable, but not enjoyable."
"Poured a hazy, pale orange color with a medium head. Smell was all spice - you can really get a good whiff of the nutmeg. Taste was initially pleasing with lots of spice. However, after the first few sips, it felt like my tongue was coated with nutmeg. Not satisfying at all. I could barely finish one, which was all I had. If you like nutmeg, this is the beer for you. Don't think I'll be picking this one up again until the nutmeg load is mellowed."
"Pours a reddish brown with a thin head. Smells of cinnamon & nutmeg spices. Very drinkable for the style although not as high quality as say Anchor.. Tastes like it came off cask almost but just not as lively. Mouthfeel is medium leaning towards the thin side. Nothing standout about this brew but a nice holiday offering. One was enough for me. Worth a try and this only cost me $3."
"To be sure, There are lesser beers on the market. And there are lesser winter seasonals on the market. And there are even lesser seasonals on the market from New England, Massachusetts no less. But that's another review for another day. I would pass on this."
"Had this on tap at monty's Korner, Rochester, NY. Very nice brown amber color. The smell was cinnamonny! Very christmaslike. The taste is similar, not overspiced but enough to give the beer good flavor. Nutmeg and gingerbread flavors are there. Mouthfeel is kinda medium light. Very drinkable!"
"Cheers!"
"Harpoon Winter Warmer is a seasonal brew that I assume is made for the holidays. The beer poured a nice amber color with an average head. The head stayed for the beer and laced down the glass nicely. The smell was a barrage of cinnamon, nutmeg, and other baking spices. It was almost enough to turn me away but I tried it. The taste was not overpowering but there were many of the spices found in the aroma. A few hops were present but masked and no true malt character. Not very drinkable do to the spice content but something to say I have tried."
"Flavors are unbalanced and bland. I wouldn't have more than one, and wouldn't recommend."
"Overall, a not particularly well done warmer that is basically cinnamon tinged alcohol. Not recommended."
"I don't think this beer is nasty or undrinkable, but it could easily be improved. I enjoy the cinnamon, but it really needs plenty of malt to support it and that is where this beer falls flat."
"cheers..."
"overall- besides the pepermint/cinnamon flavor which ruins the beer IMO it would be decent, but thats not the case."
"Notes: tried some dark and white chocolates and the white goes best with the spices. The dark not so well. Either way an average beer at best."
"This beer pours a translucent dark amber color with a good off-white head that holds decently with moderate lacing. It smells nicely of cinamon but there is little presence of hops. The taste is dominated by by cinamon and gingerbread but no real ""beer"" taste to it. THe initial taste is good but it could use something else as it hits the back of one's throat. It feels a little watery but there is good carbonation. The beer is a littel overwhelming especially when you drink multiple, and it leaves you wanting more. Not more of the beer but more out of the beer. Just way to much cinamon flavor"
"D= Could not finish the serving, my mouth was on fire and I had a pepper hot flash sometime later."
"I described this beer to a friend as ""Christmas in a Bottle"" because of the taste of nutmeg and cinnamon. Definitely reminds me of the holiday season."
"Thankfully this was left behind by someone and I didn't waste my money on it"
"I may try this again in the future when they have other batches, but for the rest of this year I will avoid."
"Gingerbread cookie in a bottle is all I have to say. I have a long history with this beer. I look forward to it every year. It is rich and creamy with the perfect blend of holiday spice. Just a hint a hint of nutmeg and ginger make it very tasty. Hits the spot on Christmas Day."
"A winter beer that I actually like. Huh? I'm surprised at myself. If it were possiblt to make liquid satin, this beer would compare well. Smooth, rich and creamy. Just like satin sheets. Dark brown in color that was just slightly opaque. Not much of any head. Nose was mildly spice. Flavor was a very relaxing maple syrup and Christmas Eve spices with a heavy malt base. Hops were ever-so-slightly present. This beer was just fantastic because of the feel and went greatly towards making this a winter beer I actually enjoyed."
"Drinkability/notes  Christmas in a bottle is a nice way to describe this, but its kind of a let down. I dont want a second right away. Tastes like a novelty."
"I was a little disappointed in this year's Winter Warmer. It seemed thinner than the batch the year before.My favorite aspect is the cinnamon aroma which really wonderful and not too overpowering. It is a nice light flavored beer that is very easy to drink."
"Cinammon toast crunch in a bottle...A lovely spiced beer that sooths the soul on a cold winter day. My big wish for this beer is simply more - it has a nice, balanced taste, but it just needs to be stronger. More cinammon, more hops, more more more. It could be me, but it seems like this beer was much more robust 10 years ago than today. I wonder if Harpoon toned it down to appease the masses. When I first partook in this one long ago, I was hit with lot's of flavor. Perhaps my taste buds weren't as fully developed. But I still enjoy it today even if it does not live up to it's potential."
"That said - this isn't warming my winter. It's too light in taste and in mouthfeel to qualify as a good winter beer in my opinion. It's cold as @#$& in Massachusetts in the winter and I need a bit more than this."
"This beer is a reddish color with a thin head. It smells like cinnamon. The taste is of cinnamon and a hint of hops thrown in. The taste is overwhemingly spicy. A bit too much for my taste. The mouthfeel is more about spice and less about beer. Overall, not a bad beer but not one of the best seasonals out there. Worth a shot but approach cautiously."
"Coppery brown, 1 inch of foam that falls to a ring with a few islands of bubbles. Nose is malt and spices, mostly nutmeg. Some alcohol presence is sensed. The taste is rather ""pumpkin ale""ish. Maybe the cinnamon is making itself felt, but I cannot distinguish it. Mouthfeel is way too thin for such a malty beverage. Easy to drink, but not compelling."
"Overall = Disappointing but not awful. I most certainly won't spend money on it again but it's not something you'd pour down the drain."
"Poured into a pint glass after sitting out for 10 minutes. The beer has a very nice copper-orange color with a small head that quickly disappears. Smells like ginger bread cookies straight from the oven. If a beer could smell like Christmas, this one does. Up front there is an intense combination of ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg with sweet malt fleshing it out. I detected a little hop bitterness after swallowing. The spices don't feel balanced with the beer and turn me off immeadiately. It feels like they are trying to cover something up. I'll stick to Great Lakes."
"The mouth feel is OK and it's certainly drinkable. If I can find it on the west coast I'll try it again."
"Pours a medium very clear amber with a 1 finger head and good/average lace. Hints of cinnamon and ginger in the aroma. A bit of orange and caramel as well - somewhat fruity. Earthy malty taste upfront with a definate cinnamon presence - too much in my opinion. Typical orange and ginger flavors as well. Very much a average winter warmer. Not a bad beer but there are better choices."
"I liked this beer. It is spiced powerfully with cinnamon and nutmeg. There is is definitely a malt backbone and a hint of hops. Despite the fact that this beer is relatively unconventional, I like it quite a bit. It pours an amber with a below average head. The best way to describe the beer is that it tastes like Christmas morning. It just has that late fall/early winter spice that I associate with the holidays."
"Might go well with a slice of pumpkin pie."
"This would certainly be a nice beer for the ski clubhouse, or for celebrating a successfully decorated Christmas tree."
"Mouthfeel is medium and lightly bubbly, not exactly what I'd expect from a winter warmer. Fairly drinkable, but... just too much spice in the end."
"This beer is not overly spicy and rather easy to drink. The flavor still tastes great even after a few months in the fridge."
"Alone the smell and tastes of cinammon and nutmeg are a little strong and take away some from the beer. The at my local alehouse (Croxley Ales) the bartender showed me that when you mix it some hard cider (sweeter brands like woodchuck or woodpecker) it gives it a taste and smell of apple pie. mix about 3/4 harpoon to 1/4 cider. Turns out quite a good concoction."
"A decent winter warmer. Its not top beer smell, but you can smell spices and yeast on top of it. You can see the hps, it preserved well over the winter. Decent spice, cinammon and nutmeg, citrus and not overpowering malt nor yeast taste. Medium mouthfeel."
"Clear amber body with a small offwhite head that retains decently and leaves some sparse patchy lace. Aroma is unusual, reminding me of a wintergreen scented Coca Cola. A dash of cinnamon in the background. Mouthfeel is lightbodied with medium carbonation. Taste is some light caramel maltiness that gets lost in the spices. I taste mostly wintergreen, but cinnamon and nutmeg are also prominent. Some hop bitterness comes on toward the middle and the finish is spicy bitter with a nutmeg aftertaste. Very light in body for a winter warmer. This one fares poorly compared to most of the other winter warmers I've sampled this season."
"Manufactured spice. This isn't the ""real deal"" for this style. It's certainly quaffable, but my wife dumped her portion."
"Good, but not great."
"Drinkability: It was a tasty beer and I think I am better for having drank it. But it is winter right now and this beer was not really a warmer. I felt no warmer after drinking it. I don't know the ABV, but it's not much. A good beer for sure, but don't expect the nice warmth of a barleywine."
"On the palate it behaves more discreetly, with dry, nutty maltiness, plenty of gassy lift and raw, tannic spices. The finish features an awkward resolution of plain, low-calorie sweetener and spicy astringency. It's light to medium-bodied -- meant as a flavored, refreshing drinker. All throughout, the perfumy, cosmetic impressions of packaged dessert food dominate."
"I'd try it again for the holidays, though I'd look for a little more ""punch"" for a true winter warmer."
"The cinnamon is immediately noticeable in the nose of this reddish-amber ale. It's bright and fresh and welcoming! It's creamy ivory-colored head holds well, and it leaves some small areas of craggy lace at the outset of the glass. In the mouth it's medium-light bodied but still somewhat creamy and surprisingly smooth. The softness is a nice change of pace; and it's restrained carbonation helps balance it by letting the malt come through rather than accentuating its spiciness. Nutmeg and some mild cloves appear in the flavor along with the cinnamon and some yeasty fruitiness. Initially some malt gets through (although the spices do start to becoming cloying halfway through), and it's just-delicately caramelish and mildly biscuity. It's flavors are subtle except for the spice, but it's well-balanced. The malt is mild; the bitterness is sublime; and it's spices are clear but kept in check. It's a really nice holiday beer that would be perfect before, during, or after a holiday meal; but I'm not sure how drinkable it would remain outside of a special event. I'd enjoy one at the pub, but I don't think I'd go beyond that - personal preference."
"Not a bad brew at all. Pours a very pleasing ruby brown color that is especially opaque. Head is moderate. Smell is exceptionally potent for beer, smelling of spice, nutmeg, and brown sugar. Taste is what a good holiday beer should be. Reminds me a quite a bit of pumpkin beer, although I dont think there is any pumpkin in it. Certainly very spice dominated, with hops becoming apparent in the after sips. A fun brew, but probably not a session beer, its a little overpowering."
"Well this is a another Winter Warmer that leaves me still chilly. This would have been a better beer with the alcohol content and body pumped up a little and the spices I thought would have better enjoyed. A mild spiced beer and it reminds you of the spices in some of the pumpkin fall classics which I think are nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon in this beer and maybe some allspice too. This was a copper color with a decent built head the hung around for a little. It benifitted from getting out of the bottle (how I first had it at a party) and into a glass as the smells of the spices come out more and it is better slightly warm. This is a good session beer but as a WW it leaves a lot to be wanted in body. MPF is a WW should warm and taste big."
"It smells delicious, and every winter Im anxious to try it. However, after a couple sips the spiced taste of cinnamon is a bit overwhelming. It would be fantastic as an after dinner drink. I prefer Sam Adams Winter a bit more  just as full with less spice."
"The presentation between a Harpoon Winter Warmer and a cup of hot apple cinnamon tea is very comparable in color and smell. The tastes of the combination above is definite throughout and adds a very nice touch to this style. Very good mouthfeel if this was most other styles, however, with a winter warmer, it was not too profound. Enjoyed very much after dinner with some cheesecake. May have enjoyed only one more."
"On draught at Lazy Chameleon. Clear dark copper color with a thin light beige head and sparse lacing. Cinnamon and other spices in the nose, along with a touch of malt. Light-bodied, considering they are throwing the term ""winter warmer"" around. Not much warming going on here. Lightly spiced flavor, with a little bit of malt and hops thrown in. Kind of watery overall. The finish returns to the cinnamon, plus a faint fruity aftertaste. So-so."
"I'm learning I'm not much of a winter beer person, but I LOVE one that is low on spice (like Sprechers or Goose island). I also prefer one that appears thicker and leans to maltier. This one is not low enough on the spice for my tastes, but as far as a winter goes, it is lower than average. I would recommend this for a person interested in experimenting with winter beers."
"Drinkability - very nice stuff, one of my favorite styles anyway, but just hit me right."
"This is a strange beer for me. I enjoy the aroma. I enjoy the taste until about mid bottle, at which time it becomes cloying and a little overwhelming, thus my low drinkability rating...I definitely wouldn't want more than 1. It is perhaps the least thirst quenching beer I've ever had...it coats my mouth and makes me smack my lips looking for some water. I love much of what Harpoon does, so it pains me to give them a low rating, but this beer just doesn't really do it for me."
"Bender Factor: This is the best brew from Harpoon. In March, this is a real winner. A ""session"" brew, good for Chrimas day while unwrapping presents with the parents and relatives."
"Clear copper color. Nice looking creamy head, but it quickly dissipates. Very thin malt aroma almost entirely overwhelmed by spices. Flavor also dominated by spices. According to the bottle, this beer has ""a touch of cinammon and nutmeg."" More like an onslaught. Beyond the spices, there is a touch of hop bitterness. Overall, not a pleasant flavor. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. I definitely would not drink a second. Finishing the first was a chore. Disappointing."
"Pours medium amber-red with a little foamy head, nice retention. Very nice coloring. Smells of malts and a hint of hops along with some spice in the nose. Taste was not so spicey, I was left wanting more. However, the malts with the hops hint was very soothing and enjoyable. High-quality mouthfeel, smooth and consistent. I'd drink it again, but I prefer a spicier winter beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, formed a beige 1/2"" head over the copper hued brew. Lacing is pretty good, considering the amazing disappearing head. Aroma is noteworthy in that the dominant characteristic is cinnamon. Taste is lightly of pumpkin, and quickly dominated by the cinnamon. Lingers in the mouth as well. Mouthfeel is thin, and not terribly pleasant, with the cinnamon sort of burning into the taste buds. Drinkability of this one for me, due to over-spicing, is not so great. Plenty of better winter warmers out there. Pick one of them."
"Overall- a definite winter beer! Tastes soooo good. Should be called a pumpkin ale though!"
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a malty aroma that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with corriander, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The taste is decent. It is full of spices and ""winter"" flavors, but it is weak in malts and is watery on the finish. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer needs more body and alcohol. I love the spices, but it needs more crystal malts. It is really watery on the finish. This is a decent winter warmer. The problem is that it's weak and watery and it doesn't warm at all."
"A so-so beer if I'm in the mood for it. Definitely wouldn't drink one of these after already having one."
"I got a bitter after taste though so I would only have one or two."
"Very much on the light side for a winter warmer."
"5.5% ABV"
"The taste was mostly of nutmeg, which was very strong on the aftertaste. I don't think I could drink more than one of these in a sitting - too spiced and too fas away from normal beer flavors for my tastes."
"Starts off sweet like pumpkin pie with a smooth hoppy finish that is slightly bitter. Enjoyable, but I can't fathom drinking this everyday."
"Poured a clear and deep orange amber, and was topped off with a thin head of white foam. The aroma yields a soft spiciness thats full of cinnamon and others similar to pumpkin pie spices, with nutmeg and maybe a touch of pepper. The taste is lightly touched with sweet malts and has a subtle and soft spiciness. The body is a bit thin, but the lightness is agreeable and balances well with the rest of the beer. Pleasantly flavorful, very drinkable."
"Epilogue: I wrote the review above after trying the first bottle in six-pack. Now that I've finished them all, I like this one more. It's more drinkable than I first thought, and the taste didn't strike me as overly quirky, like it did the first time. I'm still not in love with it, and I'd recommend Young's Winter Warmer over this one, but Harpoon did come up with something interesting here."
"Harpoon Winter Warmer 2002-03. The color was dark amber/copper. It had a nice head and plenty of lace. The aroma was spicey, mostly nutmeg and cinnamon. These spices were also prominent in the taste. The overall result was the rest of the beer's elements were well concealed. Carbonation was good and some malt sweetness and hop bite could be discerned. The finish was not very bitter and just a bit dry. Too spicey for me or maybe I just had no Xmas spirit left when I tried this beer in January 2003."
"Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the bottle!"
"Orange caramel in color. Very minimal head or stick. Straight off, smells like an apple pie. I can smell the fruit, the cinnamon and even the crust. Damn, it tastes like an apple pie too! Lots of fruit and spice, with a dusting of malty pie crust. A tad bitter on the finish in a fruity apple skin sort of way. A rather strange drink? It makes me wish macdonalds made those awesome deep fried apple pies like they did back in the late 70's. This would be a nice pairing."
"This beer pours an amber to light brown color with a decent white head. A pretty standard Holiday beer, cinnamon, nutmeg, maybe a little clove thrown in for good measures. A nice beer. One that I am sure I will enjoy in the future. It's nice to see Harpoon's distribution reaching my area."
"Drinkability--Excellent novelty beer, not one I'd repeatedly have."
"Might be tastier with a little more malt richness."
"I'd drink another couple of pints, but I think I'll move on to something a little better..."
"Harpoon is one of my favorites, and I'm always pulling for them. This beer is far from their best efforts."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a quickly dissipating light tan head. A spiced ale aroma with notes of nutmeg in the forefront. There is a hint of cinnamon and a bit of banana ester here as well. The beer has a nice medium body to it, which I like. The spicing is quite evident in the taste and is reminiscent of a rich spice cake. The light malty sweetness compliments the spices nicely. Could perhaps be a little bit more carbonated. A pretty nice interpretation of a spiced ale, though perhaps a bit too spice oriented for my tastes."
"Pours a simple amber with an orange tint. The white head settles quickly... not very interesting so far. Smell, woah! Gingerbread. Is this a cookie or a beer. Tastes of ginger and spice, almost like candy. No hop notes or alcohol... not a traditional winter brew at all. Taste is much the same. Candy candy candy. This is actually a pretty interesting brew, but should not ever be categorized as a winter brew... a christmas if anything, but not in the traditional sense. Mothfeel is moderately carbonated. This beer belongs in the ""other"" category, and is fun, but nothing I would seek out again."
"Crystal clear ruddy bronze hue. Head fizzles into a thin, soapy layer that leaves sparse froth. Pungent, sharp cinnamon and nutmeg dominate the aroma. Token medium lovibond crystal is secondary. One dimensional and prosaic aromawise. In flavor, cinnamon is more subdued, but nutmeg is assertive, and nearly overwhelming. Meager dark toffee and sweet ginger cookie impressions linger on the palate. Very lightly hopped, leaving ample residual sweetness. No discernible hop flavor, save a trace earthy undertone. Skimpy in body, and only passably dextrinous in mouthfeel. Static in flavor, this brew exhibits no change in character as it warms, due to the lack of noteable malt character. Finishes sweet, with an odd suggestion of pumpkin pie spiced warm cola. Not a particularly good spiced ale, but not offensive either. Rather insipid."
"Showed up in the December Beer of the Month Club shipment. Pours a large, foamy head out of the bottle that goes away almost as quickly as it appears. A light amber color with very little carbonation in the glass. Nose is more like a spiced cider than beer - overwhelmingly nutmeg and cinnamon. Taste is more of the same - nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, clove, a hint of orange. Not much hop, a little bit of malt. Slightly dry on the finish, with a bit of orange and cinnamon. Very interesting. Definitely not a session beer, but worth a try every now and then."
"Medium amber color. Small head. Aroma is NUTMEG!!!, allspice, cinnamon and oranges. A light bodied winter warmer. Malts are fruity and sweet with a touch of orange and citrus, Hops are slightly spicy, but are sort of overwhelmed but the nutmeg and cinnamon. Despite that flaw this beer sort of works. Its a nice light flavorful and spicy winter warmer. The spiciness goes away rather quickly and you are left drinking a nice light winter beer. Its different for a winter beer, but it works. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is spicy and nutmeggy."
"Would you like a little beer with your cinnamon? Just too much spicing. If drinking apple cider is your thing, then you might like this; personally, this isn't one high on my to-drink list in the future."
"Orange with smallish head, minimal retention and lacing. Smells like nutmeg and caramel malt. There is some hop aroma in there with the spicing, but the spicing is dominant. Not subtle. Taste follows up similarly, with rather bland malt and hops covered by a big dose of nutmeg and I guess a bit of cinnamon. Flavors do not mesh very well, and the feel is thin and harsh carbonation. Overall not a very impressive brew."
"Thanks, though, to ManekiNeko for introducing me to this ale."
"Poured out an amber brown with a large bubbled off-white head that disappeared within seconds. Smell is heavy on cinnamon and nutmeg, kinda cidery, with a hint of fusels. Taste is very blah - hint of dark malt at the beginning, and then nutmeg and cinnamon overshadow everything else. Very thin body, citrus and astringency in the finish. Not that great, should've picked up a 6 pack instead of the 12."
"Flavor of nutmeg and cinnamon, very little malt or hops noted early on, but the malt fills in as the brew warms a bit. A bit thin in the feel, but not overly watery. Overall a decently drinkable beer, if you're into the style."
"Delivered to Moscow as part of a five-pack of U.S. winter beers, this is definitely the weakest of the bunch. Pours a slightly cloudy pale copper under a very thin, fizzy and short-lived off white head. The nose is very spicy - definitely nutmeg, rather like my grandmother's coffeecake. The mouth is very carbonated, and heavy with spices. The taste combines nutmeg with cinnamon for a distinct sweet pastry experience. The hops are very noticeable at all until well after the liquid is gone. Most of the aftertaste is, nonetheless, sugar and spice. Not really my cup of tea..."
"The beer pours an aubern, brown with a decent head that fades rather quickly. No lacong to speak of. The cinnamin and nutmeg aromas hit the nose very quickly and are quite nice for the style. The aromas do not fade and improve as the beer warms. The taste follows suit with spicey ginger, brown sugar and cinnamin dominating before a decent dry finish. This is a decent winter spiced beer that delivered exactly as it promised on the label. I couldn't tip more than two, however, before the spices got in the way of the beer; but as an occasional readily available seasonal ale, it was OK!!"
"This one would lose its appeal pretty quickly."
"Appearance Thin bubbles in a decent sized head dwindle very quickly leaving behind the copper amber body behind with very thin specks of lacing. Aroma: Primarily nutmeg and cinnamon this one takes a hint from Great Lakes but goes off down the wrong path making the spices the primary focal point. Taste: Barrages of nutmeg and cinnamon not a beer it's candy like but not in a good way. There's some alcohol in each sip followed by Christmas spices but guess what that's all that's here so one sided give me a complex Christmas ale. Mouthfeel: Thin body I don't know what Harpoon was thinking with this one, starts to just become watery with a thin amount of sryup texture from all the cinnamon and nutmeg extracts used. Drinkability: Wow, not a beer I would choose if I knew it was this damn over spiced it's just one glass of nutmeg and cinnamon once again folks not a beer."
"Vigorous pour results in a small head of large, thin bubbles that vanishes almost instantaneously, no carbonation. Color is coppery with amber highlights. Visually indistinguishable from apple cider, except more translucent. Cinnamon aroma with nutmeg on the side is nearly overpowering and yet thin through the nose. Cinnamon chewing gum to a tee. No malt, hops, or otherwise-beer-aromas detectable. Flavor continues the trend: cinnamon gum and not much more. Possibly pumpkin pie spices, spiced apple rings, apple butter, sugary sweet. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, slightly juicy, but dissipates immediately. Average drinkability, but who'd want to face that flavor again?? Not impressed."
"Typical New Englad winter spiced beer. And not a very good one either. Pours clear dark coppery color with a head that dissapears quickly. The aroma is great, nutmeg and cinniman get me in the Christmas spirit. That's where it ends though and the beer begins it's descent down hill like a sled in the wet snow. Mouthfeel is not full bodied as promised, yet not too thin either. Finishes a bit dry. Flavor doesn't come close to the aroma and really dissapoints. Has a caramel malt flavor that is covered with cinnamon and doesn't blend well at all. Nice try but not a great tasting beer. Best bet for a christmas beer is Anchor OSA."
"Same as my bottle review, I cant say I dont like this beer, but I am a bit disappointed. I wouldnt turn one away, but I'm not sure if I'll be buying any more this season."
"I smile as I take my first swallow. Yes, I have found a winter ale that tastes how I expect a winter ale to taste. Finally. This is absolutely delicious. There's a tingle on the tip of my tongue amid the pleasant wash of spices, and that's as close as I can come to finding any complexity in it. Try as I might, I just can't get multiple taste stages out of this one. I don't care, though. Not one bit. It's cheery, beautifully balanced, and outlandishly drinkable. Gotta get me some more o' this."
" Well, there it is, liquid Big Red. Oooh, some complexity, maybe a fireball in there as well. This brew is overloaded with cinnamon. The flavor is pretty annoying, and it is a struggle to finish one. Skip this one for the winter."
"The taste is quite malty with the caramel malts doing the bulk of the work. A slightly spicy middle with a sweet finish makes for an interesting brew. Definitely a little different. Goes down easy."
"A truly drinkable holiday beer. Wow, i usually hate this kind, but this works. Just don't drink all night."
"Harpoon was a dark amber color, no head to speak of, and aroma of sweet spice. Spice dominated the flavor and aftertaste. Not much taste of malt or hops. I wasn't happy with this beer by itself but it might go well with a piece of pumpkin or apple pie."
"I will say that this beer has really gone down hill over the years. Its gotten a lot grainer and it seems like every year they use cheaper and cheaper ingredients in the way of spicing it. Not that its bad, just disappointing if youre used to last years effort. Also this is a beer that is MUCH better on tap than in bottle."
"Nice amber color, small white sticky head. Smell is of cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste is dominated by cinnamon and nutmeg. Touches of malt and hops, but spices are left to do their work. I actually like the spice characteristics of this beer, makes me think of the holidays and it warmed me up nicely."
"This stuff is weird. Poured amber with a small, white head. Nose is of floral hops, cinnamon and nutmeg (reminds me of ginger bread and pumpkin pie). This was intriguing. Unfortunately the taste was a bit of a let-down. The spiciness was a little too much, and a lot of the other characteristics were muted as a result. This beer could have been so much more. The beer did have a nice warming characteristic to it. Someone else said that this beer loses something after the first sip. I'd have to agree."
"I love the amber color of this beer. A head quickly formed as I poured and disappeared even faster when I put the glass down. So, I took a whiff, and wow, this is one wacky beer. It smells exactly like pumpkin pie. Kuh-razee. Anyway, I was enticed. If someone had told me about the smell beforehand, I probably would have postponed drinking this, but once I was up close and personal with the brew, I was digging the aroma. I was looking forward to the magical convergence this pumkin pie element would have with the actual beer part of the beer. However, the taste let me down. I wasn't expecting it to taste exactly like it smelled, but I was hoping for more than I got. The pumpkin pie taste wasn't as good as the smell and the beer flavor was muted. Ultimately, this beer needs to do some soul searching and find itself. I'll revisit when it's ready."
"Drinkability: This beer literally went flat during the time it took me to type this review (hunt and peck method I admit, but come on). I expect better from Harpoon."
"Overall, not bad to have one, but not more than that."
"Hmm....pumpkin ale??? Somewhat like a pumpkin pie (a hint of mint in the background?), but with a nice smell...pumpkin spice-like. Had to remind myself to review this for what it is...a seasonal, spiced brew. I enjoyed the taste, although one or two would be sufficient for the evening..heavy, chewy quality that was full-bodied, although a tad overly spiced. For a seasonal, sippable brew, it was quite nice...the kind you would sip rather than take a long draw from."
"a decent spiced ale. not great, though. could be more spiced and flavorful."
"While the aroma is mouthwatering, the flavor is a bit off. It has a strong holiday spice flavor but it seems just flat and unbalanced, I can't put my finger on it, but it's mostly in the finish. Very high in carbonation - pushed its spice aromas up into my nose. Mouthfeel was a little thin, but it helped keep this brew from being too much."
"hurt to give it a try."
"Pours an attractive, ruddy brownish-red color with a thick, bubbly head. To be honest, the head is short lived, but this is a very pretty pour. The aroma is all spice and sweetness. This is a medium bodied beer, and is a decent spiced ale, but there are certenly better beers in this style out there."
"This is the tale of two beers if I have ever seen. The pour was nice and cloudy orange with a thick, foamy, white head that receded into loose lace. Here is where the dualistic part comes. The smell was like a pie. Something close to pumpkin with lots of clove, nutmeg and cinnamon, which gave me no impression of what the actual beer tasted like or if there was even anything more than the spices. The taste was entirely different with only a small hint of the spices. There were some nice hop bitterness with a dry refreshing taste. This is not such a bad beer, but I think I will stick to Old Fezziwig when I am looking for winter spice beers."
"Thank you Davo for yet another Harpoon beverage."
"Unfortunately, this is not a very well balanced brew. There is very little hop flavor at all. This definitely needs to be improved to make this a standout winter brew. If this was anything other than beer, I would love it. It has strong flavors of cinnamon, ginger, apple pie, pumpkin pie...but no hop flavor at all. If they could just balance that out, this would be kick-ass. Still an enjoyable brew, and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Probably would make a nice crossover to get the macro drinkers to enjoy a winter brew."
"This is one kick arse beer. I gave it a shot on a whim. Boy, was that a great buy! I got a sixer of it for $6! At first I was expecting a robust beer, with a harsh aftertaste. I was once again proved wrong. It smells just like a gingerbread house. The taste is of strong baked ginger, like gingerbread, with the gingerbread aftertaste. I guess the main theme is gingerbread. The finish is very smooth and goes down super easy. Give it a try, it won't let you down."
"This pint was nice coppery color with beautiful, smooth, slightly off-white foam that was long lasting. The dominant aroma was cinnamon and spice. The taste was dominated by cinnamon and ""pumpkin pie"" type spices with a very good floral hop flavor blended in. The aftertaste was of cinnamon. The mouthfeel was good: dry, smooth with nice balance, but a little thin. The drinkability was good. A good Winter brew."
"holy spices, batman! was there beer in that bottle or did i just drink liquid spice? pours a hazy copper and, again, the spice content immediately overwhelms you. faint hints of cinnamon and nutmeg throughout. this is one of the few harpoon beers i find hard to enjoy, and thus have only found myself drinking about one per season in hopes that it might change."
"No head really present but did not lack in carbonation.The color presented a dark cherry red.The taste is simply outstanding and festive.Tastes of cinnamon,nutmeg,and ginger are abundant.A medium body with a spicy finish.The taste is of ginger bread cookies and pumpkin pie.What a great brew!"
"Pours a light amber color with a good head that leaves rather quickly, leaving a sexy lace in it's tracks. It has a strong pumpkin flavor with herbs and spices that really reach out and grap ya. Fruity notes come out at the end of the swig and last in an aftertaste which is rather pleasing."
"Clear red brown, bright. Ok head. Aroma is lemon pepper and mild pumpkin spices. Flavor is mild spices with sweet malt. It's far from over spiced, but lacks a bit of fullness in the flavor for a good winter."
"Pours an amber color with a solid head, which leaves decent lace down the glass. Nose is big on cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste is dominated by cinnamon, nutmeg, malt, etc. Probably similar to what liquid pumpkin pie might taste like. Very spicy overall. As the label states, it's ""beer with spices added," indeed. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and appropriate for a winter brew. Although I probably couldn't drink too many of these, this goes down fairly easy. A good seasonal brew, but there are better ones out there, for sure. I would prefer a bit more balance here between the spicy flavors."
"Light copper color, sticky pearl-white head. Cinnamon and nutmeg aromas drown out most everything else. Active carbonation. The spices are the dominant feature of the flavor, and thankfully this beer is not very sweet--there is a solid hop presence that keeps this from being a sickly-cloying brew. It's an okay beer; there are certainly scores of better winter brews out there."
"If you want a taste of Christmas, this is your beer. Good to have at the Christmas get together and most people haven't had it so it would be like your gift to them. The cinnamon scent and taste makes this truely a holiday beer. It is a true New England beer."
"Tasted: 03/29/04"
"This pours with an ample but short-lived off-white head, settling on top of reddish/amber liquid. Nose is cinnamon, some light nutmeg..and some maltiness. Taste is is spicy cinnamon notes, somewhat stronger than I remember in past editions & a good amount of hopping is noted as well. A little light-bodied, not your typical malt monster Xmas beer at all. Finishes with malt sweetness & spices. A nice Xmas ale on the lighter side of the scale."
"I poured it into the glasses, one for me and one for my wife. Nice dark amber color, good head. It smelled festive. The first sip expolded with spices. In fact, it kept exploding. It took me three beers to finally overcome the spices. My wife could not drink hers, muttering something about ""potpuorri"". This is a good Christmas eve beer, when you are trying to get into the spirit of the season. I could not drink this on a regular basis, much like Earl Grey tea."
"This years batch may be the best I've had, but I'll wait till I try some draught before making that proclamation. Pours a dark copper/ruby color with an unimpressive head that leaves no lace or film behind. Slight cinnamon with some fairly strong nutmeg as well in the nose without much else present. Nice smooth and sweet malty body carries this brew with some, subtler than in past years, spices playing second fiddle. The brew finishes with a nice spice flourish that features more cinnamon than nutmeg but both are there in nice quantities. Smooth maltiness makes for a nice medium-heavy bodied beer that is warming me up very nicely as a nightcap. I'll be sure to quaff some more of this as the season goes on, definitely a welcome sign that winter is upon us."
"Amber in color with a 1/2 inch off white head.  Smells very spicy like the holiday season.  The spices are a bit overpowering in the beginning but tale off at the end.  Cinnomon and brown sugar are things that I taste.  I can almost taste a slight bitterness towards the end but it fades quickly.  The aftertaste is a bit odd, the spices seem to be gone.  I don't think that I could have more than one or two of these."
"Nice looking light brown beer with a small white head that left a bit of lace. Aroma was of my grandmas kitchen before a holiday, all pie spicy with a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg, too much spice in my opinion. Smooth mouthfeel with a dry finish, but as far as flavor , the spices seem overdone once again. All in all the best way I can describe this beer is that it has an old spice cologne aroma with a captain morgans rum aftertaste/finish. If you are a fan of either of these concoctions, go ahead and try this beer, otherwise stay away."
"Ed's note: I found my notes from last winter's trip to Boston."
"This is the first spiced beer I tasted way back in the day.  Beautiful deep amber color and head.  Aroma of nutmeg and cinnamon with light hoppiness.  This is a unique taste among even other winter beers.  The spices really give this one its main character.  Not to heavy and goes down smooth.  Has an interesting aftertaste, though which sometimes detracts from the experience."
"Had this on tap while living in Vermont,liked it alot.Then bought in bottle form,not quite as good.On tap tasted fresh and like eating a nice spice cake."
"Notes: Very drinkable, sweetness is not cloying and spices are not over done. A well crafted and balanced beer. A good pick if you can't handle the ""big"" winter brews."
"This was a big disapointment since I so far have loved all the beers I've tried by Harpoon."
"I love cinnamon and nutmeg, so I almost prefered to smell this beer rather then drink it. But that would be silly. Probably one of the lightest holiday beers on the market. I think expectations for this beer may have lead to some dissapointment. Very sweet toward the end."
"Just imagine drinking a cinnamon hotball, but without the hot. It's so over-spiced that you can't enjoy the other characters of the beer."
"This beer almost goes over the top with spices - but holds back just enough.  Cinnamon and nutmeg blast out of the malt - like they stuffed a mincemeat pie into the bottle.  Must be brewed by little elves at the North Pole.  One bottle at a sitting is all I care for of this beer, but this is a great change of pace - Ho Ho Ho!"
"Wow, the brewers raided granny's cinnamon cupboard and went to town! The spice flavors are a bit overdone IMHO. They have sort of a superficial presence as if you were to sprinkle them on top of the beer, rather than mellowing throughout the brewing process. Thought this brew was a little thin for a winter seasonal."
"Cinnamon is the main thing going here but not overbearing.  Decent spiced beer in general but on the small side."
