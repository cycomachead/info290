"O: Dang, I had such high hopes for this one! It looked and smelled really good, but the taste and mouth feel were just not there. I wish I could taste even one more flavor. I generally like this style of beer and don't mind kick-in-the-back-of-the-throat bitterness when it is balanced out with something else. This one is a dud. Bummer."

"The draft I had was cloudy, taste was too mild with some spice notes but not much to it."

"O: I’m extremely open minded when it comes to all beer, 99.9% of what I try that I’m not a fan of I can at least find something positive to say about it, and I usually end on an “I won’t buy it again but I’d drink it if it was offered to me” type of note. NOT fireside chat, I will never drink this shat again. It’s just not good, I’m not trying to be a jerk it is just a sincerely bad product."

"O - This was neither refreshing, nor could it possibly perpetuate any fireside chat. Maybe I should smoke a cigarette like the guy on the can to add some flavor. Sorry for the diatribe, I often find myself liking most of the new beers I try. This one would be a drain pour if I wasn't committed to writing this review based on a fully drunken beer to give it the benefit of the doubt that it gets better as it warms. It doesn't."

"Overall: An OK winter warmer, but not my favorite."

"Dark brown body with a tan head.  Smells almost like a gingerbread nut brown.  Taste is nutmeg, cinnamon, gingerbread. With a light bitterness. Light bodied, kinda watery.  Overall, this is just okay."

"Great beer, well rounded, albeit a stronger end kick than i was expecting. Done just about right. Keep up the good work. *enjoyed by draft"
""
""
"Very complex malt flavors including coffee, slight smoke, nut, but not as bold as it looks.  Slight burnt nose and after taste, which isn't overpowering.  Overall a good Winter beer."
"Holiday ale featuring holiday spice, molasses, candied fruit and a touch of alcohol heat.  A nice brew for the holiday season."
"This is good. Nice holiday brew... not overly spiced, but smooth and balanced. Nothing over the top, but I'd definitely have another."

"I would also say that this brew is named accordingly. It's a great brew to pour for yourself and a friend and sit down next to the fire, catch up with one another and talk about the old times while sipping it slowly. If my buddy ever offers me another I most certainly will not reject it, but I don't think this one will ever make it's way into my fridge."
""
"Taste: I struggled to figure this one out, it has spices that tend to build up in the back of your throat. Extremely complex each sip brings different notes. Slight bitterness but not overpowering."
"I did not enjoy it at all"
""
"Pours a very dark ruby red! Not much going on the nose.. Taste is good.. Spices and more spices.. Almost reminds me of a pumpkin beer.. Over All a good beer."
""
""

"EBD 1/31/15.  Pours a clear dark amber with a beautiful deep dark ruby hue.  World class head volume, lacing and retention.  Light nose of dark fruit (figs) over light spice (cinnamon, ginger) with notes of burnt molasses.  As it warms, light alcohol notes are noted with a bourbon quality.  Almost light medium body with a bit of smooth texture.  Slightly below normal carbonation with little effervescence in the finish.   The flavor profile is somewhat intense, quite complex and very well balanced.  It begins with a wisp of fig that flows into a light sweet molasses with a burnt character.  In the middle, these yield to the spices that impart a mild spicy bitterness.  The finish is a slow fade of bitterness to caramel sweetness.  As the sweetness fades, a slightly astringent aftertaste lingers of ginger over light cinnamon.  The 6.9% alcohol is totally hidden."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep clear brown with light tan head that mostly burns off, with just a little holding on in the center of the glass. The aroma is lightly spiced and dark roasted malt. The taste is similar to the aroma but more robust with some distinct cardamom. It has a lighter body and just a hint of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was pretty good.  The 7.9% is very deceiving.  Sitting around my fireplace I indeed had more than my fair share chatting about the here and now.....and even the past.  Vault time."

"Pouring a deep chocolate brown, boarding on black, 21st Amendment Fireside Chat gives off an aroma of nutmeg, clove, and allspice.  The somewhat coffee-gingerbread like smell is slightly bitter, but malty, with hints of molasses.  As noses go, it isn’t that complex.  It starts off sweet, but moves toward the the bitter side of the spectrum.  Despite this, it’s balanced, and doesn’t overwhelm the palate with bitterness.  The mouthfeel is amazingly balanced, and doesn’t actually feel as heavy as it looks.  The flavors are of nutmeg, clove, smoke, espresso, and touch of fruitness. The malt is also strong, giving off flavors of burnt caramel, molasses, and burned sugars.  The finish channels a lot of the espresso and earthiness, and finishes somewhat like dark chocolate on the palate."
""
""
""
"Enjoyed from a growler in a snifter, this interesting winter ale pours a brownish red with a thin tan/off white head, and nice lacing.  Nose of chocolate, cinnamon, sweet malts of brown sugar, toast, and some allspice.  Flavors follow the nose with a brown sugar and cinnamon flavor hitting up front, and a light allspice flavor knocking on the back.  Malt gives this spiced ale some good balance, although at times the cinnamon is a bit heavy handed.  Nice mouth feel, very smooth yet coating with a light bitter aftertaste from spices.  A solid winter ale.  Improves greatly as it warms with other flavors coming through nicely...some orange and almost a gingerbread cookie like taste.  Very interesting, bold, and different."

""
""
"T: Cinnamon dusted truffle, but not nearly as decadent. There's a roasted chocolate finish, burnt marshmallow. So, this beer kinda tastes like a s'more, which means, I'd actually like this more in the summer."
""
""
"I got myself into trouble drinking pints of this at a pub, not knowing how strong it is on the alcohol, because it never shows it! A few of these and I was real loose, which is always fun. Dark brown it looks like a porter, but the roast on the grain is only medium, and there is very little bitterness. What bitterness is in here is balanced out by a brown sugary middle and a drying spicy finish that may include anise and clove. A darker take on the winter warmer, it's rich and satisfying in the feel, very full bodied and lightly carbonated. Surprised how drinkable it is, which is how I got wasted on it in the first place. I have liked all the beer I have had from these guys, cool they have wider distribution now. Not my favorite here, but is think it is underrated."
"Ultimately, it's not a bad beer, but it's not one I'm likely going to reach for again."

"O - This is an ok beer, but who is expecting, ""ok"" from a Winter Warmer?  The muddyness and out of context spice diminishes the drinkability.  If you order this beer, you will still enjoy your meal, but it would be nice if 21st Amendment cleans it up."
""
"It's just not really a ""beer"" anymore that Stroh's is. It's a product. Contact them! you can have your own brew made there! they do if for many!"
""
""
"You can really taste the chocolate and toffee taste.  It definitely has some spiced notes while drinking it.  Really enjoyed this brown ale and would have this again for sure"

"Kinda sweet and flat malt taste, tings the tongue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice. Malts provide just enough backbone, with a toasty, chocolate character that is nevertheless subdued. Hint of bubblegum and just maybe a hint of marshmallow. I bet this would be great fireside."

"O: Could use a little sweetness, as the spices take over even with the big maltiness. Alcohol starts to interfere as it warms up as well. A good sipper as long as it doesn't warm up too much, which kind of detracts from that point. Interesting to say the least"
""
""
"Overall, probably not one I'll try again. Just feels like it starts to go in so many directions, but doesn't follow through on any of them. Does it want to be a doppelbock? Eisbock? Porter? Belgian strong dark? Not terrible by any means, just seems a little disjointed."

"84/100."

"Certainly better than Harpoon's winter warmer, this one almost suffers from the opposite problem: not quite enough spices to it.  It's there, but could use a little bit more oomph.  Still, I prefer the more lightly spiced option."
"This is a tasty, substantial brown ale for winter. It tastes distinctly... warm... but if I didn't know there were spices I might not notice them. Certainly can't identify them. A little too easy-drinking for something that's almost 8% abv. Nice to find something new that isn't overwhelmingly hoppy against style."

"really dark, almost pitch black with frothy, light brn head. aromas are slightly boozy, fig, raisin, coacoa, vanilla, cinnamon.  taste of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, coacoa, vanilla, fig, all blended with a kiss of black cherry.  feel is solid, just enough carbonation and smoothness"
""
"Poured out of a 12oz can into a pint glass. Fireside chat pours a dark molasses brown with a prominent off white head about two fingers I length. It leaves a light lacing with a head that dissipates quickly. Smell is an upfront sticky sweetness with a hard spice undertone. Heavy clove and nutmeg with a molasses finish. Taste is of upfront spice and molds into a nice sweetness, in the middle I'm picking up aged fruit, dried figs or currants with a light alcohol astringent at the end (not at all bad for a 7.9% beer). Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy with a mild carbonation that I feel really suits the style. Overall this is the first beer in the ""winter warmer"" category I have ever tried and I will be returning! A very smooth spiced beer that won't overpower."

"O: [3.50] This is a new variety and taste to me.  It was not like any beer I have had.  It is not bad - but it is not something I would seek out again.  The nose was a tad weak and I couldn't pick out individual flavors.  As the beer warms I feel like it is tasting more like a Scotch Ale with spices."

"While the ale simmers in the glass like coffee- there's a lot of promise in its taste. Allowing the spices to join the process in more post-fermentation usage would have retained the delicate oils from the spices and without leaching its brash tannin."

"O: Im not super impressed buy it, but its fairly decent and above average for the price point, I'll probably get it again eventually."
"12 ounce can in to tulip glass, canned on 10/14/2013. Pours lightly cloudy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big brown sugar, molasses, raisin, prune, ginger, cinnamon, clove, dark bread, light roast, toast, and herbal earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity of malt, yeast, and spice notes; with good strength. Strength of spices is a bit too much in the nose. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, cinnamon, ginger, clove, brown bread, light coffee, toast, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, cinnamon, clove, ginger, brown bread, light coffee, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice winter warmer style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt and spice flavors; and very smooth sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"12 oz can from""Lifesource"" in Salem OR $2 ( i think). Pours a nice solid tawny brown with a large thick and frothy cream coloured head. Odd smells a bit like a spicy Christmas pudding..with rum cream on top..actually brings back memories and is very nice. Taste also is akin to British Christmas pudding..fruity,malty,dark,nutty absolutely a gem! Mouth feel is grand and easy at the same time. carbonated well. a lot of mediocre scores here..but this is just a great beer for me..invokes Christmases past."

"O - not a bad offering but I'd be lying if I said this is anything more than just okay."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting, enjoyable, but not particularly surprising or delicious."
"O: A very nice winter warmer style that is a nice accompaniment to a cold winter's night! Can easily enjoy a couple of these during the winter time on a snowy night, or day for that matter."

""

"Hop character should be weaker for the balance but good spice ale."

""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. It doesn't bog down, and leaves just a little residue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This is a really nice Winter Seasonal and probably my favorite from this otherwise underwhelming brewery. Well balanced with a great mouth feel and some nice spiced chocolate flavors. Worth revisiting."
"Hit or miss. Some years, I think it's good, others not so much. It's really just an average warmer, overall."
""
""
""
""

"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, opaque, sediment filled chestnut coloring with amber highlights and a dense, creamy, half inch of cream colored head that slowly settles into a filmy surface coat. Aromas of ginger, roast, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pine tassel, candied sugar, bread, and booze. Dynamic and layered nose. Flavors are heavy and roasted forward, with a blast of caramel, dark, blended with an array of holiday spices, such as the cinnamon and nutmeg. The initial burst of flavor lightens rapidly, and there is a solid spice component that remains, slightly overpowering. A light, somewhat watered down body in mouth, with a solid spice linger into the aftertaste, giving a feel of warm cinnamon and cider. That shifts to a tangy sweetness that is cloying through to the finish, with a slightly astringent feel, as well. This one has it's ups and downs; tasty, but could be tightened up in a couple of spots."
"Final Thoughts: Definitely not the beer I was expecting. There's a lot of flavor there but its very spastic and unrefined. I like my winter warmers to be smooth and rich. Fireside Chat did not deliver. Would I drink it again? No."
""
"Overall a minor player in such a broad category."

"T: Starts very nut brown ale-ish, with sweeter, nutty roasted malt tones upfront. Then some baking spices flare up and you're left with an aftertaste that is kind of like that bitter flavor you get when you try the cinnamon challenge. If you're into that kind of thing."

"pretty color. Other than that, nothing nice about it, for me.... maybe a bad batch? still, at $11 a six pack, I'm not giving it another shot..."
""
""
""
"M: Creamy medium bodied and fairly drinkable considering the ABV. Pretty nice for the winter."
"O: A little bit too bitter for my tastes. Also, depending on the person, the spice might be overbearing. Not really something I see myself going back to buy again. And for the record, I would much rather drink Chinotto over this."
"Overall: A solid winter beer."

"Christmas pudding of a beer: plums, damsons and rich spices filled the nose and mouth: I really enjoyed it. Full of flavour, warming and wintery in nature: a smoking jacket sort of beer. Impressed."

"One of my favorite spiced winter beers and it comes from a place that doesn't even have a winter (San Francisco). It is a dark English-style ale spiced with cinnamon and other spices common in winter ales. I find it to be a great mix between a malty English Ale and a spiced American-style winter Ale. A great beer."
""
""
"D - Not bad, the spice aroma is still pungent even though this can has some age on it and it is a bit unique compared to many other spiced beers Ive tried. A fairly well handled example of a spiced beer."
"Single finger head with poor retention but nice lace on a near clear deep amber red body. Aroma is very sweet and well represented with nutmeg, cherry, mint and cinnamon, all spice really. Flavors of the winter season with more nutmeg, gingerbread, nutmeg and hint of peppermint. Some caramel malt base as well. A lot thicker than expected, moderate carbonation and fairly oily coating the palate. Very interesting with this one managing to have many of the same flavors as others in the class but the overall flavors and body make it different and therefore memorable."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the true winteriness and warmth of the spice and depth of malts. While we do wish things had fleshed out a bit more fully through the flavoring, each component was nicely contributory to the final sip, adding nice depth and excitement throughout. The nose gave big fruity sweetness, and smelled a bit more like a bock, at times, than a warmer. Mouthfeel also ultimately added to the experience, helping to keep you happy with almost every sip."
"Overall, I like this. It might come off to some as being a bit heavy handed with the ginger and spices to some, but it works pretty well for me."
""
""
"All in all enjoyable. However I feel it is slightly too bitter for the style. Still I will continue to purchase and enjoy this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wasn't exactly thrilled going into this, but over time I did enjoy it as it went down. It brought some surprises to the plate, but there are in need of some improvements. Some of the spices added in were generic and not very different from the norm. Not to say this wasn't a good beer, as it was good for sipping, but nothing entirely too special. I would maybe try again if it were offered, but I guess I would recommend to a friend. Cheers!"
"Overall – Not really one I would recommend. The flavors are a little too spicy and astringent with a feel that does not complement well the winter warmer category (although I guess the boozy taste does)."

"O: solid beer but the finish on the swallow really ruins it. glad I only got the one. overall it's not bad and if the aftertaste was cleaner and the flavors played better it would get higher marks. up until that point it was a solid B."
""
""
""
""
"It pours a opaque black with no particles evident in the beer. It smells sweet like vanilla and maybe ginger or some other spice. I feel that it is nicely balanced and welcomed. I love the spices of this beer. It has a warming very pleasant taste of vanilla and then fades to the other spices as well as to the malts of this beer which are rich. I taste lots of sweet tastes which escape me but I definitely get vanilla. I like this beer and would order it again especially if on tap."
"Overall a nice winter warmer. A little long on the sweet flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a nice winter warmer. I don't know that I could drink more than a can at a time, but it's certainly festive, and a beer I might turn to for a one-off night cap on a day like Christmas Eve."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a good brew by 21st Amendment. I'm not a huge fan of Christmas ales but would drink this again, just wouldn't seek it out. The spice disguises any alcohol that would be detected. Give it a shot, good, not bad, not great."
""
"O-Not a bad beer, has decent flavor profile and appearance. Not a staple for my holiday season but might grab it once in awhile"

"Overall - I feel like 21st Amendment tried to find the most spices they could possibly put in a beer and do that. It wasn't bad, but it was way overpowering."
"This was an interesting beer, I enjoyed the aroma and taste, but overall the holiday-spice notes became a bit much towards the middle of the glass."

"O: if you like very spicy winter Warner's you'd probably really enjoy this. Not particuarly my style, too much spice for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-it's more or less just a mess. there are a lot of flavors going on here, but they just don't mix together well. I think some of the spices need to be taken out. It definitely does have some sort of potential, but it needs work. not exactly easy to drink. it has a certain plastic-like bitterness that makes this not exactly fun to finish. I don't recommend, there's something better out there for you to choose."
""
""
""
""
"O: not a bad winter style ale, spice flavoring is on the heavy side, could use more malt for balance"
""
"I honestly don't see what this was supposed to taste like with a final product this messy. Maybe it was supposed to be consumed fresher, but it seems I'm not the only one recently who's only been able to find a batch this old. I like peppermint and dark fruit flavor they aimed for here, but the metallic blackcurrant aftertaste really is too much for me, especially because I suspect it wasn't supposed to end up like this. Drain pour."
""
""
""
"I like this as a winter beer, but would have it only on occasion; it's quite intense-flavored"
""
"This is my opinionm but I enjoyed the beer and will have it again,"
"OVERALL: This is not my favorite style by any means, but occasionally, I'll enjoy a winter warmer. This is, by far, the best example I have tried. Somewhere between malty and hoppy this beer truly warms with a comforting array of Christmas-like spices."
"I'm not a huge fan of spiced beers, but this one does it pretty well."
""
""
"O- I'm disappointed in tasting the aluminum can with this beer. Maybe I should blame myself for not looking for a date, or maybe Fireside Chat should just be bottled. Nonetheless, I believe the beer isn't much anyway. Nothing really struck me as special in the end. Its bark, (presentation, appearance, smell) was definitely more appealing than its bite. Maybe I need to try this on draft, but I don't think I'll be going out of my way for it."
""
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This is just an okay beer. The flavors are all over the palate. I was hoping for a more solid malt foundation and more uniformed in flavor. Good beer, glad I got to try it."
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes."

"O - Very good beer.Will have again. Surprised that it didn't get better reviews. I enjoyed it."

"The color when poured was dark brown with a little amount of tan foam and a load of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of spices and fruit, along with yeasty roasted malts filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste had a sweet/bitter alcoholic spicy flavor with a hint of roasted yeasty bread/fruit flavor. A little bitter finish, but, a loads of spicy/fruity flavor on the palate. This is another winner for 21st Amendment. Nicely balanced flavor."

"Dark reddish brown in body with thin coffee with cream head. Pretty stanky: vanilla extract, gingerbread, herbs, light cocoa, cinnamon. Tastes of herbal notes, medicinal flavors, cinnamon, light cocoa, bready, some vanilla extract, and mild grass. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Pretty bubbly for a winter warmer. Good for 2 at most."
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not all that familiar with winter warmers or english-style ales, but based on the descriptions I've read this one is pretty much to style. I do wish that there had been a more pronounced spice profile to this one, but all things considered it's not a bad brew at all. At 7.9 abv, a few pints will definetly fulfill the ""warming"" side of the equation!"
""
""
""
"Rich creamy body with a fluffy mouthfeel. Flavors are a lot like that of the nose but while the banana nut bread flavors come through stronger on the nose, the cinnamon raisin bread like flavors come through stronger on the tongue. Dry and spicy on the back end of the tongue with a mild alcohol warming finish. In my opinion an awesome brew for cold winter morning with breakfast or cold winter nights sitting by the fire enjoying some sweets and of course good conversation. A really good brew. And oddly, I think it drinks better out of the can than in a glass."

""
"O - I nursed this brew for about an hour while chatting with friends. There's enough flavor to keep it interesting and was a nice change from my typical IPAs or stouts."
""
"Mouthfeel is heavy and chewy, with a medium to heavy body, a slick feel and mild carbonation. This slides down easy and hides the ABV well in the flavor, but it was just too scattered like the whole spice cabinet had a dash added. Had this on tap and now out of the can and wasn’t really a fan on either occasion."
""
""
""
"This is a drinkable beer and ultimately enjoyable, but lackluster all the same. The flavor is mild and simplistic with little to separate it from the rest of the winter warmer field. I probably won't go for this again."
""
""
"I found this beer easy to drink. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm glad I ran across this can."
""
""
"Overall: Another impressive 21st Amendment Brew. This one was made under contract locally at the Cold Springs brewery in Minnesota. I am really liking these canned beer offerings from 21st Amendment."
""
""
""
"D: Flavorful but not very tasty since the flavors don’t seem to mesh well, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, not the best representation of style, this is definitely not a beer I would want to drink again."

"O: A good winter warmer. Not a big fan of the style, but would buy this again."
""

""
""
"O - Overall, a nice, inexpensive example of the winter warmer style. A good choice for those looking for a winter on the maltier side, or those who like quite a bit of spices."
""
""
""
"Overall, this seems above average for the style. Spiced winter ales are rarely all that interesting, with a few notable exceptions. This one is pretty well done, and I'd buy it again if the mood struck me."
""

""
"Sidebar- LOVE the packaging ""Like FDR's radio addresses, this beer is like a kick in the butt and a hug at the same time."""
""
""
"Overall: Charming, festive, and warming."
""
"Dark brown with red highlights and minimal head/lacing, this smells like spice--nutmeg and cinnamon--and some sweet dried fruits, like figs and plums. The taste has both of those components, some toasted malt, and citric hops. A bit too heavy on the spices. It's a pretty solid beer with a pleasantly light and clean body--I really like the dry ending, since I find some Winter Warmers very sticky and unintegrated. It's a pretty good beer, and my mother loved it, so I'll probably buy it again."
"O: Decent for the winter time, but I'd like to see this toned down on the spices. Not very drinkable after the first one."
""
"The drinkability is moderate at best on this, as the alcohol snuck up on me. It's a good beer."
"Brown that is malty and spices are mostly nutmeg and cinnamon. Pleasant and drinkable. Medium mouthfeel, above average carbonation. brown with a minimal head.Malty aroma, surprisingly little spices in nose.Caramel, nutty. A spiced up brown, would like more hops. OK, nothing special."
""
""
"Medium bodied with good carbonation. Easy to drink"
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation. The aftertaste has a confused mixture of spices and dark roasted malt which do not work together. Whoever thought beer this was a good idea was sadly mistaken. Thankfully I picked this can up as a single, so I never have to try it again."
""

"Pours a dark burgundy brown color, minimal head and lacing. Scent is mild and contains roasted nuts, toasted grain, hint of char, minimal traces of caramel and seasonal spice, splash of cranberry juice. Taste is quite light and muddled, malts are roasty and toasty, but light, seasonal spices are a focal point, but light, splash of tart cranberry juice. Medium bodied and bubbly. Overall, not much going on and that makes it unmemorable."
"I dug their Monk's Blood a bit more, it being spiced, as well, but I'm happy to see more spiced beers around."
""
"O: This beer has a great look and a nice aroma, but the taste does not deliver everything one expects. The alcohol and bitterness, though meant to balance, actually takes away from the beer as a whole. I also think the beer could be a bit heavier. There is nice roasted malt and burnt edges, but the holiday spices get a little lost in the background."
""
""
"Overall a definite winter beer. The high alcohol content is hidden very well. Spicy but nothing overpowering."
"Overall a tasty (in my opinion) winter warmer, but could use more aggressive spice to counter the hops. Drink on a cold day with some Lebkuchen."
""
"I'm proud to make this beer my 50th review!"
""
""
""
""
""
"But the mouth feel, and metallic taste detract from what is going on."
"O: Not a bad brew, but not something I'd rush back to try. It made me miss better winter warmers (eg. Old Fezziwig)."
"its well worth a try."

"O: I could drink this on a cold day. It didn't happen to be cold on this day even though it is December 6th in central PA. Solid beer."

"Overall, a unique and fulfilling winter warmer."
""
""
""
"QUITE NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
""
""
"Medium bodied with a harsh, overly aggressive spice presence that lingers over the sweeter notes into a acrid, bone dry finish. Lots of potpourri spice with bark, cinnamon, pepper, ginger and clove which creates an unpleasant dry flavor that dominates. Underneath there us some sweet malt and dark fruit along with a syrupy, medicinal character. This beer is overly spice but also cloyingly sweet. Just all over the place and a bit if a mess."
"O: Based on other reviews there may be some bottle variation going on here, and unfortunately mine was not one of the better ones. This beer has a lot of potential, but doesn't pull it together."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A go to winter ale that will be bought again. Definitely one to share with the bro's for cold winter nights."
""
"O - Very nice spiced beer, thoroughly enjoyed it."
""
"A solid winter warmer."
"Overall: I liked this beer quite a bit. I am surprized it is rated so low. It is well balanced, with a nice flavor."
""
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a one finger slightly off white head which gives way to strings of lace. The aroma is of cinnomon, nutmeg, caramel, and toffee. The taste starts of with a caramel and toffee backbone. That is replaced by a cinnomon and nutmeg taste with a hint of vanilla. The spice part in the middle was very enjoyable. The backend had an earthy hop bite to it. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated and a touch creamy. Overall it was a solid winter warmer there was a nice balance to it and it was very drinkable."
"This is not a bad Winter Warmer. Very easy to drink for a 7.9 abv. Why such the average reviews? I don't know. The taste is there and although I'm a huge hophead, this is quite malty but the slight bitterness at the end works quite well."
""
""
""
""
"Smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation and a short finish. This is a disappointing offering from 21st century, who have impressed me in the past with their other cans. Not awful but pretty one dimensional. Stay away if you don’t like the spices because they’re here in spades."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall - This beer sucked until it warmed up and other flavors other then just the spices came out. Its a holiday beer, only to be drank for the holidays. I wouldnt want this year round but as a session, i enjoyed this."
""
""
"O: Not bad. Heavier on the sweetness than it strictly needs to be though. Ever go to somebody's house and they feed you something they baked themselves, only its not as good as they think it is? but you have to be polite and not say so? That's the vibe I get from this beer"
""

"Overall: not bad, not great."

"Overall, fun to drink. Enjoyable sipper. Definitely makes me think of holidays."
"I actually had this beer in the can, and then later poured into a glass. And seriously, put it in a glass. It makes a huge difference. You may want to drink out of the can simply because of FDR on the front, but resist the temptation. It's a nice winter beer, malty and full of flavor upfront, and a huge spice punch all of a sudden in the middle. Strangely though the flavor really disappears at the end. Just very little after taste. Still, it's a good beer, and something likely only around in the winter."
"O- A beer that feels like it never reaches its full potential. Nothing really jumps out at me and makes me want to reach for another can. The somewhat boring flavors and alcohol content makes this a one and done. I probably won't be revisiting this beer anytime soon."
"Overall- pretty awesome brew. I'm surprise there hasn't been more excitement about this seasonal. Imagine Anchor steam Christmas ale on steroids and there you have fireside chat. Damn good stuff."
"O: I hate to say it but avoid this beer at all costs. I've enjoyed offerings from 21st Amendment but I cannot fathom who passed putting this one out. Well, now I need to find something to do with the other 5 of the pack..."
"Mouthfeel is slightly lighter than medium and has average carbonation. Overall, just weird. Doesn't taste like anything that you could normally find in a winter warmer and honestly isn't that appealing. The appearance is the best characteristic by far. Not worth seeking out."
"Hey, if you are going for that spiced holiday ale you may as well go big or not go at all. 21st went big flailing away at the tastes buds, perhaps not liquid gold but it sure was fun to drink. Fun enough to have more than one as well."
"O: This is a good beer to sip and savor the spices in the smell and taste; however, it could use more body and warmth from the alcohol to make it a true winter warmer."
"Overall good, but kind of odd. Really comes off as a winter spiced amber with a heavy dose of hops. It's a good but simple beer."
"It does cover the booze. I will now guzzle, not savor, the rest."
"Pours pretty dark brown with a good bit of cream to tan colored head. Good lacing as well. Definite spicy smell - allspice and clove and cinnamon notes with a good backing of caramel and lightly roasted malt. The flavor falls a bit flat though I think. The spice is there but it is kind of muddled in with heavy malts. Lots of roasted malt with a bitterness that overpowers or at least warps the spice notes. The mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied, leaving a kind of sticky aftertaste. I wanted to like this beer more but it didn't help me out too much."
"Overall: this is a good beer if you are in the mood for a winter warmer."
"A very independent brew!"
"This brew poured out as a nice looking deep red color with a tan colored head on top. Not much retention or lacing here. The smell of the beer gives of a slightly sweet profile with a touch of spice on the nose. The taste gets better as it warms up, the spices start to come through a little more making this a pretty decent beer. The mouthfeel was a little heavier than I thought it'd be but not bad. Overall I thought this was a pretty decent brew."
"Pleasant beer, nothing amazing about it, but I feel they're not aiming for amazing, and they have managed to hit pleasant 'n' drinkable."
"No, this didn't really work for me. It's really flat and lifeless on the palate, and although there were some pleasant things on the nose, these were ephemeral and didn't really eventuate. I've had better from 21st Amendment."
"O - I wanted to like this since I'm actually a big fan of ""Winter"" spices, but in the end it was a bit heavy-handed. Reign in the spices and we'd have a real winner!"
"On tap at 21st Amendment. Pours a mostly clear caramel-brown color with a well-formed thick tan head. The aroma is rather spicy and typical of a winter warmer with sweet toffee notes. The flavor is a little spice heavy but not terribly so. Nutmeg and allspice are most prominent. This is backed up by a sweet English toffee malt character. Smooth on the mouthfeel with medium-full body and only slight syrupiness, not too much given the ABV. Slight alcohol warmth. I find this one a bit underrated overall. It’s pretty solid for a winter warmer actually."
"From notes 12/11/10. Can. Not my favorite spiced holiday ale but it drinks pretty easily and has some interesting flavor. It tastes a bit like spiced cider with oranges. There’s a lot of English character in the caramel/toffee malt flavor. Not much in the way of hops, though some of the spice could be masking it for me. The flavor is a bit odd, but it works, at times. A fair bit of cola flavor hurts things. Mouthfeel is a bit effervescent and thin for the abv but not bad. Pours medium brown with a thin, fading head."
"not very happy with this one. 21st amendment is one of my favorite breweries, but there was just way too much spice in this one. almost as bad as harpoon's winter warmer. avoid."
"I find this to be a pleasant, fairly flavorful beer. I could see it drinking pretty well in the middle of winter. But the malts and the spices seem like they're battling with each other, and they both come off the worse for wear. Its main downside is that the parts don't come together into a cohesive whole."
"I have to agree here with the overall rating at least - not a tasty, satisfying, or well-realized attempt at the style (or any style?)."
"Fuller medium body, higher carbonation, dry and chewy. Time and time again, I really want to like 21st amendment, but this is plain awful. I wont buy this one again."
"Soured light bodied brew of distasteful delight."
"Dark burgundy pour, smallish head and lacing. Smell is christmas spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel and fruit cake. Taste is similar, figs and plums with a strong malt backbone. Mouthfeel is creamy with a medium body. Interesting to try, but a bit below-average and nothing special."
"all in all, this is an interesting one. I like spices in my winter warmers, but theres something about this one that just isn't quite right. heavy spices, funky, almost artificial taste. kinda odd."
"Pours a dark brownish red with a 2 inch khaki head that fades to a small cap. Foamy clumps of lacing on the glass on the drink down. There is some sediment/floating debris in the glass. Smells of dark fruits, cranberry, winter spices (cinnamon/clove), and fruitcake. This actually smells very good to me. Taste is of fruitcake with candied fruit/rinds, cranberry sauce, and the spices I mentioned in the smell. The taste is not as good as the smell. There is almost a medicinal aspect to the taste. Beer has low carbonation and it's somewhat hard to drink down due to the medicine tastes I am getting. Overall, I had this beer back in December and it was a lot better then. I think it's safe to say this one has degraded over time and is meant to be consumed ASAP."
"o - Overall I wasn't very impressed this beer from 21st Amendment. The tart fruits mixing with the roasted malts just didn't work with me. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"Wow, I just don't know what to think of this. It's like the makings of a decent Winter Warmer are there but the flavors are just so jumbled and confused at times, that it was impossible for me to get invested, in any way, into my glass of this. That tart fruit and spice combo were just too much. I dug the experiment that is Monk's Blood but this one really missed the mark for me."
"21st Amendment Brewery--Fireside Chat Winter Spiced Ale--Ale With Spices Added--2010 12 oz. MicroCan. 7.90% ABV. 45 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Foamy mild lace off white tan head. Cloudy bright dark ruby red color. Floral hop lightly toasted nutmeg clove spice front. Mild textured crisp dry sweet fully fermented spiced mildy fruity rich tasty dark malt mild cocao body. Tangy hop spice mild EtOH end. A nice surprise sampled 3/18/2011. 6-Pack purchased for $8.79	 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 10/22/2010."
"Decent beer for what it is. Might be better if warmed up a bit, like a mulled wine. This isn't really bad, just not welcoming and inviting. I may try it again warm, but not chilled. Glad to have had the chance to try it."
"Beautiful dark mahogany color with a light tan head gets me excited to try this beer. The smell is fairly subdued with mostly cinnamon with some background malt. The taste is dominated by a metallic flavor that lingers with lactic sourness. Not good at all. I'm assuming that this is infected, so I would try another one next year. However, right now, I certainly don't want another."
"This isn't enjoyable at all. Though the tartness subsides, the medicinal bitterness picks up the slack. Though it could be worse, I drain-poured half of it regardless. The feel really kills this one."
"D- Definitely a decent winter warmer. A bit one dimensional and the alcohol in the finish makes it seem bigger than it is."
"D: After encouraging the eyes and nose to drink and enjoy, this beer shocks the palate into an invalidated state which renders the enjoyment of even humble food less possible. While many of the flavor components are disagreeable even when taken alone, the combination of them clashes irrevocably. In short, it becomes hard to drink after a few sips."
"Decent sipper if you like the style."
"Overall it is ok but I do not know if a winter warmer should be sour."
"D: Not strictly seasonal as many spiced holiday beers are. If I had not read the label, I would think this ""just"" a robust and complex brown - heavy on the dark fruit aspects. Actually a pretty strong, almost odd, twangy tart cherry thing going on. Tart edge is enough to make just wonder if it is really intentional or a fault. Still, it is good & interesting and okay enough. Sort of reminds me of NB's Frambozen. Seems more of a fall beer than a winter one."
"Monk's Blood BSDA was a spices-added brew that hit me right. Fireside Chat misses by a country mile. If 21st Amendment plans to release this offering next winter, they need to give it a major overhaul. Love the label... when you see who FDR is chatting with."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark brown, was close to being opaque. One finger light brown head that clung to the sides extremely well. Aroma had a bit of spiciness to it, but also seemed to have hints of pickles, oranges, and cloves. Taste was watery sour with slight spicy undertones. Felt a bit thin and watery in the mouth. Not terribly pleasing to drink due to the wateriness and the iffy flavor."
"Notes: For a winter warmer this one is not quite there I was hoping for a little more spice but it simply was not there. Cheers."
" The flavor is roasted but in a mild way with more yeast tanginess and the metallic flavor comes out with the spice. the taste is very caramel and seems sweet up front but relaxes toward the middle, more spice might have been better, however the malt lacks a little in the flavor dept. I found the off flavors easy to take at first, but becomes more noticeable as it warms. The winter warmer is ok but not something I would revisit any time soon."
"Purchased a can at Russell House Tavern in Harvard Square on Sunday for $5. Poured into a water goblet. Nice dark brown body, with a fuzzy white head. Some lacing at the top of the glass. Smell had a great cinnamon and nutmeg aroma. Flavor was also very nice for a winter warmer. Lots of spice, some ripe fruits like fig, and a hint of smoke. The beer looks thicker than it actually was in reality. The body was on the thin side, but I don't mind too much for a canned beer. For a 7.9% beer, I thought it was quite smooth. I liked everything here, and I'd get this beer again if only due to it's relatively cheap price."
"Overall, I suspect an infected can though it was a pretty decent sour."
"The mouthfeel is thin, dry, and astringent, although the carbonation isn't overdone. However, I can't drink this. At all. I therefore sacrifice this beer to my sink."
"D- Not a bad sipper beer at all; the flavor can be a bit overwhelming if you drink too much of it in a short time."
"This was a drainpour."
"D: I don't think I could have more than 2 of these. a lot of flavor but a little goes a long way"
"So many makings for a good beer, but I'm just not that fond of the spicing. Too heavy handed and not very blending."
"P.S. The art is awesome. FDR was the shit."
"Update: The more I have, the less I like it. I did not finish the six pack. The sour taste just gets more sour until you're making that ""uggh, yuck"" face and lose all your desire to finish your drink."
"Pass on this one."
"The palate manages to take all the things that are good about the nose and mangle them into something atrocious. Bitter mace and nutmeg, bitter grainy astringency, a little vanilla and brown sugar, this is rather unpleasant. Bitter almond skins are also present. Paradoxically, this sweetens up on the finish, leaving brown sugar, vanilla and cola to go with the bitterness. Medium in body with high carbonation, this is decent on the palate apart from the finish. Unpleasant, I'm pouring the rest of this out."
"Verdict: Not something I'll buy again or suggest to anyone"
"D- Can't make it through 6 sips."
"Poured from can as well as on tap into a english style glass. A clear mahogany pour with a thick and fluffy khaki head. A wonderfully wintry & roasty aroma that features some caramel, toffee, red apples, pears, plums, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of anise. More thin than medium-bodied. Lots of maltiness upfront taste-wise. Some caramel and a roasty nuttiness at the forefront. A biscuity transition. Finishes kinda sour and dry with some surprising grassy notes. Plenty of spiciness throughout. Some alcohol warmth is present. A drinkable and pleasant enough winter warmer."
"D - Drinkability is low. This beer had promise and the initial flavor was fresh and unique, but it just kind of falls apart. I was looking at my glass wishing it would be gone sooner, but I had to wait a bit."
"Beer is medium to light in body with some cookie sweetness up front and some biscuit breadiness in the midpalate leading to a low bitterness and a clean finish. I'm not sure why this is rated so low, as far as a winter warmer is concerned the spices were not overwhelming but they were present, the mouthfeel and drinkability were fine, I'd have it again but I wouldn't buy it again."
"This is a great ale to enjoy during a cold, winter day or night."
"4/4"
"Interesting beer. Dark brown with a nice tan head.. good lacing and head retention, especially considering ABV. STRONG spice taste... can't quite figure out which spices it utilizes, but they're absolutely overpowering. This beer was ok to try... but I'm not tempted to have another."
"Due to the sweetness and poor balance of this beer, one is enough for me. I love a good malty winter warmer, but this one goes overboard on the spices."
"GRADE: D+/C-"
"Drinkability: A nice blend of malt backbone and spices. Might revisit this one."
"Wouldn't go out of my way to buy this again."
"For me, Fireside Chat is more of a nice change of pace than something I'd drink every day. It's the only canned beer that I currently look forward to drinking."
"Decent beer though. Glad I tried it."
"Avoid."
"Weak offering. Drank the first one out of the can, the first sip was shockingly bad. The spices (aroma & taste) overwhelm all the taste of the beer. 2nd can into a pint glass, mellowed the spice, but still terrible. Great color, good head, but could not get 2 beers down. Save your $10."
"D: first can i had i thought was good, this can not as, must be a different batch as it was a few months apart."
"D - I was glad to finally try a can from 21st and this was a pretty nice one. Loved the artwork and it was pretty tasty, too."
"*EDIT* as the beer warms the sourness really dominates the flavor making it hard to finish. Changed score to reflect that."
"Fireside Chat had everything I want in a holiday beer--a more pronounced malt profile, ""warming"" from a higher alcohol content, and something unusual thrown in the mix."
"No matter what I could not get agood taste out of this. The only thing that helped a little was allowing it to warm further. Still, flavors were muddy when not overshadowed by an overwhelming astringency."
"Fairly drinkable, though perhaps the spices might get a little cloying were I to have more. It's a bit strong for session drinking as well. Still, you could do worse."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly warming, with moderate carbonation in the finish."
"Mouthfeel is about average, at least not watery. Drinkability is ok as a slow sipper on a cold night. Pleasant but one would probably do it."
"D: Looks great, smells pretty good and un-drinkable!!! Just cannot get anything other than the look and smell out of this one. Sorry 21st Amendment, another bad one."
"Mouthfeel is rather still, a little dry, not thick or sticky. Too much sweetness to be very drinkable, to me."
"I first had this beer at my local bar, South, in Park Slope Brooklyn. I've read a lot of reviews about the beer in the can version, and I think that the draft may be a bit different. I'm not usually one to have this particular style of beer, but after taking a sample of it and drinking a full pint, I kind of liked it. The first smell was deceiving, it smelled like a barbecue. But the taste was nice. It was medium bodied, slightly carbonated, and had a mild casky smoked taste. It followed with notes of chocolate and a subtle maltyness that I felt hid the alcohol content quite well. Good end to my night after drinking triples."
"I like the can, especially with the FDR art. The beer itself leaves something to be desired. It's a rich red color with a fairly small, fizzy tan head. The aroma is a mix of spice, malt, and sourness (that I'm not certain isn't originating from a spice). The taste is moderately malty, with a notable twang. Malt flavor, but it's a little hollow...Spice notes, but not very balanced. No hop presence. Medium body, with a little alcohol coming out in the hind-taste. All in all, this isn't as drinkable as I had hoped."
"Drink is meh, slightly syrupy and semi sweet, even finishes sweet, it starts to get a bit of minerality on teh finish as well, light spices, and light sour fruits, and bit of booze give it a tougher drink."
"Drinkability: so-so at best. This is a bit unbalanced and slow sipping. Interesting to try, but not one I would select for winter party."
"I kind of expected that this would be off & was also kind of looking forward to it. The sour/funky aspect combined with the spicy winter ale notes were an interesting novelty at first, but soon gets to be too much. I'd be interested to see what this is supposed to taste like."
"Pours a dark brown with a full tan head. Head retention is good leaving some nice lacing behind. Has kind of an odd aroma for this style of beer. Gives a lemon and grass aroma with some undiscernable spices. A strange metallic flavor comes through, some undiscernable spices, and an off bitter flavor."
"D - This is a good winter warmer, but there are better winter warmers out there that are readily available for a reasonable price."
"D: I love winter warmers. I love malty beers. I love hearty beers. I even love spiced beers. Really thought I'd love this one. Didn't. Something about the metallic twang, the tartness and an unappealing roast made this a mixed bag - one that I probably don't need to get again (although reading reviews about the draft version do sound better). *Might* have it again if I see it on a taplist... but this was a bad introduction."
"Not a bad beer, just not a good beer. Bitter aftertaste after a smooth initial start. The metal can is pretty good and easier to use then the traditional bottle. Have to admit that I am not a big fan of spiced beers to that makes my look lower overall."
"Fireside Chat pours a dark brown with an off white head. In the nose, spices (nutmeg) and a sweet toffee maltyness. Malty, quite spicy with some vegetal/pumpkin notes. Also a weird sourness that detracts from the flavor. Is this infected? If I was told this was a poorly made pumpkin ale, I'd believe it. Falls pretty much flat on the palate, low carbonation on a medium to heavy body. The flavors just clash to me I found this one to be kind of a mess. Nice try, but missed the mark for me. Couldn't finish a pint, and I was thirsty. Fail."
"D= Nice way to start the evening..more than one would be overkill"
"But overall it's a halfway decent winter warmer. Worth a try. The ABV is well-hidden unlike some others in the same class."
"Drinkability: An average winter warmer. I could have a couple. The spices are there but are somewhat muted. I have had better from this brewery."
"So far I have had 2 21st Amendment beers and both have been pretty lackluster."
"Drinkability depends on the drinker, figure that. I happen to like a good spiced dark beer, especially when the season calls for it. Being in Northern California we get fog for most of the year, so a beer like this to warm up a late night is always welcome."
"As it warms, the Magnum and Golding hop aromatics wake up and start to balance out the cereal bill. For such a weighty grain profile, I would have expected more of a bready mouthfeel, but the Chat is thin enough to be followed by another without feeling stuffed like the proverbial Christmas goose. Feliz Navidad."
"Straight outta the can, so appearance here is completely the artwork. It smells like Christmas and the taste carries through as well. A lot of spice, but not all upfront and even kind of cinnamonny at the end. At 7.8% you might be expecting a very hoppy beer, but the spices do a lot to balance out the hoppy-ness, which scores points with me. I tend to prefer maltier brews. Carbonation was perfect in my can. You don't even realize it's 8% until you stand up to get the second one and fall back down. Didn't see any elves, though, like the one FDR is chatting up on the artwork. Very enjoyable brew. Even at $10 a 6er, I'll be going back for some more."
"D: This beer is a little bit of a mess. I actually drainpoured it. In case the 21A cares the code on the can is 0279 2144. Not a good beer."
"Taste is meh, not too much going on here, it's really disappointing and bland. This is 0/4 for 21st amendment."
"This beer pours a hazy brown color. the head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel with some sour notes, and some spices. It is all rather mild though. The taste is similar to the aroma. I'm not sure if the slight sourness I detect is supposed to be there or not, but regardless it is quite pleasant. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a decent beer."
"The feel of this beer is like an old cigar. Well past it's prime it is not worth wasting the match."
"To be frank, this beer is a mess. I have no idea what the hell they were trying to do here, and the spices, prominently mentioned on the can, are a sideshow at best for the trainwreck of sour flavors and aromas that dominate. I struggled to finish one can. Not good."
"D - Drinkable. You would never know this was toward 8%. Tastes like it's 5%. A pretty good winter warmer."
"4.5/4/3/3.5/2.5"
"D- The lack of flavor and sheer dependence on the winter spices makes this one hard to drink. Bummer, here is a case of not judging a beer by its cover."
"Fireside looks darkish a deep dark red deep maroon, big brown, with a smal amount of tannish cap up above. A bright reddish towards the light Leaves small clunks on the glass. Smell is holiday spice with cinnamon, with a mix of sweet and sour. Taste is brighter than expected. Cherry, tart apple, spice, cinnamon, etc, a bready thing in the back. Traces of cocco and some roasted malt in the end. Feel is medium, brisk, lively, not overly spiced, quaffable, not cloying, carbey off the tap. Feel is kinda similar in weight/gravity to the Monk's Blood that relesed lst year. I drank my pint quick and considered another."
"D: Hmmm.... I would have never pegged this as a Christmas holiday brew. Sort of generic, but I could easily drink a couple of these without needing any other food or drink to cut it. I know that my review looks totally different than the others on here, so maybe my taste buds are off.... just maybe. I'll stick to my guns for now."
"D/M: You really dont sense the alcohol but this really has a nice clean flavor that is surprisingly underwhelming as far as weight goes. I could have gone for a thicker richer flavor."
"Would I buy more of it? - sure. I'm glad it comes in a six-pack and I will look forward to trying more of it next winter (or maybe later this winter as its a long one here in New England)."
"Overall, I like this beer. It's not overly drinkable, but it has a unique flavor to it. I love the packaging, not that that has anything to do with the quality of the beer, but says something about the brewery, I think. For a Winter warmer, this one is pretty good."
"Pours deep brown with a fluffy creme head. Detailed lacing sticks around. Molasses sweet aroma. Very smooth and full of flavor. Picking up notes of cinnamon and dark cherry. Surprisingly mild and developed flavors as if it's been mellowed with time. Over time some vanilla notes show up. Excellent round sweet finish. Not a hint of the 7.9% ABV."
"D- Not impressed with this one. I was hoping for some subtle spice to go along with a nice malty brew but this one didn't come through"
"D: great winter beer. I love the elf."
"Drinkability is pretty good, this really worked for me as far as winter warmers go, which I'm normally not to fond of. I'm normally not a fan of spiced beers, but they were somewhat tempered here by the rich maltiness, although there was a bit of buildup in the back of the throat by the end of the pint. Smooth and strong are also big pluses in my book!"
"Taste is stronger and more complex, overall excellent. It has nice dark fruits, some soured fruit and light hint of balsamic vinegar, a lot of dark toast that is nicely caramelised, wet leafy and woody spice. It is lightly to the sweet side with some light bitterness underneath. The element holds up very well and it is very enjoyable and satisfying. Feel is very good, solid and lively."
"I can appreciate this, but I'd move on before too long. It's a respectable offering from 21st, but for now I'll stick with their hoppier styles."
"D - I enjoyed drinking this beer and like what 21st Ammend. has done with it. However, if I had to choose between this and another Holiday/Christmas/Winter Warmer I don't know if this would win out every time."
"0 for 2 tonight...not sure I have anything left in the fridge that can totally ruin this night of beer..."
"DB- I could see this being a decent beer from the aroma and what comes through in the flavor... but the sourness and metallic aspects ruin this experience before it really blooms. Infection?"
"D - As far as winter warmers, in a can goes, this one is my favorite. Nothing really for return visits but I could see this in my mixed sixer again. Since the price is right."
"Overall, a rather middle-of-the-road winter warmer that nevertheless fits easily into a winter coat pocket for assorted outdoor events."
"drinks ok. very average as far as winter brews go. would rather a ""mass-produced"" winter warmer at this point. the metallic character gives canned craft beers a bad rep, when many others don't suffer from that... its not the can just something a bit off in the beer."
"D: Another loser from 21A. This was bad in just about every way."
"a bit disappointing. did not warm me at all!!"
"Pours a deep chestnut brown color with a tight, dense khaki colored head, which settles into a light cap with some sticky lacing. The aroma is of brown sugar and spices. The spices seem to be nutmeg and cinnamon, perhaps some ginger. I want to say I pick up some vanilla as well. The flavor starts off with a nice mellow chocolate flavor but is quickly overwhelmed with a strong lemon and tea like flavor. It has a sour berry thing going on and the spice that I picked up in the nose went in hiding. No artifical flavor which is a plus. The feel is creamy yet has quite active carbonation. The beer has a moderate body and is mostly sour throughout. The ABV is well hidden but doesn't need to be as high considering the body. It is not a bad beer but I dinged it a bit because of the style. I feel that it lacks on the malty richness for the style and is way too sour for the style. I will have no issues drinking the rest of the 6 pack."
"Pours a pretty chestnut brown with a finger's worth of creamy tan head. Aroma of sweet dark and caramel malt, some notes of holiday spice, and a whiff of alcohol. Palate is malty up front with a touch of caramel sweetness. A bit of bittersweet chocolate and holiday spices come through before the swallow. Notes of clove, allspice, and/or nutmeg are present. Finish is clean, with just a touch of warmth from the alcohol. Body is a little thin for a beer of this strength."
"Notes: This can may suffer equally from bad marketing and hype. Quite attractive in the design, and with a typically rather likable profile as with the other 21st Amendment brews, it sure comes as a bit of a hefty sour surprise. If one is not warned about that profile, and then one does not like the spiced sourness it is bound to disappoint. Ultimately it is not that bad a brew, but being a bit clearer about the overall profile might help it quite a bit..."
"D: Not a big fan. Seems a bit out of place for me."
"I am afraid I got a bad batch. It was that bad. Unless it was meant to be a sour beer. Then they hit it dead on."
"D - A highly drinkable beer. I could see having a few of these in a night and feeling great. I will definitely buy more this winter season."
"D) A decent winter warmer. Could be a bit heavier in body."
"Would think that a hot-out-of-the-oven chocolate brownie with hot chocolate sauce on it would be a perfect pairing for this..."
"T - Very carbonated but not much spice taste. I cant tell exactly what the flavor is I'm tasting. It's sweet with some bitterness. Not a great taste."
"The taste is off-putting. The other characteristics of the beer are good, but the sourness makes me wonder if I got a bad batch or something. Wouldn't try this again unless I knew for a fact I got a bad one."
"D: this beer is worth trying for the sake of being unique and interesting, but it is not something I could see myself seeking out or even drinking again. The end product seems to be over spiced and just doesn't translate to a great beer."
"This is a milder Christmas ale; a bit of a muted version of the Anchor version, still flavorful. Apparently I liked it better than most people here."
"Poured from the can into a standard shaker pint. Pours a murky golden brown. A slight smell of molases is present but not much else. Taste is non-existant. No flavor at all. A lot of carbonation but it takes away from the severe lack of any flavor. This is a downright undrinkable beer. Fail."
"M/D: Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall everything is good about this beer except the taste, which is the most important thing. A real big letdown, was hoping for much more but will probably not have this again."
"Easy drinking, easily addictive, a great seasonal winter beer."
"Drinkability - a decent brew, props for the presidential can art. Doesn't have an elevated appeal for me like winter warmers generally do, but this is more of a spiced brown ale."
"Flavorful, spiced up creation, with notes of smoke, burnt malts, dark chocolate, then quite dry in the finish. Taste is all over the place and doesnt really come together all that well. On the thin side and lacking a solid finish. Another blah beer from 21st Amendment. Contract brewed in Minnesota. I'm getting the feeling this brand is all style and little substance. Nice looking gaphics on the can and packaging, fairly lame attempt at a craft brew in the can. It is warming, but this is a less then decent winter warmer/night capper."
"D: Not a real drinkable beer, though I would say that about most spiced ales - just too much going on too drink more than 1 or 2."
"Pours a deep amber to almost black in color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, sugary caramel, like standing in a candy shop. In the taste, roasty, quite sugary, and very candy like. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small hint of dry caramel in the aftertaste. A bit sugary and candy like, ok, but it could be too much after one."
"I don't even want to spend any more time on this review it was so bad. Stay away ..."
"D- I really enjoyed this beer. I'm not usually a big fan of ww but this one brings something new to the style for me. Ill keep my eye out for it on draft."
"Pours a dark amber/cherry color with decent head. Decent lacing. Immediate aroma of sourness, funk, and sweet candied malts. WTF? Definitely not what I expected. Smells like a Flemish Red/Sour Ale. Taste follows with brettomyces-like sourness and funk along with sweet malts, cherries, and bitter/tart/sour finish. Mouthfeel is semi dry, kind of thin. I really do not understand this beer at all and not sure what they were aiming for. I don't pick up any of the cinnamon and utmeg spice that they claim to have thrown in. I'm so confused..."
"D: Good, not great, it was interesting to try but I'm not sure this is going on the ""buy again next winter"" list."
"All in all, this is a good brew. A nice spiced ale. Good for a winter evening. Nice to try if you like a very heavy spiced brew."
"Drinkability: the beer was enjoyable. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. I'm not sure if I'd buy it again though."
"The flavor is an improvement: there's a hazelnut element to the tongue. It has a mild peppery bite in the swallow. This is a surprisingly thin brew. There is a minor metallic presence in the taste, but overall it is true to the winter warmer style."
"D-An average winter warmer."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very dark brown color with some amber hues and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong with spices, considerable nutmeg and cinnamon. Taste is a bit subdued compared with the smell. Hops up front, a strong spice presence. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"D - I hesitated on picking this one up and now I'm wishing I didn't...I've tried a few 21st Amendment brews before and I have liked them...but this one just didn't do it for me...it tasted like a slightly roasted Saison"
"Got one can as a free sample from work. Poured a dark red color into my small glass. I was excited to try this since I am a fan of their beers and I have been to their restaurant. Unfortunately for me this beer didn't hold up for me to their other beers such as watermelon wheat and their IPA. I'm not impressed with it. It's not something I would get again. It doesn't have much flavor so it falls flat and without flavor I wouldn't really call it a beer."
"Chestnut/mahogany body with a thick foamy tan head. Very dark without being pitch black. Nose is very spicy: somewhat musty with notes of cinnamon, ginger, and caramel. Flavor is of chocolate malt, caramel, Belgian spice, slightly funky/sour (similar to a dark saison a'la Fantome?), and moderately hoppy. Creamy full body with moderate carbonation. Slightly metallic. Not too crazy about this one, but not the worst beer I have ever had."
"Pours a deep brown mahogany with ruby highlights when held toward the light, also forms a light tan head rising above my chalice. Fine even speckled lacing sticks to the glass. Aroma has a dark roasty cocoa accent with the dark roasted malts used, hints of subtle spices added as well a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg coated with honey glaze. Herbal/mild citrus hops in the background I see the beer actually clocks in at 45 IBUs, I wouldn't have estimated it being that high. Flavor has dark roasted malts cocoa rustic dark breadiness, herbal citric hops with spices running through. A nice tartness comes through the middle of it almost has some orange peel characteristics. Ample bitterness amongst the malts and spice additions, a nice complex canned ale perfect for the colder weather. Mouthfeel is medium bodied dry bitter finish from the spices and moderate hop dose, carbonation is moderate tickles the throat a good bit but also carries the spices across the palate nicely. Drinkability overall, I'm glad I grabbed a six of this for $9.99 it will last me throughout the winter months. A can here or there is what I would like to do, not much of a beer I want to sit and enjoy in number but it's nice if you're in the mood for this type of beer."
"My aggressive Crack & Pour again threatened to overflow the glass, but to no avail. I had a big, rocky two fingers of mocha-tan head with modest retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights at the edges. Nose was big with cinnamon coupled with dark chocolate. I was reminded of MexiCAN hot chocolate with its infusion of spices. Mouthfeel was medium with cinnamon, nutmeg and chocolate all intermingling on my tongue. Tasty. Finish lingered with a pleasant admixture of spice which overpowered the chocolate. I CAN't recommend putting this in a cooler, but maybe by the fireplace on Christmas Eve ... ?"
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. I could drink several of them and will be drinking it again."
"drinkability: wasn't a very exciting beer but it wasn't a drain pour."
"I guess I can understand why this beer didn't work for some people, but I find it fairly enjoyable. The sourness is mild and doesn't clash with the spices."
"The aftertaste is sweet with some plastic and metal. The beer has medium to light body with creamy carbonation. It doesn't feel bad, but the lingering artificial tastes make me never want another sip. This is going down the drain. I bought this single for $1.49 and I won't take another Big Mac priced gamble on another 21st Amendment beer again. Seriously, who is buying this stuff? The black IPA sucked, the IPA has less flavor in the whole can than Avery or Oskar Blues have in one sip, and the watermelon beer tastes like corn. Stop the madness, you're doing a disservice to craft beer."
"D: Not bad but probably not a warmer I would go back to in the future"
"Drinkability: Terrible. I'm convinced I had an infected batch. I really hope so as most of the previous stuff from 21st Amendment as been good."
"Drinkability: The burnt metallic finish just kills this, and destroys any complexity. Not really sure where the spices are either, although I thought I smelled a little."
"Kicking myself now for picking up a 6 pack. Its nut what I expected. Although alcohol is well hidden. Its very dry and stouty in flavor, but not in color, so it is somwhat misleading. The only way I can really drink this is by chugging it and even then its a difficult task. This is just not good."
"I can count on one hand how many drainpours I've ever had and this one is going to get added to that. There is nothing natural about the nose or the taste here. Avoid this beer at all costs unless you like drinking aerosol cans of room freshening spray."
"Overall this is a winter warmer that's very close to being over the top but it stops just short. A robust and well done beer that's worth a shot."
"Can, poured a Dark chestnut brown with tan frothy head. Toasty roasted aroma, a little dusting of nutmeg over a smooth brown ale. Flavor is somewhat stale malting with some graininess and along with some allspice. Finishes kinda weak, med. body. Doesn't taste bad, but expect more from a ""Holiday"" brew."
"One bright note, the drawing on the can is very well done and appropriate.. too bad that doesn't count for anything."
"Overall, a decent enough brew, but nothing special. Try it once and decide for yourself."
"Cool beer, cool can, guess I'm back in your camp for now, 21st.."
"The flavor is nutty malt with a very earthy edge. The yeast flavor seems to be prominent as well. The spice is pretty subdued. The flavor of this for some reason reminds me of a doppelbock. The end of the flavor comes off as tart with a bit of spice kick. Overall this needs more spice of bigger malt or perhaps a bigger malt profile, because this is kind of underwhelming, albeit tasty. There are dark cherries involved along with plums too."
"A very good spiced Winter Warmer, although not quite to the level of Anchor's Our Special Ale. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit as it is hard for me to drink more than one spiced beer in an evening, but I certainly did enjoy trying this and will save the rest of the 6-pack for around Thanksgiving and Christmas."
