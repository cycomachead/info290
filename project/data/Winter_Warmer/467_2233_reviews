"This is pretty good.  A nice subtle version of the style; sweet, hoppy, toasted flavors are balanced off one another pretty well. The only thing that really surprises me is the slightly thin mouthfeel."

"Overall : this is a decent beer, and although I am at a loss for words in describing it, it's something I'd have again. It's very fruity and earthy. A nice Belgian dark ale."
"Overall this is a nice balanced beer that doesn't go overboard in any direction but still lets you know it is well made.  Unlike some spiced winter warmers the spices are an integral part of the flavor rather than something that dominates it.  That said, however, if I were going to stock up on a Winter Warmer I think I'd still give the Lancaster Brewing Winter Warmer the nod in preference to this one, if only because I like the way Lancaster Brewing have used both British and American hops and because of the the greater warmth from the higher ABV."

"Summit Porter is better."

"I am watching the inaugural College Bowl Championship Game tonight in the grip of a Winter day. The tab fought me, briefly, but the Crack! was deafening. I got a light spritz as a result and now my curiosity was piqued to CANduct an inverted Glug. The pseudo-cascade came up pretty quickly, requiring that I back off, but not before the formation of three fingers of dense, rocky, light-tan head with good retention. Color was Dark Brown to Very Dark Brown (SRM = > 27, "
""
""
"Typical winter ale nothing really stands out"
""
"Overall: Like Summit's other standards, I've been drinking this one with gratitude for many years...alongside of the EPA, the Great Northern Porter, and the Maibock, it is an old dependable when out and about at places that aren't beer-centric.  Good stuff."
"Great seasonal, along the lines of a toasty brown ale."

"Bottle into a tulip pint. Dark brown, 1/2 inch tan head with a ""drippy"" lacing. Moderate to light carbonation. Pleasant malt-fruit-tinged aroma. Thickish body and mouth feel. Take a drink and the hops bitterness hits first, followed by lightly roasted malt flavor. Then more bitterness comes through, but not overly so. This remains a nicely balanced ale front to back. Aftertaste is a mild lingering bitterness fading on the tongue."
"Winter Ale pours a dark amber color with a small but lacing head.  There is a mild spicy aroma.  The taste is very full, good sharp malty backbone, with some noticeable hints of sweet spices.  Good feel, good body.  Overall a nice easy drinking warmer."

"Good seasonal with balanced taste. On tap at Crooked Pint Ale House in Apple Valley...nice place."

"Nice deep amber color, good head. Fairly hoppy with slight spices"

"Would like to try this fresh, but it's great with some age on it. The spices have probably dwindled, which suits my palate well. The tart note is slightly overwhelming, but this is a good brew."

"Pours a very dark brown, almost black in color with a small off-white head. Lots of ring lacing was seen with each sip. Sediment was left in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. The aroma is of roasted malt, cocoa, caramel and some spice. The taste even has more going on with a slight nutty finish. Very smooth to drink with low carbonation. Very tasty brew! Really liked this one."

"Pours out quite black with a half finger beige head with not too much retention. Smell is of dark fruit, prunes, with a slight bit of sweetness. Really no hops I sense from the nose. This is all the malt bill. Taste is a bit mellowed down from the smell except there is a tiny hop presence that isn't noticeable at the first part of the taste but definitely in the end -- nothing too bitter to be sure as this is really balanced well. Mouthfeel is fairly light. Overall I really liked this beer more than the last time I had it. Summit typically puts out good beers at least with their normal releases."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/19/2013. Pours moderately cloudy reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, light roast, brown bread, light raisin, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark and nutty malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, chocolate, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, brown bread, light roast, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, chocolate, brown bread, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark and nutty malt notes; with very nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice winter warmer style. All around nice balance and robustness of dark/nutty malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."

"O- Nice winter treat, not overly spicy and the 6.1% ABV is well hidden. Not the best winter warmer I've ever had but a solid one."
"It'll definately warm you up on a cold day."

"B 84-5"
"Not one I'll be seeking out again. Not bad, but not really good either, IMO. Just doesn't have much flavor, or much aroma. Woody, nutty, but in faint ways that don't do it for me."
""
""
"Pours dark brown with reddish background. White foam sits and is fluffy. Caramel nose. Other light winter spices. Taste is a light malt, with dark fruit infused caramel. Getting some raisin hints in there. Plums. Medium body, maybe a touch too sweet. Above average."
"Underwhelming beer. Goes with underwhelming music. Try Wynton Marsalis' J Mood cd or Joe Walsh - Ordinary Average Guy .Maybe a recording of the radio show Prarie Home Companion by Garrison Keillor who writes about a small town in Minnesota where all the women are strong, the men are good looking and the kids are ALL ...ABOVE AVERAGE..."

"Overall – A nice blend of chocolate, sweet, roast, and spice flavors. While in some ways it drank more like a porter then a winter warmer it is a good easy drinking brew."
"O - This beer has many great qualities, none of which are warming abilities. Beautiful on the eyes and great aroma dimension. Flavor is a little understated but has good feel. However, I never really sensed any spices to the beer nor at 6.1% does it really warm me up. Reminds me of a good brown porter. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that this beer was included in my 12 pack sampler."
""
""
"O - Summit's Winter Ale provides a smooth body with moderate heft for a satisfying cold-day brew that incorporates English hops wonderfully for a balanced flavor and touch of spiciness. This beer avoids being lumped with the over-spiced and sometimes overplayed holiday beers but manages a subtle nod to them for a nice winter treat!"

"I'm not typically a fan of winter warmers, but this one is tasty. I didn't like it at first, but it's grown on me."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: So it didn't live up to the hype that I've given it in my mind. However, it's still a great beer and worthy of a place in anyone's fridge during the winter. Would I drink it again? Of course, I'll probably seek it out on tap next time."
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably."
"Smells of lightly toasted and toffee malts, with lighter amounts of herbal character. Tastes of a blend of chocolate, toasted, and toffee malts with some light spice and nuttiness. Not too fancy, but not bad either. Falls somewhat on the sweeter side in terms of balancing."

""

""

"D/O: This is a winter warmer worth considering for those that shy away from the heavily-spiced contributions. Instead, this beer is malt-focused and dark, tasting like an under-strength Baltic porter. Expect it to serve in a range of pairing roles, from porter to dubbel to strong stout."
""
""
""
""
""

"A: single finger off white head with excellent retention on a dark brown body with a little light passing through. Thick, circumferential lacing. Aroma is very malty with dark fruit, chocolate and sugary notes. Flavor is also malty with strong smokey sense, toffee and nutty. Medium to thick body and moderate carbonation. Very smooth. Overall a nice member of the genre, one of the more flavorful and full bodied."
""
"Overall - For a beer, it's pretty decent in terms of flavor and it's easier to drink than some other beers. As a Winter Warmer, there are better beers of that style in particular out there."
"O: Why does everyone expect spice in a winter warmer? This is a very good example of the style overall. Roasty and warming. Very comforting and I can have more than one. Very palate friendly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This brew was made for winter...bold wintry flavors but somethings missing...a decent brew for this time of year"
""
"C-"
""
"Overall- A good winter ale if not a little weak in its category. Other beers represent this better, but this isnt something you should pass up on."
""
"This was decent, with a lot going on with it flavor wise. I was actually looking for a little stronger spice character out of this to help set it within the Winter Warmer style, as this came off a bit more to me like an American Porter at times. Never the less, I still enjoyed this for what it was. I’m glad I picked a bottle up."
""
"This is an easy-drinking, pleasant mild winter ale. Not overly spiced - which is fine by me!"
"O- This beer goes down way too quickly. It's sweet as a nut, and a real joy to drink."
"Really nice body on this beer. I'm a fan or malt - and this delivers."
"Overall, a very enjoyable, very seasonal beer."
"Overall: I believe this is an excellent brew. I was a little unsure of it when I picked it to round out my mix-and-match sixer, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had no idea it was as dark as it was and was caught off guard after the pour. When I smelled this beer, the complex aroma really hit me, and I was impressed. I would certainly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - To me this is a good brew, it has the warming affect that a winter ale should it taste a lot like a normal ale with some caramel undertones"
""
""
"Not bad. Beef flavor is a little weird but it is still pretty tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall: I have a hunch that the recipe for this might have changed as older reviews characterize this as an amped-up porter; this year's version is much more like a moderately-hopped nut brown ale; rather enjoyable, overall"
"Overall I'm really impressed with this one. It has a great flavor profile, appearance, and it doesn't over use the spices."
""
"Overall, it's an interesting beer. I think it would satisfy a party of people who only like light beers with the other half only liking dark beers. bleh"
""
"O - It's a good ale to have in the cold, but doesn't quite live up to my winter warmer standards."
""
"O: Nice winter ale, nothing too special here though."
""
""
""
""
"Mild malt toastiness, molasses, cocoa powder, light malty flavors, not sweet or bitter really. Light bodied, nearly watery but stops short. Easy going, nothing really stands out about it, but it has an autumnal character and is easy enough to drink."
"It tastes very porter-ish. Not very winter warmery, but not a bad beer."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid winter warmer. Very good use of malts. Sweet but balanced."
""
"O: This tastes and feels like a winter warmer to me. Roasted, malty, smooth, and warm. I liked this better than the First Snow Ale."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours dark brown with a bit of reddish hue. There is a good head and quite a bit of lace. The nose is sweet caramel and some mild spice as well as dark fruits. The taste is slightly sweet with a nice malt character. Good, light spice. Finish is a bit dry but, a nice balance between normal beer and an overspiced seasonal. A solid winter warmer!"
""

"(O) It's a decent winter brew. Has some good flavor for a winter beer. Nor overly spicy or hefty on the cinnamon. Good, solid amber ale."
"O- It's an ok tasting beer but there are enough better Winter Warmers out there I'd probably pass on this in the future."
"A pretty decent beer, worthy a spot on your to do list."
"ORDINARY, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Mild is the word that I would use to describe this beer. There is nothing spectacular about it, and at the same time I would not hesitate to try again. Really reminds me of a slightly muted version of Summit's Great Northern Porter, which is a beer that I love."
"d - A nice winter warmer with some nice caramel malts. Would have again."
"Notes: Reminds me of a slightly hoppy and spiced porter. Mayber a slight English taste (hops or yeast possibly). Not bad, but nothing really engaging or intriguing."
"Pours a very dark red, almost brown with plenty of carbonation and a pleasant malty, coffee with cream sort of aroma. The caramel and roasted malts are the standout flavor in this beer, helping to create complexity with a distinct nuttiness and touch of toffee. The hop flavor and bitterness seems to be played down quite a bit, letting the malts express their flavors. the woody English hops express themselves a little better as the beer warms up. This is a beer best left to warm up quite a bit before that first sip, otherwise its complexity is far less evident. Toffee-ish malts in the finish and a hint of tannin. Overall, a pretty decent Winter Warmer but I think the drinkability would be better if it had a slightly more memorable finish."
"While not the boldest or most drinkable winter seasonal, it does compensate with its own unique complexities. The wintry flavors are there, probably best enjoyed with holiday chocolates or other nutty confections."
"Pours dark brown with a bit of reddish hue. There is a good head and quite a bit of lace. The nose is sweet caramel and some mild spice as well as dark fruits. The taste is slightly sweet with a nice malt character. Good, light spice. The age has treated this one well. Finish is a bit dry and the spice comes through a bit too much. Overall, a nice balance between normal beer and an overspiced seasonal."
"Even with the slight astringency, I think this one's pretty tasty, and a great, malty wither ale."
"This has really strong drinkability. The flavors do not overwhelm like some winter warmers do and the alcohol is lower which also helps. This is a nice beer that I would actually prefer over the majority of others in the style I've had. Just another solid beer from Summit."
"Drinkability: Someone call Summit and tell them Winter Ale is not a winter warmer, at least in the liquid Christmas tree sense. It is, instead, a solid and malty beer."
"Pours a thick dark blackish brown. Light brown head that settles to a thin film quickly. The smell is rather understated and bland. A little sour with some burnt toast notes but mostly just kind of bland. The tasted follows suit. A hint of a sweet malty body with some smokey roasted grain flavors followed by a hint of sour at the finish. A few herbal hop flavors come out but very few. This beer just need more of something. Either more of a sweet malty taste or more of a bitter herbal hop taste or more of a burnt roasted grain coffee taste, just more of something. I usually don't like spiced beers, but maybe that's what it is missing. It was just kind of forgettable."
"Slight tangy spice up front, chocolate and roasted nut with a hint of coffee and burnt carmel."
"Cheeers."
"O: Nicely done. This is a very solid beer."
"Nice brown color, inch think head, smelled nicely of coffee, with hints of chocolate and hops, and just a pinch of malty goodness. Laced nicely down the side of my glass as I worked through it. Did the perfect job for a winter warmer, warmed me up and went down nice and smooth. great Brew."
"The mouthfeel was rather good. The beer had a good body and a smooth, silky carbonation. The alcohol did not show through. This is probably one of the better beers Summit makes. It was quite enjoyable."
"Factoring in the flavor, aroma, body and ABV, good, but not exceptional drinkability."
"Drinkability: This brew does warm you up nicely in the winter and doesn't have any overpowering tastes that would deter anyone from grabbing another bottle."
"Notes: This beer is medium bodied, and lacks a bit in what I usually look for in a winter warmer. It's not quite as balanced as I would like, but overall, Summit's Winter Ale is a pretty solid brew, and at least worth a try."
"D -- A very nice, rich ale. Nice as a fall/winter beer -- sets a great mood for a chilly afternoon or evening."
"Clear liquid, very dark red (almost brown). Cream colored head had great retention and some nice looking lacing. Malt dominant smell, with some 'winter' spice, cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar. Complex flavor has all the above elements, strong enough to be noticeable but not overpowering with any one taste. Medium body, appropriate amount of carbonation. Good all around brew, fits the style nicely."
"M/D: Medium to light body. Carbonation seems pretty average. Drinkability is okay, nothing too special"
"Taste follows suit pretty well with the roasty malts more prominent but still maintaining plenty of sweetness. There is some bittering, leafy hops on the finish...almost minty even. The dark malts are pretty nice, but there is not much depth here, pretty much a one trick pony. Not bad, I would not mind having another one of these sometime down the road."
"M/D - Medium bodied brew. Big coffee taste that keeps smooth as it goes down. Slight taste of sweet and spices, chocolate is the biggest flavor with some spices mixed in. Overall I enjoyed the brew and more than likely have again"
"Mouthfeel, makes me think I'm getting a little cherry and tree in my beer. Very little, but its neat its there. Enjoyable to drink, relatively inexpensive. Exceeded expectations."
"Very good drinkability but at this size one was enough with dinner."
"A decent winter brew, I could session this easily. However, I am so used to the BIG winter brews that this lighter offering feels slightly off. If you would have lied to me and called this a German spring something or other I might have liked it better. That's psycology for you."
"This beer is not very assertive in the flavor department. I would like to see a bit more flavor with a touch of complexity."
"Overall- an ok winter warmer. It seems as if every winter warmer I've had this season have had completely different taste profiles. I guess each brewer has their own interpretations of this style. Nothing offensive here- nothing outstanding."
"Overall, a very solid offering and a welcome component of the winter sampler pack, nothing that blows your socks off but definitely a pleasant pour."
"Poured into a 12-oz mug, this shows a nice reddish-brown color, not quite opaque, with a small off-white head. The nose has a lot of roasted notes, with sweet caramel. The roast is less prominent to taste, but still a main component, together with some modest cocoa, caramel, and more bitterness than I expected (though no hop flavor comes through). The body is a little thin, given the strength and maltiness."
"Purchased from Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN. Pours a dark reddish brown body with a thick light-tan head and leave good lacing. Aroma is of chocolate malt and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Flavor is dominated by nutty sweet malts. Good drinkability, but this is really a nut brown ale and not what I would call a winter ale."
"D- An all around good beer that fits the style excellently. This is my first outing with Summit and I am impressed."
"The aroma did not leave me any lasting impressions, but the beer had a rich deep malty kick coupled with a nice hoppiness about it. It was a fantastic beer to pair with a strongly flavoured dinner, such as I was having, but I would not consider it for more than a beer or two with dinner as it was too heavy on the palate for more than a couple of beers in a few hours."
"Drinkability: I don't plan on buying this beer again. It wasn't really offensive, but it just didn't seem to bring anything special to the table. However, I wouldn't object to drinking it if offered."
"pours a a dark chocolate brown with a small head and a little sticky lacing the smell was some cocoa and chocolate with some hops and malts and toffee..the taste was some cocoa and coffee and some currant fruits mixed with grassy hops with a caramel malt finish ...overall this drank like a light porter or stout maybe a brown it was good a little thin for the category..but drinkable and worth a try"
"Drinkability: Despite being called a Winter Warmer here, this is really a rich, sweet and malty Brown Ale. Summit also calls it a Brown Ale. Quite nice overall, but a little dull for a Winter Ale."
"Drinkability is decent. For a winter brew this gets the job done, but it is easily forgotten due to the base quality of the overall pour. It lacks any defining qualities."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: A very nice porter-like winter warmer that has held up quite well in my basement and may have gained a little complexity. I'm (so far) resisting the temptation to go downstairs and open another one."
"D - Good flavor. Not too complex but still interesting enough. Slightly higher alcohol level may keep some from drinking this all night, but still worth having one or two. This is probably my favorite beer by Summit Brewing so far."
"Mouthfeel is a little disappointing compared to the flavor this beer has. A little thicker would be nice."
"D - Overall a good rendition of a winter warmer but just not something that makes my tastebuds dance. Had many winter warmers this season and was the least impressive."
"D - Smooth overall. I could have a few in sitting."
"6/4/6/3/12/3.1"
"The initial poor and smell i thought this would be a really good winter beer. Then I started to drink and I thought the taste was alright. Then I got to the aftertaste in the mouth and there was really nothing special about it. No hops, chocolate or coffee taste, or spices. I was dissappointed."
"Had on tap at Murphy's pub in Champaign. Pours a reddish-brown with medium thick off-white head that lingered well and left good lacing. Both the nose and flavor were a very good mix of caramel, coffee and licorice, with the taste more dominant than the aroma. As the beer warmed, the licorice became more overpowering than the other elements, which led to a tingly mouth and warming finish. Not a bad winter warmer at all."
"This is a pretty drinkable winter brew, but there's nothing that stands out too much here."
"The aroma is very toasted and almost smokey with coffee, toffee, and a touch of spice. The appearance is dark red brown with a foamy head. The flavor is like the aroma but too tangy and acidic. The palate is average for the style. Overall its OK but not that good."
"This is a really good winter beer. It is very dark. Sort of like a porter, but clear. It also has the coffee scent and taste. That goes well with the low carbonation. It is very well balanced between the roasted malt and bitter hops which makes it really easy to drink."
"Overall a complex beer, pretty strong tasting. Plenty of flavor and a solid bitterness here. Not one for a hot day out in the boat. For sure a winter warmer style brew."
"D- Very interesting brew and I think I could go back to this one."
"D= decent. One of the best winter warmers I've had. Really makes me feel good about winter in minnesota."
"Poured a thin head which sticks nicely to the side of the glass. Colour is very dark, darker than some of the other winter ales I tried. I could smell a hint of coffee in the malt. Tastes great and goes down quite easily. I was very impressed with this beer and it was a good bit better than I expected it to be."
"This is great. More stout like than some other Winter Warmers, and there is nothing wrong with that. I would recommend this."
"D: Easy to drink, wouldn't mind having another."
"Pours a dark red color body. Average cream-colored head, somewhat diminishing. Malty aroma, some strawberry. Some hoppiness and English maltIness. Not a strong aroma. Hoppy dark chocolately malt taste. Some alcohol and some toffee. Okay body, somewhat watery. Very porterish/stouty taste and palate."
"Color is dark amber, with and off white head. Smells and tastes of dark chocolate, and coffee. Roasted malts present as well. Faint hoppiness as well. Mouthfeel was the best part in my opinion. Medium body and very creamy. Excellent."
"Definately worth a try"
"Very well balanced. Complexity is outstanding. A marriage of an American brown and a porter. I am definitely picking up more soon."
"Over and out..."
"I want the original recipie back."
"D- If you are in MN, you know that this beer is everywhere. From the highest end beer bars to the diviest joints around. Is it drinkable; hell yea and if you spend enough nights with the locals, this is probably what you will end up drinking a lot of."
"D- Somewhat drinkable, but I wouldn't have more than a couple."
"d- drank somewhat like a porter to me, not a bad thing, very smooth for the color"
"D - Moderately drinkable. The malt flavor could easily overwhelm the palate."
"Overall, this was a great beer and at the price, you can't go wrong. I would suggest you at least give this one a shot."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with amber highlights, a one finger tan colored head with big bubbles and light lacing. Smells just about like every other Summit beer. Light hopping, cooked malts, with the addition of some caramel and light spices. Flavor is of some lightly roasted and biscuity malts, light chocolate, hints of caramel and toffee, and an average hop bitterness. I swear every Summit brew has the exact same hopping. I always know what to expect from them. Creamy mouthfeel, a bit light decent carbonation. This is actually better than most Summit beers, and would probably take this one over all their others if it were available year round. Average Winter Warmer at best, however."
"Not one to let me down, I had a feeling Summit would have a nice winter seasonal. This is a fantastic strong ale. Abundant roasted aroma very rich and appealing. Awesome pour amber/brown color with a long lasting one inch light tan head and layers upon layers of lacing. Mouthfeel isn't as full as expected but it's smooth and gratifying. Flavor is a half step under the great aroma. Very malty almost drinks like a porter, if it were darker I would be fooled. Some smokiness with mild flavors of chocolate, licorice, and coffee. Small hop presence. Overall a great beer any time of the year."
"Overall - Very good and very smooth."
"I have nothing further to say. This beer defines mediocrity. OK to drink, look at, inhale. Nothing stands out. A completely forgettable beer."
"D-Smooth on the way down, and very drinkable. Won't fatigue the palate. No alcoholic warmth (due to a tolerable ABV), so a couple won't send you to bed."
"This is one of my favorite 'winter' beers. I love summit, and I love winter, so its a perfect combo. When I found this beer at Hum's I did a little dance in the isle, because this beer represents the start of the winter beer season, and that is a wonderful thing."
" ~ I will recommend this brew to others despite the issues I have with the appearance and texture. I'm thinking the sight and feel may be better when sampled from draught."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a dark amber color with a deep red when held to the light. There was a 1/2 cream color head that left a nice line on the glass as it thinned. The smell of this brew is somewhat light with mild hints of malt, some oatmeal smell and some caramel. The taste is a little better with some chocolate and coffee notes but is a little thin and slightly watered down in the finish. This is a solid brew that was a nice surprise."
"This is a nice beer and I love the nose in particular. Many beers have dark, bittersweet chocolate characteristics but this one has a great milk chocolate/cocoa powder nose that is somewhat unique. I wish there was more of that in the flavor, but nevertheless this is a very enjoyable beer."
"D - An excellent winter warmer! This category is very hit or miss, and this is a definite hit. I love all of the flavors, and the mouthfeel is reallyl nice. Quality, quality beer."
"Final Thought: A very nice winter brew from the Twin cities, definitely will have one next season."
"Overall Impression: A solid beer. Great craftsmanship here is obvious as they get a lot of interesting flavors out of basic ingredients. My favorite Summit beer yet"
"for a winter ale it is surprisingly light and drinkable. it has a fresh warmth that i find very appealing. it has a nice malty flavor that lingers. the hop finish dances breifly on the tongue and dissapears as fast as it showed up. i could easily knock down 2 or 3 of these bad boys on a cold winters night or even a cold spring night for all you buckeyes who feel my pain."
"D- A nice low alcohol complex winter ale I look forward to for next year."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint glass. Poured a deep brown with less than a finger of white head. Deep malty aroma, molasses and caramelized sugar. Rich malty flavor and mouthfeel. Plenty of caramel malt. Not a lot of hop bitterness, but enough to balance out the malt sweetness. Very easy drinking, solid beer."
"I like it but it is not a beer that I could enjoy more then once a session."
"The lacing on this one did pretty well. It had good aromatics and mouthfeel with the taste being more subtle."
"Drinkability - Could stand to be a little bigger in all respects to make it a better winter ale. But as such does alright for its self."
"D- it's ok, but seems more like a porter."
"I figured I better start reviewing the ""old school"" local brewery a little more and picked up a sampler. The winter ale hasn't stood out in my mind among Summit's offerings. It's better than their Octoberfest but not too special. It's a decent beer though."
"D: A nice winter warmer. I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting, however. I was happy to have picked this up as a single, but might not want an entire six-pack."
"Man...I like this beer. I'm a big fan of brown ale and Summit's Winter Ale with it's dark appearance, roasted malt, hint of coffee, and hop flavors come together to create what I feel a well balanced beer. Doesn't have a lot of spice flavors like other winter warmers (which is alright by me). Reminds me of Big Sky's Moose Drool."
"All in all, worth a try. Be prepared for a different kind of Warmer with this, one a little shy on sweetness and spice, but original in its stout-porter leanings."
"Drinkability: I am glad i reviewed this beer because it opened me up to some smells and flavors that i have not experienced before in beer, being that i am new at this, that being said i dont think i could drink more than one in a sitting."
"Perhaps the best beer I've every had from Summit. However, I didn't use to like their Grand and a few bottles sitting in the basement fridge (aged a few months I guess) were much better than I ever remembered too."
"D - This is one of the better brews I've had from Summit. All in all, a nice winter warmer."
"Overall- I think that this carries alot of the characteristics of a chocolate stout, not a winter warmer. It has a low ABV and alot of the same aromas and tastes. Usually winter warmers will have a spicy taste. This one does not have that. That being said, I do really like this brew. Too bad it requires me to travel to Minnesota for work (yuk!) to get some more of it. It makes a great session beer as well. I will have to say that it was greatly enjoyable."
"pours a suprisingly dark color for a winter ale! nice 2 finger head,the lasts a nice while! nice caramel malt aroma! with hint of coffee! reminds me of a light stout both in flavor and taste! very drinkable! not much of a warmer due to a low Alcohol content ,a great addition to my winter mix!"
"It has a creamy mouthfeel brought on by its low carbonation and heavy body. A very nice cold day beer and I definately will be buying more of this during the winter months. Recommended."
"This beer starts with a robust porter like aroma from black malts combined with a dark fruit sweetness. These carry over into the taste and are similar but smoother than you'd get in an American robust porter. It's more like a nut brown ale with a roasted edge to it. I should mention there's a little bitterness at the end of the taste, but it's really an afterthought. Overall, this is a fairly clean winter warmer with a nice use of black malts."
"I will drink many more of these this winter. it is one of my favorite Winters. I usually not a big brown ale guy but something with the spice just makes it work for me. I live right next to Blu Max in Burnsville but I decided that to stick to an old favorite tonight rather then somethig new."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Lighter carbonation with a bit of a heavier body and a nice warming sensation give this brew a good mouthfeel. The body seems to be just right for the style. This is a brew that I'll definitely be buying in the future; however I'll prolly not buy it till the winter rolls round again. And even then I'll try some other warmers before I come back to it, but I definitely will come back. It just tastes so good."
"Drinkability: Not as spicy or high ABV as I normally expect from a winter warmer, but a good beer nonetheless."
"Good stuff."
"overall this is a very good beer that i really enjoyed"
"Easy to drink, not spectacular, but a good beer indeed, definitely better (and cheaper) than Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome."
"This beer has some interesting traits, but none of them totally wowed me, and I hate the way I always get metallic tastes from Summit bottles."
"This is probably the best beer I've from Summit. Pretty clean, and fairly drinkable, although there seems to be some alcohol warmth, despite the (relatively) low alcohol."
"Summit Winter Ale was a dark red-brown color with good clarity. The off-white head was short and creamy, leaving some nice lacing behind. The aroma was malty and toasty. The taste was sweet malt, roasted grain, and some bitterness with a dry finish. The body was medium with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's a nice winter warmer that's not overloaded all of the spices."
"ooh...nice. somewhat sweet with some hop overlaying hoppy chocolately brown ale. good balance. i must comment that sub-6% hardly seems very warming, though i enjoy this beer"
"Into a pint glass, pours a dark blackish color with ruby hues, a decent sized off-white head thats shrinks pretty quick and some pretty nice lacing. Aroma is spicy, if anything, pretty tame. Taste is better, spiced nicely with a nice malting, a little roasty with some brown sugars perhaps, light hopping, and a nice caramel/toffee/coffee through the middle. A good medium body and nicely carbonated, while still smooth and slightly creamy. A good MN beer, a yearly partaking, a good winter warmer."
"D - I like this beer a lot and I would recommend it to anyone."
"the flavor is malty but not to heavy, has a good hop spice but not over powering, nice full flavored brew. this beer is on style."
"Verdict: I would like to see a more rich body, it is a bit too sweet, and the flavors didn't meld all that well. Not a pour outer or turn downer, but I was not impressed."
"Drinkability is OK; I'd have another two of these."
"I've been drinking this beer too long now to be disappointed, but a funky off-flavor in the tap pour I had last night made me wonder. Pours the same crimson-amber I remember so well, with a rocky dark tan head. Nose is pungent, verily oozing the contents of its unctious nut-brown-on-steroids self into the air that surrounds my tiny head: so far so good! Lace that stretches from here to next year, really impressive when poured into the right glass (bulb in this case) and speaking of right glass did anyone else notice the new logo-embossed bottles? I thought so . . . nice touch in the packaging department and definitely adds to an already great beer and solid brewery. The nose offers toffee, rum, and some dates, along with a fair amount of bitterness and carmalized/roasted malts ala the Great Northern Porter (and that's a good thing as GNP has been my favorite Summit brand since day 1.) The diacetyl doesn't bother me here and never has, as I've found it to be a consistent part of Summit's stylistic interpretation for years. A bit creamy on the tongue, with evidence of the alcohol both present and welcoming. Not a ""thin"" brew . . . if anyone ever calls this beer thin please give them a bowl of oatmeal to go with it! It *can* be a bit sweet for some, in fact I'd go so far as to say treacly-sweet at one moment, but offset by a slightly-smokey, roasted malt bitterness the next. This bitterness lingers quite a bit, the way a nice hop bitterness does, and acts as the counterpoint to the fruity notes (cherry, plum, and cocoa as it warms a bit . . . ) Fruity in the right way, roasty and toasty in the right ways (malt and alcohol), Summit Winter is a great beer that has probably been outshined by other beers-of-the-moment in the past ten years or so, but it's been consistent, year after year, for almost as long as I can remember - reason enough for me to buy a case every winter!"
"pours out a clear but very dark mahoghany colour with a slight head without much lace. a very spicy and malty/doughy character in the nose along with some northwest hops. fullish medium body and mouthfeel. tastes of alcohol spiciness, which seems quick to warm the senses. the malt profile is hard to nail down...some very slight caramel and chocolate notes are discernible. dough and yeast...again the spice and alcohol notes come through in the end along with a hop bite finish that dances on the tongue.. like a liquid candy bar and overall a nice winter warmer that seems appropriate for the season."
"Dark, DARK chocolatey brown; almost completely opaque. Caramel-colored, good-sized head. Smell was not as prominent as I would have liked. Taste was like like biting on a delicious old plank. Earthy and a touch of roasted nuts, with just a warm, homey feel to it. Nice bitterness, not overwhelming. Hearty, full mouthfeel. Thick, syrupy finish; which was really nice for this beer. I plan to have a few of these on hand all winter..."
"Overall impression: Very well balanced and drinkable. A nice counter to many of the spiced winter beers on the market."
"Drinkability - this is a very hearty and very good beer and is very sessionable. This shoud be available year-round."
"Drinks easy, but not the most engaging winter warmer"
"This was surprisingly a nice brew. Lots of chocolatey malts and some odd fruity flavors going on in this beer. Very similar to Medocino's 2005 winter ale. Full bodied not much lacing and a decent head on the pour. Pours a dark, dark colour, blackish red. Very underpriced and a nice brew here, oh and on top of that all, this was a 2005 edition."
"Refreshing, and goes very well with savory foods like lamb stew. Solid drinkablity. I'll get some more of this next winter."
"This was a well bold spiced beer that poured a deep brown color with small head. Its smell was of roasted malts, bold spices, and dark fruits. It's amazingly smooth for its stlye of beer and yet it is still on the bitter side. The finish kinda lingers of drak fruits and spice. Its is a very drinkable beer since it is so smooth and tasty."
"Probably the best beer that I drank from the Summit variety pack. Though a bit sweet and wort-y, it's a solid brew with nothing to really complain about. Typical of Winer Warmers, the beer has a big molassas sweetness with a nutty, spicy, hoppy flavor and aroma. Creamy and almost thick to the mouth. Finishes a bit too sweet. The alcohol helps to thin the beer in the end. I rather enjoyed this beer."
" This is a pretty good beer in the winter, or any other time."
"Brown bottle with no date. Dark brown body topped with a fair tan head that drops down to a thin film. Leaves only faint traces of spots of lace. Aroma is slightly nutty, some roasted malts and chocolate. The taste is more of the aroma with a slick lactic sourness is the only way I can describe. Some hop bitterness on the back end. Finishes with some chocolate on the back also. Not a great beer but not bad either."
"Poured a deep Brown color, little-no head or lacing. Subtle roasted aroma, not overpowering as I expected. Very smooth for being as bitter as it is (If that makes any sense). Lingering spiceyness. Not too exciting, not much action. Very drinkable because of mellowness."
"Appears a deep ruby brown forms a nice tan bubbly head leaves behind specks of scattered lace. Aroma has a touch of chocolate with herbal grassy hop components and an overall sense of creaminess comes to me. Taste has a solid tight flavor milk chocolate, dark roasted malts herbal bitterness touch of pine bready tones in the finish winter warmer a bit under six percent seems pretty tame overall but nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied evenly carbonated smooth and creamy textured. Drinkability, pleasant winter ale once again just a bit mild for me to truely dig, dig."
"Okay, all that aside I did like this beer. Poured black with a thin sheet of head. Aroma hinted at milk chocolate. Well moderated roasted malt flavors, with bit of chocolate and a hint of sorghum. Seemed to ride the line between a mild porter and sweet stout. Reserved but very pleasant."
"On tap at Lazy Chameleon in Powell, OH. Clear dark reddish brown with a thin beige head and decent lacing. Nutmeg and malt aroma. Medium-bodied with sweet malt and caramel flavors, and some spices as well. Pretty tasty but the flavor is very short-lived. The finish is roasted malt with a bitter follow-through. Above average, however nothing really makes this beer stand out in the sea of similar winter ales."
"Picked up a bottle while visiting Madison, WI. The neck of the bottle is printed with a best by date of February 03, 2006. Pretty boring considering the style it is categorized under...definately more of a brown ale."
"drinkability: very much so"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, sugary with the nuts and chocolate lightness grazing over the tongue."
"Pours a dark brown color with some ruby highlights. Thick white foamy head disappears too quickly. Some patchy lace left on the sides of the glass. Roasty aroma, almost like coffee. Malt flavor is a touch roasty, but seems shallow. This falls off on the back end. Some bitterness along with the malt. Medium body, carbonation is low. Overall, sort of like a brown ale/porter. Good change of pace for winter warmers, but I would have liked more roasty flavors that the nose seemed to be getting at. Still, a pretty good winter brew."
"The taste is very much like the smell, toasted, coffee flavor. This beer is easy to drink and nice at temp above what the frig keeps it at. I could see having a few of these on a cold winter night, or day, or morning."
"This is not a classic, but nicely done. There is a cleanness to this that makes it lager like, which is not a bad thing."
"Pours a deep mahagony color with ruby hues. A finger of tan head falls moderately slow to a full coat over top. Very pretty brew. Nose is not as great. There is a breadyness that borders on what I associate with sock-like aromas. I also get some molasses, but I really do not like the aroma of this beer. Flavor is pretty well the same as the aroma. It has a sort of fruity-spice...almost like cherry, but not in a good way, with molasses. It just rubs me the wrong way. The feel is a very light moderate with a moderate carbonation. I am very underimpressed with this brew. It does nothing to draw me in with the nose or flavor. The feel is weak and its just not all that good."
"This pours a very dark amber. The head is minimal, but good lacing on the glass indicates ample amounts of malt used. The smell is fruity with burnt malt. The taste is rich and plummy, with a hint of pure malt and cherry. Not a lot of hop presence is felt. The mouthfeel has that characteristic Summit crispness. This is one of my favorite winter ales."
"870"
"Poured a dark amber brown. Head dissipated quickly to a thin layer with nice light lacing. Aroma was only slight, but roasted malt and coffee was detectable. The taste is full of soft chcoloate, coffee and roasted malt flavours. The higher ABV is slightly noticeable and l provides a bit of warming affect, something that I certainly enjoy and expect in a winter warmer. Mouthfeel is full and rich. A very delicious and drinkable beer, particularly on a cool winter evening."
"I've had Summit's Extra Pale Ale many times (just never been inspired to review it), and it always strikes me as especially smooth/creamy. This beer is the same way. From looking at the bottle, it doesn't look like they bottle condition their brews, but whatever they're doing to carbonate them, it's working well. This beer is a bit like a brown, a bit like a porter, and I'm a fan of both styles. Between the taste and the creamy mouthfeel, this is quite the drinkable beer. I wish it were a little less drying to the palate (though I don't mind the lack of sweetness--why is that also called ""dry""?), but the other aspects make me want more. Definitely worth a try; I got the six pack on sale at Binny's for $5.99, and I might head back to get another one to stock up."
"This one pours a dark, deep mohagany brown color with very little head. A little light barely seeps through the edges of the glass. The nose is a little weak. I notice roasted malt smells paired with maybe a slight berry smell. Nothing too strong. The taste is malty and a bit sweet with adjuncts. I've had better. The mouthfeel is also quite thin for the style. Drinkability is okay, I wont have any trouble with it, but it wont be hard to pick something else instead of this one next time."
"I could put myself on autopilot with this one. I expected maybe more richness or heartiness to the malt but 2 or 3 could go very easily after work. Not much alcohol taste to speak of."
"12 ounce bottle. Summit Winter Ale pours out a dark amber color with a dense head. Weak roasted malt aroma with earthy hops. The aroma improves as the beer warms. The flavor is very nutty, with some roasted malt and mild smoke. Not too sweet. Much more flavorful than I expected from the aroma. Earthy hops in the finish. I really enjoy the nutty, smoked flavor. Creamy mouthfeel. Good drinkability. I like that this beer isn't over spiced, like so many other Winter beers."
"The nose on the Summit Winter is nice and nutty/roasted. The taste is similar, a strong roasted bitterness in the body, though a bit thin and caramelly upfront. This is definitely not a winter warmer, but it is a good little nut brown from an underrated brewery."
"Yep. Drinkablity would be one a night. Good stuff."
"Overall, a nice offering from Summit. The flavor balance is nice and the darker notes are not overwhelming. Pick it up in the mix pack if you want to sample this one."
"Deep black in color. Quickly receding head with slight lace. Slightly spicy, gingery aroma. Full flavor, just slightly sweet with chocolate and cherry (or currant?) notes. Full mouthfeel that gently recedes. Easy drinking, not overpowering, but I think I'd stop at one. Drinking this in early November 05 from a Summit sampler pack. I think this'll be great by the fire on a winter night."
"This brew pours a solid black color. The head is small and white, and recedes quickly, leaving lacing on the edges of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee, with some ginger in the background. The taste is full of roasted malt, more so than the aroma. It is like a good porter with some spicey tones. Flavorful, yet mellow. The mouthfeel is slightly fuller than medium bodied, and there is enough carbonation to make thing interesting. Overall, this is yet another wonderful brew from Summit. This one will make a great session beer for the long winter ahead."
"Winter Ale is okay if you like your winter brews to be on the lighter side. Summit puts out a wonderful porter (Great Northern), so I'm not sure what purpose this one serves. It may be enjoyable, but it's far from outstanding."
"Another great beer from brewery bearing the name of the best known street in my state capital."
"Pours a deep brown color and has a thin tan head. The aroma is all malt, chocolate being the most prominent feature. It's taste is like a very mellow porter, with a spicy hop finish. A little more bitter than the BBC's Holiday Porter. A very nice mellow winter beer. Nothing special, but a very solid beer."
"Drinkable: Very good for a winter warmer, typically I can not do too many, as winter seasonals tend to bombard the senses with many scents and flavors. A well done if somewhat understated beer."
"Appearance is similar to a Porter, with a very dark amber color to it. A very clear roasted aroma to it which is followed by the same roasted taste: barley, chocolate, coffee etc. Great mouthfeel accompanied by a slightly bitter malty aftertaste on the way down. It would be nice if it were a little more potent, especially since it is classified as a 'Winter Warmer""."
"I would peg it as a porter, as opposed to the strong ales I think of as winter warmers. A darn nice porter at that. If it was available, I could drink quite a few of these in a winter."
"This is very close to a porter. Not an Olde Ale as expected, and if this is spiced, I'm sure not tasting it. A solid brew from a very good brewery. All their brews have impressed me, and this one is another testament to their skill."
"Thanks to garymuchow for letting me try this one"
"Dark reddish brown body was clear and porter-ish , and the head very small and fleeting. The smell was that of powdered cocoa, roasted and burnt grains, and faint grassy hops. The taste was as anticipated, with chocolate, weak coffee, dark skinned fruits, brown sugar, and roasted cracked grains. Mouthfeel was medium-thin, and the aftertaste was slightly sticky. A decent porter released for the season where it is appropriate."
"Quite drinkable. Its a fairly light beer and could definately be a nice winter session beer."
"The mouthfeel was fine and the carbonation level seemed well suited to this beer. One was enough for me and I'm glad I tried it."
"The Winter Ale, my first thought was along the lines of a watery porter. As I took time with this beer, I grew to its mild likeing. Not a heavy, over spiced, high abv. But rather a thin bodied easy winter drinker. It poured a deep mahogany with a fair tan head with good lace. The aroma was spice & pine with hints of malt. The taste also carries the same trends with more spice, raisin and chocolate malt. Over-all a nice easy winter anytime drink with a thinner than normal body, for a winter warmer."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, could you some more body on this one. However, it goes down smooth and easy and this would definetly be a good winter session brew. Worth a try!"
"I really like this brew. It's actually the one that finally got me into drinking craft beer (last winter). This one's sure too warm the soul on a howling winter night."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" of tan head over the reddish mahogany brew. Head hangs around for awhile, and lacing is excellent. Aroma is mainly dark malts. Taste is also darker malts, mainly caramel I think, with some coffee and chocolate for added enjoyment. Mouthfeel is good, albeit a bit thin-seeming. Drinkability is enhanced by the somewhat thin body, and the malty flavor keeps me wanting more. Not sure how much of a wamer during the winter this is, but I like it as a brew, and that's what counts."
"A brilliant winter drink with somewhat of a Guinness mouthfeel. Lingering roastiness will keep you warm on a winter night, and this one even survived with flying colors into the hot summer months."
"Gooey malt flavors; ripe, juicy plum; caramelized sugars; allspice; moderate bitterness. A dark, roasted ale -- certainly short of a stout or porter but lacking the extreme (though good) spiciness of some other Christmas or Winter ales."
"Thanks CRJM."
"Drinkability is very, love to get this one of draught."
"Pours a dark brick-red with a creamy off-white head. Not much going on with the nose; caramel, some vanilla, trace elements, slight hops--it's hard to tell. Taste starts with toasty caramel malts with slight fruitiness. Hops are minimal but do the job. I wouldn't mind it if Summit beefed this up a touch; it might really help it gain some complexity. Creamy, medium bodied, and not a bad session winter ale."
"Looks darker than I remembered it. Almost looks like a stout, with it's black opacity. This is a very heavily spiced beer, which makes me wonder why it isn't in the Herbed/Spiced beer category. It tastes strongly of cinnamon and nutmeg, in fact, they pretty much dominate this beer. Covers up any traces of alcohol or hops (I don't know if that is a good thing). Not a beer to session, would make you feel sick to your stomache in no time. It would be good on a cold winter night, though."
"Overall: I really enjoyed the warming Scotch Whisky-like alcoholic malts and the earthy organic peat malt feel in the ending that this Winter Ale has. Very nice. Lovers of Single Malt Whisky should try this one. Cheers Joe!"
"Poured darkish brown with red hues and a moderate tan head. Not quite opaque, but very dark in the glass. Really very little aroma at all -- neither good nor bad, just -- not there. A substantial mouthfeel with a smooth and oddly delicate spicy taste makes up for the lack of aroma, though. Nicely carbonated, this is an easy drinking winter brew that I found friendly even if I didn't fall in love with it."
"Clear dark reddish-amber color, has a nice thick off white head that leaves some lace in my glass. Nutty caramel aromas. Bready chocolate-caramel flavors, medium body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, a decent winter brew, but nothing to write home about."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for the sample."
"Tastes of orange and piney hops, with a chalky aftertaste. I'm not quite sure what it is, but something didn't quite fit together in this beer. The beer is rather thin, and perhaps I was expecting something else from a winter/old ale (and something unknown that I can't quite describe)."
"Smell roasty and sweet, quiet coffee and heavy caramel. Taste is toasted, slightly sweet at first, then bitter with hints of chocolate (but always mellow, never rich) - followed by a nice coffee aftertaste that lingers but isn't overpowering. Very smooth, not overly thick. toasted, but not all that bitter."
"Ah winter in Minnesota. Cold weather, black ice, snow and more cold weather. Luckily we have some solidly enjoyable winter brews available and Summit Winter Ale is no exception. Color is dark and inviting with a nice creamy head with acceptable retention. Smell is of roasty malt with a touch sweetness. Taste is an enjoyable slight spicyness on an ample bed of malt. Mouthfeel is full but not overt. A very drinkable beer for winter and I look forward to it each year."
"Pours a clear, ruby-tinted mahogany beneath a short lid of creamy off white foam that drops shortly but maintains a wide collar, whispy surface covering, and leaves some craggy streaks and spots of lace with each sip. The nose is limited but clean; and it offers a touch of roastiness above some mild, grainy malt. The body is decidedly medium and it's very fine, restrained carbonation leaves it creamy and smooth in the mouth. In fact, it's very similar to a engine-pulled cask ale or a nitro-pour. It really needs to warm a bit before its flavors come out, but when they do some dark caramel with an almost burnt-sugar edge and some subtle chocolatey notes join with its mild roastiness in the flavor. A touch of fruitiness and some sublime spice lend a bit of additional character; and its firm bitterness also combines with its roastiness to leave it dry in the finish. Quite interesting. It's very much like a blend of a toned-down stout and some richly malty, caramelish ale. Very nice!"
"taste really isn't that great. don't get me wrong it's good. it tastes like quality, but nothing really stands out. like the other winter ales i have had this season it is mild and drinkable but lacks character. this might be the last winter ale i'll buy."
"I would write the smell off as an anomoly but I had the same impression last year. Must not be that bad; I bought it again."
"Dark mahogany hue with shinny ruby highlights around the edges of the pint glass. Light brunette head, served about a finger in height, very sturdy retention. A good amount of lacing was produced, even if it was unorganized, as I sipped away. To the eye, it is a dark, mysterious looking beverage. Appealing. The nose is very pleasant with dark yet restrained fruits upfront, quickly followed by light butterscotch and chocolate, straightforward maltiness. Fairly good potency sparks the invitation. The depth on the tongue is solid with a pleasant chocolate maltiness found up-front and then a delicious hoppy bitterness is introduced in the middle (yummy!). The finish has a lovely buttery English Old Ale twist on the end. The palate is respectable and very enjoyable to quaff, however it failed to blow me away. The carbonation is low, which would work better if the body were a little fuller. Still worth trying if you have not, Ill gladly drink it again. This was my first Nebraska bought Summit product!"
"Drinkability: Not a favorite of mine. Not enough sweet malt for a winter brew, IMO. Won't try again."
"Nice deep dark cherrywood color with a deep ruby red glow, head starts about a finger high of dark tannish color, fades fast to a lighter almost ivory colored skim and lace which is in stringy sheets. Aroma is mild of light roasted coffee or old coffee lightly burnt-like roasted malts, notes of dry hops, dried wood, and plastic-like ethonal/alcohol notes. Taste is mild and plain with light notes of burnt roasted malts, a touch of old coffee and nutty dryness mixes over the top and in the finish. Has some woodish, dry hop notes. Nothing stands out but the dryness, which is a bit uneven and not all that good as it goes down. Feel is a bit thin with a drying texture midway through to the finish which coats the mouth and tongue with a dry spongy, spiked, lightly harsh cotton mouth. A slightly weak, boring, and a pretty unpleasant glass of beer. Smooth this out, get rid of the harsh dryness and texture and i might be interested in it again. Was hoping they changed this one much like the O-fest. But now I remember why I always skip by this one every year. I'll stick with the porter."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a deep copper color with red highlights, a smallish head, but plenty of lace. Aroma is muted, with a slightly sweet scent. Taste is weak malt, thin and watery, with not much of an aftertaste. Still not a bad tasting beer. This is a good session beer, due to its mildness."
"Cheers to Budgood 1 for the Sample!"
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for this one."
"This ends up being a pretty good beer. A special thanks for felonious for making it possible."
"The beer pours an enormously deep garnet color; the head is medial in size, creamy in texture, the color a light tan, as it evanesces the lace forms a covering sheet upon the glass. Malt dominates the lightly sweet nose, fresh and clean to the senses, with the start nicely malt and somewhat sweet, top middling in feel. Finish has a pertinent acidity, the hops deliberate in their spiciness, very dry lingering aftertaste. Quite a nice drinkable beer from a brewery that is new to me, and my thanks goes to feloniousmonk for this bottle and several other all waiting in the fridge to be sampled, my friend, this beer is gladly quaffed in your honor."
" Pours very appealing dark brown in color with a small tan head. The sweet mild aroma of caramel and malts seems ordinary for this winter ale. Butterscotch and chocolate just begins to describe the malt presence here. This is a nice brew but it lacks something to spice up the malts. Thanks Feloniousmonk for my first taste of a Summit brew, i look forward to more of Summit Brewing offerings."
"Pretty dark overall with some amber colors showing through the light. Pretty malty, good mix of flavors, hardly noticeable taste of hopps. . The head was off white, but disappeared pretty quickly. Not my favorite that ive had in a while, but deffinately worth checking out."
"Cheers"
"Deep ruby hue with brilliant clarity evident when held to light. Light beige, well retained, uniform, one fingered head manages loose lace. Dark caramel, raisiny fruitiness, w/ mellow chocolate and mild butterscotch in aroma. Understated floral hop nose, with a whiff of earthiness as well. Tame, yet quite pleasant aromawise. Cocoa laced sweetness upfront in flavor yields to drying notes of biscuit and moderate hop bitterness. Clean, rounded dark caramel with a roasted edge emerge mid palate along with a lightly spicy hop flavor. Subdued hints of molasses complement both caramel malt derived and residual unfermented sweetness. Lightly bodied, with a passably smooth, lightly dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes slightly dry, with suggestions of anise and baker's chocolate. For such a light beer, this brew packs a wallop of flavor. It's certainly not a strong ale, but a damn tasty brew that I could drink all night. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the bottle."
"Overall an ok ale but I think there are better and bolder versions of winter ale out there. Perhaps this would make a nice cross over or first time beer for someone having the style for the first time."
"Notes. Yet another fine offering, not the best, from Summit Brewing Company."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin but persistent head that leaves behind some lace. Sweet aroma of caramel, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Flavor was dominated by sweet malt, with some backing spices... nutmeg was quite noticeable. Has a very viscous body, which, combined with the sweetness, lowers the drinkability. Not one of the best seasonal offerings, but a decent winter brew."
"Spicy and warm, but still mellow and soothing. Seems to lack an ""oomph "" from years ago, or maybe my tongue has tempered."
"A dark brown, mahogany color with a tan head. Aroma is of a heavily malted beer. This beer is slightly big and heavy with the roatsed malts dominating the flavor up front. Slight alcohol warming effect is noted. Hops balance the beer and keep the finish fairly neutral until the hop bitterness and alcohol really show themselves in the very end. Finish slightly effects the drinkability, but still good overall. A solid winter ale with a big malt character."
"Cheers!"
"Pours an intriguing dark ruby-brown color with shallow but tight head that dissipates almost immediately other than at the edges. Nose is a mix of alcohol warmth and a roasted, spicy scent. Taste is dominated by a mix of sweetness and spicy alcohol warmth, both of which don't persist as long as one would like. Mouthfeel is a bit oily, but that's not uncommon in this sort of beer. Drinkability, on the other hand, is a bit better than one might expect."
"Pours to a mahogany color, with a light-brown head that lasts. The nose is of roasted malt. Flavors are toasted malt, with hints of chocolate. There is also a spiciness to the flavor as well. It is a rich beer that is light-medium in body, with light carbonation, and a slight alcoholic warmth. Overall, it is a well balanced beer."
"Deep clear dark reddish brown, 1/4 inch pillow floats on top. Sweet malt aroma, spiked with a little cinnamon impression. Thick malty mouthfeel, starts heavy with a little honey/maple-like flavor, takes an upward kick into an orange pekoe, and finishes with a paprika-like hop pepperiness. Didn't notice a caramel or chocolate sensation. Body is nice, seems to me that Summit does more interesting things with its malt bill on other beers. Balance is good. Decent, not groundbreaking -- I might be in a minority but this brew has never been a huge favorite for me."
"Deep ruby/near black in color with a thin, quickly dissipating head.  The aroma was chocolate with slight roasted malt.  The initial chocolate flavor was replaced by roasty aftertones towards the end.  The mouthfeel was smooth as velvet on the tongue and the flavor lasted forever.  Another excellent offering from the folks at Summit."
"I can't believe it. I just bought a 6-pack last night (August 5th) for $2.49. NEVER HAD A BETTER DEAL IN MY LIFE! This has kept very well. As I was watching the thunderstorms pass I enjoyed 2 bottles - and I must say REALLY enjoyed! I was surprised at how dark and beautifully it poured. A firm, but not long-lasting creamy caramel head. A complex, malty aroma that teased me with subtle wiffs of everything I was about to taste. Very smooth taste. A flavor of chocolate, a bit of coffee roast and spice notes made this very enjoyable. It had a smooth feel around my mouth and tickled with the roasted spice hints on the way down. Very drinkable -I will savor the last 4 bottles, and hope that last 6 pack I saw  at the store will still be there in a few days!"
"Very dark burgandy/mohagony hue.  Some very nice roasted notes in this brew.  A warming presence is also noticed.  Chocolate notes accent this malty brew."
"Still, this beer makes you embrace the cold months of the year."
"Additional Note..I am readjusting this rating after enjoying many this winter...It is still outstanding and my comments stand but not a ""5""
