Aroma is caramel & dark bready malt, with spice notes of cinnamon, ginger & maybe (?) nutmeg; hints of cherry, prune, roasted nuts & a faint sourness. Taste is dark malt bready & spice heavy to cinnamon & ginger with sweet caramel, dark tart cherry & prune/plums, finishes with orange & herbal hops producing an earthy note giving way to a caramel, spice & lightly roasted, bitter aftertaste.

3.95,7.6,4,4.5,3.75,4.25,3.5,"For some reason when I picked up a 6 pack of Anchor at the ungodly price of $13.99 I assumed the Anchor Christmas Ale was a barleywine or other strong dark type beer.  Well, obviously I was thinking of a different annual wintertime beer.  This one pours very dark brown in my chalice and has a wicked, funky, fruity aroma.  I'm getting candied prunes, cinnamon, ginger, and some fruits and spices that remind me of rich fruitcake but I'm embarrassed to admit I can't identify.  Scores bonus points on smell simply on account of intrigue.  Very creamy mouthfeel (temperature is off-cool).  Flavor matches the aroma, really, this is like drinking a fruitcake.  I suppose that's a very reasonable match for the Winter Warmer genre.  Finish is not at all dry, neither unpleasant nor sweet, but not dry either.  Just un-crisp.  Overall, I'm very happy to have tried and consumed this.  But I'm not sure that enjoyment is enough to justify the other 5 bottles I purchased.","hreb","Dec 30, 2014"

This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, fairly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these around the holidays.  What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both good and i thought the balance in the taste and the mouthfeel were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was aroma, it wasn't bad, it was just unbalanced and a little boring.  I would buy this beer again, I wouldn't mind getting another bottle or two before they are all gone and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a balanced Winter Warmer, I think it fits the style nicely.  All in all I thought this was a solid Winter Warmer, it didn't really impress more or anything, but it did live up to being a nice Winter Warmer.  It's not my favorite Anchor beer and I would say it's above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a solid beer, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Dec 18, 2014"

I would prefer a higher ABV winter warmer style ale, but if you want a sessionable rendition, this might work for you. Spices are often thrown around for holiday beers and it just doesn't work. This beer breaks the mold and lets them really shine. I think this year's celebration was better than the 2013.","youngs11","Dec 18, 2014"

Aromas of holiday spice, burnt crust, earth and toffee.  Taste brings holiday spices up front, with toffee and burnt caramel hit mid palate, the spice fades and gives way to a burnt toast like flavor with some mild hop presence on the finish.  The taste leaves an odd aftertaste of char and mushroom, I think, that I don't care for.  Top end of thin body, sharp carbonation and a semi dry finish.

The color is a mix of deep ruby red and dark color...  A light to moderate bit of quick paced carbonation streaks can be seen towards the top of the glass...  A spot on aroma for the style...  Light holiday space...  Caramel...  Toffee...  Rich bready malt...  The flavor profile isn't quite what I expected...  Much of the malty goodness disappears and is replaced by a sturdy but unremarkable profile...  Some light piney notes...  Lots of earthy and woody notes...  Some faint medicinal notes...  Slightly smokey as well...  In interesting  mix of flavors, but not quite sure they work well together...  On the lighter side of medium bodied...  Slightly chalky texture...  Light yet crisp carbonation...  I'm a huge fan of this annual offering, but this one misses the mark for me...  I've had the majority of these offerings since becoming a BA some ten years ago and unfortunately, this may be one of, if not, my least favorite...  But all that said, it's still a drinkable beer and still fits the season nicely...","philbe311","Dec 15, 2014"

Aromas of caramel, molasses, chocolate, roasted notes, cinnamon, nutmeg, cream highlights, hints of wood spice, and some subtle pine pitch. Flavors are robust and rich forward, with a blast of cocoa nibs, toffee, caramel, and molasses, all on a roasted, slightly charred backbone. Spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, and clove, as well as some evergreen and resinous notes. Subtle cream and vanilla highlights lighten things up a bit. The beer has a smooth, light body, with an underlying bitter roast character throughout, and well into the aftertaste. Tangy sweet combo in the aftertaste, with all the richly sweet flavors hanging around. The finish is smooth, with a roasted sweet linger. Nice job this year.","GarthDanielson","Nov 23, 2014"

2.25,-38.7,,,,,,"Excited to try this year's as I always look forward to the new release. Dark toffee and dried fruit, medium-thin mouthfeel with a little herbal character... what is going on with the fnish/aftertaste? Wet, musty soil? Seriously, something unpleasant. Started off familiar, but I reluctantly finished the bottle. Will try again to re-review, but disappointed.","danxbar","Nov 06, 2014"
