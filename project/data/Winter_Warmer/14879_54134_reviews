"If you are not into spiced beers, stop reading now. This Is not the beer for you. If, however, you enjoy a nicely sweet holiday ale with a high enough ABV to warm you on a cold night, this is a good one. I poured this into a standard pint glass. The fizzy beige head dissipated quickly, leaving a trace of foam atop the dark reddish brown body. Cinnamon and ginger dominated the taste, leaving a very pleasant sweetness behind. It had a rich, semi-thick mouthfeel. This functions nicely as a dessert beer, or as an evening sipper. I'm planning on picking up a couple more of these."

"Very deep red color without any transparency. Smell is of a strong cinnamon with a sweetness to it. Upfront taste is cinnamon with an aftertaste of slight Apple mixed in. The smell makes it seem as if it'd be overpowering but it is balanced nicely. Not normally my type of beer but definitely enjoyable."

"This is normally NOT my kind of beer. I don't like gingerbread cookies or cinnamon in my beer...but this was just the right amount of both. It was fantastic, and I would gladly order it again!"

"had on tap, was good beer but spices were a bit much for me."

"Pours a dark red with a thin off white head, actually very Holiday. Aroma is sweet cinnamon, nutmeg, reminds me of a sweet spiced Christmas fruit cake. Taste same as aroma with some mild hops bitterness. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. Finishes with sweet cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet spices of fruit cake, and maybe some brown sugar and a bit of nutty flavor on the end as it warms up. Overall fairly good drink"

"I am not a fan of any spiced beer no matter the occasion and sadly this beer falls dead square in that category. The immediate aftertaste is a mouthful of cinnamon that masks everything else. Its a gimmicky beer and that's just not for me. There are any number of other REALLY good beers on tap at Hoppin Frog that deserve your attention. This is not one of them."

"i am usually one to drink very seasonally. i try to at least, makes me feel more in tune with my surroundings and with nature and generally keeps me on an even keel. drinking a strong christmas ale in late june is not something that usually happens, but a friend broke out this bottle with a little age on it, and wow, if ever there is a holiday ale versatile enough to work in hot summer weather, its this one. so much fresh ginger on the nose and late palate, that even the cinnamon and honey spice and sweet complex on it doesnt interfere, weigh it down, or make it only worth drinking when the snow flies. i found it almost refreshing, and through its clear amber body, i was amazed how much and how vibrantly the ginger came through. first class all the way, with just enough spicing to make me look forward to the holidays without making me overlook the present. carbonation is really aggressive, and the alcohol is well hidden. time has done this well no doubt, its so smoothed out texture wise as well, its just plush and round and surprisingly not real sweet. almost reminds me of the tropics in this weather, and i have to say, i was shocked how much i really got off on this, given the season. as good as any beer from hoppin frog, i hope to be able to procure some more of this around holiday time. the ginger makes it like not other beer for that season, at least not this pleasantly. awesome drink."

"This is an excellent winter warmer! The beer smells and especially tastes like Christmas. There's a great amount of spice here--some cinnamon, peppermint, pepper, and it's equally spicy and sweet. It's darker in color than your average winter warmer, and it does finish somewhat sticky, but the high ABV is masked pretty well. This is definitely a beer to sip, but it's still more than drinkable during the winter months and does not shy away from flavor while also not going overboard with the spices."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage. Pours lightly cloudy dark ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, apple, brown sugar, cinnamon, clove, caramel, gingerbread, toast, nutmeg, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, apple, brown sugar, cinnamon, toast, nutmeg, caramel, gingerbread, clove, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, apple, brown sugar, cinnamon, toast, molasses, gingerbread, nutmeg, clove, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of malt and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial winter warmer. All around great balance and complexity of malt and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall-4.5- I think this beer is great for the style. LOADS of flavor. Not in a bad way, its just like...an ""Imperial Winter Warmer"" which is cool. Most companies put out these super mild, over spiced/under malted winter warmers so its cool to have a company go all out with one. However, with all that being said, this one bomber is more than enough. I think a single pint of this sweet gingerbread molasses strong brew around the holiday season would hit the spot perfectly. I'll definitely be grabbing another one this winter."

"I have to thank my friend Rick for buying this beer for me in a bar near Akron, Ohio, especially since we didn't know it was $15.00 for a tap beer (the few Hoppin' Frog bombers I find in Colorado also cost around this price-point!). Anyway, it was a fine tasting Xmas ale although there are others out there that I find more evenly balanced (i.e., Great Lakes ""Winter Ale"" and Anchor Steam ""Christmas Ale"") and way less expensive. Bottom-line: it's a fine tasting beer but not necessarily worth the money."
""
"Pours dark reddish orange with small head. Smells like cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger. Smells like Christmas time. Heavy nutmeg and cinnamon flavor. Cinnamon last a while on the palate. Smooth base beer, but can't taste much of it through all the spice. Slight hint of booze and alcohol warmth. Definitely a nice winter ale if you are in the mood for sweet with the spice rack thrown in. Hits what it is going for, but really just fun for the holidays. Otherwise not my thing."

"Overall- A really nice beer. Definitely glad I bought this one; very flavorful and a great Christmas sipper. I plan on getting this one next Winter. This is one of, if not my favorite, beer quite frankly. And I especially enjoyed cracking this one (and many others) open with my friend on Christmas night. Highly recommended."
"O - The aroma and flavor of this beer are huge. I loved the smell, but the cinnamon flavor was almost overwhelming."
"Overall, I haven't had anything less than exceptional from Hoppin' Frog, and their Christmas Ale is no exception. Truly delicious."
"O: Let this one warm up a bit as it does improve as the temperature rises. Overall, though it reminds me a bit of a pumpkin beer w/o the pumpkin, it's a pleasant beer that reminds me of all of the spiced candles we've been burning."
""
""
"O- as a general rule, I hate winter warmers, but this pretty solid. Definitely worth a try, as are most of Hoppin Frog's beers"
"O: A very rich sipping beer for Christmas; I think they've captured the holiday spirit well in this potent seasonal brew."
"Another amazing Winter Warmer from Ohio here. Wonderful!"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is heavy-medium bodied. Carbonation is laid back. Doesn't coat the mouth, slightly dry on the finish."

"O – I like this beer. I can see some not liking it as its spicy but the flavors are ones I totally dig. Found this years Christmas Eve beer. Enjoy."
""

"O: I probably won't buy it again, especially considering the price, but I'm glad I tried it. Not bad."

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice dark amber with a thin dirty white head. Head disappeared quickly, but left a small ring that clung nicely. Aroma was exactly as described. Cinammon with some ginger smell, slightly on the sweet side. Very much a winter smell. Flavor was spicy, but yet still pleasant. A bit of sweetness, and the aforementioned spices were nicely balanced. The cinnamon was up front, with a bit of ginger to finish the sip. Coated nicely in the mouth, went down as it should. Overall an outstanding beer. A little tweak in the flavor would help, but minor issues."
""
"A good idea that went overboard on the spices."
""
""
"A Coca Cola colored brew with a decent light tan colored head and decent lacing. The aroma is clearly a Christmas scent with gingerbread peppermint and evergreen malt. Real likeable. The flavor delivers more of the same with lots of medicinal malt like Moxie with more evergreen and cinnamon spice holiday festivity going on. This is medium-plus bodied with very full but tiny carbonation to provide a stout but luscious feel. Not something I would generally drink in mass quantities but a great holiday brew to really deliver the Christmas spirit. Very nice!"
""
"O - for a winter warmer, this is a very good beer. In the right setting, I love this kind of beer. Definitely not an every day beer, but for a cold winter night, this is an excellent companion."
""
""
"I don't think I've ever had a beer where the spices are so pronounced. I can very easily taste all three spices listed on the bottle which include cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg and that hasn't happened before. For me the spices are enough so I don't need the extra malty sweetness, yet it is fitting being a holiday beer. I would by this again."
"The sweetness of this beer might turn some people off. I definitely couldn't drink it all the time. This is a rare holiday indulgence that I will seek out again next year."
""
"First mediocre beer from HF. Had the BA version, which was well balanced, with the barrel-aging cutting down the spices. Can't recommend this version, though."
""
"Pours a crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a huge fluffy tan head that slowly recedes. Smells of cinnamon and nutmeg mostly. Quite heavy spicy aroma obliterates any beer smells from my perception. Taste has a bit of a caramel sweet malt flavor upfront before the gingerbread house flavor takes over and ruins this beer. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spice laden mouthfeel. I won't mince words here, this beer is horrible. Its over spiced and I couldn't finish my glass."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass a nice deep garnet color with well defined half finger off white head atop,good richness and definition to the color.Aromas of cinnamon and clove mainly,I could tell right away this was gonna be a more heavily spiced winter warmer.Heavy cinnamon,clove,and nutmeg on the palate,not crazy sweet just spiced to the hilt,some faint toastiness underneath the spice does come thru after awhile as well some alcohol sweetness.Much like their pumpkin ale the winter warmer is too spiced up,I do like this better than the pumpkin beer but it's still not great by any means."

"After having DORIS, which was one of my favorite beers ever, I was excited to try the rest of their line-up and selected this one. Simply awful."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a crystal red wine glass- pours a dark amber color with next to no head and zero retention. The smell is probably the best part of this brew- very clearly defined cinnamon and nutmeg that, as a previous reviewer stated, hints at a pumpkin ale. The taste is good but not exceptional- the cinnamon and nutmeg come through but are overtaken by the malt flavored and finally by the alcohol. Very little carbonation that appears on the back of the tongue- barely enough to keep it refreshing by my account. Tastes to me almost like a lager because of the malt profile and the lack of carbonation. A good one to try but not a beer I would buy again. From Ohio great lakes' Christmas ale is a safer bet."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a nice take on a winter warmer style beer but the spices could have been toned down slightly. Aroma- wise they were quite inviting, but dominated the palate and the flavor profile a little too much for me in the end. There are better examples for lesser $ points so I would recommend looking elsewhere."
"This is like a pumpkin ale without the pumpkin; well-spiced Christmas ale"
"Clocking in this beer's 100th review. Well characterized as a winter warmer, this is a highly spiced beer evoking Christmas pie and cookies. Big malt body, teetering on a bit syrupy. Nutmeg is prominent, almost overwhelming, with a hint of cinnimon lurking in the spice shadow. Nutmeg is heavy-handed, dominating everything, including a the caramel and sorghum in the background. An interesting beer, but quickly tiresome."
"O- save your 7 bucks and try 3 or 4 other xmas beers for the same price..anchor, hibernation, 12 dogs(thirstydog)<--my pick of the year so far for xmas beers."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a good winter beer. Warms you up as you drink it. I would have another."
"Pours a murky chestnut red with a crusty looking tan head and large bubbles. Huge spices in the nose, tons of cinnamon and nutmeg, pumpkin pie like. Some sugary malt, maybe a touch of berry sweetness and a metallic twang in the back. Flavor is much of the same, overly spiced and messy malts with an off twang underneath and notes of alcohol in the finish. Full bodied, syrupy, high carbonation."
"Last year I had this beer and it tasted different. There was more cinnamon and it didn't smell like apples. I prefer the smell of this years beer, and the taste of last years beer."
"Frosted Frog nails the flavor of Christmas, but because of its shere sweetness, one-dimensionality, and low complexity I'm happy to share this 22oz bottle with a quatro of friends to save for palate fatigue."
"its good. but i think it might bee too sweet, not just for me, but i think its a little bit to a fault. its certainly not sessionable, nor can i see myself drinking more than one in a sitting."
""
"Overall - As with hoppin frog brews, tons of flavor, unique and unforgetable. No other beer quite tastes like this, its liquid fruit cake really. Was fun to drink and will have again next christmas!"
""
""
""
"D - A winter seasonal without any doubt... A warm and inviting brew dominated by spices... A solid offering and one I wouldn't turn down if offered next holiday season, but not one a I must have next year either... Solid, but a bit one dimensional... The luxurious mouth feel is the highlight..."
""
"O: I love this beer. Yes, it's an extremely spicy winter warmer, but I think they hit the style dead on in some parts. If it was a little more malt forward to balanced it out, it would be amazing. Easy to drink, find, and not too badly priced. I would recommend for the holidays and probably drink 1-2 per sitting."
""
"I won't have this beer again or recommend this beer to anyone."
"The mouthfeel isn't bad, smooth and chewy with ample carbonation in a medium body but just a bit too much bite."
""
""
"O: An interesting, solidly made, drinkable beer."
"O: Wow, was not expecting this! Hoppin' Frog has struck gold with this beer. As a HUGE WW fan and of spiced beer in general, this brew is GREAT! Not much else to say besides to BUY it...if you can find it:)"
"Pours a caramel brown color, slightly hazy. Aroma of cinnamon spice and brown sugar sweetness. In the taste, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and nutty malts. A touch of caramel and light bitterness. Chewey medium to full bodied feel, with the alcohol well hidden. Overall, a nice little winter warmer."
""
""
""
"We did a large christmas and winter beer tasting panel and this was one of the many that we tried. Most of the beers we tried we solid including this one that the panel liked."
"Tastes just like it smells. However things get a bit cloying and some potpourri like flavors come through on the finish. Again like a liquid cookie. Nice creamy middle, just missing with that potpourri aroma."
""
""
""
"Given the fact that 22oz is enough, and that it is quite spicy, tough to say this is an amazing beer I'd want to drink all of the time. However, if you see it for a reasonable price, totally worth checking out if you like this style."

"Pours a dark brown w/ crimson highlights when held to the light. You can manage to peek out the other side, but just barely. Fairly clear from what I'd expect. Very little lacing at all on the side of my snifter, and just a sliver of a head to start. Nose is pleasantly festive, with nutmeg, cinnamon, and some ginger in there too. I'm not getting much malt in the nose. Wow.... Spice explosion on my first sip. Holy cow that's strong. Big time nutmeg- bigger cinnamon and a hint of ginger and malt. It's not bad, it's just a tad bit over the top for me. I'd also like to see a little more malt presence in the taste. Feel is medium, w/ high carbonation and a sweet cloying finish. Somebody needs to take the edge off this beer.. about 25%. All in all, if you don't like heavy spices- you won't like this beer. I thought it was good, but I probably won't look for it again. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability – I could drink this all winter long. The brown sugar stays in your mouth for quite some time without becoming overpowering. Exceptionally well-balanced. I enjoyed this beer a lot and will surely pick up a few more before winter is over."
"Medium bodied with a nice mix of seasonal spice, sweet malt alcohol, licorice and slight medicinal syrup.  Blast of autumnal and winter spice up front with lots of cinnamon, brown sugar, nutmeg, vailla, clove, pumpkin and cardomam.  Kind of earthy with some sweet makt underneath.  Mostly caramel with hints of licorice, peppermint and dark fruit, especially dark cherry.  Alcohol heat in the finish but abv decently masked.  A bit heavy in the spice and medicinal flavors.  Kind of smells and tastes like potpourri."
"D: This was a lot like just drinking mulled cider, without much to distinguish it as beer. Still enjoyable scent and taste, and well hidden alcohol. The body was a bit weak, but it was easy enough to drink. Nice winter brew (or for Christmas in July)."
"Spicy with sage, cardamom, light fruits, chamomile, ham, juniper, cinnamon, Karo syrup, fizz, paper, edible flowers and leaves. Interesting! I'd like to try this again sometime and see if anything has changed with the recipe, current or otherwise. Word, word, word."
"Nice aroma of caramel malts, hints of spice and touches of light herbal hops. Not a heavy aroma, but defintley on the winter tone with nice spice notes. Smooth, creamy, medium bodied ale with a nice carbonation really let the flavors pop. Intresting mix again of light caramel malts, hints of cinnamon and nutmeg and a touch of light grain. A smooth, deleicate finish left me looking for another sip as the alcohol was all but absent from the flavor."
"o - Overall a nice winter warmer from Hoppin' Frog. I really enjoyed the nose, but the taste wasn't quite as good, and it was a bit too carbonated. Would give another shot."
"Poured into my New Belgium snifter. No head to speak of, even with an aggressive pour. It's amber in color with good clarity. Spice slaps you in the face as soon as you raise the glass. Wow, pretty heavy on the cinnamon & ginger. The spices follow into the taste, overpowering any hops bitterness, and only moderately detectable maltiness. This has a medium mouthfeel, and though it's heavy on the spices, it doesn't linger. I like the spice in my winter warmers to complement the backbone of the beer, not become it. Way too heavy on the spices to give this one a high grade, because even as the beer warmed, the spices became even more pronounced. Most of the robust dark beers I normally drink get better as they warm, but not this one unfortunately."
"D-Really over-spiced in my opinion; hard to get down the first pint I poured, this could be a drain-pour."
"Drinkability: It's definitely not for everybody, even I'm not exactly sure what to think of it. An honest appreciation for a bold Christmastime spice character, in much the same way Southern Tier Pumking is heavy on the pumpkin and spice flavor, is an absolute must. No subtlety, no delicacy here."
"D: I actually enjoyed this . I drank the entire bomber over a couple hours during a family Christmas gathering and it certainly fit the bill."
"D: The alcohol and sweetness make this one a sipper, but it's an enjoyable one. Might look to pick this up again next Christmas season."
"D: split a bomber bottle"
"D: Very drinkable and smooth but the elevated 8.6 ABV would definitly prohibit drinking many."
"D- No more than 1 with all those spices but it's fun none-the-less"
"Picked up a bottle after Christmas weekend by chance at a local wine/beer store. This winter warmer is among one of my favorite ""festive"" beer where the essence of Christmas is captured in this very bottle - perfectly blended spices compliment Frosted Frog's rich malt flavors, creating the ultimate Christmas experience. There is plenty of cinnamon with hints of cloves and nutmeg, as well as subtle malty and woody undertones. It comes out of the bottle a dark, mostly transparent reddish mahogany with a decent light tan head. Flavor is malty with a firm overtone of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg - and maybe some horehound as well. There is a bit of sharp candy sweetness and just a whisper of raw wood. Texture is sharp, crisp and fizzy, leaving behind a tingly, spicy finish."
"Aroma has a strong and pleasant spicy undertone, quite different from any other beer I have sampled, even other winter warmers and spiced ales. There is plenty of cinnamon with hints of cloves and nutmeg, as well as subtle malty and woody undertones. It comes out of the bottle a dark, mostly transparent reddish mahogany with a decent light tan head. Flavor is malty with a firm overtone of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg - and maybe some horehound as well. There is a bit of sharp candy sweetness and just a whisper of raw wood. Texture is sharp, crisp and fizzy, leaving behind a tingly, spicy finish. Happy Holidays!"
"D: I'm not saying that this beer should be avoided, but it's definitely not my style. If they would hold back a couple pounds on the spices I think it would compete with the other top Christmas ales. If you really enjoy the spices that are aforementioned then by all means get this beer."
"D- a sipper and the strong flavor means it would be best in small quantities, but definitely worthy."
"Overall: had a hard time finishing the glass but glad I got to try this. Would be perfect as a 4oz taster rather than a 12oz glass."
"I can see where they were going with the different flavors here, but unfortunately the combo of a ridiculously heavy spice profile and overall high alcohol content rendered this a pretty much undrinkable mess. A rare drain pour for me."
"D- Holy smokes! This beer is about as Christmas as beers gets. I like it ok, but I couldn't even try to drink more than one of these."
"Drinkability - For sure a one and done. Pretty intense with spices and a bit overdone to be honest."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Frosted frog comes into the glass looking bright brown hazy red with a nice firm cap of brown/tan foam that left small notches. Good retention. Frosty has a nose on it, this one is a pungent sonofabitch. Smell is christmas cheer with cinnamon, candi canes, ginger, nutmeg and just a bunch of spice. Frosted travels up the nostrils. Taste takes a step back from that. Nice amounts of cinnamon clash with the spices leaving a warming effect on the tounge, they dancin. Brown suga and some candy apple. Cant taste the booze under the mound of additions in this one. Feel is a bold medium with some staying power on the mouth. Sweet, spicy and not cloying or approaching it, very approachable. Not spritzy, very smooth and a coater on the tounge. I drank half a bottle and wanted more. A sipper or a gulper, you decide."
"D- this is one hell of a winter warmer. The spice is extremely bold in the nose but not as heavy in the taste. One I'm glad I tried and one ill try again with people on a special occasion when it fits the bill."
"Rather drinkable, I can't wait to try their barrel aged Christmas ale."
"Avoid this EPIC FAILURE at all costs."
"Overall - This is an abysmal attempt at a beer. If you want your taste-buds to take a cinnamon beating, and the idea of liquid red-hots beer excites you, then give this a shot. Otherwise, try any other half-way decent winter warmer that isn't spices just for the sake of spices."
"Then comes the taste. Are you kidding me? Half a jar of cinnamon into some lightly-sweetened water. Carbonate it up a bit and you've got Frosted Frog! Wow, this is not a good-tasting beer. I suppose aside from the cinnamon there's also a bit of light spruce character. Either way, this is just a cinnamon bomb and basically unpalatable. Son of a lady frog does this taste stay with me...I really can't get it out of my mouth. I don't even know if a shot of gin would work at this point. Mouthfeel? Spice. Cinnamon. Yuck. I'd drainpour the rest of this bottle if Amy didn't insist on drinking it all."
"Pours a hazy deep reddish to amber color with a small off white head. In the aroma, clove, licorice, anise, cinnamon, and ginger. In the taste, big dry cinnamon, then a mixture of spices, and ends with a dry clove taste. A cinnamon/ spice bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry cinnamon and clove aftertaste. Big spice, but nice. I bet this would age nicely, as well as, I would love to find the barrel aged version."
"D- This is a good brew overall-and pretty much what I think of when I think ""winter warmer"" the spices dominate and there is a slight warmth. This reminds me of a spiced scotch ale. Very good overall."
"22oz bottle from Ale Yeah! in Decatur. Pours a dark orange with a somewhat short head. Redolant of spices in the nose. Nice cinammon, ginger, and lesser nutmeg aromas. Slightly sweet in the mouth, with bubblegum to start, followed by more spice- particularly ginger, with some cinnamon and nutmege in equal parts, and a finish that has more maltiness. Quite nice for the winter. Smooth, slightly sweet, and a bit nutty on the finish. I enjoyed this."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body is medium. The carbonation is low and at times seems flat. The beer isnt a drain pour but not sure I would repeat this beer again. Given the choice between this beer or Anchor Steam Christmas I am rolling with Anchor Steam."
"D: Very heavy on the spices; if you like that, you'll like this beer, but it is an acquired taste."
"Poured a Bright Amber/Red with a medium beige head. Sweet malt and huge spice aroma that is mostly cinnamon with a sprinkle of ginger and Nutmeg. Flavor is an absolute spice bomb. Tastes like chewing on a stick of Big Red. Some ginger and light malty sweetness as well. I Started liking Spiced Beers this year, especially Pumpkin Ales, and have always wondered whether there was such a thing as too much. I DID like this beer, but it did cross that line. I wonder if the BA Frosted Frog would Settle down the ""Spice"" a little?"
" ( side note ) -as it warms it really gets complex and the different spices are more evident."
"drinkability - despite the great taste the mouthfeel kills it and 22oz was a lot to stomach"
"D- Missed out on this one last year. I enjoyed this one and find it easy to drink. The price just like most of Hoppin Frog is what keeps me from coming back to this one often."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing were both decent enough. Aroma is all sweet spices, with nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger all noticable. The taste is like the aroma, it's all spice. Unfortunately that's not a good thing because all the spice just didn't agree with me after a while. I think the ginger flavor in this brew was way too strong compared to the other spices. As the beer warmed up more, it seemed like the ginger just got stronger. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it seems a bit thin at times, and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is below average, it certainly wasn't enjoyable to finish this bomber. I think if the spices had more balance in the flavor instead of being so heavy on the ginger, I would have liked this beer more."
"Bottle: Poured a light clear copper color ale with a small foamy head with OK retention and no lacing. Aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg is quite dominant and very enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by loads of cinnamon and nutmeg with lightly sweet malty backbone. Body is a bit light for style with average carbonation. I really enjoyed the spicing of this beer but the malt presence was a bit low for my own taste."
"I poured this one into a New Belgium snifter. It poured a dark, dark burnt amber with a light white head that sat atop the brew. The smell was fantastic. It was heavy on cinnamon, ginger, and especially nutmeg (just as stated on the bottle). It also smelled slightly sweet with no alcohol to be found. The taste wasn't quite as good as the smell but it was still pretty solid. I'd say it's kind of like a stronger brown ale with spices. The spices kind of overpower any traditional beer flavor. The mouthfeel was great. It was medium bodied and drank very, very smoothly. Overall I'd say it's pretty drinkable. It has good flavor and goes down smooth. I liked it."
"IMO this is easily the King of all maltier Christmas beers... just flavor-wise blows everything else out of the water and as soon its distribution increases I am sure it will catch on even more"
"D - Very drinkable winter warmer, great holiday brew to have even in August, I would get this brew again but for sure share with others, at times the spices got a little over whelming. I do recommend this brew and I will get this again"
"Overall an interesting brew, but it tasted like they were trying too hard. I don't foresee myself buying this anytime soon, that is, unless I can't find any GLBC or Thirsty Dog this holiday season...."
"I enjoyed this change of pace. Not too sweet, the natural sweetness of cinammon is well blended by ginger's pungency, and some spice from nutmeg. Ginger is usually off-putting to me, with few exceptions. This was one. Too much for one to finish the bomber. The mouthfeel is easy, and it is not thick. The beer smelled winter warmer.May have enjoyed it more at a supper."
"Drinkability:This is a fantastic Christmas ale, I taste it and am transported to the hottub in a gingerbread house."
"Unusual and tasty spiced ale. It's a ""Wow!"" beer for sure."
"Hoppin' Frog Frosted Frog Christmas Ale is a solid X-mas brew that is at least as good as this brewery's other seasonal, Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin Ale. It isn't as good as Great Lakes Brewing Company's classic, but it's definitely worth a single bomber purchase every holiday season."
"CHEERS!!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability isn't very good, the spices get to me after just drinking a small amount. I wish I had about 8oz of it instead of 22. Could be a nice desert beer with the right pairing though."
"If you like cinnamon, this is definitely worth a try. Otherwise ..."
"Very delicious, but perhaps misclassified"
"Thanks to Travita for sharing this bottle. The beer pours medium brown with an off-white head. The aroma is strong gingerbread cookies. The aroma is very spicy, it smells like Christmas. The flavor is more gingerbread with some great cookie flavored malt. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. Not sure how they did it, but they made a beer taste exactly like you are eating gingerbread cookies. Very happy I got to try this one."
"bomber from Chuck's in Chagrin Falls"
"Drinkability suffers a bit from the mouthfeel, but for a 8+% spiced winter warmer, it's about average. I'd recommend sharing this with someone - 22oz is a bit much on its own."
"I know this isnt everyones cup of tea, but it is a very spicy (festive spice, that is) beer that is balanced yet strongly flavored. Spiced beers are hard to get right and this one is pretty close. I couldnt taste the abv at all and if you dont mind in-your-face pumpkin pie flavors, this one is for you, as it was for me."
"Pours a slightly murky ruby and copper color with a small and super quick head and faintly syrupy looking consistancy. The aroma is ""Holy Christmas!"" Cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamon, ginger, and mace blast the nostrils every sip. Maybe some caramel malts hidden away in the aroma down there. The aroma is good, but a touch too much on the spices. The taste is full frontal assault of spices that last through all of the fron, most of the middle, and mellows out on the finish. Some sweet biscuit malts peak through the X-mas spice haze on the finish. As the beer warms, the alcohol really adds some fire to the cinnamon and ginger especially in the back of the throat. This beer is good for Christmas only. I could only drink one bottle, once a year and thats it thank you."
"But hey, if you like spiced beers this might be for you."
"I take another sip just to judge mouthfeel: thankfully, this beer is cold enough that it probably inhibits some flavor. It feels like old candy. It's sweet and [evergreen] piney, with a dose of Christmas bread-spice. It's the egg nog of beers. Do you want to drink a bunch of egg nog?"
"I had to plug the opening with my thumb and shake it up a bit to develop a nice two finger sized head. Pours with a deep ruby mahogany brown hue with khaki tan head forming with slow gurgling bubbles. Fine speckled lacing layers itself pretty evenly between sips, pretty attractive winter warmer meant for my Piraat chalice. Aromatics deep pie spice including cinnamon ginger and nutmeg with a slight citrus orange peel finish. Caramel sweetness is detected easily with minimal well hidden booze in trace amounts across my nares. The flavor is more pie spicing with caramel mild chocolate brown sugar glazed custard creamy tones. A touch of citrus amongst the nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon this is actually pretty damn enjoyable, I have to admit the first few sips I felt were cloying until my palate adjusted and I let it warm up a bit. Mouthfeel has a very balanced carbonation level rides smooth carrying spices and a creamy textured body without difficulty fuller bodied slow steady finish of alcohol burn that is really hidden compared to most of the winter ales available these days. Drinkability overall this one is a bit festive and after working 12 hours on Christmas day there's no better way to celebrate the beginning of a long weekend then by sipping on a fine spiced winter warmer out of Akron, OH. Amen, Halleleujgah, Wassail, WTF!"
"Medium body, good carbonation. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. This has a very nice Christmas cookie feel to it."
"Most certainly a winter sipper. Almost a perfect match to go with oatmeal raisin cookies."
"Frosted Frog is an impressive Winter Warmer. I like it a lot. More than I thought I would. I do think there's slightly too much cinnamon. But, there's not too much else to gripe about. Great Lakes Christmas Ale has been my favorite of the season for a while. Frosted Frog doesn't change that, but it's certainly a contender. I'll be sure to pick up at least a couple of bombers annually. Definitely check it out if you have the opportunity. Merry Christmas!"
"Drinkability - a great beer while we're making final preps for Christmas '09. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good pint!"
"O: This is what a Christmas Ale should be. Completely different. It doesn't taste like a year round brew with some minor changes. This one is very unique, and very good."
"D: I recommend sharing this with a few folks. As I mentioned, I feel that this beer is too thin and the low carbonation adversely affects the drinkability."
"D- I'm going to call this the best Xmas ale I've had this season - fantastic beer."
"This beer needs to be aged and it would be more enjoyable. It's a great beer to share during the holidays though."
"Drinkability: Moderately high, even though the ABV is 8.6%; I'm really digging the flavors and this would be a great dessert beer."
"Spices are a little heavy when considering drinkability, but a a bottle of this would be perfect for sipping around the holidays."
"D - Well, I remember my Dad telling me that if you're going to do something, do it all the way... and that is certainly what these guys did. If you're looking for a big ass winter warmer, here you go..."
"It's very drinkable indeed, just be aware of the high abv."
"A great beer from Hoppin Frog. This has been a good year with BA BORIS, Hopmasters Abbey, and now this all serving as excellent representations of their styles. Cheers and happy holidays Fred Karm and crew!"
"D- Not really what I was expecting, but I have to say I'm impressed...really does taste like what I can only describe as 'Christmas'...looking forward to having this one again and again and again..."
"Interesting beer, but you had BETTER want lots of spice. Most of the beer flavors are obscured. Just about the most heavily spiced beer I have yet tasted excluding Cave Creek Chile Beer."
"I bought this for 7.99 which is pretty decent for a bomber in these parts, but uh, I'm just gonna go find a cash machine, so I can buy some more..."
"Fred has a real winner here, seek this one out and hope that you have friends in Ohio this year, to hook you up! This holiday beer rocks! Very cool label, with Frosted Frog complete with Santa hat....nicely done!"
"Pours dark bronze with a foamy, off white head. Aroma is straight cinnamon with some ginger and candy. Flavor is very spicy cinnamon... maybe too much. It gets easier to drink as it warms. Nice mouthfeel and body. This is a decent beer, but won't replace Great Lakes as my favorite winter seasonal. 8 bucks is too much for a bomber."
"Hoppin' Frog makes some of the boldest beers in the area and they don't seem to shy away from serving up intensity. This is one of there better concoctions I've had."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied with a small bite of bubbly carbonation, very nice."
