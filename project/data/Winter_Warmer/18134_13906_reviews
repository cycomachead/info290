"Probably the best red hook beer I have had. especially considering it was 6 months out of date."
"This was my go to beer this winter, a great find."

""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass"
""
"Good stuff. Crisp,  refreshing and warms you up. Semi-sessionable."
"Poured a deep, dark amber with 1/2 inch foamy head that stays throughout.  A LOT of lacing left along the glass as you finish.  Sweet, malty, robust aroma -- the taste follows suit.  Good amount of carbonation.  For a 6.0% ABV, very easy to drink.  Perfect winter warmer."

"Version #30. Tried on 12/17/14, bottled on 9/30/14. 6.0% ABV. Pours a deep dark cranberry. Lightly and finely carbonated. Heavier body, slippery mouthfeel. Smells of malt and smoke. Light subtle smokiness on the ffront of the palate, lingering smokiness. All malt, no hops, mildly bitter though. Mild winter spicing. Nice. One and done."
""
""
""
"Nice brown color.  Not overly spiced for a winter.  Solid beer.  One inch head lasts though out the beer.  Would compare this to a straight brown beer."

"Overall: The hoppy aroma was a nice surprise and flavor had more hop involvement than I expected as well.  Very enjoyable;"

"So I got these really cheap in June, and I got what I paid for. When will I ever learn."

"Overall: another solid and very drinkable brew from Redhook"

"The first sip is average body and fine but tingly carbonation. Flavor is as the nose advertises, with a heavy malt base and caramel and toffee dominant. Again I dont get any hops or boozy bite. I do also get a little dark fruit, some red grape. This beer is pretty one dimensional but enjoyable for what it is. The beer does go down very easy and I find it a nice treat for the evening. Nothing outstanding but a nice malty treat."
"Overall: I consider this is an interesting Pale Ale. Not what I was expecting from a Winter Ale, but good."

"Overall / When I had my first one of these I thought it was average but over the next few day I had a few more and each time I discovered something new with it. I find this to be a great example of the winter warmer style as this has become a favorite winter beer for me."

"Just to note, this year (winter of 2013/2014) is actually the 29th brew so some flavors noted before may sound different from what you're drinking. They tweak the recipe each year just a bit to keep things interesting. Great head with a nice dark copper/amber color below. Good balance of hops to the sweet malt so it has a bitter bite at the front followed by a smooth caramel like finish."

"Red Hook's 2013-14 seasonal is pretty much spot on. and after a winter break of nothing but stellar belgian and american belgian-style winter warmers, etc, this is a nice way to save some dollars and get back to reality. recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So many other better warmers out there to even consider wasting your time with this one. Will not seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Fair head and some persistent lacing. Nose is bready with fruit, organic, and sweet tones. Sourdough bread, toasted grains, prominent character of nuts, and a bit of a peaty character. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"Winterhook reinvented itself this year as Winterhook #29 and this seasonal brew is among the better ones I have tasted in the series. You don’t get the nutmeg/cinnamon and other spices like you commonly taste in the typical winter seasonal. This is a more straight- forward beer without the holiday additives. I like it more and more with each passing sip and I think it is safe to say that most guests at your next holiday party will feel the same. Give it sampling and enjoy the taste of the season, courtesy of Redhook."

"Tasty enough brew - it isn't the big winter warmer I was expecting, but it is certainly a tasty ale with a good hop presence."
"One of Red Hook's best?"

"Overall, I am quite impressed with this offering from Redhook. There are a lot of flavors coming together and they all work really well. One to pick up if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice amber color. Great sweet hoppy aroma. First impression is of a winter pale ale. Spicy pine and hop notes. It becomes more bitter as you drink, but the flavor holds throughout. Flavor holds through the finish. Nice winter beer but it could improve in sweetness and depth."

"Would I buy this beer again? Definitely."
""
"Overall, our favorite thing about this beer was its complexity for the style. Here, they seemed less focused on the malt profile, allowing for a generous aromatic hop bite to permeated the sip. The aroma showed more of this as well, with bright green freshness of hops, and paler grain. This paleness does give a cheapness to the end of the swallow, and while this one isn’t as “warming” as others for the style, it will certainly keep you away on a cold winter’s afternoon."
""
"A pretty decent winter warmer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This used to be one of the several winter beers I'd look forward to, and it does have some fruity charms. Increasing bitterness in the aftertaste wins back no old friends, however. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Baron's Marketplace in San Diego."
"Overall: Definitely did not disapoint. Honestly pouring this into the glass I didn't know what to expect. Winter warmer?, maybe if you want to call it that. Grab a glass and drink up. Salud!"
""
"O: Gotta love a hoppy warmer. Intense earthy flavors bordering dirt in the mouth. Pine and hints of fruit compliment the roasty sweet malts. A great treat for winter that I'm eager to try the slightly altered version next year. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Winterhook comes in a cool bottle, it's a cool warmer, so to speak. The 45 ibus don't come on too strong, making it easy drinking. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good well made, but plain volksbier."
""
"Flavors are similarly ill defined, some bread malt and vague dry spiciness, but utterly indistinct and nebulous. Tea and herbal notes, kind of like an old pale ale with faded hops. Sharp and highly carbonated, seems like a lager with odd adjuncts in it. Not a seasonal beer to seek out really, glad it was free."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent tasting beer that makes one forget about winter, or at least momentarily forget about winter. Check it out if you get a chance."
""
""
"The last of a sixer. I wanted to get familiar with the beer first. The color is a clear chestnut. A small off-white head recedes quickly with islands of lacing, The aroma holds bread and sugar with a touch of apricot. The flavor is malty and earthy. No real noticeable alcohol. Body is medium. Texture is very soft. Low carbonation. This is an easy beer to drink and makes a nice nightcap. I truly enjoy this beer. It is a little on the light side for a winter warmer. And this can be good in the right circumstances. But it misses the center band of the style just a bit."
""
""
"Overall – A nice tasty, slightly sweeter, yet still roasty and spiced holiday brew. It has a nice feel and price, which when mixed with the good taste make for a brew to try and one to possibly go back to again and again."
""
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, herbal hops, and a slight spice note. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: A unique beer that gets better as it warms."
""
""
""
"But can I use of these during the summer fishing outings? Regardless, this stuff pours a clear sunset amber-topaz topped by a finger of sandy cream foam. The nose comprises mixed greens, very light menthol, and sweet, nutty toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some mild pine needles and something that sort of approaches a shadow of ginger. Gotta say, this sits very poorly on my tongue. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a muddled, unpleasant winter warmer. 'Nuff said."
""
"OVERALL: Though the vintage changes every year , this winter warmer drinks almost like a dark pale ale. Surprising amount of hop character for a winter warmer, and is a refreshing option in the holiday rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer grew on me a lot. Wasn’t anywhere close to as good as the Widmer Brr I just had, but it hit the spot. I’d have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light mid and drinks well. Alcohol is non existent. The flavors were just a bit of a miss for me, did improve a bit as it warmed."
"O: good beer, has all the deliciousness of a good winter warmer and only costs $1.90 for a 22oz bottle."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep copper color with amber highlights and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and spices. Taste is malty, bready, some nutmeg and cinnamon, good flavor but not great for this style. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"O - Just ok with me...well brewed, but tending towards the sweeter and sugary side of the balance line. Hops are not a big player here unfortunately. Perhaps just not really what I was looking for in a beer at this moment."
""
"Overall: Not a bad winter brew, I have had this one quite a bit over the years, can't really go wrong with it."
"Overall a decent Winter Warmer that was very drinkable, although it is nothing over the top..."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Solid Winter Warmer. It did have a bit of an English feel to it as well. Not heavy on the spices, but a strong roasted nut and caramel/toffee winter beer. I wasn't amazed by it but would drink it again if I were in the mood for the style."
""
""
""
""
"M. Lighter side of medium thick, adequately carbonated, semi-smooth texture."
""
""
""
""
"Pours brownish-copper with little head that dissipates quickly. The nose is quite subtle - nothing bad, but nothing good either. There is a solid malt profile upfront with very tasty roasted bitterness on the finish. A solid offering from a solid brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: good beer for the style, and good for me"
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. The hops add an awesome finish to this brew."
"O: There’s not much ‘warming’ in this Winter Warmer, but it is an easy-to-drink winter beer if you are looking for something that is malty and fuller bodied."
""
""
"I like that there is a winter warmer that is a little hoppier and not so over spiced, this is though a little simple and I'm indifferent about it overall. Nothing really stands out for me."
"O: Not bad but I don't know if I'd get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Why can't Longhammer have this kind of hop character?. This is real good beer and at sub-$2 a bomber it's a steal. One of Redhook's best without a doubt."
""
"Redhook's Winter Ale is fantastic. Pours a dark brown with two fingers of foamy head. Spices are perfectly balanced with an unexpected amount of hops. Chocolate mixes with grapefruit to create a truly original winter ale. Nuts and malts create a nice backbone and a delicious finish."
"This 2011/2012 version was sampled on tap (this is important because I’ve heard they change the recipe from year-to-year). The color was clear copper with a big khaki head that retained decently and left sliding spots of lacing. The aroma was not as spicy as it had been in the past, showcasing caramel malt and piney hops instead with only hints of clove. The flavors were a bit heavy on the herbal/piney hops at first with a caramel malt backbone and hints of toasted nuts and toffee behind that. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation mid-level. Not as spiced as many winter warmers which I found welcome though nothing amazing as a stand-alone brew either."
""
""
"O - This is the best Redhook I have tried. It's not quite what I would expect from a winter warmer, but what it is is good. Very approachable."
"This is the best beer I've tried from Redhook and a great one in the style. I liked it more than Great Lakes Christmas Ale."
""
""
"O: All in all, this is a decent brew. Glad I got to try it as it gives an interesting take on the style. It definitely has it's flaws, but a good brew to try if you like the winter warmer style."
""
"Winter Hook does a good job showcasing some toasted maltiness and a light roasty/hoppy bitterness on the finish. Hops have a moderate presence all the way through and the yeast is pretty clean for the most part. Pretty straightforward beer that is more akin to a hop-leaning amber ale than a winter warmer, but decently tasty brew. There are too many great winter seasonals to buy this one very often though."
""
""
""
""
"Defiantly not the best winter warmer out there but i would gladly session with this after a day of shreding the gnar at Crystal Mtn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, a decent winter warmer. Nothing super fancy, but the hop character was a nice deviation from the norm for the style."
""
""
"Overall not something I would reach for again and pretty light for a winter warmer. Drink is balanced for what it is but it just taste like their ESB only double which means too much herbal tea flavors."
""
""
"Red Hook Winterhook is a super clear, dark amber beer with a soft, waxy, light khaki head that has outstanding retention. There is some lightly sweet malt in the nose, with a hint of medicine and wood resin. It's medium-light bodied with a slightly gritty finish. It doesn't taste too sweet, but there is plenty of malt and a little medicinal bitterness. It's very warming. It tastes stronger than it is."
"6 pack picked up at the local beer place. Pours a lovely tan color into the pint glass. Capped by a small off white head with good retention. Clear with good bubbling carbonation. Nose is sweet with malt, caramel, orange zest. Taste adds grassy and floral notes, toffee. Light tannin. Leans to the sweet side this one does, but not cloying. Medium bodied, alcohol is slightly warming. Enjoyable."
""
"Winter Hook isn't a bad beer at all, and it is probably worth a try, especially because it tends to pop up at places that might not have a stellar tap list."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really don't know what this beer is trying to be. It's all over the place, and I don't like the bitterness in it. Needs more malts and caramel."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Been drinking some shit beer tonight, getting tired of it."
""
"Overall - worth a try - at least worth getting a 6er - if you like hoppy, big flavored beers."
""
""
""
""
"D- surprisingly good from an underestimated brewery. Anheuser Busch has the rights to this one around here, and thanks to my sales rep Ty for the sample."
"Light and mellow winter warmer. This is a good all around holiday beer. The hops and cocoa seem to give it a holiday spice without being forced. Good stuff for $7.99."
""
"O: I generally prefer less hopped winter warmers, but this wasn't bad. I feel like it was very comparable to the Never Summer Ale and would call it a tie."
"O - Very drinkable beer. Definitely let it warm up a bit, it is uninteresting when cold."
"This is a nice; if rather nondescript, beer. There are more interesting Winter Warmers out there, but this is still a decent beer."
"Pours a nice, deep copper-brown. An off-white head rings and stays. Smell is chiefly brown sugar. Taste is a bitter affair, in a good way - pleasant mild hops, and the underpinning acrid nuttiness of a brown ale. Feel is tight and tart, with ginger coming into presence. Finishes with a metallic and grapefruit aftertaste. Overall, a decent winter warmer, that I'm thankful isn't slamming me over the face with spices."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I really enjoy this beer. The Winter Warmer designation always throws me b/c you never know what you'll get. This beer is warming, well balanced and perfect for a cold night. Very drinkable, will buy again."
"O: This beer is a definite must try. It is has an exclusive floral taste that is well complimented with its strong hop profile. The value of this beer is also great, the flavor of this beer is very worth a price."
""
""
""
""
""

"Perfect winter drinker and quite easy to throw back a few with no problems."
"At any rate, this stuff is good beer and it deserves a good review."
"Winterhook is a nice beer that I think most would enjoy. However, it's not memorable. Given the light hop flavor, I never would have guessed that Redhook used 4 hop varieties. Lastly, I don't understand what makes it a winter seasonal. It's a very middle-of-the-road beer that doesn't offer anything unique or different."
"Overall: At almost 6% this did not age well. Would like to try a fresher version."
"Poured a clear chestnut color with a frothy beige head that retains well. Toasty malts in the aroma, nutty with a bit of sweetness. Nutty taste, malty, toasty, a bit bland. Some light hops come through near the end for a slightly bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel and somewhat drinkable, but not that great. Reminded me more of an amber ale than a winter warmer or strong ale."
"This beer poured out with a reddish brown color. The head was alright, kinda thin not much lacing here. The smell of the beer was a little spicy and a little roasted. The taste has a slight sweetness to it, mostly some dark mark in the flavor. There seems to be just a hint of pine or spruce in within deep the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is definitely drinkable but I just didn't feel that this Winter Warmer was really up to par."
"This is a lovely cold weather beer that is medium to light bodied so it won't beat your palate like a stout. Very well done."
"O: Good beer, above average, but not by a lot."
"Verdict: I came down hard on this beer's appearance and aroma but I would like to think that the excessive aging may have had some sort of a negative impact on that. However, the taste and mouthfeel didn't fade nearly as much; in fact they may have flourished. This was a good introductory beer into Redhook's lineup for me. I will recommend, but also insist that the drinker gets the beer as soon as it comes out, so keep your eyes peeled and don't expect to be disappointed. B- (3.43)"
"Perhaps freshness of the keg is in play here. But, it was recommended by the bartender as a ""hoppy"" beer. Wrong. Average offering at best."
"D - not a bad quaff. i'd hit up a six to share with friends with no reservation at all."
"D: Not ""sessionable"" IMO, but very nice for one or two. Good winter seasonal beer."
"Overall, a nice beer to have throught the winter months (as the name would suggest) Bready, spicy aroma with somewhat of a fruited undertone. Appears a ruddy brown color, seems to glow under bar room lighting. Hints of spices are laced throughout the breadiness of this beer. Overall, for a winter ""heavier"" beer, its incredibly easy to drink. Could session it. Great beer to try, would be a hit even with not craft brew afficianados."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Appearance: Pours a clear, bright brown body with a moderate, off-white head. Smell: The unfortunate aroma is formed by an offensive mixture of berries, soured citrus fruits, and dirty metal. Taste: Bland, plain-tasting malt flavor with a slight nuttiness to it. The small amount of hops present provide a bit of grassiness. Finishes sour and with the taste of stewed greens. Mouthfeel: Lackluster medium-thin body, with moderate carbonation and an exceedingly watery palate. Drinkability: Something to keep in mind: there are many far better winter beers. This one's a total washout."
"Not terribly unique or memorable, but certainly drinkable, and well-worthy of the bargain price (got it for $4.69/6-pack at a local liquor shop)."
"(90th)"
"Why does nobody seem to talk about this beer? $7.99 a 6-pack, are you kidding me? I will definitely get this again. A highly drinkable and tasty winter ale."
"D: Very drinkable and the folks at Redhook dont often dissapoint with any beers I have tried, Great way to relax after work on a snowy winters day."
"Like the sign on a junkyard I sometimes pass: ""striving to be above average."" Nice brown-copper color. Lots of nutty roasted malt notes, leaning a bit toward the sweet side. Winter warmer? More of a robust brown ale. Pleasant but not memorable."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability - Not a bad brew. A little bitter, but not too much, just right for my taste buds. It seems a little light actually for a Winter Warmer, but the nutty flavor does bring out a bit more fuller quality."
"http://beerandboise.wordpress.com"
"The body is medium at most, and has plenty of smooth feel and carbonation to keep it alive. It is by no means a sipper by the fire, but the lingering bitter finish offers excellent drinkability, and enough flavor to satisfy."
"Another offering from Redhook thats worth a look but not worth any sort of extra effort to obtain"
"Taste is mild all around. Every Redhook beer I've had tastes like a good beer that has been watered down. This one is no exception. Light hop, mal. If this is a winter beer, where are the spices? I detect NONE. Mild sweet aftertaste. This beer is decent and drinkable but I sure had higher expectations. Average all around."
"D: I am all for getting another 6er of this. That really is the best way to tell if you enjoy a beer. Will I be buying this again? You betcha!"
"It's not an above average beer, but after sampling all the watery beers i've had today, it tastes like a champion."
"definatly one of the more drinkable winter warmers. its cheap, widely available, offers a sessionable ABV, decent hops, i definatly would recommend this."
"Beautifully balanced, very drinkable."
"Overall Thoughts/Opinions: nice and pleasant but not freaking amazing. I think this little option would fit more in a NW IPA category rather than a Winter Warmer, but who am I to advise Redhook? I'll have to try a Jubelale, Snowcap, Celebration, and Sammy Smith Winter Welcome in the near future to see if the Winterhook is more like an IPA or if my preferences/familiarities have changed."
"This poured dark amber with notable head that stuck around for a while. It smelled and tasted malty and toasty. It had a well balanced taste that wasn't too sweet or smoky. I would classify this as moderately crisp and medium bodied, making it easy to have a few of these in a row. However, after i finished, I started to get that sour, muck taste that sometimes follows beer. I still think Winterhook is pretty solid and will come back to it next winter."
"Drinks slightly above average for the style. I'd buy again, but not all the time. Would make a nice addition to a holiday dinner."
"Overall decent for a winter warmer. Would drink it again but wouldn't necessarily buy it again."
"M: Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Smooth and rich. Good flavor and good balance."
"You will taste refreshing fruit in the front which is immediately balanced with mild bittersweet hops. very smooth finish and fresh mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer. I wish I could drink that one on tab, or from a fresh keg.Nice beer!"
"D: An okay winter warmer. Will probably not buy anymore."
"Pours a moderate copper color with some ruby tint to it. Slight off white head and a bit of lacing. The nose is sweetness with some caramel and molasses and light wintry spices. The taste brings down a bit more spice, and doesn't terribly overdo it. Light caramel and malt sweetness. Medium body with good carbonation. For what it is, not too shabby."
"2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.90% ABV. 29.2 IBU's. (3.5 / 5.0) Winter Ale--ESB. Light tan dense medium mild lace head. Clear bright rich copper color. Toasted mild caramel mild hop malt spice front. Rich medium sweet toasted caramel biscuit slightly crusty rich malt body. Clean satisfying smooth mild hop spice end. Well made Winter Amber. Sampled 10/16/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $6.99 at Seattle Fred Meyer--Ballard on 10/16/2010."
"Value: I paid $3.99 for a sixer on sale. KILLER!"
"Overall, a decent brew. As with a lot of Redhooks brews, it makes for a nice introduction to the style, or to help bring someone over from the light side."
"D - A very drinkable ale, but also not memorable enough to seek out again."
"Overall: Easy to drink and perfect for cold temperatures so can't ask for much more, but it seems all the flavors and aromas are so bland and subtle there's no reason to choose this over another winter ale."
"D - A nice-drinking beer but not my favorite winter warmer. Sessionable for sure."
"D: This is a solid winter offering. Big malty flavors and but still balanced. Generally, I'm not a big fan of the brewer but this is my favorite beer from Redhook."
"This Beer did not impress me (much like other of the Redhook beers I've tried). I thought that the beer was going to change my mind about Redhook, but instead it isn't showing much in the way of flavor. It is winter in a place notoriously bombarded with snow so I was feeling chipper to drink a WinterAle. I was persuaded by a beer salesman to give it a shot. It poured a dark copper color with a two finger head. The smell was a caramel and toasted malts with whiffs of chocolatiness as well. First, taste. Hmmm... Where'd it all go? I didn't taste much more than what I could just smell. The mouthfeel is nothing short of lame. No chewiness to it at all. The drinkibility may be there where you can keep drinking it without savoring it, but that also means I do not care for savoring, much less drinking too much more of this beer. There are better winter ales that are cheaper than this too! Oh well."
"This is a pretty good winter beer. Not exactly my favorite, it's a little sweet, but finishes bitter. Still, a good beer."
"If you see it on sale, definitely snatch some up, but otherwise-with so many great winter ales in the market-you could pass on this one without fearing that you had missed anything Earth-shaking."
"D: This is pretty drinkable and the spices aren't much for a winter warmer; there is something in the aftertaste that becomes a tad wearing"
"Appearance is a dark brown with slight red tint with fair head and lace. Smell of citrus, caramel and light roasted malt. Taste has a sweet roasty caramel bitterness. Mouthfeel is a smooth medium with just enough carbonation to make it so. Overall a very nice balance, making a very good winter ale."
"Drinkability- Not too heavy and smooth drinking."
"Overall, a nice ale. It is a bit watery for me but has a decent flavor profile. Still needs more to distinguish it as a winter warmer. Just not a beer that reminds me too much of winter."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Average."
"D - Solid drinkability for a warmer. Certainly a bit filling and a bit too sweet for summer months, but certainly does the trick for the winter. ABV will surely warm you, but probably not bite."
"A little bit of chocolate and roasted nuts underlie the surface. Good hopping. Serviceable."
"This was a pleasent suprise and a very good winter ale."
"It's a pleasant enough brew but it's a little to o thin and watery at times."
"This is a good one for winter if you're not into overly spiced brews, and a good median between that type and the Christmas ales that are, in fact, IPAs."
"d: a very smooth and drinkable ale; a little strong on the grape notes;"
"D-This is a very drinkable winter warmer since it is not as heavy and filling as some others, and the ABV is only 5.9%. One of Redhook Ale's better offerings of late."
"D: Smooth, well balanced beer. No harshness present. Easy to drink."
"D - This really reminds me of SNPA but with a smooth start and thicker body. Great winter beer!"
"Conclusion: Good, solid winter warmer, brewed in the English tradition; nice balance of malt and hops; this is unique enough to stand on its own, yet approachable for those just getting into craft beer. I'm going to make it a point to get this into my winter rotation much more regularly!"
"It isn't a great beer but it is a good one. Similar to a less hoppy Pyramid SnowCap."
"Drinkbability- Would be a great winter beer without the scary spice/hop"
"Very effective as a winter warmer. Almost compelling."
"Nose is caramel, a slight spice and hops and that is about it. Some alcohol comes through. Taste is bland but the hops do bitter the mouth up in the end. Mouthfeel is a little oily and ok overall"
"This beer smells very hoppy but tastes more malty. Complex flavor and still very drinkable for your average beer drinker."
"One of the better Redhooks I've had. Not bad."
"Pours a clear amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of strongly of hops, slight spice aroma, and some sweet malt. Fits the style of a Winter Warmer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Hops bitterness is present up front, slight spice comes through second (all spice), then there's a sweet malt background, with a very smooth finish of hops and a slight alcohol flavor. Wow, this is a well blended beer, heavy on the hops (my favorite). Easy to drink, and low enough in abv to allow me to drink a few. I wish I had more of this, great beer - worth a try."
"Got a 12 pack for 7.99, so thought I'd give it a try. Good beer at that price. Overall, not much going on for this beer. I was expecting much better based on past reviews."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, it's not too bad but there are definitely a lot of other beers in the style that I would pick first."
"Decent but not really a standout in the 'winter' category."
"Pours a very clear brown colored body, with a small head, off-white in color. Has a hoppy malty sweet aroma. A dusty, light sweet taste. Very light tasting. Not much flavor. Has some hoppiness and bitterness, but not much flavor."
"This tasted very good with a chocolate chip cookie."
"Ok winter warmer, nothing terribly exciting. There are better ones out there, but this is worth a try."
"D - A liked it, but did not love it. Usually would have only one, unless I stayed at the same bar and didn't have any other options. I don't drink winter brews regularly this time of year, so I'm not the best judge of this."
"this beer pours a nice copper color with a foamy tan head that fades to thick lacing. the aroma carries a lot of malt character, with just a bit of some noble hops at the back. the taste is good well balanced with the sweet malt up front and the citrus and spice of the hop arrangement follow through nicely. a well balance beer, although I would have expected a bit more in the way of alcohol from a warmer."
"Not too heavy - I could drink a few of these, but definitely in the season. With snow on the ground, this beer feels like the right way to enjoy the evening."
"Someone else mentioned the price in his review, and I have to agree. For 6.99 a sixer, this is a steal."
"Cheers, and Hoppy Holidays!"
"Taste is a little dry with spice, caramel, hops and malt. This is not a bad beer. I would say this beer falls into the bock catagory."
"D - I could drink a few of these, although the carbonation tends to make it a bit filling. This is an interesting ale, but I'm not sure what it's trying to be. The malt profile is far too muted to be a winter warmer IMHO. It's closer to an English bitter or an IPA as far as I'm concerned. Definitely worth a try, though - as long as you're not expecting a malty, spicy winter ale."
"D - A great sessioner for the season. I'm not sure if ""winter warmer"" is the best style for this beer to be listed under, but either way it's a great, solid beer. Nothing huge or bold, but simple and harmonious."
"One of the better winter warmers I have tried lately. No harsh flavors with this one. It is a nice smooth drinker."
"D-It's pretty decent. Not a spectacular brew, and I probably won't chase after this one in the future. Overall, though, still a nice beer, and with a wider availability on-tap at restaurants, a good choice when dining out."
"From the ""extra"" seasonal offering from the Redhook sampler pack I am very pleased. Its a great beer."
"I'll skip the usual, boring and repetative ""review"" (""xxx pours a deep mahogany brown with red highlights blah, blah, blah"") and say simply that this is one of the better brews I've sampled in some time - if you like your ale on the hoppy side. Not a ""big"" beer, just a nice, fairly low gravity ale with a bite. And and $6.99/6 pack, it's ranking increases in light of the exceptional value. It' getting tough to find a real soild brew under $10.00 - this was a very pleasant discovery and I will be buying more!"
" ~ This a tasty, smooth and likable winter warmer. Give it a try."
"mid body. adequate carbonation. i could drink another sixer this season."
"Very well done ale, I would look for it again."
"For being a hoppy beer, I really enjoyed this, and I can't say that of other hoppy beers (that aren't IPA's). I was very impressed with my first exposure to Redhook brewery."
"This beer pours a clear, dark copper/chestnut color. The head is tan and creamy, nice head retention, and leaves excellent lacing throughout the beer. Initial scent is of some roasted malts, piney hops with a hint of sweetness...perhaps spices? Flavor starts a bit malty, with a hint of sweetness, caramel and spiciness. Body bordered on medium, and it felt fairly smooth on the tongue. This is the first beer that I have tried from Red Hook - I found it to be a nice winter beer!"
"This beer pours a lovely dark copper color with a small head that leaves little lace. Smells malty with spice, like a winter warmer should Tastes the same. Strong malt flavor followed by the spices. But not too spiced like the Widmer Brrr....Winterhook is balanced perfectly. Very good beer, albeit a bit on the thin side. An easy drinking beer. Very good stuff."
"This isnt a great winter warmer, but swings the better-balanced RedHook ESB in a darker, hoppier direction."
"Overall I was extremely impressed with this beer. Very smooth compared to most Winter Warmer's. I would recommend this to anyone."
"The pour was a mild amber with a festive white head. The smell had a distictive pine scent which foreshadowed the hops to come. I'd concur with the previous reviewer who suggested this was one of the hopiest seasonal ales. Indeed, they made this beer as crisp as the season it celebrates. Happy Holidays!"
"This ale is great for the novice or the snob, and makes a great beer to take to grandma's house for Christmas dinner for all to enjoy."
"The taste is not nearly as hopped up as the nose would indicate. There is a nice hop presence, but it is well balanced with the bready and biscuity grains. There maybe some winter type spices in the beer, such as nutmeg, almond extract, allspice, and the like. There is a slight hop drying feel in the mouth towards the finish. The beer is quite creamy with a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. This is a reasonably complex beer with a good interplay between the hops, spices, grains, and malts. The mouthfeel is a tad watery, the hop bite does extend a bit into the aftertaste. This is a nice beer and glad I pulled it off the shelf. L'Chaim."
"Bottle poured a clear amber with a medium white head. Nutty aroma with some herbs and tea. Flavor is smoother than one would expect, malty and earthy. The taste is almost like a low-alcohol barleywine. Its okay, but not really what I was expecting from a winter brew."
"Overall, a solid beer. I would recommend this winter style ot anybody."
"D: It goes down pretty easily, given the generally thin mouthfeel. If I enjoyed the flavor more, I could put down a few of these with no trouble."
"This update was on Jan. 29, 2014."
"It's pretty easy to drink. I wouldn't recommend it as a compliment to a meal. This is definitely a beer that one drinks by itself, preferably while sitting next to a warm fire in the accompaniment of friends. It's definitely one I would drink again, most likely on a special occasion."
"Overall a very drinkable winter brew, perhaps taking its cues more from Sierra Nevada's Celebration than the prototypical Winter Warmer, and should perhaps therefore be labeled accordingly. Not as outstanding as Sierra Nevada's example, but a solid offering nevertheless."
"Not too bad. Aroma's a bit hoppy but none in the flavor. Flavor, however, is decent with a ttinge of dry-roastyness. Nice rich dark amber, reddish color. Light head that lasts somewhat. Almost no lace. Fairly balanced. ok mouthfeel. Decent finish. Could be a session beer."
"This beer is copper in color, hues of orange with a solid head on top and trickles of lacing. The aroma is hoppy....a clean and crisp fruity aroma. Bit of caramel too. The taste is a winner. Pleasantly hoppy and malty. Good mix of caramel and sweet dough to go with the grapefruit and piney hop flavors. There's also a hint of orange flavor. Finishes clean. A good drinkable beer overall, and one that paired well with my spicy pork tenderloin topped with BBQ sauce."
"D- Drinks fine for the style"
"This is a decent beer, but considering the many options, I won't be reaching for it often."
"Overall a very good winter ale. Will definitely have this again."
"I liked this beer... a lot. I was pleasantly surprised, as I've had 4 or 5 styles of Redhook before and while they were good, none really wowed me. This one certainly did though. This was just a delicious hoppy amber/red ale. Great look in the glass, awesome smell and taste, a nice creamy mouthfeel and finish. Man it went down way too quickly for dinner and I'm pissed I only got a single. I'll be getting a 6'er for thanksgiving!"
"D: This is a very nice winter offering. An assertive hop profile balanced fairly well with some malts and spices. I'd drink this again, and it's a good option for the price ($6.99/six)."
"Notes: What a fine brew of a surprise. Six pack next time as it was so easy to have."
"D - High. Nice session brew while making out that list for Santa."
"Pretty hoppy for a Winter Warmer, more of a dark Amber Ale in my opinion. Still, pretty tasty."
"I talked to a representative from the brewery and they told me that Winterhook was Red Hook's ""experimental"" beer, and that they do something different every year. She told me that this year's concoction was a hoppier version of years past with some different flavors thrown in. So I did what any defenseless man conversing with an attractive young woman would do, I took her advice and bought a six-pack. After I tried one she was right about the hops....they were everywhere, smell and taste. Now I'm not complaining but the supposed ""other flavors"" I couldn't find. I seemed to me this beer was nothing more than a fine crafted micro-brew pale ale with some roasted malt thrown in for a nice dark color. Not a bad choice but there are better Red Hook beers out there."
"D: Doesn't do it for me. Too hoppy ( yeah, thats right, I said TOO hoppy!) I'm not into high IBU beers, at all, more of a malt head. Nice beer, not offensive at all, but, not my cup of hops."
"This is probably one of my favorites from Redhook with some nice chewy sweetness but it's the freshness of the hops here that really did it for me with this pint. Tasty and pretty easy drinking for the size."
"12oz bottle from the local Shaw's. Pours a translucent dark copper color with a good half inch of off-white head. Smells fruity, spicy, hoppy, malty, caramel/toffee... Tastes fruity, with cinnamon, nutmeg, orange zest, nut, toffee, caramel, just a tinge of butter... A wide plethora of flavors with the malt and hops both playing huge roles. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation combines with the pleasant flavors to make this one super-drinkable. A new favorite winter beer!"
"Lots of carbonation to go with a somewhat doughy mouthfeel and light-medium body. Nice balanced taste. Quite drinkable."
"Pours a nice reddish color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hops, with some spices. The taste is malty, slight hop, spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice brew."
"Overall, not bad at all. It is very mild, and could potentially be a great transitional beer. Definitely one of the better beers that I've had from Redhook. I'd buy it again, but I won't be rushing back. There are betters out there for ~$8.50 a sixer."
"D- Yes this is very drinkable, I'm glad I got this fresh as well. Its a nice beer."
"Drinkability: For my first winter brew of 2008, I was pretty impressed. This is one is tasty and rather easy to gulp down, definetley a sessionable beer for those holiday parties."
"overall, not disappointed, but was expecting something different from a ""winter beer"" probably would not buy again"
"fan of the winter season, this is a damn good reason to look forward to it."
"d. meh. Not horrible... decent for a middle of the road winter ale. I wouldn't really call it a warmer, more like an average hoppy amber. Might be a decent introduction for someone unfamiliar with the ""winter"" style, but really kind of middle of the road, and there are so many other good options out there, this one just falls off the radar."
"Pours a nice brownish color. Thin lace around the edge of the glass. Aroma hints of hops and malt of course. Taste is a bit bitter but nice. Not a roasted malt flavor a bit more sweet and the hops stand right out. A bit of alcohol bite as well. Recommended."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Medium head on a light amber body. Considerably more bitter than I prefer, I couldn't get anything else out of it. There was a dusty aftertaste that didn't help at all. It was smooth, however, not too fizzy. Just not anything I'd go after."
"One of the least impressive winter beers I've ever sampled."
"I'm getting a tasty but unremarkable middle-of-the-road ale. I'd buy it again and drink it again (good drinkability) but I can't get past a B grade on this one. Nothing about it really stands out."
"Pours a bockish colour with some retaining head. Mild malt and spice aroma.Significant hops in there. Middling mouthfeel, syruppy malt. Not too complex, symbollically tasty, with celery. A bit better than average beer though so-so as a winter warmer."
"Pours a clear amber to copper with a small beige head. Looks thin in the glass. Smell is light, but malty and faintly spiced. Decent nose. Taste mild, lightly spiced, but not much so, malty with maybe the faintest twinge of tartness and/or alcohol and spice. Actually isn't too bad for the style."
"This beer goes down well. And the next went down well, and so did the next one, etc."
"It is a nice tasting beer and the ABV isn't very high. I think is slightly lower than 6% according to Redhook's website. I would drink this again."
"This beer pours a nice orange-amber color with a nice medium off-white head that laces the glass all the way down. The aroma is of sweet malts layered with winter spice smell and finally a small amount of hoppy bitterness at the end. The taste is really good while following up the aroma. It has a very nice sweet roasted malt base with a nice amount of winter spices - cinnamon, some orange, and a hint of chocoalte from the roasted alts. The mouthfeel is good - very crisp and refreshing. The beer is quite drinkable and I could have a few of these."
"Overall, I really liked the flavor, but to describe it was tough. It's a good winter ale."
"Overall I thought this was a rather nice offering from Red Hook. I have had better, sure, but this was definitely not bad at all. Would I go out and buy it, probably not, but I certainly would not turn my nose up at it either. Could have had a little more spice to it to make it have that little bit of an extra pop, but overall it was still good and would say if it was there, you could do much worse."
"This beer pours a clear pale amber color. The head is small, and recedes very quickly into almost no lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt, but is very faint. The taste is like the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, this is an extremely pour example of a winter warmer, and a bad beer all around. It isn't bad enough that I can't finish one bottle, but I won't drink this again."
"Drinkability is average. This is fine, and a bit distinct, but not in a great way."
"Pours a shade or two darker than orange, w/ white foam that recedes fast. Light caramel in the aroma. It's sweetish in a cramelly way, some malt. The barest suggestion of chocolate. Touch of chalk to the finish. Rather light-bodied for a winter warmer. Drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable for the style. Got this because everything else on tap was bleh. If in the same situation recommended."
"D - Overall I enjoyed this brew it is a little lighter than other winter ales but that doesn't really hurt this beer its worth a try"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but not a lot of complexity. I can think of plenty of other Winter Warmers I would rather drink."
"Pretty good pick, the flavor is very unique with that subtle streak of hoppy bitterness. I've heard they change the recipe with this one every year, so we'll see how it is compared to future offerings, I suppose."
"D - I may be biased against this one because it's heavy on the bitter hops and light on the maltiness and robustness I tend to enjoy. I could drink several of these and I could think of many beers I would dislike more than this one. I just won't seek this one out."
"OVERALL: A tasty beer from Redhook. Not your typical winter, but still a very drinkable beer with a winter twist. Worth a taste."
"One of the better beers I have had from Red Hook, certainly not the best winter beer I tasted this year but not too bad, recommended mainly because it is so inexpensive"
"12oz brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a clear gold/amber with a sparse white head. Some malt in the aroma with a little of the trademark Redhook diacetyl. Pretty thin in the body. Crisp hop bitterness. A little butteryness and bready malt. Decent hop finish. Not that exciting, more of a bland amber than a true hearty winter beer."
"Was able to give this brew a try last evening, actually had a few back earlier in December. This brew poured to a nice deep copper color with a good sized (what I would call) light tan head that had ample retention leaving a nice amount of lace chunks down the side of the glass. The aroma had a nice malt smell to it, which really seemed to have a toasted property. I would also say that caramel shines through with a nice slight spice to it. The taste, while not being stupendous has a very good quality to it, it is very easy drinking as the malt properties lead to a nice flavor. Caramel comes to mind quickly with a slight nut flavor. Seems to be a bit dry. I will say that I am surprised that this is considered a winter warmer, to me it seems like a simple pale ale that is well balanced. This would be a fine session brew although at 6.1% could get you in trouble, but to me that is the feel of this one. Not a bad brew, just not a winter warmer, but what the hell do I know."
"D - Average across the board. Pretty forgettable overall. Not bad by any means, just not anything to seek out. Redhook can do better."
"Medium-bodied and fairly crisp, but when I think of a winter warmer I tend to think of something that will be...well, warm. This just doesn't do it. Not quite heavy enough to do the trick, but still thick enough and with a high enough ABV to make a poor session beer. Nothing terrible, but nothing too impressive either. This is definitely an average beer that I will probably not bother to revisit."
"Mouthfeel is very light and well carbonated. Very drinkable, even sessionable ale, but nothing exceptional about it."
"There is malt I think. and the hops are not overbearing."
"First brew from the Redhook Brewery, and I am not dissapointed... their winter warmer is a decent stab at the style... appearance was a nice caramel color with a minimal head... taste was about average for a winter warmer... a little caramel sweetness on the palate with some spices present, maybe cinnamon, but a little more bland compared to some other winter warmers I've sampled... I was pretty satisfied though, having copped a single 12oz bottle from Wine and More in West Orange for about $1.79... at 6%, there was a nice alcohol glow pervading from the drink, and the sweetness lingered on the mouth for a bit... great drinkability and the alcohol is hardly noticeable behind a sweet finish... Recommended..."
"I don't consider my palette particularly developed, but after this beer I think I understand what it is for the malt to have a great relationship with the hops. I normally wouldn't really see the winter beer characteristics in this other than some spices that I'm picking up and the high drinkability, but you can knock back a 6 pack of these and feel refreshed (and drunk) instead of overwhelmed. Nice dark copper color. I enjoyed drinking it more straight out of the bottle than in the glass and I'll be buying it again next year."
"Nice dark dark copper appearance with decent head. Gives off a semi-sweet aroma that reminds me of Sam Adams Winter Lager. I think I detect some dried-fruit-like flavors such as prunes and raisins along with the roasted malt. Decent beer. Maybe I'm just not in the mood for this beer right now or something but it doesn't really pique my interests or my taste buds all that much to make me want more and more. It's OK."
"Pours a deep chocolaty opaque brown; tan head has fine bubbles and persists some. Aroma is rich and creamy and fairly malty with strong hints of spice and coffee. Flavor is mainly malty and has a roast coffee overtone and hints of spice and hops. Very smooth, perfect for the winter holidays."
"A nice winter warmer. Not as ""big"" as some other beers of this style. That is not a bad thing at all, actually that is what I like most about it. The people at Redhook did not try to over do this beer, and what you get is a very drinkable and tasty brew."
"High in drinkability, flavorful and a bit complex yet approachable enough to bring to a holiday party. By far its one of my favorites each year."
"This beer pours into a typical pint glass from the 12oz bottle. The beer is golden-amber with a small off white head that leaves a small ring and laces only a bit. The smell is slightly hoppy displaying citrus notes and has a bit of a biscuity and breadyness to it. The taste is almost all pale malts with the same malt profile as the smell adn a touch of hops on teh finish. THe mouthfeel is full bodied with some lingering syrupyness. Overall seems more like an blonde or an APA, and not my favorite as it seams a bit amatuerish with the way it is all put together."
"A nice copper colored ale. You can definitely smell the malts. The beer has a nice malty flavor combined with some sweetness. It has a nice clean finish, nice balance, and nothing, including the alcohol, is overwhelming. I give it high marks, although there is nothing exceptional in the taste, it is decent, and the clean finish leaves you wanting another swig. Its a nice little sixer to pick up."
"Pours a clean copper/ orange-ish color, with a white head. In the aroma, a sweet, sugary fruitiness. In the taste, malty, and a very sugary corriander taste. A big body, with a small bite in the mouthfeel, and a dry sugary, orange-ish aftertaste. Kind of candy like, and a nice body."
"I'm having this one at room temperature. It pours amber with not much of a head. I can smell the spice in it, but just barely. Tastes bitter and dry, slightly spicy. Mouthfeel was smooth and aptly warming. Drinkable? Not very. Too dry. Too boring. Not as good as the Anchor Christmas for sure."
"I really hope to find a 6-pack off the Winterhook soon, or at least get three in a mixed twelve. It's a good winter warmer, though those who don't want something so hoppy may be turned off. A nice winter warmer for hopheads, though."
"Drinkability is very high. A pleasing, mild hoppy beer that is really enjoyable with each sip. I'd order this again if I was faced without stouts on tap. As other shave mentioned, I'm not sure why this is called a winter seasonal. No spices, no heaviness, nothing wintery about it. No matter when it comes out though, this isn't bad from Redhook, a brewer I usually skip over."
"A decent ale but slightly below average for a winter brew. Very drinkable but otherwise uneventful. Nothing really stands out in the way of winter additives of typical spices. Slightly hoppy and bright on the top end, finishes with a bit of zing. Decent head and lacing. A very brash pour caused a huge 2 inch head but it held its own and brought itself down quick. This is a very drinkable beer but definitely not best in class. Go with CBC winter Warmer or Great Lakes Christmas Ale (best in class)."
"D = I wasn't sure where to score this in terms of drinkability. If your measure is whether it is exceptional enough that you would look forward to having it again, I would give it at best an average rating. If you want to know is it good enough that you could drink it all night without complaints, it is perfectly fine and I would give it at least a good rating. In the end I came out in between. I will probably have this again and would pick it over many other beers available, but in the end it just isn't special enough for me rate it too much above average."
"D: This is a decent winter ale. There are much better ones out there though. I had it on cask at the brewery, so that was cool, but I wouldn't otherwise go out of my way for it."
"D: It was a decent brew with a moderate ABV but a bit more bite and piny flavors than I typically enjoy."
"Drinks good, makes me think APA vice winter warmer, but is still pretty tasty. I'd take this over their IPA or ESB any day!"
"Has a nice copper look, although with little head and lacing. Has a very neutral scent, just a bit of an ale/hoppy aroma, but nothing strong at all. A nice crisp flavor, very clean that starts with a slight hoppy feel and ends with a hit of caramel and what tastes like a bit of spice. Goes down fine, not rough, not overly smooth. A nice ale, but not the best winter warmer."
"Overall- A tasty beer. Just a bit of a letdown when I think of a winter warmer."
"Pours with a five finger off-white head leaving a good lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. The nose is hoppy with some spices. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is a mellow blend of spices with a nice hop backbone. Decent winter ale. $1.50 for 12oz from Capitol Convenience, Concord, NH."
"Pours a amber color with creamy one-finger head. Aroma is nice and spiced. Taste is malty upfront with the spices disappearing in the back of the throat. Not as overpowering as other examples I've had. Very smooth like a pale ale. I supposed it still qualifies as a winter warmer but the spices are not overpowering like other examples I've had."
"Light bodied with average drinkability.  Decent beer, however nothing too exciting to me."
"The Winterhook comes in an old man winter blowing our way with a freshness date of September 17th. It pours a clear amber color with some nice foam lacing and a head that hangs around for a while. The smell alright with mostly a hoppy aroma dominating. It tastes nice more on the floral side with less of a maltiness which seems to be a norm for this style. It has a nice caramel flavor to it and it is light and soft in the mouth. Respect the old dog on the block."
"This beer goes down well. I find myself detecting new flavors with each sip. The folks at ESB have made this year after year since 1985 with good reason; it is a deliciously drinkable beverage. It will not knockout Bells Winter Wheat as my favorite winter beer, but I will enjoy this 6-pack and maybe another."
"An OK winter warmer and nothing more. If I want a good version of the style I would get 2 below or an Alaskan Winter Ale."
"This beer poured a clear brown color with a thick head  light lacing. The aroma is mostly of malt with a slight touch of hops. The taste is spicy and hoppy with a nice malt background. The mouthfeel is full. This is an interesting beer that Id consider easy to drink."
"drinkability - I'm not crazy about bitter beer, someone who likes hops would like this."
"A nice ale, bracing and crisp."
"D: Overall, a good beer, but not an everyday one for me."
"This is one of the better Redhooks. Sad."
"Definetely a warmer, but probably the hoppiest warmer I've ever had. This isn't to say that it's hoppy on a grand scale, just that warmers usually don't have any hop presence at all. This is nice change of pace, and that fact that it's free of the usually burny warmer aftertaste (which often contrasts poorly against sweet malts), is a good thing."
"Winterhook Winter Ale pours a dark copper color with only a slight ring of white head around the edge from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is a mild hoppy smell. Nice hoppy flavor, a bit of caramel is in the background. A solid choice, definitely worth a try."
"Not too memorable overall. Supposedly, they use nine different malts in this brew, which is great, but they need a lot more of it. I'm not getting the complex malt profile, chocolate, and caramel as advertised."
"Nice dark amber shade and a fluffy one finger off white head that reduces down but maintains a sticky ring and lace. Aromas of raw hops and malt, caramel, and slight esters. Taste is lass sweet than anticipated, instead displaying some dry hops, earthiness, roasted malts, and burnt caramel. Considerable amount of hops reveals a stronger floral, sprucey flavor than spice and bittering characters. Much of the hop flavor falls into the finish with spices clinging to the tongue and bready, grassy notes playing with each other. Medium body and a full but slick mouthfeel on the chewy side, and a little oily on the palate. This beer focuses on hops, which is a different take on a winter warmer, but it works for me."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation."
"Bottled 10-03-06. Into a pint glass, pours a nice clear coppery amber, with a good inch head, bubbly on top, full of whitish lacing all over the glass, almost too much. Aroma is hoppy, leafy and oils, biscut malt. Eh. Taste is also a bit hoppy, I'm bored already, malts hops yay. Mouth is decent in body and carbonation, pretty drinkable beer, but was hoping for much more in a winter 'warmer.'"
"Clear reddish-copper in color with a tan 1 finger head that settled to just a film and left minimal lacing. Smells of toasted caramel malts, some faint spices (possibly cinnamon and nutmeg), and a bit of piney hops. Tastes of the toasted caramel malts, some of the aforementioned spices, and piney hops at the end. Mouthfeel is decent, carbonation is good but the body is a tad on the thin side. Drinkability is good, a decent session brew."
"D - I don't really know what else to say. I had the ESB and IPA and while not spectacular, they weren't downright bad like the Winter Warmer. At first I thought it was a bad bottle, but even after letting it sit for awhile, my opinion changed not. It's one of those that was so bad, I want to try it again just to be sure."
"This beer had a very similar smell of banana and sweet malt that their Blonde has, and furthermore the mouthfeel is very similar. Obviously they are different colors with the winter warmer being much darker, but kinda wierd."
"D: Although I was happy with it, I do have many more to try this winter and I would not be disappointed if I didn't have it again until next year."
"Overall a faint shell of what this ale used to be from 6-8 years ago. Not malty at all, just a nice dose of hops for it's saving grace."
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is copper colored with an off-white head that leaves trails of lacing on the glass. Smell is mostly of sugary malt and spices and only very slightly of grassy hops, maybe a slight citrus tang. Taste is initially sweet and spicy like the nose but has a fairly bitter, dry finish; bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a moderate amount of creamy carbonation. Overall, this is a good example of a winter warmer and a pretty drinkable beer. Not a favorite, but pretty good and worth trying."
"Pours out just plain brown in color, with a small head. The aroma was light, with hints of mossy pine. Not much else. The flavor wasn't very sweet. Mostly, it tasted fresh, soapy, and hoppy. The carbonation was slightly irritating in the mouth, but not bad. It went down pretty easy, but mostly this brew was nothing special. Nothing below average, either, but it didn't thrill me. I probably won't drink it again."
"Taste is well balanced with malt-sweetness and bitterness but no real richness of flavor. This is creamier that some of the other mass-produced winter offerings. Slight clove character. Respectable offering."
"Medium mouthfeel,slightly chewey,a bit harsh going down. Average beer not exciting,couldn't drink too many of these."
"This beer is really drinkable, I could have a few of these and be quite content. This one really took me by surprise. I was expecting a weak offering, and while its definitely not the usual winter warmer, its still a nice, good beer."
"A really nice winter ale! Perfect with a holiday dinner or a cold night beside the fire. Enjoy it at cellar temperature to get the most out of its varied flavors."
"The current bottled version has a nice, seemingly dry-hopped bite to it, but on the other hand there's also an unpleasant metallic taste. I'd still call this an improvement."
"Overall, I wouldn't have minded having another, drinkability was good. Pleasant and recommended."
"Though not as complex as other winter styles, this is an ""old faithful"". If your bar doesn't offer anything too interesting this is always a good call. I like to pair this one up with a nice side of Rye to get me through the cold weather ... it matches nicely."
"D: A very good overall drinkable winter brew. Not my favorite, but certainly good."
"The drinkability is not so great, as the spicy after taste lingers too long"
"Rather move forward from the beer than back to it. So many other options out there, I dont see myself wanting another one of these."
"Drinkability: Something to keep in mind: there are many, far better winter beers. This one's a total washout."
"Pours transparent brown with a white head. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is citrus, lots of cascades. Citrusy hops dominate the flavor, malts are there but this seems way out of balance. The mouthfeel seems quite thin. This is ok, but it just seems to be hop water."
"Overall: I am not usually a fan of Redhook stuff. That being said, this beer is good. I was surprized when I had it for the first time. I might even buy it again."
"Pours a dark brownish copper color with an off-white ring of lace that sticks to the side of the glass. Aroma is dominated by fresh hops with a faint sweet malt background and maybe even some winter spices. After the really nice aroma, I was a little let down by the lack of flavor. The taste, much like the aroma is dominated by the hops upfront with a sweet and toasted malt presence as well. Pretty good tasting brew, but it is just a little too watered down. Overall, this is an interesting enough seasonal to have again but really nothing to get exited over."
"Pours red brown with a puffy tope head. Smells of cloves, hops and some dry citrus rind odors. Quite a spicy nose and reasonably intriguing. Taste is sweet and effervescent. Tastes like cloves and sweet malt. Hops are cloying and floral. Somewhat unbalanced between malt and hops. Some menthol-like flavor in there too. Mouthfeel is quite thin for it being a winter warmer. Drinks OK, but really not anything special for the style..."
"Poured from the bottle to a bright amber color, with some carbonation, medium off-white head that lingered a while and left okay lacing. I detected the aroma of floral and citrus hops, though not real strongly, similar to an IPA. However, the taste had more of the spicy wheat flavor of a Hefe-Weizen. Thle palate was somewhat spicy, and the finish a mix between dry-bitter, and stale. It was alomost like Redhook mixed two different styles. This was a very strange beer, although not too bad overall. Hardly your typical seasonal Winter Brew though."
"D - I enjoyed this beer. It was great on a cold snowy night."
"D - Not too bad. I'd drink it again."
"A very clean and simple beer. A perfect session winter ale. No fancy spices, no super hops, just well balanced and drinkable. I could drink this all night long."
"A little disappointing, but not entirely bad. Just not what I'd expect from Redhook or from a winter warmer."
"D: Not one of my favorite seasonal beers. Flavors are sort of herky jerky and don't meld well."
"Drinkability: This winter warmer is quite drinkable and appropriate for the holidays , and has a pleasant flavor , its just not quite up there with others that iv'e tried. I am glad i tried it though."
"Before I typed this I found several listings for a Redhook brew by this name, and sure enough there have been changes: the darker and more robust offering I remember enjoying for a handful of years (more akin to their Blackhook porter in heft and mouthfeel) seems to have been retired along with the old stubby bottles, but I enjoy this new recipe just the same. For my money Winterhook is still the best offering from Redhook: too bad it isn't a year round offering!"
"D- Not too strong. Good for whenever I'd say. It isn't wonderful but I'd say it is one of the best winter beers I've had this season. Much, much better than that samual adams winter lager crap I had last week."
"The beer poured copper with an off white head. The aroma was sweet malt hops and a bit of spice. The taste was a lightly spiced malt with a hint of hops in the finish. The feel was basically dry. This was a pretty average beer, and not at all up to the basic expectations of a winter warmer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a murky mahogany color with some reddish tinge to it. Slightly vigorous pour leaves a thin finger of fizzy off-white head that quickly fades away to a light ring of white lacing. Aroma is hoppy and of sweet caramel malts, very light on the nose, slightly grainy as well. Taste starts out hoppy and slightly bitter, similar to an IPA, then transforms into a sweet and malty finish with a light bittering dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation levels, goes down smooth. Easy to drink, decent brew although a far cry from the style's normal characteristics. The hoppiness is far from overbearing or anything, the bottle reads ""assertively hopped", and it is, although this brew doesn't taste much like a winter warmer. Not enough carmel sweetness and maltiness to warm with. All around a solid beer with an overall bland character but worth a shot, but not if you're in the mood for a winter warmer."
"DA: Really not bad at all."
"This beer has been going downhill every year I've tasted it. Three years ago it was wonderful: a nice, rich, dark IPA is the only way I could describe it. It had a very cascady nose, and a nice, rich, malty body. Every year since then, it has gotten thinner, less hoppy, and less complex. It is still a good beer, but what are they doing to the recipe? Or is it something else? Redhook produces some great beer for the mass market. This is one that they shouldn't be ""watering down""."
"Aftertaste is clean but, like, who cares...there was little to start with."
"The beer is listed on BA as 6.11% at the time of reviewing this beer, but it is listed at the forecasters pub as 5.52% abv as of October of 2006. This might account for the many reviews that indicate it's not getting better with each annual brewing."
"Mouth: First thing that's noticeable is the creamy yet tingling mouthfeel. The malts are gentle up front, but the finish has a strange bitterness in the back that's a lot like the flavor of apple skins mixed with carrots. An odd combination between the fore flavors and the back that don't quite work together."
"Drinkablity: Not very close to the style guidlines but it is good and drinkable."
" Overall, this is a decent drinking beer. I would try this again."
"Notes: It may not be exceptional (a little on the thinner side for a winter beer), but definitely worthy of a six-pack in the fridge for the winter months."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and unexpectedly hoppy; some flaws but still OK"
"This one was offered to me by a friend, I usually don't drink much redhook these days but I gave her a try during a heated table-tennis match. lighter than expected with a minimal head and mildly active carbonation. Taste is of malts, perhaps some toast and a bit of peppery alcohol. Taste is very malty despite the somewhat thin mouthfeel, sort of threw me off a bit. I can see what Redhook is going for here with the roast malt flavor but I can't say I thought it was well done, the mouthfeel is too thin and undercarbonated to support the malt profile....comes off as too grainy for me. Overall try it if it's offered but don't pay for it."
"Taste had about the same. Nut, roasted malt, caramel. Thinner than a winter ale ought to be, lower alcohol content. Can drink it fairly well."
"NOTE: The 2005 bottle and label are different from the picture on the BA website."
"Very bland and thin on the palate. Leaves a funky dried walnut afterimage. I really had to work to get through this six-pack."
"all in all, if you're drinking warmers, there are better out there. but if you're stuck in macro-land, and this is your craft/micro option, go for it."
"The beer's drinkable enough, but very average otherwise. There's nothing to distinguish Winterhook from the wider range of winter seasonals."
"Winter 2005/06 release. This has long been one of my favorites from Red Hook, and this years' is probably their best ever. Pours dark brown with a lighter brown cascade flowing nicely. Smells of roated coffee and burnt toast (two things I love). The taste really put it over the top for me, though. The heavy, malty taste combined with the rich, but not too strong mouthfeel, makes this seasonal brew a winner, and certainly one to buy by the case, as putting down more than a few is really easy."
"Winter of '05 realse. Pours a clear, dark amber. Off-white creamy head one finger tall, with excellent retention. Beautiful patterns of lace cling stubbornly to the glass. The nose is not strong, but shows some dark malt and holdiay spice aromas. An odd, but not foul smell hides behind the malt, could be from wood chips or stale hops used in dry hopping...I don't know. Toasted barley and cinnamon flavor, followed by a well balanced dose of english hop bitterness. Aftertaste is hebal and tea-like, but fades gracefully. Medium body and nearly flat carbonation with scarce and tiny bubbles slowly rising north. Extra-smooth mouthfeel, easy on the eyes, and a pleasent hoppy finish; a nice winter seasonal."
"I'm surprised this beer hasn't been reviewed. Redhook East is a good brewery, and the pub serves great food. Anyway, this winter seasonal is a nice dark amber color with a fairly thick creamy head. Good lacing. It has a sweet molasses smell to it, and a fruity, cinnamon taste. Good mouthfeel, not too carbonated. A very drinkable beer."
"I actually appreciated the lighter flavor as opposed to how heavy on the malt that winter warmers can be, and this was $6 for a six, so I can see buying this again as a change up six."
"While it's not my favorite beer, I could drink a few of these in a sitting with no problem. In fact, I've been known to do just that. In fact, I may very well do that right now..."
"Crisp and tart, the 6% fries the little hairs off your tongue. If offered freebies, this is drinkable  if I have to buy, Id go with several others before this one."
"D - Good drinkability. I like it. My only complaint is a little too much sweetness that builds up in the back of the mouth. Good beer by Redhook."
"The aroma is week and hard to pinpoint. I detect a nutty prescence with some sweet caramel and citrus in the smell. The taste is dry and surprisingly hoppy. I detect a hint of cinnamon in the aftertaste mixed in with the malts. Not a bad winter beer."
"Overall, nothing to write home about. I really think some more flavorful hops would make a better brew."
"D - Pretty good but nothing to chase after with all the other great winter warmers out there."
"Overall: This ""winter"" brew is all label. Color is about right, but it lacks identity in the smell and taste and the experience is ordinary."
"Drinkability: Sure, it's highly drinkable, but not very memorable. A decent enough beer, and if I see this on sale for cheap (less than $12 for a twelve pack) I may purchase more just to have on hand a let others try."
"Pours a dark amber. Good head and lots of lace. Not much of a smell at all. Mouthfeel is medium,not much carbination. Taste is sweet and spicy, with a slight hop kick. Finish is smooth,and refreshing. Give this beer a try, I think you will find it worthy!!"
"Pours a clear, dark, reddish brown with a very small, off-white head that slowly diminishes to a tenacious film. Good lacing. The smell is strong of piney hops with some light citrus and smoke. The taste is more hops but with more of a malt presence giving it some balance. It finishes clean, has a medium body, watery texture, and very low carbonation. I think the mouthfeel is the biggest downfall of this beer, but I still found it rather enjoyable which was a pleasant surprise coming from a brewery I havent been too impressed with in the recent past. This would be a good beer to take on a long ski lift."
"cheers..."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of crystal and some light chocolate malts. It's breadlike with a mild hop aroma as well. The taste is decent. It has a smooth malty flavor that is a bit grainy and breadlike in the finish. It is slightly bitter and dry; not much of a warmer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good seasonal. It has good flavor and aroma; a fine sessions ale."
"This is my first beer from Red Hook and I am disappointed. This is not the best winter warmer that I have had. I look forward to trying their other beers."
"A real dark reddish color with a smallish head with good lacing.The smell is earthy,floral,and hoppy.The taste is a spice,malt and hop filled pleasure.The m/f is well balanced between malt and hops.This is a ggod seasonal beer and I was pleasently surprised."
"A bit of disappointment; normally, I can always depend on Redhook to produce a beer that is, if nothing else, easygoing and drinkable. But this one, while not awful, doesnt really make you want another. Not recommended."
"Poured out a red brew with a one finger off white head. Smells pretty malty with a tiny bit of hop presence.Taste is just mediocre,,pretty dry with no hardly any sweetness.Slight hop bitterness shows through lack of malt.Mouthfeel basically average. A good session drinker, nothing over the top but nothing bad either."
"Amber towards dark towards red; half a finger of head. Malt and earth smell. Taste of earth, spice, some metal - tang aftertaste with some straw and hops. Stale mouthfeel...sodapop. I don't feel inclined to have another. I think this is maybe better than this year's Wassail, which isn't saying much."
"Overall this one gets a meh."
"I think overall this one is quite drinkable. I am about half way done drinking it right now while i have been writing my review. My favorite from redhook is blackhook, but this is quite nice."
"Deep amber color and a thick sticky off-white head. Head retention is very good. The aroma is very hoppy. Floral hops and roasted malts hit the nose. The taste is rich, medium to full bodied. Floral hoppiness hit the tounge at first. The hops are mellowed out with a toastel malt. Finishes hoppy and semi-dry. A hearty brew perfect for the colder weather. One of RedHook's best beers."
"Overall, I would describe this as a miss. Certainly, this is a beer I won't be seeking out again."
"The taste is unfortunatly, restrained as well. The same malts are upfront with a touch of the spice, then there's a blank spot followed by a generic hop bitterness. Dry finish. I think the blank spot was where the body was supposed to be. Despite the light mouth its sessionable, but boring at that."
"Bottled 10/18/05"
"This is one of the easier drinking winter ales I've had, and it's taste somewhat surprised me for a winter ale. A 6.11% ABV is somewhat low for this style, in my opinion. Overall, It has a very unique, easy to enjoy flavor. I'd buy this again in the future."
"12 oz., bottled on 10/4/05 - served just above fridge temp. in a nonic. Pours a deep mahogany red with a 1 finger tan head that leaves a sheet when it recedes along with some good lacing while drinking it. Smells mostly of hops (floral, spicy, and piney) but has some caramel malt behind it. Tastes the same except for added notes of citric hops, toasted malts, and alcohol. The hops are nice but the malts need to be beefed up a bit. The mouthfeel is medium, bordering on full. A decent winter warmer for the price, I just wish the alcohol were less noticeable."
"D-Is the beer drinkable? Of course it is. Like many of us have stated before, we'd probably drink several if given the choice, but it's also not an awe-inspiring beer for the style, rather average in my opinion."
"Pours a dark brown with a little bit of head. Smell is nothing exceptional malty with a bit of hops. The tastes is a bit unique. At first its somewhat bland with a bit of sourness, after a few sips you can pin down the malts with a little bit of hops to balance, but not much. Not a strong or overpowering brew. Overall it's a good beer, it's nothing great or exceptional at all, but I will probably try it again before the season is over."
"Overall I'm sorry to say that the beer is good but not great. Would I drink it? Oh yeah. Two? Sure. As many as you've got? Probly. All I'm saying is that there are better ales out there for the money. Either pony up the extra $1 for Sierra Nevada or grab some Redhook IPA. Ok, maybe buy this one once and see if it does it for you."
"Date on bottle 100305, no best by or born on info that I could find, either on the label or the paper six pack."
"Overall impression: Nice winter seasonal - I'm always happy to see this come on tap at the local bars. Certainly not the best out there, but it is widely available and tasty."
"Fans of Sam Adam's Boston Lager will enjoy this one."
"This is a good beer overall, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to find it but I wouldn't avoid it either."
"Bottled on 9 29 04. Pours a deep ruby brown (28.9 SRM) with tan head that drops to a halo that unsuccessfully attempts to lace the Rastal sniffer. Aroma of nutty roasted malts with some fruity esters and Northern Brewer and Cascade hops is very inviting. Taste from combination of two different malts: Carmel 50/60 from England and a Munich malt provide a satisfying but some what surprizing balance for the hops (listed as 29.2 IBUs). Nice bitterness in aftertaste."
"poured a medium copper color with sparse head. Smell is mainly of malt with some dark fruitiness mixed in. Taste is of caramel, malt, and dark fruit with little hops present.. Finish if fruity with some alcohol notes. An OK beer, reminds me winter will be coming soon."
"This is really, really nice. I'll be coming back to this one, and not just for winter."
"Drinkability - this could be a great session beer for hopheads in winter. I'd have it again."
"Pours a deep cola brown, slightly hazy, and 1"" of tan head that fades fast. Smells of spicy grapefruit and raisins. Taste is very hop dominated, but there are some dark roasted malts and raisins. Mouthfeel is grainy and has relatively low levels of carbonation. Pretty robust winter beer, much better than most beers in the Redhook lineup."
"I really think this is a way above average beer. There's nothing on the market quite like it. This brew has a wonderful winter spicyness that I havn't found in any other beer. Truely a perfect compliment for a cold winter night. Like all Redhooks, this beer pours almost too clean, with a good head. But, who really cares how about a beer looks? The important thing is how this tastes. Flavors present are nutmeg and cinammon. It's too bad I can only find it during the winter."
"Overall, the balance isn't impressive but the taste is rather unique and its easy to see how appropriate this beer serves as a seasonal offering."
"This ale poured a cloudy/hazy brown color with sudsy, tan foam that settled but clung somewhat. The smell was caramel and cocoa with hints of dried fruit and hops. There was a trace of sweetness in the aroma. Overall a nice, mellow smell. The taste was richly malty with a touch of sweetness and hints of spices and with a good hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-full body and moderate carbonation. Not as full-bodied as I had hoped. This was a very respectable winter warmer, with the aroma probably its strongest aspect."
"Consumed on 20 Feb 04"
"-Oelergud"
"This is a nice Winter Ale. I particularly like the hops/malt contrast. A nice hoppy middle of the road beer that I look forward trying again soon."
"A decent brew but I would not want to have it again."
"This is an enjoyable brew...not a true sipper but a nice winter changeup...didn't check the ABV but this would seem to be in the 6.0 range..great hops burps off this..."
"Enjoy with some spicy nachos."
"Poured a nice pint at the Mellow Mushroom in Charlotte. Must have been on special on Wednesdays because the bill was less than I expected. Typical to the other winter warmers I've tried so far this season. Much more than a hint of cinnamon and spices that sparkled in the mouth (though not anything ""extra"" for the style). Thin lacing around the glass. Hard to fully judge this one, since I was trying to pay attention at my first Carolina Brewmasters meeting. Not as good as the home brewed Imperial Stout I tried later in the evening."
"Reflection: This is the first beer I've had from Red Hook that I would buy again. Great hoppy flavor, a good change up from usual winter warmers."
"Finished dry and acidic. Turned out to be quite drinkable and worth a few."
"Other comments: A nice, hoppy dark ale. Full-flavored, but a touch too bitter for a winter warmer, IMO."
"This beer poured a deep red to slightly brown color with a finger of head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was sweet, very sweet caramel with a light touch of hop. Not too bad. The flavor was well balanced between the sweet caramel and sweet grapefruit and piney hops. Where the beer lacked was in the mouthfeel. It was just too thin. Overall a nice easy sipping beer that was good to start a night. I'd have it again."
"Winterhook Winter Ale is a different sort of winter warmer, but a good one. It drinks like a relatively well-balanced IPA that's slanted toward 'made in the U.S.A.' tropical hoppiness. In other words, there's a lot to like in this 12 oz. bottle."
"12 oz. bottle pours a clear mahogany liquid, with a thick creamy off-white head. Good head retention, and lace. Citrusy hops present in the nose, along with some toasted malt. Carmel flavored slight toasted malt, followed by a pretty good amount of hop bitterness. Citrusy, and slightly floral hop flavors. Medium body, with moderate carbonation. I do not remember this being so hoppy. This really is a pretty decent beer. One of the few from Redhook that is still worth searching out. Pretty drinkable, good beer for this time of year."
"Had this on tap at Brixx Pizza,first time on tap.Poured a lighter brown almost amber color with athis head that left a thin sheet of lace,picked up a bigger than expected hop presence in the aroma some pine along with some roasted malt.Big and hoppy up front on the palate very piney and resiny with a enough of a roasted malt backbone to hold up to the hop attack making for a big,bold,well rounded brew.Very pleasntly suprised with the character of this brew,have had it before and dont remember such a hop profile."
"Drinkability- Wouldn't choose this as a winter warmer, as it really didn't warm me up, but as an IPA with a tad bit of spices makes it interesting. Definite decent beer worth a try."
"Smells wonderful, taste was a little disappointing compared to the smell but still good. This was my first Winter Warmer and I really appreciated the spiciness, it has quite a great full flavor."
"I have been trying the winterhook for the last couple of years and I have always been pretty impressed besides the fact that Redhook is often knocked for being a shitty craft brewery. This year (2004) is very similar to SN Celebration. They went a little more hoppy this year and steered away from the heavy malt and spices. It is a red copper color wiht a very nice head and lacing. The aroma had a small amount of vanilla and nutmeg, but was mostly full of hops. There was a nice fresh hopness to this beer and it was very satisfying. This may be one of the best overlooked and unappreciated winter brews out this year."
"This is an enjoyable Winter seasonal beer, but not a preference."
"The bottle is a little disappointing - there aren't any comments about how this is a special beer made with select hops for the holidays, etc, but thats no biggie. The color is nice, caramel reddish brown like a coke, and crystal clear, but the head disspates very rapidly. The aroma is very nice, with a full dose of a spicy, piney hop and a slight maltiness. The flavor is good but a bit thin - nice hop notes and a touch of malt in the middle, but the maltiness lacks depth and overtones (I hate to say it that way but that's the best I can do - it doesn't generate much feel for caramel, toffee, toastiness, etc. it just kind of sits there). Overall this is a good drinkable beer, probably a good choice on tap when nothing else ""special"" is available but not in the league with famous Christmas beers."
"Was a bit leery of what the tap lines might be like, but what the hell, when in Rome. Nice ½ inch fluff of plumed head immediately, which actually remained attenuated throughout most of the emptying, and pretty good lacing as well. Dark copper to brown hue with a dulling sheen to the whole affair. Copious malt front to nose with some spices kicking about  cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg, spruce essence perhaps. To taste, welcoming deep malt with a robust, almost scotch ale like overall profile; a touch of chestnuts roasted on an open fire toastiness too. On the whole, a pretty good offering from Redhook when I am used to uninspiring stuff from them, for the most part."
"A solid but not outstanding beer. Pours a medium dark brown carmely color with not a lot of head to speak of. Smell is more hoppy than I'd expect, due to the darker color. Nice pine scent. Also a bit of sweet malts hidden in there. Pretty tasty floral hops and a nice presence of fruity malts makes this beer pretty well balanced. Unfortunately it's a tad watery which takes away from the flavor. Very drinkable though. If the brewers stepped this one up just a few notches it could be a very good beer."
"Fairly strong piney hop aroma with a pinch of alcohol. Small khaki colored head that fades quickly to a foam coating. Pretty nice lace forms as the beer is drank. Transparent caramel brown colored beer with clouds of fine bubbles rising briskly to the surface. Hop tea flavor with a mild malt base. Maybe a pinch of biscuit malt in there. Mild bitterness picks up midway through. Light body, kind of soft and watery. Not a bad beer, goes down easy, won't be going out of my way for any."
"Pours a murky, ruby-tinged brown hue with a slightly creamy, tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, with some pine and a touch of hops lingering in the background. Palate is malty and slightly nutty upfront, quickly developing a hoppy bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. Nice, sturdy, slightly creamy body. Still, this one's a little harsh. The hoppiness is fine, but is not well-balanced."
"Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed"
"Bottom line...this is not a pleasant tasting beer. I'm still belching that pine cone flavor almost an hour after finishing the pint. My advice if you really want to try this one is not to make the mistake at buying a whole 6pk. My quest continues in finding a decent Redhook product."
"Presentation is a twelve ounce brown glass longneck with a twist-off cap. The label art is quite picturesque."
"Perhaps the best mass-market winter brew out there (better than the sierra celebration, IMHO). Some tasty stuff although I know some peeps who weren't wowed with the flavors. It's a nice chestnutty brown and has an intense taste bordering on a mild porter. Def worth a pickup (the dude at Von's only charged me 2.50 for a sixer today--maybe its on sale)."
"Toffee cookie dough malt flavors start it off. Hops come in midway to balance the light sweetness. The hops are bitter, piney, and kind of citrusy. Chewy, medium-big body. Some residual sweetness trespasses in an otherwise resiny, bitter finish. A surprisingly decent strong ale-ish beer. I was prepared to find this thing mediocre (like other Redhook beers Ive had in the past)."
"Chestnut in color with very little head and sparce lace. Hoppy on the nose with some sweet chocolate malt in the background. In the mouth the sweet, toasty malt attack is followed quickly by hop bitter. the texture is creamy. The beer finishes with some fruity notes, pronounced alcohol, and another blast of chocolate malt. a decent winter quaff."
"Pours a dark amber or is it brown what ever, small tannish head doesn't last long but laces well. Caramel malts, sweet some fruit coming thru with a touch of light floral hops in the background. Taste is malt goddness lightly spicey with a slight hop finish. Overall light for a winter warmer but it is drinkable. Mouthfeel light side of medium again little light for a warmer but it is just a Redhook after all. I would say drinkability is decent so far the only Redhook brew I have bought more then one six pack of."
"Pours a clear pale brown under a one finger off white head that settles slowly, leaving some very good lace. The nose is strong with spice - cinnamon and nutmeg to my mind. The mouth is very prickly and light. Edgy spice taste here, without much malt. A strong bitter hops finish follows, with the spice returning in the aftertaste. Interesting and enjoyable, albeit a tad watery. An off beat brew, but I like it."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a little red tint. The head is tan and stands about 1/4"" and fizzles out fairly fast. There is a mild smell of hops and malt. Maybe a little spice. The taste isn't very impressive. Pretty weak at first taste and then as it hits the back of the palate you pick up on some hop bitterness and a little sweetness. This isn't a very complex beer. The mouthfeel is poor. I don't think this beer has the right amount of carbonation for its classification. It seems to lack enough carbonation. I think this beer would be a little better if they made it a little heavier with a little more alcohol. I really wouldn't recommend it. I would rather poor myself a bells best brown anyday."
"i'd recommend grabbing something better."
"Pretty standard winter warmer. Pours a dark brown with red streaks. The smell is heavy on caramel malts and apple, hints of spice streak through. The taste is of a toffee malt and apple crust. Bread like taste with spices creep into the end, a full bodied beer than is great for those chilly nights."
"Not bad for my first winter seasonal of the year."
"Bottled, lame is a word that springs to mind. Very dissapointing for a supposed winter ale. Light choc, caramel, little hops noticable, grainy and thin, no bitterness, cola like texture. NOt really a fan of redhook at all, very bland for a winter beer, where is all the flavour????"
"No head, just a slight ring of khaki on the edge. Dark and clear amber color. Very smooth mouthfeel, with a bit of bitterness that breaks through to you. Lightly carbinated. Not too heavy at all. -Could not get any scent on this one at all (was drinking at my hangout which had become a bit smokey, when I shoved it at beerbud in frustration to see if he could catcha whiff, he said he could smell generic cola). Decent drinking brew."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Not sure what distinguishes this beverage from Red Hook's IPA. Overly hoppy thogh some malts appear midbrew to be quickly quashed by the strong hop presence. Not my cup of tea."
"No information anywhere on the bottle as to what I am about to imbibe. Winter ale. Mahogany body with a sticky lace atop. Sweet, malty caramel apple aroma. Smells very much like some barleywines I've had. Kind of thin on flavor. Subtle fruitiness to back the substantial toasted malt character. Tingly on the tongue. Not huge on flavor, so I don't know that I'd want to drink a lot of these, but it goes down fairly smooth and I certainly could drink a few. I think I'd just go after a winter seasonal that's got some more character."
"Winterhook Winter Ale was served from a 12 oz. twistoff bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a rich dark reddish copper hue, and was topped by a small but fine tan head. The nose was of moderately roasted malts accented with a subtle citrusy hop bouquet. The taste was fairly light in the roasty malt department for the style. There were some tasty flavors however, in the form of grapefruit and lemony citrus accents, and an aggressively hopped finish. I did pick up some alcohol in the aftertaste, which tainted any potential lingering pleasantries. I still would have liked more of that sharp or roasty maltiness up front. The body was decent for the style, and since this was not a huge beer, it was pretty drinkable. Overall, not a bad winter brew, but needs tweaking."
"If you frequent this site, you know that Redhook is pretty much synonymous with mediocrity. This brew, however, is solid. I liked it a lot. Not the best seasonal, per se, but a really tasty ale."
"Light brown and foamy, left alot of foamy lace. Crisp and refreshing, nice qualities for this syle beer. Very smooth and long malty center, Mild/mellow hop finish. nice balance and drinkability. Good session brew. A pleasant quaffer. Tried this one on tap. Didnt have the time to let it warm up abit in the glass."
"Beer pours a light brown with copper tint. Nice tight head sits on top, lasts through the glass. Smell is of hops and a bit of malt in there as well. Taste is decent esters predominate with hints of roasted malts, hops are in balance. The aftertaste of this brew is where it shines with an endless floral taste of willamette hops. Mouthfeel is average and it has decent carbonation, some alcohol but nothing to write home about, could be thicker. Drinkability is very good, you could drink many of these beers. Not quite what I would expect from a winter ale but a good beer nonetheless. Nothing here to offend anyone but nothing to make you crap your pants with enjoyment either."
"This beer poured a dark copper color and formed a nice, off white bubbly head that left trace lace as it subside. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops and some caramel. A flavor of malt, caramel with some hops present. The body is fairly thin for this style and the finish is a touch on the bitter side. Just not terribly impressed with this one, which is about par for this brewery."
"Overall: Thanks to BigHuge for the chance to finish off this Winter Ale before the Spring breaks through. Cheers!"
"Not a bad brew, but not ghreat either. Appearance was nice with decent head and lacing. Nice dark cramel color. Smell was mainly grape-like, but nor unpleasant. Taste was unspectacular, grape flavor came through. No major sweetness or bitterness. Light hop presence on the finish. Easy enough on the mouth and palate, but nothing special."
"The mouthfeel is good, not overly carbonated. My overall impression is that it is a decent representation of a winter ale, something you could drink while watching football."
"This clear, deep red/brown beer has a small, grayish-tan, fine, doughy head. Spots and arcs on the glass. Big pine hops in the nose, and almost a menthol note. Sweetish. The beer starts hoppy with some pepper. It turns a little watery, but there's some decent dark caramel (especially at temperature). Major pepper in the finish with lots of hops and some nice grains. This is a nice, hoppy brown."
"Clear deep red-copper with a cream colored head that quickly fades to a thin film of foam. Aroma exhibits a touch of caramel and little else. Just a bit on the boring side of good beer. Taste has a decent amount of roastiness and a touch of coffee, both pretty unexpected. Funky lingering spicy bitterness on the finish pervades the aftertaste. Strong earthiness comes out after a few sips. Mouthfeel is a bit thin as well. Drinkability is OK, but one is more than enough for me. I don't much care for this beer. I think the blackhook may have been a better choice, as I was debating between the two. I believe I chose poorly in this instance. Damn impulse purchases! Well, at least I only bought one."
"On tap poured into a Winterhook pint glass. It pours a deep brownish-red with one finger of head. There is a large amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly malty, a little sweet, with just a note of hops. The smell is a little weak on this one. The taste is fairly malty at first, with bits of pepper and nutmeg present. The finish is very hoppy. Almost no aftertaste is left behind. The mouthfeel is just a little light, but the drinkability is fairly nice. I could down a few of these on this cold winters night."
"Pours out deep clear mahogany color with a bumpy white head. Aroma is filled with cascade like hops, along with a slight caramel maltiness. Taste is a bit bland for a winter ale. Starts off with some decent floral hoppy notes. There is some malt in there somewhere too, but it never really pokes out too much - more in the mouthfeel than the taste. Finishes with some spicyness that turns into a slightly bitter yet bland cardboardy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good & full, it's too bad the taste does not really match it. Pretty drinkable stuff. Decent beer. Just decent."
"Starts off great. Change the yeast and get rid of the harsh finish and it would be a really good beer. As it is, it is unpolished. My guess is that they were going after a more marketable SNCA and just missed the mark by a bit."
"Looks good but smells wretched. The taste and smell are too hoppy and in the wrong way. Other beers taste and smell even hoppier but are much more tolerable. Something went wrong with this one. The taste was not as bad as the smell and seemed kind of average at first. As I kept drinking, however, the taste became worse. This beer needs more balance or different hops. I'm sure many people love it, but I certainly do not. I mustered up some courage and finished the glass, never to return again."
"Overall, a good Ale that I enjoyed but Sierra Nevada would be a sufficiant replacement and slighty more enjoyable!"
"Metallic red-brown body, similar to dried blood, and though I realize that might not seem appetizing, it is attractive in this case. A tight foamy tan head rises, then falls back, leaving thick lacing and rings. Strong biscuit aromas vie with some earthy herbal hops. Taste begins with a caramely malt base, which gives way to a rising roof-of-the-mouth hop tingle. Clean finish. A tad thin in mouthfeel. A smooth, easy-to-drink beer. This is not a ""fireplace sipper", not one of the big ""top off the night"" beers of the season. It is greatly suitable for the earlier parts of the winter day, from lunch thru dinner with stops in between. A pleasant find after the disappointment of this summer's Redhook Rye."
"Dark amber, almost copper in color with a frothy head and a nice lace effect. The smell is frity, kind of citrusy, Very aromatic hops were used in the making of this beer. I also get a fruity taste. Very hoppy and malted nicely. I really enjoyed this one."
"Several years ago this ale was much richer and full bodied."
"Seriously, this is the worst winter ale I've had this year for all the reasons I've stated above. I usually give a more detailed review but this beer is just not worthy."
"Starts out quite promising, pouring a dark copper, with a substantial foamy head. Smells pretty nice, also. Unfortunately, rather thin and mild (particularly for the style). Some hop bitterness, and nothing negative about the flavor. Just too ""small"" for a seasonal. Would be a decent IPA."
"Dark amber hue with a thin ring of a head, some fresh winter spices and roasted malts on the nose make for an inviting beverage. A bit thin up front, but quite tasty, roasted malts, winter spices, some orange peel and lemon notes. As she warms, some of the hop flavorings become more noticeable. Delicate and smooth, a strong old-ale, probably not, but one of the under-rated and widely available winter beverages, a great offering and a superb winter session brew."
"A good offering from Redhook. I'd drink this again."
"Notes: Not too much in this one to make me think of this as a winter brew. It's probably the best Redhook beer I've had, but it's more of a regular amber beer than a winter brew. Not one that I'd rush out to buy each year to see how it's changed."
"Pours a deep red amber with a big llasting acey off-white head. Sweet on the malts and light on the hops. The balance is spot on. Mouthfeel is very smooth. The strength barely shows through. Certainly amoung the better beers by Redhook. Not over the top in flavor, but very eaasy to drink."
"Very different from what I remember but very good."
"Pleasant and easy to drink, medium bodied."
"Winterhook is a decent beer that seemed to be a bit too off-balance to be truly enjoyable."
"Surprised to see this is an old ale...tastes more like an amber. Still, on its own, it's a good if uneventful beer, and one I might consider having in the future."
"Winterhook is just an average beer with a good smell."
"Deep clear crimson in color. Medium sized creamy and dense boned white head. Retention is good and lacing is nice. This beer has got a bit of that dry hopped West Coast hop aroma that I love. Piney, citrusy and grapefruity. There is also some slight maltiness noted on the nose. While there is a caramel malt presence noted, this year's edition has more of a West Coast hop presence....the flavor and bitterness. Grapefruity and piney. Not too bad. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated. Body about medium full. Yeah, this is an improvement over the last few years, but it's still not one I'm gonna run out and buy a 12 pack of every year."
"This beer pours a dark shade of brown with a nice head and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma was malty with caramel and some spice. The flavor reminded me a lot of Anchor Steam, with just a little more strength in the flavor. Malty and hoppy, with caramel and spices. Good winter beer."
"the new winterhook pours out a deep and dark ruby and amber colour. a thin fine head reduces to wisps of lace. gotta love the souped up hop aroma! very pine and resin like...very appealing. the taste of this new worked over winterhook is hop heavy, with a syrupy caramel malt base. this is such a huge improvement over the previous ""robust"" version that it's hard not to get a little excited. i really disliked old winterhook, but i really like this stuff. the hop taste comes off as piney, maybe dry hopped. more evergreen than citrus. more flavourful than bitter. the malt base is a bit sweet and syrupy, such as years past, but with addition of the new hop profile it's not so offending and the mouthfeel doesn't seem so slick. there seems to be a hint of spiciness, too. i applaud the major tweaks to the winterhook profile. not too bad!"
"A tawny amber body lying under a cloud of ivory foam. The head lasted and laced decenlty. The nose was mostly malty with pulpy fruit notes and a bit of spicy hop notes. Flavors are mostly of a fruity malt variety with a decent medium body and a creamy sense. Good drinkability from this nice, light old ale."
"Auburn-bronze hue, clear and brilliant, the color is very appealing. Unfortunately the head developed poorly, there was little more than dishwater bubbles that covered half of the bare beer. A very small amount of disorganized specks of lace dotted the glass as I drank it. Immediately the nose tells me two things, this is hoppy and this is not the Winterhook of last year(s). Im rather pleased with the pine aromas, undercurrents of floral, and distant hints of maltiness at the back. The bouquet has a couple layers of depth and a distinct invitation to quaff. The palate is bitter upfront, from the piney hops, a smidge of floral follows. The maltiness is a little lacking and ordinary, traces of caramel but not a lot of sweetness. A little ale fruitiness is interwoven. The finish is mildly hoppy with a pleasant piney aftertaste, some direct bitterness. Unexpectedly more-ish and surprisingly tasty especially considering Redhook does not wow me. I even got hop burps! Medium in body, a touch thin, more malt would help. The carbonation is a little low but tolerable, very drinkable and pleasant to quaff as well. The abv is low enough to have a few at a time. If Redhook sticks with this recipe then the new and improved Winterhook will be a staple in my refrigerator when winter rolls around. Six-packs are too damn cheap for you not to try; I got mine for $5.50 in Omaha."
"Nice enough (cheap) winter sessional. Like a poor-man's SN Celebration Ale, which is probably exactly what it was meant to be."
"Supposedly an improvement over years past but I don't remember if I ever had the old version. This one is certainly good and the best Redhook I've had, bar the late lamented Rye beer - not to be confused with that yellow, swillish Sunrye. Dark ruby with medium head and adequate lacing. Malts are sweet and fruity, some light elements of berries and lots of caramel. Buttery. Hops are faint and mostly in the piney, spicy aroma. I had a six-pack that was just days off the bottling line and it was remarkable. This is a couple weeks older and not quite as good. A fine winter warmer, maybe could do with a touch more hop bitterness."
"This is a drinkable winter beer that is very good. I had pretty low expectations going into this tasing and was pleasantly suprised with the result. This would not be my first choice, but it is certainly worth the effort."
"Mahogany color with a brown receding head. Low aroma of sweet malt belies the full flavor jumping out of this beer. Sweet malt flavor, yes, but surprisingly hoppy. Smooth floral hops, not biting, with definite hints of citrus and pine. The finish is adorned with spicey flavors including cinnamon and brown sugar. Very enjoyable beer."
"This has a nice little hop bite to it's initial taste, but then turns to malty. It's color was a dark amber with a tan head. The head was frothy, but then went down to a laceing of the same color. I was most inpressed with the cover up of the higher alcohol in this brew. i would have never guessed that it was almost 7%. It's a little rough around the edges on the first taste, but smooths out as you go."
"Excellent looking and an eye pleasing beer with a clear and bright light garnet color with tinges of orange. Small fruitiness in the aroma with more of it coming out as the beer warmed up, along with sweet and grassy hops. Aromas included sweet cherries, apricots and birch. The beer is a dry one, light in malt body with a biting and bitter tang and a dry, fruity finish. Light, tasty and flavorful. The dryness is an asset to this beer. Very good."
"Ruddy chestnut hue with a light mirk. Stiff, pitted, steadfast vanilla white head leaves lace. Juicy tangerine laced with mint sprigs upfront in aroma. Burnt, buttery, brown sugar sprinkled biscuit and dark toffee are secondary. Sweet cocoa undertone. Quite appetizing aromawise. Simple medium lovibond caramel initially in flavor, is superceded by assertive, pithy hop bitterness and sharp suggestion of grated cinnamon. Mellows quickly, with stately butterscotch and bittersweet marmalade notes contrasting the barbed hop character. Understated hints of tart plum surface late along with breezy, disparate dry cocoa, lending dessert like qualities. Soft on the palate, and perhaps a touch lean in body to complement the malt backbone. Finishes both buttery and burnt, with lingering diacetyl and singed biscuit tones. A flavorful, albeit raw brew with a surprising amount of character. Quite tasty, and overall a well above average winter seasonal. Has aging potential."
"Nice deep reddish brown color with a decent creamy off white head that leaves sticky sheets of lace. Fruity and citrusy aroma, smells kind of like an IPA, hoppy citrusy flavors with some caramel. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel, finishes with a sharp bitterness, much better than I remember."
"Pours a clear deep copper with a khaki colored head. Thick lacing. Aroma consists of fruity hops, grapefruit, malt and a hint of chocolate. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a mildly creamy texture. Malt meets hops in this winter offering. Citrusy grapefruit upfront with some buried caramel flavor. Nuttiness emerges toward the back. Thick piney hoppy finish. It's a decent offering and an enjoyable brew. Not sure I'd necessarily seek it out on a regular basis to purchase, but I'd consider ordering it if it were on tap at the place I was at."
"Appearance is deep copper that's clear and clean.Well displayed head that settled slowly.A nice hop aroma with a presence of fruits,malt,nuts and a bit of spruce.I was expecting more of theses same flavors in the taste, but it turned out to be a little underpowered.Mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side as well.All in all, a nice, tame seasonal that's worth a try."
"It had been years since I had a Winterhook and I don't recall at all what it tasted like and if I liked it or not. I enjoyed this one, though. A very solid beer that I will be picking up again this season."
"Clear dark amber color, nice 1/2 inch biege head that laces in vertical drips. Hoppy nose, some bits of juice and fruit. Weaker malt taste profile than I like in a Winter brew, fairly standard brown sugar and cinnamon but not holiday spicy. Hops are assertive, balsamic and slightly dry and helping the finish markedly. Body seems more viscous than previous years, I'd give it full-on medium. Comparing notes, I'd say that hops and mouthfeel are improved but that an interesting sweetness could be bumped up."
"Pours with an off-white head over clear and dark reddish liquid. Piney and herbal, citric notes abound. Taste is lightly sprucy, piney and malty. Dryness pops up right about now. Finishes syrupy yet dry with a nice stickiness to it...an interesting brew."
"Overall Impression 4: Easy drinking winter ale. Good pure flavors, hops and malt doing their thing. Its very clean and neat, but not a lot of punch for the winter season. Still, a very well crafted beer."
"Appearance: Ruby tinted with a nice sized tan head, leaving lacing around my glass fine but hey it's there. Aromatics: The cascades weigh in nicely here upfront floral and piney not bad not a lot of malt sweetness but definitely not bad the hops are nice. Flavor: Is definitely tame, low pur of caramel malt tones slightly spiced not bad at all, with what I was expecting to be a roaring hop profile was nothing at all just a mild finish of hops, disappointing but I was expecting much. Mouthfeel: Thin not much texture lacks body, smooth carbonation for a winter seasonal this is a light beer. Drinkability: Is mediocre cant' picture myself buying this ever again."
"I remember a day...sigh..."
"Has a pretty medium copper color after poured into a pint glass. Little head retention, but nice lacing that hangs around. Pleasant nose is a bit complex, but dominated by malt sweetness, hops, and a hint of woodsy spices. Medium bodied in the mouth, definitely crisp with hops. I swear that there are some kind of spices trying to reach out and bite your tongue. Dry aftertaste and definitely a belly warmer. Above average for a seasonal ale."
"This ale is a bit beyond medium but not quite full bodied. There is also a certain density to the mouthfeel that is nice. A pretty easy drinker but not what I would call a session beer. It is more of a slow end of the evening ale."
" This beer is a deep, deep ruby color, it is very clear and pours with a tan head. At first the aroma is of dark fruit, then the hops kick in a bit. The hops come to dominate the aroma, but they are not super strong either. The first taste is lightly fruity (hints of cherry). The finish is off dry, and is accompanied by a hoppiness that is complimentary to the fruit flavors. No real strong flavors that jump out at me. The hops are the dominant flavor here, but for some reason this beer tastes a tad on the weak side."
"Not my favorite winter beer. Lacks the richness and complexity of most, but is still better than in previous years."
"645"
"Color is a clearish coppery brown, medium sized head of light tan hue, fades slow to a thin puff and lace sticks in moth holed-sheets. Smell is roasted malts, somewhat hefty and heavy, sweet with solid caramel and toffee thats reminiscent of burnt cookies. Hop notes of deep pine. Mostly coming through as it warms. Taste has a good portion of sweet malts, caramel, lightly burnt, lightly earthy, hops come across late with a fairly nice bite and bitterness that lends some dried pineyness. Some spiced grab shows through in the finish along with a smidgon of alcohol thats a bit warming. Feel is medium bodied and has a light grainy texture with a hop kick in alot of the finish with a spicy note. Not bad for Redhook, I was expecting something lack luster, but the late kick this has kept me intrigued."
"Update - The 2009 vintage has now extended the pattern. This beer has nice flavors and actually looks pretty cool but lacks a strong body."
"The beer pours a limpid deep garnet color, the head impressive in size, the color a light tan, frothy in texture, as it self-destructs a sealing sheet of lace is formed. Nose is malt loaded and sweet, hints of caramel, crisp and fresh, the start is lightly sweet, the top skeletal in feel. Finish is striking in its acidity, the hops indifferent in their spiciness, very dry and lingering aftertaste. Drinkable beer, but is a bit thin-waisted for me to give it much credit."
"Tastes though it was stronger than 5.58..but the waitress had no idea!"
