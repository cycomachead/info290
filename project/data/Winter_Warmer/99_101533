Worth a try, but not really worth going back too.  I wouldn’t pass it up if offered, but I’m not seeking it out either.","Jeffreysan","Jan 02, 2015"

3,-5.7,3.5,2.75,3,3.25,3,"12 ounce bottle, stamp on bottle says best before March 31, 2014. Got this bottle from a friend 2 weeks ago so I didn't get a chance to try it fresh. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is light but nice, the brew smells like caramel and toasted malt, and light sweet spices. I think the taste is the same as the aroma, but the flavors seems stronger in the taste as compared to the weak aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonation. It's not one of the better winter warmer/spiced ales I've had, it's really low on the amount of spicing that's in this brew. Not that it's a bad beer, but I think it's a Christmas ale that doesn't have much kick to it. Maybe I'll try it again next year if I can get a single somewhere.","bluejacket74","Apr 08, 2014"

Smell is of malt, earth, and Christmas spice aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt and Christmas spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer with decent spice qualities, but nothing stands out about this one.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 19, 2014"

It was certainly tasty, but it wasn't because of what makes this style enjoyable. This was almost a simple lager. I would not get this again. Yes, I could drink this with any lunch or meal, but it's pretty boring if you're looking for a warmer. I'd like this for after working hard on a hot day.","TeamMathis","Mar 04, 2014"

The smell surprised me, especially for a Saranac and for one that wasn't even a lager: it smelled almost like a Busch light wounded soldier from the night before, or more like several all next to each other. It tasted only a little different (better) than mass produced beer (eg, Busch lite), with some faint floral and herbal notes in the aftertaste. Carbonation was just enough to make it not feel flat, which for an ale is one thing, but this beer quite frankly tastes, looks, and smells a lot more like a lager. Overall I was very disappointed, especially since I really wanted to like this one! Now don't get me wrong, I'm not ranking this with Anhueser-Busch flagship and similar products (those I would never waste time reviewing or ranking), but this is, in my opinion, a very disappointing beer. Look elsewhere for a winter/Christmas/etc beer.","ItalianPisces84","Jan 19, 2014"

It has very little smell but what smell there is pretty generic, not much different than your average mass-produced ""beer"". The mouthfeel is light with small, sharp carbonation. Taste is a bit bland for a spiced beer, but there is a slight sweetness to it that kind of reminds you of gingerbread...a little. Overall it's a fine refreshing ale but I wouldn't have branded it as a spiced Christmas product.","JudoJeff","Dec 26, 2013"
2.6,-18.2,5,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Pours from the bottle with a brilliant orange color and a full, pillowy, eggshell-white head. It's all downhill from there, though. The aroma provides dull, musty hops, some lemon rind, maybe some clove, and a little honey-like sweetness. The flavor is similarly muddled, with a combination of earthy and peppery hops flavors, some semi-tart lemon acidity, and an attempt at balance from some bready malts. The fine, prickly carbonation seems to accentuate the dull bitterness, resulting in the finish having an unpleasant mild astringency. The best-before date on the bottle is more than three months away, but this beer drinks like it is well past its intended freshness.","devilben02","Dec 26, 2013"

Rather neutral in flavor with fullish pale malts up front, turning to a somewhat oily sweet then spicy conclusion. Notes of nutmeg and peppermint sprinkles linger fairly well. Full feel is pleasant and supportive given other parameters and expectations. Decent balance in that light spicing fits a light bodied brew. In line with brewery experience in the end, predictably ok. Not really a Winter Warmer per se, yet that's as good as any other style bucket for it.","HalfFull","Nov 18, 2013"
