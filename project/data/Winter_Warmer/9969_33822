4.8,28.3,,,,,,"12 oz bottle was bottled October 11, 2014.  This beer is very well balanced, but in my opinion must be enjoyed at 60-65 degrees.  Pours a beautiful beige thick 2 finger head that stays for a while and dissipates into a thin film .  Dark black cherry color that shows some light through, but appears to have no sediment.  Smells of roasted chocolate and German style malts.  Taste at slightly over 60 degrees:  Chocolate, dark ripe fruit, very subtle English hop twang. Tastes thin and watery at fridge temp, but full flavored, rich, and creamy at (Texas) room temperature (60-65) - 8.5% ABV is barely noticeable.  Just enough carbonation.  Overall delicious English style dark winter warmer from Rahr & Sons Brewery.","nizzle8287","Nov 30, 2014"

The main flavor is the sweet, toasty malt. It isn't overly sweet but the malt is the main feature here. Some of the spices in the nose show up but are hidden. Thin mouthfeel and sticky.

Good lacing in thin sheets around the glass, nice and dark for the style. The nose wasn't especially robust but offered malty, fruity notes with mild spices like vanilla bean and nutmeg. The taste is very heavy, malty with a small hop presence leaving no real bitterness to this beer. Taste brings a brown ale quality with a big dose of raspberries in the middle. The fruit presence is concentrated and very noticeable adding a tartness to the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy, heavy and the carbonation is muted and perfect. Drinkability is up there with the best in this style, for a beer that,s 8% it was gone quickly.

Taste consistent with nose, but also some dark fruit and a roasted quality in the mix. Mouthfeel was a little thin and quite fizzy/gassy.

The aroma is typical winter warmer - lots of spice, raisins, dried apricot and dark roast malt. Those are all backed up on the tongue and with a very dry, rather bitter finish. Just the way I like it, but maybe not to everyone's taste. The body though... rather a let-down. It's very thin for this kind of beer. It should be heavier. Not a bad beer all the same and one that I'd drink again, and I reckon it might benefit from some careful cellaring for a year or two.","omnigrits","May 06, 2009"
2.78,-25.7,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Verdict: To be frank, I'm a little confused by this beer. Rahr's website list this as full-bodied, and that's certainly what you'd expect from a Winter Warmer, but the body just fails to measure up. So while it's certainly not a bad beer, it's not a particularly good one either.","BeanBone","Mar 27, 2009"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"I remember not liking this beer as much when I tried it on-tap, but the flavor profile is quite good out of the bottle. Dusty chocolate intermixes with holiday spices and raw, leafy hop notes. Alcoholic warmth and toasted, nutty malts hit the back of the palate. A bit unbalanced towards the finish, but this is a damn tasty winter warmer. Mouthfeel is crisp and highly carbonated, with a drying finish that thins out an otherwise medium body. Good beer, and a candidate for aging -- I could see myself enjoying this beer even more after a few years in the cellar to allow the hops and booziness to mellow just a bit. Well done, Rahr & Sons.","wagenvolks","Mar 11, 2009"
3.89,4,4,2.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours black with reddish tinge and a thick beige head. Roasted malt and slight hop aroma. Hop flavor up front with sweet Chocolate roasted malt flavor followed by hop bitterness in the finish. Good balance between sweet malt and hops.

4.03,7.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Roasty malts are the main show in the flavor as well. Toasty maltiness, high carbonation and hop bitterness are aplenty to help balance it out. Fruitiness nearly dissapears in the tasting. Has a nice creamy, fresh feel to it. A nice job balancing winter warmer heartiness and alcohol with smoothness and drinkability. I do believe this is my favorite offering from Rahr, I will buy this again next winter!","twiggamortis420","Jan 19, 2009"

A very nice, well-balanced winter warmer. Not heavy-handed or faint of heart, this really comes across well overall. And at almost 8% ABV, the high alcohol is masked remarkably well. This could almost be sessionable. Well done here.","Atlas1","Dec 01, 2008"

No lacing left in the glass. Taste is of light sweets with malts. Very little carbonation and light on the tounge. Very drinkable and I bet is great on draft. Would rate this higher if had a little more flavor. Quite enjoyable given the higher %.","lonestar4lunch","Mar 12, 2007"

4.2,12.3,4,4,4,4,5,"It pours out almost black with a thin tan head that is here & gone. The smell is almost coffee-like with notes of spice - nutmeg & a hint of cinnamon. The taste is much more roasted than I expected for a winter warmer. It is almost a cross between a coffee porter and a warmer. It has that wassal-like spice of a warmer overlaying the basic dark roast of the malt. The mouthfeel is creamy but light. The lightness makes it much more ""refreshing"" than you'd expect of a beer of this color and flavor intensity. The drinkability is great. I had this at the brewery for my first and quickly returned to the sample bar for my second. I would have kept on had they not floated the keg. Fritz has created an interesting twist on a classic style & executed with his usual quality & style. A great warmer!","roblowther","Jan 08, 2007"

3.36,-10.2,4,3,3,4,4,"Alright, not best Winter Warmer. Enjoyable but could be stronger or more complex. It just doesnt do much. Rahr needs to assert itself as something other than just that local brewery from Fort Worth.","MrHungryMonkey","Dec 16, 2006"

2.56,-31.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours out a dark brown, almost purple, with ruby hues. As with all Rahr beers, the head retention isn't there. Head starts off small and in seconds, is just a ring. No lacing. Smells of artificial cherry, from the toasty malts, roastiness, alcohol and a bit of grain. Flavor is at first roasted malt, which leads into some slight fruitiness: mostly apple and pear. Not entirely unlike their lagers, it seems. I get a little chocolate out of this. LITTLE. Finishes a bit too clean and watery for my tastes. Strange, but it has a bit of a brothy flavor to it. Where's the alcohol? Mouthfeel is slightly tingly, which is a good thing, but this is entirely too thin, especially considering the high abv. I'm not crazy over this, but it's not a drain-pour neither. This seemed to have more character on tap, but nevertheless, this is way too simple and thin, which is dangerous considering the alcohol content.","goochpunch","Dec 09, 2006"
4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a dark mahogany color with ruby highlights and a short creamy head. Nose is toasted malt along with a fainter nuttiness and bit of chocolate in the background.

4.22,12.8,3,3.5,4.5,4,5,"Rahr's winter warmer is a bit darker than the others I've had. It is a mirky almost-black beer with little head and only a light roasty chacolate aroma. At first this beer offers up mellow ale fruitiness, and hop bitterness that is quickly overtaken by intense caramel, that morphs into light chocolate. The sweetness only lasts a few seconds before light roasted flavor is overtaken by what seems to be a Rahr signature, a light grain astingency that I fortunately find pleasing. Aftertaste is of very light tobacco. This an intersting brew and I must give Rahr props for hiding all the alcohol here without a trace. Mouthfeel is light and creamy with low carbonation.","JudgeRoughneck","0"
