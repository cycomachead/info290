The after-taste is all stout- chocolatey and vaguely coffee-like, but the mouthfeel is light and the head lackluster. The color of the beer itself is a very dark red, and it tastes just like it looks. Overall, it's a very good beer for getting drunk; I was gone faster than I anticipated, and the taste was in all honesty above average. Great beer to buy on sale, but not something to look for, in my opinion.","schnauzeborne","Jun 27, 2013"

The taste offers more of the roast, chocolate, and fruits from the nose, along with a solid boozy kick and some earthy malts on the finish. The mouthfeel seems a bit too light for the booze factor that the flavor offers, and the drinkability is good.

Medium-bodied, lots of carbonation and churn in the mouth, given this still glues itself to the palate. Loaded with chocolate, cocoa flavors, very dominant, the caramel and toffee a clear second. The breakfast breads and doughiness counterbalanced by orange zest and tea leaves. Pinch of cinnamon powder.

The taste brings in more of the same, along with ginger, nutmeg, and orange peel. The last one, though, provides an awful lot of citrus-rind-y bitterness given the small amount. This, though, does not hurt things too much. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a pretty solid brown, though the spices start to become a bit much after a while. Not too much, thankfully, but it starts to grate on ya.

Not much lacing clings to the glass, more like swaths of pasty residue. Still, it's an attractive beer. Smell: Warm notes of chocolate, a few strands of honey, caramel, some enjoyably raspy hop undertones; smells like a brown ale should, just with more bulk. In fact, this simply smells like a bigger version of Lost Coast's excellent Downtown Brown. Taste: The use of Saaz hops (typically used for pilsners) is noticeable right away on the tip of my palate, mildly peppery, followed by a steep drop into dark chocolate, and some hints of powdered sugar; the finish flows back to the hops, unique for a brown ale, spicy, even tangy.

This beer has notes of sweet plum, fig. There is a mix between spicy hop notes (with a bit of citrus character thrown into the mix) and a bit of sharp carbonation that helps to balance the fruity sweet character. The finish has a light bitterness and a hint of lingering roasted astringency. As the beer warms up a bit the roasted notes begin to become more noticeable. This beer is nicely drinkable, and it is complex enough that the flavor keeps me intrigued throughout the drinking experience; from the fruit to the roast malt to the American hop notes.

It has a rich and roasted crystal malt scent with a mild hop aroma. It is smooth and creamy. The taste is good. It has a really sweet and toastey ""brown ale"" flavor that boasts of crystal, victory, and roasted barley. It is sweeter than most, but it goes down easy. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good ""American"" brown ale. It is sweeter than the Euro version and not as dry. It has good aroma and flavor; a good drinker.","WesWes","Beers"

Aroma is sweet grain husks with slight hops presence. Taste is pleasantly grainy up front, a slight yet notable hops bite, with a lingering presence coating the mouth. Better than I expected. Mouthfeel is good, maybe a bit thin, and drinkability is excellent. A brown worth checking out.","ppoitras","Feb 12, 2005"
4.17,12.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Pours into the imperial pint glass a very deep red with some brown and has a 1 finger off-white head that reduces to a thin blanket, leaving minimal lacing. The beer looks unfiltered when held to the light. Smell is of hop spiciness, dark fruit, molasses, chocolate, and caramel with a hint of tropical fruit. Hops taste spicy and citric (grapefruit) with a nice bitterness, while the malts contribute caramel, chocolate, molasses, and a little bit of coffee. The flavors become more pronounced as the beer warms. The beer coats the mouth well, feels fairly thick, and leaves a warming sensation (6.5%, according to the bottle). I could easily make this a session beer on a winter night.","mmmbeer","Feb 08, 2005"
3.9,4.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a rich mahogany with some nice ruby highlights when the light hits it. Nice 2 finger light khaki head that lingers and laces well. Smell is of cocoa, some light spice with a hint of bitterness from coffee or burnt sugar. Taste is nice with a rich cocoa taste with just enough of the burnt sugar and coffee backing it up to keep the beer from being sweet. No really hoppyness, but finishes pretty dry maybe due to the roasted malts giving it a bit of bitterness. Nice carbonation and medium to full mouthfeel. Drinkability is a bit above average. I would have this again and make it a once and a while beer, but its not something I could have more than one of once in a while. While it was tasty it was just a bit rich to consume that often","TinusTime","Feb 01, 2005"
4.25,14.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The rich, cocoa-ish flavor of Lost Coast's Winterbraun should be welcome at any time of year! It's dark chestnut body appears a clear burgundy when held to the light, and its creamy tan cap holds fairly well before dropping to a razor thin lid. The aroma is somewhat subdued, but wafts of cocoa, caramel, and even some very-mild background hops appear. Its smooth and creamy, medium-full body accentuates its maltiness which is caramelish, cocoa-like, and mildly fruity (raisins, fig). It's laced with low-key hop flavors; and balanced by a restrained bitterness that let's the malt shine through, yet still finish dry. Quite nice!","NeroFiddled","Jan 25, 2005"

It tastes malty with a little chocolate. There is a little sweetness to it also. It goes down relatively smooth. There might be just a little too much carbonation. It leaves a nutty aftertaste. I think I could probably drink a few of there beers, but after a little while, I would probably desire something a bit more robust. Defianatley worth a try though.","OStrungT","Jan 05, 2005"

The head was about an inch thick, off white in color, and did not hang around for too long. The aroma was roasty malt with notes of coffee and chocolate. The taste was like a thinned out porter, sweet and roasty with toffee, chocolate, and a touch of weak coffee. Hops were quite low in bitterness and mostly lurking in the background. Despite the lack of complexity, the alcohol was quite well hidden, and the beer was much easier to drink than its strength suggested.","rajendra82","Dec 22, 2004"

It's not too thin to be a winter beer, but it's not so thick that you struggle to get through it. I found this quite interesting, and it will encourage me to try other beers from this brewery. Disregard the awful label, as it looks like a cheap satire of neo-cubism and is probably unaware of it own ugliness.","99bottles","Dec 13, 2004"

This is a beer that would be enjoyable most of the year if it was available. I bought this six pack on a cold, foggy, overall shitty day, and the next day it was sunny and fairly warm. Both were great days for Winterbraun. There is just a little too much carbonation hitting my tongue to make this more than just a good beer, but it is a welcome change-up in the winter seasonal selection. A nice switch from it's base recipe, Downtown Brown. One last thing- my bottle says 6.5% abv., not 5.","germaniac","Dec 13, 2004"

Toward the finish there is a sugary, sweet taste - the reviewer before me called it a cakeiness, and i would agree. Some subtle spicing too toward the end. Overall nicely balanced.

Cinnamon and nutmeg dance around, but not as pronounced as an Anchor OSA, but well on the way to it.Mellow smooth chocolate malt washes over and lingers during the aftertaste. Pushes the limits of a brown ale, borders on an American Porter along the lines of Anchor, and reminds me alot of Anchor OSA. A real treat to find in Ft. Pierce.

Almost like a porter that way. There's some great hop flavors that add depth to it as well. Seemingly a little citric and piney, but they come off a little differntly in this beer surrounded by the brown/porter characteristics. Mouthfeel is creamy to an extent.

Smell is sweet with a faint roasted aroma. Taste is mostly sweet with some nice roasted notes--milk chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel is thinner than I would like in a winter brew, however there is a very nice crisp bite to every sip from the carbonation which disguises what hops may be present.
