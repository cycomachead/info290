It has the color of iced tea. Smells like Coca-Cola: sweet, some ripened fruit, raisins, vanilla. The taste is a real let-down: sweet, a bit malty, some more vanilla. The alcohol is well hidden, but it tastes like flat coke mixed with some orange soda. I'm willing to try it again as this may be an old bottle.","kaufmaal","Jan 07, 2014"
2.35,-38,3,3,2,2.5,2,"Truly a let down. After seeing the high reviews on BA, I had very high expectations for this brew. It poured with little to no head (maybe due to a bad pour) and the color was fine, but nothing particularly appealing. I drank this out of a Perfect Pint glass, but didn't really experience much nose on the beer after pouring (related to my imperfect pour, perhaps?) But the taste was the biggest disappointment - I can only compare it to flat soda. Sweet, with little carbonation and just a mediocre sugary taste.

Very slight head formation on pouring that disappears quickly, little carbonation. Aroma of dark fruit and sweet malt.

The flavor is now what was expected...intense sweetness to begin with (nearly sugary), followed with a bit of booze and enough balance to even things out. Some gristy, malty characteristics.

It's a deep amber color with a small head. The smell is sweet and earthy. It tastes sweet with just a little alcohol burn. The alcohol is hidden here in my opinion. I detect sweet fruit with a truckload of malt. I find this beer pretty tasty for the style. Not my favorite style but this one is pretty nice. Maybe one of the best winter warmers I've tried so far.

Tastes very fruity, with a sherry like component that makes itself known now and again. Spicy and malty as well and altogether rich and fruitcake-like. Very smooth and pleasant to drink.

Wow this beer is much more complicated than I had originally thought. Taste had lots of dark fruit, cocoa, raisins, alcohol, and a bit of molasses. It had a certain red wine character to it as well. Mouthfeel was slick and creamy, without much hop presence. One bottle of this is damn easy to drink, though more than one, and the alcohol would be hitting me for sure.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly creamy.

Very sweet on the nose really. No hops detected. Sweet to tart plums and berries, to which much of the entire sip is engulfed in the fruit. Nothing but fruit really until the swallow to which soem alcohol and drying come through. Not much carbonation at all, but most is wrapped up in the alcohol of it. it's a tasty brew, but judging by previous reviews, it's identity seems to be a bit ""lost"" in teh fact that most warmers I've had contain some sort of spice, to which this one doesn't have except maybe a hint of coriander.

This would make it three years old (presuming the datestamp was correct, which it might not have been) and could account for why mine was so flat. I will publish this anyway.* This beer pours a dark brown color with little to no head. There seems to be very little carbonation as well, but there is a strange veil-like ring of bubbles floating on top in the glass. The smell is large and dense. Mostly of dark malts and grains, but a bit of candided fruits as well. Many more flavors than I would expect to find in a Winter Warmer. The most striking characteristic about this beer is how flat it is, there is no carbonation whatsoever. It goes down almost like a juice, with lots of different flavors crowding the tongue. Lots of dates, raisins and molasses initially. Goes down very easy because of this, and it would not be hard to go overboard with this brew. Terrific for a winter warmer!","Toddv29424","Feb 06, 2007"

The taste is unexpected to say the least. Starts rounded and toasty, but rapidly turns quite bitter and unpleasant. Mostly an herbal sourness that develops out-of-control diacetyl and phenols in the finish. Medium-sticky body with surprisingly lively carbonation for the age.

I get some peppery alcohol on the finish. The beer is good and has some good flavor meshing, but the heat on the finish keeps it a sipper and drops the drinkability a bit, although I find it suitable for the style.

The nose is very complex, with caramel apples being the biggest element, but it also features some spices and quince. The taste is quite nice for wintertime: sweet caramel first off, with tart fruits at the mid-palate and spices in the finish.

Despite the presence of sweet fruit and candy-like flavors, a bit of sour bite also kicks in, keeping the entire affair from becoming cloying. The mouthfeel could be slightly chunkier, but it's easy to overlook in light of the delightful smell and taste. It's certainly not a session beer, but it's quite drinkable for a beer of its style.

This sweet, fruity malty brew is rich in flavor and somewhat oily in texture. Flavors of toffee, prune juice, ripe pears and candy apples are quite distinct.

4.55,20.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Dark ruby coloured with a strong toffee/caramel aroma. Strong on maltiness, fruitiness, and sherry notes; warming, Christmas-pudding-like. A hearty beer to savour on a cold night. Enjoyed to its full potential yesterday evening at a snowbound Spuyten Duyvil, Brooklyn.","Imbiber","Dec 06, 2003"
3.97,4.7,3.5,4,4,4,4," This brew is big and bold with a whole lot of flavor and complexity. Sweet fruits are subtle, and the thick molasses flavor is nice. Some spices are in there as well to give it that winter feeling. Alcohol is kept under control, but the warming effect is excellent. It is very smooth, and i found it to be a very nice brew to come in from the cold to. I don't know if this would be my choice for a winter session beer, but I could sure sip on one or two every now and then.","ElGuapo","Dec 04, 2003"

2.31,-39.1,3.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,"Dark ruby brown with absolutely no head or lacing. Pungeant alcohol and caramel aroma. Thick and syrupy body with a strong plum and sherry flavor. Even sipping this one made it difficult to drink. Either this does not age well or I just don't like it. The finish is strong alcohol and is a little oily. Not impressed at all with this one.","Dogbrick","Oct 16, 2003"
4.42,16.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A long-standing bottle pours a clear, deep mahogany body with crimson and orange highlights beneath a thin collar of creamy off-white foam. There's very little head (very British), but the soft and smooth mouthfeel more than makes up for that. It has a very fine, low-level, natural carbonation and medium/full body that work together to give it an impressive mouthfeel! The nose is lightly vinous with dark fruit (plum, cherry, a mild note of currant) and alcohol; but reveals some caramel with further investigation. The flavor is less fruity than the nose suggests; but still offers rich, juicy fruit (mainly cherry) wrapped in caramel and light cocoa with an underlying bitterness. It finishes dry with some residual fruit and caramel that slowly dissolves to reveal the wide bitterness and drying alcohol beneath. It's very well balanced; and the alcohol gives a pleasant warmth on the tongue, but never becomes more than secondary. Fairly rich and complex. Quite nice!","NeroFiddled","Aug 06, 2003"
3.41,-10,2.5,4,3.5,4,2.5,"This beer pours a slightly hazy medium dark brown/red with a tightly clingy off white very small head. The mouthfeel is very full and hearty almost meaty- sort of flat. The smell is toffee like malt and a portlike sweet alcohol. The taste is tealike piney and nutty with a slight allspice with a slightly portlike character. This is a pretty good beer in small quantities-very portlike.","fattyre","May 01, 2003"
4.29,13.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Many years ago, I had the greatest fortune to attend a tour of Harveys Brewery, a gorgeous picturesque classic Victorian Tower Brewery on the banks of the oft flooded River Ouse in Lewes. And this beer, just like the tour, and many of their other beers, does not disappoint. It is so strange to think that this beer has traveled all the way to the West Coast. A little bit of England in my Long Beach Apartment. Merry Christmas!","TheLongBeachBum","Feb 28, 2003"

3.25,-14.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours clear ruby, with a minimal head and non-existant lace. Very small amount of carbonation present. Strong, vinous aroma - fruits like raisin, plum, caramel malts, and alcohol all tickle the nostrils. Flavor is quite sweet, sugary, caramel, and underlying alcohol, along with a mild bitterness in the back that was very subtle. Mouthfeel was buttery and thick. Alcohol is warming towards the end of the small bottle.","goz","Jan 13, 2003"
4.16,9.8,3,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Murky, mud brown, topped by a thin off white head. Plum - like fruity esters, chocolate, & mellow biscuit combined with smooth dark caramel sweetness in aroma. Light impression of spicy figs. Mild diacetyl. Slight earthy Fuggles hop nose rounds the aroma out. Lightly burnt raisiny sweetness upfront. Prunes and carob laced sweetness dominate the flavor profile, w/ notes of black pepper and biscuit providing a dry contrast. Mildly vinous sherryish notes emerge late. Lightly bittered, but hopped sufficiently to offset malt sweetness for excellent drinkability. Moderate in body and relatively low in carbonation. Semi - stagnant, full and smooth in mouthfeel. Finishes with molasses sweetness briefly lingering. A flavorful, but not overly busy strong ale. Tasty and somewhat of a tease in the 275 ml bottle. A bomber would've been appreciated.","marc77","Dec 23, 2002"

4.59,21.1,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had this the night before, I thnk it was a 2000. An exceptional christmas ale. Very little carbonation but a rough pour will get you a nice lasting head. The aroma is wonderfull, full of rich cherry and barry fruityness with a strong caramel malt background. Just wonderfull. Flavor has a sweet and extrmemly complex maltyness, with more fruit, well balanced by the alcohol and just enough hop bitterness. Stong raisen and plum notes, almost like a nice thick bock, bit woith the complex esters of an ale. An excellent well balanced beer. Probably my favorite Christmas ale and probably ranks in the top 5 of best aromas in a beer for me.","nathi","Nov 23, 2002"

2.9,-23.5,3,3,3,3,2.5,"A lot better than the Elizabethan ale, quite a raisiny syrup flavour, which i think is associated with most Harveys brews, but this doesn't go too over the top and it least it has a bit of spice to it, which adds a bit to the dimention of the beer overall, but still a little to sweet in my eyes.","rastaman","Aug 01, 2002"
4.47,17.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: Close to a stock ale or strong ale from centuries past this brew is indeed a well fortified brew of body, strength and complexity. The most impressive winter seasonal I have had from the UK that is available state side.","Jason","Apr 25, 2002"
