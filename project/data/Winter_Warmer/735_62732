Light nose of dark fruit (figs) over light spice (cinnamon, ginger) with notes of burnt molasses.  As it warms, light alcohol notes are noted with a bourbon quality.  Almost light medium body with a bit of smooth texture.  Slightly below normal carbonation with little effervescence in the finish.   The flavor profile is somewhat intense, quite complex and very well balanced.  It begins with a wisp of fig that flows into a light sweet molasses with a burnt character.  In the middle, these yield to the spices that impart a mild spicy bitterness.  The finish is a slow fade of bitterness to caramel sweetness.  As the sweetness fades, a slightly astringent aftertaste lingers of ginger over light cinnamon.  The 6.9% alcohol is totally hidden.","tillmac62","Dec 15, 2014"

The somewhat coffee-gingerbread like smell is slightly bitter, but malty, with hints of molasses.  As noses go, it isn’t that complex.  It starts off sweet, but moves toward the the bitter side of the spectrum.  Despite this, it’s balanced, and doesn’t overwhelm the palate with bitterness.  The mouthfeel is amazingly balanced, and doesn’t actually feel as heavy as it looks.  The flavors are of nutmeg, clove, smoke, espresso, and touch of fruitness. The malt is also strong, giving off flavors of burnt caramel, molasses, and burned sugars.  The finish channels a lot of the espresso and earthiness, and finishes somewhat like dark chocolate on the palate.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Dec 08, 2014"

Nose of chocolate, cinnamon, sweet malts of brown sugar, toast, and some allspice.  Flavors follow the nose with a brown sugar and cinnamon flavor hitting up front, and a light allspice flavor knocking on the back.  Malt gives this spiced ale some good balance, although at times the cinnamon is a bit heavy handed.  Nice mouth feel, very smooth yet coating with a light bitter aftertaste from spices.

What bitterness is in here is balanced out by a brown sugary middle and a drying spicy finish that may include anise and clove. A darker take on the winter warmer, it's rich and satisfying in the feel, very full bodied and lightly carbonated. Surprised how drinkable it is, which is how I got wasted on it in the first place.

3.75,8.1,,,,,,"Poured out of a 12oz can into a pint glass. Fireside chat pours a dark molasses brown with a prominent off white head about two fingers I length. It leaves a light lacing with a head that dissipates quickly. Smell is an upfront sticky sweetness with a hard spice undertone. Heavy clove and nutmeg with a molasses finish. Taste is of upfront spice and molds into a nice sweetness, in the middle I'm picking up aged fruit, dried figs or currants with a light alcohol astringent at the end (not at all bad for a 7.9% beer). Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy with a mild carbonation that I feel really suits the style. Overall this is the first beer in the ""winter warmer"" category I have ever tried and I will be returning! A very smooth spiced beer that won't overpower.","Kimchi270","Oct 16, 2014"

3.88,11.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce can in to tulip glass, canned on 10/14/2013. Pours lightly cloudy dark ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big brown sugar, molasses, raisin, prune, ginger, cinnamon, clove, dark bread, light roast, toast, and herbal earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity of malt, yeast, and spice notes; with good strength. Strength of spices is a bit too much in the nose. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, cinnamon, ginger, clove, brown bread, light coffee, toast, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, cinnamon, clove, ginger, brown bread, light coffee, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice winter warmer style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt and spice flavors; and very smooth sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2014"

Taste also is akin to British Christmas pudding..fruity,malty,dark,nutty absolutely a gem!

3.7,6.6,3.5,4,3.75,3.25,3.5,"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, opaque, sediment filled chestnut coloring with amber highlights and a dense, creamy, half inch of cream colored head that slowly settles into a filmy surface coat. Aromas of ginger, roast, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pine tassel, candied sugar, bread, and booze. Dynamic and layered nose. Flavors are heavy and roasted forward, with a blast of caramel, dark, blended with an array of holiday spices, such as the cinnamon and nutmeg. The initial burst of flavor lightens rapidly, and there is a solid spice component that remains, slightly overpowering. A light, somewhat watered down body in mouth, with a solid spice linger into the aftertaste, giving a feel of warm cinnamon and cider. That shifts to a tangy sweetness that is cloying through to the finish, with a slightly astringent feel, as well. This one has it's ups and downs; tasty, but could be tightened up in a couple of spots.","GarthDanielson","Nov 28, 2013"

Some caramel malt base as well. A lot thicker than expected, moderate carbonation and fairly oily coating the palate. Very interesting with this one managing to have many of the same flavors as others in the class but the overall flavors and body make it different and therefore memorable.","kylehay2004","Mar 18, 2013"

In my opinion an awesome brew for cold winter morning with breakfast or cold winter nights sitting by the fire enjoying some sweets and of course good conversation. A really good brew.

The taste has both of those components, some toasted malt, and citric hops. A bit too heavy on the spices. It's a pretty solid beer with a pleasantly light and clean body--I really like the dry ending, since I find some Winter Warmers very sticky and unintegrated.

The aroma is rather spicy and typical of a winter warmer with sweet toffee notes. The flavor is a little spice heavy but not terribly so. Nutmeg and allspice are most prominent. This is backed up by a sweet English toffee malt character. Smooth on the mouthfeel with medium-full body and only slight syrupiness, not too much given the ABV. Slight alcohol warmth.

There’s a lot of English character in the caramel/toffee malt flavor. Not much in the way of hops, though some of the spice could be masking it for me. The flavor is a bit odd, but it works, at times. A fair bit of cola flavor hurts things. Mouthfeel is a bit effervescent and thin for the abv but not bad.

There is some sediment/floating debris in the glass. Smells of dark fruits, cranberry, winter spices (cinnamon/clove), and fruitcake. This actually smells very good to me. Taste is of fruitcake with candied fruit/rinds, cranberry sauce, and the spices I mentioned in the smell. The taste is not as good as the smell. There is almost a medicinal aspect to the taste. Beer has low carbonation and it's somewhat hard to drink down due to the medicine tastes I am getting. Overall, I had this beer back in December and it was a lot better then.

3.45,-0.6,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep chestnut brown color with a tight, dense khaki colored head, which settles into a light cap with some sticky lacing. The aroma is of brown sugar and spices. The spices seem to be nutmeg and cinnamon, perhaps some ginger. I want to say I pick up some vanilla as well. The flavor starts off with a nice mellow chocolate flavor but is quickly overwhelmed with a strong lemon and tea like flavor. It has a sour berry thing going on and the spice that I picked up in the nose went in hiding. No artifical flavor which is a plus. The feel is creamy yet has quite active carbonation. The beer has a moderate body and is mostly sour throughout. The ABV is well hidden but doesn't need to be as high considering the body. It is not a bad beer but I dinged it a bit because of the style. I feel that it lacks on the malty richness for the style and is way too sour for the style. I will have no issues drinking the rest of the 6 pack.","Gmann","Nov 24, 2010"
2.98,-14.1,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Pours a pretty chestnut brown with a finger's worth of creamy tan head. Aroma of sweet dark and caramel malt, some notes of holiday spice, and a whiff of alcohol. Palate is malty up front with a touch of caramel sweetness. A bit of bittersweet chocolate and holiday spices come through before the swallow. Notes of clove, allspice, and/or nutmeg are present. Finish is clean, with just a touch of warmth from the alcohol. Body is a little thin for a beer of this strength.","ElGordo","Nov 24, 2010"

Quite attractive in the design, and with a typically rather likable profile as with the other 21st Amendment brews, it sure comes as a bit of a hefty sour surprise. If one is not warned about that profile, and then one does not like the spiced sourness it is bound to disappoint.

Fine even speckled lacing sticks to the glass. Aroma has a dark roasty cocoa accent with the dark roasted malts used, hints of subtle spices added as well a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg coated with honey glaze. Herbal/mild citrus hops in the background I see the beer actually clocks in at 45 IBUs, I wouldn't have estimated it being that high. Flavor has dark roasted malts cocoa rustic dark breadiness, herbal citric hops with spices running through. A nice tartness comes through the middle of it almost has some orange peel characteristics. Ample bitterness amongst the malts and spice additions, a nice complex canned ale perfect for the colder weather. Mouthfeel is medium bodied dry bitter finish from the spices and moderate hop dose, carbonation is moderate tickles the throat a good bit but also carries the spices across the palate nicely. Drinkability overall, I'm glad I grabbed a six of this for $9.99 it will last me throughout the winter months.
