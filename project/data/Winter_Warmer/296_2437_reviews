"General: Deliciosa cerveza de sabor complejo, no apta para principiantes.,"

"A nice winter warmer, probably one of the best beers from St. Peter's."
""
"There is an (for me at least) rather uncomfortable after taste dominating here. I don't know whether it's the date or perhaps the liquorice. Safe to say, this is not my cup of....eh....glass of beer."
"Poured from bottle, black opaque with low beige head. Aroma is full and complex, caramel, butterscotch, coffee, and some chocolate. Taste is sweet, medium malt body and a sweet sour finish. Notes of caramel, coffee, chocolate and liqourice."

"A wonderful ale."
"(4.25) D: This is a very well balanced and smooth winter ale (possibly more porter-like) with complexity and an assortment of flavour. Definitely worth a try, if not for the medicine bottle shape."
""

"Complex and layered. Powerful nose of coffee and chocolate in balance. Flavour leads with smack of toffee with enduring notes of burnt coffee, salted chocolate and malt. At times struggles to conceal ample alcohol content. Feel of a traditional ale with pleasant after-taste that holds complexity in balance."
""
"Overall a good ale to warm you up on a cold winter night."
"Overall, I’m not exactly sure what is overly winter-y about this beer, but I did enjoy it and think it would taste great paired with a warm winter meal."
"Overall: For about four bucks, this beer was a blessing. When i go back I will pick up two more while the season is kicking. Drink up and enjoy, Salud!"

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown/black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, caramel, and some dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a candied dark fruit flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I think it tastes better than it smells."

"Overall: really fits the bill - a perfect winter beer - roasted and warming, not too sweet; to be had in a mountain chalet surrounded by snow!"
""
""
""
"*This is a beer that I very much believes needs to be paired with food. Spicy chilli, smoked fish, BBQ with plenty of greens, korma, and shepherd's pie all come to mind as great companions."
"Mild aroma of roasted malts with coffee tones. The flavour follows suit with a more robust malt spectrum. Roasted and toasted malt sweetness with hints of chocolate and coffee. Well balanced with a sweet finish and the 6.5% ABV is completely hidden. None of the spice elements that are common in North American Winter Warmers, but a pleasure to drink."
""
"This pours dark to almost black with ruby around the edges. Light does not pass through it. I did not have the head retention that was listed previously, probably due to being from bottle as opposed from tap. Surprisingly sweet up front with powerful malt on the back. A classic winter warmer style. This whole beer rings of ""old school"" The nose has sweet almost bubblegum notes, similiar to a wheat beer. The body is all ale though. I haven't had too many of this brewery's beers, but this is definitely one to remember and try next holiday season. One or two or a snowy night would be very pleasant."
"O - expecting a very spicy warm ale, surprised to get this big bold malty treat but a little reading tells me that this is common in the english style, very 'chocolate stout' in my opinion, very tasty"
"Notes: For all the world this reminds me of a BSDA. This is dark, slightly sweet, slightly smoky and very delicicious. I look forward to drinking this one again."
""
""
"O- This thing is awesome! There is so much going on here it truly is remarkable. I've never had a winter warmer this full bodied, complex and creamy."
"Smells and drinks more like a stout than anything. Very drinkable, yet satisfying winter warmer. The aroma, taste and aftertaste are all very similar, but every sip seems to be a different mix of chocolate, coffee and fruit."
"I don't know if I will revisit this beer style."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"O - A tasty winter warmer, doesn't overload the palette with spices, yet doesn't come across too mild. An easy drinking ale that boasts a solid flavour profile and a uniqueness that comes with the style."
"O - a spectacular winter warmer that I will hit annually."
"Final Grade: 4.31, an A grade."

""
""
"In all a very decent winter warmer."
"D: A very English winter warmer that happens to nail down everything I personally like about the style. St. Peter's winter ale is one of those rare beers that retains everything that characterises a style but adds distinctive changes that complement the style's characteristics to produce something uniquely delicious. Well worth seeking out."
"D - a really nice winter ale. Subtle, but not too cute."
"O/D - Seemed sahti-ish. Not bad. Not overly tasty though. Couldn't get into it."
"Pours a coca-cola brown colour, one finger of off white head, some lace left behind. Smell is malty, lots of roast, rye like spice notes, chocolate and nutty scents as well. Taste is full of roasted malt, chocolate, lightly lactic, medium bitterness throughout, spicy rye like notes as well, faint coffee in the finish. Medium carbonation, full body, medium feel. This is really good and full of flavour, one of the better winter warmers showing up in Ontario right now."
"M - Medium body, silky. Light carbonation."
"This holds up very nicely in the bottle. I wish I could have this on cask. I am sure that would be a great treat. Still, as is, something I would highly recommend and something I am sure to buy more of before the season is over."
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink but doesn't provide a rich malty flavor or alcohol warming like other beers in the style. It tastes more similar to a porter."
"D - I could have a few of these. Reminds me of the British family of beers for sure. It's a good one."
"Drinkability - Found this to be an OK beer, nothing special. Good try wouldnt seek again as their are better beers out there in this category."
"Poured a dark burgundy, bordering on black. A finger of tan head fades to some big bubbles, and retains a collar of head with minimal lace. Nose of dark fruits, milk chocolate, plum, figs, bit of roastiness and some warm winter spices (cinnamon, nutmeg) which aren't prominent, but are interwoven amongst the others. Taste has more of the dark fruits and chocolate battling for supremacy on the palate, with some roastiness in there for good measure. Good smooth mouthfeel, with a quick hint of the alcohol in the finish. Solid drinkability, a winner."
"I'm guessing this is more like a porter. 6.5 abv doesn't usually make for a winter warmer. Overall, just not much there. Liquid bread."
"Note: I realize that this review may seem harsh, but if you have not tried it and you do spot it somewhere, feel free to pick it up, you may be surprised."
"A typical ale/porter/stout variety. Slight roast, moderate malt, not complex enough to carry the bitterness. Unpleasant aftertaste. Metallic notes didn't impress me. Nothing outstanding. The spicy malty smell was the best part. I much preferred the Peter's English Ale."
"The taste differs from the nose slightly. It starts out with a fairly strong coffee essence, then followed by lots of chocolate flavors with the caramel complimenting that profile. Some slight herbal bitterness in the finish from either the dark roasted grains or some light UK hops. Full malt flavor. Really nice sweetness up front. Some nearly burnt roast that leads to a long dry finish. The heavy malt flavors contrast atypically with the lighter body. A nice example of the winter warmer style. You can always rely upon the English to do a classy style correctly. St. Peters is one of the few English breweries which you can consistently rely on to deliver an authentic, quality AND fresh product to the states (second only to Sam Smith). Extremely drinkable and worth the purchase if located."
"Nose is some light roast, cocoa, caramel, a hint of earth. Taste follow suit with a noticable cherry flavor which borders on syrupy/medicinal, a hint of anise. Caramel, fruit bread, plums, cocoa, roast - not a stout but some of the characteristics of an English stout. It's quite quaffable, a little thin bodied, creamy but low carb. Decent but not as impressive as other offerings from this brewery."
"Drink - The alcohol is extremely well hidden and this is a great winter warmer. It reminded me a little bit of a scaled down version Unibroue's Trois Pistols. Worth seeking out, especially during the colder months."
"A good twist on the more spice-forward Winter Warmers I've had, possessing a lot more characteristics of an English Stout. If this was indeed a stout, I could think of several stouts that I'd purchase before this one, but I like it as a unique WW. This style has yet to really blow me away, but keep them coming for the season! This one's a great start."
"Pours a dark brown colour with thin tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Almost no lacing on the glass. Smells of mild roasted malt, earthy hops, caramel and and chocolate. Flavour has mild bitterness and bigger on sweetness. Smooth mouthfeel. This really reminds me of a porter."
"A nice example of the winter warmer style. You can always rely upon the English to do a classes style correctly."
"The ABV for this beer is pretty high for a British beer but I found it to be well balanced and very quaffable. Lots of roasted malt with peppery spice, candy sugar and dark fruit notes. Hints of plum, raisin, fig, grape and dark cherry. This beer is fuller bodied than expected and I was pleasantly surprised by it's complexity."
"D: Alcohol is definitely noticeable, surprising considering the relatively low ABV. Not sure from whence the odd sourness comes, perhaps it's because I'm flirting with the Best Before date, maybe it's just the style. At any rate, it detracts from an otherwise pleasant ale. It is true winter outdoors (0° C and five inches of snow on the ground) and that does make this beer feel more appropriate. Based on this tasting, I can't recommend it."
"Good atmosphere. Bold, intimidating appearance, although nothing too exciting, and not much in terms of a head or lacing. Nose is great though. Great combination of deep, rich roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate hints. Flavor follows suit. Deep, rich, and robust, and a clean palette with a good balance of tones. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"This was quite different from what I was expecting; my only other experience with winter warmers was Sam Smith's Winter Welcome Ale. While this is a whole different beast, it's a delightful porter'ish brew that I'd likely reach for again."
"d-pretty drinkable, prob wouldn't drink too much with tastier IMO winterwarmers out there though."
"D- I'm going to get a few more of these for sure. Very enjoyable to drink; a very delicious winter beer."
"A winter warmer that is too dry, the bitterness is too raw and the flavours are all over the place. Will probably gain of a years cellaring."
"This doesn't strike me as a winter warmer, but I don't care, it tastes great. I'd recommend trying it. It's a great balance of flavor and drinkability, and it should definitely be picked up at least once."
"D: Pretty easy drinking."
"Full malt flavor. Really nice sweetness up front. Some nearly burnt roast that leads to a long dry finish. The heavy malt flavors contrast atypically with a light, nearly watery body. Soft alcohol. Hop flavors do show with some grass and earthy qualities. Smooth although not rich or light. This, of course, leads to easy drinking. Probably dangerously so. For such a soft drinker it is very complex."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style Winter Warmer."
"St. Peter's Winter Ale certainly has an oddness against its counterparts, I will say that much, but strangely it works - and I'm happy to have a full pint of it. I can't offer any food pairings but might I suggest an armchair by a fireplace, frosty windows and the company of fragrant evergreen? This is definitely a guest you want in your house for the holidays."
"Anyway, it's good, but I can't help thinking there's got to be better, though I'd be hard-pressed to find another that looks this good."
"I like this one alot. I'd have this one with aged cheddar and dried figs."
" D- This beer is very quaftable with a mellow rich dark flavor that helps melt away the winter. A surprising treat in a green bottle."
"The flavor profile is a bit strange, but this is a solidly middle of the road example of the style. Some similarity to the '09 Anchor Christmas Ale when fresh."
"A decently drinkable ale, the warming side of things hidden, at best, and the herbal, drying nature of this brew sure suits its packaging."
"A nice beer, it certainly warmed me up. The only thing that let me down was the nose, which I felt was a bit weak."
"All in all, a very satisfying winter warmer. There's a number of characteristics of the brew that lead me to place it more in the brown ale, or porter category, which for me is a huge plus! I've got another one in the fridge, which suits me just fine!"
"Mouthfeel - Very smooth and creamy with a medium body and medium cabonation."
"This is a prime example of a winter warmer and one of the most drinkable examples I've come across. The sweetness is in check and the spices don't run wild, in fact its so similar to a stout I probably wouldn't be able to pick it out of a lineup. Highly drinkable and recommended."
"The taste of this beer also surprized me as it drank so much like a porter. Hoppy front end, chocolate notes, roasted malts and a long finish, nicely balanced, oatmeal, any spices were subdued. I agree completely with what the label states this is a beer rich in flavour. The mouthfeel is creamy, nice agreeable texture on a cold winter's day. First beer from this brewery, there are others available at the LCBO, now I look forward to trying them all."
"D: It was an interesting brew, but I didn't quite prefer it to other WWs. Guess it's hard to judge based on style if it's such a broad range."
"D: smooth and good flavored. I enjoyed this ale quite a bit. Shared with a friend who also really enjoyed. This is my first beer from St. Peter's and I will make sure to try others."
"From the 1 pint .9 fl. oz. dark olive bottle. Sampled on December 24, 2009. It pours a very dark brown with about a quarter inch creamy beige head. There is a kind of chocolate scent in the aroma along with a background of hops. It feels more like a Porter on first whiff. The taste is also very much like a porter with a light balance of hops and chocolate malts. This is tasty."
"Future outlook: 4's all around. Rock solid, and worthy of a repeat."
"This beer is similar to their cream stout, but drier. Coffee is a little bit more prominent, and chocolate less so. If you we're to give this to me blind, I'd probably think this stout. Regardless of what it is, this is a tasty beer. I had one for the first time last Christmas, and I have no idea why I didn't pick up more at the time; I'll be sure to pick up more this time around."
"Thsi beer pours a jet black colour with beautiful carbonation that leaves a dense creamy two finger head with nice lingering lacing everywhere,the aroma is very typical of a winter warmer with aromas of dark chocolate,sweet coffee and spicy fruity hops,it has a nice above average mouthfeel with a big hint of mocha first up followed by some earthy,fruity hops but no bitterness at all just a nice earthy sweetness about it and very easy to drink,my only comnplaint being is that we dont see this brew in our winter."
"D - Moderate to low drinkability for a winter warmer. While it succeeds at warming, it doesn't seem to be completely in the vein of liquid bread quite like I was hoping for. Seems more like a porter that I would pair more with food than a time of year."
"Um....overall this kind of just tastes like a variation of their Cream Stout and I'm not sure what is suppose to be especially wintery about it? I feel like I'm missing the punchline here."
"A really nice winter warmer with a little extra."
"Mouthfeel is super watery and light with really not too much going on for a winter ale. Taste is a bit smokey and malty with some light sweetness It's ok but not great."
"D- I wish I got more as this is an easy drink for me"
"Nice beer. Poured from a bottle very aggresively to get a medium sized, tan head and some lace. Color is a very dark, almost opaque amber with brown highlights. Aroma is figs, dates, and a little of other dark ripe fruit, dark cocoa, and hint of coffee. Flavor is more like a porter. Decent body and fine carbonation. Don't pick up the alcohol much. A slight dry bitter finish. Alcohol at the very end. Quite drinkable."
"This ale pours a dark brown color with beautiful crimson highlights. The most impressive aspect of the beer is really the aroma...it hit me immediately on the pour. Very dark and chocolate roasted characters. A touch of coffee, but mostly dark and roasted malts. Grain, and a bit of a grist-like scent. Low hop presence in the smell. The taste is a bit restrained, especially given the smell, although htere is some dark caramel notes and a full malt flavor. Barley. The beer is dry, and at times a little oily and slick. There's also a notable husky quality that occasionally makes an appearance. Medium body. This one is very enjoyable."
"Found on half-price close-out at Prisco's grocery on Prairie in Aurora, IL. Pours a darker brown leaning a bit toward the yellow end of brown with a normal off-white head that retreats into a thin halo. Served at cellar temperature, it blooms with caramel and light roasted malts, like the complexity of a 120 L crystal malt, and dark fruit aromas. The flavor is true to the aroma, providing a rich full-bodied flavor adding complex bready and dark malt presence, a yeast character reminiscent of candied fruit and preserves, barely balanced by a lingering hop bitterness. Certainly a heavy beer, which is appropriate for the style, which definitely excludes it from the session beer club. Certainly one to seek in the single-bottle section for a cold winter night, or even a chilly summer night after a cold front has blown through."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a good dark beer that's worth drinking for a while but there are other beers of its kind that I would choose first."
"This poured an opaque mahogany with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like earthy barley and prune and mocha, with a bit of alcohol. It tasted like sweet chocolate and prune and barley malt and bitter coffee, with a hint of oak. It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a nice flavor and good body. In typical English fashion, it was very clean and understated, but was easy and enjoyable to drink. More of a porter than a winter warmer, but still a solid beer. Unfortunately, it wasn't distinct enough for me to remember to try again."
"This has a malty richness with just enough hop bitterness to keep it balanced enough, and spicy enough, for a nice winter brew. This is a fun one, IMO. A solid choice for a winter beer that is more drinkable than many slow-sipper winter offerings, but is warming. Complex, but approachable. A nice take on a traditional English Winter Warmer!"
"Drinkability: This one was so-so. Great looking and a decent smell, but the overly charred flavor and the too forward oxidation make it just mediocre+."
" ~ I truely think this is one of the best brews I've had the luxury to enjoy. I strongly urge all my fellow BA brethren to partake in this wonderful brew. While the price tag may be stiff, the results are worth it."
"This is where the beer falls apart, no carbonation at all, thin mouthfeel, not appealing!"
"Medium-bodied with gentle carbonation and a supple mouthfeel."
"D = An easy drinking Winter warmer that I look forward to in the cold months."
"pours avery dark red (almost back if not near light(. Great thick tan head that fades rather quickly. Aroma is sweet malt, toffee/caramel. Taste is malt, toffe and caramel,ends with a slight hop taste. Very smooth, will warm your heart and soul on a cold winter's night."
"Smooth caramel and nutty taste. Not overpowering. A good hearty beer. Finished smooth with a sweet molasses finish. definitely recommended. I need to check this one out again, haven't had one in a while (review taken from notes)"
"D: Starts off as a nice and drinkable traditional winter warmer, but that funk at the end killed it for me. Will try again to see if my bottle was the issue."
"D: this beer is bold in taste and pleasant enough to smell, but it's a little too bitter for my liking. The appearance is also underwhelming. Still, the porter/sherry-like character and subtle fruitiness work well enough. A worthy warmer overall."
"D: I'd love to have a couple/few of these every week from about Mid December to late march... Too bad its not easy for me to get."
"Drinkability: Every bottle is a meal. Not too heavy, but there is plenty of warmth and flavor to keep the consumer pleased. Very drinkable."
"Very enjoyable brew."
"Mouthfeel is luxurious. Fairly low carbonation, so smooth and creamy. Moderate fullness, but not nearly overwhelming. Slight warming sensation from the higher alcohol. I could indulge in a pint or two of this without being too weighed down. A good sign."
"St. Peter's Winter Ale poured a dark brown, with a thin head. Smell was full of loads of sweet malts hints of milk chocolate. The taste was full of dark malt, bittersweet chocolate, and coffee. Mouthfeel was good with nice carbonation. Drinkability was ok, a bit filling. Overall a nice beer. The bittersweet of this beer made it a very interesting beer."
"A fairly stern beer, not for the faint of heart, but interesting and worth a try."
"Pours deep black, creamy. Small head, quickly dissipating. Goes down incredibly smooth -- strong, smoky malts, roasted coffee beans. Finishes super smooth, great palate. Solid beer."
"This is pretty smooth and would be quite drinkable if not for the burnt rubber flavor I get from the smokiness."
"A very interesting winter warmer. Smokey stout character seamlessly blended with sweet dark fruit and light spices. Pleasant and easy to drink."
"dark ruby colour, small tan head, no lacing. smells of malts, some smoke?, caramel, coffee. taste is roasted, smokey hint of coffee there is a nice bitterness too, alcohol is evident but not overwhelming. carbonation is lively.This beer almost reminds me of a porter."
"Nice appearance; a dark ruby red/brown color, clear beverage, with persistent tan head, some lacing evident. Aroma is very attractive; mainly sweet malts, molasses, dark fruits, some chocolate and alcohol. The flavor is roasted coffee, chocolate, sweet malts, noticeable alcohol. Medium to thick mouthfeel. The finish is true to the style; it is mainly roasty, with noticeable warming alcohol. Very enjoyable, especially on a stormy night. This is somewhat reminiscent of a coffee stout or porter."
"Goes down as an easy but intriguing beer. Well worth it on a cold night, great warmer even though the abv is low for this type, well done. This is the closest beer to Anchor's Our Special Ale, maybe they share more than a few ingredients? Really nice, but I want a bit more from this to give it an A."
"Medium bodied, smooth, drinkable, but really more of an after dinner sipper. Altogether a very nice cold weather brew. Could be good following winter activities."
"500 ml bottle bought at College Liquors in Grand Junction, CO. Man, I love 500 ml bottles. Pours a dark ruby color with a large light brown head, and great lacing. The aroma is full of chocolates, some light hops, and caramel. The taste is very nice; sweet caramel malts, some light bitter hops, rich toasted malts and some milk chocolate in the finish. Very nice and well balanced. A very enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability: An odd (maybe distinct is a better word) taste for sure. We think they released this a couple months too early (or too late). It wasn't quite ready yet."
"If memory serves me correctly, I imagine I'm rating this the best of the St. Peter's offerings. It is a deceptive beer. I would also describe it as being ""very English"" in style and flavor. Think Samuel Smith."
"All rounds out to a nice long finish."
"The aroma is slightly burnt caramel and toasted brown bread with a little dark chocolate, earth, and a light fruity wine quality. It has unexpected bitterness adding an unusual quality for the other elements and making it more interesting and memorable. The qualities work very well together and it is full-bodied but light and easy to drink."
"D - Not terribly good, a little too malty for sessioning."
"Malt bomb with lots of porter characteristics."
"Felt smooth, though more oily than creamy. Drinkability was good."
"500mL bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a very dark brown with no head. Nice aroma of malt and spices. Flavour is very full, and immediately hits you with some upfront sweetness. The sweetness then gives way to the malts and spices that were on the nose. Very full mouthfeel. I am a bit sensitive to beers that are sweet, but this one uses the sweetness well."
"Pours a good-looking ruby-edged dark brown with two fingers of creamy tan head and superb lace. The beer smells of medium-toasted malt and sweet caramel with an herbal hop counterpoint. The flavor is very similar; mellow toasted malts and carmel with light hop balance. Body is light-to-medium, crisp and clean. Very drinkable, but doesn't raise itself above the pack."
"Very dark molasses with a two finger light tan head that looks like fresh pancake batter poured onto the griddle. Aromas of pastry dough, caramel, chocolate and roasted malt. Flavors are similar with a hint of licorice and that slight Guinness tang/ sourness. Nice full body with a finish right back where I started. This is the best St. Peter's I've tried yet."
"Mouthfeel was tingly without high carbonation. Medium bodied. Better overall than expected, a nice winter warmer."
"Tastes sweet but balanced with bitterness, spices, faint cocoa, fruits and nuts (almost like trail mix, but unsalted)."
"Bottle. Aroma is 1 dimensional: malt. Toast, nuts and chocolate. Maybe some fig and persimmon in the background. Appearence consits of a very dark rusted brown with an average off-white head. Flavor is also 1 dimensional, malty with a touch of yeast, sour and salty finish, very british. Best 1 dimensional beer that I have ever had."
"My first-ever brew from St. Peter's, and I was really impressed with their Winter Ale - a true-to-the-style depiction of a winter warmer with a chracteristic malty, warming flavor... pours a jet-black ebony hue with a decent head with nice lacing... smell was complete with roasted malts, espresso, and cocoa... flavor boasted hints of burnt, dark chocolate, toffee, figs, prunes, malts, coffee, and dehydrated fruits... caramel, nutty, butter taste was also evident with candied, brown sugar pouring through, thick, rich, and full of flavor make this a superb beer and an awesome representation of the style... one of the better Winter brews I've tasted for sure... good mouthfeel with easy drinkability and a relatively modest 6.3% ABV make this an easily enjoyable brew that fits perfect for the cold season... St. Peter's did really well with this one... excellent sample... Recommended..."
"Notes: This was extremely easy to drink. Sooo smooth. The best brew I've had from this company. A first class winter warmer. I'm on a roll right now with top notch brews, hopefully it won't stop."
"D - If I had to choose a winter warmer from those I've tasted, I'd probably reach for this - less of that funky bitter spice I don't really like, and more like a well-made English brown."
"Appears a somewhat opaque mahogany brown almost black hue with ruby highlights, large velvet smooth textured beige head forms thick and the lacing is chunky and sporadically spaced. Aromatics are full of herbal tea tannins upfront cocoa in the malt profile with more of that creamy dark chocolate accents flowing. Herbal hops are not over pronounced but meld very nicely herbal qualities of leafy tobacco come out as well as the herbal tea notes. Flavor profile dry dusted dark chocolate with sweet mild fruit components finishes dry with herbal tea like bitterness. Great balance creamy with dark chocolate and a touch of coffee roast quality about it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied texture is so smooth it glides going down and carbonation is tame and really cask like in a sense. Drinkability, a welcome addition to the Winter ales I've come across so far this season. Unique and extremely flavorful compared to the average English ale."
"D - A very drinkable version of a classic English Winter ale. Don't expect much spice, but this is certainly full flavored with an easy drinkability. Recommended."
"A huge roasted malt warmness is right up front then followed by a tinge of fruitiness (I'm thinking berries or plums. It's either somewhere in between or I can't decide which) with a toffee smoothness in the middle. Nice medium body and light on carbonation. Though this is not as strong or heavy as I expected it's far from being thin. An alcohol pinch shows up in the throat but the balanced complexities of the malt and hops intermingle make this a nice glass of something to sip on such cold evenings such as tonight."
"Perfect for a cold winter's evening."
"Winter Ale doesn't supplant Cream Stout as my favorite offering from these guys. That said, it's pretty close to being that beer's equal. Good thing there's a ready supply on local shelves, because there's no doubt that a few more bottles of this beauty will be consumed before winter is done."
"D - This is an easy to drink brew has a good taste and smooth make this a beer thats worth drinking sometime"
"Yeah, this is one kick ass winter warmer. Comes in silent and then drops this complex malt bomb on the palate. This one is for the traditionalist."
"Well balanced and packed with flavour. Definitely a winner."
"Light and smooth mouthfeel for a strong English beer. Finishes fairly dry but with a pleasant lingering caramel sweetness. A fine ale indeed  done in the subtle, classy way that all St. Peters brews are. Warming me nicely on this cold, wet January evening."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. alcohol is hidden very well. i'm going to have to stock up on this one before it leaves the lcbo."
"A very drinkable brew indeed. Lacks some spices to be a christmas-beer but it's a very good stout/porter-clone. Goes down way easily. Give it a go!"
"A fine offering with a balance of malt, alcohol, and spiciness. The malts are complex, but difficult to put a handle on; caught somewhere between a Brown Ale and a Bock in flavor, but with a lighter body expected from either. Alcohols keep the beer thinned, but compliment with a sweet powerful dryness. Hopped for mostly balance, while offering a hint of pine and grassy notes. A standard brown hue with near clarity. Any other spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, or allspice) remain muted and compliment the esters and phenols well. Medium maltiness and bitterness that linger into the aftertaste with a hint of nuttiness, cocoa, coffee, and spices that carry into the next sip. Not a bad offering, but nothing tangible to celebrate either. There is a fine line between 'complex' and 'hodge-podge'."
"one pint .9 oz. glass bottle- color of deep amber, with a medium tan colored head - nose of roasted malts, slight coco, and mild hops  taste of roasted malts, dark roast coffee, some toffee, and mild hops - body is medium, and round , and with medium low carbonation  aftertaste of sweet malts, coffee, dry, and lingering"
"Pours quite dark, nearly black with some tinge of red. Decent head at first that fades relatively quickly. Aromas of gingerbread and bitters and lots of bready malt. Taste is similar- not sweet at all, in fact there is a bitter current throughout and a savory spiciness. Quite bready, almost crackery. Very smooth and easy to drink, though there is some alcohol warmth as well. A pleasure."
"D: A fair beer from St. Peter's, I've had better beers from them before, an OK offering, not just up to par with some of the better Winter beers out there."
"Overall why the hell isn't this available year round? Drop the winter ale thing and just call it St. Peters Dark Ale....This is their best offering and should be their flagship brew."
"Really like the mouthfeel. Nice and creamy in the mouth but it goes down really well. I think I could drink a couple of these. Not bad stuff."
"Certainly easy to drink but for its high price it could be better. Mild ale needs stronger flavors."
"Drinkability- Seems like an OSA type flavor. Pretty good with flavors all over the place. Not sure I could pound more than one of these in a day though. More of a once a season treat beer. I did like it though."
"the flavor is rich mad malty with a nice toffee flaovr with a hint of caramel, some burnt dark fruits with a hint of smoke, with a slight lingering grassiness."
"decent drinkability, but the burnt bitterness wears on you somewhat, not enough to significantly detract though. my only critique is that this beer is sort of loosely constituted, that is to say that the flavors don't seem to gel well, and don't work as a cohesive unit. well worth a try though, especially since it's a pretty cheap one and done beer purchase."
"Drinkability: I can't say I really cared for it. I just wasn't the carnival of wintertime smiles I was hoping for."
"Notes - Good if somewhat unexceptional. Not a beer I would seek out often, but it's good for the season and I definitely enjoyed it."
"I'd weakly counsel you to avoid this beer. I certainly wouldn't recommend it."
"Drinkability: Quite high. It's not mindblowing, but it's definitely tasty."
"Pours a dark brown/black color with a thin head. Aroma is somewhat roasted with hints of chocolate and coffee in the nose. Taste is smooth, roasty and very nice. Chocolate hints at the back of the throat and only a slight spiciness. Goes down very well. This has to be a porter or milk stout of sorts. Very roasty, smooth and better than I thought it would be. I would definitely buy this beer again."
"D: Very drinkable - would be enjoyable in front of a nice warm fireplace. I don't think it would go well with a meal, but that's more personal preference."
"This beer poured a dark brown color and had a nice thick off white fluffy head to it. The smell was of roasted malts. It tasted of roasted malts with a nice slight hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was heavy with low carbonation. Overall drinkability was decent. Nice to drink when it is cold out."
"16.9oz green flask-like bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. The smell is roasted malt with touches of caramel and chocolate. The taste much like the aroma is dark roasted malts with a nice dose of hops in the finish. Overall, this is a very nice winter seasonal that I would not mind having again. Recommended."
"Drinkability- I had to ramp up the drinkability on this one. It tastes delicious and is not over the top with alcohol. I could drink a lot of these all in one sitting. I'll be picking up another of these before the season is over."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol is not present, and the brew is not heavy and filling. a decent winter brew, worth a try. cheers!"
"Poured from the 500ml bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Body is a rich brown hue with ruby red highlights, topped by a small amount of fast-disappearing khaki-colored head. Aroma of nutty, slightly sweet malt and a touch of dark fruit (fig, raisin). Palate is malty and sweet up front, with the fruity notes coming through in the back of the mouth. Body is a touch thin for a stronger ale, and a mild warming from the alcohol follows down the throat on the swallow. A decent, drinkable winter warmer, although the price is a little steep."
"Pours a small head that has a great lacing and never goes away. The color is black and hard to see through. The color is a reddish purple color when a small amount of light comes through. The smell is roasty with a slight chocolate note. The taste is slightly bready with coffee. Mouthfeel is good, not great, but not bad either. Smooth like water. I think this beer isn't very complex, but very very good. It was nice to have this one time, but for the price it won't be my new session beer."
"D- Not too strong, but very bitter in the long run that gets more annoying as you go. Still, a decent brew from St. Peter's."
"St. Peter's Winter Ale pours a deep, dark brown, in fact it's almost black with a ring of ruby around the bottom edge of the glass and a thick bone colored head. Poured from a beautiful green half liter bottle, this one is the new version, no longer flask shaped. Sweet malt is evident in the smell. Numerous flavors wash over my tongue, there is definitely a strong vinous nature, wood (oak?), caramel malt, perhaps a touch of spice and with a bitterness toward the end that rounds it out nicely. Not exactly what I expected, but rewarding nonetheless. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like, but it may be appropriate for the style."
"500 ml green bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Very dark reddish brown colour, nearly black, nice brown head. LOVELY vinous aroma with oak, raisins, chocolate, roasted malts, liquorice, some coffee. The flavour has much of the same elements as the aroma, chocolate and sweet malts (but not too sweet) are in front. A roasty and hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Very full and rich mouthfeel. Blimey - this IS an excellent beer! LUVVERLY!"
"D: Damn good."
"As a winter warmer, it does a pretty good job. Big, heavy, and warming, but no more than one a night of these for me."
"Surprisingly I found this one to be very smooth and quite a pleasure to drink. I'm looking forward to enjoying a few more of these over the winter."
"Pours a clear reddish brown, thin tan head forms, disappears very quickly, no lace. Smell is very sweet, toffee, strawberries, some citrus, little bit of alcohol, minor roast.Taste is very sweet, some nice coffee/chocolate bitter roast through the middle, very pleasant, some vanilla, toffee finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Smell is not too pleasant, but the flavour is pretty nice, has a sweet stout kind of feel to it."
"Not to much carboration. Which makes it just like my kind of beer. Like lighter, less carborated stout. Kind of. Really enjoyed this one."
"M&D: extremely smooth on the mouthfeel, lightly oily and lubricating down the palate... This winter ale is so flavoursome and vertical in terms of texture. I couldn't help wondering that the recipe of this beer is somehow connected to the same brewery's creamy stout... All in all, this is a very enjoyable, malty winter ale."
"Pours a clear but very dark caramel color under a 1/2 finger tan head that fades fairly quickly to collar and spots of film, but still manages to leave a few strands of lace. The nose is full of chestnuts roasting on an open fire. The mouth is mildly carbonated and very sticky. The taste is excellent: sweet caramel and roasted nuts to start, followed by very nice, dry and crisp hops, leaving a slightly espresso bitter on the palate in the finish. The bitterness grows into the aftertaste, still very dry and crisp, inviting another sip. Good stuff."
"Other comments: A decent winter ale and definitely a good beer all-around. Nice complexity."
"St. Peter winter ale. Probably should drink this in winter weather. But oh well. Pours a red, almost stained mahogany colour. Does let a bit of light through. About a one finger head that lasts. Lace sticks to the glass. Rather nice to look at. Big, malty bread smell. Bit of ripe fruits, some spice and an earthy hop smell as well. Taste is as close to liquid bread as I've ever experienced. Very malty, almost hearty beer. Some fruits and berries as well, with a bit of spice and earthy hops. Warming alcohol after each swallow almost soothes the throat. Pretty much a meal in a bottle. Mouthfeel is thick and reminds me a bit of pudding. Drinkable, though one usually satisfies for a while. As said, it's like a meal in a bottle."
"A nice beer with good taste, has a nice sting to it."
"An unusual muddy dark rum appearance with large bubbles. OK drink and hops and spices,burnt toffee, sweetish molasses, oily coffee but kind of doesn't work all together. A typical UK beer brought in by LCBO - their committee of 13 preference. A weak porter? Better warmer."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown/black ale with almost no carbonation and therefore no head. Aroma is mostly comprised of roasted malt. Taste is quite simply some roasted malt, with some bitterness at the end and a very light watery finish. The alcohol doesnt really show and the body is just above the average. Overall, this is not a bad beer but nothing great either; probably an improvement over some other beers I had from this brewery."
"St. Peter's Ale is an old family favourite, so let's try the Winter Ale shall we? Pours a wonderful black with red in the light with an off white head that dissipates into a sheen of foam and ring of bubbles. Aroma is a dry roasted barley smell, with some burnt smells. Taste was a nice dry roasted flavour, with some hoppy bitterness. Very full bodied, with a nice coffee-like finish. Mouthfeel was medium, with very little carbonation. I really enjoyed this, but I have always wondered, why the style is called ""Winter Warmer""?"
"Pours black with cherry glints. There is no head at all and no real lace, it looks like old cask ale. The aroma is of plums, ripe cherries, some kind of spice and some fusel alcohol. The taste is unique. It starts out with a smokey roasty maltiness that quickly gives way to some medicinal notes and spicey alcohol. The hops are present in their bittering potential only. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick, in fact the body of this beer is reminiscent of motor oil. This is a very good winter warmer, super rich, thick and complex."
"Aroma of roasted malts, raisins, coffee. Taste was superb. A rich, complex beer. Full of burnt coffee, smoke, caramel, licorice and molasses. Alcohol is warming. Mouthfeel is slick, moderately carbonated. Drinkability is alright, the smokiness is a bit much after a while."
"From the green tinted St. Petes 1/2 liter ""medicine bottle: The pour was enticing...revealed a stark ruby red ale with a 1 finger off white fluffy cap that laces well...moderate corbonation. Interesting nose...musty cinnamon with roasty molasses smells. Has a nice oily mouthfeel and a presence like a spiced porter...lovely roastiness combined with spices, and burnt toffee sweetness, light cocoa tones...then the finish is drying with a leafy hop astringency mingling with a nice charred toast effect...and a slow warming. A very nice winter ale in the vein of a spicey warming porter. Recommended."
"Very deep ruby red, minimal tan head, low carbonation (good in my opinion). Malty, spicy aroma. Malt, hops, caramel sweetness are all balanced, licorice and burnt caramel both come through strongly later on and lingers to form a flavoursome aftertaste. An excellent, hearty, warming winter brew that does exactly what it's designed to do without being overly strong in alcohol. Highly recommended."
