"Color is much darker than I expected.  Smell is pretty faint but getting a bit of chocolate and maybe some dark fruits.  Taste is pretty sweet with caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, and spices but with a bit of roast in the finish.  Medium body.  Light to medium carbonation.  Overall not a bad take on the style, but not something I would necessarily seek out."

" This brew actually pours a pitch black in color with a thin tan head. Areas of spotty lacing is seen when sipped that ends up sliding back down the sides of the glass after a while. The aroma is of roasted malts like in a stout with some cocoa powder. Pretty much the same is said for the taste with a hint of dark fruit. Medium-bodied with low carbonation which is perfect for this type of brew. Very smooth and tasty brew for the colder months"

"O: 3.5 - Pretty ordinary dark beer. Reminds me of the early 90s microbrew scene, before people starting doing interesting stuff."

"Over All/ I really liked this beer. I think it was pretty well in line with the style. It is not the best winter style beer I have had but I went back and some more when I finished my first six pack. I would drink this again at any time."

"Pours dark, slightly amber in color with a tan head. The smell is nutty and of red wine, and it tastes of fruit, spice, and licorice, but more so of malt (roasted). Carbonation is mild to moderate with and the overall feel is light. Complex flavors yet very drinkable"
""
""
""
"O- This is more of a spicier version of a Dubbel, but very very tasty. Spices used sparingly, if at all, which make this a fine winter warmer in my book."
"The alcohol is well hidden and quite warming. Very delightful."
""
""
"A complex, yet smooth and easy-to-drink winter warmer. This is just right for a cold evening!"

"Actually one of Point’s better efforts. Poured at a good temperature with a large foamy, fizzy, light tan head that soon settled to a large island and ring with a bit of lace. Color is a clear orange red mahoganey with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is immediately bubble gum, then fruit, malt, caramel. Flavor is like nose with sweet on top then bitter and tang. Not a lot going on. Body is a tad thin and carbonation fizzy. Finish is like flavor, fairly long, and lelt me thinking: I know they can do it if they want. The question is, why don’t they?"

"The feel is on the lighter side of medium with a snappy crispness and is fairly smooth, though it might be a touch too active."
"Overall I thought Saint Benedicts Winter Ale was a decent beer. Had it for the first time at my girlfriends cabin in northern Wisconsin back in late December of 2012. The appearance of the beer was good, and the flavor was ok. I thought it was kind of a strong beer at times with the full flavor coming out at times. Would probably buy it again in the winter months."
""
"O: Not as good as I remember from a few years back. The cherries are a bit strong. Still, not bod."
""
""
""

"Pours clear amber with little head. Smells similar to a Belgian, but is not quite as complex. Has a surprisingly warm, and pleasant taste for how inexpensive it was. It is not a heavy beer, but does have a warm feel. A respectable winter beer at a very reasonable price."
""
""
"This is pretty good, though a touch too sweet for my tastes. Definitely perfect for Winter!"
""
""
"O-	Not sure if it fits the winter ale characteristics it claims to be, but an excellent take on a Belgian. A very well balanced tasty brew."
""
""
"Taste-Nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, some dark fruit mills about. A bit light-bodied for a winter warmer despite the 6.2ABV. A decent, bit better-than average wintwer warmer."
""
""
""
""
"O - A surprise, to say the least, from Steven's Point. Did not figure this to be a belgian ale prior to opening the bottle. Reminds me of Leffe Brown."

"O: This beer is quite drinkable compared to other beers in the style because the alcohol is well hidden and it isn’t very filling."
"Overall: One of the best American ‘’Belgians’ I’ve had. (I know, BA follows the label and calls this a “winter ale”). Whatever you want to call it, this is a superb, tasty, well-balanced, and easy-to-drink beer. 4.3"

"M. Somewhat smooth medium body with an understated carbonation."
"O=I paired this with pizza rolls, which did not work well...this would work well with red meat, I think, as well as by itself. Very likely that I will purchase this next winter."
""
"O-I feel this is on the verge of being better than average....I want to like it more but as I am discerning I keep wanting more assertive flavors to jump out...they don't...still not bad at all..."
""
"Reddish brown color with a very slight head. The aroma is malt-centric...a lots of toasted, bready notes. Some syrup-like scents, mingled with fruit. The taste is equally malty, with apple, pear, and some bitterness. Balance, however, is tilted severely toward malt. Moderately low in carbonation. The mouthfeel is actually a little lighter than the taste telegraphs. It's still a flavorful and good winter warmer."
"served from a 12 oz bottle. Pours a light ruby color with a whitish tan bubbly head that dissapears right away. smells faintly of mixed berries and wheat with an almost ester-y Belgian note to it similar to bananas. It tastes very refreshing and crisp with a slight hop kick while maintaining a distinct sweetness. very balanced with both malts and hops. has a crispy syrupy mouth feel that is very enjoyable. Overall a great winter warmer. Not very spicy and not too dark but still clean and drinkable."

"Overall - For whatever reason Stevens Point Brewery was a company I had stayed away from for a long time. I hadn't necessarily heard anything negative, but I had (incorrectly) made an assumption that they were only capable of making mediocre craft beers. Well, I guess I have to drink my words because this is a great, balanced, and drinkable beer. Sure, it's not that pretty and it doesn't adhere strictly to the winter warmer characteristics, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a plain good beer."
"O-nothing that I would seek out again, I just wasn't fond of the spice that I got out of it"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is kind of an odd, unfocused beer. It almost plays like a cross between a winter warmer and a Belgian Pale Ale, but it can't pull either off."
"O - Overall, not too bad. I enjoyed this and I will definitely look forward to it next year."
"This is nice and a bit different for the winter warmer category. It seemed at times to not be entirely coherent, but the mouthfeel and carbonation help tie things together. Nice for meaty meals."
"Pours amber in color with maybe some ruby hi lites. Very little carbonation and even less foamy head. Aroma of malts bread and nuts. Some light hops. Malty tasting with biscuit and alight hop bitterness. Drinks semi smooth with a touch of grit. This beer is just an average beer and really could use alittle work."
""
"This tastes like what happens when you try to make a Dubbel and under-calculate something in the process. Nothing huge here, though it still works. I wouldn't stab anybody for it, but it's nowhere near a drain pour either. I imagine it's an entry level for the warmer category."
"O- This was odd for me. For the most part it was ok, but they got a little carried away with the whole phenol/ester thing in the finish. Probably pass in the future."
"Sampled on December 3, 2011. The pour is a medium to dark amber, almost chestnut, with slow moving upward carbonation and a thin head. The aroma is spirited with dark malts, sugar, clean, light hops, and black licorice. The body has a smooth creamy feel to it and it falls in the medium range. Roasted malts are up front in the flavor with a mellow balance of hops, yeast and maybe a pinch of nutmeg. An entirely satisfying winter warmer. Not too spiced but basically balanced."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The alcohol inclusion is present with a warmth expected for the 6% indicated. As previously stated, this brew is a bit of a jumbled mess without enough malt backbone. The peppery spice and clove are very exaggerated. I am appreciative for the opportunity to try this beer on two different occasions (at the cost of someone else) and honestly both times I struggled to finish my glass. This one is not worth seeking out."
""
"O: I would call it a tie. The K-9 Cruiser Winter Ale looks nicer, but this one tastes and feels better."
"pours a slightly red transparent color with a solid 2 inch white head. smells like the holidays with a big malt body and a red berry sweetness. taste is a bit more hop driven than than nose indicates, and althought not a fruity or spicy beer, it has elements of both. good carbonation and went fantastic with thanksgiving dinner. enjoyed them all day with the turkey smoking away on the weber in fact. one of the more sessionable winters ive had!"
""
""
"Purchased as part of a mystery pack from U Pick 6 Beer in Erie, PA. Not as many spice notes as other Christmas ales I have had. Other reviewers have commented on the brown sugar notes. Think I taste them. I like this beer. The mouth feel was nice, not heavy. Overall good beer. I will buy this again when available..."
"Pours a cloudy red/orange color with a little and quickly disolving head. There is a slight scent of malts and some spices but nothing that sticks out too much. Taste is rather strong and dull. Starts with a nice spice taste but ends with a dry rustic taste. Texture is a little watery as well. After a few sips you get used to the taste but still has many flaws. Slighty disappointed but this one. I hope the other 5 beers are better than this. Sam Adams Winter Lager is by far a better tasting winter warmer than this."
"Point St. Benedict's Winter Ale is a slightly hazy copper ale with a yellowish head that fades to a waxy film and leaves outstanding lacing on the glass. Fruit and spice are in the aroma, with notes of cinnamon, pear and allspice. There is the slightest hint of caramel. It has a very soft and delicate medium body. It feels fluffy in the mouth and the finish is very dry and a little gritty. Wow, this is like a Belgian dark ale. The flavor is complex with a lot of deep and dark tones-- cinnamon and wood. There is a fruity note which is a little like apricot or cherry. It doesn't really taste sweet, though. Roasted bitterness lingers after the swallow. Wow, this is a really good Winter ale, even in Spring. This is a very rewarding beer."
"Dark amber with a creamy tan cap that lasts and leaves spiderweb lace on the glass. Rich, roasty malt and butterscotch with raisin and fresh bread dough. Well balanced malty, toffee and dark fruit flavors with Christmas cookie spice. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. By far the best beer I've ever had from Stevens Point."
"D: Incredible drinkability. I could drink these all night, and the abv isnt too bad either. Goes down so easy and is just a purely enjoyable beer."
"D - Ugh, drinkable in the sense of smoothness, but not in flavor"
"Okay. I'm not a big Winter Warmer fan so I'm probably harder on the style than is necessary. The flavor of this one is appealing to me, but it's just not quite fantastic. Would be okay to session a few though, they go down easy enough. Not as cloying as some WWs so there's that."
"D: Easy enough drinkability, but limited and moderate appeal. Very safe and middle of the road flavor will warrant little complaint, though little praise as well. A six pack will probably get boring halfway through. Single purchase recommended."
"D: Easy to drink. Can't say it's amazing but it's pretty decent."
"D - Not something I would track down again but it was a fairly good winter ale (warmer). As always could use more spice and maybe a less hop forward base. Overall very decent."
"Pours a bright ruby tinted copper color with a bright off white cream head forming thick and leaves behind fine lacing. Aroma has hints of christmas spice, cinnamon, allspice, and some citrus ginger. The back end there are some smokey ash tray notes. Nice underlying fruity character going on, brings out some caramel as well. Flavor wise some unrefined malt sweetness, extra juicy with plums/raisin/hints of citrus fruit in the back end. A bit of caramel/yeast spiciness not as upfront with the christmas spices in the flavors as the nose but still evident. A bit cloying unrefined/unfermented malts weigh heavy with each sip. Unnatural carbonation leaves a rough backend to each sip, something I wouldn't drink on the regular. Drinkability is rough, it shows promise from Point brewery to do something a little outside the norm from a regional brewery that big."
"St. Benedict's appears a bit viscous as I pour it into my glass. We'll see if that's really the case. It brought up a thick head of frothy tan foam which settles in a minute or so. Spots of lace are left about the glass. It's a slightly hazy crimson-tinted copper with glowing orange highlights. The aroma is interesting. I find it fruity and somewhat spicy. I'm thinking dark fruits like plum and raisin, maybe cassis. There's some darkly caramelish malt and cooked brown sugar beneath that. As I drink it, however, the lacing diminishes. Oh well, to the lips we go... fruit and malt combine at the front, and as it warms I find banana and clove. There's not a lot, but it's there. Across the middle it dries and a spice component appears. It rises in the finish, but notes of malt and then fruit are still there, leaving it fairly interesting and complex. Wow, it really is a bit viscous. It's medium-full in body and quite creamy as the carbonation is released. Back to the flavor, I really like the combination of fruit and malt at the outset. It's well combined, and the specific fruitiness that I found in the nose isn't there, it's more generic. Wether that's a good thing or a bad thing I don't know, we're not comparing it to any particular style or other beer. Hedonistically, I like it. And I also like the way the spiciness gently builds across the palate until it becomes most apparent in the dry finish. And not unlike the fruitiness, the spicing isn't quite clear either. I could guess at what's there, but it's not readily apparent and in your face. Perhaps it's just a pinch of cinnamon? Perhaps it's just clove and phenolic from the yeast? Personally I find that a good thing, it leaves you guessing. I think they've done a nice job of blending to get a nice mix that works, and they've kept it restrained enough that the spicing doesn't build on the palate, ruining the beer for you half way through. Sure, the first couple of sips of a really spicy beer can be great, but then you lose interest as it builds on your palate and blocks out the other flavors. This one is balanced enough that it remains focused and drinkable. Based on that I have to give it some really good marks for drinkability; and since I don't find any faults here, I'd have to say it's an excellent winter warmer. Nicely done!"
"I had this with pork at Christmas dinner and it was a great pairing."
"An ok brew. Some decent belgian flavors mixed with a so so english base."
"Overall, i don't necessarily find this to be a winter warmer. It is more similar to Fat Tire than anything that carries that label as winter warmers tend to be flavored with various spices, mainly cinnamon. Also similar to Fat Tire, this is a beer that one could easily finish a six pack of."
"Like many others, wondering where the spice & flavor is in this beer to make it a winter ale. There is the slightest bit on the nose, and in the finish, though other than that this remains a dryly sweet brown. Not anything special, but not terrible either. Sometimes you need an average beer, right?"
"Lighter body with soft carbonation. Alcohol is hidden. Not sure why this is called a winter warmer. Not very interesting."
"Drinkability: OK...a disclaimer...I consumed a Samuel Smith's Winter Warmer prior to drinking this sample. Maybe my palate hadn't re-calibrated, but this beer tastes like somebody really didn't give a crap about carefully crafting a winter beer. Seriously, did the brewmaster decide to throw a carton of Marlboros in the mash tun and pass it off for ""smoking the beer""? There are some redeeming qualities - the color, the finish - but I won't seek it out again, even at .99c/bottle at my local beer shop."
"pours a nice copper with a thin head. Not much retention but a decent amount of laceing. Aroma is of dark fruit and sugary malts. Body is thick and lightly carbonated. Taste is of brown sugar, carmel and dark sweet fruit. solid finish. Worth a try this season."
"Drinkability: slow sipping winter beer. The spiciness keeps this from having more than one in a session."
"Not bad, but nothing exciting for me. Not as much depth, malt or spice as I had hoped. Will probably stick to the belgian dubels and quads."
"Notes: Pretty malty beer that is pretty sweet. Didn't really amaze me, but just a simple drinking beer."
"Drinkability - Pretty decent brew, and very easy to drink"
"Pours a nice clear dark copper / amber with a small tan head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, some sweet spices and fruitiness. Taste is sweet caramel malt, some breadiness, sweet spices and some light hops. Palate is med to full body, nice carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, some breadiness and yeast, ending with a dry alcohol sweet vanilla bitternes and some nutty flavor. Overall a nice and drinkable holiday ale,"
"The mouth has decent heft but may be on the thin side for a winter warmer. This is a nice change-up and is a good introduction/crossover beer."
"Not outstanding, but as I drank I began to taste the complexity of this beer."
"Decided to open this one while watching my Bears try not to fail against the sad Bills in Toronto. Fingers are crossed both for the game and for the beer. It pours (the beer, that is) a cloudy sienna-amber topped by some short-lived ecru foam, which finds apex at, at best estimate, a half-finger. The nose comprises rye bread, brown sugar, light maple syrup, and a good helping of nutmeg. It doesn't quite mix together very well, and just sits there, hoping that some 'strils come by looking for a ""good time"". The taste follows the same spicy path, but adds some light tinges of orange and grapefruit (the latter even lighter than the former), graham crackers, and straight butter. No margarine here, son. The body is a sorta hefty-feeling medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a grainy feel. Overall, I think SP tried a bit too hard to make a spiced ale, as the components don't really mesh all that well together. It's still not that bad, but not necessarily something I would go for very often in the future."
"Very well balanced and pretty damn drinkable, yet big enough to be thrown at just about any holiday dinner. With each sip, and as it gets closer to cellar temperature, it grows on us. A sure pick here for your winter seasonal needs."
"All in all, aging helped this beer along on it's way and seems to have matured well. More hops would carry it past the taste of a double-bock into the holiday necessities."
"Overall: I'd say it's flavor and warming effect makes it perfect on a cold night every once in a while."
"M+D: Thin and watery with a syrup like finish. Moderate carbonation supports any body this beer may have. Light in body and crisp in finish but little flavor."
"Drinkability: A rather odd concotion that is neither here nor there, though it is interesting enough to contemplate for a while"
"D - This is a nice winter ale from a brewer that I usually don't hold in high esteem. Nutty and bready, this is a nice winter brew that doesn't do the whole played out ""fruitcake and spice"" thing. Drinkable on a feast-type evening, but a bit much for a normal session. Good stuff!"
"D- An interesting take on the style. A little on the rich side."
"Interesting, although a bit too peculiar and rich for my tastes. Would probably go quite well with sauerkrat, sauerbraten and smoked fish."
"Immediately felt warmer after this beer, the beer has to be at least a 6%. Coming in from a blizzard this beer made me feel great about the price I paid for it. Poured a semi dark orange-copper color with a 1 finger head that dissipated relatively quickly, but retained somewhat through out the entire drink. Smelled especially caramel-like. Taste is of some tasty malt notes and caramel, with some banana-apple fruitiness I am also detecting as well. Mouthfeel is alright, it could be emboldened a bit by adding a bit more malt to the beer. The drinkability is terrific. The taste is semi-sweet and can be savored, while it finishes pretty dry and refreshing. Further warming probably will ensue."
"D - This was a surprising good winter warmer. It really brought some great flavors."
"A bit of a let down on the flavor, malty bread, undetermined spices, more like a standard amber than anything seasonal. Good drinker, with a soft body, sessionable but for the slightly high abv over 6%, at this abv wish they put more flavor into it."
"Rather decent brew. My favorite from Point."
"D - A touch too sweet but balanced somewhat well, it's heading in the right direction. Not a holiday beer I'll be back for seconds on though but worth the try."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a small but thick foamed tan head, some sticking. Smells of chocolate malt, gingerbread, oranges, caramel candy, a cherry sweetness and a machine like funk quality. Light and alive with carbonation, very drinkable. Although a bit more sweet than i would prefer, especially if drinking more than one, it fits with the season nicely. St Benedict's Winter Ale is a damn nice winter throwback for only 7.99 a 6'er, beef up that body a little more and now we're talking..."
"It pours a rich, malty deep darkish red color but the head fast disappears and the taste is just so-so average. A bit light on the ABV for the style. Lots of maltiness with definite hints of chocolate. Nothing to really linger on the tongue and a bit bland tasting. Probably not too bad as these beers go, but definitely not head of the class."
"Not that familiar with the beers from this brewery, but not a bad effort at all!"
"Point represents one of those breweries that I like at times, otherwise not. Their price point is fantastic, which does keep me coming back. As a winter warmer 6 pack, I could easily turn to this beer."
"Pours a dark crimson color with 2 inches of off-white head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. An exciting and complex aroma. A lot of spices such as cloves, nutmeg,and hints of dark fruit like figs and dates. But there is something in the background that lowers the score a little. It is almost like an ashtray aroma. Odd. The flavor is not as exciting. Plenty of spice up front with the fruity flavors in the finish. Again there is something in the background. Definately some ash. Seems out of place in this beer. I would of liked a little more body in this beer but otherwise good. A surprising and good effort from Stevens Point."
"Drinkability: Quite a pleasant brew. This one adequately exemplifies its style and would be great to drink on a cold holiday night. While it's not the best beer out there, it's still pretty damn good."
"Not bad, but not great"
"Drinkability: So-so. It's not a 44-person water skiing pyramid, but, when considering the rest of Point's offerings, it's not half bad!"
"Light fruits in the flavor - green grapes and pears. Decent amount of grassy hop flavor and has a mineraly British feel to it. Has a bit of a bad stale malt taste that perhaps could be attributed to some oxidation. Not overly impressed, but one of the better Point beers I have tried from a bottle."
"Poured a dark amber with low, meandering carbonation. It's got a solid winter spiciness scent to it--some spicy malt for sure. The flavor is pretty good: cinnamon and nutmeg blends well with the malt used here. The body however seems slightly lower than I'd expect from a winter warmer. Overall, though, an enjoyable little brew."
"(D) A decent winter brew, but not a stand out."
"I'm wondering now if I can get some use out of the remaining four bottles by using them for cooking."
"Overall not bad, not the best but still more then decent. I would have no issue at all with trying this one any day."
"Pours dark amber with a thick, slightly bubbly tan head that tops off just above the pint glass. Retention is excellent, falling into a thin covering over the brew, and leaving a small coat of lacing behind. Smell is fairly bold, with caramel malts, fruits, yeast and hops. Tastes of spice and sweet malts with some earthiness and hop bitterness completing everything very well. A very tasty, medium bodied winter warmer that seeems to be somewhat underrated."
"If you love Belgian dark ales, then this is your beer. Not my style, sorry."
"Taste: More banana and clove in the taste. Something about it seems off, perhaps the cloves have too big of a presence. I can taste some other spice in the aftertaste but I don't know what it is."
"Pours a clear amber color. Only a 1/4 inch head with poor lacing and poor retention. Smells mainly of spices along with a strong hops presence. Fits the style. Had a smooth and crisp mouth feel. There was a high carbonation level. Tasted strongly of spices (coriander), roasted malts, and a slight hop background. Overall, a good combination of flavors - worth a try."
"Drinkability is average when the over sweetness and funny feeling finish develops on my tongue after I finish the drink or sip."
"This beer lacks focus. It is malty and rich like a nice bock, but it also has spicey characteristics (orange, corriander, all spice). Does it's alc. amount really make it a winter warmer? It is better when it's warmer. It is a good beer, but I don't drink it where I work...and it's on tap."
"D-Good drinkability. It seems perhaps a bit lighter than I expected for a beer in the realm of winter warmers. Regardless, this is a smooth drink, appropriate for a cool evening after work, perhpas while studying comic books :)"
"That aside, it isn't bad, I could drink this again. It might actually be a very interesting cooking beer."
"I'm a bigger fan of Point's beers than most--if they cost two bucks more per sixer I'd bet they'd be a lot more respected. Even so, there's no mistaking this beer for anything other than a completely unexceptional warmer. If you have access to Sam Adams' or Goose Island's winter ales, there's really no reason to buy this."
"Drinkability - Decent beer for a cold winter's night from a nice small town brewery that makes decent beer. Nothing to knock one's socks off, though."
"On the plus side, it's very tasty, and I could drink a ton of it. Nothing wrong with that!"
"Not a bad beer by any means, just quite, not good. I had no problem finishing this. It just seemed to be lacking."
"Mouthfeel is medium with active carbonation. A little thin for the style I believe."
"Light bodied, fair carbonation. This doesn't interest me much. Can't say I'll ever drink anymore of these. It's not bad, per say, but there are much better options available in this style."
"Like all Points, it is a touch watery, could be a lot more chewy, especially for the style. Overall it is pretty mellow for the style, but the lack of any overpowering spices or sweetness makes it very drinkable."
"Pours a clear, deep crimson color with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves only spotty lacing in the glassware. The nose is a surprise. This beer is considered (I surmise) to be a winter warmer, but it smells more like a fruity Belgian-style dubbel. Caramel, dark fruits, raisins and fig - the dominant note being an estery yeast aroma, however. Slight spicy notes are detectable as well, though I suspect no spices were added although the packaging doesn't indicate. The palate is dry and fruity with a distinct bitterness that occasionally borders on tart. This character is more like overly-roasted or scorched malt than something fanciful like a wild or lactic yeast strain. Incredibly estery, this beer is more like a dubbel light. The body and mouth feel is just too light to support the flavors this beer is trying to achieve. Ample carbonations leaves the beer all the more dry in the finish, but does little to compensate for the thin, watery body. The label doesn't tell me the ABV of this beer, but I'd suspect it to be on the very low end for a winter warmer - maybe 6% or thereabouts. This is an 'okay' beer for the season, but not something to flip over. This beer strikes me as one that could be quite pleasant if it were improved in a couple of vital aspects - particularly the thin body and slightly acrid off-flavor. Having said that, though, this isn't bad and not a drain pour beer by any means. I give it kudos for effort."
"With a little work, St. Benedict's Winter Ale has a chance to be Steven Point's finest beer. Hell's bells, given what else they produce, it might be already. With a little bulking up, this could a contender."
"I wonder if what I am drinking is what was intended. There is the outline of a decent beer here, but there also seems to be some problems."
"Though not exactly what I expected and lacking the flavor that I expected for this type of ale. I would say that this is a drinkable seasonal beverage."
"Into a pint glass, pours a dark crimson with no lasting head, no lacing, meh. The aroma has some caramel, dark fruits like cherry, cranberry perhaps, some spicing, pretty ok. The taste is decent, again some caramel and sweetly malts, cranberry is there again, dry herbal hops, a bit tart... and honestly kind of tastes like a dubbel. Don't like that tart part, but otherwise its decent. The mouth is medium, ok carbonation, didn't start out well but got much better as it warmed. In all, its rather stock,"
"This beer is available at The 8th Street Grill in downtown Minneapolis. They are trying to be a beer destination, with over 30 beers on tap, but that's a topic for another review. Although this site lists this as a winter warmer, the bar lists it as a Belgian Dubbel. Although this tastes more like a Belgian than a Winter Warmer, it's claim to either style is weak(just like the beer). Served on tap, this pours a pleasing clear amber color. There is no smell to speak of. The taste has slight fruity overtones, with apple and pear predominating, but it tastes as if it was watered down. This is the classic macro attempt at a craft brew style. Don't make the taste too strong so as not to offend the Point Lager crowd. Well, I'm not buying it(literally). The mouthfeel is weak and the drinkability is poor. Whatever style this is supposed to be, it just doesn't get it done."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite holiday/winter beer. Would not consider this for a session beer."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Never been a big fan of ""the dark's", but I'm always willing to try, hence my adding this to my sixer. Pours a dark copper/brown, smells mainly of malts with maybe just a brief hint of spice. At first drink, didn't find much of any of those spices I sniffed, but the taste was not nearly as strong as other dark's I've tried. Last drink same as first. As far a dark's go, this is on my short list of drinkables."
"This beer lacks a unified flavor. Spices are too aggressive and overwhelming and complexity that may be in there. I don't know if I can drink another one."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. This beer has most of the characteristics you are looking for in something to keep you warm. I will make this one another in the list of seasonal must-haves."
"The beer pours a brilliant mahogany with a thin off-white head. The aroma is moderately spicy, with hints of chocolate and roast. The flavor is moderately roasty, a little chocolate pokes through and there is a low hop bitterness. The body is rather thin with moderate carbonation. The finish is a bit dry. The flavor also is somewhat spicy/phenolic, likely from the yeast strain. Overall its a nice beer to look and is well done, but the lack of any lasting flavor and odd yeast character makes this nothing outstanding."
"Having tried this brew from a bottle before this tap version may have helped my review, but it is worth a try. Decent brew, try the bottle before on tap!"
"Nice amount of carbonation, pretty smooth and highly drinkable. For the price, I would recommend this one."
" ~ I must admit I am prone to liking Point beers and this one is no exception. The Stevens Point brewery has again reaffirmed another reason why I love this wonderful small city. Good people, good times and good beer. I think I'll have another."
