3.68,4.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 2/25/2014. Pours fairly clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, herbal, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. A light metallic note is present in the aromas as well. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, herbal, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, light pepper/pine, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. Some light metallic/astringency in the taste, but not overpowering. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English strong ale. All around good complexity, robustness, and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. I felt this could have been better if it were less hoppy, but was a nicely enjoyable offering otherwise.","superspak","Feb 15, 2015"

Aromas of malt sweetness, both rich and slightly spiced. Subtle old world fruit aromas fill the nostrils, while light nutmeg and cinnamon spicings highlight. Flavors are heavy and rich, with date and fig starting the ride. Chocolate profiles come shortly after, with an overall roasted backbone. The body is kept light by the carbonation levels, keeping all the rich and heavy flavors in check. Rich, slightly dark and cloying finish with a date/fig/raisin aftertaste.

Really light on the front end, with some subtle hops and a smooth coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. The back end follows with some pronounced pine hops. It is a good winter warmer, sipping beer.

Smell is of mature cherries, caramel malts and some faint generic hops. Taste features smokey dark malts, balanced pretty well with slightly tinny hops. Noticeable prickly fruity edge, with a fairly strong bitter finish. This beer had a very unique smokey charcoal character-- was this malt smoked over something? Has a distinct earthy- quality to it. Not bad, I liked the fruit character and accompanying sweet caramel malts. Too much aggressive hops in the finish. for me, and that odd charcoal taste got old a while.

Smells of sweet malts, alcohol, bitter fruit. Taste is astringent hoppy bitter up front, dark breads and coffee; slight sweetness lingers on the back with some more subdued coffee. Hop bitterness hides the alcohol; if it weren't for the bitterness this would be well balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit watery but helps the drinkability significantly. If this were any thicker tasting as it does now, it would loose major points. I'll finish the sixer, but I think I'll stick to Jube for winter warmers.","youradhere","Oct 20, 2010"

The taste takes a surprising one-eighty spin toward hoppiness, with heavy pine notes stampeding over the initial sweet maltiness. It all seems very unbalanced and, rather than being a gradual shift, sudden in the flavor change.

Unfortunately the alcohol is hidden so well in this brew that it doesn't even warm as it goes down. I've a real problem with winter warmers that don't warm as they go down. That's the whole point isn't it? I really don't think I've had a winter warmer to date that has warmed my throat and belly.

The beer poured a nice dark brown that showed ruby hues when held to light. There was a decent off-white head that lated and left spotty lacing. Aroma was pine hops, burnt caramel and a hint of cinnamon. The taste is a nice blend of spice, burnt caramel malts and a decent amount of bitter pine hops. The beer is on the light side of medium and crisp with decent carbonation.

No presence of alcohol in the smell, but after half a glass, the beer is certainly warming. The taste is dominated by a maltiness and considerable residual sweetness. Theres a lot of flavor in the mouth, which corresponds nicely to the full-bodied brew. Its not over-the-top, but is very well done. I enjoyed the spiciness and the fruit in the forefront.

Not the whole bouquet, just a little, just enough to knock things out of whack, otherwise its a decent roasted malt aroma. Toffee, nuts, some light spicy hops, some very light doughy yeast and a small zing of currant. The taste follows suit. There are some good characteristics to this beer but something is just off.

Malty backbone, no hops to speak of and a nice sugary sweet warmth from the 7% abv. Fill the mouth nicely. I would surmise that there are much better winter warmers out there, but this is not bad.

Touches of dry, hoppy smells are noted in the background. A sip starts with sweet malt flavors, caramel and molasses stand out among a standard sweet malt body. A piney hop taste is also in the mix, but plays second fiddle to the malts. Towards the finish a vague dark fruit flavor pops out alongside a vague alcohol taste. The finish concludes with a caramel sweetness. Overall, Snow Cap has a nice mix of flavors, but the overall experience is a little thin-flavored, especially in the middle of a sip. If Pyramid pumped up the malt flavor a bit this could be an excellent winter beer.","Gagnonsux","Nov 24, 2005"

Anyway, it pours a dark amber brown color with a decent head. When held to the light it reminds me of stained wood. The smell is terrific. Notes of coffee and bittersweet malts put a grin on my face. It tastes nice as well. I don't think the little bit of aging has hurt this one at all. The flavor is choppy and bitter at first, but finishes warm and smooth. I notice bitter chocolate and a bit of coffee and malts on the palate. The mouthfeel is somewhere between the infinite space that lies between medium and heavy bodied.

There were lots of big flavors, including chocolate, anise, and spice (maybe cinnamon?) on the tongue. It had a somewhat creamy mouthfeel.

The hop profile is great and combines well with the carbonation. The malt is a little boring. The alcohol is 7% and is hidden quite well. I like this beer but it is a very typical ""seasonal ale"". Nothing stands out very much.","Maestro","Dec 31, 2003"
2.56,-27.1,4,3,2,3,2.5,"A very nice color, dark red brown. Standard xmas beer spice smell, nice. Taste is a rush of alcohol that's not really masked well by the bitter malts and hops. The spices are notable, but really in the background. I'd skip this and get the Sam Adams winter lager if I were you.","benmiliron","Dec 28, 2003"

2.96,-15.7,4,3,3,3,2.5,"Appearance: Deep ruby almost takes on a deep purple tone with a nice creamy textured tan head nice sized at that, with nice even ringed lacing patterns. Aroma: A bit dull but I can pick out some toasted malts, mild spicing, some finishing hops and of course a kick of alcohol in the nose here. Taste: Soft sweetness starts to roll of the tip of the tongue then suddenly I hit a road block it finishes with a strong overbearing onesided flavor a bit soapy and hoppy but mainly bitterness comes through not any flavoring from the hops. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body compared to most winter ales this one lacks body and the carbonation seems a bit spritzy. Drinkability: Worth a try because it's winter time and there's so many awesome brews to choose from I don't want to overlook anything, but I could have gone without this one just not that enjoyable for me.","WVbeergeek","Dec 08, 2003"
3.06,-12.8,4,3,3,3,3,"I've had many better strong ales than this one. It poured nice with an opaque darkness and good sized bubbling head. But the actually beer was not the best. It was balanced but the flavors seemed a little dull. Not much depth and alcohol was a little too strong. The spices seemed to be missing, isn't this a winter beer? Improved as it warmed and the flavors melded better together but all in all, not as good as I had hoped.","granger10","Dec 06, 2003"

Just a wonderful winter ale for sipping by the fire watching TV. I find I can only drink one or two though, starts to taste pugnant after that. But that first sip and others are really enjoyable.

3.21,-8.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,3,"2002. A deep mahogany body with reddish highlights is capped by a short but creamy light-tan head. It's retention is limited, and it drops shortly to a thin collar and leaves only minimal spotty lacing. The nose is not very welcoming, but not exactly off-putting. It clearly displays some higher alcohols with notes of acetone/solvent and acetaldehyde. I can only believe that the fermentation was hot and fast! Beyond that there's not much: some mild maltiness, light woody/earthy character, and maybe fading spices. Fortunately, a third strike is avoided as the higher alcohols are somewhat masked in a flavor that's malty and deeply toasted with a light spiciness and a firm, resiny hop flavor. The bitterness is well entrenched and also helps to cover up its ""heat"". Surprisingly, it finishes quite dry but with a spot of sweet caramelized malt. Some hop bitterness lingers, but the heat of the alcohol also starts to build at the back of the throat. Disappointing. I hope I didn't wait too long to try this. However, it has a good reputation and I'll give it another shot next year!","NeroFiddled","Apr 04, 2003"

3.92,11.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Deep brownish-red brew with an off-white head. Head retention isn't great. Aroma is very malty, with intense caramel sweetness and toasted character. The taste is reminiscent of a doppelbock, but with lots of hops added. Sweet caramel and a little toasted malt at the front, followed by the unexpected rush of oily and leafy hop bitterness. Finish is a bit mellow, but still hoppy. Nice leafy aftertaste. Overall, this is a pretty good effort. I like the uniqueness of it.","hyuga","Mar 10, 2003"

Aroma is malty... with caramel malt, a touch of cherry, spice, and alcohol. Flavor begins and ends with a lot of malt sweetness, with some accompanying spice, a slight astringent flavor, a touch of oak, some finishing bitterness, and a warming alcohol flavor. Has a full body with a syrupy mouthfeel. A bit heavy on the sweet malt for my tastes, but a decent winter warmer.","zerk","Jan 06, 2003"

4.07,16,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Crusty tan head, deep dark brown in color. Aroma: full of dark, but sweet, sensations, espresso and dark chocolate first and foremost, also burnt toast and spices. Texture is a trifle grainy at first, but mellows soon. Then, the hop bite jumps into the fray! Slightly syrupy, but big carbonation, this seems different from when I had it in bottles last year. Has the feel of an extra-hoppy brown ale, or a super-charged porter. Very warming, and very satisfying!","feloniousmonk","Dec 30, 2002"
3.26,-7.1,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Color certainly looks nice in the glass, a deep reddish brown tint that you can see straight through. Aroma doesn't leave much impression. Taste is slightly bitter with a high alcohol flavor and some medicinal quality. I don't think this one would taste good warmed up. Slight green wood flavor perhaps from the hops. I bought a single for $1.49. I'm pretty glad I didn't get a whole 6 pack. Bottle is 2002 edition best before 5/9/03. A little age might not be a bad thing for this one.","mjohn27603","Dec 26, 2002"

This is one of the better winter brews I have tried.","Morris729","Dec 04, 2002"
3.95,12.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Deep clear brown, minimal 1/8 inch head that reduces to a skim in 40 seconds. Nice smells, a slight sense of maple. Quickly, the flavor seems deep and slightly coffee-like with a little bit of mature raisins. The brew then turns more neutral with Goldings hops dominating the close. Pleasant, has some alcohol power and seems to be a decent offering from Pyramid. One of the better ones from this brewery and ranks pretty well among seasonals Ive had this year.","ADR","Nov 25, 2002"
