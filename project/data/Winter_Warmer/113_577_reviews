"Banana bread smell taste of Christmas morning not really but very carbonated"

"A solid winter warmer. I don't think this actually contains spices. If it does, they are wielded with a restrained and tasteful hand. Plenty of genuine English character."

"Nice reddish color body and nice and malty"
"2014-2015 vintage, malty and British."

"O: Definitely not my favorite from Sam Smith, but overall a great seasonal beer that is downright sessionable and a must try. I could definitely sit in a pub and throw back a few of these before realizing how much I'd had. Good blend of flavors, and an absolutely exquisite looking beer. It isn't outstanding in anyway outside of the look, but overall it is a very solid addition. Haven't had a bad beer from Samuel Smith's yet. Even with a beer such as this that isn't as enjoyable as others, it's still damn good."

"Poured a clear amber red body with a one finger bubbly white head. A very nice looking ale, a nice gem. Scents of caramel, light molasses, fruity esters, mostly apple, sweet spices, with notes of cinnamon most apparent, rich, sweet bready malt, a very slight alcohol presence, some light aromas of white grape raisins. Overall impression of aroma is of a rich, sweet winter ale in the English tradition. Malty, spicy, slightly fruity and quite pleasant. Flavor begins malty and Iightly sweet, with notes of caramel, light levels of sweet spices, balanced by the slight bitterness of earthy and herbal Fuggle and Golding hops. Middle picks up in dryness a bit, with notes of sweet spices, the same hop character, rich caramel malt, apple, rich bready malt. Finish is lightly dry, with the same hop character continuing, alongside light notes of apple and bready malt, with a slight mustiness like a good traditional English old ale. Aftertaste is bready, rich malt and nice English hop bitterness. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully balanced ale, striking nicely between Malta and hops, with malt dominating, but hops always present and keeping the beer from being overly sweet. An excellent example of the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and the slightly chalky feel that many of Samuel Smith's ales have from the Yorkshire water. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very nice, drinkable winter ale, not too thick nor too thin. Perfectly balanced. Overall this is N excellent winter warmer, easily the best I have sampled. It has a wonderfully malty aroma and an amazingly balanced flavor, aided by a traditionally English mouthfeel. A good example of an English winter ale and well worth drinking."

"Got a bottle only because it was on sale at about 2.50. Has a beautiful reddish amber color and smelled sweet and malty. The taste is another story.  I get a malty sour apple juice with an awful aftertaste. Never tasted anything like it and probably won't buy again. Love Sam's organic chocolate stout and oatmeal stout but now I see why it was marked down...  if you like sour notes then have at it but otherwise you probably won't enjoy it."

"1 year old. I like others of this style better."

"Overall- Never having had this beer before I decided to try it. I have to say, it's a bit different than what I was expecting from a winter ale, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good beer. It's complex character makes it an interesting beer."

"Pours medium amber producing 2+ fingers of beige, somewhat lasting, frothy head that recedes to a nice cap but leaves almost no lace. Aroma is caramel malt & fruity, lightly buttered biscuit, spices, a hint of roast & floral hops. Taste is fruity & caramel malt (caramel candy apple), biscuit & spices up front with sweet caramel malt, butter, toasted bread, hints of roasted nuts, orange & herbal hops in the finish. Bitterness develops lightly after mid-sip, intensifying into the aftertaste where it begins to fade. Produces a spicy, lightly roasted & bitter aftertaste. Alcohol presence is minimal in the nose & mouth but is more prominent in the mouth especially in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth, tongue coating, slightly oily & chewy. This is quite tame compared with some the American craft Winter Warmers being offered. Strongly reminds me of what might be called robust British pale ale. It certainly has the buttery character I have come to expect from British pale ales."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and i thought it was a solid example of the style, it wasn't nearly as spiced as most American Winter Warmer's and while that did help make it more drinkability, it also made the taste a little more bland than it could be.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, pretty creamy, a little crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one is my limit, anymore than that and I would start to get bored with it, but it does drink smooth.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both good and to me they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, when it came to the taste and aroma it seemed like the English Ale yeast was a little too dominating.  I don't think I would buy this again, but I wouldn't turn one down, there's just many more Winter Warmers that I would rather have.  I can't say I would really recommend this beer, but if your really into English Ales it might be worth a try.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love, I feel like it needs a little bit of work, but it does have some potential , there were some things I liked and some that I did not.  This isn't a favorite for this brewery and it falls about in the middle for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a solid ale, keep up the solid work."

"Pours a very faint amber with some head which leaves a sticky lacing on the glass. Smells  faintly of malt and slight hops.  Tastes slightly sour and bitter.  The bitterness may be a little too much; the sourness is nice.  Slightly boozy--a little more than I care for--but not bad.  Very nice mouthfeel--creamy and rich.  It's a nice beer for the winter, and even with better options, I don't think you could go wrong with a bomber of this."

"O- This is my first English Winter Warmer and it is definitely different from the American takes on the style I have had, many which are loaded with holiday spices.  I was a bit surprised by how over carbonated the beer was and at 6% ABV it wasn't a big warmer."
""
""
"O:  Overall a pretty solid Winter Warmer.  The flavors seem kind of soft but the complexity is nice and all the flavors are there.  fairly low in bitterness but it's still an enjoyable winter brew"
"Overall this was succinct and well put together, mild spicing and hop character and a good balance. Only point was the flavour is a bit mild, lies on the malts and some floral no spice character, drying finish. I think this would be great on cask, from the bottle it is fairly middle of the road."

"550 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, bottled on 7/17/2014. Pours slightly hazy orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, plum, apple, fig, date, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, plum, apple, fig, date, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, plum, apple, fig, date, light pepper, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice English pale ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Received this from a buddy as a housewarming gift.  Better than anticipated, as I am not normally a fan of the winter style ales."
"A bit underwhelming in pretty much every regard. I think I had higher expectations for it, but it was a fine ale. Not something that will steal the show, or a holiday party, but a decent, if somewhat boring beer."

"Pouring a vibrant copper, Samuel Smith Winter Welcome Ale gives off a pleasantly caramel-biscuit smell laced with hints of holiday spices.  The gingerbread and allspice notes give way to a subtly fruity undercurrent.  On the palate, there's a good amount of the caramel and biscuit malt flavors, but they're accompanied by an earthy flavor of hops with notes of subtle citrus and grass.  The subtly builds with raspberry and red fruit flavors joining in.  The body is moderate, slightly carbonated, and slightly bright and bitter.  The ending is clean, with earth, fruit, and spice subtly vanishing."

"My first winter warmer and really the beer that got me into craft beers 10 years ago. This malty delicious treat is something I look forward to every winter. It never gets old."

""

""

"O: A decent winter warmer, though I don't know that I'll repeat it. At least, unless the 550 ml bottle is on sale at Jungle Jim's for less than $3 again."
"I've enjoyed this beer for 20 years and hope to do so for another 20. Perfect in it's own way. Malt and yeast with a hint of Euro hops. Cheers"
""
""
""
"Welcoming winter with a beer like this wouldn't be my strategy but overall this is a decent English brew. Perhaps a bit too much apple and pear feel but nice malts and Euro hops."
"I like the generous hop presence in this, even if it's not the piney, resinous, aggressive hops we're used to here in the United States. This brew is certainly a good way to welcome winter, at least as far as the caramel sweetness and the creaminess, but I feel it may be overcarbed to quite be the slow sipper I envision for winter."
""
""
""
"This is kinda average-seeming these days, but drinks fine. I give it extra props because it kinda seems like an old-school classic. I do wish it had a more 'winter warmer' feel though (spice, deeper malts), this could pass as an English pale to me."

"2014/2015.  Clear medium amber pour with a nice dark ruby cast.  Exceptional massive head, lacing and retention.  Nice nose of caramel malt, a bit of biscuit and a classic mineral note.  Slightly above light medium body with a smooth texture.  Excellent carbonation with a nice effervescence throughout.  The crisp, well constructed, flavor profile is intense, balanced and complex.  It begins with toasty biscuit that flows to caramel sweetness.  The middle effervesces nicely into a Goldings flavored medium bitterness over a distinct mineral note.  The crisp finish effervesces nicely into a somewhat dry slow fade that leaves you with a nice bit of bitter hop flavor over a biscuit sweetness with hints of citrus and dark fruit. As everything fades away, the mineral note dominates over a slight pepper like note of spice."
""
"Overall: I had tried some good Sam Smith's lately so I thought I'd give this a try on the first real cold day we had. Unfortunately I was let down with it. I was hoping for a little bit more warmth in some way and the grassy flavor comes off musty and not too good with the rest of whats going on."

"Pours a pretty burnt hazy orange in color with a thin with cap. Some 'ring-like' lacing is seen with each sip that stays around for a bit. Looks like rings on a tree stump. The aroma is of malts, hint of nuts, brown sugar and some spice. More going on with the taste with come maple and caramel sweetness in the mix as well. Very tasty and smooth as I wasn't sure how this one would be.. Goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall a great brew!"

"Nutty, solid maltiness. Smooth, slightly dry hops balance it out nicely. I've never been disappointed in Samuel Smith's beers and this one continued the trend. An easy to drink beer that goes perfectly with almost anything, especially as the temperatures dip."
"Nice caramel color with a rich, long-lasting head.  Malty, nutty aroma.  Rich and malty on the palate with caramel and maple sweetness.  Hints of roasted nuts.  Subtle earthy hop to balance.  Mild spices.  Very well balanced.  Medium bodied and incredibly smooth.  Very easy to drink.  Just an all around stellar winter ale."

"Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome Ale brewed by Samuel Smith Old Brewery with an ABV of 6.0% this brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice white, head. This is a filtered brew; you can see right thought it. The smell is rich with grains and some bitterness. Not much else to say out the smell of this brew. As far as the taste it is nice a crisp, but smooth at the end. You pick up on the grains in this brew. Winter Welcome Ale has a nice balance to it ,there is nothing overpowering in this brew. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. Samuel Smith old Brewery did a nice job with this brew. overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would get this brew again."

"Overall: Another great offering from one of the best breweries in the world. Quite appropriate for the time of year."
"Can't recommend, even at $2/16.9oz. This brew has simply too many parts and pieces missing. Not complex, balanced, blended, or thought out."
""

"Pours a medium brown with minimal head. Smells malty and clean. Not much going on and has a slightly bitter finish. Clean tasting but not much substance at all. Very thin. Carbonation is low to medium. I was expecting a thicker more substantial beer due to the winter ale moniker. A bit disappointed in this one."
"Notes of toffee, caramel, malt, toast and subtle English hops prevail throughout the nose. With each sip, the same notes are revisited, though the carbonation carries the flavors throughout the palate. The flavors are never perceived as overly sweet- or ""extracty"" as some other winter warmers can come across. Finishes a touch dry, but that makes you want to take another sip."

""

"Bottle poured into large stemmed ice tea glass. Enjoying after a nice winter/spring hike through the woods in Pocono Pines. Appears bright orange copper with very nice steady carbonation and head that fades to thin film. Some lacing on the glass sides. Smells of chestnuts & hazelnuts with woody, earthy hop aroma. Tastes nutty & sweet upfront with light caramel touch. Some candied fruit seems evident. Sweet malt taste fades to even bitterness that helps round this one out. Mouthfeel is medium to full. This beer reminds me of cracking open some nuts on a cold winter day while tending to a fire."

"OVERALL- never got the whole winter angle, not exceptionally warming, just a super-solid UK ESB that goes down smooth"
""
"Overall/Comments: Winter Welcome Ale is a great beer that is done very well on every level. Well balanced with a nice nose and tasty flavor profile. A must try. Consumed 12/25/2013. Classified as a Winter Warmer @ 6.00% ABV."

"Winter is Coming! I guess its already here for those in the northern hemisphere. I look forward to this one every year. I used to pick up the bomber or two and have one on the solstice day to bring it on in. This year I waited a few days because of various reasons. Nevertheless I was turned on to this beer over a decade ago by a good friend who loved it dearly. On to the review. What a pretty beer this is, it pours a beautiful toffee color. The head remains pretty well intact over the several minutes I gave it to settle. The smell is of Christmas candies and malt, very little hop character shows up in this one. I am a hop fiend if you didn't already guess, but I do like this one for reasons unbeknownst to me. The taste is very similar to the aroma, it has a nice thick sweet mouth feel, almost cloying, but not. It takes you to the edge but reels you back in at the last minute. Overall, I do have a special place in my heart for this one and it brings back a certain time in my life where things were better than I ever would have realized they were while living them. Nevertheless, I do not oversell this one, it is a good beer and one to search out to warm you on those long winter nights that could very well last for years."

"The beer pours a deep golden-orange color, with a big fat and sudsy head of off-white bubbles that leave sticky tendrils of lacing on the glass. The head has a great lasting retention that I expect from such a beer, and the beer overall looks like a classic “ale,” if that makes any sense. The beer’s body is gorgeously clear, and it really sits in the glass as a pretty sight to see. On the nose, the beer smells of sweet malt, almost like apple-juice with a touch of vinous, white wine thrown in. Soft, minerally scents mingle with the sweet malt and further suggest a Pinot Gris or sweeter white wine to the nose. Soft caramel bread and tart green apples hide in the edges of the scent, but definitely add further definition. I enjoy the smell of this beer more and more as it opens up, but I can’t help but think of it more as a sweet white wine. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and vinous with a solid bitter middle and finish. Tart, malic acid seems to be light but present in the beer and a soft spice mingles with the bitters nicely. The beer is very much a testament to balances, though it gives a nice vinous sweetness as the strongest character. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet white wine, almost in the pinot gris range, with soft notes of green apple and cider. It then suddenly opens into beer with a wash of bready malts and a nice herbal bitterness that balances out the vinous sweet of the beer and carries it into an earthy finish with a touch of generic holiday spices and apple juice. The finish is middling in length, with sweet crackery malt, dry cider, and good-old English hops. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a middling to strong carbonation, a light astringency from the hops, and a thinner, highly drinkable mouthfeel with just enough weight to remind us its beer. The mouth is left dry save for thick saliva in the cheeks and a bitter tingle along the middle of the tongue. Overall, this beer is good. It is far different from other Winter Warmers and Christmas beers that I have had, and initially it disappointed me. Once I got past the fact of its subtlety, however, I was able to appreciate the beer as yet another balanced and superb creation from Sam Smith. This beer nicely showcases what can be done with malts, hops, and a little touch of spices. I’m not wild about sweet white wines, but I found the character interesting. This is a light and highly chuggable winter warmer that is defined by its subtlety and balance. A great execution of the individual parts of brewing."

"Very nice flavor combining caramel malt, apple or pear-like fruit notes, and bitterness from the hops. Problem is, the flavor is too muted; would love for them to amp this up a little bit."
""
"Overall 3.75: A good beer. Balanced, sessionable and very enjoyable. It is a striking looking beer, it has a unique taste and I would recommend it to all who enjoy English ales. Worth a shot for those of you who are not fans of English ales."
""
""
""

"Overall: Not my favorite winter warmer, and frankly not very following of the style. Some spicy warming notes, but little malt character overall. Not a bad beer by any means, just not what I was expecting."

"Overall: I was overall impressed with this brew. I am not a fan of many of the spiced winter warmers which is probably a reason why I enjoyed this one so much. There are very few, if any traces of spices added here. Incredibly drinkable and I will definitely be getting a couple more of these before the season is over."
"Copper color of a pale ale, nose is fruity, vegetal, corn husk, herbal botanical. Tastes of mild grain, masa, fruity yeast, ending on a soft hop bite. Fully carbonated, slightly boozy at the finish. Easy and reminiscent of an ESB, I don't get the Winter Warmer aspect of it. Enjoyable non-the-less."
"O- easy drinking with big malty notes, but nothing extreme. A serviceable winter warmer that isn't over-heavy on the spices like some"
""
"Overall - Ugh. Not worthy of another bottle."
""

"not the conventional American style winter warmer, but a nice incarnation of something comparable. the pour is clear and brassy, super light for what I was expecting, and flaunting a sensational inch and a half of snow white foam that puffs up above the rim of my globe. light English malt nose, honey sweet, but also bittering hops to balance things. a rather bland, or rather mellow smell and taste to this. its sort of gentle, not a true winter warmer, but more of an introduction to the season as the name suggests. this works in late October, but im not sure how well it would go in January. 6% abv is nice for sessioning, but not so much for warming. I don't taste much spice either, which is okay amidst all the pumpkin ales around right now. medium body, enough gravity, and some bitter to counter the sweet in the conclusion. a solid beer overall, but not one I will probably go back to honestly."
"Pours bright orange amber with a 1 finger off white head. Very sweet aroma, plum and sweet caramel are the biggest notes. Brown sugar and toffee are also there. The. Taste is loaded with caramel and toffee, fresh not roasted. Hints of vanilla hit about mid mouth, with some butterscotch and black pepper sneaking in for the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a huge dose carbonation. Perhaps too much carbonation. Could use a bigger dose of alcohol to add a bit of depth. Overall, it's a decent little trip into the winter ales, but there are a lot more bigger bolder beers In this style for this to have lasting appeal."

"Poured a cloudy reddish brown color, small white head. Aroma sweet caramel and spices with a bit of yeast notes. Taste is sweet mildly toasted caramel malt , yeast and bready with some toffee sweet spices and a bit of brown sugar flavors. A medium sweet body, smooth with mild carbonation. Finishes with caramel , spices, yeast, and toffee with some mild bitterness . Caramel malt seems to dominate the flavor. Not as overpowering as some other winter ales but overall a good drinking brew."

"Winter welcome ale pours a bronze color with very little head. Their is a sweet, caramel apple like aroma, with hints of a toasty malty undertone. Their is a slight roasted malty undertone in taste, with strong hints of caramel and sweet fresh apples. Easy to drink, and very nice feel, and nice full flavors. Overall a very unique winter warmer, sweet and fruiterer."

"The body has a rolling smoothness and a nice heft, but the crispness bites hard, and it never lets go. The dryness takes a bit of a toll on the palate as well. Otherwise, it's good, but it takes some sitting to tame that bite."

"O- This is a highly drinkable ale! I agree with a prior review in the confusion about what style this should be listed as, but regardless, I think this makes a fine English Ale! The alcohol content is slightly deceiving going from nose to palate, but it's very well balanced, if not slightly underwhelming flavor wise, but does the job with the style. I recommend this one and will purchase again in the future!"

"Poured into a pint glass and a nice creamy head developed which retained and laced well, was a biscuit color. Appearance was dark amber and cloudy. Aroma was sweet and of spice with hints of bread and toffee. Taste was sweet, almost a maple taste, with a bready, spicy note. Mouthfeel was creamy and full. with a sweet, almost syrupy aftertaste."

"Is it just me, or does ""Winter Welcome"" sound like a sex act of some kind...? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of frothy cream-white foam. The nose comprises biscuit, very light dried honey, and the lightest possible kiss of earthy greens. The taste holds notes of funky wheat, dried honey, light biscuit, light grass, and a slightly heavier touch of earthy greens than before. Things don't meld all that well, though. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, a sad, muddled, and otherwise nondescript and forgettable little brew."

"This beer is an amber beauty with good head and lacing. The smell is herbal with a sweet aroma. There is a good hop presence in the taste, which adds to the surprisingly dry mouthfeel. Underneath the dryness you can sense plenty of esters and malt. The interplay of dry and sweet fascinates me. Craftsmanship is excellent. Overall I recommend this as a very good Samuel Smith brew."
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. A nice deep maple, medium brown with hints of amber. A respectable 1+ finger of off-white head with nice retention and lacing. Smell is of nutmeg and spices with a hint of cloves and possible corriander. Very pleasant and inviting. Taste follows the nose with a nice blend of seasonal spices, malts and a touch of hops. I like the subtle blend of spice with the rich malts. Not overpowering on the spices as some warmers can be. Feel is medium carbonation with a dryish finish. Overall- A nice, decent warmer with a good blend of ingerdients. Samuel Smith is a great outfit and although the stouts are top notch, this is a solid beer and a must try-"
" Appearance of dark maple syrup color with a full, creamy head that retains for several minutes. Smells of bread and spice with a taste much the same. Not a cloying sweet or overly-spiced flavor as some winter warmers tend to have. Medium-bodied, lots of maltiness and dry finish on the palate. Enjoyed this one enough to look for it again next year when I want a drinkable holiday ale."
""
""

"An OK brew but rather one-dimensional. It's all about the malt and this becomes boring as you work your way through the glass. Well made, with the flavour tending towards caramel and a hint of alcohol (to warm you up in winter). Too bad it doesn't hold your attention - I can't help thinking that the addition of some darker malts would improve it. Drinkable but nothing special; no need to seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. If I were picking a category I would call this a hoppy ESB rather than a winter ale. Samuel Smith makes decent beer, this is another solid example of their work."
""
"It's a nice and flavorful winter ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid, drinkable winter warmer on the lower end of alcohol content for the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer. Not the best I've ever had, certainly, but for someone that has begun to see American Craft Beer as being more original and expansive than its European counterparts, this is a beer that would make me buy some more European brews. I recommend grabbing a bottle while this is still in season."
""
""
"Easy drinking English Ale, nothing really outstanding, but good flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O- Another solid SS offering. A very good intoductory ale for the non-craft drinker. I can see this brew appealing to most beer drinkers. Smmoth at 6.0 abv, as well."
""
"Rather than going through each facet of the review- this ale is a golden ale. That's about it. However, they did ""ale"" as well as can be asked- instead of looking for odd ingredients or a new twist, Samuel Smith's went and made an ale that is very good. The smell is malty- not unusual, except that it is good malts, and with nothing strange added. The taste is also malty, a slightly bitter ale with a hint of caramel and yeastiness- again, nothing unusual, except that they pulled it together quite well. Overall, this is more a very good execution of a standard, traditional brew rather than something new and unique. I'm quite happy!"
""
"Pours an orange-amber color with easily two fingers of cream colored head at pour. The head lingers well and excites easily. Some lacing on the glass. As for the aroma its a pretty standard bitter aroma - English malting and hops. There is a hint of spice. Spice is more present on the taste but a fairly mild winter warmer - still good."

"Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome Ale ---3/5."
"Decent. Nothing to make you want to buy more than one or two. Enjoyable still."
""
""
"It's held up fairly well. Developed some nice esters over the years, but definitely passing its prime...a tad oxidized and watery."
"O- Pretty average, but not bad. Not sure what exactly makes the winter warmer style, but this one tastes pretty plain."

"The 2012/2013 release. Not aware if they keep the same recipe or not. Very clear gold amber color with huge pure white head that recedes to a full cap the entire brew. Bitter yet savory smell. Raw grain aromas as well. Some bitterness at first graduating to being chalky and metallic like. Pretty dry with a subtle honey like sweetness. A little more bitter than sweet though. Also getting some notes of tea. Very nice creamy smooth body with average carbonation. Bitter dry aftertaste."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium, pleasant. Overall, it's not a masterpiece, but it's pretty solid."
""
"Overall not great especially for a Samuel smith beer. Just a very average English ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Despite my love for Samuel Smith's beers in general, I'm not really a fan of this one. Its character is pretty one-dimensional and the spice character isn't very pronounced. Everything just gets drowned out by the overriding caramel, so it's just way too sweet and simplistic."
""
"Great beer, but it tastes more like a really good Oktoberfest than a winter beer... Don't really know if I am upset about that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not really like anything going on over here in the states, this brew is packed full of malty goodness and very light on the spices. A solid brew, but nothing really overwhelming"
""
"Pours tawny brown with a near solid sheet of fine whites. Vanilla, tea, nougat, some almond and sweet malts come through the nose. Tastes fairly simple and subtle. A good malty beverage with some fruity notes from the english yeast, some sweetened plum and bread flavors. Medium bodied with low carb and an overal silkiness I get in most sam smith beers. A nice enough drinking beer, but not likely going to get it again. Reminds me of a thickened kristalweizen."
"O- Very pleased with this beer, it is dynamic, yet simple, and every sip makes me want to come back for more. I will buy this beer again for sure. I guess my only negative is that it is lower gravity for a Winter/ Christmas Ale at only 6.0ABV. I would really enjoy a slightly higher gravity that warms you a little more. If this is available in your area give it a try, it won't disappoint."
""
""
""
"Overall- Not a bad ale but not amazing either. I do enjoy that it's not overly powerful in any one taste and blends together quite well. Combines together to make an enjoyable ale especially on a nice winter night. Will buy again."
""
"If this is a type of winter warmer, give me more! Definitely don't see how this could be a seasonal release for the cold weather except for the alcohol warming properties, but it's a very balanced, simple yet effective beer overall. I agree with others that releases of theirs such as their imperial stout would be more suitable for the cold weather, though. Sam Smith's never fails to disappoint in my life, and surely didn't here."
""
"Overall I'd call this a solid winter brew. It's pretty tasty, nicely balanced, and easy to drink. I'd enjoy this with Christmas dinner."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a medium brown with a small head that dissipates very quickly. Bittersweet aroma that I can't place. Overwhelming bitter flavor. Not the pleasant hoppy bitterness of a well- crafted ale, this is unpleasant and somewhat medicinal taste reminiscent of Silly Putty. Mouthfeel is thin and watery and the carbonation doesn't last-the beer goes flat rather quickly. I am disappointed in this one, as I'd heard good things about it. Really don't care for this. Drank about half and had to drainpour the rest. Won't be getting this again."

"Deep amber colour, finger of white head, good amount of lace on the glass. Smell is malty, sweet caramel and spices, fruity and almost comes across smelling exactly like a fruit cake. Taste is sweet and malty, some spice and lightly bitter, caramel, fairly one dimensional and a bit bland. Medium carbonation and medium bodied, decent medium full feel. Not great but not bad either, rather boring however, I finished half the bottle and that was more than enough for this, don't see myself coming back to this."
"Bright copper hue with a big fluffy off white head. Dark fruit cake smells with a hint of spice, touch of cinnamon raisin bread. Crisp and smooth with a rolling carbonation. Medium bodied with buttered toast flavors through on the sides of the tongue. Sweet sugared fruits on the tip of the tongue. Burnt toast ends on the back end of the tongue with english earthy hops that create a super dry yet balanced finish; balance between the semi-sweet fruityness an earthy bitternes, balance between the rich butteriness and dryness. Touch of alcohol heat warms the belly. I like it, much bigger and bolder than i expected from sam smith. creamy rich, meaty, buttery, dry and earthy. kind of tastes like a buttered and toasted piece of cinnamon raisin bread as it warms."
"Overall- This is a good beer. Definantly not the best from Sam Smith, but not bad either. I like my winter warmers to be on the boozier side with some very mild spice. This has neither. Still a fine beer though."
""
""
""
"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours translucent toffee brown with a white head that dissipates rather quickly. There's a moderate amount of tiny bubbles visible rising in the beer. The beer smells of bready and caramel malts with some earthy hops. The taste follows the nose. There's some breadiness and mild sweetness from the malts. There are some spicy and earthy hop flavors. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is clean. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."
""
"O - very balanced and on par for winter ales, and definitely well crafted. Taste Lingers on the palate. Although it is mild overall, it is delicious and very enjoyable/drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent beer that is worth a try. Not my favorite from Samuel Smith though. Ironically, for a chilly winter evening I would probably first turn to Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout or Imperial Stout rather than this 'Winter' seasonal offering. Tasty, but doesn't particularly suggest anything wintry to me!"

"500ml bottle. Gordon´s Thistle glass. Enjoyed on apr´12. Reddish orange in color, clear appearance. Off-white, medium size bubbled, crown. Fairly good retention. Citric fruits to the nose, coriander touch. Mildy malts, grapefruit zest & citric hops at first sip. Moderate fruitness & candies in the middle. Dry palate, gentle bitterness & lemon astringency. Full body, moderate carbonation. Slightly warming finish. Subtle woody note & orange hues on the aftertaste. Comment: very subtle saltiness both in flavors & aromas."

"This was a nice Winter Warmer. I lucked out by finding this given it's now the middle of April."
"Like the band Immortal, appropriately wintery. Perhaps less of the dead//dread/dark and being chase by demons through a snowy hell, and more sitting in front of a fireplace with friends. Not a bad cold weather option, but I'll stick with Sam Winter and Woodstock Inn's Wassail Ale."

"Good, but not great winter warmer."
"O: Overall, Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome Ale wasn't a bad beer, but it wasn't a great beer either. Where it gets better marks for its easy drinking and toasty character, between the hint of soy and the lackluster body it gets knocked down a few marks.I wouldn't pick this one over some of Samuel Smith's better offerings in the Ale Category (I wouldn't call this a winter warmer)."

"Overall, it lacks the many of the warming qualities you would expect from a Winter Warmer."

"Beer i drink when winter 2011-2012 is going to end. Poured in a pint glass. Look: bright brown wood, foam padded head with two fingers thick, excellent lacing, looks like water wood; Smell: caramel malt and hops of pine; Taste: dominated by wood with notable caramel malt and pine grass hops; mouthfeel is woody with medium bitterness, medium body, and soft carbonation; drinkability: although it has rich woody taste and none of its features i found defects, did not convince me much."

"Interestingly pale winter warmer, medium bodied and very drinkable."
""
""
"First impression was that this is one pretty beer. A nice copper color and fluffy head. Then the aroma. WOW. One of the best delights my sniffer has had in some time. The flavor is good, but maybe not very distinct which is probably the one criticism I'd give it. This is easy drinking an does not feel heavy. Overall I like it. Not a favorite since the flavor is not very robust but it's good. "
""
""
""
""
"O- Very balanced beer. Nothing to special but it is interesting in the sense that it is the first really pale winter warmer I've ever had. (compared to how dark most of the other winter warmer's ive had have been.) Delicious and refreshing."
""
""
""
"Served in a tulip on 2-20-12, a very clear and bright orange amber raises a nice frothy head. A mildly minty herbal nose delivers bright notes of sweet candied caramel, biscuity malt and peach nectar fruit. Complex jammy fruit and toasted bread flavors spread nicely along the palate into a tasty echoing sticky finish. Carbonation seems spot on for optimum balanced flavor and hop bitterness is just subtle but mends everything together really effectively."
""
"Surprisingly refreshing Given that it's 6%. Goes down really easy. Nice medium body. Liked this one more and more as I drank it. I'm partial to English ales and this one being a bit stronger allowed for a more complex brew. Sadly can't get this one in Quebec"
"Only when I got to the end of the bottle did I feel the effects of the alcohol. For a winter beer, I like to at least taste a bit of it to go with the caramel, dark bread, or spice that many of them are known for. Without a label, this would have been find to have opened up and enjoyed on its own. I do think this needs some tweaking and with so many other Winter beers available, this should only be enjoyed by those who can't get enough Sam Smiths."
""
""
""
"pretty simple beer and its way overpriced at 8$ a bottle, sitting next to some of the other offerings from Sam Smith I doubt I'd but this again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is definitely tasty, but I wouldn't wait and/or clamour over it. Overall, it's one of the milder winter beers that I have had this season and I'm not quite sure how to feel about that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very pleasing brew, and another welcome addition to the range of holiday beers that haven't been spiced beyond recognition. Indeed, this is fairly simple fare--hops and malts--in relatively normal quantities and strengths. The sugars and fruit esters are cranked up a notch or two for the holidays, somewhat setting this beer apart, but mainly this is just good, solid beer. It doesn't quite qualify as world-class, but it's certainly at the upper end of ""good," and worth trying."
""
"Pours an amber color with a moderate fluffy head. Scents of malts, caramel, and sugar. While the scent is on the weaker side, the taste is a lot stronger than you would expect from the smell. The taste of different malts hit you taste buds hard while you get some taste of sweetness from the caramel malts and sugar. The spices help to finish off this beer with a mellow, drier finish. Smooth, mellow, and rather well made!"
""
""
""
"Overall – not a bad brew at all. Pretty subtle in most of its characteristics, but still good-tasting and decently interesting to taste."
""
"Not the most interesting Sam Smith beer, but not a bad little beer to sit back and enjoy. Its fairly easy to drink and the spices add a bit of complexity. But overall, I probably wouldn't buy it again. Worth one 4-pack though for sure."
""
""
"This isn't what I'd expect for the style, but I don't want to argue semantics with a brewery that's been doing this for a quarter millennium. And there is something warm and fuzzy about a beer that pretty much tasted like this 2011/2012 batch did 200 years ago."
"Overall: Meh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am on the same page as the one Alstrom brother...I too have a good nostalgic love for Samuel Smiths as they were the first quaily beers we drank in New York City early 90's before the nightclubs to avoid the over priced crap beers there. This offering is good, but the dryness is a bit over the top and is not a session beer in my opinion. If you have not tried this winter welcome from Samuel Smiths, it is well worth buying, but I prefer their nut brown Ale and/or oatmeal stout. Cheers!!"

"A bit disappointing given the typical quality of this famous brewery. Certainly not bad or flawed, but not bold, rich or complex."

"O: Not bad as English ales go, but well below my expectations for Samuel Smith."
"Here's a little secret: enjoy this with your Christmas chocolate. Seriously."

"DOA"
"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into a pint glass, 2011 version. This pours an amber color with a large white head. The smells are of spices, and malts, slight hop presence. The feel is medium to light. The taste is good, some spices, and malts slight hop presence."
"O-definitely one of the most mild (in terms of flavor) but most bitter winter warmers that i've ever had. not really digging this beer, but it is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability-- bring it on, yeah. Or, depending on the year, go find something better! Seriously though-- a very decent beer and worth finding one every holiday season and then going from there."
""
"I like this winter warmer. It is not overly hopped and is missing the spices many add. It is a nice change of pace example of the style. As usual with this fine brewery, well done!"
""
"Pours a crystal clear dark amber with a 1 inch puffy orange-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thick foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasty malt, caramel, and some fruity aromas. Taste is of sweet malt, caramel/toffee, fruit, and some slight herbal hops on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that quickly fades from the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that I could drink all year if it was available."
"O: Not bad at all! About the worst I could say is that it didn't make my head explode with excitement. Even still, it's great enough to be a go-to winter beer for me."
"O - Solid beer in a style that doesn't get much recognition. Really hit the spot on a cold night, and would absolutely fabulous with a little stronger aroma."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent beer. I was expecting something with more emphasis on the spices. Also seems a little too malty for my own personal liking."
"Quite simple and wonderful holiday ale, just perfect for Christmas Day."

""
"The Rest: Very tasty and highly drinkable, I quite enjoyed this beer. A nice alternative to most American winter seasonal."

"O: Worthy of a once a year purchase. This brewery hasn't let me down."
""
""
"O - A very nice winter beer to enjoy on a cold night. A good medley of flavors, especially since I am not a huge fan of apple flavors in beer. Good aromas and body round this out to be a good pick for the season."
""
""
""
"O/D - Meh. A pretty solid EPA, but I wouldn't call this a 'winter beer' by any stretch. If I was rating it to style it'd be much lower, but I like it for what it is, just a well crafted, but not outstanding English ale."
""
""
"Overall - Not one of my favorite Sam Smith's but one of the better winter warmers I've tried."
"O - Nothing bad about this beer but nothing special or noteworthy. It's just average. You could easily have a few of these in a row if you're looking for an easy drinking winter ale."

""
"Remember this from last year as being better, but I know my palate has changed quite a bit. Typical Sam Smith qualities. House yeast (I presume), english hops, malt character. Enjoyable overall, but there are better winter warmers."
""
"O- I personally love Samuel Smith's house character, and this beer seems ready made to show it off, I'll be searching this one out in the future."

""
""
""

"2011 vintage. Poured this into my imperial pint glass. Came out looking auburn-tan, with an amber head. Has a aroma reminiscent of a red ale, or perhaps a Scotch ale on the lighter side of thing. Perhaps that’s the base? There’s a muted to barely perceptible hop aroma, a malty-caramelly sweetness that develops as it warms, and a sticky/chewy finish that reminds me of a DIPA without the hoppiness, or a light barleywine. Definitely a winter warmer in all sense of the term."
""
"o-a good offering from one of my favorite international breweries. never enjoyed it too much in the past but feel as though my palate developed and can now appreciate all the subtle flavors in this winter ale."
""
""
""
"Drink- A whole lot lighter than I thought and a lot different than I thought. I was expecting a dark roasty malty warming beer. This was way off from that but still better than average in flavor and feel."
""
"Overall, it was okay."
""
"Overall After years of drinking this I still look forward to it each and every year. There might be some winter welcomes out there with more flavor but this is one that I use as the bar for judging winter welcomes"
"Overall: A solid winter warmer. Nice mix of malts and fruit flavors."
"I will probably get this again."
""
""
""
"This is a decent beer, but it's hardly complex. Honestly, this is a typical beer. It's not intricate or special as one would expect from a seasonal. I'd have it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
""
""
"O - Tasted ok, but really light for a winter beer. I was expecting more of a roasted malt flavor and spices."
""
"O: I think this is a great winter warmer and love the fact that no holiday spices are added. Though it isn't the most complex beer in the world, Winter Welcome is a real cold weather treat, a malty, sustaining ale that will definitely keep you nourished. If you're a fan of English ales and/or beers that tend to be more malt-driven, you'll love this one."
""
""
""
"Malt is center stage. Lacks the spice of some other winter ales, but the flavors here are welcomed nonetheless."
"O-Pleasant enough. Not very interesting."
""
"T: Lots of toasted malts with a slight caramel/toffee note in the background that's tempered by some prickly hops. Slightly peppery and dry finish. Not bad, but also not something I could drink a ton of."
"Overall - Definitely not up to snuff with the other Sam Smith beers I have sampled. Quite disappointed actually. Needless to say I'll be avoiding this for my future holiday beer purchases."
""
"Overall, this is simply a must-have every year for me. It's very drinkable and really, Samuel Smith's is good in everything they do."
""
"O - Nicely balanced brew, while malty in flavor is nice and dry with a crisp refreshing finish."
"Conclusion: Don't age this beer :) But if if happen to by accident, it won't be all that bad."
""
""
"Overall, an enjoyable seasonal offering. As the bottle suggests, this beer should be contemplated before an open fire. I'm curious how time may have impacted this beer. I would like to find a current year version and try it fresher. What I do like is that the flavors are well orchestrated and nuanced. Makes you think about them while you drink and does not take the hit-you-in-the-head-with-a-2X4-approach to winter seasonals. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would definitely get this again!"
"This is the first English-made warmer I have had, and the spices are not nearly as prominent as in its North American brethren. I appreciate that immensely - as a general rule I don't mind a little spice in my beer but I tend to believe a little goes a long way as far as these ingredients are concerned. This beer seems to come from that same school of thought, and so it should not be surprising that I find this to be the perfect light sipper for an evening by the fireplace. There is little doubt I will be picking this up again before the season is over. Something most ESB fans will appreciate, even if lovers of the spicy American warmers probably won't."
"The drink is not necessarily bad, it is just so plain in every sense of the word. There have not been any winter warmers so far that have impressed me. And this one does not change that opinion."
"Overall this is a solid winter beer, its fairly complex and a nice break from the various spiced beers that come out this time of year. Plus the price is excellent for what you get which makes this beer worth buying."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad winter warmer. Not my favorite but I will try this again."
""
"Good seasonal ale."
""
""
"This beer is definitely a sipper and drinks stronger than the 6% abv would imply. It is a unique beer and a pretty good representation of the style."
""
"O - A bit like a cross between a spiced brown & an amber ale, but with those subdued British hops. Everything is in balance and it drinks nicely, but somewhat muddled & slightly sweet after a full bottle. Certainly classic, but probably not quite to my tastes."
""
""
"Can't say there's anything real special about this one, but it's pleasant enough without any real strikes against it. I'd love to try this on cask."
""
""
""
""
"Good ale but not great. I give it a solid B."
"O: Great winter beer. Its not spiced, but complex enough to keep you interested. The ABV is medium(aleast for americans) but really does a good job a warming you up. Great beer."
"Pours a very nice dark copper color with a craggy head that goes nowhere. Very nice looking beer, it is a bit fizzy. Scents of slight sweet spices but nothing that grabs me. Very smooth medium bodied beer. Very pleasant. No overwhelming spices like most winter warmers these days. A bit of mint and cinnamon hit the nose. Very easy to drink. I was more pleased with this one than I expected. Definite buy every winter season!"
"I will buy this again tomorrow probably! This is my first Samuel Smiths beer ever I am really looking forward to trying more from there range of beers."
"Overall, a disappointing beer from Samuel Smith. Not bad, but it doesn't stand out in any way, and the metallic aspect of the taste is unfortunate. I will stick to the Oatmeal Stout, thank you very much."
"D: I expected a lot more from an ale called Winter Welcome, categorised as a winter warmer, and described on the label as a full-bodied, complex sipping ale for cold nights. As it stands, the 2011/12 Winter Welcome tastes and drinks like a good ESB but falls entirely short of this style; I've represented this with a low overall grade. There's nothing to be done but treat it like an ESB instead, and hope that the bottle I'm cellaring for the year will be better."
"O - A tasty ale, but could be amped up a bit on the spices. I like a bold flavour winter warmer, this one was rather luke warm for the style."
"Not a bad one."
"Pours a clear golden red, with a slightly offwhite head. Some sticky lace and a some fairly decent head retention. Nose has almost nothing, light malts, some bread and a hint of butter. Almost like a maltier English Pale Ale of sorts, doesn't suggest anything to with a ""winter warmer."" Taste redeems slightly, slightly sugary bread notes, a bit of caramel malt as well. Maybe a sliver of of spicing, but it's almost indiscernible. A bit of heat on the back end, and a touch of metal as well. Medium body and a carbonation that is adequate, but has a bit of a bite at times. Not sure what the deal with this one is, but I'm unimpressed with this as a winter warmer. Maybe bottling date plays into this somehow?"
"I don't get this beer or this style if it is representative of the Winter Warmer style. It is an English Pale Ale right? Hoppier yes, it seems like an ESB to me. I don't get the connection to Winter. There is nothing wrong with this beer it just doesn't give me a reason to love it. I've been buying Samuel Smith's beers for 14 years and consider most of them among my very favorite beers but I could never get my arms around this one. Still, I had to review it."
"Overall this is acceptable nothing that really grabs at me, but nothing highly offensive or off putting either. If I had the choice though I would grab something else. In reality this doesn't taste like... anything.. really it seems kind of lifeless."
"Overall a decent brew that did not blow me away like the brewer's other offerings I have sampled."
"Overall it has held up quite well for last years offering. Maybe some tones of cherry, cinnamon, and nutmeg but will have to confirm with the 2011 version."
"O: Well... it's not something I would usually go for, but it strangely reminded me of winter/Christmas time of year so it must be doing something right. The beer would benefit from a highly alcohol percentage and a fuller body, though it goes down very easy. I See no problem with having this beer at least once a year. Worth picking up, especially for the price. I will not save the bottle."
"O - Very good winter warmer and is always useful when the weather gets cold."
"QUITE NICE, CHECK IT OUT!"
"O - this is an original winter warmer and a pretty good one. A good brew for the cold temperatures just around the corner. This is Samuel smiths through and through. Not the best winter warmer In this day and age, but still an excellent choice for the winter months. Definitely something that will be found in my refrigerator this winter."
"Poured a 2"" custard head which held on a while. Nice clear dark amber body. Quite aromatic, I didn't even have to be near the glass to smell it, strikes me as herbal and some spices. Taste has some caramel, much less of the spice than the smell, and other characteristics I find hard to put a finger on. It's medium rich with a medium length finish. All in all a nice beer."
"Overall, an impressive and unexpected collision of flavors. Sam Smith can do no wrong."
"This beer is pretty tasty, but it lacks a lot of things. The flavors are somewhat muted. This makes it very approachable, but those looking for a big-flavored holiday beer may be disappointed. It's still a good beer and I would definitely drink it again. The best part about this beer is that even though it's only 6% ABV, it does actually warm you up a bit. Drink this beer slow, letting it warm up over time, and your mind will eventually start to wander towards red sweaters and the crackling of a fireplace."
"O: This is a great cold-weather beer. Very enjoyable. I think I'll be buying it again in December. I can't imagine drinking this with food, it feels like an after-dinner beer. I can't see drinking two in a row, but it would fit in well with some other English ales."
"This brew poured out as an orange color, not quite what I expected but pretty nice looking. The head was white and fluffy. The smell of the beer has some sweet malts blended with some winter spice notes that balance the aromas nicely. The taste of this beer is a little on the light side but remains pretty good. It's got that typical English flavor to it with the spices in the mix. The mouthfeel is decent, roughly medium bodied and has average carbonation. Overall not a bad winter brew, but not my favorite either."
"Drink: Glad I tried it, but wouldn't do it again. There are plenty of much better winter warmers around."
"Overall: Not as malty as I was hoping for, but another great entry from this brewery. Definately reminded me of a far away winter in this sultry Mississippi heat wave."
"3.75 look, 4 smell 3.75 moutfeel 4.25 taste 4 Overall"
"Poured a clear amber with three fingers of head as a result of a vigorous pour. Bubbly carbonation noticeable. Toasty caramel malts in the aroma; spicy, with hops in the background. Nice caramel malt base, with spicy flavors of nutmeg, toffee, and a light fruitcake sensation. Hop bitterness follows, leaving a decent dry finish. Medium-bodied and quite drinkable."
"Overall this does make a good winter pint. It can easily be followed up by another but this is not a session beer and is a wee heavy. Overall good beer."
"This brew is very, very drinkable. Very easy drinking and would drink a case of it - nice. Very good winter warmer. The only thing I could see that could be a negative, is it is a bit low in the warming for a winter warmer. But hey its very good so who cares."
"Much recommended."
"O - Good ol' Sam Smith never disappoints. I recommend Winter Welcome and anything from this brewery. Try a pint!"
"D-I was honestly expecting something a little darker for some reason. It looks and drinks like a pale ale; I envisioned there being more of a spice profile as well, but it's very easy-drinking."
"Overall a decent, but not exceptional brew."
"D - My buddy brought a six that we shared and while I don't usually like holiday beers this one was very drinkable. The malty sweetness balanced nicely with a bitter hop aftertaste. Easy drinking, goes down like you would expect a 6.0% beer to. Looking forward to next year's edition."
"Overall nothing special definitely a very light beer that is very light in flavor. Which I find quite surprising coming from this brewer who puts out some of the best tasting beers in the world."
"D - Highly drinkable. This beer confuses me. The flavors are good but not great but I am really enjoying this beer alot."
"D- 4 This year's batch of SSWW is very welcoming indeed. It's not as powerful as some winters, but its sweet nuttiness and textures are definitely appealing. It is light enough to enjoy all night long if you dig the flavors. I've found it to be worth a shot each year I've tried it, and that goes unchanged this go-around."
"D: I was rather expecting something darker & more robust. This isn't really roasty or hefty enough to be a Winter Warmer. More sort of a an imperial summer mild. Or just an amped up ""festival"" version of a Pale. Rated as a hearty Pale, this is rather nice (but not as a winter warmer)."
"This is a descent brew, but doesn't fit the description of ""winter warmer"" very well. As a beer, it's awesome though! Enjoy this wonderful beverage anytime of the year, it's light enough to fit right in during a summer grilling session!"
"As a result, this is a ""dry"" winter warmer that is highly drinkable."
"Pours a light amber with a pearl one-finger head. Good retention and lacing. Light toffee and caramel aroma. Sweet, sticky caramel malt to start. Hint of timid hops, cinnamon and alcohol on the back end. Good malt character overall. Feels sticky and creamy on the tongue."
"May be my favorite Christmas seasonal. I didn't know what to expect from this, but I was certainly impressed!"
"D: While this beer is relatively good, there is something about it that doesn't sit well IMO."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall great Ale."
"Samuel Smith never disappoints me, this is a great beer."
"D: very high. May take a swig or two to get used to, but it really draws you in after a while and leads you wanting more"
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. Pours a dark copper with a commendable white head. Aroma of malt, caramel, molasses, along with some spice. Flavor is pretty solid- bitter malt, spice, and sweetness remains. Nothing too complex, but enjoyable and good for the cold weather. Decent palate, good beer but not as good as their oatmeal brew."
"It feels good on the palate; smooth, medium carbonation with a lingering flavor after the finish. Easy drinking, but I wish this had a bit more sweetness and a bit less yeasty eastery character. It's so close, but I won't be seeking it out again soon, however, if you put a glass in front of me, I would gladly drink it."
"D - Excellent, this is a balanced beer that I could drink all night, I definitely want another one."
"All in all, a decent beer, and definitely improved with a few years of age on it."
"D) A decent winter warmer. I'd drink another."
"Overall I am not impressed with this beer. Despite being complex, it was a little bland and watery at the same time which I find weird. Not at all what I would expect from a winter warmer. It's not a bad beer, its just not what I thought it would be."
"A 2010-2011 bottle. A super clear copper with decent head of white foam. Aromas of caramel and butterscotch. A firm herbal hops with a metallic/mineral note. Taste follows suit with a good balance of hops to sit on the sweet caramel and malt bread that is at the core of this one. A gentle fruit component pulls it all together. Feel is medium thickish with a perfect carbonation that is so right in the northern climes at winter. A dry quenching quality to the finish that leaves breadcrust and cereal lingering along with a leafy hops and mineral twang. One glass goes down easy and another would be nice. A solid winter ale, just nothing to make it stand out."
"D- I think my mind is getting the best of me on this one. I was expecting a darker and fuller beer since it's a ""winter"" beer. No problem finishing the bottle, but I'm thinking a darker roasted malt would have made this beer better..."
"Beer is medium in body and I really like this beer. I've been too cautious approaching this beer because it's really good. The back is moderately bitter, but the forward has this great malt backbone that carries throughout the beer. This is truly phenomenal. I would drink a case of this. It is that good. More please."
"Many years ago, when ales like this were rarities, I thought much more of them, but how the landscape has certainly changed..."
" Decent Brew, I am pleased and will probably suggest this to people"
"Drinkability: A very malty and English tasting beer. Not as spicy as others in the style. I could have a couple on a toasty night."
"Really not all that impressed although it has a certain smooth quality all around that makes it easy to drink."
"Medium body, crisp."
"drinkability: Frankly disappointed. Love some Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout but this one doesn't score for me."
"A pretty good beer, try it sometime!"
"M/D: Light to medium bodied with lower than expected carbonation. Overall a disappointment. Having had other beers from Sam Smith in the past I was excited to try this one, but it wasn't good."
"This beer is very caramel enfused. This beer is definitely only good as a seasonal as this is not an everyday drinker. The alcohol content is average, the beer is foamy with a lace of citrus to the finish, has a spicy aroma, and a rich golden coloring."
"The only flavor that really stands out to me is the caramel, I can pick up on some hops too, but just like every other sam smith brew its just extremely smooth and well balanced, its very drinkable, just the right amount of carbonation."
"D - A very drinkable brew that anyone could toss back all night. I appreciate it's drinkability and subtle toasted, spiced character but I would have liked just a bit more from both. Overall I think it's certainly worth a try and I wouldn't mind drinking it again although I may not buy it again."
"For a winter warmer, this is reasonably drinkable beer. Solid flavors and a good mouthfeel. I would recommend at least a single of it."
"Drank this quite easily. A little sweet and gassy, but very enjoyable"
"Extra notes- Overall good beer that is perfectly crafted for how its advertised. Now all I need is a fireplace."
"500 ml bottle. Pours copper with a never ending, foamy, off-white head and a lot of lacing. Aroma is of bready malt, grassy hops and hints of fruit. The body is full and smooth. Taste is earthy hops up front with caramel malt provide the balance, some hints of fruit as well. Long, dry finish. Good beer, but not great (end too expensive)."
"Drinkabilty - Its easy to enough but wish it had a little more flavor. Samuel smith beers are usually well balanced and tasty as all but this is a little lacking. Its not bad, good to drink every winter and low alcohol makes it that much more easy to drink."
"D/O- This drinks great on a winter evening. The spice factor is very refreshing. Cheers across the ""pond"" to Sammy Smiths."
"This is a very drinkable brew and while not the most best or most exciting beer, I definitely would have had another if there had been one around. I am not sure what makes this a winter ale, but it was a good tasting ale and that is all that counts."
"While it's got no major faults, there are no major strengths either, so it's drinkability is 50/50. If you just like to chug beer, have at it."
"This brew goes down very well. It's nice a smooth and has a wonderful flavor. It goes down easy and completely satisfying. This was a great winter brew. Its a not as big of a power house like some of the other holiday brews, but still a nice brew none the less."
"Poured from an 18.7 bottle into a Sam Smith's pint glass. Pours a beautiful copper-amber body with the classic SS's fluffy cotton candy head and lacing on the glass. Smells bready and of slightly metallic sweet malt with a pinch of hops. Tastes initially dry like a pale ale (cone hops) (sierra nevada-like) with an alcohol warmth finished with a wet feeling on the tongue. This flavour makes you want to keep taking another sip-overall an excellent beer with absolutely fresh ingredients!"
"Final Thoughts: I'm going to take a stab in the dark on this one, and say I think the water supply for this beer should be double checked. I can't shake the feeling that metallic twang is the sweeter elements conflicting with some hard water, something I don't think a pale ale would suffer from as badly but really hurts this beer. It's imperative that you warm this beer. Anyway Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Killer Kwanza and don't get KO'd this Boxing Day."
"Fairly drinkable, but certainly not a winter warmer. More of a mild ale, instead."
"D: meh. Decent, but disappointing."
"Pours an amber-coper colour with thick white head. Nice head retention and lacing around the glass. Smells of huge caramel malt with the faintest hints of some earthy hops. Some dark fruit in there too. Very sweet flavour, some mild bitterness. Very well balanced. Low carbonation makes this quite smooth. I typically buy a couple bottles of this every winter (or at least past 2 winters). Really nice beer."
"Drink - Another solid brew from Sam Smith; worth a try."
"Nice drinking brew, one I look forward to in the winter season."
"Overall impression: Easy recommendation here. Good stuff."
"Tasted of malt some yeast and dried apples, plus a residual tast of a tarnished penny. The carbonation gives this beer the body neede to be palatable, and if this was worth a second or third, it could be a session beer. It's better than budweiser. I do not think this is a good winter warmer. Your money better spent elsewhere."
"As an old friend, this beer is something I look forward to each year. If you haven't tried it--what are you waiting for. A winter classic."
"D: An enjoyable beer, although the taste didn't seem to live up to the anticipation based on the wonderful aroma."
"Drinkability: This was on sale and now I can see why. Not really impressive considering it is a samuel smith brew."
"Great aroma and good initial flavor, though the overt mineral character in the flavor and mouthfeel takes away from the finer qualities of this beer."
"Overall it's a good beer, nice for the holiday seasons."
"Drinkability: This is wonderfully balanced beer. Although I don't see anything particularly ""winter-y"" about it - I think it could easily be enjoyed in summer, too - I think the folks who made this put great care in it. Although billed as 6.0%abv, it's refreshingly low in alcohol when compared to many American or Belgian winter counterparts. I could probably have a pint or two of this and be in good shape at the end of it!"
"D: This is a decent beer but it does not appear to warrant the hype."
"Pours an orangish brown color with a thick frothy head which gives way to skim with decent lacing up and down the glass. The aroma is slightly weak with smells of biscuit and caramel at the front and hops of a earthy variety at the end. The taste is of biscuits and toastiness up front with caramel in the middle. The middle also starts the hop bite which finishes the beer. The mouthfeel is slightly carbonated. Overall it is a drinkable beer. There is some complexity to it but not a top of class."
"Heavy malt aromas of nuts and caramel and light smells of herbs & brown sugar. Head is off white with fair lacing and is fully diminishing. Color is a clear orange/brown. Flavor is a taste of spice, caramel, malt, a little pine, and a few hops in the back, ends a little dry and somewhat bitter, finishes lightly sweet. With all of the winter/holiday beers out there that try too hard, this one just seems natural."
"A pretty good beer overall, and certainly drinkable. The mouthfeel is pleasant, and the taste is straight-forward enough, while managing to stay interesting. The bitterness overtakes the beer a little more than I would have liked, but still enjoyable."
"This beer warms the palate and the soul. It has a fruitcake like smell a hoppy smooth taste. I looks crisp clear with an orangeish hue with a thick soapy head which disappears quickly. It is really drinkable Good beer, what you'd expect from tadcaster."
"D -- Terrific on a blustery, mid-November's evening. This beer is balanced and complex at the same time. Rich and flavorful, very satisfying."
"Medium bodied beer with a pleasant mouthfeel, this beer is also nicely drinkable."
"D - I was pleasantly surprised with this brew. Usually not a big fan of the style but I would definitely get this one again. Real pleasant and nice."
"2010-2011.(4.0 / 5.0) Dense big foamy lacy off white head. Clear bright thin pretty amber color. Delicate toasted mild hop sweet fruit hint front. Subtle sweet thin caramel biscuit light vanilla fruit hint body. Smooth tasty delicate hop refreshing mild sweet end. No Stank! Tasted 12/3/2010. Purchased for $3.50 each @ PCC--Fremont, Seattle on 12/3/2010."
"This beer was pretty hard to review, to be honest. I really like this beer, but when it came down to the scoring, I just found it really hard to do. It's an easy drinking beer that I highly recommend."
"Pours a nice copper color, moderate head. Scent is mild, sweet abd bready malts backed with faint touches of spice. taste similar to scent in that it is mild, lightly sweet, earthy hops and faint kisses of spice (clove is the most noticeable). Medium bodied, slightly high in carbonation. Nicely drinkable without the high spice profile as other winter warmers."
"D- Very good. Above your average winter ale."
"Nice head from my bomber pour, about two fingers of rich off white bubbles. Color is a 11 on the SRM chart, with a slight fogginess. Smells like caramel, oats and sweet malt. Flavors are hints of caramel, citrus, juniper berries, and roasted malt. Full body of creaminess and marshmallow feeling between my teeth and tongue. Not a beer to try and make a staple because it is seasonal, but none the less it is one to have a few times while it is available."
"This is a thoroughly average beer. It should be beloved, as this brewery should be beloved, because it's so goddamn old, and because were it not for Sam Smith's beer nowadayws would be very different than what it is. It's also worth the low price (that's neat because in my review of SS's nut brown ale, in 04, I joked about how expensive this was! Good lord, things have gotten worse since then.)"
"This beer is a bit of a let down. Granted, I am no expert on this style, I expected better from Sam Smith's. I was really disappointed in the nonexistent head of the beer and the soda like carbonation. Overall, its drinkable and decent, but not a go to for this style."
"Verdict: Excellent, well-priced British ale that might not meet the ""Holiday Ale"" criteria for many New World beer lovers...I like it, though. Worth trying."
"Based on the other offerings from Samuel Smith's I've had as well as other Winter Warmers I've had, this one is a bit of a let down. It's tamed with nothing really to grab my attention. Maybe a good intro to the style, but far from the best the style has to offer. If this is your first Sam Smith's, don't judge the brewery off of this; wait until you have their Imperial or Oatmeal Stouts ;)"
"Enjoyed this one very much, look forward to having it again."
"Overall this is a very tasty brew, not one of Samuel Smith's best, but good none-the-less. Worth a try because of its quality and reasonable price."
"All around a good beer and considering I drank a 550ml. bottle in 4 minutes without trying to rush I would say this is very drinkable."
"Winter brew wise this wouldn't be my first choice but it's a legit offering from Sam Smith that is worth a try."
"This is barleywine-lite. Give it the time it needs to warm up to let the goodness out, and you'll be rewarded with a fine, malty ale. Doesn't pour with the quality of head normally found with Sam Smith's beers, but its luminous tawny hue will kick start the warming. Richly malty and cordially fruity aroma - vaguely vinous qualities. Allowing it to settle, a smack of smooth, full malt greets, followed immediately by a quiet storm surge of phantasmal noble hops, and a round cherry fruitiness before dropping off fairly dry, though residual sweetness lingers on the sides of the tongue. At its prime temperature, the malt profile is unmistakably barleywine, and it's quite interesting to get these flavors in a mellow presentation. The alcohol, apparent but tame, hangs around start to finish. Very enjoyable all-around."
"D: The drinkability of this is pretty good."
"Straight-forward, enjoyable English ale...nothing special perhaps, but better than a lot of domestic winter warmers."
"d-I had this years ago and didn't like it that much IIRC. I really liked this beer this time around. I'm a sucker for the Winter beers. This one was really drinkable."
"D: Strong spice flavor makes this sippable. Not something id drink in a hurry"
"pretty good, enjoyable beer. nothing really jumps out, but it's well balanced, easy to drink."
"Smooth mouthfeel. Incredibly drinkable. And, yes, a great welcome to winter. Good for late fall when there is a nice chill in the air. Maybe moving to the barley wines after that."
"Overall, pretty tasty and easy-drinking... this might make a nice session brew over the upcoming cold months."
"Fairly good beer, not a home run but easy to drink and tasty. Fits the season well."
"D: not all that drinkable, not lovin the taste. probably will leave it at just this one. but THANKS for the buzzz"
"Overall, this is a nice brew for the price. Compared to some other winter warmers I've had, this one definitely takes the cake. Will be stocking up on this for the next few months. Will be a Christmas companion. Went great with cinnamon-chocolate-baked apple dish."
"D: Very drinkable and easy to down, but no real need to."
"Poured into a pint glass. Showed an amber gold with a frothy white head, great retention and lacing. Smell of sweet bready malts, caramel and vanilla. Taste of the same with the addition of dry and earthy hops balancing the finish. Great beer, exemplary of the style."
"Overall this beer is very easy drinking, yet flavorful and complex. It goes down easy and is quite wonderful, though does not posses the strength and, sometimes, spice associated with many winter seasonals."
"Dr. Very good. I don't ""session""."
"My first example of a winter warmer, and it was a little better than I expected. It's a treat to drink, and I'd recommend giving it a try."
"Pours a moderate copper color with an off white head. No real lacing but the head lasts for a bit of time. The nose brings forward quite a bit of spice, but this is mellowed out by some light cake flavors and a bit of caramel. Taste is spice, sugar cake, and light caramel. Moderate body with good carbonation. Overall, a nice balance of spice and sweetness. A pretty drinkable beer."
"D: Quite drinkable, I'll definitely finish the bottle. This will definitely be added to the drink again when it comes even closer to winter."
"Sam Smith's Winter Welcome Ale - 550ml brown bottle poured into shaker. Beautiful amber with off white head. Amazing lacing. Exceptional winter brew. This beer is so smooth yet thick tasting. Sweet caramel earthyness comes through strong. Smooth finish."
"Overall this is a good beer to sit back next to a fire on a cool fall day and sip on. Goes down real smooth with lots of taste."
"This is a typical English beer as far as flavor delivery goes. From start to finish, this is very mild and smooth without being too watery."
"I've wanted to try this for sometime now, figured a cool fall day would make a decent opportunity. Not too bad but not quite what I was expecting from a winter warmer"
"D- I really dig this beer and the low abv is a plus. Good flavor that keeps me guessing and a smooth mf makes this one I want to revisit."
"yeah you can drink it so why wouldnt you life is full of mediocracy"
"D - Overall not quite what I was expecting. A little bit lighter, fruitier and fizzier than I bargained for. Easy to drink, however, and drinkable for the ABV number. I'm confident that this one would taste way better on the other side of the pond."
"Drinkability: this is a nicely drinkable beer. I think it has enough redeeming characteristics to be drinkable beyond just what its flavor would indicate. It's a nice brew on a chilly day."
"Overall, not my cup of tea. I like several of Sam Smith's beers, just not this one. I'd try a fresher one if I could find it in singles, but I felt ripped off buying this 4 pack. I partly blame the store for not stocking fresh beer and trying to pass this one off as the recent one."
"Winter can be an ungodly season but that's only because it seems to never end; at its beginning, it is most welcome. The first chilly nights rekindle the flames of the fireplace, the cold winds push us to find salvation in warm layers, foods become richer and heavier and all the joy that is Christmas is not far away. It is, in all honesty, one of my most favourite times of the year - and this is one of my most favourite beers to celebrate it with."
"I think this drinks really well. It's easy and sessionable. The problem I have is that it doesn't represent a winter warmer to me. I'm fine with that, but it is misleading. This would make a great Oktoberfest beer as well. I would have this one again."
"D: High abv, can feel it quick, gets filling"
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink and I might try it again during the winter when the holidays roll around."
"This beer fell short for me and lacked the wow factor. Especially because I really like all the other beers brewed by Samuel Smith. Not a bad beer, but its just something I would not go out of my way to drink again. Needs more flavor for my mouth buds."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with red hues, small head. Smell is malts, a bit sweet, maybe caramel. Taste is malts and hops, well balanced, a touch of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good brew."
"Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Feels smooth. Feels substantial but isn't filling. It's a little bit moreish. Solid."
"On the evening, we tasted 5 beers...this was one of the standouts among good company."
"D: Drinkability is ok at best."
"Overall, this is a good English winter ale. I've yet to try a disappointing Samuel Smith's beer!"
"D: This beer was all over the place for me. Looks great and has great texture, but misses with the flavor and aroma. Still enjoyable to drink, just not something I would go out of my way to get."
"This beer really opens up halfway. Initially I wasn't very impressed by its aroma or flavours but that quickly changed as it warmed up more, though I had it reasonably warm to begin with. It's decent but not one of Samuel Smiths best."
"Value: Samuel Smith's is usually good in my opinion, I mean, you get what you pay for."
"The mouthful is rather refreshing and smooth with some mild courseness from the fine carbonation."
"D: A good beer. Not what I was expecting, but in a good way. A little lighter in body, but with a good depth of flavors and not loaded up with either hot alcohol or the stereotypical winter spices."
"D: A solid winter warmer. Tasty and drinkable."
"It is lighter but yet very complex. I hate to use oxymoron's when analyzing anything, but it is so true when tasting this beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint. Great clear golden color with a big foamy head the goes slowly into a thin film with no real lacing. Light aroma of toffee or caramel. Very complex yet subtle flavors sweet and a bit citrusy. Well balanced with a clean finish. Very drinkable. I enjoyed this one"
"I find this to be an odd beer, a take on the style I'm not familiar with. I don't have much experience with British brews. It's drinkable but I don't know if I'll be buying it again. There are quite a few beers similar in style to this which I prefer."
"(550 mL bottle into pint glass) 2009-2010 season. Poured a clear brown with a very slight head, that fall fast, but left beautiful lacing on the glass. Aromas of a doughy yeast as well as caramel and grassy hops were noted. This was a very interesting profile, and actually made me a little apprehensive to try this one, especially since I have heard so much positive about Samuel Smiths' offerings. Once I tasted though, all of those worries fell away. The flavor was very complex, and changed completely throughout the course of the glass. There was a very nice slightly sweet start with the light caramel forward, and a barely noticeable hop bite at the finish. As the glass continued, the hops grabbed the lead, and provided a nice bitter flavor, with the sweetness coming in at the finish to calm it. Extraordinary, and it's a shame I didn't grab a few more of these when I had the time!"
"Also like the photo of shire horses running through the snow. Tonight I'm just missing the open fire with which to contemplate the complexities of this fine drink."
"It's okay in the flavour department, looks gorgeous, but doesn't pull together in the end. Can't believe I enjoyed Wychwood's Bah Humbag to this overall."
"It is a very solid, drinkable and smooth beer."
"pours a gorgeous amber with one finger off white head with decent lacing and average dissipating. smells of mild fruit esters and a lovely hint of floral hop and grapefruit aromas with a beautiful toasty malt backround as it warms. tastes hits you with a nice, zesty tartness, with ample, crisp grapefruit hops and toasty, caramel malts with subtle chocolate, grain, and gram crackers. a very crisp beer that is very dry and enjoyable."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was tea colored and poured a great big head. The smell of the beer was sweet and tasted that way also. Also was a bit hoppy. The head went away fast though. I might have to try this one again."
"I'd say drinkability it wasn't bad. It's something that I would drink again, but wouldn't run to the store directly for it."
"I think that seriously I would probably drink this again, not as a winter beer though as a normal beer."
"Mouthfeel is fine and drinkability is just ok. This beer neither pleases or displeases."
"Drinkability: I think this has to be done with a meal. By itself it's interesting, but I think it would be better over a long meal where you have this interesting flavor combination highlight things between bites. What's weird is that when I had this earlier in the season at a beer tasting with holiday goodies I thought it was great, but I only had a small glass. Now at the end of the 550ml bottle all by myself my opinion has changed."
"Pretty carbonated mouthfeel and somewhat smooth. But not very drinkable, I would never try this again, not very good compared to their other offerings."
"Solid drinkability, a nice beer but much unlike many of the darker, roasted winter warmers produced in the states."
"d - less malt and spice profile than a typical winter ale, so it's easy drinking, maybe a little lacking in character and not terribly exciting but won't disappoint."
"This past weekend we repeated the vertical, but now dropping out the 06 and bringing the 09 to the fold. In general, I'd say my comments hold, though I did notice a more pronounced hoppiness in the most recent beer which didn't seem to be presence in past brews even when fresh. I think the Sam Smith's is a decent take on the style, but its not the sort of beer I'd usually go for, and I think the quality is not what it once was."
"Other comments: A decent beer but a bit mundane."
"Mouthfeel is light in body with a slight mineral bitterness I associate with English pales. Terribly easy to drink, and I would have enjoyed drinking it when the weather is warmer rather than on one of the cooler days of the year."
"Not really my thing, pretty uninspiring. Pretty sure 2 years is this one's max, I wouldn't let it sit in the cellar any longer than that."
"a very easy drinking ale. lots of flavor that compliment the cold winter months."
"Overall nowhere near my expectations. A nice beer but I think I will pass on it next christmas."
"Not a bad little brew, but it didn't really wow me. Highly drinkable, though; the light entry and the tart finish were quite refreshing, but not exactly what I was looking for."
"D - True to form, Sam Smith Winter Warmer has high drinkability. Abv is on the lower side and hidden completely. Flavors are all pleasant and no off flavors present."
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. I enjoyed it. A little differen than most winter warmers I have had but I still liked it."
"cheers!"
"Atmosphere is really nice. Better than average appearance, and a pleasing but pretty basic nose. Flavor is also not so complex, but full and robust. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"An adequately comforting winter ale, reminiscent of holiday seasons past, spice and malt-wise, if not altogether warming. Still worthy as an New Year's offering, as I root for the Canucks versus the dreaded Yanks in their Junior hockey showdown."
"D: Drinks reasonably well, though the finish is fairly bitter."
"D- not my favorite style, but this is something that i wouldnt mind sampling one or two times a year. not in quantities greater than one in a session though."
"D - This is a really drinkable beer, as it doesn't really bite you like some Winter Seasonals do. I would like it to have the extra umph that we see in others, but this is their way, so be it. Overall a nice beer, but there are better Winters out there."
"I left the bottle out of the refrigerator after pouring the first glass, making the second glass much warmer, which vastly improved the experience. By-and-large, Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome Ale is a non-descript malty ale, the likes of which can be found any time of the year; however it was a sweet tasty pleasure as it warmed."
"D: 6% ABV, nice taste, nice drinking beer. Decent quaffer."
"D – Very drinkable, and likely to be appreciated by anyone who drinks beer."
"D: Good beer and winter warmer. It's a little more hoppy than other WW's I've had but that not a bad thing. Easy to drink and great flavours."
"I generally like the other Sam Smith options better - the Pale Ale is my favorite right now - but this is a well crafted beer that's worth a once a year pop."
"Whipped up, dimpled head of a little over one finger, darker cream white, above average lacing, head retention is so-so, settles into a thin webbing across the surface. Burnt orange, metallic rust colored liquid, transparent with plenty of miniscule bubbles visible within. Rum raisin cake and white grapes blossom first in the nose, honey, scone flakes, at times akin to corn syrup, moderate fig, peach, gingered orange peels, overall stays clean and has some lift while keeping a full nostril presence. Full-bodied, thicker here in terms of sheer mouth weight and slower paced, leads with a peppery kick, teases out more ginger and cumin spice accents. There's a leanness to the flavors if at the same time a persistence start to finish. The rumcake, honey, ginger and orange peels duplicate the nose, lower level of fig, date, peach fruit and lacking in sweetness. Conversely, there's moments of sweet vinegar to it. Given the mouth weight and lack of flavor intensity, the carbonation too active to help it soak into the palate. Hard caramel candy comes through at the end. It's alright for what it is."
"Easy drinker but not much here vs all the now available winter warmers."
"Overall, a pleasant, nicely balanced winter warmer-Nothing fancy, just nicely subtle in the English style, and quite drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable, strikes a nice balance in terms of flavor. Will be a crowd pleaser and will also (to a degree) satisfy those who love big beer flavor."
"drinkability: Was a decent beer but will not be a regualr on winter holidays, decent."
"D: Not Sam Smith's best offering -- very dry with decent spice note but undermalted."
"I guess I just expect something different/special/unique from a winter warmer as well as something better from this brewery."
"D - This is a great winter beer with all the expected British ale flavors and a malty essence that helps to make it appropriate for the season. I really enjoyed this as a break from the all too commonly over spiced winter beers that some other breweries produce. This managed to be warming and malty without huge, cloying doses of spices and most importantly, I could easily see myself drinking this at any time of year."
"I love Sam Smith but this is my least favorite beer by them that Ive had."
"2009-2010 edition, 12 oz bottle to glass. Color of iced tea. Fairly good head. Smell was very inviting, very malty. Taste was pretty average though, very middle of the road flavors, basic malt/cereal like flavors, dry finish. Fairly well carbonated. This is the 2nd Sam Smith I've had (the other being oatmeal stout) and they sound awesome but sort of ordinary in the bottle for me."
"Overall, this is an all right brew. I have never been impressed with Samuel Smith and this is probably the 7th or 8th brew of theirs I've had. I'm not sure how great of a winter warmer it is, but it is a nice, light beer with a high drinkability. I probably will not reach for this again, though."
"a great drinking beer that doesn't have so much to offer at a palate but is quite consistent. yellow/orange with a white head. not particularly murky. peppery and licorice dry but quite mild and simply hoppy lemon zest that doesn't have enough malt to accentuate the herbal side."
"D: easy to drink, would be great for after xmas dinner"
"D: A great choice for a holiday warmer, warms up wonderfully in the glass"
"D: This is a pleasant, tidy winter warmer from across the pond. Still, I can't help but be a little disappointed. There doesn't seem to be anything ""special"" going on here. Still, an easy drinker and a worthy import."
"Three bucks a 550 ml bottle is hard to beat, so even though this SSWW isn't my go to winter beer, it's definitely something I pick up every year for the occasional veg-out winter weeknight."
"Disappointed with the mouthfeel, otherwise a pleasant enough drink. A long, long way from my favourite Winter Warmers though."
"On a side note...I had this beer on the last day of November and went to bed, woke up December 1st and there was snow everywhere, first snow of the season! I don't know how Samuel Smith's did that..."
"Drinkability: Compared to the style this blows in my opinion. But, for a flavorful brew that has a bit more complexity that some fuller bodied beers its good. I wouldnt go out of my way to find this, but its a great alternative to some of the english beers like Bass."
"Notes: Compared to the other winter warmer I've had, this seems kind of run-of-the-mill. it lacks the holiday spice flavors I like in a winter warmer. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I would recommend this beer, and most any Samuel Smith beer for that matter, for its balanced flavors and smooth mouthfeel. I'm not sure I understand why people get so excited for the annual release of this beer, but it's still clearly a well-crafted brew."
"Overall, this seems like a good English-style warmer. It's not breaking the bank, and I feel at moments like I am drinking a London Pride with a lot more spiciness to it, but as L.P. is a damn good beer, I don't see why I can't enjoy this."
"Poured a deep amber into an American pint glass, with a very thin white head, and almost no lacing or carbo presence. Not much aroma at all; only some subtle pear , caramel, and spices. The flavor revealed a little more intensity, but that's not saying much. The taste was dominated by caramel and brown sugar, with a very feint hint of spices. Decently smooth and medium-bodied, but way too mellow of a flavor for me."
"D - A solid offering from Samuel Smith with a nice balance, although its just a bit light in body and flavor to push it to an A rating for a Winter Warmer. Not a bad beer at all in the end though."
"The body was smooth and even, but not particularly thick. Drinkability is very good, it would be very pleasant to have a couple of these on a winters eve. Or a summer afternoon. Not what we currently think of as a winter beer, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"D. Definitly could throw a few of these back. A good find for the winter."
"Drinkability: This Old Ale/Winter Warmer seems like a bigger, slightly sour, version of a bitter. Very nice drinkability despite the metallic aftertaste. A classic."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a nice carbonation to compliment it. Pretty good on drinkability too, as it tastes good. Could have a couple with ease"
"Amber color with a large off white head. Has decent retention. A nice combination of malt, hops, spices, and toffee in the aroma and the taste. Mild flavors, very mild, smooth, and easy to drink. Nicely carbonated, medium bodied. A good beer, but not great."
"Typically good finish from Samuel Smith's and I'm always enamored by the beautiful craft in color and complexity of the body and head. However, the smell and taste are a bit on the bland end. Some toffee and cherry malt flavors with some herbal, spruce notes. A very subtle beer, with some very light spices for a winter warmer. Little carbonation and a little tart in the mouth. Finishes well, though with some earthiness and roundness on the back end. Carries that distinct ""English feel"" on the finish and round balance notes of smoked portobello."
"Notes: Like I said before, there is definitely nothing wrong with this beer. It is a good example of a classic english style winter warmer (the original version). However, that said, it was also not very impressive in any area, just a solid above average beer. I will say that it is very easy to drink though."
"Drinkability: I thought this was a very drinkable beer in that one could sit and have several of these in an evening with friends and good conversation. It is well made, well balanced and pleasant to drink. I'll definitely be having this one again in the future."
"Overall this beer was a nice winter seasonal and a pleasant departure from many highly spiced winter beers. Recommended."
"2007-2008 Winter Welcome. Pours a light amber, the color of whiskey with a large two finger in size head. Samuel Smith's naturally conditioned ales always manage to look attractive and this is not exception with good retention, eyecatching tiny bubbles, fair lacing, and visible effervescence. Smells of hazelnut, raisin, brown sugar, and cinnamon tickle the nose. Interestingly, this comes off as a brown ale, but not as rich as Sam Smith's own nut brown. Primary tasting notes consist of burnt caramel nuts and hazelnuts. Spicy finish almost confuses itself with a solvent alcohol bite. Winelike grape and plum notes. Feel is creamy, but feels excessively light in body due to the active level of carbonation. Tasty, but not Tadcaster's best or the best winter warmer option."
"D-its not a bad beer and also its nothing special, it reminds me of SA winter lager, but slightly better"
"overall an above average winter warmer."
"Cheers!"
"Pours an orangy coppery color, with thin head, minimal lacing. Smells initially of spice with a citrus kick. Then a bit malty. Tastes very good on the start, hints of the same spice and citrus, with a full malt backing. Has a bit of a strange finish that i cant place. Not a very full beer, leans towards the thin side. fairly drinkable. Overall pretty tasty, not quite as good as other SS beers I have had, but still a good brew."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp orange with a decent off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet malts with mild spice. The taste is a nice balance of sweet malts, spice and a decent Earthy hop backbone. The beer is medium boded with decent carbonation. An enjoyable, textbook Winter Warmer, but nothing all that special."
"On sight, this looks to be a great beer. Color of very deep amber, and an inch and half white head that hangs around for a bit, followed by very nice lacing around the glass. Aromas of warmth & spices; slight sweet fruity-can't quite put my finger on it. Tastes of hops at very first, earthy texture; followed by sweet malt character and winter spices. Cheers!"
"No big hop character. Good sweetness, I dunno, maybe provided by the yeast. Introductory ale. There's a mild undercurrent of toffee to it. The alcohol is warming. This was a beer I got into in the mid 90s, but really haven't went back to it in a long time. I stick with the oatmeal, the imperial and the chocolate stout pretty much from SS, or every couple of years, and ipa or pale ale for nostalgia sake, like this one."
"D: It's good, but I would take various other ww."
"Carbonation is smooth lending a nice mouthfeel. I really like this one. Not sure what makes it a winter warmer. If I had to place it I'd say it's a strong bitter. Perfect for year 'round drinking and very sessionable. Only real drawback is that it's a little on the high end price-wise, as are all Sam Smith's."
"Samuel Smith's can do better."
"Notes: I am not very impressed with this offering. My friends have raved about Sam Smiths, but this was not the greatest."
"D-This was disappointing from such a good brewery and not on par with their other offerings."
"I gave this beer fairly low marks in all catagories, not because it's a bad beer, but because it just doesn't measure up to the style. To my way of thinking, a Winter Ale should be dark, rich, inviting, complexed, and warming. The only thing warming about this ale is the ABV. It's basically a standard English Ale with a bit more dry hopping, carbonation, and possibly some spice added."
"Pours a clear orange amber with a small head that fades quickly. No lacing. Nose is sweet and fruity with maybe a touch of citrus. Taste is much of the same with also a bit of tartness. Mouthfeel is fairly thin with mild carbonation. Drinkable and enjoyable but nothing special."
"I would describe this beer as hoppy upfront with a attempt at balance by malt. Nothing overly exciting, and considering I wasn't looking for an IPA I would have enjoyed a stronger malt supporting role, or a smaller hop role."
"Overall: Not impressed. Any ok ale, but probably the worst I've had from samuel smith, which is saying kind of a lot because they make quite a few beers."
"Poured from my 18.7 oz bottle into a pint glass. Very very fruity and floral on the nose, reminiscent of a hefe almost. Disappointing color. I guess not what I was expecting from a holiday beer. Lighter than expected, and more along the lines of a spicier straight English bitter. Typical of Samuel Smith; never an A; never an F."
"Very drinkable, solid winter brew. One of my favorites. Everything this brewery turns out is gold."
"Drinkability: We used to save up to buy Sam Smiths beer when we were in college. Its still pretty good, but not as good as I used to think it was-- probably because of what I can get now. Its been more than 10 yrs since I last had one of these. Its good, but not great. I probably wont buy it again."
"D - Definitely drinkable, but not a favorite ale or warmer."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. It pours a yellow/amber color with a crazy big frothy head that will stick around for about 5 minutes or so then it will just turn into a ring around the top layer of the liquid. I would have rated the look a little higher if the head stuck around a little longer and if the beer produced lacing, but it had very little. The smell was pretty good. The smell is good, caramelized malts dominate the smell, the slightest bit of dehydrated fruit with hints of toffee. The taste is a step up in my opinion. Same concept as the taste but here's where you can taste some winter spices, maybe a bit of nutmeg and also a buttery taste as well, but both of these flavors are pretty subtle. The mouthfeel is pretty good, very smooth, kind of a creamy feel and it's very drinkable. I could really see this as a year round beer, I don't see a whole lot that could classify this as a winter warmer with the exception of the slightest hint f nutmeg, it doesn't taste that far off from a year round ale. Still a pretty good beer in my opinion."
"D: Very drinkable, it's nice that the alcohol content is to high also. Could sit back and enjoy quite a few of these."
"I love the color of this beer... decent head that recedes to a small foam. Some lacing. Smell is good, some apple and bready malt. Taste is a bit herbal, actually, followed by some nice hints of nutmeg, banana, bread, and red apple. Pretty good, but too subtle to be my favorite. Very smooth and creamy, dry finish. Medium body. Warms me up, I can drink this for a while."
"Overall this is a wonderful winter beer! I was very impressed with this one, and I'm looking forward to trying some more Samuel Smith brews. Good stuff!"
"""winter warmer"" moniker. It's pretty light in feel and ABV to warm me up once the mercury heads south."
"Pours a copper color with a white froth. The nose shows a yeasty/biscuit, vanilla, orange citrus, honey, banana, & melon. Sweet and easy to drink, however, not really one that I really enjoyed. Umm...I haven't exceeded my 250 character mark, so that's why there is an extra sentence here."
"Drinkability - Very nice drinker. Does not cause any ill after effects."
"One of the great winter beers. Never disappoints."
"Overall not a bad beer, I am not big on most winter ales, the trend seems to continue with this beer."
"D - Overall this is a very drinkable beer, however it strikes me as light for a winter warmer, with little of the dark fruit/strong malt flavor one expects."
"From notes. Very clear, amber, foamy white head with retention and lacing. SMELL is faint. Grainy with faint hops and a bit of malty sweetness found with a swirl. TASTE is grainy, fruity, spicy, malty. Balanced well overall with some perceptible hop backing and light bitterness. FEEL moderate carbonation, medium body, viscous, fairly clean finish. OVERALL easy drinker, not really big like many other winter beers. Very good, but not amazing."
"Poured a clear, deep amber with a two finger head that dissipated to a skin. The aroma was cotton candy sweet. The taste was malty sweet, but there was a sour note in the aftertaste that didn't quite fit. The feel was medium bodied with light carbonation. Drinkability was very good. I could see downing 550 ml, while sitting in front of the fireplace, on frosty January evening."
"4 much better than i expected, after not liking the brown ale."
"Had in a 12oz bottle poured into a Tulip glass. Nice reddish color with a small head that dissipated very quickly. Earthy aroma and a malty finish. Very little hops and a nice warming level of alcohol. Overall it was a decent session ale (although slightly strong) and was super cheap ($.85/bottle) so I can't complain too much."
"A half-liter bottle poured into a nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a clear ruby brown color with two fingers of creamy ecru foam. Aroma and flavor are nice and malty with notes of fruits, a touch of nuttiness, caramel, and toasted bread. Medium bodied and amply carbonated. Classic and consistent."
"Winter Welcome's an okay beer that's a little disappointing. I had hoped it'd be better than it is. Its biggest problem is that there's absolutely nothing that stands out about it. It's just kind of there. It's alright and isn't a bad beer by any means, but there's a hell of a lot better winter seasonal releases out there. It's not worth spending too much time with this. A little more of something would help. Spices or hops would be a great place to start. That would add some much needed pizzazz. As it is, it's worth a try, but I wouldn't suggest picking it up on an annual basis."
"The taste is wonderfully malty in body, taste , sweetness but with nice hoppiness to balance. It tastes of toasted bread, caramel, plums, and hints of dried fruit and sour fruit, with a light raisiny alcholic warmth. It has balancing bitternes that is mostly leafy but with some citrus pulp, as well. It's not as rich as some winter warmers, but it's still an excellent, flavourful, and very balanced beer, exceedingly drinkable."
"Overall a very good beer. More please."
"D - a perfect match with seasonal foods."
"This one tasted a little thin. I was hoping for a little more sweetness. Overall not bad, but I think I'd grab something else off the shelf next time."
"500 mL bottle poured into a pint glass. Orange-amber color with a frothy light tan head. Aroma is sweet and doughy with toffee and nuts. Flavor is bready and sugary with a mild metallic note and a lightly grassy/earthy hop finish. Medium body with substantial carbonation. Too sweet to be particularly drinkable."
"D: I wasn't really impressed with this beer, although I wasn't disappointed either. This beer just seemed blah to me, very mediocre. I don't think it is a very good representation of the brewery."
"From a 550 ml. bottle marked SI09H1. Sampled on March 26, 2009. It pours an attractive amber-orange with an adequate head and good clarity. The aroma has a bit of hops in it and something slightly malty. The mouthfeel is pretty decent. The taste is more bitter and tart than anything else. I wasn't overwhelmed by it but t wasn't too bad."
"I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of Brown Ales, I think it's a pretty similar beer to the better examples of that style."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and refreshing for a winter warmer. Moderate ABV and medium body makes it a good session beer."
"Drinkability: The low ABV makes thi sbeer more drinkable, but the finish and flavor don't make this a very attractive beer."
"The tangy aftertaste is not smooth enough or fruity enough to be a session beer for me."
"Great great beer. Maybe the best winter ale I have had this year (2008-2009). I really enjoyed it."
"D - Very drinkable and not too boozy at all! Probably wouldn't want to do more than two of these in a night, for the alcohol has a tendency to get to you late in the glass :)"
"D - a very drinkable winter warmer because of its low ABV. extremely enjoyable and another great beer from samuel smith."
"M&D: a tasty fruity premium bitter in need of a stronger bitter profile, but already delicious enough to make a quaffable choice especially for the winter season. The carbonation is well under control, refreshing but not fizzy, soft yet never static, and the flavour is well-balanced with the aid of both sourness and the bitter edge of hops. Truly likeable."
"D- This beer is more drinkable than it could be because of the low ABV. Finish doesn't exactly leave you craving another sip right away however."
"D - Yes...very much so. I didin't really care for the Sam Smith Imperial Stout but this beer is very good. I will for sure seek this out next winter."
"pours a copper/tea color with a less than one finger off white head with a fair amount of lace with each sip. candy, toffee, tea nose. sweet rock candy and toffee with hint of honey followed by tea tart finish. light mouthfeel with a tight carbonation that held up very well. tasty winter warmer."
"Mediocre looking appearance when poured. Had a lot of fizzy carbonation, but reduced to almost nothing. The color is a clear dark gold with no haze or sediment. This is not the winter warmer that I am familiar with. Lacks body, ABV, and taste. The aroma has a strong copper/iron metallic smell. Has a macro-brew-mass-produced typical taste to it. The finish is very bitter and dry. The mouthfeel is very watery and over carbonated. The taste and finish also have a chemical metallic iron/copper type note. Not very impressive. Has the look and taste of cheap ingredients. Maybe I'm wrong?"
"Pours a golden-brown color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of grass, sweet malt, hops, and some spice aromas. Fits the style of a Winter Warmer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with high carbonation levels present. Noticeable dryness present. Spices and hops up front with a tart malt background, along with some sweet malt finish. Strange flavors; really dry with low hops and spices, but high tart malts."
"D - Nothing mind-blowing, but a descent brew that I can enjoy a few of. Does not overpower and finishes clean. Someone get me another one."
"Overall: The mouth feel is a tad dry with a medium body and an astringent mouth feel. There is a hoppy bitter finish to the beer. When I first looked at this beer I, thought it was going to be a very thin and watery brew. I was surprised to see that is a good medium body brew with complex malts. It is a refreshing winter welcome. It wasn't as heavy as some winter warmer I have tried though."
"Drinkabaility= High! Abv. not noticable. A genuine quaffer. Great beer. Would drink this year round if they brewed it."
"Overall the drinkability was average, and the beer itself was average for its category I expected more."
"Overall a good release from the Sam Smith brewery."
"Big malty flavor. There's a brief sharp hop spice. Super dry finish. Very smooth and crisp."
"Medium bodied with soft fluffy carbonation."
"MF&D - nothing I'm too terribly hard pressed to write about. not a very thick beer, not is the carbonation terribly overwhelming. Howerver! this does not mean I particularly want to have 3 or 4 of them, they sit quite heavy enough in my belly, and do the job well of putting on a good buzz. this would not limit them, however, if the feel of the beer was a bit more substantial and the experience in the tastes was a bit more engrossing."
"Pours a clean orange-ish yellow color with a light head. In the aroma, sweet malt, with hints of gingerbread. In the taste, sweet maltiness, hints of gingerbread and a nice cinnamon presence in the end. A spicey and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry cinnamon aftertaste. Standard English style warmer, nice cinnamon, ok, but light."
"Overall, a very nice session-like beer. First thing that comes to my mind is ""ole' reliable."" Just one of those beers you can always count on to give you a good experience."
"Review is for the 2008-2009 version. A decent seasonal beer from Samuel Smith's, not one I will seek out again this year, but I'll try it next year to see how it compares. Wish there was a little more complexity to this one."
"Not sure if I'd want more than one. Its good but I think the monotony of this brew would get me after one."
"Poured a nice orangish color with a soft white head. Not a lot of spicyness in the nose as I expected and a slight malt aroma was detected. The carbonation was good and mouthfeel was great. Lots of Englishmalts. Just enough body but not overwhelming. This beer was not as spicy and complex as I expected from a ""winter"" beer."
"This is really watery. Goes down really easily. This seriously tastes and feels like a slightly alcoholic apple juice. I'm tasting apples, apricots, little citrus, and absolutely no hops. No bite or crispness to this at all. Not the best winter warmer out there by far."
"i would guess this is the current release and if it is, it already seems past its best. disappointing."
"D: a very nice winter beer, a good slow sipper and enjoyable to the end. The warmth and transition of flavors throughout the experience also make it interesting. I look for this one every year."
"Not a traditional winter warmer a little thin on the feel but still a nice beer and easy drinking."
"Aroma is malty with an undertone of spice - mainly cloves - and a hint of yeast. It pours a light coppery golden-red with a thick off-white head. Lively, malty flavor has a strong undertone of spice and hints of yeast, caramel and honey. Texture is crisp and syrupy smooth."
"D= This is a very drinkable and sessionable beer. I simply found it a bit boring and a little too thin in the mouth."
"immediately notable alcohol presence, this brew seems thin and weak with a dry whimpy bitter hop. The cheaper dry quality mellows out a bit as you go and it becomes more of an OK pale ale. Not bad as a basic brew, but disappointing as a winter brew. Not up to expectations from old Sam."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a light amber/gold color with a billowing, three finger head of beige foam. The retention was quite good as it soon formed a tight cap and the lacing pretty good too. The aroma was a mix of grains, toasted malt, biscuity-malt with an underlying mustiness. The flavors were sweeter than the aroma suggested, caramel malt coming up front along with the biscuity malt, a slight alcohol heat before it became bitter and herbal for the hoppy finish. The body was medium, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation good. Not bad, but nowhere near as good as some of this brewery's other offerings."
"The taste is a bit metallic, but there is a hoppy presence on the backend, and a sprightly maltiness and an earthy and bready quality to the beer. The beer is a bit sharp, although reasonably well balanced. There is a slight floral note or two in the beer that does interact with the metallic tinge as well but the two together make the beer seem a little flatter than is probably warranted. This beer is good, but not brilliant. The ABV is well hidden and overall not a strong winter warmer, but neither is it nourishing or warming. There is a definite tartness in the mouth, and the beer is fairly modest carbonation. Not a bad winter warmers but there are lots of them that are better."
"This one suits the season perfectly indeed, but isn't as warming or alcohol-fuelled as I expected it to be."
"A staple amongst all winter seasonal ales. Aromas of caramel malts, fruit, and citrusy hops permeate through the nose. The almost creamy texture gives this ale a slight warming sensation. This winter seasonal has a nice hazelnut malt base, balanced out by floral hops and holiday spices, resulting in a clean crisp finish."
"2007/2008 .Pours a clear copper with an off-white head that slowly dissipates; very slight lacing.Aroma of sweet malts, caramel, molasses, and green apples.Flavor of caramel,brown sugar spice and some sourish fruit,apple maybe,a hint of hops.Lightly carbonated.Drinkable but nothing special."
"This beer offers a better feel and drink for me than the Old Brewery Pale Ale, though they seem to be brothers in arms in many ways. A bit higher in alcohol, this brew offers a drier balance with some spice and a bit more carbonation. Fans of the more viscous English Pales will surely disagree, however I would find this more refreshing be it Winter or Summer."
"Bottle from the local Nugget Market. Pours a deep amber with a nice white head. Head falls off rather quickly. Malty, slightly tart odor, hints of allspice, cherry, though only very slight hints. Flavor is richly malty, with a bit of buttery tang. Malt mixes with a bit of alcohol towards the end and a mild hop bitterness. Not aggressive in any way, but well crafted and clean. Medium bodied. Drinks well, nice post-holiday beer for me."
"I sampled the 2008-2009 version of this brew, from a 550 ml bottle poured into a goblet. It poured a nice amber color, with a decent sized white frothy head. The beer had an aroma of malts and floral components, with a little bit of nutmeg. The taste was rather malty, with floral tones and spice."
"D - Pretty high. Not a meal in a bottle like a lot of WW's."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice golden amber with a touch of orange. Head was 2 finger white foam that left a ring lasting the whole glass. Smell was slightly sweet, a touch of honey with a bit of white bread smell. Taste was sweet at times, slightly bitter at others, with a very small touch of hops. Felt ok in the mouch, coated nicely, but a bit over carbonated in the mouth. Easy to drink, but the carbonation made me wait between sips."
"Very drinkable. Would recommend buying and saving some for your Spring fishing trip."
"Cheers!!!!"
"Not a bad beer, just not for me."
"Medium body, fair carbonation throughout the pint. Not my favorite of the Sam Smith beers, and my first winter one. Would like to see how they vary year to year. Worth trying, and a very good cold snowy winter day sipper."
"D-Overall I'd say this is a good pretty solid drinkable effort, but not one I'd rush out to buy again. Good, but unremarkable on the whole."
"7/4/7/3/15 (3.6/5)"
"i would give this average drinkability."
"Drinkability - Drinks a little heavier than it looks, but goes down super easy."
"Once again, Samuel Smith's has crafted another delicious beer that is very typical of the style it aims for. The Winter Warmer style is one that I personally find very hard to find a ""typical"" brew in, but this is it."
"Sam Smith Winter welcome Ale pours a crystal clear medium amber with a subtle creamy head and a nose akin to a Pilsner. Actually the nose reminds me of Pilsner Urquell; moderately bitter, much more than the nose suggests. Having an able sufficiency of hops as revealed by the bitter taste but definitely not a very aromatic variety as the hops are quite flat on the nose. Nicely malty and without any of the typical winter spices, this brew bridges the gap between a good bitter ale and a winter seasonal brew."
"Not big bodies, but significant anyway. Smooth feel, low carbonation. Easy drinker all in all."
"D: A hearty and spicy and a nice winter brew. above Average flavor and overall drinkability."
"I've tried a couple of this Winter's Ales already and I would recommend this one to my friends."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, but the beer seems very drinkable."
"(rated Mar 17, 2008)"
"I like this beer. It's not at all what I was expecting. Most winter warmers are bigger and spicier with more of a noticeable punch. But the winter welcome is relaxed in its delivery. It invites you in and then subtly impresses with its array of flavors and layers. More complex in the end than you might think at first. Give this one some time to grow on you as you imbibe, and your final ratings just might end up different than your first impression."
"This is a quality winter warmer, and though it has been over a year since I last had anything from Samuel Smith, I was pleased with this choice."
"MF&D - Thin/Medium bodied with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Not as warming as one might expect, but all in all an excellent ale. I could drink these all winter."
"At its freshest, the prototypical Winter Warmer is rather timid and reserved, at least in comparison with its later counterparts, particularly those of American origin. With a year's worth of mellowing-out, it picks up trace attributes of a barleywine, despite its relative low alcohol content, with a bit of added complexity. Not as ""warming"" or complex as many others, but still a delightful drink for the chilly winter months."
"Overall, average brew. I tend to prefer the American version due to the much fuller and more complex taste, but I can understand the draw here."
"Pours a clear light amber with a thin off white head with thin lacing that settles quickly. Sweet toffee and caramel mix with a grainy cereal aroma with some earthy hops. Caramel up front blend nicely with a tea/lemon like hop character. Medium carbonation and body with a syrup like mouthfeel. Solid drinkability, overall a good beer but nothing special."
"Drinks well with slight carbonation bite and a slight thickness. Hoppy finish after-bite is stronger than the initial malt flavor. Good balance, but the bitter is a bit sharp without too smooth of a transition. Very smooth with good drinkability, but a bit lacking on the palate."
"Neat-o, I get to drink a beer out of a clear glass bottle. All good beers do well in the light. Christ. Clear orange with a solid white head. Musty aroma of caramel malt and floral hops. More toffee, caramel, and a fuggel-like bitterness. Then there is the strange, salty, veggie finish... seaweed. Come on guys, this is just bad."
"Sweet roasted nut taste with that classic English hop bitterness on the back end. Oily mouthfeel and smooth. Not Sam Smith's best work, but an enjoyable, drinkable winter ale nonetheless."
"Pefectly clear copper color with a fine collar of foam around the glass, minimal lacing. Smells of roasted malts and cinnamon with a whiff of herbal hops. Taste is very mild for the WW style but that's not a bad thing, mineraly and slightly irony, nice toasty malts with a mild hop bite. Medium bodied and easy to drink."
"D- Very drinkable beer as it's not overly hoppy. You should be able to down several in a sitting. This beer is pretty average compared to other Winter Warmer's."
"Overall: I was not too impressed. I am a fan of bitter beers with strong hop flavor, but the bitterness of these hops just dominate and overpower all the delicate flavors that could be noted from this brew."
"I found this beer as part of an Old Chicago winter beer festival. The wait-staff tried to bring me a Sam Adams at first. Once I got the correct beer, I found it to be a pleasing amber color, although I tend to like my beers darker. The aroma was pleasing and not over powering. The taste was subtle, but not too subtle. Spice-like but not too much so. The mouthfeel was thin but appropriate. Overall, a very pleasing beer. I had it with a spicy pasta dish which may have been too strong for it. I would recommend it with food that is more subtle."
"2008 edition. Clear light copper with gold highlights & an off-white dense head and nice, nice lacing. Smell is hops, notes of peppermint, and earthy undertones. Taste is very balanced, very mild but with lots of detail. It has nice malt, muted grains, floral hops, and a whole lotta 'I like it'. Mouthfeel? It tastes like a silk couch in my mouth. Very, very drinkable. The balance makes it one that I could drink until I ho ho ho."
"2008-2009 version. Pours a clear orange with fast fading head, sticky lacing for the first couple of inches. Smell: very mellow, sweet malts, unfiltered apple juice, very slight toffee. Taste: pale malts, spicy hops, brown sugar+caramel sweetness, green apple, slight buttery notes. Seems like the typical mouthfeel for this brewery. Hmm, tastes like one of their pale ales with ever so slightly more focus on malt sweetness."
"I'd say this was one of the more unique winter warmers I've ever had. I was hoping for a bit better of a flavor experience, as I really didn't think it'd move to porter-like characteristics - and was hoping it was more like the nose, a caramelly Belgian strong. Regardless, worth a try, and one I wouldn't hesitate to pick up if it's in front of me. Like all Sam Smith's this thing packs such a ton of flavor into a low ABV - which just can't be ignored. Such a great brewery."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Butterscotch and fruitcake, toasted nuts, honey; definite winter warmer flavors on display here. Medium bodied, bordering on light. Not an overwhelming beer by any means, favoring more subtle nuance than most American attempts at the style. Little hop flavor, but a firm bitterness appears in the dry finish. Solid stuff, I'd gladly drink it again."
"love it - built beautifully - well balanced"
"D - Wonderful Winter Warmer... Highly enjoyable and still quite sessionable given its 6% ABV... Well balanced... Well crafted... Well executed... Good complexity... A great way to kick-off the winter season..."
"2008-2009 offering. Very nice tan bubbles cling to the glass, with a brown, but clear hue. Aromas of brown sugar with a hint of spice in the background. Taste was mellow and did have a slight bitterness in the palate after the first few sips- making it more assertive then I remember. Very drinkable, it was gone before I knew. Fresh and enjoyable."
"Pours a very light amber color, with excellent head and lacing, though, with some wonderful carbonation. Decent scent, very malty, slight hop tinge at the end, although very little as far as spices go for a winter warmer. Good taste, nothing great, I was disappointed with the lack of any real spices or winter flavorings, especially since I really enjoy most of Samuel Smith's beers. It did go down very easily, though, a very smooth brew."
"A good beer, a good winter warmer, makes me warm."
"D- I'd say it's one of the more ""drinkable"" for the style, considering I could see drinking a couple of these throughout the day. That said, it lacks a ""wow"" factor that would bring me back. I'm glad I tried it, but it's difficult for this beer to stand up to some of its more robust counterparts in the style."
"Taste: The taste doesn't seem to have held up that well. It's not bad, but it seems kinda skunked. Maybe, though, this is supposed to be how it tastes fresh. Still enjoyable. It's kinda like a German style marzen except a little heavier."
"D- a decent brew but the malts are tad too much and take away from the flavor. not bad but not a six pack purchase. A nice beer to have with dinner at a seafood restaurant."
"Pretty wimpy for a winter warmer. Maybe winter in Florida."
"Very good! I highly recomend this English beer to anyone, especially my hophead friends."
"D - A great Christmas beer"
"Poured into Samuel Smith pint glass, has a clear amber-orange color, with about 2"" off white head. Lots of active carbonation. Settles to about an 1/8"" foamy cap, later just a ring around the edge. No real lacing to speak of. For a long time I could really only smell apple. After letting it warm up a little I got a little sweet malt, tiny bit of earthy hops. Overall aroma seems pretty low key. Tastes of sweet malt, dried fruit. Nice firm malt backbone. Earthy hops show up on the finish. Leaves a little resinous hop aftertaste. Medium to light bodied, medium carbonation. Drinkability is very high, very well balanced."
"I will reach for this one again"
"Pours a clear golden orange color with a slight off white head, about a finger thick.. thins and doesn't lace. Smells of hops and sweet malts. Tastes similar, a smooth hop flavor up front with a sweet smooth malt finish. Mouthfeel is nice, no hop bite but a crisp drink."
"D - Too bad this ESB is a seasonal. Like all the other Samuel Smith's products, this is an excellent example of the style that it's patterned after. Very tasty, very drinkable."
"Overall, a solid beer."
"Pours a nice butterscotch color with a three finger head and lacing. It has a nice sweet aroma. The taste is that of hops that moves to a nice sweetness on the finish. I got a hint of banana. A very smooth beer with the right balance of carbonation. I was expecting a wider range of flavors from my first winter beer. Even though it failed in that regard, it exceeded my expectations as a great ale."
"Old Sam Smith's winter welcome, this used to be a seasonal favorite of mine about 8-9 years ago and in the last couple years I have completely stopped drinking English ales altogether. This is a nice perfectly clear orange color. The smell is bread and the slightest hint of vinegar. The flavor is more malt and again a note of vinegar. While this is not offensive it is still not something I seek out, just average. I wonder why I liked it so much back in the day?"
"D: At 6%, this is pretty darned drinkable. Definitely worth it, especially at 4$ for 550ml"
"For me this was not good. The color was nice and amber and the head was about 2 inches but only stuck around a short while. The smell was kinda fruity with a strong alcohol odor. Reminded me of a wine. Taste was sharp and carbonated and bitter from start to finish. Even though it was only 6% ABV it still had a strong alcohol taste. Mouthfeel was light and watery. For me the drinkability was not there. This is just not a beer for my taste. I won't be revisiting this one anytime soon."
"Picked this up on the first really cold day this year, 9 degrees. Poured into a 22oz tulip glass, a creamy pale brown with a smallish white head that fades to a bit of lace. Tastes like caramel and mild spices, a winter brew that isnt over done, thats a plus. A little over carbed for me, but very good non the less, and at 6% it provides a nice warmth."
"Slainte!"
"On a cold winter's night, this beer pours a clear amber with a nice 1"" head that sticks around throughout. The aromas are malty with some apple and spice. Yes, winter is here. The flavor is metallic, lightly spiced fruit, and slight herbal hop in the background. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a great English ale with some spice for the cold of winter."
"Taste is very similar to the aroma. Lost of sweet caramel malt and spiced apple. A bit of toffee and some herbal hop. Mildly bitter finish. Feel is a bit thin with plenty of carbonation. Light-medium body and a clean finish. Drinkability is pretty good. Goes down pretty easy though the taste is fairly plain."
"A nice winter warmer."
"This one is pretty typical of most winter ales I have had over the years, but still very good."
"A great beer from a great brewery. Very different compared to American ""winter warmers"" which are usually cloyingly sweet and over spiced. I could drink this all winter next to a fireplace...if i had one...and if i actually had money."
"This beer poured a copper color with a huge head, slightly rocky and off white, not much retention though. It also had very good lace. Smells are faint - mainly hops with some malt mixed in. Taste is again more hoppy than malty (though sweet malts are present), but not overly. This was also a very ""light"" beer - at least for a winter warmer. Nice drinkability though."
"Drinkabiliy: This is certainly drinkable and was really a great offering by Samuel Smith. If this were a little bit richer, I might have rated it higher, yet it's a tasty winter warmer and sure to please those who enjoy it!"
"Not blown away by the taste. At first it was very pungent, with even cheese like qualities, but settled out to a semi-sweet caramel-like flavor. More bitter than sweet, with some butter and pepper notes. Nothing too special, it is a fairly solid ale."
"2006-2007 version, 550 Mil bottle. Pours semi cloudy, lighter, dull orangy amber. Darker tan head, showing moderate retention, and leaving slippery spotty lace, upon a moderate swirl. Toasted whole wheat on the nose. Easy drinking middle of the road ale. Nice caramel sweet malt note in the finish. Nothing really stands out here, balance is what is going. I'm not a huge fan of balance. But this classic British brew from an all time all star brewery. Worthy sessioner."
"Very drinkable ale. Well done and I come to expect such efforts from Samuel Smith Brewery."
"Pours a beautiful translucent caramel color with a nice amount of head that dissipates and leaves lacing around the sides of the glass. Aroma is faint but sweet; mostly caramel and fruits on the nose. The beer is nicely carbonated and light on the tongue. The flavor isn't overly complex: caramel, candy and fruit shine up front with some burnt malts, very slight hops and an alcohol tingue towards the end. Overall a pretty sweet brew, but quite tasty and very drinkable. Samuel Smith's continues to impress."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's an inoffensive beer with decent flavor. The low alcohol seems out of place for a Winter Warmer, but it makes it pretty ""sessionable"" even though that's probably outside the session range. Certainly a decent beer, but not too impressive for a warmer."
"D- Winter Welcome is a pretty solid winter seasonal that is definitely worth a try. Recommended."
"mouth is slightly heavy and dry but smooth. drinkability is superior to most winter warmers. Highly impressed but then again it's a Sam Smith, I should have expecteed this."
"This beer was clear and copper colored, with a thick foam. The smell was malty sweet and a little estery, almost Belgian to my mind. The taste is toasty and biscuity, with loads of estery fruits, really good. The body is thicker than expected, lending a significant presence. An extremely good beer."
"Drinkability- Nice, but a bit cloying. One in a sitting is enough."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. Not exactly what I expected, but well made nonetheless."
"This is definitely a solid winter brew. More mild than most ""winter warmers"" so needs to be approached slightly more openly to fully enojoy it's beauty. The mouthfeel is beautiful and definitely helps it along. I know I'll be grabbing a few more of these before the season passes."
"Overall I can think of other ways I'd like to welcome winter, but this is still worth a shot."
"Future outlook: Decent enough beer, though not something that blew me away. Unlikely to go out of my way to obtain. Maybe next winter...."
"T extremely light vinegar, sharp and warm apple cidered taste. Some really great tastes come out, including caramel, and all the spices and vanilla come through very smoothly. Finishes with a nice hazelnut flavor that really helps this warmer end nicely. As my girlfriend pointed out to me, a little bit too carbonated for this style, but regardless a good winter beer"
"Good beer"
"Drinkability is good."
"pours a murky rust color with a tiny quickly fading white head. the nose is caramel, very sweet malts, alcohol undertones, a lil toffee, caramel apple. the taste is traditional watery English Ale for ya. tastes the same as the nose but also with a nice subtle spicy and floral hop crispness, detecting more lighter fruits like yellow apple. medium bodied, low spritzy carbo, dry finish. A decent ale."
"Overall, this is a very good winter warmer. The carbonation is rather high, but that does not deteriorate from how good the beer is. Another job well done."
"D Good with reasonable alcohol content. I could share the 4 pack with one other person (2 each) but I do not see buying this again. Too many other better beers to buy."
"This isn't what I expected from a winter warmer in that it was dry as a desert in hell and the alcohol was nearly undetectable and therefore unable to ""warm""."
"Packaged in their traditional pint sized, aluminum foil wrapped bottle, looking like a gourmet malt liquor. Pours a brown-copper color, nice head and a pretty good amount of lacing left on the glass. Smooth malt aroma, while the flavor is a spicy malt at first then a hoppy bite. Pretty well balanced. Sammy Smith's is pretty solid across the board."
"My second experience with Samuel Smith and I promise I will not be suckered again. Paid $4 bucks for this average looking, smelling, and tasting ale. Decent beer but definitely should not call itself a holiday brew. Nothing spectacular here just like their renowned oatmeal stout simply average but extremely overpriced. Good bye Mr. Smith"
"Drinkability- A great sipper on a winter evening."
"Drinkability: I've always enjoyed Sam Smith's beers and this one is no different. It's better than some, but not as good as some as their other ones. It's not too malty, bitter, sweet, or dry. It's just a well rounded English Ale. I could see cracking open one of these when winter rolls around again. It also makes a nice beer to have in the summer time."
"Final Thought: It reminds me of a prototype Bavarian doppelbock with a touch of sugar and spice which makes everything nice."
"D- A great winter warmer. 6% abv gives a nice warming feeling. Not to mention it is delicious."
"Interesting ale, had it in a pint glass."
"Drinkability: The quality and balance of this beer are pretty great. I even enjoyed this in the air conditioning, rather than waiting for winter, and I think it proves to be a brew for any season. A lot of complexity and many flavors to pick it out, along with being very sessionable in my opinion."
"D - This brew is quite sweet, and coupled with the watery finish, I wouldn't want more than one of these. Decent but unbalanced."
"I really liked this one. I will have another this year; this time during Winter."
"I love this stuff and it is one of my favorite winter brews. It starts off with a rich auburn color under a creamy tan head. The nose has buttery candy with sweet malts and lots of spice. What amazes me about the flavor is the huge amount of spice presence it has while remaining well balanced. A creamy medium body passes well over the palate. Just a nice malty brew."
"D: A tasty beer from Sam Smith's. A straight up English ale as a Winter Warmer is an interesting version, a beer to enjoy whenever the Yuletide comes around and you are aching for a taste of Olde England."
"I tried this beer on December 22, 2007 after purchasing my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a beautiful translucent pale red colour with a generous off-white head that disipates into rocky islands. The aroma is primarily malty with some sweet adjucts as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, and mildly carbonated. The flavout is primarily malt with some hop bitterness attached"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden amber color with a two finger beige head. The frothy head stuck around for a few minutes. Sweet, rich and cake like. There is a nice presence of caramel and malt. Smooth and creamy as hell. There is a blast of toffee and malt up front and a slight hop bitterness which balances out the beer very nicely. The feel is creamy-smooth and slick. Very drinkable. I would gladly drink more than the 550ml allows."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head above the clear caramel brew. Head falls slowly, with sporadic sticky lace. Aroma is lightly spiced hops. Taste is sweet malt upfront, ample fruitiness in the center, coupled with some spices, and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel not quite as smooth as it could be, and drinkability is not too bad either. Just a bit below what I've come to expect from Sam Smith."
"Overall a very balanced brew, easy to drink, with enough character to keep from getting boring. I snagged the last bottle at the store...and despite the clear bottle, age doesn't seem to be a problem. Hopefully I can try a fresh batch this coming winter to compare."
"This is a medium bodied beer. The carbonation level is comparable with most beers I've had. It's very easy to drink."
"Right off the bat I am loving the label. Bright and colorful with quotes from Shakespeare looking wonderful and inviting. Enjoyed chilled in a pint glass. Poured a orange tinged golden color with a good head. Smelled of what I would describe as marmalade slathered biscuits. Tasted a tad bitter, certainly warming to the palate with a good balance of malt and hops crating a symphony together. I will definitely enjoy the holidays with this one in the future."
"Efferevescent, rocky white, thin two-finger head that settles onto a clear, orange brown body--tracing present throughout drinking...sharp malty scents with fruity citrus esthers reminiscent of an IPA, but the hops are well-balanced here...smooth entry with a bit of texture and a bubbly end... otherwise, casual in its presence... malt initially impresses...mellows quckly with a minimal bite of hop...alcohol is subtle--pleasant but not harrassing... maltier and fruitier than I expected--and this is a good thing! A beautiful overall effect in the sense and a fitting compliment to a snowbound evening...."
"Overall this was pretty average and I dont understand why it was called a winter warmer either- should been a lot higher alcohol content in it for it to be labeled that-- or at least be able to taste the alcohol/warmth."
"D: Very drinkable. Not as overpowering as many winter beers. The combination of balance and complex flavors makes me want another."
"This beer poured a nice orange-brown from the bottle with a tall but thin tan colored head that faded fast and laced the glass very well on the way down. It has a nice rich malty smell with hints of sweet winter spices but i couldn't pick them out. The taste was pretty good for a winter warmer as it had a very nice sweet malty base with a bit of cinnamon and honey I tasted though it was very faint. It had a very smooth but light mouthfeel and I was expecting something a bit thicker and with more winter flavor. The drinkability was good but I think it would be better if it had more flavor and body to it."
"This poured a dark golden brown with fluffy light tan head. It smelled of malt and yeast. The flavor had mild hops bitterness with lots of malt and a bit of vanilla. It had a nice, smooth texture with only a little carbonation. This was a sweet and creamy drink, and overall very tasty but a bit plain."
"The pour was a copper orange with a frothy two finger white head that laces the glass somewhat. There really wasn't a strong smell for this beer. I could gather some roasted malts and some sweetness, but that was it. The taste was better though, but not all that I thought that it would be for a winter warmer. It popped with roasted malts, but not to malty. Also, I could taste the sweet sugars/molasses in this guy as well. The mouthfeel was ok but nothing to write home about. As far as drinkability goes, ONE and Done!"
"D- Not a bad brew but expected a little more from this one. Thought it was a little too light for a winter seasonal brew."
"This is a disappointment. I was expecting a nice warming and full bodied beer to sip on. What I got was a thin, watery, and bland beer that I don't really care to finish."
"The beer pours an amber and copper color with a modest off white head. The aroma is butterscotch, light hops and a tinge of alcohol. Medium bodied with light carbonation on the palate. Flavors of toasted malt and caramel are dominate in the juicy center of this beer. It is balanced by a very light but appropriate amount of bitterness. The beer is dry but smooth and tasty as well."
"The smell is malty with some citrus. The taste is mostly malt with a sweet butterscotch to it. It is pretty thin in the mouth but overall a good winter beer."
"Pours copper and clear. Smell is metallic and skunky malt. Tart malt flavor, with no noticeable wintry spices. Sweaty, musty lager like flavor. Slightly creamy and full body for the style, but not impressive overall. Drinkable, but too musty, doughy and stagnant flavored to be enjoyable for me. Somewhat poor example of a style I'm not particularly fond of."
"D - Definitely came out like an Oktoberfest. Pretty good for an English Oktoberfest."
"A very good winter warmer, even though they can run the gamut. I'm a hophead, so this one is alright by me."
"·	Very well in drinkability, I'll take another. Perhaps not as flavorful as other Sam Smith selections, but definitely a pleaser."
"Pours out a dark marmalade with a still body and a thin head that looks like frothed milk. Leaves some specks of lacing. Smells fantastic. Loads of caramel, toffee, dried fruits, nuts, and earthy hops with wisps of roasted and toasted malts. in the background. Flavors are similar to the aroma. There's more of a fruity ester thing going on rather than the dried fruit thing. The dried fruits are still there, though, along with a good deal of caramel. The toasty malts come out more as it warms. Sweet in the middle with a bit of a drying finish with some earthy hop. Mouthfeel is a little thin for what I'd expect from this. The carbonation could calm down just a touch. Decent drinker. Really hits the spot on a snowy March Texas day."
"D - Overall a decent beer from Sam Smith that wasn't really what one expects of a winter warmer as its prevelant taste in my opinion was honey. It was not very spiced at all but it does warm you up. I'd say that I'd get one maybe each year but given that funds are usually low during the holiday season there are better winter warmers as better prices."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I was expecting this beer to be well-crafted and it is, but I was not expecting it to be as light as it is considering the style. Overall, it's a good beer to drink for a long period of time."
"D - Very drinkable would go great with a steak or just kicking back."
"D - Pretty damn good. Not what I expected for a 'winter warmer'. I was expecting more spice and more alcohol feel. This it was not. Sweet, easy on the tongue and a good beer. Not one I'd want to session all night, but I'll look for it again next winter!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer has an overall drying quality to it. Other than that the body is much too thin, feels like water. Again perhaps I've a bad bottle or something. This is one, that I' don't think that I'll revisit, that is unless the other two I've left impress me, its okay, but just doesn't really do it for me. I don't think that its worth 2.50 for a 12oz bottle."
"D - Highly drinkable. To be honest this beer really surprised me. I will be picking a few more of these up soon. Recommended!"
"Overall very enjoyable beer I'll continue to go back to every winter."
"Also not much in terms of winter warmer."
"Pours a coppery, reddish brown out of the bottle with a fluffy, full white head, which hangs around for quite some time. Smells of dried fruits, maybe plum/apricot. Mild effervesence. Taste was a typical British ale taste, good, with notes of sweet barley malt and no real noticeable hop presence. Almost a hint of toffee as well. Not a bad ale. Quite enjoyable on a cold winter's night."
"D - Reasonable easy to drink, although nothing here that's too challenging or interesting."
"A nice winter warmer on a cold January night, but one or two is just fine."
"Pours a nice golden amber,with a thin head. Good retention,and a nice lacing. Smell is of sweet fruits,and spice. Body is rich,and creamy with some carbonation. Taste is nicely spiced. Sweet,and fruity, but a nice hoppy edge to the finish. Excellent brew!"
"Very drinkable. I couldn't wait for them to chill and drank it straight off the warm shelf."
"Pours a nice light amber with a medium sized head. Nice lacing on the surface and sides of the glass. Very light aroma. Caramel and cherries- but very light and subtle. Somewhat sweet caramel malt. Some mild fruit notes- cherries and pears. Spiciness in the finish. Just a touch of bitterness. Full bodied with light carbonation. Drinkable and tastey but not something I'd want to have a ton of. Overall a very solid winter beer."
"D: Back in my Purdue collage days livin' with the Slutz on Lutz. Pard and Warren would come in with cases of this shit and we'd drink them down as fast as we could open them. They don't taste as good as I remember, but its still a very good beer and very drinkable"
"D - Well, I keep wanting to take sips, because I can't stand the aftertaste. To be fair, I get this in a few winter warmers...I don't really like the spicy hoppy aftertaste. One or the other, but both don't work for me."
"Im a pretty big fan of Sam Smiths brews. Slightly pricey, but this is on a short list of beers Id definitely order during the winter months if its on the menu."
"Tastes of bready malts, spices, alcohol and light on the hops but they are still noticeable."
"This was a pretty decent beer, but my problem with it is that the malt is far too subtle compared to the hops, making this beer off-balanced. It poured a clear amber-red with a light tan head. I couldn't pull much aroma from the beer, just a milky cream aroma flavor that carried over into the flavor with a pale caramel malt and grassy hops. I wouldn't recommend this one."
"Poured into a pint glass pours an amber color with some serious head and that stays the entire drink. Smell is pretty bland I was expeting some spice and nutmeg smells but it really had a faint smell of blandness. Taste was also a a bit bland I am thinking that this could be a spoiled bottle Samuel Smith is just quality and this was missing it, just a sour bitterness in the taste. Overall I am hoping that this was a bad bottle, the taste was not there, I will get another bottle to compare."
"M/D: Medium bodied, not a lot of carbonation. Drinkability is about average on this, it's easy to drink, but I don't know if I would really want another."
"Great balance here. A nice winter ale I could drink all evening."
"M: very very clean, its weird, sometimes there is a tad aftertaste most of the time there isnt just like water, which is somewhat dissapointing"
"Pours orange with a decent head and good lacing. Smells bready and a bit grainy. Ther are also nice aromas of apple and orange. Malt predominates over hops. Taste is similar, and a tad sweeter than I would like. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin- I definitely remember this having more body. The spices and fruit are quite muted and overall it's not quite the harmonious whole that one would wish."
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very enjoyable. this is one solid english. time to pick up a few more before they're gone..."
"Quite easily drinkable, but to gulp it would be to waste it."
"Edit.. When Brenda and I bought our first house, we got the key at 8:00 am... We went immediately to Home Depot and rented a floor sander.. after pretty much 16 straight hours of sanding, it was time to stain the floors... Steven and I stained the entire house in the next 5 hours... It is 7:00 am and the sun is coming up... we are covered in sawdust and smell like gasoline.... Steven and I have had no beer since we started working and REALLY could use one... we check out the fridge, and the previous owners left a nicely wrapped Samuel Smith Winter Welcome '02-'03... That brew was one of the best beers and the nicest welcomes a person could have given us... Thanks."
"Drinkability> easy peasy. I could drink this anytime, though I won't rush to buy it. I tend to like my winter ales to be a little bit heavier, but my man loved this, and people who like a lighter and easier to drink (in mass quantities) winter ale will really enjoy this."
"Pours a nice clear amber color with 1/2 inch of pillowy tan head, ok lacing. Not very much smell, not even after sticking as much of my nose into the glass as possible. Overall just some maltiness and some holiday spices. Taste-wise it's very shocking though, lots of sweetness, combining toffee, caramel, and butterscotch with toasted malt, honey, and grapes, with a hoppy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Better warm. While not the greatest winter warmer I've ever had, it did a pretty decent job at satisfying my taste buds, but it won't be a beer I camp out at the beer store to get again."
"Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome Ale 2007-2008 edition pours a light copper color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a mildly sweet aroma. The taste is fairly mild for a winter warmer, I'm hit up front by the hops, which aren't really very strong, followed by a pleasant malt flavor, that doesn't quite reach the caramel level but comes close. A very pleasant beer."
"This is a quite light winter warmer and I typically enjoy mine a little bit, um . . warmer. That being said it is a good, well-balanced brew."
"I really enjoyed this beer. FIrst of all, I consider myself to be a pretty stingy judge of appearance but this beer deserves every half point. It has a beautiful amber/red color with a nice inch of tight white head that lasts until the end. The ample carbonation gives the amber body a nice feeling of upward movement with nice tiny bubbles. This is not the most fragrant beer but what is there is some apple and sweet malts. The taste is hints of grainy malts with and brandy overtones and just a hint of winter spices. there is a great amount of carbonation and it is bot too thick and not too creamy, just right. Not necessarily the christmasiest of all ales but it is really enjoyable and i am quite glad i drank it."
"Pours a deep amber with a firm white head that doesn't diminish and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Very inviting looking. Very faint nose -- pretty much caramel malts with a hint of spices. Taste is cloyingly sweet -- toffee, butterscotch, egg nog spices -- with a dry, slightly hoppy finish that slides into an unfortunate astringency. Snappy carbonation in the mouthfeel with a medium to light-bodied presence. Decent drinkability on the whole, but nothing spectacular. I certainly don't regret drinking this -- it was better than I expected based on other reviews. But it's not a seasonal that I will be waiting on pins and needles for either. Pretty much the Old Brewery Pale Ale with faint spices and what seems like a little extra hopping thrown in."
"A solid ok, probably not something I would search out for a winter warmer."
"This beer is a well crafted version of an English winter warmer. At 6% abv, the alcohol is at the lower end of the scale for the style. I liked the balance of ingredients as well as the depth of flavor. This is the first time I have tried this seasonal classic and I must say I will certainly be making it part of my winter selections for years to come."
"Mouthfeel is carbonated and oily, with a dry finish. Not a whole lot of aftertaste, but what is there is sort of ""flat"" for lack of a better word. A drinkable, decent winter ale, but not something I go searching for."
"Amber color with a white whipped cream head. The aromas begin with delicate spicy hop character and then theres other notes of bright fruits, pineapple, and apple that come around. Berry fruitiness on a mild toasted grain background, husky, and bisquity. Floral, herbal tea hops with a slight bittering character balances while the spice play their role nicely, not too much and just enough to linger on the palate for a bit. Some honey sweetness fades to more tart berry finish on a decently smooth mouthfeel and a lazy fizz carbonation. Pretty tasty, nice balance, and rather drinkable."
"D: A fairly drinkable beer. Good mouthfeel and balanced taste makes it appropriate for it's name as it is very ""welcoming."" Based on the nature of this beer, I believe it will be better enjoyed when warmed up a little and served between 40F and 50F."
"D-Seems to be a fairly drinkalbe beer,spiced like a Winter Warmer but a little low on the % side.I would buy this again."
"The appearance was beautiful when it poured. Thin and smooth, the beverage leveled off with a very, crisp thin head and a shiny, golden amber color. The smell was not what I expected with the appearance. Roasty, citrus combinations line the taste as it evaporates into your nose with a pinch of orange. The taste was a good sweet-bitter touch that, indeed, warmed you up. The mouthfeel was wicked crisp, allowing it to be enjoyed the whole evening. Overall, a little off-balance at times, but great winter warmer."
"Gorgeously clear amber color with a creamy tan head. This is a beauty to see in the glass. Uh oh, wet dog in the aroma, but after a few minutes it went away, leaving a little toffee and some minerally metallic thing. Slightly sour, acidic finish with some mild hop bitters. As it warms up the alcohol comes out a little, and then hides on the next sip in favor of some toffee/ biscuit flavors. Aside from the appearance, the rest is just so-so."
"This is a very nice winter brew for winter such as mine with temps in the 20s and low 30s."
"Drinkability is okay, but not something I will need to buy again. Frankly, I had hoped for more with this beer."
"I was expecting some big things from this winter warmer since I have enjoyed a few other Samuel Smith's before. The color was rusty red and filtered clear. The smell had caramel, cinnamon, and faint chocolate. The taste on the other hand had a strong wood taste that over powered the whole beer. The feel was dry and bitter. There was also a bit of an alcohol feel on the tongue that decreased its drinkability. Overall, I will not be making another purchase of this beer."
"Better winter warmers out there, and cheaper ones too, but overall a decent beer."
"Pours a clear ruby with a little bit of head that leaves a little bit of lace on the way down. Nose has a touch of pine and surprisingly (for a 6% ABV) I am getting alcohol. Taste is rather dry. I dont think I have had a beer this dry before. Seems a bit woody, kind of like sucking on a piece of oak. For a winter warmer, I am not feeling very warmed. Mouthfeel is standard. Drinkable, sure. But I think there are better of the style out there. Overall, a disappointment Id say."
"Sam Smith's Winter Welcome poured a deep copper color with a tan head the dissipated into a film crowning the top of the beer. Little beads of carbonation was very visible in the body. The nose was filled with the aroma of cinnamon, fruits such as apples and slight notes of pears. The taste was similar to the smell but with a sharp mineral flavor that lingered in the mouth. The beer popped and fizzed on my tounge creating a silky feeling body."
"2007-2008 vintage. Poured a clear amber with a two finger off-white head. Good retention and nicely carbonated with a steady flow of small bubbles. The nose was of malt but not overly pronounced, feint at best, disapponting. Taste was sharp, bitter with a malty finish. A slight hoppy mouthfeel with caramel and malt. The six per cent alcohol is certainly on the low side for a winter warmer but came across as much higher, I thought it took away from what could have been a much better experience. Who doesn't take a liking to the label but I wouldn't rush out to buy more of this."
"Overall, a decent beer, but not quite a winter warmer in my book. It is very well made, and would be better classified as a brown. But for being a winter warmer, I would expect more alcohol, more hops, and certainly a little spice. I do enjoy this, but I think with just a hint of spice this would be a bit more ""wintery"". Great seasonal session beer though..."
"This beer pours a perfect crystal clear amber with a finger head that lingers for a short time. There seems to be a lot of carbonation in this one. The smell is malty sweetness, a little bready, with an earthy hop scent. The taste is very well balanced. There is a nutty, malty brown sweetness up front which quickly gives way to a hoppy bitterness. There are also hints of some spice and fruitiness in the taste as well The hops definitely play a bigger part in the taste then I would have expected. The mouthfeel is a little thin but this beer is highly drinkable."
"The taste has a big malt profile: caramel and roasted malt tickle my taste buds oh so nicely and there's more hop goodness than I would have suspected going by the smell. Wonderful balance and a real treat to sip on. It has a medium mouthfeel, the caronation is medium, and it finishes with a good crisp hoppy dryness. Love it. It's one of my favourite Winter Warmers and I'm always so pleased to find it on the shelf and now that SS keeps putting it in brown bottles, no more fear of getting a skunked bottle! I recommend it highly!"
"Poured into a pint glass. This beer poured a honey color with a white 2 finger head that left great lacing down the side of the glass. This beer reminded me of drinking a cup of apple cider(only cold) and had a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg in the after taste. The smell of this beer really made me think I was drinking apple cider, the apple scent was there from start to finish. This beer was very light and easy to drink, All in all this is a great seasonal. Makes me wish it was winter year round."
"Pretty good flavor but nothing really stood out. I guess I would expect a lot more for the price ($3.50 pint) and I think there are better winter ales out there but I don't think you would be too disappointed at least trying one."
"Appearance of this 06/07 is a deep copper color with a thin head, but has nice lacing. Smell is light in malt and spice. Taste is a bit thin in malt and spice with a fair amount of hop and carbonation. A little less than what I expected ( being that S.S. is hard to dissapoint me), I guess I expected something rich with more body in a winter warmer."
"Pours copper-colored, with a nice white head that leaves a thick collar, and lacing as you drink. Aroma is caramel malt and some faint earthy hops, with hints of the alcohol. Flavor is caramel and malt, with some earthy character. Alcohol is apparent, but not overwhelming. Thank goodness they finally put this in dark brown bottles. It is so much better than the light struck versions I had on previous years."
"Heavy pour into a pint glass for extra head. Slight lacing with ok head retention. I instantly smell the sweetness of the beer followed by a mild smell of alcohol and fruit. It is a nice, rich amber colour with about 50% transparency. Took a heavy sip (everything I do is heavy because I'm big) and felt the mild alcohol fruitiness that I was smelling. The sweetness was a pleasure as this is the first winter warmer that I've had and pretty much one of the first beers that wasn't incredibly bitter, like I like. My only complaint is that the beer is a little watered down and it seems like Samuel Smith may have tried to do too much. There are plenty of confounding tastes but the warm alcohol feeling makes it a stable winter warmer, and a fun beer to review"
"My first ever brew from the Samuel Smith Company from England, and I am not at all dissapointed... the cashier at Shop Rite liquors was right when he said that this was an awesome brew... the appearance is great... a nice ruby red color with a foamy head... the smell is of burnt caramel, malts, some spices and a little vanilla... the taste strongly complements the aroma, with a nice sweet flavor in the aftertaste... the brew has a great mouthfeel and is easily drinkable... most likely will buy another one of these 18 oz bottles with the decorative logo... Although the taste is not above and beyond, it definitely satisfies for a winter warmer and is flavorful enough to warrant a sample... Recommended...."
"Eric"
"this year(2007/2008) the beer pours a light amber color, the head is thick at first, but fades to a thin haze and dosen't stick much. smells kind of like corriander and cinnamin. the taste is fairily light for a winter warmer, and the flavors are all individualy subtle. the mouth-feel is nice, medium carbonation and i think I could chug this, if I were a fool. nice mellow warming affect."
"I would not recommend this."
"Pours a medium ruddy hue with slight orange accents with three fingers of head from an unaggressive pour. Head dissipated rather quickly and left only a very thin blanket of lace with little to no lacing on the glass walls. I smell a sweet scent of toffee and caramel at first with slight touches of biscuity malt and cinnamon. The scent isn't heavy and you need to really get your nose into it for those smells to become dominant. The taste is very light and easy on the palate. I do pick up slight flavors of malt, dark fruit, and butterscotch. Mouthfeel is very smooth with low carbination and a nice sippable factor to it as well and lends itself for great drinkability all year long really."
"A nice beer from a brewery that has my favorte stout since the 80's."
"D: Carbonation problems aside, this is a very drinkable beer. Works great as a slow sipper, and I could easily drink these all night while sitting in front of a fire."
"There's no doubt that this is a great beer, I'm not just sure I want to pay the 5$ per bottle to get it. It's got a great amber color, highly carbonated, and smells a little bit f cinammon of alcohol. There's really nothing particularly interesting about the taste. Some lagging sweet notes in the malt compared to the relatively bitter smell is interesting. Aftertaste of raisins. But I don't think it's strong enough, especially for a winter warmer."
"Dissapointed with the taste. It's not bad, but it's not as good as most Samuel Smith products. It's just a little bland. There's a nice balance between hops and malts. Nothing especially off-putting here. But there's no kick, or wow factor. The mouthfeel is flat and uninvigorating, especailly for a ""winter warmer."""
"D- This is definitely one I would have again. It was nice to taste a true English winter warmer and I found this brew to be quite refreshing. Probably not something I will find myself wanting again anytime soon though."
"D - Bummer considering the smell potential..."
"Started out good with a big frothy, light slightly hazy copper color. Pleasant piney hops and light sweet malts on the nose. Taste is a bit dissappointing, light, grainy with some of their trademarked butterscotch flavors too. Bitter hops at the end, but not very good tasting. It contrasts too much, the aftertaste is not very good, stale and out of place. Not what I am looking for in a winter warmer."
"I'll tell you what, I feel pretty welcome after finishing this off. More please."
"Flavor is of toasted malts, bitter hops, spices which combine with the hops, and a touch of caramel sweetness. Quite dry feel."
"D: This beer is heavier in body than a lot of winter warmers at this ABV. There is nothing wrong with this beer and at the lower ABV than most American styles this is quite quaffable for the evening."
"Now overall I have to be honest I have not been the biggest fan of their beers over the years but this one was very nice. I really enjoyed it and would easily grab for it again."
"Drinks alright, I could do 2-3 of these before boredom set in. This year's seem more hoppier than most I've had. Works well"
"I hear the pint bottles are a bit more expensive, but I think it might be worth a pick-up regardless of price or size. The bottle art alone is enough to make you spring for it."
"D - This was really nice to drink, but something about it keeps me from drinking it quickly. Which isn't bad at all."
"Palate is warm with alcohol, rich & malty with spice, and finishes with a citrus baked dessert sweetness. Alcohol is present on the finish as well."
"Light bodied, fairly mild and drinkable, the metallic presence is unpleasant, though."
"A dissapointed in my November haul. Had it after Wychwood's offering and this just didn't match up. A decent enough ale, but not as interesting as a winter ale should be... in my humble opinion of course."
"Overall, not bad, not good, somewhere in between. Easy to drink and has a nice malty quality that I like in winter beers. Not spiced and not dark like the new winter warmers I really enjoy."
"D - Beer is easy to consume. I would have another one."
"There was a lot of hype surrounding this beer. Everyone at work kept telling me this was the best holiday beer available. Big disappointment. The beer poured a nice copper color with a big, rocky off white head. The smell was all malt. Heavy sweetness with slight hoppiness. The taste was heavy mineral. It had almost an iron taste to it which dominated thoughout. It overshadowed the malt sweetness I expected. The mouthfeel was medium body with mild carbonation. Overall drinkability for me was disappointing. I wasn't impressed by this beer as I thought I would be."
"This winter warmer pours a coppery to gold liquid with a fluffy craggy two finger head. This brew gives head on demand. LOL! Lots of carbonation and lace. Smell is a spiced malt. Cloves and caramel. Some hops. Taste is a extremely pleasing malted base with the caramel, spice, and hops. A slight sour finish. Mouthfeel is overall clean. The malt is fairly sweet and full. An extremely drinkable winter warmer, one which I am sure to seek out each season."
"The taste was kinda predictable and british when served too cold. Some generic malts and some hop bitterness. The spiciness was fairly mild and it was a little dry. The flavor didn't change much with temp but the aroma enhanced it a bit. It had a moderate amount of carbonation and a nice aftertaste. Pretty drinkable over all."
"D: Very drinkable - would be fabulous right in front of a nice warm fire."
"D = Very drinkable. This is a relatively mellow brew and not the best choice if you are looking for a highly spiced, very fruity winter brew. However, it has an elegance many winter beers lack and is very satisfying in a mellow, classy sort of way. A great brew for sitting back by a fire and watching the snow fall outside."
"12 ounce bottle, 2007-2008 vintage. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a copper color with a half-inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. The aroma is malty, it smells like toasted malt and caramel, with a bit of spice and fruityness too. It tastes the same way to me, but the spicyness in the beer is subdued. I think the beer could use some more spice, it needs to be kicked up a bit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, not hard to drink at all. Overall I think it's a decent, enjoyable winter warmer. I'd pick it up again."
"Winter '10-'11 update - I really look forward to getting this beer fresh each November it's very good."
"An impressive beer from Samuel Smith, Winter Welcome Ale is a tremendous way to enjoy a cold Fall or Winter evening, coupled with a good book by the fire or chin-wagging with friends. I had this 550 mL bottle chilled in the refrigerator for a couple days rather than warm, and it was absolutely delicious. This beverage pours a nice brown-red body with a rich head, with a nice slightly fruity aroma emanating from it. The taste is smooth and delicious, with a nice blend of fruit and mild spices coming forth. It finishes smoothly and is delicious enough to have a few. One of my favorite Samuel Smith products. Though I cannot say I've ever had a bad one from this first-rate English brewery, Winter Welcome Ale ranks high on my list from them and in general, and should be a welcome addition to anyone's refrigerator as 2007 winds into 2008. A very fine product."
"Drinkability: It's fine, however wholly unremarkable it may be."
"D: certainly drinkable. could have a few, but wasn't as spice laden as many winter/holiday offerings tend to be"
"Light copper color that forms a big head in my pint glass. In the aroma, there are notes of bubblegum, alcohol, spice, and light husk. Moving on to the tasting, I'm getting a more mellow flavor. Little bite with a moderate malty flavor. Hops come up in the back. Notes of raisins and semi-sweet chocolate. A fume of alcohol slowly warms the stomach. No serious complaints here."
"Pours an amber color with a small, less than one-finger head. Aroma is nice and malty, spicy and to the point for the style. Taste is somewhat fruity with spice at the back of the throat. A second sip confirms the spices in what appears to be a well balanced beer. This isn't overpowering like a few other winter warmers I've reviewed. Nice and actually quenchable for a cold fall evening."
"The slate tablets have spoken. This is the ooey goody goodness standard to hold this style too. Thank you England."
"A bit disappointing for a Samuel Smith's beer. Need to sample this one again in the future. Note: drink close to room temperature."
"Average to high body."
"clear dark amber. off white head with good retention and good lace. smells aren't incredibley strong, but there is some fruitiness (raspberry) and a hint of sweetness, some spice (cinnamon maybe?) and a decent malt character. tastes the same. definite fruit as the beer warms a little. Soft, smooth and very good. Proper, soft spoken. What a pleasure. Maybe people who expect out there, cutting edge and different won't be satisfied by this one, but I think it is a great beer. Here comes snow!!!"
"Little tingle from a hint of pepper but it fades quickly as does the aroma, taste and interest in having a follow-up beer"
"D- 6%abv makes this a surprisingly easy-drinking ""winter warmer", this is usually a plus, but I would prefer more body and alcohol heft to a winter ale, an interesting ale with a colorful label, but I am not too compelled for a repeat performance"
"Drinkability: I expected more from this beer. Perhaps I got a bad bottle. Will try it again."
"drinkability is great. this is a mild brew that does well to warm one up inside. would go great with some apple pie. cheers!"
"Taste: This is a quality brew. Heavy on the malt flavor, especially toasted and caramel flavors, along with a biscuity flavor. Hop is barely noticable, but comes through at the end for balance. There is also some toffee and a pumpkiny spice character hidden in there."
"550 ml brown bottle, winter 2007-2008, now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet). BB end of August 08. ABV is 6.0%. Clear amber colour, huge off-white head. Moderate malty aroma, notes of caramel, toffee and biscuits. The flavour is also moderately malty and quite sweet, with notes of treacle, toffee and hints of oak. Moderate hops in the finish. Nothing wrong with it, but not really outstanding. It is quite obvious that this beer is not bottle conditioned."
"taste is much sharper and more bracing, hops are more present and floral fresh, complementing the toasty sweet malt. herbal dry finish and a velvety mouthfeel. 3.5, 4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5."
"Drinkability: unlike many winter beers which are overpowered with spices, this beer relied on well balanced hops and malty sweetness. I'd drink several at just about anytime, not just in chilly weather."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a copper-amber color with a thin, slightly creamy-looking head. Smell is subtle - bready with a bit of spice and a grainy maltyness. The taste is quite malty and there is minimal spice, with a toasted malt flavor that I had not picked up on in the smell. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly prickly carbonation. Overall this is a drinkable beer and is a decent Winter Warmer."
"Drinkability: A great winter session beer."
"Pours with a two-finger very light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Nice clear amber color. Medium bodied. Malty nose. Light-medium carbonation. Flavor is malty, caramel, slight dryness at finish. No hint of seaweed. $2.50 for a 12oz clear bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"A nice drink - this is the wrong season for it, but it serves very nicely as an evening sipper. A little heavy/boozy for repeated applications, but thoroughly pleasant. I have yet to have a dud from Sam Smith."
"Nice winter warmer as winter hangs on here in Maryland into April. The spice flavor was a bit heavier than I care for, but was balanced nicely by the bittering. The carbonation could have been toned down as well. Very easy to drink, though."
"April 29th in Tidewater VA is hardly winter, but this is not a strictly winter brew like Mad Elf or Delirium Noel. Pours a very clear light amber with a medium size frothy white head. I did not detect much of a smell. The taste was very smooth and malty without any of the heaviness or spiciness that I would associate with a winter beer. This is a year round brew. I had it with cheese and crackers and found it a very flavorful and mild accompaniment to the snack. Very drinkable (although 6 abv). I would have this one again."
"I know this could not have been below 50ish degrees out of the bottle, but it certainly took off & got much better with about 10 minutes of blooming in a pint glass, so I would definitely recommend allowing it to come up in temperature and get some air. Its nice, a welcome change from the Americanized spiced versions. If you like Scottish Ales I would definitely give this a shot, and if you just like a nice, easy to drink, subtly sweet malt profile then this is for you. Could pair this with a nice sharp cheddar, or even a softer, riper cheese, as well as any meat & potato combos. A nice Winter Warmer, and one I recommend (after its warmed) and will enjoy annually."
"A very easy drinking beer, tastes very good. But at the price, it's very easy to find a comparable or better beer for far less."
"Comments: Very tasty Winter Warmer. Not overdone with spices as in most WW. Almost an Old Ale but not as high ABV as most Old Ales. Good flavor & well balanced. Again, a bit sweet after a full bottle, but a smaller portion would be perfect."
"Very drinkable, could make decent session fare. But at 6% alcohol perhaps its better suited to sipping in front of the fire with family and friends on a cold winter night. Ill be looking for this one again next winter."
"Overall a great brew. It wouldn't hurt if it was a tad bit stronger as in other winter warmers, but it gets the job done. Will definitely have this again."
"good stuff."
"550ml brown(!) bottle purchased at of all places Richmond variety of all places... Copper-amber translucent body with about an inch of light tan head that leaves really good lacing. Smells fruity, spicy, and biscuity. Tastes sweet, fruity and malty with a roasty caramel character that surfaces toward the finish and just a hint of a metalic quality. Complex and pleasing flavor whose only flaw is letting the alcohol show a bit much for a 6%ABV offering. That flaw fades after a few sips. Creamy full mouthfeel. As I have more, the rich caramel malt becomes more apparent. Very drinkable considerin how rich and full it is. Wow, this is a good beer. Definitely picking up a few more bottles before the winter's out."
"I think it's a nice and enjoyable beer, but it's not something I'd go for too often. Not as ""wintery"" as some winter beers I've had, and if I had a wider selection I'd probably try something else. But I think if you like beers with some sweeter hints like this, it's something good to at least try!"
"This beer is much better as it approaches room temperature. Cold it is not very good."
"It's only somewhat ""warming"" wiith some vague, restrained spiciness. It's decent, but not one of this great brewery's better offerings, IMO."
"D: An ok holiday ale. Light and drinkable but not really what I would be looking for in this style."
"warmer."
"I am looking forward to many more years of this."
"Big clear bottle with nice label. The smell is alright, biscuit malt and caramel. I foud this to be nicely flavored for the style with toasted caramel and spices. Fruit comes through a bit and it finishes with an herbal hoppiness. Mouthfeel is very creamy. Overall it is a good beer but a little too expensive for me to buy more."
"2006 bottle gifted from LCBO in Toronto, sampled in early 2007. Pours a clear brown with little carbonation. Gentle spicy aroma, and a nice spicy taste, although the taste fades a tad too quickly for my liking. Perhaps this is one that improves with aging?"
"DA: This is one of my favorite winter-style brews with good balance and not overly spiced or sweetened. Pretty easy to drink at 6%."
"Poured a golden color, clear, small off-white head with no lacing. It smells of butterscotch. The taste is of caramel malt, some bitter hops, not very distinct. This is my first English version of the winter warmer, definitely not as spicy as the American counterpart. The mouthfeel is light but not watery, fizzy carbonation, crisp. This is quite neutral of an ale but very drinkable."
"Overall: Decent, but not malty enough to cut through those cold winter evenings for me. I like to break this one out once a year to enjoy, but that's about it."
"Overall a nice, fairly straightforward beer. I could definitely knock back a few of these - if only I could afford to buy them!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head above the clear caramel brew. Head falls slowly, with sporadic sticky lace. Aroma is lightly spiced hops. Taste is sweet malt upfront, ample fruitiness in the center, coupled with some spices, and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel not quite as smooth as it could be, and drinkability is not too bad either. Just a bit below what I've come to expect from Sam Smith."
"Not what I expected in a Winter Warmer. Someone told me it's because it's an English Warmer. They don't spice like others. I will not seek this out again. Too much money for so little flavor."
"This beer was not as spicy and complex as I expected from a ""winter"" beer but was very acceptable for sure."
"D: Not bad. Give it some more carbonation and density, and I could come back to it again. Otherwise, i'll skip it."
"This one just screams British beer. Deep, light brown body. Perfect carbonation, which adds a tiny bit of spice. It's actually hard to tell if it's an ale or lager, as it has British characteristics of both. The sweetness of carmel malts, and the mellow bite of low alpha hops. Just barely sticky. Possibly some spices are present, but all the flavors are very mellow and round, and work in harmony. Very nutty aftertaste. A great winter tradition I've enjoyed for almost 10 years. Cheers!"
"I really like this beer, I buy it every year. This year is different enough that I think it deserves a re-review. First thing thats different... brown bottles. Pours red/amber with a medium offwhite head. The smell is much more malty that I recall. Lots of caramel, toffee, baking bread. The taste has the same malt profile, with a little bit of citrusy hop twang. Mouthfeel is a fair medium. I can say this is fairly different than I remember, and I've been buying this every year for some time. While a lot of the malt tastes and smells seem cleaner and clearer, it also seems to be lacking in some of the yeasty/beery elements that I would say made up a good part of the charm that this beer had. Maybe this is due to the brown bottles, maybe a different yeast stain. With the cleaner flavors and larger profile that allows, technically speaking I would say this is a good thing. Although, and maybe this is just me, I kinda miss the beery/funky taste."
"2006/07 550ml brown bottle purchased at Green's in Greenville, SC. Pours a clear amber/orange with a big fluffy off white head. Sweet malty smell with a touch of toffee in the background. Taste is of sweet carmel malt, with a hint of orange peel and spice. The Hops are mild, but apparent. The alcohol is warming but not overdone. A very nice winter warmer."
"Personally, I prefer something a bit more heavy in the dead of winter, but that doesn't keep this from being a decently tasty brew. Thumbs up."
"My original review was last year's vintage, to which I gave a 3.6 and complained about the clear bottles. My wishes were fulfilled when I found a brown-glass 550 mL (Victorian pint) for this year's vintage - figured I should re-review the beer. It pours a light copper with a finger of tan head that reduces to a collar. The aroma is pleasant, with red apples, cherries, toasted malts, floral hops, and light spice. It tastes of roasted/toasted malts, green/leafy, oily, and floral hops, and a bitterness that begins light, but becomes medium. The body is fairly carbonated, medium, and leaves a light to medium finish. A pretty good English ale, and I'm glad they switched to the brown bottles."
"The pour from the new brown bottle into my Sam Smith pint glass raises a bubbly three finger head that is quite loud, and fizzles down quickly to a still respectable half-finger, which leaves a bit of sticky lacing. The head is off-white, over a delightfully hued deep amber/copper body. The nose is sweet, and a bit minerally, and overall seems a bit thin. The taste is full of that characteristic minerally Sam Smith flavor, but has a nice breadiness, and sweet caramel and toffee notes. The mouth is noticeably thin, and has a fine but cutting carbonation. This is a very quaffable ale that I would love to have regualar access to."
"This was the first year in a long time that I got the Winter Welcome. As with what everyone has already said I am glad that they have finally gone to brown bottles. In the past it was hit and miss I guess with the clear bottles and off flavors. This year the brew was very nice, had a copper color to it with a smallish light tan head that had some legs. The aroma was not too shabby; a lot of caramel was present mixed in with a toasted scent. The taste is quite nice, easy drinking as I have really polished it off when I was putting together my hiking equipment. Nice malt flavor at the start that really seems to carry right through, also notes of different spices through out and a slight hop finish. This is a nice brew, one that I use to really look forward to probably 5+ years ago, guess I kind of forgot about it. Glad that I gave it a try this year, will be one that I look for around the holidays in the future."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and mild to medium in carbonation. I will seek this one out again."
"Pours an attractive clear copper in color with a light khaki colored head. Aroma consists of caramel malt, toasted biscuit and floral hops. The mouthfeel is soft and medium in body. Light malt flavor upfront and mildly hoppy throughout. Herbal floral hoppiness in the finish contributes to a light bitterness toward the back. This is easily drinkable. Although it's not what's ""expected"" now with all the seasonal spicing and higher alcohol levels (despite it's 6% abv) in most American winter warmers, this is a nice and drinkable English Ale."
"This beer has a nice copper color with a white head. The beer has high clarity with low head retention and a it leaves a little lacing on the glass. The smell is of caramel malts and sweetness maybe a bit of spice, cinnamon or ginger perhaps, as well. The taste is fairly well rounded fruity sweetness mixed with a slight acidic taste from the spices and hops there is also a bit of metallic tangyness in there as well, the alcohol comes through as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is light and slightly acidic fairly highly carbonated. The drinkability is better than fair there is nothing challenging or off putting about this beer, it's not bad."
"Fine conditioning make this a smooth and easy drinker and a welcome one at that. While not as gimmicky as many winter warmers, this one makes a casual, yet interesting appearance which I will certainly have again."
"D: Good. It's light in body and not over-the-top in spices. Reminds me basically of an English Ale with just a tad bit of spice, thereby allowing it to call itself a ""winter ale."""
"M/D - Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation is easy going. This is a solid tasty offering."
"I actually could drink alot of these and it is obviously a well crafted brew, but i prefer my winter warmers to be a little darker or spicier. This sort of fell in the middle. A pleasant experience overall."
"The drinkability is very good, Great, No prob knocking several of these back. but all in all not a beer I will get lots of, too many others to dring that have the whole package. Prosit MK"
"D - I could drink these all day!"
"16.9oz bottle, poured a nice clear dull brown, maybe a little orange in there, with a bubbly/fluffy white head that dissipates after a minute. The smoothness and subtle spiciness really make this a nice and mild beer to drink. Little toastly malt as well as caramel presence there too. Carbonation gives a somewhat prickly mouthfeel at first but overall a smoothness takes over."
"The is a light version of the winter ale, making it a very drinkable brew. I find alot of winter welcomes to be too overwhelming for long sessions, but this one i think deserves one session a year."
"This offering from Samuel Smith's pours a maroon burnt sienna leaving a thick frothy off-white head and a crystal clear body. The aroma is caramel, plum, yeast, fruity, faint hop essence. The taste starts nutty and fruity with slight funky esters with a tart acidic bitterness rounded out by more bready, fruity, plum, fig sweetness. This is a good beer mild but satisfying."
"D - I would definitely get this again. I really wish we could get this in brown bottles, because I'm always hesitant to buy imports in clear glass. But I'll be looking for this again."
"Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Not overly heavy like a lot of winter ales."
"Delicate and complex flavors to be admired. This makes it a very light ale. Ive read that this was one of the original winter warmers and modern variations are much stronger and bolder. I respect Winter Welcome for this, although I dont think it stands up to modern Winter Warmer standards. It does not have big malt presence, among other lacking qualities. It would make a weak Old Ale or a good solid English Pale Ale."
"not to shabby! I would buy this again as long as I can find it around here."
"When I saw this at one of my local stores, I just had to pick it up. I have had several other Samuel Smith's and they have all been fantastic so I wanted to try this one out too. It wasn't until I got home and poured a bottle into my mug that I noticed that the four bottles in the pack were from the 2005-2006 series (I bought this on Dec. 6 2006). I guess the 6% alcohol has kept this four pack alright because it wasn't flat or sour/sunky. It poured a wonderful amber color with a nice think foamy head. The tase was malty with just a hint of something extra....ginger perhaps? I really wish I had this brew before so that I could compare it to see if the age has affected it at all. Well, I recommend the 2005-2006...that is if anyone out there still has any around! I would love to hear some comments letting me know if this beer can be aged for a year with out it going bad!!!!"
"Drinkability: A very drinkable and enjoyable beer, even at 6% alcohol. There are just so many winter brews to try, I don't know if I'll get around to picking another up. This will make my list of gets for next winter."
"Thanks, beerhandy"
"M&D - smooth, enough so the girlfriend didnt hate it, but a nice winter beer that would keep an Athabaskan warm. enjoyable and shareable, a great holiday beer, if not one of the best"
"appears a very clear orange/brown color in the glass, with a 1-finger off-white head that leaves hints of lacing. smells of buttered rum, caramel, and a slight hint of bread/yeast. tastes like buttered rum/butterscotch; lots of biscuit flavor; a very nice peppery finish with hints of nutmeg, and a good amount of hops bitterness. these flavors, playing off of one another, put me more in the mind of winter and the holidays than the candied sweetness of other winter warmers. mouthfeel is quite buttery and oily, which actually seems just right to match the flavors. drinkability is high. this is a very understated and classy beer that truly does make a nice winter warmer. the spices seem right for a cold night by a fire, and the abv is just enough to give you a kick of warmth without overdoing it."
"Not a bad beer, but really not special. Samuel Smith has a lot of better offerings out there, the Porter being my favorite."
"Mouthfeel is rather thick and coats the mouth well. Drinkability is so so. I probably won't be buying another, but I'll definately finish this bottle."
"d - another solid effort from s.s. but while most of their brews are very good, they are not worth the price in my opinion."
"Half way through I was thinking I would like another but by the end of the glass I'd decided I'd had enough of that. It's a good, well crafted beer but I didn't find inspiring and I was of the ""I could take it or leave it"" attitude."
"D - Pretty good beer. I found it interesting that it tasted very different than it smelled."
"D - Very different from the US winter warmers that I have been enjoying this season. Thick with a much milder hop presence, this beer fills quickly leaving me struggling to finish this 550ml bottle."
"Overall, not worth the 3.99 I paid for it. When I'm getting sixer's of Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale for 7 bucks, I'm not going to waste time on this."
"D: A pretty good beer, enjoyable & drinkable, though not one I'd rave about. Has an ABV on the low end for the style, so it could almost be enjoyed as a session beer. Me, I'd probably have one and move on...worth a try."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The effervescence is played way down, to the point of being a bit boring. It's thin and transparent, and for a winter warmer I'd like it to have more body. Where it lacks in mouthfeel, however, this one's hard to beat in drinkability. The solid, balanced experience is easy to put down without much effort."
"Drinkability: A good winter welcome brew to be had every winter season. Nice wintry feel , not quite sweet enough to make me want more than a couple."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Good balance. Alcohol presence is not obvious, so I wouldn't say it's really a ""warmer"". Comparing to last years version, this one seems to have a little less flavor character but also more bitterness. Drinkability is good, but I would probably only have one in a sitting."
"This beer pours a hazy red color with a big head. The smell is pleasant, and mostly of sweet sticky malts. There is a hint of green apple and other candied fruits as well. In the taste, the malts again dominate with a juicy consistancy. The carbonation is perfect, and lets the malts dance on your tongue a bit before washing down. There is also a suprising amount of variation in the taste for being so malt heavy. The aftertaste lingers with a wonderfully fruity taste. A good one to try."
"The mouth is medium and rather complex, well-carbonated enough to keep this one from getting bogged down in all the sugar and fruitiness, and then it really dries out on the end. It's very drinkable. I've never found this brew to be earth shaking, yet always find it enjoyable."
"it's pretty hoppy for a winter warmer, though the toasty character is nice. not exactly warming, though...more like an ESB"
"Drinkability - seeing that I bought a couple more bottles for the weekend, it is very easy to drink. great beer!"
"Mouthfeel is fine other than the dryness which brings the drinkability down."
"Drink-Ability: A great seasonal beer that I really need to stock up on."
"D- pretty nice, certainly would not object to having a few of these in a night, a good beer, and, in my opinion, a bit underated"
"winter welcome is something to look forward to every year,"
"A solid beer."
"Drinkability - this is very good and very sessionable."
"Classic flavors of an English ale.. smokey, woody, with a distinct hoppyness to it. Some notes of spice and caramel as well. Nice amber color with a beautiful, nearly two-inch cream head. Had a nice earthy character to it, and the flavors seem to be well balanced with the amount of alcohol present. Definitely a winter warmer, as it kept me toasty on a bitter cold day."
"Pours a very clear toasted brown color, with a sticky head that clings to the glass on its way down. Lots of toasty smells on the nose, along with a bunch of yeasty, doughy smells. Rich and inviting, no spice. On the tongue, well balanced, zesty dough notes compete with slightly bitter earthy hops. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and dextrine-ish, with plenty of carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent beer. It's not as spicy as the winter warmers most Americans are used to, but it's highly drinkable and full of nice, grainy, toasty malt flavors."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light, to me, for the style, though it seems appropriate for the flavors that this beer brings to the palate. I like it, but I also look forward to some winter warmers with a bit more spice and a bit more umph."
"Pretty close to an English Pale Ale, with toasty malts and a little bit of hop bitterness. Good overall beer."
"Pours to a light copper color with thin off-white head and moderate lacing. Aroma is not real strong, but has hints of mal and bread. Relatively thin body, with an okay taste of maltwith hints of nuts. Initial palate is the same metallic finish I seem to get with all Samuel Smith beers, but this improves as the beer warms. Not great, but not bad for Samuel Smiths."
"Nice one inch frothy,off-white head. Quickly became a half inch head. MOderately malty aroma with some light bread. Nothing in the way of a hoppy aroma. Light yeast. Not much in th eway of spiceness that I had expected from this style. Noce on the tongue, though. Nothing really special about this beer. It seemed like just a little fuller English ale, really."
"D: I like this beer a bit more than I remember it. Regardless, still a boring beer but well put together."
"Reviewing the 2006-2007 bottle I just got. Pour's a clear coppery brown with a nice head that laced up pretty quick. Smells hint at caramel malts, but not much to it. Taste is metallic and extremely dry. Hints of sweet malts in the taste but again rather lacking. Mouthfeel is extremely dry. Dont reckon I will get this one again with so many other tastier more available winter brews around."
"Pours clear copper with lots of carbonation and a few fingers of nice creamy foam. Smells somewhat lacking; hard water, green leafy hops, a bit of caramel. Flavor is better. Toasted biscuit malts lead to a chewy and nutty rounded caramel center. Finishes with some lingering leafy bitterness and a hint of alcohol warmth. Clean medium body with big carbonation. A little uneven, but pretty pleasing in the end."
"Good English Ale? Yeah...quite possibly. But scored to style....very poor."
"Overall, the best quality of this brew is definitely its balance. It's a bit lacking still in its overall flavor, though. A decent seasonal ale that is definitely worth a try."
"This beer poured a dark gold with a thick, long lasting head. The smell was extremely hoppy. The taste is well balanced between mellow malt and bitter hops. The mouthfeel is full and thick and slightly chewy. I consider this a highly drinkable beer and am glad wintertime is near!"
"Perhaps I should revisit this in a few days, perhaps with a warmer example."
"M/D- Thick and heavy, light carbonation....I feel this beer gets better as you work through the pint...I also noticed that it has gotten a good deal sweeter in the 6 months after the holiday....Great in the winter, but good during all seasons."
"Note: Excellent Shakespeare quote on the bottle: ""Blessing of your heart, you brew good ale."" Ha!"
"It certainly gets better and mellower as it warms, but still, if I'm going for some holiday cheer beer, I can think of a zillion Belgians I'd rather spend time with."
"Taste is very malty and sweet, with some roasted chocolate and baked bread notes. Bit of spice, but definitely nowhere near as 'spicy' as the Celebration. Nice, smooth mouthfeel, but an unexpectedly bitter aftertaste lowers drinkability."
"Mouthfeel- Not bad carbonation helps bring this par beer some points for a renowned brewery."
"Overall an ale that smells like a Winter/X-Mas ale but drinks (and tastes) like a masterfully built pale ale with a ghostly dash of good whiskey somewhere in there. Very subtle but complex. You can ponder or pound this ale, it's very multi-dimensional. Excellent."
"Basically a bold pale ale in strength, spices, and flavor. Still, a bit ordinary. A brilliant and bright copper color with aromas of nuts, nutmeg, caramel, and a light fruitiness. Tastes moderately malty, nutty, spices, and wood-sy. A mild apple and berry tartness persistes in the tastes and feel. Moderate weight and creaminess to the mouth. Finishes clean, dry, and less sweet than was expecting. A moderate alcohol warmth and flavor shows throughout, leaving a light plastic flavor in the aftertaste. Moderate in every sense of the word. Will never offend, but difficult to brag about either."
"D: Quite drinkable, though a bit light in the body for a winter warmer. The aspects that make up the beer are well-interwoven and successfully pulled off, though nothing is, by itself, particularly interesting or defining."
"A very tasty English brew, nice seasonal offering and consistant, year after year."
"D  Very warm and inviting. Perfect for a cold night for sipping and talking. Very enjoyable and satisfying. Definitely a winter ale."
"(This review and beer were sort of a mid-career review for me as I remember drinming this brew back in the early 90's as my beer experimentation began. Looking back my palate has certainly developed and the seach for great beers continues on.)"
"Some fruit..pear perhaps. Quite drinkable."
"Overall, I like this beer way more than I expected to. My favorite from Sam Smith? Maybe."
"If you're looking for a winter-style ale that doesn't overpower, this would be a fine choice."
"This Winterwelcome ale is a decent beer, but it looks very similar to a best bitter on speed. So not a lot more complex, just a couple of pounds of extra malt or sugar. 85 % pale malt, 10% crystal, 5% sugar, something like that. Fermented with a fruity English yeast, finished. This sounds like I cannot appreciate this beer, but actually I like it."
"I don't know if I would have this again (oh wait, I have three left). Maybe I'm ultra sensitive to the off flavors in light struck beers, but I feel the clear bottle did this beer a mis-service. Too bad, I normally really like Sam Smith's offerings. This one is quite average."
"Doverall a pretty good brew, but not something I would seek out. I could have maybe one more."
"Pours a nice copper color with a half-inch light colored foam cap. High clarity. Smell is faint and seems to be just bit hoppy with some carmelly malt aroma. Taste is somewhat sweet and malty, but it rubs me the wrong way, being almost stale or skunky perhaps. Some hop flavor present, but not really bitter. It feels kind of thin and watery on the palate, although carbonation is decent. The off flavors unfortunately made me not want to try this again. I don't know if this one saw too much light somewhere along the way or what, someday I might give it another chance."
"Easily drinkable, I have had a fair share of these over the years. I know it's a winter warmer, but it's no sipping beer. It would actually be a good beer to drink outside on a hot day."
"Poured a warm, clear, reddish amber with a white foamy head that fell to moderate lacing. Smells richly of caramel and malt, a hint of hop freshness present. Tastes sweet, caramel, malt heavier than expected, hint of butterschnapps, butterscotch also present. Medium carbonation, mouthfeel is balanced, a little heavier than expected, carries it's ABV nicely. Overall a pleasing brew, somewhat pricey, but would purchase again. Very drinkable, goes down nice and smooth from start to finish."
"It's so dry. I'm not sure I can really recommend it. It's given me a bit of heartburn. It pains me to say it, but I really didn't enjoy this one. Oh, don't get me wrong, I'll give it a go again next year. I respect the Old Brewery. They know what they're doing. Sigh. Maybe next year."
"D: Drinkability is good. A few of these should warm you up!"
"2005 - 2006 Release: Clear copper color with a minimal off-white head. Aroma of musty grassy hops, nearly skunky, and a metallic cloud hovering beneath. Flavor is pale malt, some light brown sugar and toffee accented with cinnamon and ripe fruits. A grassy hop jumps out of the finish, followed by a fruity tartness that morphs to a lingering syrupy sweetness. There's also the reemergence of the metallic nuance in the lingering flavor. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying."
"Pretty drinkable, especially now when it's -15 degrees out there. No doubt this does exactly what it says it does. Warms you right up."
"Worth a try but nothing I would seek out again. Id hate to try one that was sitting on the shelf next to the lights."
"A pour a nice deep amber to copper color, the head adequate, frothy, the lace a fine covering sheet. Nose is sweet, mostly malt, hints of spice start malt and lightly sweet, top skimp in feel. Finish is moderately carbonated, the hops apropos to the style, quite dry, and a drinkable but not one of my favorites from this World Class brewery."
"Drinkability - decent; could drink another one tonight, but not right after this one"
"Pours out a very clear amber brew with minimal carbonation,,and a 2 finger head. Has a skunky type smell to it,,i cant make out much more. Taste a bit like it smells kinda a lil lile a euro brew at first,not much sweetness. Has some hop goodness towards the end of the sip. Much milder brew then expected,,not bad .Nothing over the top about it but not ba either.i give it a c"
"Overall it is a good english ale, but nothing all that special. it is a little expensive though, but i think it is a good solid beer."
"Drinkablity: This would make a good winter warmer as the style suggests, but I think the assertiveness of the taste may mean that I would prefer something just a little less cloying for any serious amount of imbibing."
"In 2004, I was lucky enough to get a half-price case ($30) of S.S.'s Winter Welcome. It was the first time I had ever tried the beer, and I enjoyed it immensely. I'd love to be able to get that deal again!"
"Overall its easy to drink, tastes and smells pleasant, good session beer, nothing spectacular but a very solid beer."
"Poured a very nice deep copper amber color, very clear and a had a nice off-white tan head that didn't stick around very long but still left a decent lace. The smells were a little sweet, and slightly nutty. I thought the taste was good, but nothing special. There were hints of sweetness and grains and had small hoppiness with no lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Like I said, this is nothing special, and I had difficulty getting any wow-factor from this beer. But still, it's very smooth and drinks well."
"Overall, a pretty damn good beer. I know guys who drink this exclusively while it lasts, buying all they can get. The caramel malt is the main profile, but there is a spicy hop character there as well. Recommended."
"One thing Samuel Smith does well, and one of the high points of this beer, is drinkability. All of there brews are easy to drink and well done for their respective styles and this is no exception."
"Poured a copper color with a huge head and very good lace. Smells are faint but decent - maily hops with some malt mixed in and a touch of apple. taste is again more hoppy than malty, but not overly. Sweet malt and that hint of apple come through at the end. A bit watery and week for a winter warmer IMHO. Nice drinkability though. Give one a try."
"Opinion: Well...this isnt my favorite offering from Sam Smiths line-up. The beer has a good flavor, but in my opinion it is a bit uneventful. Even though it is a malty beer, the hops give it a bit of a harsh edge that didnt totally agree with me. I would drink the beer again, but I am not going to be seeking it out like I do their Oatmeal and Imperial Stouts."
"Found an unopened box at the local so I opened it grab one and took it home made dinner had it while thing were still in the oven. I haven't had one in years as with many of Sam's products due to skunking. Well praise be this one was fresh. A nice oarnge-brown body with a white cap and good lacing. Slight buttery-nutty smell with a hint of caramel twang. Nice average taste of SS beer, full round maltyness cut with the noble hops and metalic zing. Well I can say I will almost never 'buy' one of these again. A shrug of a beer not much of a WW and thin in the mouth."
"I still shake my head every time I see clear bottles, but I'm done trying to figure out why they still use them. Clear copper color. A slight euroskunk aroma as soon as you pop the cap...other than that, it's mostly pale malts and a hint of spices. Tastes are very buttery and diacetyl abounds. Pretty harsh mouthfeel, that makes me want to brush my teeth after every sip. Nothing too impressive here from a brewery that's supposed to have a good reputation. Not one of the better winter ales you can try.. you can get a lot better beers that are a lot less expensive."
"If you are a fan of the distinctive Sam Smith musty smell and flavor, this is a good one. Also, dont expect the spices of other winter brews. I guess what Im saying is- dont expect anything from this one. Nothing special, just an easy drinking English beer."
"Overall, after all the bitching; Nothing but love, Sam Smith's rules!"
"Clear dark gold, almost like a euro dark lager, with minimal head and a faint ring. Smell is spicy, yeasty malt, some butter notes, and the hops are faint. Taste is hampered by a very thin mouthfeel. The spices are there but the brew itself is rather raw, watery and unpleasant. Despite all of this it isn't terrible, just not anything special."
"350 mL clear bottle. Golden amber with slightly off white head. Nose is nothing but minerals. Taste is pleasant, but nothing too special: caramelly malts with slightly bitter hoppiness and something of a honeyed sweet undertone. Easy to drink, but not really the sort of thing I look for in a winter seasonal."
"Mouth feel is on the light side of medium bodied and is mildly carbonated."
"Cheers!"
"Full body. It coats the tongue. You know you're drinking this one. Almost syrupy. A great beer to enjoy in the holiday season."
"Drinkability: Dangerously smooth."
"All in all a drinkable winter brew. Not my favorite, but definitely a Samuel Smith. This is something I'd drink again."
"Sure, its drinkable enough, but all in all a very unstimulating brew."
"Pours a very clear copper. Thin off-white head disappears almost immediately. A full imperial pint of this is pleasing to look at nonetheless. Butterscotch aroma, soft floral hops as well. Biscuity, sweet and earthy. The usual Samuel Smith buttery notes are thrown in. Low bitterness. Finishes dry. Subtle, and easy to quaff. I really expected a bit more. I felt this falls short, especially compared with the other S.S.offerings."
"Drinkability: I must say, this beer is a bit on the bland side and is getting boring rather quickly. I don't think I'll buy it again."
"Pours a clean dark caramel. Active carbonative produces a perfect 2 finger off-white head. Lots of malty sweetness in nose, no hop presence detected. Goes down very smoothly. Very sweet and malty in taste. The maltiness seems to coat your whole mouth as you drink this one down. The sweetness is nicely balanced with some dry hopiness, which give this beer a fairly dry compostition. Overall a very delightful, pleasent brew. A very nice way to enjoy the winter season and holidays with this seasonal brew."
"Very nice coppery color. Good head and decent carbonation level. Low aroma-somewhat metallic and slightly ""skunked"". Flavor is of malt with a mellow hop bitterness. Nice trace of caramel. Has a nice dry though lingering sweet finish. Decent enough body. Overall a nice beer. Can be quite lackluster at times. Have always thought it could use a slight kick in the pants to boost its overall profile. Still, a decent British brew to look forward to every year."
"Winter warmer? Not sure what this is, but it is enjoyable. However, there is a strange aftertaste or lingering bitterness that is less than pleasant, bringing down the taste and overall drinkability. But this is slight. This is a very satisfying, very well-balanced beer."
"cheers..."
"Shared the bottle with a friend. Nice light amber color, looks good. Tasted as bad as it smelled. overwhelming odor of vinegar. Decent thickness but the more I sipped the more the vinegar taste built up in my mouth. I could not drink it. Maybe I just got a bad bottle. Is 'blech' an acceptable review word?"
"The mouthfeel could not be better, thick and full but eminently drinkable. This is complex enough to stop and think about, yet smooth enough to sessionize, and what a jolly session that might be. The consistency of bottle to bottle is fantastic; there are never disappointments. Each sip leaves you wanting more. Truly one of the finest winter seasonals, and a stand-out among a terrific product line."
" Overall, a bit disappointing, I'd like to see some more character..this one is more anonymous than I'd like."
"Taste good, snappy, dry finish, and slight warming to follow. I've been a fan of Samuel Smith beers since my first encounter and this one is no exception. Not the best of the Sam Smiths i've had, but a good winter beer indeed."
"The only good thing about this beer was its appearance. A tea looking apearance with a great head and tremendous lacing. One single fissure of bubbles erupts from the center of the glass; pretty cool looking. I always finish a beer, no matter how bad, but this one may take a while."
"It pours a dull amber color with a sizeable frothy head that holds with some nice lacing. The smell is dominated by a sweetness probably from apples with some hops and bitterness that can be detected. The taste has some decent bitterness. The flavor really comes out as the beer warms. It has some good thickness but the carbonation is a little strong. This is a good solid winter ale"
"A nice looking beer, subdued amber and ruby tones capped by a healthy white head and filled with lots of carbonation bubbles constantly rushing towards the surface. Smell was O.K. with an emphasis and fruity tones, less spicy scent than many others in the type. Taste was pleasant , if not outstanding, with noticeable alcoholic feel in the mouth despite a modest 6 percent. Still maintains a certain smoothness and drinkability despite the somewhat sharp mouthfeel. Overall a solid winter warmer, but I honestly expected a bit more after trying Sam Smith's stouts and porters which are top notch."
"Meh. I don't honestly know what I expected. I mean, Sammy Smith has always let me down in the past but. . . but . . . people always say it's so good. . . clearly I'm missing something here, I just don't get it. I mean, this isn't a bad beer, it's merely 'unimpressive'. I mean, there was maybe a hint of spice coupled with an average ale flavour. I guess, I mean, what's the deal? This is just your run of the mill beer. Granted, I had just finished a Grolsch, so that may have destroyed my taste buds. HAHAHHAHAHAHA. No, seriously, what up? This beer has less flavour than Grolsch. Don't get me wrong, I love Grolsch, but it ain't renowned for its exteme flavour. What's up?"
"I could drink a lot of this if ever presented with the opportunity, that's for sure. Quite good."
"This was a 550 ml bottle.Poured a nice clear amber color , with a frothy off white head that diminished quickly.Lacing was right on par with the head. It seemed to be lightly hopped ,and the malt was caramel sweet,and even a slight hint of butterscotch.Initiall sweetness finished with a light bitterness, good balance in my opinion.Did not meet my idea of a winter warmer though,but still a pleasant enough brew, despite the risk of that clear bottle.Would definitely try this one again"
"Overall: Better than I'd remembered it actually. Don't know if the batch I got last year was a bit light-struk or what. Nothing wrong with this bottle."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable. Not so heavy you could not drink more. Not so alcoholic you would make an ass of yourself in front of the family after consuming a four pack."
"Poured out of a bomber into a pint glass, this beer appears a reddish orange color. It has a very small head. The smell is a bit overpowering. The taste is fairly bitter with the alcohol peeping through. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both average. This would not be on top of my list but is probably worthy of trying again sometime."
"Smooth mouth with enough carbonation to give it balance. Very drinkable. Not spicy like other winter warmers, but I like it."
"Pours out to a clear amber, forming a sticky khaki head of very fine meringue bubbles. The retention is excellent. Carbonation is moderate. There is something oddly appealing about the aroma....skunky Heineken, and caramel sweet malt, overpowering the fusels and butterscotch you will typically smell had there been no skunk. As it warms, vanilla becomes apparent, the hops blossom with a minty character and grainy, toasty malt appears. Swirling stirs up the butterscotch. There is no doubt when you open a Sam Smith ale..you can smell that notorious nose across the room. The mouthfeel is slick yet oily with a medium body and oxidized, soapy finish. The taste is of course very English with plenty of butterscotch (but not overwhelming as the skunk balances it out)...lingering caramel balancing out the medium strong herbaceous and woodsy bitterness. Alcohol is imperceptable. There is a semi-ruddy cardboard finish and aluminum or copper in the aftertaste. This really isn't a great beer in the strict flavor sense (it's quite average by all marks), yet despite it's faults, Sam Smith of any type is intriguing and appealing for it's nostalgia alone which makes it an absolutely divine pleasure. Maybe it's the gold foil, maybe it's that unique bottle (bottled at yorkshire's oldest brewery est1758). It's about as ""beer"" as beer can get, and lazily transports me to the seat of an English pub in the early 1800's. Recommended. Best enjoyed cold (~45F) as it gets soapier when it warms."
"edit: sitting here letting the beer warm....I have to say that the sweetness is not as overbearing as I thought that it was....this is not bad brew at all...."
"12 oz bottle from 2005-2006, first I've ever seen of this Sam Smith offering. Pours a bright clear copper with 2 fingers of dense beige head, but not very good retention or lacing. Smell is very malty, not very sweet, with just a slight roasted edge. Taste is the malt from the nose intermingled with hints of wood, mineral water, and a slight butteriness. Slight bitterness on the finish suggests hops, but nothing really comes through in the taste. Medium/thin bodied with fairly low carbonation, this is a pretty easy drinker. I have pretty limited exposure to the style and was expecting something much spicier, but I must say I did enjoy this beer and might pick up another pack before the season ends."
"Drinkability: I've got to say, I'm dissapointed. Not a beer I can imagine curling up to fire with. Average brew here all the way. I would be happy to quaff a couple pints of this, but don't see myself ever going out of the way to purchase this again for a while."
"This years rendition is a subdued eliteration from last years offering, or my taste buds are on holiday. Nice and inviting, and satisfying to a point, but not all that it could be."
"Taste is slightly citric with a sharp hop bite. Not a growling in your face hop presence, but a sharp defined existence. Toasted hops lend balance to the equation. Slightly embittering aftertaste. Mouthfeel is coarse and dry. Not a bad beer that achieves exactly what it intends to do, warm your cold ass on a winter day."
"I liked this beer but for me its not really a dead of winter beer, more a cold ,wet Autumn one."
"I wish SS would stop using clear bottles. I was worrying this would be skunked."
"Pours a copper color, not much carbonation, small head, nice lacing throughout. Scents of malt and slight sweet caramel. Not a bad taste, kinda sweet/bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable. Why does Samuel Smith bottle in clear bottles is beyond me. Not really sure if I would recommend this brew though."
"I am guessing this might have been skunked from the other reviews. The clear bottle likely. Although I have never taken it outside in the day. Even if skunked, this beer should not have scored this low if it was good in the first place. I strongly suggest that Samuel Smith's put this in a brown or opaque bottle. I will not try it again and my review stands (since I definitely didn't skunk it) until they do. I shall assume this is simply a poor quality brew."
"Cheers!"
"Poured from a 550cl bottle into a 500cl stein, copper color with large start head and good retention. The bouquet is salty and sweet with notes of salted beef gravy and caramel. Flavors start with whole-grain bread, then light toffee, and finishing with a sharp, slightly metallic, dryness. Overall the taste is slightly thin. It is probably a good accompaniment to the savory fruit cakes and mince-pies the British enjoy at Christmas. Despite the mildly thin taste, the beer feels very big and chewy, though the metallic finish compromises its drinkability a bit."
"Overall - An very good beer... extremely drinkable.... recommended..."
"D- This beer is light and refreshing and not what I was expecting. I thought it would be more of a barley wine when it is in fact has more qualities of a pale ale. Interesting beer just not what I expected."
"the carbonation and dry finish are a bit over the top in my opinion but I was really surprised to have a beer from england taste this yeast driven. Sweet/spicey candied brew and a big malt and slight hop support system. Real nice beer...I could easily see drinking the four pack in a sitting if need be of course. thanks for saving the day Old Brewery Tadcaster. This drink is for the OBT...."
"Drinkability: Absolutely top notch beer. Can't wait for this year's edition."
"Very drinkable and an excellent fall/winter refresher. Should be very nice after raking leaves or shoveling snow or just for relaxation."
"Drinkability goes up for a year ""fresher"" vintage."
"For the '09-'10 vintage: I got a finger-and-a-half of eggnog-yellow head with good retention from my pour. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was warmingly malty-sweet with notes of caramel, molasses and anise. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with a great mix of malty flavors plus the unique yeast strain that plays through all of their beers. It is like that note in a jazz piece that you can hear above everything else. Finish had the caramel up front with the anise bite lingering at the extreme finish. Yum!"
"Its getting late in the season (2004-2005), but this one still poured well, nice lite amber brown with smallish tan head. Enticing butterscotch, spice and malt aroma that tasted just as well. Alcohol was covered by the malt that finished with a balanced hop. Too bad we only had one 550ml bottle to work on, this one could be drank all evening long. Another tasty treat from Sammy."
"Pours a solid fluffy head that sustains decently. Color is lighter for a winter seasonal, rather pale actually. Initial smell was who let Peppy LePew into the room? Peppy actually went away pretty quickly and what was left was an unremarkable hint of biscuity grain and a very slight hint of holiday spice. Taste is somewhat complex. The first taste left a heavy impression of the presence of figs or prunes. Subsequent sips left the impression that there are a lot more hops present than what your typical winter beer has. Mouthfeel is decently full but not particularly lively. Overall this is a decent winter beer but it is pretty tough to top DeSchutes, Sierra Nevada, and Widmer Bros (This Year) for a winter welcome style of brew."
"Winter Welcome is a strange brew. I've already alluded to the bottom line: it drinks like a sweeter, less hoppy pale ale and is pretty tasty, all things considered. I don't know that I'll buy it too often because the clear glass makes each purchase a Russian Roulette of sorts. Samuel Smith has brewed a damn fine beer here. Why the powers that be insist on leaving it vulnerable to the depredations of UV light is beyond me."
"Pours an attractive clear amber but with a small white head that quickly recedes, leaving sparce lacing. Smells suprisingly similar to a pilsner, strong on the apples and kiwis and an underlying cherry. Tastes of apples, grassy and citrus hops, malty grains, not very interesting. Finishes dry, lingering bitterness."
"I'm honestly not at all sure what to make of this beer. I have no idea what style it is, but at the same time, I like the way it tastes. Will everyone? I doubt it; it's definitely not the syrupy, spicy mouthful o' malt you might expect from a winter warmer. A curiosity, but--IMHO--a tasty one."
"2004-2005. This brew is a darker brown/amber color, with a fairly small bubbly tan head. The scent has buttery elements, light malt, some fruity tones. A generous caramel malt front kicks things off, some buttery tones, bits of apple, underlying hop bitterness. Some spice as well. Overall a good beer, but faced with other winter offerings i might look at something else."
"A bit of buttery feel on the tongue, the bread flavors seems to last on the tongue after swallowing. Not a bad drinking brew, but I expected a bit more spice or ""winter"" tones.Not a bad brew."
"This is a good beer, and I thought SS used something in their clear bottles to prevent oxidation and problems with light. I'll try it again next year and hopefully have better luck."
"Pours a medium golden with solid red highlights (against a light) with a huge fluffy head. Aroma is very familiar, but hard to place- something along the lines of anise, licorice, and peppermint. Flavor is standard malty beer with slight hops bite, and a spicy flavor on top. Nice flavor, but this isn't generally my style, so it's hard to get my arms around it to embrace it."
"2004/2005 edition. 550 mL clear bottle with no best before date."
"Drinkability: This ale is obviously skunked, likely a result of its coming in a clear bottle. I did not bother finishing the bottle. Think I am giving up on Sam Smith until the quit their clear bottle marketing."
"Suggest you try one but don't expect too much."
"poured a clear caramel, bit of foamy head that dissipated, but left a slight collar, smell was a bit skunky, (wonder if I got a bad one?), can't really distiguish anything else because of the skunked aroma taste was again skunked up,I taste a bit of tea, this one must have been light struck, if it is supposed to taste like this, then I can't really give it a good review, Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, drinkability, not good judging by this example, I'll have to try this again."
"This one always seems to be at my house in the winter, so i'll take a moment to write a review. Pours a nice burnt amber with a creamy, albeit thin, white head which quickly recedes to provide a nice lacing. Smell is of biscuity malt and slight notes of spices. Taste has that Sam Smith calling card, is it the fermenting squares??? Spices, sweet malts, and bready malts sit atop of that distinct Sam Smith earthiness. Very drinkable but I believe that I prefer their pale ale to this. Easy intro to winter seasoned beers."
"2004-2005 edition. Winter Welcome is amber in color with an ample, lightly creamy head. The smell is lightly sweet with a tiny hint of hops. Taste is subtlely sweet and malty. Hop flavor is also very subtle. The finish has a nice drying effect. Overall I'd say this is a solid, but fairly plain beer. A winter warmer should be a little bolder and bigger. I probably won't be picking this up next winter, to me it just doesn't seem to be worth the money."
"I liked this beer a lot. Poured it into a pint glass, a nice orange reddish color with just a lace head around the circumference of the glass. The smell is sweet with nice hoppy notes. The taste has an initial sweetness followed by nice hops and some very faint malt. The mouthfeel is nice and chewy. This is great beer for the winter months, I reminds me a lot of sierra nevada pale ale."
"Good, solid beer. Not as good as other Samuel Smith's though. Still, it's always good to have a couple around the winter time."
"Altogether, a very interesting brew. Not the most drinkable so much going on in terms of the flavor that one pint would do me good. But definitely unique. Noted that as I drank more, the flavor soured quite a bit, leading me to lower my initial scores on taste and drinkability."
"Drinkability- This has always been on of my favorites. I love just about everything from Samuel Smith. I will always have a few of these each holiday season."
"This beer was very similar to the Sam Smith India Ale. The beer pours to a beautiful amber color with a decent tan head. Smells of hops and caramel with a hint of fruity aroma. This was one beer that left me craving for more, but I ended up having to settle for the IPA I mentioned above, which will have to substitute for the Winter Welcome during the off-season. Exceptional beer."
"Pours a copper colored with a off white head falls and laces so slightly. Aroma is light toasted malt with nut tones some spice mixed with fruit. Taste is fully carbonated almost to a fault, needs to cut back on CO2 a tad. Some toasted malt mixed with nuts and touch of caramel finishes with touch of spice nutmeg and hints of vanilla little hops in finish also but mostly spice. Mouthfeel is too carbonated and a little thin. Drinakability is ok but nothing to look for, a little light in my opinion for a winter warmer."
"Clear bottle of the 2004-2005 vintage. This brew presents itself in a beautiful light-copper color with a terrific head: firm, white, and clumpy. The smell is primarily of lightly toasted malt, with a woody-winy character, and a touch of English hops. Slight butterscotch. A bit of sulfur is present as well (a little lightstruck?). The taste is fairly dry, with a light-malt tastiness flowing through. Its both nutty and astringent. The beer is somewhat heavily carbonated. Finish is dry and clean, with a moderate bitterness. Overall, this is a solid, good brew. I wouldnt mind having it year-round."
"Pours amber with a yellowish-white foamy head that dissolves rather fast. Aroma of malt and bit of bread, not too much smell compared to other Sam Smith ales. Taste was a bitter toffee malt with a moderately long hoppy bitter finish, a bit of warming alcohol entered as it warmed. Mouthfeel was medium, definitely full bodied. This is not a style I am too familiar with, but the other WW I tried was definitely better scoring."
"As a winter warmer, this was pretty disappointing. Definitely not one of sam smith's better beers. Body was clear, amber colour. White head, foamy. Lacing was minimal. Taste was malt, caramel, metallic. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side. However, a decent ale to knock back a few."
"2004-2005 clear bottles always scare me but I wanted to try it. Poured a nice coppery clear with little head. I even poured down the middle of the glass. The initial smell was kind of bland and bitter, however the taste was a little better than bland, however still a little on the bitter/sour side. I can pick out a small hint of hops and a little caramel. I expected a little more spice for a winter warmer. I am not to impressed however this does have a nice thick/full mouthfeel good thing I only picked up one bottle."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"2004-2005 Love the Samuel Smith bottles, cool shape. Too bad they're clear. Somebody has to be able to develop a glass that's cheap and doesn't let in UV light. Hmm..off to make my fortune :-) Light amber beer, about an inch of white head. Lots of bubbles. Wasn't crazy about the smell at first, but it grew on me as I drank it, I guess it needed to air out, very floral. The hops really come through on this, but they aren't offensive at all, just very dry, not very sweet. Feels thin in the mouth, not a whole lot of substance. Ok beer, if you can get it fresh, nothing really exciting, though."
"Middling carbonation; creamy consistency."
"Saw the Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome announcement in an ad today in All About Beer Magazine and thought I'd try it out. Liked the updated label each year with the dates of the winter season. The clear glass bottle doesn't do anything for me but did not worry about the skunking process. Really beginning to enjoy the winter warmers but this is still not as good as Sam Adams or Avery's. Nice mouthfeel (but nothing too impressive for the style). A bit on the expensive side at the store ($8.00 for 4-12 ounces). Probably will try others instead the rest of the season and pass on this purchase again."
"I would like to find this on tap this winter. Not bad at all."
"Drinkablity is fine, but not great, not so good I would want to sit and drink a bunch of these."
"All in all it went pretty well with my ice cream birthday cake."
"Ooh, a delicious beer. Pours a lovely, transparent amber with a thich, two finger head that's sticky as Scotch tape. Lace sticks around like foam. Nice. Smells a bit skunked at first. But that weakened a bit. Nice, bready malts, herbal hops, and some minerals. Very soft scent. Very soft taste as well. Overall, a soft, bready malt flavour balanced by bitter minerals and sharp, citric and floral hops. Mouthfeel is nice and dry. Very drinkable. I like it."
"Very dissapointed, don't think the clear bottle lasted the trip. Pours a nice dark honey with streaks of cherry wood, the head is like whipped cream. The smell was of cinnamon and nutmeg with almond finish, nuts galore. The taste was very robust with dry nuts and a dark toffee tingle, taste seemed dull and metallic, medium bodied, pour clear bottle ruined this one."
"This is a really good ale that seems like more of a bitter than a winter warmer. Its well balanced and quite robust in flavor."
"I picked up 550 of this from my local beer stop, happy to see a seasonal or two at old Harry Food. As always Im frightened by the clear bottle (for good reason this time). Upon opening my senses were assaulted by some of the most potent skunk Ive experienced to date so I poured it and let it air out a bit. I have to say though it really is an attractive brew, crystal clear copper colored body with a light tan head that is thick and resilient, leaving sheets of lace on the glass as it recedes. After it airs out a bit I do detect some sweet malt and leafy, earthy hop underneath the prevailing skunk. As I take a drink I pick up on the creamy, almost buttery malt flavors, the middle presents a nice, robust, flat bitterness, with tiny hints of rum and raison. Nicely bitter through the finish with a smattering of earthy flavor and sweet hints of rum in the aftertaste. Not a bad beer, but I will be the millionth person to complain about the packaging."
"This one pours with a huge foamy head and leaves a nice thick lacing. Smell is a bit off however. A nice malty buttery smell with some herby hobs to compliment, but it also smells a tad like metal or dirt or something. Taste is rather similar. Not a lot of flavor to this beer in my opinion. I did drink it out of a chilled beer mug, which is all that was available, and I would recommend letting it warm up a bit to let the flavors come out. A nice bitterness is this beer's best quality. Very smooth mouthfeel and this beer is pretty light and easy to drink."
"1/2 liter clear bottle...2004-05 edition. Nice looking ale in the glass...bright orange amber, lightly cabonated...fair foamy cap that laces well. Aromas of friuts (peach -pear) and fresh cut wood, caramel malts, leafy hops . Creamy body well hopped with the substantial caramel malts in fair balance... medium finish with slow but not over bearing bittering and some warming effect...A nice well rounded ale with no sharp edges...A pleasant drink"
"From the trepidation inducing clear glass 550 ml. bottle to the pint glass, the beer looked orange, clear, and possessed a modest sized, short lived head. The aroma was slightly spicy along with perfumey floral scents, and thankfully no skunk. The taste showed typical English beer restraint, and tasted very balanced. There was a buttery, salty, caramelized malt flavor similar to a hard butterscotch candy. The level of hops was high for an offering from across the pond, however the hops were mostly of the aromatic variety with low bitterness. The beer was creamy on the palette with a slightly dry aftertaste. Astonishingly drinkable for a 6% ABV beer, as the alcohol is very well hidden. This does not have the oomph of the other winter warmers, I can find off the shelves, but is a quality beer nonetheless."
"A pleasant ale, but not much flash. Too bland for me to have another pint. Slightly disappointing; one of my least favorites from Sammy Smith."
"I love Samuel Smith's, but this offering was a slight let down. This is a good beer... no question, but at $8.99 for a 4 pack there are many other Samuel Smith's offerings that are much more enjoyable."
"A very nice beer, which I think of as more of a stronger version of their excellent Old Brewery Pale Ale, than as an extra strong winter beer. I've tried aging it in the past, and found that it's best when fresh."
"This year's bottle art features carolers as the theme."
"Came in a clear bottle - that always worries me. Pours an amber color with a small head that mostly dies off. Leaves very little lacing on the glass. Aroma is malty with some hop notes, but there are some spices in there as well. The flavor is very well rounded. Nice caramel maltiness with a balanced hop character and a tiny bit of spiciness just for fun. Could have a little more body, but a pretty decent beer."
"The beer pours a golden amber color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is nicely hopped with a sweet caramel background. The flavor is very caramel, with some sweet hops that hit towards the end of the swallow. The flavor is a bit thin though. The feel is just a light moderate beer, not as thick as I would expect. Drinkability is high, as this beer leaves my glass quickly."
" Pours out with a thick foamy head & a toffy/caramel color, transparent as can be. Initial smell was faint of hops & something I couldn't quite put my finger on; smelt like tasty beer to me. It tastes balanced, but somewhat skunked by their trakemark clear bottles - don't get me wrong, I like it, but something is just a little off. Mouthfeel is just about right for me: smooth, but lets you know it has carbonation with tiny bubbles crossing your tongue, if you leave it there long enough. Drinkability is where most Sammy Smith's have their downfall (IMHO); that is why, I believe, they come in 550mL bottles, or 4 packs of 12oz bottles. I could have a couple of pints, or 12 oz. bottles at the most of this stuff at a time, then move on to a Taddy Porter, or Oatmeal Stout."
"I wanted to give this brew a better rating (although what I gave isn't all that bad) because I enjoy this seasonal offering. But between the smell and the somewhat bitter aftertaste I couldn't in good conscience do it."
"I could drink a couple...quite nice."
"In the flavor I get a definate malty flavor along with honey, citrus, and a bit og a metallic flavor. The glass I am drinking it from is a pint glass I use for man beers and is thouroughly cleaned each time, so I don't think the metallic taste comes from the glass. It is also a bit sour in flavor."
"Very colorful label with a scene of a sleigh trudging through deep powder in the middle of winter. This is the 2003-2004 version which pours an amber brew with a white head that sticks around nicely. Aroma has that distinct english mineral character and some sweet malts but no spices to be detected. Taste is very enjoyable as there is a clean herbal hop bitterness balanced with a slightly sweet malt flavor that segues into a clean, dry finish. The mouthfeel is smooth but lively as there is an average level of carbonation. Very nice ale to sip by the fireside in a cabin during winter though it makes a medicore session beer."
"Price: $1.99 for a 12oz bottle"
"Sweet up front that is instantly followed by a nice kick of herbal hops. Usually not a hops fan, but this is so well balanced that I can't complain."
"Small white head on this one. Malt aroma but there is something odd about it. Luckluster taste that leave me waiting for something that never arrives. I was expecting alot more because of the style. Malt is present, yet far too subdued. Sames goes for the hops. Great balance. After taste is slightly bready. Heavyer mouthfeel than the taste would let you believe. Drinkable."
"It has a really slippery taste, similar to a traditional pale ale. The overall taste really isn't very impressive. The smell is pretty off and that really takes away from the beer overall. It stays fairly drinkable through a light mouthfeel."
"The taste is very strong as well starting with an initial maltiness followed by a carmel and fig taste. It then surprised me by finishing with a slight bite of hops and sort of dry. It was just right. I couldnt detect the alc. even though its 6% ABV. A very smooth beer."
"My second Samuel Smith offering... second one today I might add. Pours a clear amber with a foamy white head that barley lasts, but leaving nice thick and creamy lacing down the glass. The smell is of raisins, figs, other dark fruits, caramel, bready, biscuits with slight herbal hops. The taste is sweet maltiness, caramel, buttery and super smooth. What is it that makes English brews so F***ing smooth and drinkable, even after traveling across the pond? There is a slight hop kick at the end just to add a nice bitterness to the aftertaste as well. Although this is listed as a ""winter"" seasonal, I believe I could really drink this on a regular basis. Another fine sampling from Samuel Smith's (even in the clear bottles it still tastes fresh). Maybe someday I'll get a chance to sample true English Ale on tap (cask)... maybe."
"I was kind of dreading this beer. I don't know why but it has been in the back of the fridge for months now but suprisingly, it's pretty tasty. Just plain, smooth malty goodness with fruits, toffee and caramel. This is way way way good. A great one to start the everning with."
"A very very good standard winter beer, not too intense in any way, very clean, but just GOOD in capital letters."
"Hey Sam: throw away the clear bottle. You have a good beer here."
"Notes: Very nice for the winter, the alcohol taste ruined the aftertaste a bit though."
"Bottle  Poured a brown colored brew with a medium head with equally medium retention. Aroma of hops with light floral and sweet aspect to it is quite pleasant. Taste is very enjoyable with a good mix of hops and malts. A bit thin on spice with a medium body. Overall, I enjoyed this beer but would have appreciated a bit more hops or spice to make it truly great."
"A very fine winter offering and another reason why some of my favorite brews come from Samuel Smith."
"IMHO: This is a fair light ale, but does not seem to be much of a winter warmer. I had a couple of these earlier in the season and they seemed a little fresher."
"I am going to have trouble finishing this."
"Very drinkable, for the money though I would buy the Oatmeal Stout."
"I reviewed this beer one year ago where I gave an overall score of 2.4 because the beer had skunked. Obviously, this time around I am reviewing a fresh bottle. The dramatic rating change reflects that this beer truly is superior when consumed promptly after the case is opened (and then exposed to the light). As long as Samuel Smith's insists on putting their beer in clear glass bottles, I shall remain wary of purchasing it. All I can say is ask the bartender or retail clerk when the beer arrived to protect your purchase. Seek this beer out...if it is fresh!"
"I've really quite enjoyed a number of other Samuel Smith beers, but this one just isn't quite in the same league as some of the others although it is certainly decent enough in and of itself."
"A copper-orange color with a nice head and beautiful lacing along the sides of the glass. The smell was a mix of hops, nut, and a citrus or fruityness. Taste was a good blend of hops and a smooth nutty taste. The fruit taste makes it way into the beer towards the end and the aftertaste is nice flavor of not too overpowering hops. I liked the charachter of this beer and the way everything seemed to fit together. A diffeerent winter beer than I'm used to but nonetheless very good."
"Poured a nice deep copper colour with a moderate head that didn't want to last all that long. The scent was bready with a nuttiness to it. The taste was also very bready. It had a very strong pressence of nuts. Almost like a nut brown ale. sweet and easy to drink. There was a slight hint of hops, but not too much."
"Winter Welcome 03 - Large frothy off white head that becomes rocky and piles above the rim. The head lasts a long time and becomes a thick frothy lace. Color is a clear copper. Nice appearance. Aroma is of subdued grainy malts and a hops that stands out but seems a bit different to me. The mouth feel is a bit on the light side. Slightly malty start, but not very sweet. Fairly well hopped brew that becomes evident shortly after the start. Hops are pretty well pronounced, fade in the finish, but dont disappear completely. The malt becomes a bit more noticeable and a slight bit more sweet as the brew warms. This is an okay brew, but I dont know if I enjoyed it enough to want more then one or two. Didn't seem very complex. Seemed like a pale ale that left me pretty unimpressed."
"It didn't strike me as being particularly wintry, like some offerings that have spices, or higher ABVs. However, this struck as the kind of beer the macros wished they could make. It'd be a good intro to better beers for a macro drinker, for sure!"
"Light orangey-yellow. Or maybe yellowy orange. Crisp and dry in taste. The malt is understated, but it still provides a good balance to the hop finish. I had a bottle that tasted better a couple months ago. This one was good anyway. I like this as a winter beer."
"Thre's nothing remarkable here, but it is somewhat north of just OK. The singular off-putting quality was well bested by mostly full and diverse characteristics. It's nice enough, but not as big and bold as you might expect from a seasonal Winter brew. Still, if you get past the seasonal aspect, it's flavorful and enjoyable enough to drink a few, not matter what time of year."
"Its like beer jell-o to me - I could make myself very sick if this beer wasn't prohibitively priced. Lovely."
"It was ""Just OK"""
"paid $2.99 for the pint bottle"
"Pours a peachy-orange with a nice two-fingered head. Aroma seemed a bit skunky at first (not surprising, given the clear bottling), but also slighly hoppy and had sweet maltiness. Fairly smooth, but dry mouthfeel. Sweet maltiness, with a fairly drying hops presence. A little candied fruitiness. Also, there is some alcohol present. Overall, not a bad brew. I don't know that I'd call it a winter beer, although it does have a bit of a warming feeling. Still, certainly not a waste of money."
"As Winter Ales go, this was a disappointment. It is okay to look at although even the appearance seems weak by comparison. It does have a good white head with considerable lacing. It smells of hops and other grains with some hints of sweetness. The taste is a hoppy blend of grains, but there is an acidic undertone that gave it a funny feeling in the mouth. It seemed to be slightly oily. I couldn't drink a whole lot of these. I expect more from a brewer like Samuel Smith."
"Surprisingly mild. Samuel Smith's brews generally have much more character and texture to them. The aroma was gentle, with a delicate head. The flavor was slightly fruity and smooth. Had I not opened the bottle myself, I would've been surprised to learn that it was a Samuel Smith. Welcoming a mild Winter."
"Ive always loved all Sammy Smith brews but this was threw me for a curve."
"I must say I always wanted to try this beer because of the label on the bottle."
"Many winters ago I bar I used to go to sold these at the cut rate of $3 a bottle. The size of the bottle and cheap price seemed to attract quite a range of drinkers. It was quite amusing to see many Miller and Bud drinkers quaffing an English beer just because it was cheap and came in a big bottle!"
"This wasn't too bad of a brew in my book. It was a kind of orangey/light red color with an off white head. The head wasn't spectacular or anything, but stayed around a little. You could tell that it was carbonated though. The smell was a little on the spicey side with hints of fruits. The taste was similar to the smell, but more along the spicey side, with hops and different winter spices used. It was alittle too hoppy for me, so I'll stick with my malts. If you are a fan of the hops, go for it."
"Pours a nice dark orange color. Nice bit of head, some lacing don at the end. However, with what people have proclaimed of this beer, i am not impressed. I am going to have to get some more (3 tries thus far), but this just ain't cutting it. Has not very citrus/hop taste, not very malt taste, just a general bitter flavor to it. It didn't smeel mich like anything, and in all honstly, that prob helped it. I hope the boys over at SS do better, becuase I am used to a higher standard from them, and this doesn't cut it!"
"Pale orange color and a small head with some lacing. Not much of a smell but some light buttery notes. Taste was straight forward with good balance but nothing really lumped out at me. Was really expecting something spicy and bold from a good brewery like SS, but was left feeling flat. I will save the rest of the 4 pack for my macro drinking guests who feel adventures this Christmas."
"And a Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, if not particularly memorable."
"A very good brew from Samuel Smith's - while not as warming as other winter brews, the Winter Welcome Ale is definitely an enjoyable entry. A good deal better on the warm side, this ale is not a flavor monster, but a well made beer nonetheless. Well-balanced, with a definite bite to it make it a great ""feel good"" session beer for those long winter nights."
"amber brown color, with good head and some lacing. Smell of alcohol in original review, getting more barleywine aroma 3.5 years later. Warms you up, in the winter. Malt sweetness, some apple fruit and mild spice. Hops and carbonation abundant that tingles tongue. had a second bottle two years later that went very well with sushi because of mild astringency. Bottle 3.5 years later hops in finish carbonation just right cellaring for nine months.Medium mouthfeel."
"Pours a deep, clear amber with a thick, bubbly white head supported by significant carbonation. The smell was of subtle hops dominated by a sharp ginger tanginess. The mouthfeel was light and sparkling, but the taste is rather disappointing; nothing much stands out--a dull metallic undertone, certainly a little buttery malts. OK."
"Pours with an ample and fluffy white head settling over clear light, light reddish liquid. There was a whiff of skunkiness when I first stuck my schnozz in the glass that seemed to dissipate once things settled down...slightly. Otherwise, some light butterscotch/diacetyl and light maltiness is present with some delicate hop aroma. The taste features light/medium mouthfeel, subtle fruitiness and a nice, slightly metallic hop note, fading into a somewhat dryish and bitter finish. A quality brew that's a fine example of what holiday beers used to be like before the advent of more aggressively flavored microbrewed examples became the norm."
"Part #3 of the 12/8 Hebrew Hammer Holiday Threeway"
"This may have well been the beer that made me into a craft beer lover...the first great beer that I'd had, and what led me to seek out other beers. That said, now that I've had plenty of better beers, this isn't quite as good as I remember. Still, I'll always have to thank Sam Smith for leading me on the path to beer redepmption, and as such, I'll likely have this one in years to come."
"2004 batch. More of a winter warmer than last year's. Malty aroma and a light fruitiness. A whole-hearted improvement on last year's batch, which I recall weighing in at 4.9%. I had to up a couple of stats to average it out. Me likey."
"2003-04 vintage 550ml bottle purchased at Huckleberry's for $2.99. Poured a golden amber color, with a big fluffy white head. Nice sheets of lacing are left with each tilt of the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts and pine needles, with the malts being the dominant partners. The taste starts out as sweet maltiness, then theres a piney, hoopy taste and the finish is pleasingly dry. This is by far the least hoppy winter beer I've had. While it will probably disappoint hopheads, I think the balance is nice, and makes a nice change of pace from many of the winter beers I've had where the hops are hugely dominant."
"-Oelergud"
"The Winter Welcome Ale poured copper with lots off lively carbonation that resulted in a thick white head that was fairly creamy and retained well. The aroma was kind of piney, bready, alcoholic smell with some metallic and skunky tones. The taste was sweet, bready malts initially with a hoppy finish. A very smooth drinking beer but not nearly as much flavor as I would expect from a winter brew."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy orangeish-brown color with half a finger head. There is a little lacing left on the glass. The smell is a good blend of malt and hops, sweet with caramel, but with some hop bitterness. The taste is malty and a little tart at first. Bits of caramel, toffee, and bread in there. A good dose of hops on the finish. The body is fairly thick and strong. The drinkability is also fairly good. A pretty nice winter brew."
"Sammy Smith creates some of my favorite brews, especially their Imperial Stout. I only tried this one once before last February and I didn't like it that much, but I figured I'd give it another shot. Paid $3 for the 550ml bottle. Poured a clear amber into my glass with a white foamy head. It lingered for a little bit then settled with little lacing. Smelled sweet and of roasted malts. Taste the same. A sweet ale with a heavy malt taste. I did enjoy it more this time around. 6% abv means drink it up fellas! As for myself, it is rather dry to drink often."
"Bright amber/glowing orange in color-sports an ample, creamy top and lace that can be brought to head with a bit of swirling. Aromatics feature fruity malt that borders on slightly sweet. In the mouth, the beer is crisp and clean. Flavors lean towards the bitter-sweet side and favor toasty malt. Fruity hops keep a fine balance and linger, while sweet bisquit like flavors add complexity. The beer finishes with a touch of sweet malt and a mild hop twang. Good, yet not an awe-inspiring brew."
"As I stated, I do drink several of these each year. I don't have to drink the best at all times, and with this one, I don't. But it is a pleasant ""eternal-return," albeit a too-expensive one."
"For a Strong Ale is is amazingly smooth and creamy. Tremendously drinkable and very tasty. However all the elements just don't add up for me. A very nice ale but not one I would associate with a ""Winter Warmer"" type of brew. I just expect more boldness with a winter beer. I will save the other bottle until early spring..."
"550ml clear bottle with the really nice label. Pours an almost clear golden amber with plenty of off-white head. Nose seems more spices than malt. Mouthfeel is adequately carbonated with a tang on the tongue. I like the taste, but it's difficult to describe. Nothing at all like any Sam Smith I've ever had. Sweet malts dominate, caramel with a spice background seem to provide most of the taste, with a dry hop finish. Fruits are in the picture as well, but this brew is a puzzler for me to describe, to be honest."
"Not my idea of a winter beer but it wasn't bad for what it was."
"The beer pours a light amber color with a lacey white head. The aroma is good, but nothing spectacular. It has some fruity qualities to it along with a scent of light crystal malts and an elevated abv. The taste is good. It is a stronger than usual amber ale. It has a good balance between malts and hops. It's a low/medium bodied ale with good carbonation. It is a fine sessions ale."
"Had this following the AVB winter solstice, and I liked this one more. Pours a medium copper body with a small off-white head. Smells of plums, red wine, some candy sweetness, and yeast. Interesting. Taste has some lightly sweet malts, more plums, some vinuousness. Bitter hops follow and linger into the finish. There's also some lingering brown sugar sweetness. Distinctly Sam Smith's tasting. Better than AVB, but still no jubelale!"
"Drinkability - This is an easy beer to consume. I was a little disappointed because my expectations were so much higher. I was expecting a little more from this seasonal ale. It's a decent beer but there are other holiday ales I would rather drink."
"A $7 mistake on the winter beer tour. Was a brown-orange color, with a whitish head. Tastes extremely bland for a winter ale, especially one by Samuel Smith. Cool looking label though, if that is any redemption. Didn't do much for my palate, good or bad."
"ng"
"I have had good luck with SS beers in the past so I thought I'd give this one a try. It poured a nice amber color with a small head that faded quicky and did not leave much in the way of lace. The smell was a little skunky with grassy and herbal scents comming through as well. The taste was skunky up front, then a really sweet flavor came through that took me by supprise and stayed there even in the aftertaste. Maybe I got a skunked bottle, so I will give this one another try sometime."
"Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout is such a good beer, but Winter Welcome Ale is a bad winter brew!"
"A light a creamy mouthfeel with some sweet, fruitiness. Nuff said."
"This ale poured a copper-amber color. Thin 1-finger head with sparse spots of lace. Smelled of malt and caramel. The taste was caramel and malt with a very faint grassy hop presence. Butterscotch with a touch of spice. Easily drinkable, but not what I expect from a winter brew. As far as it being called Strong/Old Ale style, it wasn't strong at all and perhaps tasted a little old."
"Overall, a disappointment. Winter Welcome probably deserves a second review but I'm a bit put off after my experiences with those damn clear glass bottles. Maybe later, but not too soon. Okay, rant off..."
"Pours a dark amber, not quite dark enough in my opinion for a winter ale, with a decent head lacking in retention. Nose is medium sweet malt, not particularly bold, with a few misc. spices nestled in taste is much different. The hops hit directly, followed by a sweetness not stong in malt. Some happy spice follows. In general, not a bad brew. Nothing to be joyful about, and not particularly characteristic of other winter brews. In a pinch, it will do, but not this winter."
"Pours amazingly clear with a red straw hue. No head, at all. Aroma, well, you guessed it. Skunked hops that hide all other aromas. Taste is spooked by the initial tide of sour bitterness. Several sips are needed before the rusty malt flavor finally delivers. Its a pleasant malt flavor, but the whole experience suffers all in all."
"Nice clearish amber brown syrup color with a inch tall ivory head of thick fluffed cotton, settles slowly to a thick skim on top that never leaves, lace is thick in most places with a favorable thickness nearer the edge of the glass leading up to moth holed sheets and some strings. Smell comes across kinda grassy and dry, toasty and sweet, a nice little mix. Taste is simple yet with some favorable little flavors coming through. Some mild toasted malt grains, dryish hops, grassy hay-like notes, all just kinda there, not in strength but in a presense thats quite easy and milding. Nice lightly drying finish with a mix of dry hops and toasty breadish malts that has just a twinge of very slight bitterness that grabs in the back of the throat. Feel is a solid medium body, packed nicely with mellowness and easy carbonation. An exceptional drinker, oh so good. Not heavily flavored, but whats there makes for some fine easy drinking, nothing harsh; very calm, easy, and relaxing. What a fantastic English Old Ale in the way of drinking it down. A pure session beer; if ever need be, I could drink alot of these."
"Update  I originally had this in 2003 so thought Id give the 05 a review. I enjoyed it a little more this year, which may just mean that my palate has changed a bit. I still think its thin but will raise some of the other scores up a bit."
"The head is medium-sized, a creamy tan-colored and dense. Nice. Body is clear, deep amber. Also nice. The aroma is sweet caramel with just a touch of metal. It's probably too cold. Nice grainy malt notes with fruit. A little sour. Nice bitter finish with tangy malt. Bready when warm. Good hoppy burps. This is very fruity, quite malty and nicely bitter. It really needs to warm, though."
"Appearance: Pours a copper tone with a cream colored rather thin head forms full dwindles kind of fast, lacing is formed in a big collar than with each sip the rings become more and more sparse. Aroma: Fruits seared in alchohol come through with a very mild burn, and this one contains more hops than I was expecting. Floral hopping with a slighty nutty doughy edge to it characteristic of many of the Sam Smith's I've tried. Taste: The malt profile consists of a doughy sweetness backed by fruit tones, alcohol notes, and a great nutty flavor. The most impressive part of this ale was it's hop profile fairly hoppy bitter finish tops of the flavor for me. Mouthfeel: A tad thin sort of a sharrp carbonation in my eyes a Winter Warmer needs to have more body going on. Drinkability: Decent not a beer I yearn for but glad I tried this year's edition after passing on it last year numerous times."
"This certainly isn't as big in body, sweetness, or alcohol as most barleywines I've had, but its sweet floral hoppiness is particularly enjoyable."
"I liked this offering. I did not love it. It is I have to be in the mood to drink it ale. It would go great with a cigar on a cold night."
"Damn these clear bottles. Immediately after popping the cap off, there's the familiar unpleasant ""skunked"" smell. It's not strong at all, quite mild, but noticeable nonetheless. The beer pours wonderfully though, a clear copperish brown color with a thick head. The aroma is slightly skunky, malty, and my nose is horrible so I don't get all that much out of it. Well the skunking must have just begun, because the flavors didn't involve any skunked flavors. This is a superbly smooth brew with the perfect amount of carbonation. The common and yummy Sammy Smith's yeast character is there with a pleasant balance of malt and hops. I don't sense anything intricate here, just a wonderfully balanced welcome to the horrible Chicago winter that is around the corner."
"Medium brown color, small foamy head. Aroma is slightly malty. A lighter bodied ale. Mild malts and hops. Slight toffee and malt flavors, slightly spicy. Well balanced and very drinkable, but there is not much to this beer. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Pours a deep gold to amber color with a light almost non existant head,arom is malty and a little spicey-sweet.Taste is a little complex malty and and slightly sweet with some biscuity flavors rounding this out.A slight skunk taste and aroma but I am quite sure it was from the bottle.This was the 2001-2002 offering."
"I must have gotten a skunked bottle. I heard this doesn't happen with Sam Smith's but I'd hope that this bottle wasn't their true beer. Even though it was skunked it still seemed better than macro lights! But I couldn't finish this. I don't know if I'm supposed to review skunked brews but I wanted to let it be known that I got a Sam Smith's brew that was skunked. I'm going to get this again and re-review it sometime."
"This beer poured an off-white head with small-medium sized bubbles that was long lasting. The body was clear and had an amber hue. This was another beer that I found to have a bitter taste to it.It is easy to say that this will not be a beer at the top of my beer list."
"Another aroma I cannot place. Its initial pour yielded a frothy off white head of small to medium bubbles that lasted a long while with a very nice transparent amber brown body. Initial taste was not full of flavor, but was not bad. There was the hint of an aftertaste that caused me to keep sipping it to try and place it. It was sort of smooth with an aftertaste that was hard for me to place. Not a bad beer, but not a great beer either."
"($4.79 / 18.7 oz. / 550 ml): older versions"
"This beer pours a clear reddish golden color with a large rocky tan head. The mouthfeel is pleasant smooth and rounded. The smell is toasted bread and earthy. The taste is smooth breadlike with hints of tea, warming alcohol and a zesty piney bitterness. A nice pleasing enjoyable ale that seems a bit mild for a barley wine."
"Poured an amber color with a crisp white head. The smell was very malty with a hint of citrus. The taste was excellent - malty sweetness giving way to a strong hops character, finishing up with almost a lemon aftertaste lightly mixed with alcohol. Starts at the tip of the tongue and works it's way back from there. I was honestly expecting something a bit heavier in flavor for a barley wine, but I was pleasantly surprised - it seems closer to an English ale."
"Re-reviewed about a year later. Well, I asked Santa for some, but I was disappointed in the gift. I don't know if this years batch changed, or I got a particularly aged bottle for my first review. This beer is much harsher, none of the fruity malt tastes I got last time. Looks like the category changed from barleywine (good). All in all, a decent beer, but just didn't re-blow my socks off."
""
"ales so cellaring for a year may not improve this beer."
"F."
"Very clean aftertaste with an excellent drinkability. I wouldn't change a thing with this beer. There's no wonder that I wait for this one to come out every year. A superb beer and worth waiting for every year."
"Pours with a fair amount of head that lasts quite a while, and the beer itself is an orange-ish red color, kind of light rust. Translucent for sure and pretty clear. Malty, caramel, butter nose. Malty taste with a pretty dry finish after a tiny hop kick that makes it a well-balanced brew. A nice beer when you're not in the mood for tea and just need something to drink."
"Quite good after 12 months, nothing wrong with it at all, though it tastes maltier than bottles I had last winter."
"Drinkability: Very dry finish with some bitterness thrown in as well."
"All in all Samuel Smith's brews better beers than its Winter Welcome."
"Overall, a decent winter, but not on par with Sam Smith's other beers."
"Shiny copper body, with little carbonation, topped by a frothy whie head. Very herbal nose, with some caramel sweetness. Nice biscuity start, then a touch of earthy hops arrive, in a supporting role, before a caramel-sweet finish. Long a winter favorite of mine, I shall continue to look forward to its annual appearance."
"(source: Broudy's; Jacksonville Beach, FL)"
"Pours a nearly clear copper with a couple finger's worth of tan foam that quicky breaks down to a bubbly lace. Malty grains are the most noticeable component of the smell, which is both spicy and sweet though not overly so. Sweet, malty taste rules the day in terms of the taste. An astringent finish that accompanies a somewhat bitter coating on the lips and mouth (not such a bad thing!). Quite drinkable for a strong ale, with nothing strikingly great or terrible about this beer."
"Winter Wonder, another fine sam smith brew. This one poured a clear amber with a nice medium off-white head that maintained itself & laced very well. The aroma is light, but fruity laced with winter spice. The taste is well blended spice, fruit notes,malt and faint hops. Mouthfeel is left slightly tart or bittersweet with a dry finish.This makes a great ""holiday"" beer. It does't overpower any meal and to add holiday dress to the table, the foil wrapped good looking bottle looks good next to holiday or special glassware."
"Welcome to the wonderful weird world of Sams."
"Side note: d/t the age of this beer I noticed that when empty, the clear glass was not clear anymore, it was stained almond colored."
"Backwash: Although a representative of one of my favorite styles, I enjoy the Young’s Winter Warmer and Fuller’s Old Winter Ale much more."
"I've always had a soft spot for Samuel Smith's beers. They were probably one of my first introductions into English ales back in the mid-80's. The Winter Welcome is not only the quintessential winter warmer beer, but it's an old classic and favourite of mine. However, its dryness does get on my nerves after one, making this less drinkable in my opinion, less ""wanting of another."" A touch sweeter and OBT might have a grand winter session ale in their arsenal of beers."
"Pours a clear amber color with a thick and creamy off-white colored head that fades into a nice thick lace. Nose is sweet malts, caramel, honey, and spice. Taste is a malty sweetness with notes of dark fruits and caramel with a dry finish. A very nice brew, but Samuel Smith makes many beers that are superior to this one."
"A waste of time."
"Deep amber-copper color, big frothy, clingy off-white tan colored head, leaves thick sheets of lace in my glass. Light caremel malty and flowery aroma. Sweet caremel malty flavor, some hops come through in the finish, decent medium body, a bit watery mouthfeel, not the best Samuel Smith, but not bad."
"Copper in color with a quickly dissipating, finger-thick head. Unfortunately, like most other Samuel Smith's beers, the dominant aroma is skunk, as the clear bottles cause the beer to become lightstruck. It takes a while to get over this rather unpleasant introduction, but after a while a buttery diacetyl aroma, and a tart, fruity scent begin to take hold. Flavor, too, starts off a bit skunky, and follows much the same progression, with buttery flavors leading off, followed by a caramel-like maltiness, and finally a pleasant floral hop flavor, toffee-like notes, and a slightly sweet, fruity aftertaste. Crisp and smooth, with a medium body. If only Sam Smith's would ditch the clear bottles, this would be a very fine beer."
"Reddish amber in color with a decent off-white head with small, slow rising bubbles, lots of irregular broken lace. Sweet aroma of caramel and honey with bread notes and some fugitive holiday spices. Taste begins with a sweet, lingering caramel note and soft carbonation, turns a bit grassy towards the middle, finishes with some slightly bitter and lingering hops and buttery notes. Alcohol is quite warming and seems potent. Mouthfeel is good, although not quite as good as one might expect. Still, a holiday pleasure that makes one wish that winter lasted a bit longer."
"A perfect drink."
"Pours a deep copper color with a respectable head. It looks very much like a pale ale and tastes a lot like one too, though an underhopped one in my opinion.It's very refreshing and quaffable (maybe a little on the thin side) and seems much more suited to warmer weather. There is a hint of nutmeg spice in the nose and in the taste profile but oh so subtle. I'm not usually a big fan of the big and spicy winter/Christmas ales but when I have one I want it to be....well, big and spicy. A decent ale overall but a little off the mark for the category."
"Pours a clear copper color that has no head. This reminds me of a pale ale with holiday spices mixed in. The smells and taste of nutmeg and pale malt compliment each other very well here. Not to bad but would not call it a winter welcome ale."
"More malts kick in upon tasting it, in addition to some biscuit-like and earthy grassy hay flavors. I think the bitter aftertaste is what struck me down initially, but now we are cool. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and pleasant. At first it was nearly intolerable, but now I am enjoying slowly sipping this one. I think the fact that the food made it better is a possible indication that it pairs well with Italian food. Nothing like ol' Nana's cookin on Christmas!"
"Color of apple juice with a thick white head. Sweet smells of caramel maltiness and a taffy-like aroma as well. Light carbonation. This is a malty brew, with candy apple and brown sugar sweetness with a bit of earthy hops to bring some balance. Nice warming effect from the alcohol. I enjoyed this beer."
"Pours amber in color. Head seems to dissipate quickly. By the smell I thought this beer might be skunked. It is in a clear bottle. However, the taste doesn't indicate any skunky flavor. Maybe some butterscotch. Alcohol taste is present. Some slight peppery taste. A mild bitterness remains for quite a long time but in a very subtle and subdued way. It doesn't seem so special for a seasonal beer. Would have liked some more of the butterscotch flavor. I'm going to call this one average in all categories."
"Not a bad brew, all-around. Samuel Smith is famous for brewing high-quality beers. This one is no exception. It is respectable in color, and has a good ale aroma, however unlike many seasonals, this bier is not burdened with heaviness in spice and sweetness. This brew is well worth the try. Prost!"
"I think they swapped the labels at the store on me with Bass. Poured amber, light head. Really bland, non carbonated taste. Total disappointment. Maybe this beer could welcome some hops or better yet some taste? My wife said it tasted like beer she remebers from college. That was the frosting on the cake."
"Very dry with an almost martini like finish. I look forward to having this one again."
"Sam Smith’s Winter Welcome: In a big Imperial pint bottle. Clear. The color is a very tan/iced tea color, with a slightly off-white head. Very nice aroma, sweet candy like. The initial taste is very pleasant, not too sweet, but with very nice malt taste. This is not what one would traditionally consider a winter beer; to me, it is missing the spices that are prevalent with the other winter/holiday beers. That is not to say that it is not an excellent beer, it tastes like a wonderfully malty ale. It is not, however, a great holiday beer. Nice."
"Copper in color with a white head and some lacing. Musty aroma with notes of fruit, honey, and hops. Medium bodied with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel. Starts with a bready malt flavor along with some carmel and fruitness. A mustiness lurks in the backround that takes away from the beer. Some spiciness comes forward, not from the hops, which are minimal, but hard to pinpoint the taste. The flavor is very subdued, sweet but it seems to be lacking something. I was expecting more after having Samuel Smith's other brews."
"A deep amber ale with a cloudy and full body. There is a very heavy caramel malt taste and aroma to this offering...Nice original crown which disapates to glass clinging web..... Not my style of choice, but very nice."
"Finish was quick and dry with some more earth hop flavor that all ends rather quick. The carbonation in the beer was a bit tight and fizzy, not overly creamy by any stretch, just the opposite in fact. I like this beer a lot, I always have, but compared to so many other bigger winter offering, I can see why some are not all that impressed. I think of it more in terms of a delicate Speyside malt whisky, it is complex and very enjoyable, but you must be patient and contemplative to fully enjoy its charms."
"edit: this is 2002 vintage."
"550 ml. clear glass bottle with gold foil over the cap. The first impression after opening the bottle was the skunky aroma. Fortunately it dissipated rapidly. It pours an amber to orange color with a pale head. The flavor is slightly caramel to toffee. I was expecting something spectacular (Samuel Smith's rep.) and instead found something quite ordinary."
"This is one of the beers that I actually look forward to enjoying as winter approaches; and I like to buy a case as it's not a heavy beer and it can be enjoyed year round. I've cellared bottles that have shown no sign of age after a year or more! It pours a clear, light orangish-brown/auburn with a full and frothy yellow-tinged head that holds extremely well and leaves excellent lace. The aroma is distinctly buttery (but not quite butterscotch), alongside honey, caramel and toffee. A light fruitiness adds to the toffee but isn't really distinct on its own. Hop aroma is basically absent by design, although there is a mild background grassiness. The body is medium with a lightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor starts with a mildly fruity toffee that's coat-tailed by softer caramel notes and then a light butterscotch before a balancing bitterness comes up. It finishes semi-dry with some lingering buttery sweet malt. Some alcohol is noticeable as you come to the end of a pint, but for the most part it's fully cloaked. An exceptional ale that proves that a little bit of diacetyl can be a nice thing! Highly recommended and worth seeking out."
"Poured light amber in color with a small head that did not last. Malty in smell and in flavor. Not your typical ""Winter Ale"" in terms of flavor. It kind of tastes like a strong British pale ale. I have to say that I have always been so impressed with all the Sam Smith products, but this one doesn't do it for me. A good beer but not what I think of in terms of a ""Winter"" brew."
"Pours to a beautiful copper/amber color with a thick off-white head. Aromas are of light caramel malt and fruity hops. This beer has a nice fruity hop flavors balanced with light caramel malt flavor. It is relatively light in body, smooth, with a semi-sweet finish. Overall it is a tasty, well-balanced beer with a strength that sneaks up on you."
"Notes: A cast and mold for a lot of the US breweries to build from in the past. Now it seems middle of the road in comparison to what is in the American market now."
"I was so bummed out by this beer I'm almost depressed. First the damm clear glass has got to go! What is with S.S.? Very skunky nose dominated, toasty malt flavor and every other nuance was ruined by the skunk smell which seeped in to the taste as well. Appearance was nice, deep amber body, thick head and sheets of lace. Good rounded mouthfeel the only other positive. I know this is a good brand of brew and I looked for it while in London, (no luck) but I don't know if I will buy any Sammy again until they bottle their product properly. I seem to recall the IPA is in a brown bottle, why not the rest?!"
"Overall, a solid winter warmer.  Nothing I'd go out of my way to find, but a good stand-by for the holiday season."
"Amber, clear...head is persistant, different bubble sizes and 1/4 inch tall.  Nutmeg smell mixed with a little lemon brightness.  Full-bodied malt, a long sense of toffee diacetyl and mid range caramel.  Slightly floral hops are evident at the close but are subtle.  Smooth and drinkable but a little less 'big"" than I was expecting.  Still, solid, and a product of warm-fermenting experience."
"2002 edition. Well, again, what did I smell when I first opened this bottle? Skunk. I've never had a skunky beer from a brown bottle, but I get this with the Samuel Smith's clear bottles all of the time. Fortunately, they're never damaged enough for it to last past the initial bottle opening and pour, a little agitation of the brew brings out the true aroma. Still loses aroma points because of this. Anyway, the brew is clear orange-amber with a big-bubbled, sticky white head that goes down completely after a while. I'm getting hints of spice in the aroma, maybe some orange peel. Sweet malt takes most of the aroma, rich caramel. Kind of buttery too. Hops are there, but the exact aroma is hard to pinpoint. Hitting your palate, it's malty and spicy, as a winter warmer should be. Strong caramel malt and subdued spicy hops, a bit of orange peel spiciness and very slight fruit character, I'd say pear. Malt presence is also grainy under the caramel, which makes it crisp. It gets a bit bready as it warms as well, making this beer almost märzen-like. Smooth in the front, but hops come around more in the back. Not as full-bodied as some other winter brews, but definitely a good brew and very drinkable. This would make a good session brew for wintertime. I think I'm going to start getting my Sam Smith's from a store that keeps them more out of the way of fluorescent light, though."
"Smooth! Like most of the Samuel Smith's line this beer is a pleasure to drink. Buttery caramel malt and earthy, almost piney,  hop twist. Long, mossy hop finish is a bit astringent, but not unpleasant. A Winter luke-Warmer."
"As soon as I opened the 550ml (clear) bottle I could detect a fairly noticeable note of skunk damn. I aired it out a moment in my mug then I could detect some lovely sweet maltiness, maybe some caramel. Brownish-orange hue with an off-white head. The complexity of flavors was minimal, some sweet malt, butterscotch, and some underlying sourness. This beer is surprisingly average. I got annoyed at the tacky mouthfeel it created. Maybe Ill try it again later this year... I did and the second bottle (from another source) was far worse. Will my third try be the charm?"
"16 oz. clear bottle. Amber color, fluffy hop filled head. Laces nicely down the glass. Carmel malt sweetness is prevalant and very inticing. Decent English hop smells faintly pop through. Taste is a combination of toasted carmel matly sweetness and a nice hop finish. A bit thin feeling for a Winter Welcome Ale. I had one bottle last year, and kept one bottle and recently reviewed. This is one you definitly need to drink right away, no doubt the clear bottle dulls the flavors."
"Had this brew sitting arounf since last winter.  House got cold so I decided to break into it...good decision.  Pours into a nice orange-strw color with a foamy white head.  The aromas of British yeast and buttery tones is very inviting.  Very smooth flavor with a buttery caramel maltiness and a clean smooth full-bodied finish.  The alcohol content is not niticeable at all.  This is going to be a perennial favorite for me I think."
"This ale pours a nice amber color with an off-white head that doesn't retain particularly well. The smell is rather bland, with a little skunkiness penetrating through. There is a hint of spiciness in the nose, however. The taste is quite malty with some spicy, herbal notes and just a touch of what I presume to be Fuggles hops. The mouthfeel is rather oily, with minimal carbonation present. Not a bad beer, but I wasn't ready for another."
"Winter Welcome is one of England's best representations of the winter or Christmas brew styles. Full bodied (almost syrupy). This ale is so velvetty smooth and well rounded, its difficult not to guzzle it down. Good thing for the large bottles! The tea-like hops with a hint of citrus bitterness are noticeable early in the glass, but sort of fades under the rich malt, but that's cool, this is a quality malt, cherry sweet, roasted especially for the holidays."
"Like the Pale Ale I had the day before, this bottle was slightly skunked. They really need to leave the clear bottles to their Stouts. Skunking aside, this had a decent spiced aroma. The flavor was kind of lacking though and I was not really all that interested in finishing the bottle, which is never a good sign."
"It poured an amber color with a quickly dissipating head.  The aroma was slightly hoppy with a faint straw smell.  The taste was sweet, neither malt nor citrusy, I could not put my finger on it.  Not a bad beer, but not my first choice."
"The orange - amber colored brew is topped by a well retained off - white head.  The surprisingly mild aroma consists just a hint of caramel sweetness and fruitiness from the Sam's yeast strain.  Hop nose is mild as well, but distinctive earthy Fuggles hop nose is discernible.  As the brew warms, that distinctive Sam Smith diacetyl butterscotch note nudges its way into the aroma as well.  Light in body for a strong ale, but the fairly low carbonation and residual dextrins allow for a pleasant mouthfeel.  Not particularly complex in malt flavor, and compared to other British strongs ales it's a touch bland.  Biscuit malt flavors dominate.  Very grassy and earthy hop flavor... Fuggles all the way.  Finishes with lots of toasted malt flavors and an enjoyable sweetness that coats the tongue.  This is the first bottle of Winter Welcome I've had that wasn't skunked!  It's not outstanding, but is quite drinkable nevertheless."
"Nice amber color.  Vanilla smells in the nose.  Candy sugar flavors with hints of butterscotch. Bitter, but fairly well balanced. High alcohol level detected in it's dry finish.  Overall a pretty decent brew."
"This is more a classic English Bitter than a winter brew in my opinion but never the less a fine ale.  Pleasantly bitter with a smooth finish, medium amber in color with a thick head that goes away to a small froth that clings in rings all the way down the glass.  Very drinkable.  I always look forward to this comming out in the late fall and then I stock up quickly because it is highly sought after here in central Texas and disappears around Christmas.  This the Winter Ale all others aspire to."
"As I seat here in my shorts & a T-shirt...it may be a mystery to you why Im just getting to this Winter Welcome(mixed up with my empty bottles, doh!) Head is initially average sized, creamy, white/light tan w/ nice lacing, pretty much fully lasting. Body is clear light honey/amber in color, w/ a medium body. The aroma is moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers), moderately malty (cookie, toasted light bread); w/  nice notes of  vanilla (I like); same can be tasted on the palate, w/ a smooth mouth feel. Ends w/ a very nice long sweet finish. I too do not understand the clear bottle, but in response to other reviews, someone was asking what to compare it to, I would say it is very similar to SA Boston Stock Ale. Anywaymy overall opinion is that I enjoyed this brew-it was not skunked what so ever! The only thing that points to a winter welcome is the 6.0abv.(Im not even sure was constitutes a winter brew) I thought this was a very good AleI enjoy the SA Stock Ale a bit more over this though."
"This was my first experience with a skunked beer (I've been really lucky so far considering how many beers I've tried). Luckily, it was just starting to go skunky, so it was still drinkable. I should have known better than to buy a winter ale in a clear bottle in late March. They should know better than to export a beer in a clear bottle. My other qualm with this beer is that it shouldn't be a winter brew. The lightness, vanilla, some sweetness and fruit flavors reminded me of Sam Adams Spring Ale. Those problems aside, it was a good beer. Nice Orange color, alcohol covered extremely well, and very pleasant."
"Pours a clear copper/amber with a nice 2 finger head. It has a faint aroma of lightly sweetened roasted malt. The taste is more of the roasted malt and a tad of caramel in the background with light hopping. This is a light to medium bodied brew that drinks down easy. It is a solid brew, but not a spectacular one. Cheers!"
"This beer smells skunky.  It also tastes a bit skunky (although not as bad as in years past).  This beer has never impressed me.  It's one of my least favorite winter brews."
"i found this hard to review because of no other beers to compare it to within its style. it's copper in color and pours a thin head, leaving little to no lace. i pick up the slight butterscotch/rum aroma which also had an ever so slight skunkiness. it has a unique sweet buttery/candy flavor which is very agreeable. hop bitterness comes off soft and gentle. alcohol presence is masked beautifully but it warms you quickly. a little thin, but there is enough body and depth to satisfy. i thoroughly enjoyed this winter welcome ale."
"An excellent winter beer; very tasty, with caramel and butterscotchy notes giving way to a malty aftertaste...and with enough alcohol to warm you up without knocking you out.  (A great replacement for a glass of milk before bed though..)  Another excellent beer from Tadcaster."
"2000-2001 Potent alchoholic and butter rum essense, a pretty well rounded malt/hops balance.  Slight burnt flavor comes out in the finish.  Alchohol and butterscotch on the nose.  Hazey, dark golden amber, a lace remains around the edge of my glass.  Overall, a good beer.  Has good character.  $3.50 a bottle though..."
"Big, malty and a lot of caramel.  After that, its pretty monotonous.  Can't help but compare it to this brewery's other fine products, and it comes up short.  I'd rather have the Imperial Stout by the fire."
"2001-2002.  Can't get any more average than all 3's.  If this is supposed to be a winter wamer/strong ale, it's missing the mark.  Not dark enough, not rich enough, not creamy enough.  Maybe I've been spoiled by all the great winter ales out there, but this is closer to a pale ale in my book."
