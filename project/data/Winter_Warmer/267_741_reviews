"Redish Gold/brown color. light lacing. Intitial taste of lemon and grapefruit which mellows to a malty caramel after taste with a hint of hops."
""
""
""
"Pours with a large,  light brown head. Is reddish brown in color. Has a sweet, hoppy aroma combined with a caramel scent. Initial taste is sweet from the caramel. Finishing taste is slightly hoppy with a slight hint of alcohol. Overall taste is very similar to a brown ale without the bitterness. An amazing beer. Need to stock up next Fall with this."
"Yet again another nice winter beer to have. Very tasty and warm."
""
""
"Malty, hoppy, and the perfect level of ABV to compliment."
""
""
""
"Great feel in the mouth; well balanced; smell and taste are good but a bit thin.  Contrary to some other reviews, I found a lot of carbonation. Taste improves as it warms."
"Damn... not everyone has the same taste in beer. I liked this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Drinkable, well balanced, not overly spiced. A bit flat and not as remarkable as other Odell brews I had."
""
"I usually find this style boring,  the the butterscotch and caramel flavors explode in my mouth.  Very drinkable,  great for this cold Minnesota winter"

"Not a big fan of this beer"

"Murky coppery colored beer with a thin head.  Thick, buttery mouthfeel with a malt foward pallet that hits heavy on carmel and butter-scotch notes."
""
""
""
"Rich anber-brown in color with a thin tan head.  The aroma is of malt and toffee.  Sweet, but balanced with considerable hop bitterness.  Full and enjoyable. This is a nice malty winter ale."
""
""
""
""
"Upfront hoppy herbal bite dominates but as it  fades a noticeably malty sweet  note comes through at the end. It became more noticeable and enjoyable with my second beer, as with most beer ;)."

"Per my friend D Max...""It's f$%king tasty"""
"This is a decent beer but I wouldn't consider this ""world class"".  The taste is less than desirable for a winter warmer, it feels and tastes very thin.  However the drinkability of this brew is exceptional.  Overall 3.25/5"

"More along the lines of an Amber Ale, that just happens to be a winter seasonal.  Which is exactly what the breweries intended to make, instead of an actual Winter Warmer (either something spiced, or more of an Old Ale).  Anyway, just an enjoyable beer that does not try to be to much.  Maybe not my favorite from the brewery, or the winter releases.  I can still find room in my fridge for this however."

"Overall- a nicely balanced beer, lots of contrast going on, a cool take on the winter warmer style. very interesting and well worth trying."

"Overall (3.82) : As usual, Odell's offering is a bit too hoppy for my palate. For a malty winter warmer style, this beer is way over hopped. I can't resist their rustic labels so I keep buying their products, but they are very hop based and this one is no different. I like the pale hops and the caramel malts together, they create an interesting robustness that sticks around. I'd probably have this again on a cold winter's night."

"Tasty treat. Nice mouthfeel makes it good for this time of year."

"T/M:  Strong, boozy flavors with a dank hop astringency.  Flavors are balanced but simple and a bit one-dimensional.  Almost too sticky for it's own good, fortunately ample carbonation cleanses the palate between sips - I wouldn't care for this from a cask.  Finishes long and sweet."
""
"O: 4.0 - Simple fall beer, but very well crafted. Will buy again!"
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal clear, amber-brown coloring, with a fluffy, off-white head. Nose of fig, date, sugar plum, molasses, and candied sugar, with subtle spice notes throughout. Flavors are roasted forward, with a blast of old-world fruit, roasted notes, and subtle nutmeg and cinnamon spice. Bold, full-bodied, with a spiced fig and date sweet blend to make the aftertaste. Smooth, spiced lingering finish. Really good beer."

"O: Wonderful take on the style. Was actually looking for something a bit heavier but this is pretty damn tasty."

"Pours a pretty dark amber in color with reddish highlights that has a good 1-finger creamy/foamy head that stays around for awhile. A decent amount of lacing is seen with each sip which surprised me also. The aroma is very pleasant and consists of caramel malts, toffee with spice. More going on with the taste that ends with a slight hoppy finish but wasn't bad. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall a good brew for the colder months."
"Clear dark amber pour with an off-white one-finger head. Nice sweet malt aroma. Medium bodied. Taste has flavors of caramel malt, toffee, light spice and earthy hops, which add a really nice balancing bitterness."

"My favorite winter warmer is Isolation Ale.  I know I pump Odell Brewing's tires at every opportunity, but man, they make some excellent beers.  This one has everything you'd want in a winter seasonal, plenty of flavor and actually not that much alcohol, so you can enjoy it without feeling weighed down by it.  My only issue is that it's available so early that it's generally sold out by the time the holidays get here - maybe they could bump it back a month so it would carry over in to the new year.  But that's just to say: get it while you can!"
""
""
""
"This beer is quiet - there's a lot going on, but it all blends so well that the overall impression is one of unified, subtle but definite finesse; this right here is malt/roast/good-ol'-behind-the-scenes-wizardry flavor, not your rather more obvious hops."

"Mouthfeel: standard fluffy English ale mouthfeel, fairly light bodied with a somewhat dry finish. Flavor: a hearty brew. The malt dominates (as expected) with those raisin, caramel, and whole wheat bread (toasted) flavors leading the way. There is also a moderate hop presence in the middle and finish and a bit of lingering alcohol burn with the swallow. Delicious and well made ale."

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a foamy (2/3) and smooth (1/3) mouthfeel that is fine for the beer itself, the body a bit thin and the carbonation just about right for the style itself. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
""
""
"A pretty good beer, although I wouldn’t exactly call it a winter warmer. Tasty though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good winter warmer beer. Not as dark or complex as some in this category, but it's earthiness makes it ideal for warming up after a day in the snow and/or mountains."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation, and a more sweet than bitter aftertaste. This is one of the best Winter warmers I have had, next to Old Fezziwig."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice take on the style, and I appreciated the hop presence on this one as opposed to strictly a malt/caramel bomb. Yeah, I could definitely do more of these."

"Overall- Very nice, a winter warmer indeed. Good flavor balance, I'd definitely revisit this one if it were available around here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A straight ahead enjoyable winter warmer - big, toasty, sweet, and just a little bit spicy and hoppy, with a gentle alcohol edge that would allow for a least a couple of these, after hiking through the snowbound woods, or an icy suburban street, whatever gets you to this."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is simply fantastic. A malty beer with good hop forward flavor. This beer hits what I love, malty, slighty bready, with a blast of hops as a finishing flavor you dont really expect. Odell brewing is always dead on. I love all of thier beer and this one is no different. Don't skip this one."
""
""
"Overall: I liked it, on the higher end of the winter warmers I have tried so far, but not the best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty, easy drinking yet very flavorful. One of those that you just need to try. Wouldn't expect anything less from Odells."
"This is a very solid offering from Odell. It pours an amber-orange with a nice, lacy head. Smell is of malt and sweetness, as is the taste with very little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and rich without being overpowering. Overall, one of Odell's better beers, but it cannot compete with their IPA or Myrcenary Double IPA. Bravo"
""
""
"Pours a pretty dark amber with significant head that crumples after a few minutes and leaves light lacing on the glass. Really good looking beer, for sure. Smells caramelly and can definitely detect the hops in the nose. Malty flavor with nice hop balance, and a medium mouthfeel, with adequate carbonation. A nice winter warmer from Odell, but not really taking it to a new level. And at 6% abv, may want to keep your hoodie on."

"the hops and sessionability put this one over"

"O - a very good winter warmer style ale."
""
"This beer poured out as a nice looking deep amber color with a foamed cream colored head on top. The lacing and retention are very good on this beer. The smell is malty, fairly sweet and warming. There is a subtle earthiness on the nose too. The taste of the beer is malty with a warming toasted caramel flavor with a very subtle spice note in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and very drinkable. Nice carbonation and body too. Overall it's a pretty solid brew but not as complex as I was hoping for."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is copper hued with a half inch of off white head. Teeming with effervescence. The aroma offers malt, grain, a hint of fruit, subtle sweetness and spice. Rather mild scent overall. The flavor is bready and sweet. Odd finish. A bit harsh and getting worse with every drink. Ut oh. Not really what comes to mind when I think of a winter warmer. Bland, unexciting, and forgetful. C'mon man."
""
"Overall this is quite an enjoyable beer. I feel like I could drink several in a row happily. Seems like it would pair well with a meal, but is good enough to stand on its own. Wish this was available locally to get through the colder months."
""
""
""
""

"Overall (4.0): This is a nice winter warmer that shows no booze and really great balance for the style. I don’t often drink winter warmers, but I can see the appeal with an example like this. It’s easy-drinking, malt-forward without being too thick or sweet, but still opens up nicely as it warms. A very nice beer."
"Over all this is a great beer to me , I will be buying a couple of six packs Saturday when I go to the state line"

"Would I buy this beer again? Probably not."

"Overall: A very solid winter warmer. Doesn't have the typical cinnamon and nutmeg type spices, but it has some nice subtle undertones."

"Final Thoughts: One of my favorite Winter Warmer seasonal offerings. Odell Brewing proves time and time again that they know how to make a great beer. Would I drink it again? Yep, worth at least one sixer every December."
""
""
""

"Taste is similar -- heavily malted, with tones of toffee and caramel, and a light hoppy finish. This one drinks like a heavier amber ale, and holds up well as a heavy-bodied night-time session brew for the colder months."
"O - I was expecting something with a bit of spice and was pleased to find a simple, yet perfectly balanced ale offering up a solid caramel malt profile with a lightly hopped finish. Easily sessionable and well worth seeking out."

"Pours a coppery-amber with a nice foamy khaki head. Good lacing and lots of effervescence. Definitely malt forward; sugared candy, nutty, bread, and a little spice. Taste is better than I expected; bready, nutty, a little candied sugar, and some cinnamon in the finish along with just a touch of some hops. Leaves a dry finish. A nice medium body, some activity. Overall, Odell with another really good seasonal (should i have expected anything else from them?). With the shortening of the days and the weather beginning to cool, this beer hits the spot. Its become one of my favorite winter nightcaps."
"O - A malty, drinkable, warming ale of moderately high strength. Up to Odell's very high quality standards. I would expect no less from them."

"I have since gone to the Odell website and found that Isolation is a seasonal. Any resemblance to beers mentioned previously are heretofore coincidence. That said, good beer is good beer, and Isolation, independent of the similarities I have discussed above, is a very decent drink. I wish the folks at Odell much success and hope to see them in my market soon."

"Thin white head with a lace over a copper colored ale that changes from gold to amber in the bar light. Strong malt, caramel and toffee in the nose--subtle spice from the hop and a hotness from the alcohol. Newcastle like malt taste, but much hoppier and it has a mineral twang over sweet caramel and toffee. Fruity and floral hop punches through the apparent alcohol (6% accroding to BA). Good beer, well brewed--I'm just not a fan of it."

"Notes: I'm probably the most critical person on the planet when it comes to Winter Warmers. This is one of the few that I can fully endorse. If only it were distributed here . . ."

"Overall – not terribly intriguing to think about, but very good-tasting."

"Edit (1/19/12): This one definitely grew on me as I got more accustomed to the style of winter warmers. It's balanced in such a way that it seems like a way bigger beer than it actually is. Although it's only 6% ABV, Isolation has an excellent warming quality to it."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like an old ale, winter warmers are usually more sessionable for me, and this just seemed like a bigger beer than a 6% winter warmer should be. I guess that's why I age half of 'em, seeing if they grow into their big boy pants."
"Overall:	It is a good beer. I like it better on tap of course but even in the bottle it is pretty good."
"O - Another solid brew from Odell. Just not my favorite. Nice beer to curl up with by a fire and enjoy a few without putting your lights out."
""
"Overall, a decent winter warmer. Nothing crazy spectacular, but I have gotten through a few of these this winter."
""

"O: Not what I want in a Winter Warmer, this thing has light Belgian notes and even reminds me of a maibock or helles bock. Lager-ish in a way. Just not dark, spicy, malty or hoppy enough for me."
"smells a bit hoppy, some biscuit and getting some tang somwhere in there. Maybe orange. Pours an amber color with no head, and very little lacing. Taste is a tad bit hoppy, biscuity, and tangy. Finishes with an odd tang. Not a bad brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer, easy drinking. I'd get it again."
""
"O. Seriously disappointing. None of the depth or spice I enjoy in my winter warmers. What you have here is a beer that doesnt know what it wants to be: hop or malt forward. It is quite an exercise in mediocrity. Hello, drain."
"i had to edit this after i saw the bros went 100. not what i got out of this beer"
""
""
""
"Overall a deliciously warming beer perfect for Christmas."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark clear amber with a beige head. Head is about a finger high and leaves some faint lacing. Nose is full of biscuity malt with a faint whiff of hops. Taste is earthy malts up front with some diacetyl in the finish and a nice, faint hop crispness throughout. Medium bodied with a bit of a sticky finish. Not my favorite winter warmer out there but definitely a solid brew."
""
""
""
""
"2012's version is certainly a winner. Good all-around winter warmer with great balance and complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not so cloy as some of this style are but it's there but balanced so well by the hops. Nice caramel malt. Maybe it's too fresh but the hops kinda take precedent. This beer needs some time. I might save a bottle for a month in the bottom of the fridge and review as I can hear the malts screaming but the hops balance a bit too well. Which I really like! I can tell this beer was made with love..."
""

"Isolation is a malty, warming, rich delight of a winter warmer. Would be great on a snowy night, when the frost keeps you inside, isolated."
"Odell Isolation Ale: This ale has a leather-brown color, very clear with some fine carbonation. The head is thin and off-white. The aroma hits you with lots of roasted malt. The flavor is similar, a big burst of malt tails off to some warming alcohol. This is a robust ale with lots of flavor, but still smooth enough to enjoy a few."
""
""
"seem to even rate as a ""winter warmer"". It's a decent pale ale and very drinkable but not special enough for a seasonal. (I wonder if the recipe has changed in the many years since it was reviewed by the Alstrom Bros)"
"Very good beer, nice to sip on slowly, but still quite drinkable. While i can no longer say i haven't had a bad beer from Odell (having recently had the infected Bourbon Barrel Stout, which, to their credit, they are dealing with amazingly well), this beer continues a very good run from this brewery."

"The winter warmer tour continues, this was very attractive in the glass and was pretty good on the tongue. Not super complex, but a nice sweet beer with a little pine kick at the end. Didn't notice much in the way of spices."
"Coppery color-small head with some decent lacing. Sharp and metallic aroma-moderate amount of maltiness. Malty flavor with a mild spice/bitterness to it. While not unpleasant it does nothing to enhance the flavor of the beer. Grainy sort of taste. Ok mouthfeel, somewhat thin for my liking. Rather ho hum. Lose the bitterness and more of a soft, malty flavor and I think I would enjoy it more."
"Overall this is a fantastic Winter Warmer and an all around tasty brew. Recommended to all. Cheers!"
"I like this beer a lot. I appreciate that Odell took the liberty of brewing a winter seasonal without dumping pounds of spices in the boil. I look forward to enjoying many more this fall and winter."
"overall: not impressed. apparently this is suppose to be a spiced type ale but it comes off like Midas Touch from DFH, which if you like would make this beer a sure trade/purchase. For me though it too closely resembles malt liquor."
"Overall a decent beer - nose really threw me off, kind of wondering if I had a bad bottle. Would drink again, but won't seek out."
"All 4's."
"not your traditional winter warmer per se, more of a prewinter drink. the lighter mouthfeel gives it more of an autumnal vibe, rather than a sit in your gut freezing night beverage. pours a maple syrup colored indian red, with a half inch head that hangs out the whole time. nose is balanced caramel malts and aromatic hops. smells english in that old and dusty kind of way. taste is balanced, with a heavy malt backbone. slightly dry. at 6.1% i would not choose it to get me through the dead of february, but its perfect for november!"
"A bottle from last years batch poured into my Odell glass. The color is a deep reddish brown with minimal lacing that fades quickly. The nose is of biscuit malts, light caramel and maybe a hit of dark fruit. The taste is malts, sugars and some light hop bitterness at the end. There really isn't much hop to be found except right at the last breath the drink. The finish is a soft dryness and a touch of sweetness. There isn't any spice to be found which is nice for a change. A good, almost sessionable winter warmer for me. Odell is top 5 in my book for sure."
"Overall, this is a well balanced, well flavored, and not overpowering seasonal beer."
"One of my Christmas favorites every year. Poured a rich, dense reddish-brown color, with a generous tan head. Aromas of fruitcake, malt and earthy hops. On the palate, medium bodied, with flavors of dark fruits (fruitcake), earthy hops, sugar and malt."
"Pretty good, although from experience I was expecting a 'winter warmer' to be slightly spiced. A nice balance of flavours with pleasant sweetness. Could perhaps have done with some subtle roasty notes to add character. The body seemed a little thin, but a very drinkable beer nonetheless. Worth sampling...."
"Cheers!"
"Big thanks goes out to jmkratt for sending me a bottle of this as an extra in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a two finger bone white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutmeg, coriander, and clove. The flavor was of sweet malt, coriander, nutmeg, and enise. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew, but was far from awe-inspiring. It was actually decent for a winter warmer but just not very memorable. The flavor was pretty heavy on the spices as one would expect, but it just didn't have any sweetness to really balance it out to the degree of the spices. Pretty much the same story for the aroma as well. Worth trying but that's about it."
"I don't really give a Schlitz about Isolation Ale. It's not bad, but there is better to be had."
"Drinkability - Quite delicious... I often have two. Would recommend to others."
"This beer makes me wish I lived closer to Colorado, very enjoyable."
"Overall I liked this beer but wanted it to be a bit bolder in just about every way imaginable. A six percent winter warmer is definitely on the low alcohol side, so it drank easily, but just wasn't quite what I was expecting, I suppose."
"D: It comes close to knocking it out of the park for this style. A great beer for a cold night where I get snowed in. Unfortunately that doesn't happen that often here in San Diego"
"The body is moderate. Mild crispness; easy finish. This isn't your typical Winter Warmer, though what is? I guess this is a pretty all-encompassing style. This one is sweet with hints of honey, vanilla, applesauce, mild spices, and a bready finish. This isn't what I expected, but it's good nonetheless. Glad I have a couple bottles."
"Pours a clear amber with a light fluffy two finger tan head and alot of sticky lacing on the way out. Aromas of carmel malts and spice. Sweet malt and carmel on the palate with enough spicey goodness to make things interesing. A dry medium bodied brew with good carbonation. Exceptionally drinkable."
"D: Average at best. Not much else to say."
"Overall drinkability is good. I understand this is the winter seasonal but this sure drinks like a better version of a Fat Tire!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium body and fine, limited carbonation results in a pretty smooth feel. This is certainly a drinkable beer overall, nicely done by Odell. I'd heard good things about this beer, and I wasn't disappointed."
"Pretty drinkable, nice winter time brew."
"Unfortunately, this is only an average beer for its style, but with an excellent, smooth and creamy mouthfeel and drinkability that ""goes all the way to ""11", it is definitely a cut above average for an everyday sipper."
"D - The drink is good. Not problem having a couple."
"Mouthfeel: Medium body, easy to drink!"
"D: Drinkable, no, I'm not a big fan of this and I'm not sure how I'm going to get rid of five more. 3"
"Not up to Odell's usual impeccable standards. Drinkable, though."
"Wow. While much hoppier than most examples of the style, this is extremely drinkable, yet still has enough alcohol to act as a winter warmer. I would be happy to knock back several of these."
"good winter warmer high end for style but as a beer in general one six pack a year will be all that I buy"
"This beer pours a clear dark amber color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel and toffee. It is pleasant, but non memorable. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an almost watery texture, and ample carbonation. Overall, this is the first beer from Odell that I haven't fallen in love with. I wouldn't complain about drinking this beer again, but someone else would have to buy it."
"Sample from Bryan. Thanks."
"Drinkability: The light amount of flavors and reasonably low ABV give good reason for this brew to be very drinkable."
"pours a mostly clear dark copper color with a 2 finger head that dissipates fast but does leave alot of clingy lacing on the glass.. smell is toasty,malty.nutty,with baked bread..taste is much the same its roasted malts,nuts,toffee mixed with sweet malts,,it then gives way to some earthy hops mixed with peat and fruit its a fantastic WW..mouth feel is full of flavor crisp with hops ,chocolate,roasted malts..one of my favorite WW this season.. go try this one"
"Carbonation and lower alcohol leads to a nice mouthfeel and good drinkability. I've drank my share of Isolation during the Rocky Mountain winters. Never disappointed."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours a bright amber with some clarity, though not brilliant with a wispy fizzy head that leaves some adequate lacing. Aroma is tough to discern at first, it could be that it needs to warm up for me to get anything out of it. I'm getting faint hints of gingerbread followed by maybe some cinnamon. Like I said though, it's hard to find here. Nicely carbonated with a spicy cinnamon finish. Moderate toffee malt sweetness up front, with a bit of alcohol ester warmth in the finish. Reminds me a little bit of an ESB hopped up with spice in the finish. Definitely has that Christmas / Winter Warmer thing going on."
"Reddish amber color with one inch of head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. A lot of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Smells slightly more fruity than what I was expecting. Distinct aroma of berries to go along with the caramel malt and subtle spice. Hops add a little citrus and pine as well. Flavor of caramel malt with a heavy element of corn husk. Tastes artifical and dirty. A little grassy and herbal from the hops. Not sure if spice is added to this beer but if it is it is very subtle. Not too sweet and bitterness is low. Medium body and nicely carbonated. A good winter warmer that the malt profile that just does not completely click with me."
"D- Delicious and complex. Easy to go down with the slightest alcohol tinge."
"D= Very unique and interesting - and quite the chameleon. Just when I would decide it was too full of toasted malts, the sweetness would kick into the next sip and make me rethink that assessment. All in all a fun beer that I hope to get more of in the future."
"Probably to style, but just confusing and overall not all that enjoyable for myself. Kind of a mess in the smell and taste. Give it a shot, but I will not be having this one again."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D - could definitely have a few but wouldn't want more than two or three - it might get a little sweet for my tastes."
"Everything is just about great with this one - while not my favorite style or even my favorite example of the style, Isolation Ale manages to be a pretty great beer that I should have gotten around to long before tonight."
"Drinkability -- Pretty nice. Good malt profile and enough spicy malt to balance and keep things interesting. One could do worse than to be snowed in with a case of this."
"D: Could drink all day, and have."
"A nice winter warmer."
"This is exactly the kind of beer I'm really digging at the moment. Smooth, malty, not overly sweet. Pours a dark amber color with an inch tall off white head that left some light lacing. Aroma is malty, lightly sweet, toasty, and just a hint of chocolate. Yum... This tastes delicious. This beer doesn't overload you with huge malty sugars, but the malts are the dominate aspect. Toasty, bready, lots of caramel, and like the aroma, there's just a touch of chocolate onthe long finish. Medium body, super easy to drink. Wow, I can't get enough of this. It's a malt-lover's dream without going overboard on the ABV and sweetness. I'll be drinking A LOT of this over the winter months."
"Edit: Lowered my taste score from 4.5 to 4, as by mid-November, the hops had faded somewhat. So this so-called Winter beer is best in October."
"Exceedingly drinkability, but flavor forward. A truly wonderful beer."
"Highly recommended."
"When I first poured this 7yr. old beer it seemed almost leathery and dirty brown. As it settled in my pint glass it warmed up to a nice auburn color. The head retained the leathery color and was a good two fingers thick. The nose was sweet! Soft malt aromas with raisins and dates . The taste was right on target with the nose. It was sweet and fruity. The malts seem to have caramelized and left a sticky coat on my lips. On the finish I get a little bit of a metallic twang that I don't like. It is too sweet to drink very much at one time but to hold up for 7 years is impressive."
"D - Very enjoyable beer (even on a 85 degree summer day) with tons of rich roasty/toasty malt flavors combined with earthy and citrusy hops and a bit of spice. Smooth drinking - goes down easily. Think I'll be seeking this out again in the winter season."
"D: Very drinkable. Farily flavorful and very balanced."
"This was pretty good. Lots of festive feeling sweetness and spiciness, while the hop profile added some balance and slickness to the body, helping keep the drinkibility up for the most part. Plus there was just enough warmth to the body to help keep the chill off. This was my second Odell beer and I've still liking what they have to offer."
"Not bad, actually even enjoyable, this fits as a winter beer that definitely taken inspiration from imported, hoppy, English Winter ales."
"Not sure what to think of this one, very unique. Ultimately, I appreciate its complexities, find it to be quite drinkable while still maintaining a sense of 'richness' that I desire from a winter warmer, and would drink it again."
"Overall, one of the better winter warmers that I've had. Recommend. Rotation - not avail here in TX so had ummagum ship me an Odell sampler. This isn't one of my favorite styles so only have a few per year if at all. So one is enough for me unless best choice. More a style thing than a taste thing."
"D- A very drinkable beer! This is the type of beer I would want to drink during a tailgate or all day party. Is there any real difference. It's not filling and has lots of flavor for it's type."
"D- This was a nice winter warmer. These are not my favorite of styles but this one turned out to be very good. Glad I got to try this one out."
"Nice, deep toasty malts provide sweetness and heartiness in this beer and reminds me a little of good rye beers I've had. There's a slight slick of syrupyness in the mouthfeel, and there's a crisp green-apple and herbal hop presence in the aftertaste. A hint of cinnamon comes through what seems to be a strange metallic taste that I think could be the alcohol sneaking out from beneath other flavors. Overall feel is moderately carbonated, yet still a little on the thin side initially. Drinkability is good - pretty low overall ABV with some intricate and fun-to-figure-out flavors throughout."
"Drinkability - 5.0/5.0 - An excellent winter ale"
"A tasty, well-made beer, but I can't help but feel some disappointment at this being Odell's winter seasonal. I'll most likely pick this up again, but not when I'm looking for something rich and warming; this is more of a drink-three-or-four-in-an-evening kind of beer."
"D: Drinks pretty easy and could be possible to have another or three"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Soft and smooth carbonation; very clean finish overall with only a very slight coating on the roof; quite different from other winter warmers with a thicker/maltier mouthfeel, but this one has a much higher drinkability because it doesn't weigh you down; the ABV is pretty moderate as well and this could almost be a sessionable beer."
"Overall, this isn't really anything too exciting. Very middle of the road for craft beer."
"Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Tasty beer, pretty drinkable. Thanks for BuckeyeNation for sending this over."
"Taste is more of the same, as caramel, toffee and toasty malts are really all this beer has to offer. The malts are good, but there is not much else going on and it detracts from the overall appeal for me. I have been impressed by most of the Odell lineup, but this one is a pretty big disappointment."
"Pours amber with off-white head that is generous in size and retains rather well. Nose is soft with some toasty aromas and light caramel. Easygoing and appetizing aroma. More caramel and toasty flavors on the palate with less than average hopping for a winter warmer. Light to medium bodied and very, very drinkable."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a cherry brown color with a 3 inch tan head that recedes into a thin circle around the glass, leaving soap like lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is odd. Its a combination of a citrus IPA and a winter warmer. It reminds me of toffee and orange rind. Big citrusy notes up front - grapefruit and orange peel, finishing with caramel, toffee and chocolate. Kind of like a caramel orange. The flavor is very similar. The hops are a bit toned down, leading the malty body to take forefront. Caramel and toffee are big at first with grapefruit, tangerine and orange rind finishing. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. I wish it was just a bit of a bigger body. This is a great winter warmer and I will definitely be picking up another six pack soon."
"Very approachable, great for winter parties, or just sitting by the fire and watching a classic holiday flick. I enjoyed mine while watching the Nuggets on this snowy Denver night."
"Nice solid offering from Odell - I'd like to see more straight-forward winter offerings as opposed to spruce, spiced, and sketchy offerings. Kudos!"
"D: Very nice winter ale; I could drink a couple of these and watch the snow fall down; great beer"
"Drinkability - I like it, but there are no spices or anything to make it a holiday brew, and it just seems like a more mild version of Odell's IPA - which is great!"
"Poured a nice amber color with lots of highlights and a small white head. Nose is malty, earthy and very sweet. Taste is lots of malt, dark fruits and poerhaps some nutmeg. Mouthfeel is warming, thought the ABV was bigger than it was. tasted bigger and fuller."
"D- A good, easy drinker for social occasions, and a nice beer to return to every winter. I've would've liked to see this beer a little stronger and more assertive; this beer is too mild and thin to be the winter warmer for the Rocky Mountains."
"To me, Colorado winter beer IS Odell Isolation Ale."
"D-- Excellent. A great winter warmer that is at 6%. Different because there is no spice to it. Mostly malt and carmel. Has been my favorite winter seasonal for the 6 years and continues to amaze me everytime I have it. Can drink one and enjoy it or have 3 easily and just warm up."
"D - Very drinkable for the style. Has a great flavor and warmth for the winter months, but the body and balance make it a solid candidate for a session brew. I will definitely have to add this into the rotation this winter."
"Easy drinking and not all that high in ABV comparatively. This is a great candidate for a cask."
"The pour was very nice, classic for the style really with a nice light caramel color, good clarity here with a light carbonation bubbling up throughout the glass. A nice light head of white coming up and over the top settled down nicely into a thin film that covered the top. The aroma was rich caramel malts and a nice light sweetness, almost a nuttiness to it. Rich flavor, clean, crisp, clean. Nice light roasted caramel flavor with a light hop bitterness and a really nice and rounded out flavor. Smooth, easy drinking and very rich this was a very nice beer to sit down with at dinner and something that I would have no issue with having again."
"Conclusion: This is a good, tasty, Scottish-style ale...there's nothing wrong with it, it just doesn't wow...not O'dell's best, but definitely worth a try."
"D: for it being a beer I used to hate, I can actually see myself drinking more than one in a night. A tasty beer, well balanced, and goes down easy."
"Overall - The hops save this beer. It is still not my favorite style, but this is better than many other winter seasonals I have tried."
"D: Odell is quickly becoming my favorite CO brewery. This yet another excellent offering from them."
"Fairly thin and doesn't really stand out. An easy drinker but nothing I'll necessarily remember. Def. one of the lighter winter ales."
"Deep orange with compact yet lasting eggshell foam layering on the surface. Part of it's staying power was a result of the stiff texture of the foam. Reddish tinge, sticky sheets of lacing. Toasted malt aroma, very clean and dry. Toffee and bready malt flavors, complex taste like a blend of rye and pumpernickel. Dry bitterness, not a sweet one thankfully. Medium bodied, good level of carbonation. Overall a nice Winter Warmer with a savory feel, easily drinkable."
"I will drink this till its gone and am very interested to see how it will age I'll probably drop a 6 pack back to save soon."
"A very drinkable beer, quite enjoying it on this cold evening before heading to bed. Not my favorite Odell Brew but it's one that I will drink again."
"I honestly want to be an Odell fan boy, honestly! They make one of the best IPA's out there, and their pale ale is not too shabby either. Inevitable it seems, every other beer of their's is just mediocre or awful. This will go on my list of ""not even worth trying"" brews. So, if you're out there and curious, don't waste your time. Might as well pick up a 12 of natty and at least have a good time!"
"Pours a deep orange with an off white head. Nice retention. Malty nose with hints of dark fruits. Some esters. The taste is mostly of caramel with a hop backbone. Great mouthfeel and a heavier winter warmer for the season. I always enjoy this beer. I like to buy a six of it every year because of it's simplicity as a holiday beer."
"Amber/orange, a little bit of haze, almost an inch of head at first. Malty and floral smell and taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and medium carbonation. Very well rounded beer. All of the qualities are in sync with one another. Would make for a great sipper while sitting outside in a hot tub after a long day of skiing."
"D - good drinkablity overall"
"Drinkability is good except that it's not exceptional in any way. Just good all around. I remember enjoying this one very much the last two years but this time it's not doing it for me. It does get better as it warms but I haven't warmed to it quite yet."
"M & D - Good carbonation and enjoyable beer for the winter time season."
"Thanks to Oxymoron (even though it took me a while to get around to it) and to googzoid10 and welosiped, so that I could taste a fresher, somewhat hoppier version"
"D: since the weather has been warm I couldn't drink more than one or two. but in the winter, I could definitely climb into a six pack for the evening."
"This brew from Odell pours a dark amber color with a thick tan head. Not too much happening in the nose. There are some sweet candy malts and faint spices. I was glad to see a little more spice in the flavor profiel to comliment the seet malts. A medium body that has good carbonation. A drinkable winter warmer, just not as full as I like to see."
"Pours a nice slight hazy golden amber color, nice tiny fizzy off-white head, nice carbonation, not much sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, some nutmeg, spices, and caramel. The taste is malty, slight spice, nutmeg, and caramel. There is a nice bitterness to this brew. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very tasty winter warmer, recommended. Thanks Bill, I've been wanting to try this one for quite awhile."
"The drinkability is very good, you need to try this brew to be sure. Prosit und Zum Wohl., MK"
"a very good winter warmer.. a sleeper in the category."
"D - This is one odd brew. I'm not really sure what to think. I don't really think that I'd ever really buy a six-pack, but it's worth trying since it's so unique and earthy. I really don't like mineral flavors in my beer, and this has it in spades."
"D: Not a terrible brew, doesn't taste bad. Nothing spectacular."
"Pours a clear dark ruby with some head. Nose has syrup tones with heavy malt edges and a sweet edge. Flavor is robust. Hops present, but not powerfully there. Sweet edge is present and is slightly syrupy on the tongue after it dissipates. Feel is smooth with a touch of bubble. Extremely drinkable. An excellent winter warmer."
"This beer is priced above odell's everyday line and for the price, I would rather have a cutthroat porter or 90 shilling."
"For the non-hop lover who likes a smooth, fairly rich and drinkable, more malty ale, this one would fit the bill."
"D - A pretty good winter warmer. There are better, but this one will certainly do the trick."
"Appearance was beautiful; a nice copper red with abundant head. Aroma was non-existent. Flavor was definitely not outstanding...some maltiness, some sweetness, some rustiness, but nothing stands out. Mouthfeel was a bit thin and disappointing. I would not recommend this beer."
"I missed this one last year so I bought some as soon as I saw it. It has a nice caramel-red color with a bubbly malty, sweet cereal smell. Nice big mouthfeel, taste is weird, malty, malty, malty. Coats the tongue really well, some mild spice in the back.Can't really detect hops in this one."
"I really enjoy Odell's offerings. Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of this style. I remember last year trying Hibernation and Old Jubilation as my first Winter Warmers. Those were big beers and maybe I was expecting more here. I would say that this is a bit more drinkable than those others, but I'm not sure if that is the point of this usually higher ABV style."
"M&D - smooth, and rather palatable, a quality winter warmer, wish it was more available on the east coast"
"D - a quaffable nutty and smooth winter ale"
"A decent winter warmer and easily drinkable while sitting by the fire."
"D - I found this beer to be somewhat average. Nothing about it really jumped out at me. It's not a bad brew, but neither is it all that impressive."
"thanks to my bro for gifting this my way for x-mas."
"D - So far this is definitely my favorite winter warmer, and a great beer on a cold day (and perhaps year round). If you can find it, pick it up now."
"Tasty and not an overly spiced and sweetened winter ale. This is a rather superior winter ale for those who prefer bitter and woody to sweet and spicy."
"A woody malt brew, capped with a decent stab of winter spices. Big crisp and dry hop finish Im enjoying this brew, but with the plethora of winter warmers, I would look for others before this one. Still a solid performer."
"Dark brown in appearance with a quarter inch beige head. Sweet, nutty smell with a hint of hops. The strong tasted of a winter ale. One that has staying power if you should find yourself in the mountains. A fantastic beer from Odell's that seems to be the best of the Colorado seasonal winter ales. This one also reminds me of my friend Mike, who stated that he basically lives in that cabin on the front of the bottle. He visited FC in October and we isolated ourselves from my wife when we drank too much that night."
"Bottom line: This is an example of the style that may not be as complex as others but it's a darn good, smooth drinker that is worthy of your patronage. I recommend it."
"D: Overall a smooth and easy drinking winter warmer. Not a bad brew from Odell, though this could pack more of a punch."
"A nice taste. Starts as sweeter malt amber lager, good alcohol to warm you up. The sweetness is cut short by the hops. The biscuit and raisin are replaced with lemon and spice. Not too much for a good, clean finish."
"Overall, enjoyable beer. Not too heavy or strong in flavor or spice for a winter ale. Not a session beer, but multiple pints would be enjoyable ... would be a good friend in isolation ; ]"
"Cheers!"
"12 oz bottle, with another very nice looking Odell woodcut label, poured into an imperial pint glass. Not much of a head, only about a 1/4 inch thick, but the lacing was persistant. Color was a dark yet clear reddish brown. Smell is mildly wood-like, sort of like fresh cut pine or spruce. Bit of smokiness. Wood flavor in the taste comes through strongly, like a campfire. Spicy notes add to the smokiness. Slight hops tang. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a smooth warmth. As a Winter Warmer, it doesn't really pack a big punch, but that's ok. It's a very nice and relaxing beer. very good for just sitting back and watching TV."
"Medium bodied, easy to drink could help get you in the mood for some outdoor activites in the fall or recover from shoveling snow later on."
"Drinks good, but 2 would be about my limit. Good winter warmer, would go good with ham or fruitcake"
"The body is good with a full body feel. Not quite chewy though. I wouldnt exactly call this a Winter Warmer as the spices are blended more then stand out but a fantastic beer to drink."
"Drinkability: Definitely a very drinkable beer, but I'm not sure it has the complexity to carry itself as a winter warmer. Very little spice or development of sweet flavors in the malts. In a lot of ways this is characteristic of a rustic loaf of white bakery bread - definitely pleasant, but needs other things to bring it to life."
"cheers..."
"Drinkability: While this is drinkable, I will say I always expect and hope for more, but am always somewhat let down. I love the other Odell beers that I have had, but I just can't fully get behind this one. Still, it's worth a try, though."
"Pours a amber almost cinnamon color. Nice sticky head with little retention. Very sweet malty smelling with some other aromas in there that are hard to distinguish. Taste is malty sweetness maybe some caramel with a nice dry finish. The dry finish gives this beer a very good mouthfeel. It's drinkable and good to have once and awhile. I wouldn't drink this one regularly though. Many thanks to Dertbert for providing me the oppertunity."
"Drinkability/notes: Rather odd, somewhat like a tart brown ale. Thanks to Hardtarget for sharing this sample."
"Being that smell and taste are so closely linked I had a hard time enjoying this beer. I'm hoping it was poorly stored and I was an unlucky recipient."
"Worth a try."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable - this is a nice warming winter brew. I look forward to enjoying this in quantity once the weather turns cold."
"Caramel colored brew with nice white head. Good retention and lacing. Chocolate and caramel laden aromas with some earthy hops thrown in. Same chocolate and caramel come through in a hefty medium bodied brew. Nicely balanced with some earthy/grassy hops on the back end. Nicely done, without all the sweetness and spicing normally reserved for holiday ales. Went down smooth and easy and worth several."
"Taste is very similar to the way it smells although the fruitiness seems to be overshadowed by intense cinnamon and spiciness of the beer. I was kind of hoping for a bit more emphasis on the fruit rather than the spice. But overall a pretty decent winter warmer."
"Competely clear maroon body, big head fades fast and leaves a tattered curtain of lacing around the top of my Schell tulip. Smells malty, with tones of choclate and brown sugar, very doppley. Taste is extra sweet and accentuated by vanilla and cinnamon flavors. Hops are there, but not dominant, just ind of in the background. Slick, fairly thick mouthfeel. I like it, a good well-spiced warmer."
"Overall Impression: Not my cup of hop tea. No real malt tastes, not much spice to put it in a winter mood. An enjoyable beer, but a bit different. Big props to babydoc who set me up with the generous trade!"
"Smells of figs, toasted nuts, caramel, and spicy citrus hops. Not overly aromatic though. Hits the tongue with moderately sweet malt. Notes of toasted bread, nuts, rummy fruit, and toffee are evident. Mouthfeel starts out lively and then gets thicker toward the finish. Spicy and citrusy hops pick up into the finish and remain. Slightly warming for its abv, but I would need a little something more if I were cabin-ed up all winter. A nicely made beverage nonetheless."
"Pours a coppery amber with a tan head. The head recedes quickly, but a small patch of foam remains. Aroma is dominated by citrusy and earthy hops. Flavor, too was predominantly hops, with a nice bitterness in the middle. Finish was surprisingly sweet... but not overly so. Very nice body and mouthfeel. Pretty good rendition of a winter warmer. Definitely worth a try."
"Thank you babydoc for the sample."
"The heaviness of the flavors would probably keep me from drinking more than two of these in a night. So, not a session beer by any means, but this isn't exactly a style known for its 'drinakbility.' Well-worth a try or two on a snowy mountain eve."
"2004-2005 pours a clear copper-orange with a nice light brown head of big bubbles that lasts, nice lacing. Bready,earthy aromas, chocolate and caramel cookie flavors. medium bodied with a lightly carbonated soft mouthfeel, finishes dry. A nice winter ale, very drinkable."
"I wanted to like this, but I just can't get over the pronounced and bizarre herbal/medicinal finish. I'm hard pressed to finish this one."
"According to the date on the label, this particular bottle is approaching its second birthday and is none the worse for wear. I wish that I had come across a sixer instead of a single because I'd love to have plenty of this beer on hand throughout the winter. Every so often a good old-fashioned Midwestern blizzard comes howling across the plains. What better time could there possibly be to sip and savor an Odell Isolation Ale? This is beautiful beer."
"Pours an orange highlighted amber, somewhat cloudy, with a thin white head that leaves lots of lacing. Slightly alcoholic and fruity aroma (watermelon and peach), it has a light mouthfeel but a rather full flavor. I liked the taste -- somewhat peppery with a sweet aftertaste -- yet despite those flavors it was highly drinkable. Overall a nice brew, but I wasn't ""wowed""."
"This was ok."
"The Isolation poured a copper-orange with a thick and creamy white head that had pretty good retention. The aroma is kind of bready and toasted malt. It has a toasted malt initial taste with a very mild hoppy, piney finish. Overall, a very nice winter warmer that goes down very smoothly."
"...no, wait, that's what I thought 15 minutes ago...now, I'm starting to come around...yeah, I could do with more of this! Not a lot more, but a bit, at least...and give thanks to vitriola for the sample!"
"A malty smell comes with a warmer temp, but still not impressive. But the beverage as a whole is solid. Quite a tasty beer."
"On the pour a somewhat beclouded copper color with the head is middling in size and light tan in color and the texture frothy, the resultant lace a fine covering sheet upon the glass. Nose is quite sweet, over ripe fruit, toasted grains, light hints of caramel, start is richly malted, sweet, top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is light to medium in carbonation with the hops mild and pleasant and the aftertaste very dry, overall a decent drinking beer."
"2002-2003: Pours an amber colou topped by a tanned head. Looks quite good. The aroma is dominated by malts and hints of malts. Taste was fantastic. Really nice beer. The aroma reflects the taste and gives a combination of malty and hoppy taste. Goes down quite easily and has a sweet mouthfeel. Great beer!!"
"The body is smooth, if a bit sharp in its carbonation, and the finish is long, sweet and lingering. If only there were a touch more alcohol in this brew, Id say it was very nearly a perfect Winter Ale. As it is, Isolation Ale is not very warming, and winds up somewhere between a Strong Ale and a standard American Amber Ale. If I were to really go out on a limb, I'd say that Isolation ale tastes a lot like a French Biere de Garde."
"Thanks to prAna for this seasonal. I'm not sure if I would want to be isolated in a snow-covered log cabin for any great length of time with only this beer, but it's not too bad. Pours a standard amber color with a medium light tan head. Thin but sticky lacing. Aroma is spicy and sweet, with faint hops. Flavor contains malt and spices, but neither in good quantity. Sweet finish but it falls flat toward the end. I think a boost to the ABV would help this beer a bit."
"I really loved this beer. It was my first tasting of this brew, and I plan on picking up more sometime soon. It was different than other beers I have seen labeled as a winter ale. It was lighter in color, had less malty sweetness, and had a much more pronounced crisp hoppiness than most other beers that I have tried in this style. But, man, was it delicious."
"Bighuge thanx to Senior Shit and Jerry for isolating me with this Isolation Ale."
"A tasty winter offering from the nice people at Odell Brewing Co."
"Isolation Ale is quite drinkable and quite agreeable.  This beer was served to me with a thin, slightly off-white head that hung around awhile and laced very well it was an amber-orange color.  The nose wasnt powerful but sweet malt and hops could be detected along with some spice.  The flavors were a mix of hops, malt (sweet and caramel), and spice it was simple and kind of thin.  Nevertheless it was tremendously drinkable.  Go ahead and try one."
"Notes: Well balanced and a more than decent “Winter Warmer” style brew, aiming more for a “I’ll have another one” winter seasonal brew rather than a monster of a beer that weighs you down after one. I’d happily drink this one all through a cold blustery night."
