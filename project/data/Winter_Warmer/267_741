I can't resist their rustic labels so I keep buying their products, but they are very hop based and this one is no different. I like the pale hops and the caramel malts together, they create an interesting robustness that sticks around. I'd probably have this again on a cold winter's night.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Nov 10, 2014"

My only issue is that it's available so early that it's generally sold out by the time the holidays get here - maybe they could bump it back a month so it would carry over in to the new year.

Pours a dark amber color with an inch tall off white head that left some light lacing. Aroma is malty, lightly sweet, toasty, and just a hint of chocolate. Yum... This tastes delicious. This beer doesn't overload you with huge malty sugars, but the malts are the dominate aspect. Toasty, bready, lots of caramel, and like the aroma, there's just a touch of chocolate onthe long finish. Medium body, super easy to drink. Wow, I can't get enough of this. It's a malt-lover's dream without going overboard on the ABV and sweetness.

The head retained the leathery color and was a good two fingers thick. The nose was sweet! Soft malt aromas with raisins and dates . The taste was right on target with the nose. It was sweet and fruity. The malts seem to have caramelized and left a sticky coat on my lips. On the finish I get a little bit of a metallic twang that I don't like.

There's a slight slick of syrupyness in the mouthfeel, and there's a crisp green-apple and herbal hop presence in the aftertaste. A hint of cinnamon comes through what seems to be a strange metallic taste that I think could be the alcohol sneaking out from beneath other flavors.

This beer pours a cherry brown color with a 3 inch tan head that recedes into a thin circle around the glass, leaving soap like lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is odd. Its a combination of a citrus IPA and a winter warmer. It reminds me of toffee and orange rind. Big citrusy notes up front - grapefruit and orange peel, finishing with caramel, toffee and chocolate. Kind of like a caramel orange. The flavor is very similar. The hops are a bit toned down, leading the malty body to take forefront. Caramel and toffee are big at first with grapefruit, tangerine and orange rind finishing. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. I wish it was just a bit of a bigger body.

4.03,2.8,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The body is good with a full body feel. Not quite chewy though. I wouldnt exactly call this a Winter Warmer as the spices are blended more then stand out but a fantastic beer to drink.","Oxymoron","Oct 10, 2006"
3.16,-19.4,4,3,3,4,3,"Drinkability: Definitely a very drinkable beer, but I'm not sure it has the complexity to carry itself as a winter warmer. Very little spice or development of sweet flavors in the malts. In a lot of ways this is characteristic of a rustic loaf of white bakery bread - definitely pleasant, but needs other things to bring it to life.","expatsteve","Jun 25, 2006"

3.48,-11.2,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours a amber almost cinnamon color. Nice sticky head with little retention. Very sweet malty smelling with some other aromas in there that are hard to distinguish. Taste is malty sweetness maybe some caramel with a nice dry finish. The dry finish gives this beer a very good mouthfeel. It's drinkable and good to have once and awhile. I wouldn't drink this one regularly though. Many thanks to Dertbert for providing me the oppertunity.","wcudwight","Jan 08, 2006"

4.3,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Caramel colored brew with nice white head. Good retention and lacing. Chocolate and caramel laden aromas with some earthy hops thrown in. Same chocolate and caramel come through in a hefty medium bodied brew. Nicely balanced with some earthy/grassy hops on the back end. Nicely done, without all the sweetness and spicing normally reserved for holiday ales. Went down smooth and easy and worth several.","Dithyramb","Oct 16, 2005"
3.65,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste is very similar to the way it smells although the fruitiness seems to be overshadowed by intense cinnamon and spiciness of the beer. I was kind of hoping for a bit more emphasis on the fruit rather than the spice. But overall a pretty decent winter warmer.","LuckySevens82","Mar 09, 2005"
4.12,5.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Competely clear maroon body, big head fades fast and leaves a tattered curtain of lacing around the top of my Schell tulip. Smells malty, with tones of choclate and brown sugar, very doppley. Taste is extra sweet and accentuated by vanilla and cinnamon flavors. Hops are there, but not dominant, just ind of in the background. Slick, fairly thick mouthfeel. I like it, a good well-spiced warmer.","TastyTaste","Mar 02, 2005"
3.53,-9.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall Impression: Not my cup of hop tea. No real malt tastes, not much spice to put it in a winter mood. An enjoyable beer, but a bit different. Big props to babydoc who set me up with the generous trade!","HardTarget","Jan 08, 2005"
3.91,-0.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Smells of figs, toasted nuts, caramel, and spicy citrus hops. Not overly aromatic though. Hits the tongue with moderately sweet malt. Notes of toasted bread, nuts, rummy fruit, and toffee are evident. Mouthfeel starts out lively and then gets thicker toward the finish. Spicy and citrusy hops pick up into the finish and remain. Slightly warming for its abv, but I would need a little something more if I were cabin-ed up all winter. A nicely made beverage nonetheless.","alexgash","Jan 06, 2005"
3.83,-2.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a coppery amber with a tan head. The head recedes quickly, but a small patch of foam remains. Aroma is dominated by citrusy and earthy hops. Flavor, too was predominantly hops, with a nice bitterness in the middle. Finish was surprisingly sweet... but not overly so. Very nice body and mouthfeel. Pretty good rendition of a winter warmer. Definitely worth a try.","jimdkc","Dec 30, 2004"

I wish that I had come across a sixer instead of a single because I'd love to have plenty of this beer on hand throughout the winter. Every so often a good old-fashioned Midwestern blizzard comes howling across the plains. What better time could there possibly be to sip and savor an Odell Isolation Ale? This is beautiful beer.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 05, 2004"
3.68,-6.1,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Pours an orange highlighted amber, somewhat cloudy, with a thin white head that leaves lots of lacing. Slightly alcoholic and fruity aroma (watermelon and peach), it has a light mouthfeel but a rather full flavor. I liked the taste -- somewhat peppery with a sweet aftertaste -- yet despite those flavors it was highly drinkable. Overall a nice brew, but I wasn't ""wowed"".","jtfest","May 01, 2004"

Nose is quite sweet, over ripe fruit, toasted grains, light hints of caramel, start is richly malted, sweet, top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is light to medium in carbonation with the hops mild and pleasant and the aftertaste very dry, overall a decent drinking beer.","Gusler","Jan 02, 2004"
3.9,-0.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"2002-2003: Pours an amber colou topped by a tanned head. Looks quite good. The aroma is dominated by malts and hints of malts. Taste was fantastic. Really nice beer. The aroma reflects the taste and gives a combination of malty and hoppy taste. Goes down quite easily and has a sweet mouthfeel. Great beer!!","ipogios","Apr 14, 2003"
3.7,-5.6,4,4,3.5,3,4,"The body is smooth, if a bit sharp in its carbonation, and the finish is long, sweet and lingering. If only there were a touch more alcohol in this brew, Id say it was very nearly a perfect Winter Ale. As it is, Isolation Ale is not very warming, and winds up somewhere between a Strong Ale and a standard American Amber Ale. If I were to really go out on a limb, I'd say that Isolation ale tastes a lot like a French Biere de Garde.","TXHops","Apr 08, 2003"
3.28,-16.3,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Thanks to prAna for this seasonal. I'm not sure if I would want to be isolated in a snow-covered log cabin for any great length of time with only this beer, but it's not too bad. Pours a standard amber color with a medium light tan head. Thin but sticky lacing. Aroma is spicy and sweet, with faint hops. Flavor contains malt and spices, but neither in good quantity. Sweet finish but it falls flat toward the end. I think a boost to the ABV would help this beer a bit.","Dogbrick","Feb 23, 2003"
4.39,12,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I really loved this beer. It was my first tasting of this brew, and I plan on picking up more sometime soon. It was different than other beers I have seen labeled as a winter ale. It was lighter in color, had less malty sweetness, and had a much more pronounced crisp hoppiness than most other beers that I have tried in this style. But, man, was it delicious.","Quaffer","Feb 05, 2003"

3.83,-2.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Isolation Ale is quite drinkable and quite agreeable.  This beer was served to me with a thin, slightly off-white head that hung around awhile and laced very well it was an amber-orange color.  The nose wasnt powerful but sweet malt and hops could be detected along with some spice.  The flavors were a mix of hops, malt (sweet and caramel), and spice it was simple and kind of thin.  Nevertheless it was tremendously drinkable.  Go ahead and try one.","bditty187","Nov 12, 2002"
4.7,19.9,4,4,5,5,5,"Notes: Well balanced and a more than decent “Winter Warmer” style brew, aiming more for a “I’ll have another one” winter seasonal brew rather than a monster of a beer that weighs you down after one. I’d happily drink this one all through a cold blustery night.","Jason","Jan 28, 2001"
