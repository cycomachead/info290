The flavoring is savory enough to keep you coming back for more, and the spice is certainly there, but the wonderfully decreased pint night special pricing also helped quite a bit.  The beer went well with our jalapeño burger and chicken Caesar wrap, respectively, helping to quell any spice or savoriness from the meal.  Really, rather standard, but flavorful, aromatic, and hearty enough for season.","TheBrewo","Jan 27, 2015"

Taste is slightly sweet with hints of candy sugar, plum, and hops.  Can definitely tell the hops are chinook with the bit of spice.  Mouthfeel is on the heavier side and coats the mouth.  Overall a very nice winter warmer made better with the addition of fresh hops.  A wintertime staple.","BrownAleBollocks","Dec 04, 2014"

3.91,5.1,3.75,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Very interesting ""winter warmer"" to say the least. Total contrast in styles and I wound not qualify this as a winter warmer simply cause of the hop presence. Doesn't make this a bad beer but IMHO has too much going on that contrast and not accentuate. Looks great, smells even better with the usual spices of the season shining through. Taste is unique with a winter warmer with a hop backing that totally doesn't work together the way I imagined. Very thin mouthfeel again not expected. Then again when you throw all logic out the window and don't judge by style it's a damn fine beer. Go figure. I am gonna buy another sixer and let them rest for a while to let the hops mellow than re-visit.","Jekyll","Nov 08, 2013"

Nose starts with aromatic hops, and a mild festive spicing which features a touch of nutmeg along with a strong malty base. Taste is hoppy up front with pine and resin with a background of ginger and nutmeg. The spices are minuscule compared to the hop profile as this drinks more like an IPA than a winter warmer. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with a light body. Overall, an enjoyable brew but not a standout.","homebrew311","Dec 08, 2012"

The first 2 I had from the sixer tasted more like an IPA to me but the last few have been a little bit more spicy tasting.

4.05,8.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured a 12oz bottle into Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer reminds me more of a filtered English barleywine then a winter warmer. It pours a clear, orangey amber with a nice 2 finger head that faded away into just a slight rim around the glass, leaving the edges as clean as they were before I poured the beer in. The aroma is surprisingly hoppy with orange and grapefruit coming through followed by cinnamon, and what reminds me of roasted barley. The flavor is reminiscent of the aroma, but the malt plays a much larger role in the all around finish of the beer. A rich maltiness overshadows the hops so prevalent in the nose. Prunes, dates and other dark fruits pop up in the flavor profile, pushing the grapefruit to play second fiddle. The mouthfeel is a bit light for a winter warmer but doesn't really take away from the beer. This is one of the better seasonals that Boulevard puts out, and is something that I always look forward to each Christmas time.","hwwty4","Dec 01, 2008"

This has a spicy/tangy bite mid way that is quite enjoyable and last through the finish. Roasted almonds and cashews mix with orange rind and subtle caramel malting to create a most flavorful and unique offering. Medium bodied and prickly carbonation that is not overbearing keeps drinkability above average.","orangemoustache","Dec 01, 2008"

Sweet malts hit the nose and are checked quickly by the hop and spice aromas. Tastes a bit of spice and pine up front with an earthy tone toward the end. Hops are a bit understated compared to a malt essence that creeps around the edges of the palate. A slight hint of yeast peeks through. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and it goes down smooth.

I find most Winter Warmers to be dominated by alcohol but it's really not present in this one which makes it enjoyable.

3.88,4.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a deep reddish-brown color with a massive tan head with terrific retention. Sheets of lacing line the wide mouth glass - a beautiful beer. The nose is slightly candy sweet with hints of floral and herbal hops at the fore. The spicy notes really bring the Holidays to mind. This probably how a winter warmer is supposed to smell. The palate is wonderfully complex - a barrage of hops upfront, but quickly balanced out by a nice subtle sweet malt character that lends a great warm caramel and nut aspect to the beer. This beer is masterfully balanced - not a hop bomb or sweet to the point of cloying. The flavors play off of each other in a very nice way, leaving a complex yet accessible flavor profile. The mouth feel is very smooth, especially as the beer warms to near ambient temperature (probably the best serving temperature for this beer). A full-flavored and bodied beer, but not overly thick. I'd say this one is medium in mouth feel and really quite luxurious. The finish is dry with lingering herbal hops on the tongue. Probably one of the more 'drinkable' winter warmers I've sampled this season, and without a doubt one of the best as well. Very complex, yet not overbearing, flavors and an extremely well-crafted mouth feel - I have no reservations in recommending this beer to both the lover of the style and the drinker who is imbibing in a winter warmer for the very first time - substantial yet accessible. Very, very nice. Congratulations Boulevard - this may be your best so far, in my book.","beerphilosopher","Dec 23, 2007"

Flavors of sweet malt are followed by a dominant resinous hop presence. WIthout spicing, the piney-ness gives it a good holiday feel. Mouthfeel is moderate to full, with a touch of sweet stickiness and lovely carbonation. Very drinkable. It's refreshing to find Christmas beer's that don't rely on spicing.","goochpunch","Mar 11, 2006"

Taste is one great hoppy winter warmer once again thanking the beer gods that some brewers leaves out holiday spices and substitue semi sweet caramel malt profiles with yeasty bread chacter blended with a wallop of pine cone and citrus flavored hops, nicely done. Mouthfeel is medium bodied texture is silky smooth of course carbonation is perfect why mess it up now.

It has a nice hop scent that pretty much overpowers the rest of the malt aroma. It seems to be boasting of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. The taste is good. It has a complex flavor that screams hops, but is blended well with crystal and roasted malts. It goes down easy and finishes bittersweet with some residual malt sugars and a wonderful hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very smooth beer. It has excellent hop character and a well rounded malt bill; a good seasonal.","WesWes","Jan 18, 2006"

4.24,14,4,5,4,4,4,"Aw Jeez! (said like John Travolta). This stuff smells like a friggin' pine tree! It's head remains for quite a respectable amount of time. I'm sure it's being helped along by the wheat included in the malt. It's definitely a red chocolate color. The taste is complex yet understated and you really have to swish it around in your mouth to get the full impression on every part of your toungue. It's absolutely uncanny how much this smells and tastes like a pine tree. It should be tried just for that. It's slightly sweet on the finish and the pine taste does linger. It has quite a bit of body for a beer that is so smooth. A slight smoky flavor surrounds and binds the whole experience which is welcomed. A warming sensation becomes apparent and this beer has thus fullfilled it's destiny.","LordChesterfield","Dec 10, 2005"
4.15,11.6,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Aroma of piney Chinook hops, vinous oak barrel, caramel and biscuit malts. Similar flavors with dark fruit and just preceptable diacetyl upping the complexity. Full body that made the mouthfeel a dextrinous treat to hold on to before swallowing. Finishes toasty and sweet then the drying hops as an aftertaste. Almost an English style strong ale. This is what I was hoping for when I picked up the Christmas Ale from GLBC. Sometime all you are looking for is close to home.

I will definately drink more of this next year.","neonbrown82","Jan 30, 2005"

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"My second Boulevard, thanks to babydoc. This one pours a muddy brown(unfiltered) body with a 1 cm beige head that disperses some nice patchy lace. Aroma is malty and spicy, with notes of chocolate, caramel, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Some grassy hops are picked up in the background. Very pleasant in the mouth, with an ideal carbonation and tingly body. Taste is quite pleasant, with malty chocolate and caramel maltiness melding with grassy and pine hops, a hint of hazelnut, and some cinnamon and nutmeg. Although I cook with fresh spices, I have been deceived before by noting the definite presence of spices that were actually hops, as may be the case here. This is an excellent winter warmer that is quite well constructed. I wish Boulevard could expand their distribution a bit, so more of us could enjoy their fine brews.","merlin48","Jan 05, 2005"

Head is one finger slightly-yellow wheat, fading to a veil that lasts until the end. Nose is pleasant but not potent; spicy, flowery. Nice mouthfeel, with moderate carbonation yielding a creamy feel but faily dry finish. The taste is sweet malts and light spices; hops interrupt the sweetness to balance but not overpower it... Despite the ""added"" spices attributed to it by some tasters, the ingredients list only two-row barley malt, whole hops, and yeast. Very nice, not quite as hearty as I'd hoped, but certainly drinkable and one of my Boulevard choices.","babydoc","Dec 27, 2004"

4.05,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Whoa. Unlike any Boulevard selection I've had previously. Pours brown with a single finger head. Smells a bit spicey....some nut & chocolate, but perhaps some nutmeg? The big difference between this and normal Boulevard offerings is the mouthfeel and sweet malt. Thicker and sweeter. Medium-heavy mouthfeel and stamina building umph. Nutty and X-mas spice to taste. Plus, lotsa interesting flavors as it warms...licorice, hint of chocolate, nutmeg (clove?), and other holiday spices. The best selection from Boulevard I've tried yet (and I've tried them all repeatedly). Wish they could impart this mouthfeel and malt sweet to their pale ale.","mentor","Dec 14, 2004"

3.78,1.6,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark rose amber that is just slightly murky, and with a massive head that settles a bit, but sticks around nicely for some time.

Not a horrible one, but id turn to some other winter favorites before this one.","Tballz420","Nov 14, 2004"

4.25,14.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Best enjoyed at cellar temperature (not right out of the fridge!), Nutcracker pours a beautiful chestnut body with a reddish cast beneath a short cap of creamy light beige foam. The nose reveals a combination of light spice and delicate spruce or pine wrapped in a caramelish and slightly biscuity malt. It's medium bodied and its median carbonation lends a gentle zest to the tongue. The flavor is slightly richer than the nose suggests, but delivers the same basic profile with hops arriving up front and giving way to it's maltiness towards the finish. Cellaring this beer for a year, however, softens the hop presence and allows the malt to become more dominant.","NeroFiddled","Oct 21, 2004"

Taste has a nice little spice to it thats light of mint and ginger, cinnamon too. Malts are of toasty bread with just a hint of sweetness coming through at the finish where some lightly mixing herbal hops and spiced cracker-like dryness and woodyness lends a favorable finishing quality. Feel is medium bodied with a little tingle of carbonation that tingles on the tongue lightly in the finish adding to a bit of the dry finish. Took a bit of getting use to and was intregingly fun to drink.

Citrusy hops fade right away to a bready caramel flavor. Spices and fruitiness come in at the end. A little crisp in the mouth, maybe a little less carbonation would smooth it out. Definately a drinkable brew, though not my favorite from Boulevard. I'll probably pick up a sixer of this every year, but that's about it.

The nose is a fine blend of sweet, sugary malt and floral hops the yeast is noticeable. The flavors on the palate are, again, a fine blend of sweet, sugary malt (like candy) with some hops in the background (just a touch of bitterness). A note of citrus can be detected.

Finishes with barely discernable hops but a building fruitcake character and a flattish tone.

The aroma is a combination of piney Chinook and assertive, dark caramel and biscuit malt. Sweet and sprucelike. Mellow diacetyl surfaces as the beer breathes. Flavorwise, the initial moderate hop bitterness fades and allows rich, chewy caramel and biscuit to dominate. Mild dark fruit esters and butterscotch provide some complexity. Caramel malt presence builds from a simpler sweetness into a deeply caramelized, slightly burnt impresion w/ lingers on the palate agreeably. Subdued, but discernibly piney hop flavor. Full in body and quite dextrinous considering its average strength. Finishes toasty and cleanly sweet. Nutcracker is quite a flavorful and rich brew that belies its low apparent strength. I have doubts this is only 5.3% ABV. Flavorwise, it more is akin to a strong ale rather than an American brown. Excellent drinkability. This is the 2002 release.","marc77","Nov 19, 2002"
