"O:  if Rahr labelled this a ""porter," I wouldn't know enough to say different; very thin mouthfeel, standard taste and smell notes of roasted/charred malt, subdued sweetness, subdued hop profile, none of the spices you run into in many American-made winter warmers ... the 8.5% ABV is the only tip here that this isn't a simple porter; frankly, I love it because it's one of the easiest drinking higher ABV beers I've run across.  fans of the big spicy, robust winter warmer might frown on this lighter take on the style."

"12 oz bottle was bottled October 11, 2014.  This beer is very well balanced, but in my opinion must be enjoyed at 60-65 degrees.  Pours a beautiful beige thick 2 finger head that stays for a while and dissipates into a thin film .  Dark black cherry color that shows some light through, but appears to have no sediment.  Smells of roasted chocolate and German style malts.  Taste at slightly over 60 degrees:  Chocolate, dark ripe fruit, very subtle English hop twang. Tastes thin and watery at fridge temp, but full flavored, rich, and creamy at (Texas) room temperature (60-65) - 8.5% ABV is barely noticeable.  Just enough carbonation.  Overall delicious English style dark winter warmer from Rahr & Sons Brewery."

"good taste for an 8.5abv beer .Has a citrus note through the dark rich flavor."

"Mouthfeel is light to medium, almost lager-like, which exposes the brewer's well-known preference for lagers. Exists somewhere between a clean brown ale and an old ale. Bottles are better than keg; I could drink this all year round."
"O-a good mix of everything with a good balance. A great beer from Texas."

"I keep going back and forth on Rahr and Sons Winter Warmer. It is soft on the nose, but the sweet malts are enticing. The palate is not that complicated, but I really enjoyed the figgy, charred flavors. I think what would have really helped this beer was a better carbed mouth feel and stronger nose. It is a good beer, just not a great one."

"O: Good. Hides alcohol well. Very nice winter warmer."
""
"Overall a good beer to break out of the dark beer season away from the normal like Guinness, Shiner, and the group. Nice flavor and pretty easy to drink. I've had many different beers. This one isn't my favorite but I would grab it again."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, good head, and solid lacing. Nose is a very good combo of sweetness and coffee. Nutty, roasted coffee with a touch a bittersweet-ness. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, unknown freshness date. This pours a dark brown with a nice tan head. The smell is higher on caramel and toffee than some, good stuff. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good, lots of caramel, some toffee, nuts, spices, not bad."
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is also very pleasant with a mild carbonation and a full bodied brew. That combo makes it seem like a thick drink but one that you can sip on all night. Flavorful and extremely drinkable."
"A really good beer overall. Really easy drinking, goes down smooth, and the flavors really blend well and change as it warms. I'm really enjoying this one."

"O: This is by far one of the better beers I have ever had from Rahr. Better luck next year."
""
"Warming without the alcohol showing up. Nice cocoa and roasted malts with a solid strain of nutty yeast to glue everything together. The mouthfeel was the weak link but it wasn't a deal breaker. Everything tasted young and fresh. I'm gonna try and out one away for a year or so."
""

"Overall I like the flavor profile and the creamy ""warming"" flavors; if there were a bit more carbonation, it would be a real winner. Spice isn't overdone which is a huge plus for me. Good, recommended if you can find it."
"This was my first winter warmer (and my first review) but if this one is indicative of the style I will be trying more. Thankfully I live 10 minutes from the brewery so next year I will be at the head of the line for this brew."
"Would love to try this one on tap sometime - a great example of a winter warmer."
"Impression: Fantastic take on a style favorite. I like the lack of holiday spice in this, and the mild barrel notes. Recommended."
"This is a very satisfying and enjoyable winter warmer. I'll definitely be looking for it in the future. It's great to have such excellent craft beers being made in my home state."
"Thanks, FreeVerse, for the opportunity"
"D - Not the best winter warmer I've had. I'm glad I got to try it. Thanks Greg!"
"D- The muted flavors and lack of real alcohol sting makes this beer a easy drinker. Nothing over the top but nothing bad at all either. It is what it is and that is a average a little above average beer."
"Enjoyable for the most part. Not the best Winter Warmer, but worth a try."
"This beer is medium bodied and smooth, with a well hidden ABV contributing to drinkability."
"Poured into a Sam Adams tasting glass. Took about ten seconds for a caramel colored head to foam. First smell is of dark chocolate, almost semisweet chocolate chips. Taste is lighter than expected, malty with a mellow chocolate and raisins. Finish is sweet, but not milky which would have helped balance out. Surprised by the 8.5abv. Certainly didn't taste like that under the hood. Stuck between a porter and a stout, I am unsure how best to categorize it, except to say it would be a fine beer to match up with food."
"Would I recommended? sure."
"Winter seasonal from Rahr & Sons, our only local brewery in DFW that actually bottles. This one is typical for Rahr, decent, but doesn't stand out. Pours a dark brown, blackish, purple-y tinged color with some head that leaves quickly. Smell is pretty good, some seasonal spices (nutmeg), dark fruit and hops. The main flavor is the sweet, toasty malt. It isn't overly sweet but the malt is the main feature here. Some of the spices in the nose show up but are hidden. Thin mouthfeel and sticky. Easy enough to drink but just not exciting to drink. I hope the whiskey barrel version is a lot better."
"Overall this a a solid winter warmer, cannot detect the 8.5% abv in the feel or flavor at all,I can start to feel the effects near the end of the glass, but never would have guessed it that high on taste alone."
"D - Alcohol presence is extremely well masked, does not drink like an 8.5% beer. Thin mouthfeel enhances this easy drinking sensation. I could see unknowingly plowing through a few of these and ending up in trouble. Flavors are good but not very strong, enjoyable overall, but memorable."
"M/D - A touch on the thin side which is disapointing, but still well balanced flavors. Still very easy drinking and the ABV does provide some winter warming for sure."
"This is my first exposure to Rahr & Sons Brewing Company beer. Winter Warmer is pretty good, but doesn't really stand out. Everything about it seems a little too tame. It's tough to distinguish yourself in the winter warmer category. If you want to achieve that goal, you've got to be bolder than this. More of everything is in order. On its face, this isn't bad beer, but it needs work to reach the next level. Nonetheless, I'm happy to try it out. I love beer that's new to me. Thanks, Joseph."
"It should be noted that this beer appears to vary in carbonation. I have had several of these this year and the carbonation has varied from almost non-existent to medium. The carbonation definitely helps the beer."
"It was drinkable but there are much better winter warmers out there."
"Pours a dark brown with a pencil thin off white head leaving no retention. Aromas of molasses and subtle holiday spices. Sweet taste up front-caramel with some nuttiness and hints of spices. The spices are nicely balanced, never dominant. Light carbonation and body, watered down consistency. Average drinkability, the aromas and flavors are nice, but the feel ruins this one."
"Poured into a pint glass dark black with very little head. I could tell the carbonation with this one was going to be an issue. And it is. The smell is strong of carmelized nuts with a slight oak hint. The taste is about the same as the scents, only the carmelized flavors are kind of lacking. The mouthfeel to me is terrible, the carbonation is almost nonexistent. It has a watered down feel to it. If they could get a better consistency on this, the over all drinkability would be great, but it doesn't so it's not."
"I almost bumped the taste score up to 4.5. Small head on this holiday brew but the appearance and color of the body made up for it. Good lacing in thin sheets around the glass, nice and dark for the style. The nose wasn't especially robust but offered malty, fruity notes with mild spices like vanilla bean and nutmeg. The taste is very heavy, malty with a small hop presence leaving no real bitterness to this beer. Taste brings a brown ale quality with a big dose of raspberries in the middle. The fruit presence is concentrated and very noticeable adding a tartness to the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy, heavy and the carbonation is muted and perfect. Drinkability is up there with the best in this style, for a beer that,s 8% it was gone quickly. Only bought a single but I recommend anybody buying this one get the six-pack."
"Pours a dark reddish brown colored body, with a foamy, average creamy off-white color head. Malty aroma, with some roasted notes. Has a watery palate. Some roasted taste. Not too bad tasting, a little malty sweet. A little hot."
"Frothy, thinner then expected, with a drying finish. Alcohol was very quiet. I could of done with something a little heavier. Middle of the road, but still pretty soft & soothing. :)"
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the opportunity to try this one. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured the color of cola with a loose, half inch, tan-colored cap. Head eventually recedes into a creamy, intact skim. Thick slashes of lacing were exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals chocolate malt and toffee. Taste consistent with nose, but also some dark fruit and a roasted quality in the mix. Mouthfeel was a little thin and quite fizzy/gassy. Decent drinkability - fairly flavorful with a well-hidden abv, but too much carbonation makes it difficult to drink more than one or two at best."
"This is my favorite bottled beer from Rahr and the Bourbon Barrel version is even better if you can get a glass of it. Hopefully they bottle the Bourbon version in 2009 instead of making it draught only. HINT HINT!"
"Picked up at Hyde Park Market in Austin. Surprised to find it in August. Poured muddy and ruby. Almost purple. Soft half inch head. The head stayed the entire drink. Dark fruits, raisins in aroma, some smoke, peet as well. Spicy, but a flat spiciness, not sharp. Malt forward, smoky malt flavor. Subtle fruit flavors as well. Smooth mouthfeel, almost silky. Flavor, aroma, mouthfeel all come together to make a nice beer to take your time with."
"Over all this is a great beer with the taste making up for any of the other shortcomings. My only regret is that I did not share with my friends here. Sorry guys..."
"It pours a very dark red colour with some ruby highlights around the edge of the pint glass. A nice off-white head that sticks around a long time and leaves plenty of good lacing. The aroma is typical winter warmer - lots of spice, raisins, dried apricot and dark roast malt. Those are all backed up on the tongue and with a very dry, rather bitter finish. Just the way I like it, but maybe not to everyone's taste. The body though... rather a let-down. It's very thin for this kind of beer. It should be heavier. Not a bad beer all the same and one that I'd drink again, and I reckon it might benefit from some careful cellaring for a year or two."
"Verdict: To be frank, I'm a little confused by this beer. Rahr's website list this as full-bodied, and that's certainly what you'd expect from a Winter Warmer, but the body just fails to measure up. So while it's certainly not a bad beer, it's not a particularly good one either."
"I remember not liking this beer as much when I tried it on-tap, but the flavor profile is quite good out of the bottle. Dusty chocolate intermixes with holiday spices and raw, leafy hop notes. Alcoholic warmth and toasted, nutty malts hit the back of the palate. A bit unbalanced towards the finish, but this is a damn tasty winter warmer. Mouthfeel is crisp and highly carbonated, with a drying finish that thins out an otherwise medium body. Good beer, and a candidate for aging -- I could see myself enjoying this beer even more after a few years in the cellar to allow the hops and booziness to mellow just a bit. Well done, Rahr & Sons."
"Pours black with reddish tinge and a thick beige head. Roasted malt and slight hop aroma. Hop flavor up front with sweet Chocolate roasted malt flavor followed by hop bitterness in the finish. Good balance between sweet malt and hops. Can not detect the alcohol in this beer. very delicious and drinkable."
"After looking through the other reviews of this beer seems odd that mostly everyone else detected a lot more aromas , dont know what happened with my bottle"
"Overall seems somewhat uninspired for a winter warmer."
"Drinkability - More please? This serving was gone far too quickly. It only improved as it warmed from the original keg temperature. I think it was best around 55 degrees if I were to wager a guess."
"Probably not something I will get again, but it has merit. If you like stouts then this may be right up your alley."
"Fairly drinkable, not a bad beer. For the ABV% its pretty easy to throw this one back. Definitely on the malty side of winter warmers."
"Drink it now... smooth stuff. Robust, hearty, nutty, sweetness turns to dry. Malty, rich, husky...a solid wintry ale. Full-bodied and staifying. Nice one."
"Roasty malts are the main show in the flavor as well. Toasty maltiness, high carbonation and hop bitterness are aplenty to help balance it out. Fruitiness nearly dissapears in the tasting. Has a nice creamy, fresh feel to it. A nice job balancing winter warmer heartiness and alcohol with smoothness and drinkability. I do believe this is my favorite offering from Rahr, I will buy this again next winter!"
"D-Heavy malt finish without the general support needed to make it a go to beer, but strikes me as less of a winter seasonal and more of a specialty brew."
"My first winter warmer and I expected more taste..."
"This is one of the better Rahr efforts, in my opinion. Their Bucking Bock is nice, but I think this better suits the style they're trying for. A very nice, well-balanced winter warmer. Not heavy-handed or faint of heart, this really comes across well overall. And at almost 8% ABV, the high alcohol is masked remarkably well. This could almost be sessionable. Well done here."
"D - I like this. It isn't the most pronounced or extreme tasting winter warmer, but it's hitting the spot and it's pleasant to drink. Would drink again"
"Great Winter Warmer from the local Fort Worth brewery."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Drinks easy for the ABV, but not that great a winter warmer. Maybe its because I'm sitting here watch the snow come down on a spring day, but these seems like it's built for Texas winters versus real winters. Come on Rahr, I know y'all can do better!"
"Cheers."
"Poured into a pint glass, This beer poured a black color with a tan 2-finger head. Malty overtones are in the overall scent of this beer and the roasted malt flavor really warms a body up on a cold december night.The mouthfeel of this beer is slightly heavy which adds to the overall warming factor. This beer is definatly worth the trip to the store and will keep many a winter chill away."
"Drinkability: Flavorful, but not overly strong."
"Rahr in Ft. Worth is cranking out some good brews and this one is no different. Pours a dark, almost chocolate color. Faint aroma of malts and grains, not much. No lacing left in the glass. Taste is of light sweets with malts. Very little carbonation and light on the tounge. Very drinkable and I bet is great on draft. Would rate this higher if had a little more flavor. Quite enjoyable given the higher %."
"Drinkability: A decent drinker, I was worried that is was left over from winter and may be a little old. I think this still had a litttle life left in it. At $8.99 a six pack I could not see myself purchasing this on a regularly basis in the winter, but I will not have that choice as this is not available to me (unless I have to make another trip to Ft. Worth)."
"Well done Rahr (and mwedge)!"
"Could be fuller in the mouth, maybe with more aggressive maltiness, but these are minor quibbles. This is a very pleasant winter drink, and it's not half bad even when it doesn't feel at all like winter anymore (which you'd better get used to where they brew it). Solid."
"It pours out almost black with a thin tan head that is here & gone. The smell is almost coffee-like with notes of spice - nutmeg & a hint of cinnamon. The taste is much more roasted than I expected for a winter warmer. It is almost a cross between a coffee porter and a warmer. It has that wassal-like spice of a warmer overlaying the basic dark roast of the malt. The mouthfeel is creamy but light. The lightness makes it much more ""refreshing"" than you'd expect of a beer of this color and flavor intensity. The drinkability is great. I had this at the brewery for my first and quickly returned to the sample bar for my second. I would have kept on had they not floated the keg. Fritz has created an interesting twist on a classic style & executed with his usual quality & style. A great warmer!"
"Thinner medium body with decent carbonation. Dry aftertaste. Going down really easy. I am really going to miss all of these winter warmers when spring rolls around. Thanks, Jim, for this sample."
"This is a fairly tasty winter warmer from Rahr and Sons. Not the best brew they have, but certainly not bad. Also, the alcholol content of this beer is damn strong, so it really warms you up fast!"
"Alright, not best Winter Warmer. Enjoyable but could be stronger or more complex. It just doesnt do much. Rahr needs to assert itself as something other than just that local brewery from Fort Worth."
"Recommended for a night where one or two beers is in order."
"Pours out a dark brown, almost purple, with ruby hues. As with all Rahr beers, the head retention isn't there. Head starts off small and in seconds, is just a ring. No lacing. Smells of artificial cherry, from the toasty malts, roastiness, alcohol and a bit of grain. Flavor is at first roasted malt, which leads into some slight fruitiness: mostly apple and pear. Not entirely unlike their lagers, it seems. I get a little chocolate out of this. LITTLE. Finishes a bit too clean and watery for my tastes. Strange, but it has a bit of a brothy flavor to it. Where's the alcohol? Mouthfeel is slightly tingly, which is a good thing, but this is entirely too thin, especially considering the high abv. I'm not crazy over this, but it's not a drain-pour neither. This seemed to have more character on tap, but nevertheless, this is way too simple and thin, which is dangerous considering the alcohol content."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with ruby highlights and a short creamy head. Nose is toasted malt along with a fainter nuttiness and bit of chocolate in the background. Taste is caramelized malt and a bit of brown sugar along with semi-sweet dark chocolate and a mild hop bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden. A very nice winter warmer!"
"This is a good beer but the bitterness from the roasted malts builds up to much to have more than one consecutivly."
"Medium body, slightly chewy, with low to moderate carbonation. Balance leans towards the malt, but the hops show up in the finish to even things out. Alcohol is pretty well hidden in the aroma & taste, but there is a nice subtle alcohol warming. Good effort, and certainly something I'l have again."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Maybe a little sweet for some, but it is still nicely balanced by a touch of hops. Mine was served at cellaring temperature. Highly recommended, probably one of my favorite of the Winter Warmer style so far."
"A nice strong winter beer."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium, almost lager-like, which exposes the brewer's well-known preference for lagers. Exists somewhere between a clean brown ale and an old ale. Bottles are better than keg; I could drink this all year round."
"Nice and smooth from the start. A slight nutty bitterness along with toasted malt round out the flavor. Hops are vaguely present. The beer has an appealing presence on the palate and the alcohol doesn't hinder the drinkability in the least. I only bought a single not being overly optimistic I'd like this, but I wouldn't have any problem drinking another. Kudos to Rahr."
"Very nice beer, after the disappointing Bucking Bock. This shows excellent craftsmanship."
"Rahr's winter warmer is a bit darker than the others I've had. It is a mirky almost-black beer with little head and only a light roasty chacolate aroma. At first this beer offers up mellow ale fruitiness, and hop bitterness that is quickly overtaken by intense caramel, that morphs into light chocolate. The sweetness only lasts a few seconds before light roasted flavor is overtaken by what seems to be a Rahr signature, a light grain astingency that I fortunately find pleasing. Aftertaste is of very light tobacco. This an intersting brew and I must give Rahr props for hiding all the alcohol here without a trace. Mouthfeel is light and creamy with low carbonation."
