Actually I stand corrected, there’s nothing better than free, GOOD beer! This beer is bready, sweet and leaves a bit of cinnamon spice on the tongue, but it isn’t overwhelmingly sweet as are the majority of winter warmers that I’ve tried. It’s just about Spring time but not quite and this is a pleasantly timed winter beer on a cool night — after a VERY hard day of work — while watching Louisville battle for their second championship win in a row!","RummyRedbeard","May 24, 2013"

About an inch of off-white head develops and hangs around for some time, forming pillowy patches as it dissipates. Patches/strands of bubbles lace the glass. The aroma is of english malt, date, vague citrus (predominantly orange), caramel, cocoa nibs, and german lager yeast/spices. The taste begins with the english malt and lager flavors, moves into citrus and muddled spice, and finishes with a strong caramel malt, dark fruit, and faint chocolate presence. It is a bit underwhelming at first, but more impressive on the finish. Mouthfeel is of mild carbonation (a touch more wouldn't hurt), smooth texture, and a bit dry/syrupy on the finish (not overly so, but noticeable). Overall, a good winter warmer that I'll enjoy sipping on for the rest of the evening.","eclipse54","Dec 08, 2011"

4.03,4.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"22 oz. bottle, poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass (a couple of times). Has a big frothy head sort of a creamy light orange color. It sticks around for awhile and produces some very generous lacing to it. The lacing really adds to the effect on this one, it sticks to the glass extremely well. The beer itself looks a little lighter than several winter warmer's I've had, but still quite nice looking. A light amber color at first and when held to the light looks orange with a medium haze to it. I've seen good looking IPA's, even DIPA's look like this in the past, an interesting approach. The smell is good for a winter warmer. Pine hops stand out the most, but you can tell it's very well malted as well, caramel if I'm not mistaken. Most are generally very malty, but this takes a more well balanced approach. In the taste you get more of a malty flavor. Sweet malts, caramel and chocolate well roasted and then a mild pine and citrus blend of hops, tastes even a little herbal. Mouthfeel is good, could be great if it was a little heavier/bolder. Medium overall with a nice clean bitter finish from the hops and very drinkable. Another solid brew from Berkshire.","AndyAvalanche","Mar 01, 2010"

The taste was dominated by complex layers of different kinds of malts. The taste had a buttery flavor to it, plus a pinch of sweetness and a pinch of nuttiness. However, there was a hop bitterness that balanced the flavor. That being said, the aftertaste, which lasted for a long time was a little stale to me, and tasted a little wooden.

The body was quite smooth-- perhaps it could have used a tad more carbonation-- and the malt was front and center. The alcohol level was just high enough to add some warmth-- it was just right, in fact. Still, I felt like something was missing. Perhaps it could have used a little bite? More hops to give it a little boost? This was almost monochromatic. A little more balance in the taste would vault this into the A level for me.

The taste is very nice in that you'll find a nice balance between the hoppy dryness and the malty sweetness, laid over a spicy base as listed above. The beer is light to medium bodied and decently carbonated. There is some caramel, and flattish cola hints in this beer, which is typical of spiced beers that begin to settle a bit.

Smooth and extremely drinkable. Nice malt and hop flavor balance. Well constructed flavor that leaves me wanting more. I enjoyed this brew to the last drop and I would certainly enjoy another. Great winter warmer offering with a nice full body. Another hit from BBC for me.","bigone4","Nov 27, 2006"

3.7,-3.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer recommended by a friend at Colonial Spirits, I've been wanting to try another brew from Berkshire since trying the Imperial stout last year, and he has never lead me wrong before so let see what this beer is all about. It pours a candied orange, similar in color to pencil shavings. It leaves a very thin white head thats semi-sticky but not really clinging to the glass. The smell of this beer is surprisingly fruity, peach, grape, citrus. The hop essence in the nose is almost non present. As I taste this beer the hops let me know there in this ale, then a fruit essence hits your palate then leaves quickly replaced with some spices cinnamon, nutmeg, corriander and finished with a squeeze of hop bitterness. This is a nice ale one that is refreshing and I could drink all winter.","Franchise","Jan 08, 2006"
3.98,3.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours a very clear copper color with a head that dissipates quickly. While drinking I notice not much of a trace remains on the side of the glass. The smell is certainly not strong but I get the faint smell of spice and alcohol. The taste is quite enjoyable, malty in nature but certainly enough hops for balance with an overall holiday spice throughout. I like how this beer feels in the mouth with some carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. It will not be a chore to finish this bomber. Another fine Berkshire product.","mcowgill","Dec 25, 2005"
4.15,8.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Crystal clear copper colored with a tightly bubbled, very thick beige-orange head that leaves a quarter inch of foam suspended. Aroma is sweet malt and spice, a bit of hops, and sweet fruit. Flavor delivers an upfront puckery bitter, nice and hoppy with citrus but not over the top, followed closely behind by sweet malt and cinnamon, some ripe pear. Mouthfeel is full, but fairly tingly with carbonation. Oily webs of lace run down the inside of the glass. Very tasty, very drinkable.","far333","Dec 13, 2005"

Poured a thick mahagony in color with a slight thin and creamy head. Flavor is havey on the malts and has a creamy taste going on. Slight hop towards the back end. The spices are very much so present but it is as if I am tasting them through cheese cloth. They are fairly muted. Full body and creamy mouthfeel. The spice kind of hand out around my teeth.","MuddyFeet","Dec 04, 2005"

4.14,7.8,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,5,"distinctively dark, amberlicious. lacing all over the glass in little specks.. and boy does this pack some serious whiffs. green hoppiness with hints of xmas pine and gingerbread dough. this sure gets me in the wintery mood. light mouthfeel and body with a big spicy profile. first thing i notice is a sharp, licorice-like bite in the finish. my tongue is left coated with a sugary sweetness, this is where the maple-infused gingerbread comes in. after-mouthfeel is creamy and tastes like i just ate said cookie. repeated sips bring out a little unwanted bitterness around the belly of the gulp.. almost like a stale hop or waxy, burnt wood.. but maybe that's part of the warming winter warmer warmth. tha bitterness seems to perk up with repeated drinking.. like a toasted cinnamon stick. overall, this beer is mad complex for its lack of weight and a nice, drinkable holiday beer. bbc continues to impress and this beer seems to be getting better and better with time.","goodbyeohio","Nov 28, 2005"

3.98,3.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Beautiful amber gold in hue with a ruby-purple influence, especially when backlit. The color is very regal. Modest haziness. The head was slightly off-white in color, at the apex the foam was one finger in height, sadly, it faded quickly to a thin, soapy collar. What a bummer! I mean damn the color is lovely, I wish it had better head retention. There was some subsequent lacing; it was very spotty and hardly noteworthy. This beer looks very nice. The nose is soft, the potency is low; it takes a hard sniff to entice this beer to speak to me. I get an interesting dichotomy. The malt is stronger than the hops and the malt has a simple English flair to it with a sweet, slightly roasty tone and a kiss of caramel. The hops are kind of spicy, muted though, with just a tickle of earthiness. In fact the hops seem German. The two countries are not a war; there is a good harmony in fact. The nutty aromas grow in time; I even get a hint of fruit (it is an ale after all). I like the nose; there isnt much to it though. Inviting but the nutty aroma gets a little loud for me. Im not going to lie; sometimes the moniker Winter Warmer worries me. It seems the title is too vague and too many of the beers follow suit. This offering, after the first couple sips, put my mind to ease. Even with that said, and dont get me wrong, this beer is good, there isnt that much stuff to really grab me. The malt backbone is the focal point of the palate; there are enough malt flavors for me to care, some roastiness, some sweetness, some caramel influences, and even a tickle of biscuit at the back. Even with all those tastes it seems to be lacking a little richness. Im such a dick. I mean there isnt any wrong with it, I just want something more; it needs another layer. The hops offer some spiciness that pierces the malt perfectly. Bitterness is firm and moderate. Nutty. It is lightly fruity too; hints of pine. Random kisses of sugar. This beer has excellent balance, the palate is plenty articulate and it is saying all the right things! The flavor profile is good. Medium in body, the carbonation is moderately low but quite fitting for this beer. The mouthfeel is not big or bulky; I guess this can be expected because the abv is modest for a winter seasonal. Pleasant mouthfeel. This beer was very drinkable. I mean very! Im enjoying every ounce of the bomber. This is yet another beer from BBC that is very quaffable. They can sure brew a beer I want to drink! Thank you ppoitras for the bomber, this was yet another great addition to Secret Santa 2004.","bditty187","Feb 08, 2005"
3.95,2.9,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a deep orange almost copper color with a light white head. The nose is super fruity for this beer giving off some citrusy orange, strawberries, grapes and just a bit of hop. Initial flavors give off a creamy mix of caramels and fruity flavors. Peaches and strawberries are the closest things I can compare these flavors too. The finish is nicely hoppy and slightly bitter, with a nice citrus tone. There is also a bready tone right at the end. Overall this is a nice winter seasonal considering that most brews are big bruiser impy stouts or something of the sorts. This is a more subtle full flavored brew that just works well","bigbeerdrinka","Jan 23, 2005"

Very nice hops amount and it does not go overboard at all. Subtley sweet as well. Unique for brown ales I have had in the past, this one is definitely my favorite. Its balance, smoothness, and consistency are really quite good.","aquatonex","Nov 10, 2004"

3.91,1.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big ol' inch tall tan colored head on top of a quite effervescent reddish brown ale. Head is very dense, and leaves foamy lace throughout the drinking experience. Aroma is a malty, with a touch of alcohol. Taste is similar to a bitter, with a small little kick of EtOH at the end. Also a bit of fruit flavor skulking around, not quite identifiable to me, which gives it a refreshing crispness I didn't really expect from a strong ale.
