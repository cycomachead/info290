"Pours a dark brown color with a white head.  The aroma has a lot of malts, unfermented sugars, fruit and alcohol.   The taste starts off with a bit of dark fruits, turning nutty, wheaty and a bit strong.  The beer is damn smooth, more than likely from the oat additions in brewing.  Brewed with rye, sage, caraway, juniper and chestnuts, they meld together to form a unique flavor but everything is so balanced it is almost non-distinct.  The beer is full bodied but very smooth on the palate.  Soft, prickly carbonation makes for a smooth drink (the beer poured from the tap just a bit heady).  Overall, this would certainly be considered a success, and apparently this was a collaboration between Nøgne Ø, Stone and Jolly Pumpkin.  Its not a sour, thats for sure, sorry Jolly Pumpkin fans.  It is, however, a very good beer!"

"22 oz beer aged approx 6 months, poured into tulip hardly any head.lots of big bubbles stuck to the bottom.no lacing. Dark brown root beer colored. Smell of candied ginger, mint, cola, berries. Complex, taste, starts of slightly salty n sweet, menthol laced with a light bodied mouthfeel for a holiday ale, with a chewy/rich taste profile. This beer seems to be a winter aspertif. Herbal and tons of spice notes, cinamon, cardimom, jasmine tea. Starts out rootbeerish, with some gingerbread throught the palate. Mouth is numb with all the menthol or somn. Not my favorite holiday ale, but a unique approach to a holiday style. Cheese paring: pistachio crusted goat cheese, food: lamb stew, pumpkin pie, smoked fish(salmon/trout). Smoked oysters, Cigars too!"

"500ml bottle. Bourgogne Wine glass. Very dark brown color. Small bubbled foam, yellowish beige in color, forms a close, wide & sticky head & leaves wide lacings on sides. Aroma profile displays : Intense caramel malt & candies, herbal – cumin & anise-, forest, blackberries & dried nuts. Toasted flavors, smoky hues, herbal infusion & dark fruits, underneath molasses & brown sugar. Full body. Moderate but slight sparkling carbonation. Velvet palate & dense texture. Well integrated ABV appears as a kind warming sensation. Fudge chocolate & fruit notes in the middle as well as dried nut zest, subtle spiced & spicy hints. Memories of coffee liquor & sugar –but no cloying- into a sweet toasted malt finish. Dark fruity aftertaste. Complex & flavorful as a Winter Ale should be!!"

"a brown/black pour with 2 fingers of tan head. the scent is of zesty orange peels, caramel, almost a liquer like scent, molasses, brown sugar. yeesh, this is not a great tasting beer up front.. lots of alcohol falvor, orange peel, ginger, cinnamon, a slight spicyness towards the finish.medium body with low carbonation. i could see how this would've been great during winter months, but honestly, not so much right now, and not so much with some age on it. really not digging this one all that much."

"Picked this up at La Capsule Cave à Bière in Nancy, France. Deep mahogany pour with a creamy one finger off white head with decent retention and nice lacing. The nose is spicy, complex and absolutely amazing. Hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, coffee, dark fruit, molasses, maple, sage, and rye. The taste is just as amazing and just as complex. Strong malty and spicy base with hints of toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, pine, maple syrup, black cherries, sage, rye, and chestnuts. I had a beer this past summer in the South of France made with chestnuts and I'm really liking what they add in flavor. Hopefully it catches on. I'm also getting some subtle dark chocolate emerging as it warms. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a subtle tanginess on the finish. Overall, this is a home run Winter Warmer! It's amazingly complex but totally drinkable. A top notch beer from three awesome breweries!"
"The beer pours a deep black-brown with an inch of creamy tan head that laces - slightly reminiscent of Guinness. Honestly, it looks like it could have poured from a nitro tap. The nose is potently herbal with notes of white sage cutting through the surface. It reminds me of the holidays poured into a glass with an initial rye bread sweetness perfectly blended with chestnuts and piney sage. The beer was more aromatic and flavorful when I had it a month ago, but it still packs a distinct punch of flavor. The taste carries a lot of bready sweetness which transitions into a slightly bitter, herbal finish. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and modestly sweet with a fresh herbal finish. There is definitely a touch of roasted chestnuts/malt which compliments the beer's herbal aftertaste. This beer is very well done and definitely worth trying. It encapsulates everything I want in a winter warmer with a unique twist on the traditional winter warmer spice profile. It's an excellent collaboration beer with easy availability, wide distribution, and reasonable price point."

"Poured a dark brownish hue with good head and lace. A peppery, hoppy spiced beer is my first aroma, but I pick up some good sweet malts like caramel or figs as well. Beer is well-balanced as both minor citric hops and sweetness (I seem to pick up figs and toffee which is odd) are both evident, and the beer passes easy and fullish as there is a breadiness to the beer that makes it an easy passing, dessert sipper. A quality brew that is easy to drink and enjoyable which is all one can ask for a winter style beer."

"O: This is far and away the best winter warmer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Very complex and so easy to drink. I'm extremely glad that Nøgne decided to put out another release of this (maybe Stone and JP did as well, but I'm not sure), as this would be a regular winter beer in my fridge, even at the price of $9 for the 0.5L bottle. This gets the highest of recommendations from me for the style"
"Overall; It was an enjoyable beer and look forward to seeing how this beer does over time."

"Well, it's not bad, but as I'm finishing the bottle I feel it's on the dull side. Could use a little hop twang or some funk to liven things up. Doesn't quaff all that hard, but I doubt I'll go chasing this one down either."

"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark red amber. Nice medium head and lacing. Looks viscous and nicely made. Malty, spicy aroma. Mmm. Mellow malts, light and dark fruit, spices. Peppery hop finish. Nice presence of sage and juniper berry. One year old bottle. Wish I had saved more. Did not review this fresh, but this is superb. I will buy again if at all possible."
""
"""Each brew is following the same recipe, including Michigan chestnuts, white sage from southern California, and Norwegian juniper berries, but the differences in brewing and again practices produce different beers."""

"As far as Winter Warmers go, being a catch-all style and made for cold weather, it can only get a little better. This is one of the best I've ever had."
""
"O - This was a very spiced up winter warmer. I have had nothing quite like this. Tasted like eating a bunch of random spicy berries out of the forest. Maybe give this a shot if you see in on the shelf but not really worth seeking out in my opinion."
"O: It's a decent drink, and in my opinion has to many flavors that dont seem to really complement each other."
"Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Hazy brown body with a disappearing beige head. Nice aroma of caramel malt, dry fruit, spices like sage and juniper, some oak and relatively mild funkiness. Flavor has some pleasant cellar notes, sweet malt, caramel and Christmas spices. Fine body, balanced bitterness and a long and sweet aftertaste where the bitterness becomes more evident. Overall, an interesting beer but will not seek for this again."

"Overall a really great winter warmer, once of the best I've had."
"O: This is an interesting beer, it has a brown nut ale semblance to it, but it's rather complex. I wouldn't buy this again, but it's definitely good for the season."

"This surprised me, I thought it might be past its prime, but I really enjoyed it."
"Overall, it is a very drinkable holiday ale with decent flavor and almost humorous smell."
"The beer is brown, with a small head that fades rapidly, leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is grandiose, with pine, Christmas spices, and alcohol. The flavor brings a huge pine needle flavor, like drinking Christmas tree juice with cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkled on top. The body is thin, and the flavor, while decent, is overbearing. I would prefer more balance and subtlety. A small portion was more than enough for me."
"Pours a moderate brown-copper color with a slight off-white head and a bit of lacing. The nose brings loads of pine needs and a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon. The flavor takes it down a notch and everything is quite palatable; the pine and spices blend quite well. Smooth feel and a medium body. Pretty good."
"Malts ride the wave of a big, thick body. Spices charge forward from all directions, seemingly at random with no rhyme or reason. A touch musty. Cinnamon, cloves, ginger, winter herbs/spices, hints of baker's chocolate at the end. All the parts are solid, but others of the style do it better."
"500 ml bottle into tulip, almost a gusher upon opening. Pours dark brown color with a nice 2 finger dense light tan head with good retention. Some decent lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of ginger, cinnamon, all spice, roasted malt, molasses, and nuttiness. Taste of tons of cinnamon, clove, all spice, ginger, and nuttiness in the front; that leads to strong notes of toffee, caramel, and molasses on the back. Big lingering notes of roasted malt, caramel, and molasses with spices after the finish. Great balance of flavors as well. Nice smooth medium-full body with fairly high carbonation. Drinkability is great for the level of alcohol. No alcohol noticed in the taste and a slight warming after the finish. Overall an excellent winter warmer, probably the best one I have had yet."
"This beer poured out as a deep brownish red color that had a yellowish white head on it. This beer looks super thick, it looks like the bubbles forming the head are actually struggling to get to the top for air. In the light this beer look fantastic, beautiful looking color with a nice creamy looking head. The aroma is very impressive as well, it's loaded with pine, spices, and some Christmas berry aromas. There is a slight hop aroma in there too. The taste of this beer has a healthy amount of spices, pumpkin, berries, and even a touch of mint in the late aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy, it's got the a really great feel to it for the winter months. Overall, this is probably the best Winter Warmer I've had to date. I enjoyed just about everything this beer had to offer. Look forward to having this time and time again during the winter months."
"O - I went into this one with absolutely zero expectations or knowledge of what to expect. In the right context I think this is actually a very good beer. A somewhat warm late April night might not be the best timing for this. Late night, after a good meal, snow outside, in front of the fire, sharing this bottle with a friend or two...this would be great. Hopefully I can remember to pick up another one of these for the next such occasion - although, after the winter we had here in MA, not looking forward to that occasion especially."
"Verdict: World class Holiday Ale...Absolutely worth tracking down even at this outrageous price point..."
"Drinkability: I prefer the stone version of this and would have preferred to have it fresh despite it being in the fridge since purchase. I recommend this to those seeking a christmas spice beer with finish that reminds you that its beer you are drinking."
"the CPJ"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - This beer is very drinkable to me only because I enjoy the complexity of spices. If you don't like the taste of spices or are not a huge fan of Winter Warmer's, you will probably severely dislike this beer. I enjoyed the balance and blending of the spices to creat a well-balanced beer. Spices can be overpowering on your first few drinks; but they ultiamtely smooth out to make this beer light-medium bodied."
"D - Drinkability is high. The alcohol is nowhere to be seen in this beer and the incorporation of spices and unique ingredients help to enhance the beer drinking experience rather than hinder it as I felt Saison du BUFF did. While a bit pricey at around $10 a bottle, I'll be on the lookout for this next year if its available to pop actually around the holidays!"
"T: Tastes very Belgian. Some sweet yeast flavors that reminded me a bit of Chimay. A bit of nuttiness behind the yeast flavors and some herbal bitterness on the finish that seemed a little out of place. Pretty tasty but not worth the steep price."
"This is an interesting and warming Winter Warmer sipper. Nice for a Chicago snow storm."
"Pours a thick, hazy mahogany with a silky tan head. Nice malty nose has chocolate, dates, figs and spices. Taste is a nice blend of caramel, toffee, dark pitted fruits, nutty malts and xmas spices. Full body, light carbonation. Much better than original batch!"
"D: Nice holiday beer that I really enjoyed and would definitely seek out again if it were available -- too bad this was only a one time collaboration effort."
"Pours a murky, yeasty brown color with an extremely small off-white head. Scent definitely has the juniper berries and some light tartness to it. It also has some medicinal aromas as well. I also get a tiny bit of chocolate and spices. Taste is surprising... Has a tad bit of that funkiness that JP is known for, but nowhere near the amount their normal lineup has. I also get some dark malt flavors and roasted chestnuts. The taste has a somewhat medicinal characteristic to it also...which is this beers only flaw I think. Not really getting the juniper berries in the flavor, but I do get mild chocolate flavors and and some delightful spiciness. Mouthfeel is exactly how I would want a winter warmer to be... full bodied and a bit syrupy with a tiny bit of alcohol burn. Drinkability is fairly decent. Winter warmers a by far not a style I prefer, but this is one of the better ones by far. The medicinal characteristics bring this beer down a bit though."
"Alcohol is showing up a little more as it warms but not as prevalent when initially poured. Sweeter and more ""warm"" after it has been sitting for 20 minutes so I am upgrading my score slightly. I would recommend this beer to try for it's uniqness but not for the drinkability, smell or taste."
"Drinkability: would love another"
"Quite an odd brew, but appropriate for a spicy Winter Warmer."
"This beer pours a dark, Coca Cola color with a think tan head. Aromas of steel and cough medicine are present with a slight hint of hops. A heavy sweetness dominates the front of this beer. Caramel, vanilla, brown sugar and a hint of worcestershire. The finish a very slight hop note."
"Special Holiday Ale, a collaboration between Nogne O, Jolly Pumpkin and Stone Brewing pours a dark brown color from a twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is medicinal. So is the flavor. This beer really just does not work for me. I could get through a glass, but medicinal is the only taste that I can get. Some of my friends liked it... at least until I mentioned that I thought it tasted medicinal, then they quickly agreed and also decided they didn't especially like it. Your mileage may vary."
"Tasty. Robust."
"I had a few spiced beers from Nøgne Ø, and they all (more or less) seem to share these odd fat/soapy flavours. I don't enjoy them."
"A nice different brew with sage. This works, but no 5's for this one."
"D - A good holiday sipper perfect to share with someone around the fireplace. Very, very mild alcohol warming comes through on the finish of this one."
"Drinkability- A little too big on the spices for me."
"Highly drinkable, it is too bad this beer is as expensive as it it. At $8.99 for a pint, this will be my only time enjoying this beer this year."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden, but this beer is just a bit too sweet to have high drinkability. Beyond that, I'm not sure that this one is worth the high price tag. If you're really invested in any of the three collaborative breweries or spice beers (or hell, if you're into dubbels), it may be worth checking out."
"A bit over priced, but a easily drinkable holiday brew."
"All of the spices create quite an interesting beer, and one I would recommend, I just probably would not drink more than one of them. Happy holidays"
"It's nice and spicy, I had the Stone version about a year ago and it was much more in your face with all the spices, this is much more mellow (not sure if that's because it's the Nøgne-Ø version or because it's been aging longer). Mouthfeel is really nice and creamy, thick and a bit chewy as well. Overall a good holiday beer! My last one for the year!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-full. Pleasantly viscous. Overall an interesting and flavorful warmer. Spice character is initially intense, but seems to mellow as it warms. I can't recommend based on the $10 price point for only 500ml and there are much less ""intense"" spiced winter warmer offerings which are easier to find and less expensive."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. The oats are a definite plus for the mouthfeel. Very smooth and pleasing. Drinkability is a plus here. There are some unique flavors thrown in here, but they all tend to compliment each other well. A very enjoyable holiday concoction."
"Drinkability: With the combo of Nøgne Ø, Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales, and Stone Brewing Co., how could you go wrong. This is truly a concoction made from the three wise men. Bravo to this great collaboration."
"D - A solid and respectable winter warmer, but nothing spectacular... The aroma takes a bit to get used to, but seems to be lacking a bit in terms of substance and complexity... Perhaps, this one just isnt' for me when compared to my fellow BA reviews..."
"This is a fantastic beer, but I don't think I could drink a ton of it due to the high spice content. That said, I would be overjoyed to polish off a bottle of this by myself, and even happier to share some with some friends."
"D-the alcohol hits fairly quickly. its a quite filling beer as well. the taste stays well but this might be a good beer to share with someone special on a cold winter night."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a tan foam lining the top of the beer. The smell is out of this world. It's like there is a pumpkin party in my nose and everyone is invited. I am told that in addition to the other ingredient it is the juniper that is making me go wild for this aroma. The taste however doesn't seem to really match the intensity of this beer. The spices exist that you'd find in a pumpkin pie, but I find them to be more biting on the tongue than helpful in the flavoring of the beer, still a pretty good mix. The mouthfeel is a little on the syrupy side for my liking. I don't think that I would ever turn this beer down if it were offered to me."
"A delicious winter warmer, if a little odd and unexpected."
"very very dark color with tan head. very strong lacing, albeit from an aggressive pour into my snifter. smell is mostly of roasted malts similar to a porter/stout along with some vague winter spices that are hard to pick out and some dark fruits. very strange caramel and malt flavor right off the bat. there is a flavor in here i'm having trouble picking up. mouthfeel is on the thicker side of things. drinkability is good. it's a decent winter warmer although definitely not worth the $10 price for 500ml"
"Drink- The perfect way to end a 25 hour car ride from CA to KS on Turkey Day '10."
"Overall impressions are enjoyable and this is a beer worth trying, but nothing I will seek out next winter. Might shelve my other bottles, this one strikes me as an ager."
"D: This is a one off for me, but definitely interesting to say the least. Fine job."
"Overall an interesting and flavorful warmer. Spice character is initially intense, but seems to mellow as it warms. Definitely worth a try."
"Nicely drinkable."
"My second winter warmer/CHRISTmas beer of the season.Poured into a imperial nonic a deep murky chesnut brown with a thinner creamy beige head that held well,aromas are herbal with alot of raw nuttiness,I would say raw fits the nose profile pretty well.A full mouthfeel,it seemed to be lower carbonated,flavors start out sweetish and cakey with juniper, and a sharp herbal note in the finish.A nice cool weather beer here,Iam not a big fan of jupiner berry flavors, but there is a nice mix of other flavors in the profile."
"Nogne Special Holiday Ale is what happens when three talented brewers put their heads together and start experimenting. It won't be for everyone, but this stuff blows Anchor Our Special Ale (which it resembles) out of the water."
"An interesting beer to be sure but the flavour is somewhat compelling."
"D -very easy to drink."
"D - A little heavy on the spices but I am starting to like that in Winter Warmer's."
"Drinkability: I go back and forth on the mouthfeel, but have ultimately come to the conclusion that I would like a slightly more traditional mouthfeel; still, the spice character of this beer is very unique and while I would not want more than one at a setting, it is well worth checking out"
"D- For a holiday spiced beer, this drinks very nicely. Nothing is too over-barring or abrasive."
"well balanced with that wonderful feel again. particularly creamy yet brisk on the tongue. all the herbal qualities were there. great beer. made by the fruit sweet sour/herbal and brisk/creamy dichotomy."
"d - I thought this was a pretty good winter warmer that was definitely heavy on spices in both the smell and taste. The smell had a very unique smell to it, which I think was the juniper beers, and the taste was a pretty standard winter warmer. Would give another shot and would be interested in trying side by side with the other breweries' versions."
"D-- Sipper in front of a fire. A whole lot of spice and the ABV is decently hidden at first but as it opens up more it becomes more and more alcoholic. Spices and nuts are really good in this but the sheer amount of spice is a bit on overload for the senses. Good winter warmer on steroids."
"On a cold December night, this would be awesome... It was terrific in July as well... I wonder if they'll do this one again? Really nice... I'd buy this one again for sure"
"Super dece beer. Poured with a tan, fine foamy, head and a little lace. Color is an almost opaque, mahoganey brown. Aroma is malty, spicey, dark ripe fruits. Flavor is like aroma but the spices come out more - can definitely pick out the sage and juniper; chestnuts are muted. Body and carbonation are perfect for the style: round full, fine aggresive but not overdone bubbles. Finish is like flavor, very well balance and short to medium long. Easy drinking beer. Could have another. Be real good with hearty meals."
"The texture is very smooth despite the more than ample carbonation. I think, though, that I would like the consistency just a touch thicker based on the boldness of the flavor and the color of the beer. This is an easy beer to drink. The lightness of the beer itself, coupled with the great balance and myriad of spices makes this a winner of a winter warmer that really highlights the base beer."
"Not sure what the difference is between this one and the other one, but this is the bottle and ABV I'm dealing with, so...yeah... It pours a very dark brown, showing only the slightest tinge of translucence, topped by two fingers of cream-colored foam. The nose comprises black cherries, nutmeg, brown sugar, chocolate-covered strawberries, rye bread, cinnamon, and molasses. The taste holds notes of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, rye bread, banana bread, raspberries, maple syrup, vanilla, peppercorns, red grapes, red apples, and cashews. Tastes like the holidays... The body is a strong medium, with light carbonation and a smooth, semi-chewy feel. I wish it were the holidays more often, if'n it meant more of this kind o' beer would be available. Get some!"
"Can't wait for Jolly Pumpkin's version as these have both been wonderful brews."
"Smell of bottled holiday spices, juniper, and nutmeg along with some roasted malt. Beer is a dark black with a creamy tan head thats extremely persistent and leaves a thick residue on the sides of the glass. The beer has a light body and a residual sweetness offset by a lingering juniper/pine flavor. Malt is apparent in mellow roasted chocolate notes. While tasty I personally have never been a fan of juniper, and that is a key flavor in this beer. However, I expect a good deal of the spices have mellowed since bottling. Subtle dryness remains and allows for a slow enjoyable beer."
"Pours a hazy cola color with a deep foamy light tan head that fades slowly leaving a nice amount of Belgian lacing. The smell is unique; a nice mix of holiday spices..the sage first out of the box, chocolate gingerbread. Highly carbonated, the effervescent texture adds a creamy smooth feel to the light body. The flavors match up nicely to the nose. A real nice drinker! Many thanks to bmanning for this opportunity."
"I expected the spices in this beer to be more prominent, and I suspected that they must have mellowed quickly in the bottle, but, in looking at other recent reviews, distinct spices were noted, so perhaps the shortcoming lies with me and not the beer. Cola and a touch of caramel sweetness. Juniper was barely perceived as a light, piney note. Alcohol well integrated and lent a touch of pepper."
"D: My favorite of the series, so far. Is the JP version going to be sour? We'll just have to wait and see."
"D: I find winter warmers not the most drinkable style, but for style this does well. Recommended if you happen to still find this one."
"As an experiment, I tried placing the remaining half bottle of beer in the fridge for a bit. After one hour open in you drink it.the fridge, the beer seemed to have more sour notes, but other flavors were more muted (maybe due to it being colder). Still getting some strong flavor, like anise or something. Maybe it's the caraway? Still smooth, but less creamy. I liked it better closer to room temperature."
"D: Very nice drinking experience with a earthy evergreen flavor makes this delightful to consume. To many holiday ales and winters try to overload on the spice rack, this delivers a earthy wintery feel that seems very natural. At 8.5% it drinks more like a 6.5%. A special collaboration between 3 notable breweries comes together nicely here making for a worthy purchase and something to talk about."
"First things first i love the label really appealing for some reason anyways onto the brew it pours a nice very dark Kola beer colour with nice carbonation that leaves a creamy two finger head and lacing here and there,the aroma is like a spicy fruitcake with hints of ginger,nutmeg,cinamon and nuts,it has a full creamy mouthfeel with a very unique taste with spicy fruit being the most dominant and also some hints of boozy expresso yet for a full flavoured brew it has a nice easy light finish and is very moreish and even though you can taste a little alcohol after the first few sips it definately dissapears,will buy this again whether it be Xmas or not cheers."
"Conclusion: This is a beguiling and fascinating winter warmer. Great job to Nogne O for this year's version. The only downside is that it's really too crazy complex and intense to make it something I'd want all the time. Still, one of the best spiced winter warmers I've had yet!"
"As far as winter warmers go, this one is quite drinkable. The flavor of the 8.50%abv is hidden very well, but it definitely has a nice warming sensation to it. I wouldn't really want to drink it in July, but November through March it would be very welcome in my glass."
"Pours a dark, murky brown with a high, dense, tan head that leaves just a little lacing. The smell is juniper, cedar, malt syrup, salted potatoes. The taste is toffee, juniper, collard greens, pork fat -- it'd go well with soul food. It's thick and chewy, moderately carbonated. Goes down smooth, but not too quickly."
"Bravo. I usually don't care/go for the winter warmer variety but I enjoyed this one. This all-star collab nailed it on the second release of the Special Holiday Ale."
"A delicious beer that obviously tilts toward the sweet-malty side and keeps the spices in check."
"Poured from a cellar-temperature bottle into a goblet. Pours a deep dark brown with ruby tones, hard to see through, with a creamy tan head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is unusual and complex, sweet with hints of juniper, rye, and alcohol, as well as other things I can't tease out. Flavor is roasted malts, with juniper upfront and a hint of coffee and chocolate on the way down. There is a pleasant heat from the alcohol, and a lingering sweetness to the roasted afterflavors. There is such a depth of flavor that I feel like I've only skimmed the surface, but I've run out of words. There is more carbonation than is apparent from the appearance, and it carries the flavor into your mouth with a burst. This brew has a rich mouthfeel, almost creamy. It's delicious and drinkable, but perhaps not more than one."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a Gouden Carolus chalice. It has a dark ruby/brown color, almost like a glass of cola. There is a modest tan foam head that settled down to a skim of foam. No light can penetrate through the sides of the glass, but near the top of the beer some light filters through and I can see bubbles rising to the top. The aroma can be classified and spiced malt. I am picking up nutmeg, sweet candy and a bit of juniper. It's very interesting. It has a big roasted malt flavor. You can taste the rye a bit of the nuttiness from the chestnuts. It also has a touch of warm alcohol that lingers on, along with some forest-like flavors (probably the juniper I picked up in the nose) and finishes up with a slight coffee bitterness. I was surprised at how thick this beer was when I first tasted it. I rolls around your mouth and doesn't want to leave once you've swallowed. It has the kind of body that demands respect and attention. It is hearty enough to earn the name winter warmer. Despite the big body and flavors, I find the beer to be quite drinkable. At no point do the spices overwhelm, nor does the ABV. This is an ideal beverage for a long winters night. Highly recommended!"
"Notes: A very interesting beer from this collaboration. Definitely winter themed with all the spice going on. If you like it, it will be a good beer, but still not great. If that distinct flavor isn't you're thing, you may hate it, as it is completely dominant throughout the aroma and smell."
"Medium to full body with a smooth mouthfeel. I wasn't totally sure how to rate this one...there's nothing bad about it really, but it does feel a little overspiced at times. So I would say it is very good, just not over the top spectacular. Glad I tried it though."
"I had one of the original-brewings of this beer on Christmas, shortly before buying this one. I knew there would be another day this winter I would need a winter warmer. When work closed early due to snow I realized it was today."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost black color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into minimal lacing. The aroma is very spicy. The best I can describe is like really sharp ginger, but ginger is not listed on the bottle as being a spice they used. There is no malt or hop character present in the aroma. It is all spice....very simple. The taste is more balanced than the aroma in that there is some malt, but it is still mostly spice. The mouthfeel is very good. Silky, moderately carbonated, and full bodied. This is a decent beer, and perhaps might be really good if left to age for a couple years so the spice could mellow out."
"I had the holiday collaboration between Stone/Jolly Pumpkin/Nøgne Ø last year. Supposedly, it's the same recipe. This release was simply brewed at Nøgne Ø's facilities rather than Stone's. I recall the last release being a little more spicy, but no more tasty. Just a little different. To the best of my recollection, the releases are very similar in terms of quality. The nose could use just a little more strength here, but that's about it. The flavor is good. It's unique for a Winter Warmer. Not what you'd ordinarily expect. I like it. If you see a bottle still around, pick it up. It's good stuff. Perhaps Jolly Pumpkin will do the honors next year."
"Drinkability - The booze is masked well - I hope they don't stop brewing this after they go to JP next year!"
"This is definitely better than last year's Stone incarnation. A great winter warmer."
"D- Great beer, very pleasing, thoroughly enjoyable. I've been seeing more nogne o beers and I think I may get them all"
"Overall it was good to try but half a glass is good for me. It's hard to finish."
"This was a great drink given how little I like holiday beers, I wanted another almost immediately after killing this one."
"Quintessential holiday ale for me. Wouldn't drink it every day but perfect for a few once a year treat at the holidays. This can also age a bit which should be an interesting drink."
"D- Overall, very drinkable and a good beer. Previous reviews say that this beer is hot, but I think that now this beer is drinking very nicely."
"There is almost no carbonation to speak of. A pleasnant, medium mouthfeel for an 8.5% beer."
"Medium bodied beer. Lots of spice up front with a definite roast character in the back. Beer is a little ""hot"" with the alcohol. Second taste, finishes nicely, overall pretty drinkable and the mouthfeel is fine. I'm not sure I would get it again but I'm learning again this year that I'm not a fan of the winter warmers. Take a look if its your style, otherwise skip it."
"The exquisite taste and feel here add up to very high drinkability. Nogne O outdid itself with this one. It's also clear that all 3 breweries contributed high-quality ingredients. This is a great beer."
"D: Like the Stone brewed beer before it, this one is good, but ""different"". I enjoy it for the creative ingredients and being able to make a pretty decent beer, but definitely one of those winter time only beers."
"D: I am not of fan of the piney and bitterness taste. Not sure but this taste a bit different then the Stone version. I actually like that one more."
"M - Velvety, above medium bodied, sticky and coats the tongue."
"I had Special Holiday Ale after a burger and fries, on New Years Eve. It perfectly washed down dinner and had a festive feel that went perfectly with the occasion."
"D - This was another great Christmas beer, wonderfully done by three hard hitters of the brewing world"
"Medium body with a dry finish. I like the way the spices don't overpower you and work together in this formula. Makes it much easier to drink."
"D- I give this a 4.5 on the basis of Holiday drinkability. I enjoyed last years Stone based offering, and was not disappointed by this years. While it is similar, there is noticeable difference. I can't wait til its JP's turn."
"Overall a very good beer and one of the only spiced winter beers that I would come back to again. Well done folks."
"D: This beer is very smooth. Very smooth. Any alcohol noticeable is actually nice, and slightly warming. Glad I got two of these..."
"500ml bottle served in a Tank 7 tulip. Bottle conditioned. Poured a dark brown with about two fingers of tan head. Very fragrant. Juniper, spruce, eucalyptus. Also some dark malt as it warms. Medium bodied. Dark fruit, chocolate malt and more spices in the flavor. Spruce and Juniper. Very long finish of spices. Very interesting beer. If you like Anchor OSA, this would be up your alley. You wouldn't want to make a night of it, but fairly drinkable. Great holiday brew."
"Drinkability is good. It can be a little overwhelming if you don't dig the juniper flavor, but I do and I enjoyed this. My sample was gone way too soon!"
"Edit: Realize now that I posted my review under the wrong beer (hardly surprising given the various collaborative efforts involving these breweries), and so have now moved it. Hard keeping track... :-)"
"Drinkability: this is a bold flavored beer and great for the cold weathe, but one bottle is enough in a session."
"D: Too floral to be highly drinkable, very smooth and the abv is well hidden but too many herbs get in the way of this one."
"D: This release is very good, and easy to drink. It could have used just a bit more assertive hopping though. That would have bumped up my score."
"D- Overall, this is an interesting brew because it is different but I don't think it is outstanding enough to purchase again. Worth a shot though."
"J"
"I think this is a tad better than last years version, though they are certainly very close. The aroma is a bit spicy for me but the taste is excellent, as is the super creamy mouthfeel. Creative and tasty."
"d - the flavors are intense though not that complex and interesting, not all that harsh on the palate"
"Overall: One of the best I've had in a while. Truly is a winter warmer and probably the best I've had this season (I feel ashamed for not rating the last many beers I've had, so I start again here)."
"the mouthfeel is average at best. too thin and over-carbonated. three titans of brewing worked on this beer but give me a jubelale instead. still, a pretty good beer."
"Glad I had the chance to try this. One of the more unusual beers I have ever had"
"this one looks really pretty to me. Nice, dark brown with a tan head that looks good, holds well and leaves nice lace on my glass. sage hits me first in the nose, followed by juniper and sweet, nutty, toasty goodness. taste is a well balanced mix of all of the above which comes together to create it's own personality, forming a taste that reminds me of the candies in my granmother's house that had a really odd boozy herbal medicine thing going on with them. the things going on in this beer are all triggers for festive christmas time moods and feelings for me all sliding down to my belly on a slick and slightly prickly bed of beer that leaves a sagey piney fresh herb kiss of a finish that really lingers in a kind of dry way. nice. out there. proper. all said and done, this could be like my anchor tradition. one a year to get me in the mood, and i can't wait for next year."
"D - In a world of over-spiced winter brews, this one is a nice respite. Still spiced, but not to much. They did not just throw a bunch of ingredients into a beer, but crafted a brew that utilized all the ingredients to add to the beer. What results is a well produced beer, that yet somehow misses feeling spectacular, yet I can't seem to pin-point why."
