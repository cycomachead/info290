"This is a lovely winter warmer. It is substantial, dark combination of chocolate, coffee and dark fruits. Winterbaun errs on the side of bitter (bakers chocolate and hops) rather than sweet. There is a nice boozy afterburn that provides a warming finish."
""
"Cheers!"

"Very dark appearance with mild head and carbonation. Sweet herbal aroma. Spice, tobacco, chocolate malt sweetness. Slightly ashy at the end of the sip."
""
"Deep Amber/caramel color. Decent malty nose. Hoppy yet malty and sweet, almost like a lighter imperial stout. Nice bitterness at the end. Very tasty."

"O - This is an enjoyable beer, reminiscent of an English brown ale with some German Doppelbock  overtones.  The plum and prune notes are a bit strong for me, giving a cloying impression, resulting in the Taste category being its lowest score for me."
"This is a solid brown ale that is less nutty, slightly more hoppy and just a little less impressive than Downtown Brown in my opinion."

"Got pretty hard to drink by end."
"Lets cut to the chase. This beer is basically liquid dark chocolate. It's got slight hits of coffee, but the taste of chocolate overpowers it. I like the founders style bottle and the Picasso(ish) label art. Great beer, I've bought it twice and wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."

"O: A nice example of a brown ale with some really nice winter flavors. I enjoyed this one and would definitely consider grabbing it again. Overall the alcohol is well hidden and the beer is relatively easy to drink."
""
"O: Definitely one of the better brown ales I've had, which is saying absolutely nothing, so I'll put it this way: It's a great beer, nice and wintery, and the nutty malt serves as a nice backbone for the wintery style. Recommended."

"Overall: A good winter-warmer. This beer is close to being great. Rather enjoyable"
"Overall: Great full body and very thick, sweet finish. A prevailing molasses flavor (and texture!). Some spiciness on the finish as a little chocolate but a very overall thick and sweet beer."

"This is a very confused beer- not quite sure whether it is an amber or a stout, and not quite sure it is proud or ashamed of its high alcohol-content. The after-taste is all stout- chocolatey and vaguely coffee-like, but the mouthfeel is light and the head lackluster. The color of the beer itself is a very dark red, and it tastes just like it looks. Overall, it's a very good beer for getting drunk; I was gone faster than I anticipated, and the taste was in all honesty above average. Great beer to buy on sale, but not something to look for, in my opinion."

"This is a drinkable, flavorful malty beer. It is a great representation of a winter seasonal. Great job Lost Coast!!"
""
""
""
""
""

"This one went down the tubes really fast. Thin and watery, sour, astringent (like sucking on Aspirin), not refreshing at all. This will be a chore to finish the whole sixer. Maybe the recipe DOES need to change. Avoid this one..."
""
""
"overall i could session this beer all day, which at 8%ABV is impressive. Very enjoyable though nothing special."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it. Would have again. Recommended."
""
""
"taste is nutty and sweet with a tang of bitter in the middle. just realized it's 8% abv. the higher the abv, the more the tendency to stress the flavor a bit.... considring that, i think they did a great job on this brew. the alcohol is noticeable but easily overlooked. there is a certain 'earthiness' to the nutty flavor and this is a beer i could easily drink in succession."
""
""
""
"Overall: If you can find it on sale, its well worth a look. Otherwise, there are plenty of better brown ales out there."
""
""
""
""
"8% ABV is very well hidden."
""
""
""
"O: Extremely easy to drink with pronounced straight forward flavors. Perfect beer to help warm up for the colder season. Highly recommended for someone in need of a change of pace from heavy imperial stouts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, 8/10."
"It's officially winter, time to stop procrastinating on the massive amount of winter beers I've stocked up on. Winterbraun pours out a great clear brown with a very nice looking large head. The aroma is full of roasted malts, chocolate, and some dark fruits. The taste offers more of the roast, chocolate, and fruits from the nose, along with a solid boozy kick and some earthy malts on the finish. The mouthfeel seems a bit too light for the booze factor that the flavor offers, and the drinkability is good. Overall, Winterbraun is a solid winter seasonal that offers something that's a bit different from the pack of overspiced ales."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this brew.... I like almost everything the Lost Coast Brewery puts out.... A masterful winter brew from Humboldt County."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very drinkable beer…the chocolate malts work wonders on my tongue and all I want to do is drink more and more…easy, smooth and flavorful, one of these isn’t enough and six would send me caroling through the streets…let this one sit at room temp (out of the fridge) for 10 minutes or so before opening to find tons more flavor and aroma…the only thing that holds this back from being exceptional is the lack of head retention…I like beers that do leave a little fluff on the mustache (I don’t really have one, but you get the idea)…highly recommended for a sit-around with friends while opening those festive gifts or just chatting it up…Yum! (4.5/5)"

"All in all it is a decent winter warmer like brown ale for the price. It is a relatively inexpensive, and drinkable, strong brown beer."

"Overall - Good brew, and it's a kick in the pants vs. your more traditional english brown. Does well to hide the 8%. Good balance. Yes, I believe this one will have to be had again, but there's so many beers, and so little time and money."
""
"T: Prominent chocolate malts, caramel/toffee sugars, and a slight hops bitterness. Lingering caramel finish. The alcohol is well hidden until the beer warms, adding a bit more character and a hint of almond. Overall, inoffensive and limited palate-wise; a good but not exceptional beer. I'd drink one again if somebody else were buying."
""
""
""

""
""
"this is a pretty decent brown ale. full bodied, and you can really taste that in the mouthfeel. Nice chocolaty/malty taste and enough body to make this good for the winter. Not hoppy, so don't look for that as you would some other winter beers, but it's got enough to make it crisp and not TOO malty. All in all, a good beer. I'd drink another!"
""

""

"A pretty decent dessert beer, gonna have to try it with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream."
""
"Overall not a great winter warmer since not only is the body thin but it has bittering hops and just mild flavors of any roast or chocolate flavors. Pass."
"O- Good brew. Lost Coast does well."
"Not a bad beer overall. Nice chocolate taste, smooth and consistent. Very drinkable."
""
"O- Overall, this is a solid brown. I enjoyed it! "
""
"Overall: A little different than others in the genre. Fairly full feel with a fairly complex flavor."

"O - To me this beer tastes like a brown ale with a touch of cinnamon thrown in. The flavors were good but for the most part it did come off like it was almost a porter to me. I'd probably only have about one of these in one sitting. Overall I thought it was a okay brew, but I don't see myself buying it again."
""
""
""
"Pours a clean deep amber to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a light caramel and a roasted malt. In the taste, a mix of caramel and roasted malt, with a nice ending with a hop presence. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small hop and caramel like sweetness in the aftertaste. A bit sweet, but nice hop presence in the beer."
""
""
""
""
"A surprisingly tasty brown ale from a brewery I've never tried before. I look forward to trying their other beers now."
"This was a pleasant surprise.. very enjoyable brown ale. Great brown ale to enjoy during the winter.. I wouldn't even mind this year-round."
""
""
"Big three finger plus head of dark tan, fairly whipped up and airy yet has decent retention, the lacing is thick yet slides down the glass sides swiftly leaving a streak here or there. Dark brown colored liquid with a yellow tint, fairly transparent, sedate and inviting presence in the glass. The nose has lots of scone, biscuit and flaky dough in addition to cocoa, mocha and caramel, with all this yet manages to stay firm and dry, the plum, cherry scents have a dried fruit character with raisins and dates mixed in, light leafy, herbal matter too which helps give it character and balance. Medium-bodied, lots of carbonation and churn in the mouth, given this still glues itself to the palate. Loaded with chocolate, cocoa flavors, very dominant, the caramel and toffee a clear second. The breakfast breads and doughiness counterbalanced by orange zest and tea leaves. Pinch of cinnamon powder. As in the nose the components suggest sweetness more than the whole delivers, not necessarily a bad thing and makes for improved drinkability. Roastiness present throughout but restrained. Not much not to like here."
""
"Overall, a very drinkable brown ale at 6.5%. Sweetness matches any bitterness. I wouldn't want a 6 pack, but one bottle is worth it."
"Dark brown in color, slightly red hue when held to the light. The head is tan and a little thin, but this is a fine looking beer. The aroma is malty...with a burnt grass and medicinal character. Some background herbal hops, but mostly a bready, toast-like malt-like smell. The taste is balanced, with a malt backbone. Not much here that's overwhelming...a bit thin, but nice malt-candy and spice qualities. Some grain. All in all, this one is just okay."
""
"O: This is a great winter session beer. Waming and easy/tasty to drink. Not crazy complex, but good."
""
""
""
"I like it. A common style with a bit of holiday spice flavor."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch puffy beige head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Chunky rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, cocoa, and some slight vanilla aromas. Taste is of toasted and roasted malt, caramel, and cocoa powder. A mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a somewhat crisp yet smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale. I can see why this is released as a Winter beer."
"like some other reviewers, I too must note with a little chagrin that when you purchase a winter beer, you don't always know what you are going to get. This beer is beautiful to look at and tastes really great, but I would call it a brown ale, or a light stout or something else. It's great, but if you are expecting a spicy winterfest type beer, you may be disappointed. A light chocolate stout perhaps?"
""
"O: A great Christmas beer. Just a really clean tasting beer. Very sessionable and great for a Christmas party. So far only second to Jubelale. We'll see how well Anderson Valley and Anchor winter beers keep up!"
""
"Another yearly go-to winter ale for me."
"O-nothing too Offensive and nothing spectacular. average all the way"
""
"This tastes like a not too robust/not too mild brown. It is well crafted and decent for the style (better than many an English English Brown). But I don't like these. I'm getting heartburn from it. I will try to not buy this again. I wish it were slightly spiced - I would recommend doing this yourself. My spice shelf is a big mess and I couldn't find any."
"O: Good stuff. Pleasant surprise."
"My Bears continue to rock it on the field, hopefully they'll do the same by housing another potentially good beer. This one pours a hazy sunset sienna topped by a finger of dusty light tan foam. The nose comprises rich caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, and a light kiss of cocoa. The taste brings in more of the same, along with ginger, nutmeg, and orange peel. The last one, though, provides an awful lot of citrus-rind-y bitterness given the small amount. This, though, does not hurt things too much. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a pretty solid brown, though the spices start to become a bit much after a while. Not too much, thankfully, but it starts to grate on ya. Beyond that, things are a bit on the thin side, but mostly this is some pretty good stuff."

"I purchased a single bottle at my local beer store. Enjoyed the smell and taste. The label mentions chocolate twice and for good reason. The caramel and chocolate malts make this beer unique, but I don't get much of the spicy hops. It has a very nice aftertaste. I'd purchase a 6-pack to share with friends."
"D- pretty good winter warmer type beer, not too heavy on the spice and big on roasted flavor."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - I seem to be at a loss for words with this review. I can't exactly pinpoint what I'm tasting. It's a fairly plain brown ale that I don't mind drinking."
"I used to drink this all the time, and passed it over the last couple of winters. I've been missing out. This isn't an outstanding beer, but it is warming and tasty and a great cold weather brew."
"Picked up a single of Winterbraun from the Binny's singles bin....so this might be close to a year old...however....it is a great tasting Brown ale!!! The appearance is good...poured a brownish amber with good carbonation and ercu head that is lacing. The aroma is roasty and sweet. The taste is a charred molassis that has great balanced between all the characteristics. There is a slight acidic taste at the end and the alcohol becomes more prevalent as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is good...nice fuller body carbonation tickles the tongue. Overall the is a good beer. I was a little nervous because I thought the age would do it in....but no...it kept well."
"Drink- It was pretty tasty. It's been a very long time since I have had a base North Coast beer. I should probably go back to some of them."
"O/D - Odd. Seems like it missed the mark with the malt bill. Yeasty and odd IMO. Too bland to be interesting. Nothing special and not something I would look for again."
"O - as the name suggests, this is definitely a warm hug on a gold winter night, just too bad for me I cracked it in the middle of a summer heat wave"
"Pours a dark amber with 1/4"" head. Smells a little sweet for my liking; apples and malts. Tastes sweet, too. I can't put my finger on what exactly is tastes like, but I'll offer up apples and syrup as my best guess. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. I prefer my winter offerings with a little more spice and alcohol and far less sweet. Not disappointed I tried it, but the future will be Winterbraun-less for me."
"D - Not a bad winter ale, the malt is very much up front but not excessively dark as it never gets any browner then a touch of molasses. The yeast is there to remind us that it is brewed in semi British style as are the musty hops. On the down side it has a kind of sticky, cola sweetness in the finish and the bitterness is disjointed and harsh. Good enough, but not really any more than that."
"(12oz bottle). Pours hazy brown with lots of sedimentation in suspension. kahki head. Aroma of wood, caramel, and cocoa nibs. Taste is sweet with some roasty bitterness. Kind of like a chocolate tootsie pop. Medium finish with a slightly bitter, dry finish. Not a bad beer considering I don't typically care for the style."
"O: This was a pretty good brown ale. It wasn't super complex but had enough to keep me coming back each sip to search through it. I'd gladly buy this again."
"D: A really nice beer I would go find again."
"Very drinkable. The alcohol does not getting in the way"
"The beer is dark brown with a large head. Nose is hoppy but with lots of malt and a toasty note. The beer is a brown ale with a rounded hoppy mouthfeel. Very drinkable yet full of flavour . Not huge and brooding but rather a fun brown ale that works well at this time of this year"
"This beer doesn't quite stand up to careful rating, but it's a great drinking beer to have any time the beer itself isn't the focus. Quite nice overall, and better to my taste buds than pretty much any year-round beer from Lost Coast. It certainly outclasses Downtown Brown."
"I've passed this one over at the local bottleshop for a long time now, mostly due to the goofy label, unfortunately. My bad, as this turns out to be a lovely big brown ale - and more balanced than my ill-informed expectations. Quite easy to put back the whole bottle, and it's inspiring in me a desire to escape the urban snowscape for a quick mountain holiday."
"This was very easy drinking. I haven't had a lot of English Browns so I don't know when I'll get back to this one but I could see it becoming a beer I get to have every so often when its out. However, won't be the first winter beer I reach for at the same time."
"D-Pretty easy drinking, no frills brown ale. A decent beer but I have my favorites when it comes to this style that I'd buy instead."
"D - Overall A great brew. From the two Lost Coast ales that I've had, they are some of the best looking brews I've seen. It makes you look forward to every sip knowing that it will taste good."
"Overall, a delicious English Brown that could pass for a Winter Warmer if the nutty and roasty characteristics were a bit less prevalent. Either way, without restraint I could drink at least three of these in one sitting."
"D: A really good drinker."
"D- Nice spices and good warmth"
"Meh."
"The mouth is pleasant with a dry finish. I think this is a pretty easy drinker, but the 6.5% puts it out of session range for me. I'm glad I picked-up a sixer as this one did not last long in my glass."
"I had this beer on tap at Tony's Darts Away in Burbank. Poured dark brown with a nice tan head. Smelled malty and chocolatey with a little nuttiness. Very moderate carbonation...just enough for me. You can taste malt, chocolate, and carmel flavors and not much bitterness. Just enough sweetness (i think the alcohol balances it out nicely). I could definitely drink a few. Great winter brew!"
"Good, medim-bodied mouthfeel, creamy and smooth... and good drinkability. Overall, nice balance on this beer."
"D - Not a whale, but a good solid beer. I like it."
"Pretty good beer. Poured with a huge foamy, frothy, fluffy, tan head that lasts a while and very good lacing. Color is a cloudy/hazy brown with amber highlights. Aroma is lush and an aromatic blend of malt, cocoa, and a bit of caramel and nutmeats. Flavor is like nose with the cocoa and malt really standing out. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is good and of medium length but has notes of solvent."
"drinkability: a decent beer. good offering but will not seek again. first lost coast beer ive had."
"Drinakability: Enjoyable. Pleasant, not what I'd expect from a christmas beer but I like it."
"Begins to wear out its welcome mid bottle, really was upper echelon brown and then got really easy running into thin. I dunno what happened. This beer is good in 4 oz pours, but then about halfway through the bottle, it just doesn't excite me anymore. What, $8 a 6 pack? I just can't imagine wanting 6 of these."
"Drinkability: Nice brew, though for a winter/holiday beer I expect something more spicy and hoppy. However, that just does not jell with the brown ale style Lost Coast is going for. Another great brew from a great brewery. Very balanced and tasty."
"Maybe not exactly to style, but I found this quite pleasant and drinkable. A little more of a winter warmer maybe than an English brown."
"D - Very enjoyable; a nice brown ale with a reasonable ABV, great sweet notes without overdoing it."
"perhaps a little out of season but still drinking fine, as mentioned above nothings wrong with this beer and it's enjoyable but don't wait until summer to drink it"
"D: drinks good all the way thru that makes it seem like winter in the summer. Overall a pretty good offering from lost coast."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0912-DanM"
"Not a great favorite but better than my impression in previous years."
"D - Probably no more than 2 before the flavor becomes too overwhelming."
"Warming with nice hops astringency note, medium-bodied, light effervescence. Slightly dry. Pretty good stuff. Though not a standout, a solid brew."
"D: Interesting choice of hops (Saaz)...I wish they would have come out more in the flavor. But not overdone with the chocolate. I really enjoyed this one."
"D- I could have one or two. It's more like a dessert beer for me"
"Overall a very solid brown ale. I'm normally not a fan of this style but I would buy this one again."
"Amber body, semi-opaque, finger and a half tan head, slow dissipation, nice lacing, a really nice looking beer. Bready malts, a bit of chocolate in the nose, some aromatic hops. not overpowering, malts predominate. Taste is mostly chocolate, a bit of caramel sweetness, good hop presence but not bitter. Finish is pretty dry, a bit bitter and chocolatey as it warms up. Big carbonated mouthfeel, a bit busy. This is pretty drinkable. Not sure I'd call this a Winter Warmer (despite the label), but it is a tasty, hoppy English Brown. Recommended, especially if you have the patience to let this warm a bit so the chocolate and hops come fully front and center."
"Feel was very chalky with abundant carbonation. The sharpness faded to a fizz and the beer finished dry. Not a bad beer."
"Shows a clear mahogany in the glass with a thick, creamy slightly off-white froth with above average retention & very good lacing. The nose offers aromas of caramel, toffee, chocolate, cinnamon, brown sugar, dark fruits, vanilla, & a very light citrus hop. Aromas turn into flavors on the palate with a good mouthfeel, slight alcohol tingle, decent hop bitterness, and long finish. Overall, a very nice winter beer. Recommended."
"Solid, simple beer. This isn't really a great brown ale, but it's still good beer. Light chocolate malt and spicy hops are evident in the aroma. The beer is a rich copper color with a creamy, ecru head. The flavor is a mish mash of sweet malt and bitter, spicy hops. Mouthfeel is a tad thin. Good beer but not terribly interesting."
"D: this is a good drinker that had a few surprises on the palate. A pretty hearty and confectionary beer"
"12oz bottle into a tulip glass pours a slightly hazy brown with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is mild dark malts and not much else. The taste is a nice blend of toasted brown malts and Earthy bitter hops that leave a nice bitter finish. The beer is on the light side of medium with mild alcohol. This is an enjoyable brew for a winter day."
"A nice beer for gray fall weather. Its good all around, with no particular weaknesses. Clean, with some malt complexity, and a good balance of Saaz hops. Interesting enough for a few pints, and best after it warms to about cellar temp."
"glassware: pint"
"Served in straight pint glass. I hate when this happens. This is a beer I like a lot, from a brewery that I like a lot. And sitting down for critical review all I can do is rate every thing as average. I still like this beer and will continue to enjoy it, I just thought the actual rating would be higher. A beer worth trying and having several is not a bad idea, just don't expect to be blown away."
"Lost Coast continues to make some darn good beers and continues to package them with cartoon laden labels and taps. Perhaps it's just me but it's hard to take them seriously when i am embarassed to carry a goofy looking six pack to the cash register - maybe that's just my issue...."
"The taste is similar, rich toast, caramel, sweet-sour dried fruit with a tang, some earthy leaves, hint of chocolate, bread, and prunes. It's very nice, well-balanced if slightly on the sweet side, and very drinkable."
"This is one big brown and leans in a Dopplebock direction. This ones not tasting particularly fresh though."
"Would be nice with a meal (edit: it is!), pretty decent all-around brew that with the right crowd I might have another. Only thing that holds me back is the slight resemblance to the Lost Coast Raspberry Brown which was...not so good."
"Seeing as this is the year that Winter seemingly won't let off it's death grip over the prairie. this is a well named brew and certainly worth a try."
"D. This is actually kind of light for a winter brew but all in all I like it and look forward to it next year"
"Feliz Navidad"
"However, the more I drink of it, the more I enjoy it, and I'm kinda glad that they didn't make it into some bastardized Extreme version. Browns are a bit of an underwhelming style and I always say that a good one is hard to come by. Check this one out if you are a fan of the style, and looking for something simple, yet sturdy and satisfying."
"(rated Apr 26, 2007)"
"Drinkability= To me it's not a big session beer. I think it's better as a sipper. I could take down at least 5 though..."
"Not a session beer being it's a little heavier, but meaty enough to keep you warm on a cool night."
"Good carbonation, not a bad winter beer."
"D: At 6.5% ABV and well rounded, it's not going to be hard to finish this. But it's a Sunday night, so I won't open another."
"Nice beer. Dark brown/ruby body with white lacing sticking to the side of the glass. Smells sweet, fruity, little hints of chocolate. Maybe a little floral hops in there as well. Taste is very fruity. I detect rasberry and toffee. Again hints of choclate in the aftertaste. Light to medium mouthfeel with good drinkability. Nice malty brown ale. Not alot of hops in there which is true to the Enlgish Style. Very smooth and pleasant to drink."
"English browns just don't seem to do bigger as well as some other styles. This isn't bad, but it isn't one I'd buy again."
"D: Only a couple would do me for this one. It's just way too sweet, way too thick, and way to spiced to be enjoyable as a session ale. I know that the purists out there are going to chastise me for calling any winter warmer a 'session ale', but some do follow that craving (ie. SN's Celebration Ale). I'm not regretting the purchase, but I'm not going to buy this again this year. Too many other choices out there."
"I like Lost Coast's downtown brown and this is probably a little better. Not bad at all."
"A pleasant brown, no denying that, but not too much character to it either. I have nothing bad to say about it regardless, and it would make a great intro or session ale for the style, but not enough there to keep me coming back for more personally."
"Overall: A great brown ale, easy drinking and enjoyable. Not overly complex or imposing, this is a great brew to simply enjoy. Recommended."
"The aroma was nice. It was a deep roasted malt with hints of chocolate overtones. It was full bodied and gave a sweet malt taste all the way though. There was a tad nuttiness and a tinge of bitterness on the finish. I found it to be a very enjoyable English Brown."
"Hardly a big beer, the drink is light-medium bodied with a little lingering slickness that makes it very drinkable."
"Drinks very easy, I like this big brother of downtown brown, quite a bit. This would be a staple if regularly available"
"D - This is a very good brown ale. It didn't look so good, but the smell and taste were quite good."
"The taste has plenty of the mentioned sweetness but also kicks in some hops for balance, especially in the finish. Slight alcohol tinge doesn't hurt the taste. Texture is crisp and clean for such a heavy style. I don't love this beer but it's a solid winter session brew and has enough zip and originality to keep you interested. Decent call."
"Beer poured a reddish brown with a small off white head. Nose is malty with no other special characteristics. Taste is interesting, taste somewhat like a red from the caramel malts but has chocolate creeping in. Beer finishes with a dry crisp hop. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and satisfying. Drinkability is good. This is a nice addition to the Christmastime rotation. It is recommended to try."
"Overall, a very good seasonal ale that goes well with many foods."
"Pours a hazy dark reddish muddy brown, decent off white head forms, settles down to a thin ring, some lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet and nutty, caramel, bread, light roast, light, bit of floral/citrus, cake, not bad. Taste is nice, grainy, caramel, solid nuttiness, bit of milk chocolate and light roast, floral, tons of malt, great. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, pretty slick, low carbonation, smooth and easy to put back. Very nice brown ale, flavour is solid and the mouthfeel is nice."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of mahogany, with a medium tan head - nose of nutty, roasted, malty, and light milk chocolate  taste of, malt, dark chocolate light hops, and hint of anise- body is full, smooth, and with low carbonation  aftertaste of bitter chocolate, slightly acidic, and roasted"
"D- A good winter beer. It is a bit heavy so not one to drink a lot of. It defiantly is a winter warmer."
"I found this to be a pleasant surprise - easy drinking and timely."
"A easy drinker, and a solid, yet unspectacular brown."
"I poured this beer into my tubler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice mahoganny color. It poured a fair head that oozed coffee and hints of toffee mingling nicely. I was excited. However, the taste was extremely bitter and ruff. To me the beer was an odd mix that could use some refinning, a good begginning but a ruff finish. I will not buy again."
"D: A good brown ale from Lost Coast, one of their better offerings, IMO, I could definitely see myself having this again, a good nightcap, for a lower alcohol beverage."
"Overall: I liked this one. I love the hoppy Christmas brews like celebration. This is no celebration, but alas it is a nicely hopped drinkable christmas brew."
"D: This beer was not easy to finish, however I did. It didn't really smell or taste like much of anything, however left me feeling a little buzzy. I would not buy this beer again."
"This beer pours a dark red-brown with fairly good head formation. Aroma is somewhat chocolate-y with a bit of Saaz hop aroma Flavor is rather sweet and malty that I found rather bock-like, with a bit of chocolate roastiness. Mouthfeel was nothing unusual, but maybe a bit harsh in its carbonation. Recommended, but nothing to write home about."
"Thanks to Talisker for the extra..."
"22oz bomber into snifter. A: Very dark, looks like a porter, chocolate head that went down fairly quick. S: Chocolate, coffee, lots of maltiness. A hint of soy sauce. T: Lots of coffee and chocolate continuing, the hops coming through toward the finish. Alcohol coming through a bit. M: Lots of carbonation, thinner mouthfeel than it looks. D: Mostly nice all around, but honestly nothing incredible. I may buy it again."
"This review is from a 22 oz bomber. Red brown in color with a light off-white head. Nose is distinctly chocolate. Smooth on the tongue. Flavors of carmel and malts, Hops are just right. This is a very well balanced brew. Love that artwork on the label. Way to go Lost Coast!"
"Altogether, a decent but not all that noteworthy brown. Dark brown color with a 1 finger head that doesn't really last. Taste is of roasted nuts and caramel malts, with a similar (although not very noticeable) smell. Mouth is a bit on the thin side, with a semi sharp finish. Good drinkability. Tis a decent brown, for sure. Just not something I'm going to remember really. Semi-recommended."
"Drinkability- It's okay. Nothing great, but not to aweful either."
"Little of the sweetness or malt of a brown ale, but lots of what you want in a porter (if you want a porter). A very good beer, depending on the style you place it in."
"An easy to drink beer because it does nothing to offend. It's not horrible, but unless everything else in the bar or store is, I'll not be coming back for this."
"This is a great stronger-than-usual brown ale. Its been winterized into a substantial, cold-weather warmer. The best beer I've had from Lost Coast yet!"
"D: Whereas I was not disappointed, I was expecting a little more body and flavor."
"D- enjoyable dessert type brew, good by average by lost coast standards, still worth a look"
"Medium body. Nice and crisp carbonation. The aftertaste is fairly light for being such a bold beer. Quite drinkable. I like it. Hard to say whether I like it more than the Downtown Brown, but they are both fine brown ales."
"The Winterbraun looks plenty appealing, with its ruby-tinged brown hue and voluminous foamy beige head. Malts and spice are pretty easy to pick up in the nose, but it's hard for me to identify anyone particular spice. I also pick up a bit of a black tea aroma. Smooth and juicy with raisiny caramel malts and a good dash of coffee flavors. A peculier bitterness pops up in the long finish, with a touch of bitter coffee grounds. More bitter than I expected, but still fairly easy drinking. A good brown ale."
"12 oz bottle Dark brown ale, very little head, small amount of lace. Aroma is slightly nutty but mainlly malty, slight spice. Sweet favour ,fruity malts, touch of coffee and a slight ""tang"" of hop. Ok on the palate, quite thin, but that is to style. Overall an average porter. I beleive this is more ofan English Porter than a brown ale."
"Chocolate-dipped mahogany with scarlet highlights. Undulating craters of sand-khaki foam. Softly fruity and slightly spicy hop aromas. Underlying scents of hazelnut and caramel. Cocoa-dusted almond flavors. Slight alcohol bite after noble hop spice and caramel-infused malt middle. Chewy up front with an almost slick dryness. Noticeable alcohol astringency. A very nice brown ale. It's refreshing to see a ""meatier"" rendition of this style as a winter seasonal rather than the more common spiced holiday ales many breweries offer at this time of year. In all, memorable, quaffable, and worth picking up an entire six-pack."
"Winterbraun pours a reddish brown color with a thin light tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is quite mild, its a bit fruity, and a bit nutty. Taste is kind of average, slightly fruity, a bit nutty, a bit of cocoa. Not unpleasant, but doesn't get me excited either."
"Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights, topped by a huge khaki-colored head that leaves a ton of creamy lace on the glass. Very impressive-looking. Aroma of roasted malt and a touch of mocha. Palate is sweet roasted malt up front, with a tangy floral hoppiness emerging before the swallow. Aftertaste is a touch bitter, a nice break from some of the milder brown ales. Body is smooth and rather creamy. A tasty seasonal ale that's a nice change of pace from the usual winter warmers and IPAs."
"D: Nice flavor, good balance. I don't know that this beer really stood out from the pack, but there's not much to dislike. Recommended."
"Pours a thick dark brown, almost black with a 1 inch caramel head, quickly fades, with some residual lace. Smell right off is chocolate, spice, and caramel. Taste is almost coffee like, very nice actually, with a good hoppy after taste. This was very smoothe, somewhat thick but not overally so at all. Its seems very drinkable and I was suprised as I usually do not like darker beers, but this was very welcomed."
"Another worthy effort from Lost Coast."
"I could drink a couple or three of these, but no more. The alcohol I can definately feel and they are very filling"
"taste is weak, maltiness, some sweetness, hints of chocolate and nuts with a bitterness that follows.i also tasted the alcohol. the flavors are lacking in complexity and the carbonation leaves quickly,"
"Easy to drink, moderate alcohol content, it's got a medium body and a light creamy mouthfeel. A good winter brew that certainly fits it's style...enjoy it !"
"Drinkability: One of the better English Browns I have tasted but the style doesn't do much for me"
"chocolate brown appearance, with prominent licorice and hops and malt in the nose. Hoppy in front, then maltiness, including cocoa and spice like nutmeg in finish. Bit of bitterness in aftertaste. A nice one. Good mouthfeel for a well carbonated beverage."
"Mouthfeel- A very smooth ale with more sweetness than expected. Sweet and roasted malts mixed well with the English style hop flavors. Making for a very well balanced EBA."
"Pours with no real head, just a faint ring of tan foam. It's seems somewhat cloudy but hard to tell as the brown color is fairly dark. The smell is a nice mix of toasted chocolate and Saaz hops, however it only barely makes its way to the nose. The taste begins with a sweet chocolate flavor, then turns dry with a moderate, nutty bitterness. The flavor didn't initially impress but it opens up after awhile and does become a bit sweeter. Has a slight thickness on the tongue and carbonation is good. Tasting more like a porter, I thought this brown ale was very drinkable, but I expected there to be a little more sweetness from the malt. I like this beer as a winter seasonal, but I didn't notice the spiciness as they claimed on the description. Fine with me anyway, I liked the style..."
"Mouth feel is medium in body and moderately carbonated."
"I liked it and wouldn't turn it down if offered and I would enjoy drinking it again but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"This beer has a great bottle smell. Smells like the homemade chocolate syrup for ice cream my mom used to make. Poured it into a 12 oz chalice. The color is also very chocolatey. The taste is very chocolatey. Surprised this bottle didn't have a Nestle's Special Dark wrapper on it. This isn't what I expected for a ""brown"" ale but I am pleasantly surprised by this flavor. This is a very sweet beer, very smooth and very sweet. The mouthfeel is pure chocolate and the beer is consistent throughout with a sweet finish. I wonder if I could pour this on some vanilla ice cream? Very smooth brew but really sweet. My new microbrew source grocery store had this brew in a 50% off cart. Should have bought all they had it would probably store well."
"Pours a rather dull, transluscent brown with a thin tan head thats gone quickly. The aroma is a big improvement however, with nice chocolate and earthy malt character, as well as some grassy and floral hops. The flavor is nice and malty, with chocolate, toasted bread and earthy flavors dominating, as well as some subdued floral and grassy hops and a slight hint of alcohol and some hazelnut coming through in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side but not bad, and drinkability is pretty good. An enjoyable winter seasonal from loast coast, subtle and rewarding."
"Drinkability: While I do enjoy this one, it will only be occasionally that I endulge in it. The flavors are pronounced, and without the hops I crave, it will be relegated to times when I need to take a hops break."
"After its release from the 12-ounce brown bottle it sets in the glass a nice deep brown with a modest light tan semi-creamy head that after its dissolving leaves a velum like coating of lace upon the glass. Nose has a nice malt sweet aroma, hints of caramel, quite a pleasing nose I must say, start is sweet with a nice grain presence, top is light to medium in feel. Finish is delectably acidic, the hops delightfully spicy and the aftertaste dry, a decent winter beer, and one I always purchase as it makes a nice end of day beer."
"cheers..."
"Pours a hazey dark reddish brown. The aroma consists mainly of chocolate with hints of toffee and a hoppy finish. The chocolate from the aroma mixes with coffee to make up the body of the flavor with a nice hoppy finish. This is not an overly complex ale, and that's good it doesn't have to be. A damn fine brew to enjoy in those cold months."
"CHOCOLATE MILK!! This tastes like nesquick on crack to me, i love it. A dessert beer. 12 oz stubby bottle w/snowboarding dood on it. This poured a nice deep mohogony brown. Very hazy looking. Beautiful creamy foamy godlike tan head with some good lacing. Aroma is nice and roasty with strong chocolate milk/cocoa and coffee flavors. The taste is so damn smooth and chocolately. Very sweet. At first it tastes like dark chocolate, but this contains some serious nesquick flavors. Wintery spices are present. Nice malts but hoppy enough to balance. This is sort of a combination between a porter, and a wintery brown ale. Dark brown ale of light mustyness amazingness. This one surprisingly kicked my ass, guess I am having a weird night. Smoothish cream feel to the mouth. Very flavorfull, very drinkable. One of the more enjoyable winter beers I have had."
"Poured a deep, dark brown with a thin, light tan head that dissipated quickly. A well carbonated beverage. Smell was malt, pure and simple, with mostly caramel aromas with some toastiness coming through. Not much else going on. Taste was similar to smell with some faint spice trying to come through. A little more hops or some other spice would probably do the trick for me. Felt clean on the mouth with lots of body. Personally, I could only have one of these as a change of pace and move on to something else. The caramel malt flavor is a little too much for me."
"Pours coca-cola-like, with a tan, quickly dissipating head. Good carbonation though. Smell chocolate, caramel, and hazelnut - its definitely a brown ale. Never had the Downtown Brown, so I don't know how this compares, but this is a solid brown ale, with a seasonal twist (some added hoppy kicks). Not bad at all. I prefer it to the overpowering Rogue hazelnut brown ale (which is excellent, but too rich for me to enjoy much of except in particular moods)."
"After initial strong carbonation this has a creamy feel and a pleasantly chocolatey flavour with just enough hops to prevent it from being sickeningly sweet. This isn't something I would want to consume regularly, but it is well balanced and rather well done all round."
"I thought it was a fairly decent beer although I could only have one maybe two twelve ouncers in a night. Not because of ABV as this version is still a solid but not overwhelming 6.5%. Pick up a sixer and give it a whirl."
"When poured, the color reminded me of root beer. The same brown, but not as thick. The smell of sweet roasted malts filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. But, that was the high side, the low is that, the flavor was of a hoppy nature, with no roasted malt taste. Not much anyway. The piney, hoppy flavor is not what I expected in a brown ale. The aroma was great, but the flavor of a hoppy brown ale was a turn off!"
"Pours a translucent dark brown, reminiscent of a classic English Nut Brown with an inch of slightly off-white head that slowly settles down into the liquid. The noise is full of malts and chocolate, both scents are almost overpowering. The beer has a strong initial taste of heavy malts and hazelnut, but finishes quickly and smoothly. Rather refreshing but awfully light considering the style. Decent winter seasonal from Lost Coast for malt heads (hop heads beware)."
"Winterbraun pours murky mahogany with a head that barely eclipses half an inch in height, tan in color, and has the consistency of heavy cream. Not much lacing clings to the glass, more like swaths of pasty residue. Still, it's an attractive beer. Smell: Warm notes of chocolate, a few strands of honey, caramel, some enjoyably raspy hop undertones; smells like a brown ale should, just with more bulk. In fact, this simply smells like a bigger version of Lost Coast's excellent Downtown Brown. Taste: The use of Saaz hops (typically used for pilsners) is noticeable right away on the tip of my palate, mildly peppery, followed by a steep drop into dark chocolate, and some hints of powdered sugar; the finish flows back to the hops, unique for a brown ale, spicy, even tangy. A little thin in the mouth, but that's forgivable. Crisply carbonated."
" A bit different than other winter warmers, the chocolate comes out as the beer warms up. Also notable is the use of Saaz hops, which typically are associated with pilsners...they add a nice spice. Certainly worth a try."
"12 ounce bottle sampled, no freshness/bottling date etc etc offered. Pours chestnut brown and clear with a tan head that leaves decent fine and drippy lacing. Nose is faintly of sweet bready malt. This is a mellow British all the way Brown ale. Smooth, sweet, satisfying and subtle. Mild undertones of orangy fruit under a layer of chocolate flavors. Drying mild finish. Nice take on the style, fine sessioner"
"The taste has those same sweet concentrated fruit notes up front, and even through to the finish. It is not overly sweet, and is even fairly light on the palate, though it does have enough of a richness and palate to it that this is appropriate for the colder months. This beer has notes of sweet plum, fig. There is a mix between spicy hop notes (with a bit of citrus character thrown into the mix) and a bit of sharp carbonation that helps to balance the fruity sweet character. The finish has a light bitterness and a hint of lingering roasted astringency. As the beer warms up a bit the roasted notes begin to become more noticeable. This beer is nicely drinkable, and it is complex enough that the flavor keeps me intrigued throughout the drinking experience; from the fruit to the roast malt to the American hop notes. I could perhaps wish for a bit more depth to the malt character, but like I said it is quite enjoyable as is."
"Note: My bottle lists the ABV as 6.5% rather than the 5% given by BA."
" Solid medium body is the glue that holds this one together. All the understated flavors come thru and make this an enjoyable and very drinkable Brown Ale. Finish is firmly bitter but again, the malt hangs in there on the edges to keep it in balance. Not what you might expect from a winter offering ( what do Californians know about winter anyway??) but a damn fine brown ale no matter what the season."
"It was okay, dog."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and roasted crystal malt scent with a mild hop aroma. It is smooth and creamy. The taste is good. It has a really sweet and toastey ""brown ale"" flavor that boasts of crystal, victory, and roasted barley. It is sweeter than most, but it goes down easy. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good ""American"" brown ale. It is sweeter than the Euro version and not as dry. It has good aroma and flavor; a good drinker."
"Drinkability is good. This isn't a beer I would seek out again but it is a mild and pleasing beer."
"Nice, though."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" light brown head over the slightly cloudy reddish brown brew. Head fades but not completely, with average lacing. Aroma is sweet grain husks with slight hops presence. Taste is pleasantly grainy up front, a slight yet notable hops bite, with a lingering presence coating the mouth. Better than I expected. Mouthfeel is good, maybe a bit thin, and drinkability is excellent. A brown worth checking out."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Pours into the imperial pint glass a very deep red with some brown and has a 1 finger off-white head that reduces to a thin blanket, leaving minimal lacing. The beer looks unfiltered when held to the light. Smell is of hop spiciness, dark fruit, molasses, chocolate, and caramel with a hint of tropical fruit. Hops taste spicy and citric (grapefruit) with a nice bitterness, while the malts contribute caramel, chocolate, molasses, and a little bit of coffee. The flavors become more pronounced as the beer warms. The beer coats the mouth well, feels fairly thick, and leaves a warming sensation (6.5%, according to the bottle). I could easily make this a session beer on a winter night."
"Pours a rich mahogany with some nice ruby highlights when the light hits it. Nice 2 finger light khaki head that lingers and laces well. Smell is of cocoa, some light spice with a hint of bitterness from coffee or burnt sugar. Taste is nice with a rich cocoa taste with just enough of the burnt sugar and coffee backing it up to keep the beer from being sweet. No really hoppyness, but finishes pretty dry maybe due to the roasted malts giving it a bit of bitterness. Nice carbonation and medium to full mouthfeel. Drinkability is a bit above average. I would have this again and make it a once and a while beer, but its not something I could have more than one of once in a while. While it was tasty it was just a bit rich to consume that often"
"The rich, cocoa-ish flavor of Lost Coast's Winterbraun should be welcome at any time of year! It's dark chestnut body appears a clear burgundy when held to the light, and its creamy tan cap holds fairly well before dropping to a razor thin lid. The aroma is somewhat subdued, but wafts of cocoa, caramel, and even some very-mild background hops appear. Its smooth and creamy, medium-full body accentuates its maltiness which is caramelish, cocoa-like, and mildly fruity (raisins, fig). It's laced with low-key hop flavors; and balanced by a restrained bitterness that let's the malt shine through, yet still finish dry. Quite nice!"
"This beer pours a reddish mahogany with a tan head that leaves minimal laces. It looks a little thin. It smells malty with hints of coffee and fruity. Maybe a little nutty also. It tastes malty with a little chocolate. There is a little sweetness to it also. It goes down relatively smooth. There might be just a little too much carbonation. It leaves a nutty aftertaste. I think I could probably drink a few of there beers, but after a little while, I would probably desire something a bit more robust. Defianatley worth a try though."
"Overall impression: Nice brown with a bit more going on than most. Kind of like a mixture of a brown and a porter. Great beer for winter or any other time."
"Winterbraun isn't very wintry (other than the Dali-esque snowboarder on the label), but it is a good English brown ale that is helped by a greater than usual amount of hops. Although it has a few minor flaws, the bottom of the glass didn't take long to appear."
"The taste let me down. It was too burnt tasting and the finish was too thick and sticky on my tongue. I wouldn't drink this one again."
"Part of the BIF X-Mas package from shippos, this beer poured out reddish brown with a cloud of suspended yeast particles in suspension. The head was about an inch thick, off white in color, and did not hang around for too long. The aroma was roasty malt with notes of coffee and chocolate. The taste was like a thinned out porter, sweet and roasty with toffee, chocolate, and a touch of weak coffee. Hops were quite low in bitterness and mostly lurking in the background. Despite the lack of complexity, the alcohol was quite well hidden, and the beer was much easier to drink than its strength suggested."
"Drinkability- I'll pass on this one. Finished it, but it wasn't easy for me."
"Though I find it to be entirely agreeable, I can't ever imagine having more than one of these over a period of several days. It's just not that drinkable. Worth picking up, definately, as it's a quite unique winter beer, but I'm afraid you might be nursing that six pack for the entire season."
"Overall: Tasty stuff, I like the brews from Lost Coast, but so often I am blighted with old samples it seems. This is most certainly a fresh sample and it shows how good the Lost Coast brews can be when properly presented. A tasty Winter brew, worth seeking out!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Nicely balanced. Light and well carbonated helps to make this quite drinkable. It's not too thin to be a winter beer, but it's not so thick that you struggle to get through it. I found this quite interesting, and it will encourage me to try other beers from this brewery. Disregard the awful label, as it looks like a cheap satire of neo-cubism and is probably unaware of it own ugliness."
"Forms a slight tan head, not much remaining but a ring after too long. Smells of roasted chocolate malt, with a slight hint of caramel sneaking in the back door. This is a beer that would be enjoyable most of the year if it was available. I bought this six pack on a cold, foggy, overall shitty day, and the next day it was sunny and fairly warm. Both were great days for Winterbraun. There is just a little too much carbonation hitting my tongue to make this more than just a good beer, but it is a welcome change-up in the winter seasonal selection. A nice switch from it's base recipe, Downtown Brown. One last thing- my bottle says 6.5% abv., not 5."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Pours a dark redish brown with a tan 2 finger fluffy head that falls and laces really well. Aroma is nutty sweet lightly toasted malt hints of chocolate some light herbal hops. Taste is same as aroma but more pronounced taste is toasted malty nutty with sweet hints of chocolate and finishes with lightly spicey hops and some bitterness. Overall a good brown ale nnothing to complain about. Mouthfeel is middle of medium. Drinkability is good a nice brown ale don't know why its a winter brew but nice anyway."
"Standard pour into a Delirium tolip yields a dense, chunky brown head with lite lacing. Aroma is all dark malts upfront with a bittersweet blend of chocolate and coffe. Taste is rich and chocolate malty, creamy and nut-like. Very pleasing flavor profile with a somewhat chewy mouthfeel. Would have scored higher on mouthfeel but it's a bit over-carbonated. Finishes with a touch of dry hop flavor. Well balanced and easy to drink. The lable is funny too, a black dude snowboarding =winter brown...funny!"
"Does this come in kegs? I hope so."
"Pours a deep rich brown with a thin but well retained off white head,big caramel in the aroma up front along with a nice aroma of roasted nuts that lingers nicely a nice combination in a winter seasonal brew.The flavors alot like aroma some caramel and roasted nut with a touch of spice ending with a dry earthiness,a big winner for the style in my opinion very flavorful.A good beer for cold weather would be great on cask I bet but Iam sure I'll never know,well done."
"Transparent, dark brown colored beer with a caramel hue. Small cream colored head never amounts to much and faded rather quickly to a film. Nice rich cocoa aroma. Mellow yet flavorfull cocoa flavor is fairly creamy. I swear there's some hops in there towards the end, but they blend so well I can't quite pick it out. Soft, mildly carbonated mouthfeel. A brown ale that is full in both flavor and aroma. A very solid brown ale."
"Lots of caramel in the taste of this one, though not overpowering. It is well balanced by crisp hops toward the middle; the bottle says Saaz were used, so that seems to fit. Toward the finish there is a sugary, sweet taste - the reviewer before me called it a cakeiness, and i would agree. Some subtle spicing too toward the end. Overall nicely balanced. Not the most memorable winter beer i've had, but still a good effort and would make a nice beer to have a few of after a long day out in the cold."
"Didnt mind this at all. Spicy cookie/cakie flavours, some chocolate, raisin, with light bitterness, some tart acidity. Pretty tasty , as most things from Lost Coast were, this was a bottle purchased from a shop in San Francisco, which i can't for the life of me remember."
"The taste is a nice typical porter taste with a rather malty finish, that is almost nutty. The hops are subdued but present. Overall a nice well balanced beet that I will enjoy again as soon as I can find some more."
"It tastes like there's a pinch of hard alcohol in there, which I think holds it back. That's the only thing holding it back, though."
"Deep brown without much light brown head and it doesn't stay up there too long. Aroma is heavily malty with distinct milk chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla and nutty hints: I could indeed mistake this smell as a porter blind. It's got a nice nutmeg and almond bite in mouth coupled with dark licorice and a low-profile hop character that leaves a boring unfresh bitterness, while aftertaste is bready, mostly dry and short. Cheers to Matta!"
"This is a great brown ale..very tasty and easy drinking despite the fullness of it....quality beer here..."
"12 oz stubby brown bottle with a cartoonish snowboarder. Pours a shiny deep black, not brown. Head is a creamy full rich khaki beauty. Roasted barley aromas. Slight chocolate and coffee bitterness. Taste is perfectly smooth, lots of full rich chocolate flavors up front. Hints of roasted espresso bitterness, very rich and full flavored. Cinnamon and nutmeg dance around, but not as pronounced as an Anchor OSA, but well on the way to it.Mellow smooth chocolate malt washes over and lingers during the aftertaste. Pushes the limits of a brown ale, borders on an American Porter along the lines of Anchor, and reminds me alot of Anchor OSA. A real treat to find in Ft. Pierce. The BelgianBum and I relieved the store of their current inventory. I might even send one to a friend in New England or I might just drink them all."
"Appearance: Dark brown ruby tone with a nice bubbly tan head leaves nicely dispersed lacing can't complain here. Aroma: Dark roasts with mild spicing and finishing hops who can say anything bad at this point. Taste: Full flavored charred sugar dark roasts bring chocolate and coffee tones not bad at all full developed flavor finishing hops that bring a lasting effect to the overall tase. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied ale with a strong carbonation excellent mouthfeel almost chewy to me. Drinkability: If you sit around and analyze this beer like we're doing know you can't do anything but love this beer."
"This is the Shakespeare Stout of Brown Ales."
"Deep crimson/brown/ruby. Not a lot of light getting through. Nice little tight creamy beige head. A nice collar forms as it recedes and laces quite fully. Nice roasty, chocolatey smell doused with some West Coast hop flavors. Now this brown has some character to it. The roasted bitterness melds well with the hop bitterness. It's definitely bitter. Almost like a porter that way. There's some great hop flavors that add depth to it as well. Seemingly a little citric and piney, but they come off a little differntly in this beer surrounded by the brown/porter characteristics. Mouthfeel is creamy to an extent. The body is a little better than medium Quite an enjoyable brown ale at that."
"Comments  The ABV is up to 6.5% now since the beer was added and the tasting notes have changed a lot. Maybe this ale has morphed over the years?"
"Pours an opaque dark chocolate brown with some ruby notes. Not much of a head despite an agressive pour--what little head is more fizzy than fluffy. Smell is sweet with a faint roasted aroma. Taste is mostly sweet with some nice roasted notes--milk chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel is thinner than I would like in a winter brew, however there is a very nice crisp bite to every sip from the carbonation which disguises what hops may be present. Overall not my favorite winter warmer, but an interesting beer with its assertive crispness. I was expecting more from Lost Coast on this one, its not too different from their year round brown--Downtown Brown."
"Poured a deep dark thick brown with a mild beige head. Aroma is of chocolate,coffee,nutmeg,malt and hops.er. Upon drinking, I taste a spiced porter that gives a bit of a roasted stout kick upon finish. Spices are more predominant in the aroma than the taste. This beer is highly drinkable, but I didn't find myself savoring it as much as other winter beers I've had. Another solid turnout from Lost Coast Brewery."
"Light bodied with decent carbonation and good drinkability."
"(22 oz. bottle)"
"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate and malts. Deeply roasted chocolate malts. Chocolate and coffee predominate. A medium bodied porter. Chocolate throughout, there are also some spices going on here. Nutmeg and allspice? Nice tasting beer. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty sweet with a very slight bitterness. The coffee flavor lingers on."
"Dark black in color with a decent head. Chocolate and spices come across in the nose. Flavor had some chocolate notes, but was also unmistably spiced. My guesses on spices used would be nutmeg and pine. Spices were high enough in volume, that it lowered the drinkability quite a bit."
