"Lite Amber pour with off white head. Clove  and spice notes. Clove,banana,spices and honey. Lite mouthfeel. Honey is cloying."
""
""
""
"Overall, very subtle aroma, but the spice comes through in the flavor. Has the body of a heavy lager, very smooth, a nice winter brew."

"Great December beer, drink before Jan."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is another excellent beer from Great Lakes!  I love the malt and the gingerbread-like sweetness and spice!  Delicious!  I’ll definitely get this every Christmas time!"
""
""

""
""
""
"Dark Amber color, smooth spice taste, this was my introduction into ""specialty"" (non bud light) beer"
""
""
""
"Great beer only available during holidays"
""
"Pours a nice dark copper/red color with off-white head. Spice, cinnamon, ginger, and caramel malt on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with more spice. Good winter beer."
""
""
""
"On tap at Side Door, Madison. A quality spiced winter warmer, though too sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice and pleasant Christmas beer. Spices seem well balanced and an interesting selection at that. While spiced beers aren't my everyday cup of tea, I could enjoy a few of these annually over the holiday season."
"A very good holiday ale. You can definitely taste the cinnamon, ginger, and spices. The beer is moderately malty. The aroma is very weak though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable beer, but there are better warmers out there."
""
""
"A real winter warmer here, and an annual favorite. Bottle pour - kicks up a nice off white head with clinging lace. Deep copper/orange in color with a slight unfiltered look. The nose is ginger, orange peel and christmas candles. Taste wise, the nose sits true, with a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon and a dollop of honey - maybe a tad more here than previous years, which have had a little more heat. Quite a heavy mouthfeel, which has a thick throat covering sensation which seems to come from the honey. This is a satisfying festive ale with pronounced spices."
"This is the first ""Christmas Ale"" I've tried so I have nothing to compare it with but I thought it was a really good beer."
"One of my favorite Xmas ales."
""
"O - My only problem is the sour elements almost eclipse the spice and sweet malts. Rather than complimenting the bread and spice, it tugs against it, leaving me wishing I could dial down this element."
""
""
"Pours an amber color with an off-white head that fizzes away rather quickly. The smell is full of sweet aromas such as vanilla and sugar. The taste was not as sweet as I thought with some of the vanilla and caramel but then balances with some spice that makes it much more drinkable. There was a bit of a creamy aftertaste which was very nice as well."
""
"Very bitter. Doesn't leave a nice after taste either. Friends and family like it but I'm not a fan. Not a fan of the spice."
""
"This was my favorite Christmas / Winter warmer for the 2014 season. Just the right amount of spices, but not too overbearing."
""
""
""
""
"I've enjoyed the GL xmas ale in this past however this year I was disappointed. It overall felt very heavy, too dark and was not as enjoyable to drink as it has been in previous years"
""
""
"A nice, pleasing Xmas ale, but a little too much nutmeg/clove for my taste.  Otherwise, a very pretty beer with a pleasing nose (holiday appropriate!) and is relatively easy drinking."
""

"Overall: Solid Christmas beer. Nice amount of Christmas flavor going on here."
""
"Not bad, a little sweet"
""
""
"This stuff is good for a beer or 2. Don't buy a 12 pack and think you will enjoy the whole pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, hot damn, wow and holy crap! This is probably one of my favorite winter warmers I've ever had. I wish I could get this on a regular basis."

"A brew like this highlights the fact that during the Fall, people don't like pumpkin; they like pumpkin spice. This beer has almost the exact same flavor profile as most pumpkin beers, albeit with a much smoother and sweeter malt base (and obviously, no pumpkin)."
"Nice winter brew, hard to find."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"12/9...pours bright copper red, little foam that settles out. Hearty mulled spice nose, ginger bread, cherries, toffee. Taste is a sweet malt, fruity, juicy, clove bitter, flat soda close. Honey sweetness more than anything. One and done."
""
""
"Great Christmas ale. Not too heavy, not too thick. Great taste. Great way to make a terrible holiday party easier to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear Amber with reddish hues and a small khaki head that faded to nothing and didn't leave any lacing.  I didn't see it mentioned but mine had some noticeable sediment floating.  Aromas of honey, caramel, cherry, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Taste hits up front with caramel and light cherry flavor, nutmeg and cinnamon spices hit mid palate and it finishes with an earthy hop bite woven with some honey, cherry and spice notes.  Thin end of medium body, sharp carbonation.  Bit of spice laden finish that lingers and tastes, off.  Overall one of the better Christmas ales I've had, it could use a touch less spice and a clean up on the finish."
"Not a fan of this one at all! It smells & tastes like something from Sam Adams, but worse.  Great Lakes is one of my favorite breweries,  but I think they dropped the ball on this one!"
""
""
"An excellent locally brewed seasonal beer from Great Lakes Brewing Co. Great taste and readily available!"
""
""
"A much better version of Pete's Wicked Winter."
""
"Did a Holiday beer tasting with the wife. You can smell the spices on this one. Doesn't really smell like a winter warmer to me. The taste is sweet and chewy. A little too sweet for my taste. My wife loves it though. Almost buttery sweetness if that makes sense."
""
""
""
""
"Great seasonal beer. A good six pack of go-to beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: [3.75] This is a nice beer.  It tastes more like a spiced lager to me.  The taste is sweet and nice.  Very rich malty backbone.  There is a low hop level (none detectable).  I would drink another - but if I am buying I would get something different."

"Overall, the beer feels like a lower ABV version of Mad Elf, which isn't necessarily bad. The sweetness definitely makes me think of Christmas and the honey is pretty good. However, I can't really see drinking more than one of these a day. Despite this, I think that this is still a pretty good beer worth getting. I can certainly see what Great Lakes was going for (a beer reminiscent of red Christmas ornaments) and they definitely succeeded. I would definitely recommend getting a six-pack of this. I wouldn't recommend finishing it in one session."

"Copper color. Bready and malty nose.  The seasonal spices merge well with the malt base.  The finish has a touch of sweet and the potent essence of cinnamon."

"At fridge temps, it's refreshing with a nice bitterness and very subtle spice vibe in the background.  As it warms up a little, it really opens up - the bitterness all but disappears, and a nice gingerbread spice flavor takes center stage.  It's a tasty, interesting sipper."

"I did a side-by-side this weekend with Thirst Dog's 12 Dogs of Christmas. GLBC was lighter in color, lighter on spices & hoppier. If you prefer hoppier, this is the Christmas Ale for you. I prefer the spice & therefore the 12 Dogs. Both are great holiday ales!"

"Great Lakes Christmas Ale brewed by Great Lakes Brewing Co., with an ABV 7.50% This brew pours out a light brown color with a nice white head. This is a filtered brew you can see right though it.  The smell is rich with spices and grains.  You also pick on some sweetness in the smell. The taste is bold with flavor, you pick up on the sweetness in this brew. You also pick up on the spies in this brew.  The mouthfeel is nice, bold and clean. This brew has a nice balance to it for having an ABV of 7.50%, you can not tell the high ABV.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew.  Great Lakes Brewing Co, did a nice job with this one.  I would buy this brew again. Thank You Great Lakes Brewing Co."

"Easily the most overrated craft beer in my opinion, While its not bad. I am totally at a loss as to why the hype machine gets fired up the way it does over this beer. It doesn't seem to have any one thing that stands out as a beer worth seeking out. I suppose its less about how bad this beer is, and more about how many other amazing Christmas Ales and craft beers are out there~"

"Bought some of this at local Kroger store, yes, grocery store to try... not bad, basic winter style beer... tastes good, great ruby red/rust color... but surprisingly no aroma... but again, good drinking beer and seasonal."

"Ginger, and lots of it. If you used to like Great Lakes Christmas ale and think it just isn't what you remembered. Try Thirsty Dogs ""Twelve Dogs of Christmas", it's the old GL Xmas ale recipe"

"A must have for the Christmas season. Guaranteed to keep you warm on the cold winter nights. One thing I have noticed is that the taste seems to change year to year. I personally enjoy this brew with a nice coating of cinnamon and sugar along the rim of the glass! Great Lakes never disappoints!"

"O: Being perfectly honest, I have this over a 4 largely due to previous years. The 2014 batch seems fairly on point, though a bit more to the citric-floral hoppy side than I recall previous years being. I'd have liked a sweeter, maltier beer, but this one is still tasty and enjoyable. There's also always next year's batch!"

"Did a beer swap of another Great Lakes beer for a Christmas Ale. Went from bottle to tall chilled glass. Great pour, about 1/2 inch of head on it. Smell is winter seasonal (cinnamon) but not over powerful. Feel is a little effervescent but not over done. If you are a Troeg's Mad Elf fan you are expecting to get beat up on the flavor (it is only 7.5% ABV as compared to 12.5%, but it is smooth. Beer goes down nicely. Not my favorite from Great Lakes, but I do like them all!"

"Copper color with a thin white head. Smells great, of honey, cinnamon, and fruit. My first time with this I was unimpressed, but on a second visit from the same six pack I had a completely different experience. A sweet honey and fruit taste, with a hint of cinnamon and other spices. Smooth with a medium body feel. Very tasty."
""
""
"Overall, Great Lakes Christmas Ale is an easy drinking holiday ale that has just the right amount of spice for my palate."
"O - Overall this is a staple in my fridge over the winter, but it's more of a one and done beer for me. The cinnamon honey and spice start to wreak havoc after two or three bottles"
"*from notes 01.08.14"
""
""
""
"With so many Christmas beers out there, I am so glad I snagged Great Lakes Christmas Ale up! Its a perfect mix of spices and flavor that just gives this Ale such a perfect taste. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good beer around the holidays. Even light beer drinkers will enjoy this at a family party. Either way its a win win, great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As much I have been happy with Great Lakes in the past, I feel like as much as I should have probably had this a bit fresher, I don't think this would have been any less sweeter in the end. The ingredients are thankfully well presented, but the amount of residual sugars I had to wade through to get to them did not make it wholly worthwhile. Nevertheless, I'll happily give this a re-review when it comes out this year if I'm able to get my hands on a fresh bottle."

"Had on tap in Cleveland airport and carried 6 to go - way to go in terminal brewpubs in Cleveland! A great holiday beer taking a more subtle and unique approach to holidays flavors - honey, cinnamon, ginger, all come through but not overwhelming. Consistent with GL beers- very clean, well made, and easy to go through a few in a single session."
""
""
""
""
"Note: I paired this one with a little pineapple upside-down cake. Not bad!"
""

"This beer pours from the bottle with a beautiful, clear, pure amber color and a modest and fleeting off-white head. The aroma is spicy and somewhat fruity, with a traditional mulling spice combination being contrasted against notes sweet orange peel and honey-dipped bread (a challah, if you will). The flavor likewise features a forward use of cinnamon and ginger, but the rich bready malts provide a ""soft"" base from which the assertive spices emerge. The spicing isn't overly aggressive, but it definitely in front and deftly hides the 7.5% alcohol content. The fine, prickly carbonation emphasizes these spicy characteristics but hides the sweetness a bit, which is unfortunate. Overall, this is a lovely holiday beer, but I don't know that I'd want it more year-round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is okay, kinda a bit spice beer fatigue with this one coming right after pumpkin beer season. I prefer the way pumpkin helps spiced beers and I can tell it;s missing in a beer like this. Could have used more of a ginger and honey presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer pours a candied red/amber, almost like a dark fruit punch. It forms a soda-like head of spritzy white bubbles that fade into a scrim. In body the beer is thin and crystal clear, with only a bit of haze coming from its darker coloring. On the nose, the beer smells of soft, warm spices and an indiscriminately fruity malt. The spices are hard to pinpoint, but could contain nutmeg… The smell is softly spicy and festive, but not overwhelmingly pleasing. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and spicy. The spice tends far more towards the “Christmas spice” realm than towards the kick of pepper. The sweet malt almost tastes like fruit juice, and is balanced out by the spice which moves in on the middle and finish of the sip. Soft bitterness and light acidity accompany the spice for added balance. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet fruit juice, somewhere between generic fruit punch and apple juice. In the middle of the sip, the winter spices bowl onto the palate, giving hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, and generic spice. The finish is of strong winter spices with a touch of grassy bitterness. The fruit juice flavors give a touch of cranberry juice in the finish, which is festive and odd. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium, practically light, with an oddly watery mouthfeel and a soft carbonation. The mouth is left with a light spice burn, some dryness, and some saliva in the cheeks. Overall, I’m a bit underwhelmed by this iteration. It has some nice winter spice, but the malt character is oddly like fruit juice, which I don’t much care for. This is an interesting beer, but I want more bread and caramel malt flavors and less fruit juice. The spicing is nice, if a bit too much on the end. Not a bad winter warmer, but not my favorite."

"O- an almost excellent winter beer."
""
""
""
"Again, this reminds me of a lot of the pumpkin beers yet the ginger, for me, gives this the edge to give this that christmas feel. Shared some this year with my BMC friends who all agreed this was a quality beer. Nothing is worse than weighing your friends and family down with heavy beers. GL Christmas ale is a great choice for yourself and to share during a festive time such as this."
""
""
"Overall - This is an excellent Christmas Ale, though its legend seems to be elevated by scarcity. Still love the chase."
""

"Overall an average winter warmer for me."
""
"Overall: i found the flavors to be nice in this one but it was just too weak in flavor and smell for me. a lot tastier that the other spiced winter warmers ive had"
"Picked up a growler for our Christmas party, enjoyed out of a pint glass. The color was actually pretty nice, a good looking brownish amber with an off-white head. The flavor had the requisite spices, particularly cinnamon and nutmeg, but it was a bit weak for my liking."
""
""
"O: I found this to be an interesting winter warmer that has some nice holiday spices and seems easier to drink compared to other beers in the style since it isn't that heavy in body."

""

""

"Overall, a very, very good winter/christmas ale; heavier spice doses work well in these ales compared to pumpkins because of the heavier malt flavors, a great brew."

"Pours a clear medium amber. Nice head and lacing that diminishes in about 2 minutes. Nose is mostly malt sweetness against a hint of soft spice. Medium bodied with a nice slick feel and well carbonated. The taste is slightly sweet with only a suggestion of spice, creating a nice balance of flavor that is subdued when compared to ST 2Xmas, which accentuates spice flavor. A nice crisp finish that brings the carbonation and spices (ginger and cinnamon) a bit more forward. If you want sweet with a hint of spice, then this beer is for you. If you prefer spice flavor, go with Southern Tier 2Xmas. Both are expertly crafted brews that achieve their respective flavor profiles."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: See Disclosure. Pairs wonderfully with Thanksgiving turkey, football chili or Jameson neat."
""
"This one had a full malt mouthfeel. A grainy texture of caramel and nuts. The honey and the fruit could have been more powerful but they laid out restrained and somewhat flat. The spices were too faint in the drink to make a difference in the taste. It drank a bit heavy and slow. It needed something to contrast the nutty bready flavor and give it a lift on the palate."

"Pure ruby red color, which is festive and beautiful. I get some spices on the nose. Not a big aroma at all. I get some orange, cinnamon spice, and a bit of pie spice in the body. It's really a bit flat for me. Mouthfeel is normal for this style. Overall, I don't think I'd go for this beer even during the holidays. It feel short in the base beer for me, so the minimal spices just didn't elevate it enough."
""
"The alcohol was present but because the spice was so pronounced, I felt that it did more of the warming than the booze did. By the end of the bottle, the strength of this could be felt but not to the point where I wouldn't have another one of these. Two would be just about it though, as this would not be a beer to chug in large quantities. If you're decorating a gingerbread house or having a plate of cookies around the fire, grab this beer and enjoy. It's a good choice for this time of the year and not like anything else on the shelf, all while staying stylistically and seasonally true to form."

"Pours copper brownish orange with a singe finger white head. Smell is tons of nutmeg, heaps of ginger, plenty of honey, malty, bready. Tastes as promised , very fresh ginger, smooth honey, nutmeg, cinnamon, sweet brown sugar. Carbonation is nice. Overall I like this beer, I don't think it's the greatest Christmas ale out there. If you're not aware, people go a lite overboard for this, but hey I'm all about supporting a great Ohio brewery. A little sweet for me, but a very enjoyable seasonal ."

"The aftertaste has a light wheat, and the overall taste is a great representation of what a Christmas Ale should taste like. Delicious"
"O: Good stuff. An easy-to-drink winter warmer. Reminds me subtly of gingerbread cookies."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, clean crisp nice balance from the hops, slight bite from the alcohol. Clean and a gentle bitterness at the final feel; slightly spicy and even a little creamy. Pretty drinkable, one bottle is enough for me and I'd only drink it around the holidays, hits the spot when looking for a nice Christmas Ale."
"O: Overall the flavor of this beer reminds me of a combination of gingerbread and sugar cookies - one of the better Christmas beers that I have tried. Easy to drink and enjoyable with very well hidden alcohol."

"My favorite beer! The appearance is cinnamon, as is the aroma, as is the taste. It is not as sweet as many of the other spiced/winter warmers. There is a smokiness to this, not overly so. Frankly, I could drink this all day. Wonderful taste, lighter than anticipated, but packs a wallop."

"notes: Like every beer drink from Great Lakes, I detect cocoa at the end. The difference is, it works for this beer just like it works for Eddy Fitz. This beer is better than Sam Adams Winter Lager, however I don't like it well enough to buy again. Still I wouldn't turn it down if it were offered."

"Overall: This is a fantastic beer to enjoy during winter months and tastes like Christmas. The price keeps going up each year (this year it's $11.99/six pack where I live) but it's worth splurging. It's a simple beer but one that is well constructed."

"The pour has nearly no head and the beer is mildly carbonated. The color is a thick amber while the smell has faint traces of honey and stronger hints cinnamon and other spices. You'll be able to taste the spices, and the drinkability is excellent for a 7.5 ABV beer. This ale sets the bar by which all other winter beers should be measured."

"Pours dark ruby amber, with a two finger khaki head. Classic Great Lakes looks, always have great looking beers. The aroma is filled with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a good dose of vanillia. The taste has less sweetness up front, instead there's a nice bitterness in its stead. Mid palate the sweetness kicks is with vanilla. The cinnamon and nutmeg last for quite awhile in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is surpisingly light making it very easy to drink. ABV is a bit high and sneaks up on you. This is a holiday classic in ohio and I don't see that changing anytime soon."

"Pours a pretty ruby color with a small light cream colored head. Arima is subdued cinnamon spice with malt characteristics in the background. Flavor is full of fruit, with a touch of cinnamon. The honey sweetness is definitely present. I like that the spice does not overpower this. Too many of these turn into spice bombs. A great beer to have in front of the fire if you aren't in a big beer mood. Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. One of the best spiced beers I have tried."

Yes, I am quite biased in favor of Great Lakes Brewing Company because one of my best friends worked there for nine years and I've spent many a fine afternoon/evening at the place. But my preference for GLBC beer is primarily because the beers are almost always outstanding. Cheers!"

"A winter classic from Northeast Ohio. You have to be VERY careful with GLBC's Christmas Ale because it will knock you on your butt in no time. It truly is the perfect sweet honey, alcohol infused taste of Christmastime. November 1 (the release date of Christmas Ale) is a holiday in itself for Northeast Ohioans."

"Great Lakes Christmas Ale is a crystal clear amber ale with a soft, waxy, yellowish head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. It has a light aroma with hints of spice and candy. It's medium bodied and a little sharp. The finish is a little metallic and gritty. It's quite sweet and well spiced. It almost tastes like a candy cane. There's a little caramel and some juniper bitterness that lingers after the swallow. This is very clearly a Christmas Ale. The balance is pretty good but it's too sweet to have more than one."

"I really enjoyed this beer. It poured a crystal clear amber color with thick head and nice lacing. Smell was super sweet with loads of caramel, some citrus, apple, ginger, coriander, some chocolate, and rich honey. Taste was nice as well. Super malty with nice bready notes, slight grapefruit, cinnamon and ginger. Mouthfeel was medium, slick, and drying. I had a great time drinking it."
""
""

"Overall this is a nice Christmas Ale that does not go overboard with the spices as some other Christmas Ales tend to do."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just not my style of beer. I can't find any off flavors, but the spices just came through too heavy-handed for my taste. That said, I feel like the brewers at least put an effort into making the sweetness & spices work into the body of the beer, rather than just giving your sinuses a Christmas kick. Better than many of the spiced Christmas beers."
"Overall: This beer gets a ton of hype, but it's well-deserved. Definitely one of the better Christmas ales out there. Well balanced and maintains a solid spice presence without turning into a spice bomb."
""
""
""
"Overall - a great offering from Great Lakes. One of my favorite winter time seasonals around."
""
"If you charge that insane amount for a beer, people are going to be disappointed when it doesn't taste really special. Some ginger, cinnamon, and grassiness. Pretty good, but again--when Dogfish Head charges me $10 for a 12 oz, I'm annoyed at the cash register but pleased when I see how worth it it is. This just annoyed me all around."
"Overall: Really enjoyed this. One of the best Christmas Ales I've had. Better than Goose Island's Christmas ale, in my opinion, and less expensive. Next to blackout stout, probably my favorite offering from Great Lakes."

"This was equivalent of sipping a warm, nicely spiced liquid holiday cookie. The malts and spice flavors (from whatever the source) just came across so nicely balanced and complex without smacking you in the face with overly strong flavors. This is by far one my best holiday ales I've had in a long, long time. Highly recommended..."

"O - A solid winter beer. One of my annual Christmas go-to beers. Not a lot of malt taste - almost a spiced beer."
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, lightly carbonated, copper coloring with a filmy, sparse, thin, white head coating the surface. Aromas of cinnamon spiced honey sweetness, both rich and smooth. Some roasty, bready notes in the background, also. Flavors are rich and sweet, on a very smooth, robust body. Almost creamy feel in mouth. The honey creates a semisweet, solid backbone with spiced and fruit highlights. The spice profiles of nutmeg, cinnamon, and all-spice are very subtle, and blended very well. This is what fruitcake is supposed to taste like, instead of candied evil and garbage. Lightly spiced aftertaste, with the honey giving off some tropical fruit esthers, also. Smooth, clean finish. Very tasty brew, and extremely easy to drink."

"Great Lakes is an excellent brewery that produces consistently excellent beers; the Christmas Ale is no exception and is one reason that this brewery is famed. If you want a solid interpretation of the Winter Warmer that isn't overly spiced, check out the Christmas Ale. Take it as a post-dinner treat or fireside companion for the holidays."
""
"O - A sweet, cookie-like interpretation of a holiday ale."
""

"Overall: All in all a good Christmas ale, although I'd prefer some more malt character. As it is, it seems more like an herbed/spiced beer."

"O - I'm not a huge fan of Christmas beers, but this one caught my attention. It smells and tastes like Christmas. I would say it tastes like a gingerbread ale with a cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of vanilla. It reminds me of a slightly weaker Christmas version of the Southern Tier Pumking...has a good aroma (albeit slightly more subtle) and has a unique taste (by the way, Pumking is my favorite pumpkin beer)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- Overall, the spices are mildly interesting up front and certainly seasonal, but the hot alcohol character detracts from what flavor may eek through. It's a beer to sample one and probably not revisit in an evening. There's also something distracting to me in a beer that tastes like a ginger-snap. Not my style."
"O- If you don't like spicy beers- this isn't for you. i personally find it very well blended. love the spice. very easy on the nose. one of my favorite christmas beers thus far."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't care much for this Christmas offering. Pretty boring and somewhat over-spiced."
""
"O-your non beer drinker friends might appreciate the novelty in this, maybe some girls would. its not terrible really. its okay to drink, it goes down easy, but its not a good beer. it focuses more on the holidays than beer, and we should never lose sight of whats most important. definitely doesn't drink like 7.5% though. it tastes more around 5%."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 2/22/2013. Pours lightly hazy copper amber color with a small 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, toast, brown sugar, cherry, raisin, bread, and herbal spiciness. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, bread, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, honey, brown sugar, raisin, and herbal spiciness. Slight spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, clove, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice malt/spice flavor balance with good complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice spice amber ale! Well balanced with good flavor complexity; very smooth and easy to drink. Very enjoyable offering as expected."
""
"Overall - A very good christmas beer - there aren't many made that are able to balance the spices with the beer base well, but Great Lakes does it again."
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, the beer was an exaggerated gold color with a modest white head. The ale left a thin lacing on the glass, giving reminders of your drinking progress. When sipping a winter warmer, this is a plus. The holiday aroma peaked my interest, with scents one might expect from a holiday beer including cinnamon, pine, ginger, and a hint of cookie. In the taste, one gets sweet and spicy cinnamon and honey a little later. The thickness of the ale allows this one to linger for a while. The staying power becomes nicer when one experiences the pleasant warming sensation toward the end. This is a nice warming seasonal with a pleasant aftertaste. I believe I could enjoy this one again in the future."
"Light copper orange in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Delicate aromas of cinnamon, ginger, honey and caramel malt. Medium bodied with an oily feel up front, a tangy feel at the finish, and subdued carbonation. Spicy flavors across the roof of the mouth with sweet dark fruit, honey and caramel malts over the tongue. Finishes cleanly with a subtle hop bitterness. Great balance of spicy, sweet and bitter in my opinion. This was an awesome easy drinking winter warmer!"
""

"Overall - A soild winter warmer, alot of sweetness and spices. Easy to drink and enjoy. Balanced well, each aspect works together to create a smooth, sweet and pleasent drink. One of the best of the style, worth a drink for sure."

"my twin brother's absolute favorite beer. youd never suspect its 7.5% abv either. the pour is a light and clear sopper color with a moderate red hue, and a lazy but lasting off white head, foamy, roughly half an inch high. the nose is cinnamon and ginger are evident, as is a richer malty sweet body. the flavor isnt sweet though, and that is this beer's best feature. its spiced, but its dry, its malty, but its crisp, its fruity, but its hoppy. there is a lot of strange contradictions happening here, but all work magically. spice up front, malty candied fruit through the middle, and spruced up groggy booze in the finish. this is yummy as anything thats out this time of year. there is an airy body, feeling much lighter than it must actually be, and a mellow but adequate co2 infusion. one of the best great lakes beers going, and certeinly one of the better winter brews available on the east coast. this is the dope show."

"O - A very nice Christmas beer, that's definitely on the dry side of the style. If it were balanced a bit sweeter with a little less astringency, it would be easier to drink, but it's one of my go-to Christmas beers when I can get it."
"The Great Lakes Christmas Ale poured a copper color with a sturdy head. Cinnamon and general spice fill the nose. A thick/ creamy brew that is full of holiday spice. I notice the honey and would say the ginger enhances any bitterness. Finishes with a refreshing feel."
""
""
"Creamy mouthfeel with honey that soothes. Lots of sweet malt, butter toffee, caramel, unfermented sugars add a sweetness, honey plays off the rest of the malt flavors beautifully creating a soothing SIP. Holiday spice lingers in the background creating a balance along with a mild English hop bitterness. A crescendo of holiday cheer."

""
""
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin for me. I had no idea this was 7.5% ABV because of how loose and wet the mouthfeel is (no alcohol burn either). Overall this is a darn solid winter warmer. It doesn't fatigue the palate, so I could absolutely have a couple of these in a sitting."

"Brilliant, glowing copper color with a small, white head that is frothy around the edges. Sweet and spicy aromas...lots of ginger and a fair amount of cinnamon over some sticky bread. With the flavor, I think the cinnamon gains the upper hand, but the ginger is certainly still there. Sweet, dark fruit, honey, cherries, and some caramel malt. Smooth mouthfeel, a little better than medium bodied. I think I'll save my last bottle for Thanksgiving. I haven't decided if I should pick up another 6-pack to put away for Xmas or not. It's tasty and all, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about."

"The Great Lakes Brewing company has yet to disappoint me. This brew is prefect to these cold fall and winter months and with a healthy ABV at 7.5%, it truly warms you up."

"O - Pretty underwhelming given the hype. I was expecting bigger flavors and smells. The way I would describe it is Lagunitas Brown Sugga's little brother. Sadly, I spent more on this then Brown Sugga'. I decided not to review this until after my fourth over the course of the week, and my impression of it hasn't changed a bit even trying it in four types of glassware."

"O - My friend just convinced me to buy this beer and I cant say I'm disappointing. Ive passed on great lakes a lot of times in favor of imported English ales but this is up to par or better than a lot I've tried and I'd reccommend it to anyone"
""
"This is my favorite beer. Every late October/early November is like Christmas for me. The minute you crack this beer, it smells like the holiday season. The cinnamon, ginger, and honey blend very well together. This beer goes down extremely smooth for the 7.5% alcohol content, so drink with care. This beer goes well with Turkey, Ham, or pretty much anything you would eat around the holidays. Christmas in a bottle. A little pricey at between $12 and $13 a 6 pack, but worth every penny. Christmas in NE Ohio isn't Christmas without Christmas Ale."

"In this review I am instructed to be constructive and I am. The appearance is red... I have never seen a beer that literally looks so red. The smell is like Christmas cookies! Perfect for the Holliday season! As far as the taste, it is the best beer I have ever had. It tastes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and Christmas cookies. The mouthfeel is extremely pleasant with the perfect balance of malts and pure utter greatness!!! I recommend this beer to anyone who likes great beer! Great Lakes brewery continues to prove that they are one of the best breweries in the world. I have never had a bad beer from this amazing world class brewery!"

"This holiday in a cup has the option of being served with brown sugar on the rim. The first sip is like christmas day. The consistency and flavor instantly brings warmth to the soul. I wish they would raise the ABV count back up to what it use to be to add some more warmth. All in all it is a tradition for me. Nothing like walking in from a snowy day and warming up to a glass of this brew. It is the only reason why I look forward to Cleveland winters."

"I got a six pack of this for Christmas as a teaser for the beer cabinet my wife had made for me. Other than the poor appearance (I'm only a week or so past the drink by date), this brew is a nice change up and begs to be enjoyed over the holidays with family. While not one of my favorite offerings from Great Lakes, this is still a quality brew. Too bad it doesn't come in variety packs to enjoy with the other great offerings when I'm back in Ohio for the holidays."

"This isn't a bad beer, but it's uninteresting. There's is nothing that sets it apart from any of the other winter warmers that are also brewed with cinnamon, ginger, and honey. It was nice to try once, but I wouldn't have it again."

With such a solid lineup of world class brews, who could resist? If you see this somewhere, definitely pick it up, you will have no regrets. Re-buy factor: very high."

"Overall the spices in this are blended quite well but do not make for a very drinkable beer. After a few sips of this one I'm looking for someone to share it with."
"Pours an amber color with a tiny head. Aroma is very sweet and spiced - honey and a ton of holiday spices dominate the nose here for sure. The taste is very sweet and very spiced. It's almost like an imperial winter warmer, if such a thing were to exist. It's very well-done though, with a cutting, slightly alcoholic finish that stops it from becoming cloying. The mouthfeel is rather thick, but has a pretty good level of carbonation. It's also fairly drinkable, especially considering the sweetness. Overall, a solid winter beer for sure. Every beer I have from GLBC makes me kinda sad I'm outside of their distribution, as they'd be a staple in my fridge for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the spicy, warming finish. It really does taste like winter and Christmas. They were able to maintain such stark spice, without forfeiting the other important qualities to the beer. The malts remained robust throughout, and the hops were appropriately light. This is the exemplary winter warmer."

"Pours a clear copper color with a finger of off-white head. Lots of cinnamon and ginger aromas, especially ginger. There is a nice bit of sweet malt and bread going on as well. The flavor has plenty of bready malt sweetness as well as some toffee. The ginger is fairly assertive, maybe a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg in there as well. Medium body with low to medium carbonation."

"O- I really like this beer - better on draft than in the bottle. I know some think it is over rated but it has a unigue sweet taste that I can't deny is great"
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very popular around here and flies out of the store when it's available. I'm glad I managed to score some."
""
"I don't find this to be anything special as far as other winter beers that are out there. Of any I've had, this one probably packs the biggest punch. Maybe I expected more based on the hype."
""
""
"Sublte and warming. Nice and easy drinking spicy seasonal."
""
"o - Overal I thought this was a great Winter Warmer. Lots of cinnamon and gingerbread in the nose and taste which I love, and exactly what I was expecting. Would certainly buy it again."
""
""
"D - At 7.5% the ABV is well hidden and it is a nice example of the style. A nice beer to ring in the New Year!"
""
"I'd heard so many great things about this brewery that I left Christmas Ale sitting on my counter for an hour and kept going back to it to make sure I wasn't missing something. It eventually ended up down the drain."
""
""
"Slick and little bit flat, the mouthfeel is a disappointment considering the other solid qualities of this beer. Still, a very nice winter warmer, and no doubt, I will drink this again."
"O-Great Christmas Beer. In my part of the country it sells out quick.Not a beer that I would want to drink everyday but I appreciate a few around the hoidays. The Ginger and Cinnamon balance makes this beer unique compared to other Christmas Ales I have had. The 7.5 abv is balanced nicely and does not come off boozy at all."
"O: I have to admit that I'm a bit of a sucker for spiced beers and I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Could have a few on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: To each his or her own on this one. If you dig this type of brew, then knock yourself out. As for me, I liked it, but didn't love it. Anchor still owns Christmas to my mind..."
""
"From the tap (previous): This pours a ruby auburn color. It has a lightly spiced aroma to it, ‘holiday’ spices, like the dusting of cloves and allspice. Tastes so flavorful with a wonderful, big spiciness of nutmeg and allspice, some clove and cinnamon, and a hoppy bite that’s masked by a malty spice backbone. I enjoyed letting this one warm as it held up well."
""
""
""
"O: Winter warmers are far from my favorite style, but Great Lakes makes a wonderful one. Highly recommend."
"Great spicy bouquet going on with ginger, cinnamon, sugary sweetness. Not necessarily a beer I'd get a second of but enjoyable none the less."
"O- Overall, this is a fuzzy warming beer, the smell maybe enough to make you not want to sip it due to its medicinal like qualities but the taste makes up for it. Not sure if i could enjoy more than one of these at a sitting, very syrupy and sweet. But well worth a try."
""
"Overall, it is a Christmas beer and brings what might be expected. Plenty of seasonal spice and sweet flavor. Perhaps my favorite Christmas beer!"
""
""
"Notes - The best Christmas Beer I've ever had but it really beats you over the head with all that spice and sweet flavor."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good christmas ale. It's pretty similar to Saint Arnold's christmas ale."
"Pours a medium amber color. Lots of bubbles. Smells awesome. Smells like blended honey, gingerbread, and cinnamon. Loads of cinnamon. Tastes much of the same. Possibly some lemon in there as well. Has a bit of a ginger snap cookie to it as well. Very good. Mouthfeel is a bit over carbonated, but full. Very crisp. This is by far the best Christmas Ale I've had this year. Thanks to JohnPPutz for the extra."
"O: this is the best Christmas ale I've ever had. Well done."
"O- My first winter warmer so yeah, Im pretty disappointed. I feel like this is a pretty decent beer and that this just isn't my style. I will probably try again next year and hope my taste buds have had a change of heart."
"Overall: This is a really nice Christmas beer. Always try to get a hold of one during the holidays."
"O-Extremely well crafted. I went into this with pretty high expectations since the recent Great Lakes beers I have had were fantastic and this one did not fall short. Great winter session beer."

"Pairings: Good with carbs - all winter warmers are good with something savory in my honest opinion. It's the charm of the winter warmer."

"Medium in body with pretty high carbonation. I finished this one pretty quickly because it was so smooth. I've had better Christmas Ales...but this one is still quite good."
""
"O: It's got a bit of a disappointing mouthfeel, but the rest of this beer is spot on. One of the prettiest holiday beers I have seen. Not the most complex, but sometimes that's not needed. An enjoyable winter warmer, with enough alcohol and spice to keep you toasty on a cold night. Good job."
""
""
"Overall – The beer has an interesting taste that is somewhat different that I'm used to with winter seasonal beers. It's not something that I'd want a whole lot of but i enjoyed the taste and I'd pick this one up again next holiday season."

""

"The ginger was a little off-putting for me - not that it was overwhelming, just that I didn't feel it was quite the right spice choice for a Christmas Ale. Even so, this is one of the better Christmas Warmers out there."
""
""
""
""
"O) I really enjoyed this one. It's a festive beer. It kind of made me want to decorate the Christmas tree. Unfortunately, that was done already. If I had like five more of these, I could probably fall into it."
""
""
"Overall, not sure how much this was opened up on the pour, but it seems like I am preferring Great Lakes out of the bottle than on tap based on my experience."
""
""
"Pours a cystal clear copper color with a tight one finger head which gives way to almost nothing. There are strings of lace left on the glass. The aroma has a biscuit malt backbone with hints of honey, ginger, and cinnomon. There is also a hint of spruce and piney hops. The taste follows suit, there is a biscuit malt backbone with a cinnomon and a big ginger taste to it. At the very back end the ginger gives way to a spruce hop bite. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and slightly dry. Overall it is a solid beer, near the top of the class, but not the top of the class."
"Light side of medium bodied, with average carbonation. The aftertaste has some spice, but not much else. Not my favorite Great Lakes beer. It is drinkable, but there are better Winter Warmers than this."
""
""
"Pours out an amber hue with a thin white head that leaves little retention and some lacing, nothing special here. The aroma has some spices to it along with caramel. The taste starts out with cinnamon followed by some ginger and than the honey and caramel come in the middle and finishes off with more honey and ginger. There seems to be a hint of hops in the back. The mouthfeel is rather sticky and chewy and leaves dryness in the mouth. Overall a nice beer to enjoy during the cold winter days. Drink this and you will have a Merry Xmas :)."
""
""
"Pours an amber/copper color with a full head that dissipates rather quickly. Crystal clear with very little visual carbonation. Lots of spice in the smell, cinnamon being the most prevelant with a complementary sweet spice (cloves?). Caramel and sweet malt also in the aroma, along with a slight roast. Altogether a very fragrant beer. Cinnamon hits the palate right off the bat, transitioning into a a sweet malt/caramel flavor, creating a very enjoyble contrast. Finishes with an unappealing bitter spice aftertaste (think the bitterness in cinnamon without the sweet). Spices are aggressive in this beer, but not in a bad way. A nice medium body, though I would have preferred a thicker beer (On the other hand, I have had thinner winter warmers...). Very nice balance to this beer, mixing the bitter spice and the sweet malt. The carbonation in the beer brings forward the spice bite, aiding in the contrast through most of the sip. I will be revisiting this beer throughout the winter, although I would like to see a tiny bit more hop presence in the beer. A great beer to keep you warm."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good take on a winter warmer. Spices and sweetness is heavy but the hops help balance things."
""
"A nice Winter warmer. I could drink this on Christmas."
"Drinks easy for the style, I am bit saturated with this style of beer right now, fairly typical of the style. Expected more from these guys..."
""
"O: A good winter warmer that combines unique aromas and flavors successfully. It suffers most from a watery body, but is still tasty and smells quite nice."
""
"D: Interesting enough to keep me coming back. Would be a welcome addition to my celebration."
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable, but I couldn't drink more than one in a night, it's way too sweet. I am definitely enjoying this though and will buy one a year for the holidays!"

""
"Thanks to my brother-in-law Dave for hooking me up with this one! Clear copper pour with one finger head that quickly fades with decent lacing. Unique, spicy nose with lots of cinnamon along with hints of caramel apples and clove. Smells a lot like cinnamon Apple Jacks. The taste follows suit with cinnamon and cloves dominating, along with hints of ginger, apple, and honey. This is what a Christmas beer should taste like in my opinion. Smooth mouthfeel makes this extremely drinkable, even for such a rich beer. One of the best examples of a Christmas beer I've had from an American brewery."

"Great winter warmer. Worth buying a whole case to share meal after meal."
"O: Great Lakes doesn't disappoint with their Christmas Ale. If you're looking for a well spiced winter warmer, this is for you. I don't foresee me knocking back many of these, but if I was gonna reach for something spiced, this would certainly suffice."

""
""
"O: Great winter warmer, could drink a million of these. At least a million. Alcohol is well hidden as well."
"O. If the carbonation level was amped up a bit more, I would find this much more to my liking. I can understand why people clammer for this beer - it is easy drinking and is likely something casual beer drinkers would enjoy. Personally, a couple of these each Christmas Season is plenty for me."

"O - I'm not really a fan of the style overall, but this gets it right."

"Transparent copper amber hue that has a about a finger of head that dissolves rather quickly. Smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves- similar to pumpkin ales that I have tried. Interesting taste. Very balanced malty spicy sweetness with a slight earthy bitterness that follows. Mouthfeel has a medium body and well-carbonated. Overall, too similar to other pumpkin ales to set itself apart for me."
""
""
""
"overall this is one of my favorite winter ales and i look forward to it every year. a bit pricey (13.99 for a six in chicago), but worth it and a great brew during the holidays. highly recommended!"
"O- A decent spiced forward beer, but nothing memorable. After having this the last couple years, I much prefer Anchor, which is much easier to get than this beer. Not really sure what all the hype is about with this one."
"O - Really a nice winter warmer. One of the better ones that I have had, but still relies on all the spices without much else to make it really pop."
""
"O- This beer is the holiday season in a glass, a cornucopia of holiday flavors and spices. A beer I look forward to every winter. Very good out of the bottle, even better on tap."
""
""
"Overall: good beer, more hoppy than malty but it does have a good balance of flavors. Great Christmas beer."

"overall it was pretty easy to drink but the cloves kind of made me need some water in between to clear it out, and start over, it seemed like it built on top when I didnt have water and it made it harder to drink."

"O: This is a very good beer. One of the best winter warmers I have ever had. Its an all around great beer and there isnt a part of it that lacks."

"update: had it on bottle. regardless, CO2 issues on tap-must be a problem w the tap, not the keg i figure."
""
"Pours out nearly dead flat. No head at all, period. Only a few sad spartan bubbles occasionally rise from the bottom of the tulip glass. I am disappointed. This lack of carbonation causes the heavy body of this beer to feel unpleasantly syrupy in my mouth. Now that I've gotten all the bad things about this brew out of the way, lets talk about the good things. Color is a brilliant ruby/amber with minimal haziness, smells of honeyed ginger and spice exactly as promised on the label, flavors of gingerbread and spiced Christmas cookies come through cleanly just as promised by the nose, fresh, sharp, and clean flavors overall that really make me feel like the holidays... If only there was carbonation, it could have been something stellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a pretty one-note brew. I think I came into it with too high of expectations generated by this site. I really think that Lakefront Holiday Spice is still the king of winter warmers for me, but this isn't a bad brew by any means. Really drinkable with a deceiving ABV...perfect for the cold months."
"This brew is an excellent holiday treat. Great complex flavors here and a nice hidden higher abv. Great stuff here - highly sessionable."
""
"O - best winter warmer I've ever had. Period. Continues to be my Christmas ale of choice. This beer just screams Christmas. This is the brew that's meant to be experienced on that cold christmas eve night. It has the look, smell, and taste of the holidays. This is the best of the best this time of year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. I was hoping for a little more from this beer, but as it stands this is about a middle of the road Winter Warmer. A bit too sweet for me, and the spices and additional flavors just don't seem to play well together."
""
"Coppery amber with a creamy sand colored head that leaves blobs of lace on the glass as it melts. The nose is spicy cinnamon, ginger snap cookies and honey with underlying toasted barley. This is good ale for sure, the honey is certainly more evident in the flavor than the aroma and the ginger is a tad heavy handed for my liking. All in all though the flavors work well together and the alcohol is well hidden. Medium light bodied with prickly carbonation. A fine take on the style, I could certainly see drinking this around the holidays."

"Pours transparent amber with off white head that settles into a nice mist. Aroma of spices, maple, and slight booze. Tastes of spice, cinnamon, maple, gingerbread, brown sugar and slight tang with alcohol. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. A refreshing winter warmer: tasty, filling, the flavors rush on the palate but then recede gently leaving you wanting another sip. My favorite winter warmer so far."
"O: I know my fellow Clevelanders go ape-s*** over this beer, but to be honest it's one of my least-favorites of Great Lake's lineup. Certainly solid, but I would take an Edmund Fitzgerald any day over this."
"O: Worth a try but falls short on what I normally expect from great lakes."
"O: A good winter warmer. Very warming without the extra spiciness or bite that others have had."
"I don't want any more of this."
"O- this is a good beer and I love it, but I think its hyped up more than it deserves, I'm drinking my first glass for this season and find myself slightly disappointed compared to what I remember from last year. But as they say the grass is always greener on the other side. I will buy this again but may not jones for it so much in the off season."
"O- Def not the best Christmas seasonal, but I respect the hell out of this brewery and this is a solid beer I will try every year."
"Picked up a few winter warmers in a mixed 6 pack. I don't usually drink many of this style but want to try some. First up is Great Lakes' offering. It smells like an old ale with dark fruit, but the taste sticks to bready and winter-y spices. Pretty decent, I liked it better than the Bell's Xmas that I followed this with."
"O: above average beer, no debating that. It’s overrated in my opinion."
"This beer is easy going and medium bodied. The carbonation is like a gentleman taking a woman home after the first date: It gives your tongue a nice kiss, but doesn't go overboard."
"overall: this beer & Troegs Mad Elf = Christmas"
"Poured from a growler into a pint glass at around 45 F. Pours a very clear amber, with light carbonation. About a once inch white head that quickly collapses to a thin film. The nose is mostly cinnamon, nutmeg and maybe a touch of vanilla. In the mouth the first impression is toffee, followed by the spices and a nice dryness. There's a slight hops bitterness that provides some structure and prevents the beer from being too sweet. More carbonation than might be expected from the limited bubbles reveals itself as well. The mouthfeel is medium to full, and a little slick. This is a very nice winter beer, showcasing the spices without being too heavy-handed. The keg version is superior to the bottled version."
"I've never liked a winter warmer before, but this was... awesome? Had on tap at the UChicago pub, red-amber body with a light tan tan head and a light ginger-cider smell. It tastes like a cider-glazed spice cake, but not sweet like that makes it sound--like a beer, finishes bitter and dry with some earthy hops, the sweet and the spice mingle perfectly rather than tasting additive. I loved it--will be seeking out in bottles this winter!"
"O-I am not usually a winter warmer fan. But I have tried a few recently to see if I can get into the style more. Also, living in ohio...I see/hear all the hype surrounding this beer and said...eh, lets see what it is all about. Rarely has a beer lived up to the hype more than this one...fantastic and now without a doubt the best winter warmer I have had."
"Overall - It's a solid winter warmer, one of the very best"
"My one complaint is this beer's early release. I am drinking this on Halloween. Except for the few I have stowed away, Christmas Ale will be tough to find around Christmas time. And this beer always tastes better with some snow on the ground."
"This beer is cherished by many in central/ northern Ohio and is a symbol to Christmas similarly to that of a present under a tree. There are a number of beers that I get excited about during different times of the year but no more so than THE X-Mas Ale. Furthermore, this beer is very dangerous if not drank in moderation, like tequila it has the ability to erase ones memory (I just don't understand why at 7.5abv)? Future reviews will be more scientific in nature but this beer is not judged with the same criteria by me."
"This beer is perfect. A perfect example of something that shouldnt be barrel-aged. The latent sweetness is nice which is accentuated by the dryness from the honey and spices."
"Overall-pretty tasty, decent mouthfeel, I could have a couple of these. I opt against rimming the glass with cinnamon and sugar."
"5.7/10"
"O- not a four, the taste was what killed it for me. Maybe one of the most amazing sensations of any beer i've ever had was the smell."
"It's very nearly full-bodied, and would certainly be warming in winter months, but ultimately I'm not impressed enough to seek this one out over other local winter warmers, or even over Sam Adams'. Good, but not better than good."
"Overall I really liked this beer and will look forward to the next Christmas ale."
"Tasty! Poured clear copper-orange with a nice off-white head. Obvious spice in the nose, and some honey sweetness. Crisp and slightly fruity to the taste, nutty with a strong honey sensation immediately following, and later flavors of nutmeg, ginger, and light cinnamon, when the honey mellows. A slight hop bite riding in with the alcohol. Nicely balanced, medium mouthfeel, and a pleasant drink overall."
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the nutmeg and honey. Definitely a heavily spiced Christmas beer. The flavor is more of the same. I get a ton of spices, as well as some toffee and green apples notes. There is a nice sweetness to the flavor. The beer is easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: While I enjoyed this beer, certainly not one of the best holiday beers I've had. The spices became a little too much after about half the beer and the honey failed to balance them out. One is probably enough for me"
"Overall: Full disclosure - when someone asks me to name my favorite beer, this is the one I name. It blends the spices and honey in with the rest of the ingredients so well, and there's absolutely nothing better on a cold winter evening. While this year's batch isn't as well balanced as some previous (I could barely taste any malt and I wonder if it's because they've changed their grain bill somewhat) it's still an amazing beer from a world-class brewery."
"O: Nothing to complex but very enjoyable. A great first beer for be to review from great lakes brewery"
"Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, and probably very good fresh. Not my favorite but solid."
"This is not a beer I could drink one after another - it's too spiced and a bit too sweet for that. Definitely a dessert beer in that respect. But it is very tasty, and one I plan to enjoy in future winters."
"O/D- A surprisingly easy to drink spiced ale. The first Grweat Laked beer that I have had, it set the stage for some better Great Lakes beers I have heard about. Next I will try to acquire their porter, Nosferatu, Eliot Ness and some others I have heard about."
"Lovely ruby/copper colored body, slightly opaque, capped with nearly two fingers of slightly colored head. Delectable to they eye! Rich, sweet roasty malt dominates the aroma complimented nicely by some warming winter spices like ginger and cinnamon. Taste is a marvelous clean, sweet, brown-sugar sweetness with a delicate earthy hop note, honey sweetness complimented with light touches of spice. Like grandmas gingerbread cookies, but finished with an incredibly clean taste. A pleasant brandy-like alcohol warmth fills the esophagus after a few swallows, but no burning or heaviness. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel and moderately weighty body. A Christmas gift to be enjoyed with gratitude and satisfaction."
"Poured a crystal clear amber color with an ever so slightly off white head. The brew looks great and leaves lace through out the glass. Smell is a bit off putting as a clovey aroma takes over the brew in a bad way. The taste reminded me for some reason of candy canes with an ever so suddle hint of bitterness in the background. The spice was around and mixing with this candy cane flavor and did not sit well with me. Mouth feel was good and carbonation was good for the target profile. I would have to say I will pass on this brew the next year."
"A lot of people find ths beer really good, however I think there was too much clove, some of the spice that they use (nutmeg,ginger, brown sugar, etc..) I thought tasted a little off. Basically I thought this beer tasted just like a ginger bread coockie... not a fan."
"D: very good, very christmasy. ive heard people really rave about this stuff and around the right time of the year i could see why."
"I enjoyed it so much I ran to liquor stores trying to get some. All I could find was a couple six packs, it's such a hot seller that one store owner told me the distributor was limiting people to two cases each."
"Thanks to Cuzco for the extra. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Enjoy by 1/17/11 indicated on the label. Pours a translucent copper with a loose, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a soapy slick and a thin band around the edges. No lacing whatsoever on this one. Nose expresses nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon. Taste consistent with nose - a very spicy Winter Warmer indeed. Honey makes it's presence known towards the finish; however, there's also and herbal, perhaps spruce-like quality in the middle. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a lively, almost effervescent carbonation. Interesting for the style, but a little too over the top. Personally, it was difficult to get through one."
"D - Good winter ale; I thought it could stand to have a bit more of a spicy bite to it, but the honey is what stood out the most to me; I could have a few more, maybe next year!"
"(100th)"
"D: Great beer to enjoy at any time of day, 7.5% abv be damned. I could have 2-3 in a row but the ABV and the simplicity of the flavours keeps it at that. Good but not great"
"Overall: This is a downright tasty beer! I had both a '10 and '11 on Christmas Day 2010. A lot of people say that the spice character fades and it should be drunk fresh. I disagree. The year old one was even better than its younger brother - more blended and subdued, but still rich and spiced. Great beer and a Christmas classic."
"D: Ahhh."
"Drinkability: easy to drink. Perfect in the cold/wintry weather. It's sweet gingery / spiciness mixes well with chilly temperatures. It's ABV strength will quickly get the best of you if you are not careful (which can be a good thing if you want it to be)"
"D - Highly drinkable; one of my favorite winter warmers."
"This beer is so hyped up that it drives me nuts! I had this beer on tap with some cinnamon shit on the rim and that was the only good thing about it! The taste was absolutley awful! It has a super bitterness to it and maybe im bias, but im just not an ale fan....ILL STICK TO LAGERS!"
"It Tastes like Christmas. How does christmas taste?... Christmas taste like ""A Christmas Story Bomb"""
"Bought a case of this beer after hearing how limited this beer was in distribution. Bit disapointed with this over-hyped Christmas beer. Poured from 12oz bottle into a dimpled mug. Poured a clear golden-amber color with an off-white head. Aroma of spices, mostly ginger, and honey. Flavor follows suit, with hints of spices, mainly ginger and clove, in the opening that give way to a smooth finish. Subdued carbonation. Crisp feel on the palate, and no sign of the 7.5% alcohol."
"D- This is an exceptional winter warmer, it's hard to find at times, but is worth the effort over the holiday season. I had several between the annual release date and now (~2 months), and it's held up well. Look forward to this every year."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a clear copper color with a slight 1/2 finger off white head. Very spicy and herbal aroma in the nose, sort of a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and gingerbread. Medium mouthfeel. Roasty caramel flavor in the beginning mixes with the traditional Chistmas spices. Mellow aftertaste with on ly a slight bitterness in the end. Lots of Chistmas beers are similiar and this one is no exception. Is it great? No, but it is decent enough and I generally look forward to having it every winter."
"Drinkability is wonderful. Craveable, actually. I am lamenting all year why I did not track down more of it while it was here. One of my favorites from GLBC, and certainly my favorite winter warmer out there."
"This is the beer that first turned me on to holiday spiced ales. It's elusive, you've got to pick it up when you see it because it likely won't be back. It smells of honey and spice and pours a deep orange, almost copper. It tastes of cinnamon, ginger, allspice, with a subtle honey finish. And at 7.5% ABV, it's holiday cheer in a bottle! Without a doubt, one of my favorite beers and I can't wait until next holiday season for it."
"D: Very drinkable, though I wouldn't hasten to call it quaffable. Good stuff. I hear they're not bottling it anymore (?), which is disappointing."
"Clean mouthfeel, although not as dry a finish as I would have liked for a beer like this. Fantastic seasonal beer, the amount of initial spice taste set this one apart."
"Good appearance. very nice pour with decent head. I am a bit torn between this beer and the Sam Adams winter. Also it's very hard to notice the high ABV in the beer, if you have a few of them it will creep up on you. To sum it up I think this could be the first and only thing I like coming out of Cleveland, OH."
"D: Very good! It's so well balanced that I could easily drink 4-5 of these, which could mean trouble."
"It took some reaching (literally), but I netted the last bottle from Fresh Market. Victory! It pours a clear copper topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises black cherry, nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, green apple, red grapes, and graham crackers. The taste holds notes of orange peel (and plenty of it), pumpkin shell, ginger, nutmeg, wheat, grass, rye bread, and a touch of cocoa powder. A strong bitterness pervades the finish, which follows a poor mixing of the various flavors. Something's amiss here. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly drying finish. Overall, I did not enjoy this very much at all, save for the smell. Things just didn't come together for me here."
"I dont normally like spiced beer but this is the bee's knees! Best winter warmer by far!"
"Considering the style and ABV I wouldn't recommend sessioning with this, however the taste may change your mind. A great balance of flavor paired with a slowly creeping alcohol warmth makes this an ideal brew to quaff when the temps fall."
"Drink it up to make the Holiday Season a true event. Enjoy!"
"A Cleveland favorite, this is easily one of the best Christmas brews around. Highly drinkable, the only concern is the alcohol content will catch up on you if you're not careful. When they say winter warmer, they're not kidding!"
"Truly a beer greater than the some of its parts. Dryness from honey makes this dangerously drinkable. All elements of the beer are very well balanced."
"A great Holiday beer. I can see why it doesn't last on the shelves."
"Overall another winner from one of my all time favorite brewery. Once again please start distributing to Massachusetts soon."
"Pours out a clear copper color, medium sized white head with some big bubbles in it. Pretty good lace. Scent is a nice sweet malt with some cinnamon and ginger spiciness. Same applies for the taste: light malt front with a nice mix of holiday spices. Thin bodied, kinda sharp on the tongue. A very nice holiday brew."
"My buddies each had 2 more through the night. 1 was enough for me as there we too many other great choices available."
"Drinkability: Each sip of this one followed naturally from the preceding one and this one was soon finished. It would be quite easy to have second one. I'll definitely be having this one again."
"Overall a nice Christmas ale with a gorgeous color."
"Great Lakes Brewing Co. presents its 2010 Christmas Ale in the usual 12 ounce brown bottle. The brew has a beautiful garnet color with a wisp of white bubbles that hovers above throughout the experience. The aroma consists of caramel, apricot, and spices. The honey imparts an interesting character to the nose. Fruit, honey, caramel malt, and spices contribute to a pleasant flavor profile. A medium to heavy palate feels appropriately matched to the flavors. It is a reasonably drinkable beer, considering the style. I purchased a single bottle, but would have gladly drank more of this complex festive ale."
"Serving type: on tap in a snifter glass"
"Drinkability: Medium-high alcohol level and spicy nature make this brew something to enjoy sparingly."
"I know I've repeated already, but the balancing of the spices make this a very drinkable beer. No problem with having another."
"4.5 D: Solid brew. Good all-around with an excellent nose. If they thickened this up a bit, it would be out of this world."
"Drinkability - This brew is a pretty good ""warmer."" Definitely captures the Christmas feel. May be a bit too sweet for me to enjoy all night, but would be acceptable in small doses."
"Mouthfeel is medium and somewhat creamy. Very smooth overall with a moderate amount of very fine carbonation. Highly drinkable for 7.5% and it's fairly unique and enjoyable."
"Sweet and roasty malt flavors make up the finish with a thin sheet of dry cinnamon that isn't too sweet and isn't too bitter. Medium body, not as syrupy as a typical winter warmer, good carbonation and supremely drinkable. This is definitely my favorite in the category and is a nice break from the typical sickly sweet or ""beat you in the face with a cinnamon stick"" warmer. Everything in balance and still festive enough to satisfy, it doesn't get much better than this."
"Nice spiced Winter Warmer, I like the addition of honey in this one."
"D - A wonderful Christmas ale from Great Lakes."
"I have found this on tap at the Winking Lizard near Columbus and Average Joe's in Dublin, OH."
"Being from Akron, OH I really enjoy GLBCA but has become so hard to find in this area that I have had to turn to other offerings at times. I would highly recommend as far as the actual beer goes."
"D: A nice choice if you're in the mood for a spiced Christmas brew."
"If you're fortunate enough to be in an area where you can actually find this around Christmas, stock up and enjoy it all season long."
"I guess I need to recalibrate what I think a winter warmer is...Beer is light and has some grainy acidity at the end of the palate. The forward is mildly sweet with some cinnamon and nutmeg spice in the middle. As far as I can tell, nothing special. Drinkability is fine but I'm failing to see what the huge draw for this beer is. No interesting yeast character, no odd hop profile, just an herbed ale. Am I missing something?"
"D/M: Crisp and clean. Refreshing while still carrying some weight to it. Good Balance of flavor."
"I guess the faults of this beer really do come down to personal preference. I need to be able to drink at least four beers without feeling like I've already eaten an entire meal."
"A pretty good Winter Warmer... I could have several of these for sure... I'm glad I got to try this brew..."
"Tastes of pine bitterness up front backed by warming spices of ginger and cinnamon, then fills out to a chewy grain mouthfeel, finishing with a slight caramel note. A very nice, festive beer."
"I would definitely order this beer in a bar, it would accompany any meal quite well. It's sweetness makes it less of a sipper and more of a cold temperature swigging. I would not recommend the warmer temperatures. The christmas spice makes it different from other other ales, it fits nicely into the ""winter warmer"" class."
"D: Not so much my thing. Never really had a true winter warmer before and I think I'm not gonna be that big of a fan. One is enough, its just the whole spice thing in beer I'm not too down with. A little is fine, but when I can really taste it, not so much. I do like Winter Warmers more than Pumpkin beers so far though."
"I'm always fond of Christmas brews, and this is one of the best I've had so far this year. Great balance of spiciness and Christmas flavors. I could see several of these going down very easily."
"O: This is a good winter beer one that I will enjoy often during the upcoming holidays."
"Overall this is the best ""Winter Warmer"" of many I've tried. A true Cleveland classic."
"overall, i very much so enjoyed this beer, the honey seems to add something to the usual holiday spiced winter warmer. some may find this to be way over spiced, but i welcome all the spices. i would for sure drink this again."
"D- One of the better spiced winter beers I have had, but as always the high spice content takes slightly away from these beers. Nevertheless, great on a snowy night like now."
"I had been told I had to try this by a buddy from Cleveland so I picked up the only single I saw while visiting Chicago for the day. It pours a light auburn in color and is very translucent. It has the lightest of white heads and is light bodied. The smell is blase. It nothing more than what I'd call carmel malts and light spices. The flavor is an improvement. It has good sweetness and is kind of spicy. I think it may have nutmeg and cinnamon. Each sip tastes better than the last, and sweeter. I like it. It's light and drinks crisp. I could easily go through a six pack of this and you'd never know that it's 7.5%."
"Overall: Quite an awesome beer. Very balanced overall. Let this give you a holly jolly Christmas."
"Notes: Hmm, maybe not worthy of the ""under the shelve"" limited quantities sense that I´ve seen in some places. But short of the hype this is a truly worthy Christmas ale with a great balance and sense of stimulation."
"Drinkable: Enjoyed this beer and would drink it again. The middle/hardy body appeals to me."
" The taste of ginger is prominent with fresh honey-malt backing and light cinnamon mid palate with slight warming spiciness with subtle caramel in the malt with a good amount of hop & ginger continuing into the flavor after the initial sips with a mild alcohol flavor as it warms w/ nice earthy quality w/ no cinnamon candy flavor just nice fresh spice and honey into a mostly dry finish. This is a very tasty festive ale with spice that is sufficient to match the honey which is a nice compliment & is very drinkable for the strength. I would recommend this to anyone who likes ginger or honey in beer"
"A Great All Around Seasonal With All Kinds Of Blends And Spices. The Appearance shows a white head. with beautiful copper colored color. very nice thick foam when poured in a 16 ounce thick beer glass. it aroma amazes me ginger cinnamon it's sweet taste is fulfilling. it goes down smooth very lip smackable. the thing about such a high end beer like this that a casual drinker should be careful of is it's 7.5 alc vol content. this is a beer you wanna take sips of and to enjoy it."
"This beer is delicious. Definitely an interesting example from a category that's quite open to interpretation. As holiday spiced beers go, this is one of my favorites. Due to the high spice content, I dont think I could drink a ton of these, but it's very very good."
"Funny how sometimes you suddenly realize that you've had a paticular beer several times, but never got around to rating it. This is a solid, go-to entry in the winter warmer category. Nice solid malt profile with clear spice notes, but nothing overpowering. The alchohol is completely integrated in the flavor profile. Plus, you can't beat the old-school Lionel gondola train car filled with Christmas ornaments on the label."
"That said, I dug this beer. Quite a bold taste. Strong alcohol finish. Kind of a jewel glow to its tawny-ish color. Poured with a head that vanished completely. Looks weighty. Husky cinnamon-sugar aroma and flavor, up front. Nil on the hops. Brawny yet lightly fruity malt presence in the smell as well. Ginger takes over from there. Wow, it's 3-D! Not for the faint of palate. For me, a lover of bold, extreme tongue sensation, it electrified but somehow drank very lovely. Not what I think of or consider as far as winter warmers go (I prefer the dark malt / dried fruit characters of the Belgian noels) - but it fits the bill. This ale wouldn't find a place in any other season. I feel Great Lakes makes a noteworthy, well, unique and tasty beer here."
"Very Clear, rich dark copperish red color. Looks like big red in a glass. Thick 1/2"" head at pour, with a 1/4"" head remaining throughout out most of the glass. Very Spicey aroma, cinnamon, glove, ginger. As beer warms, aroma becomes more like a ginger bread. Same spices found in flavor, relatively consistent from beginning to end, a little sweet. Slight dry finish. Very drinkable christmas ale. Easy, slightly crisp. Probably my top seasonal from Great Lakes."
"Pours a brownish orange, pretty clean. i like darker winter warmers. the smell is like cinnamon and spice, real nice very pleasant. when i drink this i taste cinnamon and chocolate. really good, i'd be interested in tasting this beer with some age on it, tastes like it would do it some good. the mouth has a medium-heavy body, appropriate for the style i think. decent drinkability although im kinda full from dinner ;-) drinking this and its snowing outside, very nice."
"D - A unique holiday offering that is loaded with subtle complexity... A sipper due to the spiciness, not the alcohol... This one really captures the spirit of the holiday it represents... I will enjoy the rest of these throughout the season..."
"Fairly strong flavors of nutmeg and cinnamon in this brew. Small, quickly disapating, lacy head over a crimson body make this a bold beer in the glass. The body displays a malty base for the spiced flavor, which finishes with a slightly bitter, but well balanced hop edge. Cannot drink many of these before the spices just take over. A solid Christmas Alle - slightly above average for the style, but not one I wold squirrel away to drink throughout the year. Perfect for your tree trimming party. Watch out - I was alos surprised to learn the alcohol content on this one."
"clear amber color with only a slight off-white collar of foam. Lots of cinnamon and sweet malt aroma up front, slight earthy note fron hops I suspect. Spicy gingersnap kick with sweet caramel malt right behind pulled together by a nice hop bill. finishes clean with lingering honey tones lingering. nice and fresh, alcohol is not overwhelming. Nice beer. Don't know if i woant more than one or two before I moved on to something else."
"D: It tastes and feels like Christmas, if that's what you're going for. I'm surprised at the alcohol content on this one. It's certainly a great example of the winter warmer style."
"Overall: after a few sips this isn't very enjoyable. gets a bit redundant. I wouldn't want to drink any more."
"D: Very drinkable beer -- well-balanced and quaffable, and not over-spiced compared to other years. Easy to drink a few of these, although not a session beer."
"This is a great drink, wonderfully flavored, and a great pick for a nice cold winter night. The nice 7.5% ABV isn't overbearing, but gives you the nice warm, fuzziness you look for in such a brew, with out taking you out. This is a great winter warmer, and a wonderful representation of the style. No suprise its a Great Lakes Brew."
"D: Very drinkable, fantastic for a cold winter night as the flavor makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside (although that could be the ABV as well). For someone looking for a more balanced winter warmer, I'd say give this one a try."
"D - For me, a holiday seasonal beer to bring to a holiday event and have one or two to celebrate being in the spirit. As far as this style goes, however, I like it much more than many of the offerings that are heavily spiced and hopped out to the max. And the decently high ABV puts a warm spot in the tummy without feeling like I'm doing shots."
"Pours a nice amber color, nice cap of white head. Scent is of honey, ginger, floral lavendar, and cinnamon. taste brings pale malts to the front with honey sweetness and taste, the backround is very floral with ginger, lavendar and cinammon the dominant scents. Medium bodied, good carbonation, slightly sweet. Quite the interesting flavor profile, very enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is thick, full and malty with a pleasing toasty aftertaste. As for drinkability, I can myself sipping a few of these on a long winter's night."
"Mouthfeel is quite dry, and with a bit of a cloying paste, it brings the drinkability down to a slow level."
"D: Very drinkable beer. Obviously not a session beer, but a great taste."
"Drinkability: Due to the heavy weight of the beer and very strong spice flavoring I wouldnt be able to put up with more than one of these. A tall pint was a little overpowering."
"Clear, dark amber color with one finger of head that slowly settled to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Aroma has hints of cocoa, toffee, hazlenuts. The spice is subtle in the aroma but a touch of ginger can be detected. The spice is much more upfront in the taste. Cinnamon and ginger are quite strong upfront. Sweet malt and honey base but the spice is the featured attraction with this beer. Christmas in a bottle. Medium body and nicely carbonated. Good texture. A lot of spice in the beer but it stops just short of being too much."
"D - Yes and I will enjoy the last five. Very pleasant offering from Great Lakes!"
"D: Pretty good. The residual sweetness is pretty intense after a couple, though."
"Drinkability: Nice spiced Christmas Ale that seems to be much lower in alcohol than it actually is. Delicious and festive."
"D: This is another of those classic Christmas must tries. A really great brew but in the swarm of seasonal offerings this one can get left in the dust. Still holding a good bit of ABV and not showing it, overall this one is a bit of a let down."
"D - it goes down smooth and easy."
"Drinkability -- Ho Ho Ho... Quite Christmas-y, also quite cloying. Nice spicing, really like the ginger, but man, why so sweet? Maybe I'll leave the other five for Santa..."
"D: Don't want anymore. Hopefully my holiday guests will finish the sixer."
"D: Impressive easy to drink holiday brew. Excellent."
"D - A good drinkable Christmas Ale. Alcohol creeps on you and will catch you off guard. (Has happened to me a few times) Three is typically my limit and boy are you feeling good."
"Drinkability: The best Christmas ale and very easy to drink all night just don't plan on driving home."
"It pours brown, almost red. It has really nice head. I taste honey, ginger and cinnamon. It's transparency almost reminds me of a lager. I will say, although it does not taste boozy for being a higher ABV, this is a one bottler. I cannot see my self wanting more than 12oz of this taste. I would prefer this beer to be more hoppy."
"Huge spice and long aftertaste. If you like spice, you'll like this"
"drinkability: uniquely sweet, well complimented by the hops, could be a bit too dynamic for the stomach, but drinkable all the same."
"Taste: Light body, smooth mouth feel. Very sweet malty honey flavors. Strong Nutmeg flavor. I found this beer to be too sweet on its own, and combined with the spiciness it was a bit off putting. It would make a decent desert beer and would probably compliment some pumpkin pie quite well."
"Drinkability: One of the best domestic Christmas ales out there, quite honestly. Balances being somewhat of a sessional with a ton of Christmas cheer, ineffably, kind of, in a bottle. Another winner from, in my opinion, one of the best."
"I could only drink a couple of these. The ""holiday"" spice is a bit overwhelming."
"pours a mostly clear amber/brown color with a fast receding head that leaves a fresh collar with some lacing..smell is ginger and malt with some hops and malt..taste is better its spicy with ginger,nutmeg.cinnamon, after that it has some hops mixed with pine and finished with some baked malts..the mouthfeel is a festive well carbonated dinner table of holiday smells and tastes i really liked the ginger in this one..ill be buying this again b4 its gone"
"D - Considering the higher ABV for a winter warmer and the great taste, you can't do much better."
"Not a big fan of spiced up brews and all,but this Christmas Ale coming from GLBC(The Masters of Balance)is a very good offering! Every year I end up drinking a ton of this stuff(commonly called ""Christmas Crack"" around here)due mostly to the fact that it is just downright GOOD!If ya get a chance try it,price seems to keep going up though,so I've been gettin 'er on tap(which is even better!)for around 5 bucks a pint,Happy Holidays!"
"This is a top notch winter warmer with a spice-heavy nose that moderates in the taste with more sweetness. Well balanced and drinkable."
"Pours a moderate copper-amber color with an off-white head and a touch of lacing. The nose is quite spicy with some cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and clove. A bit of lightly-sweet and toasted malt backing it all up. The taste brings all the spicing together quite well and the more spicy notes of the ginger and cinnamon begin to stand out. Feel is a bit over the top in some ways and I wish there was a bit more sweetness. Drinkability suffers from the same problems, but overall this is a pretty good winter brew."
"I think this makes a really nice winter warmer and an even better beer to bring to a holiday party. Two of these would be more than enough for me as the alcohol is a bit warm and the flavor keeps drinkability down a hair. Really enjoying this one and may be my favorite one of the style."
"I really hate to dog this brew, as generally it's one of my absolute favorites, but I gotta say something isn't quite right this year. The sweetness overpowers the spicy character which I've grown to love from this beer, and it becomes really one dimensional as I continue to finish my glass. A friend of mine opened one of these about a week ago with me, and before reading any reviews or thoughts on BA, I told him the same thing - ""it's missing the ginger!"" Sure enough, I looked on here and saw others who felt the same way. Hopefully if Great Lakes releases a 2nd batch (which they normally do) it'll be from a different run of the beer, though I'm not sure if this is how they do it. If not, I'll probably stick with Anchor OSA as my go-to Christmas brew."
"D- the spices attack the palate and burn a little. The problem is the brew is so tasty I want to keep slamming them. The alcohol is the interloper. This will forever be the centerpiece at Christmas for my family and I"
"Special note: serve fairly warm - 50 to 55 degrees to even room temp. It's well worth the wait."
"Note: Definitely let this one warm up to get the full experience."
"GL is one of the best brewers in a top to bottom lineup comparison and This one is their Crown Jewel."
"Taste is predominantly ginger and honey, cinnamon is difficult to pick since the ginger/honey are overwhelming. Not sure if this is a beer that is appealing to my palate. However, Great Lakes again does a very good job of masking the ABV. The drinkability is not exceptional, although it looks mighty tempting when poured in a tulip/stemmed glass. Worth giving it a try."
"The experience of drinking this was akin to ordering a hamburger and biting into a veggie burger. It might be fine in its own right but it wasn't what I was expecting at all and it was nothing like I'd expect from the description of the style."
"A great beer to share with family, and friends during the holidays. Pairs great with Venison"
"D - Oh yeah, very drinkable and definitely would enjoy this with the family around the Christmas tree. If my wife didn't leave with the kids 6 Christmases ago. Drinking problem my ass, screw her I never said she had a make-up problem just cuz she needed it every day before leaving the house and going to work. And there's another thing that's overrated, WORK!"
"It was served in a plastic cup with over flowing head. Deep copper color. Strong scents of clove and other cookies spices. Very full of flavor. It aged well. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth. Very easy to drink a couple of these."
"D - Awesome Christmas beer, and one of the better ones out there IMO. Everyone has an idea of what a holiday beer should be, but to me any Christmas beer should include the holiday spices and a heavy body which this beer possesses both of. Maybe a little more hop presence wouldnt hurt, but a big malty beer still works."
"Overall a very bleh beer. Probably the least tasty from Great Lakes so far. I'm not big on spiced beers, and this just goes over the top with spices. Pretty hard to get down the gullet with all the spices. Thanks Drew, but this is the first GL beer that is not my cup of tea or cup of spice I should say."
"Pours a dark, clear copper color with a thin beige head supported by small bubbles of carbonation. Not much retention with a moderate amount of streaks of lacing. Aroma is mild and as expected, has a spicy, sweet ""holiday"" medley of flavors. Initially honey sweet and nutmegy with some other various spices. Flavor is less spicy or sweet than expected, with a strong malt body and a finish balanced with honey sweetness and grainy, cinnamon dryness. Full bodied (almost syrup like at time) with mild, fine carbonation. A very pleasant winter warmer, but a little too mild and boring to be as interesting as some of the Anchor holiday beers."
"Drinkablity is great on a cold Ohio December night. It seems out of place in April. I am going to look forward to this come November"
"Taste is Very crisp and smooth, with not much booze at all. It's crisp and very spicy. It's really spicy but not over the top on the g ver and honey so ts real earthy anddrinkable."
"Drinkability - Honestly, when I am home for the holidays in the Midwest I will seek this out. This is a lighter (i.e. read not as malty/heavy) as some other winter warmers but packs a great deal of ""Christmas"" in the beer with its many well balanced spices. I will seek out again for sure."
"GLBC never stops amazing me year after year with this seasonal brew. I figure that when I go to heaven this is what will be there waiting for me on tap. Christmas Ale is so delicious during the Christmas season I purchase a keg to have in the house (it doesn't last to long). This is my favorite winter seasonal of them all, the taste and smell of the brew is more of a Christmas smell to me than evergreen and sugar cookies could ever be. Side note: dunk your snicker doodle cookies in the beer and it makes the cookie that much better."
"Libation: Winter Warmers are a very tough style to balance, but Great Lakes has done a very good job here. No one spice asserts itself to much, and the 7.5% ABV does a great job in the warming department without announcing itself too prominently. The mouthfeel is almost perfect, very drinkable."
"Pours a clear amber color with a light tan head that falls to a ring and stays - nice lacing. Smells of sweet malt, honey and spice. Definitely nutmeg, maybe some cinnamon and ginger. Taste is the above flavors blended. It all ends with a dry crispness. The mouthfeel is nice, smooth carbonation, medium body. Overall I like the mouthfeel and it looks decent but I don't really love it."
"M/D- Good carbonation. Easy to drink. A good winter warmer. Another solid brew from another great midwestern brewery."
"The mouthfeel and body really make this winter warmer. the 7.5% alcohol is very well hidden. This drinks like a meal and I could get used to it."
"This is good, a nicely spiced ale with the ABV somewhere in the middle. While I can only take a single serving of winter warmers in my experience, I could see myself drinking a few of these because of the light aftertaste. Well balanced and mad drinkable."
"I was wrong to doubt these guys, and Great Lakes continue their streak of hits. I've yet to be disappointed by them, and on the basis of the quality and breadth of their offerings I'd have to say they may well be my favourite brewery."
"Really good beer. I like this one a lot and wish I had bought more."
"a clear amber color pour with a small soapy offwhite head , little to no lacing left , medium carbonation . Aroma is a jumble of spices , cloves , ginger, cinnamon and maybe an artifical honey note .Flavor just seems off , sort of a spicy mess with lots of cloves, a little caramel, candy cane and rasins with a spruce type hop finish , medium body , slick mouthfeel , short finish almost metallic, with fruitcake flavored burps , I would say this is quite sessionable if one was to care for it more than I did . I love you guys at GLB but this one was just not for me"
"Overall, one of the lighter, more flavorful Christmas brews that I've had."
"D - A very drinkable beer. The cinnamon flavour is excellent."
"Out of a bottle this beer was an orange-sienna color with a thin, one-finger of khaki colored head. The retention was only so-so and the lacing scant. The aroma was spicy with cloves, yeast, the funk of some musty malt and caramel malt. The flavors were semi-sweet and lighter than many Christmas ales. The spices clearly came through with lots of cloves, cinnamon and hints of hops at the end that added a bitter finish that lingered. Well blended but not wholly pleasant and not the best example of the style or the Great Lakes work. The mouthfeel was average, the body light/medium and the carbonation medium."
"D: Flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a decent Christmas beer but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
"Its amazing how Great Lakes managed to make such a full-flavored and robust beer so drinkable. This is always a regular in the fridge during the holiday months. Stock up early next year, as this beers goes quick. One of Great Lakes best."
"Full-bodied and decently carbonated. Drinkability is okay, but i wouldn't want another."
"Glad I got to try this one. I'm not sure much of it made it to PA, hopefully we get plenty for next year that I can drink it up over the holidays."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer looks great. A very clear copper color with a finger of off white head. I can smell the spice from a foot away. Cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice. All these and more are confirmed when I take a drink. Wow, there is a lot of spice here, and a sweetness that must be the honey that was mentioned on the label. Mouthfeel is ok due to the carbonation, but I just can't get past the overwhelming spicyness of this brew. For me drinkability of his beer is non existent. There is just too much of a spice presence. Perhaps I have been drinking IPA for too long to truly appreciate this style. I will not be having another one of these."
"D - Very nice winter warmer/Christmas beer. Spices are present but not overbearing, as in other examples of this style. Pretty enjoyable. Glad to have a chance to try this one. Wouldn't mind spending the holidays with a six pack of this one."
"It's a mild, pumpkin taste, but not like a Pumpkin ale or Oktoberfest, either. A nutty aftertaste. Slight bite. Good, but for an XMas/Winter Warmer, I want more flavor."
"Poured on tap at Flanigans Ale House. Aroma of cinnamon, clove and caramel. Nice off-white head with small bubbles that lingered. A good drinkable brew with definate cinnamon and ginger spice flavor, a rich copper color, and a medium body that will fit with any holiday meal. One of the better ""holiday-spice"" beer offerings this season."
"A good Holiday beer, but definitely not the best holiday drink I had this year."
"D - Easy to drink with any meal. Love the beer - would definitely recommend. A winter favorite."
"D- christmas in a glass. this beer is a little heavy on the spices for me, but its exactly what one would expect a christmas beer to be like. im not sure i understand the cult like following this beer has. one is plenty in a sitting and possibly a year."
"Light body that makes it easy to drink, but it's a bit too much ginger flavor for me."
"Drinkability suffers a little, too sweet and just too much like food in a blender to keep chugging these along. Heavy."
"D - I wish all winter warmers were this good. Although the spices are the main feature here, they're still restrained enough to maintain a high quaffability. Alcohol is well hidden. All the same, I'm not sure I could drink more than one or two in a sitting."
"(D)- Definitely of the the better christmas oriented beers I have had.. This one actually tastes like the season & is good too! Remember this one when celebrating the holidays!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This brew feels good in the mouth. I don't think I could drink more than two of these in one night."
"D: Not sure what it is, but not finding it terribly drinkable."
"D- I am always happy to try something new, something seasonal- I was able to kill 2 birds with one stone here. I haven't had alot of this style, but not a big fan of this one. No doubt that this one has a higher ABV as the etoh heat is very present. I don't see myself seeking this one out again. I would definitely seek out a GL beer again though."
"Two finger off-white head of foam with enough larger bubbles to keep it popping and steadily dissolving down without disappearing, thin streaks of lacing. Copper red color with a little bit of brown to deepen the metallic orange further towards the rims, clean and mostly transparent. Ginger, allspice and cumin in the nose give it verve, thin honeyed glaze, white pepper and juniper keep it high and flighty, the cranberry, bing cherry, red raspberry fruit scents come at you at angles, hint of orange peel as well as backroads dirt and stones, some mocha but the maltiness just one part of many, enjoyable for its leanness. Medium-bodied, firm carbonation keeps a steady backbeat, nothing lazy about this beer. Dry and wiry, as if looking to be more of a thirst quencher than sweet holiday kiss. The honey blends well with the orange citrus while the clove, cinnamon, coriander, ginger spice enlivens throughout. Not many moments of fruit, fig, apple or pear. It is refreshing and, likely, more of a food beer than a sipper on its own."
"D - Put simply, this is tasty ale, be it ""Christmas ale"" or not."
"Overall this seems like the quintessential winter warmer. Maybe (likely) because I grew up in Cleveland but still a very special seasonal from Great Lakes."
"Very drinkable...a great baseline to judge other holiday ales against!"
"D-I had to dock it a bit here as it is not terribly easy to drink more than a couple of these. It is, however, the perfect way to end a winter evening at the GLBC brewpub."
"D- This was a smooth tasting beer that is worth the money. I now understand why people buy this by the case. Very good drinking beer that everyone can drink."
"All in all, this is a great brew if you like the heavy hopy taste upfront. It's refreshing but still very strong tasting. Not a bad Christmas brew at all. The spruce-like flavors really make this a ""Christmas"" beer."
"Merry Christmas!"
"Pours a dark amber with about and inch of head. Scents of sweet malt, and spices. The flavor consists of a strong malty body, some honey and lots of nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. The clove is very strong on the finish. Slick body with light amount of carbonation. Drinkable beer with not too high of an ABV however one is enough for me. The mixture of spices is good but does not agree with my palate."
"Poured amber into a pint glass. No head or lacing whatsoever. Smells of cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Quite a spicy, flavorful beer. A nice balance of holiday/baking spices when cold, but ginger takes over when warm. The ginger flavor stays on the palate for several minutes. The body and mouthfeel are where this beer shines. Very smooth, almost creamy as it goes down. The strong, almost overpowering amount of ginger keep the drinkability score low. This is a solid, good tasting beer, but I'd only ever want to drink one at a time."
"Overall this was a treat to try, but it just didn't seem to have that extra ""oomph"" that I wanted. It seemed just average to me with nothing special making it stand out. Still, very glad I tried it."
"D - Nice and very smooth"
"Not a bad beer, pretty refreshing for the ABV. Needs a bit more carb, perhaps a touch more spicing to feel a little Christmasy-er. Otherwise, would drink again."
"I haven't been too big of a fan of this style in the past but this one's pretty good."
"Drinks fine, but I'm finding it's more to get to something I enjoy more, rather than a desire to really get into this beer."
"Classic X-mas beer. Great drinkability."
"Pours a dark amber body with a thin white head that quickly fades. Aroma of fruity esters, ginger, brown sugar and toffee. Medium bodied with medium carbonation level, this beer boasts flavors of cinnamon, brown sugar and ginger with a bit of a spicy finish that's not too sweet, but just right. The ginger flavor dials up as the beer warms and seems to take over more than it should. Overall a good Christmas beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, bit of a sweet cinnamon aftertaste, I could certainly enjoy a few of this with desert."
"A nice entry to the world of spiced winter brews. Ginger seems to be a common theme these days, but they pull it off fairly well here. Nothing too out of the ordinary, but it is balanced enough to be one of the more drinkable winter warmers."
"This is a pretty smooth brew and they go down really easy. The carbonation is matched well to the rest of the brew and it all just works. The heavier gravity also seemed well matched and was essentially undetectable with the rest of the flavors. very well done and an awesome brew to drink with friends during the holidays. Highly recommended!"
"Overall, one of the best spiced ales I've ever had. My buddy from Cleveland raved about it and once he brought it over, I think it lived up to the hype."
"Overall impression: The spices are a little strong for my taste, but certainly worth a try."
"D-pretty tassty and crisp towards the finish, i could enjoy this several times over"
"D - A good Christmas ale that works well as a sipper from the big snifter it's served in. The spiciness gets a tad cloying towards the end. Also, it seemed to be served just a bit cold as well."
"D: pretty drinkable but the richness of the beer might stop me from having too many."
"D- A really easy drinking Christmas beer."
"The beer is medium bodied, with mild carbonation, giving a nice creamy consistency, with the trademark holiday flavor lingering on the palate long after the beer is finished. I found this to be a decent representation of the style with flavors quite reminiscent of snickerdoodle. The alcohol is well masked and the aroma brings to mind a delectable holiday dinner. That said, I would be hard pressed to drink more than one or two of these. Just a touch too sweet for my liking."
"Overall, a good beer. One of the best smelling beers I've tried yet, just too bad the flavor isn't as good."
"Overall it is a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a copper color with 1 finger of head that fades with a ring of lace. Has a faint aroma of roasted malt mixed among a spicy, ginger-ish main note. I also pick-up some medicinal notes, too. The taste is surprisingly smooth and creamy. A malty front end fades as the flavor of clove and nutmeg fill the middle and then a slightly astringent, fast finish. This is a tasty beer; winter warmers have a tendency to be overpowered with spices, but this one is nicely balanced with good complexity."
"D: While this beer may not totally live up to its legendary reputation in Cleveland, it's still a wonderful winter warmer with an almost flawlessly integrated spice character. This scores big points for its seasonal flavor - without question a true Christmas Ale rather than a limited release winter beer."
"D: Very high drinkability. I could go for another one of these. I have to admit that this is probably one notch below the 12 dogs of chistmas from Thirsty Dog."
"Drinkability- The alcohol is barely detectable... this beer really truely tastes like christmas to me!"
"Spices are nicely done in this one, they are not so overpowering I can't have more then one. Very good holiday beer and I will be buying this again whenever I go home for the holidays."
"this beer poured into a four ounce glass in a flight is a nice amber brown color without much head retention to speak of. the aroma brings a good amount of sweet malt character and a bit of floral hops at the back. not nearly as strongly spiced as some holiday brews I've quaffed, all in all very well balanced. the full body and good co2 make this a very drinkable beer, especially for a winter warmer."
"D- For a spiced beer this one is very drinkable. GL Christmas Ale tastes like winter to me, one of my favorite holiday beers for sure."
"d- lovely christmas beer. So easy to drink, even with the 7.5 abv. If I could find it in PA, i would buy cases upon cases of this stuff. I would drink it every day with every meal."
"A very easily drinkable holiday brew is what we have here. Wait, I just remembered that this weighs in at 7.50%abv. Wow! It's completely undetectable. This one will surely kick your teeth in, if you aren't careful with it."
"Always a favorite of mine at Christmas but beware. These sneak up on you and before you know it... game over. I'm a big fan of Great Lakes and this is a seasonal beer in the true sense. Enjoy!"
"D- My top winter warmer, goes down easy and will make you merry in short measure."
"Overall, this one was just okay. Not as good as I remember from the old days and not as enjoyable as the Ommegang Adoration which I recently had. I'll probably pass on this one next time and just get another sixer of Eddy Fitz or Eliot Ness."
"I wish it were Christmas all year long! Also delicious in bottle."
"old scores 4, 4.5, 3.5, 4, 4"
"D: High for a winter warmer."
"D - while nice, one is enough. this one screams ""Happy Holidays!"""
"On-tap at Alto Cinco and drank it along side a covered burrito with chicken. This beer was basically a big, smooth amber ale - light caramel and toffee - with spiced with pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little ginger. Drinkable and festive, but I'm not blown away. The spices and malt are at least very well balanced."
"Drinkability - I could easily have another. I think I will. A nice holiday treat and I'm glad I was able to get a six pack while in Cleveland earlier this month because I cannot find it now in Dayton."
"In the end, it satisfies - super mild for a winter warmer and very easy to drink. Why did I used to hate this stuff?"
"Overall, not my favorite winter warmer, but a decent one. I haven't had many Great Lakes brews, but I feel this woulnd't be my favorite one by a long shot. Thanks for the chance Ben!"
"D; I wish they had this one all year long a very nice winter warmer, I said that before but it reminded me of a Jenlain Ambre ( Biere de Garde)"
"D: I decided to see what all the fuss was about, only to be let down. While it is a decent brew, this one is not worth going out of your way for."
"Beautiful red hue with quickly fading white head. Aroma of ginger, some other spices. Some lacing and rings around the glass, reminds me of snow. Flavor is nice balance of cinnamon, ginger, and sweet honey. Very drinkable, and at 7.5% abv. it's very sessionable, for about 4 beers (230z. brewtus at applebee's), then it's nap time."
"D: All day. All month. All season, I could. Enough alcohol so you know it's beer, but not so much I couldn't have four or five of an evening. Thank goodness. Now, if only it were more readily available here..."
"Mouth- Moderate carbonation, big malty flavor makes for medium to full bodied beer but relatively (and deceivingly) refreshing/drinkable for ABV. One of my favorite winter warmers! This one will catch up with you! Drink it fresh to get the full experience, or, if you think its too spicy let it mellow for a while and the flavors will round out!"
"D: All too easy to consume, ended too quickly. Would gladly have more - the ground spices are balanced well by those hops; end result: a tasty warmer that blends seasonal flavor and introduces a hard-to-describe 'nostalgia'. Flavor/aroma resurrected memories of Christmases past, spent with family in Illinois - that's praiseworthy enough. Recommended!"
"Overall, from the hype I've heard this beer was a big let down in every sense. I would not encourage anyone to drink this."
"I've rated drinkability so high with this one because of that mix of spices that keeps the beer lively and interesting with every sip. I could see drinking this late into the evening on Christmas Eve in front of a fire, watching the snow fall outside. Well done Great Lakes, well done."
"Future outlook: Great Lakes rarely disappoints, and this is no exception. A superb warmer that I'll be happy to have again next year."
"D: This is among my favorite holiday seasonals. All to often, holiday beers are packed with spices that at times can be overwhelming. This beer delivers a package of spiciness in a mellow and well balanced way. This beer is very drinkable as it keeps you wanting more."
"Overall, this is a great beer. I don't know if I could drink it all year 'round but it works well in this weather and season."
"Overall, a fine holiday offering, if a bit on the sweet side."
"Dark copper color. I get the nutmeg, but the ginger is pretty faint to me. Maybe I'm just used to that ""in your face"" sushi ginger. I really didn't get much cinnamon in the nose. I did get the sweet, toasty malt. Roasted sweet malt and nutmeg dominated the flavor for me. I then got a hint of honey and cinnamon. The cinnamon is more of a cinnamon/sugar mixture like you'd put on toast. This is pretty good stuff, but I'd rather have them brew Nosferatu in a little more abundance...I've exhausted my local connection for the year!"
"The beer pours an amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and crystal malt scent along with a light array of spices that's not overly done. The ginger is the most pronounced. The taste is good. It has a nice cinnamon and ginger flavor along with a dry crystal malt taste. It's relatively light for a warmer, but the spice contribution adds a nice touch. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking winter seasonal. It's nothing exceptional, but it's good for what it is."
"Very dark brown mahogony with a huge light brown head. Pretty beer. Spices hit you hard early on. There is a big malty presance with a fair amount of herbal, cirtus hops. The spice is in control though. I try to keep an open mind with a beer like this. I don't like spiced beers as a rule. As this style goes it's one of the better ones. Cloves, cinamon, a ton of nutmeg, anise, I'm sure there are more that I can't identify right away. Very malty-sweet. I think they use honey or maybe brown sugar to help it along. It has a little bit of a herbal bitterness from the hops in the finish. I think that is why it is a little more balanced than some of the other examples. It helps to cut the spice a little and cleanse the pallet between sips. If I'm in the right mood one is somewhat enjoyable. I can't do a second. Would be pretty good beer if they left the spice out."
"M&D - smooth and easy drinking, full bodied and warming, again as a winter warmer should be, a well brewer beer, a nice introduction to GLBC for me"
"D - Way too sweetly rich. Had trouble getting through the first one, the nutmeg and cinnamon spice are so overpowering it almost feels like it's burning my mouth. This might go good with some food, I'm thinking Chinese or some cheeses to help buffer the taste buds, but on it's own it's just too much for me."
"Drinkability- Though I claim not to love this beer (maybe because of all the hype) I can't deny that it's a tasty example of the style, and a staple of the holidays. I couldn't finish a six pack alone-- but then the alcohol whispers ""yes you can."""
"Overall, this beer is good...but I feel like it's been better in the past. I'm not sure if Great Lakes changes the recipe each year. I remember loving the 2007 batch of this beer...and the 2006, as well. This one doesn't feel the same...perhaps needs to mature some in the bottle...though the expiration date for this one is in January. Interesting, as I've had this years past the expiration and it has seemed to improve. I hope that holds true for this batch, as well."
"This is my favorite seasonal beer ever. This is a rich Winter Warmer. Honestly the first time I had it I wasnt that impressed. But I gave it a second chance and my second tasting completly changed my opinion. This is a seasonal beer usually released by GLB in late October through the New Year. Mostly served around with Cleveland and surronding area in a glass with the rim coated with cinnamon and sugar mixture. Reddish tint with a rich taste. GLB has compiled a great mixture here that is a must try. This year I will buy more and fill up the fridge in my garage."
"I pours a reddish brown color with about a half inch of head. Leaves a tiny bit of lace after disipating. The smell is very inviting. Spices abound into my nose. Cinnamon is the main character. The taste is spicy and malty. I'm getting a peppery orange hint. It actually reminds me of christmas. This beer light on the palate not heavy at all which I did not expect with a winter warmer. Not bad. I might start humming some christmas tunes. In July."
"D - Very good holiday warmer. Still good in July. Definitely warms the throat. Solid release from Great Lakes."
"This is a strong, tasty winter warmer and a good example of the style."
"D: Not my favorite Winter Warmer, but like everything Great Lakes does... it's pretty darn tasty."
"My second Great Lakes beer I am noticing a profile among their beers. I'm really liking them. This is probably my favorite winter warmer that I've had by far, but doesn't remind me much of the others I've had so take that with some caution. Highly recommended for beer drinkers and non-drinkers alike! This beer is superb in almost all respects."
"Notes: Bottle is clearly superior to the tap version in my opinion. Maybe the beer needed a little time to perfect?"
"Maybe my palate was off, maybe my bottle was bad. I will definitely try this fresh next holiday season, probably on tap from the brewery to make sure it's fresh. I will see if my opinion changes."
"Not a favorite style, but pretty good."
"(D) A delicious brew. The spice flavorings make this beer a fantastic yuletide drink."
"D - Great Lakes let me down. I may give this a shot again next year, but I'll stick to SN Celebration Ale for my christmas beers."
"D: It is an easy drinker since its balanced with spice and sweetness. The ABV although not that high is well hidden in the flavor."
"Very nice and clean, coppery/orange color. decent sized head as well and some great lacing on down. very spicy aroma-nutmeg, cinnamon, some cloves. Solid malty flavor with a definate spice taste to it. Mildly sweet. Trace of caramel like sweetness as well. Good motuhfeel-it helps the whole thing come together. Quite drinkable and enjoyable. Reminds me of how the Harpoon Winter used to be before it became liquid pumpkin pie and what I now find is a complete a mess in a bottle. Could not do a lot of these in 1 sitting but a nice holiday beer for sure."
"This is definitely a unique seasonal beer. Not overly spiced but spices are prominent flavors. Above average drink ability, thanks alot to Sonicdescent for providing it to me as an extra"
"The drinkability is fine for one, but the unusual taste/smell makes it a one timer. Very well done, one of my favorite American Christmas brews."
"This beer pours a hazy reddish-brown with a thin tan creamy head. Smells sweet with cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste is sweet up front and then becomes spicy. The spiciness stays on the tongue after drinking. The mouthfeel has medium body and moderate carbination. Drinkability is decent. I enjoyed the single and could probably have a couple."
"Drinkability: Had no idea it was 7.5% till I logged on. Very drinkable. A very enjoyable seasonal."
"While I am not the biggest fan of Christmas Ales I thought this stuff was pretty good. I just noticed that it's 7.5% too, that makes it even better."
"What's not to like. Three fingers of creamy white head, and a nose full of aroma. Hints of vanilla, spice? and honey in addition to hops makes you want to take a sip. When you do, you'll get a mouth full of flavor with lasting impact after you swallow.The appearance is slightly cloudy and the color is a nice amber, almost like honey."
"A great holiday beer. It tastes like Christmas minus the turkey and such. Great with party foods. Had this with a Christmas roast and it was one of the greatest things ever. Nice foamy head and great color. Ginger was at the forefront of the taste. A great buy for anyone. Great lakes did a fantastic job with this one."
"Overall this was a good Christmas Ale. I liked its light body and that I could probably turn non-crafters onto it."
"D: Take your time with this one... becomes a little better the more it warms up.... For me this one is not a multi drinker... I would add this one to my winter mix any time."
"Single bottle from Vrai Amour in Chicago."
"Final Thought: Freaking awesome on-tap or in growler... just a great example of Great Lakes' versatility as a top national brewer."
"D: One of the best winter warmers or holiday spice beers out there. For me - it's not Christmas unless I have a Great Lakes Christmas Ale on Christmas Eve!"
"Smell of honey predominated with muted spice - spearmint, cinammon, all spice. Taste is honey sweet and the spiciness quite a subtle backdrop. Silky textured mouthfeel impresses and the honey is not so sickingly sweet as those macro lagers I try to avoid. The mouthfeel is slightly cider-like but with a balanced sweetness that is endearing. This is a very pleasant winter warmer with well hidden alcohol, very tasty ... I could enjoy this all winter if it was available. Thanks, Jan."
"Great Lakes Christmas Ale should make every beer drinkers Christmas list during the holiday season."
"Pours out a copper color you can see through, light tan head that seems to die out quickly. Smells of cinnamon and caramel sweetness very Christmas-like. Tastes like cinnamon, nutmeg, pretty mild notes nothing too overpowering. Very balanced and mild. Seemed to be a little under carbonated to me, but it was a decent beer, definitely not my favorite Christmas brew."
"Drinkable, but nothing I'd go out of my way for."
"This is one of the top selling Christmas beers. I can see why people like this beer, but it's not for me. The holiday spice overpowers anything else found in this ale. I always try at least one each year, but it's not something I can sit and continually enjoy."
"D - This is a really great tasting Christmas ale, however, the flavors are a bit too much to have several at a time."
"mouthfeel is of a great weight and level of carbonation, ginger spiciness hangs around combined with hop bitterness lingering is very nice, sweet and fairly easy to drink - excellent."
"hmmm. The bottle I'm having seems to be way different than the descrptions that most others describe. Mine has: some head and lace; dark, very hazy brown color; aroma of lots of malt, a bit of hops, bare hints of spices. Flavor is very dry malt, not much fruityiness, hardly any spice, dark fruits. Ok beer, nothing special. A bit rich for a session beer. ok finish."
"The taste is an exceptional blend of caramel malt, mulling spice and hop. A delicious medium bodied beer. Very drinkable."
"*As a side note, I somehow came across drinking this while eating a tart lemon-raspberry desert bar after the initial review, and it tastes magnificent."
"I really enjoyed this Christmas Ale from Great Lakes. I'm surprised to see some grade it very low because Winter Warmers, such as this brew, are different from the beers we enjoy the rest of the year. It has a nice frothy head and a nice amber color and I really enjoyed it, even after consuming two Goose Island Christmas Ales, which had quenched my holiday thirst. Great Lakes makes some great brews and I look forward to reviewing some more."
"However, as is typical for Great Lakes, first-class ingredients are used and the flavors that make me uncomfortable are often enjoyed by others."
"Overall, I'm more impressed with this beer every time I have it. I've enjoyed it on tap, but I think the biggest factor in how well I've liked it is the glassware. This is my best experience with this beer yet, so maybe they're on to something when they recommend a snifter."
"This beer is very drinkable and quite suiting for the holiday season."
"D=very high, if I wasn't consciously tryin something different each beer, I would stick by this in a Pittsburgh minute."
"M&D-No complaints on either. Super smooth, the spices don't bog you down enough to keep you from having a couple, and the elevated ABV just made my family that much more tolerable this visit. Thank you Great Lakes for giving me a reason to go to Ohio!"
"It seems regardless of how many of these I buy, I always end up wishing I had another bottle. Granted, I'd make that same statement of anything by Great Lakes Brewing but I really do consider their Christmas Ale to be a fantastic seasonal offering. It is a savory, warming, and easy drinking ale perfectly suited for the holiday season - I better buy even more next year!"
"The aroma is malty and almost fruit like but has a hint of honey and mixed spices. The appearance is amber with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma and not that pleasant but not that bad. The palate is smooth but thin. Overall not as special as I wanted. Thank you Depak."
"D: Extremely sessionable. What can I say? This ale actually tastes like Christmas! Make this Gold Medal-Winning seasonal a holiday mainstay."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (Best By 12/16/08) and served in a pint glass. This beer poured a beautiful, clear dark copper hue with a thin head of beige foam that displayed some decent retention. Some light lacing was left around the glass. The aroma consisted of caramel, honey, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Not overly spiced...the rich malts still shine through nicely. The flavor started off with a solid base of creamy caramel, followed by pie spices, and a very mellow honey note. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had minimal carbonation. Rich, malty, and drinkable. A great holiday beer."
"Winter warmers are not usually a style I really enjoy, but this one is an exception. I shouldn't have been surprised as Great Lakes puts out an exceptional product. I'll do my best to make this one a Christmas tradition."
"D: I could have 2 or 3 these no problem, but this is the only time of year I'd seek it out (quite appropriate I think)."
"Pours a brilliantly clear copper with nice visible carbonation and a very short lived head which was disappointing. Aroma is strong on the ginger side with a floating presence of cinnamon and some nice deep malt. Reminds me a bit of Magic Hat's Odd Notion which I am also a fan of. This is nice, though, since you get the sort of ""bakery smells"" in a way only captured by beer. I'd say it could use a little hit from the hops in the aroma to really hit home.. even just a bit since this is not supposed to be an overly hoppy beer, although I think a more aggressively hopped version of this would actually work out very well. Taste is bitter and woody.. like being in an antique store where the smells are coming from so many directions from so many different places and times that it produces a wholly unique flavor. Very similar to Odd Notion again. At 7.5% ABV, I would have never guessed it to be much over 5. Carbonation is a little prickly in the mothfeel but I don't think it takes away from the experience. A pretty medium body, but complemented with a ton of malt flavor- the combination seems a little contradictory but it ends out working really great. I don't find much that takes away from the drinkability of this beer but I can see myself being turned off by it in the very long run due to some of the spices. This beer gets a lot of hype and it's definitely good but, I'll mention it again, try it back to back with Odd Notion and see if you really get that much of a difference."
"Drinkability: Fair enough I would say -- I could easily sit down and drink two or three of these. The spiciness was very interesting and the physical effect of it on the stomach makes it more worthwhile -- definitely a seasonal drink though."
"Overall, this is a interesting winter warmer. Not quite what I expected."
"One of my favorite Christmas brews."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Spices up front, cinnamon and clove again, perhaps a touch of nutmeg. Toffee sweetness, toasted malt and a touch of alcohol. This stuff is pretty damn drinkable for the 7.5% ABV, facilitated by the medium-light body and crisp finish. Bitterness is in perfect balance with the malts, though there's little actual hop flavor beyond a hint of leafy herbs. Very nice stuff, a step above most winter warmers."
"D - This is a really nice take on a Christmas ale. It's spicy, sweet and malty, but not overdone at all. All of the flavors and aromas are quite subtle, resulting in a very well-balanced and flavorful ale for the winter months."
"Clear copper color when poured with a good amount of head. Has a spicy holiday smell. Can smell the caramel malts with a slight hint of hops and spices. Excellent mixture of hops and malts. Can taste the spices very well. A bit sweet. This is the ideal holiday beer. Feels smooth and medium-bodied in your mouth. Very drinkable beer if you like the traditional Christmas Ale's. This is by far my favorite Winter Warmer."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery. This tastes of the holidays all over! Nice minty spice mixed with some caramel. Slight tangy bite at the end, but it's pleasant, not overbearing. This is a great holiday brew that I hope to have again really soon."
"Overall a nicely drinkable beer, but as noted in the taste, as the beer warms it seems to lose some of its intrigue. Still, a very tasty and satisfying Christmas ale with nice overall quality. I could sit around and drink a few of these this season, if only I had them locally to drink."
"The carbonation was excellent and there was little evidence of the power if the abv was really 7.5%. I was not overly pleased with this beer but it is fairly decent in you like spiced christmas ales."
"Nothing personal. I just can't handle it."
"D- I want another, unfortunately I've only got the one so I'll have to wait to buy more which I definitely plan on doing soon."
"Pretty close to perfect."
"Overall - Great Lakes has done it again! One of my favorite breweries has produced another great beer. When I was at the store I overheard the manager telling a customer that they were flying off the shelves, so I grabbed the last 6 pack they had, and I understand why. I only hope they have more for Christmas Eve!!!"
"A darkish golden pour from tap with a small white lacing around glass. You can't miss the sweet smell. The word snappy fits this beer well. It is a winter warmer but not from the usual alcohol burn. The alcohol is almost completely hidden. The warm comes from the mix of cinnamon, hops, and most of all spiciness. The alcohol must be there because I sure did feel it after finishing the glass."
"D: Pretty solid brew. Definitely feels like Christmas. I recommend trying it."
"D- This is the beer of the season in my opinion. Since a few years back the demand for this beer has gone through the roof. Consequently the brewing time that they apply has gone down along with the alcohol level and complexity of flavor. However a aging works well with this beer bringing it very close to its original glory. Either way its a beer worth seeking out."
"I've had this before on tap, and I think the the bottle is superior actually. I'm curious as to how well this cellars."
"D - Very drinkable. Alc is well hidden. Excellent copper ale. Reminds me of Otter Creek copper...only much better."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not as hoppy as I like my beers, but very satisfying none the less. In my opinion, just about anyone could enjoy this beer. A solid choice for the holidays."
"Easy drinking winter warmer, didn't feel like a 7.5% abv."
"The beer should be served at the temperature recommended on the bottle - 55°F. Otherwise the subtle aromas and flavors are buried."
"Definitely a great seasonal and worth picking up."
"D - A great beer for a cold winter evening. Has everything that I am looking for in a good winter ale."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth, but carbonation gives it a nice edge."
"D= On tap the flavor profile is different and much better than in the bottle. Drinkability suffers a bit from those spices being more bold - I can't say I would want more than one or two of these in a day. Still a very good beer from a very good brewery."
"D - I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but this one grew on me since the last time I had it almost a year ago. I'd drink about a 6 pack per winter, and that would be plenty for me. It does put you in the holiday mood with the flavor profile, I'll say that much."
"Ordered in pint at Beef O'Brady's and really enjoyed this beer. This was my first GL Christmas Ale on draft. It was brownish/orange with a small head. The smell and taste were very similar with some nutmeg, cinnamon and maybe a hint of ginger. This is an excellent Christmas ale and is very drinkable. I ended up having a few."
"This is my favorite of the Winter Warmers/Christmas beers, I always look forward to picking up some as soon as it comes out. I can easily drink an entire six pack over an evening, but try to restrain myself because of the abv. Pick some up and you won't be sorry!"
"Well done Great Lakes!"
"Had this at the Great Lakes bar in the Cleveland Airport. Review from notes: 22oz pour. Dark amber with orange highlights, nice fluffy off-white head that left little lacing, probably from the frosted glass. Spicy, malty aroma with hints of maple syrup, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Flavor was malty sweet, nice amount of spices, again with the cinnamon and nutmeg, along with a bit of orange peel for good measure. A nice piney hop flavor shows up here and there. Citrusy flavors make an appearance but get pushed out of the way by the spices. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, very delicious Christmas Ale. One of the best Winter Warmers I've tried."
"D Great christmas time drink, but not something for an everyday sip."
"D: A high ABV keeps this beer from being a session beer, but a good winter warmer."
"Happened to be in town on release day this year. Not much head on the pints but laced nicely. Smelled of cinnamon and hops which mixed for a ginger like taste. was a nice copper/brown color .It went down so nice I had a second and even went to buy a case but they had run out of bottles by that point... will certainly be looking for this in the store for the holidays"
"Drinkability - This beer goes down pretty easy. I wouldn't have more than one in a sitting, but it was great on a cold night."
"2006 edition, hit the shelves late October. I missed this one last year, when I finally went looking it was already off the shelves. That being said I grabbed a single as soon as I spotted it, having heard mixed reviews I wanted to try one before I parted with $10 for a sixer. All in all this is a pleasant spicy warmer of a brew, I did expect something a little thicker and more powerful. Aroma is mild and well balanced with honey and clover mixed with a nice touch of ginger, not powerful but very mellow. Color is a dark copper with an amber-red hue, nice big head that dissipates leaving lots of lacing. Light on the palate with a cool dry finish the mouthfeel isn't as heavy as I wanted but it works. Flavor is medium bodied with an initial burst of honey leading way to the subtle spices. Malty and spicy it's definately not overdone as can happen all to easily with this style. Good Drink, plan on taking some home to the family for the holiday."
"d. This is a most excellent winter warmer. Complex and warming indeed. A winner. What I have come to expect from this brewery."
"This is a good beer, not one of the best Great Lakes, but a good beer nonetheless"
"Great beer!"
"Also, excellent graphic of a prewar Lionel 512 gondola, I have mine filled with small gifts when I run my standard gauge under the tree!!!"
"Another great beerfrom Great Lakes."
"D - Overall a pretty good and non challengin winter warmer. It has a nice spice characteristic but it is not at all too spicy. This would be a good beer to drink during Christmas and could easy drink a couple of them around the holidays. However, as I said above, the beer reminds me more of a fall beer than a Christmas one."
"The 7.5% is hidden very well. this is one i could drink a few of on a night and be very happy. I might have to hunt down a sixer every winter :)"
"D- Very drinkable and is great for the season even though I'm finishing off mine a little late."
"Pours a clear copper with a fluffy beige head. Smells spiced, and similar to those in a pumpkin beer. I'm not able to pick out cinnamon or ginger specifically, but it is nice. Taste is much of the same spiced flavors. Some nutmeg as well, I believe. Some slight alcohol present, or perhaps its the tartness I'm sensing. Very nice seasonal that I enjoyed more as it warmed."
"D-Totally. As stated before this os one of my favs of the season. Nothing is overdone and the flavours meld very nicely."
"I can't believe I've never reviewed this beer. I've been drinking it for a while now. Pours a clear ruby/brown in color. There is no remaining head that lasts after the pour. There is some definite ginger in the nose, and it's nice. Taste is much the same. Mouthfeel is medium in body and lively on the tongue. Very good, seasonal, sessionable brew."
"This is every bit the excellent beer that so many have told me it was. I am thankful that I was persueded to give this a second go."
"But alas. This is the end of the Great Lakes brews I have. Soon I will return to Brooklyn (I am in Pittsburgh right now), and they will be out of reach."
"I can really only drink one of these at a time. It's a very interesting beer and worth a try, just not my thing."
"Dry & a little low on carbonation, it still flows really easy. Low in the hop department almost always equal in me having another. There's a reason it's available in six packs. :) Alcohol really is all to quiet. Why did I only get one?! :P"
"An always welcome way to keep the cold and slush from becoming a downer, I will always cherish my GLCA. Because of the heaviness, alcohol, and spices, they force moderation, but that's the nature of this Great beast."
"Pours a nice clear ruby red color with amber hues with a thin white head, ok retention touch of lacing. Smells are sweet, lots of honey and cinnamon and other Christmas spices, cherries, berry with a hint of hops and a good malt sweetness. Taste is sweet, like a gingerbread cookie with some fruitiness of cherries and winter berries with a twist of honey, touch of alcohol in the finish. Good carbonation with medium body. Good mix of sweetness and spices and a little candy-like. This is nice beer to enjoy for the holidays, easy to drink and flavorful."
"That said I'm done with this when the 6 pack is done. This is the first beer from Great Lakes that I wasn't blown away by but hey you can't always be perfect. This beer however imo is average at best."
"Pint filled with a dark caramel color liquid with a short but strong head. Thin sheets of lace, nicely carbonated. Nice smells of spice and hops. Taste was good, with some spices, cinammon, clove, with the dark malt flavors. High alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel and drinkability were both OK, maybe a bit thin. I always like a well made local beer."
"This is a full-on spicy winter warmer. The taste is very reminiscent of holiday goodies. All of the ingredients are in balance and blend very well together. This is probably the best winter warmer that I have tried thus far. The spices and the 7.5% abv will certainly warm you on a cold winter night."
"Pretty easy drinking here, with no cloying or out of place flavors or notice of booze."
"Drinkability: An alright holiday beer, but I couldn't help but get gingered pretty quickly."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability were both great for this beer, especially considering the high ABV and the spiciness of the beer. Overall, this is one of my favorite winter beers by far. I will definitely drink more of this and eagerly anticipate its release every winter."
"Notes: Wasn't too impressed with this brew, but then again I'm not a fan of the style. I wish I could have found more than one spice in the beer, but for what it's worth, it's not bad for the style. Something to try, but I probably won't try it again."
"Bottom line, GLBC rocks and so does their winter warmer."
"D'ability - spices are too overwhelming to be a very drinkable beer for me. Probably not out of line for a holiday beer, but the best ones are more subtle in the spiciness."
"A tasty Xmas ale, guessing 6.5% - lets see what BA says 7.5! well hidden!"
"i spoke with the guy that i buy most of my beer from about 3 weeks after having this beer. i mentioned to him that it was a bit spicy for my taste. he said to let it age a little. well i forgot that i had two bottles hiding in the back of my fridge until May 18. i pulled them out and drank them. Excellent. much better balance of the spice at this point. i likely did not need to wait this long but i will do this again in 08."
"D- Maybe a bit too sweet for me to have many, but a fine Christmas beer all the same."
"I drank this beer on Christmas day, which seemed appropriate. Poured into a snifter. The beer is very pretty; clear and the color of the amber honey I see every year at the KY State Fair. Very small, off-white head which faded very quickly. It smells a bit like honey, malt, and Christmas spices. The mouthfell is medium-thick. Tastes of honey and malt, with a pop of hop bitterness in the mid-back of the tongue. It gets a bit cloyingly sweet toward the end of the bottle, so you really can't drink more than one. It was fun to try, but I probably won't be buying it next year."
"Overall- This is a new Christmas favorite. It's renewed my faith in winter warmers (of which I've recently had a hard time finding something with a good balance of flavors). It was a nice combination of malts and spices which are definitely noticeable, but not overdone."
"ETC: like drinking a beehive without getting stung on the tongue. I would love to see some orange zest or a touch of hemlock hops at the end to cleanse the palate. All in all, one dimensional, but worth a try."
"Overall this is a superb and complex flavored Winter Warmer and my first taste from a bottle. I had a pint of it a few weeks ago but was rushed to down the last half due to a sudden appointment. Follow the bottles advice and serve around 55', it really brings out the various flavors. Another outstanding offering from the people up I-71 & will make sure to pick up another sixer before the end of the season."
"I nice mix of festive flavors and easy drinkibility make this a great Christmas beer and another winner from the GLBC."
"Even though this is a spiced ale, the spices don't assert themselves so much that they overtake the whole show. After downing 25oz, I was seriously considering another mug."
"Drinkability: A nice drink for the colder months, with enough spices to accent a solid beer without overpowering it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied leaning toward medium. Carbonation is excellent. 7.5% is perfect for this one. Goes down very smooth and very drinkable. Overall, it's a very good Christmas ale. Certainly recommended."
"Drinkability: One of the great Christmas beers out there"
"Overall, a cinnamon beer. It overpowers every other flavor, and takes away any variety whatsoever."
"Tastes wet sweet with lotsa brown ale character. Chocolate and nutty with a delicious gingerbread cookie character. Fuzzy hop character, cinnamon, and sweet coriander flavor. Drying finish from herbal aromatics and cleaning alcohol. Aftertaste is dry with ginger. Md-light body and moderate carbonation. Not alot here, but still enjoyable."
"d - very good but they could tone down the sweetness a tad and this would amazing."
"My wife who is not normally a beer drinker, really enjoyed this the more she drank of it. It was nice to sit in front of the window and watch the snow fall, while sipping this winter warmer. I havent been too dissapointed with many Great Lakes brews, and this one is no different. Very good Christmas Beer."
"Pours a clean copper color with a tan/ off white head. In the aroma, cinnamon and a sweetness. In the taste, cinnamon and mixed holiday spices. A smooth, yet sticky-sweet mouthfeel and a dry cinnamon aftertaste. Not bad, but cinnamon is a bit much. Easy to drink, but I don't think I could drink two."
"D- An enjoyable and unique beer. Christmas in a bottle right here."
"D - Good. I can sit back and enjoy a couple of these very easily."
"Pours a clear light amber with a one finger off-white head that dies down to a thin layer of almost nothing. Some stickiness remains on the sides of the glass. Smell is a powder cinnamon and a gingerbread aroma. Light honey and peppermint tickle the nose as well. Chesnut flavors up front with a fresh cinnamon sweetness. Some floral hops that mellow out from the caramel malt. Light to medium body with a decent carbonation. This warmer is like Goldschläger gone beer, but in a good way. I never would have guessed the 7.5% abv., wow. Great brew for the holiday season."
"D: Very nice. Never thought it was 7.5%. I could have a few of those."
"Came to the table a nice deep amber/medium copper color. Excellent head and nice lacing, as well. Decent smell, a nice malt/hop mix. Great taste. A very deep ale taste with a wonderful honey kick. I caught a little of the ginger, but not much else over the honey. Goes down very easy, I will definitely have this one again."
"Pours a nice crystal and bubbly copper color with a thin layer of off white head. Smell is of strong cinnamon and some ginger bread, as well as a thin amount of honey. Taste is very sweet at first then then gingerbread kind of kicks in, very limited bittering. Mouthfeeling is nice and light."
"Don't think about drinking more than two of these. Spices can get to you, along with the incredibly high alcohol content."
"D: Didn't drink much at all. Winter Warmer isn't my favorite style but I don't dislike it by any means... this one just didn't do it. It's very unfortunate, too, since GLBC is one of my favorite breweries."
"Christmas Ale, we always look forward to this seasonal favorite. A lot of breweries have beers with Christmas names (like Santas Butt) but this beer really captures the flavors of the holiday. Its brewed with honey and spiced with fresh ginger and cinnamon which gives it the great holiday aroma. Good mouth feel with good carbonation to release those spicy smells makes this a very drinkable beer."
"My first Christmas brew of the season and a good way to start things off. The aroma of this beer screams Christmas and it doesn't dissapoint."
"This is truly an incredible beer. Definitely one of my new favorites. The balance is perfect. Beautiful copper color pour with a medium to thick head with perfect lacing. Smell is subtle but intriguing. Taste is very smooth, very clean yet a bit complex. The ginger doesn't come through until later. When finishing off your first bottle the cinnamon is much more pronounced at the bottom. The finish is incredible and really keeps you coming back for more. Highly, highly recommended. Seasonal availability Oct through Dec."
"D- a nice treat for the holidays, but i prefer to stick to the basics. a find all the various spices unnecessary and i get tired of them quickly. after i finish one of these, i want something thats just :water>grain>yeast>hops:"
"D - This is pretty good beer that I normally end up buying more than once during the season."
"Starchy and smooth but with a bit of sharpness and plenty of warmth in the finish. Moderate carbonation really ups the spice on the tongue. Another well crafted beer from Great Lakes. Oh, and watching the Steelers stomp the Ravens on Monday Night Football doesnt hurt the experience either."
"D- This gets a 4.0 from me for two reasons. 1. It was easy to finish in a short amount of time and I probably could have consumed more of it. 2. I would have never guessed the ABV was so high because there is no hint of that anywhere in the smell/taste/mouthfeel. Other than that-this is an above average winter warmer that I will probably have again before the season is over but it was nothing that impressed me too much."
"Crystal clear golden brown with about a finger of white head. Aroma is of ginger, honey, and a little cinnamon. Nicely sweet, not at all too sweet. The flavor shows about the same balance as the aroma. The ginger stand out a bit more than the other flavors and lingers a little longer, but the sweetness of the honey and the spiciness of the cinnamon provide a nice balance. Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess. This would be great to have around during the holiday season."
"On-tap is the way to go."
"I have no idea where i got this, but i have a good idea where it is about to go! Pours as a shiny red beer with hints of brown. Smells like one of those off-brand colas you get from a 25cent machine. plummy and spicy with notes of nutmeg, maple, honey and cinnamon, but still in a kind of cheap soda way. Very tasty though. a veritable fruitcake of flavors...nutmeg is the most pronounced, with a lot of ginger as well and cinnamon....not over the top in flavor though...spices run thick but there's a nice malt backbone in it. Medium bodied and well balanced. One of the better spiced beers ive tried."
"D: This is a pretty good beer considering I drank it in July. It would be even better in the winter I bet."
"Slightly creamy, medium bodied beer. Spicy, herbal aftertaste. Glad I got to try it, but I don't think I would ever buy it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the slightly cloudy coppery amber brew. Head fades at a moderate pace, with sporadic lasting lace. Aroma is dominated by sweet malts and spices. Taste is a muddy mixture of spice, grains, and piney hops. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, and this isn't something I would probably search out again. But as a one-time seasonal visitor, it's not too bad."
"Drinkability is good. This is a different twist for me on the Winter Warmer style. But this is an enjoyable and interesting beer. Would love to try this again this coming winter."
"D: considering how sweet this beer is, Id say it still goes down rather smooth. I wouldnt drink more than 2 or three of these though."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a touch syrupy with a low carbonation, and a good drinkability."
"D---Now this is a great winter warmer. Nice use of spice and just enough alcohol to balance."
"Drinkability is a bit low due to its flavor combination. I purchased this at Woodman's at a discount ($6 for a 6-pack). I'm not sure if it really was on discount, but it seemed worth the current price, especially since I was looking for something different. And I found it! However, I'd probably hold off on having this again in the future except with desserts. And by desserts I mean Christmas desserts that consist of either: Gingerbread cookies or Pumpkin Pie. Don't forget the whip cream."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Color has a slight red tinge with a little head that leaves some lacing. Looks nice/festive & very clear. Smells spicy - a little clove, some vanilla, cinnamon, and a slight hint of orange. Tasts sweet and malty up front, like a cookie, but finishes sour - maybe it's the orange? Mouthfeel is thin, but is functional in this case. Definitely a sipping and/or dessert beer - I would not crack another one tonight. Recommended."
"The taste is lightly sweet up front, with a definitely spicy middle. A ginger-like peppery character rests solidly in the middle of this brew, actually it tends to linger a bit in the finish along with a cinnamon character. This beer is quite light and drinkable, in fact it drinks much easier than even 7.5%. I really like the spice levels in this beer, it is quite noticeable, but not so dominating that it is distracting. Fruity notes provide a nice balance to the spices; notes of cherries, green raisins, sweet Muscat, and even a light orange note reminiscent what one would find in some dessert wines. In the end this is quite drinkable and even enjoyable."
"D: Not impressed with the drinkability of this one, and I tend to favor winter warmers. Seems like there's not enough balance to this one."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a golden-amber color with a thick creme colored head that leaves small webs of lacing. The smell is of amber/crystal malt with hops coming through as grapefruit and pine. The taste is similar to the nose, with a pretty hoppy finish for the style. Alcohol is well hidden. This is a very drinkable beer, goes down smooth. A must try beer."
"Prost!"
"Another solid beer from Great Lakes...never get tired of their offerings."
"Pours a nice medium amber. Small bubbles and very faint lacing. A head thats only a finger and a half in width. But maintains all through my drinking experience. For some reason, a Christmas beer has to be more cloudy to be festive. The aroma is very festive indeed. Plenty of X-mas spices like some nutmeg and cinnaon and anise all mixed together very well with a toasty malt profile. The taste is a little more clear on whats really driving the beer's flavors. Lots of nutmeg adn a few hints of chammomile. Don't forget the cinnamon. All of these spices are blanaced with a light Pacific hop presence and a medium toasty alt stance. Great Holiday beer, certainly has the best drinkablility of all the winter warmers. Doesn't bog you down with Holiday spices and aromas."
"Pours a nice orange amber with a decent head that fades pretty quickly. Smellis honey up front wit some spice on the finish (coriander?, Fennel seed? Caraway?). The taste is an explosion of honey- enough to make this really be more of a Braggot in style, and more of the same spice on the nose. The honey is delicious- not just sweet, but very floral wildflower honey. Mouthfeel is surpisingly dry and refreshing. Quite drinkable."
"Pours a clear, bright ruby amber with virtually no head or lacing. Nice, subtle spicing on the nose. It seems there is some orangey spice in there -- maybe they used orange peel. The overall impression is one of sweet spiciness, kind of like a rich fruitcake. It's a good nose for the style. On the palate, brisk carbonation at first, then warm orangey spices and sweet malts. The palate is well balanced and not cringingly spiced. Mouthfeel is quite nice, with a thick body and plenty of carbonation to scrub the palate. Overall, this is an excellent winter warmer. Not as subtle as it could be, but not out of whack either. Warming and substantial, this is a very good interpretation of the style."
"A nice warmer for cold weather...I could learn to like this one..not over spiced but certainly the spice and hops rides above the malts in this one."
"Pours a clear copper color, a quick fizzy head, nice carbonation, not much lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, ginger, and honey. The taste follows the nose, quite different Winter Warmer than other's I've had, nice sweet/honey taste, clean finish. Light-Medium body. Very drinkable, would be fooled about the 7.5% ABV though, tasty. Would recommend at least once."
"This is a good winter warmer, that doesn't overdo the spices but rather, lets them stand as a compliment to the beer. A good winter warmer from a great brewer."
"Mouth is full and rich, sweet on the mid palate but ends dry. For a Chirstmas spiced beer (not my favorite style) this beer is highly drinkable and highly delicious."
"D: Not bad. I'm not usually one for the winter warmer style, but I could have a few of these and not complain. Good example of the style."
"Fore is spicy with again cinammon and other spice, ginger seems right. Has a smoothness to it in the mouthfeel I like, but is thin and a touch watery too. Its liquid christmas treats and Id like to try it mulled to be honest. Fruit cake, cookies, fig pudding....all in a glass."
"Drinkability: Not too bad but the vanilla makes it more difficult to consume."
"This is not one of my preferred Christmas beers."
"It definitely says holiday beer but I found it to have a little too much added flavor, kind of like a liquid holiday desert without all the sweetness. Far from being my favorite Great Lakes Brewing product."
"D: The spices are strong, good for a cold winter night (not the 50 degree nights we've been having thus far in December). I may even mull a bottle and see if the heat brings out more spices."
"On the whole it is totally appropriate to say this is a fine seasonal beer. Everyone should have at least one to celebrate the holiday. Whether enjoyed while putting up the tree, wrapping or opening presents or simply enjoying the festivities this is a must drink in December. Very well-done and mildly potent. Great job by Great Lakes!!"
"The drinkability is ok, The beer is nice but the lingering spice in the after taste hangs on too long. Prosit. MK"
"all in all though, still a very nice winter brew. the honey, nutmeg, hops, and pine flavors make a very nice combination."
"Eric"
"Drinkability - very good, but just over the upper limit of abv for good sessionability, so watch yourself when thinking about the next one after the next one."
"Not quite sure how I feel about this one. Burnt and bitter, with only a tiny hint of sweetness or spiciness. Overall product is not so delightful, nor drinkable. Guess I'll have to celebrate this special season and day with something else."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a brilliant orange with a nice fluffy head that leaves some lacing on the mug. Smell is of sweet honey with hints of ginger in there as well. Taste is very mild with a sweet malty honey and spice taste there is hardly any carbonation and the alcohol is very mild and almost non existant, very good offering from my brother shipped from the good ole city of Youngstown, Ohio, very good holiday offer from the good guys at Great Lakes."
"poured from 12 ounce bottle into pint glass. nice initial head then quickly faded, no lacing. warm colours throughout, moderate cabonation. sweet fruity aroma which translates into the taste. not a bad beer, but certainly not one of the better glbc's offering's. had a very good mouthfeel, was very appealing to me. moderate abv, so stay at home if you are going to drink more than a few."
"Not syrupy but not that crisp either. If there is a downfall for this brew it's just that it doesn't lend itself to all-night consuption. However, I would still try!"
"Overall: An outstanding brew from my favorite brewery. I look forward to this beer every year and it never disappoints! This year, replace your bourbon egg nog with a truly fantastic brew, Great Lakes Christmas Ale!"
"Drinkability/notes: Quite well-made, excellent, a wonderful holiday ale."
"a good mix of flavors and medium mouthfeel. Just a down right good beer! I will have this in the fridge for the holiday's"
"A medium body with creamy texture.A very good winter ale with a lot of holiday flavors,but not overdone,very drinkable and enjoyable. Give it a try."
"Only have a few bottles today, but a few cases of this will be making the holiday rounds. Happy Holidaze, great lakes!"
"Pours copper in color and clear with a small light cream colored head that fades back quickly. Aroma is honey and malty sweetness along with maraschino cherries, and a little alcohol in the aroma as well. Taste is like a sweet bread of some kind, a light dessert bread to have with coffee. There is more honey sweetness and cherry flavor along with a little of the cinnamon and spice flavor and a yeasty breadiness. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body, a somewhat sparkling carbonation is prickly on the tongue. Interesting flavors, fairly light and subtle, good beer."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with a 1/17/07 best-by date. Poured a beautiful reddish-copper color with a small white head. Little retention. Smells of toasted barley, some warm spices like clove or cinnamon. Tastes sweet toasted barley, hints of bread, caramel. Excellent aftertaste of the barley - that in particular travels well. The bread and spices come out more as the beer returns to room temperature. Mouthfeel is a nice balance of creaminess and light carbonation. Overall, another strong offering from Great Lakes, and one of my favorites in the Winter Warmer style."
"The beer poured a deep copper with an auburn hue. Little lacing with a small head. Smell is good with a prevailing cinnamon smell little ginger. The mouthfeel was excellent with a great full body. I really enjoyed the subtle flavors of this beer. It isn't very drinkable, I imagine after a couple the spices would become pretty abrasive. The only downside to this beer is the complexity, being a beer n00b it is hard to take it all in. Great Beer. This beer at 7.5% is pretty potent. Beware cravings of eating ginger bread cookies after drinking this beer."
"Upon being Served this beer at Molly Malones in Cincinnati I gaze at it. The beer is of a brownish red color with an almost tan head with slight carbonation present in the body. The aroma and taste went hand in hand. They both had a strong maltiness to it with an even stronger Ginger aroma and taste that seemed to over power everything. Even with the extremely strong ginger in it I could still make out some cinnimon and something that was reminded me of coriander. The mouthfeel was a medium body with carbonation dancing on the tounge. The drinkability was rather low, the beer did not leave me wanting another."
"WHITE CAP OF FINE BUBBLES DISSAPATING TO A THIN EVEN LAYER. CINNAMON, FLOWERY, TROPICAL FRUIT NOTES IN THE NOSE. TASTE REVEALS A VARIETY OF FRUIT LIKE APPLE, CRANBERRY, SLIGHT LEMON, AND SOME FLOWERY ROSE LIKE ESTERS. HOPS ARE LIGHT OFFERING SOME FAINT WHEAT, GRASSY CHARACTERS. MORE DARK FRUITS AND ALL-SPICE PICKS UP. BODY IS THIN WITH A CRISP, MEDIUM CARBONATED MOUTH. THE GULP LEAVES BEHIND A CREAMY SWIRL AND THE FINISH IS NICE WITH A SPICEY COATING IN THE MOUTH AND A LITTLE BISCUIT AFTERTASTE. A VERY FESTIVE AND WELL CRAFTED BREW WHICH I HAVE FOUND THAT NON-BEER DRINKERS WILL ENJOY."
"The bottle says it's best served before 1/22/07. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark copper color with a nice off-white head and good lacing. It smells like cinammon, ginger, pine/floral hops, nutmeg and honey. The flavor is spicy, tasting like it smells. There's also some sweet malt and caramel in the taste. The mouthfeel is medium/full and a bit chewy. Even with the 7.5% ABV, this is a pretty drinkable beer. It goes down pretty easy. Overall, I think this is a pretty good beer. I wish Great Lakes would make this all year long."
"Wow, this is an incredibly easy drinking Christmas winter warmer. Has lots of cinnamon flavors in it and some ginger as well. Pours an oft-red color with some head, not much, doesn't lace much either. Of course the one I had was way too cold. Very smooth and clean taste. Very potent, although it doesn't initially seem like it as the alcohol is barely detectable. I highly recommend this one!"
"Overall a nice and potent winter warmer. Would like to get my hands on some more."
"Best before 1/17/07.Tis not quite the Xmas season but its great to see the Winter Warmer/Holiday brews out and Iam glad to be able to get this locally,poured a lighter clear copper with a thin 1/2 finger white head left pretty quickly leaving no mark of lace behind.Honeyish esters really stand out in the nose along with some light roasted nut and a real leafy hop presence wich was nice with most beers of the style not showing enough hop presence this was a nice thing to see,the cinnamon and honey imparted in this beer show thru nicely upfront melding into a dryer leafy almost earthy like presence finishing with a sharp ginger-like note that lingers.Interesting I must say no way I would think this 7.5% alc a little light but man it goes down easy and it warms the inside a little,I like it its not overly sweet and has a hop presence to it."
"Taste was an average, middle of the road malt character that I certainly didn't expect from one of my favorite breweries. There is a beautiful rendevous of energy with each sip, yet it gives way to a lackluster finish, making one think of which other beer they get to try when this one is finished."
"Very drinable, much more so than many christmas brews which tend to over do it on the spice in my opinion. This a more elegant incarnation of the style to which I look forward to when the fall chill enters the air."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer, but I don't really like a beer that you can positively identify the spice additions. It is OK, but it reminds me more of a food than a beer. I am not going to pour it out, but it isn't one that I will be drinking again anytime soon. Once is enough for a while."
"Drinkability- I can't wait for this one every year. I try to buy a case to keep in the cellar for those special occasions when I want a flavored beer."
"Massive thanks to mattcrill for the sample!"
"Chestnut color. Aroma has a bit of spice from the hops, grape vines, tree brances and caramel and biscuit like malt. Quite honestly, there isnt much there in the aroma. The flavor is mild, with hints of caramel, cream corn, fruit and roast. This is ok."
"The first thing that struck me was the ginger aroma--not overwhelming, but just present and pleasant. Hints of the ginger and some cinnamon cross the tongue, but honey lingers. The spices are not too overpowering like many brewers end up with. Balanced and quaffable, not a case buy, but worth a six."
"7.5% alcohol? Bring it (especially for this price). This is a marvelous beer for drinking anytime the temperature is below, say, 50 degrees. I'll look forward to this from here on out. I can put back a few in a sitting, it just warms me up inside. My favorite seasonal and my favorite red ale; it probably works its way into my top 5 all around favorites too. Probably wouldn't drink too much outside the fall/winter though."
"Copper brown. Yes a winter warmer, the cinammon, the nutmeg, cocoa. Pleasant, some hops and appropriate carbonation. A nice drink, though not exceptional. A bit sweet maltiness with bitterness in the finish. Pleasant spicy aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel."
"Best before 2/14/06"
"Drinkability- This one is a winner. I can see drinking lots of these if they were available here. Another good cold weather beer, even though the abv isn't huge. I'm liking this one lots."
"Poured from the bottle, this is a clear coppery color, with a small white head and minimal lacing. The smell is of malt with cinnamon. The taste is malty with cinnamon and a hint of nutmeg. The spices do not overwhelm the taste of the beer. The mouthfeel is good, but seems a bit thin for a winter ale. This is a nice tasting beer, but one in a session would be enough for me."
"cheers..."
"My 300th review. Cheers! Great Lakes Christmas Ale pours into the glass a clear copper color. Some streaming bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Thick creamy off-white head that holds together rather well. Aroma of ginger, nutmeg, maybe even cinnamon. Biscuity malt flavor, with a hint of caramel. Honey sweetness. Spices kick in near the end, again ginger, nutmeg. Not very bitter, spices are done pretty well here. Slight floral/citrusy hop flavor. Medium body, low carbonation. Very enjoyable. Another wonderful brew from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability: I'm still not a huge fan of spiced beers, and this one doesn't convert me. However, for what it is, I appreaciate it a great deal. This will be my last until next Christmas."
"Overall: I picked up all the Great Lakes I could on my last swing through Kentucky, and I still haven't had one that was less than fantastic. Good beers, and this one is an especially subtly-done winter warmer."
"On tap and quaffed at Bado's in the Iron City on boxing day. I have had this beer a number of times before, and it has always been at the top of my christmas ale list. The pints tonight absolutely knocked my socks off as well as knocked me on my a--. Very clean lines at this here establishment and the keg seemed very fresh as well so ratings are given as such. Apearance absolutley beautiful reddish mahagony color with good billowy head and eferesence. wonderful notes of the usual spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, etc but this beer was extremely well balanced with great harmony of flavors- excellent body and high, high drinkability. Great Lakes has always been one of the top notch midwestern brewers; these pints confirmed their rep in my mind and palate as well as reiniforced my view of this beer as the creme of their rotation. Drink it while you can and happy holidays."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"A medium to full bodied amber ale-like beer with lots of flavors added. Malty without feeling heavy or cloying. A well-woven cherry flavor and aroma melds into the malts. Lightly hopped for balance but little for flavor or aroma, just enough for an extra layer of flavors. Spicy with nutmeg, cinemon, and ginger; without the granular texture that is usually present in bottle conditioned beers. Very smooth and slick to the mouth. Warmingly alcoholic toward the end. Alcohols and cherry flavor resembles cough drops or Vicks 44, but lightly noticed. Lots of peach flavors follow through in the aftertaste. A real good offering by Great Lakes."
"Another decent brew from Great Lakes Brewing. I would probably have another of these but not my favorite of this style."
"Notes: It was nice to be able to get this on tap at the Winking Lizard in Akron Ohio. A great brew."
"The mouthfeel is great, nice body and great carbonation. Excellently done. Drinkability is great too. I have a couple other beers to drink tonight, but I'd love to trade them in for more of these. Great Offering. Get it while you can!"
"The mouthfeel of this beer is good. It seems to suit the style of the beer. The carbonation in this beer is higher than what you might find in a stout, porter or other beer that is largely malt influenced, but compliments the beer quite nicely. This beer is easy enough to drink, but definitely something that you wouldn't want to drink too fast. This beer is one of those, in my opinion, that you can only drink a certain number of in one sitting before you start to get sick of it. The malty character just becomes too much to handle. However I really like this beer and can see myself buying more in the future."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks Mark G for bringing it back for me. Dated as enjoy by Jan 31 06."
"Poured a wonderful ruby red color with a nice head of white sticky foam. The aroma to me was like a lot Christmas, some pine, spices and hops in the background. Up front in the taste were spices like nutmeg and cinnamon, and then after all those spices a strong hoppy citrus flavor emerged. A strong hop aftertaste lingered on for a while after that. This goes down nice and smooth, but be careful this beer hides it alcohol content very well. I learned that the hard way. This was a nice Winter Warmer and would also make for a nice Christmas Day drink."
"minimal bitterness. tasty, ya know. glbc does it right"
" Pours clear ruby with a creamy white 2"" temporary head. No yeast sediments at the bottom of the bottle labeled best by Jan 24, 2006. Spicy aroma is inviting. The full body you expect in Great Lakes brews. I generally like ginger and honey but a little nutmeg and cinnamin go a long way. Favors suffer from a bitter finish of lingering spices and vienna malts that really turned me off this beer. I think the overall effect of the spices and malts is very unbalanced. Drinkability suffers as the result. Alcohol is well hidden. I still recommend trying it. Let your taste buds decide - Merry Christmas to all and to all a well crafted brew."
"Moderate to light mouth, seems to have the right amount of carbonation. A very drinkable Xmas brew."
"D - For festivites and dealing with families this an all day beer. I enjoy it."
"Deep coppery brew with just a little of rising bubbles helping to keep the offwhite head sticking around. Cinnamon rolls and butter and honey and some other spices I can't quite make out make a potent smell. Delicate malts under lots of cinnamon and spice and everythng nice. Butter and sweet crytsal/candy-like malt. A bit too sweet for me. Not likely to grab this again, but if offered on Christmas, I'd definitely have another."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. I wish I had more."
"I'd only have a couple of these at a time. I could see this as a great beer to wrap up your Thanksgiving or Christmas meal. All in all, a unique, above-average winter seasonal with a great smell, cinnanninnanim."
"Slàinte!"
"Pours golden with a hint of orange color. Head quickly goes into a decent lace. Light spice/honey flavor with lots of carbonation. Hoppy, with a bit of a bite at the finish. I'm not a huge fan of the bitter edge in some Ale , but this was better than expected. Give it a try."
"D- This beer has a good base beer but the cinnamon and ginger are not good spices to pair. Even when the spices are good quality they have a chemical taste and smell to them."
"Oh, and you can't taste the alcohol in this one at all. Well built."
"Conclusion: A lightly spiced, easy drinking, fairly unremarkable holiday beer that hides its alcohol well."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear bright copper color with a decent creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Spicy ginger bread cookie aromas, starts with spicy cinnamon and ginger flavors with honey in the end. Medium bodied with smooth mouthfeel, finishes very dry. It is hard to believe this is 7.5 %."
"One of my favorite seasonals and one that makes me happy to live in Ohio. Another real treat from the professionals at Great Lakes. Quality stuff."
"Cheers!!"
"Translucent, dark amber color. A thin head which leaves minimal lacing due to the oily consistency of this brew. Subtle aromas of ginger and honey.. Sweet honey flavor combined with spices. Somewhat clumsy..seems like ingredients are just thrown together, if that makes any sense. I'm not sure I agree with the combination of honey and spices like this..just seems like they mixed a honey beer and a spicy beer together by accident. I couldn't really pick up individual flavors, so it left me with a spicy honey aftertaste. Medium bodied, oily mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable, but this holiday offering from GL didn't really impress me all that much. I'll look forward to Anchor OSA for my spicy holiday fix."
"Pours a copper hue, very clear. A creamy off white head of two fingers has excellent retention, and leaves some nice patchy lacing. Some noble hops and pale malt in the nose, but mostly ginger, cinnamon, annd some indistinct holiday spices. The sweet toasted malt flavor melds ginger and faint pine into the taste, and the bittering hops cleanse the palate leaving a dry aftertaste, with some residual honey. Appropriatly spiced, but leans towards the bitter side. The spice and pine flavors become cloying, even with good carbonation and a medium body. A harsh finish detracts greatly from the drinkability."
"This is a rather appropriate ale for the winter months. There is a very clear but dark auburn color and very little head develops. The alcohol is rather prevalent but it is hidden to a degree by the noticeable smell of spices, which gives the ale both a distinct smell and taste. Although this is darker ale, temperature is very important in this case. A little colder is better for this gem of Great Lakes."
"This is a very drinkable beverage and I highly recommend it. It isn't too sharply spiced as some, but it still has that holiday flavor. Try it!"
"Wow. Pours a deep orange color. Slightly decent head and retention here. Aroma is spicy, perhaps cloves, perhaps ginger? Taste is great. Malts, fruits, and spice playing well together. Mouthfeel is thick. I can see how this could warm you up on a cold winter's day. The alcohol is well hidden in this beer as well."
"Pours a very nice, crystal clear amber, with suspendies, but not cloudy. Still smells of cinnamon and spices, nutmeg, but much more subdued than a fresh bottle. The taste is equally subdued, in my opinion to the better. Still spicy, gingerbread cookie spices, christmas cookie spices, cinnamon and nutmeg, ginger. Easier on the toungue as well, smoother, and the hops come out, they were a little hidden in fresher bottles. I think it is easier to drink with a little maturity. Much smoother, a little less burn from the spices. Overall a very nice beer, even though the last thing I need to be in July is 'warmed!'"
"Christmas in July anyone? I went to a cash bar event near Cleveland last night and this one the only Great Lakes offering. Still much better than any other option there and only $2.50 a bottle. Nice cinnamon and spices, with hints of alcohol. Very easy to drink three last night. Would be a great winter welcome in six months. Even in July, it wasn't a bad choice."
"This beer has been sitting in my refrigerator for almost 2 months. I've been reticent to open it, since I noticed the expiration date was a year and a half ago. It would be unfair to review a beer in such a condition. However, my curiosity finally got the best of me, and my fears proved unfounded. This beer poured out a clear orange, with plenty of suspended floaties. The aroma is spicy, mainly ginger, but also some cinnamon. Sweet honey and malt flavor, along with the aforementioned spices. Thankfully, this beer avoids the trap of the cloying spiciness of too many winter warmers. More drinkable than most beers of the style. I am suprised to read that the abv is 7.5%. I would have guessed about 5.5%. Perhaps the high alcohol helped preserve this beer so long past the expiration date, which is a good thing, for now I feel justifed writing this review."
"Bottle: Poured a light ruby color ale with a medium light brown foamy head with a quite excellent retention. Aroma of light spices, honey with some bitter hops. Taste is lighter then expected with the honey being immediately recognizable. Bitter taste at the end is also quite enjoyable. I would have hope for a bit more malt and more character for a Christmas special type beer."
"Bottle has a date of Dec. 30, 2004. I'm not sure if that was when it was brewed or if it is best before that date. Seems a little early if that is the case. I wouldn't really bother cellaring this beer, but then who knows? Anyway, pours a reddish copper color with a nice beige head, which quickly dissipated. Has a pretty strong ginger and cinnamon smell and quite a spicy taste followed by honey, and a little bitter snap aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. Hmm, now the hard part. I'm not big into spiced beers though I am slowly acquiring a taste for things like coriander or even ginger in my beer. Pretty strong so I can't see drinking lots of these. I just wish it had a slightly bigger hop and malt presence to balance the honey and spices."
"Orangey copper color with an oatmeal colored head that rises up to an inch high and then falls to a fine cap. Aroma is rich and inviting, of biscuity malt, sweet fruit and some cinnamon spice. Full and creamy mouthfeel, almost chewy. Pungent, spciy flavor of sweet malt and spice, cinnamon and a bit of clove and nutmeg, and a bit of spruce riding beneath. Hop presence is understated, nearly all in the finish and aftertaste. ABV is deceptively smooth."
"Mouthfeel is medium, smooth but not real heavy. No trace of alcohol in the taste despite the ABV, very soft on the palate, very drinkable. An excellent pale winter ale, one I would drink seasonally if I could. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this bottle."
"Pours out a slightly cloudy orange with reddish hues and a quickly developing off white tall head. Scattered lace was left around the glass as this was drank. Aroma was very nice with cherries, other fruits, plenty of spice and warmth. There was a definite sweetness and also a nice resemblance to spiced cider. Taste was a bit of sweet honey of fruits. Plenty of spice here but it comes off a bit too sweet overall. Medium sticky mouthfeel that brings a bit of warmth with it. Good drinkability as well. I could have a few of these in a row. Nice winter sipper. Thanks goes to clvand0 for the bottle."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"*This review is proof that sometimes a bar is not the best atmosphere to be taking notes. 95% of my on-tap reviews are from growlers consumed in the privacy of my apartment."
"Another success by the Great Lakes Brewing Company!"
"i did not taste the honey or smell it but its on the label."
"Very nice."
"My brother in law Jason brought this down from Cleveland the other day and I was very happy he did. Deep orange-amber with a pleasent crown after pouring it into my new snifter (Christmas present). Smelled all spice, tangy fruit, and a floral hop aroma with added cinnamon and nutmeg. Cinnamon and malt to start, clove, caramel in the finish. Malty with a spicey bite near the end but they melted fantastically. One of my favorites from GLBC but hell, most of their selections are."
"Yum. This is a beer to drink with some Christmas cookies and presents. The beer pours a crystal clear, amber orange with a beautiful foamy white head. The overriding taste here is gingerbread. This tastes more like a beer flavored gingerbread cookie than the other way around. But it's oh so good, not too sweet, just a little hop kick to balance it out. I'll be sorry when the holidays are over and I can't get these any more, better stock up. Only downside is the aroma, just not much there. But the taste more than makes up for it."
"This beer came a nice rubyed folden color with a finger of head that slowly receded from the beer. The nose was slightly cherry, with caramel and spices dancing around in the background. The flavor was pretty full on the spices, with the caramel playing more of a background role in this one. There were hints of a cherry flavor in there as well, but very far in the background. The feel was just shy of moderate. Overall this was a nice beer. I'm not a big fan of the winter warmers with spices added, but this was a solid beer."
"Haven't had a chance to have my fair share of Christmas brews yet, but I have to believe that this one will be hard to top."
"Very smooth and drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Nicely complex, challenging at times, and enjoyable from start to finish. A very nice winter warmer, with an incredibly silky and playful mouthfeel. Thanks to orbitalr0x for this Great Lakes brew."
"Nice, nice beer from GLB. I will buy it again before they are gone till next year."
"This beer poured a clear amber/honey color with a fluffy off white head. The smell was fantastic. Sweet malts and spice. Reminds of the spice blend for pumpkin pies. The taste is a little on the sweet side. The spice flavor is not too involved and is balanced with enough hops to round it all out into an good tasting drinkable brew. The mouthfeel was pretty good. Enough carbonation, slightly thick and syrupy but not too bad. Well worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is nearly perfect, smooth and creamy with good body. Easy to drink and nice on a cold night. This is a great holiday brew and I recommend to anyone looking for something different!"
"Very drinkable. Dangerous."
"Another winner from GLBC."
"There are definitely better xmas brews out there."
"A great winter warmer brew. I will be drinking a lot of this brew during the winter."
"Poured from a standard bottle, its a nice light reddish colour with generous whitish head. It smells of malt and spice. The taste is richly malty as well, with some spicy notes. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, just slides down your throat. I give this beer a high drinkability score, easily a beer you could sit down with when its cold and play poker. Excellent beer, very recommended."
"A really nice, obscure christmas ale, and at $3 a pint at Bob's, I'll be enjoying this one again."
"I had this at the Brewery's Pub from a small batch made for July, I was told that they may tweak it a bit for this x-mas (Color was one thing they mentioned)."
"Like the bottled version, this is nice in that it's not too overwhelming. The spices play second fiddle to the beer itself while accentuating the malts and hops. A good representative of the style."
"cheers to zap and bighuge for getting this sensational seasonal into my hands!"
"Mouthfeel definitely has some body, while the drinkability is quite good, a nice winter seasonal by Great Lakes."
"Purchased in Dayton, Ohio in November, enjoyed today. Hint of spices originally, but when poured they were explosive. Good name, the smell did remind me of Christmas-time. I was most stuned by the crystal clear copper color, quite magnificant. Beer was extremely balanced. My wife thought it to be a bit too ""complex"" for her liking. Overall a great beer, which I will get again."
"Drinkability - As it warms, the alcohol presence comes out more, but it can be difficult to have any left by the time it gets to room temperature! A wonderful beer for relaxing with in the evening."
"Pours a clear copper in color with a creamy light tan head. Spicy nose consists of ginger, honey, spices and malt. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a touch of crispness to it. Spices are detected in the flavor also. Cinnamon, ginger and honey all combine for a sweet malty front. At times I wish the honey was reduced a bit because it tends to add a bit of an off flavor. Hopping seems minimal. Alcohol can be detected in the finish. This is a very good Christmas spiced ale. Comparable in flavor to Lakefront's Holiday Spice, which is one of my favorites."
"A belated Merry Xmas to BigHuge for the Great Lakes brews. Cheers!"
" - Dave Berman (off of Silver Jew's The Natural Bridge)"
"I like this Christmas Ale but I wouldn't want to down several in one sitting."
"Drinkability: Very High. While I miss the absolute joy that was the tap version, this is an exceptional beer, IMHO. I bought a sixer of these and have not one regret when I think about the other five waiting for me. Highly recommended if you can find it."
"I finally got ahold of a couple of these for some of the GLBC limited offerings I have to search for out of town. Anyway, I'll gladly make thisone a yuletide tradition. It pours a burgundy, if not a dark cranberry color with a smaller than expected off-white head. The heads fades to a thin film although the carbonation is mild (no fizz) on this full bodied beer. Lace dose manage to dress the glass nicely. The aroma is spice and ginger. The taste is also packed with ginger, spice, cinnamon, caramel malt while backed by a slight alcohol hop. The 7.5abv. dose a nice winter warming job while not overpowering the mouth. A great beer with all or most holiday eat treats."
"A rush of sweetness, followed by subtle spicing of ginger & cinnamon. A hint of hops dries it out just enough to keep it from becoming cloying. Didn't really pick up on the honey, but its still quite tasty. Brisk carbonation, medium/full bodied, & somewhat creamy. A nicely done beer just for the holidays."
"Great Lakes Christmas Ale is my first beer from the best brewery in my home state of Ohio and my former residence (3 years) of Cleveland. I'm very impressed. I expected a good, solid Christmas beer and those expectations were met and exceeded by a long shot. I only got a single this year, but you can bet that I'll be getting more of this fine seasonal during my future trips home for the holidays. I would have no trouble at all drinking Christmas Ale year-round."
"Taste has a really nice balance of sweet cinnamon, mild to light malt and a slightly bitter finish. Feels very dry in the mouth, but nice and spicy."
"Good."
"This beer pours with a great light tan head, settling over clear light amber liquid. Light delicate spice in the nose, clean-smelling & not too heavy on malt flavors. The taste had hints of slight phenols with some cinnamon and fruit flavors followed by decent hop bitters. Finishes up dry with a bitter end. A decent Xmas beer, thanks to CRJMellor for the bottle."
"Though I certainly appreciate a good, spiced Christmas Ale, this seemed a little bit over the top. Maybe I was drinking it at a time I'd have preferred a more conventional beer rather than with chestnuts roasting on an open fire, but it just seemed out of place."
"Mouthfeel is dry."
"As a caveat, I don't think I'd age this too much longer, as some peeks of oxidation are making themselves known. It seems about as good as it will get now, and will probably begin to fall apart after 1 year. Maybe not, though."
"This one poured a light copper color with a small light tan head. The smell is strong in alcohol and spices. The taste is dominated by spices. The one spice that really comes out is ginger. Lots and lots of ginger. More ginger than I can handle. Tastes like gingersnaps. Get the point. Some honey flavor from the malts and an alcoholic kick in the end round out this beer. I can see how some people would love it but it's not my cup of tea."
"Appearance: Copper amber with a very nice caramel tone thicket of head, lacing forms a thck collar that continues to leave intersipping full rings. Aroma: Malty slightly toasted nuts but the spicing steals the show very festive, with cinnamon and tones of nutmeg some slightly floral hopping going on as well a bit one sided but who cares Great Lakes can do no wrong. Taste: Fluffy layer of creaminess blended with the spicy tones of ginger and a rich honey finish, and alcohol is very well hidden didn't know that this one was 7.5 % they are usually pretty conservative with their alcohol level at the GLBC, but hey 'tis the season, right? Mouthfeel: Medium body a bit sticky but not cloying in any way smooth mild carbonation, can't complain. Drinkability: On draft much more drinkable but the bottle just seems to concentrate the cinnamon and ginger spices just a bit much one though is a good experience to be had go out and find some while the Christmas beers are still here."
"Solid spiced beer and perfect for the season. Was a pretty standard amber color with a styrofoam white head. Smell was a 50/50 split between malts and spices. Malts were biscuity and there was a small hint of alcohol that was masked by nice clean notes of cinnamon. Taste was full-bodied with the ginger playing a bigger role complementing the juicy malts. Mouthfeel was good as well. Just an all around solid beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a clear medium red color with one finger of head. There is just a tiny bit of lacing. The smell is dominant with cinammon, but also has hints of nutmeg and cherry to it. The taste has lots of cinammon and honey sweetness that is just a tad cloying. A good bite of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is just a little light for this style. The drinkability is very very good though for a 7.5% brew. Enjoyable as a dessert beer, and I might even try mulling it."
"This is even more enjoyable on tap! Better balance, smoother mouthfeel, and just oiverall better flavor (or perhaps it's just this year's edition.) On tap at Sapphire's in WashCo."
"Nice dark copper copper with a great light tan head that clings to the sides of the glass leaving excellent lacing. It smells of cinnamon and ginger, with hints of all spice. The tastes were similar with roasted barley and a little sweetness. The spiceyness or the higher alcohol content were not overpowering. I really like this one and look forward to it every year."
"Deep ruby color with a fluffy head. Laces nicely down the glass while the head retention is outstanding. Nose is a blend of Christmas with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger and perhaps some additional spices. Taste features more of the same, with the main emphasis on cinnamon and allspice with mild traces of honey. As the beer reaches room temperature, a malty profile presents itself, keeping this winter warmer in balance. Mouthfeel is quite clean with active bubbles creating a tingling sensation. This beer drinks very well, but due to the spiciness it possesses (not to mention the abv), I would reserve this one for a nightcap by the fire, with a slice of pumpkin cheesecake, or something similar. A really nice holiday ale with a great deal of character."
"Pours out golden copper with a creamy head. Smells like Christmas in a glass, hence the name. All warming aromas of honey, cinnamon, and ginger. The taste adds on to the aroma with malty tones and a slight warming from the ABV. I think I know what will accompany my turkey this Thanksgiving."
"Quite an attractive pour-golden caramel set beneath a mound of off white head that settles down easily yet never vanishes. Wonderful seasonal quality to the nose with all the spices chiming in-cinnamon and nutmeg first then a tease of ginger enveloped in sweet malt. In the mouth the beer comes off very aggresive in the way of alcohol. The cinnamon is a tad too aggresive as well, and comes off as overtly hot/spicy. The finish is of those red cinnamon balls your Grandmother used to pawn of on you when you were young. This beer tastes as if it might be an Elliot Ness in an all spiced up holiday package. A decent holiday treat from a great brewery. This would go well with some bread pudding perhaps."
"It's medium bodied and what I liked is that it didn't overpower me with the cinnamon/spicey winter beer thing. Good job"
"Kudos to fellow BA PhantomVoDoo for trading some of this to me."
"Mmm mmm good. Surprisingly on tap in April, this seasonal brew still had plenty of snap and talked back with some serious gusto. The look is great with a dark red amber hue, adequate head retention and some fair lacing. Lots of spice in the nose and taste, though to be honest, the flavors are all quite subtle and understated. The alcohol doesn't show through, perhaps because of the spice overlay, and this is very drinkable, but for the high ABV. GLBC just keeps on keeping on."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy slightly dark brownish red color with a moderate tan head. The mouthfeel is moderate. The smell is spice mostly ginger and cinnamon. The taste is strong ginger and spice in front with mild malty cinnamony finish. A good spicy holiday season ale with a very deceptive alcohol content."
"(source: PremierGourmet; Buffalo, NY)"
"*.I rate the drinkability high for a seasonal sipping beer....not for as if you'd want to drink 12 of these in a sitting...rather if you gave me my choice of several holiday beers I'd rather drink this one than most.."
"Not dark enough for mahogany, the red isn't backed up enough by the brown for that. The head is wimpy. The aroma reminded me of black cherries, sweet but without the sourness. Nice but really big malt along with the mild spicing makes it seem a bit cake-like. The black cherries carry through into the flavor. Nice beer but not outstanding."
"The flavor offers a very nice blend of softly sweet malt with a touch of honey and chocolate, and mild spice (cinnamon, ginger). It finishes semi-dry with a lingering sweet malt, some clear cinnamon flavor, and a drying spiciness. The alcohol is almost completely hidden! Very well-balanced with just enough spice to keep it interesting throughout the glass, but not overwhelm the palate. Definitely a seasonal to look forward to!"
"I'd love to see what they could do with a Barleywine, Imperial Stout or IPA."
"Found on draught at the Grid Iron Brewpub. As with most beers this has more character from the tap. Poured a rich dark orange/red with a foamy light beige head. Pleasantly spiced aroma. Flavor of spices (ginger and cinnamon) with some malt made it a nice winter warmer. Slight hops finish. Good to have at this time of year."
"Brown glass bottle with hard to read dating, but looks like it says enjoy by 15 FEB 03. Pours a slightly hazy reddish copper with a light tan head. Aroma is faint, but I detect malt and honey. Flavors explode from several directions. Big malt flavor from one, honey and cinnamon from another. Well balanced, flavor is slightly sweet. Finishes very well except for one aftertaste I don't like that creeps in and lingers. Not sure, but it seems to be an alcohol aftertaste. Of course the solution to this is simply to take another drink because up to that point this beer is great. Another very good Great Lakes."
"This beer poured a reddish amber color and formed an amazing off white foamy head that left some circular lace as it subsided. It had an aroma of malt and cinammon. The flavor was of malt, cinammon and touch of ginger. A good beer from Great Lakes, but a bit pricey."
"Pours a copper color with a decent orangish white head. Notes of cinnamon on the smell. Malty spicy taste. A real solid beer, maybe a little too much cinnamon, but by no means bad. A good interpretation of the style. Another good reason to live in Ohio."
