It manages to be sweet but not sticky with some toast and toffee to go along with a mild floral hop bitterness. It has some sherry notes usually found in a nice, aged barleywine. I like how it straddles the line between sweet and toasty, never really leaning one way or the other. Fun beer, Id put at least a few of these away each year come wintertime.

Anyway, on to the beer... great color and smell... I couldn't wait to jump right in. Lots of malt and hops with a great full bodied caramel flavor. The first one went down so easily, I hardly remembered the transition into the second!

Jolly Roger is a red-brown brew with light-to-average retention of its off-white head. The retention is impressive considering the higher alcohol content. There is a spicy hop aroma and the taste is complex with caramel, herbal, and slightly medicinal tastes as well as some raisiny, toasty flavor with a toffee note. There is a medium-long finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and sharpy carbonated. The 8% alcohol content is detectable as warmth. A good drinkable winter warmer.","xoqx","Nov 01, 2006"

The ample alcohol makes this one you'll probably want to drink in moderation, but overall a very tasty brew. I'll have to explore more of this brewery's offerings next time I'm in Seattle.","ElGordo","Jan 20, 2006"
3.85,1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4" tan head over the almost clear orangey amber brew. Head is quickly down to a swirly layer of itty bitty bubbles, and lacing is average. Aroma is a bit syrupy, with piney hop notes. Taste is intense upfront, with everything coming at once. The sweetness and hops are both right there, and the rest of the experience is the tsunami roiling and the receding. Mouthfeel is nice once things settle down, and drinkability is quite good for the style and the abv. A winter warmer I wouldn't mind wintering with.","ppoitras","Jan 10, 2006"

Bought a six-pack of this the other day after trying one bottle a week ago. It saddens me to learn of this beer so soon to the end of its run. Definitely gives me something to look forward to next winter.","waldowin","Dec 26, 2005"

4.01,5.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Lovely turbid pour yeilding an amber with a slight tan head. The smell is muted like I am smelling a candle in the next room. Some fruit esters and sweet maltiness with lingering hop characters. The taste is very good but I am sure different than fresh. The hop presence is grassy but most only bittering. The malt dominates and that is alright because this tastes somewhat like belgian yeast was put to work. Fruity cherry and currants delicately hide around the corner while a yeast flavor hangs out with the malt like brown sugar. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable wish I had plenty fresh and aged.","Higravity","Dec 20, 2005"

4.35,14.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,5,5,"Pours a deep coppery amber with absolute minimal head. Aroma is none too light on its feet, but hints at supreme maltiness. Upfront there's a few fruity esters then lots of malty bready brown sugar sweetness, though by no means overkill, just enough. Intermixed is lots more fruitiness, definite cherries, banana and spice. I won't hazard a guess as to which. Just enough hops to balance. It's very full and creamy in the mouth, with medium low carbonation. Runs all around the palate well after swallowing. Drinks like a beauty. Simply marvelous.","numenor1","Dec 07, 2005"
4.13,8.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Semi-sticky and cloying with malty sweet action and silky smoothness. Body is mediumish with a light carbonation that tends to build slightly into the finish. Nice little warming hints gradually gain hold as you go. A nice beer; perfect for helping warm up the winter.","tavernjef","Nov 28, 2005"
2.52,-33.7,4,2,2.5,4,2,"I really couldn't finish this one. A little diacetyl can add a hint of richness or depth, but too much, and it stops tasting like beer and instead is like liquid popcorn.","czechsaaz","Nov 15, 2005"
4.27,12.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark red-brown, a perfect color for late autumn early winter. Especially since it seems extra cold this Seattle winter. I don't even need to try--- I can smell rich diacetyl and caramel, with some fruit lurking just beneath the surface. I never would have said it the first time I tried this, but all I can think of is an English ESB on steroids, which to me is a good thing as I love English beers. The taste is more caramel with hints of diacetyl and muted fruit, almost a pear taste. Mouthfeel is every bit as great as a beer straight from London! If you impulsively grabbed a sixer of this, you won't be sad that after drinking one, you'll still have 5 more to go. This beer is defintely a winner. Thank you Maritime for being creative in your brewing and giving me something to think about!","TheBungyo","Apr 29, 2005"

A big Thank You to the right honorable RoyalT for this growler and the two that preceded it.

3.73,-1.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Sugar cookie dough, bubblegum. Boiled collards and dandelion greens. Chewy. Lots of malt liquor -- like cooking greens in a malt broth. Burnt sugar cookies, and spice nodules. It's like, ping-ping-ping on the spice jar lids.","gbontrag","Mar 08, 2005"

Taste is big and malty sweet yet perfectly balanced with citrusy hops. Nice syurpy body yet quite drinkable especially for the abv.","zacharius","Jun 24, 2004"
3.18,-16.3,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a pune juice color with dark streaks, the head was tan and delicious looking, smell was of deep roasted oak and nuts, metallic hint, a ground almost grassy hint, the taste just didn't seem right, I might have to give this one another try, almost a burnt crisp sweetness, a slight hop was out of place dont' like hints of citrus in my winter warmer, thick bodied like syrup, could only handle one of these in a sitting.","beertaster13","Beers"

Nose is malt, caramel,  and the aroma of the Cascade and Chinook hops are also present. Front is malt sweet, the middle moderate, the finish has a  hefty hop spicy bite, the carbonation pleasant, dryish, along with the high ABV, makes for a nice "Winter Warmer.","Gusler","0"
