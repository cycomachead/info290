3.47,-1.4,5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dundee Festive Ale is a very clear, sparkling, amber ale with a huge, pillowy, off white head. It leaves a bunch of festive lacing on the glass. It has just a very slight whiff of soft malt and medicinal herbs. The soft, creamy medium body has a dry, slightly silty finish. There's some fruity malt that's a touch sweet, a little bit of spice and a touch of bitterness. Everything's pretty subdued. It almost seems a little salty. That reminds me of Genny Bock. It's not really exciting, but it goes down just fine.","yesyouam","Jan 17, 2012"

3.57,1.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Out of a bottle this Winter Warmer was a hazy amber color with one finger of tan head that had some reddish highlights to it. As I consumed the beer the head retained itself at first but eventually disappeared entirely. However, the lacing was in sliding patches while it lasted. The aroma was of caramel malt, rye, spices, dark fruit, some alcohol, wood and a little must. The flavors were similar, starting with the caramel malt note in then went into the more woody elements accentuated by the spices followed by the bitterness of a slightly-over-the-hill beer. Admittedly, though well cared for, this brew four months ago would have been better. It was malty at first, then dry and earthy and that was about it. The body was medium, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation fine.","thekevlarkid","Jun 22, 2010"

Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style and there is a bit too much of a burnt spice flavor for my liking. Still, better than I thought it would be and there is surprisingly not a whole lot of oxidized malt in here.","twiggamortis420","Apr 02, 2010"

3.18,-9.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a pint glass beer was a medium brown in color with a small head and very light lacing. Smell was rather weak from what i was expecting with only a hint of caramel and nutmeg. Taste wasn't bad but not as pronounced in the spice dept. as advertised. This seemed a little weak and maybe a bit flat to me. Dry finish with a little lingering nutmeg aftertaste. Mouthfeel was light with low carb bite. Drinkability was not a problem for me with the 6.2 abv barely noticeable. Not bad overall but pretty much a ho-hum beer in my eyes. I picked up a six tonite on a whim for $4.99 so what the heck? I don't see myself beating a path to the store for more but not bad for dundee. Buying this from the local martins grocery store probably didn't help this beer any what with the way they store and display their offerings.","kalkavekkian","Feb 10, 2010"
3.15,-10.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Drinkability: Not one I'll be revisiting. For me, it comes up as far too thin and lacking for a wintertime ale or even for a beer with the word ""festive"" in the title.","ChainGangGuy","Feb 07, 2010"

Nose and flavors consist of toasted grains, bread, mild notes of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and citrus (mainly orange), light caramel sweetness, a bit of spiciness on the tongue, candied apples. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Lightly spiced and uncomplicated. Thanks again Tim.","ClockworkOrange","Jan 31, 2010"
3.46,-1.7,4,3,3.5,3,4,"I have had the Dundee products before and felt that they have done well with a few of their offerings so I saw this at my local beer store, they where just unloading cases of it at 2.99 a 6 pack or 10 for a case. Decided to just get a 6 pack and give it a try as some of the holiday beers I feel are over spiced. This one poured to a dark amber color with a thick head that while being off white seemed to have some of the amber color in it. The aroma was fair to say the least, the spice was there but was not over the top and there was a nice malt presence that seemed to give a slight nutty caramel like scent. The spice was nutmeg, with a bit of cinnamon. The flavors where also quite good, spice was there but again not over the top. The flavors give a slight impression of a brown ale, which seems to be a great base, caramel with a slight chocolate taste. Cinnamon is tame, which is a good thing while I think the nutmeg stands out a bit. Overall, a pretty easy drinking brew. In hind site I wish I had picked up the case, as the beer is pretty good, especially for the price.","Stimack","Jan 28, 2010"

A decent malt backbone took me by surprise, I had been of the impression that Dundee was clearly incapable of good malting up till now. This is pretty heavily spiced as well and I am glad that it is. Without going overboard this is a pretty nice WW. Taste like pepper nuts, a German cookie that I don't normally like all that much, but here it's appealing to my pallet. I do pick up on the orange and citrus notes more than in the nose. A very soft and silky body gives this offering a nudge beyond average.

Hints of some spices in the background, present in the prefect quantity. Any hops are barely noticeable. Overall, a smooth and full-bodied beer. The aftertaste is mostly the spice.

Good amber/copper pour with a monster head that doesn't leave. Decent lacing and ample carbonation. Bitter scent with a solid malt nose and a touch of different spices, needs to be more aromatic. Filling brew and somewhat thick, although the finish has an empty bitterness. Semi-rich malty base with hints of many spices. Cinnamon, nutmeg and perhaps a touch of ginger seem to stand out. A bit of honey is present. For what it's worth I was impressed by this offering considering most of this brewer's products tend to be rather bland. The easiness with the blend of spices really stands out.","kinger","Nov 10, 2008"

Almost like a bitter orange peel type flavor/smell. It's bittersweet and thick. Leaves a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Some alcohol warmth is there... not much. Not bad.

Start has a big malt sweetness; touch of bittersweet spices, top is light to medium in feel.

Still, its not totally undrinkable, I certainly didnt have too hard a time sucking this one back.

It has an extremely dry flavor that goes down slow and finishes dry and earthy. I guess the spices are cinnamon and clove, but I'm not sure. It's quite peppery. The mouthfeel is decent.

This poured a really nice orange amber color with a nice creamy tan head. The body is quite carbonated. Mmmm. The aroma is of caramel and sweet roasted malt. Thought i smelled some clove or pear in there. Not sure though. Prominent in the taste is the roasted malts, it is so warm and happy. To accent that we have some mild holidayish spices and enough hoppiness to provide a mild bite. The alcohol is not noticeable, and at 6.3abv that is pretty damn cool. Very pleasant beer to get you in the holiday mood but not a work of art. Drinkable as hell. Holiday beers don't need to be hard to drink. Anyways, high falls is on a roll, and although i don't like this quite as much as the test bock they had on tap at local bars this is very nice.
