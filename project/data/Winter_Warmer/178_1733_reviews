"09/08/11 at RnH, NYC. Not sure who thought this was a good idea. Not to my liking at all. Way too sour. Thought there was peppermint in the aroma but didn't find it elsewhere. Other references claim it was a CAMRA winter beer of Britain winner. Remind me never to go to Britain in the winter."

"O: It's not bad, although it doesn't strike me as a winter warmer particularly. This bottle did have some age on it, which makes the booziness even more surprising."

"This one makes for a very good sipper."

"Very fruity and not as dark as I had expected, although still quite sweet. You can definitely feel that 6.5% abv. after a few drinks and it is quite a boozy beer to drink but it is one that I would have again."
"Half pint at JDW beer festival. Black, almost opaque apart from the brown edge. Tiny head, poor retention but it kept some lacing. Aroma was cork with notes of cranberry. Malty taste, stoutlike. There was some burn from the booze at the finish. Fairly smooth, texture was like thin syrup, minimal carbonation. Overall it had lots of burn from the alcohol but didn't really have the depth of character that some beers of this strength have."

"Fails to impress, this bottle didn't fare well on this side of the pond. I remember it being somewhat better on cask, some beers may not be worth revisiting..."

"Pours a slightly viscous cloudy brown with a medium lasting tan head. Aroma toasted caramel malt, dark fruits, plums, figs, and some liquorice notes. Taste is toasted caramel malt, dark fruits of plums, dates, black figs with some mild bitterness. A full bodied brew with a slightly viscous and sticky mouthfeel with some moderate carbonation on the palate. Finish is sweet toasted caramel malt, dark fruits, plums, dates, black figs followed by some sweet alcohol esters and some mild bitterness ending. Flavor and aroma of liquorice, dates and figs becomes more evident as it warms up. Overall an excellent, flavorful nicely balanced, and delicious brew, very enjoyable."
"Note: 2009 vintage"
"Two year old properly cellared bottle. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark, nearly opaque brown with a half-finger fine light tan head that actually increased in size as it warmed. Massive lacing. Looks nice. Aroma of dark toasted and caramel malts, slight dark and dried fruit. Flavor follows with dark, toasted and sweeter malt, dark fruit. Finishes with malty dark fruit and a hint of wood, spice and hops. Nice medium body. Very pleasant. I would call this an old ale, not a winter warmer. I don't taste much spicing. I really enjoyed this. Wish this was available more often."
"A rich, fruity experience - quite intense, definitely one to sip and savour. A pleasing blend of flavours that rounds out nicely. A quality strong ale; goes down nicely on a cold winter night. Well worth trying."

"Mouthfeel is much like bread. Mouth is full and busy, the beer is not syrupy but is still thick."

"A great winter warmer sipper. Dark and sweet."

"Notes: Is this a Barleywine, a Strong Ale as the bottle suggests or a Winter Warmer as BA calls it? I guess it doesn't matter, this is another malty, sweet beer like a Wee Heavy but without the peatiness or a Belgian Strong Dark Ale but without the spices. The sweetness of this beer and 7.5% abv make this a sipper. Don't drink this if you're in a hurry, it's a beer to lay down and avoid a bit, then a sip and then another laydown. Good stuff."
"D. A delicious strong ale from Manchester. Although good in bottled form this comes nowhere near to its cask counterpart which is a REAL brute!! 3 pints of this beast on draught and you will know about it (so will your pocket)."
"While not bad compared to most English beers available in the US, there is something essential missing here. With every sip I wait for something to happen, or to change, but it never does."
"D: A surprisingly flavorful and balanced beer. Drinkable."
"Certianly is Moonraker. Too bad I was expecting From Russia With Love."
" D- This beer is dark and dry with some light sugary notes and soft woody/toffee raisin qualities. The softer characters make this easy to drink and beg for another sip to try and figure it out."
"Overall I didn't know what to expect from this beer and was pleasantly surprised by the complexity. An interesting beer that's well worth a shot."
"Taste is spicey raisin & prune, with fermented rich whole wheat bread dough and leafy-woody-peppery-spicey character. On the swet side up front, it becomes drier in the middle before a slightly sweet finish nevertheless backed up by a light spicey bitterness with the hop traits noted above. Aftertaste is initially drier and toasty, leafy and peppery with some caramelised prune, before becoming sweeter. Feel is just right, a slight oiliness is just enough to give it enough body without making it heavy. Drinkability is exceedingly high. This is excellent."
"I don't know... nothing wrong with this beer, but it just isn't doing a lot for me today. It's really not much better than a lot of English style brown ales out there, which is what this beer reminds of. Nothing wrong with that, but... just seems like it could be so much more."
"M&D: being semi-clean on the palate, or at least ""cleaner"" than the smell would tend to suggest, coupled with a very mildly carbonated mouthfeel and a refreshingly dry-bitter palate, this med-plus bodied old ale is as well-structured as it is delicious. I would very much like to try the cask-conditioned version of this once Champion Winter Beer of Britain."
"Not a bad beer, but the spices and malts flavor in this beer seemed to clash for me."
"Overall, this is a decent beer. Nothing about it really stands out, but it will warm you up and has above average flavor. Not a beer I would seek out, but if you happen upon it you might as well give it a shot."
"Brewed on 12 aug 09 and drank on 5 mar 10."
"Taste of a sweet malty brown ale with some brandy/port flavors. Not sure if these are from spices or from barrel aging. Slight funk presence sa well. Smooth drinking , light carbonation. A decent beer, but not my favorite Winter Warmer. A lighter Old Ale IMO with some additional spices."
" A great brew, huge complexity, thank you J.w lee's for serious quality."
"Meh. I've had much better examples of the style. It's not horrible but look elsewhere."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, a bit of moderate carbonation - really well done."
"C: Again, this MAY be a bit out of date, or it may not; even if this is a bit past it's prime, I don't detect a lot of oxidation here; I'm just not completely blown away by this beer, which is kind of unexpected, as J.W. Lees is such a renowned brewery. Due to this, perhaps I'm being a bit hard on this beer. Bottom line: it's tasty, it's classic, and it's delightfully British. Is it worth almost six dollars for a pint? Meh."
"D - This was a good beer, very drinkable, this was another good example of a beer from JW Lees"
"Somewhat of a spicy Winter Warmer. Not overdone though. Some roastiness, but mostly sweet caramel."
"The taste was hops and and berry, actually grape almost. Too grape in fact. It was also mixed with an oak barrel, slightly sweet scot taste to it."
"Cloudy amber pour, very little white head. Nutty, citrus with some malt aroma. Upfront is a little bitter with some citrus, green apple. Mellows out into a real nice maltiness. The fruit continues to fade as the beer warms, the maltiness increases with some toffee and prune like flavors. A solid medium body. The abv isn't exactly strong ale like, but I thought this one was a bit under rated. Would recommend a try to anyone who likes a traditional old ale style brew. For those that prefer a strong ale as basically an Imperial IPA, than this is not for you."
"Drinkability is exceptional, because this beer is exceptional. We just got a new shipment of a bunch of different J.W. Lee's, before which I'd only had them at festivals. Now that I've worked though what they were offering, they might be one of my favorite breweries period, let alone from the U.K.!"
"D: Fuck that, 8 sips is about all i can do."
"The drinkability was ""good""-- this beer is a very mild mannered character. Although I think that the sweetness would prove tiring after a pint. I don't think I'd reach for another."
"Drinkability - I sooo want more. At 6.69 a bottle it's very likely to show up in my fridge many more times. I think I'm in love."
"D: Easy to drink sweet brew. Solid."
"D - Not impressed. Again, I thought I had an old bottle but several other reviewers noted the intensely sweet flavor and syrupy feel."
"Very drinkable despite sweetness and booziness."
"Not something I'd rush out and buy a crate of, but for a change and a headache it is just the ticket."
"D: Drinks bigger then the advertised 7.0%abv. Average drinkability and as per the label pairs nicely with crumbs of strong English cheese, to which I would likely agree."
"Aroma is rich, smoky, with hints of molasses and coffee - what I call ""stouty"" since I am partial towards porters and stouts. It pours a dark, semi-opaque mahogany with a fine-bubbled and fairly persistent head. Flavor is smoky and malty with a fair amount of sweetness. When it goes down the hatch, it leaves a touch of hoppy bitterness, which complements the sweet rather than clashing. A flavorsome and enjoyable beer, one should sip and savor it, and preferably without a distraction like a party or game."
"Drinkability was average to say the least due to the presence of powerful alcohol, and the cloying sweet flavors..."
"almost win like very strong flavor."
"I feel like it was an insult to my favorite beer glass to pour this beer into it."
"All in all a good beer; not a bad pick-up."
"Winter warmer...interesting style. Big and well fermented, a complex brew but not as thick as other strong ale types."
"D - I think I'd prefer this in a 12 oz size. Like the barleywine, this is a sipper. It's great and one I'd have again."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable, highly quaffable beer. I'm not sure this really belongs in the Winter Warmer category, but what's done is done, I guess."
"Plain, deep amber sort of color. No real carbonation to it. No real aroma-somewhat sharp and wine like. Deep, sweet malty flavor though not overly impressive. Slight bitterness to it though it seems more from alcohol then hops. Somewhat thin body wise. Overall pretty average all around. No big deal."
"Drinkability on this is low, I just couldn't get into it. The mouthfeel is too thin, the beer too watery, and the flavors just don't mesh well into anything very pleasant. A curious beer, ultimately unsatisfying. I'm sure this is better at the source."
"Drinkability  This one was a bit lackluster. Maybe a fresher bottle will change my mind."
"Pours a deep dark brown, with an orange tint at the edges when held up to the light. Really weak head; big bubbles which thin out rapidly and leave nothing but a very thin rinse around the edges of the glass. Nothing special in the pour, for sure. Still, the aroma here is boisterous. Fruity scents take command, with malted tones making a presence, but with much more reserve. Apple, pear, prune. And tasty too. Sweet... some malty sweetness, but mostly this is a fruity sweetness. Not sure how they pull this off without actual fruit in the brewing process (IS there fruit in the brewing process here?) but they do a damn fine job of things. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Moonraker would serve as an excellent dessert beer, or after-dinner drink. Not sure I would pair this with a cheese, but definitely a fruit sorbet or plum cake (IS there such a thing as plum cake?). All in all, the Moonraker is a fine brew. Fruity and strong, like the label says."
"not a bad beer at all. I rather enjoy this one. The yeast must be the house strain over at J.W. Lee's, as you can taste some similarities to the harvest ale in this one. I wonder if this has the potential to age as well... I personally love the harvest ale, and this one pales in comparison. BUT, this was 3.99 a pint, compared to $8.49 for 9 ounces. If I'm in the mood and can't afford it, this is a decent back up."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Poured into a standard English Pint glass with an initial plop, releasing a fluffy off-white head that reduced to 1/4"" then held firm. Big aromas of ripe and dark fruits with a bold malt base that hinges on toasty and caramels. A mild, tart fruitiness (berry-like) shows complexity and age. The flavors verify the caramel, toffee, toasted character. Fruit flavors of figs, peaches, almonds, and raspberries swirl around the malts and add varity to the taste. The feel is a solid and persistent bold maltiness with firm creaminess that is tempered only by the berry tawny tartness. Finishes quite malty flavored, yet intriguingly light and dry on the toung. Good Warmer for any season."
"Overall - A excellent winter warmer.... Recommended...."
"More attenuated than the Harvest ale, and holding it's own for a seven + year old brew."
"Drinkability is below average. I can't really picture reaching for another on of these any time soon."
"Update 11/22/06: I decided to crack another bottle with a proper fill level, and it was excellent. Still not alot of carbonation, but definitely at the right level for the style. Flavor was rich and the mouthfeel was thicker than than before. Gritty sediment was still present, but most was left in the bottle. Now I am glad I bought more, and the experience has tought me to pay attention to fill levels. I still feel the $7 price tag is a bit steep for the beer, but nevertheless, a great offering."
"As I'm pouring, I notice that the beer is pouring with nary a bubble in sight. So, I up-end the bottle, and I am able to coax a very slight head out of this, which quickly fades to a light tan ring. Held up to a window, the beer is on the lowest edge of transparent, showing a ruby world. Smells slightly sour, but not in a spoiled way. Light notes of sour cherries, sugar. Not much else on the nose. Tastes of slight caramel, although this hides behind the sweet and sour berry flavor. End very sweet, with no hop bitterness whatsoever. Seems to pass on a sweet cherry note to the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, and carbonation is almost nonexistent. This beer gets cloying pretty quickly, and I don't see myself reaching for it again."
" From the sweet smell I was expecting this to be perhaps too sweet. The brewer did a great job using the hops and alcohol to hold the sweetness in check. Well balanced and very damn drinkable."
"Again, this seems like a little cousin to the Harvest Ale, which I find far superior. This is not bad by any means, but I would never choose this over the Harvest. Especially with the $5.99 price tag."
"Saludos to BRoss242 for the sample."
"Clear, reddish brown body, and a small head, made this beer look stately, but boring. The smell was little too fruity for my liking. Apart from unidentifiable dark skinned dry fruits, this one also smelled woody and sour. The taste was pretty much same as the smell. The mix of sweet, sour, and musty flavors didnt quite rise to undrinkable standards, but did make me wince every time I took a sip. The body seemed thin at first, but after while it got to be more substantial. Usually that is good, but with this Moonraker, more flavors were not necessarily better. About the only positive was the well hidden 7.5% ABV. Not a beer, Id care to drink again."
"Pours a very dark brown with redish tint. It has almost not head other than from splashing and looks to have almost no carbonation. The smell is of ripe dark fruits, roasted malts and maybe a flutter of hops at the end. Medium bodied with the fruits and roasted flavors leading the way. The fruits are almost overpowering border lining on sweet caramel flavors as well. Almost no carbonation makes this beer tast almost juice like at times. There is a tiny bit of bitterness at the very, very end. Nothing seems to balance out the fruit though. Alcohol isnt very apparent in the taste but it is warming. I can see it hard to drink more than one of these beers due to the overpowering fruit flavors. Would be great with some winter food dishes like turkey with cranberry sauce though."
"Mouthfeel- A very surprising mix of drynes and fruity sweetness all over my palate. This was a barley wine ith the drinkability of a bitter or pale ale."
"Not very well integrated or especially appealing."
"Dull brown color with a thin and diminishing white cream. Aromatically gentle, caramel smelling, along with several dark ripe fruits, completely malt-accented. Big, bubbly and heavy feel on the palate, with finely extracted malt tones. Soft caramel and toffee flavors, very sweet and a bit cloying. Brash alcohol as well, which could use a little more hop. Light almond extract flavor as well."
"Drinkability: Not a bad winter warmer, but I think this might be a little past it's peak."
"This beer poured a deep brownish color with a slight white head with good lacing. The beer had the smell of deep fruit and the strong alcohol content. Impressive. The taste is a nice balance of a malty sweetness but with a kick of the ABV which is refreshing and gives you a good mouthful."
"500 ml bottle."
"This beer came a dark brown with faint burgundy highlights. The head was very thick, tan and heavy. Smells of earthy dark fruits and caramel. Tastes of a sweet smoky molasses and burnt caramel with a slight touch of sourness that runs nicely into a little nip of earthy hops. The mouth feel is medium bodied with a light carbonation. This beer is quite tasty and easy going down."
"Overall: I didn't really care for the flavors profile as the dark fruit, molasses and herbal elements really clash"
"A dark red ruby, dark brownish color with a minimal head that is constantly fed by the carbination. A slight alcohol aroma with some caramel. When i first sipped this beer to me it was very sweet. that for me contributes to the average drinkablity. Medium bodied mouthfeel and not bad for a winter warmer"
"shines through."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice rich, malty scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It's warm and slightly fruity. The taste is great. It has a warm, yet highly smooth malty flavor that is sweet at the start and dry at the finish. It has a nice roasted feel with some subtle fruity hints. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good seasonal brew. I love the roasted character as well as the complex flavors; a good drinker."
"I accept the description on the bottle - this must be great in pies and such. Straight drinking - a suitably hopped dark beer with distinct sourness, smooth mouthfeel. Nice dark colour. Secondary malt and licorice. Somewhat drinkable. Must be shared. Not for everybody."
"Very classy Old Ale that is a very nice sipper. Lots of complexity. Another fine English ale from J.W.Lees. Try this with some English sharp cheddar or Cheshire cheese for a real treat."
"Pours a nice clear deep amber with a big fluffy off white head that sticks like glue to the sides of the glass leaving globs of lace behind,hints of caramel malt and brown suger in the nose but it doesnt really stick out just there if you know what I mean.A big English malt bomb here brown suger and some butter toffee,the flavors dont hit ya in the face but pleasant and slightly subdued a nice butter toffee aftertaste makes this beer even more tasty.I really like this English strong ale its very drinkable for the style."
"Overall just fine. Nothing stands out, but nothing detracts either. Others have noted the price and it is a bit spendy. Probably could do better for less."
"This brew pours a ruby color with brown hints. A finger of creamy head sits atop the liquid. The nose is caramel, brown sugar and raisin with a slight spiceyness in there as well. The flavor is pretty nice, with big bit of brown sugary sweetness and a very big spicy raisiney quality to it. I find this to be very enjoyable. The feel is moderate to thick with a light to moderate carbonation. I like it. Its not a fantastic beer, but above average. Everything melds well together and makes a nice brew."
"Pours a brownish red color with a tall head that falls quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma seems faint, but there is a little caramel, some slight dark fruits. Lots of flavors. Dark fruits, toffee, caramel, quite a bit of bitterness. Possibly a little coffee and/or chocolate. Thick body and good drinkability. Some slightly odd flavors, possibly spices. Interesting beer."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a minimal uneven tan head over the cloudy, deep red brew. Head and lacing are both lacking, to say the least. Aroma is vinous and dark fruits, reminds me of their Harvest Ale. Taste is somewhat bitter for the style, with a slight spicy flavor. Mouthfeel is relatively creamy, but the bitterness is somewhat off-putting, and drinkability is similar. Not as overly spiced as some Winter Warmers are, but this one has room for improvement."
"Moonraker is okay, but there are much better winter warmers than this. In fact, I've had a few from lesser known American brewers that could kick its ass to the dark side of the moon and back."
"Drinkability  very smooth; very easy on the palate; a bit warming"
"A nice winter warmer, not the best I've had, but far from the worst. Aroma is fruity, with citrus most noticable to my olfactory. Spicing is on the mild side with a dry finish. A deep garnet color with a creamy white head that starts about 3/4 of an inch, then fades to 1/8 inch. Decent lacing. Perhaps the true test of a beer is ""would I buy it again?"" Yep."
"Ok, but a bit rough around the edges."
"Dark plum with a nice tan head of foam that lasted for quite a while. The aroma of this brew was all about the big fruity malts, I got hints of plums, pudding, cranberries, various nuts, and more. Like an excellent winter cake in a bottle. The taste was sweet, fruity, and malty up front, with some complex fruit and nut notes in the middle, and a very smooth finish that left a lingering dark fruit aftertaste on the tongue. The mouthfeel was medium bodied>thick but perfect and the drinkability was good as well. Not as good as their harvest ale, but another winner from Manchester, none-the-less."
"Has a nice deep brown color with hints of red. No head to see but left a tiny lacing along the sides which says ""resin"" to me. Alcohol, dates and maybe some sugary nose. Tasting this made me feel as though I had a cold. Definitely some sort of cough syrup feel and taste. A lot of alcohol followed by a syrup character with yeast and some molasses. Perhaps this is a bad bottle but I really don't agree with the other reviews on this. I've had much better."
"Drinkabilityis very nice, smooth and malty. Love to try on cask."
"Pours with a two-finger light brown head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep clear amber color. Good carbonation. Nose is sweet and raisiny. Medium-heavy bodied. Starts sweet and raisiny and finishes on the dry side. $5.75 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Sampled 12/13/03"
"This Barley Wine pours a dark reddish-brown color with a thin light brown head. Thin lacing. The aroma is malty and fruity. Lighter body than most Barley Wines, with flavors of roasted malt, caramel, and fruit. The finish is very sweet and borderline cloying. Not the best of the style, but maybe a ""Beginner's Barley Wine"" due to the lighter body and more sedate flavors."
"poured a clear, deep copper-maroon with a large, billowy off-white head that stuck around. malty, raisiny sweetness on the nose which was quite strong at cellar temperature. smooth, creamy, full body give quite an inviting mouthfeel. the taste was caramel, sweet malt, dark red fruit and a bourbon quality. all that malty sweetness then snaps to a very dry finish. a nice warming brew that i'll go back to again on a cold night."
"This dark and inviting ale pours a ruby-tinged mahogany with a smallish off-white head. A resinous hop aroma mingles with a bit of caramel malt and fumy alcohol. The slightly biscuity caramel malt reveals a nice nutty flavor, with a light herbal quality to it. The hops are in abundance. Sharp-edged white grapefruit and lemon zest bitterness mix with hints of a metallic bite. A candy sugar sweetness begins to peek through as it warms. A mild dose of a warming sherry-like alcohol backbone stays throughout. I can only guess that J.W. may have a quality control issue, based on the many high and low ratings it has received. This particular bottle is quite good...good to the point where I can't imagine anyone not liking it."
"It's a malty one, and a tasty one, and near the end, the 7.5% ABV starts to get up and drag you out by the trousers...."
"Dark ruby in colour with a healthy white head that lasts quite long before diminishing. Aroma hops and a hint of alcohol on the nose. Rich, roasty, malty flavours on the tongue; chewy even. A nice, warming ale supposedly named for some Mancunians who apparently tried to rake the Moon's reflection out of a river."
"The pour and head both look good, but a little short. It looks like this beer is only 9.89 oz., not going to lie but Im little disappointed seeing that I expected 12. The color is blackened brown and the foam looks good. First sip is smooth basically tasting like Newcastle brown ale. Then hints of liquorish, malt, hop, chalk, and vanilla. Sweet delicate flavors then bombarded the taste buds. Man. Be careful pouring, I had some clumps in my pint. Interesting beer and the taste has England all over it."
"Well balanced brown ale... a bit sweet. Nice with pudding."
"Dark mahogany brown color, appears slightly clearish overall with light transmission at the bottom of the pint glass. Very soft yellow head of about 1/2 inch to start. Laces thickly. Some cocoa to the deep smell, some carob as well. Lighter mouthfeel than I expected but the flavor is decently full, expressing chocolate powder, light coffee tones, and a burnt profile close to the end. Some slight sense of alcohol but relatively smooth and easy drinking. A good enough beer but I have to admit I was expecting better mouthfeel and a little more complexity to write about."
"Drinkability  This is definitely 9 ounces of sipping ale. I enjoyed it very much, but the flavors are a bit strong and clumsy and may not be to everyones liking."
"The feel is distinctly smooth and creamy, with no sense of overload from the fullness of the body. This is a delightfully rich and drinkable ale. Very nice."
"Add it all together and it's pretty good....just doesn't blow my socks off...tastes very alcoholic...like drinking bourban....worth trying one bottle...I will not buy this one again...."
"Turbid and murky brown appearance. Just a collaring of light brown head. Aroma has caramel, wood, toffee, smoke and prunes. Good is a bit of an understatement. The smoke and toffee are the primarys on the buds. Some bitterness enters the equation. Leather as well. Raisins and rumcake. Licorice as well. Decent enough, but nowhere near the class of their Harvest ales."
"pat"
"Drinkability: Very good. A ver nice strong ale."
"Bottle conditioned; enjoyed at 50F.Carefully poured, the body is a slightly hazy, rich mahogany with an orange-cast and crimson highlights. It's topped by a thin but creamy light-tan head that holds surprisingly well and leaves thin and spotty lace throughout the glass. The aroma displays toffee, mild dark fruit, and alcohol. It's quite estery. As it warms, however, some more caramel notes begin to appear. A full body, coupled with a very fine and gentle carbonation, gives an exceptionally soft and creamy mouthfeel that emphasises the maltiness. The flavor is far more complex than the nose alludes to with notes of dark fruit (prune, raisin), toffee, scortched caramel, honey, oak and a touch of alcohol. It finishes with a rising bitterness and unique hop flavor that's not unlike wet, leafy, whole hops left in the wort at the end of the boil... lightly earthy, herbal and resiny - but dripping with malt. It combines with the residual semi-sweet dark malt to give a lingering licorice note. Well balanced and quite unique. A splendid, rich and complex old ale that's not quite accessible as Old Peculier, but ultimately more rewarding to those willing to delve a little deeper. If old ale is your tipple, this one is not to be missed!"
"It was the first and probably the last time i'll drink this brew. It starts with a unappealing sweet molasses aroma. Roasted malt, molasses and toffee are all apparent at first then a strong alcohol feel takes over. It has more chunks and sediment than any beer i have ever seen, it wasn't a very enjoyable sight. Drinkability and mouthfeel don't seem to important at this point."
"Ok, I know that this review will be harsh but take it as a warning. Do not get an old bottle! The bottle I purchased must have been sitting at the store for years. It poured very thick with no head at all. It had huge chunks all throughout. It went right down the drain. I returned the other bottle I had purchased."
"275mL. bottle, bottle conditioned. Cloudy dark brown, minimal head. Dark ripe fruit, notes of prune, raisins and pear...some medicinal alcohol. These notes are also present in the flavor along with some sticky caramel and molasses and more strong alcohol. For a brew at 7.5% abv, this tastes like a much stronger beer, almost like a barleywine. Full mouthfeel. A unique, belly warming brew."
"Murky brown ale with a slight reddish tint.  Plenty of CO2 trails noticeable through the murk.  Good sized tan head.  Dissipates quickly, but carbonation keeps a thin lace atop the brew.  Rich malty aroma with hints of raisin, toffee and an odd note of roasted malt.  Chewey toffee/caramel flavor, with hints of dark fruit.  A little thinner on the taste than I'd like, however.  Despite the carbonation, mouthfeel is rather creamy.  It's a lot like rich, chewey toffee candy, without the intense sweetness.  A pretty smooth drinking brew."
"Deep and dark reddish colour that fringes on brown. Fruity with a bubble gum and medicinal aroma. Smooth with a creamy back, nearly full body with a big maltiness ahead. Estery and yeasty in flavour with a husky grain and leafy hop that is a bit bothersome. Sweet from the large amount of malt but the all of the astringent flavours bashes that to hell. Not a bad brew, its just all over the place  not held together well at all."
"On the back it says it won as a winter ale, and as a barley wine. I'll just call it a strong ale and straighten things out."
