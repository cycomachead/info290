"This turns into a hop drinker more and more as the glass goes down. At 68 IBU that should come as no shocker. It's certainly an interesting arrangement, and I'm glad I got a bottle. It doesn't totally assert itself but doesn't really need to either."

"Interesting and a good start to six beer mini-session I had that evening."

"O: This one is a bit of a hybrid of a Black IPA and a Winter Warmer which I find a slightly awkward style - it is a little more approachable than a lot of other winter warmer beers as it is less sweet and not as intensely spicy."
"O: This beer seems to be a little easier to drink compared to other beers in the style and reminds me a little of a Black IPA."
""
""
"Not a beer I have seen before, but one I will seek out again whenever possible."
""
"Overall- A little too hoppy for the style but drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer has trouble finding an identity, especially as a winter warmer. I like it but I am not too picky."
""
"O- Good beer. Not a normal ""Winter Warmer"" spice/malt with a sweet finish. The hops were a pleasant surprise. Overall, this is a One and Done for me, but well worth it every chance you get."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: A good brew to drink slowly, nothing wild, was exactly what I was expecting, a good simple winter warmer."
""
""
""
"Overall – An unexpectedly hoppy winter warmer. While unexpected, it was rather nice; not too sweet but rather balanced overall. It’s a beer to try if you get a chance."
"O- It's strong pine and hop resin characteristics combined with the malt sweetness make it a great beer for a ski lodge or a cabin, but compared to most other winter warmers I've had this just doesn't compare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Above average. Creamy and hoppy."
"Overall a tasty concoction but a tad overhopped. Filling, leaves no room for other better beers."

"Drinkability: well, I'd think it was too heavy, but it's not huge overall. At only 6.6% it's actually light enough to drink more than one, and the awesome depth and complexity ensures you want more than one. Love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a rather mediocre beer in my opinion. Maybe it would have been better fresh. The apple characteristics I'm not fond and the rest of the flavor profile is one dimensional and simplistic. I'll avoid this in the future."
""
""
""
""
"O- An enjoyable brew, just seems to have more dark ale-like characteristics than that of a winter warmer to me."
""
""
""
"Overall - A very, very good Winter Warmer offering from Rogue. Classic Rogue flavors, but stands on it's own merit. Flavors are bold. A bit too much pine in the hop for my liking, but still a complex, aggressive winter warmer."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: interesting once. Perhaps not again."
"Out of a bomber this beer was a clear, dark copper color with some ruby highlights. The head was a towering cap of tan foam that left lacing as and retained. The aroma was of caramel malt, piney hops, some herbal notes, and a touch of leather and wood. The flavors were similar to the aroma, dominated by the hoppy elements but with the addition of some biscuity malt that came through one the dry finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation appropriate. An odd beer, only in that it was supposed to be a winter warmer but came off more like an IPA. If it had been sold in summer as an IPA I think I would have enjoyed it more"
"O: I really enjoy this. I could easily see me having this again during some ski trip or even during the holiday season while I dream of my next ski vacation. A nice offering from Rogue. While I haven't had too many of their beers at this point, I can already feel the Rogue ""trademark taste"" in this one. I also like that they used some proprietary ingredients in this one. Well done."
""
""

"This beer pours very dark black brown with reddish hints and a nice tan head. It has a very hoppy nose with fruity hops and a crisp bitterness. The taste is very hoppy, consisting of citrus fruits and a modest astringency to it. It has a strong backing of caramel malts and some carafa. Its dark and smooth yet not too heavy as it looked quite thick. This is a unique and refreshing brew that I really enjoyed. I do however disagree that this is a winter warmer, It tastes 100% like a black IPA and nothing like a winter warmer. No complaints about that being that black IPA's are one of my favorite styles. This is a solid beer, very similar to their dads helper black IPA."
"Overall: solid beer from rogue and a good 22 to enjoy in between runs too. Very hippy and flavorful and wish the bitterness would be toned down just a tad."
"Draught @ Mikro: This one pours a hazy, ruby-coppery color. There was a tan head and some lacing from it. Lots of grapefruit hops up front to the nose. Some other citrus. Not much else making it through. The taste is more balanced. Grapefruit hops up front, with a medium malt body behind it. Some malt sweetness making it through, as well as a hint of nuttiness and maybe some chocolate. Not much else is making its way to the front. Not bad."
""
"O: Though I've grown to love hops, I wish they did not completely overpower the malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty hoppy for a winter warmer but the malt backbone evens out the hops and heat, making this one of the better brews I've had by Rogue in some time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really liked this beer....it is a little hop heavy, but nothing wrong with that as the flavors balance out in the end."
"O: I didn't particularly enjoy the hops used. More of a citrus taste would have been better."
""
""
""
"A good winter warmer, easily one of the best Rogue beers I've had in a long time"
""
"Ok brew. Easy to drink, nice hop an malt profile. Nothing distinctive, but tasty just the same."
"O - decent beer but definitely not my favorite, interesting take on a winter style even if it did miss a bit for me"
""
""
""
""
"O- I took off points just because this beer isn't a true winter warmer. It's a good beer, just not what it claims to be."
"Overall: I thought this was a really weird beer. It was like drinking two beers at the same time. The malty profile and hops didn't work together for me."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, opaque, stout-like sable with a nice tan head that leaves behind some average lacing. Aroma is seriously hoppy, having a firm evergreen tone like fresh-cut pine wood. Bold flavor has considerable hoppiness and some bitterness with woody and earthy notes and just a hint of caramel. Firm-bodied texture is fairly fizzy and leaves a tingly, slightly smoky finish. Go mad!"
""
""
"O: drink it! rogue makes a few beers i dont like. This is far from any of them"
"Pours dark amber brown with tall, foamy, tan head. Good head retention and lacing. Hoppy, spicy aroma up front with notes of pine sap and flowers. This is backed by mellow, roasted malts with some chocolate and caramel notes. Taste-wise, the beer opens up with rather aggressive hops, but quickly becomes more subdued, with more malt forward flavors. Hints of chocolate, roasted malt, and rich bread. A distinctive nutty aftertaste provides a clean, smooth finish. Substantial mouthfeel, thick with medium body. Pleasantly bitter with good balance."
""
"O - Not a bad beer but it misses the mark as far as taste goes. A nice surprise of hoppy goodness isn't enough to make up for the unbalanced feel of this beer."
""
"GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"O: Pretty uninspired overall although not a terrible choice."
""
"The finishing move to my night out at WB. It pours a clear dark russet topped by a half-finger of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, very light leek, light grapefruit peel, and light mandarin orange. The taste holds notes of dark caramel, very light leek, flowers, light-ish greens, and grass. Tastes sorta like a salad whose dressing has gone downhill slightly... The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, kinda sad brew, one that's not sure what it wants to be, but it's schizoid nature leads to sub-par tastes and whatnot."
"Overall, I really love this beer because it feels spicy and more of what I expect from a winter warmer. It's got that spicy bite that remind me of winter and the holidays."
""
""
"D: Goes down pretty well. This is one to have on hand after a hard day's work. Not something to have as a treat, though, as the flavor is so light."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great unique beer. Although it doesnt quite match up with what I would consider to be a winter warmer, its great nonetheless."
"dryish caramel all around. butterscotch, reinforced by a piney hop flavor. woah...there, at the finish...that was REAL butterscotch. a little sweet & buttery for my liking"
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance was dark brown with ruby red hue. There was less than a finger of head with no retention. There is rye bread in the nose and some mild chocolate upfront in the taste. As you get halfway through the beer the hop finish really begins to sneak up on you (in a pleasant way)."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Easy drinkability but this brew is missing a lot. The flavor is well put together but doesn't follow through."
"O: This is a surprisingly tasty and well done beer. An interesting take on the Winter Warmer."
"O: a decent beer from rouge."
"nice beer, willing to pick it up agiain and enjoying."
"I've had better and worse both from Rogue and from this style. I was hoping the deliciousness of Amarillo would shine through a bit more than it did, but still a solid brew."
"O: This is a tasty beer really complex in the aroma and taste. Hadn't had this one before but I'm glad I picked it up."
"This beer poured out as a dark brown color with a decent tan head. The smell of the beer had some sweetness to it but mostly had an earthy spicy aroma going on. The taste of the beer had a good amount of hops in it but other than that I wasn't able to really get much else from it. The mouthfeel was decent but nothing that really made me excited. Overall, I think I'd like to check out this beer again one day. Perhaps the flavors will be better for me on a second attempt."
"O - Hops are more evident in the aroma than the taste, where the rich malt flavor dominates without masking the hop component. Mogul Madness is a smooth and delicious brew you can think of as either a winter warmer or a brown PA. In any case very flavorful and interesting without being challenging. Highly recommended year around."
"O: Nice winter beer with good herbal notes (which I'm not usually a huge fan of)."
"Pours brown with red highlights, and no real head when it came to my table. Smell is inviting, hops up front with citrus notes and a kick of pine. The flavor was smooth with the citrus and hops up front, followed with subtle bitter notes. The hops lingered in the aftertaste with the pine. A medium mouthfeel beer with deep flavor, but not very complex, but is done very well. This one is an easy drinker, definitely worth checking out."
"I poured gently as I could see at least a modicum of sediment in the bottom of the bottle and I still got a finger of deep-tan head with excellent retention. Color was a deep ruby-red with cola highlights. Beautiful! Nose was ""like chewing on pine needles"" as one wag recently said to me. Har! Wow, was the the taste gooood! We/I recently postulated on the pairing of Girl Scout cookies and beer and this would either be like gilding the lily to the Thin Mints or a perfect accompaniment. It was medium-bodied, but it had a beautiful marriage of chocolate/coffee malt and wintergreen hops on the tongue. Gott dang! It suddenly struck me as more of a dessert beer, like in lieu of a Grasshopper, but samey same. OMFG, I would totally lay this on a lotta people that claim not to like ""hoppy"" beers. Phuckin' phenomenal! Finish was clean and dry, like a deep breath on the mountains. Try some today!"
"The Rogue Chocolate Stout is out of this world, and over the top chocolaty. This is a nice hoppy alternative, that you can stick with all night if you find it on tap."
"D: I think this would be good for a glass or two in the evening."
"Sampled on March 7, 2011. It pours a cloudy dark amber with about a quarter inch of long-lasting beige head. Roasted malts greet the nose followed swiftly by earthy and hoppy sensations and a little inviting yeast. The body falls into the medium range bubbling with carbonation. The taste is also full of hop and earth elements and very easy to drink with a satisfying bitterness."
"A well balanced, tasty brew. Well suited for winter, or March in Minnesota."
"D-quite drinkable, but not the greatest"
"I can see what they wanted here but the bitterness is out of balance and doesn't work as well as it could."
"A deep brown root beer color with a fair tan head and oodles of lacing. The aroma gives me a sharp cat piss overdose with a touch of saltwater peat. Interesting and enticing for the hop lover. The flavor brings lots more of the bitter hop theme with some brown bread highlights and a cool evergreen refreshment. It's fairly effervescent with a medium light body and nearly resinous feel. This sure does not come off as your typical winter warmer but it's hard to pin down, maybe a simple IPA. Fair drinkability but I would probably prefer a Hop Stoopid. Still, very decent for the hop head."
"Sampled on-tap at Gingerman in NYC. Dark, hazed, infused hue with slight carbonation evident. Aroma was laden with malts well-balanced by a minor yet noticeable hop presence. Thick, rich taste with an equally satiating mouthfeel. Rogue consistently churns out top-quality brews. Although I can't attest to this being one of their finest samples, it was a solid stab at the style nonetheless. Somewhere in between a Black IPA and a Winter Warmer; although the genre is somewhat vague, it still asserts itself as an ideal Winter-time brew."
"D - Nice taste and balance. The woodyness slows you a bit."
"Overall a very good beer from Rogue as usual. I think a fresher sample would have been better."
"Drinkability: One of the better black IPA's that is obtainable - the hops used really set the tone for a beer thats rich in hop flavor, yet the malt on the backend really smooths this beer out. At 6.6% ABV, this is a easy drinker that can be a good session beer if drank in moderation. A very good beer all around."
"Dark brown topped by off-white head that leaves a pleasant ring of lacing. A hoppy, pine, lemon aroma. A hop-forward ale with notes of pine, lemon, mint, slight resin, slight tile cleaner, a brief break from the hops allows for the roast/dark malts to come through but it doesn't stay around for long. It finishes bitter and clean. A medium bodied brew with medium carbonation. I respect the hop aggressive nature of this winter warmer."
"D: A good drinker."
"Decent drinkability, but aftertaste is something to deal with."
"In all honesty Rogue needs to step up their game. A lot of their beers are going down hill. Stop worrying about liquor and get back to the beers."
"Good beer, I'd definatly have another."
"I would call this a Hop Warmer or Winter hoppy. Its not the malty warm brews you expect from a Winter Warmer. It goes in the same vien as the SN Celebration. But I think the Celebration is better balanced. This one has a nice dark ruby red color and godd head and carbonation. Aroma is pine forest and hop oil. Again all I am getting is a hop bite with a bitter finish. Its still a good beer, but not my taste for a Winter Warmer."
"D: Great! Very tasty. Alcohol not apparent but it feels like approx 7%."
"Overall, a completely average example of the style, worth a shot if you see it, but not really worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel: For what I was expecting, it was incredibly creamy, catching me off guard, but still pleasant to have the body without a whole lot of apparent alcohol."
"D: Drinkability was warming, dark and bitter with some earthy citrus notes that gave you that feel of the mountain. A decent wintery brew, perhaps a good starter after a long day on the slopes before moving onto the stouts and barleywines to finish the job."
"Mogul Madness stands out from the winter crowd by being so damn drinkable. The body is smooth and full, almost creamy, with fantastic carbonation. Alcohol is firmly in check, but the beer still buzzes with flavor. Rogue alludes to a lot of disparate beer styles, but ultimately hits much closer to home for me than other winter warmers. I consider this to be in Jubelale territory."
"Overall this is not a bad beer but not as good as I remembered it from last year. The malt profile falls a little flat compared to your average winter warmer; not sure if that was the intention, anyway... Overall, it seems a little too resinous and slick for me."
"This beers pours a dark and deep amber color with a little head that staed throughout. has a light smokey smell. tastes a bit smoked, starts hoppy, but not too much, finishes a bit malty, very unquie. nice strong taste gives it a nice mouthfeel, flavor lasts on your palatee for a while. Overall a good beer, very unquie very enjoyable."
"Maybe too much hops, towards a double IPA yt all under control and fruity. Newport, Horizon, Simcoe, Continental, Crystal 90, Amarillo, and Rogue Farm Willamette. Peachy colour with fruit bits. Medium plus mouthfeel. Not for everyone but complex complement with food."
"D - This beer has a great aroma but a more flat flavor. The finish is a bit too dry for the level of bitterness that is left lingering on the palate. As a result, the malt richness is lost and the beer is less drinkable than it could be. Still, it is a nice beer and worth trying if you have the chance."
"On tap at Kickbacks Gastropub in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Exceptionally thick and sticky lacing lines the glass. Aroma is dominated by sweet malts but I can tell from the smell and lacing that there must be significant hops added. Some other interesting aromas noted but not sure if I can pick out anything specific. The amalgam of flavors all add up to a smell unique to any beer I've smelled before. Taste is also difficult to describe maybe there is some interesting flavor like chamomile dominating? Not my favorite beer ever but interesting and certainly unique."
"Drinkability: Not something I would drink in abundance during one sitting however I can see enjoying it more during the cold months to come."
"Taste: intense hop flasvor backed up with a great maltbackbone. berry/mocha flavors to boot. comaplex brew and one of the winners tonight"
"It's a nice winter warmer, but I don't see anything particularly special about it."
"drank in Jan 2010."
"Good, moderate level of carbonation and a pleasant after beer dinner on a cool (for me at least) spring night."
"Drinkability - A great example of a winter warmer, though not the beer I needed to really sell me on the style completely. It's well balanced and refined, I just wish the bitterness of the taste was a little more subdued."
"Sure, these guys have occasional issues with packaging and pricing, but the final product is incredibly satisfying much more often than not. Mogul Madness Ale isn't bumpy in the least. Rather, it's a smooth and delicious descent from first ounce to last."
"the palette adjusts it's not too bad."
"Poured from a bomber with a label that features the words ""festive"" and ""lively."" Head fades quickly but very nice lacing down the glass. Color is some combination of red brick, auburn, burgundy. Aroma is a nice mix of hops plus the typical winter warmer spices. Taste is definitely heavy towards the hops. Something about this beer reminds me of Christmas and Santa Claus. I cannot explain that. It's possible that's because it's along the same lines as SN Celebration or Rogue Santa's Private Reserve. But for me this one falls short of those. The flavor and aftertaste lack a little balance and leaves me disappointed after the intriguing aroma."
"The carbination is a little to strong for me. and this wouldn't fall in my fav. list. I still love rogue and you should sit back and enjoy this beer."
"Drinkability: It's solid and certainly fine for at least a pint's worth. A robust, bitter brew for the winter months."
"D: An untraditional representation of the style, but a solid winter brew nonetheless. Good malt makeup and an excellent source of natural spiciness in the hop blend. A slightly phenolic taste and warming effect let you know there's a little kick in there, but this would be a nice bomber to have on hand after a day of shoveling or snowboarding."
"Originally Reviewed on: 03-12-2010 06:58:05"
"A pretty good hoppy ale - but any Winter Warmer characteristics are more or less obfuscated."
"a little different so from that point of view I liked it, much more hops then I expect from winter warmers and much less spice so I may be a little generous when reviewing for style but hey what can I say I liked this beer"
"D - Starts out fairly well, but by the end of the bomber, the dark fruit/plum/prune even? taste just became too overpowering. Could have used some more well defined hops to balance it out. It was an ok brew, but I don't think I will pick it up again."
"Yummy but subdued malts, sugary but not syrupy. Hops peel away the malts a little too quickly for me. This one has big flavors and remains really enjoyable. Not a session beer but drinkable, enjoyable."
"Some people can get behind the malt bomb and hops bomb combined into one, but it's not my favorite thing. This one is aided by a slight dryness, but it's not quite enough to make this beer deserving of my recommendation."
"Astringent is the key word for this dark hoppy ale, you get it coming and going from both the malt and the hops throughout. Gets a bit boring after a while, can't say I'd pick up another one."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but the metallic flavor throws everything off and detracts from the quality of the beer."
"we arrived at the eugene city brewery and just happened upon the brewer here at this fine rogue establishment. nate showed us around as i attempted desperately to nurse this fine ale. can a brown thing sparkle? i feel so. a winter warmer? maybe. an ipa? not quite. and not a cda? no, indeed, not. somewhere in between these beers lies the mogul madness, a deliciously hopped winter ale that is a treat to the northwest, and indeed, anywhere else it goes. grassiness and pines, like imagining what lies beneath when you're trekking with giant pads beneath your feet. a solid body, and an amazing finish. usually i'm a rogue hater, i mean, i don't hate rogue, i just wish for so much more from them. am i reconverted?"
"Once again I had the Rogue flashback with this beer as it tasted a lot like Sig's Northwestern Ale in that is a dark ale with lots of hops and the typical Pac man yeast. Decent beer as most Rogues are but nothing special or memorable. I liked the malty backbone and the finish was pretty solid but it didn't rock my world"
"D: OK drinkability, I thought it needed more malts to round out the beer."
"Overall, a good beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability: I am not a fan. This is a moderately bitter sipper that has spices that are less pronounced. I have had way better in the style, and would not buy it again for the price."
"Impression: One of the poorer offerings from Rogue I've tried. Many better winter warmers. Not thrilled, won't buy again."
"D-not very tasty and a pretty thin body. i don't recommend."
"A dark brown beer with red highlights. Thick tan head, fair amount of lacing. Nice caramel malt aroma, with a hoppy, citric aroma lingering in the background. The taste was a reversal of the aroma. Pronounced grapefruit with a small malt contribution. This was a pretty hoppy beer, not at all like other winter warmers I have tried."
"A nice winter warmer indeed! I love winter warmers that lend hop spicing rather than adjunct spicing, and still keep winter maltiness!"
"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, bitter aroma that boasts of pale, roasted, and crystal malts along with an excellent dose of hops. The taste is decent. It has a bone dry, pale and roasted malt flavor along with a very bitter hop taste. I like the hop component, but it takes away from the malt character. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinker as far as winter warmers are concerned, but there are plenty more available that are better."
"Color is very dark brown with an attractive ivory head. Not too much of an aroma: hops, brown bread, Taste is quite nice. A good hop punch, but it's well integrated. Beer is substantial but not at all heavy. Nice malt and perhaps a hint of nutmeg. Good depth. Mouthfeel is smooth, a good amount of carbonation. All in all, very good to excellent. A hoppy, complex ale."
"While this isn't the best beer that I've had from Rogue, it's probably the most drinkable of their offerings that I've ever tried. On a cold night like this, it's a welcome change from the darker beers that fill the shelves this time of the year and for someone trying out a winter seasonal, this is very good one to start with!"
"A fantastic beer that seems similar to Old Crustacean, just a tad lighter on all fronts and easier to drink."
"A decent brew, not sure I would spend another 7 bucks for a bomber though."
"The beer pours a red ruby color has a faint nutty smell the taste is a smooth yet bitter taste and has the feel of a esb. The drinkabilty is not bad but not overwhelming either."
"Had two pints before I had to move on, would have loved another."
"D- Hard to gauge since the ABV is unlisted. A bitter ale that doesn't seem to pack too much depth. That being said, it is smooth and drinks nicely."
"Like a thinner, less malty, more straight-up bitter version of Yakima Twilight. Victory's is better, however."
"Notes: A very good looking beer that is way too bitter for me."
"Dark amber body, nearly opaque, cloudy, after warming discovered this wasn't chill haze. 1 finger tan head, medium dissipation with decent lacing. The nose is bready malts, a bit of spice (cardamon?), chocolate, coffee and very complex hop profile which is hard to deconstruct. Taste is primarily coffee, chocolate, bitter hops with a bit of plum-like sweetness, and a pretty dry finish. Great mouthfeel, nicely carbonated, not too syrupy. Not sessionable but a nice holiday ale. Well worth a try."
"This brew pours a dark amber,red colour and almost looks like brown creaming soda with a nice two finger foamy head and heaps of nice lacing around the glass,the aromas are coffee,herbal piney hops and a touch of kiwi fruit,it has a weighty mouthfeel although its just weighted nicely enough to easily have another sip after another with tastes of piney,herbal hops the first thing i taste followed by a nicely balanced middle body of caramel,toffee malts that really smooths out the tailend of this beer to make it not really that bitter as i was expecting with the 7 hops that they have used i was expecting a big bitter bomb right at the end but not at all and to be quite honest this has to be one of the best balanced beers that i have had and if you come across this brew i highly recommend you buy a few of them as im going back to my bottleshop tomorrow to buy more,definately a top class beer."
"D: I wouldn't call this a winter warmer, but I enjoyed the coffee and Chocolate/Mocha."
"Wouldnt call it a winter warmer so much. maybe strong ale. Nothing yells winter or warmer at me."
"The name for this beer has been used multiple times by Rogue for other beers,this incarnation is quite good.Poured a rich muhogany with a creamy one fingered off-white head that never really settles.Crystal malt aromas really stick out,iron,lightly sweet biscuit,and some leafy hop, wich is quite subtle, linger.Caramel/vanilla malt flavors up front,a little toast as well,the hops come in leafy form,just a hint of citrus comes thru in a long finish.Near creamy mouthfeel makes it almost lush in the mouth,flavors wont blow ya away, but its a real nice winter offering."
"D: A great example of a winter warmer, though not the beer I needed to really sell me on the style completely. It's well balanced and refined, I just wish the bitterness of the taste was a little more subdued."
"Overall very nicely done and certainly a welcomed holiday treat."
"Extremely solid and drinkable ale with lots of robust character and an assertive hop bitterness."
"A very dark burgundy, almost a black cherry color with a tan head that has little retention. Fairly light aroma, hints of a caramel coffee. Starts with a bitter hop flavor that is quickly followed by a coffee and spice taste. Lingering roasted malty flavor. Decent mouth feel, a bit strongly carbonated. Pretty drinkable, might pick up another, but wouldn't go out of the way."
"Good brew, enjoyable and balanced. About right for a cold, snowy night in Cleveland."
"Not a bad beer. Don't know why these Rogue ales are so expensive, they are quite competent yet never best of their class. A decent beer."
"Overall a vibrant and fresh winter warmer. Very nice."
"Edit: Bought another bomber, this one really grows on you. Bumped up the mouthfeel number."
"Overall, its an ok beer. Like pretty much all winter warmers its nothing amazing, nor terrible. If you like winter warmers it might be your thing. Meh."
"I'd buy it again but not something I'd get excited about a store bringing in."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red with a giant tan foamy head. The head lasts forever and leaves great lacing. The smell is strong with cinnamon,alcohol,hops,and roasted malt. The taste is robust with roasted malt,dry hops,carmel,some holiday spices,and alcohol. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing pretty well. Not a bad beer,but you can find much better winter warmers out there."
"Makes it to above two fingers of dark tan hued foam, not dense enough to retain very long, however, leaves a formidable amount of lacing behind. Dark mahogany brown with rust reddish tinge, fully opaque haze, more burnt orange at the rims. Subdued nose of hard toffee, dark chocolate, roasted coffee and nutmeg, piney at times but without the sap, not much fruit, dense and lacking in movement. Medium to full-bodied, leverages its weight to impress even as, in the nose, sacrificing any sense of progression. Burnt wood notes, pine, caramelized brown sugar, dried maple syrup. There's not denying the hoppy bitterness right down the middle. Cinnamon spiced latte, cola bean, never really comes close to being sweet. No fruit, some white grapefruit pith. Grassiness elevates through the finish. Whereas many ""winter warmer"" beers play up the sweetness and try to stay cuddly and friendly, this take is definitely aggressive and forces you to take it on its own terms. Me, I could take it or leave it."
"overall a very nice winter brew."
"On-tap at Woody's City Market served a dark amber almost brown with a decent light-tan head. Aroma is pine hops and burnt caramel. The taste is a nice blend of burnt caramel, burnt toast, and bitter pine hops, paired with that distinctive Pacman yeast characteristic, this is a very tasty brew. The beer is medium bodied with smooth carbonation. I must admit, being from North Carolina I hold all Winter Warmers to the standard set by Highland Cold Mountain Winter, and while the style had a wide range, this one is likely the best on I've had that's on the hoppy side!"
"D- High. One is more than enough, but I really, really, really like this beer. I will buy some more... congrats, Rogue... this beer is a home run!"
"D: Pretty drinkable. Probably won't seek it out again."
"- Overall this is a fantastic winter brew... and again, I can't say this enough.... it stands out way ahead of the others that are just a basic porter with a scoop of dirt shoveled in. Credit to Rogue for perfecting this and bottling it!"
