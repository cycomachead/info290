"Overall, started out with good potential, even after the first sip, but really faltered from there. Still a solid brew, but not DH's best, so don't go out of your way for this one."
""
""
"Reminds me of the Southern Tier Warlock."
""
"Overall, this is an aggressively spicy, flavorful brew that could only be appropriate for the season.  I’m not especially keen on allspice to begin with, and in this case it’s far from balanced.  I had this on tap a couple months ago and recall a much mellower brew, so I’m not sure which experience is more representative of the brewers’ intention."

"Nice warm winter Ale, perfect for a cold winter day after shoveling some snow."
""
"O- A very unique take on a winter warmer which has me scratching my head on whether I truly like it or not.  In the end, I dig it for the plain fact that it's so smooth for how strong it is.  Also, there's a complexity to it that you don't find in most winter warmers.  Truly its own unique beer."
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent warmer, nailing all those classic spices and bringing more to the palate than just a sugar rush and a mess."
""
"On tap at Side Door, Madison.  Whoa.  That's some serious flavor.  Too sweet for me, though."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good winter warmer and worth getting."
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Heavy on the palate, with that potent dose of winter spice. I also get a little chocolate undertone happening, and a bittersweet finish that definitely packs some heat. Overall, a solid and enjoyable winter warmer."
""
"Over all im glad I tired this beer while it was around. Would love to try the barrel aged version if I can find a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great winter warmer ale, spices are not overwhelming and the beer's flavor is complimented by the added spices. I'd drink it twice."
""
""
"This beer had way too much spice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer looks and tastes fantastic.  Up front it's like a nice trappist quad, but it finishes a little hoppy.  Definitely recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"3.3/5: Far from perfect, but it's definitely not boring, either"
""
""
"Too much clove or allspice for me. Great dark brown color though."
""
"Tasted from a twelve ounce bottle on December 23, 2014."
"Very particular about winter Warmers the idea of a gingerbread flavored beer sounds great and it smelled wonderful but it was a little overpowering on the taste. I feel like the strong sugary flavor needs to be a tad more subtle like in Lagunita's Brown Shugga. Still a pretty good and festive beer though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O=Unique change of pace...recommend as an after dinner desert beer.  I am going to cellar the other 3 bottles until next year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Too much clove for me."
""
""
""
"The only thing questionable to me, was the aroma... Will have to test more from different glasses and places. Taste is very holiday, scotch ale / mild stout."
""
"An interesting and aromatic winter brew that tastes more like a bland imperial stout than a winter warmer.  It's not bad, just slightly uninteresting in the flavor.  Otherwise, it'd be a great stout.  Worth a try but probably not a revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It is pretty much what it claimed to be: A big, holiday, spice beer. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""

"Great for the holidays by a warm fireplace. I originally gave this a lower rating but I just had it on tap at one of my favorite bars and it's even better. A great winter beer from Dark Horse."

"Overall - a delicious warmer, darker style with lots of spiciness."
""
"Pours burnt caramel and very cloudy.  The low head is a light tan and dissapated quickly.   Once in the chilled imperial pint glass its medium body is almost opeque,  you can only see light through the edges of the glass.  The spices really come out in the aroma.   Cinnamon,  nutmeg,  and allspice mix in with molasses making me think of sitting in front of a fireplace with a cigar in my favorite holiday sweater during a week long blizzard.   The spices stand out from the first gulp.   Nutmeg is almost overpowering but the other spices come through and combine richly with the molasses in the end.   The beer does have a bit of a medicinal or alcoholic taste but overall it balances nicely and isn't a real hard drink. Overall I would recommend buying it in singles but a definite must try."

"Pleasant and warming winter warmer."

"O - Anyone who relishes the supper spicy holiday beers will enjoy this offering.  For me it is just a jumble of spices.  A subtle hand would server this beer better."

"L=3.0, A=3.5, T=-4.0, MF=3.75, D=3.5"
""
""
""
""
"O) I'm sure it's a well crafted brew, but the spice blend here was just not enjoyable for me. It was like my mouth was trapped in a candle shop."
""
"Overall one of the better winter warmers I have had.  Might be too sweet to have multiple at a time, but overall a great holiday beer"
""
"This is one of my favorite winter ales and really sets itself apart from many others. A very unique beer that is wonderful."

"Drinking it kind of late in the year. Poured with huge chunks. Won’t be finishing it because of that. Christmas nutmeg spiced aroma. Not bad smelling. Taste fine to. Dark cocoa taste with lots of cinnamon nutmeg flavors. The chunks is the only off putting thing."

"...update a half hour later... I let the last 3 ounces warm up a bit. The sweet and spice mixes better than when cold, and the crisp edge is way mellowed... The mouthfeel didn't flatten out all that much. In my opinion, to do this beer justice, it has to be served a bit warmer than the typical beer... It's a different story. I updated my taste and overall ratings - they were set to 3.25 cold, but I'm making them 3.75 based on the taste when it is a bit warmer."
""
""
"Poured into a goblet. Almost completely opaque very dark reddish brown. Poured with a 1 finger bubbly head that was gone by the time I carried it to table. Small amount of lacing remained. Aroma was flightly fruity sweet, kind of a smokey spiced grape juice. Nicely flavored, a bit sweet, but not overly so. A bit of banany clove flavor. Felt good in the mouth, nicely coated, a bit of stick, not much carbonation. Overall a good example of a winter warmer without being too heavily spiced."
""
""
""
"O- A very unique beer and a different take on the winter warmer."
""
""
""
"Overall, an odd, spiced, somewhat fruity, and very malty and bitter version of a winter warmer. Not sure how I feel about this one, except that the spices and dull bitterness throughout are a definite drawback."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors."

"I was thinking and looking for a little less dry and a little sweeter malt from this beer to really boost my overall enjoyment. If you like black IPAs, you might enjoy this beer."
""
"The first bar I had this at had it listed in the 5% range. I was pretty sure it was a weee bit stronger… but at almost 9% I had no idea!"
"O: 12 Dogs of Christmas is my only comparison for the style, but this was slightly better. This is more balanced overall."
"Overall, this an enjoyable holiday offering. Everything works well together here in a very drinkable winter warmer/spiced ale."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark, slight head, slight lacing. Nose is nutty with fall and savory spice and chocolate. Bitter and pungent flavor. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
"This one is a medium-heavy bodied beer. Leaves just a little residue on the back of the tongue. Very good."

"Dark Horse 4 Elf ---4/5."
""
""
"O:it's a nice one for these breezy nights.Not my favorite winter warmer but not my least favorite.Worth a try."
""
"O-overall a great winter warmer I would be interested what the bourbon would taste"
""
"The body is medium, and the hard bite of the crispness is consistent. A little dryness kicks in, and it feels like it wants to get smoother as it goes but that kick keeps it hard."
""
""
"O - Drinking this on Christmas Eve and it literally warms your soul. Exactly what a Christmas warmer should do."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a winter warmer. Good spice presence with the sweet dark malt."

"Overall: Some Porter/Stout notes with this Spiced Winter Warmer. It actually reminds me of a ramped up Anchor Christmas Ale, which is mostly a good thing, but this beer is not quite as harmonious. Still, this is a good choice for the Holidays."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is classic spiced winter warmer, and a bit boozy. The aftertaste is just spice. I am just not in the frame of mind for this style, and I am tired of it."
""
""
""
""
"Lots of clove, rum, brown sugar, chocolate, cinnamon, and sweet roll. Hearty and spicy and semi-dry. Perfect warming quality in the stomach, not in the mouth. Only a thin booziness is noticeable on the tongue. Some dried fruits and faint orange peel. Maybe a kiss of star anise. Really great spice composition with a boost of malt base. Feels nice and bold with an enveloped bite. A great experience drinking this for the first time."
"Overall, an ok winter warmer but far from great. The flavors are just too muddled and the sweetness needs to be dialed back a bit. Not one I will be seeking out."
""
"O: This is a nice beer but it's a little too astringent."
"Overall not bad, I'm glad most breweries are keeping the spices in check this year, and not going overboard. The slimy yeast sludge is the only real issue I have with it, also maybe a little too syrupy overall."
""
"Despite the boozy taste the feel is not overly warm or abrasive. It poured relatively thick but was more moderate in its fullness."
""
"Overall its pretty much what I expect in a winter warmer, huge dose of cinnamon and nutmeg balanced with a base beer which I assume is an imperial brown. Worth a try but I will stick to plead the 5th for a true warmer."
""
"Overall: This beer is okay. It smells great, looks the way it should and is drinkable."
""
"O: Bold but one-dimensional. Would be very nice if both the spice and alcohol were turned down a notch"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not a fan and could not finish it. way too strong on the nutmeg"
"I absolutely love the balance of 4 Elf as its spices are restrained enough so that no one type stands out. Also the ratio of sweet to spice is spot on as I go back and forth with each sip about which pulls ahead. This Dark Horse offering will likely be a standout of this holiday season. So, what's up with Dark Horse and random numbers during this time of year?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a little too high in ABV to be one that you would drink several during a session but it is an enjoyable Winter Warmer (maybe a touch too spice heavy for my preference but very well constructed)."
""
"I like this beer, it definitly has the Christmas spirit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've been on a quest of sorts for some years now to find the perfect winter warmer, which I'm still convinced is a real thing that exists somewhere. I've been consistently surprised with Dark Horse brews, and this is no exception, but the one winter warmer to rule them all it is not."

"Great Holiday Beer, Thanks"
""

""
""
"A nice ""festive winter"" brew. But the clove is so overwhelming."
""
""
""
"Overall - A really nice beer. Loads of flavor, heavy on spices, but has some fruit flavor to balance it out some. Drinks rather smooth for being 8.75%, a great winter warmer, id drink again and this isn't one of my preferred stlyes."
""
"Pours into a becker a deep roasted walnut brown with a creamy half finger tan colored head atop,great color and love the creamy head.Winter mulling spice and sweet alcohol in the nose,alot of nutmeg is detected.Lower carbonation with a creamy feel,it slides down easy.Spicy to the hilt on the palate with some cake-like notes,like a CHRISTmas spiced cake,the alcohol sweetness gets bigger as it warms.This a winter sipper,like others have noted, you can't drink to much of it,a full on spicy winter warmer here."
" Taste-Like a liquid Christmas cookie. Nutmeg, raisins, cinnamon,chocolate, vanilla and spice cake. Gently warming finish, nicely balanced, flavorfull and festive. A great match with holiday cookies while wrapping gifts."
""

"Dark porter-esque appearance light khaki tan head, fine speckled lacing sporadic yet satisfying in it's look. Aroma has a dark cola like sweetness, blended with candy cane and other assorted spices, honey, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. Flavor dark chocolate creamy lactose, a barrage of spices, provides bitterness and balance it's like pureed candy cane and Christmas tree pine in an imperial cream stout form. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied carbonation is creamy smooth with lingering spices between sips, overall the type of winter warmer that is so different it's actually a joy to experience."
"This was my first time having 4 Elf. It's a solid holiday brew. It's unique and different from alot of spiced holiday beers. It has some stout/porter qualities to it. It's good stuff, but it didn't get me overly excited. It's worth checking out though. It's definitely fitting for the holidays."
""
""
"Pours dark brown, almost black with a 1 finger dark khaki head. Lots of roasted caramel in the aroma. As well as nutmeg, clove, slight cinnamon, vanillia, and hint of gingerbread. Smells of Christmas. Toasted gingerbread and roasted caramel come through first in the taste. Followed mid palate by vanillia and finishes slightly bitter. Also getting some strong root beer tastes toward the end. Slightly over carbonated. ABV is hidden very well and feel is slightly thicker than medium bodied. Decent price, decent flavor, decent brew."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Medium body and high carbonation keeps it pretty drinakable."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"overall liked it but not amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed the Clove taste as well as the allspice. I am not sure my pallet is refined enough to pick out the nutmeg, especially since I really have never had nutmeg (as a taste that was distinct like nutmeg during the holidays nutmeg). I have been drinking mystic chai spiced hot tea and I can taste some similarities. Which is cool because this is a brew! I did feel a warmth in my stomach while picking up leaves (which may be because it was cold or because that is the way the beer is designed?). Either way I would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a good example of the style, unlike a lot of Winter Warmers the spices weren't overdone and and it didn't taste as strong as I thought it would for being 8.75%. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean and the taste held my attention I think two of these would be just the right amount for me. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, neither the malts or the spices were too overpowering. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I really disliked about it and I can't think of anything I would change to make it better. I would buy this again and I would like to keep some around for the holidays. I would recommend this to anybody who generally likes Winter Warmers. All in All I was happy with this beer and I'm glad it wasn't over spiced. Thanks for distributing this beer Dark Horse, I see what it's popular and it's nice to be able to get this beer without having to take a trip to the 4 Elf release party. Good job guys, keep up the good work."
""
""
""
""
"If you don't like cinnamon then avoid this one because it dominates the palate."
" Overall I would say that I will definitely be adding this to the already expansive roster of Dark Horse beer that I thoroughly enjoy."
""
""
""
"Way too spicy for my palate, with a roast malt backbone that comes off as being somewhat acrid. Not a fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I tried this back in January and the spices held up quite nicely. I like the fact that the roasted malt flavor is there, or this would just be a holiday spice beer."
""
"O-Pretty decent. Never had a winter warmer and I'm drinking it during the summer so the experience probably isn't the best it could be. The spices are too strange and I could not drink more than 1 in a sitting. Overall a decent brew."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, its a cinnamon bomb with not too many qualities that I enjoy - and I really like winter warmers. This just didnt hit the right notes for me."
""
"I honestly never heard of this one, but I quite liked it. Dark brown pour with a small tan head that left a bit of lacing on the glass. Nice spicy aroma, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, with a touch of icing-like sweetness. In the taste, all the spices that were there in the aroma, plus rich caramel maltiness, and a little vanilla icing; light herbal hops and roasty bitterness for balance. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel, quite enjoyable overall."
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, Winter 2012 bottling. Pours cloudy almost opaque dark reddish brown color with a small light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, dark bread, brown sugar, toffee, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, earth, roasted malt, chocolate, and light herbal. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and spice notes. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, dark bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, roasted malt, chocolate, toast, prune, earth, and light herbal spiciness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, dark fruit, dark bread, brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, roasted malt, chocolate, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of robust flavors; with a nice malt backbone over the spices; and almost zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice winter warmer style. Very nice robust and balanced flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"O - Overall, a basic, solid beer that I could have again. Quite sessionable for the strenght."
""
""
"Overall, I like this beer I've had past incarnations that were higher in abv, and as much as I wish this one was closer to past versions...I'm happy with this one."
""
""
"o - meh. dark horse beers are hit or miss for me, and this one is a miss. lacks most of the things i look for in a winter warmer, mainly the malty sweetness and a subdued hop profile. probably won't be returning to this one."
""
"A classic example of ""too far"" for me; I don't put this much spice in my mulled apple cider. Spicing is out of control & overwhelms the beer, & gets too close to being straight-up undrinkable. As is? An almost-average novelty."
""
""
"O: Awesome winter warmer. Great variety of spices and balance of flavors. Nice roasted malt fits in nicely without making it a real porter or stout. Expertly crafted."
""
""
"M: Full bodied. But seems nicely carbonated"
""
"O- did DH F this beer up? The label says 8.75% and it says 11.5% on here. It seems like they changed the recipe and it turned out terrible and they said F it we'll sell it anyways."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very potent, flavorful and spicy winter warmer. The alcohol is hidden very well. Thanks again, jbck109!"
""
""
""
"O - A tasty winter warmer that's head up well over the last few months."
"I've only had one other beer that hid 11% this well without using excessive amounts of residual sugar to to it, that's the other ""Elf"" out of Harrisburg/Hershey. Not an everyday beer, but a nice seasonal sipper. I'm glad I have four more in my cellar."
""
""
"Overall, this is another nice brew from Dark Horse. They might go down in my books as the kings of hiding alcohol. At first I would have guessed this was a 6% beer. There is absolutely no heat in the taste, and I don't really get any when it goes down either. As always, they've managed to balance this quite well as well. Glad I snagged a bottle of this."
"O: This wasn't awful. Compared to the rest in its style I actually think it's really good. But overall? Not a fan."
"330ml bottle.Snifter glass.Enjoyed on oct´11.Dark mahogany in color.Off-white crown,fairly good retention.Caramel malt,chocolate,toasted malt aromas.Intense aromatic spicy:cinnamon,clove,nutmeg.Sweet bitter upfront followed by sweet malty flavor.Smooth astringency.Full body,correct carbonation.Dry prune & molasses on the finish lasting to the aftertaste.Pleasant drinkability."
"By the way there is no way this beer is 11.55%"
"Overall - A strange dichotomy of nice flavors and a disappointing finish. I'll finish the glass no problem, but the aftertaste is pretty off-putting."
""
"Cost: $12 for a four pack."
""
""
"Never thought of trying this brew until it came to my attention especially being a Dark Horse fan. Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours roasty brown with a thin off-white head that recedes quite quickly. Aromas of nutmeg, brown sugar, cinnamon, and some orange. Bit disappointed with the taste as it did not mirror the delicious aromatics as initially indicated. Flavors of dark fruit, indistinct spices- perhaps some nutmeg? Somewhat bittery back finish. As mysterious as the flavor is, I am at loss of how well hidden the high alochol is! Medium-bodied with nice carbonation throughout. As the beer warmed up a bit, the more I found myself to enjoy this one. I would gladly have this one again on a cold winter night."
""
"3/3/3.5/3.5/3.5"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a really nice surprise. I don't dig on holiday spicetasticness, but this was the best of what I find to be a lame style. Really well played Dark Horse!"
"Tastes like christmas; still subtle though."
""
""
""
"4 Elf is nothing short of outstanding. The most flavorful winter warmer I've had to date. If you like gingerbread cookies, then you will love this beer. It truly tastes and feels like a snowy winter night. Well worth seeking out."
"O: Very nice Christmas Ale from Dark Horse, one of the best I've had. Looking forward to cracking open my 2009 Vintage later this evening to compare."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The age did this beer well. Still warming, but much smoother. I'd have another."
""

"Full bodied great carb. Super sticky, lingers like a nice coffee."

"Easily my favorite winter beer ever along with Samichlaus. This strong winter warmer packs in tons of flavors reminiscent of cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and allspice. Every winter I frequent dark horse a lot to get my hands on lots of this. Like I said, best winter beer. ever."
"O: This was one of the better spicy/herbal winter beers I've had."
"4.5 T: I am a pretty big fan of the style and this is a more than solid example of it. Good all around."
"Overall this was a solid beer for the style, and the alcohol was hidden remarkably well. Worth a shot."
"D - Not my usual cup of ale. Good to try."
"12oz. bottle shared with Thirstybird. Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights around the base. Head eventually dissipates into a thin band and a soapy skim. Nose expresses allspice, licorice and sassafras. Taste reveals chocolate, roast, spice, sassafras, licorice and slightly bitter, earthy hops. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an even, crisp carbonation. Complex and interesting with an amazingly well-hidden abv - I can hardly believe it comes in at 11.5%."
"D- as a fan of dark horse's stouts, i liked this one very much. one that i would pick up every year if the bottles were sold in my area. glad i had the chance to try this. very spicy, but well done and not too over the top."
"Gets better as it warms up. Prolly better with age."
"D- This is astoundingly drinkable for the alcohol content. The flavors are mild enough to keep it form becoming too rich. This has aged nicely."
"Overall, a very good beer that will probably age very well."
"DH- Keep it up."
"The beer pours out very dark, much darker than I expected. It has nightlights if chestnut and mahogany. Not much of a head. The spices are sweetand aromatic. Up close it smells like a malty rich strong ale. Lots of ginger bread, Nutmeg, cherries and light cinnamon. Spices are pretty big, but quite unique. Equally as big is a deep maltiness. Gingerbread, dried cherries, toffee, cocoa, raisin. It starts strong but the finish is lackluster. Carbonation is pretty high and the body leaves me wanting more heft. This its almost like a fruitcake in a glass. One of the more interesting winter warmers."
"D: Very good. Don't have a ton of experience with spiced brews but I really liked this one. Went well with my meal and would be a great Christmas brew"
"Pours brown and clean. Not much going on in the pour. A good amount of smooth white head with some nice lacing on the glass. Smells like spices... christmas in a bottle. But different from your average christmas ale. Much more spiced and herbal. Tastes strongly of herbs and nutmeg. Some other spices come through fairly strongly. Decent mouthfeel and very drinkable"
"d - A nice spiced beer. I really enjoyed the smell, but the high ABV definitely comes through a bit in the taste. Would have again."
"The spices are all I taste, maybe some caramel malts, definitely no hops. This probably hits the winter warmer style, it's just not my style. Long linger of spices on the tongue. Not recommended for me to try ever again, but probably those who like spiced beers will like it."
"Overall a beer I'm glad I tried, but I would choose other holiday spiced ales for my liking. As this beer warms, the flavors do open up and get rounder - less cinnamon and more dark roasted malts. The body is very nice, very creamy and soothing. Definitely a cold weather beer. A nice winter warmer but too much cinnamon and heat for my taste."
"D: Very tasty. What I drank really filled me up so I wouldn't want more than 1 in a sitting but would drink again"
"Thanks again to Dan for bringing this one on Saturday. I have been a Dark Horse fan for a while now, but this is my first time trying this one. Poured a dark brown color with a bit of off-white head. Very reminiscent of Christmas, with a big clove aromas, which leads to a bunch of other holiday spices. On the palate, this one is medium bodied and smooth, with tons of clove, a little vanilla and caramel."
"Very tasty winter warmer picked up last December in Detroit. Pours dark brown, without a noticeable head, yet some carbonation still there. Conifers and cinammon dominate the smell, ginger predominates the taste, a bit of nutmeg. Spicy sweetness, though not too sweet. Tasty. Average mouthfeel."
"D-this is very tasty, dark horse is ""infamous"" for making huge abv beers extremely drinkable and this falls right into that category. Where do they put 11.5% alcohol in this?"
"4 Elf looks very dark with a big 1/2 inch or more of a off white head with tannish glint to it. Some minor stickage to the glass. Smells sweet and spicy with holiday spices, malt background, some cinnamon and candycanes. Taste consist of dark fruit with some cherry as well backed by spices including nutmeg. Alot of sweetness with the candycanes and caramel, no toffee. Some minimal chocolate. Feel is medium and coating, spicy and sweet at the same time, a hint of alcohol. I would love to get ahold of more of this in the wintertime so I could enjoy it more, for sure something to warm up to. I had no doubt that this would be big considering the brewer but it is surprisingly drinkable, not cloying, well made."
"D- nicely drinkable for the style and I'm not usually a fan. I like this one though, and in fucking july. I bet I'd like it more in the right season. Ill say this there is no sign of the abv. Ill be sure to keep my eye out for more in the fall."
"Pours dark with a tan head, when held up to light seems a really dark reddish color. Smells like delicious ginger snaps, cinnamon and some clove. I tasted ginger, cinnamon, allspice and some cloves with an alcohol finish. Delicious. It has a medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Definitely a sipper, but a very good sipper."
"Drinks amazingly- the spice covers the bite very well here."
"Pours a deep cloudy brown with very little head. The aroma is very spicy with a quantity of cinnamon and maybe cloves. The taste us way spicier than the aroma would make me think. Extremely thick, I think that it might be better if I were to drink it in a colder clime. It just tastes overly thick and boozy for me."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like but not bad. This is exceptionally drinkable and will be looking for this next winter."
"D- This was a interesting beer that I seemed to really really love. I need to make sure that pick some more of this up next time I'm at the brewery. Dark Horse does no wrong yet once again!"
"A good winter warmer but it would be hard to drink more than one of these in a sitting. Having said that I wouldn't mind having another of these for latter"
"This is an excellent spiced beer, very big for the style, almost reminds me of a pumpkin porter. Extremely tasty."
"A very solid winter warmer, very drinkable, especially for the ABV. Others at the tasting didn't think much of it, saying it was overspiced, but I thought it was great."
"D: Drinkable as hell. I reallly liked this beer. Wish I had one to have on christmas morning."
"Overall, this is a massive beer for the style. I can't believe the abv on this beer. I am really glad I got to try it. It was a good experience. I think this is a one and done however."
"D: The spice and alcohol get to you after a bit, but are still delicious. Adding a bit more body, and perhaps a little more sweetness would really turn this into a delightful brew. Still quite good by any measure."
"Overall- quite a different brew. this might be my first winter warmer and i can tolerate it. i recommend anyone to give this one a try."
"The warmest and most satisfying winter warmer I have had yet. Great beer."
"It's one of the better and more satisfying winter beers I've had."
"Happy Holidaze!"
"D: Continuing on from my shock, I cant believe this beer is this big. It drinks like a 6% beer and is something I could have a few of in the night which would cause problems"
"This is a great beer for lovers of pumpkin beers. I think a lot of people will like this, but the spices just don't appease my palate."
"Drinkability- Considering the size of the brew and the intensity of the spices it's actually really tasty. The chocolate and spices are intense and pretty much awesome. Nice change of pace this time of year and a good beer. That's saying something too considering Winter Warmers aren't my favorite."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and smooth. The malt body here is well placed and the alcohol is never too much in the flavor. This ends up being quite warming in the end and the mix of spices really work. I personally enjoy the forward clove aspect. A stellar spiced brew from Dark Horse. Paired well with some Carr Valley Menage cheese and fun to drink in the summer. Thanks hoppymeal!"
"To start off, this was a very interesting brew that I am glad I sampled. Brew poured a black translucent color w/ a one finger cream head. Had the look of a black tea w/ carbonation. Laced the glass nicely and it pretty much stuck around for the remainder of the tasting. The nose was a real treat w/ the aromas of chai tea, vanilla, ginger, clove, and nutmeg. The taste was pretty much on par as expected w/ a finish of mild bittering hops. For 11% ABV this brew was surprisingly drinkable due to the herbs/spices masking well. The mouthfeel was a little thin for my taste - wanted this to be slightly creamier. Overall, this brew was very unique, interesting, and enjoyable. Glad I got the chance to sample, but don't think I will be seeking this one out again, due to it reminding me more of tea than beer. This brew was more of a mind expander than anything for me."
"Drinkability: For those who like a nice spicy Winter Warmer, this beer is the real McCoy; a bit too high in alcohol to drink more than one"
"I've had two bottles of this sitting in my fridge for a while. The thought of cracking one and venturing into the unknown seemed a daunting task for such an unwilling Holiday voyager. Had I known the joy this beverage would bring, I would have cracked it sooner. I'm very happy to have one more bottle of this."
"Thanks Alex.. Thanks Dark Horse"
"D: I didn't didn't look at the alcohol content until I started typing this paragraph. The 11.5% is hidden pretty well by all of the spice going on here. It started coming out a little as it began to warm. Pretty much a one and I'm done...but it was immensely enjoyable 'till the bottom of the glass."
"This is good complex seasonal brew."
"Glad I got to try this, but it's not really my kind of thing."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of spices (nutmeg and light cinnamon) with a well balanced sweet roasty malt body. Taste is also very well balance between some sweet malt with notes of nutmeg and light cinnamon and maybe some white pepper? Body is about average with good carbonation and a nice creamy body and no apparent alcohol. Very well done with great balance while being easily drinkable."
"Way more spicy than I care for, but it would probably pair up well with fresh gingerbread or rumcake."
"A very solid winter warmer. Nicely spiced and really shows through on the middle and finish. Same tastes as the nose would suggest. Slightly too much spice for my liking however which skewed the score somewhat. Otherwise one of my favorite spice winter warmers I've had the pleasure of tasting."
"4 Elf is an excellent holiday beer. It's absolutely loaded with holiday spice flavor. While it's not exactly novel in that sense, the spicy flavor is definitely unique. Cinnamon comes through very strong, but it works soooo well. I have only one slight complaint and that's that the nose is just a little weak. It wouldn't take much to work out that kink. It's a close call as it is. Nevertheless, 4 Elf is excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"D - This is how a winter spiced beer should taste. Malty with good spice presence but not overwhelming. Perfect to sip by a warm fire."
"Poured a deeper brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of lots of spices (ginger, cinamon, and a bunch of others), chocolate, and I was getting some berries in there too. The spices were definitely the strongest of the aromas. Tastes of the same spices, chocolate, and caramel. This one was all about the spices."
"Black body, thin cap of tan foam. Pleasing aroma of gingerbread cookies, vanilla, nutmeg, the usual holiday cookie medley. Full bodied, creamy, slightly lactic feel. More stout than anything, which Dark Horse excels at. Dry spice notes similar to the nose, dominant gingerbread and vanilla/nutmeg. Not overly sweet, it's well balanced and unique for a winter warmer."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a quick one finger light tan head that falls to a thin layer of foam. Tiny bits of lacing remain on the sides of the glass, but not a whole lot. There is definitely some sediment floating around as well. Smell is a wonderful blend of gingerbread, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Chocolate malts, egg nog, and a good amount of nuttiness as well. Very pleasant aroma, nothing overdone or in your face. Taste is very similar to the aroma with a bit more spice. Nutmeg, ginger, and some pumpkin up front. Midway the rich malts emerge and lead to the spicy aftertaste. Once again, the flavors are in check, with nothing over the top crazy. Medium to full body with a rich feel and a prickly carbonation. There is a touch of alcohol, but it doesn't take away from the beer. By far one of the better Winter Warmers out there. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I definitely enjoyed this one. Hopefully I can crack open another one of these come Christmas 2009! Thanks again Craig!"
"Good mouth-feel, with some soft carbonation."
"Notes: Thanks to Craig for this, because I am a bitch."
"Overall, this is what every winter warmer should be. Another hit from Darkhorse."
"Absolutely amazing and everything I'd want from a Winter Warmer. I wish I could've picked up more of this, it's on par with 3 guys if you ask me. Definitely one of my favorite beers. I hope they keep brewing it."
"On tap at Dark Horse, served in a pint glass. Its a very deep brown color with a small brown head that fades away. Nose is malty cinnamon, vanilla, and some sprucey winter notes. Kinda like a christmas wreath candle. Taste is heavy malts with almond and chocolate. Some alcohol on warming. Wintery. Smooth. Nice holiday beer."
"Bottle procured somehow by kkulacki (he got engaged across the state the day this was released, so i have no idea how he got this) and generously sent to me. Pours surprisingly dark with a short brown head. Laces slowly and tightly. Smells magnificent...strong nutmeg and allspice with well-brewed coffee and dark chocolate. Flavor great too, big holiday spiced front (again, nutmeg and allspice, with a hint of hot cinnamon). Spices very strong, but supported well by a chocolate malt body and well balanced but warming alcohol. Full bodied. A bigger than life but extremely enjoyable winter warmer. Thanks again, Konrad!"
"I feel like a sod, having drank this in July. It *really* would be a great sipping beer in front of my fireplace on a dark winter night."
"I'm not completely sure about the style of this beer, so if somebody else knows better than correct it for me. I do know that this beer was spiced up bigtime! It was also very dark and very thick. The initial taste was of a thick burnt malt flavor. That was followed by some spices mainly ginger with a few others. A slight floral hop flavor came but went very quickly because more spices came along the lines of nutmeg and (cardamon?). I don't know what exactly all the spices were but I do know that they worked well in this beer. I couldn't have too many of these though because they were very filling."
