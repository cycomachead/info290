"O:  Good, but not great.  I can say that I can't think of a particular Winter Warmer at the time."
"1/10...pours reddish brown, 1/2 inch white/off white foam. Sticks strong. Dark fruit nose, cherries, plums. Fruity undercurrent taste, thick mouthfeel. A little syrupy. Cough syrup bitter rolls through and drives an aftertaste. Offputting."

"Below flying dog standards imo."
"I expect more for a winter beer."

"Pervasive alcoholic taste, even for ""only"" being 7.4%."
""
"Poured out a medium clear brown with a thin off-white head. The head hangs on mostly around the circumference and leave some small sticky lacing. The aroma is mild but with dark fruit tones. The taste is not awful but has some odd notes of candied dark fruit. The body is fine, but is a little overly carbonated."

"Just awful. Tried it cold, tried it warm... Alcohol is about the only flavor detectable. Never'd buy it again."

"Pouring a deep chestnut color, K-9 Winter Ale gives off a deep malty brown sugar and slight hopping reminiscent of subtle orange citrus and pine.  There’s is a bizarre candy like note as well, that calls to mind smarties or bubble gum. There’s a compliment of chocolate and slightly smoke notes buried deeply in the background.  On the palate it starts out smooth, but incredibly light, and grows increasingly carbonated throughout.  The flavors channel more pine like hop notes, overcooked caramel, a subtly biscuit like nature.  On the finish the hops actually pick up and compliment a burnt caramel flavor, leaving a slightly bitter note."

"Very tasty.  Sad to see the negative reviews....  This beer is alright!"

"It tastes like chewing gum and brown sugar. Probably one of the worst flying dog beers I've had, if you don't include their lemongrass cerveza. 9 times out of ten, flying dog beers kill it, just for the record."

"I went with an aggro pour since nothing on the label suggested doing otherwise. There was an initial pseudo-cascade before I backed off, but I still ended up with three fingers of dense, rocky tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep-copper (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty, kind of nutty with an underlying spiciness like nutmeg. Believe it or not, I actually prefer drinking these kinds of beers when the temperature warms up. I truly prefer this sort of thing to most Hefeweizens, for instance. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the inherent heat in this one was immediately obvious on the tongue. Phew! Once the initial burn abated, I got flavors of dried dark fruits, spices and a bit of molasses. Finish was dry as a bone, rather hot, even after six months, giving greater weight to my waiting to drink it. I want to try this again in the Winter, just to see what it is like fresh, but this was quite good."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/18/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, light nuttiness, light roast, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast fruitiness; with solid strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, light roast, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, light roast, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice robustness and complexity of big dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast fruitiness; with minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English strong ale. Big robustness and nice complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O: This isn't a bad Winter Warmer if you like toffee flavors. Although no alcohol is perceptible in the taste, it will warm you up a bit and is a lot easier to drink compared to other beers in the style."

"K9 pours a darker amber color with a small lacing head. There really wasn't an aroma; smells like air. The taste had a nice sharp malty bite, with a good amount of spices. Good feel, decent flavors. Overall its a pretty average beer, enjoyable but nothing to special."
""

"This is an alright beer, but nothing too exciting and it becomes redundant quick. I can appreciate this, but it's not something I'd try again."

"Overall I wasn't a big fan of this beer and I didn't think it was a good example of a Winter Warmer, it wasn't a bad beer, but it was pretty bland and it wasn't very Winter Warmer like with such a low amount of spices, it was more similar to a Amber Ale or a Bock. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little rich, a little filling, and the taste didn't do a good job of holding my attention and I quickly got bored with it, so one is enough for me, I have no urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it was nice and it was the aspect with the least amount of things wrong with it. What I liked the least about this beer was how it isn't true to style, I haven't had a Winter Warmer that tasted this bland. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not very hard to find a much better Winter Warmer and I wouldn't recommend this beer to any of my friends. All in all this beer just wasn't for me, it didn't really live up to being called a Winter Warmer. This one is up there as one of me least favorite Flying Dog beers, better luck next time guys, this one needs some major work."

"Overall: A nice beer that can be swigged instead of just sipped by the fireside, embracing the taste of the season of nutmeg, cardamom, date, fig, and molasses and keeping the body to a drinkable level."
"Overall: Marzen style. This beer gets much better as it warms. Too much soda pop and booziness. Sip carefully. It's under-rated, but still just above average, the least of this season's winter warmers for me, with Widmer Brr at the top at 4.0."

"O: excellent marzen-style winter ale"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Again, big with the booziness. Even a little overblown for a warmer. Body is medium, and the carbonation might be a hair above that. A decent bite of beer, per sip."

"A basic and unexciting taste that is out of character for Flying Dog as their beers are usually always interesting and worth trying. This one started pretty slow but did have some nice caramel malts and some fruits somewhere around the middle but it wasn't enough to save the drink I'm afraid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very pleasant beer with a strong malt character. Would be an awesome beer to sip by a roaring fire during the winter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure why this rates so low of a score. It is better than that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not an overwhelming flavor, certainly something smooth and relaxing for a cold winter night. Wouldnt mind just a bit more spice or a more complex malt profile."
"Poured from bottle into ommegang tulip. Pours a syrup color brown with moderate head. Good hop and syrupy booze aromas. Sweet syrup and malt flavor with minimal spice. Its slightly hopped but its noticeable. Overall not something id reach for all the time but a good sweet malty nicely spiced warmer."
""

""

"Overall, this does not work for me and I will not seek it out again."
""
""
"This is a rather simple beer. It is prominently caramel in flavor with very faint notes otherwise. The bitterness in the finish is more intense than it should be. There isn't much here to separate this beer from any other winter offering. I'm glad to have tried this once, but I won't be seeking it out again."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is creamy and mild, with light carbonation, a medium body and a funky aftertaste that is on the dry side. This was kind of blah, and overall on the dull side. Not a beer I’d seek out again, nor would I buy it if it weren’t in the mixed 12 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. It is a decent tasting beer just nothing to go out of your way for. It kinda reminds me of some wet hopped beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, faint cinnamon. Nothing really jumps out at you in this brew. Tastes o.k. but everything is kind of muted and laid back. A middle-of-the-road offering from a brewery that has a lot of better beers to offer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flying Dog K-9 Winter Ale ---3.5/5."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Just an average winter warmer that uses unhidden ABV instead of a nice warming finish. Lazily made in my opinion."
""
""
"O: ST's 2XMAS planted a seed of doubt toward my general dislike of winter warmers. Even if it's not a great example of the style, this makes me remember why I don't really care for the typical winter warmer. It feels off for some reason."
""
""
"O- Drinkable, but nothing mind blowing."
"Morey's Bottom Line: It's not as bad as the score suggest, but it's not super memorable either. It's average and lost in a sea of winter warmers and Christmas ales."
""
"Flying Dog really is a crazily hot-or-miss brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So I'm mostly getting an aspirin like bitterness from this beer, without much else to redeem it. Very little mouthfeel, very little flavor, just all around disappointing."
""
"O: Nothing impresses me here. It looks nice, but the aroma and flavor are bland or relatively one-dimensional."
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, herbal hops, and a nutty aroma. Taste is much the same with a somewhat high herbal hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer with an astringently bitter flavor that is somewhat unpleasant."

"Out of a bottle this beer was a perfectly clear, garnet color with one finger of khaki colored head. The retention was ok at first but it soon was little more than a needle-thin collar that left only a few small spots of lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, toffee and a hint of floral hops. The flavors were of caramel malt, toffee, diacetyl, nuts, toasted malt, burnt toast and then a finish which was a bit to herbal/medicinal and didn’t quite balance out properly. Distinctly bitter on the finish but it wasn’t a ‘clean’ finish. The mouthfeel was frothy and slick, the body medium and the carbonation a bit high. Rather average overall but by no means unpleasant."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. has a deep copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a touch of malts. Taste is also on the mild side, some malts, lightly hopped, kind of weak. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am thinking English sort of slight hoppy strong ale here, not so much a winter warmer. It's still very tasty though, so no worries there."
""
"O-if i didn't know better, i would say this is a boozey BMC version of a winter warmer...except the only BMC winter warmer i've had (winter's boubon cask ale) was a lot better than this. its just harsh. i tried it because i've been seeing it everywhere i go, but now i can't understand why any bar would want this."
""
""
"O - Flying Dog's K-9 cruiser is an enjoyable winter beer. It's sweet and with nice seasonal spices. A solid seasonal offering."
""
""
""
"Trying the Flying Dog K-9 Cruiser this cold Chicago winter's night. The beer pours clear amber with thin almost non-exsistent white head. The smell is mostly caramel type malt with undertones of spice. The taste is good combo of spice and caramel malt. The mouthfeel is a nice medium body with so so carbonation. Overall it is a decent winter ale."
""
""
""
"O= a very worthy offering that I'll look forward to finding next holiday season as well."
""

"This brew is reminiscent of a couple Christmas Ales that I have had, this is a very enjoyable winter beer."
""
""
""
""
"on tap at winghearts burger joint in downtown pittsburgh. pours a slightly cloudy cherrywood red color with a dying head. smells fairly basic, malty and seasonal, a little sharp from the alcohol. flavor is slightly spiced, malt driven, and subtly hopped. its very dumbed down for a winter warmer, nothing over the top, which makes is very drinkable i suppose. overall it was a well made beer but fairly unremarkable in terms of excitement."
""
""
"Overall: A strange beer. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I like it. Might not buy it again (there are better Flying Dogs-- Raging Bitch, In Heat Wheat, etc) but definitely worth a try."
""
""
" I thought this beer was very good. Most reviews don't seem to agree so I'm guessing that the fact that my beers were drawn from the tap makes all the difference."
""
"Overall there was nothing really bad about the beer, nothing good either. Could use some retention and attenuation and a flavor boost."
"O - Well, not much of a Winter Warmer to me. It tastes more like an old muddy DIPA that just sat around to long. I didn't like the unbalanced flavor profile, and the smell was very basic to me. Perhaps I got an old one, but I don't think so. Not that good to me. I'd drink it again but not buy it again, and I would recommend you try another Winter Warmer before this one."
"o: eh, not liking this too much. Flying Dog always tries to steer clear of whats expected of a style but not in a way that i like."
"Hmmm - OK. A brown winter ale with a strange spicy note; coriander seems like an odd addition to a winter ale (if that's what it is). Smell/taste are a bit uneventful, and the body is watery. It's alright, but not amazing. Helps to confirm my opinion that american brown ales are not a style I like that much."
"O: This wasn't quite a drain pour, but it was definitely a meh beer with a capitol M!"
""
""
"Overall not a bad winter warmer. There are probably a handful of other winter warmers I would grab first. That pretty much sums up how I feel about FD as a whole. They have good beers, but there are so many other beers out there I would rather drink."
""
"O: This was a solid winter ale. Really smooth and went down way too easy."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light, and the carbonation almost seems to be missing. Overall, not too impressed. Had much better winters and won't be going back to this one again."
""
""
""
""
"Another beer that's getting bad ratings for god knows what reason."
""
"Malty brew, dark toast comes to mind. Minor complexity and pretty straight forward. Some honey and more sugary sweetness in the finish. Nothing special, but a decent holiday season sipper. 7.4% well in the back ground. Would just fine in a marinade for chicken or pork or as part of a sweet reduced sauce"
"O-eh, not too special"
""
""
""
""
"1.5 T: A couple ounces was way more than enough of this, but I drank the whole bottle anyway. What I would like to know is who the hell is buying this such that they haven't retired it? This beer sucks. Avoid."
"Something isn't being worked in this beer. Or maybe this is a sign that I really need to visit the slopes and adopt a dog."
"O: This beer looks fantastic, but the nose and taste are a bit off, and then there's that metallic taste and feel. Overall, I would call it a tie between this and Benedict's Winter Ale."
""
"o-too bad the mouthfeel doesnt have nice flavors to go along with it. this is just an average beer. it isnt downright awful, but it isnt anything exceptional either."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an amber color with a tight off-white cap. Some mild lace. The aroma is of earthy hops, sweet caramel, candi sugar, spice and some cherries. On the palate, toffee and candi sugar carry through the middle before some tart cherry, spice and earthy hops come through in the finish. Medium body, adequate carbonation. A pretty nondescript beer, that falls around average."
""
""
""
"Pours from the 12 oz bottle a dark copper color with a one finger head that quickly dissolves into a light lace. Moderate but lively carbonation. The aroma is of toasty, nutty malt. 1st sip brings a reprise of the aroma...toasty, nutty malt with a hint of dark chocolate. It starts off sweet, but quickly becomes dry in the middle with a very dry, bitter finish consisting of slight hop note & alcohol. Mouthfeel is solid. Overall, a pleasant, but not outstanding winter warmer."
"Very tame maltiness. There's a good touch of caramel and mild sweetness, in general. It's light and it's easy. Interesting smoothness to it. It's refreshing, but it's kind of bland. Nothing there that jumps out, but it's an easy to drink ale. I like some parts, and am indifferent toward other."
"O --- I'm a little disaapointed. I was expecting it to big one way or another. It's tame and not very memorable."
""
"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"Never the less it is a refreshing drinkable beer, but not what I expect of a Winterwarmer!"
""
"O-Although it tasted alright everything else about this beer was off base, a little flat, and not much there in the nose."
"Overall - It was pretty good. Again, a bit of metallic taste, but I thought overall, it was a decently put together beer."
"O: All in all a good winter beer. A bit more complexity would have be nice, but I enjoyed this effort. To me like a lighter Avery Old Jubilation. Worth a single bottle pickup for sure."
"This brew is reminiscent of the Wild Goose - Snow Goose. Seeing how Flying Dog use to brew the Wild Goose brand, I’m going to go out on a limb and say this is virtually the same exact beer. Regardless, this is a very enjoyable winter warmer."
"Overall - Very mediocre to not-very-good beer. Not highly recommended and barely drinkable."
"The body is more or less the balance of flavors - which sometimes tend in the brewery, to go in any direction - but we feel that this balance is right and it is undoubtedly one of best beers of the brewery."
"Easy sipper, just like a winter warmer should be I guess, but hardly inducing excitement in any fashion. Hops kept out of the taste, smoothness and warmth are in. Caramel, mild spice, brown sugar. Offputting bitterness in a warmer a few seconds after you tell yourself its smooth. Huh?"
"Poured out as a nice deep dark red color with a light tan head on top. The head fades into a thin ring around the glass. The smell of the beer has a spiciness to it and some malts that come through. The taste of the beer is also a little spicy and has a warming flavor to it. The mouthfeel is smooth, semi-thick and lightly carbonated. Overall I think this beer is a pretty nice Winter Warmer. I'd like to try it again in the future to see if my tastes have changed at all."
"Something a little coarse about this beer. There are so many great Christmas and winter beers this is one of the less interesting. Still, quite drinkable for a switch and plenty of flavor."
"2010 bottle into a pint glass on 5.24.11., this appears a clear brownish red under a thin but well sustained head. Aroma is that of dark roasted malt with a deep note of chocolate licorice and crisp floral hops. Deep toasted malt dominates the palate here, for the most part, with a well suited carbonation that lets the flavor dominate. Notes of sweet dark cocoa and toasted nut come through to me and there's a subtle hop bitterness throughout that restrains the malt feel to a favorable level. Overall, this is one of the more boozy ""winter warmers"" I've ever tried but as the brew nears closer to room temperature from the fridge climate, the alcohol feel truly does seem to subside and a nice caramel note begins to break through on the palate."
"Just like most Flying Dog beers, this is nothing special. I recommend it as an entry level winter ale for those that haven't embraced strong flavors."
"Pours copper/bronze color and has a fairly thick head with good retention and some lacing. Smells of deeply roasted sweet malts with some caramel-like malted scents. Tasting it, I pick up some chocolate flavors that compliment some of the roasty-sweetness fairly nicely and some very faint hops add bitterness and keep the alcohol from entering in too strongly from the equation. You don't really taste the alcohol, but you do notice its warmth and it bites a bit along with the light hops. It makes an impact on your mouth, and I'd be wrong to call this brew ""smooth."" It's forceful which sort of makes it hard to appreciate the texture of this one. Overall, it makes for an okay winter ale, but misses out on some of the fun ""wintery"" things that one tends to look for in the style."
"Considering Winter is about to be completely gone soon, I'd better get rid of these Winter brews I've got left hanging around. This one pours a clear amber-ruby topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises caramel, orange peel, mandarin oranges, and lightly-buttered biscuits. The taste brings out the bitterest notes possible from these elements, ranging from the white part of the orange peel to an astringently charred biscuit. Honestly, this comes off as just too much bitterness in a bad way for anything good to really come of it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, not my cup o' tea (so to speak), thanks to all that crappiness on the tongue."
"Poured amber with a huge creamy head that quickly faded leaving some nice lace down the sides. Smell was hoppy with sweet caramel undertones and a slight smell of alcohol. The taste was extremely sweet. Almost tasted like candy. Dry hopped finish, but still very sweet. Overall this is very drinkable, but a bit too sweet to be really drinkable."
"D - Not awful, it's just much more of a pedestrian winter warmer that's high in ABV but not offering anything pronounced. I wish the aroma's caramel malt sweetness would have carried into the flavor for better taste and balance."
"D - A winter warmer for those who enjoy a bitter finish on their beer. I would have liked to see more attention given to the malt side of the profile, since they're definitely in there and are tasted at the beginning of the quaf as well as exploding from the bottle on the pour."
"Clear amber with a fading tan head, and excellent lacing. Slight winter spice, kind of bland aroma. Malty caramel not very sweet mildly bitter not very hoppy. Medium bodied, finishes a bit spicy/peppery. Decent, but not something I would seek out again."
"Pours a deep ruby/amber with a small offwhite head. Aroma of malt, yeast, some fruity esters and piney earthy hops. Taste is sweet caramel with earthy citrusy hops. Palate is med to full body, nice carbonation. Finish is caramel malts,fruitiness, some breadiness followed by some good earthy citrusy hops ending with a lingering nutty dry alcohol hoppy bitternes. Overall a good holiday brew."
"Color is a dark, reddish brown. Aroma is malty but also cinnamon and cloves. Flavor, again, spices and malt. Not the most wintery of winter beers but definitely in the category."
"Pours with little head. Dark amber color slight lacing. Smells like funky yeast and little else. You either like this particular smell or hate it. Taste is malty. Not many dominant flavors. A non sugary date flavor with a warm to hot spicy finish. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming to my palate. Mouthfeel is thin and warm. Drinkability is good for me. Very warming winter brew. I like this yeast."
"Nothing particularly special. A good winter warmer although the mouthfeel brings it down a bit in the drinkability category."
"Beer is pretty bitter from hops, the lead off is a mild sweetness but the beer finishes really thin and very bitter. There is a hint of some spice in the midpalate, something light like allspice, it's very subtle. It's very bitter, pretty shocked by that. Overall, especially for Flying Dog, it's a decent beer. I'd even caution a second bottle."
"Notes: The bartender said this was an ESB. I see other reviews here treat it as a Strong Ale. It seemed a bit dark and sweet to me for an ESB, but reviewed as a Winter Warmer makes better sense, even if it is lacking in spices. It was nicely balanced, however, between malt and hops - just like a good ESB should be. So call this a hybrid winter ale and go with it."
"Overall not a bad beer at all. I wouldn't go out of my way to seek this out, but after having tried it I would not hesitate one bit if I had the opportunity to order a bottle of it or get it on tap somewhere."
"D: An uneven beer, where the aftertaste is the best part. I won't buy this one again."
"Not my favorite seasonal, but it wasn't altogether too bad. Wish it could have had a bitter better balance."
"The bitterness is too strong and too sharp for me."
"I drank about half of this beer before pouring it down the drain. That's a big deal for me because I can't remember the last time I had a drain pour. Maybe I was just having a bad day, but I would never recommend this anyone."
"D: this is a good winter warmer- lots of flavor and spice, nice mouthfeel, and very drinkable for the abv. Lots of fruit and spice notes with a nice dose of bitterness."
"Very dry winter warmer, very unexpected. Lots of munich malt which is contributing the fruity and toffee notes."
"On tap at Mad Mex Robinson, pours a deep caramel ruby amber hue with a light cream head, leaves behind speckled lacing. Aroma has upfront malts with a bit of xmas spicing, nothing outweighs one or the other a cohesive force of bready malts and christmas spices. Flavor is upfront with cramel sweet malts, a nice herbal spice and piney hop finish complements the whole experience leaving behind a dry finish vesurs your typical bread dough version of this same style of Christmas ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied easy going carbonation glides across the palate defintitely doesn't cloy or make the experience sour. A smooth drinking go to Christmas ale that I will revisit in the future."
"D: The dry bitter finish isn't something I look for in a winter warmer."
"Like I said, I'm not familiar with this style of beer."
"D: This is a good overall winter warmer, but I do not think that I would get a six pack of this. It is a nice and drinkable brew, but a bit thin overall and would consider other winter brews."
"D - Not a bad beer, with no hint of the 7+% abv (as stated on bottle - 074A11 ), it just didn't interest my palette at all. Wasn't big and malty enough to be a big winter ale in my fridge anytime soon."
"Flying Dog Brewery, L.L.C.--K-9 Cruiser Winter Ale--Flying Dog Seasonal--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 7.40% ABV. 30 IBU's. (4.0 /5.0) Mild lace big foamy tan head. Clear bright dark copper amber color. Mild hop toasty roasty mild fruit malt ester front. Mild sweet roasted malty medium textured rich body. Winter malt spice mild crusty bitter hop smooth end. Rich roasted Winter Ale. Sampled 12/10/2010. 6-Pack purchased for $9.45 @ Full Throttle Bottles, LLC, Seattle on 12/9/2010."
"Good tasting beer, with a definite sweetness, caramel and even chocolate. I get a slight bit of the alcohol burn that is trademark winter warmer. Mouth is medium, with light carbonation that is a little too noticeable. A great beer to pair, not a great beer to drink alone, in my opinion."
"A really enjoyable and hoppy winter warmer."
"Not surprisingly, malt is also the prominent trait in the taste. Buttery caramel notes are also there, along with a slight bit of toasted grain. A subtle pine-like hop presence appears at the end to add a bit of dryness. As the head might have suggested, there is a very creamy mouthfeel and light carbonation. The creaminess is probably one of the best traits about this beer. For the most part, this is a decent enjoyable beer...however the dry finish adds some redundancy to the experience."
"a little gross compared to the other beers of the evening, which didn't really stand out aside from the jolly roger. thin. skimping on malts? overattenuative yeast? probably not the latter. flavors would still present themselves."
"Appears dark amber brown, little or no head. Smells of malt and light hops. Mouthfeel is medium, not too light or heavy. Tastes of malt with a crisp hoppy finish, a little too bitter at the end. Decent malty winter beer, but loses a lot of flavor to the hops bitterness."
"A decent winter beer. It seems Flying Dog likes to use multitudes of wheat and malt with their beers considering this is what most of them taste like."
"This beer is warming me up as it warms. A little bit of a bite in the mouth with some alcohol burn. Sippability is high!"
"O: Good drinkability. A bit sweet but refreshing and tasty beer"
"drinkability: enjoyable to drink, has something to offer for everyone and appropriate for the season."
"O: Over all a decent winter beer."
"D - Well Flying Dog seems to create some great beers but this one really offered nothing to come back to. If I wanted an Old Ale I would stick to founders or even some Great Lakes. A nice winter ale though!"
"Drinkability: My first thought was this was a fine English Strong Ale, and I wondered why it has a relatively meddling average. Then that astringent aftertaste began to gnaw at me. Ultimately, there are much better English Strong Ales out there, such as Odell Isolation, Deschutes Jubelale, Avery Old Jubilation and Full Sail Wassail."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"D - I like Flying Dog beers in general for all purpose drinking, but this is my least favorite."
"Kay-Nine pours out your standard bronze type color with some pumpkin orange to round it out. Get a not so tight, loose root beer type head that stays and goes just as fast. A semi cap afterwards with some spots atround the glass. This really smells like a beefed up marzen mixed with some amber base as well. Malty, caramel, grainy, rich, sweet, blech. Taste is what I expected, a sweet oktoberfest/marzen, some werthers qualities. Some spice in the finish but not enough to call this a WW. Some butterscotch, caramel, alot of grizanne, and toasted malt. Feel is medium above and elixer like. A small carbing(?), faint alcohol afterwards. Well, it looks like it's back to the drawing board for a new WW to scope out, this one does not cut the mustard. A underwhelming big winter ale that needs more spice, and pizazzz."
"Poured into a snifter. Color is an amber-red with a tad bit of white head and a little bit of lacing. The nose is cherries, caramel malt, sweet bread, and some light yeast. The taste is mainly some moderately-sweet malt. Medium feel with some sweetness. Drinkability is alright; not the typical winter warmer, but not too much involved either."
"Mouthfeel - overly carbonated"
"D - Doesn't taste the best. I could drink a few but it wouldn't be the most enjoyable experience."
"Nice full bodied beer. It leaves you slightly dry, but not uncomfortably. It's fairly drinkable if you like the style."
"I might follow through and get a 6 pack, but prob only one this winter"
"D- This definitely was one of the more interesting beers I've had lately. It's a nice take on what a winter ale should be. I'm not sure this is a very drinkable beer though, with the unique taste and fairly high alcohol content for it's genre. Good to enjoy with those who are into different beer, not for those who like consistency of taste."
"Perhaps the driest Winter Warmer we've had this season, not a bad thing but certainly different from the rest of the pack. Regardless, this is a pretty inviting brew with winter knockin' on the door."
"D- the medicinal taste and smell that i picked up on is enough to make sure i steer clear of this one in the future."
"Carbonation and mouthfeel are fuller than I thought they might be too. It's got some better than expected characteristics and some that are merely OK. Reasonable but not a favorite beer."
"Not one of the best winter warmers, in fact, not very good at all. Would not try again. This beer has cause be to have an aversion to Flying Dog beers."
"D: Sort of a weird brew and not really in a good way. The 6.4% ABV would suggest this is a strong ale, but it's almost like they went for a winter warm but missed the mark and wound up with an unbalanced IPA. The malts and not nearly as sweet or rich as expected and the hops seem misused and deter from drinkability along with the clear alcohol flavor. Sort of a black eye for Flying Dog, IMO."
"a decent winter ale ,goes down relatively smooth ,but it's nothing to brag about to a friend .cheers.."
"Overall I didn't think this was a winter warmer but I can't penalize it for that - it's labelled as a ""winter ale"" which in my opinion is undefined (see Bell's Winter White). I found this to be a nice hoppy ESB, worth a shot."
"A clear ruby brown color pour with a small light tan head , quickly fading to a ring leaving some nice lacing medium carbonation. Aroma is of sweet caramel and toffee , slightly spicy with some breayd notes. Flavor is malty and spicy with lots of caramel and toffee ,hints of chocolate and a bit of spicy hops, medium bitterness, light body for the style , slick mouthfeel , this is very drinkable . Way more aroma than flavor but still a good brew."
"Aroma is crisp and malty, rather typical, but with an undertone of spice. It pours a nice clear coppery amber with a fairly thick off-white head. Flavor is more hoppy than malty, decent but seems to lack the spice I picked up in the aroma. Texture is fairly smooth and a little fizzy. Not Flying Dog's best, but still a good party beer."
"A light copper pour, head is big and bubbly. Whenever I see loosely packed bubbles like this I am cautious. Not too impressive looking. Has a funky adjunct aroma, that I can only link to Leinenkugel's beers. I smell alcohol and hops. No malt presence in this warmer. Bit of an upset. Flavor is all over the place, not sure what FD was going for here. A big hit of booze right up front, next is hops, and finally a very faint spice flavor. Almost has an effect of eating dry nutmeg, and then taking a shot of cheap whiskey. My experiences with Flying Dog have been very good prior to this. Very disappointing. Tastes like Leinenkugel's beers, just cheap and fake. Thin and fizzy. So much for mouthfeel. Feel like I downgraded after tasting so many good beers. First time I ever saw it on the shelves and usually FD delivers good beers. Yowzas."
"D - Not really my thing. I'm usually a big fan of Flying Dog, but this tastes a lot like what you'd find in a keg at a party when you aren't totally sure what's in the keg."
"Very nice effort from FD."
"This beer pours average, a bit carmel in color and the aroma does not set you up for the disapointment to follow. Heavy maltiness with earthen tastes make it seem stronger than it is. Kind of beats you up a bit going down and a strong bitter after taste lingers on the tongue. Not a real great interpretation of the style."
"D - Not a terrible brew, but average at best... Seems to really struggle in relation to style guidlines... Seems to be in a muddled territory between ESB and very weak Pale Ale... Wouldn't recommend and may actually turn down if offered another..."
"Don't pour too aggressively or foam might fill half the glass, otherwise it's a good 2-3 fingers high of delicate bubbles and foam, starts to dimple across the surface, not much lacing but very good retention. Crystal clear brown to red brick or dirt color, more of a metallic orange at the rims, despite clarity few bubbles visible. Reticent nose, offers meager portions of toffee, malts, orange infused chocolate and then some hop spice, maybe some leafiness like lettuce or cabbage. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation swirls through the attack and momentarily distracts from the lack of flavor. Ginger spice, dried cocoa, malts and orange/lemon citrus try to dance with peat moss, pepper, straw and a nondescript bitter edge. Maybe pear or apple fruit. Consistent quality-wise with most products of this brewery."
"Kind of generic overall. I'm not sure that I get it. That's just life. Dance through it all."
"D: This is good stuff and a case would be more than welcome. Not really what I expected going in, but the overall hoppiness of the brew is welcome in my opinion."
"I'll pass on this one... You should too..."
"Well, the bottle bills this thing as malty...pretty far from a malt-forward beer. It's more similar to an APA than anything else, but with a boosted ABV. Not necessarily a bad beer, but this does NOT say winter to me. Why go to all the trouble of brewing a seasonal and turn out such a mundane ale? Probably my least favorite Flying Dog beer yet, which is saying quite a bit."
"A drinkable winter warmer without a whole lot of frills or complexity."
"D: This is an OK beer that really seems like a basic APA rather than a Winter Warmer. Good for what it is, but nothing special."
"Not a bad beer from Flying Dog. Just needed more flavor character. I would buy it again, but it definetly isn't even close to a lot of other excellent winter seasonals out there."
"Definately one of the better malt forward WWs(not the best, but definately worth a try) this season, quite sessionable."
"Real average brew that earns the ultimate average grade in all categories."
"This brew is not bad by any means; just could be alot better."
"Drinkability = eh. Can't say I was real into it, the hops didn't add so much as flatten everything. Much better winter warmers out there."
"Avery Old Jubilation is a very similar beer in flavor, but much better in my opinion."
"d- not an easy beer to drink. While I didn't hate it, I did get tired of it about 3/4 of the way through the beer."
"Drinkability: After previous reviews, I thought this beer was going to be horrible, although I actually enjoyed it. I love that this beer has a decent hop profile, since it's nice to have a good, bitter hop profile in the cold weather. Not only that, but the balance with the malt is perfect in my opinion, just enough to keep me interested. I like Flying Dog's effort, and as this is not the best winter warmer out there, it's a notably good one, pick this up if you see it."
"Drinkability: Too many distractions going on here to make this one a keeper"
"The beer pours an amber copper color with pretty good head retention and lacing. The beer doesn't look all that bad. On the nose I get almost nothing. I kept on going back to this beer and, well, nearly nothing. There is some light spice and bit of sweetness, but otherwise that's it. On the palate, this beer is no better. There is some very light underlying sweet malt with some spice, and there's some hoppiness in the finish, but this beer really doesn't have much flavor. It has a fairly dry finish, and has a pretty light mouthfeel. Drinkability would probably be OK, except there's really very little enjoyable about this beer. Really, not very impressed with this one."
"This brew isnt going to make you take notice in its bold flavor by any means. But this isnt a bad thing, it is very drinkable. A brew that goes down very easy and comes in at over 6% alcohol is pretty good, and a welcome thing in the cold nights of the winter season. Hey if you are sitting in the house and want to tie one on this will do the trick and tastes decent. Good brew that will not offend anyone."
"D: Too watery for my taste. Nice to try once."
"Overall: Too watery and too flat in taste, too low in smell. Average brew."
"Notes: originally when i reviewd this beer i wasnt impressed. the first FD brew that let me down. well i got intelligenter. solid beer. solid malt body with BIG hop flavor and bitterness. would like to have seen the bitterness a little more subdued but fits in well with its brothers"
"There was a time when K9 said: ""when in doubt go flat out", but that was before the troubles in New York back in 2001. This version from Maryland is an incredible delicious ale, where malt sweetness combines with a crunchy biscuit flavor note in the finish. This is even better than I remember of the first version I sampled from Colorado."
"I like this. It's not a typical winter warmer and you could drink it whenever the night was full of cold."
"Taste: Malty with diacetyl giving a little bit of a butter flavor. Has a little bit of a bitter hop bite on the finish."
"Clean and creamy mouthfeel that lasts well into the finish. This one doesn't have much bite only some slight metallic bitterness and a lack of spice for the style that frankly I don't miss. Damn fine beer."
"D-My goodness, I could sip these all night, I wish this could last forever. Very impressed. I think the beer has been improved over time, I had the 2008 one and it seems the reviews of the past years are not as good as it is now. I think everyone that has had this should go back and revisit this one."
"Pours a copper color. nice head from this one, frothy that sticks around. smell malt. taste more hops then i expected. bit more bitter then i prefer from a winter warmer. not bad, but i want more from a winter time ale. waould prefer a bit more sweetness."
"Pours a dark chicory amber color with a think yellowish head. Malty aroma with hints of dark cherry, bitter hops and a spicy pepper presence. Syrupy and medicinal with hints of robitussin, spicy pepper and alcohol. I was looking forward to drinking this after the way it poured, but have to say that I was dissapointed by it's flat medicinal taste."
"D: Very well-balanced and quite tasty, but certainly not over the top."
"EDIT: This blew my mind, but, I just poured a BUD American Ale, and, dammit, they are really close! I even poured another K9 to compare. Ehh, this is like wierd..."
"Malty and hoppy too, with a bitter finish, hard to finish this one, it does have a nice malt taste, a bit of chocolate there, but the hops are biting, makes it hard to like it. I will stop buying this one for winter tries, too many other good ones out there unless they change the recipe."
"I've had better more interesting warmers than this. I probably will never buy this again. It is an average OK beer with an inflated price tag."
"Taste is light bitter and has some salmiak or liquorice in there. It is easily mistaken for bitterness, but somehow the beer tastes bitter the first second, but when rolled over the tongue it is liquorice all over the place. It adds a nice holiday spice taste and for sure it is interesting."
"Not recommended for this BA."
"An enjoyable beer on-tap. Some caramel and brown sugar with a little bit of spice. Served me well on a slightly chilly day in Athens, GA."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a twenty-ounce Pilsener glass."
"Notes: Where is the balance?, not horrible brew yet it did lack even distribution of flavor. Still,I managed to finish it and it was better when warmer. It needs some tweaking. There will be no next time because this was butter and brew combined."
"Ruby amber colored with a sweet looking rocky tan head that settles into a nice little collar around the glass, leaves decent lacing on the glass. Decent malty nose with some aromatic hop notes in the background. Taste is less spicy than most winter warmers but nice with a great balance between butterscotchy caramel flavors and bitter hops. Medium light mouthfeel with a smooth carbonation. Nice drinkability for the style, quaffable and easygoing. Seems better to me now than in years past."
"I've been suckered in again by Flying Dog. Clear mahogany pour with a bubbly, short-lived off-white head. Thin aroma of malt and hops, with a little caramel. Weak taste consisitng of watered-down caramel malt, some hops, grains, and nuts. While this was better than Tire Bite and Snake Dog, I have learned my lesson to not buy any more overpriced beers from this brewery."
"Overall-an ok beer, all the parts are there but it's an uneven drink."
"D - Good as a winter warmer - that is a one-off beer which does give that intense warming inside feelings. Flavors are not overpowering. Per style, I think this is a fairly drinkable beer."
"D - Not bad at all, in fact I appreciate brewers who understate the ""winter spice"" in favor of more actual beer flavors. This is a nicely hopped amber ale, but it's a little forgetable since its not really doing anything to stand out from the crowd."
"Notes: Vintage 2007. Drank in 2008."
"pours a copper color with an off white head that quickly disappears. Aroma is malty and sweet with a toasted bread background. Taste is malty caramel with a faint hop taste. Decent carbonation throughout with some good lacing that follows the beer down the glass. This beer is not bad."
"This isn't a bad beer, but there are so many other beers I would rather have in the house."
"Not a tremendous amount of complexity. Higher carbonation than expected for the style, and is most noticeable on the finish with the alcohol."
"D: This is interesting and has some unique characteristics, but it's kind of harsh and unbalanced. Given that and the ABV, it's not something you'd ever really have several of."
"D- Slow drinker but good."
"Mouthfeel is very, very carbonated. This isn't my favorite style to begin with, but even judging within the style, the drinkability is not great."
"As this was my first winter warmer, I found it kind of hard to judge because I have nothing to compare it to. That said, I do know I didn't like it that much, I'm just not sure if I don't like this particular beer or the style in general."
"Not sure what I'll do with the other 5; I suppose I can share with others that might like it better."
"Hard to rate this one. As a beer I give it a B+, but as a winter warmer it gets a B-."
"overall not my favorite. A bit harsh for my taste. Again I'm assuming thats to style. I'll stick to just one though."
"In corpus christi, World market had a 6 pack of this laying around and liquid town had a case or two. If I can buy this discounted, I may get a few six packs."
"Body is medium aND VIGOROUSLY CARBONATED. Drinkable but why."
"Final thoughts - Decent brew. Not a big fan of beer that has a metallic aftertaste."
"D - No off flavors but not a lot of flavor. Average."
"Pours clear crimson with a medium average lived beige head. Malt and spices in the nose typical of the style. Taste is a touch of cardboard stale malt like flavor. Toasty, spiced malt as well. Thin flavor and body and some metallic notes. Drinkable but unremarkable."
"Pours to a very festive ruby redish brown body hosting an inch and a half of spicey tan head. It quickly fades to just a skim leaving no lace. Nose shows tones of dark fruit, peppery dough and sweet dark carmalized malt. Enters the mouth slightly tart that quickly yields to a biscuit like spiceness. Some dark yet crispy dry fruit comes thru on the second half of the palate. The spicey richness and crisp tartness battle on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is a powdery spicey hue. Drinkability isnt bad but the spice profile with layers of pepper, coriander, and mild chilli powder are a bit much at times."
"Dark black with a two finger off-white head on an aggressive pour. Head kills quick. Not getting much of anything on the smell. Tingles at the back of the tongue, feels a little spikey. Really light malts, few spices, nothing is really standing out. Taste is not offensive, very easy to drink, just not really inspiring. I'd drink it if was in the fridge, but there are a few other winter warmers I'd target before this little fella."
"D: Good hearted winter beer without an overabundent amount of spices. Subtle alcohol warming finish with a ok drinkability."
"D: Can't say this beer impressed me.. but this style hasn't impressed me either"
"I'm starting to see the Flying Dog beers all over. I feel like they're playing it too safe, focusing more on marketing than quality. I'll have to try some other beers by them. So far, they're pretty good, but far from great."
"This all said, i actually really enjoyed this beer. Its not a huge beer, or intense, but its good and very enjoyable"
"This beer poured a clear brown with a rocky, tan colored head. The aroma is mild and mostly malty. The taste is malty with some spicy and molasses flavorings - not overbearing, but enough to wake the taste buds. The mouthfeel is full and seems appropriate. Overall, this is very drinkable brew."
"D - Good drinkability, I enjoyed drinking this while it was available."
"Poured a nice deep brown amber with a tan head. This is a bread and butter beer if there ever were one. Malty chew with butter hints. Hop balance is nicely done. Flyin Dog has made better brews. They should spend a little more time on this warmer. It needs some more attention."
"Pours a clear chestnut brown, reddish highlights, decent off white head forms, quickly settles down to a thin layer, touch of lacing. Smell is malty, some caramel, bread, earth, light citrus, some floral, bit pungent, luckily a very light piny spicing. Taste is malty, very bready, light grains, almost a rye character, caramel, light sourdough, just malt, bit of iron and some fruitiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Easy to drink, not bad but definitely not very interesting."
"D - This is a pretty good winter warmer. One of the better Flying Dog products."
"Moderate to high carbonation. Somewhat light mouthfeel."
"Enjoyable winter ale, this one. Nice on a February cold night in Ohio. I'm glad my wife picked some up."
"A moderately good winter brew, there are worse to be had. It feels like this one is playing it safe in a lot of areas, only to wind up with bland results."
"Easy to drink but felt it was a bit on the thin side for a winter warmer. Still, a pretty decent brew."
"Bottle smell is of chicory and slightly roasted but sweet malt. Pours to a nearly opaque golden brown with a tremendous frothy microbubble head. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, too much in my opinion. The taste is a great combination of sweet malt and cocoa flavors with a slight hopping for balance. It has a flat semi bitter start with a sweet finish. This is a nice surprise for a winter ale. Flying dog continues to impress."
"drinkability - Very nice winter warmer, would purchase thie again."
"Easy to drink. It has a smooth, medium body. Nothing particularly ""great", and not necessarily ""wintery"" but I like it."
"Nice hop bitterness on the mid palate and finish with some citrus showing in the mouth. A bit chalky on the finish but not sidetracking. Full of brown sugar and date with a sligh bit of cocoa. Fig and thick caramel devour the middle as well with a creamy thickness that leaves a great glyceryl note behind. Not sure why I didn't try this beer before but I'm happy I finally did."
"For the first beer from Flying Dog that I've tried, this is a good beginning. I wouldn't mind another of these."
"This beer wasn't bad. Not a big fan of the winter warmer style but I enjoyed this one. Poured a copper color with very little off white head and minimal lacing. The taste was good. It was mostly malty, roasted flavors with a nice hint of hops. Mouthfeel was a medium body with medium carbonation. Overall not a bad beer."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours the color of tarnished copper with virtually no head to speak of. Citrusy hops and toffee/caramel like malt. Citrusy hops with a fair bit of diacetyl and some toffee flavor too, with hints of spice on the aftertaste. No alcohol flavor, but definitely some alcohol warming going on here. Somewhat slick medium-bodied with full carbonation. Definitely not the best example of the style by any means. Decent enough, but not something I'd really seek out again..."
" This is a strange brew for sure, taste like a big Brown ale with spices. It would be decent if it wasn't for the bitter-alcohol like flavor."
"Overall- Good winter offering but not my favorite. Very rich and sweet, but really not bad. They went with the sweet style of winter brews, where I jprefer the strong and spicy. I appreciate the difference and will go back to it again next year for a good ""sitting by the fire"" beer."
"I only hope the Flying Dog BW's in the cellar are better than this brew."
"Pours nicely. Clear brown that is ruby hued when held to light. Good sized crème head. Minimal action on the nose. Flavor is decent. Starts off mellow and a high sweet tone kicks quickly on the end before vanishing. Smooth, but not a lot of character going on here really. Feel is smooth as well with the liquid and carbonation giving it good. Overall this is a nice drinker. Nothing really interesting or eventful though."
"Had this on-tap at the Rumba Cafe. Poured in a pint glass with about two fingers of head. Great retention, lots of lacing. Deep ruby color. Smells and tastes are pretty simple: nice malt backbone with some warm spices. Medium body. Very drinkable, nice example of a Winter Warmer, but not the most dynamic one I've ever tasted. Still, it fit the purpose and I enjoyed it!"
"Seems pretty average to me. Worth a try but not worth seeking out, imho. Thanks to gxxerman for the sample."
"My second beer I've sampled from the flamboyant Flying Dog Brewery... I must say, I definitely liked their rendition of a winter warmer better than their pale ale, which was also good, but lacked the flavor and flair of this great sample... a really nice warmer, with a nice 6.4% alcohol percentage which provided a nice glow... Appearance was good, a nice prunish-reddish brown with little carbonation but a nice color... smell was sweet with caramel and sugars present... taste was really pleasing with a vanilla and cinnamon flavor present... mouthfeel was good and the drinkability was great... went down smooth and the alcohol was hard to detect behind a sweet, cinnamon-vanilla flavor that was really pleasing... a good example of the style... Recommended..."
"NOTE: I beleive Flying Dog now brews in Maryland, which will make it more accessible for us in the East. Woof!"
"Overall not a bad beer but certainly not the greatest winter warmer either. Worth trying each year perhaps, but I'm not sure I'd get more than a bottle each time."
"I can think of many Winter seasonals to drink before I even think of this beer."
"A disappointing warmer from a rather reliable brewery. I suggest cruising past this one to another option."
"Final Note: Most of Flying Dog's base brews have been somewhat of a disappointment to me with the exception being In Heat Wheat. I love their extreme beers, namely Double Dog and Gonzo Imperial Porter, but I'm not a real big fan of the regular brews."
"D - This is a good example of the style. All I need now is a fire, some snow, a warm hat and mittens, and maybe some marshmallows to roast. This is a sipping beer; not necessarily one you'd drink a whole 6pack in a night."
"Not bad...but hardly terrific. I'd weakly recommend this beer. I bought this bottle at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"A lot of winter ales have a taste that seems to linger and die and finally rot on top of my tongue. This one is a clear exception. The stunning Steadman bottle pours neatly in the glass with a slight, white head and translucent ruby red color. The first sip is smooth and filling. The taste deteriotes only slightly as the glass slowly empties. A good winter choice."
"Pours a pale copper/ orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, a small sweet maltiness. In the taste, a sweet maltiness and just a hint of christmas spices (nutmeg/cinnamon). A smooth mouthfeel and a small malty, yet very clean aftertaste. Not huge in flavor, but easy drinking for a strong ale."
"Pours a clear ruby/orange color with a medium white head that has pretty good staying power. Patchy lacing on the glass. The aroma has notes of citrus and spice, along with some dark fruit. Medium-bodied with earthy malt, spice and fruit flavors. The finish is mildly bitter with a sweet malt aftertaste. Even though it is one of Flying Dogs better offerings, that isnt saying a whole lot."
"Resists the urge to get thick and yet retains the right level of heaviness for this type of brew. Huh, still haven't had anything from this brewery that impressed me. Maybe they should ask Ralph Steadman to brew the beer..."
"Drinkability: Winter has never looked bleaker."
"drinkable?: NO, i cant. sorry."
"This one pours a full three finger head that retains well over a deep redish brown brew. It seems to be well carbonated as the head refuses to die and the carbonation continues to rise within the glass. This one smells a little too boozy for only 7.48%, but there's malty sweetness almost bready behind the alcohol with floral hops to balance things out. I give it some time to settle and warm before my first sip that ellicits a caramel malty sweetness that gives way to a hop bite. Well balanced and less alcohol here than in the nose. The carbonation and medium mouthfeel gives it a creamy consistency. Fairly drinkable even in the summer, but I did expect more wintry spices given the labeling of winter ale on the bottle."
"The mouthfeel is soft on the palate, especially once its warmed a bit. Moderate carbonation."
"Overall - An excellent beer - i really enjoyed this.... a bit like a mix between a Scottish wee heavy and a Doppelbock... Recommended..."
"D: Overall not a really great beer, but not really a bad one. Spices are all right, and it's not a bad beer, but not really a great example of the style. Anchor's Christmas Ale is way better."
"I find it very enjoyable, although I'd like to linger on the flavor a bit longer instead of the hops. Finally a Flying Dog beer I wasn't disappointed in."
"Is this beer as good as other winter style ales out there? No. Is it a bad beer? Not in my opinion. Worth trying."
"Overall, I would say that this is one of the best of the bunch for Flying Dog. WOW!... I wonder if that ABV is correct?!...7.48...hooooweee! I would definately try this one again... COOL...there's one more left!"
"not a bad beer, but one gets the feeling that this could have been better."
"I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting, but a very good ""winter warmer"" and dessert beer."
"A solid ale, little disappointing hop profile but otherwise pretty damn drinkable. Seems to be more of a brown ale in many respects"
"it's essentially a heftier brown ale. drinks well with a considerable hop character. it's dry with enough sweetness to balance, but the hops keep things firmly coralled"
"Pours a clear amber-mahogany with a creamy, pale biege head of two-and-half fingers. Great retention leaves some spotty lacing. Light aroma of roasted barley, caramel, and floral hops in the background. Pale Munich malt sweetness upfront, followed by heavy dextrins, dark crystal sweetness, toasty Vienna, and finally sharp Pilsener malt flavor. Drying aftertaste with some malty notes sticking around, fruity ale character and an american hop citrus/grapefruit flavor is slight but noticeable. Balanced flavor with a respectable malt profile. Ample dextrins give some texture to the mouthfeel, filling in the gaps and making the light-medium mouthfeel seem full. Lighter carbonation allows the minimal residual sugars and slightly tannic malt to settle in, while the fruity hop profile dries the palate. Finishes mildly roasty with a faint herbal hop bitterness, ""HI-C"" fruit flavor, and grainy astringency. The overall character seems good but restained; might be fanatastic if it were toned up a little."
"Dark brown with crimson highlights and a tight tan head with good retention. Dark fruit and boozy esters are all Im getting from the nose. With the first sip a nutty malt character is noted and followed by dark roasted notes and a nice balance of dry, bitter hops that are spicy at times. A little yeasty tartness, a little sweet, and some caramel notes too. A noticeable alcohol presence is a tad too much for me and considering the abv for its style is on the low end. Some of the alcohol retreats as it warms allowing its other characters to come to the forefront. Medium mouthfeel and some creaminess at the end is pretty nice."
"Pours a dark ruby red. Nice head with some spotty lacing down the frame. Smells of Sherry and some slight toffee. Tastes really nice, with a few malty aromas and possibly cherries. Nice hoppy kickback at the end. Makes you yearn for the next one. I think this should be offered year round, and I will buy this when it is available."
"Thick malty and syrupy backbone. A tad creamy with toffee & caramel highlights and a mini hop snap on the finish. I like this beer, it reminds me a Scottish Ale. Very drinkable at 6.4% ABV and quite appropriate on this late December evening."
"I enjoyed drinking this beer, was tasty and really didn't offend. Wouldn't be dissapointed if i saw this on tap."
"D - pretty tasty, not sure why this beer is getting such low ratings. Yes, the flavor is a little flat compared to the aroma and I've had many better strong/winter ales, but this one is ok."
"This one is less than stellar. It's got some basic flavour to it and thats about it. It's simple and easy drinking, but not one that I would go out of my way for and would likely only sample again if there were no better choices on the menu or in the store."
"Another brew from the recently pruchased pick your own six. It was a good looking deep amber with brownish tint and minimal head at the pour. Smell was faint but I detected some malts and maybe butter. Taste was decent, maybe a bit of raisins and chocolate in the aftertaste. Just a decent beer."
"The drinkability is good a nice well rounded brew. MK"
"Pours a very nice copper, thin head, not much retention, but good lacing. Smell was on the weak side, malts and dark fruits mostlty. Body is medium, not much carbionation. Taste is sweet,and fruited. Has a nice rasin flavor edge. A hint of spice throughout make this a very nice beer!"
"Anyway, interesting."
"The beer has certain heft to it up front, perhaps not as much as I could wish for in a winter ale, but enough to stave off a light chill. Fairly drinkable, at least it is light enough for that, and it only coats the mouth lightly as it passes down my gullet. As the beer warms a bit a certain creaminess comes to the body of this beer. Sweet, richly caramelized malt notes lean towards fruity notes of raisins and even a touch of cherry, but both fruits have been lightly burnt and concentrated under a nice hot broiler. A touch of roasted grain character leaves a light burnt note that lingers on in the throat after the sip, yet still the concentrated sweet malt notes dominate the long finish. This certainly has some hop components to the flavor profile as well; notes of sweet tinged herbs intermingle with a light citrus character and a lingering bitterness. This is a nice beer, for some reason it reminds me of a slightly smaller version of Deschutes Jubelale, which seems to strike the winter warmer profile a bit better than this beer does."
"Dark brown / cola in color, with a creamy tan head that dissipated fairly quickly. Nose is malt-dominated, with a nut brown tanginess and a hint of hop crispness. Definitely tangy on the tongue, even a bit tart/sour right away, but there's some rich, dark malt way out in left field keeping the whole act together. This is very smooth and easy drinking for a bigger beer (is it really 7.4%?), in fact I've enjoyed K-9 Cruiser on several occasions in the past but never realized it was this strong. In that sense (and maybe given the fact that I poured this at fridge temperature) it seems thin for the style, but it doesn't exhibit any lack of the character I'd expect from a robust winter seasonal apart from this perceived thin-ness. Really takes on another character as it warms up, revealing that rich malt character I mentioned earlier. I've enjoyed this beer in the past, and this time with some curried rice - the beer's residual sweetness complemented the spice/heat of the curry quite well. Gotta add a couple of last observations: great balance here between hops and malt, it's subtle here but far from uninspired, and the K-9 recipe has maintained a commendable degree of consistency in a climate favoring hopbombs and Imperial renditions of every style - kudos to Flying Dog on that!"
"A brown blood, yet clear ale hue greats my eyes along with a a sprse head with no retention or foam with this beer. The aroma amkes up for the look of this beer. Great malts presence brinbgs out lots of dark fruits and hintys of cocoa. The taste is like a bunch of malty prunes. With a dash of Ovaltene. Very smooth for such a fruity tasting ale. Very sessionable if teh abv wasn't so high."
"D - A nice, crisp winter ale. One of the more drinkable Flying Dog offerings."
"Poured to a brownish re, with medium off-white head that dissiopated fairly quickly, to a little lacing. Initial aroma was dark fruit, mostly plums and raisins. Flavor at first was more of the malty dark fruit. As bottle warmed, the alcohol, though only 6.2%, became more evident in both the aroma and taste. This beer was a little like a Braleywine, but not quite there. This was not one of my favorite beers from Flying Dog."
"M-Great taste."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is light and softly-fizzy, quite healthy but lacking a depth that is desirable for the slightly thin-ish body. Not bad overall, it's just that the filtering process may have killed off the goodies of the original brew."
"I don't think I'll be picking this up if I see it in a sixer at my local store. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Flying Dog, liking their IPA, Wheat, Amber, and Barleywine styles . However, the sourness of this beer really ruined the experience. But this doesn't mean that I will not try K-9 Cruiser again. I'll definitely give it a shot if I find it available on tap. If it happens to appear in another Mixed Pack, I'll be sure to drink it first, just in case this turns out to be a beer that doesn't age well."
"Poured into a pint glass, with a brown/reddish color. A slight head forms with little or no retention, and disappated quickly. Strong malt aromas, very sweet, dominate every scent. The malt is also the most distinct flavor, then about halfway across the palate some hops kick in for some bitterness. In the mouth it comes across thin at first, then at some point, it begins to get some weight to it, that lasts till the end. You can also feel the alchol at the end of each taste. This is a good beer for Febuary, not for June. The sweet malt and high alchol make it a solid beer for those winter months."
"Pours dark amber with a one finger head. Smell is fruity sweet malts, caramel and a bit of alcohol. Taste begins with fruity notes and sweet malt that are followed by the hops to balance this brew out. I think this beer does a good job of hiding it's high alcohol content. Overall a better beer than I was expecting but it still was not overly impressive."
"A tasty ale, however it lacks the spice I look for in a winter offering. Just the right level ABV."
"A Taste with hints of caramel, no real bitterness. Theres an aftertaste thats subtle and fruity. I wanna say raisons. It's only after several mouthfulls that I begin to sense some carbonation and alcohol, but not strong. The other flavors pick up too. It's easy to drink. I would want to have more of these, but I'd probably end up on the floor."
"cheers..."
"is easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Overall, kind of bland. I was expecting a lot more. What's there is pretty good, though. I really have no idea what Flying Dog was trying to do here."
"Drinkabililty: sour/metallic aftertaste along with very parching effect compromise the drinkability of this beer."
"I could drink a lot of these, but why? I suppose it's a good way to get booze into the system, but it doesn't taste good at all. If this were cheaper, college kids would love to slam it. I'll be staying away from this one in the future. Blech."
"The mouthfeel is very thin and kind of disappointing for a high-ish gravity beer. Furthermore, it seems to be damn near flat. The result is a very watery ""beer juice," but it is actually quite an enjoyable product despite the weak body. Surely doesn't seem like a 7.5% beer."
"Clear dark ruby color. Head is somewhat oily but leaves some lace. Musty roasted malt aroma..flavors are a dominant roasted malt character & decent hop bitterness. Some dark fruits (plums, raisins, figs, etc.) come out as it warms.. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a 7.5% winter seasonal. This brew really doesn't have any standout qualities or memorable characteristics, so there's not too much here to get excited about. Go with Flying Dog's Horn Dog if you want to try a winter seasonal from this brewery. That's worth a purchase, this one isn't."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy drinking beer."
"This pours a very dark red with a nice 2 finger head,but the head doesn't last long.The smell is a faint maltness with some alcohol.The taste has a roasty maltness with some winter spices along with a metalic flavor.The spices are much more subtle than other winters. The m/f is light and well balanced.This is a pretty good beer that is very drinkable. The taste is lighter than other winters and more drinkable. Still, this is thinner and weaker than others too. It's not bad,but other Winters are better."
"Dangerously drinkable, I cooould enjoy this well into summer!"
"Special thanks to World Class Beverages, the distributor in indiana who put together the holiday sampler package with 12 different winter beers, all American micros. I can't wait to try the rest!"
"The flavors are subdued at times, and the sweetness is unbalanced. An average Strong Ale."
"Overall i did enjoy this one, but there are better beers out there. but i could see myself getting this one again at sometime."
"This beer looks a lot like a soda. Brown, but semi-transparent in color, with a creamy off-white head that lasted about 2 minutes. The smell is sorta nutty, with some decent hops too. The flavor is semi-sweet, with some toasty, caramel malts and some fairly bitter hops. The flavor is sorta flat, as in not complex, but still flavorful. Dark malt, hops, and that is about all. It's not bad, just kinda non-descript. The nice thing is that it has a fairly light mouthfeel, but still the bold flavor. The drinkability is quite high, and with the medium/high abv, that is a plus. Overall, a fair brew."
"Not bad, but i'm getting tired of winter seasonals that seem like castrated versions of Anchor's OSA."
"Drinkability: Not bad. This wouldn't be the first winter ale I would go for, as there are thicker and better tasting brews out there But Flying dog did ok on this one. Worth a try but nothing special."
"K-9 Cruiser is a deep, clear mahogany color with an initially fluffy white head that soon fades away, leaving pretty good lacing. Really doesn't smell strong at all, but what's there is a bit of fruitiness, some spicy alcohol notes, and a bit of toasted malt. The taste is similarly muted; there are some sweet, dark fruits with a bit of an alcohol spike and a small toasted and slightly hoppy finish. As far as winter ales go, this isn't nearly as good as Goose Island's or Big Sky's, and the only other American Strong Ale I've had, Nosferatu, outclasses this easily. K-9 Cruiser just doesn't have a lot of flavor, but would be a good way to get fucked up pretty quickly, I guess."
"poured a deep ruby-copper color with abundant tannish puffy head. Smell is mostly of toasted malt. Taste is truly enjoyable, with an abundance of dark fruits (raisins, prunes, figs) combined with a sweet fruitiness. Finishes sweet in a good way, as it was from fruit, rather than a corn syrup. Considering the alcohol content, this beer is very scary in its drinkablility."
"This was a tasty beer that poured a very nice dark brownish amber with a small head that sticks to the glass on its way down. It smelled very toasty and malty with a hint of some hops in there as well. It was rather full-bodied and not overly carbonated which made it very smooth. It tasted of toasted malts and hints of bitter hops and caramel. A very easily enjoyable beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pretty flavourful for a Flying Dog product. Roasty, caramel, sweet and fruity flavour. Mellow carbonation, smooth, slick mouthfeel. This beer lacks in the hop department though. Nonetheless, quite drinkable. A very average ale. Had as part of their 12 bottle mix pack. All were very disappointing."
"Wow, a very good beer. Looks dark brown with amber and red highlights. Nice thick tan head pours with low to moderate carbonation. Head sticks around a while. Smells malty and a bit hoppy. Some spices and earthyness in there. Tastes malty sweet with flavoring and bittering hops lurking closely. Fruityness of dates and raisons. Mildly spicy of ginger and pepper. Hop flavor comes through in the bold body. As well does alcohol. Finishes as malty as it begins, but not too sweet or too dry. A very goo balance on this one."
"Alcohol by Volume: 6.8%"
"Taste is malty and a bit sour. There's an unpleasant fruitiness and some buttery flavors. The malt and hops flavors don't mesh. Some spice detected. Sticky and lightly spicy mouth. This is a struggle to get through. Not well done."
"Pours a deep amber with a decent fluffy head to it leaving some trace amounts of lace,aromas were very subdued for a strong ale I picked up some brown suger and caramel but nothing really going on here.Flavors as well are pretty subdued for a stronger ale some caramel and butter stick out most but you would know ur drinking a strong ale just lackluster.Well I have come to expect somewhat hohum beers from Flying Dog and this is status quo for me."
"Pours medium dark brown, a finger of light, foamy, brownish head. Carbonation is good, giving the beer a light and airy taste. Good lacing throughout. Malts, alcohol, and a hint of spice in the smell. Smooth medium malts with some minor hops give a good balance. Spice is minimal in taste. A rather enjoyable beer, moderately good finish. I'd drink it again."
"I also do not believe this is a Strong Ale, especially since we have not popped the 6% cap in North Carolina. Would not buy separately, but would purchase the mix pack again."
"Pours a nice deep brown amber with a tan head. This is a bread and butter beer if there ever were one. Malty chew with butter hints. Hop balance is nicely done. This brew is, however, very average. I hope the other Dogs in my mixed 12 are better. This is the first time I've seen Flying Dog on sale locally so I had to try it, but based on beer one I won't be coming back to it."
"Reflection: This beer is a bomb as a winter warmer but I wouldn't refuse a free one."
"Drinkbaility and Overall: If the sound of hot dog flavored beer seems applealing to you, then by all means find this beer. If not, avoid it."
"Pours a nice dark clear mahogany color, with a 1/2"" of off white head. Color is reminicent of a Barleywine. Smell is good enough, fairly hoppy, but the taste goes south quick. An unflattering woody/stale smoke flavor dominates this beer, with off-malt flavors. I don't even know what Flyng Dog was going for this, started good enough, but is not a good beer at all. Get the Horn Dog barley wine instead, trust me."
"Drinkability: A wonderful beer which can be truly appreciated in mid-winter's chilly grip. This beer is packed with complex malty sugars, but lets ya know that the hops won't be denied - they're just part of the colorful trees in this vast forest of wonder."
" Good ESB / Bock?"
"I could finish this one, but won't look to drink another anytime soon."
"This is a good winter brew. It is rich and flavorful and has enough body and alcohol to keep you warm. It pours a ruby red color and has a beige head that leaves a lot of sticky lace. It has a nice hoppy finish to follow up the complex malty flavors. There is a bit of coffee in the aroma as it warms up. I think it will make a decent winter brew alternative to mix things up every so often."
"Will look forward to other beers by Flying Dog"
"Beer has a dark red body, small off white head. Not much retention, but good amount of lacing. Most dominant aroma is of chocolate malt. Not really any hop aroma, very malty. Light mouthfeel, very dry finish. Chocolate malt taste hits you upfront, with a little bit of bitterness. Somewhat of a metallic taste, though which I don't like. Certainly a drinkable beer, though higher in ABV. It really feels like it's drying out my throat though. I haven't had a beer do that this much before."
"The malty, lightly toasted grain aroma of this beer is more impressive than the flavor found within. It's appearance is nice, however, with a clear, deep mahogany body with a ruby cast; and a short head of light tan foam that holds sufficiently well before dropping to an average collar. Some areas of thin, tiny-spotted lace appear on the glass with each sip, but never seem to be able to hold. The body is medium and its fine-bubbled and moderate carbonation leaves it lightly creamy and silky smooth. The flavor is similar to that of it's Munich malt like graininess with a dollop of caramel, but it's nowhere as rich as it suggests. It is balanced nicely, however, with a touch of yeasty fruitiness and some light, citrusy hops; all backed by a firm bitterness. It's alcohol is noticeable (and surprising at just 7.5%), but it's not overbearing. It finishes fairly short and dry with little fan-fare."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head above the clear, dark copper brew. Head fades quickly to a layer of bubbles, and lacing is average. Aroma is malty, with evidence of alcohol apparent. Taste is lightly of grains, lightly of alcohol, pretty much lightly of everything. Lacking. Mouthfeel is slippery, kind of slithers off the tongue, down the throat as fast as possible, and drinkability is of the ""why bother?"" level. Won't bother with this one again."
"This poured a deep dark cherry red color, with a thin off white head. The color is very nice, I had to admire it for a second longer. The smell is a little weak, but you can detect the malty presence, as well as some fruit. The taste was malty smooth with some nice roasted flavors. Pleasant hop finish, not too bitter - just enought to counter the malt. Unfortunately, there is not enough of this taste. There are no off flavors or anything disagreeable, but there just isn't the big flavor I'm used to in a strong ale. It goes down smooth and is pretty drinkable, though."
"K-9 Cruiser is unlikely to make anyone forget the best that this style has to offer, but it's a fine effort all the same and would make a good training wheels strong ale for those who might otherwise be intimidated. This is definitely one of Flying Dog's better efforts."
"An unimpressive winter warmer. While it is drinkable, there's no need to go out of your way for this. There are MUCH better micros out there."
"This brew is a clear, dark-brown/cola colored beverage. Topping it off is a small khaki head. There is a chocolate scent, with a hint of alcohol. Chocolate malt front, some bittering hops, alcohol hidden. The mouth is much too thin and watery for this beer, and this ruins what otherwise may have been interesting."
"Man, I just hate the Flying Dog labels. The names kind of suck too. Regardless. Bronzed, dark amber body with a small, guaze-y, light brown head. Lean to very-lean cookie malt sweetness set against a bed of funky-citrus (almost sour) hop aroma. Weird. Weak toffee and cookie malt up front. Malty sweetness flashes early but quickly gives way to lemony-pine hop burn. Kind of astringent and raw; definitely bitter. Cookie malt barely resurfaces into the finish along with the astringent bitterness and alcohol. Not as full-bodied as it should be; rather thin and watery for the style. Not terrible, just not very good."
"Overall Impression: Not a horrible winter beer, but certainly not one I'll be seeking out in the future."
"I was glad to find this on sale, but not so happy that I have five bottles left. They'll be saved for when I'm already 3 1/2 sheets to the wind, and don't care what goes in me next."
"Pours a nice deep copper with some maroon hues. Small, light brown head. Roasted sweet malt controls the nose. No hop aroma. Malty palate, but not much else. Sweetness, with a dry, short finish. Unimpressive. Light, slightly metallic mouthfeel. Disappointing. Another mediocore brew from this brewery. No need to try this one."
"This one pours a dark brown color with a small head that quickly dies off and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and fruity with some grassy smells. Dark fruits. The flavor is thin and reminds me of a bock beer. Not too sure what I think about it being an American Strong Ale. Fruity and crisp with a grassy flavor. Just ok. Probably won't have it again."
"The beer evacuates the 12-ounce brown bottle a deep brown color with a modest semi-creamy light tan head that evaporates rather quickly leaving a thin but sealing sheet of lace. Nose is sweet malt, light hint of hops and caramel, fresh and crisp to the senses, start is sweet with a fair grain profile, the top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is briskly acidic, the hops sufficient in their spiciness, a drinkable beer."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thin off-white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a rich malty scent along with a warm molasses type aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth, rich, malty flavor that has some dark malt qualities. It goes down really easy and finishes with a buttery molasess aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a really smooth old ale. It has an elevated abv. , but you would never know it. This beer drinks very well."
"pours out an chestnut/auburn colour with a fine fading off white head. minimal lace. fruity estery aroma...lots of dark ripened fruit and other yeast induced flavours. sweet flavours abound, but there seems to be no malt backbone to beef up this style of beer. the mouthfeel comes off as slick and buttery...then weak and watery, therefore causing the whole beer to suffer. very mild bitter finish. high ABV well hidden. too sweet for the body; to weak for the style. i'd drink a few, but i don't think i'd spend any more $$$ to sample this again."
"Obviously with the higher ABV you don't want too many of these. While not great, this would be good enough to have a couple. It has potential but isn't quite there."
"Pours a dark brown color, and tops itself with a beige, thin and low head that disappears too quickly. Aroma is sweet malt, and that's about it. Flavor is sweet and syrupy. The ABV doesn't interfere with the flavor, but maybe something should. This one is cloying to me, and the body is thin. I wouldn't be able to guess the style if I didn't know."
"ng"
"Not real drinkable, I can find better."
"Poured a very clear dark coppery-reddish with a small tan head that disappeared altogether. Kind of a grassy, wet hay aroma with malt sweetness undertones. The mouthfeel was syrupy, somewhat flat, and a little thin. The taste was pleasant -- sweet, with a little clove-like spiciness with a bit of bitter in the aftertaste. Good, but I wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting."
"Poured a dark brown with a medium head. Left a little edge around the glass. Hops aroma that quickly went away to malt. Not much aroma. Somewhat sweet, malty and dry. I did not notice the alcohol. I will have another of these to make a full assessment. Not good, not bad. Drinkable but a little weak for a strong winter ale. Taste is like some Scottish ales I have had."
"Final Thoughts: An alright beer, I won't be likely to purchase a whole 6-pack of this but may purchase another single bottle on a whim. Just not what I expected for a winter beer, expected a heartier more robust product."
"Amber color, clear and tending toward brownish. Head is decent, it slightly pale, creamy in texture. Lacing is nice, complicated webbing down a pint glass. Aroma is heavily malty, scant hops, pear fruit and butterscotch are the main characters. Mouthfeel is medium, but the flavor is a littlle much -- lots of sugary sweetness and diacetyl re-inforced by the aroma. Unidimensional to me, front to back, a big aftertaste continues to underscore the dominant notes of the flavor profile. While not sticky, the beer is border line cloying."
"Poured out a deep amber color and was very clear. The head on this beer never even had a chance and was gone in a blink of an eye. Light carbonation. Could be a bit flat. Slightly sweet malt aroma with a dry fruitiness. The flavor has some fruity malt and is light to medium bodied. There really isnt anything special here and seems to lack gusto. Not bad and somewhat unique tasting. Finishes with a dry touch of bitterness. Not sure what to make of this one."
"This brew is a dark maroon amber colour with no head to speak of. The lacing is OK, but does not hold up too well. The aromas are pretty subdued, but I can smell some roasted caramel malts, and some very, very faint, old hops (perhaps cascade?). This kind of reminds me of a very weak tasting scotch ale, or kind of like Otter Creek's A winter's ale. The mouthfeel was a bit light for a winter ale, and the drinkability was just OK. Decent."
"Dark amber color. Small head. Aroma is malty and sweet, kind of perfumy. A medium bodied strong ale. Malts are roasted and sweet. Hops are a touch citrusy. An interesting beer. Aroma and taste are very different. Mouthfeel is a touch thin. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, with a touch of an alcohol bite."
"Pours a nice light walnut. Aroma is sweet and a faint dark fruit. Big, big malt body with a fair bit of yeasty phenolic action going on - buttery diacetyl and a hint of prune. Finishes fairly clean for the malt, and the surprisingly high abv is not evident in the flavor profile. More like a strong Scottish export ale than anything else I can compare it to. Quite good."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a deep mahogony with no real head. Some sign of lacing on the glass. Aroma of malt is about all you can detect, no noticable hop aroma. Moderatly carbonated, and you can taste the malt, and again no hopiness. Lacks any body, and finishes weakly, but it still tastes good. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this but wouldn't pass it up if offered."
"The nose is sweet, sweet toffee, minimal grapes, some breadiness. The front is mostly caramel malt, with some apples and grapes in the middle. The feel is a little watery. Toffee comes back strong in the finish with some grains. As it warms, some faint chocolate appears in the aftertaste. Overall... nothing special."
"Taste: The taste was all dark berries and fruits, with a little alcohol on the finish. That's about it. No hops flavors at all and just a hint of malt in the background. Like the smell, it was not very beer-like, but not unpleasant either."
"They call it altitude ale. I am not sure from what mountain they are on. I love their creativity. However, they call it a strong English brew and maybe it is I put it more like a scotch kinda ale. It is very drinkable with some after taste. Overall, I like the diverisity."
"Deep dark brownish-red color, small foamy off white head that doesn""t last. Has a malty bready yeasty aroma, sweet malty candy caremel flavors, some hop bitterness in the finish, medium body kind of a syrupy mouthfeel, something is off balanced in this ale."
"Pours a dark brownish copper color with a very thin tan colored head that vanishes almost immediately. Aroma and taste are a fruity and malty sweetness with a faint trace of floral bitter hops. Seems a bit thin and watery in the mouth. Nothing special about this brew."
"Pours a dark ruby brown but clear hue with a small off white head that shrinks quickly but leaves a nice sheet over the entire top. The smell is that of a delicious smelling baked bread and malts...very nice! The taste is consistant with the smell as the fresh baked bread comes in with a nice lightly hopped and quite noticeable alcohol on the tail. The mouthfeel is a little too thin to my liking for this style but all in all, a pretty darned good brew. Cheers!"
"K-9 pours a dark ruby, with a limited head, no lace. The nose was very fragrant with buttery-banana, rum, candy, and prune arrangements. The flavors on the palate are the same as the nose; it got really pruney towards the end. The mouthfeel was a tad sticky. The beer warmed your throat as it was consumed. The alcohol was noticeable a winter warmer with a ton of punch, all the same, I like it."
"Clear dark ruby hue, topped by a light tan head that settles quickly into a tight glass coating ring. Combination of damp floral Goldings hop nose and mild bubblegum esters are followed by very assertive diacetyl that almost takes on a cheesy character. Biscuit malt and generic dark caramel sweetness persist as an undertone in aroma. Subdued chocolate malt manages to couple well with the prominent butterscotch and prevents the diacetyl from becoming offputting. The flavor profile is comprised of light roasted barley bitterness, sweetness derived from crystal malt lightly contrasted by low hop bitterness. The expectedly strong diacetyl emerges towards the end of the sip. Like the aroma, the chocolate malt offsets the butterscotch presence adequately, and prevents it from being overbearing. Lightly bodied, w/ a somewhat watery mouthfeel. Finishes sweet w/ biscuity notes lingering. K-9 is an odd, eccentric brew. It's not particularly well balanced, mostly due to the strong diacetyl that borderlines on being akin to rancid butter. The drinkabilty is decent considering the strength. It's not a beer I'll have in the forseeable future, however. This beer, in its bottled form, appears to be inconsistent, but it is never well rounded."
"Notes: The fruity buttery diacetyl (by-product of the yeast) is a bit excessive borderline overwhelming though not as bad when the brew warms up to cellar temperature. A half decent brew yet hard to finish one due to the high level of alcohol and flamboyant flavours."
"Okay, so far in bottles, the Flying Dogs have been crashing and burning.  But sometimes on tap they manage to stay in the air.  This one arrived a very dard amber color and formed a small off white head with some nice lace.  The aroma was slightly of hops and malt.  The taste was of hops, malt and some caramel.  The finish was medium and had elements of malt and caramel."
"Thank God this was my last bottle from Flying Dog.  I was unimpressed with their offerings.  This beer was flat and watery like their other beers.  The only strong ale characteristic was a minimal cloying winey sweetness.  Otherwise it was forgetable."
"I actually mistook this beer for a dark lager. There's not much going on in the flavor and it's too clean tasting and leaves a sour aftertaste."
"Another near average beer, from a seemingly near average brewery. It's almost like they don't know how to handle their own yeast?"
"I didn't find anything distinctive about this beer."
