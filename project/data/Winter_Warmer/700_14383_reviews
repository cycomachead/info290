"Rather light and unremarkable for a winter brew"
""
"3.25/5: If nothing else, a nice winter warmer for spice haters"
""
""
""
"Pleasant taste. Could use more hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma malt, caramel, faint spice, orange, & hops.  Taste zesty bitter hops, citrus, light caramel & malt, peppery spice.  More an IPA than Winter ale!"
""
""
"12oz bottle in pint glass.  Golden orange color, slightly hazy, very little head and only minor lacing; slight carbonation; earthy/pine scent; a sweet undertone to the flavor-- caramel-like in its finish.  Overall: An interesting take on a winter/Christmas ale insofar as it doesn't appear to have any distinct spice flavor and is not particularly memorable. I'd try it again on tap but not likely to buy another sixer. (8.0)"
""
"Overall, why did I buy this again?  It is just an average ale."
""
"An interesting take on the winter warmer style, forgoing any seasonal spice additions (it would appear to this scribe) in lieu of some south seas fruitiness, which works well enough, I suppose.  More of a sweetness-forward IPA overall, though, which isn't too surprising for this brewery, and where they come from - snow, whazzat?"

"This beer didn't do it for me."
""
"Overall, this beer does not live up to the description on the bottle.  The citrus and the hops are both muted, and there is nothing else evident."

"12/16...pours dark copper orange with some white foam. Light pine nose. Strong hoppy bitter wrapped in citrus with a pine earthy taste. Rich robust mouthfeel. Oily. Heavy. Harsh on the palate. Difficult."
""
""
""
""
"This is an unusual winter warmer, and is pretty much a double pale ale.  As such, it's a nice change-up from the heavier examples out there.  A pretty good deal at 8 something for a sixer."
"Nothing like any winter beer I've had."

"a really different beer. malty and nutty and sweet like other winter warmers, but it has a funny fruity tang to it that makes for a strange flavor profile as well as an electric mouthfeel thats not as mellow as i usually look for in the style. i like that its driven mostly by grain instead of spice, rich and toffee-like in smell and taste, with some darker malts in there too. the body is only medium though, and with the high carbonation and the fruity zizzle, it feels a lot lighter than i like this time of year. it might be a good one to have a few of, but the abv is still appropriately high for the style. its a hard one to reckon, given the polarity of its attributes, but i like it for what it is. elysian doesnt always hit home runs, but they absolutely never make boring beer."

"My least favorite Elysian seasonal, however by no means a bad beer. Winter pale ale is a fairly uncommon style"
"It's not my favorite from Elysian but its not bad... Malty and Creamy"

"A Good beer"

"Tastes way too sweet. Hardly bitter at all. I had to pour it down the sink as I couldn't bare to finish it (and that hardly ever happens). I really regret wasting 10 bucks on that 6 pack. This is the first time I have disliked an Elysian beer"

"Not a typical Winter Warmer but a well done, enjoyable one."
""
"O- Warming and inviting brew. The 58 ibus and7.6% abv are matched well. I'd like more aroma next time."
""
"Pours a rich copper color with a white head. Citrus, malt, and and a fruity yeast. In the taste, piney hops and a bit of earthiness. Slight note of oxidation, with a dry cardboard/papery note along with a hop bite. A bit of toast and a slightly more than balancing bitterness. Lightly spucy notes. Briskly hoppy, but with a firm malt foundation. Medium to full bodied, crisp and very drinkable. Overall, this is a very good ale, with a hop emphasis."

"22 oz bottle given to me as a gift for cat sitting for a week. Worth it! I drank this thing down in less time than it took to walk home (15 mins). Just couldnt stop sipping it. By far one of the best overall beers Ive tried, winter or otherwise. Cheers!"

"Overall- Above average to good beer. I would definitely give it a try as it is a little bit of a departure from the norm. It isn't wildly experimental but could give pause."

"Bifrost pours a hazy orange color, almost reminds me of the bright smog filled horizon when the sun sets in Los Angeles. Thankfully the aroma is much more pleasant with a citrus hop scent with light tones of sweet malt and freshly cut flowers. The taste was very fresh with hints of citrus balanced nicely with the powerful hop bitterness. Mixed in well was the sweet malt and biscuit like tones. I could slightly pick up on the 7.6% ABV which was a nice reminder that this is a winter warmer. The finish is nice with a crisp dryness. The mouthfeel was medium with the right amount of carbonation. Overall this was a good beer, I would buy it again."
""
""
"O: Due to the higher amount of hops than normal for this style, it is not nearly as sweet or sticky as some of the other winter warmers that I have tried. Also, I enjoyed the fact that it did not seem like it had a lot of spices added to it which in my opinion made the beer a little easier to drink."
"O: This beer is a little hoppier compared to other beers in the style so the mouthfeel doesn't seem very heavy or sticky."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, probably wouldn't get it again. The description on the label boasts citrus and hops balanced by malt, but I'm just not getting a lot of the malt here (as I feel like you do in a SN Torpedo or Dogfish 90 Minute, for ex.). I doubt this beer would disappoint any IPA fans, though I think to call it a winter warmer is a little misleading."
""
"I went with an aggro pour as the result of my excitement and created two fingers of dense, tawny head with good retention. As it slowly fell, it left some great sticky lacing in its wake. Color was a deep-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled strongly of both minty hops and caramel malts, much like some AIPAs that I have had of late. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste reminded me more of a young ABW between the preponderance of biting, minty hops and sweet caramel malt. I may try to remember to buy an extra bottle for cellaring next year as the result of tonight's exercise. Finish was semi-dry with the malt providing just enough of a counterbalance to keep it reasonable. Man, this was quite the find!"
""

"Overall: like the beer's name, his glass comes up big and hearty; by the end, buzz-worthy; a dry finish suggests complexity and a fitting after-dinner drink..."
""
""
"O - Would never have guessed this was a winter warmer. Tastes like a pretty bitter, citrus-tinged IPA."
""
"Overall - I've had this hoppy winter warmer before, and thought it was fine, but this year's version was amazing. A lighter colored counterpart to Sierra Nevada Celebration, emphasizing the hops. My favorite winter warmer this past season."
""
"O- A great beer but it doesnt fit the style. Thats the only downfall."

"Pours a hazy orangish yellow color with a two finger head which gives way to a very nice lace on the glass. The aroma starts off with a citrus and grapefruit aroma. There is a slight bready aroma in the middle. The end has a little pine hop action. The taste follows suit, there is a bready malty start, the middle then comes through with a grapefruit and citrus flavor. The backend has a pine hop taste. The taste is there but is slightly thin. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated maybe slightly watery. Overall it was a very average beer, there just wasnt enough going on to make me want it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I have seen cases of this but I am not sure I would have more than one. Only sightly like a Winter Warmer and far from even an old ale which I kind of expected."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts and a hint of citrus. Taste is also mild, malts, some citrus, and a big alcohol taste at the finish. The spices usually associated with this style seem to be missing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
"Overall - I actually rather enjoyed this beer. It had a good, but not overly so, resinous hop flavor that melded well with the lighter fruit, citrus and malty flavors of the brew."
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""

"Pours a very hazy, mirky amber with piles of white head and good retention. It has quite a bit of particulate that just hangs in suspension. Nose contains citrus and a smooth bready malt. Chrismtas orange is brought to mind. Taste follows with citrus and earthy hop and bready malt, with a bit of caramel. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is great for a beer like this good balance between bitter and sweat. Overall a very nice beer, although a bit out of style. Winter ale is a wide category but this still seems to miss the mark."
""
""
""
"This is one heady and hoppy warmer. Malty DIPAs aren't my thing, so the comparison is a little distasteful. But, it's a warmer, and it works just fine. I like the approach."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable, a kind of IPAish winter warmer."
"O- I really like this beer. I think they use a different yeast in this than most American winter ales. It's pretty sweet and probably best enjoyed with a glass of water to clear the palate every few drinks, as it leaves behind some sugary syrup feeling."
""
""
"I can't recommend this as a winter warmer at all. It's an interesting pseudo-Winter Pale Ale, but it doesn't quite hit the mark there either. This maybe needs a re-brand and a little tuning. Not a big fan, would not buy again. Shame, this is my first Elysian brew and I've heard good things. Will have to give something else a go."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy golden/amber/orange with a thin white head. Nice rentention, and laceing. Aroma is of grassy hops, and fruit. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is explosion of fruit ,carmel, candy, and hops. This is a unique flavor. A must try."
""

"This is an unusual and delicious beer. I thought it'd be rated more highly than 85. It was difficult to pinpoint, because it's not exactly what I'd call a winter ale, nor is it a golden ale like Leffe, but it does bring those to mind. After writing up my notes, I had to peek at top reviewers and I saw one which mentioned ""cardamom."" Rats--exactly what I'd been tasting and could just not pinpoint myself. Well, I'll add ""anise"" to that, the two of which will account for the unanticipated spice notes. Appearance and pour: 1/4 beady head with hazy golden, tan color. Very pleasing nose of chamomile flowers and cinna-mint (cinnamint sans gum flavor). Body: full although that is cut and masked by very active carbonation and a dry finish. Starts peppery, mid way smooth, lacto and barley drive-bys but zero yeasty bready Belgian aleness. Finish again peppery, spiced, spiked, dry. This is an interesting winter beer, and I'm sorry its uniqueness initiate a 'categorical error' in those who've found it wanting."

"Very happy with this Winter Warmer."
""
"O: Surprised that the beer is labeled as a winter warmer, came off more like a pale ale or an IPA to me. At first, liked it, but, liked it less as it warmed."
""
"Enjoyable winter beer with orange and cinnamon spice. Pours amber with not much head. Medium carbonation, which made it easy to drink despite the high alcohol content. Lots of malt and caramel, with the bitterness of the hops coming out on the finish. Overall, I liked it a lot."
"Sampled on draft at Elysian Fields out of a basic pint glass. Light orange to bronze in color with medium cream colored head. Head bubbled off quickly leaving only a paperthin layer of micro bubbles. Modest hop scent with sweet apricot or peach notes. Drinks very smooth and light. A hint of citrus with the hops in nice balance, smooth mouthfeel with slight fizz. 7.6% ABV but it goes down easy."
""
"Overall: I think this beer is classified incorrectly. I would call it a pale ale perhaps? Just alright and I'm not sure I would have another."
"This beer isn't offense, it's just sort of there. It's fairly bland and the earthy/spicy finish wore on me after a while."
"O: This is okay, wish it had a little hop bite to it, just a bit. Then I would be all over this beer."
""
"Not a fan of this beer at all. I've enjoyed some of their other beers, but I'm content with skipping this one in the future."

"A nice biscuity malt complements some very well balanced citrus and pine hop notes that leave a lingering bitterness in the back. The citrus is of the orange rind variety in its dry and crisp mouthfeel and finish. Quick and clean feel but remains a full-bodied beer with that biscuity malt providing character beyand the hops. That malt tends to linger a bit in the aftertaste. Its smooth in front and then a little prickly in the back with the tingle of hops and booze. The warming alcohol is definitely detectable but adds another layer of depth to the beer. The hops really make this one as they are perfectly balanced in their bitterness, lending a nice complement to the malt bill and vice versa. The medium-high carbonation levels are nice, as the mouthfeel is the other part that makes this beer so enjoyably drinkable. This is a nice beer, full flavored and lots of character. I recommend and I would probably seek this out again."

"This is a very good to style beer that won't disappoint."
"o - Overall a decent beer, but not a winter warmer and certainly not a strong ale. Reminded me of a malty IPA, as it had some hops and nose real spices. Not bad, just not what I was expecting."
"O: Good for the style"
"O: I prefer my Winter Ales sweeter and maltier than this along with more prominent additives such as herbs and spices; this reminded me more of an IPA than anything."
"I like Elysian, their stuff is available, good priced and good tasting. Streak of zero not recommendeds for them still intact."
"mouthfeel - again light for a winter warmer, good carbonation, highly drinkable in the summertime and highly drinkable in general. good but not what i was expecting"
"Bottle from a private Vancouver store. Winter warmer in the summer to change things up from what is normally available. Pours light yellow with an orange tinge and a foamy white head that retains one quarter of an inch, lace shows through as I drink it. Malty and spicey aroma.Expecting lots of taste notes, I am getting mostly malt and then barley, hops, spice including ginger and cardommon, funegeek and cinammon. Average mouthfeel with drying finish. Decent drinkability."
"Poured a light copper with a nice white head and some carbonation visible. Sweet malts, and a bit of spice in the nose. Malty to the tongue, spice is very subdued, and not too distinctive for a winter warmer. A little citrus bitterness in there, maybe just a tad of pine or juniper. Light-medium body, a little harsh and not overly drinkable, for a style that usually promises sweetness and spice."
"A decent ale that is victimized by its mouthfeel; I didn't ask for any cotton in my beer!"
"O: The bad news is it's not what I expected in a winter warmer. the good news is that I am not a fan of most winter warmers. This could better be sold as a malted up IPA. I like it and in the end found it interesting. Bonus points for no added spice, just what's natural in the hops. Pretty good little brew."
"Pours an attrative hazed amber orange, nice cap of frothy white bubbles with good retention and nice lacing. Scent is fruit forward with grapefruit, tangerine, mango and orange all present, touches of piney and spicy hops with a smooth and lightly sweet carmel backbone and a kiss of seasonal spices. Taste again makes with think IPA with a sold fruity hop profile but backed by a solid, yet not cloyingly sweet light carmel and butterscotch backbone. Medium bodied, feels smooth and slightly coating of the mouth. Unqiue in its construction, big citrus and fruity hop profile, big carmel and butterscotch backbone, both wrk exceptionally well together."
"Surprisingly light in colour, sort of an English strong ale with some additional American hops."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a huge edge of carbonation. There carb hits with the bitterness and is quite harsh. Lingering citrus bitterness. Overall, this one is decent but nothing spectacular. It could use something to tie it all together."
"Nice Winter beer that is really a Double IPA with some citrus notes and a generous helping of hops. I also detected some piney flavour that reminded me of the spruce tips in the Alaskan Winter Ale. Very drinkable but still complex enough to sip. Winter Warmers come in many styles"
"Overall, not my favorite winter warmer as the bitterness upfront was a little unbalanced. The ""warmer"" from the alcohol burn and the ending sweetness was excellent."
"An nice brew...the alcohol warmth isn't intrusive, and it sort of sneaks up on you. That said, I've had winter beers that are morre cloying and exhibit a higher alcohol burn -even at a lower ABV."
"A very good WW - I'm a fan."
"Not sure if this should be classified as a winter warmer since it really has nothing in common with the style. American Strong Ale seems like a better fit."
"This was by easily the cheapest bomber on the shelf, and my only other experience with Elysian was a good one, so I decided to pick this up. Pours a dark, clear, golden orange with a bone white head. Big foamy head that never really goes away and leaves thick chunky lace. Scent is citrus hops and orange rind. Taste is subtle hops and spice up front with a sweet malty backbone, some alcohol in the finish. Medium bodied and not as carbonated as it looks. Honestly I had a hard time rating this one. A good beer but not at all what I expected for a winter warmer. I know it's a winter seasonal but it feels kind of mislabeled as a winter warmer."
"Pleasing mouthfeel, medium body with a bite of carbonation."
"Over all a really nice beer but I was expecting more of a winter warmer than a dipa."
"Super lacing too. Very good, and not in spite of its closer resembles to DFH 90 than Harpoon's Winter Warmer. A left coast winter, I suppose."
"22oz bottle $4.49. Nice orange color, looks like an IPA or something, I almost expected it to be brown. Smell was odd and the taste was worse. It really had this weird orange rind flavor, citrusy in a very bad way. The alcohol was noticable and overall I just didn't care for this beer at all. At least it was not very expensive."
"D - Highly enjoyable and drinkable, with an ABV that won't put you under the table. I'll be rating this one more on overall taste then to style."
"A surprising and clear dichotomy of sweetness upfront and bitter linger. Flavors are clear and bright, not what I expect in a winter ale as it has an almost springtime feel to it but it's just malty enough to keep you from shivering in the cold. It's also not what I would like in a winter warmer but this is just fantastic, simple yet well done."
"Poured into a imperial nonic a dull burnt orange color with a large well formed sticky egg shell colored head that took its time settling into creamy froth.Aromas are on the lighter side mainly earthy hops along with some overripe citrus,the palate is quite dry with earthy hop being the main component,faint citrus fruit and a crisp malt base are the other maint points.A decent brew but it might be a little to dry and earthy for my tastes."
"This was a pretty good beer. Perhaps mis-classified as I would not consider a traditional winter warmer, it is a good beer."
"Overall this is a fairly good beer but but was I was expecting a much maltier beer because it is a winter warmer. This is almost like an IPA. Not bad, but really nothing spectacular."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I can't quite put my finger on what style this beer fits into. It's tasty, but I'm just not a huge fan of this one, it just seems to taste more like your average run of the mill IPA rather than a special winter brew. Not bad, worth trying..."
"Drinkability: a damn drinkable ale for 7.5%. Elysian is not necessarily my favorite brewery, but this beer rather floats my boat. Good stuff."
"D: I've been real into winter warmer beers lately and this one for me is just ok...definately one of my least favorite Elysian beers"
"The Bifrost is an angelic creature, mightily ringed like Saturn, and orange like its glower. It appears the recipe has changed from centennial to simcoe bittering (according to their menu) and the smoothness of the bitterness I would attribute to this alteration. Bristle and pine, slight earthy spice and floral. Big aromas but I'm not getting much citrus, a hint perhaps. The finish is amarillo and styr goldings. A little bit of sweet bread. Tastes like these hops are licking your teeth, nice bitterness, but very sticky and very delicious. Dangerous folks over there, crafting this beast."
"Overall a nice winter beer. It does warm you up a bit but it is not dominated by malt like many winter beers. Not a fantastic beer but it is quite tasty."
"4/4/4/4/5"
"This time, was it ever!"
"NOTE: This is one of the first craft brews that I fell in love with a number of years ago. I always look forward to this release. And I always think that, as I expand my craft brew palate, I'll come to like this less. It's never been true. This is a great beer. Elysian! Well done."
"Elysian Brewing Company, Inc., Seattle Washington And Fort Collins, Colorado, USA.--ELYSIAN Bifrost Winter Ale--""Winter Ale--Bifrost is our lively seasonal-bold with citrus and earthy hops and balanced with smooth malt character."" 2010--22 oz. Bottle Release. 7.60% ABV. 40 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Winter IPA. Thin mild lace white head. Clear bright soft dark gold color. Mellow hop toasted hint delicate floral front. Mild creamy cloying mild sweet rich mild fruit light caramel crystal smooth malt body. Mild earthy hop spice balanced clean citrus hint end. Overwhelmed by Immortal Hops. Tasted 10/11-12/2010. Purchased for $4.49 2 Fred Meyer--Ballard on 10/8/2010."
"Good hoppy winter brew. Could be richer, have more malt character. Still very good. Nice bitterness."
"Bi frost looks like a lighter version of a winter warmer from looks alone, it's not as dark as most in the spectrum. Hazed golden with burnt orange with some coppa. Nice sheet of lace on the way down.when real cold this smells like a pale malted monster with sweet malt galore. Some warming brings forth some light spice but not one type I can put my finga on. Taste is the same, sweet malt completely engulfs this beer when cold but warming brings spice. A very lightly spiced warmer here, this one is hard to describe, kinda simple body is medium with a malty sweet profile. Carb on the low end. This aint half bad, one of the easier drinking winter warmers I've had. I would go for another."
"Check out my beerfly review on the brewery."
"Overall drinkable if only that it's alot like water."
"Pours cloudy and golden with a decent white head. Smells sweet and fruity. Taste is strongly fruity, apricot, banana, pineapple. Caramel with slight bitterness, slightly citrusy finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick."
"D - Never expected this to be 7.5% until I started this review. Would have guessed 6% tops - went down that easy and quite enjoyable."
"Overall I'm not quite sure what this beer is trying to be. It's pretty good, but I'd like to know what they were going for instead of just some spiel about a rainbow bridge and such."
"D: I know the style says Winter Warmer, but this is pretty much a straight ahead American IPA in my book. It's a nice beer that doesn't really stand out in this overcrowded style. As with the other Elysian beers I've had, I'm curious as to how true this contract brewed version is to the original."
"The body is much lighter than most of the style. This beer is very drinkable, I look forward to multiple pints every winter. As I said, I'm surprised my score isn't higher. Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me or maybe it's a result of Elysians partnership with New Belgium, but I remember this beer being darker, heartier and more robust in the past. Certainly still worth your time."
"Decent brew. For a winter warmer, a style I find myself generally unimpressed by, this is a drinkable beer."
"Sweet, a little hoppy, lots of sweet malts and sugary. Thick fruitiness. Can taste the Munich and crystal malts, honey like the midas touch in the faintest of notes."
"I found this highly drinkable - a good, non-threatening gateway beer for those looking to introduce something new to their BMC friends this holiday season."
"A very good beer. not what i was really expecting though, but i dont know where to place this beer. Not a APA OR IPA but i wouldnt call it a winter warmer. It's very interesting and I would try it again."
"A winter ale that manages to succeed without spices. Bifröst (silly name - also, Elysian's new packaging is not my cup of tea) is a pleasant-looking, mildly hazy, copper-colored affair with a creamy, lasting head. This beer has an interesting blend of European and American hop aromas, grapefruits and grass. It's much more hop assertive than I was expecting, but there is a definite doughy malt presence. The taste is mildly dry with a pleasant, medium bitterness. It's a medium-bodied beer with a touch of wateriness in the finish. The finish is nice and bitter. Good beer for a change of pace in the hops department."
"Maybe the beers will improve with practice, but I'll wait and see before buying anything else in this series. Perhaps I'll just have to make a trip to the Northwest to try them at the source one of these days."
"Good drinkability but at 7.5% abv drink it in moderation."
"Overall a tasty hop driven ale."
"Elysian has become one of my favorite breweries. I wish they would do six packs, I can't always squeeze in the time for a bomber. Sadly."
"From notes. Thick, frothy white head, good retention, very active, thick lacing. Golden/light amber, mostly clear. SMELL sweet malty, and grapefruity. Prominent at first, but harder to find later. TASTE rich malty sweetness joined by citrusy and floral hoppy flavors, blending and balancing nicely, with rising bitterness and booze at the finish. FEEL rich texture, full body, clean-ish finish with a bite and some warming. OVERALL each sip begs another. goes down smooth and easy."
"Love Elysian and they have some solid brews but this one doesn't really stack up compared to other year round brews."
"Overall: A very hoppy example of the style. Hop bitterness and spice overshadows what malt there is. More malt presence would help balance the astringency in the finish."
"First sip reveals an average body with average carbonation. Flavor is some grainy malt notes and caramel and then rolls to a hit of peppery booze and some generally bitey hops. The beer isnt quite what I expected when I purchased but it was enjoyable, just crisper and more bite than anticipated."
"Very smooth. Thick fruitiness. Thick taste."
"Notes: purchased from the discount rack at Halftime Beverage in Poughkeepsie for $2.99 in early-to-mid-May -- it was about a month past its ""best by"" date at that point, so I took a chance. I put it in the DBF right away and drank it about a month later. I didn't get any ""off"" notes or evident oxidation, so I think it was OK. Perhaps there would've been more of a hoppy character had I drank it back in March, however. I'd certainly consider getting a fresh one next winter, though I must admit the regular $5.99 sticker might lead me somewhere else. . . ."
"M/D - alot lighter than I was expecting, nice flavor and mouthfeel, but nothing too overpowering."
"Interestingly enough, a friend of mine who works in a beer store recommended this as a great summer beer...much better than the normal, light summer swill that everyone else want to sell...I'm stocking up!"
"Sample at the Pike Street location. This beer pours a clear orange color with a medium off-white head that dissipates slowly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Spicy aroma with notes of malt and fruit. Medium-bodied with flavors of toasted malt, honey and sweet spices, followed by mild hops and fruit. The finish is sweet and spiced with light hops and citrus aftertaste. Decent all around."
"The beer pours a hazy orange color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a grainy, pale and crystal malt scent with some bisquit characteristics. There is an excellent hop aroma as well. The taste is good. It has a very smooth, malty flavor that really showcases the pale and Munich malts. It goes down easy with a stiff hop bitterness and grainy finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great winter warmer. It's not all spiced up. It's just a solid beer with added alcohol and hops."
"A 7.5 ABV is hidden well and it really is a good winter beer. Not heavy and had good aroma and flavor."
"I should note as well, that this is contract brewed by new Belgium, and has a laser-printed date of 10 APR 09 on the label - I'm guessing a ""best by"" date. As this is 2 March 09, it's in-code but pretty close, however, I don't find a single note of oxidation. What I'm picking up is clearly Munich malts and soft caramel, and the hop flavors are right on. SO, in addition to kudos for Elysian, I have to also give kudos to New Belgium. A charming and enticing beer to be sure!!!"
"A tasty malt forward ale which bucks the typical winter trends."
"Well, I don't know what the umlaut is all about, but the beer itself is a warm, blended batch of winter solace. The aroma could offer a little more but it's very solid otherwise. The ABV is cozy and fits well with the seasonal motif. I can't think of any reason I wouldn't be happy to find this under my tree."
"Elysian's primary winter beer shows an exceptionally clear pale ale color with exuberant carbonation sustaining a carpet of lumpy white foam and striated lace. It delivers an unexpected fruitiness given its paleness and clarity, along with a punky marshmallow aroma. But it is an easy drinking beer to the last with firm bittering and an irresistibly smooth body. A winter ale warmly received."
"golden pour with a hazy amber center. bubbles struggle through a visual thickness. a creamy layer of thin head exists. aroma exudes sweetness, reminiscent of orange blossom honey and caramel malts. the first introduction of this beer to the palate screams thickness and heat, which is welcome at the 7.5% level on a chilly winter night. the predominant fruity aspect of the prominent amarillo hops compliment the honey notes perfectly. the beer finishes with a faint planty bitterness and a zip of taut carbonation. with warmth, the hop profile opens up and allows more earthy bitterness to appear in the finish. the beer appears to transform itself from a golden strong ale to an extra pale ale with an additional 10 degrees fahrenheit. not the most complex, but a nice hearty sipper that offers respite from a season full of big stouts and barleywines."
"D: Medium body balanced with the carbonation. A little too much heat to be sessionable. Could very well improve with a couple of months in the bottle."
"Drinkability: this is a hearty ale that is great on a cold evening. The bomber bottle is a nice size for this one."
"D: The flavor was fairly unique and quite different per style, though not one I would drink in multiples or find particularly warming like most winter brews. More funky and sour then anything with a good helping of bitter hoppiness and sour tangerine character makes this an intriquing try thought with limited repeatability."
"There is a good burn from the alcohol. A nice one for the winter season"
" I couldn't taste or feel the alcohol in this and I'm quite suprised that it's 7.50%. If I was given this without looking at the label, I would feel that it would be an offering from Sierra Nevada, since the consistency and moutfeel was similar to the pale ale; especially in the carbonation. Regardless, this was a good beer but given another chance, I'd wait until it was a bit warmer outside before I had it again."
"Final Musings: A very hoppy seasonal in the vein of SN Celebration, but not as good. Probably could drink the whole bottle myself, but I'd be craving something with a little more spice and malt afterwards. There really was not much in the way of spices that I could pick up."
"taste is a bit watery, light grapefruit, hops, apricot, some pine, spice, a touch of white pepper, and some malt is hiding in the back, ends slightly on the dry side."
"Drinkability: Elysian likes to make things a bit different, sometimes (think Jasmine IPA), and this falls into that category; I don't love it but I sure do like it quite a bit"
"Pours a dirty golden color with some orange highlights and a pure white head that left some mighty fine lacing on the glass. The aroma is fairly bready with a subtle juicy hop. Looks like the makings of an APA. The taste is malty sweet with a touch of hoppy bitterness. A nice bready malt with a dab of honey and a nice juicy hop flavor profile. Hops used more for flavor than for bittering. The feel is thick and chewy, soft carbonation leads to a nice silky feel, finishes sweet. An enjoyable brew, though not sure of the winter warmer status. A nice malty APA."
"Pours a transparent amber orange color with a large 3 finger peachy white head. Faint nose of clean pale malt, husky grain and gentle bitter hops. Citrus fruit, brown sugar, herbal/earthy notes and caramel on the tongue, im really enjoying the fruity bitter blast just before the finish. Warming for sure, but the alcohol doesnt seems maybe a bit too apparent, muddling the beers main profile. Fairly drinkable, definitely a good alternative to some of the over spiced winter offerings out there, it just doesnt strike me as anything to write home about."
"Taste is earthy bitter hops, some breadiness, good amount of sweet malt character to offset the hop bitters. A bit of fruit in the finish. Medium dry bitter finish. Very nice beer. Tastes like a very full bodied Pale Ale. Some blessed relief from the brown sugar winter warmers."
"Winter seasonals are usually dark and malty. Elysians BiFrost is a good mix of malts and hops and it appears to be unfiltered. I suggest drinking this one at a very cold temperature (near freezing) for best flavor. I think that New Belgium's mass production of this beer has hurt the overall quality and flavor profile. Still an average to good selection at a reasonable price for a bomber."
"Warming. There is a bitter hop balance to the sweetness and spicing. Not bad, just not a big fan of it. I like hoppy winter beers - but, this just didn't go in the right direction for me to think anything great of it. A bit too bready to boot."
"Overall- Not horrible but just didn't dig this 1. I couldn't detect any r eal flavors because ofthe boozy alcohol. I really wanted to like this 1. Give it a shot, my taste buds are strange!"
"This was a very nice Winter Warmer. it pours up a murky copper color with a white head. the nose was very bready and there was something else that I couldn't put my finger on. the taste is subtle hops, bready, subtle malts, earthy, full bodied...nice"
"Nick: B- (3.50)"
"D - A tasty ale , but it kind of lost my interest - a bomber is good, but not a stand out among some very good beers in Elysian's lineup."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and light, but just kind of bland."
"Mouthfeel is pleasantly rich and creamy, with ample carbonation and a spicy finish. A very drinkable winter warmer, though it is lacking in depth and could be a bit darker for me."
"Delicious stuff..."
"Elysian, Im glad I finally tryed them"
"Bottle from Spruce Street Market in Philly, pours golden amber with a frothy white head, mild hop aroma with a slightly sweet cereal note as well, taste is hoppy up front, sweet, with a malty and slightly dry finish, good mouthfeel - not too heavy, not too light, well balanced beer."
"D: Very unique and very drinkable. I expected something different but Elysian has put a cool spin on the Winter Warmer."
"Bomber bottle, pours lighter amber, with an orange glow, off white tiny bubble head, long lasting, frothy and then leaving real nice fine lace and plenty of fine sheeting. Muted bready nose. This one looks and drinks more like an American Pale then a WW. Creamy and pleasing on the tongue. Hops come through loud and clear. Grainy and citric and then smooth and mellow in the finish. Real nice moderately hoppy sessioner. A pleasant seasonal new comer to the Elysian line. Well worth a try"
"Pours a wonderfully thick creamy head and never quits. Aroma is yeasty with a nose full of malts. Taste is very creamy and a very nice bite of the Golding hops. Almost like a cream ale but oh so much better. A hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. Highly recommended. Reviewed the 2008 version."
"D: Nice complexity in an easy-drinking beer. I could sit down with a few of these."
"Pours a nice hazy orange color, nice carbonation, nice small fizzy off-white head, minimal sticky lacing on this one. The nose is malty/hoppy, nice tones of citrus/pines, with some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, nice blend of malts/hops, the citrus/pines are a nice touch, with some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, recommended."
"Very different winter warmer, but the 7+ % alcohol will light a fire, although very sneakily. Give one a try when next years batch comes out."
"Drinkability: A solid beer. Something a little different for a winter seasonal."
"Pours amber with a relatively thin head but some decent lacing. Aromas of sweet malt, grain, and a bit of light spice as well as some yeasty esters with a bit of pear and apple in them. Taste is somewhat sweet to start, but becomes more savory with grain, breadiness, some bitter, and almost a meatiness like roast pork. Somewhat slick mouthfeel, and a litttle viscous as well. I don't love this beer, but its fairly interesting and pretty pleasant even if the flavors develop a litle strangely."
"Drinks a bit slow, due to complexity, but this is one damn fine winter warmer or DIPA! I'll certainly check out other brews from Elysian!"
"excellent winter brew, not too bitter or strong, but so so so tasty, this is yet another exclamation point of a great beer for this fine micro brewery out of seattle, this place continues to produce some of the best beer in the northwest and this big guy is awesome, I had this beer in a 22 ounce bottle and cried when it was gone, I want more!"
"The BiFrost is a cloudy light orange. The bottle comes in a plain label with no freshness date. I am a big fan of Jubelale and this is a nice alternative. The BiFrost leaves a nice sudsy lacing after math on the side of the glass. The smell is of mellow malt and pine. In the taste I get the pineness and cinnamon and cloves. It leaves a nice bitter malt that is a little chewy going down. It is a good winter brew."
"Not a real drinkable beer. The bourbon flavors are a bit strong, and the ABV makes is less than sessionable. I had one, and I'll pass this one up again."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a pint glass, the BiFrost is a bright clear, orangish amber color with a thick, white head, leaving behind a sticky, beautifully patterned lace. The aroma is bright and fruity, mainly peach and some citrus, with some piny hops, sweet malt and alcohol. The taste is malty but not too thick, with caramel and sweet fruit esters, a very bitter hop finish and a lot more alcohol bite than is necessary for the 7.5% ABV. Like the taste, the mouthfeel is nicely balanced and quite pleasant, helping the BiFrost goes down quite nicely, but the overly bitter aftertaste prevents this warmer from being all that drinkable right now. I have another bottle in the cellar, so I'm curious to see how it matures over the next year, but I doubt I've have trouble holding out that long..."
"Easily, one of the most impressive limited offerings I've had recently...certainly not your ""typical"" winter warmer, but was perfect for me."
"Poured from the 22oz bottle in to a pint glass. Body is a bright golden hue with a huge, sligthtly creamy, stark white head that leaves some beautiful lacing on the glass. Aroma of piney hops and sweet pale malt, with a nice whiff of alcohol thrown in for good measure. Palate is nicely balaced between pale malt and piney hops, with light fruity notes lingering in the background and a touch of mustiness from the yeast. Finish is nice and clean, with just a little bit of warming from the alcohol. Body is smooth and just a tad sticky, a very good consistency for this type of ale. I think I'm going to be drinking a lot of this until it goes away for the season."
"This is a beautiful beer...a wonderful beer...and more a winter IPA than a winter warmer and I love it for that."
"Taste is robust in it's malts - chewy browns compliment the addition of spices and a warming alcoholic sensation. Finishes with a dry palate."
"I found this a nice enough beer, but i think for me one bomber at a sitting is enough..the bitter aftertaste tends to deter another bottle."
"I love Elysian beer, so I fully expected to love Bifrost as much I love The Immortal IPA, The Wise ESB, Night Owl Pumpkin and all the rest. Although it doesn't quite rise to those heights, it's still a worthwhile seasonal from a brewery that deserves much more attention than it gets."
"Mucho yummy stuff. Must find book, toolie, toolie, orange sky is beautiful, yum-yum...huh..."
"Pours a golden orange with a very dissapointing head that failed to rise. The aroma is of light citrus peel and spices. The taste is light but packs a very heavy hop punch, suprising. Very tasty, more like a Double IPA than winter, still nice. A perfect beer for those cold Northwest nights."
"This beer poured a gorgeous deep honey color with a fair head and some moderate lacing. It was quite fragrant with a very fruity scent which immediately reminded me of strawberries. mouthfeel was rich with a bit of syrup texture which coated the mouth, the only real downpoint was that after swallowing there wasn't much finish. Overall a great, very drinkable winter ale that is hearty and warming...just what a winter ale should be."
"A very nice drinking big beer. Even though the body is pretty huge, doesn't seem overly strong."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" off-white head above the light amber brew. Head is doughy and hangs around, with sticky lacing. Aroma is pleasantly of piney hops, a nice change for me from some of the over-spiced brews that end up in this style. Taste is light yet ample maltiness up front, quickly overtaken by the aforementioned piney hops character, which segues ever so gently into the slightest spicing at the close. Alcohol warming sneaks up on you. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. A great NW interpretation of a style that isn't always my favorite, I must admit. Find this one, it's worth the effort."
"Notes: Good solid beer. Very drinkable. I will be buying this one again."
"Drinkability is above average. Alcohol permeates a tad too much to be a great beer but true to style."
"Pours a hazy orange-copper color, it is topped by a frothy light tan head. The aroma smells initially of hops, with notes of citrus, and pine. As I dig deeper, the hops are all that I really can smell, notes of orange, wildflowers, and spicy herbs. The beer is actually quite tasty, with a somewhat light palate, but it is quite mouth coating. It is a nicely hoppy beer, with notes of citrus and pine, plus a sharply bitter finish that has a certain hoppy astringency to it. This is quite a nice hoppy pale ale/ IPA, hops for the holiday. I certainly like this beer, though it is certainly nothing like I was expecting it to be. It is quite simplistic in it's hoppiness (no real maltiness to back it up), but sometimes that hits the spot."
"Pours a dark amber with little head. Hoppy floral aroma with a hint of malty sweetness. Slightly sweet taste balanced with grapefruitty hops, lingering hop aroma. Body was moderate, not too thick, not too thin. A very smooth beer for it's abv, and a drinkable one at that."
"Not what I'd expect in a winter warmer, with qualities I associate more with certain Belgian ales...however, it falls short of being more than merely good."
"Pours amber with minimal head. Drops to a wisp of bubbles. Hoppy nose and slight sweetness - honey. Starts with mild sweetness which is taken out by nice hop bittering. Grapefruit and pineapple flavors with just a hint of cinammon. The bittering is intense on the finish, which also welcomes a pronounced alcohol warming. Very long bitter finish. Not traditional winter warmer, but a northwest hop oriented warmer. Nice."
"Overall a solid seasonal IPA."
"The beer as it disembogues from the bottle a deep translucent copper color with a prodigious sized, frothy and a off white head, as it dissipates the lace forms a thick and concealing sheet to obscure the glass. The nose has a nice hop floral crispness at the front, the middle sweet malt, finish is crisp and clean, and start is sweet and has a nice malt profile with the top light to moderate in feel. Finish is benignly carbonated, the hop spiciness quite pronounced, aftertaste is desert dry and long lasting with a bit of a Tummy warming from the 7.5 percent ABV, if theres a problem with this beer it seems a bit thin body wise, but nonetheless a fine drinking beer and a great brewery that produces a fine line of beers overall."
"Notes: Thanks to RoyalT for this great offering."
"Update  The 05 vintage is more of the same. This edition by Elysian is wonderfully consistent and one o f the best wintertime beer available in the PacNW."
