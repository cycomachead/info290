review_text
"I'm generally fond of Winter Warmers and similar spiced up holiday beers, so I was surprised that I didn't take to this one all that much.   It seemed a bit of a muddle, with various flavors there, but not really working well together.   A bit too sweet.  It's still a decent beer, don't get me wrong, but just not to my taste.   This was the 2014 edition, poured into a tulip.   Foamy!"

"Don't know where to buy this, a friend gave me as a gift. After a gentle pour the amount of foamy head created was more than I expected but it finally calmed down to soft pillow of foam. The beer itself is a hazed brownish orange with very fine bubbles of carbonation. Flavor is settled and plain with a sweet malty base and touch of spice that sticks out enough to make for a decent holidays ale."

"This one poured out as a brown color with a tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer was a little on the spicy side but nothing too crazy really. The taste of the beer didn't really give off the vanilla I was hoping for like it said on the label. The herbs and spices took over most of the flavor. The mouthfeel of this beer was a little on the heavier side. Overall this beer wasn't too bad but I felt a little disappointed by it."
"Overall: A pretty nice beer and somewhat indulgent winter warmer."

"Their bottle caps really cry out to be gently Pop!ped off since they can definitely be reused by artistic types. Upon completion of this arduous task, foam began to rise up through the neck of the bottle, prompting me to begin the gentlest of pours, so as not to rouse the lees at the bottom. This, of course, created only wisps for head, so I employed the Server’s Trick and got a finger of French Vanilla-colored head which fizzed out pretty quickly. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "
"All in all, fantastic winter beer. One of the first I've had from Hitachino (the White Ale was pretty great, but its a bank-breaker) and piques my interest to try more!"
"The bottle opened with a loud hiss so I was a bit concerned with oxidization but it is pleasantly only faint. Medium bodied which is on the fuller end with soft carbonation up front and a very heavy spice character. Lots of pepper, coriander, clove, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg immediately which is slowly countered by a silky caramel malt presence and a good bit of dark fruit. Hints of toffee, hazelnut, dark cherry, plum, fig and other berries. I've had this fresh and it has definitely mellowed out with six years age. The ABV is very well masked with only some slight alcohol sweetness but no heat or warmth in the finish resulting in a complex quaffable beer. The intense spice character hurts the drinkability a bit but this beer has aged nicely."
"wow. completely textbook perfect with an edge of something nice and delectably warm, carbonated, malty, and spiced. pour is a cloudy dark amber with a very ample head about 3 fingers.. nose of orangepeel, clove and coriander, some burnt and toasty and a nice thick blanket of esters and toasty malt. the palate gave way to something fantastic of a blend of all those qualities. nice and toasted sesame seeds, clove rich, candied orangepeel and a backbone of bit-o-honey and chocolate. it tastes like liquid fruit cake. every aspect of a winter warmer spot on."
"Not sure what they are going for here but the body is very muddy, muddled and murky. Doesn't really look appealing at all but this is a first for me so I will still give it an average. Smell is full of nutmeg and cinnamon with a twist of orange. Reminds me of thanksgiving dinner with a dash of Christmas. Now I am getting a good eggnog vibe. Good job on this part. The citrus really comes thru in the front. Doesn't smooth out much but the spices come thru in dashes in the end and mellows out into a mostly nutmeg taste. Mouthfeel is clean and mellow. Although tasty not something I can picture drinking a lot of. Good stuff but I would like to point out trying Lakewood Holiday Spice Lager if you like this."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. The flavors and character are very complex and different from most of the style and are extremely varied."
"Creamy body and carbonation, although higher carbonation would do well to cut the bitterness."
"Overall a decent beer but disappointing. I would love to try it fresh because it may not have been aged properly (I only bought it 6 months ago) so I'll keep my eye out for more."
"Poured hazy orange color with a large frothy white head that was mostly lasting with fair lacing. Moderate spice and fruit aroma. Light to medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium spicy sweet flavor with a medium spice finish of moderated duration. Refreshing complex beer."
"It tastes as it smells. I don't usually enjoy darker beers, but this was fantastic! I would definitely buy it again and I think it is a good step into the darker beers."
"Like most reviewers this beer gushed out and made a glass of foam that took forever to calm down. This is a very carbonated beer that tasted much lighter than the ABV suggests. I felt that was tasting a Saison with added spices which is pretty different for a Winter Warmer. I liked the flavours though a little less carbonation would have helped the mouthfeel and finish."
"This is a drinkable beer. I'm not so keen on the gushing, but this more than makes up for it in the complex flavor & real warmth."
"A medium, creamy body. Carbonation is fairly forward. This is a winter beer that drinks well in the summer."
"Mouthfeel was medium full. This was easily drinkable as a sipper."
"overall too sweet for my liking."
"This guy was a bit of a gusher. Pours an opaque deep mahogany with a decent head. Smells a bit sour initially with some raisins and ginger. Lots of yeasty notes as well. The taste is quite sweet, but not overbearing. The overall combination of spices gives this beer a weird taste. The mouthfeel is solid. Good carbonation and thickness."
"11.2 ounce bottle, expensive at over $4! Oh no, this is real expensive when it turns out to be a gusher upon opening. My immediate thought was expensive drain pour..but after the gush, the huge head and the excess foaming, this one settled down to a murky very dark brown, under a dark tan, mottled head that left blobs of thick lacing. A load of pungent nutmeg/cinnamon in the nose. More heavy spicing on the tongue, as well as plenty of caramel/toffee and rich, velvety smooth, thick wintery goodness. Interesting stuff. Too expensive to go to often, but worth a (large) splurge to see what is going on here."
"Actually, aside from the carbonation, this was a pleasnat beer and definitely different than any other Asian product I've had."
"A good mouthfeel on this one, the spices linger on the tastebuds a while after each sip. High marks for drinkability as well, could definitely go for multiple in one sitting."
"Poured a deep cloudy amber color ale with a nice off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of nutmeg and cinnamon is well balance with the sweet caramel malt profile. Taste is a mix between some deep caramel malt with loads of spices which may includes cinnamon and nutmeg. Body is full and beer is very rich with no apparent alcohol and some good carbonation. I very much enjoy this one even though it is quite filling and wouldn't drink more then one at a time. I ma starting to really enjoy beer from this brewery and looking forward to more discovery."
"D: Just too much going on. It is a love it hate it brew. At first taste I liked it, but as I consumed more it became undrinkable. It is just a little too overthetop."
"Full and satisfying mouthfeel, just right on the cabonation. A bit spicy to drink more than one, but easy to sip, very good. Gives any winter warmer a run for the money."
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured a slightly hazy orange brown with a tight-knit head that leaves some sticky lacing. Sweet bready aromas up front followed by some bright fruit and spicebox aromas. The taste is nicely balanced beetween spice, mixed fruit- including plums and pears, breadiness, cardomom, pepper, cinammon and clove. I like this a bit better on draft, probably because the creaminess is accentuated and the spices become less bitter. Delicious, and a nice change of pace. Great to find this on tap- I always appreciate this brewery's products."
"D: The 9% is hidden fairly well. But it is a strong beer, so I think I would limit myself to one out of respect for my fellow man. My bottle was overcarbonated, maybe shaken in the case on the way home. So it took a while to pour and drink, but overall a very tasty beer."
"My first beer from Kiuchi Brewery and I gotta say I really liked it. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a nice barleywine or old ale."
"I love this beer for its sheer weirdness and depth of character. Bizarre and delicious, this may be the best thing out of the gate for the Kiuchi crowd. In the words of a certain famous Japanese TV personality, it's a TOTAL SUCCESS!"
"Pours with an out of control head, taking about 30 mins from opening the bottle until I got a proper sip in. After the wait the appearance is a nice blood red with some hazy brown mixed in. The smell is rather begian with spices and dark fruits. The flavor is complex starting with some bready yeast and going into some cinnamon orange and darker fruits. The mouthfeel is not as big as I would expect even though the carbonation is a bit over the top. AS for drinkability i can feel some of the heat from 9%, but it is mostly warming and pleasant . Im pretty impressed with this one, i will have to try other from Kiuchi."
"2007 version. After a bit of gushing upon popping the cap, the beer itself possesses a massive head that fades to a thick centimeter beer covering. The body is cloudy and russet colored with tinges of mahogany; it's very pretty. The nose is vibrant with spices: orange peel, nutmeg, and cinnamon are most prominent. There are some hints of vanilla as well, but little in the way of malt or hops. On the palate, sharp citrus notes from the orange peel come in first off, then the vanilla comes through with a vengeance. The other spices play more of a supporting role along with the subdued, sweet malts and background-only bittering hops. In spite of the gushing, the beer is nicely, albeit substantially, carbonated. Overall, this is an excellent winter warmer and one that I will most likely seek out in future years."
"Overall its a good beer and I look forward on trying more from this brewery."
"2004 vintage. Murky bronze color with a gnarly big bubbly pillow three-fingered off-white head. Nose of candi sugar and spice. Flavors of maple, candi sugar, and milder holiday spices. This was real good, and gave plenty of beers from Belgium a serious run for their money."
"Prost!"
"A ridiculously spicy, dessert-y beer, but superbly balanced, and without the thickness many similar beers might bring with it. Bright and lively...not anything near an everyday-beer, considering its bold spices and high ABV, but if you want a quality walk on the spiced side, there aren't many better choices than this."
"This is a very interesting, style-defying brew. Absolutely worth trying if you can find it."
"The beer pours a somewhat hazy copper with a fine off white heat that has a nice creamy texture, erodes quickly leaving a paper-thin coating of lace. Nose is sweet with fruit and malt, citrus like in its crispness, bit of sourness also noted, and a bit of musk. Start is quite sweet with a nice malt presence and a spicy back, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish has a biting acidity, hops passable, fruit like sweetness carries to the dry aftertaste; enjoy this breweries beers, different maybe, generally worth a sample."
"Pours a cloudy cider color with a thin fizzy head and good lace. It smells of cherry and nutmeg, spicey lemon and vanilla, very complex and interesting. The flavor is a bit strong with heavy alcohol like brandy. I pick up more nutmeg with citrus bitterness and a sweet cherry/orange base. Thick bodied and strong, not real drinkable for me but very interesting. This brewery intrigues me so far so I will explore further. But I won't drink a lot of this one. A taste treat in small quantities on occasion."
"D- easy enough to drink , although there is a higher abv it's hidden well BUT i don't reccomend making a session out of this one. Would buy this again , to share, with those who would appreciate it but not for something to be enjoyed regularly"
"D - A tasty spiced ale - very well layered and nice vanilla addition. The bottle conditioning kept it fresh and flavorful. It gets a bit intense as it gets to room temperature. I would definitely pick up another bottle to try this winter."
"Edit: as the drink warms up I smelt and tasted more of the orange peel. The vanilla was almost overpowered w/ the Orange...but it's still there. Luckily the spice stays w/ the drink even as it warms up"
"2006 bottle. Pours a hazy honeyed amber. Reminds me of a barleywine, but cloudier. Short, tight beige head that leaves good lacing. Interesting smells that are hard to pin down. Very malty, no hops, black tea maybe? Some vanilla...Hard to say. Taste is not so mysterious. Mega Malt Bomb all the way. Some vanilla and spice in the background. Alcohol fairly well hidden. Great mouthfeel, but the taste is just not to my liking. Drinkablity is fine. So far, my least favorite offering from this brewery."
"Overall: Pretty ""good"" nothing too amazing, this brew could use a bit of reworking. It is overpriced for what you get. Still probably one of my favorite labels of all time."
"Cheers!"
"Sadly, the odd hop taste blows all the other flavours in this beer out of the glass. It tastes like the Japanese brewers attempted to reproduce a dark trippel (and a good one!) but then botched it on the hops, or possibly even accidentally mixed in some lactobacills? Would try another vintage, though, perhaps it needs more time in the bottle, or the coming years will see refinement."
"flavor is nice enough though, the balance is greater than my own attempts at a celebration style ale... Malt palette is a bit toastier and darker than others i've had. Hoppy bitterness is mellowed too, perhaps due to 3 years in a bottle. I don't love the celebration style, and I think it has turned a little."
"Body is medium, slick and velvet smooth. Mouthffeel is a bit dull due to the fine carbonation, but this is a very tastey and unique brew."
"A completely different take on a winter warmer."
"D: One is enough, the alcohol is hidden but when it hits, it does so with a vengence."
"This is a very interesting beer and would expect nothing less from Hitachino. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, this beer looks and smells pretty great, but the flavor just doesn't deliver. Hitachino is definitely a hit or miss brewery in my opinion, and this is no exception. There are much better spiced winter warmers out there, and considering that this one was lackluster and almost $4 for 12oz, I think I'll be sticking to those others. Personally, I won't be buying this again, although I probably will try next years vintage. Perhaps this one just needs some serious cellar time..."
"My first impression of this beer was how spicy it was! It was hard to describe or pinpoint. The flavor was bright floral and almost soapy. I would describe this as tart, rather than bitter. And the tartness balanced the delicious sweetness very well. I don't have much to compare this to, it was so unique. So far, I love the beers this brewery is putting out!"
"Poured into pint mug, formed 3 1/2"" of tan head over the clear dark copper brew. Head fades down reasonably quickly for its size, you can see the huge bubbles popping before your eyes, but it still takes a while to fade down to a reasonable height, with actually somewhat minimal lacing for the head presence. Aroma is predominantly sweet and spicy. Taste is sweet upfront, equal parts spices and tartness in the middle, and a slightly warming close, but nowhere near where the abv would indicate. Mouthfeel and drinkability are okay ont his one. It's interesting, I'm just not sure it's something I would revisit often. But since it's a holiday seasonal, maybe it's supposed to be a one time annual treat or something. Worth a try regardless."
"Pours cloudy red & brown. Small tan head disappears rapidly, leaving tendrils of thin lace. Heavily over-spiced aroma. Orange, nutmeg, and pine hops on a sugary malt base. Flavor displays much better balance and depth. Starts sweet and fruity before introducing a good dose of pine-needle and orange hops. Finishes with tart alcohol, spices, vanilla, and plenty of dry hops. Very full in the mouth. Forceful carbonation keeps it feeling relatively light despite the chewy malt base."
"Overall, this beer was rather good, albeit very unique for the style. (It looked, smelled and tasted like a Belgian tripel yet was somehow labeled as a ""winter warmer."")"
"The taste is crisp, complex, and at times reminds me of a sort of tart unsweetened applesauce. Carbonation is present with a sort of tartness coming toward middle of the flavor alcohol warmth is present on the finish. This is a fun winter warmer sort of murkier, thick cider like, spicy brew worth picking up once a year."
"Explodes out of bottle filling mug with foam took forever to pour but off-white head vanishes without a trace. Cloudy amber color with yeast at bottom of bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Strong spicy plum nose. Starts sweet almost cloying, spicy toffee flavor balanced finish. High ABV is not noticeable. $3.99 for 2004 330ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"2007 bottle notes: Took the above advice, and just opened the '07 bottle with the Mt. Fuji sunrise. It exploded when I opened it, and lost at least 1/3 of the bottle. Crap. It was more full-bodied than I remembered, still alot of vanilla and nutmeg, some dull citrus. Didn't leave the glowing impression i've had in years past."
"Pours a brownish-orange in color with a light khaki head. Nose consists of malt, ginger, and it has an ale fruitiness to it. The aroma also has hints of feint cinnamon and an odd medicinal smell lingering in the background. Full-bodied mouthfeel with ample carbonation. Malty front with flavors of spicy clove and light cinnamon. Midway a citrus fruitiness arrives. The finish has an unsettling medicinal taste to it. As the beer warms the carbonation lessens, which softens the taste and makes it somewhat more palatable. There are some unique flavors going on here, but the odd medicinal taste is rather off-putting. After one, I didn't desire another."
"The folks at Kiuchi can pride themselves in the fact that they make what is most likely the best beer in Japan."
"A nice brew, but no cause for Celebration"
"Pours a pretty deep orange color with golden highlights, and a touch of yeast suspended in the body due to a less-than-careful pour. Nice carbonation yields a solid inch of off-white creamy head that sticks around for a while, leaving some nice lacing as it recedes. Aroma is spicy and yeasty, with lots of holiday spices (clove, nutmeg, allspice). Palate is full of sweet malt and tangy spices, along with a good bit of astringency. Body is nice and creamy, but the astringency leaves a tingly, antiseptic feeling in the mouth. A nice winter warmer, particularly if you like spiced ales."
"Thanks to Chris at Ebenezer's Pub for getting me this. It was a cloudy amber color with a small head. Wonderful spicy aroma, as well as some vanilla. The taste was disappointing. A nice citrus tang, spice (mainly clove), but I felt overwhelmed by the vanilla. The more I drank, the more the vanilla predominated. Not a very exciting beer."
"D - Above average. kind of tires out my tongue after one, not bad though."
"A fluffy off white head piles in the pour in spite of being the 2005 edition, so close to a year old. The aroma jumps up with an assertive vanilla and spice, cinnamon is evident and the underlying spice I think is the nutmeg list on the side of the bottle. Coriander is in the taste more, and the orange peel seems to be light at this point. Also, a bit of a musty taste, not bad, but the beer definately aged and mellowed some of the flavors. It is has a slight oily mouthfeel, creamy in the front and side until it hits a dry spicy finish--not bitter--just strong spice. Overall a pleasant beer, though it didn't warm up well, became a bit cloying with the sweetness."
"Drinkability: nice spicey brew here that is esily quaffed since the malt profile is a bit lighter than other winter warmers and alcohol doesn't drive the flavor profile."
"I wasn't super crazy about it when fresh, and it's still not really jiving with me. The ginger dominates the flavor, and the high levels of carbonation seem to add to that feel. I like ginger well enough, but it seems to interact oddly with the malt, not meshing particularly well. The wooden flavor is rather unappetizing. This brew seems to be at odds with itself, wanting to be sweet, but spicy and peppery as well. I think I liked it better when it was young, so the scores are a half and half."
"A good strong ale. Not overwhelming or palate challenging but at 9% I'd like to see more character in a beer."
"Drinkability: Definitely a palate pleaser with such a depth and range of flavors. Particularly wonderful."
"The beer vastly improved as it approached the warmer side. The beer took on a pineapple, starfruit tropical fruit mix of smells and flavors. I would recommend serving this with just the lightest chill possible."
"Hitachino Nest Celebration Ale is wonderful beer. I had some doubts about how this 2004 iteration has held up over the nearly 3 years since bottling, but I needn't have. I'm happy to report that it's outstanding at the moment and will likely last for a while longer. This is far and away my favorite Kiuchi beer and I'll be sure to buy every bottle that I can lay my hands on if I'm lucky enough to run across it again."
"Drinkability: This is not my favorite beer from Kiuchi, but it is damn good. Big, bold, complex, and quite warming. Very enjoyable!"
"good drinkability with a very well hidden 9% abv."
"An interesting brew, and a fine example of the style. Overall, I have enjoyed the hitachino beverages, but I think moreso for the japanese take on western styles than for the actual taste. this one has a ton of spices - i feel like i was on a journey through the Cape of Good hope to meet marco polo to bring back spices, but instead I decided to dive into the barrels a bit on the way (does this mean I was on the wagon, or off the wagon - 2 points for the reference). Anyway, that's really what you will get out of this brew - extremely balanced however. You can tell some time was put into this in choosing the spice levels, unlike some more popular winter beverages, cough (sam adams)."
"Thanks be to lou91 !"
"Thanks again to GreatGallaspy."
"I can't say there is anything wrong with this beer on any technical level but I don't really like it that much. Taken as a whole the flavors just don't really come together for me."
"Overall a very nice beer. Seems they put quite a bit of effort into it. I like how easy it is to distiquish each flavor in this complex beer."
"D- This is a wonderful winter warmer. It has nice spice that really just enhance the malt qualities and they don't need to stick out on their own. In Japanese cooking, there are a lot of very subtle flavors that still add lots of complex. This beer really takes on that idea of ""less is more"" in the same regard."
"Overall: This isn't a bad beer, the spices are nice, the beer is just too sweet."
"Found this 2004 bottle in the back of my beer fridge. Solid amber brown body with sediment swimming around. Very cool. The head is billowing, frothy like on a cappuccino, off white with the sediment from the bottle getting caught in the head, the head acts like a filter catching the particles. The effect looks like cinnamon has been sprinkled on top. Surprisingly the smell is tart, slightly vinegary, almost Flemish red like. A little green apple sent and caramel malt. No hops. After a few sips I get a smoky coffee sent too. The taste has a surprising hop presence and a great chocolate / coffee aftertaste. Very complex. The alcohol and malt mix very well on the front, creating that classic caramel and roasted malt flavor. The balance is good, the hops are a bit stronger in flavor but the alcohol keeps them in check with a solid bite, again, very complex. The mouthfeel is great, very light and carbonated so it evaporates on the tongue, with those hop oils keeping the mouth feel slick and oily. For a 9%-er the alcohol is present, actually adding to balance the beer, but just that, the beer is balanced so drinkability I would assume is how many 9%-er's can you handle in one night?"
"D- As drink progresses, the taste sours and becomes less enjoyable. Alcohol never was a huge factor in this beer."
"Drinkable? I can feel the alcohol in this, but those spices are pleasant and not overdone. Wonderful."
"I could sit down with a few of these, the high ABV is very well hidden. The only problem is that at $5 a pop for 11.2 ounces - this Celebration serves for special occasions."
"This is definitely a satisfying addition to the winter lineup. It is rich and satiating, and does not have a cloying sweetness to muddy things up. I also like how the spices are not too strong, they are barely noticeable individually and just sort of integrate and make the beer a bit more complex."
"330 ml 2005 bottle. Pours a murky glowing amber, finger of off-white head that fades fairly quick, little lacing. Nose is a slightly soure fruitiness, remiscent of cherries and peach, piney hops, some muddled spices, and a slight doughy malt, very interesting. Taste starts with a nice cookie-like malt, some light citrusy fruit, and a lnice spicey/peppery/hoppy finish. This is a really nice and complex take on the style, more fruitiness than any other warmer I've had, but it really melds nicely with the spices. And absolutely no hint of the alcohol. Medium/full bodied with a medium carbonation and a very smooth feel. This is my first beer from Hitachino and it's really a wonderful first exposure to a good Japanese brewer. I will be drinking more from them in the future."
"Ginger takes a pic axe to the tip of the tongue. Love the mouthfeel, really can feel the spices on the tongue. Leaves along a tingly feeling on the tongue from the spices that almost feels slightly numbing. High malt charecter, around 9% alc. but given a year of aging I would assume it may be around 9.3 (?). Makes for a great night cap beer."
"Wow. A beautiful surprise. An ideal winter treat; a perfect complement for Christmas decorating. I want more!"
"This beer poured a hazy copper with a decent sized off0white head. The aroma reminded me of a Belgian Tripple It had sweet malt in the form of dates, some orange, coriander and just a touch of fresh bread. The taste is very light and citrusy. More of the orange, and a bit of Nectarine. It has a bit of hop bitterness, but this blends well with the added spice to deliver the light citrus up front The spice is very light. Difficult to detect the coriander, it feels like a little pepper in the finish. The label said vanilla, but I cant find any here. Very dry and smooth mouth feel, almost astringent. OK drinkability."
"Full-bodied, and fantastic. I will waste no more words. Find it, if you can, and enjoy."
"11.2 oz short bottle pours a cloudy glowing reddish orange color with a nice creamy light brown head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Spicy cinnamon and citrus aroma, vanilla, cinnamon, citrus and wheat flavors. Full bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, alcohol is more noticeable as it warms, I like it."
"My tongue was just blessed with flavors of Sees Candy toffee, bergamont on a balanced spiced backbone. Complex and just flavorful. The flavors just penetrate your taste buds and leave rich deep goodness. I highly reccommend this brew. It's very effervescent and was made to grace our mouths."
"Overall: Very nice one, not too big and out of control, but a very nice, complex brew."
"Drinkability and Notes  The thinish body makes this very drinkable for an eisback, but that isn't actually what I am looking for in amassive beer. However this is a good version of a strong Bock, and in my opinion the best beer I have had from Hitachino thus far."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a very light head that sits nicely atop the brew. Nose is gingerbread, with a light pine and moderate sweetness. Reminds me of the Anchor OSA series. The flavor is less gingerbready than the flavor. I get more of the pine and moderate hop bitter. I get a slight metallic flavor as well. Nothing really drawing me in with this one. The feel is moderate with a light-moderate carbonation. Very pleasing on the palatte. Overall, a pretty pedestrian brew. The alcohol does not come through at all, but the flavors and aroma do not draw me in at all."
"Nice dark maroon colored body, some suspended particles in the beer, with some carbonation also visible. Head is creamy and slow fading, leaving a smal off white layer on the beer. Smell is sweet, with spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, and yes, those vanilla beans it talks about on the bottle. Taste is very rich and smooth, the spices impart a mild smokiness to the beer, while the vanilla and alcohol give it a sweet, yet slightly tingling burning sensation. A very smooth drinker, doesn't challenge you, very agreeable on the palate. Excellent, probably the best Japanese beer I have ever had."
"Poured into a chalice as an after dinner brew. solid one finger head that has fortitude and body. Dark tan color almost brown in the middle. smell some metallic but after the first drink it fades. Caramel was the dominant smell and taste. some burnt flavors but mostly sweet and the alcohol is well hidden. This brewery is outstanding and they seem to push the edge of their styles. I do think this brew is at its peak or close to it coming into 2006. I just wish they would ship their beers over in bigger sizes as the stubie to me is not the greatest for long distance."
"I could have one, maybe two more, but the mouthfeel and abv hurt the drinkability."
"This beer is very interesting from start to finish. Pleasant spices, strong alcohol, and a nice malt base. Not much in the way of hops, but well balanced, nonetheless. Recommended."
"Overall, probably a better beer closer to the release date, but hey.. It's still a tast beer with an interesting vision (we hope) of the Japanese beer markey."
"Pours a medium brown color with a huge head that has good retention and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very good for the style. Lots of dark fruits (raisins, plums) and alcohol and some sweetness - very intense aromas. The flavor is not what I expected. Much thicker than expected. The dark fruits are very prominent, but they are melded with some dark malts, possibly some chocolate malt. Very well blended. The alcohol is there only with its warming character toward the end. Very nice flavor. The mouthfeel is borderline thick and the drinkability is very good for the high alcohol."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a deep copper/amber with a slight haze with a big fluffy off white head that settles to a nice creamy mass,aromas of green apple brown sugar with a light smokiness in ther as well.There is so much going on flavor wise its hard to put a finger on everything,I get some juicy orange and some spice like nutmeg and cloves some pepper in there like others have notes as well.The sharp prickly mouthfeel is not so great but Iam sure as it ages it might round out better.I think this one would only get better after putting up for awhile its big and in your face as is."
"Drinkability: if you don't drink this when the opportunity arises, you will do yourself an unbelieveable disservice. An absolute ""must-drink"" beer."
"Overall, a nice beer but I was expecting more from one of my favorite breweries."
"The color is hazy copper with a good-sized, light brown head. The smell is spicy, with corriander and orange peels popping out. The taste is equally as spicy as the aroma. A peppery wood taste is joined by light touches of orange and other spices. A light sweetness is noted too, a combination of the cinnamon and nutmeg. The 9% ABV is not noted in the flavor at all. Different tastes hit every part of my tongue, each with different spices jumping out. Wow, this is very complex and interesting making it hard to adequately describe. Lots of respect to Kiuchi for making such an experimental brew."
"Drinkability: Very impressive Eisbock from this always intriguing, Japanese brewery. This is one of their better offerings, and is really an adventure to enjoy and sort through all its nuances. Lots of complexity allows the high abv to sneak up on you, but this one is a lot of fun to enjoy."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark amber color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. There are lots of suspended yeast floaties. The aroma is great. It has a rich, malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a kick ass spice aroma. It's full of nutmeg, orange peel, cinnamon, and ginger; very nice. The taste is good. It has a refreshing spice flavor that is balanced with a solid malt base and hops. It has a strong nutmeg flavor that goes down easy and finishes bitter from the orange peel. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a damn good celebration ale. It has awesome spice content; a good drinker."
"Drinkability: Terrific beer in so many ways but I would prefer just a touch less carbonation - but I feel that way about a number of Belgian style beers."
"Not quite up to par with the 2004, which was a favorite of mine to have around til I couldn't find it anymore. But this is still a pretty nice little beer and wouldn't pass it up for nothin'."
"The flavor has a tart start, hops folow, then round biscuity malt, and the bitterness returns at the end. Vanilla appears in the nose and the mouth after a bit. The mouthfeel is super creamy and luscious. The hops hits the back of your throat at the finish, along with the first suggestion of the high alcohol. Nice balance. Complex but organized. Really nice."
"Super cool label on this beer with a true japanese influence. This beer pours out a wicked fluffy white head into my duvel tulip. The body is a very cloudy brown leather with an orange backbone. The smell is like a kick in the face full of super sweet malt. The taste is like a sweet molasses burst in your mouth. I can pick up the burnt orange and cinnamon in this beer. The heavy lacing stuck around until the end. This one has a dangerous, well hidden, abv in it. Excellent beer and I am excited to try others from this brewery. Hail to the land of the rising sun!"
"Poured a deep orange-brown with an explosive head, puffy and thick and way carbonated. Had a sweet malty sugary smell, with tangerine, caramel, orange peel and clove flavors that mix with some lemony hops in the finish. Sugary and fizzy mouthfeel, a bit too syrupy sweet and fizzy to make it as drinkable as I would like, but still wuite good. I think this one would benefit from a couple more years on the shelf, will have to grab another and see what it's like in 2007."
"This beer pours a super hazy orange color with a large highly carbonated head. Aroma is strong on the sweet orange flavor and a sweet malty alcohol hit then a whole bunch of spices. This beer is packed with spices. Too many to name but here's what I got: sweet and bitter orange, cinammon, vanilla, cloves, coriander, and nutmeg. These spices were strong and unique but didn't really blend together much. The body was medium and creamy with an adjunct rice flavor base. A good hit of alcohol subdued the spices a bit and warmed my belly. The finish is dry but I'm getting a lot of fusel alcohol esters in there. This beer has a lot of promise and I think in about 6 months to a year it will be really good. However, right now it's on the rough side and a bit too young. Once to spices work with each other and the alcohol flavor goes down a little this will be great. Still, this was one unique beer experience."
"Poured a hazy, orange-amber color. This beer has a big malt-accented and caramel sugary aroma that reminds me of Belgian Tripel. My nose has to search for the spices described on the label. Fairly full-bodied for a Japanese beer, yet very fizzy. The spices are subdued at first, but get brighter as the beer warms up. The cinnamon dries out the tongue in a bit of an unpleasant way. This effect is accented by a dry finish. A complicated spicy brew that I would like to try again, even thoug the I thought it to be a little pricey at $4 an 11-ounce bottle."
"Kind of a loose, cavernous, Pitfall Harry look to head. Hazy orange hue with a great deal of action; impossible to see through. Orange peel predominates on the nose with some soluble white pepper and a mustard flash. Grock of tart lemon rind shredding that puckers the lips and crosses the eyes; after a time, tongue and mouth become accustomed, or numbed, to this and other aspects pull through  a smart hop bite, some light wasabi heat, and almost a rubbery taste. Mouth cringes at first with this one, but eventually things settle with a crisp alcohol sting. Not for the uninitiated."
"11.2 oz bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) in Feb 2005 and consumed a couple days later. Huge hiss when I opened the bottle, so I poured as gentle as possible, but still got a 7-finger head from just half of the bottle. A light beige head over the orange liquid...cloudy, even though I'm sure the yeast sediment was retained in the bottle (of which there is a bunch of). Smells enticing. Orange and spicy, with some gentler tones of caramel and vanilla. Starts sweet with notiable alcohol playing strongly over orange, coriander, and a belgian-like yeasty funk. Has a caramel and lightly toffee flavor...any bock character is buried beneath the spicing. Strong wet sugar and some fruity esters do rise barely above the spices. Medium-thick and creamy-smooth mouthfeel and, amazingly, the carbonation is moderate. It forms fine acrid bubbles that dances with the alcohol burn. Couldn't help but get some sediment in the beer now that I've poured the second half in...but the foaming is only about half as bad as the first half of the bottle. The small amount of yeast in the beer definitely does not help the flavor as it flattens some of the fruity character and amplifies the funk and acrid. What the heck, this beer is already shot...in goes the rest of the yeast. It's now a muddy chocolatey appearance of it's former self. Even the head (which is still 3-fingers) is darker... a full-fledged tan. Yeast is more prevalent in the smells. Taste...this is an entirely different beer from the very frist sip. Better than with a smidge of the sediment in the glass. The spicing is more subdued and overall the beer is flatter and more earthy. Still very sweet though. It ends now with a milder alcohol that mixes with noticable caramel/toffee. No lacing and, damn, I've got a buzz off of one beer (am I back in Jr. High again?). 9%...I'll bet it's more. I'm glad I tried it, this was definitely a challenging beer, but I'm not interest in trying it again. So...I'm not going to judge this as an eisbock (as it is presently categorized her on BA), but as a spiced beer. Too bad about the excessively foamy head and clouody liquid, it could have scored much higher."
"With time in the bottle this could prove to be a treat. Now, it is a challenge."
" Drinkability is good not a bad little beer, if you love spicey beers this one is for you. My bottle had 2004 on it but it was the spiced version 2005 for sure, not the eisbock of 2004."
"I dunno, this beer is really complex and very pretty, I'm just not all that much into sweet brews."
"Drinkability- This is going to be a Christmas regualr try. Only once a year though. Not sure if prunes and I get along to well. Damn interesting though. Pick one up for a new experience."
"Drinkability  You have to try this full effect beer just to say youve had it. It is a wild ride."
"Smell is strong alchol, barleywine-type smell. I don't care for it but it is hitting the style right on the nose, I still have to score it low. very hard to drink. All the nice holiday spices are weak compared to the alcohol esters. This is the worst beer from Hitachino to date."
"Overall, my guess is this brew might have gotten a little long in the tooth to be truly exceptional. Nevertheless, it is a nicely complex beer that displays a wide breadth of tastes and aromas."
"Pours to a murky brownish-orange color with an off-white head. The aroma is malty and spicy with coriander and nutmeg at the front. In the back of the aroma is a bit of orange peel and cinnamon. The flavor is extremely spicy. The nutmeg and coriander hit me like a ton of bricks. I get some ginger in here as well. The cinnamon and orange is also present. It has a solid malt backbone. It is fairly full bodied and warming. A very dry finish with this one. A unique holiday brew. Could only have one though."
"Giant, sticky marshmallow head composed of bubbles of all sizes fills half the glass and more, quivering like gelatin where it sits above the rim. Eerie orange glow extends from the head through the chestnut-colored liquid with amber highlights. Lots of protein (?) floating around in the beer leads to medium clarity... With little carbonation to be seen, the head eventually dies, although very slowly. As soon as the cap leaves the bottle, the smell of clove-studded oranges fills the kitchen. After pouring, the glass fumes with gigantic odors of spiced apple, cinnamon, and nutmeg (which in turn suggests egg nog). Coriander gets stronger, and right quick. Celery? Vegetal nosefeel? Dried flowers and cedar chips... mental images of primaeval fern rainforests. Wait, it gets weirder. Heavy cinnamon and nutmeg flavors can barely stand up to coriander and celery seed. Cilantro, then more nutmeg. Raw, assaultive nutmeg. Space alien vanilla pods. Swishing in my mouth, I finally find some light toffee flavors... but I'm grasping for them, as I am for plum in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is prickly and almost numbing from the spice alone, slightly syrupy across the palate. Nutmeg belches fit for a Toho monster rev up about halfway through the bottle. Judgement? Let this be made clear: everything they list on the label will be tasted in turn, and tasted BIG. Other than that... This beer is like psilocybin that's been localized to affect only the tongue. As with psychedelia, the overall experience is difficult to perceive (or verbalize) because the mental shifts of proportion involved are just too great. A beer that bends my tongue as far back and forth as this one could be called ""fun"" to a certain extent... but it's just too weird for me to find truly enjoyable."
"Taste was basically smooth and refreshing orange juice for me, with accents of balsamic vinegar and cloves. Juicy. Not too spiced--mild; not too sweet--but juicy; got body--but not heavy. Good balance and feel. Hops are way in the background but must be covering some of the alcohol. Easy drinkability for 9% -- great spiced brew, very refreshing."
"My first review of a beer from Japan and my first Eisbock review all rolled into one. This poured out with a murky opaque brown body with a huge light tan head. The head falls leaving a cap of bubbles to cover the body and leaves sticky rings of lace around the glass as it is consumed. Fruit sweetness with a good touch of caramel stands out first in the nose before giving way to the huge spiciness in this brew. Cinnamon and nutmeg where the two spices I could identify but there was a lot more going on in this great smelling brew. A nice caramel flavor greets you when you first sip that is covered in spices. There was a bit of fruitiness to the flavor as well as a nice bitter spicy after taste that was excellent. Very complex in the nose and mouth, I will need to gather a few more of these to full appreciate them. The mouthfeel was almost full and it was silky and left you wanting more with every sip. Unfortunately I only picked up one bottle, as after I drank this I wanted more. This is definitely on of the best beers I have had and really left me wanted more. Highly recommended to all."
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a billowing offwhite head that bubbles to over 2 inches high which leaves a decent lace. Damn that's some bubbly shit. Aromas are initially spicey, following with some fig and grapes and other yeast esters, and a big of dose of malt. Initial flavors are sharply or spice but then quickly move to a pleniful amount of darks fruits, with figs, grapes, and a slight pear like flavor hit. Following there is some molasses light sugar sweetness and then almost a complete 180 with a smokey like flavor. This brew finishes spicy and fruity, with a final warm alcohol tone. Overall this brew is very full bodied, with a tingling carbonation."
"Glad I picked this up, it really surprised me. Great beer."
"Pours a beautiful, creamy tan color and coarbonation dissapates with a silky evenness. the aroma reminds me of a full bouquet of exotic spices, connamon, cloves, vanilla bean, nutmeg, and pepper. tastes of sandlewood and vanilla, with a slow nuanced peppery, cinnamon lingering through the taste. A very sophisticated beer, an acquired taste and truly fabulous, memorable. One to savor slowly. the fullness of its falvor profile and rich body lingers on and on. Wonderful"
"(2007 edition) white foamy head, all the spices there. Just below room temperature. Extremely gushy,lost at least a third of the bottle. Drying finish."
"Hitachino Nest's New Year Celebration Ale 2004 certainly delivers a beer worth celebrating! The huge creamy head of light-tan froth over it's reddish-chestnut body is quite attractive; and its head retention and lacing are excellent. The aroma is welcoming and exciting with brisk notes of pine and orange peel over a doughy, caramel drizzled maltiness. Its very fine, bottle-conditioned carbonation lends a gentle zest to the tongue that's then carried through to the finish by its bright spiciness. As it warms, however, the carbonation subsides a bit and it's full maltiness comes forward, leaving it dextrinous, creamy, and smooth. Bold cinnamon, nutmeg, and pine flavors appear right up front in the flavor; with some citrusy notes from the orange peel appearing mid-palate as it's honeyish and deeply caramelized malt becomes more apparent. The finish is extensive with more orange peel, some coriander, and even a note of vanilla appearing after the swallow. The ghost of some chocolate malt follows, and then some lingering hoppy flavors and a solid, drying bitterness and swirling spice. Forget that this is actually an eisbock, it's one of the most impressively spiced ales that I've ever tried!!! An although my initial thought was that it tastes like Anchor's ""Our Special Ale", it's actually much more refined and complex. Brilliant!"
"The head is huge. Creamy tan, flat top, fine and slow, leaving swoops and spots of lacing. The beer is a gorgeous ambery-ruby and quite clear until the last pour, which turns it hazy and leaves a few floaties. A sweet, tangy nose gives up nutmeg, grapes, a little overripe fruit, some cream and hops. Sweet and bitter fruit in the caramel, yeasty front. Some light chocolate and liqueur with nice, sour fruit in the middle. The finish is quite bitter, with grapefruit, cherries and more nutmeg. This is very, very good. Fantastic fruit-hop, sweet-bitter balance."
"Note: There were considerable lees in the bottle, which turned off some drinkers, but it didn't bother me."
"Dirty brown body, cloudy with a huge foamy head, sticky and long-lasting. This scores big points for a 9% beer. Aroma is sweet and spicy, not unlike that of a well made gingerbread. Theres lots of curacao, coriander touch and altogether a great balance of the difference spices, which I assume is a great task and here much better executed than in last years anchor OSA. Nutmeg and candi sugar makes an apparition in this orangey beer. The main surprise of the first sip is the high level of yeast flavor which adds a belgian feel. At times, you feel its spicy enough that its more or less of a beer, but youve still got to recognize the deep complexity and art involved. Flavors are hard to grasp and put words on, but you know when you enjoy it. On the other hand, it would have scored much higher with me wouldnt it be of this disturbing mouthfeel. 2-3 seconds after putting the liquid in your mouth, it becomes ultra-creamy, spongy and foamy (a bit like La Moneuse) and the flavors are not integrated as well, more reminding of food coloring than anything else, but it settles back to its greatness in the aftertaste. Still, the bottom line is that this is excellent, original as in a brewers imagination has no limits and very christmas friendly."
"This stuff is really awesome. I would say it belongs in Dogfish Head's repertoire, but that's not fair to Hitachino. I gotta try their other stuff. To the beer store, Fatman!"
"Yeah, right."
"Pours a dark ruby brownish with an HUGE pillowy off white head.. Nose is of allspice, malt and prunes. Taste is a bit malty at first with spice. Orange bitterness, with some allspice,cinnamon, bitterness follows.. My first time tasting a Hitachino beer. I was suprised how tasty and close to a Belgian style grand cru this comes.. Mouthfeel was good with ample carbonation without being prickly ( granted I had this 4 months after the new year) Drinkability is a bit above average.. Dont think i would pay 6 bucks for 12oz of this again esp when other better beers are cheaper."
"After I poured the whole bottle into a glass. It became apparent that this is bottle conditioned. As my glass was filled with a reddish amber liquid full of chunks floating around in it. I did notice the nice big foamy beige head. There is a strong tantalizing sweet and alcohol aroma with herbs and spices. The alcohol is not readily apparent in the taste. But you start feeling it in your stomach pretty quickly. The taste has some malt sweetness to it follwed by a hint of ginger and a smooth bitterness on the finish. Next time I try this I will be sure to not pour out the entire bottle. After a while the chunks melted and gave the beer a cloudy appearance."
"Deeply complex, yet simple enough to enjoy, this is a beer that hits hard with spice before settling into a mellow, satisfying sipper. A very nice brew with which to celebrate."
"Large, pillowy beige head over a glowing, nearly opaque deep red-orange brew. Powerful aroma of spices from the minute I popped the cap--coriander, orange peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla beans, according to the label, and I was able to pick most of those out, with an additional bready, yeasty element. Strong carbonation and a head that just wouldn't quit. On the tongue, a tart bitterness kissed by hops fades into a semisweet, dry finish, with strong alcohol presence without, and a repeat appearance of the yeast and spices. Afterflavor is soft, sprinkled with maltiness. Pretty good stuff, definitely appropriate for special occasions."
"Hitachino Nest Celebration Ale 2004 pours a deep red brown with a huge, thick head that stands tall above the beer for a long time. Nose has some spice (cinnamon and clove) and a little bit of malt. Taste is slightly sour (orange peel?), with some savory (as opposed to sweet) elements and some notes of wheat. Bitter finish. Very bubbly mouthfeel - almost champagne-like. Very drinkable - I would have guessed around 7% if someone had asked me - not the 9% that is actually hiding there. An excellent brew."
"A most interesting beer. The 9% ABV is well hidden until that first sip...can't really taste it, but you certainly feel the warmth. Pours a bright ruby brown color, heavily carbonated...so there's a well retaining head and lots of bubbles. The nose is intense, with notes of candy sugar, yeast, coriander and maple syrup. Heavily carbonated and has a sharp feel on the palate, but that seems to fit with the amount of complexity and alcohol in this brew. Somewhat sweet flavor yields to a biting hop character before revealing all the spices: clove, vanilla, cinnamon. Heavily spiced, but the carbonation and good amount of alcohol warmth keep them in check. Still can't taste that alcohol, but you know it's there! A very interesting brew, worth seeking out."
"Nearly impossible to pour this without the head exploding all over the place. Under the gigantic mass is a reddish/golden brown liquid. Smell is of vanilla, lots of vanilla, and coriander, and a myriad of other celebration spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, clove?). Light body and not too sweet. Quite drinkable for 9%. Nice work Mr. Hitachino Owl."
"It is a hazy, ruby color with a smooth off-white head. The aroma is sweet and spicy with notes of cirtus and nutmeg. It has some spiciness to it and it is very complex. The corriander and orange peal jump out, but the cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla are lurking in the backlground. It finishes smooth. It would be nice to see what it would be like in a year or so to see what flavors begin to stand out."
"Thanks to chaduvel for this bottle. Pours a light brown with shades or reddish orange, accompanied by a sticky light tan head. Smell is a nice interplay between candy-sweet malts, orange sorbet, vanilla, and coriander. Taste is much like the smell. Sweet throughout, although not too cloying (unlike stille nacht--cloyed my eyes out!). Nice mix of spices and sweet malt, with adequate hop bitterness to take off some of the sweet tooth edge. I quite liked this celebratory ale--my first offering from Hitachino too by the way!"
"Get this on tap, now."
"Smell the empty bottle when you are done. It smells like fresh peaches."
"This is a very delicious, interesting brew; highly recommended by me - but caution needs to be exercised when opening and pouring!"
" This one seems to be educating me as I go. It requires patience. Don't drink this one quickly or you will miss some of its gifts. It's very creamy now that I'm into the second half. It's worth buying again for its complexity. This is the first introduction to this brewery that I've had and I look forward to exploring more of its work. My next purchase will be more of this 2004 editon. Artfully done"
"Happy New Year!"
"Overall this is a very tasty brew, but it could be improved with allowing a little bit more of the spice coming through in my opinion."
"Flavor has a malty front, spicy and yeasty middle with cinnamon, nutmeg and orange peel on the finish. slight alcoholic mouthfeel on the finish. Beer is very alive in the mouth and highly drinkable beer."
"found this at firewater's in atlantic city and had to try it. i'm glad that i did. it pours with an utterly monstrous head...so much so that my non-aggressive pour resulted in slight head spillage onto the bar (oops). regardless, this brew looked great with it's massive head and amber-ish colour. there is a slight cloudy effect here as well. nice. smells quite nice, with spice dominating vanilla, fruit, hop, malt and what reminded me of the soba noodle smell from rogue's morimoto soba brew. again, quite nice. the taste is quiet similar to the smell, with some alcohol flavouring mixed in, though nothing offensive, just the right amount actually. body is a bit lighter than expected but welcome and refreshing nonetheless. very easy drinking for a 9.0 brew. didn't even realize it was so until i was about 3/4 of the way through. recommended."
"Poured from a stubby 11.2 oz brown bottle with a rather ornate label, it's murky brown with traces of orange. The head just explodes, even on a slow pour and leaves a 1 cm. layer on top of the glass to the end. The smell is just about sensory overload: spicy and hoppy. All the listed ingredients-coriander, orange peel, nutmeg, and vanilla beans-make their presence known in spades. It just smell like the holidays. All of that makes its way to the taste but the hop bitterness just knocks things out of whack slightly. It's nice, but it doesn't quite live up to the promise of the smell. It certainly doens't taste like a 9% beer. Happy New Year."
"Pours a pale brown with a supe duper head, I even got a dark brown yeast swirl at the top. Smells of mild woodsy spices and faintly of hops. The taste is nice, almost belgian dark ale, good thick chewy yeast and roasted malt flavors backed up by spices and mildly dry hop finish. This beer does not reveal its 9% abv at all while I consume it, no alcohol flavors at all, just nice spiced, Belgian type dark ale flavors with a well balanced dry finish. Super job from Kiuchi on this beer."
"Pours forth with a spectacular head of orangey creamy foam that settles over very yeasty hazy brownish liquid. Orange peel aromas greet the nose with nutmeg wafting behind it. Malty sweet goodness and a tad of alcohol follows behind. Notes of vanilla, alcohol and orange wash over the palate, crashing together to form a wonderful taste sensation, full malty backbone/mouthfeel. The hops cut thru all of the above with a pleasant lingering bitterness after the sweet and spicy notes fade. Finishes warming and powerful, very unique and well worth the 4 dollar purchase price."
"What a superb little holiday brew from the Kiuchi folks. Monolithic, glacier-sized head fades back to a thin film interspersed with little ""bacterial colonies"" of bubbles. Aroma flings itself off this brew and into your nose whether you try to catch it or not -- coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, and orange dominate. Distinctly yeasty, the coriander, cinnamon, and alcohol lay overtop an orange rum cake base. Finishes with a bit of an unexpected bitterness -- pure, true, chewy-woody bitterness. I'm guess that as good as this is now, it'll be that much better at this time next year. Quite impressive."
"This ale drinks pretty easy. Mouthfeel is robust. It really hits the palate. I could only drink one of these at a time because of the sweetness. It is very nice but it singes the mouth with a bit of a puckering feel."
" It IS a real celebration as Kiuchi brewery continues to win me over."
"Reddish amber color. VERY large white tiny bubbled head. Aroma is spice, orange zest and cinnamon. A medium bodied eisbock. Malts are bready and sweet. Hops are spicy. Cinnamon, orange, allspice, clove and vanilla flavors are in the mix. Smooth taste. There are a lot of subtle, and not so subtle, complexities to this beer. The sweetness and spicy play a nice point/counterpoint to the alcohol flavors. At 10% alcohol there is a lot of tummy warming going on, but the alcohol bite, although present is not objectionable. NICE beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"Turbid deep chestnut hue. Mountainous, rocky light tan leaves steadfast lace. Complex, yet balanced melange of vibrant spices, of which orange peel and cinnamon are dominant. Subtle coriander along with rich, deep toffee surface as the beer warms. Trace diacetyl adds a mellow, agreeable, buttery note. Quite ""festive"" and inviting aromawise. Cinnamon cookie sweetness hits the palate upfront. Orange peel and hop immediately leap in and lend a sharp, bright, but unastringent bitterness. Mild cocoa notes and sour, fermented plum persist throughout. Subtle vanilla melds with trace butterscotch fully facilitating a dessert like flavor profile. Coriander is slight, but decidedly herbaceous and akin to the leaf of the plant, cilantro. Alcohol augments in intensity after being initially overshadowed, and lends a spicy, red licorice note. Medium bodied and quite spritzy in mouthfeel initially, but eventually viscous and nearly creamy. Finishes with lingering citric sourness contrasted by dark caramalt sweetness. A very tasty, whimsically spiced and potent brew. Not everything has coalesced yet in flavor yet, but this should change with time. Enjoyable and dangerous, indeed."
"This is a murky dark brown gusher, with a light tan head of foam. The aromas are excellent and consist of spicy alcohol, deep malts, light hops, different fruit esters, and the various spices that they used in this brew (ie: cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, orange peels) The taste is almost as good as the aroma, with the gentle spiciness hanging out with the huge maltiness and spicy alcohol flavors. The mouthfeel is super creamy, and almost dreamy and the drinkability is excellent for a 9% experimental beer from one of Japans greatest breweries."
"Overall: Very nice. Im not a fan of Japanese beers per se, but this was impressive. I may have to pick me a couple more of these the next time I hit the beer Store. If you only have one Japanese beer in your life, make it this one. Highly Recommended."
"Drinkability: This is a mighty tasty beer with a lot going on. Many Belgian overtones with the hops and fruitiness. If I see more at the store, I'm snagging it. I can't say it's an authentic eisbock (as the label claims) as I've only had one other eisbock in my life, but this is still a stellar beer. I suspect the discrepancy here might be a bit of ""Japlish," as it were. Zig for great justice!"
"One year later the flavors have converged well with an herbal flavor dominating the flavor profile. Still a really tasty brew."
"paid $2.99 for 12oz."
"Silky mouth feel, long lasting flavor."
