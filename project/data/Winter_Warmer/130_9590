4.3,19.4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"I am drinking this the same month as its best by date. It has an earthy spicy hop nose, and some cardamom to cola. It pours brilliant burn amber to garnet under an off-white foam cap. The palate starts creamy and malty and then there a little tanginess arises followed by some smooth malt flavors that fade as it dries out in the finish and lingers with a mingling of malty and bitter after tastes with just a touch of pepper. A hint of heat, very faint roast, medium body and medium to a shade less on the carbonation.","pat61","Dec 13, 2014"

Initial taste is very evidently cocoa with some flatly bitter earthy hops. Taste then transitions to a sweeter malty and heath bar like middle while still maintaining a degree of bitterness the finishes with a flat bitterness that has sweetness around the edges and as such fades into the aftertaste.

This brew poured to a clear vibrant amber color with a thick off white to tan head that had great retention and left lots of lacing throughout. Caramel and a slight biscuit aroma come to mind from the malt. Nice amount of hop aroma comes through the nose from this one, seems to me that the Willamette and Cascade hops really show up and mix together quite well. The flavor is a very good mix of malt flavors, which really create the backbone as the flavors are always there - caramel and toasted flavors come to mind. Hops give a real nice flavor profile here, while not in your face they are on the dominant side. For me the spices do not really come out at all but maybe I am just missing them. Overall this is a very nice brew, easy drinking - not really sure why this is considered just a winter warmer, it is an overall good brew.","Stimack","Jan 06, 2010"

There is an ever so slight sweet nutty flavor to the beer. The mouthfeel is quite sticky sweet and the aftertaste is very mild. This is a lighter bodied winter warmer, with a fairly modest ABV.

The palate is pleasantly hoppy, very unexpected actually. The outright bitterness is solid but the hops add flavorful depth (largely piney... a hint of citrus) that can be found squarely on top of the sweet, slightly toffee-like malts. The spiciness is mild, hot candy-like. This is a mighty tasty beverage and yet another reason to take note of the Looking Glass Series.

Off white head of medium duration and moderate lacing doesn't seem to promise what I'm looking for on this sub zero, windy weekend. I let this warm a bit, as I've learned from several visits that this taste better a bit warmer than 'straight from the 'fridge.". Nose is malty, offering up notes of plum, prune, and ripe apple, along with plenty of citric hops for the style. Smooth and a bit creamy from the outset, with more sweet than sour at first. Seems to achieve better balance with subsequent sips, with the fruit notes of the mildy robust dark malts blending well with some light, biscuity malt, and a very easy-going balance of sweet and tangy. Some diacetyl, but it's not intrusive. Hop bitterness is pretty minimal, but the aromatic aspects are very rewarding. A little bit yeasty, in a good way. Reasonable good mouthfeel and drinkability: it tricks you a bit into thinking it's a 'bigger' beer, when it at first seems thin for the style. I like my strong ales a bit stronger, but overall this has a filling, substantial heft and drinkability. The alcohol is mildly warming, and all but invisible on the palate. Never Summer isn't one of those mind-blowingly weird spiced winter ales that people seem to avoid, but is instead a very easy going yet full-flavored seasonal offerings. It's well worth a try. NOTE: After trying Boulder's "Killer Penguin" barleywine last year the Never Summer seems more and more like that beer's stylistic precursor, not a 'small beer' version by any means, but they definitely have a lot in common! Of the two I prefer Never Summer: it's a well-executed rendition of the American Strong Ale style.","Chaz","Jan 30, 2007"

This is an extremely drinkable brew, could be enjoyed at all times of the year. The alcohol and hop tinge hits you a bit in the end, pleasant.

Piney and citrusy hops ride atop a delicate caramelish malt in the aroma. The body is medium and it's got a surprisingly fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation that lends a light caress to the tongue before allowing it to fade smoothly away. The hops and malt indicated by the nose are exactly what's found in the flavor. They're well-entwined and work almost as one with the fruitiness of the citrusy hops giving a bit of a spark to its otherwise dry, slightly molasses-kissed malt. Piney hop flavor and a bit of spice (?) appear at the swallow as its bitterness steps forward. It finishes dry and lingering with bitterness, pine, and sublime spice.

Mouthfeel is medium as is carbonation, malt is heavy on cinnamon and brown sugar, some black cherry, but hauled back by floral and somewhat ashy hopping. Hits the back of the throat thickly, with a little bit of heat. Overall, a better-than-average beer, but a little too tight and underspiced for my expectations, came off almost as an ESB...","ADR","Nov 22, 2003"
3.85,6.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Clear bronzy-auburn hue, the slightly off-white head reached a very modest half-finger in height before fading to a scummy, soapy collar rather quickly. Spotty lace. Looks decent enough. Good aromas, hoppy with pine and citrus influences, malty goodness too, a kiss of fruit. Fair potency, a little more authority would be welcomed; it is inviting. The palate is pleasantly hoppy, very unexpected actually. The outright bitterness is solid but the hops add flavorful depth (largely piney a hint of citrus) that can be found squarely on top of the sweet, slightly toffee-like malts. The spiciness is mild, hot candy-like. This is a mighty tasty beverage and yet another reason to take note of the Looking Glass Series. Medium-full body, modest and appropriate carbonation that produces a pleasant, effortless, mouthfeel. This is a beer I am impressed with and something I need to quaff again. Lovely stuff. Try one.","bditty187","Nov 06, 2003"

3.3,-8.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Clear blonde hue, with a faint murk. Thin, but dense, persistent, porcelain white head leaves diffuse lace. Soft, doughy malt accompanied by a floral hop and grainy tart wheat combination upfront in aroma. Bated hint of clove phenol and honeyish sweetness add an herbally sweet contrast. Unique, but not well rounded aromawise. Transient wash of white bread sweetness incipient on flavor is ensued by a drying, yet lingering suggestion of lightly astringent wheat chaff and orange pith. Mellows mid palate, and notes of underbaked lemon cookie surface to provide token, but welcome malt character. Lightly bodied, with a functional, forgettable mouthfeel conducive to easy quaffing. Finishes concomitantly dry, metallic and tartly citric. An odd brew that attempted to stand out from the typically insipid filtered American wheat, but failed. Never Summer Ale is a decent brew overall, but no more. I realize now that this is a winter seasonal... this could be much better fresh.","marc77","Beers"
